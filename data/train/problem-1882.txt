John could remember the first time he’d had a nightmare while sleeping next to Sherlock. He’d woken up with a short gasp, dreading the restlessness that followed, but then he saw Sherlock’s sleeping form resting so close and was immediately calmed. It was as if all the paranoia and fear just melted away and he drifted back into sleep with unprecedented ease.
“That’s not the point.” John opened his eyes to look at Sherlock standing across from him, his arms folded behind his back and a look of frustration in his eyes.
John stopped in his tracks and shot daggers at his boyfriend. That was a low blow, even for Sherlock.
“Sherlock, not now.” John’s voice was stern, authoritative. Obviously not in the mood to discuss the matter, but honestly, how many more times was John going struggle his way through something as simple as reading a menu before he realized that getting glasses was not only practical, but necessary at this point?
“I don’t like this,” he said. His voice sounded small and miserable, and John cringed in sympathy. He picked up Sherlock’s head from where it rested with the intention of having him sit up, but instead the man simply plopped down into the crook of John’s neck as if it were his second home.
“Oh, um, thank you,” John said, taking it out of his outstretched hand. “You really could’ve kept it, you know, I didn’t mind.”
Sherlock got up out of his seat and went outside. He looked around for a moment, then stood John’s old cane near the window so it’d be easy to spot. He brushed himself off and came back inside.
After John ate his dinner and Sherlock had finished picking at his, they were sat together on the sofa, Sherlock wrapped up in a book while John leaned on his shoulder and watched the telly.
“I’m sorry, what? I thought I was supposed to be helping you with this case, not hiding in an old woman’s flat!” the doctor said in a terse whisper.
After a while of talking rugby and filling up their empty stomachs, their voices died down and the flat soon grew quiet; the only sounds coming from the soft clinking of dishware.
Sherlock found him and immediately asked if he needed to go to hospital, but John insisted that he’d be fine, he just needed a hot bath and some strong painkillers. This had happened before, and he knew the pain would dissipate to a dull ache within an hour.
“Yeah, you’re right. Well, um, goodnight, then,” John said, the words tumbling out of his mouth before he could stop them. His thought process was something more like ‘
“Christ, it hurts,” he breathed. He sounded as if he was fighting back tears. Sherlock didn’t know if he’d seen him in such a bad way before.
bothered right from the start. You remember at that first crime scene, I offered to go get everyone coffee?”
As he and Sherlock had worked, John hadn’t been able to stop thinking about how important Sherlock had become to him over the past few months, about how alone he’d felt before he met him. John had only recently come to terms with his identity, having doubted that he’d ever be comfortable enough with himself to admit when he had feelings for someone. But after spending the last few weeks with Sherlock, all of those doubts and fears had seemed to fall away without him even noticing.
“Right.” Lestrade bit his bottom lip in thought.  “How about I wrap his left arm around my shoulder,” he said as he reached over to carefully lift John’s arm up. “And you take his other arm.”
“Yes, I’m absolutely sure. If you’re uncomfortable with this in any way, however, we can stop,” Sherlock reassured, his voice low and soothing.
“John?” He tried, feeling more comfortable on a first name basis. To his joy, the doctor opened his eyes, and stared with a confused expression at the tall man hovering over him.
Sherlock had even started helping out on cases once more, after almost imploding from bouts of boredom. Things were slowly becoming routine again, until one night in particular when Sherlock came in to find John staring hopelessly in the direction of his laptop.
John hit the ground with brutal force. His movements had come to a halt but when he opened his eyes, everything around him appeared to be spinning. His entire right side felt awash in searing pain, pain that he couldn’t even fathom yet with his mind still trying to comprehend the shock of the fall itself. He groaned and shut his eyes tight, attempting to bring back the wind that’d been so thoroughly knocked out of him.
John cursed under his breath at the fact that there was virtually no one else on the street near him, not to mention the fact that he’d forgotten his wallet.
John opened and closed his mouth uselessly as he tried to think of what to say. He hadn’t planned on talking about this sort of thing with Sherlock, in fact he hadn’t planned on talking about it with anyone, really, but he found himself suddenly wanting to.
Upon opening the door, John was met with the sight of an empty, perfectly made bed, with his cardigan folded neatly on top of the sheets.
“Good, but I’m still making you tea because it always relaxes you, and I’ll get the duvet from your room; you like that one best.”
The feeling of gritty soil in his mouth made him want to be sick, and he coughed weakly in an attempt to rid his tongue of dirt, but he was still far too out of breath for it to make much of a difference.
Just then, John noticed Mrs. Hudson herself out of the corner of his eye, making her way to them with coffee pot in hand and a floral apron tied around her waist.
John’s phone call with his sister had gone over surprisingly well. It hadn’t been great, and they still had a lot to work through, but Harry had managed to talk to him without nearly as many expletives as usual, which was, frankly, more than John could have hoped for.
“Let’s see…an anatomical heart; that’s easily to show your love of anatomy and dream to be a doctor. The night sky with various stars and constellations; simple, that’s to do with you and your strange fascination with astronomy.”
“Well, maybe I’m not—“ John was cut off when the people on the dance floor suddenly erupted in chaotic shouts and shrieks. He whipped around to see people fleeing from the floor where there was a small group gathered around some sort of fight.
John chuckled and gingerly swept the blood off of the taller man’s face. The restroom was a pocket of silence compared to the bar outside the door, making John’s ministrations feel strangely intimate.
The black jeep pulled slowly up to the small, humble cabin hidden away in the snowy woods. Sherlock parked the car on the gravel driveway and turned to John.
John rubbed Sherlock’s back soothingly as he was sick. He didn’t quite know why he felt an almost instinctive urge to care for him; he hardly knew him apart from occasionally passing him on the way to class.
“I can teach you the technique, you know. It’s quite simple, really, all you have to do is- Oh, for Christ’s sake,” Sherlock cursed under his breath as his phone alerted him to a text. He swiped his phone roughly from off the table and began stabbing away at the keys as he responded.
“John, I know the start of a panic attack when I see it. My ex-wife used to have them. It’s nothing to be ashamed of.”
Breaking the news to the gang at Scotland Yard had been Sherlock’s doing, though in fact he’d only told Lestrade, with instructions to let everyone else know.
“With all due respect, sir, this is a degenerative condition. I don’t think coming in a week or so earlier would’ve hindered its progression.”
“Hamish, what's wrong?” He was in his pyjamas, his favourite stuffed bee clutched to his side, but his eyes looked red-rimmed and brimming with tears.
“Why would Mycroft do something like this out of the blue, Sherlock? Is this secretly for a case? Am I going to find some criminal playing hide and seek in the woods?”
“Like a mother hen, John. Like a mother hen.” Sherlock closed his eyes and put his fingers in a prayer position under his lips.
A tray of barely eaten takeaway sat on the table next to his chair. The telly was on behind him, but all of the sounds were muffled to his ears.
When they arrived back to 221b, John shed his jacket slowly while Sherlock stood and awaited anything he might have to say.
Sherlock chuckled deeply, clasping his hands behind his back and looking at his worn out flatmate. He was about to leave when he stopped short.
“Oh, Sherlock, there you are,” she said as she approached the table. “You weren’t here this morning; is everything all right?” she asked in a whisper, leaning closer to Sherlock.
John looked up at Sherlock, ready to retort, but stopped when he saw the genuine look of concern on his face. He took a deep breath and relaxed his muscles.
“I’m sure you can, too. Now come here, I’ll pet your hair in that way you like and we’ll see how many plot holes I can find in this next film.”
John closed his eyes for a moment and breathed, trying not to dwell on the stress that had been building in his chest all night.
For the umpteenth time that night, John angrily hurled his body toward the other side of the bed, foolishly thinking that somehow facing another direction would make the horrific, jumbled mess in his head disappear.
John ran his hand along the brick wall as he walked, the rugby field just around the corner. As he grew closer, however, he could hear muffled voices, one of which was clearly Sherlock’s. John slowed his step and leaned in closer to the wall, but it didn’t take long for him to realize that the other voice belonged to Sebastian.
John went and sat stoically at the desk, resting his arms on the table. Not a moment later, his tall, lanky flatmate joined him, sitting down as quietly as he could manage.
“Sherlock, I said to leave off. Is picking a lock the only thing you know how to do tonight?” John snapped, his voice still wavering.
Now John was frowning down at his notebook page overflowing with colour-coded scribbles, looking over the information for approximately the fiftieth time. He did know the material, practically by heart at this point, but sometimes he couldn’t help but feel like if he stopped revising, everything he knew would suddenly fall right out of his head.
Of course Sherlock would text him in the middle of the day just to say that he was bored. John wouldn’t expect anything less at this point, though he didn’t think he’d want it any other way, either.
The taller man obliged, taking in John’s appearance as he sat. His eyes were tired and red, his face still pale. His hair was a bit ruffled from either tossing and turning in the bed or running his fingers through it.
John laid back on the sofa with a cold compress on his midsection and downed the last pill, setting the glass of water on the table next to him. Sherlock came around and tossed the afghan carelessly over John’s legs.
Sherlock bit his bottom lip in thought and stared at the instrument. “Well, I suppose I could play something,” he said, kneeling down to drag the case out from its hiding spot. “Not sure how familiar you are with classical, though.”
He suddenly smirks, then looks past the camera to the interviewer, also lounging in the grass. He gives her a cheeky grin.
Sherlock sat at the kitchen table, watching John cook. He wished he could pretend he had any other reason to be sitting there, but he couldn’t think of a single excuse.  John moved about the kitchen with an unexpected grace and cheeriness, sometimes humming a little tune to himself, or muttering at the pages of the recipe book he had propped against the dish drain. He was ignoring Sherlock for the most part, but in a companionable way, glancing at him occasionally, giving a little smile, nothing that would suggest he felt uncomfortable with Sherlock’s presence. John was wearing a light blue plaid shirt with no tie, the top button undone, exposing the notch at the base of his throat but no more, and a dark blue v-neck jumper over top. There was a tiny hole in the sweater’s left elbow through which Sherlock could see the lighter fabric beneath when John bent his arm. He wore dark blue denim jeans, soft with wear, a little loose but cinched tight around his narrow hips with a leather belt.  His feet were bare, and very clean.
“You okay, there?” John’s warm voice seemed to reach inside Sherlock’s chest and squeeze something deep within. He kept his eyes closed.
Reality ripped through his reverie like a knife through silk. Stupid. Stupid! It wasn’t enough that he had apparently lost control of his libido completely, now he had to wallow in sentiment too? This wasn’t about any of that, he reminded himself. The objective was data collection. And the objective of data collection was to free himself of these intrusive thoughts, this yearning, this desire. And besides, he told himself harshly, after the little show you put on just now it might all be a moot point anyway. John may be only minimally more observant than average, but he’s not a complete idiot. Sherlock had to acknowledge that it was possible that John knew exactly what he was doing outside the bathroom, and while John had proven to be remarkably tolerant of Sherlock’s various quirks on multiple occasions, surely this would be more than a bit not good. And then what? Surely he wouldn’t
He sucked the first two fingers of his left hand, while his right, slicked with lubricant, squeezed and stroked and pumped his cock. He glanced down at his aching member, the head swollen and dark with arousal, sliding through his fist, imagined John doing the same, and gasped aloud with lust. The brunette on the screen now had his hands threaded through the other man’s hair and was just… unngh, just
Of course, John probably had not been here in the living room as he watched gay porn on his laptop. No, of course he would have been in his room, door closed. Sherlock paused the video, scooped up the computer and darted up the stairs to John’s room. After all, he must be authentic. It was this attention to detail that provided him with so much of the information he utilized. John had a wooden chair in his room, but Sherlock suspected that this particular activity would have taken place in bed. He pulled the chair to the bedside and placed the computer on it, sitting on the neatly made single bed. Ever the soldier, Sherlock thought fondly. He tugged open the top drawer of the nightstand, was unsurprised to find lubricant there, grabbed the tube, snapped open the top. Pressed play.
He’d never even seen John’s shoulders, except through the soft cotton of the t-shirts he often wore in the mornings when he didn’t have somewhere to go.  Sherlock secretly loved those mornings, even though he would tell himself he was bored, tell himself he was longing for a case. John would sit in his chair, reading the paper, propping his (sock-shielded) feet up on the coffee table, sipping his mug of tea, reading bits of news to Sherlock, who would then interpret what was actually going on, beneath the bland words of the reporters. John would be skeptical, or amazed, or amused, occasionally irritated, and he would look at Sherlock with warmth and affection. Sherlock had experienced many things in his life, but never before could he recall feeling… cozy? Accepted? Cared for? Even…
Sherlock had long ago decided that sex was messy and distracting, and emotional attachment was worse, and had developed a rather effective approach toward suppressing his body’s urges. He did masturbate occasionally, when ignoring his body’s demands became more distracting than the act of release itself. But it was generally a fairly clinical affair, dictated by physical sensation rather than imagined acts of sexual desire. That day, though, was different. As he leaned against the closed door of his room, panting slightly, he gave up any pretense that this erection was going to go away on its own. Unfastening his trousers, breath catching, he couldn’t get his hand on himself fast enough.
It was about what he had expected, no better, thankfully no worse. A dark-haired man (late 20’s, cocaine habit, takes steroids, amateur boxer, waxed chest) was receiving fellatio from a young blond woman (college dropout, from a middle class background but not in contact with her family, why?, oh it must be the baby of course, multiple plastic surgeries- is that even worth noting, of course she has had, ugh stop it, this information was not essential). The man held the base of his erection in his left hand, cradled the back of the woman’s head with his right. He was standing in the middle of the room, an office set, it appeared (probably one of the tiresome secretary tropes). His thigh muscles contracted to keep his balance as he thrust into the woman’s lipstick-reddened mouth. Bad synthetic music played in the background as he murmured inanities such as “aw yeah” and “suck it like you mean it.” Like she means what? So very dull.
” Greg licks his lips and looks up to the top, where Sherlock is starting to squat. “I need to check something. His Prelim time at the gates. There is the chance . . .”
Sonya leans forward, pinning him with her eyes as she flicks her hair over her shoulder. “Now Sherlock, don’t think we’ve forgotten about you while we chatted about John’s success all this time. And I must say, I’m still swooning a bit over that story of how you two met.”
He sets his mouth in a firm line and tries to simultaneously look intimidating and invisible. Greg takes his hand back, saying “ok, then,” under his breath, and John’s shooting him a look that Sherlock refuses to meet head on. He can’t bear to see what it is. What it means.
“We could go somewhere,” John sighs. “Just the two of us, and no competitions or anything. Just, get out of this bubble for a week.” He turns to Sherlock and says the words hiding in the back of his throat. “Somewhere we can . . .” He briefly lifts their joined hands out of the water and nods down at them. “You know, somewhere we can do this. Out in the open.”
“Come here, you,” he rumbles. His rough voice hums through the sleepy silence of the room, an avalanche of warmth tumbling down across the pillows.
Love crackles across his palms, so sudden and blinding it takes Sherlock by surprise. He will never understand what made him look up that day on the slopes, what made him look off to the right where he first spotted John Watson sitting alone. He will never understand what conspiracy made it so John wanted to see him again, and again, and again.
“Thanks, but – I have to go,” I finally mutter. I can’t even shoot them a smile as I go. I whip around and start to press through the thronging mass of dancing bodies, sweat and glitter and hairspray dripping onto my jumper and skin. I can feel their stares burrowing into my back. Can see their open mouths in my mind.
Greg suppresses a grin, then wonders why he suppressed it, and swipes his own card through the door. Inside, they each grab a pair of Nordic skis and some poles, Sherlock, Greg notices, passing up at least ten pairs with a sneer of distaste before finally finding ones that are bright gold and flashy, looking the closest to new. Greg pretends to take his time over selecting his own pair, even though he knows he’s going to take the first ones he touches, and internally wars with himself over how he’ll tell Sherlock that he doesn’t just mean it to be the two of them, that he wants John there, too. And when had he ever felt so insecure over mentioning John’s name in front of Sherlock? When had doing an activity with all three of them, and not just two, felt like such an admission of guilt? Of defeat?
They seem to understand, though. Everything feels different now that it’s finally race day. Even the air feels sharper, colder somehow—vibrating the way the helicopter blades used to slice through like deadly ice right before take-off, burning against John’s skin and numbing his lips. Resonating in his bones.
Quietly, Sherlock kisses down his neck, his broad shoulders, his chest, rubbing his cheek against the soft hair, every sound and taste and touch like a brilliant spark lit off in his mind. “
Not a year later and Alma’s got married to Monroe. That’s the manager’s name, so Alma Jr. tells me. I find out from her a whole month after it happened.
I sprint down the streets after the disappearing figure ahead of me, cold air crashing through my lungs, and the wind slapping against my face, and my feet kicking up clouds of dirt and gravel on the pavement. I feel a strange emotion on my face as the freezing air slaps against my teeth, numbing my tongue. I realize with a gasp that I’m smiling.
An electric shiver ghosts down John’s spine the moment Sherlock’s warm fingertips touch his skin. He sits on the blanket in the sand with one leg bent looking out over the rolling hush of the ocean, dripping in pearls of orange and red and painted with foaming gold. He holds his breath tight in his lungs, afraid to exhale and release the moan hiding in the back of his throat, emerging from the tense pit of his chest.
John swallows hard. He can’t blink. Sherlock’s eyes are the clear open sky, pouring out emotion and looking like they’ve never spoken a higher truth in his life. John clears his throat and nods, covering Sherlock’s hand with his. They gaze at each other, the moment quickly turning heavy, tumbling towards words that both of them have prepped on the tips of their tongues. Then John sees something out of the corner of his eye.
With a heaving sigh John walks him back him into the counter and licks into his mouth. He pants harshly through his nose, pressing himself along the entire front of Sherlock’s warm skin while Sherlock’s huge hands hold and grip and consume him.
He crosses his arms, as if he’s made the point that will end all discussion, and John rolls his eyes. “He’s just going to get like this if we talk right now. He’s not in the mood for a normal discussion.”
His knee buckles, and he sinks to the bench with a thud, dropping his crutch to the floor. He licks his lips with a numb, sluggish tongue in disbelief. Lips which Sherlock had kissed in front of fifty cameras, thousands of eyes.
Sherlock was aroused, there was no denying it, he could feel his cock hardening uncomfortably against the tight fabric of his trousers, and his hands were trembling, and his stomach clenched in a desperate coil of
Unbidden images filled his mind. John stroking himself into the stream of water, cock sopping wet, little squirts of water shooting from his fist as he pumped himself.
that was it. He almost whimpered with relief as his hand slid slickly down the length of his cock, pulling from the head to the root, in time with John’s ragged breath, and the wet jerking sound of John’s hand working his cock. Oh god, John was moaning now, grunting a little with each stroke; Sherlock panted as he jerked himself roughly, feeling the heat pooling in his bollocks, and then exploding through him as he ejaculated hot spatters of semen onto the bathroom door.
) were locked in a reasonable facsimile of a passionate embrace, in what appeared to be a locker room. One was shirtless, the other wore a football jersey. Visible erections strained through the fabric of their shorts. The blond one roughly pushed the dark-haired man away from him.
“We can’t do this,” he rasped, breathing heavily. “Not now. Not here.” The dark haired man smiled lasciviously. He grasped his erection through the fabric, and moaned softly.
After a stunned moment, Sherlock slid down his door to the floor with a thud, and tried to calm his panting respirations. My god, what had gotten into him? His face flushed as he thought back on what had just occurred. How could he have lost control like that? And thinking of his flatmate… well, really, his friend (it still didn’t quite feel right), his…John, just… ugh! Damn. This was not good. Even now, spent as he was, he could still feel a curling warmth of arousal up through his core when he thought of John. No, this would not do. He would stop this in its tracks. No one had greater self-control than he, it was all just transport anyway, a tool for him to hone and utilize as his mind saw fit. He would master his body’s desires, just as he had so many times before.
Sherlock told himself firmly. That line of thought was unhelpful, and deeply frustrating, not only for its powerfully erotic imagery, but also for its imprecision. He had never
Only to see Mrs. Hudson, standing in the kitchen, with a tea kettle in her hand, which she nearly dropped with the strength of the double-take she performed upon seeing Sherlock enter the room.
Sherlock glanced at the browser history again. Apparently John hadn’t thought much more of this scene than he- he had only watched for under five minutes. Or else he had found it so compelling that he had been brought to climax that quickly. No, the next several websites were all pornographic as well. Sherlock clicked on the next- another man penetrating another woman, this time vaginally, at an improbable angle that was probably more for the benefit of the camera than because it was particularly pleasurable for anyone involved. Sherlock thought about the cameraman, the sound crew, the director. At least, he supposed these things had directors. How many people must have been watching this man and woman have intercourse? It all seemed exceedingly sordid and rather sad.
when Sherlock had left his room that day. And as much as he hated to admit it, Sherlock had no idea when John had come downstairs, or how much noise he himself had made as he brought himself so frantically to climax. He had tried to revisit the experience in his memory to see if he could retrieve the sound of creaking footsteps, or determine the volume of his own humiliating vocalizations, but such attempts only left him feeling frustrated and aroused and he quickly abandoned them. No good was to be had from adding fuel to
Sherlock laughed out loud with relief. How had he been such an idiot? It was obvious. The reason why he had become so fixated on John’s physical form and sexuality was simply that his mind had not been permitted to gather sufficient data. As with any problem, his profound and restless intellect could not let go until the unknowns were known, the uncertainties certain. By trying to prevent himself from considering the topic at hand (he cringed slightly at the unintended and rather coarse pun, then rallied), by preventing himself from considering the topic currently preoccupying him, he had actually caused himself greater distress. The solution, of course, was simple. He needed to collect more data. It was not enough to simply hear John pleasure himself, he needed to
What was going through John’s mind as he watched this? Sherlock felt completely flummoxed. Could John have just been watching this out of curiosity? It seemed unlikely, as the previous several clips had been very much standard fare, heterosexual pornography, reflecting a desire for sexual stimulation rather than a purely intellectual exploration. No, despite his shock and disbelief, Sherlock had to conclude that John had settled on gay porn to secure his sexual release. Sherlock could feel his heart racing, hands trembling. He felt almost nauseous, with what? Shock? Adrenaline? Hope, even?
Sorry this was so long in (ahem) coming! Life has been crazy, but I will not leave you (or John and Sherlock) hanging forever! It has certainly gotten bigger than my original plan of three chapters, so I can't quite say how many more there will be, but I have the end in sight. Happy reading!
“Sherlock?” he heard John’s voice from the other side. “Sherlock, you in there?” Sherlock shook himself, and attempted to ignore the instant elevation of his pulse at John’s voice.
Sherlock couldn’t stop staring at John’s feet, so exposed, on the cold grey tile of the kitchen floor. Sherlock thought of chemicals spilled, bloodstains, broken glass. John stood on his toes to reach for a jar of tomatoes on an upper shelf. Sherlock could see the soles of his feet, the arches. A part of John he had never seen before. Just… flaunted, as if it were nothing. He noticed his pulse quicken a little, and he felt a bit dizzy.
He felt that strange combination of superiority and emptiness that such things usually produced in him, gratified that he was above all that, while feeling impossibly distant from others of his kind who took pleasure in so many things that he did not. He shook himself, dove back in. John hadn’t stayed on the last one for more than a few minutes either. Next up, a woman on her hands and knees, being penetrated vaginally from the back by one man, while performing fellatio on another man who knelt before her. The bad music couldn’t quite mask the rhythmic squelching sound. He shuddered slightly, then moved on, as John had too, apparently. Why had John had such trouble maintaining interest? Or was that just how men did this? Like flipping channels on the telly when nothing “good” was on. Or maybe John, too, felt the awfulness of the whole endeavor.
Thus admonished, he crept up the remaining stairs, drawn to John like iron filings to a magnet, desperate to see, to know,
.”  The blond glanced quickly about before hurling himself back into the arms of the other, and stripping him of his jersey so that both men’s chests were bare. The blond pressed his groin against the other man’s and rutted against him, panting and moaning.
The blond moaned, baring his throat as his lover (no, not his lover, of course, the other actor) held him close with a muscled arm wrapped around his lower back, taking his mouth with an aggressive kiss.
He gasped softly, involuntarily, and froze, but there was no interruption in the rhythmic sounds from John’s room. He pressed his palm against the bulge in his pants, willing it to subside, but the pressure of his hand felt good, too good, and it wasn’t helping, so he yanked it away.
But, John isn’t yelling. His jaw isn’t tight, nor is his face red. His fists aren’t even clenched. In fact, Greg’s never seen John look less furious in his life.
Sherlock frowns. He knows this. Of course, he knows this. Anyone who saw John Watson’s face when he’d looked down that night in the shower and seen Sherlock’s hard cock brushing up against his would realize that he’d never gotten to be with a man before. He opens his mouth to say this and then shuts it immediately again. He realizes John looks nervous. Scared that this will somehow make Sherlock step back from him and say “you know, actually, I’ve changed my mind since you clearly don’t know what the hell to do if another man’s penis is involved.”
On the one hand, he feels freer than he ever has in his life. He can be around Greg, he can be close to him, and he doesn’t have to worry about revealing anything – about standing too close or touching him for too long or letting his eyes stay and linger.
feels different. His hips are softer, and his jaw has lost some of its razor sharp edge underneath my fingertips, and, most of all, I could feel the tiny swell of his belly rubbing against mine, an alien fullness where it was once flat and hard. It felt magnificent, intoxicating.
Slowly, as a unit, the rest of the team stands up to follow him out. Their colleague is alive, and their shifts are over. It’s time to head home to prepare for tomorrow – a brand new day of rescues against danger.
With a sharp nod he walks back towards the announcers, zigzagging through the sea of lounging crowds and beach towels. He stand stiffly beside the two guys he recognizes from last year and shoves his hands in his pockets.
I think I might evaporate up into the clouds. It ain’t real, none of this is real, Sherlock Holmes standing on a porch in Signal talking plain as day to my little girl. My little girl all grown and married with her own little girl startin’ to make a fuss inside.
“Oh, John,” he says again, and something inside of me finally shatters and breaks loose. There’s desire in his voice. Fascination and awe and something a lot like lust. A voice I haven’t heard in anyone since I was twenty-two. A voice I’ve never heard a man use.
And the next morning he’d sat on his bed staring at the wall after not sleeping a wink, and at six o’clock on the dot he’d heard Greg banging on his door saying, “Come on, you lazy asshole, I’ve been waiting for you down on the beach for twenty minutes!”
“No, that would be stupid. I did that so that I could give you a good luck blow job. There’s a critical difference.”
Sherlock frowns. Then Greg himself frowns. They both seem to share the simultaneous thought that, under normal circumstances, no matter how stressful or elite the impending Final, Greg would have purposefully said ‘more fast’ instead of ‘faster’ just to egg Sherlock on, to pull him out of his head filled with velocity and angels and snow texture and remind him to breathe again, that he’s human and capable of experiencing emotions other than sheer focus.
I couldn’t help myself, the sight was intoxicating. I whispered forbidden words to him: “you’re so heavy, love. Look at your tight, low belly bounce as you ride me. Look at you, you gorgeous man. Look at how huge you are, how stretched you are for me. Gorgeous, babe,
But instead of any of these things, Sherlock lies there, naked in the middle of the room. And he has the distinct, horrifying thought that he now understands, on however small a scale, exactly what John Watson’s body feels like in the moments before he has to text
The first time was to see John standing like a ghost in the dark, leaning on his crutches and staring out the window, the starlight illuminating the lines of his face.
It’s absolutely nothing like surfing with Greg – all soft comfort and warmth pooling in the pit of his gut and spreading out through the tips of his fingers, smiling across the spray and whooping together for joy.
The wind rushes against his face and stomach as he drops in and feels his muscles take over. He follows in John’s wake as he snaps off the top and then does a quick cross step so he can hang five. Sherlock knows he’s showing off on purpose, trying to snap Sherlock out of his own mind and goad him into a competition of friendly fire. But Sherlock can’t get his limbs to move. He feels himself soar across the face of the wave and closes his eyes. Feels the droplets of spray splash against his cheek, his eyelids. Feels the solid, comforting weight of the earth beneath his feet. When he opens his eyes he nearly gasps. He sees John Watson before him, hanging five and looking like a smug bastard, outlined against the stunning Laguna beach mountains and a clear, open sky. For the first time in his life since he ever picked up a magazine advertisement, he sees something in the waves besides muscle and adrenaline and physics.
You see, the two little lines on a pregnancy test are so small, so faint. They could be figments of your imagination, or ghosts of almost-pregnancies past, or a little piece of glitter that spilled in the pregnancy test factory and has been characteristically clinging to its chosen surface until pried off with considerable force. It could be any number of thousands of things. But for some reason, even to the world’s greatest consulting detective and his brilliant, luminous doctor assistant (I’m giggling as I write this and getting an undeserved stink eye from His-self), those two little lines simply could not mean
Scotty stops walking once John notices him and stands there waiting, eyes squinting hard against the harsh sun. John still can’t even believe what he’s seeing. For a terrifying moment he thinks he must have heat stroke and is seeing a mirage. Because there is absolutely no fucking way that not even twelve hours after thoroughly chewing him out (and being chewed out) on the moonlit sand, and being explicitly told to stay the hell away, that Scotty Holmes has donned a suit, found out where John works, and come here to --- what? Humiliate him some more? Gloat? Tell him that all of yesterday was really just a lucid dream - that John was slipped some mushrooms or some shit by a co-conspirator and never actually made pro in the first place?
to proclaim John’s brilliance to the entire world, and he’d spent it pitying himself over an over the top display of woke rainbow acceptance.
John turns, startled, as a familiar body accompanies the familiar voice, bear hugging him without warning and causing him to drop his bag.
Johnny practically leaps back from the friend – Greg – as Greg smiles and calls back an answer to the friend inside the bar. Johnny’s not smiling. He shoves his hands down into his pockets and flinches as Greg claps a hand down on his shoulder in some sort of apology. No doubt some sort of “finish this talk another time” nonsense while he nods towards the pool table. Sherlock watches Johnny resolutely stare down at the sand as Greg walks back into the bar, still softly shaking his head ‘no’ in response to Greg’s probable offer to join as if he was still there to see his reaction.
He’s long lost track of time. The faces of coaches along the sidelines have blurred into the background, melding with the trees and fencing and snow. He can’t see the competitor up ahead anymore, lost to the twists and turns of the looping course, and he can’t even hear the hiss and slide of skis from his competitor behind him.
Sherlock waits as John gathers his thoughts, watching the purple ocean roll by out the window, framed by golden palm fronds and liquid pools of glittering sand. The wind through the open windows winds gently through his hair, and Sherlock wants more than anything to feel those locks of salt-dried hair rustling against his cheek.
“John,” he says again. “If I – if we meet in the World. If I agree to that. Will you promise me this won’t be your last Visit?”
John can feel Sherlock’s answering grin in the air, brushing softly against the skin on his quivering lower back. “Never hurts to ask,” he says lightly. John’s just about to shoot back a retort when suddenly the words die on his tongue, pushed out with a rushing moan as Sherlock spits loudly against his hole and then presses his mouth against him in one slow, open-mouthed kiss.
I tell ‘em a story ‘bout Scott instead, real quick and vague. It gets Francine’s eyes all wide and starry thinkin’ bout the magic of racing on a horse through a fancy stadium, same way my eyes probably looked when I was her age hearing bout the wild wild West for the first time. Alma gets up and leaves for the bathroom when I’m halfway through.
Another shocked gasp rips through the grandstands, and one of the coaches behind Greg curses under his breath. Surprised cheers burst from one section of the crowd, Norwegian flags filling the sky as the fans go wild for their country’s Silver.
There’s a pause. Greg tries not to squint in the bright lights and wonders what his coach is going to say. Probably talk about World’s, and the Alpine Cup, maybe something trivial that sounds interesting about trying out a new style of ski, the new Olympic regulations surrounding ski length, etc.
And John doesn’t care if it’s the fucking time trials in the Paralympics that nobody could care less about. He doesn’t care if he could miss every target at this point and still qualify, or ski the rest of the course with his eyes closed.
John’s hand clenches so hard around the grip of the crutch that his knuckles turn white. A cold bead of sweat drips down Greg’s side under his old Sochi Team France t-shirt with the hole in the sleeve. He wonders if he stood up and did jumping jacks right now if John and Sherlock would even realize he’s still in the room. Then he remembers that he can’t really stand up and do jumping jacks without his knee screaming murder on the plane in three hours. So he guesses he’ll never know.
” Greg starts, and he sounds so serious, so suddenly somber, that Sherlock and John both turn to look at him.
“I’m not gonna be able to fall asleep any time soon,” John says once they’ve finished. The sun is starting to set over the ocean horizon before them.
Sherlock looks up at the sky and sighs. His eyes look wet, and he sounds exhausted. “John, it’s not some disease that’s got hold of your brain. Not gonna rot you from the insides.” He looks straight at me. “Look, all I’m sayin’ is, we could be happy. Ain’t no reason it can’t be like this. People divorce, people move to new places, people –“
John’s eyebrow quirks, and Sherlock’s heart soars. “Show you?” John says, sounding dangerous and prickly, sharp, ready to explode. “Show you? I’ll fucking show you . . .”
Christ, I missed his laugh. I realized while we sat there cracking up and looking out over the water that we hadn’t really laughed together in a long time. There’d been smiles, and happy tears, and excitement, but not really laughter. Probably because every time I wanted to laugh, to throw out a joke or egg him on until his humor came out, I’d remember him crumpled on the floor that first night in tears, and suddenly I couldn’t bring myself to laugh anymore.
“Jesus Christ,” John groans, pulling once at his hair with balled fists. “I knew today was a terrible idea. Going on air with you.”
Sonya fake-laughs at Sherlock’s dead-pan joke before effortlessly segueing, “Well, let’s remember that wonderful Vancouver podium!”
A small chorus of girly, high-pitched voices echo the words “Scotty Holmes” after Kip speaks, causing another round of laughter.
John stands dumbly in the middle of the bustling chaos of the Olympic Village, holding tight to the strap of the bag over his shoulder and trying his best to look casually invisible. He steals periodic glances behind him at where Sherlock and Greg have already been pulled aside by the France24 team for an on-the-spot interview, hoping he just looks like a random athlete taking in the sights and not a star-struck stalker hoping for another autograph.
“Greg and I found this place last year,” John says as he parks in the dirt alongside the road, looking over the bluffs leading down to the shore. “Usually empty this time of day, but great surf.”
John swallows hard, and his heart starts to pound at the thought that the buzzer will go off for his race in less than three hours.
Lahela squeezes his hand, and her eyes see straight through his skin. “You surf like were born out there in the water,” she says. Her eyes are focused and grave. “A true master of
whether the strange nurse’s hands on John’s body were too cold? Imagining how John would be closing his eyes, trying to breathe through it, steady and brave, all alone lying flat on his back on an exam table?
The last thing Sherlock and Greg need now is John texting them like a lonely orphan, unable to occupy himself for just a few bloody hours in the middle of the Olympics.
Those moments hurt him too. Maybe even more than they hurt me. You must understand that. We was a part of each other before we even realized it had happened. It was hard to breathe when we were apart. Literally. Physically. It was damn hard to beathe.
“Fuck,” he whispers, unrecognizable to himself. He reaches down and slides his wet fingers between Greg’s open legs, wondering when exactly Greg managed to reach down and remove his pants. “Fuck,” he says again, straight into Greg’s mouth, panting, Greg’s hand guiding him lower, right to the heat of him. “Fuck.”
Sherlock had taken his time to slowly kneel behind him, waiting for John to strip off his shirt after John had looked into his eyes and said the first words he could manage to speak once the image of Sherlock’s hands on his bare skin had emblazoned itself onto his mind, halting his thoughts.
But he does know one thing, that nine-year-old. He knows the exact details of a nightly dream, permanently burned into his imagination, sketched in the margins of his homework assignments before he becomes a teenager and shuns the very notion of public accolades: it is himself, older, standing on top of an Olympic podium, an entire stadium riveted to his face. Gold.
I feel his sad smile in my hair as he pulls me closer to himself. His voice vibrates down into my chest.
Seriously, I cannot BELIEVE how much excited squee this fic (and the show!) has gotten, and it is all thanks to all of you being wonderful humans! Thanks for joining me on this side-tracked rabbit-hole of a fic :) While I have no immediate plans to keep writing in this universe, I wouldn't put a sequel too far out of the question. I think I'll miss the Air Zermatt team too much to say goodbye for good.
He can still feel the ghosts of John’s hands on his skin, clutching at his back and burying his face into his neck, letting the stubble on his cheek rasp against Sherlock’s collarbone, being willingly held in his arms for the entire ocean to see. And then Sherlock had looked at John in the soft, grey morning light and burned up with desperation at the need for John to know that
“Six,” Sherlock continued, trying to ignore the fact that he knew Lestrade was peeking around the door frame, watching them.
John tried to walk further, but didn’t get very far before his knees buckled and he landed with a weak thud on the grass.
He set his phone down and stupidly waited to see if Sherlock would call right back, but there was nothing. He nodded curtly to himself and figured he may as well eat now, but upon opening up his food, realized he wasn’t quite so hungry anymore.
“This is ridiculous!” John shouted as he sprinted behind the detective. Somehow the cabbie was still a good few meters ahead of them, and Sherlock wasn’t about to stop any time soon.
He closed the book and set is aside before deciding to get up and attempt to communicate with Sherlock again, if only to give himself something to do.
It was only after Sherlock had successfully apprehended the suspect had he realized with a sharp sting of panic that not only was John not with him, but that he hadn’t been trailing behind him for the last few minutes of the chase, either.
Sherlock went uncharacteristically quiet for a moment before sighing dejectedly. “They’re your friends, John.”
“You’re all a bunch of pricks, you know that?” he ground out before walking out and slamming the door behind him.
“Oh, and, um…” Sherlock trailed off as he crossed the room and began rooting around under the sofa cushions. He retrieved a small gift bag and handed it to John. “For you, as well.”
“And you’re not a freak,” John insisted. He uncurled from his position and began tidying up their dirtied utensils and empty takeaway containers. “Come on, let’s get all this cleaned up and then we can watch crime shows while you point out all the mistakes, yeah?”
“I would too, Jesus,” John gaped, reading a bit more. “So that’s why he came to you? And you—how d’you suppose it’s possible? If it even is.”
The rest is a little bit blurry but it was clear by your eagerness to help, your knowledge on how to handle the situation, and your calm bedside manner that you were either a university student with a martyr complex or someone studying medicine. Or both,” Sherlock finished, picking up his pen again and immediately getting back to work.
John watched as the expression on Sherlock’s face slowly morphed from anger to confusion. His eyes fell to the floor and his mouth hung slightly open as he searched for something to say. The aching silence stretched on, and after another few moments that felt like years, John couldn’t take it anymore.
“You’re right; dealing with your sister always proves to be a taxing experience.” Sherlock smiled, and John let out a quick chuckle.
“Mm. Got shot. In the shoulder. Almost bled out on top of a patient I was working on. Nasty business. Why am I telling you this? I can’t even talk to my therapist about anything.”
John leaned up and kissed him on the jaw. He wrapped the blanket around Greg’s shoulders as well and snuggled in closer, thankful for the time to get his breath back.
Seeing that Sherlock had no intention of slowing down at any point, John let out an exasperated huff and sped up to close the remaining distance between them.
Sherlock rolled his eyes but obliged nonetheless, carefully unwrapping his gift. He slowly opened up the box and pulled out a soft, navy blue scarf.
“Damn it,” Sherlock cursed as he rushed into the kitchen. He dug out the hot water bottle and turned on the tap, thumping his foot impatiently as he waited for the water to get warm. Not even seconds later, he heard the tell-tale soft tapping of Hamish’s footsteps coming into the kitchen.
They swayed back and forth, beautifully lost in the sea of people, and John thought back to the night he first met Sherlock, on the very same dance floor, and how much his life had changed since then. He had resigned himself to a life at university filled with nothing but his studies and his small group of friends, never imagining he’d be comfortable enough with himself let alone another person to ever be a part of something that meant so much.
John headed towards his usual table near the back and noticed someone already sitting there. As he walked closer, John immediately recognized the head of dark curls practically buried in a book, one hand holding the book open and one hand furiously scribbling down notes.
“For me, yes. You were the one who talked me through the biology report that you haven’t actually written yet.”
“Then I asked Mycroft to wear it but he said he was ‘busy.’ That’s his favourite word.” Sherlock pouted. “You’re not allowed to be busy. I’ll ask Mycroft to pass a law; he wants to be in the government and all. Then it’ll be against the law for you to be busy or get sick and it won’t happen again and we can play pirates forever,” he said cheerily.
“John!” Sherlock yelled. “It’s in my eyes!” he complained, shutting his eyes tightly and rubbing frantically at them.
“You’re warm,” Sherlock reasoned, wrapping his hand weakly around John’s arm as if trying to hold him there.
“Why do you do this, John?” Sherlock couldn’t help it; he had to ask. He knew it wasn’t the best time, but he just couldn’t let the thoughts buzz around in his head anymore.
The pain had subsided enough for him to be able to take off his jacket, albeit slowly, and to talk without every other word being an expletive, though Sherlock did have to pull off his shoes for him which had been a tiny bit humiliating.
Upon entering, he found John to be sprawled dramatically across his ruffled sheets, still donning his jacket and shoes.
Sherlock held his arms out invitingly and John cuddled in close, pulling their blanket back up over them. He’d never imagined that one day it would be Sherlock telling him not to overwork himself, but the man was right; he wasn’t going to be able to focus on his work if he didn’t find time to relax.
it. Can you imagine a five year old holding up a fake police badge and trying to tell a dog he’d just committed theft?”
"Yeah uhm, I'll do that." John murmured quietly as he shuffled out of the kitchen. He kept his gaze on the floor and tried to keep his balance as he walked out. For the first time since he'd moved in, John had to use the railing on the stairs to get up to his room.
The doctor nodded and licked his lips. “Look,” he said tiredly, “I’ve just been, out of sorts, lately, okay? I had that spot of a cold that night with Lestrade, and I haven’t been sleeping—“
John watched Sherlock step in, clad in his tartan dressing gown. John always loved the way that one looked on him.
“You know, I don't really think I'm very hungry anymore. Excuse me,” John said, eerily calm. He picked himself up and didn’t even bother glancing at Sherlock as he left the table.
been looking forward to their night together, and he knew that their schedules likely wouldn’t free up again anytime soon, but it wasn’t John’s fault.
For John, the worst part of having nightmares wasn’t the nightmare itself, it was the moments that followed after waking up from one. The sheer panic that filled his chest, the heavy breathing that he felt he couldn’t control, the lingering feeling of paranoia, it was all too much.
“Ooh, s’Johnny’s turn!” Tom slurred. When Tom started calling him ‘Johnny’ he was definitely past coherent thought at that point.
“John, wait, no—“ Sherlock tried calling out, but it was obvious that John was not going to listen. He looked to be on his way to the loo as opposed to simply walking out of the restaurant, though, which Sherlock supposed was preferable.
“Because you’re bleeding all over and it’s not sanitary, that’s why,” John snapped, leading him to the loo which was thankfully just a few steps away.
“Yeah, no.” John grasped Sherlock’s elbow to help him balance. “I’ll help you to a cab, or did you drive here?”
John’s back hit the hardwood with a resounding thud and before he even had time to yell or curse, Greg and Mike were at him as well, clawing at his shirt and fumbling to get it off him. He could vaguely hear Sherlock yelling something angrily over their roars of laughter and knew he would be trying to stop them but damn it, Tom was strong.
John’s mum had said that John needed the sleep so he could feel better again, but Sherlock knew loads more ways to make John feel better than this silly bed rest thing.
Sherlock’s phone suddenly buzzed on the table and he let out a long, exasperated sigh upon looking at the screen.
Just when it seemed that Sherlock was finished properly tucking John in, his fingers stopped on the scarf, shaking ever so slightly in quiet uncertainty. Sherlock looked up at John, a question in his eyes that John could tell he didn’t quite know how to ask, but John answered it for him by wrapping his fingers around Sherlock’s lapels and slowly pulling him in close.
“Sherlock, the heat is helping, okay?" His voice still sounded a little rough, but definitely a lot less strained. "I can try and get an appointment tomorrow to make sure there’s no serious damage, but for now I just need to rest for a bit.”
“Sherlock!” John bellowed. His voice was rough with exhaustion but he couldn’t let Sherlock be without backup to try to take down a man who was known to be far too good with a knife.
staring at me. I’m not blind nor am I stupid. I don’t know what you’re trying to achieve by your longing glances but—“
He knew that the recent lack of casework was likely to blame for this sudden slew of nightly terrors. He knew it wasn’t healthy, but the rush of adrenaline and the thrill of the chase were what filled his veins with excitement and gave him purpose. And too much domesticity allowed for his mind to wander, to go down paths that he would rather not revisit. Or worse, to make new paths, ones which lead to dangers that neither he nor Sherlock made it back from; his body’s twisted way of saying that it’s
The cab driver took one look up and decided to make a run for it. He dashed into the nearby alley and Sherlock and John didn’t hesitate to go right after him.
When Sherlock looked up at John he noticed that he still looked exhausted. An idea came into his head, and he quickly snapped the folder shut and went downstairs to Mrs. Hudson.
Sherlock helped get a shower ready for John and knocked on the bathroom door every few minutes to make sure he was okay. And at around ten o’clock, John went off to bed, leaving Sherlock with an unresolved feeling churning in the pit of his stomach.
When John opened his eyes, he felt heavy, cloudy, and more than a little confused. He looked at the white walls surrounding him, the stiff blanket tucked around him, the heart monitor beeping steadily to his right. Hospital, then.
Sherlock could hear Lestrade’s exasperated footsteps slowly ascending the stairs, so he made his observations quick.
Later that night, John lie in bed, staring up at the ceiling after waking from a particularly vivid nightmare. He hoped that he hadn’t been screaming out loud, but he assumed that he must have been making at least some level of noise going by the slight soreness of his throat.
As Sherlock’s song wore on, John’s eyelids began to drop. He knew that there was some reason he hadn’t wanted to go to sleep, but he was so tired, and the music was so lovely, like a lullaby, and closing his eyes just felt so good, he couldn’t seem to stop himself.
“John,” Sherlock practically whispered, but John didn’t want to hear him right now. He didn’t want to hear the pity or the platitudes or the apologies; he just wanted to leave.
He hadn’t been able to stop thinking about his fight with John. They hardly ever argued, but they could both be incredibly hotheaded, so it was never a pretty sight when they did. And it wasn’t just the fighting; Sherlock was worried about John. He didn’t want to watch his boyfriend collapse from exhaustion in front of him ever again.
John shook his head fondly at his phone. He looked at the clock to his right and saw the late hour, feeling like he really ought to try to go to sleep now if he was going to get up early the next morning.
After Sherlock had cleaned off his face and downed a few painkillers, John made sure that he sat down with a bag of frozen peas on his cheek at least until the swelling went down. It was a good hour or so before they finally left for the café, having to stop off at Sherlock’s flat so that he could change out of his bloodied shirt and mud-stained trousers.
“Hah, yeah. I mean it, though, Greg. I don’t think anyone’s helped me through one like that before.”
John’s feet felt like they were made of lead as he trudged up the beloved and worn steps of 221B. His head felt heavy as well, like a grey sky full of dark clouds, full to the brim and ready to pour and yet not even a drizzle escaped from their grasp.
As soon as he sat down on the plush, warm blankets, John could feel the weight of the day practically melting off of him. He couldn’t help but feel a little silly, though, like he was attending some sort of slumber party similar to the ones that his sister would have when they were younger. But John set aside his slight embarrassment for now and wriggled himself back into the pillows in an attempt to get as comfortable as possible. Sherlock had put this all together for him, had put off his own obligations for the night, and so he was going to try to enjoy every minute of it.
John sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. “So what did you learn from the therapist, then? Is our client really a clairvoyant or a proper nutter?”
It had been over a month since they’d last been intimate with each other, which at first was due to a seemingly never ending stream of casework and experiments, but the busier Sherlock had gotten, the less interested he seemed in any carnal part of their relationship. It was a distraction, he’d say, which over time had caused to John to be more and more cautious about touching him.
Sherlock stopped, making a point to loudly stomp his shoes onto the pavement as he turned back to face John.
“Okay, stay where you are. I don’t think Andrews is going anywhere and Lestrade will be here any minute. I’m on my way.”
“This isn’t the first time John’s had a panic attack. At first he tried to hide them from me, and we all know that was a pipe dream. Then I showed him a trick my mother used to use when she needed to calm down. Worked like a charm, and I’ve been helping him ever since.”
“And this, too.” Sherlock said as explanation as he tossed the blanket over John’s legs. “To keep you warm, I mean.”
“I almost thought you wouldn’t come, actually. Greg was pretty surprised to see you here, too,” John told him.
“Well, there's the obvious fact that you opted to sleep on the sofa last night as opposed to our bed, for one. Then this morning, you waited until I got into the shower to eat breakfast, then you waited until I went into my room before
“And look, everything’s still safe and sound,” John said, gesturing to Sherlock’s things all still in their place.
“Sherlock,” the doctor scolded. “Y’know, I reckon you wouldn’t be too happy if your eyes suddenly decided to play tricks on you, to deceive you.”
John was just beginning to contemplate the shape of the gum stuck to the back of one of the chairs when he felt his phone buzz in his pocket. He furrowed his brow in confusion, wondering who would be texting him considering his friends all knew he was in class.
I smile breathlessly, flowing through my lungs with a whoosh. I laugh once, big and hold. “You have a point.”
Greg’s voiceover: “We are all affected of course, and me even especially, since I have my own kids. Same as the other guys at the company with kids. But my job is not down there in the snow, trying to save them. My job is to transport the people who can – to fly the helicopter as quickly and safely as possible, and then, once I have dropped off the paramedics, it is out of my hands. Once I learned to do that, to understand my duty, it all became a lot easier. I focus on the flying, and I deliver the equipment and the crew. That is my best job.”
“I can’t,” John argued. He could no longer take a full breath without his insides feeling like they were quivering.
“No, wait!” John quickly covered up the tattoo with one hand and gently pushed Sherlock away with the other.
“Greg,” John interrupted, the nervousness in his chest getting exponentially worse. How could he have ever thought that he could hide this?
John grit his teeth and held onto the arm of his chair with a death grip, not looking Sherlock in the eye.
“I saw him put the pill in his mouth, but I think that’s all he did. He didn’t swallow it. I noticed that and I was about to spit mine out but then he shoved his hand over my mouth and forced my head back until I
The sun had gone down outside Baker Street, and Sherlock was sat on his bed in his dimly lit room, in the middle of his traditional read-through of John’s most recent blog post. They had finished the case earlier in the day and, despite John having gotten into a nasty brawl with the murderer and taking quite the blow to his shoulder, he’d still pushed through and typed up his blog.
Once he was clean and dry and tucked under the duvet, John opened up his phone to see a new message from Sherlock.
It was a few more minutes before Sherlock returned, book in hand. He set it down victoriously atop his notes and returned to his seat.
Mumbling a quick goodnight to Sherlock, John headed up to his room and flopped onto his bed, belatedly remembering to kick off his shoes. He was practically asleep before his shoes hit the floor.
The doctor snorted in laughter. “No, obviously,” he said a bit mockingly, “look, I’m just not feeling well, alright? It’s the start of a bug, I’m sure. I just don’t need your concern. I’m a—“
John looked to the piece of paper in front of him and stared blankly at it for a moment, his mouth hanging open in quiet disbelief.
Sherlock’s family home was cozy and warm. Sherlock’s mother had tea waiting for them when they arrived, and Sherlock and John gave her the birthday presents they’d picked up for her along the way after John found out that Sherlock hadn’t gotten her anything.
John woke with a start, a breath trapped in his lungs. He sat straight up in his bed and gasped for air until he finally felt the breath return to his chest.
Through half-closed eyes, he saw the fuzzy silhouette of Sherlock swaying softly by the window as he played his violin. John smiled sleepily, thinking perhaps he was still dreaming. Comforted by his hazy thoughts and entranced by the beautiful music, it wasn’t long before John slipped into a blissfully dreamless sleep.
“As I said before, I assumed that you needed the break. And if I’d asked you beforehand, you would have refused to come, then would have continued to overwork yourself and would have been incredibly irritable when I got back.”
The driver must have panicked, because he took that moment to turn and run the opposite way, right towards Sherlock. The man, however, didn’t get to run even halfway there before he was shot with undeniable precision right behind his knee. He fell like a ton of bricks and John wasted no time. He hurried over and immediately whacked the man on the back of the head with the pistol, knocking him out on contact.
The next morning, John found Sherlock sitting at the table in the breakfast nook, engrossed in a botany encyclopedia and completely oblivious to the world around him. He wore his red and green tartan dressing gown and his hair was slightly tousled. John resisted the strange urge to brush the stray hair away from his face and instead set a granola bar down in front of Sherlock.
“I think I’ve taken a liking to it, actually. Keeps me busy,” he said. “Earl Grey or English Breakfast?”
The waiting room in the therapist’s office, with its monochrome colour scheme, fake plants and sad paintings, was beginning to hash up old memories for John. He sat stiffly in one of the chairs, across from Sherlock who was most likely pretending to read a magazine but was actually in his mind palace.
“Attempt to survive my family as they bombard me with innumerable invasive questions and mind-numbing chitchat, mostly.”
“Mostly your upper body, like your shoulders and head. You’re a tad fuzzy and, I dunno, things just aren’t as bright as they used to be.”
John turned his head to look at the angry red numbers on his alarm clock, the reminder that he should be asleep burning into his vision.
He was just beginning to resign himself to a prolonged period of wait before Sherlock inevitably showed up when he heard faint voices from outside the heavy metal door.
Sherlock gave a noncommittal hum of approval, likely already absorbed in the movie in his quest to find its mistakes.
Once he felt that he could gather his thoughts for more than a few seconds, he realized that most of his face had landed on a cluster of rocks, and it was likely the cause of the pain radiating through his jaw and head.
“Well, it’s not really very festive, being the family disappointment, though I do enjoy the mince pies.”
Another minute or two had passed before John realized that Sherlock hadn’t actually responded. He checked his phone again just to be sure, but there was nothing.
Sherlock looked to John enthusiastically, but the look on John’s face was a combination of confusion, disbelief and absolute horror. For a moment, neither of them said anything. John’s mouth hung open a bit before he licked his lips in thought.
“What?” Sherlock turned to him, a sudden look of uncertainty on his face. “Oh, um, no, I—“ he stammered, clearing his throat awkwardly. “You could stay, if you like.”
His eyes brimming with tears of happiness that he didn’t think he’d find, John wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s neck and pulled him down for a kiss.
“No need to apologize,” Sherlock said. He gently took John’s hand and placed it back on the towel, picking up where he left off.
“Damn it!” He shouted to no one. It had been two days, and the fingerprints had ended up being inconclusive. There had been two sets of fingerprints; one obviously from John and one from someone else, but there wasn’t enough information, and he couldn’t get a name for the mystery person.
Sherlock grabbed his coat and scarf while John stared with his fist still clenched and lips still quivering uncontrollably.
Sherlock looked back and forth between John and his belongings for a moment before pouting much like a small child. “I’ll be right back,” he grumbled.
The doctor ignored him for a moment in favour of pouring his juice, and ended up missing the glass a bit, spilling the liquid onto the table.
“It reminds me that I need help, sometimes,” John went on. “That I can’t always do everything on my own.”
The corner of John’s mouth quirked up in a small grin. He got up out of his chair and reached out to gently rest his hand on Sherlock’s arm and pull him closer. “You’re right,” he said, smiling. “I am pretty extraordinary.”
“Yes, and we need to head out as soon possible.” Sherlock snatched John’s coat off the back of the door and tossed it to him.
“I’ll make it quick, okay? So, the pub. I was definitely plastered at one point. Then I must’ve sobered up enough to remember to get a cab. I got into the cab, and…”
The go-pro gazes for one more moment at the rising helicopter before swooping back to see Simon crouching by him in the snow.
John can’t believe this is the same man who just utterly annihilated that wave, all dripping muscle and terrifying focus ripping across the surface of the ocean, stealing the breath of everyone on the shore.
“There now, I don’t think they’ll let you see him now unless you were an athlete. He’ll be in the athlete’s medical facility. But look there, he’s walking just fine to the lift. He’ll be—”
Greg runs a hand through his hair as he takes a deep breath, and the clock on the white wall ticks in the thick silence. Sherlock picks incessantly at a hangnail, as if
Greg knows this role, like the lines in a well-worn script. Now is the part where he argues back, and the two of them bicker, throw in a few one-liners to laugh about later when they both complain to John. Maybe Sherlock will dig his heels in and really push back until Greg goes into full Coach Mode, commanding and demanding until Sherlock’s cheeks flush and he pretends to begrudgingly follow directions. Maybe Sherlock will actually agree, and their minds will come together and confer in that beautiful symbiosis Greg knows they can have, as if they were both born from the snow itself. Maybe Greg will act professional and exasperated and in control, but speak that hidden language which makes both of them shiver—the knowledge that this ‘Coach’ and ‘Holmes’ nonsense is all a charade, hiding the fact that they’ll fall into each other’s arms that night, exhausted and spent and giddy from a day on the slopes, lips on lips.
I wipe my glasses off on the bottom of my plain button-down shirt, then wrap my cardigan tighter around myself. I wore dark colors this time – nothing special. Easier to fade back into the walls of the streets, pass the time by invisible until I can leave.
Holmes, chuckling: “Not that excellent. How long was it until your cameras caught him gazing at me with hearts in his eyes? Four seconds?”
Watson’s voice, as the on-screen Watson turns and runs back to the waiting helicopter, as if nothing odd has just happened: “You know, I love this place. I’ve told you all this before. Zermatt, the mountain, the helicopters, the ice. And I . . . I love this team. More than any family I’ve ever known – even the army.”
He can’t remember it. He doesn’t even want to try. It’s as if he stumbled into another universe the day before, the second the buzzer went off for his time trial. A universe unknown to him, but that had always existed in the shadows, whispering to him, calling,
My eyes adjust to the darkness. Look around frantically for a swirl of black coat, a hint of curls blowing harshly in the moonlight. A sliver of pale, glowing skin.
Watson, chuckling: “I’d say here, during the peak season, it’s the other way around. Ninety-percent action. But, yeah, I get what you mean. I guess I know what I want, now, out of a job. It’s not for everyone, but. . . yeah, it works for me.”
John huffs out a bitter laugh, hands floating wildly up into the air at his sides. “I can’t just stay here, Sherlock! I have a job, my apartment, I have a whole fucking life back in Los Angeles. I can’t just leave it all and move here to la-la paradise land with you!”
John reaches up and tears off Sherlock’s hood, letting his curls burst free. He grips them. Holds Sherlock’s shoulders, his back. He breathes in the sweat and the ice and the ski wax and the lycra.
Rick and Sonya both immediately turn to Greg, and Greg wonders if he imagines the slight sigh of relief that, apparently, the time for asking Sherlock Holmes questions is temporarily finished.
There’s a brief pause, and we hear Watson clear his throat. Through the open helicopter door, we can see Patrick guiding the patient to her feet.
It takes him by surprise, to sit there in the back of the taxi and think of Vietnam with even a tinge of nostalgia, of appreciation. He feels completely at ease with the memories, even despite his nerves at seeing Scotty again. He tells himself that it’s impossible for him to feel like this because he’s about to see Scotty again.
