“King Dean Winchester of Lawrence.” He nods his head in respect and turns on his heel to walk back to the camp. It takes another ten minutes for Castiel to finally walk up to me, eyebrow raised and a faint smirk painted onto his lips. He bows lowly and I bow back to show each side that we are in conversation.
"Súck these." He whispers before bringing three fíngers up to my mouth and i start lícking and súcking on them while he brings his other hand down to stóke his érection as i moísten up his fíngers. "Ready?" He asks and i nod my head and he takes his fíngers out of my móuth and pénetrates my hóle with them one, twísting and túrning them around insíde of me, making me gásp and móan.
"Happy birthday." I say to her, putt my arms around her waist and leaning down to kiss her softly. She smiles into the kiss and i look at her up and down, realising how much she had grown.
"Hello you." He says softly and my lip trembles as i collapse into his arms, pulling him in close to me as i start sobbing into his chest. "Shhh, Cas. It's okay." He whispers gently as i cling to his shirt. I don't know why i was breaking down now, i suppose it was because i hadn't seen him in so long and with everything that had happened i just couldn't keep it in any longer. I had been sad, i had been angry and now i just felt empty.
"Yeah yeah, father will know that we've been in his room blah blah blah. But that also means that he can keep Castiel in here for as long as he wants before finally handing him over to you. You know what father is like, he will wear himself out on him before finally handing him over." I nod my head before looking back at Castiel who looks so hopeless all tied up and bruised. It also kind of turned me of but that wasn't important right now. I gulped and walked over to him.
I walk towards the sound of the song and stop when I see a little girl in a red cloak sitting atop the border wall, playing with a toy happily. When she sees my approach she stops singing and gasps before hopping off the wall and backing away from me.
"What would you do if they kidnapped me?" I asked him angrily and his mouth opened in shock. "Or Leliel?"
"Well, if he does turn up, maybe I will be able to talk to him like you spoke to your god..." Dean says sceptically and I give him a pointed look.
"You forget something?" He glances at the mess I left of the floor and I coughed awkwardly before nodding.
“I’ve never met her before.” He shrugs, looking slightly confused. “Are you sure she recognised my name…?”
"D-dean. Please!" I stutter out, biting down on my knuckles hard as my back archés off the bed. He slídes his fíngers back out of me and i whíne at the sudden loss. I look at him pleadingly and he just smiles back, cráwling above me and kíssing me softly. I hold onto the back of his head, wanting to táste every part of him in eagerness as he rumages around my móuth. He lifts my thighs up and positions himself, pressing himself against my hóle before slíding into my gently. My jaw clenches as i throw my head back slightly and he bites down on his lip hard muttering under his breath.
"Yes i know, sometimes on a clear day i can see your castle and i love looking at it. Sometimes when i squint my eyes, i can almost see you jumping out of your balcony and flying!" She exclaims all in one breath and i raise an eyebrow at her.
“How can you be sure?” The taller one asked, his hair was dark and his eyes were a greyish blue colour.
"Your majesty!" An angel calls through the tent flaps but didn't come in. I gasp suddenly and look at Dean who is looking at the tent flap worriedly.
Sam and Gabriel met up from time to time still and discussed old politics and spoke about how the start of the world came about however this was not very often, but in fact every hundred years or so.
“Bring it on, Crowley.” I snarl and he turns around suddenly and starts walking out of the great hall almost casually as if he owned the place.
I hadn't heard a word from anyone that Castiel was looking for his daughter because I was always too wrapped up in Valentina to notice what was really going on around me. I rode for days and days until I finally got to the borders of the Angel city where I was noticed straight away by many angels who tried stopping me from going into the city. Castiel had obviously alerted them about me ‘stealing’ his daughter but I wasn’t going to give up without a fight. I tried pushing through the angels but they were too strong so instead I struggled in their grip as they took me towards the castle, exactly where I wanted to be. We entered through the grand hall and stopped in the middle of it when a guard went off to go and find Castiel. They kept a tight grip on me as we waited and I breathed heavily due to all the action over the last few days that had completely mentally and physically drained me. Sometime later Castiel comes into the hall with the guard close behind him and he stands in front of his throne, looking at me angrily.
“Yes, your highness.” They bow before turning back around and travelling back down the alley. I turn back to the angels who are looking at me in shock. I myself didn’t know why I did that but I just knew that there was no point in capturing these angels. They weren’t warriors, they were afraid of demons and they didn’t look like they were going to cause any problems.
"Of course not your majesty, only every angel slave there is." I chuckle at her comment before turning around as she is slowly covering herself up with her rags. She hands the baby back to me, putting it in the right position before looking at me in the eye.
"it was extraordinary, he saw us when he and his fathers army were looking for angels but when he came to us he let us go instead of actually capturing us." Adam says, looking at me with bewilderment. I nod and look back at Michael.
Meanwhile in another part of the country, Crowley and some of his closest warriors are on a search for a fallen star. A human prophet had told them that the fallen star will bring about victory for the demons in more ways then one. He told them that they will be able to enslave the angels and bring about peace to the demons, letting them rule the earth the way they wanted to rule it. They rode on horseback for days when finally they reached a desert land where they were told the star fell.
"They're okay. Although i just caught them having sex." I shudder and pull a face. "I mean, i knew they did it but god, i didn't want to see it!" Luce laughed loudly at my comment and shook his head, clutching onto his stomach.
"I thought you locked it." I accuse and he shrugs and laughs. "How is that funny, we have scarred her for life!"
"Get out of here Leliel! Take the horse and run, go back to the castle and call for more warriors to meet us here!" I carry on fighting but she doesn't move from her spot and ends up smiting a demon on the spot that is coming up behind me.
"What was it your highness?" She asked quietly, looking up at me through her eyelashes that were long and pretty.
"Maybe it will Dean." He whispers, putting his hands on the back of my neck and closing his own eyes. "Maybe it will be forever."
Days past and the date for my coronation and wedding were slowly drawing closer. I was now getting fitted by a few angels on what I was going to wear when I heard a small knock at my door. I shouted at it to let them know that they could come in and when it opened it revealed Anna who was looking as radiant as ever.
"Because I've got things to do Cas, besides a little someone will be missing me." He smiles fondly and I snort
"Castiel, you realise that we are starting tonight don't you?" He laughs and I look at him in shock.
“You need a woman Dean, woman produce babies and babies become heirs. Stop complaining and just find someone before you become old and decrepit like your old man here. Find a beauty with wide hips and plush lips.” I roll my eyes and he chuckles at me before rubbing my hair.
"Your Majesty." Gasped a voice from the front of the hall and I looked up to see my right hand man, Michael walking carefully towards me and bowing.
"I suppose in a way i liked that very much but no... i prefer you in the clothes that you are comfortable and powerful in. I prefer this you, the you that doesn't take any crap from anyone and who holds himself high and mighty. I prefer the real you." He hung his head and scuffed his shoes on the stone floor awkwardly, looking anywhere but at me. "Did you know my mother?"
"My goodness, aren't we popular? What is it about your arse that makes the royals want to eat you up?" I threw a pillow at him but it landed lamely on the floor before his feet. "Alright, I'm going."
"I know you're frightened Leliel but you're wrong. You don't know him like i know him." I say and she looks at me in frustration.
"Let's fly." He ordered the angels and they all took flight above us, swishing about the broken cells before finally flying off. Demons tried to catch them but I took no notice of the commotion going on behind me. I was still staring at Castiel who was looking back at me calmly. "Do not try and find me Dean, you will not succeed."
"Yes!" She giggles and I smile back at her and bring my face to her, kissing her soft red lips gently.
What good would it do to try and speak to him now after all this time? This wasn’t a couple of years he was talking about, this was over 10,000 years!  How much can people change in ten thousand years? A lot, Castiel supposed. Dean had probably turned back to his demon ways and become evil, ripping up Wall Street and conning every man and woman he came across. That’s how demons got their kick now-a-days as they knew the angels would hunt them down if they started to kill humans.
“Your majesty? Your highness.” A squeaky little man said, bowing to us both. “The angels you asked for have arrived. Four women, one boy and a jester.”
“Thank you Prince Samuel.” I say bowing and he rolls his eyes and give me a only what I can describe as a pouted annoyed face.
"Oh I had suppressed that memory!" He groans and I laugh loudly before turning back and walking inside. He follows me in and we sit back down at the dining room table.
"Oh my Lucifer! Seriously? Would you just keep your mouth shut for a second otherwise I swear to the devil I will have you hung, drawn and quartered." I shut my mouth tightly and pouted moodily. "Thank you! Anyway as I was saying, I need your help-"
"It's your fault." I say to them quietly, eyes flashing milky white. "It's your fault she's dead. And here you both are, arguing with each other while yOUR OWN DAUGHTER, LIES DEAD ON THE EARTH. You are nothing but children, not even that, you are vermin on this earth.
"Where have you been?" She asked, her voice trembling slightly and I sighed and rested my forehead on hers.
“It’s true.” He says quietly, leaning against the wall with his shoulders slumped forwards and his head down in shame. “I don’t know why and I don’t know how but I do love him. I am so sorry.” He put his face in his hands and started crying silently. My lip trembled as I hated seeing him like this so I got up and walked over to him, putting my arms around him and hugging him tightly as a fresh flow of my own tears came pouring out of my face. I buried my head in his chest as he put his own arms around me and we stood there for a good couple of minutes before I pulled away again and turned to face the balcony doors.
“What in God’s name have you done?!” He snarled at Castiel and he shrunk backwards, lifting his arms up. My father stomped over to him and grabbed his hair tightly, hitting him plainly across the face so the angels lip and nose started bleeding furiously. He hit him over and over again and I shut my eyes to block out the sight but I could not block out the sound.
My heart was beating hard in my chest and my ears were red with anger. Tears were pouring down my face and made my eyes blurry but I didn’t care. I ran down the study steps and towards the kitchen where I stuffed a load of food into a bag. I collected sheets and equipment I would need for the journey and long with some timber to light a fire if I needed it. I would have to stay close to a stream in case I went into labour which I knew would be very soon. I could feel my daughter pressing down on my stomach as if telling me she didn’t want to leave but she didn’t understand, we had to leave. I rubbed my stomach as if to say everything would be alright but I didn’t know that.
"Where abouts in the woods? No where close to the border i hope!" I shake my head drastically and look at him with wide eyes.
"What did you go and say that for? Where the hell are we meant to go?" I snap and he shrugs again and sigh, flicking his wrists to shut the door from where we were sat. "It's dangerous Dean, by now both the kingdoms will be out looking for us!"
We walk down towards the market and Valentina is ecstatic when she see's a small puppet play going on near the docks. I tell Dean to stay with her while i rumage around the market to try and look for anything we need while also looking around for any angels or demons that may spot me. I had put a ring around Dean and Valentina so no magical being could see them but i didn't have enough power to put it over myself so i would just have to be extra careful. I grab a basket and the women were looking at me strangely, i only guessed it was because it was normally the women that did the shopping and the men who were working hard labour jobs for low pay. I smile at them and shrug.
We didn’t really know where we were going but we just knew we had to get as far away from the angel and demon kingdoms as possible. We knew people would be out looking for us by now so we had to move quickly and quietly to try and avoid being seen by anyone who might tell either side where we were. We get to a forest that is only a mile or two away from a large sea that separates our country from one of a faraway land.
“For real?” I say excitedly and he nods his head seriously. “Of course! I would need to ask my daddy first though, maybe you can ask him instead! He said he knew you once, and perhaps he will say yes to you!”
"I've met your father, I've also had sex with your father." His eyes go wide as realisation suddenly hit him and he puts his face in his hands.
“I remember this.” He says, compassion filling his voice but not love. Still no love was in his voice or his eyes, just sadness. “You saved me from that god-awful woman.” I smile and nod at him before grabbing his hand again.
“THIS IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF ANYMORE ASSASSINS COME. I WILL KILL EVERY LAST MOTHERFUCKING ONE OF THEM. DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR?” I shout at them all as they all look on in shock, pride and horror at the dead head in my arms. “If I also find out who is sending these assassins, I will kill them also and it will not be as quick and painless as this fellow had it, trust me on that one.” I had lowered my voice for extra effect and people gulped and nodded at me as I slam the head on the floor. “Send someone up to clear the damn body out of my room.”
"Yes, i am." I say, leaning against the cold wall, looking down at the girl on the other side. "I rule the angel kingdome, just a while back from here." I point behind me and she nods her head enthustatically.
I see a couple of angels running towards my chambers and I know that the body will be cleared in a matter of minutes. I give my courtiers one last glare before slowly making my way towards me room once again, wanting to put Valentina back for her nap.
"I-i need you, inside of me. Please just fuck me, damn it!"  I was already out of breath even though the fun stuff hadn't even started yet. With one go he pushes both of his fingers into me without a warning, making me cry out at the pain and close my eyes tightly shut. He began moving his fingers slowly in and out of me, scissoring his fingers while doing so and prizing me open. His spare hand reached up and slowly began jerking me off while rubbing his thumb along the end of my shaft.
I hopped off my horse and decided to walk for a bit, knowing that I would have caught up with her by now. She was pregnant and couldn’t ride that far and that fast in only one week. I was cut off from my thoughts when I saw a figure in the water, stuck on a rock so they couldn’t move. I approached the figure cautiously only to notice that they weren’t moving at all. Blood was trailing from the figure down the river and I ran over to them and choked back a sob. My wife was laying face down in the water, a rock stopping her movements as blood filled the river around her. I pulled her out of the water and noticed that she was pale, he mouth parted and her eyes closed. My wife was dead and seemed to have been dead for maybe a whole day. I cried and cried into her, holding her wet body close to mine. I looked down at her stomach but noticed that it wasn’t round anymore but more flattened out. I stopped sobbing, tears still streaming down my face but looked in the water for any sign of my child. I couldn’t see her, I couldn’t see any sign, no cry, no bundle of rags, nothing that showed any sign of her. I looked back down at Leliel and gulped, resting her on the grassy bank gently.
“It’s not my decision Sam.” He says without taking his eyes off me and Sam turned around to look at me pleadingly.
"His name is Castiel! The king papa! The king of the angels." Dada's eyes narrowed slightly and he bit the inside of his cheek hard.
We got there within three days to the demon camp. You could see the angel camp up ahead if you looked hard enough and I suspected that both sides were taking a breather to pick up their dead and have some rest. I walked into camp coolly and saw Crowley standing around some of his advisors that included my father and talking to them professionally. I walk up and bow to him in respect and he does the same to me.
I see them both crying and lowering her body into the grave and my heart breaks in my chest as i realise i will never see my little girl again. She never even got to open her birthday presents. Me and Dean had bought her travelling clothes and items so she could go off and travel the world. She wouldn't be able to do that now.
“I-“I start but she storms off and a minute later she is sat on a horse and by my side, glaring at me slightly. My lips thinned but I turn on my horse and start riding anyway, knowing that I wouldn’t be able to get her off my back because of how stubborn she was. We ride off with an army of angels trailing behind us towards the battlefield where the army of demons were waiting.
"Wait what? Well which one do I go too, the king or the prince?" I asked the maid and she shrugged her shoulders before walking out of my room. "What the-"
"Good night my beautiful king." I whisper before closing my eyes and drifting off into a sleep that was filled with Castiel.
“I haven’t seen in a fairy in god knows how long.” I tell her but she doesn’t look as if she is listening to me. She is just look at the fairy and smiling like she has no care in the world. I wish I had that, I wish I could just live underwater and not have to listen to anybody complain about wars and laws. “What is your name?” I ask the mermaid and she finally looks back up at me.
“I think the forest will provide good coverage for us.” Castiel whispers as Valentina hangs on the edge of it, jumping up and down on her feet, waiting for us. I nod at him and we go forwards, jumping off out horses and leading them into the forest.
“SHUT IT CASTIEL!” She screams at me and I close my mouth to let her speak. “I will not let you ride off into battle alone, let me go to Anael and we can organise the woman to fight alongside you. I have a bad feeling about this Castiel; I have a bad feeling about you marching off like this. You could get ambushed and this might be a trap. Please!”
“Fuck, I love you.” Castiel shouts, slamming his lips on Dean’s for the first time in ten thousand years. The kiss was sloppy and not well thought out but neither of them cared very much. They were so damn hungry for each other. Castiel pushed Dean into one of the cubicles in the toilet and kicked the door shut, reaching a hand out behind him to lock it. All that could be heard in the small cubicle or in fact the whole toilet was the heavy gasping and panting coming from the boys mouths that were greedily biting, sucking and kissing one anothers.
“Do you know her name? I always wonder why us demons never get to know the names of the angels. They could be important.” She smiles kindly at me and I return her smile.
“No Bartholomew, that’s alright. She’s a powerful angel and can look after herself, besides if I send someone after her she will turn around and send them back anyway so there is practically no point.” I sigh and shake my head at my overly brave wife before shouting to my army to carry on.
“What’s wrong? Would you prefer it if I was a demon like your lovely little ginger slut?” I snarl at him, I don’t know why I said that. A feeling in me suddenly arose at the thought of them holding hands together that time when they walked past the slave courtyard.
We were out finding the angels for a whole two weeks before we finally gave up and rode home. I got to the gates and was greeted by Anna who looked like she had been worried.
"No you didn't, you knew exactly where I was. I know you have spies working at the castle in Lawrence." His lips thinner and his eyes narrowed. He pursed his lips and leaned back on his desk, putting a hand on either side of him to hold himself up.
“Well, the good news is every single demon in the world is now terrified of you.” Gabriel says, trying to look on the bright side of life. I give him an unsuccessful smile before pouring myself another glass of whiskey.
I end the curse and scowl at them both and suddenly the angel sweeps off into the air and flies over the trees, away from his daughter, his husband and myself.
The monster roared against and got out its own long blade, thrashing around with it to try and hit me. He was clumsy in his methods but I knew that this is an aspect that could have made him even more dangerous. I used my powers to block his blade and stabbed upwards into his belly. When he came crashing down, to my surprise he took one more swing at me, cutting my leg and my shoulder and making me cry out in agony. The beast was dead but I was bleeding real badly. I limped over to the horse and got on its saddle slowly, hissing in pain when I knocked my bad leg against the horse. I clicked my tongue to get it to ride and when we were way in the distance I looked back on my defeated foe only to find that it had disappeared. I frowned and sniffed the air to try and smell and traces of it nearby. It was so strange, I was so sure that I had defeated the troll but how could it just disappear like that? I gritted my teeth but carried on riding anyway until I got to a larger river. I stopped once again to wash my cuts and bruises in the water, letting the flow of water carry away my blood. I stood up again and breathed heavily, in and out through my mouth as my daughter pressed down hard on some pipe in my stomach. I groaned heavily and kneeled down on the grassy bank, clutching my stomach while sweat poured from my forehead.
“You!” I march over to him and he looks at me confused where I grip his shirt tightly and push him against the wall with such furious anger that it knocks all the wind out of him with a big ‘ooof’. “How dare you!” I scream in his face and he looks around, terrified. Some guards and behind me, carrying long knives but they don’t really know what to do with themselves.
"You do your job." I retort back pettily and she snorts before throwing a pillow at me. "Good bye, sweet wife."
I knew what he was going to say but I held onto the one shred of hope that he might still love me. I was holding onto the one shred of hope that somewhere inside of him, he may still find me attractive and he may still hold me close and night and help me bring up our child but I knew, I knew by the look in his eyes and the frown on his face that he didn’t love me anymore.
"Was there something you wanted to say Cas?" He asks expectantly, smiling a little as my strange behaviour. I put my own fork down and look up at him, licking my lips slightly.
“I’m not going to hurt you.” I whisper. I hear a noise from the entrance of the alleyway and turn to look down it. Some of my men were travelling down it quietly so I call out to them. “It’s just me lads, nothing down here.”
"Marry me." I say quickly, looking into her eyes and suddenly she smiles so brightly that it almost blinds me.
"Cas..." I begin to say but with a swoop of his almighty wings he flies up above the demons and shoots out of the dungeons and up towards freedom. I wondered how with just a click of his fingers he could free those other angels when I realised that he must have been playing weak this whole time, trying to get information out of the castle in any way or form. I begin running back up the stone cold steps and towards the great hall where I knew my father and brother would be waiting for me. When I burst into the hall, there was even more commotion in here then there was down in the dungeons.
"She was a human?" Sam and Dean ask at the same time and I turn to look at Michael who is staring at the floor blankly before turning back around to look at them and shaking my head.
“Have it your way then.” I grin evilly and turned my eyes that sickly black of a demon’s. It was only a mind trick really, no power went into it but it did the trick. He let go of me and backed away slightly to I advanced on him. “What’s wrong? Cat got your tongue?”
As soon as she grasped my hand in hers, electricity went through my body like a lightning bolt goes through a tree. Goosebumps cover my whole body and my eyes go wide, so i look at her and gulp slightly. She looks shy and timid, wondering whether to let go of my hand or not but she keeps clinging on, waiting for me to say something.
She falls asleep midway during the lullaby and I finally tiptoe off towards the great hall where I had work to do. I couldn’t do it in my study anymore because that had been turned into a bedroom for Valentina. I sat down at a desk at the side of the hall and began writing an official letter of some kind to my father. I had given the room beside mine to Amelia who had helped me with Valentina for over two years now. She was the one that woke up in the middle of the night to feed her but I did everything else for her. I changed her and played with her, I bathed her and because her hair was growing so long now I even brushed it for her. I actually counted her as my daughter and sometimes that I forget that I just found her near a river. I couldn’t believe that anyone would want to give this child up.
"Your majesty." They bow low down to me and I nod my head in acknowledgement. "We have some amazing news."
"SAMUEL WINCHESTER!" I gasp, pressing my hand to my heart in shock. "Don't you dare talk about baby girl that way!"
Finally, Castiel got to the front of the queue and ordered a small cake and a nice latte to drink inside the store. He waited for his drink and cake, tapping his fingers on the counter absentmindedly as the women finally put his drink on his tray, along with his cake and he went to go and sit down. However, the only available seat actually left was a small, two-seater table right next to the business men. No reason this was the only table available, they were being so loud that no one in their right minds would want to sit anywhere near them
"Fine, you can come but if things get too heavy for you and you start becoming afraid I want you to ride off as fast as you can." He nods in understand and smiles in triumph, looking way to pleased with himself. After another ten minutes he speaks again but this time it is more of a whisper;
“Send him in.” I say to the guard, smiling slightly before getting up to greet the golden angel. He comes in and walks straight over to me. I hold out a hand to shake it but instead he hugs me tightly and my eyebrows raise slightly.
“Why is that then? Why are you getting all hot?” I lean down closer to him and whisper in his ear. “Tell me your highness, why are you getting all hot?”
“You’re tight baby boy.” I say softly before pulling my fíngers out of him. He whines in complaint but I kiss him again, softer this time as I position myself over him, lining my cóck up with his hole. I hold him close to my body and I begin to enter him and he hisses in paín even though I’m going as slow as I possibly could go and shushing him as I do so, making my voice as soft as possible while he flails around beneath me, wanting me to go faster but it hurting him too much as I enter him. His muscles are tight around me and it makes me gasp and moan and I go further into him before the base of my erectíon meets his entránce. I stay still for a few moments to let him get used to the uncomfortableness of me filling him up and when he finally relaxes slightly and breathes heavily out, I take this as my queue to carry on.
"Yes. I'll just..." With that I walked over to the stuff and managed to pick it all up without dropping anything. Before I turned to leave however the king spoke up;
"How did you even get her into the castle?" Sam whispered hurriedly as I rocked the baby back and forth. I had just sent for an angel slave that had just had a baby so the little girl could feed off her breast.
"I dunno. Because it hurts worse than hell, and thats not even metaphorically speaking." I hear her giggle and sit up to look at her, smiling slightly.
"Good, that means they can't make any more but that doesn't mean that they haven't already made some. We also have got too look out for any demons with the shackles that can capture is and then kill us later." I warn and he nods his head while walking withe towards Michael and Gabriel and my other advisors.
"That's what I mean, they aren't normal demons. They have... Feelings is the best word to describe it." Michael nods in understanding.
"Thank you for sticking by me Castiel, I love you." She looks at me expectantly and I nod at her kiss her lips before telling her to go back to the castle and walking off back to the battle. I didn't notice her standing there looking after me with a hurt look etched across her face as realisation hit her. I didn't love her anymore.
“Yeah, I like that one.” Cas says, smiling at the door with curiosity and happiness lining his eyes. “I like her very much.”
“DADDY!” Valentina shouts loudly and runs over to Castiel and hugs him tightly. Castiel freezes and looks down at her in shock before looking up at me with tears in his eyes. ‘Thank you’ he mouths to me and I smile and nod my head as he kneels down in front of her and gives her a proper hug. “What was Momma like?” She asks him and her arms cling to him.
The voice was eerily beautiful and it sent me into a sort of daze, almost as if i wanted to fall to sleep but i resited the urge. I walked out from behind the tree and started walking to wear the person was singing the lullaby. I wasn't scared but i was steady and careful while walking towards the sound that kept getting that tiniest bit louder as i approached. There was a beautiful purple light coming from one of the clearings of the trees so i walked towards it and knew instantly the music was coming from there.
“You got to name her and bring her up, you got to be there on her birthdays and give her gifts. You got to hear her first words and see her first steps. You got everything and all I got from this experience was anger and heartbreak. Why would you kill Leliel and then take my daughter, Dean? Why would you do that?”
"You only think that this is a good idea because you want Sam Winchester." I snap and he just shrugs back at me.
"Enough!" I shout and Gabriel backs away even though he literally can't anymore because of the door.
“Why? Are you jealous?” His face drops furiously and he grits his teeth. “I’m joking Castiel. It went fine, she was asking about you actually. She seemed to recognise your name; did you used to know her?”
"No it's not! He's a demon! A demon prince! Why is he here?" She hissed, gripping onto my arm tightly but not taking her eyes off Dean.
"I hope so." He kisses me gently and i melt instantly into it, pressing my body against his against the door. I extend my arm out and find the doorknob and twist it open, pushing him inside the room eagerly and unbuttoning his white shirt as he fumbles around with mine as our lips are still pressed together. His tongue slides into my mouth and shivers go down my spine as he takes control, spinning us around so he is pushing me towards our bed. I grin at him and he smirks back before shoving my backwards so i land on the bed with a soft thump. He climbs on top of me and i run a hand down his chest and abs until my hands slips under the waistband of his leggings.
"Our life now. I'm so happy, i've never been happier. I don't want to go back there, i never want to be king again and i never even want to see another demon again unless it was little Sammy. I just want this to last forever Castiel, why can't it last forever."
“Shh, it’s okay baby.” I mumble. “I got you.” With my hands I brush them up his thighs and push one leg up to my shoulder where it rested there. I lick my fíngers, slathering them with spit from my own mouth and sliding my tóngue around them before bringing the hand down and pushíng them into him slowly. He cries out quietly as they further into him and begin ripping him gently open again but I hushed him and told him I had him over and over again. He hands gripped onto the bed sheets tightly and I started fingering him and scíssoring his tight hole, opening and closing my fíngers gently to prize him open as if he was a present just for me.
“You need to get out of here.” I warn them and the brother snaps out of his shock and nods seriously. “Do you have a way to go?”
I wasn't going to listen to father, i was going to carry on going into those woods. However the only problem was, how could i get out of the castle without being noticed. I would need Marian to escort me, perhaps i could lie to her when she tells me to go ask dada and tell her he had said yes. Yes, that is exactly what i was going to do. No one could stop me from going into those woods, not a single soul. I would see Castiel again, i wanted so much to see him again. The real life king of the angels had come to speak to me, i felt so important all of a sudden. I smiled through my tears as i came up with the decision that next week i would go back into the woods and hopefully the beautiful angel man would be there.
“Thank you.” I whisper, looking down at the necklace and he nods. “You know because it’s my birthday…?”
"I know what he said, but maybe there is a way we could defeat Lucifer or maybe talk to him. There has to be something that we could do to make this last forever. We could not grow old together." He smiles as i open my eyes. "We could go into the future together and watch the ages go by."
"You're crying, it means that you are getting overwhelmed with all your emotions and your tear-ducts are swelling." I say and he looks at me sadly.
“Come lay with me?” He asks and I quirk an eyebrow at him. “Not like that. Just lay with me.” He grabs my hand and pulls me towards his bed chamber, plopping down on his bed and letting me sit down beside him by myself. I do so, although I feel awkward and all of a sudden shy.
“Aren’t you a little cutie pie.” I say to her and she gurgles slightly. I smile broadly at the little girl but bite my lip hard, scolding myself for being so intrigued in this little girl. I look back at my Impala and shrug before taking the baby over to her and letting the horse sniff the girl. “What do you think Impala, should we wait around to see if the mother or father turns up?” I ask my mute horse and decided that this would be the best idea. I would wait here for a couple of hours.
“Prince Dean Winchester of Lawrence!” A guard shouted at the top of his voice and I walked in through the big double doors this time rather than the side ones and down the large stone steps so other demons could take me in. I placed a fake smile on my face and started greeting people, women mainly who were all trying to get me to ask for their hand in marriage. This was going to be a stressful night.
"Sammy." I say softly as I walk over to him and sit down next to him, placing an arm around his shoulders. "Everything will be okay."
"What have I done now?" I sigh and he stomps off away from me leaving me alone in my fathers room. I throw my arms up in the air dramatically. "Doesn't anyone know that promises mean nothing when you are a demon?"
"Well-" the door burst open and my father walked into the room, looking surprised about the fact that we were all stood around his door.
"Oh." She says, her reaction not what i had planned it on being. I look down at the stone and frown.
"I'm sorry Val, but i don't want you going into them woods anymore. It was lucky that you met Castiel but if it was any other angel you could have been killed! No more going into the woods, do you understand?" He says in a strict tone of voice and i pout my lip but nod my head. I could feel tears welling up but i didn't want dada to see my cry so i turned around and ran off away from him. He shouted for me to come back but i ignore him, wanting to get as far away from him as possible. The woods was the only place where i could go to be alone, everywhere else in the castle was guarded or had rowdy people in every room.
"Well obviously." She giggles and gently picks one of the flowers. She brings it over to me and gets on her tiptoes to slide the rose behind my ear, making it balance by the side of my head. She giggles again and walks around the apparent Eden i had accidently created for her. How the hell was i supposed to know her favourite flower was a damn rose? Why did i even think this was going to be funny. Now i'm stuck here with this little girl with a flower sticking out of my hair and a moody look on my face.
"Dean, i have to tell you something. Something important." I say seriously, walking over to the bars and putting my hands over his, leaning my face through the gaps.
He lifted his hand to Castiel’s chin and turned his face back to look at him. Castiel was shocked to find tears leaking out of the demons eyes too and suddenly every memory of him came flashing back. The memory of finding out that Dean wasn’t like other demons. He had an angel side to him as well meaning he could feel powerful emotions to their full extent, feel them healing his heart or ripping it apart.
“Alright Alright, don’t get your knickers in a twist just because you found out that your husband may or may not be in love with a demon.”
Castiel entered the shop, the bell at the door jingling, surprised to find that the shop was quite busy. He sighs and lines up in the long queue, waiting to be called to a till so he can buy a drink and sit down for a little while, preparing himself for today. He heard loud talking from a table nearby and men all dressed in suits were all talking loudly about some business of some sort. Castiel just rolled his eyes at the humans and the worry for money tried ignoring the business men that for some unknown reason got on his nerves.
"Fine, but i'm taking extra precautions." He nods in agreement and we both slide out of bed and get dressed quickly as the cold air brushed against out naked skin. I begin to walk out of the door but Dean grabs my arm and turns me back around. I frown at him again but he is just smiling down at me with a twinkle in his eye. "What?"
“That’s because you’re only a silly little demon and can’t see the true beauty of things.” I comment and he gives me a shove.
"I've just got to go and get something." He left the room and went to his study, leaving me alone once again. A minute later he was back, holding a sheet of parchment in his hand. "Don't be too long in there; the water is already starting to get cold."
“If only we lived in another life, where things were different and angels and demons got along fine with one another. If only we lived in another life where we could be together and not have anyone looking at us strangely or judging us on who our companion is. If only we could live in another life where it doesn’t matter who you belonged to because you are theirs and they are yours.” He looked at me sadly and his eyes were leaking that same substance that was on my face only yesterday.
Lucifer however found out about Crowley and his scheme and left no mercy upon him when he went to his kingdom and tortured him over and get again for the rest of time, letting him live but prolonging his known death. After that, Lucifer went back to being the devil of the world, the snake in the garden and went back to his old ways.
"I haven't opened them yet. We always wait until after dinner to open the presents." She says and i grimace.
"Thank you." She says and He smiles widely before standing up straight and walking slowly towards me and Dean who were stood rigid at the sight of our daughter receiving a gift from my God. Dean looked as if he was about to burst into a ball of flames at the presence of him, his eyes had turned pitch black, blacker then I had ever seen them. There was no shine to them, just dull blackness like a black void had filled him. It was His presence that had made Dean's eyes turn, Lucifer was Deans God after all and being in the presence of mine made him extremely uncomfortable and unsafe.
"You hear me Cas?" He asks loudly and i groan and nod my head but don't open my eyes. He laughs lightly and kisses my face a bunch of times to wake me up a little but it didn't work. However when he kissed the lids of my eyes softly, they flickered open and blue met green like they had done so many times before.
I didn’t know why we had to leave when other people came out but I looked at the other children who were playing in the streets with envy as I got dragged back into the woods without a backwards glance. However, I couldn’t fault that when I looked at papa and dada, I couldn’t help but feel happy. They looked at each other with a sparkle in their eyes and smiles on their faces. They looked at me in the same way but there was something different in their eyes when they looked at each other like that. That is the reason I didn’t like them arguing, because when they argues, the light in their eyes flickered as if it was about to go out. However, they did not argue regularly, only sometimes when all they needed was a bit of space from one another.
I walked down to the great hall, moodily dragging my feet behind the advisor that came to get me. As we got to the doors I heard fanfares from inside to announce me presence before they opened and I walked in, carrying myself high and regal as I did so. I walked down the red and gold steps towards where Gabriel and Michael were stood, going them a look.
"Of course I know your name." He replies and starts fidgeting with the buttons on his waistcoat. "I-I just, erm."
“Excuse my sons, they are exhausted and must have run into some angels while on their travels. Please leave us.” All the advisors stand up sceptically and with a low bow to father and a short bow towards us, one by one they start to leave. We turned back to father after they had all left and he was rubbing his eyes tiredly.
“It’s hard to say but there is a bump there already. I think I must be at least ten weeks pregnant.”
“What is wrong with you?” He hissed and I stopped laughing suddenly but the ghost of the laugh still etched plainly across my face. I’m about to answer but my gaze is directed from him towards the throne were it is sparkling from the sun through the windows of the grand hall. There were jewels etched across the bottom of it, half done and by it was a bowl of rich jewels that were being chiselled into place on the large thrown. I raised my eyebrows and my mouth dropped open in surprise.
He held the door open pointedly, staring at Dean unflinchingly, until the other man stalked out of his office with unconcealed irritation.
“Of course not, I know you wouldn’t ever hurt me intentionally. I’ll admit, my pride is a little wounded, but I’d rather that than lose our apartment.” Castiel sighed, fingers idly stroking Dean’s hair. “You want to turn in?”
“Sure you don’t need a ride?” Dean asked Benny, jingling his car keys enticingly. “It’s still raining, I don’t mind dropping you off.”
He insisted on waiting until Castiel’s parents pulled up outside before taking his leave. He passed them on the stairs and gave them a onceover. They looked pretty normal, but from the little Castiel had told him, they were nice on the outside and cruel on the inside. Putting them out of his head, Dean made his way to the library, pulling a few books from the shelves and starting to make notes. He couldn’t concentrate though, all he could think about was Castiel’s stress and misery. He wanted to head back to the dorm and check that everything was good.
Dean had the key on a cheesy heart chain, pink and tawdry, but he knew Benny would get a kick out of it.
With a sigh, he rose from the couch and tossed his phone aside haphazardly. Cas knew where he was if something came up.
“Once or twice.” Castiel told him wryly, but was unable to hide his blush or the way his mouth curled up into a pleased smile. “So what’s new? How was work?”
Well, that was intriguing. Although it did mean he wouldn’t be able to try the daily special, which had become somewhat of a tradition for him at this point.
“There’s nothing wrong with you, Cas,” he whispers, pulling back to meet Castiel’s eyes. “If you ask me, someone out there is missing out on someone real special.”
Castiel would have snorted at the legal jargon if he wasn’t floundering at the price. Fifty bucks?! Finagler was too sneaky a term, this was daylight robbery.
Castiel felt a flare of anger. Was Dean finding this funny? He straightened up. “You—,” he began heatedly.
Benny’s eyes lost the last of their suspicion at Castiel’s words and he gave a brief nod towards Dean. “Get yourself home, brother. I’ll take care of this.” He turned to Castiel, who was clutching at his coffee cup as if it might be taken away from him. “You’re free to go.”
“No, no, no.” Dean tsked, cutting him off with a stern wag of his finger. “You should know the drill by now.”
There was a pause, and then Castiel relinquished his grasp on his jacket. “Thank you,” he replied quietly. “I appreciate this. A shower sounds perfect.”
There was a buzz of excitement from the other inmates as Castiel leapt from his seat, fist flying towards Crowley’s face. There was a sickening crunch that almost certainly loosened a few teeth, and Castiel savoured in his triumph for just a moment. The guards hovering at the sides of the yard had yet to notice that a full-blown brawl was about to break out, but they’d figure it out soon enough.
Castiel was barely aware that Anna excused herself, too busy staring at Dean. Even if he’d noticed, he wouldn’t have been able to tear his eyes away. He realised he was gaping after a few seconds and raised his glass to his lips, taking a large gulp of brandy.
“Anyone would think you were waiting especially for me,” Castiel commented. “I might start to feel special.”
Bobby glared at him. “You know you are, kid. It's solitary for you. Why’d you have to go and start that fight, huh? You got a death wish or something? You want Crowley to shank you?”
The sound of the key in the lock behind Dean drew his attention and he smiled widely as Castiel entered the house. Dean had finished early and Castiel had the night off, so they were planning to get takeout and watch
“That’s not it,” Castiel sighed. “He’s very attractive and charismatic. I’m sure we’d have a wonderful time. He seems… pretty great. But it would just be that one night, and that’s not what I’m looking for.”
“No,” he said eventually. The clarity had unnerved him and he needed to think. “Let’s go somewhere else today.”
“Absolutely,” Dean said, his expression eager. He was almost ready to agree to anything. “We could totally do that. Take it seriously so that we’re not doing too much damage to the results.”
In the relative safety of his home, Dean leaned against the front door and just breathed. It felt like a month had gone by since Benny left, yet it had barely been more than a couple of hours. Inviting Castiel over tonight felt reckless and disrespectful, but Dean had never been particularly strong when it came to keeping Castiel at arm’s length.
Castiel, in his sophomore year, had a perfect GPA. His parents doted on him just as intensely as they excluded Gabriel. It strained the relationship between Castiel and his brother, but he did everything to fix it.
“Why do you want to go out with me?” Castiel asked. “Why do you ask me every day, as if my answer will ever change?”
“You’re breaking up with me because I won’t make you crêpes?” Dean asked, roughly, though he knew that wasn’t fair, that he was in no position to be throwing accusations around, and that Benny certainly wasn’t at fault here.
Clearing his throat, Dean eventually met his eyes. “You don’t have to do that. I mean, it’s only another week or two until finals and I’m sure the pipes will be fixed by then.”
Castiel let the door swing closed behind him and sighed. Well, that could have gone better. He returned to his marking, forgetting all about Dean in a matter of seconds. He’d probably never see him again anyway. It was a big campus, after all.
The tension was back. Castiel’s hands clenched into fists and he struggled to fight back a reply to that. It took a moment for him to relax and his hands to unfurl. Eventually he reached for the coffee again to give his hands something to do, taking a sip and cradling the cup.
Castiel’s father swore under his breath and opened the door wider. Castiel felt himself being tugged inside and he reached out blindly, hands finding Dean’s sleeve. He clung on tightly, refusing to let go, hauling Dean in with them.
Castiel paused and looked down at his fingers. A beat. He raised his fingers to his lips and blew on them, watching the dust fly from his digits and drift to the floor. The box had clearly been untouched for some time, then. Still, Castiel decided he wouldn’t snoop any further and settled himself back on the bed. The pillows still smelled like Dean. He leaned in and inhaled deeply. It smelled like his soul as well as his body. Castiel knew Dean would think he was nuts if he explained how much he liked the scent of Dean’s soul, but it was true. It smelled like something that reminded Castiel of the moments after his creation. Maybe a little of Heaven. It smelled pure.
Dean knew him so well. Castiel glanced over at his soon-to-be husband, his eyes filled with love and happiness. “I was just thinking that I can’t wait to marry you.”
Of course, flipping the phone answered the call, so now Castiel was uncomfortably holding a phone while hearing a muffled voice call out in greeting.
“Then I’ll stay too,” Castiel told him gently. “And apply to KCU. We might not be there together, but I’ll still get to see you.”
Hiding his smile, Castiel made sure Claire’s coat was all buttoned and she had everything ready to go for when her uncle arrived.
Silence. It went on so long that Dean wasn’t sure if they’d lost connection or if Castiel had hung up on him. When he spoke again, Castiel’s tone was wary, placating. “You know my job requires me to be flexible with my hours.”
At the front of the classroom, Dean folded his arms, his expression defiant and his tone one of forced politeness. “Absolutely, Professor Novak. Go right ahead.”
Castiel dried his eyes angrily, stalking back and forth in front of the oak tree and trying desperately to find the rationality that he clung to most of his life. But in this moment, it seemed to have deserted him, leaving him twisted and overcome with petty jealousy.
“Sounds good. Meet at your place, then?” Castiel made no attempt to move, despite his words. “You still…?”
The afternoon was productive. Castiel managed to finish up the entirety of the senior years papers on Tess of the d’Urbervilles and even take an impromptu meeting with a student looking to discuss extra credit. Castiel liked Alex, she worked hard despite her dyslexia and was more than happy to give her extra credit.
From that point on, everything was a blur. He was sure Dean spoke to him, but he couldn’t remember anything up until the point where Dean pulled up at the bottom the hill, the towering oak tree a familiar sight above him. It felt like only seconds had passed. Castiel sank down in the grass at its base, staring down into his lap.
Castiel shrugs, keeping his eyes fixed on the road as he pulls away. “It just reminded me that I’ll never have a reason to cancel plans with
Dean closed his eyes and gathered strength. “Yeah, okay.” He pulled back reluctantly. It was difficult for Dean as he thought over how to broach the subject of something he’d never really spoken about before. Not to anyone. When he finally looked up at Castiel, he hesitated. “I don’t really know where to begin.”
In less than a second, Castiel’s eyes darkened in fury, but he managed to keep his composure. He grabbed his pen and wrote a quick note, handing it to Alex. “Sorry to cut this meeting short. Please go and see the Department Chair and have him fill out the required paperwork for your extra credit. Give him that note and explain I’ll stop by later. Thank you, Alex.”
Castiel gave a small sigh and shook his head. “That won’t be necessary.” He’d have to mention it in his review and it wouldn’t reflect favourably.
He pretended he couldn’t see the disappointment in Dean’s eyes as he turned away, gently pushing his way through the crowd to the door. He couldn’t think straight, everything was too warm and Dean’s eyes were too focused, too intense, too distracting.
He took a careful bite of the food, wary of what it could taste like. The moan that escaped him at the positively sinful flavour was unstoppable. The creamy alfredo sauce flavoured with the earthy mushrooms and sweetness of the bell pepper was amazing. The pasta was something out of this world. Dean didn’t think he’d ever had fresh pasta. He’d never be able to have the dried stuff again.
They settled at the table, eating their sushi and making small talk about their respective workloads. Castiel pretended to pay attention to what Dean was saying while swiping the last of his spicy tuna.
Castiel was holding out a shiny platinum band. “I love you,” he said simply. “And every day I spent not being with you has shown me how much that’s true. You changed my life exactly one year ago today when you found me in the rain and now I’d like to change yours, to make you as happy every day as you make me. I’m in this for the rest of our lives. Will you marry me?”
Dean snorted but held back his laughter in fear of dropping the box. “I did warn you, man. Lunch is on me. To say thanks for the help.”
He crawled onto the bed and opened his arms, pulling Castiel to him. It opened the floodgates and then Castiel was grasping onto him and sobbing into his chest. He wept for a long time, and all Dean could do was let him, pressing soft kisses into his hair and holding him close. Seeing his boyfriend like this both made his heart ache and filled him with a murderous rage. Nobody should hurt Castiel like this.
“Wait,” Castiel interrupted. “Please, just thirty seconds. I just… I want to give you your birthday present before we go back.”
“There is always a revolution.” Castiel froze, his shoulders locking with tension as he heard the reply come from behind him, recognised the authoritarian tone of his father, a
It didn’t take him long to see what Castiel was waiting for him to find. The big advertisement for the apartment up for lease was hard to miss. “You gave up the apartment.” Dean breathed, lowering the newspaper to meet Castiel’s gaze.
No reply. Castiel just buried his face into his pillow. With a resigned sigh, Dean sat on the bed next to him, running a hand through the dark locks. “I guess the interview didn’t go well, huh?”
“You don’t need to understand,” Castiel snapped. “You just need to accept it. It’s not up for debate, Dean. I’m moving out and that’s final.”
The words affected Dean more deeply than he cared to admit, and he was already feeling pretty raw from talking about his abandonment. “You mean that?”
Dean couldn’t manage any words. He simply nodded and looked back at the television. Normally he was always up for an Indiana Jones marathon but right now he didn’t think he could bear to look at Harrison Ford’s stupid fedora for a single second longer.
“I know,” Castiel interrupted, but he was smiling. “I know. I’m not asking for anything. I’m here, and you know how I feel. If you want to try, then…”
This was his hiding spot, whenever Castiel needed to get away from things he would come here. Far on the outskirts of town, Castiel had found this little piece of paradise completely by accident. Atop a large hill, under the shade of a towering oak tree, Castiel had a perfect view of the luscious green fields dotted with wildflowers and red brick buildings of his hometown.
Castiel eyed him for a long moment and then nodded. “I’ll be right here next to you for take-off, okay? I’ll be back before you know it. Just take deep breaths.”
“But I used to see you every day,” Dean sighed, brightening up quickly. “And now I get to again. Have I told you how happy I am that you agreed to move in with me?”
Castiel hesitated. “Gabriel. He’s the sous chef at my restaurant. He would let me stay with him if I asked but… I can’t. It’s not a matter of pride, it’s a matter of my safety. And his.”
With that logic, it wouldn’t be unreasonable for him to at least save some time. Castiel slipped off his shoes and, as an afterthought, his socks, balling up the black cotton and shoving them into his shoes. He’d lost track of the amount of times his socks had been lost to the depths of Dean’s room and he’d had to hunt them down the next morning. Better to put them away safely now. It was just practical.
Being punched in the gut would have hurt less. He suddenly couldn’t bear to be in the same room as Dean. He found his own feet and began packing up his textbooks, stuffing them haphazardly into his satchel.
was until I got to school and all of the other kids made fun of me.” He didn’t say how he’d kept his tears in all day, pretended to his mom and Sammy that everything was fine. How he’d cried himself to sleep every night for the first six months of school because nobody wanted to be friends with a freak without a soulmate.
Dean grinned. “Right, right, heading to the love shack. I forgot all about it. Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do.”
The bartender colours a little bit, but shoots a nervous smile in Dean’s direction. “More like cautiously optimistic. I mean, we’re supposed to be made for each other, right? That can only be a good thing.”
“I’m going to head to the library. There’s a couple of case studies I want to dig out for this assigned reading. I was just hanging on until you got home to see if you had any news.” The lie came to his lips far too easily, but in contrast, Castiel’s eyes found it far too difficult to meet Dean’s. He truly feared what expression was on his face, but Dean seemed oblivious to anything amiss.
“Castiel,” Dean repeated, making sure he’d gotten it right. “I’m Dean. It’s good to meet you. I see you’ve already gotten a good start on moving in.”
“Mornin’, Chief,” Benny smiled. “Don’t often see you in here on a Sunday. Don’t tell me that school has got you so busy you’re workin’ your weekend away?”
“Lemon,” Castiel replied. He shifted awkwardly at the misconception he could read on Dean’s face and felt an unnecessary urge to correct it, but felt doing so would give the wrong impression.
His eyes flew open and he arched backwards in fright. “Son of a bitch,” he wheezed, clutching at his chest. “Don’t
“Well, who’s to say we haven’t been dating for the last six months?” Dean pointed out. “We live together, neither of us have dated anyone else in that time. We’re both over eighteen. And all we’d have to do is keep separate diaries that we hand in every week and get $50 for doing it.”
Dean grunts and looks at her. She’s stunning, all blonde and curvy and exactly his type. But he drags his eyes away, thinking about the perfect boyfriend he had waiting for him at home. Castiel was truly the man of his dreams, and nobody else held a candle to him, and hadn’t since they met as college roommates.
Dean just stared into the dark liquid for a long time, biting his lip. “I don’t know what to do, mom,” he whispered eventually.
Misery prickled in the back of his throat, threatening to make him tear up. Exactly what had he just gotten himself into?
“Virgin,” Castiel finished firmly, but his tone was belied by the way his eyes were boring into the floor. “It’s not a big deal, I don’t have any expectations of an amazing first time. I just… I’m not experienced. I was embarrassed to admit it and I was worried that I wouldn’t know what to do and you wouldn’t enjoy it.”
Castiel Novak exchanged equally distressed looks with his parents, before abandoning his dinner to answer the insistent knocking. He stopped their housekeeper, Ellen, as she made for the door, instead sending her back to her duties in the kitchen.
He was concerned when Castiel pulled away and made his way into the bathroom, locking the door behind him. Dean had never seen him like this before, not even during finals week and he was usually pretty bad during finals week. This was really getting to him and Dean didn’t know how to make it all better.
“Maybe we could get those drinks to go?” Gabriel mumbled, as Castiel stalked out of the door, shoulders locked with tension and his legs feeling suddenly wobbly.
“I think that’s my excuse to leave,” Castiel laughed, withdrawing from Dean’s embrace and stepping back. As he turned to leave, he heard Charlie shriek.
Castiel was just career-driven, that was all. Why rush home and sit in an empty house when he could get on top of his work?
Dean’s new apartment is a step down from his previous, but he can afford it easily and he doesn’t have to live on Ramen Noodles for a month like he’s a college student. The place is fine, even if the neighbours are little bit wacky. He swears his upstairs neighbour’s favourite hobbies include strangling small pets by the sound of it and the elderly neighbour across from him keeps trying to grab Sam’s ass when he visits (which is a sure sign that she’s senile because looks who she’s living across from). The first night he could barely sleep and he’s beginning to depend on whiskey-induced slumber.
The house was in one of those eerie silences where you know someone is home, but can’t hear or see them. From the kitchen, Castiel smells uncooked beef and hears the drone of a commercial jingle from the radio. It’s just past 4:30; and usually at this time, Castiel returns home to the sound of pots clattering and his mother muttering to herself as she cooked while the radio blasts Top 40 hits and Oldies throughout the house. If it was a good day, these sounds would be punctured by the sound of his father’s typewriter clicking away. These noises were routine enough that the current silence is unnerving.
Sam laughs. “Carver Edlund went into great detail about your little encounter with a certain Rhonda Hurley,” Sam says as he leaves the room. His brother may have kept his relationship with an angel a secret for two years, but Sam has won this round. Behind him he can hear a groan and Dean yells out “I’m going to kill Chuck!”
By instinct, he grabs his gun that is lying in a plastic box next to him. Dean hasn’t had a home in a long time, so the feel of his Colt 1911 is as close as he’s going to get. It also the same instinct that makes him point the gun at the stranger. He looks harmless, but you never know; underneath the Columbo jacket, he might be some black belt that could kick Dean’s ass. Dean doubts it, but it’s better to be safe than sorry.
“Yeah right,” he snarls. “Like you two weren’t planning on getting me back in the morgue just to kill me again. No thanks, I’m going to find Sammy, whether you like it or not. And I’m not going back with
He runs into the front window, and sees the hunched figure of Dean Winchester over that looks to be Mrs. Winchester.
That smacks the smile off of Sam like nothing else. It’s hard not to feel bad for the guy Still, Dean has sat back and let Sam and his affairs dance alone, now it’s time for him to step in and give his brother some good-old older brother advice.
“What’s it to you?” she hisses, her eyes flickering back. She’s going to be bitch to deal with, Dean can tell.
It’s Dean’s turn to roll his eyes. “Yeah, I’ll just slip out of my feelings for Cas shirt, burn it, and move on.”
Castiel has seen more dead bodies than he cares to admit. The numbers have been steadily increasing since Gabriel pushed him into cases and the bodies have begun to blur in his mind. This always seems sad to Castiel. They were once people who had lives and families, likes and dislikes. But it had been best to distant himself from the bodies he brought back for a few seconds; otherwise he would never be able to send them back to whatever they had came from. Despite this, right now there’s one body that is occupying his thoughts- and it wasn’t even one that he had raised from the dead.
“They just moved in two weeks ago- said the house has been sitting empty for a year or so. Said they heard nothing. Pretty much wasted a day on this.”
Castiel looks down at him, his eyes filled with love and mourning. This will be the last thing he’ll ever see, Dean thinks to himself, and he’s okay with that. Castiel reaches out again and he leans into the touch.
Now he’s alone on a beautiful Sunday afternoon with nothing to do. Sam and Jess have gone up to visit her parents for the weekend, Jo has a date that Dean’s suppose to cover for her to her mom, and he’s kind of stopped the whole one-night stand thing after Emma was born. Basically, he’s stuck in his apartment, which is the middle of being packed up so that he can move. The collection of cardboard boxes and empty shelves is an even lonelier sight and Dean’s itching to get out of there.
“I must have slipped and hit something,” his mother says, looking at Castiel for confirmation. He nods. She looks as uncertain as he feels.
“I don’t,” Aaron confirms, his voice friendly, with no hint of judgement or disgust. “And to apologize, I’ll buy you another beer.”
“He’s worried about you. It seems like you haven’t been returning his calls. Not that I blame you. Talking with him like defusing a time bomb with a butter knife. What’s got his goat?”
grade, he’s been moving from school to school, living out of motel rooms while his dad looked for things responsible for his mom’s death. He had watched Sammy grow up and leave them for Stanford- not unexpected, the guy was always too smart to be stuck with Dean and John Winchester while they “wasted their lives looking for the monster under the bed”. It seemed so important then for Sammy to stick with them, but since Dean’s died, he’s kind of glad that Sammy made it out of the life. He’s probably some rich lawyer somewhere, who's super embarrassed that he’s related to a suspected serial killer with a GED. Probably glad he’s dead.
It’s a terrible idea to keep Dean alive. Castiel knows this. He knew it when he watched the second hand tick past the minute and he knows it now that they’ve snuck out of the morgue together. Not only was Dean declared dead and his body was in prep for burial, he was also of public interest and the FBI were coming tomorrow- correct that,
“Can you believe I live with that?” Dean asks with a laugh. “I swear he’s strangling a parrot up there.”
It’s not much, but it’s better than nothing. He’s got a name and he knows that Sam’s been here recently. He moves outside, calling Bobby with a prayer that he doesn’t wake the guy.
“We fought a lot,” Castiel states, his voice restrained and even. It makes Dean jump in his seat as he turns off the engine. “He was…
Screw Cas for playing the saviour card. Dean never liked the idea of owing people a favour and this is a big one. He does literally owe the guy his life, even if he is giving it up in a couple of days.
“Uriel.”  Castiel said, trying to keep his voice steady despite the hammering of his heart under his breastplate.  “Uriel, it is one of the fallen ones.”
“And I know I must have scarred you for life.  Jeez, I took one step towards you back there and you nearly jumped out of your skin.  I- I never wanted to hurt you, Cas.  I don’t know what came over me that day, but every day since then has been hell for me because of what I did to you.  I
Dean lost Cas in the bustle in the hallway; parents were shouting their children’s names, looking for their little actor or actress.  He was pinned in place for several seconds by a group of children who’d had to sit still and quiet for far too long, they shrieked and ran amok through the many bodies that crowded the space.  Dean searched the hall, angrily cursing at how easily short people could disappear into a crowd.  He finally found Cas at the very end of the line of actors, laughing happily with a short red-headed elf that now held Cas’s bouquet of flowers.
The dragon prince looked at his sleeping angel’s face, then pressed a kiss to his forehead. He wished Castiel would wake so Dean could ask him to swallow the gem and hold it in his furnace, but Benny was convinced that Cas didn’t have a furnace, and Castiel never woke for long enough or with enough lucidity for such a request. Dean tucked the gem into the pocket on Castiel’s cloak and used his spark to stitch it inside, he’d give it to Castiel properly later.
Dean shrugged.  “Not really, I’ve taken all of my sophomore classes.  Except English, I failed last year.”  Dean glanced sideways at his passenger, about to re-ask what was eating him about his age, but Cas spoke over him.
“He will probably need his memories taken from him, sir.”  The spellcaster said quietly. “I had to make him sleep just so he would stop attacking us, even before we got him off the hooks he managed to knock out Faerly.”
Dean stood beside Bobby, heavily panting and feeling like he needed to puke, and patted a shaking, thankful hand on the old dragon’s back for his excellent timing. He didn’t think he would have been able to get up after falling with such an injury, which was a recipe for disaster.
Castiel was nervous but determined during the car ride to school that morning.  This was it, today was the day.  He was finally freed from that stupid sling and he was ready to do the thing he and Charlie had been planning since Saturday afternoon.  Today after school, Castiel was going to catch Dean Winchester before he left and ask him to be his date to the Valentine’s Day Dance.
“You’ve wronged me, Samuel Campbell.” Dean declared, an honorable opening move to a less-than-honorable duel against a family member. Then he began to duel in Castiel’s name.
“Do you plan to release me, Robert?” Samuel roared in response, plenty loud despite his muted furnace and bleeding lung, shaking pointedly and uselessly against the weapon that pinned him. Blood poured down his front and the bright blade sliced ever deeper into the dragon’s warm flesh as he thrashed.
Dean looked a bit embarrassed.  “Well, it’s your little brother’s fault, really.  I have home ec with Sam and Alfie and we were making spaghetti and meatballs.”  Dean unpacked the lunch containers and sat one in front of Castiel.  “And your brother put
Crowley looked back to Castiel, frowning at something he didn’t let the rest of the dragons see; the omega boy’s eyes were slowly being ripped from his head while Crowley removed his curse. Blood that shone with the color of Samuel’s scales poured down Castiel’s cheeks, carrying bits of flesh on their bright current. Crowley’s magic mopped it up before it fell from his chin and he didn’t let the lad scream; a necessary action, cruel though it may be.
Anna’s was wrapped in bright red paper, while his mother’s gift was in a plain box with a small bow made of green satin.  Dean made a light trilling sound that sounded like curiosity as Castiel examined them.
“Try and touch me, dear princess.” Crowley instructed, and, remembering this game from her childhood dueling training, Claire raced forwards.
“Will you sleep beside me?”  Castiel asked, ignoring the fact that he was completely surrounded by Dean at this point.  Dean moaned again and settled his head down in the grass so that his jaw was laid out beside the angel’s bedroll.  Castiel laid on his side and ran his fingers over the bumpy scales on Dean’s top lip.
Castiel’s eyes widened and his breath caught in his throat.  His anger evaporated as he realized what he’d done, leaving him numb with shock.  He couldn’t seem to take a breath and his arms fell down to his sides, useless.
“It’s an ‘I’ll think about it’ you pushy fool.”  Kali pushed on his shoulders and he held out his arms to help her gracefully slide off the stage.
“My heart aches for the loss of your kinsman, clever elf.”  The king said, somber as he looked down at his glass of ale.  “I beg of you, tell me the fallen’s name, so that songs may be sung of his sacrifice and his memory live on.”
A light bulb went off in Dean’s head and a real smile found it’s way onto his face.  “Oh!  Right, hi!  Sorry,”  He laughed nervously, but she was still smiling at him, so he guessed he was already forgiven.  “In my defense you did look pretty familiar.”
“Not at all.”  Cas replied, taking off the blankets and standing.  Dean stood and wrapped the blankets that had been in their lap around Cas’s shoulders and wished his friend good luck.
Crowley squinted his eyes at Gabriel and raised an eyebrow in his traditional ‘I’m watching you’ look.  Gabriel grinned, thinking of the Christmas-wrapped office and returned the raised eyebrow as the principal walked away.
“It’s not that- I am proud of him, really.  But I don’t want him to get hurt, he’s not even five feet tall, Coach!  And you’ve got guys over six foot out there.”
Isn’t this what he wanted, after all?  To be able to move past last week and be friends with Dean?  Didn’t he say last week that he’d be able to forgive Dean for scaring him and throwing him against the wall?
Rowena smiled and brightly said, “Such a troublesome student you’ve taken, Crowley. I’ll take him from you, if you’d like, you’re a busy man and Castiel will need near-constant attention.” Again, Crowley shook his head, though he knew his mother was merely teasing him again.
“Normally health students just tape ankles and wrists, stop nosebleeds, and treat minor sports injuries. You’ll be doing all that and spotting.”
Castiel squeezed Dean’s waist, joy and fear battling in his stomach while his face lit up at the nickname Dean used for him. He felt afraid, but breathed evenly and remembered his dragon mate’s spark-laced promise; Dean would ensure no one touched him.
“So, Cas, there’s a lot that you need to know.  I told you I wanted to tell you everything, you deserve to know everything before you make a decision.  And I expect you’ll have a lot of questions and need some time.”  Dean paused and Castiel raised his head to look at him.  Dean was glaring at his hands, which were in his lap, anxiously folding this way and that as he thought of what he wanted to say next.
at the age of nine. It had been a quick death, and so close to adulthood; less than two, maybe three years away.
A split appeared and slowly widened between the doors, and Castiel watched with a mixture of fascination and awe as two dragons became visible.  One large dragon pushed each door open, their thick-as-tree-trunks legs straining and muscles visibly bunching in an effort to move the massive pieces of stone.  The dragons pushed the doors until they were fully opened, and inside Castiel could see a huge, cavernous room that looked as if it could house his entire island.  At the far end of the room, which was so far away Castiel could barely see him, stood a human man with dark hair. In the cavern wall behind him was the firelit entrances to several small tunnels, and Castiel imagined the tunnels led to the very heart of the mountain.
It looked less like a mating bond and more like the two of them half-lived inside the other person’s body. Castiel blamed it on dragon magic, and decided to think about it later. Mid-debate was no time to deconstruct someone else’s private bonds.
“I haven’t decided yet.  I close tonight, so it depends on how late it is when we get out of here.”  Gabe looked up when a man behind the counter called his name.  “Got to get, guys, have
, before speaking. “That was awesome, Dean! You’re in! Ha! I haven’t heard that kind of talent since I met Michael Mills!” He babbled on for a few more minutes while he led Dean back into the main choir room and supplied him with his own choir folder and sheet music.
Claire gasped when she heard her uncle’s tired, sarcastic, and snippy reply. “Fine and dandy.” She shared a relieved look with Rufus, who patted her shoulder kindly before walking away.
When Castiel finally calmed down, he leaned forward heavily with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands.  Dean had given him a handkerchief, the light green silk one from the front pocket of his suit.  Castiel gripped the wet fabric in his hand and focused on taking deep breaths.  Dean’s hands still held him, one on his shoulder and the other sliding over the back of his suit jacket.
Castiel looked in the direction Anna gestured, spying a rib cage among the red-hot embers of a dying fire before turning back to his soldiers.
Dean placed himself between Castiel and Samuel, who jumped to his feet with his sword drawn, and the dragon prince glared the older man down. Dean was roaring inside his chest in a wordless threat for Samuel to make a move in retaliation, and though Castiel was holding Gecko back, the tiny dragon was also roaring in Castiel’s defense. With one hand, Castiel quickly patted his palm against Dean’s shoulder, marking his fiance as his second. The motion made Samuel’s eyes flash and his sneer fade into a frown.
“Our views on imperialism differ, and we’d prefer to stay out of the world’s quarrels.” Castiel said. “Also, we’re waterdragons, and this area doesn’t have access to the sea.”
The dragons hadn’t stopped at all for the night.  Castiel had the feeling it would be too much to hope that they would stop before the sun rose again.
“That won’t be necessary, Castiel.  Your mission will be the only thing to delay your travels.  Once it is complete, you are free to do as you please. Send word back with Uriel, and know that the grace of the forest follows you wherever your journey may lead.”
Dean had been whisked away by one of his bosses to meet someone that Castiel could only assume was a very important someone.  The move left Castiel alone to chat with a small group of housewives that looked every bit as uncomfortable with the finery of the party as Castiel was feeling.  While Castiel wished his husband was by his side, he couldn’t help but think he’d found his niche among the partygoers.
“He didn’t say good morning.”  Claire called over, and Castiel immediately felt foolish.  “He asked what you thought of the mainland.”
“I didn’t realize there were enochian words I haven’t seen before.” Rowena said slowly, and Crowley dropped his hand, letting the woven runes fade.
A pile of books were waiting for him on the tabletop, but they would have to wait in turn behind the one Benny held in his hands. He handled it carefully, mindful of his prince’s trust in him with it; a large, leather bound tome, heavy with the weight of countless words, sparks, and forbidden knowledge. King John’s hunting journal.
“Yeah.” Bobby breathed, his voice barely audible as he admitted to his weakness. Dean lit his spark and directed it at his uncle, pulling the pain away from Bobby’s back so Bobby could weave the connections in his spine together without the distraction.
The little bird had a decent breath of fire, at least in Benny’s opinion, yet odd that he couldn’t feel any heat from it.
The small dragon fascinated Castiel immensely, it’s scales were the color of cream with just a touch of pink, and it was so small that Castiel thought the dragon must surely still be a child.  Castiel thought it might even be small enough to fit into his bedroom back home, provided that he widened the doorway first. The small cream-colored dragon stood close to Jody, but came closer to Dean and Castiel when it saw that Castiel was looking at him or her.
“It’s hard to explain.”  Claire said slowly. “If he had messed up the spell, even a little, then you could have been, oh, what’s the word, Dean?”  Dean clicked out a few words, and Claire shook her head.
Dean gaped but nodded at least twice, shocked at his omega’s fierce concern, but pleased that the angel didn’t hide his feelings simply because they were mid-duel and at the center of attention. Castiel’s measuring eyes didn’t leave the (hopefully subtly) preening dragon prince as the room shook around them.
Dean’s back blossomed with warmth and Castiel leaned heavily against his mate, covering his head and face in his warm hood as he shivered. He pressed his frozen fingers against Dean’s back as he shuddered and shook.
Uriel raised his chin, a sign of respect among the elves.  “It takes a humble and strong commander to act as you are, Castiel.  When you leave the army for your own travels, the elves will lose the greatest general we have ever had.  It will be my honor to share my knowledge with you, together we will surely return home with the prince alive and the garrison untarnished.”  Uriel turned and raised his voice so the whole of the garrison could hear.
Dean’s next ragged intake of breath filled his furnace with frost. His spark couldn’t keep up with the bleeding anymore, there was too much damage, not enough in place anatomy-wise for Dean to go on, and he definitely couldn’t work his healing magic through all the acutely-lit
The blonde boy straightened up quickly, then took one look at Dean and smiled hugely. “Dean-O? Is that you? Man, look at this beauty!” He patted the roof of the impala affectionately, the stick of a shiny sucker between his fingers. “Whoever owns her is a saint, the inside is
After thinking it through over the course of a few more coin tricks shared back and forth between the two dragons, Dean decided that he didn’t want to refuse a real witch, especially since he just wanted to talk to his dad. Dean caught the witch’s eye, though the boy already seemed to be aware that Dean had set his spark, and the prince raised his old man’s hand. He set The Light in his mother’s badge to flowing properly, not half-lit like the boy’s fingers had done. Dean sighed despite himself, fearing this was a really bad idea even as he placed his wizened hand on the boy’s mess of witchy hair and infused his words with his spark and his mother’s; “
“Eighteen is the age most angelic parents allow their children to start drinking, Jody.” Castiel quickly reassured her. “We aren’t overdoing ourselves, and I can assure you it’s nothing my mother would object to me partaking of.”
“They have a new pie,”  Cas announced, his eyes down, “pink lemonade with blue cotton candy whipped cream.”  Cas made a face and said ‘that sounds disgusting’ at the same time Dean said ‘that sounds
That’s what it all came down to: Dean’s family was broke.  The Winchester boy wasn’t about to get into an Ivy-league college or take over a respectable business after high school.  Dean’s after-graduation plan consisted solely or restoring and selling classic cars.
He’d always thought of the healing spell as a one-spell cure-all, and the only limit to what a spellcaster could heal was their own talent.  But maybe dragon magic wasn’t as alike to his own angelic magic as he thought, and healing had a familiar glow no matter what kind of healing spell was being performed.
The knowledge that she had betrayed her mate and her angels proved too much for Rowena’s spark, which was already dimmed from fighting and endlessly weaving for so long. When Rowena of MacLeod fell, it was her twin sons who took their mother back to Earth. With the three of them gone, John’s forces were effectively abandoned to their fate.
“Do you want some punch?”  Castiel asked, speaking over whatever Charlie was about to say.  He didn’t wait for her answer before he stood up and walked briskly to the refreshments table.
“Dean drew first blood against Azazel Knight.” Sam’s eyes grew huge while John continued, “I want you and your sister to go stand at his side. I’ve spoken to Azazel and I don’t think he’ll do anything until we speak again, but who knows what some of his family members might do.” The king sighed and looked at his son seriously,
Everyone in the room, advisors, generals, and servants alike, all looked to their Lord.  The breath of the world seemed to be held baited, awaiting his decision.
They were rude and objectively cutting, despite being completely untrue; Castiel’s father could fly extraordinarily well, thank you very much. King Charles had also led the angels throughout the war, and then single-handedly rebuilt their civilization with only a couple hundred remaining adult angels to care for and raise the scores of war-orphaned angelic children. It struck a certain nerve in Castiel’s spine and soul to hear his father spoken of in such an uncouth manner; the angelic King had raised his garrison from draconic fire and was forced to leave the dead in the ashes after the fall. He’d single-handedly salvaged what little magic and culture angelkind had left of themselves, then started over completely; tucked away on a tiny chain of islands the dragons were so
Dean didn’t see a teacher at first, and had to ask a student if the instructor would be back soon. Turns out the ‘student’ he was talking to was the teacher. Mr. Fitzgerald’s smile reached from ear to ear as he greeted Dean and shook his hand, but frowned when Dean told him he was scheduled for this class.
He and Dean were standing amongst the dragons that had accompanied them since leaving Castiel’s homeland, along with two new dragons Castiel hadn’t yet met.  There was a large one with scales the color of unsweetened chocolate that stood next to Bobby, it was a bit taller than Bobby at the shoulder, and had unusual spikes poking out at its elbows.  It had its back to Dean and Castiel, so the angel wasn’t able to see many details, save for the criss crossed lines of scars across its sides and back. The other dragon was tiny, it was several feet shorter at the shoulder than Dean and a full tail length smaller.
“He’s grown close with princess Claire, their laughter carried through Claire’s sealing spell.” Benny murmured, softly updating prince Dean while the prince settled on a stretch of floor in front of Claire and Castiel’s bedroom door for an
“Do it again.”  Dean commanded, watching closely as Gabriel brought up three more suckers in quick succession.  Dean accepted the sweets and once again placed them in front of Castiel, then grabbed Gabriel by the scruff of his shirt and started patting him down.
would Dean Winchester want Castiel Mills?  He was nothing but a friendless loser who had ate lunch alone every day until Dean had come along.  Dean was everything Castiel wasn’t.  And Castiel had wanted him, oh god, how he’d wanted him.  Now he knew, though.  Castiel would never be good enough for someone like Dean.
And what a thought that was. It put a wide, silly smile on Castiel’s face, and remembering that dragons could smell pheromones all the time, he quickly focused on studying bonds again.
Castiel’s book kept him occupied through the late afternoon.  Reading in Dean’s palm wasn’t the most comfortable of reading nooks, but it wasn’t the worst, either.
Castiel settled down on the floor of the cage instead of in his hammock. He pulled his lantern from his duffle bag, which was stowed in a pocket on his back, and with a word it lit up the inside of the cage with a soft reddish light.
“Hello, Earth to Dean.”  Gabriel snapped his fingers in front of Dean’s face, jerking Dean out of his trance.
Castiel beamed and his wings rose quickly to wrap Dean in a hug at the thought, already looking forward to his first visit home. Though he’d been gone less than a week, not even the time when he’d agreed with Anna to send home his first letter, he found himself missing his island more sharply than he’d thought possible. Dean hugged him back, as if he understood Castiel’s loss of island completely, and Castiel’s expressions schooled when he noticed Dean’s sharp eyes on him.
At his dragon’s call, the smallest of the angels took a hesitant step backwards, though all three of them watched on with wide eyes, and the scent of fear was thick in the air.
“I’m fine, really.” Dean insisted as he rubbed his face and once again started eating his meal. “I just haven’t had the chance to get some sleep since you slept under my wing after the demon attack.”
“I have a full decade on Claire.” Castiel reminded his friend with a kind smile, despite thoroughly putting his foot down on the subject. Castiel wasn’t a heavy or even an everyday drinker, but he wasn’t about to be denied it altogether. Jody nodded and begged their pardon, then quietly excused herself.
“Ready?” Dean asked, his warm hand and arm a solid anchor for Castiel to rely on. Castiel squeezed his fiance’s bicep and shook his head in the negative.
Castiel gripped the elf tightly.  “You are a good elf, Uriel, and your actions were not your own.  Do not let this be your last act.”
Dean made his old man laugh, a musical sound in the hushed hall. To hide his discomfort and to have something to fidget through his anxiety with, Dean pulled a silver penny from his pocket and flicked it through the air with his left thumb. It launched in a high arc across the length of the bench just to disappear a split second before the boy caught it confidently in his right hand, and the witch frowned when he opened his fingers and found them empty.
“No, one of the other ones who came to collect him.” Charles said, then reassured his wide-eyed wife, “It's a young dragon, the dark blue one that stood beside the dragon prince. But don’t worry for Castiel; his bond with the dragon is pure.”
Castiel stayed close to Dean as the dragon prince tossed the huge, black Impala into Benny’s waiting hand. Castiel saw Benny raise the sword high, but didn’t see it land. The angel’s eyes were only for his mate as Dean leaned back on his knees, eyes wide and his nose crushed and bleeding, clawing at the collar with long, half-shifted dragon fingers.
The sun was lowering itself behind a low line of clouds.  Soon Castiel’s eighteenth birthday would be behind him, along with his already retreating childhood, his family, and his island.
“Tell you what, you can stick your head in there and while we wait for King John, and I’ll continue my nap under the shade of your fat ass!”  No sooner had the words left Castiel’s lips when one of the friends of the soldier Castiel was slowly advancing on struck him across the back of the knees.   Castiel’s legs buckled and the soldier pushed the elf to the ground. Castiel jumped up almost faster than the eyes of the humans could follow and used magic to break out of the metal cuffs with a flash of light.  Castiel grabbed the wide-eyed human that hit him by the scruff of his tunic and punched him in the stomach. Though Castiel had pulled his punch considerably, the human still grunted loudly and feel to his knees, gasping at the air like a fish pulled from the sea.  Castiel took half a moment too long to worry over the well-being of the fragile human, and the elf was grabbed ‘round the middle and pulled off his feet. Castiel growled and barred his teeth as he struck the earth, his shoulder stinging where it had taken the brunt of the fall, and kicked and threw elbows back at the man that held him from behind.
Charles ordered his garrison to leave the dragons be and give them plenty of space. Not willing to be foolishly trusting in John’s son, he asked General Uriel to keep a constant watch over them. With his wife and Michael by his side, Charles carried his people’s returned lights to his home.
“Let’s try it now, then.” Dean suggested, and smiled at Castiel’s dramatic gasp. Castiel nodded excitedly, and Dean felt his face flush with heat; this was going better than he could have possibly hoped.
“Peace, peace.”  The elf chided, finally raising his eyes and focusing on Castiel’s face.  “I believe you. Thank you for saving me from whatever the fallen one did to me.”  The two exchanged a small smile before the first keening song of mourning filled the air.
“Two months.”  Anna said sadly, leaning heavily into Castiel’s side.  “So soon. And you’re still so young.”
“Y- yeah.”  Castiel said softly, looking again through the front doors where Dean disappeared around the corner of the building.
Castiel thought of the dragon prince. Like a bold, beautiful, cocky alpha male that Castiel wanted to hiss at to ‘
Castiel laughed softly, “Thank you.  How’s the play coming?”  Castiel people-watched while he munched on his cookie.
“I had to rent my trumpet from the school. They take sixty bucks and give it back when you turn it in.”
As Dean drew his weapon, so too did the three dragons surrounding Castiel. The angel felt his feathers rising and jumped slightly when the next voice shouted over the roars.
Castiel had worked out routes to each of his classes that avoided Scott and all four of his friends.  The only reason he’d run into them today was because Dean had popped up at his locker before lunch and made him forget his chemistry book.
“Well, your arrangement is a bit different from theirs.”  Charles said, and Castiel heard his mother scoff quietly.
It wasn’t Benny’s place to refuse or even thank the dragon for the gift, so he merely took the small, black, paper box with a nod and said, “I will see that he receives it, Lord Crowley. How long do you expect Prince Castiel to sleep before he wakes?”
“So you were ashamed of me.”  Castiel said softly, hugging his chest to keep his ribs from falling apart.
Claire watched impassively as her uncle held her silver blade above his head, looked up, and after aligning it with his furnace’s
The last sentence made Castiel’s blood run cold. He’d been led to believe that waterdragons were something of an enigma to their northern cousins. How was he supposed to pass as a waterdragon to someone who had actually met them?
Baker and Davis ran first. Dean stood near the starting position with his hands on his hips while he eyed his new competition. It was one of the boys who had lead the stretches, the dark haired one. He stood about two inches taller than Dean and seemed to have no fat on him anywhere, as opposed to Dean, who still had a little baby fat on him. Mills didn’t smile or look at Dean at all during the first couple’s race or while they readied themselves on the starting blocks.
Dean chewed on his lip, debating on if he should say what he wanted to say.  But no, he chickened out.  “Do you want some hot cocoa?  Or coffee?”
“Are you okay, Cas?” Dean asked, his voice rough from Ruby’s strangling. Castiel nodded weakly, unsure how well he actually was, but no longer fighting against the absolute certainty that he was dying. He felt Crowley holding him up by his armpits while Dean released him and turned on the spot.
“No.  I was only thinking about myself.”  Dean whispered, then took a deep breath and continued in a regular volume.  “I was having a difficult time with showing you affection in public.  I’ve never had any real feelings for a guy before, and you probably know that I don’t like being the center of attention.  And I’m not gonna lie, being with you was hard, Cas.  People were always staring at us when I walked you to class, or when I sat next to you at lunch.  It got to me, I was a coward and you deserve better.”  Dean paused for a moment, then continued.
“Was he british?” Sam asked quietly as the two crept closer to the open door. As they passed by, they couldn’t help but look inside. And once they’d caught a glimpse, they couldn’t help but duck inside to take in the view.
Not wanting a constant reminder of his children’s betrayal, John lit his spark to remove the window from his office. The lack of sunlight left the room dark and lit only with weaves again, and John shook his head as he read through the weaves left behind from the day’s magic.
Gabriel squinted, using his magic to look at something. Charles wondered if Gabriel, his most magically talented child and the most advanced magical scholar of all the living angels, would be powerful enough to find and see Henry’s death. Charles hoped so, the angelic king had long wondered what happened to spark the dragon war. If Gabriel found it, maybe Charles could identify the enemy of both the angels and the dragons.
, his scent, was all Benny’s, though in time he planned to share this with Dean. Benny treasured his
“Gabriel’s hurting, help!” Hael shouted, only leaning her head into Anna’s bathroom long enough to speak before leaving. Anna ran to her bedroom and found Hael on her knees at their brother’s side. Gabriel was shining like a lighthouse, the light from his skin was much more radiant than Anna’s. Hael’s wide eyes turned to Anna as she flew to them.
Inside the box was a satiny bag and a folded-up note.  Castiel sat the box aside and read in his mother’s writing;
His eyes rolled around in his head, and he was just about to faint when got a good look at Crowley’s evil-looking eyes before the dragon’s fingers pushed up his borrowed hat and covered Castiel’s forehead.
rough of a sport.”  Gabriel pushed the bar and opened the door that lead from the athletics hallway into the parking lot.  “Where are you, anyway?  I’m free now.”
The taller boy nodded once before turning again for the door and all but running out of the bathroom.  Castiel felt a little confused as he tried to put a name to Dean’s behavior, then mentally shook himself and rushed back to class before he could give Mr. Metatron an excuse to add an hour or two to his detention assignment.
“Gabriel, see if you can hide your brothers’ lights.” Charles asked, barely managing to raise his voice above a whisper. He frowned while he watched Gabriel struggle to convince Michael’s dragon to stop shining his light through his angel’s skin.
When Rowena finally met the King, Henry was still a young man. If he hadn’t already been well-mated (not to mention far too young), she thought she might have pursued him, for his spark was stunning to say the least. Once Rowena saw Henry’s smile while his spark was lit and weaving, she understood how a boy could have joined the thirteen species of dragons.
Dean caught every animal that scurried, flew, or oozed around the abandoned tunnels for Castiel to see, and Castiel fed his newfound friends pinches of dried meat from an oversized hunk that was given to him by Benny to hold his growling stomach over until they could stop and eat. Castiel complimented the animals before sending them on their scampering ways; all except the first, the one Castiel had said looked like Dean and sounded like Benny. That one Castiel called Gecko.
“And on what grounds did you take your leave?” Bobby asked next, throwing an exasperated hand out in front of Dean to prevent his alpha posturing from becoming a full attack.
“Lady Ruby of Knight is in your dungeon, my king.” The tiny man gasped out. His hands shook and he tended to his wounds for a moment longer before losing consciousness and falling limp against the floor. His body automatically disappeared a few seconds later, vanishing into his cage along with the pool of red angel blood. John lit his spark to stop his prisoner’s bleeding.
“Why would she retreat?” He asked, drawing closer to Dean though he’d already been clinging to the dragon prince’s neck and shoulders, and it was Dean who answered him. He spoke just a touch louder than Benny, though still soft in the silent hall. Castiel was so close he could feel Dean’s chest vibrating as he said,
And just like that, Castiel and Jody’s bond settled and held firmly within the bracelet at Castiel’s wrist. No exploding sparks, no fuss, and no threats of violence; just a loving bond and a strong sense of companionship.
The students were completely silent. Dean felt his cheeks heat up as he looked at the dozens of bored faces, he gave them a half-smile before being directed to find a seat. The only empty desk was front and center. Wonderful.
“I’ve never been so clumsy.” Castiel admitted with an annoyed huff, just before he tipped to the side. Benny caught him around the waist again, though his quick moves and bulky shield nearly made the dragon topple forwards into Dean, who nevertheless got a sharp
Two of Castiel’s soldiers stood inside the open door, watching as a third bent over the still, naked form of the human prince as the spellcaster stitched his flayed-open skin together with magic.  Castiel could barely believe the amount of blood that was splashed across the walls and soaked into the dirt of the shack. It was far too much for one human.
There was a few moments of chaos as the students gathered their belongings and started for the door.  Castiel grabbed his backpack and looked around for Dean, spotting him just as he was walking out the door, already deep in conversation with Gabriel.
“Where is the prince?”  Castiel grunted in the human’s tongue.  Singer finally straightened his back and lead Castiel and Uriel to the one-room farmhouse.  Castiel looked around once inside; the humans had given the stone walls a new roof and were using the building as a command center.  A table stood in the center of the small space, with a map on its surface and more figurines placed along the border of Winchester. A small fire burning in a low fireplace was the only source of light in the tiny stone room.
“I never wanted you to stop talking to me, you know!”  He called as he crossed the lawn.  “I don’t know why you felt you needed to promise my brothers
Dean held the ice up to Castiel’s lips, and Castiel heard his dragon’s breathing hitch when Castiel leaned forward and took it into his mouth. His eyes met Dean’s, the dragon was looking at Castiel through pupils so narrow they were hardly visible.
for a while, see his parents, eat his mom’s cooking, play dumb board games instead of watch tv on his phone, sleep in his old bedroom.  It’d be a good distraction to the shitstorm that was his life right now. He might even be able to clear his head a little, figure out what to do next.
Castiel slipped his hand in his pocket and checked his phone, he had felt it vibrating earlier and had ignored it.  He had two missed calls from Charlie and a text.
Mills changed tactics after the race, smiling at Dean and holding his hand out, squeezing like he was trying to break bones when Dean shook it. “Michael Mills. It’s a pleasure.” He didn’t sound like it was a pleasure.
Dean laughed, soft and relieved. “Hell yeah, Cas. Not just that, you kicked her ass. You angel birds are as cool as they say.”
I’m mad that you spent a week making me feel like you wanted to be with me!  You hugged me and held my hand, walked me to class and kissed my head every day and I really thought you
“I like the star dragons, Father.” Uriel said with a smile. “Thank you for teaching us how to talk with them.”
“I knew I recognised that girl!”  Kali rolled her eyes again, but the small smile on her dark red lips was worth making himself look like a fool.
He hadn’t missed a day of work, hadn’t gone and drank an entire liquor store.  Instead, he’d stayed home, lied in bed watching Netflix on his phone and not thinking about anything.  Especially not thinking about Cas. He hadn’t left the house except to go to work. His kitchen was running low on basically everything, but he couldn’t really find it in him to care.
“Our father has forbidden me to speak on it.” Sam said carefully, so he wouldn’t unintentionally light his own spark with pain. “We were in his office, so I can’t very well just disobey.”
Gabriel hung out in the bleachers of the gymnastics gym during his free period before lunch, working on homework, doodling in his notebook, and occasionally watching Castiel do a routine.  He laid on his back on the bleachers and chuckled at Dean: he was so serious about being a spotter, constantly shifting his weight with his hands up at his waist as if Castiel would fall during a simple routine on the rings.
(and what looked to be the undoing of Ruby’s share of Rubeus’ spark). Crowley lit his spark and reached his arm through his hold and snatched a scale from Ruby. It was a large, thick, squarish scale, stolen from her shoulder as she wailed for her fallen child, whose unaccepted death may yet be the woman’s downfall.
“I’m, uh, new.  We just moved here over Christmas break.”  Dean could hear Cas opening and closing doors upstairs, and fervently wished he would hurry.
When Castiel pulled back from their hug, he didn’t pull away completely. He left his wings circling his friend’s wide shoulders and his hands resting on Benny’s collarbones. Looking at his friend and his obvious concern for Castiel, the angel realized his tattoo wasn’t actually what was bothering him the most.
Castiel remembered the glint of the knife as the demon tried to sink the blade into his chest and shuddered.  “Those things don’t live in the mountains of the dragon's homeland, do they? I think I might not like living there if I know those things are running around.”
“It’s fine.”  Castiel assured his betrothed, “It’ll be back to normal in a few days, and I don’t have to do any flying until it’s feeling better anyway.  There’s no reason to make a fuss.”
He’d looked at her with wide, pained eyes and as he shook from cold and blood loss. With a mournful call of his dragon, Fergus promised his mother that he had long known that, and that he forgave her for it. He didn’t apologize for deceiving her, which Rowena thought was wise.
“Thank you, thank you Crowley, thank you.” Dean chanted, his voice distraught and his hands steadying Castiel’s head while it rolled. “Talk to me, Castiel.” Dean swallowed loudly, and his voice was strained as he said, “Cas, buddy, how are you feeling?”
“We aren’t hungry.”  Claire assured him. “And we need to get on the move.  You can eat in Dean’s hand.”
“Why are you crying?”  He finally asked, his eyes going back to the red, puffy eyes of his best friend.
His dragon, Castiel’s claiming touch said, something Dean was all-too happy to oblige his angel mate in.
“Castiel, I need to talk to you.”  Michael said, standing over the two friends.  It was odd to see him without Lucifer standing at his side, even for Castiel.  The two barely separated, even at home they seemed joined at the hip.
Bobby huffed an amazed laugh, and said, “I don’t think that even John could unravel this weave. I’d bet he’s trying, though.”
“These really make your eyes shine.” Jody remarked as she added a dab of glue to the dull backside of a scale.  “I had hoped Owen would be a good color for you.” She smiled warmly at Castiel as she placed the scale on his forehead and held it in place for a long moment.
Gabriel knew it was Kali’s week to read announcements.  One could hardly miss the dark-haired beauty when she was broadcast to every screen in the school, he just liked to mess with her.
Castiel just gave him a sharp look, squinting at his face through the dark, and shook his head and scoffed as he said ‘shift’ like it was a highly-dubious curse word.
“A gift for Prince Castiel once he wakes, and stays awake.” Crowley’s voice said, and Benny kept his mind on his scent and on the sleeping angel in his arms when he turned to the Head of the Southern Hold. He didn’t like the unsettling smile on the old, witchy dragon, and Benny’s alpha dragon growled lowly at the witch who’d marked both his mates, though deep below Benny’s furnace to keep quiet.
mate with one arm and cradled him for real. Dean smiled at Cas’s wide-eyed expression as he was lifted off his feet, and Dean’s furnace roared with pride, love, and joy when Castiel got comfortable so they could talk while he rested safely in Dean’s arms.
Charles was tucking Uriel into bed when they came. He didn’t hear the call immediately, as it first rang out on the smallest and most distanced of the angel’s islands, so Charles had a few quiet moments with his young son before he found out that dragons were surrounding his people’s chain of islands.
“Ah, firebreathing lessons. What an excellent way to pass the time.” Benny said approvingly, his chest ringing deep and strong with dragon-bell sounding laughter that echoed long after his more humanlike chuckles had faded.
Crowley had no care. The bitch had crossed a line when she touched their son’s corpse with her spark.
dead. You’re Dean’s shield, you’re his mate. You matter to Dean so completely, and I can’t understand why Dean’s own grandfather would try to ruin Dean’s happiness.”
When he heard Benny’s voice echoing in his head again, it was (oddly) the most natural feeling in the world;
Dean had choir next; he had a hard time finding the choir room; it was tucked away into the very back corner of the school behind the auditorium. A large group of students were already on the risers with folders full of music when he walked in.
The rushing in Castiel’s head and chest was building to a crest, and his stomach threatened to empty from the pain. Castiel felt like Crowley was pulling several long, thin wires out of him; they tunneled through his chest and arms, and pushed against the inside of his skin when Crowley pulled them up his neck and under his cheeks to exit through Castiel’s eyes.
“Okay.”  Castiel said shakily, feeling like his heart was deflating.  Even though Dean liked him, he didn’t want to be seen with him.  Castiel couldn’t be with someone who was so ashamed of him, no matter how strongly he felt about Dean.  Castiel was starting to wish he’d stayed inside and watched Charlie and Dorothy dance.
“He did.  He meant it, too.”  Claire told him. “And Samuel told Dean he’d already fucked up, letting you get hurt in the first place, that Dean’s father wouldn’t approve of him acting all high and mighty about who fixed his screw up.”
“No, I decided to pick my battles on this one.”  Dean said with a small sigh of defeat as he locked the front door.  “The last thing I want is a crying baby to start off the night.”
Charles looked himself over for a long moment, then turned his eyes away from his damaged two-legged form to instead admire the stars. They held a more brilliant, hopeful view of the future than Charles’ ragged hide could provide.
“How many seasons are you?”  Castiel hoped the question wasn’t too forward, the grunting language of man left little room for the courtesy of the elves.
Castiel leaned forward and held his face in his hands.  He felt as if he were about to die of shame. He’d never used anything like his mother’s gift.  He’d only used his fingers a few times, in the very worst stages of his most intense heats. He wasn’t even sure that thing could fit inside him.
“Somebody likes you.”  The dark-haired boy said with a grin as he straightened up in his seat.  Dean couldn’t help the nervous bubble of laughter that escaped his lips when he thought he saw Cas bite his bottom lip as he glanced down at his desk.
Not knowing what else to say and mentally kicking himself for possibly offending Dean, Castiel turned his gaze towards the two humans.  Rufus was attentively turning the skewered rabbit carcass, while Claire watched him work with her chin resting on her palm. The early morning would have been eerily quiet if not for the crackling of the fire and a few birds that had woken up early singing their tunes.  No one in the group were speaking to each other now that Dean and Castiel had fallen silent; the dragons stood like shining statues in the morning sun, barely even moving, and the humans in their charge were quiet and unusually still as well.
A certain word, spoken by Dean, caught the angel’s attention. He bit his lip nervously while he asked, and didn’t move his eyes away from his fiance’s still form.
“Mr. Mills, may I ask what you’re doing?”  Said a familiar voice with a bit of an accent.  Gabriel sat up and smiled broadly at the principal.
Ruby scowled at Dean and yanked him roughly by the chain and collar around his neck, forcing the dragon prince to his hands and knees. With a quick, shiny arc of her dueling boot, Ruby kicked Dean’s face with a solid
Castiel thanked a wide-eyed Benny and he moved his hand to the bracelet with the intent to remove it. He planned to tuck it away, knowing he wasn’t ready to wield it just yet, though he had a feeling that moment was quickly approaching.
It seemed that someone, in the true spirit of Christmas, had wrapped every little thing inside the principal’s office in Christmas-themed wrapping paper. Dean looked up; Lord, even the ceiling tiles were individually wrapped. The brothers stifled their laughter and scrammed before they could get into trouble before their first day even started.
Crowley rolled his eyes, but gave his mother a soft smile then turned back to his office desk. His tone turned sharp and professional; “There’s much to do. Castiel won’t last long without his light, and I half-expect John will banish me before the week is out for protecting him. Are there any affairs you’d like me to settle on your behalf?”
The ‘be happy’ part of the blessing was a staple any time Dean was asked to bless someone’s kid or something. It made the world of dragons a brighter place, and the boy smiled and laughed delightedly, his body and voice suddenly so expressive that he reminded Dean of his angel Castiel, who was a joy to watch laugh.
“We will leave at once, human.”  Castiel said, wishing the indelicate language held room for softness of voice or empathy in tone.  “If he is alive when we find him, I can promise you we can speed his recovery and he will be whole again.”
“Too fucking bad!”  Dean said, and yeah, he’s still shouting.  He took several unsteady breaths, trying to calm down, trying to prevent the tears that were threatening to spill and trying to keep his hands from shaking.  “You don’t get to take off on me, Cas! You don’t get to leave me hanging for a damn
Charles’ hands were shaking as he raised his hands and rubbed his face, wiping away tears and thanking the
“Thank you for helping Bobby, Uncle Crowley.” Claire whispered, not trusting her voice while she cried. Crowley gathered her in a quick but firm hug and whispered pretty promises of Bobby’s well-being into her ears.
Naomi sighed and her smile faded. With a frown, she fidgeted as she said, “It’s just that, I was chosen to be his wife because of my skill in magic. I’m not of noble birth, I don’t have anything to offer Charles but this one thing, and my tutors won’t teach me the things I want because they say I’m too young.”
“Good morning, Dean.”  Castiel said on the off-chance Dean had said what Castiel thought he’d said.  He was glad they were finally on the ground. Maybe now Castiel could have an actual conversation with Dean, since they’d been denied the chance yesterday during lunch.
Castiel had the bill of his borrowed hat pulled low, he held the edge of it right down to his chin. It protected his eyes from dragon butts and protected his blushed face from scrutiny. Though at this point, he was just thankful he hadn’t been caught stupidly ogling Rufus’ scars and tattoo.
“My fellows!”  The king called out.  “The elves of the North forest have heard our plea and lent their hearts to our cause!  Let us know the name of the one who hails from the forest!” King John held an outstretched hand to Castiel and the elves, and the valley hushed while they waited for the elves to speak.
Benny watched Castiel silently; insult or not, he found his furnace in need of a restart from the wave of frozen fear he felt for the tiny thing’s life.
,” Castiel hissed, leaning away. The pain in his lips lasted only a moment, and Castiel felt Dean flinch under him as his unbearable heat instantly, dramatically cooled.
“Delicate way of putting it.”  She mumbled back, glancing over her shoulder at Samuel.  Dean clicked a word or two out and Claire nodded.
Castiel’s parents had tried to help, by limiting screen time to daylight hours, limiting caffeine and sugar, even sending him to talk to a ‘professional’ a couple of times.  It was beyond frustrating, especially when people said things like ‘well, maybe if you put down your cell phone, you’d be able to sleep’.  Like, thanks, Sherlock!  Maybe he would try that after letting his parents spend another hundred bucks to let him chat with a child shrink.
During the match, the entirety of the wrestling team had drawn close to watch, and Dean found himself getting pats on his back and shoulders from about half the team as he walked out of the circle and grabbed Gabriel’s water bottle to take a long drink. Dean’s mat was the only one still on the floor, so he helped Gabriel and Billy fold it and stow it in a closet behind the bleachers with the rest of the mats before giving Gabriel back the foam earmuffs.
Dean ran his hands through his hair, pulling roughly at the hair on the back of his head.  “I don’t like this, Sam.”
“You had seven ready children before Castiel left.” Samandriel said. “I’m ready to take on Castiel’s duties so you’ll still have seven, father.”
“Claire, did you hear what Dean said to me just a moment ago?”  Castiel asked as he passed the human the waterskin.
tossed and turned in Benny’s arms, and murmured crossly under his breath at his dreams or anything loud enough to echo through the dark of the abandoned
, Crowley?” The prince demanded with an angry roar, as if his anger could distract from the thick smell of fear on his scent.
“That’s enough, Castiel!”  Mr. Metatron shouted, slamming a hand on Castiel’s desk.  Castiel met the teachers eyes again and tried to keep his courage up despite his shaking hands.
“Okay, okay.”  Gabriel said loudly.  He had to physically hold Sam back from wailing on his brother.  “Say, guys, can’t we all just get along?  Sam, I’m damn proud of you for making JV.  Dean is proud of you too, he’s just acting like a jerk ‘cause he’s worried.”  Sam didn’t look convinced in the least, but he at least stopped trying to punch his brother.
For a week, he’d pushed through it.  He’d walked Cas to every class, carrying his books and backpack with one arm and had a hand on his back or shoulder with the other.  He’d given Cas hugs in the hall and lavished the boy with attention and it was what Dean had thought he wanted.  But when faced with a choice, easy or hard, Ashley or Cas, Dean didn’t want to rise to the challenge anymore.
Rowena hated that boy for deceiving her, though he seemed to know exactly what he was doing with his lies. He was even shielding his brother, Rowena’s favorite, from their mother’s lifelong hate. She would have fought tooth and claw for her precious angels if she had only known the full story.
“Okay,”  Dean grinned easily, “we’ll try to get it done tomorrow and we’ll finish on Friday if we need to.”
Castiel’s vertical tutelage tattoo sat perfectly between the arching curve of the bracelet edges, and the bracelet felt right at home on Castiel’s wrist. While it was weightless, it felt monumentally heavy, especially if it meant Castiel was to duel beside Crowley.
“Dean, this is Charlie Bradbury, Charlie, this is Dean Winchester.”  Though a bit confused, Dean smiled and tried to interpret the casual way Cas had a hand on Charlie’s shoulder.
, the boy that had Dean questioning everything about himself and had him daydreaming about wide, strong hands all week.  This was the guy who listened to soft music and showed his gums when he smiled.  The one who worried about Dean not wearing a hat when it was cold, who fussed over his shirt collar in the mornings in the parking lot, and looked at Dean like he was the was the one who hung the moon.
“Have you ever tried distance running?” Coach Singer asked as Dean leaned forward with his hands on his knees trying to catch his breath.
Dean shoved his leftovers in the pocket of his jacket with enough force to crush the taco shell and followed Gabriel to the door.  They kept their heads down as the wind threw snow into their faces while they crossed the parking lot.
“Huh.” Charles huffed with a delighted laugh, reading the inscriptions along his thigh. He stood straight and inhaled deeply, and when he exhaled through pursed lips the angel blew white fire on his breath. Though fire filled his office, nothing burned under Charles’ heat, not even the papers on his desk or the feathers on the angel king’s wings. He admired his fire’s light for a moment, then Charles was crying; sobbing over previously-forgotten wrongs.
“I’m just glad that you’re okay.”  Dean said after a moment, bringing his head up to its normal height.  “I would never forgive myself if you had sustained any lasting damage.”
Once Castiel’s tears had truly seemed to end, he reclined against the palm of his soon-to-be’s hand, his booted feet propped up against one of Dean’s curled fingers.  Wind whipped his hair around and ruffled his feathers, the howling of it so loud that he doubted Dean would hear his words even if he’d wanted to speak to the dragon. Once he calmed down a bit and he’d guzzled some water to try and lessen the headache that was sure to be coming from crying so hard for so long, Castiel sat up and peered out of the gap between Dean’s thumb and foreclaw.
Castiel glanced at Uriel, who looked just as concerned as the general felt.  “Show me.” Castiel said, raising a hand to the tracker’s forehead. He waited until she nodded her consent before he touched her skin with two fingertips.
“I’ve never flown this high.”  Castiel said conversationally on the off-chance Dean would be able to hear him.  He waited a moment for a low moan of draconic reply, but when none were forthcoming he sighed again and looked towards the horizon.
Rowena’s dragon laughed at that, though she kept the sound of draconic roars deep inside her stomach so she wouldn’t scare the tiny cherub. Rowena’s voice was kind as she said, “Naomi, I’ve only just met you and I can already tell that isn’t true.”
“Dean, you don’t have to apologize for that.”  Castiel gave him a stern look, though he felt some of the effect was lost because of the 7-inch height difference.  “I’m just grateful you caught me.”  Dean still didn’t look convinced, so Castiel elbowed the taller boy’s arm.  “Thank you for catching me, Dean.  You did good.”
As much as it made him feel like a hatchling, Sam couldn’t stop his hands from shaking. He let Charlie twine her fingers through his and pull him along at a run behind her. They left their opponent’s fallen form where it lay; dragons converged and stripped the body of meat and valuables before they’d run far enough for Sam’s spark to be able to ignore it.
“Good, good, I’m glad.  Well, Castiel, I’m sure you’re wondering why I’ve called for you.”  King Charles said quickly, his gaze travelling to Castiel’s mother as he spoke.
In those early days, ‘witch’ was a term of reverence and respect, and Rowena was treated as the daughter of an earthly god, wanting for nothing. It was her mother’s spark that ensured Rowena grew up kind, though she was taken by the Terrans when Rowena was still a hatchling. Rowena spent her youth learning magic, both from her father and from the rest of the MacLeod dragons, who as a people were very skilled with weaving their sparks to their will.
It was quite a long-winded speech, though Castiel didn’t have a clue what he was saying because the two people who could translate were busy preparing dinner.  When Dean finished he hung his head low, well within Castiel’s reach, and blinked his huge eye slowly.
“Be serious, Dean.” Jody’s voice said with the weight of The Light behind her. Dean glanced over, and saw Jody’s badge shining on her chest. She wasn’t about to let this get ugly, not for anyone, not until it could be heard by the full court. Dean didn’t press on but relented, naming the next best thing. He settled a wide hand on the small of his omega’s back, trying his best to soothe his mate. This suggestion could actually stick.
“Thank you, Cas.”  Dean said, once again turning serious.  “I don’t deserve a second chance at being your friend.  Thank you for at least considering giving me one.”  Castiel’s lips tightened into a line and he nodded sharply.  Dean flashed him another half-smile and turned towards the parking lot.
Castiel was caught by a pair of sure hands as he fell, and despite the dragon prince’s lack of air, Dean quickly sprinted away from the duel’s frontline with the angel held bridal style in his arms. Castiel’s head rolled back listlessly and he found he couldn’t move, couldn’t even breathe. He felt like his blood had frozen solid.
As an added bonus, Castiel preferred the gym during his down time because of a small group of sophomore boys.  The group of friends enjoyed giving Castiel a hard time at every available opportunity, but they wouldn’t dare mess with him while he was in the same room as Gabriel.  Even if his brother didn’t know Castiel was around per sey, his presence gave Castiel some deeply-needed peace.
Benny agreed with a deep, ‘to Castiel’ and the dragons threw back a quick mouthful each, and grimaced around bright red fire after they swallowed.
Charles lit what faint light his body was building, and he struggled to remember more of the war through his sleeping dragons’ memories. He half-remembered/half-watched his own short-lived attempt at fighting in his
Castiel stiffened when the big red dragon took a step forward and dropped his massive head down to Castiel’s height.  The dragon looked the angel up and down critically for a long moment before stepping back and uttering a series of clicks and groans.
“General, the tracker returns.”  Uriel said, looking out at the blazing fields.  Castiel followed his gaze and saw the three elves.  Their tracker, Dina, and two guards they had sent with her were carefully making their way back to the garrison.
Dean said firmly, and didn’t waver as the thing took a long moment to work the thought through its pea-sized brain.
The only audience he had were the sharp eyes of Dean and Benny, and neither of them seemed to be looking at him with any disdain.  Castiel startled slightly when Dean let out a musical fluttery noise, and the angel laughed at the toothy grin on his soon-to-be’s face.  Castiel corkscrewed in place and Dean made the musical noise again.
She tried it again. Now, before her heart could completely freeze over. Her tiny spark flared as hot and bright as the unhatched babe could flare it, but even with all her might, the tiny Lilith’s mind gave way to the cold after a few quiet, desperate hours of struggling. To regain her strength, Lilith would have to sleep. She wondered how many years or dozens of years she would sleep this time.
Castiel had his own reasons for basically gluing himself in between his older brothers.  In order to reach the trainer’s locker room, he had to pass by the boys varsity soccer locker room.  After what happened last September, Castiel flat-out begged the twins to walk him to his health trainers class every day.  They had been good sports about it, and hadn’t missed a single day as his escorts since Castiel had made his request.
“Samuel should be removed as Head of prince Castiel’s guard. I nominate his second, Bobby of Winchester to take his place as Head. Samuel’s proven slights will be addressed when we complete our mission.”
“King John.” The dragon king heard a very familiar, though unusually dignified, voice say. John turned to look at Charles and the three angelic men approaching at his heels. John nodded to his old enemy, the motion a sign of fellowship and peace among the dragons, though John wasn’t sure that Charles would recognize it as one.
Dean nodded, eyes glued to the winding road.  “It’s just me and Sammy, Dad left us here so we could have some stability.  His job makes him move around a lot, and the next few month were looking like they’d be especially hectic.”  That was true, Dean’s dad was a hunter and he moved them around constantly.  Normally, Dean would go with his dad on hunts, but when his father caught wind of a demon, he’d left his sons behind to keep them safe.
What Castiel didn’t mention about his and his siblings’ close call with the boat was that Gabriel had used his magic to instantly freeze half the bay.  The boat had been frozen in place, which had been the only reason Castiel had enough time to escape.
“Samuel, answer the damn question, man!” Bobby roared when Samuel merely scowled now that the angel had been entered into the duel as a third. “You sent Rufus and Benny away, why?”
” Dean declared, letting his dragon roar its mating claim deep beneath his furnace. Dean heard Benny echo his claim, even a bit louder than Dean, though thankfully marking himself as Dean’s second instead of challenging him for Castiel. The prince sent a fiercely thankful bond towards his
Dean nodded.  His eyes were still wide with fear.  But he could do this, he’d done this all evening.  And it
And the party was fine; all of Dean’s bosses and co-workers were perfectly polite to Castiel, and the many trophy wives in attendance all adored Jimmy.  Dinner was served in a large room, then later the drinks were served out on the balcony. The city looked beautiful from nine stories in the air, and the cool breeze was fended off by numerous fires burning behind metal grates.
The magic was viscous, as if it were a living thing in the air around him, something that Castiel was inhaling with every breath and making him feel the very essence of fear. The temperature around them dropped suddenly, as if they were once again standing outside in the wind and snow. Unable to stop his shaking from fear or his spastic shivering from cold, Castiel at least tried to be discreet about leaning into Jody’s arms for protection and warmth.
“I have a gift for you, Prince Castiel.” Benny said. He retrieved a small, black box from his open bag, saying, “It’s from Lord Crowley, though he wished for me to call him your ‘uncle,’ a term of trust used for an older dragon when one accepts their tutelage.”
to this. He checked Claire’s spark in his friendship charm, thinking he’d used it all up and it had bleached his fire white, but Claire’s spark shone just as brilliantly as before, whole and overflowing from the cage despite Castiel’s use of it. Castiel’s hands were shaking even as he ran.
then that he liked the strong navy blue dragon, and decided that he’d like to become friends with Dean’s right-hand man. Castiel held a breath while Benny chuckled again, a deep striking of dragonic notes reverberating from his unassuming chest. Castiel rubbed his bonding bracelet idly with a fingertip as he grinned at the sound, wondering if someday he could make a friendship bracelet for himself and the gentle, ringing giant.
The king had to restrain his two-legged form from rolling his eyes at the notion of a bird on his father’s throne. He already knew what the coming conversation would entail, but Fergus’ introduction was almost too absurd for John to take seriously. It was only the presence of Azazel that kept John from openly laughing at the Head of House MacLeod.
“It is surely a pleasure, Lord Samuel.”  Castiel replied, and the red dragon nodded once before turning back to Castiel’s father and chittering at him.
Castiel was staring at his friend with wide eyes. He could feel a slight pinch in the back of his throat, and it took him several tries to get his voice not to crack when he said, “I’m glad we’re friends, Benny.”
Their eyes met, and Castiel’s smile widened. He couldn’t help but wish that Dean’s fire-hot kisses would find their way over to warm his lips next. He blushed at the thought.
Benny glanced at Castiel and took a deep breath before he replied; “Dragons’ bones are made of a special steel. If lightning gets into our furnace it can stop our hearts. If the lightning is especially strong it can disturb sparks, and a dragon cannot weave magic or keep a lit furnace fire without a spark.”
Idk, maybe I just didn't understand omegaverse lore well enough going into this, so if that's not what happens to a nose blind person, please let me know.
“Did you bring something to sleep in?”  Claire asked, and Castiel nodded. He had to force himself to his feet, the last thing he wanted to do was to leave his source of heat.  He pulled his bedroll out of his trunk and laid it out on the ground.
“How old is the little one, dear?” Sam was small for an eleven-year-old, even smaller for a high schooler, and judging from the way the lady was looking at Sam, she already suspected he was too young. Dean hoped they wouldn’t look too closely at the transcript he’d made.
A grand set of doors opened for them, and they were met with a bright light that made Castiel blink a few times and squint before his new eyes were able to adjust. The dragons stood shoulder to shoulder in a sea of faces, and with a quick glance around Castiel realized they had been brought into the dining hall directly onto a raised platform. A doorman announced their presence; first as Dean the crowned prince of Winchester, then Samuel the lord of lakes and head of house Campbell, then Robert the Great Weaver (who Castiel guessed was Bobby) then finally it was Castiel’s turn.
The angel king’s eyes and the space between his parted lips flashed with white light, as Charles looked after his son through the pages of the world. When he came back to himself, after nearly a ‘week’ away that seemed only a moment to Naomi, Charles found his body terribly weak and his light nearly dimmed to nothing. He collapsed, and was dependent on his wife’s strong grip on him to lead him to a chair.
Dean silently changed clothes and followed the crowd into the mini football field/track room and joined the group as two guys that looked like they could be twins lead the class in stretches. After the group stretched and jogged five laps, Coach Rufus blew a whistle and started calling out names to separate them into groups.
“Gabriel Mills!”  Gabriel shut his mouth and snapped his head to the front of the room, where the band director was standing with his arms crossed looking one hundred percent done with dealing with a huge classroom of students.  “Thank you for joining us, Gabriel!  Since you
“It’s so cold here.” Castiel said lightly to Claire a few seconds later. Benny’s heart broke for a moment, while princess Claire tilted her head in confusion at the young
His lungs straining, Castiel swung his sword at Ruby’s throat, for collaring and treating his mate so cruelly. He danced in and out of Ruby’s reach in an instant, and unable to bear it any longer, he released his breath and let time resume its normal pace. He’d missed beheading the dragon lady, but the way Ruby
After several minutes, Castiel began striking more than blocking, and Alastair was losing ground quickly to the general’s ferocious attacks.  As if sensing he wouldn’t last much longer, the demon abandoned the sword to free his hand for magic. Alastair threw his sword at Castiel, the attack was unexpected and he barely managed to get his shield up in time.  The force of the sword striking his shield dented the thick metal, pinning Castiel’s arm into the curve of the shield.
“Cas,” Dean said gently, a hand falling lightly to the angel’s shoulder. He looked at Castiel with a smile crinkling the skin around his green catlike eyes, “you’re surrounded by friends now, so it’s okay to admit that you’re afraid. But soon it’ll be time for us to go and greet our enemies. And we can’t let them see or smell our fears.”
He found out at sixteen, two days after his first heat had faded, on the day that the first of the letters arrived for Castiel.
“Yes, good.  He told me a little about what happened last week, and I know that you liked him.  He owed you an explanation and I’m glad he was man enough to do it.”
The bell rang, and Castiel sighed.  It was two thirty, time for choir.  He really didn’t want to see Dean, but he knew his brothers, mainly Michael, wouldn’t stand by and let him skip the rest of the school day.
Castiel capped his flask and tucked it away in a magic pocket around his neck, its opening settled on the string next to Anna’s painting of their island. He held an open palm over the pocket’s opening as Dean gave him a slight, one-armed squeeze.
The wind outside was brutal.  It bit at Castiel’s exposed skin and stole his breath away, and there was no escaping it.  Even if Castiel tried to hide from the wind by not straying far from Dean’s bulk, it swirled around the dragon and found him easily.  It took Castiel a few moments to fight the cold to open his eyes and look around, and when he did, he felt as if he might go blind from the brightness around him.
The food was delicious, of course. Castiel couldn’t fault a single thing. The sweetbreads were delicious, tender and creamy, the way they should be. The richness of the accompanying madeira sauce and the subtle nutty flavour of the celeriac served with it created a balance of flavours that was practically obscene on Castiel’s tongue.
Castiel managed a smile, despite being chastised. “Understood,” he said meekly. “Are you sure you’re okay to drive me home?”
Castiel was handed off to custody once they got back to the precinct, and Dean and Benny both went to shower and change into clean clothes. Plain clothes, since they’d finished their beat and were now officially off-duty. Dean brushed off any objections Benny raised about his arm and made for his desk and soon as he was able, clutching an evidence bag containing Castiel’s ID as he looked up the address.
Dean’s voice came back casual, but Castiel knew him well enough to know that Dean was inherently curious. “You are? What are you doing there?”
“I guess I’ll just have to keep my fingers crossed till then.” He teased. “Let Charlie know if you’d like to order dessert and I’ll whip you up your own Winchester special. Enjoy your meal.”
Dean’s face lit up like a Christmas tree and he jumped to his feet. “That’s great, Cas! I’ll call the number on the flyer first thing tomorrow and find out about the application process. See, this is why I love you. You’re the best, man.”
Castiel stared down into the bowl and his heart lurched in his chest. “Thank you,” he whispered, not finding the words to express how grateful he was for Dean’s kindness.
didn’t take the time to contact the faculty members whose space you were taking to let them know in case something changed. The way I see it, we’re both to blame.”
Charlie slid his cup across the counter and disappeared into the back. Taking the tea, Castiel felt his strength wane and he practically fell into the nearest chair. He sipped slowly, closing his eyes and taking slow breaths as he savoured the spiced liquid.
His sweetbreads arrived in record time, of course. Their arrival was preceded by the opening of the kitchen door and a tall, outrageously handsome man exited. He was dressed all in white, a white apron tied around his waist, and he was clutching a silver platter.
It was just a sarcastic comment, a friendly joke that Castiel had been made the butt of. Normally he’d be the first one to laugh that off. But today he didn’t want to. Castiel had been looking for an excuse to crack skulls all day and now he’d found one.
Dean’s head tilted down and rested on Castiel’s shoulder, a flare of warmth in the cold, cruel world they lived in.
“I know, Cas. I love you too. C’mon, let’s eat this sushi. I even got extra of that gross wasabi stuff you like.”
“Cas,” Dean’s voice was warm and Castiel’s eyes crinkled at the sound. “We’re on our way back, you at the Bunker?”
There was a sigh and then Castiel swung himself up onto the counter next to Dean. His eyes were averted at the change in topic. “I know what you’re gonna ask,” he muttered. “You’re right, we do need to talk about it. That’s kind of why I bought the pie. You’ve been really patient with me and I thought it might put you in a good mood.”
Still, it was only for a few years. They would both get through grad school and then he could pursue his career goals. Then the only car he would ever have to fix up was his Impala.
Castiel could pinpoint the exact moment that Benny registered his comment and was done with him. There was no verbal cue, but the guard holding him began yanking him away, back inside the building. Sparing a glance over his shoulder, he recognised the guard as Mr. Singer. He was one of the decent ones.
“I’ll take you up on that.” Castiel somehow managed to carry the box up the stairs and into their dorm without needing to take a break. He set it down at the foot of Dean’s bed and rolled his shoulder, recovering from the burden.
Fists grabbed the front of Castiel’s cravat, but the gesture was not an attack. Dean stared at him fiercely, and Castiel fell silent, knowing that this wasn’t some trick or play on Dean’s part. Something had happened, something that had brought Dean back to him after so long.
“Yeah, I know. But I’m sure you can say ‘no’ occasionally. We’ve had this reservation for weeks. It’s Sam’s birthday tomorrow, and I was –
“I love you,” he sighed. “I’d ask you to marry me but I wouldn’t want to interfere with your ten-year plan.”
He cut off Dean’s attempt at reciprocating the sentiment with a kiss, that was soon followed by the kiss that marked the beginning of the rest of their lives.
“I just do. If he wanted more, he’d have asked me out after learning more than my name.” Castiel shrugged, and then sneezed violently. And then again.
“Oh, sugar,” Benny said kindly, though his voice was gruff, hiding the array of emotions he had to be feeling. “You and I both know this was a long time comin’ and didn’t have a damn thing to do with crêpes.”
“I’m good at my job,” Castiel amended, quietly. “It’s what I love to do. I’ve always cooked for myself. It makes me happy.”
Dean rolled his eyes and slid his arm around Castiel. “So, I’m a jackass now? Gotta say, I’m starting to feel a little unloved here, Cas.”
He shouldn’t put that on Castiel, but it was hard not to feel like he was being abandoned when all he was trying to do was move their relationship forward. To him, Castiel was his future. Dean had been in love before but never like this. He could see himself walking down the aisle with Castiel. Could see them growing old together in this very house.
Castiel didn’t move. “I don’t think that’s a good idea. For a cop, you have very little common sense. What if I robbed you?”
Castiel took the opportunity to close the distance between them in a single stride, capturing Dean’s lips in a tentative first kiss. It wasn’t exactly the gift he’d planned to give Dean that morning, but his heart had always truly belonged to Dean and it was more than time that he made that abundantly clear.
Dean shook his head, his anger fading as quickly as it had appeared, replaced by a resigned sadness. His eyes were averted, and he seemed to be avoiding Castiel’s attempts to catch his eye. “You’re wasting time. And you’ll never make it out of the city without me. I’ve arranged passage out of Paris, from there you’re on your own.”
Castiel hid his own widening smile by taking a small sip of his wine, peering at Dean over the top of the glass enigmatically. “Perhaps not,” he conceded. “Let me rephrase. Which is your favourite of the dishes? Say if you were to bring a loved one here, a spouse maybe. What would you recommend they order?”
“I know,” Dean breathed, burying his face in Castiel’s hair. “I forgive you. We don’t have to talk about it anymore.”
He licked his lips, not sure how to break the awkward silence that had fallen between them, but thankfully he didn’t need to. Claire chatted enough for all of them, telling Dean about her friends and her schoolwork and telling Castiel about the types of cake Dean made for her birthday.
Holding his hand out, Castiel takes the photograph and squints at it for a long moment. “Huh. I had no idea there was even a picture of this. I was a few months premature, I was hooked up to machines for like… maybe two months? I was in and out of the hospital a dozen times before I was six months old.”
“It’s a tonka mousse on a dark chocolate crumb base,” Dean volunteered, before he could ask. “It’s on the menu, don’t worry. I didn’t give you any special treatment. The only difference is that the glaze is usually pink.”
“So then take him up on his offer,” Gabriel pressed. “It costs exactly one night of your life and then he’ll never bother you again. If you’re so sure you’ll have a horrible time.”
“Dean,” Castiel cleared his throat when his words came out even more gravelly than usual. He didn’t want to give anything away.
Dean nodded curtly. “Wait here.” He disappeared and Castiel didn’t have the energy to see where he went. He just sipped his tea, feeling his strength slowly return thanks to the sugar Charlie had kindly added.
“And how are things going with Anna?” Castiel asked, teasingly. “Have you stopped avoiding her yet?”
He left the apartment, slamming the door behind him and stalking down the stairs. He would regret storming out later, he already kind of did. Of course Dean understood, Castiel was tired of feeling like a burden, like he was freeloading. He’d busted his ass off all through college, balancing work and school, and now they’d moved back to Kansas and he couldn’t get a job. It was hard on them both.
Castiel wound himself around Dean and melted into the embrace, not answering the question. Dean just held him tightly, stroking his hair and waiting until Castiel felt able to speak. “You want to sleep in my room tonight? Just sleep, I promise. You don’t have to sleep out here on the floor.”
Castiel smiled sadly. “I know. But I can’t stay here forever. I think this is the right thing to do.”
Dean laughed and set the plate down, letting Castiel have a more thorough look at the dishes. “I’m not sure you’re supposed to tell me that.”
Benny went through the pack. There was nothing of interest, no drugs or contraband. Just a few hastily packed items of clothing and a wallet. He plucked the ID from the wallet, looking at it for a moment.
Castiel’s hand on his arm is warm, an unconditional gesture of friendship and affection. Dean is torn between shrugging it off and covering it with his own. In the end, he does neither and just leaves it there, giving a shaky nod.
Anxiously, Dean checked the coatrack and saw that Castiel’s trench coat wasn’t hanging up in its usual place.
For a moment, it was heavenly. And then he remembered why he’d been reluctant to open the door in the first place.
The faculty Christmas parties were always set the night of the last day of finals. Everyone was stressed and needed a reason to unwind, students and professors alike. Castiel usually attended but left early, uncomfortable with the crowd and the heat. He wasn’t exactly a social butterfly, but he did like to show his face and socialise with the other members of his department for a short time.
Dean let out a shuddering breath and he began pumping his length faster, finesse forgotten in favour of his arousal at Castiel’s words. Castiel whimpered as he sped up to match Dean’s strokes, wishing he could reach out and touch him. But Dean hadn’t come closer, and that was obviously for a reason. Not that Castiel was complaining exactly, there was something hot about Dean being
Dean focused on preparing meals for other tables, letting thoughts of the pressure created by having a food critic in his dining room slip from his mind. He worked steadily, and he worked hard. He adhered to the same standards he set for his staff, it created respect and made it easier to recognise when demands were unreasonable and when people were slacking.
“No, I don’t want that,” Castiel shook his head, and lifted his hand. Somewhere during their memories, their hands had met and entwined. Even amidst the knowledge they weren’t destined to be together, they had clung to each other. Comfort, familiarity, love.
Dean nodded. “They’re coming here next. The victory has given them confidence. Not immediately, good men were lost and they plan to mourn. But your name was mentioned. They’re stopping all exits out of the city and then they’re coming. You don’t have long.”
Castiel snorted at the teasing, rolling his eyes with good-natured exasperation. “I can eat that pie myself, you know. I bought it, I can just as easily take it away.”
Dean nodded and the corner of his mouth turned up. He couldn’t quite manage a smile, but they were trying.
Dean drops the photograph. “Cas,” he chokes out, tears swimming in his eyes. “Cas, fuck… look.” He doesn’t know how to react, how to feel with the wave after wave of relief and happiness and regret washing over him.
Dean let Benny drive them back to the precinct, while he cleaned out the wound on his arm, treating and dressing the wound as carefully as he could. It was shallow, not more than a scratch really. Even so, he couldn’t stop his gaze from flickering to the back seat as he kept a close eye on Castiel.
“Ah, yes. I’ll have the veal sweetbreads to start, followed by the roast pigeon.” Castiel handed his menu back over and leaned in. “Listen, I’d appreciate it if you didn’t mention that I was here. This is supposed to be an anonymous review, after all.”
“We’ll figure it out,” Dean promised. “You can come home with me for the holidays, my mom has been dying to meet you and Sam will love you. You’re both big nerds who read too much. We’ll make sure you get a job and you graduate with full potential. We’ll make it work, Cas, I promise.”
Dean pushed open the door to his room cautiously, hesitating once he saw that half of the room had already been claimed and that the bathroom light was on. Not wanting to just walk in unannounced, he cleared his throat as he let the door swing closed behind him.
storm into my office again and yell at me when I’m with a student, I’ll file a report with your Department Chair. Do you understand?”
The bartender holds out a bottle of whiskey, an eyebrow raised. Dean looks down at his empty glass and then pushes it forward with one finger.
Dean sighed and took Castiel’s hand, squeezing it gently. “I know this isn’t the fix you wanted. I know you want a job so it’s not all on me to keep a roof over our heads. But honestly, I’d rather work two jobs and let you have a bit more time to find a job of your own than move in with my mom and put pressure on her. I can manage my time for now, I’ll make it work.”
Sighing, Castiel picked up his drink and weaved his way towards Anna, stopping her with a pleasant smile and a polite greeting. She looked stunning, in a forest green evening gown with accents of gold. It contrasted with her flowing red hair beautifully.
Dean swallowed his food. “You were scared. I might not have all the answers regarding your situation, but I don’t need them. I don’t think you’re a bad person and I don’t think you’re a criminal.”
Castiel’s smile widened, gummy and brilliant, and his eyes crinkled at the edges. “I can do slow,” he promised. “Can I still stay for the crêpes?”
“Cassie!” Balthazar greeted, enthusiastically, pulling him in for a tight hug. Castiel got the impression that was not Balthazar’s first drink of the evening. “Just in time. We’re set for a wonderful party this evening, we invited the Applied Sciences department to join us in thanks for letting us take over their building for the last month or so.”
