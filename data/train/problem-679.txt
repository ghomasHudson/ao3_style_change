John grinned and sat down in his chair. Carefully, he untied the small knot holding the tiny documents together. He plucked the oldest one up, out of habit, he supposed, and turned it in his hand.
John burst out in exasperated giggles. Sherlock looked mangled and hurt, clearly shocked by John’s response. “I’m the vacant one?” John managed through the laughter. “Me? I’m dull?”
John had suddenly gone from being by his side to standing, frozen, in the middle of the ring of people. There were easily a hundred watching in, waiting for him to move. Everyone stared, voices gone, whispers subsiding, phones out recording, and John stood, looking like a deer pinned by the headlights of a Volvo SUV – certain of imminent doom. Sherlock panicked.
He laid each folder out on the table, feeling the nervous twitch crawl through his leg as he began to tap his foot against the carpeted floor. He couldn’t help but notice how much nicer Marylebone was in comparison to this small theater. He was about to deduce the history of the building when the first candidate took the stage. Sherlock rolled up his sleeves and opened the first folder: Mary Morstan.
Jane felt her lips parting, and then clamped her jaw shut. John had forewarned her about his ability to deduce. “Yes, actually.”
Sherlock fell to one knee and encompassed one of John’s hands in both of his. John’s eyes grew huge on his face, a perfectly typical expression of absolute shock claiming his features. Sherlock smirked.
“Is that what you say to everyone you bring into your bed?” John turned to face him, smug grin on his face. Sherlock feigned offense. John turned to face Tito, fishing his mobile out.
Now. I normally do all songs first. Today, I am putting them all at the end, because SPOILERS, SWEETHEART. So don't cheat, read it all first, then listen. :)
“I think he’s just tired. We’ve had a rough week of practice. Probably just dehydrated.” Molly glared at Callum and raised a disbelieving eyebrow. Right she was. She knew of all the teammates, John was the doctor and one to diagnose. She wasn’t an idiot. Molly was perceptive enough to know there was something else hiding behind John’s eyes. And maybe Callum would mention it later when the two crawled into bed together, but John didn’t care. He knew no matter what was said, it would be fine. It was all fine. Right now, he didn’t want to think about it.
A loud, burst of sound left John’s mouth. It startled Sherlock, who found John with a hand clapped over his mouth, obviously trying to stifle another strong urge to laugh.
“A week after you left, Mycroft came to 221. You know he never does this, and therefore I believed it to be a conversation of importance: a new case, something to do with our parents, you know. Something dull, but unfortunately significant.” John pushed farther back into Sherlock’s chest. A large hand raked through his hair. A content sigh escaped the doctor’s lips. “He sat on the sofa, I wouldn’t allow him to sit in your chair, and he told me he was concerned.”
"I killed her, Sherlock. I fucking killed her," he blurted into Sherlock's chest, hands now clinging desperately to the thin layer of cotton. "She's gone because of me," he whispered. Sherlock ran a hand through John's hair and kissed his forehead, making note of the ache thudding away mercilessly in his own chest.
“No, but when I was little grandmother hosted a lot of parties so the house was always busy,” Oliver said, pushing open one of the doors. “You can stay in this room.”
The ringer buzzed and Oliver sighed, closed his notebook and went down to let Emily in. John stayed out of the way, while they went about what they usually did. John planned on writing about the failure of a day he had, and the odd feeling he had in his stomach the whole time. Maybe getting it out could help him sort through his conflicting emotions. He brought his laptop to the desk in the living room, rolling his eyes when the teenagers already started snapping at each other.
Harry waved her hand. “I’ll be fine, it’s barely a five minute walk from here. Besides, I like the snow.”
Oliver thought for a moment, pushing a cooked carrot around on his plate. “The school has an astronomy club I joined. Every few Saturdays we meet at the park and stargaze, the club leader has a really nice telescope because his dad works for the UK Space Agency. Oh - but John bought me a telescope for Christmas, so now I can work on astronomy at home with more accuracy, which is awesome, and -”
That night he had another nightmare, of Sherlock rising from his grave that day in the cemetery and dragging John into the coffin, trapping him for eternity. He shot awake and resigned himself to another sleepless night.
It’s been half an hour since Oliver sent a text to Caden and Emily, asking them to come over. Just waiting for them made him antsy, he didn’t want to sit and do nothing with John and Sherlock and their awkward brief words. The air in the flat radiated tension and discomfort, making him restless. Finally, he heard the knocking on the downstairs door.
“Don’t say stupid things, of course I want you here,” John said, looking away from Sherlock, who looked a little embarrassed. “We’ll figure it out.”
John shut his eyes and breathed deeply through his nose, trying to calm the swirling tide of emotions that stormed his chest. A moment later there was a soft knock on the kitchen doorway, and John opened his eyes to seeing Mrs Hudson standing there.
He froze when he saw Oliver, squatting in the middle of the floor, his arms wrapped around his legs and his forehead pressed onto his knees. He struggled for breath and with each forced exhale, John could see his entire body shaking. Panic attack. John hadn’t seen Oliver actually have one before - he usually locked himself in his room, but he knew what they looked like from experience.
“I’m glad you came, listen, I’m so sorry,” Caden said. “It was the pill we were on, I wasn’t thinking straight. It’s never going to happen again, okay?”
Sherlock sat down at the desk across from John, then cleared his throat. “When we left Oliver here and that lead was a dud… The man that had tipped Mycroft off double crossed him. Mycroft thinks it was part of their plan to get us out of the flat, and lure Oliver to that warehouse. We can also confirm that boy - Caden - is part of the organization. He had been the whole time.”
for this series!! Please show them some love and go kudos their work!! If anyone does art or anything for this series, I would love to see it! Just leave a comment to tell me or message me
Not long after, Mycroft came to pick Sherlock up because there were people he needed to talk to, and things he needed to do. Not just apologies or explanations, but there was still business with Moriarty’s organization, and Sherlock had information that Mycroft’s people needed.
John panted as he crawled onto his hands and knees and rolled the boy onto his back. Oliver was completely limp and pale, his arms flopping to the ground and his head bobbing to the side. His dark curls were flat against his forehead and stuck to his cheeks, instead of wild and full. John held his hand over Oliver’s mouth - not breathing. He put his finger under Oliver’s chin to check his pulse. Nothing.
He grabbed Emily’s arm and pulled her away, hoping Caden would follow. Sherlock turned to look at them and Oliver literally heard Caden’s jaw snap shut when he turned to follow. He yanked Emily down the hall and into his room, Caden right behind them, then shut his door loud enough for Sherlock to know he didn’t want to be disturbed. Oliver sighed and shut his eyes, took a breath, then turned to look at Emily.
“Fine,” John said. “Not now, though. When Emily leaves, we’re going in there and going to try again, okay? He’s going to be here for a few days anyways.”
John came downstairs the next morning after not surprisingly getting almost no sleep. Sherlock had stayed up with him all night while they lay in his bed together, not really talking. Despite this, Sherlock was still out of bed and downstairs before John. After filling the kettle and plugging it in, he glanced down the hall, and Oliver’s door was still shut.
“I was so scared,” John whispered. Oliver felt his heart thud - John worried for him? He pulled away and met John’s eyes. The man looked awful but genuine.
Violet reached across the table and took his hand. “That’s all right, sweetheart. Just be happy with yourself.”
The boy stood tall, but not extremely so - the top of his head stopped below John’s chin, all gangly elbows and knees. His pale skin contrasted with his striking cerulean eyes, big like he hadn’t quite grown into them yet. Thick, wildly curly black hair fell into his eyes and tinted red where the light caught it. He wore a t-shirt that hung off his thin frame and had big headphones over his ears. He stared into the entrance way behind John, his lip caught between his teeth.
The smile took over Oliver’s face, and he ecstatically asked for all the details he could get on the process. John smiled and watched while Mycroft explained some of the legalities, and Sigar and Violet told them they were so glad they could depend on someone they trusted to look after Oliver.
John didn’t say anything to that, but he stood and picked up their empty plates. He put them in the sink and turned on the tap, might as well wash them now since he didn’t have anything else to do. Sherlock stayed at the table.
Oliver let out a huff, the blush returning as he pulled up the collar of his t-shirt to hide his face. This time John did laugh, and Oliver giggled too, looking
(Also, I know a lot of people worry about cliches that happen with OCs, but don't worry, I hate that stuff too. So you don't have to worry about any cringe-y MarySue stuff with Emily. Honestly I just want a rival.)
“Do we have dessert?” John whispered quietly against Sherlock’s ear, his nose tracing Sherlock’s jaw.
He gently knocked on Sherlock’s door, fidgeting nervously with a loose thread on his jumper. He heard the deadbolt shift and the door swung open. John stepped in to find Sherlock padding softly into the kitchen.
“I was just about to take a shower. Alright?” His forehead was wrinkled in concern seeing as Molly raising her voice was a bit of a rarity.
One day after the jam jar had been mysteriously emptied and John had to go out and get some more, he returned to find the skull strangely missing. When John asked Sherlock where it had gone, Sherlock claimed that the thing had a mind of its own and probably was talking with Mrs. Hudson. John had given Sherlock a strange look and went about his business.
“I love you, too,” Sherly murmured. Jen nodded again and buried her face against Sherly’s shoulder. The detective held her patiently and waited for her shaking to subside.
She was warm and comfortable, nestled against Sherly. Jen reflected that she could stay here forever. They were both alive and in one piece, somehow. It made her realize just how important Sherly had become to her. She didn’t know what she would do if the consulting detective died, and it was something she hoped she would never have to figure out. She tightened her arms around Sherly who rubbed the doctor’s back gently. “It’s all right…” Jen nodded in response and took a deep breath.
Sherly watched as Jen made a cup of tea. She sat down in her chair with her cup, leaning back and letting it steep for a quiet minute. Sherly sighed to herself and stood, walking to the kitchen for her own cup of tea. She kissed the top of Jen’s head in lieu of an apology as she walked by. Jen watched her go, cradling the cup of tea in her hands. She was unsure if she was entirely forgiven, but knew it was a promising start.
John looked over to where he had been standing when Sherlock had jumped. He could feel the sharp twist in his chest that he usually felt when he thought about seeing his best friend jump. He sighed and looked down at his feet to see the message he had spray painted there.
Jen took Sherlock’s hand into her own and began undoing the loose stitching. Once it was all undone, Jen cleaned out the small holes they had left behind even though no blood had been drawn. Jen stood and kissed the top of Sherlock’s head as Sherlock wrapped his arms around her waist and put on his best pout face before saying “I was bored.”
Despite having already had a slice of cake, Mycroft decided that he would have another. One for his father.
A small smirk lit up his face as he glanced side-long at John, who was still sipping his tea. Sherlock knew exactly how this particular movie went. They watched as two relatively young men went on a cross-country journey, trying to find some lost city. Near the end of the movie, the two boys engaged in an explicit sex scene in their tent. John ended up spitting out some tea while Sherlock continued watching as though it didn’t faze him (which it didn’t). When the movie was over and one of the boys had died tragically by falling off a cliff in a rockslide (although Sherlock assured John assured John that there was a sequel in which they brought him back, “How dreadfully cliché.”). John asked Sherlock why they had just spent two hours watching that particular movie.
Sherly held onto Jen’s warm weight and stared at the opposite wall blankly, completely convinced that she’d never sleep again. That wouldn’t be so bad, she reflected. Sleeping was terribly dull, and without it, she would have so many more hours in the day to work on cases.
Sherly sighed but kept her eyes open, trying not to think about the pool or bombs or Jim Moriarty from IT. She concentrated only on Jen: the smell of her hair, the warmth of her arms around Sherly’s waist, the security and peace of mind she brought to the detective.
Sherly held on tightly and buried her face in Jen’s hair, breathing in the familiar scent of her shampoo. It was comforting, and she knew that all she needed was to spend the next few days allowing herself to be comforted by it.
Jen’s eyelids drooped and she settled closer to Sherly, murmuring something unintelligible. Soon she fell into a dreamless sleep, although it wouldn’t stay that way for long.
Sherlock sat on the couch with his arms crossed, glaring at the opposite wall. He was in his pyjamas and his robe, bored again with no one around to keep him company. Mycroft was being a prat and had cut off his internet and phone until he learned how to be “mature”. Sherlock would like to tell Mycroft that
Jen returned home from the clinic with the groceries that she had gotten after work a few hours later. She said hello to an intent Sherlock before proceeding to put the food away. When she was finished, she sat down to see what Sherlock was doing. The consulting detective was currently examining his hand, where he had used a needle and thread to sew his fingers together.
Sherly sighed softly. Jen shifted so she was half on top of Sherly. She buried her face in Sherly’s neck, breathing her scent in deeply. She didn’t close her eyes, but it relaxed her some.
Sherly took Jen’s hair down from its unruly ponytail and carefully began stroking through it. Jen’s muscles slowly lost some of their tension as Sherly worked knots out of her hair. She focused on the feeling of the long, dexterous fingers touching her scalp and the scent filling her nostrils.
Jen slowly calmed down and came to lean heavily on Sherly, completely exhausted from the stress overload.
Jen, shifted closer, murmuring. A dream had started, and it wasn’t a particularly good one. She was running through a seemingly endless road until they met Jim in front of a crumbling building. She whimpered, curling up further. She didn’t wake when Sherly held her closer and tried to comfort her. Jim leered at her and she shivered again. She tried to turn around, tried to run from him, but something in his eyes kept her rooted to the spot. In her dream, Jen turned to Sherly, to ask her what to do, to try and find some reassurance in those grey-green eyes, but the consulting detective was gone. Jen looked back to Jim and noticed the body that lay behind him. It was Sherly’s. Jen shuddered in horror as she took in Sherly’s still form – limbs bent at awkward angles, blood pooling around her head. A movement caught her eye and she looked at Jim, saw him raise a gun. There was a familiar crack, and Jen snapped awake, gasping.
Sherly finished eating and then set her empty plate aside and wrapped both arms around Jen’s waist gentle. Jen rested her head on Sherly’s shoulder as she finished her food. The banal noise of the telly provided only a tiny annoyance to Sherly, but she was more focused on Jen’s presence. She was engrossed in memorizing the smell of Jen’s hair, and the warmth that radiated from her skin. Jen lay her legs across Sherly’s, allowing herself to relax and letting her mind wander while watching the telly.
death experience – and she had been so afraid that the consulting detective was never going to be able to hold her again. Jen was shaking slightly and, unbeknownst to her, a single tear slid down her cheek.
Jen stiffened almost imperceptibly and Sherly rubbed her back gently. “It’s probably just Mycroft, we can ignore him…”
As the consulting detective watched the old experiments get thrown away, he was looking forward to the new ones he would soon be conducting… the only difference was that these would be in the bedroom. With John.
was the one being immature in this situation, but Mycroft had disconnected the phone before he could argue his point. Deciding to experiment, he pulled a needle out of a drawer and went to the kitchen to get some string.
Stubbornly, Sherly put her phone aside, but she knew that Mycroft probably would deploy SWAT if she didn’t reply, so the consulting detective picked up her phone and composed a short reply.
Upon pressing the on button, the local news came to life with some ordinary story of a cat stuck up a tree. John was more than content to watch the boring and predictable stories, but Sherlock was not. The world’s only consulting detective stole the remote and started flipping through the channels. He passed by several soap operas, another news station, and a game of football. He flicked past a movie and to a third news station before going back to the movie.
He washed his and Oliver’s mugs, then took a quick shower and got dressed. He actually had an agenda today. Weird. Also good. First he had therapy, and after he’d need to do some shopping. They lasted the weekend with the very little food in the flat (it helped that Mrs Hudson insisted on bringing lunch up to them) but they would not survive the week on takeout and canned corn, unfortunately. They were in desperate need of actual food. He made a quick list of the essentials, then caught a cab to his therapy session.
Sherlock sighed and the couch dipped when he sat down on the other end. The silence came back, and John could feel every single inch between them, sitting like strangers on opposite ends of the couch.
“If I make breakfast, will you eat?” John asked. Saying pleasantries when they never had before would just make everything awkward again, full of hesitation and silence. He couldn’t stand it. Sherlock knew it to, and John hoped he would try to act normal if John did.
That was a good idea. Oliver had obviously thought about it before, and if that’s what he wanted, John would try to make it happen. He nodded, “Okay. I’ll see what I can do for you. But you have to promise me you’ll raise your marks.”
He wasn’t going to get there fast enough and John’s head spun with half-formed thoughts as he ran. He got to the rail and looked over, his blood rushing in his ears. “Oliver!”
He became more excited with each word, sounding more awake and more passionate. Violet listened patently, with a fond smile as Oliver told her about the astronomy club, his drawings, and his new school schedule. Sigar encouraged him to talk about his classes, even the ones he hated, but Oliver stayed in a good mood, excited to tell his grandparents about everything that had been going on in the past few months.
Oliver helped, since he was smaller than both of them and could crawl under the beds and sofa with ease, even climb up to look on the bookcase without getting hurt. All three of them were tense during the times they searched, but it was also one of the only times Sherlock and Oliver seemed to tolerate each other.
“You’ll have to introduce us at some point,” Lestrade said. “A child of Sherlock’s must be intense.”
Sherlock head into the shower a minute later, and John worked on repressing thinking about last night. Ten minutes later Sherlock is out and dressed, his black hair still wet and a little frizzy.
John hurried to the doorway. A broken glass scattered across the floor and Oliver’s shoulders looked tense, his hands over the sink.
”. John felt relief roll off him in waves and he stood from the couch and partially stumbled into the kitchen, using a swipe of his hand to push the beer cans on the table into the trash. He bent over the sink, splashing water on his face to try and bring himself back to life. He wasn’t drunk, but he was on his way there and Mycroft would no doubt immediately know, but he might as well make the effort to appear responsible.
On a Friday night he came home, hearing muffled music coming from inside the flat. He pushed open the door and listened - it came from Oliver’s bedroom. A soothing, nostalgic, song played out loud, mainly acoustic with few lyrics. Careful not to alert Oliver of his presence, John stepped softly through the kitchen then the hall and peeked through the doorway. Oliver sat on his bed, leaning over another drawing, the music playing from his phone next to him. It sounded like an American singer, and John smiled, then let him be. He didn’t know what he expected Oliver to listen to - he sort of assumed it might be some loud teenager rubbish or classical songs, growing up at the Holmes’ estate.
The last few days leading up to the end of the month passed slowly, and John and Sherlock decided to start searching the flat every few days, so they might be able to pinpoint a time the bugs are being planted. They found some more, but it was way less than the last time and everyone still looked uneasy after finding them.
He still didn’t want to get out of bed, but he felt gross so he dragged himself up and took a shower. When he had dressed, he cautiously checked the flat, just to make sure John and Sherlock were
Then he swung around and pulled a bottle of alcohol from under the sink and poured a glass, downing it in less than a second. Then another. Then he threw the bottle back under the sink and washed all the dishes.
He threw off his covers and stumbled out of his room, down the stairs and crept through the dark sitting room, then kitchen. John gently pushed on Oliver’s already open door and looked in. The boy was sound asleep in his bed, the covers gently rising and falling with his breath.
Monday, a week after their visit to the Holmes’ estate, John had the day off and Oliver came home directly after school instead of going to his club. John heard the door slam and looked at his watch with a frown. Oliver stomped up the stairs and appeared in the doorway, twisting his rubik’s cube erratically with a frown on his face. He ignored John and went straight to his room, slamming the door behind him.
After I post next week's chapter, there's going to be a SHORT HIATUS. By short I mean it's only a week and a half, just so I have a bit of time to get farther ahead of the updates.
Eventually, he rolled over and checked his phone, relieved and almost… disappointed… to see a message saying John and Sherlock had left the flat. At least he didn’t have to face them yet. There was a message from Emily too, but he deleted it and dropped his phone on the mattress next to him.
I'm asking this time because before when there was French, it was only a line or two, but the scene in the next chapter has a lot. Let me know in the comments!!!
After a moment, Oliver nodded. John raised to his knees, pulling Oliver up with him until they were both standing. Oliver wobbled, placing his hand against the embankment, the other digging into John’s arm.
The call ended and John dropped the phone onto the couch, his head pulsing in pain. He needed a shower and a strong coffee.
John could probably see the anxiety on his face, and he said, “Sherlock and I are working with Mycroft to figure out who was planting them and why. That’s actually why he’s out right now.”
“No,” Molly said. “Not right now anyways. My little niece is with me for the hols; my sister and her husband are on a cruise until January.”
He put it all in a basket, and left it in the living room. He’d bring it to Mrs Hudson in the morning - he didn’t feel like answering her inevitable questions.
! Oliver stumbled over a piece of wood while he backed away. He looked up and Caden’s arm rushed at him, and Oliver doesn’t realize he’d been punched until he’s laying on the ground, his jaw feeling like it’s going to fall off and his eyes watering. He scrambled backwards, pulling himself off the ground and raising his arm to block another punch.
A conflicting range of emotions passed over Oliver’s face, ending with defeat as he slumped in his chair. “Fiiiiine,” he groaned.
Anna talked about her last job as a barista and a bit about her hobbies and John politely nodded along, but found her to be… boring. He knows she’s a nice girl, pretty enough, but she just seemed so… average. John couldn’t figure out why something like that stood out to him suddenly. Average was good, right? John knows he’s average, so why did it bother him if Anna was?
John sat on the edge of his bed, elbows on his knees and his face in his hands. On the back of his eyelids, all he could see was Oliver, bloody and pale. John’s trying to manage his breathing, trying to stay calm, trying to
The three of them couldn’t be called perfect, and John didn’t think they’d ever be anywhere near it. For now, they were halfway to “okay” and that was a start.
“Give him a chance,” Mycroft said. “If this really doesn’t work out, I can figure out a different situation for him. If you need anything I’ll be in touch.”
“Okay. I’m off,” Oliver set his mug on the table. He spun on his heel and walked out the door. John listened to him thud down the stairs, then the front door opened and shut.
Oliver was sat on his bed, back to the wall, and Emily was sitting on his desk chair, spinning in it. After Oliver’s panic attack, Emily finished making their pasta because all of Oliver’s energy had left his body. They hadn’t really talked about it since. Oliver had been emotional and it was embarrassing that he broke down like that. It felt like he couldn’t hold himself together anymore. But he thinks Emily understood.
Oliver shrugged, kicking a rock. John really was clever, even if the man didn’t realize it. There’s just… a lot going on. Oliver knew he wasn’t making it any easier; he also took lengths to hide it. He felt guilty, just a little.
“And you, Johnny?” Harry asked. “You’ve called me outta the blue after not hearing a word from you in months. Is everything all right? You’re not about off yourself or anything?”
“Ah, John Watson correct? We spoke on the phone about a month ago regarding Oliver’s academics?” The male voice sounded familiar, and John recognized him as Oliver’s academic advisor.
John kicked off his shoes and sighed, tired from working overtime but relieved he didn’t have to work the rest of the weekend.
Sherlock walked back into the sitting room, saying, “Mycroft has a lead but it’s unreliable at best and running cold.”
She scooted off to the kitchen, muttering about Sherlock bringing body parts home and causing hazardous molding again. John shook his head and smiled a bit, listening to the sound of her putting together some lunch. Sometimes she just came upstairs and made a meals for him and Oliver, and neither of them minded. They both knew she got lonely.
“Oliver?” John asked through the doorway to the boy’s room. With only a few days left to Christmas, he wouldn’t be surprised if Oliver felt homesick.
“Emily caught on, but you’re so desperate for physical attention you ignored the fact that I’ve been brainwashing you, and using our
John understood. If he moved up another grade, he’d look even more out of place amongst the upperclassmen. But he didn’t want Oliver to constantly but upset with school either. Especially if it affected his marks. John didn’t think it was fair to Oliver, because he
“It’s all right, shhh,” John said. He led Oliver towards the window and yanked it open. A gust of cool air blew in, making him shiver, but Oliver’s face relaxed a bit, his hair blowing off his forehead. John put his hand on Oliver’s back and pulled him towards the window.
“You have to tell me why!” Sherlock shouted. “Tell why you won’t get angry with me, because I keep getting mixed signals from you!”
John chewed the inside of his cheek. “All right. You have to wear a coat though and make sure your phone is on.”
It would be too easy to pretend nothing happened in two years of separation, but they would both know how much of a lie it was. John broke the silence first.
“No, no. Nothing like that. I’ve been back on my feet lately and realized how much of a cock I acted like for never answering your calls,” John said. “And with the holidays coming up, I thought better now than later.”
Oliver lifted his hands and thread them through his hair, pulling while a choked sobs shook his entire body. He buried his face farther into his legs. It broke John’s heart to watch, but he knew Oliver wanted to deal with it alone. So he stood up, stepped away and waited by the couch. He would stay in case Oliver needed him, but gave him the space he wanted.
“What the hell?” He turned it over in his hand. It wasn’t bigger than a coin, and looked vaguely familiar.
“John,” Sherlock’s voice sounded just as raw as John felt. John lifted his head, then Sherlock moved forward and kissed him.
John came home late that night, and Oliver had beat him there. Because of John’s extended lunch break, he had to make up an hour at the surgery, meaning he got home only a just before Oliver was supposed to help Emily with her studies.
She really had no idea, though. She says she’ll leave them be, but if they need anything just to shout because she’s always here. John nodded, and she shut the door behind her.
John flushed the toilet and stood up. “Fine. Don’t mind me.” He leaned over the bathroom sink, picked up his toothbrush and turned on the faucet. John knew the unfairness of it, but he couldn’t look at the boy, his heart thudding too rapidly in his chest. He began brushing his teeth to get the taste of vomit out of his mouth, but he could see Oliver in the mirror, still standing there.
The detective’s eyes found his. They were kind, but spoke of other things repressed underneath the glassy surfaces.
First the top lip, then the bottom, and John couldn’t help but think how well they fit together, all the way down to the shape of their mouths. He felt a tingling sensation on his scalp as his hairs stood on end. The wind blew and the cold hit him hard, practically bare-footed and no longer enveloped in a Sherlock vacuum.
He woke to a firm and callused hand around his upper arm. “Just me, Sherlock, you can continue resting.” Sherlock groaned and stretched, careful to keep the arm in Watson’s hand still.
He felt fingertips brushing against his temple, fooling with his hair. He broke out in gooseflesh. He felt a murmur sound from deep in Sherlock’s chest.
"Yeah. I did the right arm first. Didn't really plan it out or try to make it cohesive. Just happened. I wanted these to interlace more, I guess. I dunno." Sherlock peered into John's face with knit brows. After a few moments of a tense stare, Sherlock turned his eyes back to the ink.
Jane crossed her ankles in the pew, fidgeting nervously with her dress. The organ started and her heart sank further into her chest, the salt water already gathering at the corners of her lids. She felt a strong hand on her shoulder and turned to see her boss there, dressed dapper as always, tears leaking from him as well. She let out a short sob and squeezed the massive hand on her shoulder before turning back to face the beautifully carved coffin. John placed his arm around Jane’s shoulder and brought her into his chest, holding her tightly.
“He loved you. He hated school, loathed it, in fact. But he adored you. Spoke of you every day.” Mrs. Evans touched Jane’s cheek lovingly. “Thank you for loving him back.”
There was no name on this one. The envelope was plain white, like something you’d send a bill off in. A small slip of paper rested inside:
Sherlock read the inscription several times over. It was incredible, how much you could glean of someone’s character by what others say of them, or to them. He felt tempted to ask John to loan him the book. He hadn’t read it, and was suddenly quite interested in seeing how John was represented through the characters of that novel in particular.
“Yes, of course I thought there was a reason for it, John. One that was meant to deter me from seeing you in a condition you did not wish to be seen in. What you need to realize, and quickly, is that I am your ally, not your enemy. I am here to help you, not torment, judge, or criticize you.” Sherlock was brisk and sharp in delivery, no longer stammering or self-conscious. John nodded once in response, his lips pursed together in a thin line.
“You’ve always had a way with words, John. Your suit is hanging in your closet. The service starts at four.”
He saw naked men all the time. There were twenty-two of them on his damned rugby team, and they were not ones to shy away from physical touch – they could all give and take a good spank, shared shampoo in the showers, and never withheld commentary when one of them was looking particularly spot on. They were completely comfortable. John had seen as much of Callum as Molly had, even if it hadn’t been in the same context.
“How was your day? Fourth period any better, or are they still crawling under your skin?” B flipped the chicken breasts in the pan and dug through the cabinets for rosemary. He heard Jane sigh and raised his eyebrows. “That rough, huh?”
“Yes, we very well do, don’t we?” John murmured against Sherlock’s mouth. He felt the full lips shift into a smile against his, and they kissed again before opening a bottle of wine.
John nodded slowly. “It’s one of my favorites. Beautiful, that book. Molly and Callum gifted it to me for Christmas a few years ago. I’ve read it nearly four times since.”
“Sorry? I’m real? I’m standing in front of you, aren’t I?” Sherlock was right, a mouthy twat indeed. John wondered if it occurred to
John buckled the fastener under his chin. His uniform had him melting; it was upwards of 39°C. The doctor dragged the back of his wrist across his forehead in an attempt to eliminate the beads of sweat that were starting to gather there. He stood outside their encampment, waiting anxiously for something to happen. The past week, they had been told to keep a weather eye on the city, but were given no other information. Operation HERRICK at it’s very best, vague as hell. He was a part of medical squadron, after all. They were the mildest of the rest. In some ways it was reassuring to John – why would a band of healers be taken out? But then on the other, if we are the peacekeepers, we would be easy to destroy. Quite an easy target, indeed.
John hummed deep in his chest as he began to understand Sherlock’s request. “Turn round then, and allow me to see the front of you.” In response, the Bernini-esque creature turned slowly to reveal an abdomen John could scrub his pants on, if he lathered them up a bit. Sherlock leaned comfortably against the counter, ankles crossed as John studied him.
“Don’t apologize. You have nothing to apologize for. Maybe we can reschedule?” John knew his voice was far too hopeful, but he couldn’t help himself. This man had possessed far too many of his spare thoughts, and he would be damned if he didn’t at least try to address it.
It rested against a vase of white roses (when had those been put there?), and had “John” written in tall, loopy handwriting. The doctor’s heart fluttered.
John slid lazily from the chair into the floor, tossing his shirt onto the sofa. He reached for Sherlock’s pants and quickly divested him of his clothing. John sat on his knees, licking into Sherlock’s mouth and shivering at the taste of himself on his tongue. Then he got on his back, urging Sherlock to crawl on top of him, clawing at his thighs, the taut muscles of his arse, the whipcord muscle of his back. “Fucking christ, you are gorgeous. Do you know that?” He slid down so that Sherlock was straddling his shoulders, and began to kiss Sherlock’s cock. They started as soft, ghosting touches, sweet and tender and easy, but soon escalated into messy, wet, and tongue infused. John licked the beading liquid from the slit of Sherlock’s swollen cock, his hands now digging firmly into Sherlock’s thighs, his moans nearly overshadowing the whimpers leaving Sherlock’s lips.
Three minutes later, the phone buzzed and then rang again. John sat up in bed, rubbed his hand over his eyes and grabbed the phone. “’ullo?”

“You don’t have to explain why you ask the things you ask. You can ask whatever you like. If you want a serious response, I’ll offer one. I live alone because I prefer it that way. As primary school as it sounds, rugby is the love of my life – when I’m off season I’m training, and during our season we’re training and practicing and traveling to matches. And… there aren’t many women like Molly, or Violet, my buddy Egan’s wife, who are comfortable with that lifestyle. Most women want to date me because I show up in the newspapers and telly sometimes, I have a bit of money, and I’m fun.”
John felt a bit of toothpaste drip down his chin and he quickly turned back to the sink, red as a cherry.
Adrenaline rippled through him as he ran. He had nearly topped the hill that hid the bunker-like prison when he felt his left shoulder rip apart, splitting into a million shards of blood, muscle and bone. He cried out in agony and fell, rolling into the valley between the next expanses of desert.
Sherlock’s eyebrows furrowed hard and fast on his face. His eyes went colder; less overcast and more ice storm. “You can’t be serious.” It was not a question; it was not a joke. It was bitter. “Oh, I am a fool. I am a fool indeed. Here I was, thinking you finally... Are you telling me I am too foolish to understand the consequences of our,
“Is that a real question?” She asked, murmuring into his neck. She kissed the hollow of his throat, the soft skin stretched across his sternum. She felt his hand cradling the back of her skull, thumb rubbing lovingly against her ear.
“Please, god, let me live.” John was sobbing. A long slice, half the length of his forearm, began to blossom blood from his ribs. “I don’t know. I don’t know what you want.” He felt the tip of the knife press under his chin. The tears felt hot and ran through a coat of dirt and filth on his face. He wished he could drown.
They stood in silence. Sherlock typically preferred this. People tend to talk too much, or believe their words to be far more important than they actually are. He sensed that John had observed this about him, and wondered what other deductions the sharp captain had made.
John knocked on the door of the girl’s cabin, partially terrified of having his head bitten off. Jane answered the door, wearing a stunning, beige dress. Her hair was up and curled, her freckles faded from winter hibernation. Her blue eyes stood out like tidal pools against the shimmery browns of her eyeshadow. John grinned, eyebrows high on his forehead.
John blushed, and before the red could sweep his cheeks, Sherlock was standing over him, kissing him. John wrapped his free arm around Sherlock’s back and rocked up onto his toes, making Sherlock a bit easier to reach. He felt the cupids bow curve into a grin against his mouth. “I slept famously, thank you,” he murmured. “Hungry?”
Callum raised a defiant eyebrow. “Seriously? I mean, Molly loves you. Why the hell wouldn’t she talk about you? You’re my best mate. Idiot.”
“I felt that obscene gesture, Jane Jesep. Shame on you.” He ran the sink and dropped the dishes in. Jane joined him on the other side, smiling.
Sherlock laughed and the sound echoed through the flat. "Is that what they're called? I used to watch a great deal of the Doctor, yes. I'm not sure I'd deem myself a Whovian, though."
John only nodded, tying the double knot of his second boot. Callum left it at that, knowing the morning workout had done little for John. The doors burst open and the boys’ voices bellowed cheerfully, carrying through the locker room. Rhys Rex gave Callum a strong clap on the shoulder.
“I didn’t say a word about dating. He’s just wonderful, and I think you would enjoy his company. Besides, the wedding is still four months away.”
John erupted into another fit of laughter as he walked up and wrapped himself around Sherlock's waist, taking care to avoid the chunks of glass. The detective wilted at the touch.
Sherlock tried to imagine what sort of things John would write about. Autobiographical wouldn’t necessarily do; he possessed far too much humilty to be comfortable writing a book about himself, although it seemed he would have plenty of content. A narrative could be a possibility. He pictured John writing a comedy; something quick, clever, and light. On the other end, however, he was probably a man with great power over his words. John could write a successful drama, he was certain. He returned the book to its place on the shelf. As he began to head towards the kitchen to put on a pot of coffee, a thin, navy spine caught his attention. There was no title inscribed on the cover. He opened it to a blank front page. He thumbed carelessly through it, but began to slow as he realized it was filled with handwritten words.
The door of the rehearsal room opened and John’s eyes shot to it, terror and thrill clutching his stomach in a chokehold. Sherlock stepped inside, letters in one hand, his other wiping insistent tears from his eyes. John’s heart thudded irregularly. He stood up on the edge of the stage and beckoned Sherlock with his trembling hand. The beautiful creature crossed the room and slowly found each stair. They stood, staring at one another; Sherlock’s sniffles echoed off the walls. John stepped up to him, a small smile biting into his cheek. He remembered first laying eyes on him, standing in this very spot, his body swaying from one foot to the other. He took the letters from Sherlock’s hand and tucked them into his pocket. Then he placed one hand on the small of Sherlock’s back and extended the other, lacing his fingers into a palm nearly twice the size of his own. He looked at Sherlock, who was still leaking, and took the first step.
John stilled, and then leaned back on Sherlock’s lap. He let his hands rest on Sherlock’s sides, thumbs rubbing lovingly against the flannel fabric. “Was it all right, then?” He chewed on the inside of his cheek.
Callum smirked. “Get outta bed. I picked up some tea for us.” John rolled over, scrubbed his face with his hands and inhaled, the sharp smell of black tea filling his nose.
His legs were pale against the navy and green plaid, the gown significantly shorter on his tall frame. His hair was a wreck, curls on the crown of his head far more unruly than he was accustomed to, and the hair at the back of his head pressed flat and funny from sleep. John grinned as Sherlock toed open the fridge, keeping his eyes on the fried eggs in the skillet. He pulled out chives and onions, located the cutting board, and wiped the blade of a small knife clean. Sherlock reached up above his head and to the left, selected a hand thrown mug, a gift from Jane for Christmas, and poured a hot cup of coffee. Sherlock turned around and extended his arm, handing the drink to John.
Welcome to the next chapter. This one is a bit longer than the others... sorry [not sorry] for getting a bit carried away.
“Ah. So you’ll be out most of the day then?” John couldn’t help but feel disappointed. He knew Sherlock couldn’t turn down work forever, and Watson didn’t want him to. He was trying to fight the now natural instinct of wanting to keep the detective for himself, all the time.
Jane winked and gave a playful turn. She was wearing a teal, striped sweater and khakis. “Well, thank you.”
There was long, thin scar that ran half the length of Sherlock’s ribcage, the tiny dashes of past stitches barely visible. The new flesh shone a brighter pink against the rest of his fair skin, ivory against the inevitable freckle and sun of John’s arms. He kissed it in length, one small kiss directly beside the next. Sherlock braced one foot against the duvet, bending his leg at the knee, and rocked into the warmth of John’s hip. John gave a breathy exhale against Sherlock’s chest and continued to cradle this exquisite man as his hips oscillated against John. He laced his arm under the crook of Sherlock’s other knee, and sat up, folding his knees underneath him. With his mouth, he traced the muscles of Sherlock’s thigh, working his way across to his knee. Sherlock’s head sunk further into the duvet, turning away from John, the ligaments of his neck arching into beautiful webs. He planted a soft kiss to Sherlock’s kneecap, bony amongst the lean muscle of the rest of his body. Sherlock’s hand wound up to clutch at John’s shoulder, attempting to pull him down. John obeyed, drawing Sherlock’s legs tightly around his waist. Sherlock’s eyes were unrefined, wild in their expression, and both his hands tugged at John’s hair, his neck, the thin skin between his shoulder blades. John hissed at the sensation of nails along his ribs. Sherlock found his mouth like a collision of two momentous objects: hard, unyielding, and unforgiving. John absorbed the crash; he enveloped Sherlock in his arms, and for every bite of a lip, every slip of tongue endeavoring to explore, every rasping breath, John was there to meet him fervently. John pulled Sherlock up, pulled him as close as he could; he wanted his skin to vibrate at their contact.
“You can stay home from school today if you’d like,” he offered. “I don’t know how I feel about you being around those boys after last night.”
. John abruptly stood and didn’t register Oliver’s raised eyebrows as he almost tripped over the coffee table in a rush to get through the kitchen and into the bathroom. He dropped to his knees in front of the toilet just before he vomit, gagging and gasping because all he could see were glassy blue eyes and red stained alabaster skin.
It wasn’t until after sunset, a full day of doing nothing but guilty drinking (as much as he knew he shouldn’t and tried not to) he got a text from Mycroft, simply stating “
“Are you in school, Oliver?” asked Mrs Hudson when Oliver had drifted away again. John touched his arm to get his attention.
John didn’t know what to expect in the morning, but wasn’t very surprised to find Oliver already awake and making tea when he stumbled down the stairs into the sitting room. He gratefully accepted the mug Oliver offered him and sunk into his armchair. The winds whipping around outside had kept him up for the better part of the night, but looking outside now the world seemed still - frozen with the ice that hung from the window.
“Why?” Oliver’s voice rose louder than John had heard it yet, almost a shout. “Why wouldn’t he tell anyone? You’re supposed to be his best friend, right? Not a word about him having a son?”
Oliver’s entire body tensed up. What the hell did that mean? Oliver looked over his shoulder, his hand on the door handle. “What?”
“Ah, here,” John took a box from the stack and led the man, Mycroft and Oliver up to the flat. He set the box down on the floor, and the man did the same then disappeared down the stairs.
John grabbed his laptop and flipped it open, his hands flitting across the keyboard as he pulled up the tracker on Oliver’s phone as fast as possible. He watched as the blinking dot that signaled Oliver trailed across the screen fast in the opposite direction of Baker street, meaning he was running. Why would he be running? John remembered Oliver telling him about the boys who had chased him down and thrown in him in a dumpster.
John shut his eyes in relief. He sighed a breath he’d been holding for eternity and asked, “Can you stand?”
Then Oliver coughed, his eyebrows scrunching. John yanked his hands away from Oliver’s chest and quickly rolled him onto his side. “Oh thank God. Oh God, Oliver,” John gasped. Oliver coughed and gagged, water spraying out of his mouth until he vomit, groaning, tears running down his face. It was ugly but it was beautiful, because he was
A few days after that, Oliver rushed home after his club and guitar lessons, pounding up the stairs. John looked up, worried something had happened, but a grin graced Oliver’s face instead.
So, warning, the next chapter I've literally been planning from the beginning of this ENTIRE series. It's intense.
John watched Olive’s face go through a few complicated emotions before he turned away. John turned from the photos too, and looked at the opposite wall, which was covered in drawings. Some were obviously done by a much younger Oliver, in crayon and on colorful paper, but they matured and John recognized the realistic style Oliver drew with now.
John tilted his head down and smiled. “He made that much clear when we met. I’m afraid he doesn’t like you, really.”
"Je ne comprends pas comment quelqu'un peut être - alors…" means "I do not understand how anyone can be - so ..."
John rolled his eyes and breathed a chuckle, then motioned for Oliver to walk up the stairs. “You can’t hit him though.”
“I can send a copy of his new schedule home with him,” he said. “You’ll just need to sign the paper and send it back with him at the earliest convenience.”
tell you a bit about him, since he wants to behave like a child,” Mycroft said, looking pointedly at Oliver, who had turned his attention to picking at his nails. “He’s in year ten at school, which is a grade ahead of the norm, though he doesn’t take his studies seriously.”
Oliver came home after astronomy club that night and handed John the paper he needed to sign. John read it over while Oliver stood in front of him, bouncing on the balls of his feet. John signed it and handed it back to Oliver.
John called Mycroft first thing on Friday morning. He told him about the boys harassing Oliver and that it happened more than once and this time Oliver could could have died if John was a moment later. Mycroft’s voice adepts a sort of “I’ll kill someone and make it look like a suicide” tone and says he’ll deal with it.
“Afternoon, Violet,” John smiled, her motherly voice immediately putting him to ease. “How have you been?”
A few moments later the nurse left Oliver’s room and gestured that they could go back in. Emily looked up, biting her lip and John nodded that she could go ahead. She slipped through the doorway and shut it behind her. John remembered Oliver telling him they had a fight a while ago and wondered if they had ever resolved it. Maybe Emily would be able to get through to Oliver better than John or Sherlock could right now. If Oliver talked to
Sherlock stepped forward and kissed him. John reached up to hold Sherlock’s face in his hands, kissing him back. He could feel Sherlock’s long fingers curl against his jumper, pulling him impossibly closer.
Sherlock nodded, putting his hands on the kitchen table and leaning on them. “I can’t believe I didn’t catch it. I never paid attention to Oliver’s friends. Why wouldn’t I? It’s so unlike me.”
On a totally unrelated note, are any of y'all Dan and Phil fans? If you are, and are going to the Interactive Introverts tour, hmu
Oliver half-shrugged again. “It’s boring. I don’t like doing it, I’d rather read on my own. The work is tedious, I already know the content.”
you here! You know that, and I tell you that all the time! It’s just a huge change and everything is happening at once, and I want it all to
John shut his eyes and leaned forward, pressing his forehead on Sherlock’s shoulder. “I’m sorry Sherlock. I’m sorry everything is so awful.”
The cab pulled up to the kerb in front of the café, and John paid the driver. He stepped out and opened Oliver’s door, holding out a hand. For a moment, John thought Oliver might ignore him, but he gripped John’s arm with shaking hands and pulled himself out of the cab, wobbling a little. They walked into 221, and Oliver leaned against the banister on the stairs, making his own way up. Just in case, John walked behind him, watching his unsteady feet.
Oliver gagged when Caden’s knee met his stomach, he doubled over and coughed, then Caden swung him to the floor. Oliver tried to catch himself but his right wrist landed under his weight and a sharp pain shot up the inside of his arm, making it feel numb and cold. He pushed the pain away and pulled his body up, spinning around in time to see a flash of something metal and Caden’s hand rushing at him.
John coughed and spit, his eyes pricking and his grip on the porcelain bowl knuckle-whitening. He took a deep shuddering breath, and squeezed his eyes shut, willing himself to stop thinking. Why did he think he could do this? Stupid. He couldn’t take care of a teenager. He couldn’t take care of
From Mr and Mrs Holmes Oliver got a thin wooden case with expensive paints in it, and from Mycroft he got a vinyl turntable. John got a watch from Harry and enough money for a vacation from his mother. Maybe that’s something Oliver and him could do when school ends.
. John must know, because Oliver came home blatantly smelling like cigarettes, and Sherlock graciously pointed out he’d taken drugs. Oliver put down his sandwich, suddenly not hungry. The look on John’s face when Sherlock asked what he was on made Oliver sick. He dumped his sandwich in the trash.
Emotions Oliver hadn’t yet seen on John’s face passed through his eyes, and John sighed, pulling Oliver into another hug. He continued talking, much quieter, “I thought you were dead. You can’t do that to me.”
The doctor was still talking, “You’ll need to come back in three or so weeks to check how your wrist is healing.” She flipped her papers down and smiled at them. “You’ll probably want to use a wheelchair to get to your car, there’s one in the hall for you. I’ll leave you two be, then.”
John nodded, flexing his fingers at his side. Sherlock left, and John very suddenly felt very alone. The flat was quiet, barring the electric hum of the refrigerator, and the muffled talking from Oliver’s room.
“Don’t worry about price, if it’s something expensive,” John assured. For Oliver, if something fell out of his price range, he knew Mycroft would help out. Sometimes John felt guilty about it, but after a year of Mycroft covering anything John couldn’t for the boy, he didn’t anymore.
“Finally!” Caden grinned, grabbing Oliver’s wrist and pulling him so he fell back onto his bed with an
Emily nodded, and leaned back against the wall a few yards away from them, fidgeting with anxiety. John wondered where Molly was.
Mycroft paused in turning to the door, raising an eyebrow. “Don’t tell me you’re afraid of a thirteen year old.”
If this is how Oliver acted after doing something he loved, John figured next time he wouldn’t be as anxious about him being out on his own, as long as the boy stayed happy.
In full color, it depicted the beach they went to that summer, the night sky glowing off the dark blue water and the stars lighting up the surface. The painting looked like it came from the perspective of the cliffs above the beach. Two tiny shadows sat on the beach by water, who John could only assume to be Oliver and himself.
He left in a rush, the bell above the door chiming as he ran out. John watched him through the window as he rushed down the street and tried to ignore the tugging in his chest. The illicit call for adventure John had been trying to suppress for
The flat didn’t have space for a tree, but John and Oliver cleared off the desk enough to put a small decorative one on it under the animal skull, and it glowed with tiny lights. Mrs Hudson came upstairs with them and John lit the fire. The inches of snow outside gave the flat a bit of a chill and they welcomed the warmth of the fire.
When they got back to the flat, Sherlock pulled off his coat and hung it while John toed off his shoes, then grabbed Sherlock’s shirt and kissed him. John pushed him backwards until he landed on the couch and John was leaning over him, one hand braced on the back of the couch, the other fisted in Sherlock’s shirt collar, and his knee on the cushion.
When Sigar and Violet woke up, there were omelettes on the table for them, but Oliver sat outside in the garden. The moist fog from earlier had cleared and the damp grass had mostly dried, the sun comforting and warm. He sat in the grass near a flower bed and picked a flower, then tore off all the petals and squashed the rest between his fingers.
Sherlock was already moving towards the door, said, “Might as well. There’s some details about a planned terrorist attack he doesn’t have time to deal with.” His shoes and coat were on before he finished the sentence. “I’ll text on my way back.”
John hadn’t entirely decided yet, and the Saturday a week before Oliver’s birthday, John asked about it. “Is there anything thing you’d like for your birthday?”
Oliver shrugged. Maybe. Probably. He had been easily hiding it from Sherlock, and the man had suspected but yesterday all that had been ruined. Ugh, he didn’t want to think about it. He didn’t want to think about going home and sitting down to talk to them, he didn’t want to go through any of that. Oliver wished he could pretend none of that happened. He wished yesterday didn’t happen. Caden was right, they should run away together, no more problems.
John kissed him back, putting his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder and pressing forward, breathing him in. He broke the kiss and put his forehead on the crook of Sherlock’s neck, squeezing his eyes shut so he wouldn’t have to see Sherlock’s face. There’s a specific kind of raw internal pain that came from being confused and guilty, and not knowing how to express it. Like a cold spider in his chest, twisting and turning, spreading out and taking over. John’s throat hurt and he wanted to sob and scream and throw things, but all he could do was sit there, worry, and try not to cry.
He blinked hard, angry at the tears gathering in his eyes. He shuddered a breath, because nothing was ever going to go back to the way it was, and he had to deal with that.
“Oliver?” John asked, his voice soft. Oliver’s entire back tensed. He looked so small curled up like that. John inched forward and lowered himself to his knees, balancing with one hand still on his cane. He lifted his hand and hesitated before resting it on Oliver’s back.
He heard Sherlock sigh, then felt Sherlock’s hand on his shoulder. His touch felt light as his fingers moved to curl into John’s hair at the back of his head.
Caden was already there, and Oliver felt himself lighten just seeing the other boy. Caden smiled at him, and took Oliver’s hand, tangling their fingers together. Oliver felt less suffocated when he was with Caden, and he didn’t have to think about Sherlock and John and the stress at home. Caden listened to him vent, and wouldn’t try solve everything, but was just
Anyways, yes, this is the last chapter of Where You Can't Quite Reach. BUT HOLD ONTO YOUR SOCKS - there is going to be two more fics in this series.
“He hasn’t gotten back to me yet, but I assume he will be,” John said. “At least for a little while.”
John nodded, wiping down a plate with the towel. He put it in the dish rack. “I know, I’m just not really looking forward to it. Oliver already isn’t very fond of Sherlock.”
She shook her head and looked between the two of them. “There’s going to be shouting when that boy comes back, I just know it. It’d do you three well to sort things out quickly. I don’t want to be kept up into the depths of the night, and the neighbors will start to complain. Sit and talk to each other like adults.”
“Is it because I look like him?” Oliver asked, his voice hardly audible. John spit in the sink and turned off the water, then looked at his own tired eyes in the mirror. “I’m sorry if… if my being here causes you trouble.”
“I’d like to point out the tracking device on your phone is for your safety,” Mycroft said. “And if you choose to abandon it, there are other, more uncomfortable ways, for us to know where you are when you run off.”
I almost didn't post this today because I had a really rough week and today kinda snuck up on me. But, here it is! A few hours late, but at least it's out.
“Well - mostly,” John said. He told them about Oliver doing better academically, but he had run into some trouble with a few boys in his grade. He took a breath, worried about their reactions to what happened the night before, then told them about Oliver almost drowning. He left out the gritty parts, the CPR and the following panic attacks (Mycroft already knew about it and he advise John to leave out those bits).
The three spoke on the phone for close to half an hour, talking about all the details and some other things. Violet and Sigar wanted John to adopt Oliver, because they wanted him to be secured with someone, just in case. They told him originally they thought Oliver would end up somewhere else, after John took care of him for a few months, but after seeing how well he did living with John, they changed their plans.
Today is chapter 9, and in two days (on Thursday) I will post chapter 10, so make sure you don't miss it!
“Remember how I said sometimes my astronomy club would meet on Saturdays after sunset?” asked Oliver. “I sort of forgot to tell you that today is one of those days, but can I please go anyways?”
“Yes,” Mycroft said, clearing his voice. “Oliver called me, a few weeks ago, and told me that he wanted you to adopt him.”
“Oliver.” John reached out and tapped Oliver’s chin, so he looked up. John smiled. “Of course I want to adopt you. Nothing would make me happier than to call you my own.”
“Come on,” he begged, pumping his hands onto Oliver’s chest again. “Please, Oliver, please. Just breathe. Breathe, breathe, breathe, dammit! I can’t lose you too, please!”
The three boys looked up, searching the darkness before spotting John. One took off in panic as John ran towards them. One boy jabbed Oliver in the chest, saying something John couldn’t make out before the two lifted Oliver up by the shirt, and shoved him up onto the railing. John’s heart stopped when Oliver teetered backwards, his hands reaching out into the air, searching for something to grab, everything moving in slow motion. Then he fell, and the boys took off running and laughing, but John didn’t even care because in a moment that stretched to infinity, he remembered -
“Regular poison tonight boys, or do we need something a bit stronger?” She tucked a stray, neon blue piece of hair behind her ear, contrasting sharply with the dark, black braids that fell over her shoulders. Everything about Jess was so easy. John had always found her physically attractive, and figured maybe, one day, if he settled down with a woman, she would have a presence similar to hers: bright, forgiving, kind and happy. Particularly the happy part.
Sherlock sighed and rolled his eyes. John let loose a tiny giggle. Sherlock’s grey eyes were on his instantly, wide and filled with hurt. “Is this funny to you? Do you find this amusing?” John could see everything Sherlock was biting back:
signed his name, only his initials. Like a magnetic field, John felt himself suddenly being pulled to the sleeping man’s side. He knelt next to him and lifted one hand to brush the cropped curls from his brow.
John stared at the man like he could have kissed him. Jane wished he would. She had an odd, flighty feeling in her stomach. She was so thrilled to see John glowing as if he and Sherlock had been the ones on holiday.
“And am I your test subject?” Sherlock was pleased with himself, at his ability to remain quick and cheeky despite his own hunger for John crawling quickly to an unbearable state.
Sherlock took a magnetic step forward. It was hardly a step, more like a glide, and John watched in awe as Sherlock’s body began to move in subtle, tight shifts and clicks: first his right arm, out and up to his shoulder, his left hand to his chin. Then his Supras were turned in John’s direction and Sherlock’s legs were moving, feet lifting and hitting the ground again, small vibrations moving in gorgeous tremors all the way up to Sherlock’s eyes. They did not leave John’s face. They were darker now, more black than grey, and John’s attention was ripped to Sherlock’s hips, rolling sensually against the air, as if emulating a body that wasn’t visible for him to grind against. Sherlock extended his left hand out straight, and with a few tiny movements, he was giving John an undeniable “come hither” with his index finger. The onlookers yelled, clapping John on the back and hollering words of encouragement. Chachi smacked John hard on the arse. The foxiest smile to date played at the corner of Sherlock’s lips.
Sherlock grinned. "Ah. That reference I do know, quite well." Sherlock paused a moment, and then hummed an affirmative noise.
Molly joined her on the sofa, a beautiful heather grey scarf in the works between her knitting needles. She squished her feet up next to Jane’s wool socks, squeezing her toes under Jane’s arches, and wiggled them. “Love you more.”
John stared at the dimly lit mobile. It shone brightly in the dark of his bedroom, the green and gray speech bubbles scrolling as John read through the conversation for the seventh time. He closed his eyes and pulled the feeling of Sherlock’s hands on him from his memory. Remembering those generous, giving, lush lips against his was pure misery. He rolled to his side, shoving his face into a pillow and groaned. John had hardly slept the last two nights, doing his very best to properly recite the entire kiss in agonizing detail so that it was committed to his long term memory. Sherlock’s skin had been so soft to the touch. He remembered his hand underneath Sherlock’s ridiculous trench, counting the ribs as he went, heat radiating from every bit of him. The man was a fucking magnet, and there was nothing John could do now but to be completely and utterly drawn to him.
Molly grinned and nodded. “Yes, she’s quite lovely. Very kind, and an attentive listener. She isn’t as quick a learner as I would have hoped, but she is making up for it in effort.”
They fell into bed, a tangle of limbs, and Sherlock traced the slice down John’s ribs, following the line with his tongue. He kissed and nipped the inside of John’s hip and began tugging at his belted trousers. Those gorgeous hands were at his button, pulling his zipper, yanking off John’s clothes. John was laughing, tracing the lines of Sherlock’s alabaster torso, dragging his nails down the detective’s back, wrapping his hands around his neck and pulling him down, down, down. He was nibbling Holmes’ ear, running his tongue across the taut flesh of the man’s chest, running his free hand across the glorious hardness between those perfect legs. Watson grabbed Sherlock’s hand and slowly enveloped two pale fingers with his mouth. His tongue traced them like a study; they tasted of copper and sweat and warm spice. Sherlock’s eyes were lidded, looking down at John, and a small moan escaped his damp, pouting lips. He rubbed Sherlock through his trousers with his cheek, then kissed him through the dampening fabric. John’s hair was being pulled; the feeling was more arousing than he suspected it would be. “John.” Sherlock was coming apart tiny piece by tiny piece and it was all John’s doing.
“It’s fine, really. We don’t have to talk.” John hesitated, debating whether or not his next statement would be wise. “You look like shit, Holmes. I didn’t expect to be right.”
“It’s nearly May, Sherlock, why in hell are you wearing a wool coat?” Speaking the man's name aloud felt second nature, as if John had done it all his life.
“I don’t want to leave this, Sherlock. I’m afraid every day that when I wake up, I’ll roll over and find myself in a cave somewhere, and this will have all been a dream.”
“I…” Sherlock looked lost for words. John was dumbfounded. The brunette turned on him and his eyes were nearly painful to look at.
John’s eyebrows skyrocketed on his face, mouth open in a sweet oh. A devilish grin quickly replaced it.
John’s eyes went wide in surprise. Sherlock raised in his eyebrows in questioning. After a moment, John glanced back to the television and retrieved his drink from the table. His tanned hand rested atop Sherlock’s folded knees, thumb rubbing against his kneecap. “I think for now, I’d like it to be just you and me. If that’s all right.”
As Sherlock started to stand, Jim jumped from the stage and leaned over the table, hovering over Sherlock. His head tilted to the side, and Sherlock was suddenly reminded of a snake, or a menacing arachnid, before devouring its prey. He stood, face close to Moriarty’s. Jim’s eyes were dead things, empty bundles of flesh inside their orbitals. Sherlock decided right then he hated him. John’s midnight eyes burned hot in sharp contrast on the back of Sherlock’s lids as he blinked, pushing in his chair.
So Egan returned home to Violet, who was now showing at five and a half months, and Callum charmed Molly by taking her away on an extended weekend trip - she wouldn’t allow anything else at the peak of
“Well that’s just it, B. Remember those two or three weeks I was a complete prat before finals?” The entire team nodded far too enthusiastically. “Oy! Alright, yeah. It was rough, I know.” John felt a tiny trace of nausea sweep his stomach. The boys chuckled.
John leaned his head back onto the couch and looked up at Sherlock. Their eyes met, and he saw the impossible: they were wet, smiling and full of an emotion John never thought Sherlock would succumb to.
John pulled away and Molly looked up, waving her hands at her face to encourage stubborn tears to stay in place.
“It’s... it’s fine, I just thought, you know, that you were eager to come home to me and you never mentioned anyone overseas. I didn’t know you were planning to… to… get married, or propose, or whatever, to someone I had not even heard of. And then I had your letters… I was just horribly confused as to why you would write those things to me when you had someone else.”
Sherlock began to trot down the steps, pulling his coat tighter around his thin frame, and turned right towards the main street, likely to hail a cab home. John watched him rub a hand around his forearm and took two tentative steps down his stairs. Then he was on the sidewalk, jogging towards him, and he wrapped his hand round Sherlock’s elbow, giving him a gentle tug. Sherlock turned to face him, a sweet surprise unfolding on his face. “I just…” John slipped one hand to the small of Sherlock’s back, the other to his jaw, cupping his face, fingertips brushing into the dark hair. To his surprise, Sherlock unfurled his hands from his coat pockets, one set of cold fingers finding the warm pulse of John’s neck and the other gripping his hip. They met in a tentative way; John felt Sherlock everywhere around him, not just in the places they connected. He was warm; every breath felt like it was captured in the space around them, completely still and unmoving. John was sure he was in a vortex; all he could comprehend was how close he was to Sherlock, that their lips were touching, that he smelled of Thai leftovers, endorphins, and earthy pine. The hand cupping Sherlock’s face pulled him closer, a little firmer, a little more confident. John felt like he was finally crawling back into his own body; he was tired of seeing everything as it was happening, he just wanted to kiss Sherlock and feel it in his spine, in his toes, in every miserable, aching atom of his body. Their lips met again, both with more fervor, more intention. Sherlock’s fingers dug deeper into John’s hip, pulling him flush to his body, his other arm shifting to wrap around John’s neck, heat radiating from every inch of him. Suddenly John felt dizzy and a new sort of need hit him deep in his chest, following through the veins and arteries of his body, a new energy filling him up. John wrapped an arm across Sherlock’s back, resting it at the nape of his neck, pulling him closer. Could he melt into him? He was damn well going to try. They were snogging right there, in the middle of the street, and John didn’t give a flying fuck. This tender, perfect being was wrapped up in his arms; John’s hand was slowly moving down Sherlock’s left side, counting the ribs as he went, lips moving in a languid and perfect unison. He was in flames. They were burning blue together, John could feel it. He pulled away, reluctantly, and stared into the eyes of this creature that now held John Watson’s complete and undivided attention. Sherlock’s lips were pink and parted, arousal and surprise mixed together in lethal combination on his face. John knew then that this was it. He was it. Fuck.
Sherlock chuckled. “Again, with the self-deprecation. I don’t say things I do not mean, John. I figured you would understand that much by now.”
Sherlock rolled this thought around in his head and could not, no matter where he tried, find a place to make it fit. It didn’t make sense. He rested his hand on the top of the chair as he crouched down to face John.
He stayed like that for nearly two hours, listening to Sherlock make love with the horse hair strings of his bow. It grew quiet in the flat and John untangled himself from sheets.
John sat in the aisle seat next to Callum, who had passed out within the first half hour of the drive. Music from all the headphones melded together, and John chuckled to himself, scrubbing his face with his hands. The puzzled look on Sherlock’s face could not, for the life of him, be eliminated from the backs of his eyelids. Those ridiculous cheekbones had not been a trick of the lighting. And Irene sat across from him, looking stunning as ever, watching both of them with an expression John just could
Sherlock was torn between kissing John senseless and pressing him forward. He was flooded with the need to show John how loved he is now, that his life at present could be beautiful if he would allow it. He bit back the pungent desire to ask him what Harry had been like and decided to move on. Instead, he tapped gently at a collection of blue shapes on his left forearm. They reminded him of abstracted waves. Within them was orange text: make yourself.
“She’s great, John. Thanks for asking. Went to the doctor yesterday. Apparently at our next visit, we’ll be able to figure out whether it’s a boy or a girl. Violet and I are trying to decide if we want it to be a surprise.”
of those?” John did a full turn to face Jane, who had stepped into the kitchen and was leaning against the counter. He then shot a frantic look to Callum, trying to relay
John strolled into the pub to find Sherlock in a corner booth. The window seat funneled in all the night lights, glowing rose and gold on his elegant, sharp face. He shrugged off his lab coat and slid in across from Holmes.
She bit at his throat, her hand tracing down the front of his t-shirt. “Mmm. God, yes, John. I’ve missed you.”
“Damnit!” he blustered as he bit the stage for the ninth time. His hip and thigh would be black for a week. He sat in a tangle of limbs as his chest heaved.
“Sherlock.” John gave a gentle nod, allowing himself to soak in that gorgeous cupid’s bow and a pair of lush lips.
“So, tomorrow. How are you feeling, Cap?” Callum’s fingers tapped in a rhythm to Shine as he stared out at the growing night.
Sam loved you. And appreciated you. You were the one person in his life that loved him back. You saw everything in him no one else would ever dare to look for.
Irene chuckled aloud at that, nodding her head in quiet agreement. “Indeed,” she whispered over the table, red-laquered nails tapping. “Have you already ordered something to drink?”
, kiss he could onto Sherlock’s lips. John ran his tongue across the plush bottom lip; John smirked at the salty taste of popcorn. He kissed the corner of Sherlock’s mouth, his cheek, trailing a sodium ridden line of affection to his ear.
I'm the worst human on the face of the EARTH for making you wait a month and a half for this chapter. Please, darlings, forgive me and know that I love you. I've been trekking through some crazy shit trying to get sorted. PLUS I had my trip to Seattle. I met some amazing fanartists and authors while I was there. I love our fandom. <3 and I love YOU! I hope you like it; I'm a bit out of practice. Next chapter will be much better. <3
, and then you complain about the decision, let it dictate your life and use it as something to blame when shit gets hard. Your mother's death, Harriet's drug abuse, your father's absolute disinterest in you. A fucking scapegoat. I stood by and watched you choose this; I told you, John! Goddamnit, I told you that you would rot. But no, what does Sherlock know. He’s just a beautiful and fascinating creature to fill my time. It's nothing to do with the fact that he loves me and wanted to prove that he could be the one to hold John Watson together. And then you have the nerve to confess your love for me through letters, as if it were still a secret. You are the only one that doesn't see it, John. You are the only one that doesn't openly accept this "thing that is unfolding." Even so, I would wait another ten years hoping you'd come to your fucking senses. And that’s my decision. I fucking choose who I love and who I miss and who I care for. So don’t you dare stand here and try to tell me I’m an idiot for loving the man who has brought the goodness I didn’t know I possessed to the surface. I
He wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s bare ones, his t-shirt soaked through with sweat. He clutched the hem of it with one hand, slipped a hand underneath with the other. The warm wetness of Sherlock’s skin was glorious. John felt Sherlock’s hands in his hair, grasping the sides of his face. A soft whimper escaped the pair, from who, John would never know for certain. They were scrabbling, desperately, for purchase in one another: hands fisted in John’s sweater, legs slipping between knees, fingers intertwined in damp, dark hair. John and Sherlock slowly descended into a lazy pace, Sherlock pressed against the height of the stage, arms wrapped comfortably around John’s shoulders.
“Perhaps I’ll modify my experiments to encompass more variables once we get home…” John whispered. His expression was heated, and Sherlock had grown very partial to that look on John Watson’s face. His lips were red, cherry nearly, and parted, now shifting between shining with saliva or being chapped. Sherlock was tempted to offer his own tongue across John’s thin, flushed lips. The smirk was devious, but nothing Sherlock couldn’t handle. The eyes, however, were an entirely different story. They were charged, full of so many things, even Sherlock was faced with a challenge of sorting them out. Want had been the most prominent of the evening, hot and heavy and absolutely fearless in the navy blue and black, fondness a close second. Admiration and pride were present also, and these two hit Sherlock harder than he would have originally believed they would. The furrowing of his eyebrows lent itself to impatience rather than worry.
It had been five days since the wedding. Five days since John had nearly danced with otherworldly Sherlock Holmes, seen his perfect skin blush with John’s compliments, watched that mouth sip on scotch, witnessed those analytical eyes.
Jane grinned, and the girls proceeded to hop around the dance floor like teenagers at their first show.
“Of course! Come in, I just put the sauce on.” John shut the door behind Jane, and extended his hand. “May I take your coat?”
“Gorgeous, indeed,” Sherlock murmured. He combed his fingers through John’s mussed hair and gave him a gentle push towards the loo. “You’re filth, John Watson. That mouth of yours will be the death of me.”
All he could see was the top of John’s head. He sat in the wingback leather seat, glass in his hand. An amber liquid threatened to spill from the side as the glass sat haphazardly on the arm of the chair, fingers barely gripped around it. John’s typically sandy blonde hair was dark from lack of washing, mashed this way and that against his skull. Sherlock felt a tight pull in his chest.
“How’d I do?” Sherlock asked as soon as the door was shut, not even ashamed of his eagerness. John didn’t reply as he trotted down the last few steps from the flat. Sherlock felt a jab of anxiety curl up in his left side. He followed a bit behind John. The man was walking at a fast pace, even for Sherlock’s much longer legs, and wouldn’t quit glancing over his shoulder. Finally he halted in front of an alleyway. Sherlock met him tentatively at his side. “John? Is everything—“
. I love that you only eat when you’ve solved a case, that you admit we are a normal couple when we are the farthest thing from it, and that you come to bed with me without questions. I love the coldness of your skin, the curls at the nape of your neck and the sound of your breathing when you sleep. I love that you move around me, allowing me to be your sun, without even realizing it. You are mine, too, Sherlock. You are my sun, too.”
“Mycroft pinpointed three locations he determined you could be. We found you last, and nearly too late. It’s very fortunate he is able to take the helicopter whenever it’s needed. We brought a doctor with us, prepared for the worst. They stabilized you as best as they could on the helicopter and we life-flighted you back to St. Bart’s. Oh, and Mycroft blew up the hell hole you escaped from. Thought you’d want to know.”
Screaming filled his ears. The sound of sirens was deafening. There were bodies in the street, black and limp against the red of fire. He knelt next to his first patient: it was a young girl. Hot, fresh blood was trickling down the side of her head, and had begun to dry and mat in her long, black hair. She couldn’t be older than eleven years of age. John rested his hand on her cheek and looked straight up at the dark, glowing, unforgiving sky. He blinked away the tears. Stabilized, he turned back to the young girl. She was still breathing. “Come on, sweetheart. Open your eyes, please.” The child turned her head toward John. Her eyes were huge and brown and full of tears. “There you are. Hi, hello. My name is Captain Watson, and I’m here to make you better. Would you mind telling me your name?” Watson desperately hoped the girl understood English. Most of the younger children living in Kandahar and Kabul did, but that didn’t guarantee anything.
John opened his eyes, and then his heart was in his ears, rattling against the ribs in his chest. “Let me OUT” is what it would say, if it could speak. Sherlock was up on one elbow, hovering over John, his eyes moving over every square inch of him. John was being memorized, recorded, saved into the hard drive of this brilliant, beautiful, mad man. John barely shook his head in awe before deciding. Fuck it.
“I look forward to it. I’ve been trying to capture your attention for quite a while now, Mr. Holmes.”
John didn’t consider himself much of a dancer, but somehow he got sorted very quickly with this terrifying, tantalizing man. The stranger laced one of his palms to the small of John’s back and gave a small pull. Their hips touched, and John felt a familiar heat bloom in his stomach. He licked his lips and looked from where their hips were grinding together up to his face. John opened his mouth, to ask the stranger his name, but a long, lithe finger came to rest across Watson’s lips. They were cold, and John suddenly had a desire to take it in his mouth.
“I’m with you, B. I know what you mean.” John tapped out a rhythm on the condensation covered bottle resting on his knee. “Cook her dinner. Sit her down. Shoot the shit. Knock it all out, hash it all out, let it all out.”
John wiped his brow, feeling them furrow deeper in frustration. The men waited, expectant, for John to make his next call. They were already an hour over designated end time, but the team knew better than to argue. A John this befuddled was a force to be reckoned with, and they wanted him at ease. Their match against the Broncos was only days away and something had to give; John had to loosen up or the boys needed to step up. They were willing do to their share if it meant John would just fucking relax.
“You prick! You think you’re so clever!” John was borderline breathless. The adrenaline was damn near killing him. He thought he could feel the swelling of his veins everywhere in his body. Sherlock had almost died; John shot a man; John was just
As a side note, that the marvelous Marcy09 pointed out, the ages of John and Sherlock are 30 and 27, respectively. This puts them at ages 28 and 25 during University moments. Sherlock is working on a doctorate degree (of some sort) in Chemistry, while John is finishing up medical school. He is currently trying to work out where to do his internship.
is this?” John stood gaping at the luxury sports vehicle parked in the lower level of Sherlock’s flat, which, until just now, John had not even known existed. The car was gorgeous, silver in color, perhaps clear-coated aluminium, her back one, long smooth line flowing into a set of haunches, where wide metal wheels sat inside widely stretched tires. It was sexy; it was extravagant; it was absolutely excessive. John aimed his wide eyes at the man loading up his bags in the hatch.
“Damn right, it wasn’t,” she retorted. A sad, tiny smile hit the right corner of her lips. “You’re forgiven. I think you should come with me,” she trailed as she slung her bag over her shoulder and headed for the alleyway exit.
He hated the distance. John moved forward as he shrugged out of his flannel, balling it and tossing it behind him. He relished the teasing, satisfied smirk on Sherlock’s beautiful mouth. John grabbed the hem of his shirt and pulled it up and over in one fell swoop, dropping it next to his feet. He folded over to unlace his Chucks, face agonizingly close to the ever growing hardness pressing against the thin cotton of Sherlock’s pants. He kicked off his sneakers, unbuttoned his jeans and pressed his cheek against Sherlock’s barely-covered erection. His last step out of his jeans put him flush against Sherlock, and John ran his left hand along Sherlock’s clavicle, kissed the tendons that lined the hollow of Sherlock’s throat, caressed the craters of his collarbones with the damp softness of his tongue. Sherlock’s head fell back against the wood of the door, his warm exhales coating John’s neck as he savored Sherlock’s skin, skeleton, and scent. John slipped his hand round to the small of Sherlock’s back, pulling him closer, and the other hand went to the handle of the door, swinging it open. John crowded him into the small room and shut them inside.
“Go inside. You’ll catch cold.” Sherlock kissed John’s left cheek, slowly, deliberately. “You have my number. I’ll see you soon.” John squeezed Sherlock’s hand as he turned to head back down the sidewalk.
Sherlock swept two eggs onto a plate and looked at John. There was something new in his eyes that John couldn’t quite place. He couldn’t decide if it made him excited or nervous. Sherlock returned the pan to the stove and placed a hand on the side of John’s face, thumb stroking his stubble. “You’re gorgeous in the morning.”
He glanced up faster than lightening finding the ground and peered into her face. “Mols? What’s the matter?” He jerked his eyes to Sherlock, narrowed them, and then went back to her. “Baby?”
John listened for a few minutes more, in awe, and once the piece seemed to be coming to an end, he rapped on the wood of the doorjamb. “Do you mind if I interrupt?”
He glanced back to Sherlock to find the dirty-blonde now looking at him, Sherlock doing the talking. Graham nodded, a handsome half-smile stealing the lower part of his face. He was attractive. Quite attractive. Tall, lean, all charm. He had blue eyes, wasn’t far from Sherlock’s height, and was dressed in a white button up and fitted trousers. He stuck out sore here amongst the urban dress, and John immediately went to
Sherlock acknowledged the heaviness in the pit of his stomach with a bit of dislike. This feeling was foreign to him, and was becoming more and more difficult to identify. It was a treacherous line between anxiety and exhilaration, and Sherlock couldn’t decide which it was more of.
She tucked a blonde-tipped strand of hair behind her ear, the end of it falling right at her collarbone. “Okay. Listen. I think you should do something neutral with an accent.”
John smiled at him, and nodded, silently agreeing. The kettle began to yell and John took it off, pouring the boiling water over the tea. He picked up the glasses and carried them past Sherlock into the sitting room, two coasters already set in place for them. They sat on the sofa, Sherlock folding himself up into a tiny space. John smiled at his navy and red argyle socks peeking out from the hems of his blue jeans. The telly was on, but it was barely a whisper. John scooped up some of his thai basil chicken.
“You wash, I’ll rinse? I'll be on my best behavior, I promise.” John nodded and began scrubbing, passing the sudsy dishes off to Jane. They were dried and stacked in a neat pile next to her side of the sink. John wiped down the counters and stove and dropped the sponge in the sink.
John opened the door in the music hall without knocking. Sherlock stood on the stage facing the velvet curtain. His body fluxed in unison with the notes he was creating. The new piece was darker than his others, low and growling and deliciously fierce. It moved between filling every crevice of the hall and hardly any of it at all. It yelled and whispered all at once. It was entrancing, and reminded John of a chase leading to an unfortunate capture.
a case, but John wasn’t aware of that. And Sherlock did want his identity, for the most part, to remain secret where they were going. He watched John as he tensed, turning over into a defense mode he had not yet encountered. It was both terrifying and undeniably attractive.
He shifted back and forth on his feet. He didn’t want to go. He wanted to crawl back into bed and take a damp flannel to John, kiss him awake, clean him up, and drag him under the covers. But he hadn’t been invited to stay. If he was truthful with himself, he was nervous of John’s reaction after having time to articulate a proper response to everything that had transpired. Nothing about their lovemaking had said casual, non-committed, or unlikely-to-occur-again. But they hadn’t discussed it, before or after, and like a dolt, he’d fallen asleep without engaging that conversation.
John groaned in the back of his throat and looked at the closed door to Oliver’s room. He still didn’t know why Oliver left the house yesterday, or why he was at that warehouse. He felt like he
Anytime I have someone speak a different language in this fic, I'll leave a translation in the notes!
John leaned over Oliver and picked him up, his head lolling against John’s shoulder and his arm hanging. The Holmes followed him out to the rental car and helped him settle Oliver into the backseat before he got into the front and waved goodbye.
“D-ad,” his voice cracked, and John whipped around in his chair. Oliver was sitting on the edge of the couch, his hands gripping the edge, looking like he might vomit. His pupils were blown and he’s shaking, trying to take a deep breath that kept hitching in his throat. Panic attack.
He could feel Sherlock’s breath against his own, he smelt like mint toothpaste from this morning. Sherlock pushed forward and kissed him again, nodding into it. John’s heart thudded and adrenaline coursed through his veins. He’d wanted this for so long.
Oliver pinned the photo back to his wall with a sigh. “I saw him a lot when I was really young, like before I realized there was a difference between grandparents and parents. But he wasn’t around when I grew older. So grandmother made him show up for my eighth birthday, and that’s sort of when I realized he was my father. I think it was the first time he realized, y’know, that I was
Oliver knew they were trying to one up each other with the compliments and he laughed at how childish and unnecessary it seemed.
“What will it take?” John asked, more confident this time. How long had Oliver been wanting to asked this? Why didn’t John consider it before? It just made sense to adopt Oliver, and to make everything official like that.
The police had about a million questions for them, and John had forgotten that they  both hated this part of solving cases for the actual government. When they helped clients, they usually didn’t have to sit around waiting to answer questions and fill out paperwork. John wondered if Sherlock was going to start taking clients again.
Oliver’s hands slid over the paper before ripping it off and pushing it too the floor. A simple, unmarked cardboard package stared back at him. He glanced at John, then back down and let his hands flit over it to the edges. He worked his fingers under the edge and lifted the cardboard open, then froze, his mouth open and eyes huge.
John looked to Oliver, brow furrowed. Oliver only spoke in French when he didn’t realize he was doing it or if he didn’t want someone to hear what he was saying. John positively heard his name too.
John took his hand away, he didn’t know what Oliver said, but he obviously didn’t want to be comforted. “Okay, okay.”
Caden’s fist connected with his forearm and he grunted - Caden’s strength outmatched Oliver’s by a million - his arm went numb. Caden shoved him, and Oliver slammed into a wall, his head snapping off the brick, his vision flashing white. He crossed his arms in front of his face, flinching away, but Caden grabbed his wrists and pulled them away from his face, then slammed him into the wall again.
Sherlock’s arms were wrapped around him, his fingers in John’s hair, and John twisted the front of Sherlock’s button-down in his fist, and he could feel the gentle pounding of Sherlock’s heart. John didn’t know what to do. He didn’t want to feel anymore.
“It’s like… when I was sinking through the water before you pulled me out. I struggled at first but then the pressure on my chest made it hard to even fight it. That’s what the panic attacks feel like,” Oliver said. “Like I’m sinking into darkness, but I can see the top of the water and I’m trying to swim to it as hard as I can, but no matter what it’s... just where I can’t quite reach.”
Sherlock simply smiled and said that one of the boys reminded him of his version of a younger John. He then got up and went to the kitchen, leaving a blushing John on the couch
He took a deep breath and told himself that he’d be able to meet Sherlock again; hear his voice and know it wasn’t just in his head. Closing his eyes, John spread his arms. As he fell forward, he thought he heard Sherlock’s voice shout his name. He dismissed it, and soon the ground took away his thoughts with a sickening crunch.
Jen gave a small nod, wrapping her arms around the consulting detective. Sherly let out a soft exhale that could’ve been taken as a sigh of relief. She didn’t like fighting with Jen. The doctor kissed the top of her head and Sherly made a small hum of approval in response. She kissed Jen’s cheek softly, making sure the doctor knew she was forgiven.
However, guilt had gotten the better of her, and she had decided to return to 221B. She was using her cane again, and a small boy held her other hand.
“And do what?” Jen asked. She couldn’t see the point when while lying here she could hold onto Sherly for reassurance.
Sherly frowned. “I would have thought you were keeping an eye on things, since we had one pip left.”
She and Sherlock would have things to talk about later, but for now, it looked like things just might work out.
Lestrade sighed. “I should have guessed. You know that was public property, you could be arrested for this.”
“Thank you.” Sherly rung off and dropped the phone carelessly onto the bed. She lay back and closed her eyes listening to the shower running on the other side of the wall.
“He feels like he has to control everything, but the fact that he pays extra attention to you shows how much he cares.”
Eventually John told Sherlock through the door that he would be back tomorrow and left. He came back everyday for the next three weeks, but Sherlock still refused to let him in.
Sherly watched Jen think and drew conclusions about what was going through the doctor’s head from the expression on her face. After a few minutes Sherly accused, “You think I should care about Mycroft more.”
The summer turned out to be grey and humid, much like the past spring. With more rain and basically awful weather in general. John had held onto a little bit of hope that it would be nicer, but he knew not to expect a nice summer like last year’s. Especially in a place like London, when it seemed like the only two seasons were rain and mud. It felt like the world trying to warn him of something. Like a bad omen.
When he sat back down and slid hers over to her, she snapped out of it. “How about you, John? How’s Ollie?”
Out of the corner of his eye he saw Oliver slide his headphones off so they hung around his neck, then look up at John. He didn’t speak so John pretended not to notice, investing himself instead in the black search screen. Hm, what a nice shade of white.
She reached out and took Oliver’s hand. “You look just like him,” she said. Then she smiled wide and shook his hand. “Welcome to Baker Street, dear.” She pat his cheek and turned back to the stove, all business again. “Now, how do you like your eggs?”
John grabbed a glass and filled it for him, then pressed it into his hands and gave him some ibuprofen, telling him he should probably lay down.
“Remember my niece, Emily?” Molly asked. “She’s been getting quite low marks recently in school, and I was wondering - if possible - Oliver would like to tutor her? She’s in the grade below him, and I’d be willing to pay Oliver if he’d like.”
John smiled a bit, then turned to face him fully. “Mainly you have to try and get him to regulate his breathing. Oliver hyperventilates during most of his attacks, and if it goes for too long, he’ll pass out. Sometimes he pulls his hair or digs his nails into his skin, so just pull his arms away and hold them if he does. I’ve found giving him something to focus his hands on helps, which is why we have three of those,” John pointed to the rubik’s cube on the mantel.
“Both of you! Stop!” John shouted again, then stepped forward and grabbed Oliver’s shoulder, pushing him back until he sat on the couch. “Sherlock, just - walk, okay? Go for a few minutes.”
A tiny piece of John begged him to run after Sherlock, to go with him on the case, to forget the the past two years had happened and pretend for a few hours that everything was alright. Then he heard Oliver’s distinct laugh, and John remembered why he would never do that. Instead, he wrote for a while on his laptop, finished reading his book and cleaned up a bit to keep busy.
They arrived at the Holmes estate later on, and had dinner with Violet and Sigar, who told them Mycroft would be visiting a few hours the next day.
It’s eleven at night and John hasn’t moved from staring at the spot in the carpet. The waiting room is empty and Sherlock’s taken to pacing around the room, wringing his hands. He sat down, then stood up, walked to the window and stayed there for a minute. Then he walked back over to John and sat down.
John looked out at him again too. Sigar was saying something, causing Oliver to giggle a little and look up at the night sky.
Caden stopped walking and turned to him. “Oh wait, after the way you pushed poor Emily away, she probably hates you now anyways. Whoops.” He laughed. “Well, you don’t have to worry about any of that anymore.”
“Better to get it over with now,” she said. John hummed in agreement. When he finished helping her with the dishes, he stepped into the hall and text Mycroft, asking if he thinks it’s a good idea to bring Oliver home tomorrow. Mycroft responded saying if that’s what John thought was best, he’d bring Oliver home.
PLEASE REMEMBER: There is a scene in this chapter that has a lot of French in it. Instead of writing it all out in French, it's in
In his hands, he played with a pack of cigarettes and a lighter that Caden gave him a few days ago. The pack is full, because he hasn’t smoked at all unless he’s with Caden - because he
“Well, he raised his marks to the standard, so I’ve got a new schedule sorted for him. He’ll be able to do his classwork ahead of the others at his own pace if he keeps marks
“He’s quiet, actually,” John said. “Maybe you can meet him over the holidays. I’ve been thinking about having some people over for New Years. It’s been very quiet and I think he and I need some company for a bit.”
John kept rubbing soothing circles on Oliver’s back. “It’s because you were were hyperventilating, and all the oxygen was coming and going before it could circulate.”
The reason I pushed back the date to two weeks from now, is because I'm starting college in a few days and don't want to worry about updating for a bit. I hope you all understand.
“Mhm, I got your advisor to talk to me,” John said. “He said if you raise your marks to a standard, after the holidays he’ll help change up your curriculum.”
How do you not have him?” John knew first hand the impossibility of avoiding Mycroft Holmes, how could a fourteen year old do it?
Oliver sighed, resting his chin on his knee again and turning the cube over in his hands. “I’ve never told anyone, but I’m always afraid I’m going to die. I can’t breathe when it happens and sometimes my feet and hands get numb, and my heart beats too fast.”
A large wooden beam had broken off the ceiling and fallen to the floor, leading up to the second floor. Oliver put his foot on it, testing the balance, then put his arms out and rushed up it. A section of the building they hadn’t been able to get to before was open now, the walls bare of graffiti. Not much besides a file cabinet laying on its side and broken lumber lay up there, so he walked back down.
Violet dropped another plate into the sink and stood next to him drying the dishes. “John, I can’t thank you enough for taking care of Ollie.”
“Okay!” He called for John. John came in with the wheelchair, and Oliver would have been embarrassed about being wheeled out in it, but he was too exhausted to walk out on his own anyways. At least he was leaving the smell of chemicals and sick people behind.
John almost laughed aloud at one of a stricken-looking Mycroft holding toddler Oliver out at arm's length, while Oliver was mid-laugh, covered in mud and leaves. By far the most interesting, John gently lifted off the wall to inspect. It had been taken without the subject’s knowledge. Oliver, a few years younger than he was now, sat across an empty table from Sherlock, who was younger and looked much more tired than John at ever seen him. They were staring intently at each other with passive, somewhat curious faces, as if they had never really seen each other before. Sherlock’s hair was longer in the photo and he wasn’t as impeccably dressed as usual. Oliver’s hair was a few shades lighter than now, and his head tilted slightly to the side.
THANK YOU SO MUCH to everyone who commented, gave me kudos and bookmarked this story!! I love you all sooo much and you're the reason this series keeps going.
This is one of my top favorite chapters for this fic, because I love love love writing angst. I had drowning scene planned before I even started writing the story, and I'm so glad it's written and you guys can read it.
“It was just an accident,” Oliver’s doctor was saying. It was the same woman as last time. “He must have just twisted the wrong way in his sleep, or moved too fast and pulled both sets of stitches, on his liver and on the outside. That’s what caused the internal bleeding. Luckily, he woke up and realized something was wrong, it could have been much worse.”
face on this boy. He felt his stomach drop and he chest filled with cotton. What if he couldn’t do this?
Oliver jumped up, tucking the telescope under his arm with care and lifting the box that still contained the mount for it. “Let’s go!”
John understood that. He sighed, then said, “I can have someone put me in contact with your doctor. On one condition.”
“I love you,” John blurted as a whisper, like the last words on someone’s dying breath. It blew through the room like wind from nowhere, carrying words not dared be spoken by either of them in all their time together. It was fleeting, said by millions of people everyday, but to them it was so taboo that the silence that filled the air around those words was so thick they could carve it out with nothing but the sharp edges of their fractured hearts.
After midnight, when it officially became 2012, Mycroft left and offered to drive Lestrade home, as there weren’t many cabs out in the crazy weather. He offered to Molly, but she said they were taking the tube and the station wasn’t too far. Harry waved him off before he could ask. They bid everyone a goodnight and left into the angry storm.
I'm planning on it being a trilogy, I guess. This fic is the first one, and there is 16 total chapters.
Oliver shook his head, then stepped out of the doorway to let them in. Emily, who had been to the flat almost every week for a year straight, brushed past Caden and started up the stairs. Caden shrugged to Oliver, then they followed her up. She waited for them outside the door to the flat, and Oliver pushed it open, walking into the living room.
A hole ate through Oliver’s very core, and he wanted to be swallowed up by the ground and never see day again.
John didn’t fall asleep until after three in the morning, the shadows in his bedroom taunting him and dancing like people, his mind racing through half-formed thoughts. Nightmares kept him tossing and turning. He woke up late, and it took longer than he would have liked to get out of bed - already the start to a bad day. He showered and shaved for the first time in days. It gave him the illusion of being “
Oliver and Caden lay next to each other on the roof of the warehouse, watching the stars appear in the darkened sky. He knew it was just past eight at night, and he should probably go home, but he didn’t really want to yet. He checked his phone, and saw a text from John asking him to text back so John knew he was safe. Oliver responded saying he’s sorry, he’ll come home soon and he’s with Caden.
John laughed, feeling the tension in his shoulders disappear. He let go of Oliver, who was somewhat shivering, and nodded to Mycroft. He lead the both up to the flat, his hand on Oliver’s back, as if subconsciously he was afraid Oliver would disappear if he let go.
Oliver put his hand back in his pocket and stepped into the living room, facing Sherlock’s armchair. He moved past it and sat down in one of the chairs at the desk, and kept looking around the flat. John wondered if he could deduce things like Sherlock and Mycroft could. The same people raised them, they grew up in the same home. But - times also change. No doubt he was smart though - that, at least, seemed to be a Holmes trait.
John became more desperate with each unsuccessful try. He might have been crying but it might just be the water running from his hair. He didn’t care, all that was important was Oliver. Saving Oliver.
“Nothing explicitly,” Mycroft leaned on his ever present umbrella. “He starts school next Monday, it’s a new school but I stopped there on the way over so he knows where it is.”
John had promised Harry he’d go to lunch with her on Thursday, so he took an hour off for lunch at work to meet her. She’d picked a quaint sandwich shop with a low flow of customers. When Johns stepped in, Harry was already seated by the window, and just seeing her lifted his mood a bit. John did miss his sister, and he was happy everytime he saw her because of how much she’s cleaned herself up over the years.
John sat silently for a moment, thinking over this new information. “And Molly? There wasn’t a sniper on her?”
Oliver walked into the living room and John looked up at him from the chair. His wet curly hair shined, and he pursed his lips. He didn’t say anything as he looked from John to Sherlock’s armchair, then back to John. Oliver stepped forward, lifted his foot and put it onto the cushion of the chair, dust drifting off it and swirling into the air. He pressed his foot down and lifted so he was standing on the cushion, then turned around and sunk down so his legs were crossed.
” Oliver rolled his eyes and brushed by her. He walked over to John’s chair and sat down in it, picking up the book John had left on the table. He opened it to the middle and pretended to read, intending on ignoring her for the rest of the night. She followed him and leaned against the mantle at his side. He didn’t look up.
He flicked his lighter on and off until Caden messaged him, asking if he wanted to hang out. He said yes, then sent a message to John saying he was going out, and walked into the sitting room to put on his shoes. Sherlock is sat at the desk, leaned over a thick book, and just as Oliver is about to open the door he speaks up.
This chapter is a little dull, sorry. This chapter sets up a couple plot points for the next fics in this series.
“Nonsense,” Mrs Hudson shooed him away from the shove and pulled out a pan. “Now, where’s that boy?”
It happened while they were both at home, thankfully. Saturday morning John woke to rain pounding against his window and his thigh twinging with pain. While relieved it had stopped snowing, it meant the roads would be icy and the sidewalks covered in half-melted muddy snow. At least he didn’t have to work until Monday. He pulled on a jumper - the flat felt a bit chilly - and stumbled down the stairs into the sitting room.
A call from Oliver’s school came during John’s shift at work, a week after New Year’s Eve. Worry gripped him at first, and he answered quickly, stepping out of the exam room.
Oliver’s door creaked and they both looked, Sherlock dropping his hands. Oliver stumbled into the kitchen, bumping the table with his hip, making it squeak. There was a sheen of sweat on his face, and his skin looked clammy. His right hand grasped at his abdomen, pulling his jumper taut, and his left hand steadied him against the table. His whole frame seemed to vibrate, and he swayed, eyes unfocused.
Incase you missed it, I'm double updating this week! This means I posted chapter 9 AND 10, so make sure to go back and read the last chapter too!
Oliver gave a noncommittal shrug. John then remembered Emily leaving the flat looking upset, and wondered if she knew about Oliver’s feelings and was jealous.
A grin crept along Oliver’s face while his eyes skimmed the paper. “You - you’re actually are doing it?”
He went on, his hand moving a bit to each star he pointed to. John watched his face grow relaxed, his grip on the windowsill loosen and his breathing calm. John put together enough to know he had a nightmare that led to a minor panic attack, but it blew him away that Oliver sought him out rather than his grandparents.
,” he used that name she hated. “I hoped you’d like to come visit on New Year’s Eve. I’m going to have a few people over, not many, and it’d be nice to see you.”
“I don’t know how to fix it!” John said back. Now, as John stood across the room from Sherlock and they stared at each other, he could really feel the full impact of the change. The entire distance between them that came from being apart for so long. Their eyes met for a moment of electricity, and it felt like the uncertainty of strangers meeting.
Oliver and John stayed busy, but spent evenings at the flat and made sure to have dinner together every night, as they sometimes missed each other in the morning. They went to the grocery together on Saturdays, and after John occasionally met with Lestrade, and once with Harry on a Sunday for breakfast.
“Please eat, John,” Mrs Hudson urged in a quieter voice. Out of the corner of his eye, Oliver glanced from John’s plate to John. Trying to appease her, John tried again with a piece of bacon. She smiled softly at the slight effort, then continued her spiel about the trash collector who left a mess on the back sidewalk.
“What do you do in school, Oliver?” tried John, taking a drink of his tea so he wouldn’t have to look up. The boy seemed agitated, and John could sympathize with that. He didn’t know how thrilled Oliver was to be moving in with his father’s former roommate - a stranger he had never met.
He didn’t keep track of how much he drank, but he knew it was too much. At some point John passed out on the couch, having nightmare after nightmare.
He nodded, put his headphones back on and adjusted his bag. He hefted the boxes up and walked through the kitchen to Sherlock’s old room.
John woke up the next morning, relieved that he didn’t have work until tomorrow - Monday. At the same time, though, he almost wished he did because then he wouldn’t have to sit around the house all day and
John shut his eyes. He knew he was, but he needed to shut off his thoughts. Sherlock shifted beneath him, and their foreheads pressed together. John sighed, the knot in his chest making his whole body feel strung.
(Huh, this kinda reminds me of how almost 16 years ago, Sherlock got high and accidentally got a chick pregnant. I'm not hinting at anything, but it's definitely a parallel, so you should watch out for those.)
They walked around the park, laughing and talking. Caden either held his hand or put his arm over Oliver’s shoulders, and it was nice. He felt like Caden really cared about him, which was a wonderful feeling. He knew John and his grandparents cared about him, obviously, but with Caden it was different.
John thanked them, and said he wanted to keep the progress a surprise to Oliver, which Violet seemed excited about. Oliver was due home any minute though, so they wrapped up the phone call and John ended it feeling a light emotion in his chest.
At the graveyard, John stayed in the car with his eyes closed. He didn’t want to be at the graveyard and he didn’t want to see Sherlock’s grave. Instead he leaned his head against the window and shut his eyes, willing this to be over quickly. Oliver hesitated, drumming his fingers on the door handle before eventually opening it and climbing out. John felt that maybe he should tell Oliver the gravestone was situated beneath a tree, towards the back, but his mouth wouldn’t open, and the boy already left.
After that conversation, the tension melted away and things were getting better. John found it easier to talk to Oliver, and Oliver opened up more to John. On Saturday John brought Oliver with him to do the shopping so he could help pick out meals for the week instead of just writing it down for John to find.
Oliver checked the time on his phone, surprised to see it was already one in the afternoon. Him and his friends were sitting on the roof of the warehouse, after messing around inside for a few hours and looking around on each floor. Now he sat next to Caden, who was laying back with his hands behind his head and his eyes closed. Emily was sitting on the ledge, swinging her feet and watching the sky.
“I figured as much.” Sherlock didn’t seemed too bothered by this information. He shifted a bit in his chair. “Mycroft must have told you, then. About how Oliver came to be, and - and why I never mentioned him.”
Lestrade’s phone beeped and he looked down at it. “Ah, shit, I have to go,” he said, looking up apologetically. “Casework.”
John was relieved to be taking Oliver home finally, as quiet as Oliver generally was, the flat felt even quieter without him. Sherlock had to meet with Mycroft the afternoon John was due to pick Oliver up, so he went alone.
John woke up first the next morning, which rarely happened. He still wore his jeans and jumper from the night before, and he felt stiff. Sherlock lay next to him, breathing softly, his face calm. John had his arm across Sherlock’s chest, and Sherlock’s arm was under John’s head. He watched the gentle rise and fall of Sherlock’s chest, the contrast of his white pillows against Sherlock’s raven hair, his untucked blue shirt bunched at the middle.
Mycroft didn’t answer for a moment, and worry twisted John’s gut. What if any of the Holmes didn’t want him to legally have Oliver? Before John could let his mind spiral too much, Mycroft spoke, his voice somewhat fond. “Did he finally ask you?”
“I’m very proud of you, Oliver,” John said. Oliver looked up with his mouth dropped open. “You pushed yourself to do what you needed to better your education. For that, I’m proud of you and I’m sure your grandparents will be too.”
John looked at Sherlock again, who was now absently picking at a scratch on the table with the hand that was held by a splint. A part of John wanted to ask how it happened. But once again, nobody spoke.
“Oliver, don’t be rude,” scolded Mycroft, and he took the headphones off of Oliver’s head so they hung around his pale neck.
John shut the door behind Mycroft and stepped over to the window and watched the teenager climb into the back of the car. He felt disconnected, it was so surreal. Sherlock’s
“I was just on the phone with Molly, and she’s asked if you’ll tutor Emily,” John said. “Emily’s in the grade below you, and she needs help passing her classes for the year. She’s offered to pay you as well.”
John walked over to the window in the living room and watched Oliver walk into the café, then leave a minute later with something in his hand. Well, he’s eating. That’s good. Oliver slipped his headphones over his ears, checked his phone, then walked down the street and disappeared into the morning bustle of London.
also the "i love you" scene with john and sherlock was literally the first thing i wrote for this WHOLE SERIES, thank god you guys can finally read it.
In Oliver’s hospital room, as the doctor went over the at-home care John already knew, he took a moment to watch Oliver out of the corner of his eye. He had no idea what the boy had been thinking about the past five days, he’d barely spoken more than a few words to John. Oliver looked nervous behind his tired eyes, fidgeting with his cast and the corner of his blanket. It broke John’s heart.
“The Differences between Oliver and Sherlock Holmes.” Difference one: Oliver was naturally quieter, but quicker to anger.
So John did. “Oliver lives he now,” he simply stated. They both knew it. Someone had to say it out loud.
His life with Oliver had become steady and quiet, things having finally found a routine between them. But with the routine came nothing interesting. John was back to doing practically the same thing everyday and he could feel himself falling back into a hole again. It sucked, but the past few weeks he had been doing everything to avoid that.
“Stay here.” John picked up his cane and found a med kit in the bathroom then set it on the kitchen counter and rustled through until he found an antibiotic. He spread it over Oliver’s palm while the boy watched silently, then wrapped some gauze over it. “Keep that on so it doesn’t get infected.”
climbed up the back of his throat, and he swallowed it like a rock. It settled in his stomach, cold and heavy and he left the coffee shop feeling detached.
Before John knew how to respond, Sherlock’s eyes flicked behind him and John turned, a little (but not really) surprised to see Emily, standing there and fiddling with her jumper sleeves. He can still see blood stains on her nails.
You think I haven’t realized how much I miscalculated the effect this would have?” Sherlock interrupted. “You don’t-”
Two in the afternoon the next day, John opened the front door to see Mycroft, Oliver - headphones on and a bag over his shoulder (John immediately looked away) - and some faceless man that worked for Mycroft holding two cardboard boxes.
The advisor made a noise of affirmation. “He said it will be easy to keep his marks up now. He looked rather excited, and I’m glad to see him with an expression other than bored,” he chuckled.
Oliver looked at him, then took and breath and gripped the windowsill, leaning forwards, eyes up. He lifted a hand and pointed upwards, “Iota, Nashira, Zeta, Theta, Psi…”
John sighed and rubbed his hand on the back of his neck. He understood. He didn’t mean to compare Oliver to Sherlock, because Oliver is his own person. It was just… hard not to. John could justify Oliver’s anger - he’d be angry too, being constantly compared to an absent father. Okay. From now on, John’s put his mental “Sherlock box” away in his mind and gave Oliver his own space.
Oliver wet his lips, ran his hand through his hair and tugged at some of his curls, “I don’t - I already stick out enough. People think I’m weird.”
Sherlock shuddered out a breath and nodded, leaving the flat in a few quick strides. John turned to look at Oliver, who slumped down and crossed his arms, still seething.
The following day he got a call from Molly saying she’d be over for New Year’s Eve with her niece. John walked on eggshells around the topic of Oliver, before she had the same reaction as Lestrade but with a lot more silence followed by the quiet question, “Does he look like him?”
It took close to ten minutes for Oliver’s breathing to even out and the fingers still digging into his skull loosened, then dropped to his side. He heaved a sigh and lifted his head, dragging a hand down his face.
Sherlock!” Oliver finished, then pushed past John and ran into his room. The door slammed shut behind him.
“Of course I am!” John snapped at him. “First you coming back, the Oliver starting to get distant again, then all this!”
“No, no, of course not,” he said. “Oliver, you and I came to an agreement before the holidays that if he raised his marks by the new year, I would help change his curriculum around to better suit his academic needs.”
. John jerked back and slammed his fist into the cabinet above him, the wood splintering under his knuckles.
“Thank you,” John said, squeezing his arms, then pulling Oliver forward into a hug. He stood up after a second.
John frowned and took it from him, then pulled out a short letter from Oliver’s teacher. He read through it and sighed. Apparently Oliver’s marks were some of the lowest in the class from not turning his work in and not paying attention during class. The teacher said if things stayed the way they were she’d have to call in a meeting and if his marks got worse, he may have to return to his own grade level.
John kissed him again, hand on Sherlock’s collar, holding him in place. Sherlock put his hands on John’s shoulders and gently pushed him back.
Oliver, visibly shaking with anger and John couldn’t recall a single other time Oliver had been this angry before. Oliver jabbed a finger towards Sherlock. “He’s being insufferable! He doesn’t understand what he’s done to everyone, he-!”
Oliver nodded and sat at the kitchen table, watching Mrs Hudson cook. Mrs Hudson chattered on, gossiping about the baker in the cafe downstairs and his wife. She asked through the doorway what case Sherlock’s working on, and he gave a vague answer. They had decided not to tell her about the taps weeks ago, it was better that she didn’t know.
John’s fingers found the bottom of Oliver’s jumper and slid it up, revealing the blood gushing out between torn stitches and the awful dark bruise that webbed across Oliver’s skin from the inside, like a spiderweb. Internal bleeding.
He practically vaulted down the stairs, breathing easier when he left the flat, and opened the front door. Both his friends stood there, Emily looking agitated and Caden wearing a smug smile.
John walked to the front door and opened it loudly then shut it, so Oliver would know he returned home. The music shut off and Oliver appeared in the kitchen doorway while John took off his shoes.
Oliver expected John to yell, and he gasped when instead John pulled him into a hug. He felt terrible, he knew the trouble he had caused but he accepted the hug, and buried his face in the warmth of John’s jumper. John must hate him now, he wouldn’t want Oliver around if he caused problems like this. Mycroft had stayed silent in the car, and Oliver knew he was in for it by the look on his Uncle’s face.
Oliver's French dialogue (i do not speak French at all, this is all through the shameless use of Google translate btw):
The park looked empty when he arrived, and he double checked his phone to make sure he was in the right area. Oliver should be right there somewhere. John began walking closer to where it showed Oliver should be, while looking around. He stopped in front of a bench and his heart dropped into his stomach. Oliver phone sat abandoned on the bench. He picked it up with shaking fingers and tapped the screen. It lit up with an unsent message typed into the box.
Anna’s frown didn’t leave her face and she tilted her head. “Hm, but he’s sort of like your’s, right?”
“I… apologize - if it seems like I’m not worried for Oliver,” Sherlock said. “I just - don’t know how to deal with everything I’m feeling. I’m just trying to do what I know best for him. Solve the case.”
John followed, leaning heavily on his cane while Oliver rushed past into his bedroom. They then spent the better part of an hour setting up the mount so the telescope would look out Oliver’s bedroom window, making sure the extra lens it came with worked and that everything situated correctly.
John put Christmas music on the radio and the three of them had fun putting up decorations and cooking the whole day. The flat smelt of the wood smoke, roasting meat, potatoes and later on pies and pastries. Most of the food they made they were saving for New Years when they’d have more company.
