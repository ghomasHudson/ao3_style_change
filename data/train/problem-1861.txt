“What of your obsession with my seed?”  John suddenly asked.
“Mr. Holmes?”
Sherlock’s blush deepened.
John settled back on his side of the couch, leaning into the corner where the arm met the back.
“If I’m naked where would I keep a knife?”  Sherlock answered.
Sherlock bit his lips and shifted a bit in the bed so they were face to face.  “You will remain my lover?”
I shook my head.  I could feel my cheeks burn in embarrassment.
“He isn’t a goldfish or a gerbil… he is a warg… a genetically manipulated werewolf crossed with human DNA.”
“Not right now…” John shook his head with a smile.  “I’m not a teenager.”
“Now you know.”
And when John woke again there was light edging in around the draperies.  Sherlock’s fingertips pulled away from where they had been lightly caressing John’s cheek.  “Morning…” John mumbled.
“Shut up.” John whispered dangerously.  “Why didn’t you take your suppressants?  You knew what would happen if no Alpha was around to help you.  You could have died.”
“You have no idea, do you?  You honestly have no idea what sort of appeal you have for people.  There’s Molly, the Woman…”
“Arrangements can change.”  Sherlock assured him.
Lady Irene entered the hall and made her way to where John sat, bowing low before him.  “My lord.”
The brunette’s body stirred and he pulled off to lounge beside John, his eyes scanning the other man’s body.  “You didn’t…”
“No… You’re perfect.”  John answered, rubbing Sherlock’s back absently.
John stood on tiptoes and kissed him, drawing his mouth down to meet him.
It was in those woods that Sherlock lost his sense of direction while chasing a man with horns on his head.  Said man had been peeping into the windows of the house, causing Sherlock quite the shock to see another living soul.  The horns gave him pause.  But he was lured out of the house and searching the woods before he even thought to put on his coat or scarf.

"Yes, of course. Mrs Hudson will be so happy."
“Is it supposed to feel like this? It feels like I'm burning and I can't do anything about it.”
"Oh my ..." John promptly dropped the bags of shopping and walked over to the younger man.
"What?"
“Thank fuck for that.” John grins, flopping back down onto the bed and wrapping Sherlock in his arms.
The older teen lies down and gently pulls Sherlock down with him, giving him a soft smile.

The man seemed unusually happy considering he was in a graveyard and it annoyed Sherlock immensly.
"You didn't take a lot of convincing." John winked, before heading to the bathroom. "I'm going for a shower. Be good, Princess and goodbye, my love." John added, kissing them both as he passed.
Sherlock just stays where he is and stares his husband down, daring him to do something.
“Sherl, let's just get it over with. You know he'll just be a dick about it all night.” John sighs, dragging himself up off the couch.
“God, you'll be the death of me one day, love.” John sighs happily, kissing Sherlock's forehead.
“How about I leave you guys to it? I'm not a home-wrecker after all.”
It seemed like a daft question but he had to know.
“Um.”
"Really, what did he want?" Sherlock asked; currently engrossed in an experiment.

“I love it when you talk dirty.” John grins, pulling out and shoving back in before Sherlock can think of a witty remark.
John and Sherlock have been friends since Sherlock was seven years old when John decided to befriend the 'freak'.
“You made it, good. Who's this?”
"Oh, of course she is." Sherlock replied sarcastically.
“Lift your legs up a bit, it will feel better.” John says, gently guiding Sherlock's legs up into a bending position.
"Why? I can't give her anything. I can't love, John. I'm trying to but I can't." Sherlock replied, the mask slowly crumbling and revealing the detective's true emotions.
.” Sherlock moaned, looking up at John through his eyelashes,
“Hold still, I'm gonna add a bit of mascara too.”
“Why do I have to go to school so early, daddy?”
"Do I have to wait three years?”
Sherlock sighed and rolled his eyes but followed his partner and daughter into the kitchen.
"Bye."
Greg grins as John walks into the café looking a little mussed and ruffled; no doubt thanks to Sherlock's new found libido. He was definitely going to give the younger lad stick for not properly checking himself over this morning. And of course, he'd take credit for him and Sherlock finally getting it on, he did instigate their first kiss after all.
"Hey! Don't talk to me like that! I only asked a question. I don't actually come across vampires every day. Like you said, 'You don't get seen. Normally'." Maggie replies, not willing to be talked to like a child.
“What thing, dear?” Mrs Hudson asked with concern, sitting herself down in her own armchair.
“You’re lying. I know you are.”
“Please,
“Of course.” Sherlock replies softly, leaning in to kiss John.

“What do you think, John?” Sherlock asks with a smile.
"It's bigger on the inside."
"You were drunk. As I recall, you said; 'You know something, Sherlock, you're incredibly attractive and have amazing eyes. I'm surprised women aren't all over you. And, if I wasn't certain I was straight, I'd probably go out with you. Is that weird?' So I asked if you were saying that you fancied me and you replied; 'Of course, who wouldn't? And with that body of yours, I bet you're amazing in the sack'."
She became very tall within two years
John moans loudly and continues to hit that spot every time, feeling Sherlock's body tense tighter and tighter.
Davies, Sherlock thinks he's called, in all honesty he hasn't bothered to remember his first name, after all, he's just a warm body for Sherlock to abuse.
“It's fine, Dad. I'm used to it by now.” Harriet chuckled, making her way down the stairs.
“Well, actually … its just the Doctor. Nothing else.” The Doctor laughed, ruffling his hair.
“You alright there, Sher? Don't tell me I'm stood here washing your hair and your having dirty fantasies about me.” John grins, moving into his boyfriend's body and running his hands down his chest.
He checks his wounded shoulder and sees that it's healed quite well considering, even though there's an ugly scar left behind.
So what will John do?

"Thank you, Doctor, wherever you are."
The tv goes quiet and Mycroft exits Mrs Hudson's flat, calling up to his brother.
“Not til I get what I want.” Davies growls dangerously and Sherlock realises he's made a very fatal error.
"Ssh, you'll wake Harriet." Sherlock giggled from the bed.
Greg smiles sadly at his partner, so rare it is that he is prone to emotion and sentiment that Greg sometimes forgets how capable he is of such human things.
“I'll be downstairs, scream if you need me.” Mycroft replies, heading for the door.
“So does this mean that we're
“Not me, Sally. Two other people.” Greg grins, grabbing the mistletoe from her fingers.
"Typical that you wouldn't know.” John actually laughed, shaking his head. “Two years."
“Wait, what does that mean?” Greg asks, reading the email over Mycroft's shoulder.
John bites his lip to prevent a moan and spreads Sherlock's legs wider. He lifts the younger man's hips and pushes into him slowly, watching as Sherlock arches up.
“Actually, our little rendezvous on the couch made me... um... well, I thought I could see to that myself and have you watch.”
“Someone was taking notes ... when I gave him a blow job, wasn't he?” John moans, recognising his own technique.
They walk in silence for while, passing by the different shops on the way back to Greg and Mycroft's university, both teens thinking about their boyfriends and where they'll be in a few years.
“Sherlock? Oh God, I'm still asleep.”
“Good morning, Maggie. Sorry, I was thirsty. And well, it was easy to work out where you lived. After all, I am a vampire, I can smell you.”
Sherlock just stares at his pale fingers splayed across John's slightly darker tanned chest, moving his fingers experimentally.
Sherlock didn’t quite manage to suppress the moan that escaped.
“I was hungry. But I found a lovely little snack on my way home.” The vampire smiles, clearly remembering the poor sod he killed last night.
Sherlock watched as the Doctor flicked numerous switches and dials. It was very exciting.
“So what about yours then?” Greg asks instead, smiling at the old woman before leaving.
"It's your fault, you bloody tease." John growled and jumped on Sherlock, biting his neck teasingly.
Sherlock immediately recognised that voice, "John?"
John drops to his knees as pain overwhelms him; holding a hand to his side to keep pressure on his wound.
After ten minutes in the house, Sherlock asks to step outside and get some fresh air while John continues searching.
John chuckles and kisses his nose lightly, “You're so cute when you blush.”
“I'll be waiting.” Mycroft whispers, his tone still suggestive as his hand touches Greg's waist and moves down lower.
“I'd never hurt her, no matter how hungry I was.” John whispers, turning to look at his mate.
“So, I look alright then?”
“Oh, I do. Always.”
“But, Sir ...”
Then suddenly Amy shoves her out of the kitchen straight into the arms of …
Amy rolled her eyes at her friend, turning round to get the glasses for her guests.

– all at once John needed to be closer to him, pressing his mouth into Sherlock’s mouth as his left hand confidently unfastened Sherlock’s buckle and the first clasp of his trousers as he crowded him back with his entire body to stretch across the length of the sofa. Sherlock licked up into John’s mouth with humming approval and shifted his knees to pin them around John’s sides, lifting his hips forward. John’s breath caught; his jeans would very soon be either completely superfluous or ruined. He didn’t much care.
‘Oh, have you forgotten?’ Sherlock rejoined, as it occurred to him with a flare of relish. ‘Alas: Official Secrets.’ He pretended to lock his mouth and throw away the key, before gleefully going about — oh, John hadn’t made any coffee. In a hurry. He’d be grumpy all morning. — putting the kettle on and rummaging for something vaguely edible.
a tailored suit for John in the wings until just such an occasion arose;
‘Sherlock, you have to understand. I’m not proud of those things. My gun, or how I treated all the girlfriends you helped me chase out of here, or the gambling, or wanting to go punch Gruener’s bloody lights out.  I’ve not always been as good a man as I could have been. Should have been. And now you’re telling me “it’s what I’m like”? That’s… ’
A long, long pause followed this question. In the pause he felt his heart pounding, not fast but almost surreally slow, beating the long, heavy seconds in which everything they struggled to say or resolve or confront about themselves and each other seemed to whisper like the ticking of the radiator.
‘In that case.’ John came forward, finally unlocking his arms and stepping into the kitchen where Sherlock was frozen in place, fingers cramping where he was holding the book open to this particular, wholly extraordinary page. ‘Sherlock Holmes —’
Part of this, John could admit in the privacy of his own thoughts, was of course his own doing: overly sensitive about their new relationship, about how much it meant to him. (
(An understatement of necessarily gargantuan proportions. But to imagine that upon finding John Watson naked in bed, that Sherlock would have had the saint-like strength to resist touching him, just a little; to prevent himself from curling into John and filling his lungs with his scent until he realised that John was erect beside him, as erect as he was himself; to listen to his rational mind which had warned, ‘
, he thought furiously, eyes caressing every inch of Sherlock’s waxen face, including his unnaturally closed eyes, including where the oxygen mask was strapped over his beautiful mouth.
Missed breakfast (not that there was anything in, of course) in favour of a long shower. He’d needed one, waking up alone in their rank bed and already a Pavlovian response to Sherlock’s sheets kicked in — hence, a long, slow, dreamy shower, wondering if Sherlock could hear him, might join him, could keep him on the edge of pleasure until the hot water ran out… followed by no time left to shave, damn, damn, damn, he was very, very late. Couldn’t find the one brown tie that made this shirt (his last clean one) look somewhat decent. Hadn’t had time for coffee, and was now very late indeed for his very early shift. Only as he’d turned with his cursory survey to be sure he wasn’t leaving anything behind did he notice Sherlock, curled on the sofa, passed out in his clothes.
He had questions – wanted to know where Sherlock had slept –

He had realised during his time ‘away’ that he was grateful that they came, however vapid/thick/deluded/entitled/mundane they were, and not just for the thrill of the case. He had come to see, when he was gone from Baker Street, that, though he didn’t care for them himself, he could care about their problems — and thereby could, in no small measure, reduce the number of misunderstandings and mistakes in the world simply by doing something he already liked to do, something he was very good at doing. He could make sense of these portions of the world, when so little else seemed to make sense.)

, Sherlock wanted to say, so that John wouldn’t have to admit it. He was aware of how often he made John unhappy — how even sitting here healing was painful to John. But John continued to say ‘we’ and ‘our’ and ‘us’, and Sherlock was too selfish to tell him to stop.
‘Nope.’
Casting his mind back to yesterday’s research: he located it —
‘John,’ Sherlock grunted, his own hand groping John’s backside. John shivered, and planted his lips back on Sherlock’s as his hand began to stroke clumsily, restlessly, along Sherlock’s prick. Before long Sherlock was leaking onto his palm, slicking each stroke while he whined into John’s ear.

‘I’m a doctor, Violet,’ he change his angle of attack, scenting that he was several hands down, and need to come up with a better hand very, very soon or lose the whole round. ‘and I have a sister, and I’m just saying I wouldn’t want my sister spending time with someone who hurts animals for fun, and whose ex-wife filed for divorce only to wind up gasping for air, choking in the middle of the sea —’
‘It really wasn’t.’ John looked at him pointedly. ‘Maybe tomorrow, or whenever the, er, case is finished…’ He licked his lips anxiously, the same prickle along his skin from the last time they’d sat here, except today he could see very clearly the red colour of Sherlock’s mouth and the frozen angle of his beautiful hands; couldn’t see the blotch he’d sucked into Sherlock’s neck or the unmarked places his own hands had touched and pulled and slid. ‘Maybe we can go to Angelo’s and I can not pay him with my half of our gemstone finders’ fee.

So she was happy to cut right to direct. Fine. He could do direct. ‘You know he’s responsible for three deaths — his wife’s death.’
‘Goodnight, then, madman.’ On impulse, he took the extra plunge and leaned down to kiss Sherlock briefly. Sherlock’s mouth was still slightly pink.
That had been more five months ago. He was slightly ashamed to realise he’d barely thought of her until now.
Sherlock waited, then when it became clear that John wasn’t going to –
Sherlock, whose ethics were relative at the best of times, barely batted an eyelash at this. ‘He’s not as clever as he thinks he is, and I doubt he considers himself in any danger — a miscalculation, of course, but it means he’s far less likely to shoot me first and ask questions later.

‘Naturally.’ Sherlock did know, after a fashion: knew that John and Mycroft had exchanged multiple brusque conversations that exceeded John’s customary levels of rudeness, a transgression almost exclusive to moments of anger; knew that John had been holding back these past few days — had been more frustrated than his words made it seem — that Sherlock had been tweeting, in his few seconds of privacy, to contacts outside the hospital to exaggerate the severity and nature of his injuries; saw, in the lingering side-long glances at how much food Sherlock was consuming versus how much work he had already taken up on this case (inconvenient though it continued to be from his hospital bed), John’s concern that somehow this case was taking on the shape and unstoppability of the days after the initial Reichenbach painting affair.
* * *
He shrugged noncommittally. ‘Too early to say. But we’ll both know more by this afternoon.’
No one wolf-whistled, or even seemed to notice, for which Sherlock was deeply grateful.
For a moment, John felt a surge of terror jangle beneath his ribcage. He suddenly feared, despite his own words, that if Sherlock left his bed now neither of them would know how to get back to it. Reality and the outside world would reappear and they wouldn’t discuss it, Sherlock would pretend it hadn’t happened and John would laugh it off, and then he would have to go back to living
His nostrils flared as he attempted to gather enough air into his stinging lungs without the humiliation of gasping like a drowned rat in his own living room. Too much –

, he thought to himself. It was obviously possible that she’d changed emails since they’d dated in the spring, but — well, he wished he’d managed to remember her sooner. Send her some kind of closure email at the very least. He sincerely hoped nothing bad had happened, though, if he was honest with himself, what would he really have done? They’d cared about each other, sure, got on better than pretty much any of his other girlfriends, suited each other with an appreciation of dark humour and an agreement not to dig too deep into each other’s pasts just for some tit-for-tat ‘get to know you’ game. Even Paris, in retrospect, hadn’t been
The woman, dressed in a very sensible outfit of flattering yet flexible jeans and a similarly mobile pepper-gray coat, was regarding steadily him, an unblinking (almost amused?) gaze somewhat at odds with their current positions. She was on the earlier side of middle-aged (about his own age), dyed-blonde, perfumed (though through his partial olfactory jumble it was hard to make out), cuffs rolled up above markedly multi-purpose boots. Not remotely afraid of him. In sum: definitely not one of Gruener’s
‘And?’
The flat, at last devoid of other people, fell silent.
He got a cup of tea — he hadn’t more than touched the fine china at Violet’s before he’d been thrown out — and sat down with his laptop. Maybe it was time for him to consider brushing up a bit on literary technique, editing, marketing, that sort of thing. He had an audience, and this publisher sounded keen, but (then again) they were paid to do that. And more to the point, if and when he ever got the shock of seeing his name on the spine of an honest-to-god book in an actual bookshop, he wanted to be able to be proud of what was between the covers. What was that cliche advice he’d got from that sergeant — Daniels, who’d treated them to some original poetry — during a knees-up of a poker game past midnight?
Sherlock’s eyes shot (damn the dizziness) to look at his profile and (unshaven) right cheek: stern, tense, faded and lines from two nights of terrible sleep in these appallingly tasteless concrete slabs they let pass for wood chairs — yet even through this, he was making a joke.
For the next few hours, he threw himself into a series of self-imposed tasks. He walked the long circular route of Regents Park, in open defiance of the stifling air that threatened rain, a regulated march stopped only when he felt sweat gathering clammily at his collar. Then he ducked over to a café across the road, sitting outside beneath the awning and made some phone calls. First to the clinic, to accept some shifts for the following week; next to the hardware shop across town, who still had yet to receive the cleaner he needed to remove the metal stains from the kitchen table; to his mate from uni, Miles Hearn, wishing his answer phone a happy birthday and offering a pint for the next time he came up from Berwick. He ignored the double-beep during his message of an incoming call, and the later chimes of texts once he had hung up. Even so, when he finished it was only early afternoon, and his leg was stiff from an uneven day of activity and inactivity. He ignored his body and ventured back into the park.
‘How do you know he was clumsy?’ John asked, half-way between awed and exasperated.
was too much. There were too many obstacles, even when there was nothing and no one in between them. Sherlock brought home severed heads and noisy tropical birds and his own black moods when his trains of thought screeched and careered out of control. John didn’t want a parrot, any more than he wanted the severed head, or the melancholy – it was part of the evidence of Sherlock’s messes. Sherlock vividly remembered the malty scent of John’s sweat beneath his arms and the soft-wiry fuzz of his pubic hair, John’s smile fading from his face against his pillow in the darkness as Sherlock watched him fall asleep… but he was adrift attempting to gauge if and how much John wanted more from him.
enjoying writing it.
John quite non-figuratively marched in, catching Sherlock’s glance with — busy day, then — an amalgamated spark of fondness, irritation (with whom?), anger, and… that last look, in the flatness of his mouth, was unclear. He smelled of creamy tomato soup and, somehow also, chicken, bacon, and brown sauce (sexual intercourse generated increased appetite? Unusual, he believed, for John, but… maybe), and that unnameable scent that made Sherlock’s amygdala go haywire. Yet John’s stiff gait sent a grip of dread tangling Sherlock’s insides harshly.
, come on. You’re insane,
‘John?’ Sherlock murmured, low, and John reflexively gripped him tighter and shook his head and turned to tip Sherlock’s face to one side so he could try kissing him here, sucking a mark into his neck while his clenched hands no doubt left creases in this shirt that would be impossible to iron out. He sucked a patch over Sherlock’s artery until he squirmed, his own hands threaded in John’s hair as if ensnared.
Suddenly stilling by the door, John looked back at him. After a moment during which Sherlock’s mind echoed and resonated with jarring, contradictory attempts to read John’s frown, John spoke. ‘Let’s leave off worrying about the rest of my life until we can make firm plans for next week, shall we.’

He felt now that he did, perhaps, finally, have some idea.

do,’ Sherlock muttered, low enough that possibly Molly didn’t hear. John wished, just for a second, that they were indeed alone, in front of the fire, at home, at last, on the first evening after sleeping cramped near-but-not-too-near each other in the hospital for over a week. Even to run his fingers through Sherlock’s hair would have done
‘Obviously the other one was a man,’ Sherlock supplied, lest he have misjudged John’s threshold of credulity. ‘I didn’t hallucinate the
Molly was staring at them wide-eyed. ‘So you. You think I should… should…’
John was waiting in the sitting room. When he looked at what Sherlock had brought, he first checked Sherlock’s expression (entirely serious, even if – beneath that – he was, all right, somewhat amused at this prospect) and then made a complicated series of flutterings and jostling of his facial muscles to connote… acquiescence. ‘Yeah, fine, I’ll wear the bloody
‘Journalism. Tabloid or broadsheet?’
Was… was that a come-on?
John’s chest went very still at that: calm under fire, as he’d been trained.
‘Ah, well, there’s where you went wrong.’
The slate in front of the (barren) fireplace was the only thing Sherlock’s eyes seemed to want to look at. ‘If you are still interested in discovering what became of her, I’m sure my —’
John woke first, naturally, around sunrise (later every day, noticeably so at this time of year, even in the city). The previous night’s row was still ringing in his ears, confessions of things he’d hoped never to say out loud, to simply erase by blotting them out with more writing of new stories and new confessions, brighter of actual, honest-to-god happy memories, everyday scribbles over time. And of course, it was nearly impossible, in John’s experience, to hear such a terrible account as Suze’s and not to want to cling desperately to the closest person and hold on for dear life — to prove that there were things in life worth chasing, having, sharing, enjoying to the peak of your ability, more to being alive than just darkness and loss. It had been true in the desert, and in every hospital he’d ever worked at. Little surprise, considering how much darkness he and Sherlock saw on their cases, that they didn’t so much cling as collide.
Sherlock crossed the room to stand at its epicentre, hands in his pockets. ‘This is

‘Even if, as I shall continue to deny, I were not fine—’ (John made a sound very nearly like a growl, but said nothing else) ‘—it would be moot: they plainly know who I am, what I look like. Not just Gruener, either.’
Sensing a pause, John swallowed and asked her, ‘Why didn’t you keep the jewel in your safe?’
Unsurprisingly, the 24-hour notice before sex policy was pretty much lost cause.
‘It was on my way,’ Sherlock deflected.

Several more brutal shifts of his hips, and Sherlock’s release spilled hard onto John’s skin, and he sagged with a grunt to hold his weight on his arms only inches above John.
A smirk suggested the truthfulness of that statement was entirely suspect.
— it was two decades’ learning that he was incapable of having the things (the people) he wanted in moderation…

mind the cufflinks in the next ten seconds, or I’m sorting them whatever way I bloody well like,’ he retorted hoarsely, shoving his knee higher between Sherlock’s legs, to make his point. Sherlock’s almost imperceptible whine was perfect.
This time John did meet his gaze, a heated smile of dangerous, banked warning across his face. ‘Sherlock, I don’t expect — ’
‘I really think I’ve heard enough.’ With a soft but brittle chink of china, she set her teacup down, then walked briskly to the door, heels clacking on the slate floor, and held it open. ‘If these lies and hateful rumours are the best my father and his feeble-minded friends can do, you can tell them that their desperation is not convincing. Please
(as he’d headed for the shower, pecking Sherlock softly on the lips)
He found his way to his chair, eyes adjusting to a low-level lighting roughly comparable to that of Baker Street in the late evening, before they’d turned on a lamp — the sort of semi-darkness that sometimes (a few winters ago, anyway) had prompted Sherlock to suggest they build a fire. By the time they got home, a week or so from now, the weather might have turned enough to suggest it again.
Sherlock didn’t move except to accept John’s mouth and touch, his stomach rising and falling around John’s fingers. When John waited for a more explicit invitation, Sherlock snorted in annoyance, though his voice was pitched so low John felt it sink into his bones. ‘If there were anything I didn’t want from you, John, you would know.’
, John vowed, to whatever gods were listening.
‘ (he estimated) ‘agents for extraction of AGRA.
Ears ringing with Sherlock’s indignation, John replied, ‘It’s John Horner we should be apologising to. Well, not
‘Hah!’ I barked, for had the accusation been less absurd, it might have been insulting. As it was, I merely rose from my chair by the fire. ‘You are losing your touch, old boy, if you cannot deduce better than that.’
Sherlock frowned but elected not to impede her progress, deciding to turn instead to John, who would (it was tremendously likely) put up an even greater show of resistance to being corralled into costume.
Two things:
sentimental, and the idea of pressing his thumbnail along Sherlock’s palm in slow, delicious furrows while his knee fell sideways to brush Sherlock’s knee and Sherlock’s breathing gave him away while John licked his lips, was –
‘Fuck, Sherlock, oh fuck,’ he chanted mindlessly, his hands coming to rest on the outsides of Sherlock’s arms and gripping tightly. ‘
,’ Sherlock grunted, not looking up.
‘Someone will be in touch with you, soon,’ he conceded, primly, so John knew to expect another of Mycroft’s aides-de-camp sometime around 11:59pm tomorrow night, handing him a file of horrific images he’d want to incinerate immediately.
Pitching himself to his feet with a grunt and the creak of his bones, John began sorting his clothes. ‘Well,’ he added aloud to no one, ‘same time next week?’
‘Got anything to drink?’ he called, ignoring the state of his erection and tottering back to the bedroom.
Sherlock was watching him, still a bit crushed at the top of the landing. Quitting while one was ahead was only a successful strategy if one was planning to call things to a halt. Otherwise it didn’t quite count as ‘quitting’, only waiting before the action. Like the music at the beginning of the opera — an escalating race involving all the instruments bellowing at full volume, with occasional quieter solos. The whole orchestra, just going for it.
He had almost forgotten the reason why people loved this. The closeness and breathless pressure of being sunk so carefully
. He concentrates. The roar of the train, the scuffle, three sets of hands, Mary’s in her deep pockets, the third man unseen until after it was too late to draw data — images of various weapons (a butcher’s knife, Swiss, serrated — 9”, too large for pockets; a flip-blade, sharp-tipped but steel and smooth as velvet, quiet enough to be unheard beneath the tracks) —
‘Ayenat Braithwaite most frequently posed for a selection of high-profile charitable organisations,’ Sherlock told him matter-of-factly. John was far more surprised that Sherlock knew about which companies the Countess had modelled for than at the work itself.
‘Yes,’ (
The bed dipped, the covers lifted, and he opened his eyes to find Sherlock, grimacing, but lying beside him, eyes coming to stop perfectly level with his across the next pillow. On his own side of the bed.
‘Either kiss me or go back to sleep,’ he instructed, vocal cords caked with sleep.

‘It’s not just her. It’s… Did you ever see someone with big, dark, romantic eyes, Mr. Holmes? And at first you think,
Moreover, Sherlock was sickeningly aware, in the dark corners of himself, that returning to Baker Street was itself an indulgence. He brought the crosshairs of the countless shadowy threats to himself to refocus on the people he cared for. The Neville St Clairs of the world were their bread and butter; Moriarty had been, he fervently believed, unique; but the Morans, the nameless thugs and deranged criminals they encountered, would continue to be occupational hazards of the Work.

Sherlock, for the first time in too many minutes, looked him directly in the eyes. He wasn’t smiling, not in any obvious way that creased his silly wonderful face or that raised the hairline he was so fond of having brushed back (by John). But even so, those every-colour eyes bored into his, a combination of such intensity of every emotion there wasn’t an English — or any — word for it, not even close, and John unabashedly drank him in, hoping his own expression could say a tenth of what he saw.

Sunset below the skyline illuminated the flat, long shadows stretched into the room, now paradoxically dark in contrast to the warm, early autumnal light outdoors. It was easy, in the comforting shade of privacy, to believe that John might in fact understand his perplexity.
There wasn’t — there weren’t enough words or syllables or sounds in any language in the universe to wrap around the entirety of what he wanted to say, so releasing one hand from John’s (now also creased) shirtsleeve, Sherlock drew the pen from his breast pocket and turned in John’s arms, making very,
‘They’ve left off a comma in this summary,’ Sherlock announced, coming back into the darkened room.
As per John’s injunction, Sherlock set himself the task of (removing the Mary Morstan problem from his mind, for now, and) devising a plan to entrap Gruener in a legal and inescapable net of his own creation.

‘Mm.’ He stilled, then: ‘It’s not a pleasant thought, John, but I have this terrible feeling, from time to time, that we might all just be human.’
‘We need to find Henry Baker.’
Sherlock dug his spoon straight into the stone-cold container then shoved it into his mouth with an eyeroll. After a second, he managed thickly, ‘Mrs. Paupel’s sister must be pregnant again,’ lips curling as he swallowed his heaping mouthful of food.

I have, for some years—indeed, since my return from the dustier Afghan provinces to the swirling metropole—, been a member of several societies of various interests and purposes, to which I lend what time and energies I can between my engagements with my intimate friend, Sherlock Holmes. Certain local medical societies, including the boards of a few of their attendant journals; my social club, of course, of which I had been a member since joining Her Majesty’s army; another for veterans of that same service, which largely devolved into committees for sport on the rugby pitch, and for the art of drinking truly unconscionable amounts of beer and brandy; a writer’s guild; and so on. Holmes, naturally, is more inclined to the finer arts, music being his preferred medium and subject. (Few of his activities require such tremendous contributions in the forms spirits or gambling debts as any one of mine.)
‘Yes.’ Sherlock returned John’s gaze for a moment, hoping John understood – he could not, now he had been presented with the single unifying piece to make sense of the puzzle, ignore it, any more than John could ignore Mrs. Hudson’s (admittedly slightly worrying) cough. The sooner he traced the stone back to through the last eventful few days, the sooner he would understand, and the sooner he could get
‘That’s consistent, anyway,’ muttered Sherlock sardonically.
‘Sherlock?’ he called, because none of this boded well.

, he mused.
! Right now.
‘And, did Mrs. – sorry, Lady Morcar keep anything else in the safe? Anything else that was stolen, or not?’ John asked, partly to make sure the PA didn’t throw them out before Sherlock had looked round the place properly.
But her visit had interrupted the half-hour bubble of thick tranquillity that had followed Mycroft’s departure. Not that his visit itself had been anything but disturbing, but it had provided John with possibly his favourite rarity of life at Baker Street:
‘Hey,’ John whispered, grabbing his face with both hands and replacing the remembered midnight (hideous stucco salmon) hotel room with his real dark wide eyes. ‘We only just got the place to ourselves.’ He scanned Sherlock’s face. ‘I’ve got ideas, none of which I actually fancy having to do on my own. So just… focus.’
‘No?’ she asked, a playful lilt in her voice. ‘I dunno: it looks all right to me. A bit… messy, but.’ She smiled.
I took some liberties, both with parrot anatomy (which I only - ahem - stretched) and with sugar content. Forgive me.
‘That she is
‘If you don’t need the loo, though, you really ought to try and rest for a bit,’ he told Sherlock. ‘They’ll be around when the next shift comes on and they’ll be wanting to run through the whole board.’
Through the ear-splitting din, with a thick, painful scrape of skin, hair, and gummy adhesive, Sherlock ruthlessly peeled away the towel and – John, unthinking, stepped forward to stop him, but he was too late, too shocked – Boone’s face with it.
.) ‘How did you know the Carbuncle was so poorly secured?’
‘Of course she is.’
, behind it all, Sherlock’s frantic, inarticulable message:
Bad dreams of Mary, of drinking himself stupid in that awful bedsit, of Chinese pottery and girls kept in badly-lit backrooms being harmed in ways his psyche refused, self-protectively, to represent fully, bit at the edges of his sleep all night, chasing him, until he woke with a start Wednesday morning in a bed smelling of both of them, alone.
(How, after several confrontational and highly emotional conversations, could he believe Sherlock at all ambivalent? Could he be so blind? Sherlock thought his feelings about John were almost certainly visible — dangerously so — to strangers on the pavement, to Mycroft and Sir James, to the bloody delicious-smelling long-dead cow cooling in a soup on the tabletop.)
‘Sherlock?’ he called, heading up the stairs, not especially expecting an answer. The flat remained hushed.

Damoclean sword, or to the first time they’d met in a warehouse south of the river. John’s hands weren’t tremoring now either.
For the better part of the next hour, John attempted to teach their parrot every tasteless proverb under the antique and modern sun. Sherlock was thoroughly glad that they were committed to giving Ovid away, now that John had corrupted his mind; he would never have allowed their parrot to learn such absurdities.
With a smirk, Peterson shrugged, ‘Er, right, sure. Anyway the
Standing before him now, Gruener opened a heavy brass (ornate, gold-gilded, well-polished) box and withdrew — because of course Sherlock’s reputation preceded him — a cigarette. He then removed a book of matches and antique silver humidor from the inner pocket of his close-fitting
“Can we? Please.”
“Ya know, it’s such a turn on when you do that wicked smile.” John smiled, running his hand down Sherlock’s chest and down to his crotch.
“Come on. Get up, lazy bones.” John chuckles, poking Sherlock's ribs playfully.
“What did the Doctor get you this time, Harriet?” Sherlock asked with a curious look at his daughter.
She ran into the living room and to Harriet's surprise, her father was sat there waiting for her.
He stripped the detective of his jeans and boxers but before he could go any further, Sherlock dragged him up by his jumper and kissed him passionately. Then he roughly pulled off the jumper and t-shirt in one, throwing them across the room.
"Yes."
It's simple and straight to the point, well, simple enough with Mycroft's specialist coding.

He's spent two years wishing he could fix the broken heart of his little brother and bring John back home. Little does Sherlock know but Mycroft has sent in practically every (un)known operative to find John and his troop; unofficially of course.
“Maybe it will entice your father to eat too.” John smirked, looking over at his partner.
John slowly climbs back onto the bed and gently pushes Sherlock down, settling himself between his boyfriend's long legs and kissing him slowly.
“I'd love to be a vampire.” Maggie says after a few minutes silence.
"Hello you, where's father?” John asked his daughter with a smile.
“Why … Why would I do that?”
We started solving crimes together and I'd blog about them while we slowly became friends and ran around the city like mad men; it was good, fun even.
He sorts the mess of curls into some sort of tidiness before covering Sherlock's eyes and spraying hairspray all over the younger man's head.
John stops just at the door and admires his boyfriend hard at work; who's clearly already forgotten about Kate.
Sherlock moans a little as John massages his hair gently in soothing circles. He'd always imagined this; seeing John naked and dripping with water. He moans again at the mental image and has to rest his hands on the shower wall.
"Does she know?"
“Piss off.”
Sherlock blushed before relaxing into John's touch as his hand moved to his cheek.
Mycroft steps around his assistant and reads the email from the account that only he and Anthea have access to.
“Next time, make sure I'm awake enough to enjoy it.” John chuckles, kissing Sherlock again.

“I don't know, baby, I really don't. I guess I'll just have to make sure I stay alive … for you.”
“You need to ring an ambulance, dear. He's bleeding out too much, if you don't call soon, he'll die, Sherlock.”
John smiled softly at his partner and ran his fingers through his damp hair, pulling him in for a kiss.
"Trust me, Harry. You don't need this right now."
"Oh, I'm sorry."
"Doesn't matter, Sherlock.”
“Challenge accepted.” John grinned, heading for the bedroom, slowly stripping off his jumper as he went.
“God, Sher. You been getting … lessons on how to do this? Or are you just a

“John, I'll be right back.” Sherlock calls, heading down the stairs.

“What do people usually say?”
So? I know, very long chapter but I got confident with sexual stuff so ;) does anybody not  like it? xxxx
“So, are you going to?”
"So, I actually said that you'd be good in the sack?"
But that didn't matter now because I always knew Sherlock would tell me in his own time, I just hoped it wouldn't be something he told me on my death bed.
impressive.” Sherlock smiled, stripping off his shirt and jeans before practically jumping on John.
Good John, wouldn't want to raise suspicion when the wound heals by the time we get there.
“Come on.” John says gently, pulling himself onto the bed and tugging Sherlock with him.
“What? Seriously? But Mycroft could face a death sentence for treason.” John breathes, immensely worried for his friend.
“Ah, here she is. The birthday girl.” John smiled brightly, walking over and hugging his daughter.

Sherlock sighed and walked into the living room, folding his arms across his chest.
‘There are important matters which —’
‘I don’t believe so, no. Not unless working with Mycroft has proved as tedious and insufferable an experience as I imagine it to be, in which case I would merely point out that it’s entirely out of my hands that we share many of the same genes.’
Once again, Sherlock flagged a taxi, directed them homeward, and began sending a whirl of texts. It wasn’t that John was embarrassed at trying to have this talk in a cab – god knew they had had far more gruesome conversations in broad daylight and in occasionally front of John’s girlfriends. It was more that the furious pace of his texting threw a brick wall between Sherlock and himself, only adding to the full two feet of space on the cab bench.
With deadly seriousness, he kept his eyes on Sherlock’s, knowing at least some of his no doubt soppy sentimentality was visible in his expression. Sherlock gazed back, frown unmoved but eyes shifting back and forth between each of John’s, up-close.

He fled.
‘You say “us”, Sir James,’ John wondered aloud, drawing full attention to himself for the first time in several minutes. ‘“Our crisis”? Who do you mean?’

the records of the previous encounters. How, if the documents were entirely encrypted or, if he were clever, simply filed in his mind?’
He spent the rest of the day (standing) ordering every relevant exhibition book, catalogue raisonné, monograph, scholarly journal, art studio starter’s guide, and ‘crackpot’ self-published collector’s memoir he could find across the internet — paid for, of course, by the handsome advance they’d taken off Damery’s annoyingly concealed downpayment.
, John tried to say.
. Even four years ago, after the pool, Sherlock could have appreciated the practical importance of trusting one’s closest allies with information. (Besides, a disguise – and a clever, effective disguise, at that – was hardly something to become bashful about.) But now, after just under 800 days of simmering, acidic paranoia corroding him, of a thing nurtured by his self-hatred and by the gnawing fear that he would miss a vital clue and cost John his life (or Mrs Hudson’s, or Lestrade’s), but most of all by the deeper, ineradicable terror that eventually John would not want him close, he considered Neville St Clair a fool of the most selfish, sickening kind.
Sherlock nodded, visibly clenching his hands, and John lined himself and — and — John filled him up, sedately but insistently, nudging forward, body arched over and around Sherlock’s body as he penetrated him, not all the way yet, with breaths gone tripwire-taut.
‘Hardly pertinent tonight: we want to be seen and forgotten. And in any event, Captain, isn’t that more your area? “All the nice girls love a soldier”?’

She gave a sort of gentle nod, shrugging. ’I’m not especially squeamish. Well. I don’t especially like cockroaches, but that’s, that’s it, I think. Hard to work in a morgue if you’re iffy around body parts or… you know, death.’
And yet John had marched unevenly into a lab in Bart’s Hospital and Sherlock had, within seconds, begun devising the plan to rid of him that
Instead of speaking, however, John carefully, deliberately reached out a hand and waited. Such an action called for only a single ‘appropriate’ response, so Sherlock stepped forward just one step, placing the toe of his left shoe just where it met the leg of John’s chair. Smiling, John weaved (the angle was awkward, Sherlock’s hand almost perpendicular to John’s) their fingers together softly. Distantly Sherlock wondered what John’s hands would feel like in ten years — in fifty — whether he could begin now, by scheduling decennary refurbishments to the chair, as a present (as a promise of something so dangerous as a
‘She’s in a polygamous queer open marriage, so I think she’s fine, in the end.’
Not for another fifteen minutes did he receive a reply, in which time he had ample opportunity to frown, berate himself for flirting so cavalierly with a man who quite obviously didn’t do anything sexual without nine kinds of forewarning. At long last, as he wheeled round in his chair to have a too-little-too-late STI chat with a wide-eyed uni student, his phone lit up in the peeking-open drawer of his desk.
“My brother has certain… Needs.” Mycroft answered.  “He meets those that might satisfy his needs and takes them in.  Of course they ultimately cannot handle him and they leave.  It’s been six days and you have not yet packed up.  I wonder why.  What do you hope to get out of him?”
“You are with me.”
“People care about you, Sherlock.” Molly pleaded.
I shook my head.  “That doesn’t work.  We both have needs.  I’m willing to give you anything you want.”
“You only take women to bed with you.”   Sherlock replied, thinking of John’s past three bed partners.
“You call out to the gods a lot during sex… Are you aware of that?”  Sherlock mused as he reached down to take John’s ass in his hands, pulling the lord deeper.  “Take me.”
“Punctual as usual, Lestrade.” The peacock answered in a rich baritone.
Sherlock bit his lips for a moment.  “So it’s not just my body you want?”
Sherlock’s words were a stab at John’s heart and he struggled against his bonds, not wanting to hear anymore.
John listened with growing horror to Sherlock’s words.  “Get out.”
“Why should I mind that you practice safe sex?” John responded.
“Silence.”  John sighed and left Lestrade’s cell.  Further into the dungeon he came to Molly’s cell.  “I know who Sherlock is.  Why was I lied to?”
“Too much information?”
Two fingers became three fingers, spreading and stretching John’s body.  Sherlock was being slow… Too slow.  Usually his fingers were quick and eager.
“I told you… You can fuck me.” John answered, pushing a third finger in.
“Really, Lord John… There must be a feast!  With music and wine and dance!”  Sherlock turned towards the doors to the great feast hall, his court scrambling to get out of the way as he passed through them and to the doors.  “Tonight we feast and make merry and send you off to your marriage bed properly!”  Sherlock intoned with a sort of manic glee.
“Then the breeding program would end.”  Sherlock gave John as small smile.  “It seems warg are only artificially adapted to polygamy.”
“Why, Sherlock?  This isn’t the first time you’ve tried to take your own life.”
“Quietly… Take yourself in hand and imagine it is me.  Yes.  Do you want me to lick you, John?  Yes.”
“I don’t mean right now… But later.”
“What?”  Sherlock licked his lips, nervous at the intensity of the gaze.  “Are you… hungry?”
Sherlock was once again in 1895.  But something had changed.  Watson lay slumbering peacefully at his side.  “Goodnight.”  With a soft kiss to the other man’s temple he settled in bed.  This time he had hope that there would be intimacy between them.
Rosie patted my face to get my attention.
“What do you want?” Sherlock responded, suddenly unsure about the faun’s intentions.  Did he mean to cause some sort of harm?
John blinked at me, his mouth open.  He looked adorable in his jumper and trousers.  I wanted to peel them off of him.  I satisfied myself by kissing him instead.  “Sherlock…”
“Don’t you dare!”  Sherlock grunted with some effort.
“In feral packs they pair off… always breeding with the same mate.  A pack is made up of an alpha male and female… their offspring… and those offspring’s mates and cubs.  When the pack gets too big they may break apart or slow their breeding.  Warg don’t have that option.  We are encouraged to create as many offspring as we can as quickly as we can… more warg for the program… a near inexhaustible supply of soldiers.”
“After you shag me properly.” John answered.
“She’s not hurt…”
“I want…”
“I won’t call you to court ever again.  Serve me by keeping your lands…”
“But she’s the daughter of my captain, Morstan.”  John growled in frustration.
Unfortunately... Halfway through my computer decided it would shut off and not turn on again.  I took it to a repair place and they told me my hard drive was corrupted so the computer couldn't boot up.  I took it to a data recover place because my whole life was on that computer and I did not have anything backed up.  $1,000 later I recovered my doc files and the first half of my Nanowrimo novel.  Very expensive life lesson?  Back up your hard drive regularly.  To be fair... $200 of that was for a 1 TB external hard drive to put my rescued files on.  I could have told them that my laptop was only 2 years old and only had a few GB of data... But they went with the big drive.
?” John asks, his voice hitching to a moan as Sherlock swirls his tongue just the right way.
"Home time." The Doctor announced, running back to the controls.
“Mm, John.” Sherlock replies, breaking the kiss, “I thought we were leaving.”
"Hello. What's your name?".
“Ah, so you boys are finally awake now. I’ll make some tea and get some biscuits.” Mrs Hudson smiled as she entered the flat.
mate, not yours.”
"It's the TARDIS, Time And Relative Dimension In Space."
"I need blood." He repeats, lifting his head so that Maggie can see his face better.
Sherlock sighed and ran his hand through John's short blonde hair; for once thinking about what to say.
Harriet woke early and ran down the stairs, too excited to wait for her dads to get up because today was her thirteenth birthday.
“Then ask him.”
Did you like my little bit at the end. I had to add in my special guest just to bring the story back full circle :p xxxx
"Oh."
John deftly dodges the second swing but isn't prepared for a sharp stab to his chest; the husband of the dead wife coming into view.
“In other words, he wants you in his bed but let's you out for a run once in a while.”
“Um, these, do you think they'll be okay?” Sherlock asks softly, mentally shaking himself as he blushes.
Without a second thought, Maggie runs for her life and doesn't look back, too afraid that the vampire will make good on his word.
Mycroft pulls up to his home and Sherlock immediately jumps out, running through the door and into the living room.
"Are you going to take Father?"

As the door explodes, Doctor John Watson and his troop jump in fear, those kinds of explosions never mean anything good is about to happen.
The older vampire bites hard into the flesh and Sherlock releases John's neck to scream his mate's name to the heavens, just as John wanted; as he orgasms all over John.

"Oh, that's nice.”
Minutes later and John is coming with tears in his eyes, so privileged that he has this beautiful and amazing boy in his life.
daughter instead of asking you!” Sherlock snarls, stalking closer to John.
“Good.” Sherlock sighs happily, waiting for John to continue..
“Morning, John.” Sherlock smiled brightly, looking as alive as ever even at 6.30am.
“Very.” Sherlock moans and if he hadn't just orgasmed then he's sure he would now.
“Come on then, dear.” Mrs Hudson smiled, handing Harriet her school bag and lunch.
“Sir. You need to see this.” She gasps, leaning on the door frame for support as she continues, “And bring Greg and Sherlock with you.”
“No evil intentions?”
.” The stranger whispers suggestively into Greg's ear before softly kissing his neck.
“You don't … wanna know.” John stutters, trying to breathe as Sherlock continues to run a delicate finger up and down his cock.
Obviously it's pointless, I'm much stronger than any human; especially this four foot two inches bag of bones.
Sherlock moans softly at the intimacy and rests his hand on top of John's, linking their fingers.
Sherlock practically slams John against their dorm-room door as they enter and kisses him passionately, digging his nails into his boyfriend's hips.
“I told you, he isn't
“Fine.”
“Then come closer and make sure he doesn't.”
“Come on. Your hair will be a nightmare to brush if we don't wash it soon.” John smiles, climbing over his boyfriend and pulling him up off the bed.

When they pull up into the driveway, Sherlock point blank refuses to get out of the car, instead decides to sulk until Greg has no choice but to drag him out and wrestle him into Mycroft's house.
happy, aren't we?” Greg asks carefully, afraid of the answer.

"Is that good?" John asked shyly.
He stopped, mid-chase and greeted me.
John grinned in response, picking up the newspaper again.
"Yes, oh, over here. You're about to knock on the door."
"How was her story?"
“Shower, now!” John ordered, standing up and rearranging himself.
The pair continue to bicker like children while Greg and John just laugh at their partners.
“I thought you were friends with Emma and Jade?” John interrupted, confusion in his tone.
“Maybe some other time. Right now, we should sleep. We have a long day of learning tomorrow.”
“Good. Now, onto something sexy. I'll be careful, I promise. Tell me if I go too far, okay.”
“Yeah, well. He's not much for labels either.”
“I'm right here, John. Remember that.” Sherlock called from the doorway of the kitchen.
“I'm the first, love. The first one he turned, his first mate, his first
“Okay.” Sherlock replies, opening his legs a little wider.
“I'll have to stretch you out first, so you'll have to be patient, okay.” John says gently, reaching over to grab some lube from their bedside table.
“I love you too, Sher.”
“Oh, okay.” Sherlock smiles awkwardly, eyes roaming over John's body before meeting his eyes.
"That's amazing. I love it, Doctor. Best present yet."
John moaned loudly in response and bucked his hips up.
“John, I think … John, I’m gonna …”
John pours the lube onto his fingers and presses them inside Sherlock.
Sherlock clenches around John and the older teen sees stars, gasping Sherlock's name as he comes.
“Dad, I'm fifteen now. Come on.” I whine at Dad, and I know, it's not really helping my case.
“Should we get a shower?” Sherlock asks suddenly, remembering about the gel in his hair.
“I look like a
“Jawn, who talkin' to?” A voice whispers sleepily, rolling over into John.
“I swore to myself I'd never let it get that bad again. Mycroft knew the state I was in and arrived in time to stop me. I made him give her his number, just in case.”
He looked towards the bed and was greeted with a very near naked John Watson.
Two months into their relationship John gets attacked while working a case
The younger Holmes ignores him in favour of bringing his knees up to his chest and staring into the fire, feeling as it warms him to his bones.
“Sherlock, we're teenagers and it's part of the rock look. Besides, we need to take
“Well then, where were we?” John smirks, crawling back over to his friend.
He was incredibly surprised when his partner placed the final plate of spaghetti bolognaise on the table and the kitchen was still in a reasonable state.
"It's fine, Sherlock. I love Harriet and I love you. Besides, she looks more like you everyday."
But he'd commit many more acts of treason if it meant that his brother would just

John smiles and picks up one of Sherlock's hands, bringing it towards chest and holding it there.
“There are …
“What the bloody hell are you playing at?” Mycroft growls as soon as Sherlock slumps into a chair.
"Sherlock." John replied, grabbing Sherlock's arm.
“Now that

Mycroft says desperately down the phone.
“I travel through space and
“Get off me, you prick. I told you, I'm leaving.”
But for some reason, I still decided to meet up with him the next day to look at a flat and move in that same day.
Sherlock nods in reply, focusing on relaxing for John.

“Come on, my love. Tell me.”
“I can’t.”
The next night John and Sherlock are working a case; nothing too complicated really, just a husband who's wife had an 'accident' conveniently

Then, without looking back, Sherlock walked out.

‘We’re a couple. Sherlock and me. We’re… together. So lay off, alright.’
John’s body was thrumming, singing like the
After a few moments, John disappeared into the bedroom briefly, before returning. Then the sound of the telly blared at top volume — ‘Sorry, sorry, Christ, what —’ — then quickly decreased in volume to a subtle, after-hours ripple of chat and background music, then sport, then the sharper bass tones consistent with higher-quality sound equipment and less asinine viewer expectations: a film.
‘What?’ John asked, a little breathless.
Sherlock had blurted out in the hospital, and then he’d looked at John as though he was furious, desperately clinging to him, with a face morphing into thunder when John had said it back.
‘Dada,’ she whimpers, and John is astounded—taken aback—to have his daughter brought home by the only other person who loves her as much as he does, in tears.
Why his sister insisted on meeting him at some posh French place, where the head waiter glared the smattering of rain on his favourite, admittedly re-seamed coat (which was perfectly fine, thanks very much) and his years-old shoes like they were better suited to a drowned mutt, he didn’t actually care to know. Instead, with as much grace as he could muster on what would probably be another instalment in the series of typically difficult meals with his sibling, he set his back straight and made for the table.

‘For god’s sake, John, I’m not going to do cartwheels through the man’s window!’
Anything John might have said is rendered unnecessary by the look he receives: a profound undone glance, surrender behind the dark tunnels of Sherlock's eyes in the midnight, flecked not with fear but rather with assertion.

‘Mary?’ Molly muttered, the first words she’d managed to whisper in minutes.
After a moment, on a whim he couldn’t quite account for, Sherlock offered, ‘It was beautiful.’ (Ravel’s string quartet; molecular Borromean rings of perfect crystal.)
Under the covers in a vest and shorts, lights out, finally,

Eventually John yawned, to which Sherlock audibly rolled his eyes.
who’d spilled his lunch over several strangers was now second-in-line to the till with a fresh cup. ‘Ah. Well.’ Irritated, John didn’t think it worth facing off in public with the tosser to get him to pay for him and the other people who had to scatter from the spill: an oily, sneering city boy, the kind that never gave up their seats on the tube for pregnant women or the elderly, ignoring them while texting or worse, chatting loudly to his mates. It wasn’t fine, obviously, but John was either too recently well-shagged or too tired to bother with confronting him. So he kept the napkins in a (momentarily balled) hand and instead managed to sop up the bits over his shoes. ‘You go on, then,’ he said to the woman. ‘Got to…’ He flapped a bit, and she, the ginger, laughed. He chanced a sideways glance at her, finishing up with his cleaning. Quite attractive, it turned out.
“Goodnight.”  John smiled and him and went upstairs to his own room, leaving Sherlock alone and painfully erect.
“I… Don’t understand.”
“There you go.  Lubrication.”
“John… Please…” His voice broke.  “Please don’t make me beg.”
“I’ll teach you, Pup.”  Lightly his hand covered the organ he had just sucked.  It was damp and softening in his palm.
“My motivations?”
Sherlock let out a small sob.  It was in that moment that John realized that Sherlock was crying.  The detective’s arms trembled and his hands couldn’t seem to find a comfortable position on his back.
“I am a man of many talents.”  Sherlock answered, entering the hall to cue everyone that they should do the same.  There was a chaos of people as they came in and found their names at various tables around the room.  At the head table sat John, Mary and Sherlock.  Sherlock took a place to the side with John beside him and Mary on the other side.  “Are you pleased?”
John sighed.  Crossing to the chair he pushed the other former bed slave aside.  “Move.”
“I’m a mermaid… A siren.  That is why you are rubbing your shoulder against mine.”  Mary stated.
John complied, rolling on top and pushing himself back inside Sherlock’s tight heat.  With a roll of his hips he established a rhythm.
“You miss them.”
“Who’s your friend?”
And then Sherlock made a frustrated noise in his throat and changed the channel.  The channel they landed on was completely random.  Sometimes Sherlock became bored with telly and expressed that boredom by changing the channel.  It just so happened that the channel they landed on depicted two men kissing.
I slipped out of my chair and crossed the short distance between us.  I could do this for him.  I could give him comfort and release.  I leaned in, obedient to his silent plea and wrapped my hand around his growing erection.  With my hand in place I licked the tip, finding it to be a length I could easily manage.
The villagers spoke of a monster, a beast.  Their reports came with a rising panic that demanded action.  Since the village was so near the army base with rumors that the beast was from the base, soldiers were called in to sweep through the woods and pacify the fears of the villagers.  The plan was to conduct a search, a line of soldiers searching the woods.  When they got to the far side they would make camp.  The next morning they were to sweep back again in case something got through the line.  No consideration was made for the terrain.  That is how Watson had been forced to scale a steep path without finding an easier way up the ridge.  If he deviated from his trajectory then something might slip through.  Those in line beside him would have to adjust to fill in for him and he felt bad for them.  It was rotten luck to be given the steepest portion of the ridge.
“You are the favored of the king.  I shower you and your wife with gifts to publicly express my affection for you.”
Sherlock realized that his robe was open and he stood to close it, stepping up beside John’s defensive position.  “What do you want, Mycroft?”
Sherlock leaned down and kissed John’s lips.  “I look forward to many more mornings awakening beside you.”
“You… You wanted…”
Meanwhile back in 221B Sherlock watched the disc he had been given.  There were several video files burned onto the disc and he watched them all.  Some showed the pack in wolf form hunting together as a team with a female doctor giving commentary and pointing out various pack members.  Another video showed John holding a newborn cub… cub was the correct word for the child wasn’t human.  It looked like a wolf cub and it was much smaller than a human child.  “Born gestation week eight, day two… This is Ian Sawyer-Watson with his sire, John Watson.”  John glanced at the camera and smiled, holding the cub closer and whispering soft words into the little wolf ears.  Yet another video showed Bill cuddling John, both dressed in loose slacks and plain shirts.  Both were barefooted and looked happy to be together.  In the background other members of the pack were curled up together in pairs.  The same woman who spoke in previous videos informed the viewer that due to only 40% participation in the breeding program that Orange Beta Pack would be sent to another project in a combat unit.  It seemed Sherlock was seeing the pack shortly before it had been sent to war… their leaving the breeding program ensuring their death.
“What is this, Sherlock?  Is this your attempt at asking me on a date?” John asked.
“I like hearing the noises he makes.” Sherlock answered as he tossed the gag aside.  His eyes focused on John’s, giving him a concerned look.
Sherlock nodded in agreement, only because he did not want to alert Watson that he was not the Holmes he thought he was.  “Very well.”
Sherlock broke the kiss and cried out, pressing his forehead to John’s shoulder.  “John…”
“Broken?” I suggested.
John got up from the rock and stepped close to Sherlock.  “You can’t treat other people like that.”
John rolled his eyes and hummed, causing my penis to vibrate.  John continued to hum as he bobbed on me.
John came to the stop in the middle of a prairie.  “What’s wrong?”
John moaned and opened his legs wider, allowing Sherlock room to probe him.  “Your test results came back?”
John startled and shook his head.  When had he left the clearing with the table?  Surely not three days ago… It had only been a few minutes or a few hours.  “I don’t remember three days.”
And it was at that moment that John realized he was holding back, on some level afraid of what sort of damage he would do to the faun.  “I’ll hurt you.”
“Could you?”  Sherlock queried as he leaned on the rock, still in the water.
“What?” John asked quietly.
“I have needs.”  Sherlock managed, adjusting his position on the bed.
“Good.”  John replied, reaching around to take Sherlock’s cock in hand.
“Half wild… Half intellectual.  Great philosophers and yet they might steal all the virgins at a wedding… Or so I’ve been told.”  Sherlock patted John’s shoulder which was also his human hip.  “Can you take off the Glamour?”
“I told you before… I’m just not very tactile!” His voice gave a sharp inflection at the end of the phrase when a pair of lips wrapped around his cock.  Helplessly his hand rested on John’s head.  “John… please… I’m not even hard right now.”
“Because I want you.”  John answered.  An oily hand slathered Sherlock’s cock and John straddled and sat, easily taking Sherlock into his body.  “It’s been a while since I’ve done this.  But you feel so good.”  Rocking his hips, he gave an internal squeeze.
Rosie raised an eyebrow.  “Three daddies?”
“You like that?” The faun asked, breathing warm air against Sherlock’s neck.
The former soldier dropped a spring roll onto Sherlock’s plate and swallowed what was in his mouth.  “I bed whomever I want.  I am free to choose.  That’s the point.  I spent most of my life with a master telling me who to sleep with.  Now I can choose.  Woman… Man… Both at the same time…”
John’s hands worked their way down Sherlock’s back, shifting further down with each command of “lower” until he got to the man’s waist.
“So do you, love.”
“Sit!”  Sherlock barked.
“I’m… not fully human.”
“Why?”
“Why?” Sherlock asked.
John’s stomach flipped and for a moment he wasn’t sure if it was because of the jealousy of knowing Sherlock loved someone else or that Sherlock made no mention of his presence.
“I think it is bloody brilliant!” Greg answered.  “And you said I am going to turn into something else?”
John obeyed.  “Why?”
Sherlock closed his eyes and felt his body fall over the edge.  For a brief, breathless moment he was highly aware of Watson’s hand squeezing him while his other hand caught Sherlock’s semen in the handkerchief.
“You’re flattering me.”
John tried to meet Sherlock’s thrusts, knowing his mate was about to finish very soon.  Frankly he was pleasantly surprised that Sherlock had lasted as long as he had.
“What has he done?”
“You’re not my mother.  My mother died ages ago.  She was mortal like I was… Like what you used to be.  You abducted me and brought me here because you can’t have children.”
“Still…”
John shook his head.
Quickly I pulled on my dressing gown and entered the living room to see Molly sitting on the couch, reading.  Molly looked up at me and gave me a soft smile.  I knew from her look that she pitied me.  My Alpha was gone.  “Are you alright?”
“The bite marks are…” Sherlock began with his attention on the throat of the victim.
“Well… If you had you would know that the stallion looks like this.”
It was easy to slide in… Too easy.  As if Sherlock’s body was greedily sucking him in.  John whispered, “fuck” and desperately tried to keep from orgasming too quickly.  Sherlock’s body was made for it.  “Is it any good?”
“I don’t want to draw attention to myself.”  John yawned again and shook his head.  “Sorry… I should… go find someplace to nap.”
We went through my sister’s idea of games.  They involved death and killing.
John took a deep breath to steady the rising anger in his body.  For a time he didn’t speak.  But when he did it was very soft and very dangerous.  “Sherlock Holmes… You have to do better than that.”  And with that he walked away, back to their sleeping area.
“I can’t marry Mary now.”
“So you’ll be my real daddy?” Rosie stared up at him in awe.
“Quick or slow?” John asked.
Several more months passed.  Farmers who had been soldiers had long ago returned to their fields to plant.  His own army broke up to return home, occupying both his old lands and his new.
“I’m clean.” Sherlock answered.
John gave a soft sigh and climbed onto the bed.  His fingers lightly touched where my slick came from.  “Are you sure?”
The next day was another case which was quickly solved.  Sherlock spent most of the day fiddling with his counterpart’s ancient collection of laboratory equipment, trying to make it work.  None of it was as refined as his own collection in the 21st century.
“Yes… keep doing that… and whatever else your body demands.  I’ll let you take it as far as you like.”
Mary glanced at the group of revelers still resting by her stream.  “It takes a little while after you eat and drink with us for the mortal to fade.  Soon you will find out what you will be.”
“Because… Because I love you, you git.”
“Who did you have in mind, my lord?”
John whimpered and pressed his face against Sherlock’s thigh, rolling over to wedge his nose into the human’s hip.  “You smell like me.  You haven’t cleaned yourself.”
“Daddy said ‘bollucks.’” Rosie announced.
John stood and looked between Sherlock and Lestrade.  “Who did this?”
“Fuck…” John murmured close to my ear.
I finally looked him in the eyes and found him looking back at me.  “I went to Sherrinford today.”
Sherlock wrapped his lips around John’s glans and softly suckled and laved the urethra with his tongue.
Sherlock nodded and reached out to take a grape from one of the bowls.  Biting into it, he passed the half fruit to John’s lips.
Eventually the child dozed, leaning on John and holding Sherlock’s hand.
“You really don’t need to.”
John took a deep breath.  “The OD on the plane… The near OD last week… Let’s not forget that Mary took the bullet intended for you.  And now this?  You’re trying to die.”
“No, Holmes.  I am sorry.”  Watson sat on the edge of the bed.  “If it will help you, you may touch me.”
Sherlock turned to regard John, for the first time noticing that his companion was flaccid.  Several emotions passed through the detective at once.  There was surprise at John’s limp state.  That was followed by disappointment and sadness.  It never occurred to him that John wouldn’t want him.  But there was the evidence, plain as day.  John didn’t want this.  John didn’t want him.  And suddenly he was ashamed of his arousal… Ashamed at his casual nudity.  John didn’t want him.  No one wanted him.
John couldn’t see.  His eyes were covered and there was something in his mouth.  All he could do was hear.  His hands were tied behind his back and he was lying on his side on a cold floor.
“Yes, mate… way too much information.”
“He is no longer a child.  You will meet him.  At the end of the season you will be called to court.”
“Anal lubrication…”  John replied with a grin, wrapping his legs around Sherlock’s body and holding him close.  “You feel… so good.”
“I’ve had sex without love.” Sherlock commented.  “With admiration.”
John pulled Sherlock into the bedroom and sat him on the bed before tugging at his own clothing.  They made a messy pile on the floor.  Wearing only his pants he crawled onto the bed as Sherlock joined him.  They lay side by side, the blankets kicked down to the end of the bed.
John came towards me and leaned against my chair.  As he pressed his lips against mine I saw in his eyes something dangerous.  A shiver passed up my spine.
There was a rush for the door, slowed by the police that questioned everyone in their knowledge of the drug bust.  John’s party knew nothing so they were dismissed.  It was only when John sat in the cab on the way home that he looked at the paper in his hand.  It was a phone number and a name.  “Sherlock.”
“Sherlock…”
John concentrated and immediately felt himself shift from bipedal to quadruped.  “Would you like to come with me?  Could I carry you?”
“I’m an alpha.”  John whispered, moving in closer, eyeing Sherlock’s throat.  “I lost my mates.  You’ve never mated…”
Sherlock never wanted to be king.  On some level he knew that he would one day be forced to sit on his father’s throne.  The idea of groveling of servants filled him with dread.  What he wanted more than anything else in the world was to be free.  It was a daydream he often had while he was sitting with his tutors, learning about affairs of state.  Mycroft was free, for he was a bastard.  There was never any expectation on him to rule or take a wife and sire heirs.  When Sherlock was still very young he realized he didn’t particularly care for females.  It was the males that interested him.
“Then how are we supposed to get back?”  John demanded.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock shook his head, confused.  “I don’t understand.”
“I know what you’re going to say.” I frowned.
Something clattered to the ground, hitting John’s leg.
John sat in the cab, idly playing with his wedding band.  Pulling it to his knuckle, he flexed his finger, feeling it bite into the top of his knuckle before pushing it back where it belonged.  The skin underneath was permanently indented.
“Trust me.  It’s true.” I answered.  “An Omega knows when they are Undesirable.”
“I can’t stop thinking about what sort of father I will be…” John answered, rolling his head back and desperately trying to follow Sherlock’s orders.
Lord John concentrated on the movement of his quill on parchment.  Every few moments he dipped his quill into the ink and continued his scrawl.  His eyes kept to the paper without looking back over his shoulder at the figure on the bed.
“As much as you want, anytime that you want… As long as I’m not busy.”
“This isn’t our home.  We’re guests here… Argh!”  The cry escaped him because Mary trod on his foot.  “Well… It’s true.”
Lestrade wrote the ID down.  “That’s… amazing.  You did that all by smell?”
Sherlock kept eye contact, his eyes focusing on John, finding comfort in the other man’s presence.  With a nod he leaned back, still watching as the other man swallowed his penis.  John felt good… felt right… his mouth was warm and moist.  Instantly he was harder than he had ever been and he shifted so John could have more room to work.  The former bed slave had talent.  It was regretful that Sherlock had yet to fully experience the other man’s gifts… but he would take what he could get.  If John wanted he would roll over and allow the former bed slave full access to his body.  It didn’t matter that he had never taken anyone to bed.  All John had to do was ask…  Sherlock’s eyes focused on John’s lips and the way his penis was consumed by them.  It made something in his groin stir.  In that moment he wanted to be anything but a virgin.  In that moment he would gladly be a bed slave if he could have John claim him.  “John…”
“I want you to bend him over and take him.”  The voice had a mechanical quality to it.  It came from a speaker on the wall above a large mirror.  It sounded like Kylo Ren from that movie John had forced him to watch.  What was it?  Star Trek?  Star Wars?  Star Search?  Dancing With the Stars?  Something American.  Sherlock didn’t like it.
“No… instead you take a wolf.”
“Your robe is scratchy.”  John commented.
“Feasts?”
“You said that.”  Sherlock whispered back.  Against his thigh he could feel John’s erection.  Just knowing John was there made him feel giddy and excited.  His hands ached to reach under the jacket and touch warm skin, but he refrained.  The hug was to keep naked John warm, not to give in to base desires.
Sherlock smiled.
The teasing never stopped.  In bed they didn’t go any further than mutual fellatio.  On cases and off, they made sexual comments to one another whether it was appropriate or not.
I decided not to tell John about the pregnancy.  Too much happened too quickly for us to really talk about it.  First he was shot with a tranquilizer by my sister posing as his therapist… I found out I had a sister whom I had forgotten.  John recovered but then a grenade was set off in my flat.  Mycroft took us to Sherrinford.
“Molly is a selkie.”  Mary explained.
“What about him?”
Later that night after dinner at Angelo’s we returned to the flat and completed round two.  Shortly after my phone moaned.
“Is that a yes?” John was beginning to become annoyed with Sherlock’s limited answers.
I startled and took a step back.  It was obvious what the words were from.  I had nearly forgotten John’s admission that he had cheated while texting.  It seemed that betrayal had been with my own sister.  “Stop.”
“Can I…?”  John whispered.
“I love you.”  The words came out without Sherlock meaning to say them.
John entered the room and stood beside the bed, looking down at his king, and his daughter.  His eyes were red and swollen from crying.  “I’m sorry.”
John slowly shook his head.  “I am the father of your child.  I will be there for you, always.  Don’t you know that?”
I stopped playing and stared at her, unsure how she knew.
“Sherlock… Don’t.”  Her tone was threatening in a way I had come to respect.
“And don’t think I haven’t noticed that you’re killing yourself for him.”
John gave a helpless sort of laugh and rubbed his face.  “I have two hours to shag you or else he’ll kill you.”
“You haven’t been taking care of yourself.  You starting to smell like me.  We’ll drain the tub and you can take a shower.”
“And find Mycroft!”  John commanded as they dragged Sherlock away.
“But… Why?”
“It could have been better.”
The courtyard was quiet.  The body of the guard lay crumpled on the ground, blood in a puddle below him.  Lord John and Lestrade stood, watching Sherlock work over the body.
John followed Sherlock out and stood on the sidewalk beside him, looking up the building their appointment was to be held.  John noticed the name “Trevor” as they entered.
Sherlock blinked… And blinked again.  “You do not think this will be pleasant for me?”
“Go away!  You’re not wanted here!”  John demanded, stomping a foot on the ground.
Finally the detective blinked.  At least his eyeballs wouldn’t dry out.
“Of course not…” Sherlock answered softly.
Rosie placed her most recent ball of bread into her mouth, pressing a finger there as she regarded Molly.  “Hello, Aunt Molly.”
“Oh, Sherlock…” Molly approached my chair and crouched down before me, looking up at my attempts to cover my tears.  “I’m so sorry.”
“Well… I was thinking… you might like some company.  I have a flat… and I can share.  There’s extra room for you and even another flat for you to have privacy during full moon.”
“No.  I liked it.  I liked it a lot, actually.  I just wasn’t prepared for it.”
“But not in the tub.”  John answered, sitting up.  “We should dry off and get dressed.”
“So… You are his brother?”
“I hurt you far more than you hurt me.  It was only transport.  I would heal.”
John covered his mouth with his hand, desperate to make very little noise as his partner started to bob his head.  There was no way to control the excited breathing and he took shallow gasps of air.  The hand not occupied with silencing made its way down to tangle fingers in Sherlock’s curly locks.
How the forest god came to adapt to city life is another story.  But our detective was happy to have him in his bed and in his life.  Maybe, just maybe, having some emotional entanglements were nice.
Rosie swallowed.  “Daddy said a bad word.”
The detective sighed in that “why is my partner so dim?” sort of way.  “What do you think it was?”
Sherlock managed to pull his gaze from the floor to rest on John’s face, more than a little afraid at what he would see there.  Biting his lips, he took a quick breath and held it.
"Don't be stupid." The Doctor warned, fixing Sherlock with a stare which made Sherlock shiver.
until I'm begging you to stop, don't you?” Sherlock continues to whisper, his voice low and husky.
“Right on all accounts, John. I’m very impressed.” Sherlock smiled.
The younger teen rests his hand on John's chest, feeling the rise and fall of his breathing. He runs a finger down his breast bone, stopping at John's belly-button before looking back at John for permission. John nods and smiles softly, folding his arms behind his head as Sherlock's finger goes further down, running a delicate line down the older teen's cock; causing him to moan loudly and buck his hips slightly.
“Stay right here, I'll be right back.” Greg whispers back, trying to suppress a moan.
“Amen to that, mate.”
“Well, anyway. Would you like some tea, dear?”
"Okay, then."
The younger man glared at his partner; who quirked an eyebrow in response, daring the younger man to challenge him.
He huffs at me, because he knows the look; of course I've solved it, just need to prove it.
“Back home with Mycroft and Greg. She has a few cuts and bruises but nothing that won't heal within a few days.”
.” Sherlock moans, his body responding to John's lust.
“Of course I want this.” John says softly, crawling off the bed and sitting next to Sherlock. “But with every relationship there are pros and cons. You just have to hope there are more good things than bad. And with you, there are. You already know my habits, my daft little quirks, what annoys me and what makes me happy. You know all of it, Sherl. That's why I've been wanting to ask you out for a while but knowing,
“Obviously.” Sherlock replies and John can hear the smug smirk he's sporting.
Maggie laughs softly at the vampire, wondering what exactly his brother has done for Sherlock to dislike him so much.
“He does. Go ask him.”
“So, we gonna do this again, Sher?” The man asks, stretched out on the bed completely spent.
“All in a day's work, Sir.” Anthea sighs tiredly, swaying where she stands.
call me that.” Sherlock growls, grabbing his clothes off the floor.
He chuckles softly, "You've got nerve, little girl. I'll give you that."
John laughs and when Sherlock joins in, the two giggle until they're both breathless.
John gets himself fully seated and stops for a moment, allowing Sherlock to adjust to the feeling.
John is busy searching through the wife's dresser when he feels the impact of wood hitting bone; his head spinning and vision blurring as he turns to face his attacker.
"No, you don't go in." The Doctor replied, almost sadly.
"Daddy, I met the most strangest man today."
“Fine.” Sherlock sighs dramatically, going into his wardrobe to look for appropriate clothing. “What does one wear to something like this?”
Mycroft sighs back and Greg can tell he probably looks more ruffled than is strictly professional.
Sherlock smiles to himself before walking off into the night in search of his next meal.
"It's okay." He assures me. “John, there's something you should know, I meant to tell you but I didn't know how you'd react ...”
"Three years in the future, as I said."
“Oh, my.” Mrs Hudson replied, blushing.
“I love you too, sweetheart.” Sherlock smiled, wrapping an arm around John.
"Yes, well ..."
“Okay.”
"Yes. Who are you?"
"Oh, I almost forgot. Harriet, I got you a present. It's a gem stone from the plant Zagro."
Sherlock leaned his head back and looked at John.
Sherlock smiles back and then slowly crawls out of bed, stretching his long limbs while John watches his boyfriend's movements with a lazy smile.
"Come on, let's go ... I love you, you know that right?"
in love.”
Sherlock smiles softly as John wraps his arms around him and leans in to kiss his neck.
John is fully naked on the bed and looks over at Sherlock as he enters; taking in Sherlock's naked form as each part of skin is revealed.
"A vampire." He repeats slowly
from your work and we've just started talking. Right. I might forget all that. Useless information stored in my mind palace usually gets erased.”
. They're
"Then work on them! Your daughter needs her
“Why the bloody hell would I want to do that? I'm in love with you, you stupid man!” Mycroft yells, shocking all three of them with his blatant honesty.
"What?"
"I'll ring an ambulance and tell them what's happened. Do you know how much blood you've lost? I think you'll need a blood transfusion."
"Well, no. That was your decision."
“Mycroft, piss off home. I don't need you.” Sherlock calls down, knowing that even over the tv, he'll hear him.
“Yes, but really, Sherlock. Eyes? In a science class room so close to the canteen?”
“There doing that
Sherlock carefully places John down on the sofa as the ex-army doctor drifts in and out of consciousness.
“See if I was a copper right now, I'd be patting you down for drugs.”
?” John asks with a smirk, mimicking Mycroft's use of Greg's full name.
Then a gentle hum and a whoosh of leaves happened near him.
don't age then?”
“I dunno, maybe. I mean, everyone goes through boyfriends and girlfriends throughout their life. What's the point in thinking that far ahead? Shit, I'm seventeen and don't even know if I'm set on going to uni yet, never mind thinking about what I'll be doing in ten years.”
“Oh, there was no
“I dunno, considering you said that you don't date
"I'll explain later. Let's go in, shall we?”
Harriet nodded and ran to her room while Sherlock watched the scene unfold.
“Sher, what have I told you about playing with your food? She is very pretty though, darling.” An older blonde man says softly, dropping down off the shed roof.
“Eight years? You've never told me that's how you felt.” Greg replies sadly, staring into the fire.
Sherlock scoffed at this. "How boring."
“Don't apologise. This is good. Everyone
“I can
“Very well, brother mine, I shall be round tomorrow. Blood is in Mrs Hudson's fridge. Be sure to get it before she returns, she might turn utterly monstrous otherwise.”
"Well, I never believed it until now. John takes everything I throw at him and has always stood by me."
The younger teen hisses in pain at first but tries to breathe through it, focusing on the sensation.
"I know, it's Dimensionally Transcendental, which means the larger interior can fit inside the smaller exterior. It also has a chameleon circuit, enabling the machine to blend in with its surroundings. It takes a lot to impress me, Doctor but this definitely comes close." Sherlock replied, looking around at the machine.
Sherlock leans in and kisses John in response, purring low in his throat.
Over the years, Harriet Hamish Holmes-Watson grew progressively in all forms. She became very tall within two years, could read at an adult level by nine and was creating experiments with her dad by eleven.
“Sherly! Ya came! Come 'ere and give me a hug!” Greg grins, stumbling into Sherlock; who gives him an awkward hug before pushing him away.
“Yeah, but half your record convictions will be spent by the time you train to become a cop. And besides, if Mycroft really is going into the government, I'm sure he'd make that record disappear.” John smiles, leaning against the wall and taking the cigarette from Greg.
Before he ran off after the creature.
“Such foul words out of such a pretty mouth.” Davies smiles, leaning in to touch Sherlock's face.
