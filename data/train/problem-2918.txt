“And why do you care so much about it?”
His fingers tighten around the steering wheel. Yes. That’s Dean’s problem, not Cas’.
His chest constricts at the thought, and Dean tells himself to pay attention to what he’s doing, to drive away from the terrible thoughts before he’s breaking into the liquor cabinet. A hand on his shoulder snaps him out of it, and he turns to look at Sam, who’s frowning at him in concern.
“We’re going to tell Michael that I ran away because I was afraid of facing rejection within our community for being a queer man,” Cas explains without blinking.
Cas starts, sounding inevitably awkward himself,
“How could I,” Cas grits his teeth.
. But the silence between them is too thick, too heavy to be lifted and, eventually, Cas shakes his head and leaves. And Dean stands there, with his bad choices, with his soured feelings and his soiled dreams and
It’s exciting for them, to watch things grow, and, in turn, it’s exciting for him to watch them
Cas’ childhood home is the most ostentatious house around. It was built with the same materials as the rest of the houses, but it’s bigger and sturdier, like a rustic-style mansion. More befitting of what a leader is supposed to have. Cas guides him into the library, hoping to find documents detailing the settlement’s demographics.
John Winchester speaks in Dean’s head, gruff and cruel and probably smelling like Jack’s, just like the bottle Dean keeps under the seat, just like the shots he did before getting into the car and heard Cas’s voicemail message and the poorly built foundations of his heart shook and fell down once again, as if Dean were built upon clay, upon mud, upon sand.
Cas sits down right next to him, sighing deeply before speaking and looking nervous. “There’s been a misunderstanding.”
The day is bright and sunny, after a weekend ruined by heavy rain and moody clouds. Dean should have seen it coming, with both Claire and Jack bouncing around the castle and staring longingly at the gardens through foggy windows.
. He was in pain. It was gut-wrenching.”
“It’s
“Dean, you should go to bed,” Cas is still touching him, but removes his hand when Dean leans back to properly sit on his chair.
There’s an exact replica of John’s voice in Dean’s head, and it says,
“I can’t believe you’re so wet,” Cas wonders, pulling Dean’s pants and his underwear down further. His hands reach around, each one grabbing a handful of asscheek, and Dean lets out an embarrassingly loud moan as Cas squeezes them. It’s not exactly a comfortable position for dick sucking, so he totally gets it when Cas asks for the lotion in the first aid kit and reaches for Dean’s cock instead of putting his mouth on it.
“What are you doing out here? It’s late. You should be in bed.”
“They know how loved they are, Cas,” Dean says, his cheek turning red with the liberty he’s just taken. Castiel doesn’t seem to mind the sudden nickname, but Dean’s still embarrassed. “I know they have a future role to fulfill and proper royal duties, but… they’re children, and I want them to be children for as long as they can. I care about them.”
He grew lonely soon, feeling so far away from the husband who won’t look at him or touch him. But the children are a completely different story, and that’s why Dean sticks to his early mornings, still.
Almost seven years older than Dean, and way too fucking charming, Lee helped Dean remember the things he loved the most about the open road and the simplicity of just… leading a life as simple as ganking monsters and helping people. Dean liked the person he was when he was with Lee: someone
“I’m going to get rid of you, like I should have after I ate your parents,” Michael hisses, raising his claws. Dean quickly looks around him for something,
“You just did! This was my hunt!”
“Okay,” Dean sags, shoulders hunched. “You… you want to be on your own.”
But Dean, emboldened by alcohol and affection, cradles Cas’ face between his hands and softly kisses him on the lips.
Ruby looks even poutier when she talks again. “There must be a reason he isn’t yammering about Castiel finding a nice woman and procreating.”
“Me too,” Anael’s voice comes muffled, her face pressed against Cas’ shoulder. “I’m not angry at you, Castiel.”
“What makes you think you get to decide what’s right or safe for me?” Dean asks tiredly, body taut with an exhausting sort of anger.
“Yeah, man,” Dean braves, looking at him through his eyelashes. “I bet we could have a really good time together.”
“Big… cat?”
Dean comes like that, eyes squeezed shut, with a loud, stuttering moan, clenching around Cas like a vice, never wanting to let go. Cas scoops up the come on his stomach and thumbs Dean’s lower lip with it, ordering him to lick it with a grunt. Dean does as told, sucking and licking Cas’ fingers until he’s coming too, spilling hot and deep into Dean’s body.
“Don’t be a brat,” Cas growls, burying his fingers in Dean’s hair, pulling Dean’s head closer to his cock. Dean huffs, pretending to be offended, but he’s having a way too much fun riling Cas up. He swallows his cock quickly, his eyes fixed on Cas’ face, secretly pleased that he still remembers all the tricks that make Cas shudder and moan, all the ways he can make Cas pull at his hair so hard that Dean ends up letting him fuck his face, allowing Cas’ grip on him to guide him. He bobs his head up and down as Cas pushes into his mouth greedily, feeling
it-- to continue.
“Cas…”
“What is it?” Dean asks.
. Cas shuffles closer to him, pants off and just as naked as him, then wraps them both in his hand, making a tunnel with his fist and panting into Dean’s hair, planting messy kisses to Dean’s jaw, until he’s coming in soft waves, body going boneless on the mattress.
“My lord,” Dean said as he walked up to him. Hesitantly, he held Castiel’s hands in his own, heart beating too fast. “You just need to look at her eyes and hold her like this.”
“Do I look like I know?” Bobby grumbles.
Dean closes his eyes, smiling when he feels Cas’ lips on his forehead. “I’m glad you’re back, Cas.”
“You’re right,” Anael purses her lips, then focusing her hazel eyes on Dean. In a second, she goes from frowning and pouting to smirking. “So. You’re the husband.”
He said
“We need to talk.”
Once he’s done cleaning the wound, he soaks some clean gauze with the saline solution he keeps for this sort of thing, preparing the wound for suturing. He threads the needle before Cas’ impatient eyes and gets close to Cas’ thigh so he can see better once he starts stitching.
She's happy.
properly. “For your wedding, my lord.”
Their laughter abruptly dies when they spot Cas standing a few feet away from the puddle, arms crossed and looking disgruntled, his frowny face doing frowny things. Claire immediately yelps and hides behind Dean, Jack following her.
“Yes.”
. Anger is easier than sadness and disappointment, it’s lighter to bear. It’s less consuming. Less painful.
“No…” Dean croaked, turning to look at Cas. He was standing next to him, his wide, dark wings were back to normal, and he looked at him with sorrowful eyes that made Dean want to puke again. “Cas, don’t.”
Her eyes shine as she smiles, and the hope Dean sees there makes her look younger. Something sinks in his stomach, but he manages a trembling smile for her. There’s something there. Something that isn’t right, and Dean absolutely hates the feeling in his gut.
“Fuck, Dean.
“I want to help them too.” Cas nods, looking earnest. “But I can’t do it on my own.”
“I’m going to assume you’ve done that before,” Cas huffs, looking uncomfortable.
“Dean,” Cas says, looking nonchalant as he cleans his hands with a rag. “I didn’t expect to see you again,” he says, smiling. Dean wants to punch his perfect teeth.
“After dinner, sure,” Anael agrees, sending Cas a significant look. “Next to the mill. Our usual place.”
“Castiel,” he repeats, opening his arms wide, and Dean perks up at the name. “The beehives have missed you, dear brother. Our bees have mourned you dearly.”
Dean definitely doesn’t think about the short list of contacts in his phone, of the number of people who won’t pick up if he needs them, refuses to think about the empty corners of his life that Cas filled so neatly.
Cas smiles, leaning down for a sweet kiss, slower than the previous ones. Less frantic. He unbuttons Dean’s shirt slowly, stealing touches and kisses, then sits back to help Dean get rid of his clothes. Dean does the same, unwrapping Cas from every layer with shaking hands, pressing kisses to the skin he’s longed to touch for so long.
“Jesus fuck,” Dean cusses, to no one in particular, and that’s when it finally sinks in that Cas, the random guy he met at a bar just two days ago, is a
. Had they been friends? Had he still been an obligation to Cas, his mission?
“Get some sleep, Dean,” Cas’ eyes shutter quickly, face going cold, looking just the way he did the day he left Dean. And he does the same thing he did that time: he walks away.
They kiss for a long while, lips sliding together to make up for the lost time until Dean’s hunger gets the better of him. “Let me suck you off,” he rasps, making a soft humming noise when Cas kisses the corner of his mouth.
“Sorry to hear that,” Dean says, and he means it. She looks tired. Luckily, the problem with the steps looks like a quick, easy fix. “Is this a busy season or something?”
The crowd goes wild with thunderous applause, chanting
Sam’s away on a hunt and Dean’s alone with Jack and his own neuroses and paranoia, rocking Jack in his arms and begging him to just
“Huh. He didn’t say anything about me and Cas.”
“Dean—” Cas says, in that placating, condescending tone he sometimes uses. Dean hates it so fucking much.
“Uhhh, you’ve lost me,” Dean’s almost done with the steps at this point. He’s glad this lady is so chatty, because he’s starting to feel like Cas just threw him to the wolves when he brought him here.
But then, Cas’ fingers are sliding inside of him and that’s all Dean can think about. Everything else fades away as Dean enjoys the weight of Cas against his back, the way Cas knows how to twist his fingers just
The last thing Dean wants is to get burned again.
“About time,” Cas mutters.
Cas reaches for the oil on his bedside table and then he’s wrapping his fingers around Dean’s erection, hot lips pressed to Dean’s pulse point on his neck as he throws his head back, squeezing his eyes shut. Cas hums, gravelly and deep, thumbing at the slit of Dean’s cock, drawing filthy moans out of him, stroking Dean from base to tip, spreading the wetness around the head until Dean is begging for
The local newspaper in a small town on the border of Utah and Nevada publishes a small article about moving objects that makes Dean suspect there’s a case there. Maybe a quick salt n’ burn, something easy to pass time, to distract himself from the ache that has taken up permanent residence inside his heart. It hurts constantly, the space Cas used to occupy just by merely existing: the right side of the bed, his place right next to Dean in the Impala, his chest pressed against Dean’s back, arms surrounding Dean’s waist.
Somehow, feeling abandoned hurts more than feeling rejected.
Cas practically rips Dean’s shirt off as an answer, “Dean. Please,” he says, looking almost pained. He knows they should talk about this, worried by how hard Cas’ hands are shaking, how fragile his eyes look. His touches are frantic and rushed and Dean has to help him remove his shirt before Cas ends up strangling himself with it.
, he tells himself.
“Cas,” Dean pleads, because he feels embarrassed, but Cas won’t let him get away with that. He kisses Dean, licking into his lips, slipping his tongue into Dean’s mouth, to claim every little corner, while Dean squirms under him.
“No! Geez, Bobby. Delicate, much? I’m in the middle of an emergency here.”
“Can I sit?” Cas gestures at the seat across from Dean, behaving way more politely than he usually does. If they were on better terms, Dean would actually find it amusing.
What a goddamn trainfuck of a mess.
“What?”
“Cas, buddy,” Dean tries again. “You gotta tell me what’s going on.”
“I guess,” Dean mumbles, but he’s unwilling to admit that he knows what he wants. He wants a life beyond killing evil things and, while he enjoys the freedom of the open road, there’s the longing for a safe place to land, too. Dean barely remembers the house where his mom loved him, but it’s there, right at the bottom of his chest, buried under dirty gas stations and countless plain-looking motel rooms. Dean loves Baby, he really does, but on the coldest, hardest days, she doesn’t feel like enough. And that’s something he’s never been brave enough to tell Sam.
, but Dean doesn’t think that he’s in the position to ask Cas for that sort of stuff.
Cas hesitates a little before leaning closer and kissing Dean’s lips softly, slowly but deeply. Dean closes his eyes and it feels like the entire world stops. It’s the gentlest, more intense kiss he’s ever received.
Dean’s hands are shaking around Baby’s wheel and then they’re not, then it’s not Lee saying
Until Sam got fed up with Dean’s bullshit and ran away to Flagstaff.
“Dean, I can’t… I can’t stay here. If Michael finds me…”
“Sorry,” Dean grunts, “Michael gives me the creeps.”
“Thank god,” Dean whines. “I was about to starve, dude.”
—Crying, Dean’s crying, like a fucking child who got something ripped away from him, like crying would fix something, anything.
It was almost midnight by the time they returned to the shitty motel room Dean had booked earlier, and the smell of the sleazy strip club was just starting to dissipate from Dean's nose. He switched on the light, and the light bulb flickered twice before dying, drowning the room in darkness.
“You’re too cheery,” Cas grunts. “Nobody should be legally allowed to be a morning person.”
“Thank you…”
“I know moping when I see it, buddy.”
“I’m glad that you picked me,” Dean grins, feeling happy enough to shout it from the highest tower in the castle. “I’m-- I’m happy. That we’re a family. That’s all I ever wanted.”
“What look?”
Dean goes to bed alone that night, just like the rest of the nights following Lee’s departure.
“Mmm,” Dean hums, uncapping a bottle of water and soaking some gauze with it, slowly and carefully cleaning the wound. “This is going to need stitches.”
“That’s okay, buddy,” Dean pats his shoulder, ignoring how much he wants to hug Cas again, how much he wants to
Jack doesn’t cry, and neither does Dean. Instead, the boy waves a tiny hand at Dean’s face until he offers him a finger, just to see what Jack does. Dean doesn’t know what he’s hoping for, he doesn’t know if the kid’s inherited the same inherent
“Oh. Hello!” Dean saw the dark mop of hair shuffle until the man stood up, tall and stiff. It was, in fact, His Royal Highness, in all his awkward glory and dressed to the nines. “What brings you here?”
When he’s back at their room, Cas is passed out under the covers, hair sleep-messy and back still facing the door, because he clearly hasn’t learned enough Hunting 101.
That’s when it hits him like a freight train. The idea that Cas won’t be there anymore, to fill the emptiness that lives in Dean. That Dean could die at any moment, in some random hunt and nobody would find out, because nobody would care enough to find out. At some point during his… acquaintanceship with Cas, Dean lowered his walls and became stupid enough to believe that he had found something permanent. That he and Cas would hunt, free on the open road until that way of living became unsustainable and they finally settled down. Dean’s never had a home, but he makes homes out of people.
Dean huffs. “It’s just mud.”
Cas shakes his head, the barest hint of a smile on his face. He brings the glass to his lips, and Dean follows the movements of his throat as he drinks what’s left of his disgustingly bitter beer. Once his thirst is successfully quenched, Cas drops a bill on top of the bar and leaves his chair. “Maybe next time,” he says, before picking up his leather jacket from the chair. “Bye, Dean.”
“A reference,” Cas repeats, squinting. “To what.”
Cas hugs him back and Dean melts into his touch, resting his cheek on Cas’ shoulder. “I don’t—I don’t really know.”
“Where?”
Cas smiles, fond. He presses two fingers into Dean’s hole, leaving him breathless. “The look you give me every time I do this,” Cas murmurs, focusing on fucking his fingers in and out of Dean.
“Pardon my boldness, my lord, but you don’t sound too happy about getting married,” Dean said, like a fool. His father used to say that his big mouth was going to get him in trouble one day.
“Bossy,” Cas grumbles, actually doing what Dean told him to do, removing his bloodstained jeans and then sitting on the edge of the bed with a pained hiss. Dean goes to the bathroom so he can wash his hands properly, then gets the first aid kit from his duffel. He kneels between Cas’ spread knees and takes a preliminary look at the ugly, bleeding gash.
“Like this?”
The thing about the end of the world was that Dean understood why his future self was such an annoying bitch. Sam was gone, trapped in Lucifer’s clutches, probably lost forever. Dean had failed his most important job: to protect his brother at all costs. He had crumpled down the weight of his own failure and pulled away from everyone, everything.
Again, when he shows up at an abandoned mine shaft outside of the town border, Cas has already taken care of it. Dean gets to see how Cas finishes the job, the way he meticulously cleans his weapon once he’s done, and feels a surge of inadequacy. Dean’s been too slow again, and Cas beating him to it proves how sloppy Dean’s gotten.
“You should’ve told me, Dean,” Cas frowns. “Maybe we should put Jack back in your room, permanently.”
Dean tells himself that he’s fine, that he saw this coming from a mile away, that he and Cas had never agreed to anything. Theirs was a business partnership, nothing more. It was about Dean (pathetic and needy) not wanting to hunt alone, looking for someone to cover his back, and Cas fulfilling that need because he was the only one available to do it.
Sam was gone. The asshole had had the nerve to tell Dean to go and live a normal life, but he was
. “Does it still hurt?”
“I went into the woods last night.”
Cas visibly flinches, and Dean actually regrets jumping straight to the point.
Cas mumbles with a sleepy glare, slowly getting up and making his way to the bathroom, unsteady on his feet and bumping his hip against the old, chipped bedside table. Dean shrugs, suddenly hungry and still way, way too sore. The events of last night are still firmly etched in his head, and he’s not sure if he’s processed them properly yet. He almost regrets asking Cas to partner up with him, but there’s
he thinks.
but then Cas is pulling him towards him, wrapping his arms around Dean’s waist, resting his back against Baby. Dean turns into a rag doll, melting into Cas’ warm embrace and laying his head on Cas’ shoulder, Cas’ lips pressed against Dean’s temple.
Dean feels torn between being pissed and worrying, and since the latter is overwhelming, he focuses on the former. Unfortunately, the worry only intensifies after he steps outside to help a neighbor with his garden and he gets a glimpse of Cas, who’s trailing after Michael and looking busy as fuck. It happens multiple times throughout the day. Every time Dean tries to approach Cas, Michael calls for him or sends him on some shitty errand, and that’s only worsened by the way Cas keeps looking at him. He looks exhausted and apprehensive. Keeps throwing worried glances at him. Dean doesn’t know if it’s about their fight last night or if something else happened, and it’s making him so anxious he can’t even eat when it’s time for lunch.
, Dean thought, grief stuck beneath his heart like a knife, piercing skin and muscle. A wreckage of longing and resentment, packaged in the form of Cas' tired blue eyes, and the grim set of his mouth.
“I can’t—I can’t make any promises, Dean,” Cas begs, and Dean’s heart sinks.
“Nevertheless,” Cas smiles, finally, the corners of his mouth barely quirking up.
“Okay. Fine,” Dean grumbles, finally turning back to leave the entire shitfest behind. “My job here is done.”
“You’re the one that invoked the name of the lord in vain,” Cas snorts, finally pulling out so he can lay next to Dean, covering his face with an arm. Dean longs to cuddle up to his side, to use Cas’ firm stomach as a pillow, but he doesn’t know if he’s allowed to do that, and he’s too afraid of rejection.
People litter around the place, appearing to be content, completing daily, mundane tasks like laundry and chopping wood. Some of them look at Dean curiously, but most seem to be minding their own business. A couple of cats lay sunbathing on the grass, and one of them even tries to sniff Dean before he shoos it away.
“That’s good. We’re going to need that for research,” Dean points out. “Also. Uhhh, I was checking out the joint today and I talked to a lady about, y’know. The disappearances.”
Cas took off his trench coat and laid him across the back of the pickup truck, then cornered Dean against it until he was on his back, laying on top of the thing. Cas kept frantically calling his name, between sloppy kisses and clumsy fumbling. He sucked a bruise on Dean’s neck (like a
and it must’ve forever marred Cas’ relationship with the place.
The room is dusty enough to kickstart Dean’s allergies again, something that doesn’t surprise him at all when he spots the small calico cat sleeping under a chair in the corner next to the biggest bookcase.
Dean hasn’t heard that voice in a good while. “Bobby.”
“Dean,” Cas grabbed him by the shoulders. “You’ll be okay here. This is your chance to live a new life. It’s what Sam wanted for you.”
“And they love you, too. They’re my children, I know them better than myself,” Cas laughs. “You make them happy. You
Suddenly, Cas pulls back, face flushed and sweaty hair plastered to his forehead. “Get up. Get on the bed, on your knees.”
“Thank you, Dean Winchester.”
“I don’t have any lube,” Dean whined, stroking up and down Cas’ gorgeous dick, watching as Cas’ shook under his touch, almost enraptured.
,” Cas babbles, and Dean loves it, he loves that he’s making Cas, who always looks so stoic, lose control like this.
“More people are starting to notice, then. Good,” Cas says, absent-mindedly. “What did you think about it? The
Dean beams, brushing a couple of rebellious hair strands from his husband’s forehead. “I believe you.”
Cas presses a slick finger inside, Dean clenching around him in anticipation already, lifting his hips a little in an attempt to chase Cas’ careful touch. He begs for more and Cas gives him what he wants, adding another lube-soaked finger, pushing and pulling until Dean’s cock starts leaking, hard and flushed between his trembling legs.
“Come here,” Cas slurs, looking drunk with arousal. He pulls Dean into his lap, and Dean rests his hands on Cas’ shoulders to cling onto him as Cas sets a fast, desperate pace. He’s gripping Dean’s hips so tightly that his knuckles have gone white, murmuring soft words of encouragement as he fucks into Dean.
Cas’ clutches him tight against his chest, coming with a soft gasp, spilling deep into Dean’s body, stealing a clumsy kiss from his lips. Dean follows right after, clenching around Cas and greedily trying to keep him inside. He doesn’t allow Cas to pull out right away and they sit there, holding each other and panting, trading lazy kisses.
They’re close enough to breathe the same air. Dean waits until the hazy feeling in his brain dissipates and his heart rate goes back to normal. “Hey,” he says, gruff and sleepy, carding his fingers through Cas’ hair.
“Nothing’s wrong,” Cas says, jaw clenched shut. He opens the car door and slides into the shotgun seat without a word, refusing to say anything else, not even when they start driving. Dean cranks up the music just to deal with the uncomfortable silence until Cas finally falls asleep in his seat. The tight lines of Cas’ face disappear in his sleep, and something heavy and tight settles in Dean’s chest when he looks over at Cas’ peaceful face, thinking about all the puzzle pieces he’s missing.
“I’m not trying to do that,” Cas runs a hand through his messy hair, looking frustrated. “I never meant… you said…” He seems to steel himself, and his handsome face looks like it’s been carved out of stone, building a wall around himself to keep Dean as far away as possible. “I’m ending our partnership now. I’m sorry, I truly am. It’s not you, Dean.”
It’s easy to get lost in the new routine. Cas provides more than backup during hunts, he provides companionship that Dean didn’t want to admit that he needed. Their conversations aren’t anything big, still settling into getting to know each other after only a couple of weeks of working together, but Dean has come to realize that Cas is a pretty tight-lipped guy. So far, the only things Dean knows about Cas are that he loves really juicy burgers and weed.
Cas’ clumsy paws leave his face only to grab at Dean by the waist, pulling him closer, until Dean’s climbing into Cas’ lap, straddling him. “Where’s Jack?” He manages to ask between hungry, sloppy kisses.
“Thank you, Dean,” Castiel says, leaning a little closer. He hasn’t let go of Dean’s hand. “I’d be lost without you.”
And Cas, amazing, stubborn, grumpy, compassionate, and awkward Cas, pressed a kiss to his forehead and promised once more, “You’ll never have to be alone again, Dean.”
Against his better judgement, heart beating too fast, Dean picks up.
Months of being married, and they barely see each other. Castiel, too busy answering the call of duty while Dean takes care of his children.
There had always been something between the two of them, a buzzing that threatened to swallow Dean down. He refused to recognize it as something merely more than a strong desire to fuck someone hot.
Every once in a while, they get the chance to share a meal or have a quick moment alone together, and Dean cherishes those more than he should. Even when they're just discussing possible theories and small clues they've noticed, he's happy to just spend time with Cas. They're not moving forward with the case, unfortunately, but at least Dean is still able to try to make Cas chuckle at a dumb joke or force him to try something new Dean made for dinner.
“You should be,” Castiel says, sounding sad. Anael only shakes her head before letting him go.
“A misunderstanding?”
“You’ve been busy all day.”
Dean spends most of the ride trying to get out of his own head, with Cas barely speaking, until they decide to stop in a tiny town near Salt Lake City, booking a room at a roadside motel that’s been painted a bright, annoying lime green. Cas grumbles about it, then complains about the moldy bathroom and the dusty bed frame but flops down anyway on the bed, immediately turning away from Dean.
The last thing he remembers before falling asleep is Cas pulling the comforter on top of them, and the gentleness of his lips on Dean’s sweaty temple.
“One, because it’s a fucking dump,” Dean snorts, “and two, because it’s all the way across the country, so. Umm, no thanks.”
“I was nervous because I wanted you so much,” Dean explains, pressing a small kiss against Cas’ cheek. “Not because I was scared.”
“I can’t,” Dean grits out, sweat running down his temple, “I can’t, Cas, I’m going to fall down,” he moans, legs shaking harder than ever, gripping Cas’ shoulders just to stay on his feet, fingers digging into the leather of Cas’ jacket. Cas says nothing, still nibbling Dean’s hip, his fingers moving harder, faster, until he’s right there, making Dean come with a cry.
“Yeah— yeah, okay.”
“You were nervous!”
He walks down the hallway to see the rest of the place, pausing to check the bathroom, which is also nice, if a little small. The next stop on the tour includes the only bedroom in the house and that’s when Dean has to stop and do a double-take, because there’s. Only one bed.
“I’m going to ride you,” Dean mumbled, putting his hands on top of Cas’ chest. “’That okay?”
But he’s been proven wrong now, and he’s never been happier about it. Last night, when they made the decision to move on to the next chapter, laying together on the bed they shared for almost a month, Dean had dared to be honest.
Dean blinks, and the Mark of Cain throbs on his arm, poison in his veins, the grip of his hand around a knife —a blade, a pool stick, a gun— poised right above Castiel, and Cas says
“Cas,” Dean says, voice hoarse. “I want you to fuck me.”
“Yeah, but first,” Dean smiles, but it’s still wobbly. “I need you to meet someone.”
“We gotta—
Dean stands there for a long time, thinking about the people who have disappeared, about Muriel’s joyful smile, about the ones who, just like her, look forward to Heaven.
And that’s when Dean just—just
“I guess,” Dean shrugs again, feeling even more embarrassed than before. He feels like he’s kind of throwing a tantrum over something really dumb.
Michael is looking at them with a frown and his face is a little red with anger.
“Yeah well, there’s your confirmation.”
At that, Dean tries to give him a winning smile. "Yeah? You come here often, then?"
“Yeah,” Cas grunts, flopping on the bed next to the door. “I’m going to need all the sleep I can get if I’m going to deal with that asshole again.”
Mournfully, Dean leaves the bed and looks for a bathrobe he saw in the bathroom when he was scoping the place yesterday, so he can start getting breakfast ready. When they entered the compound the day before, one of the first things Dean noticed was the freakishly long giant picnic tables that they probably use for communal meals, but Dean has a feeling that they aren’t used every day, so he’s just going to stick to their kitchen and… yeah, it’s completely stocked, which freaks him out a lot because they weren’t expected to be back at the compound but this damn house still has everything they’d need for it to be livable.
They stay like that, breathing together, Cas sitting and Dean kneeling until his eyelids start to feel heavy, and Dean clumsily climbs into the bed, naked from the waist down. “That was good,” he says.
Cas shakes his head. “No, you don’t understand… there were rules. There were a lot of rules. And I broke the most important one.”
“Goodbye, Dean,” he hears Cas say, because Dean refuses to look at him anymore. He climbs back into bed, sinking under the covers and pretending that he doesn’t hear Cas lock the door on his way out. So Dean can pretend that Cas never left and that his place is right next to Dean, in an infinite number of different motel beds, Dean’s head on Cas’ chest.
goes unsaid.
Under Cas’ annoyed glare, Dean lets out a chuckle. “Dean Winchester. Cas has told me a lot about you.”
“Don’t try to excuse it, Dean,” Cas cuts him off. “I don’t want to hear it. What I did was inexcusable and it’s time that I fixed that. I’ve been thinking… I need to know that she’s alive and well, that she’s not missing.”
a needy bastard. This is more about Dean desperately wanting to be with Cas than about comforting him. He allows Cas to pull his shirt off between heated kisses, to pull down Dean’s pants as his hands roam everywhere, his touch almost hot enough to brand him. He kneels between Cas spread legs, in a parody of the first time they had sex. Part of Dean almost wishes that they were back to that first shitty motel room, bloody and dirty, without any sort of knowledge about each other’s bodies. Before Dean knew how it felt to sleep with his back pressed to Cas’ chest, and the frumpy look of Cas’ crazy bedhead in the mornings.
Last year, when Dean only had Lee and his mood swings for company, when all his texts and calls to Sam and Dad went unanswered, he never would have thought that he’d get to have some degree of normalcy in his life.
“Yes, I saw you working hard all day,” Michael’s lips curl into a smug smile, because the bastard never manages to look different. “I admire your dedication and how skillful you are, Dean. Your willingness to help others is outstanding. I’ve never met anyone like you.”
The determination on Cas’ face makes Dean want to crumple, and he’s torn between crying like a baby and—doing something that he wouldn’t have dared to do in his wildest dreams, but Cas’ gentle touch seems to make it a possibility. Something that could be attainable, if Dean dares to be brave enough.
for this.”
Dean doesn’t even try to touch himself, wanting to come just like this, with the hot, agonizing drag of Cas’ cock against his prostate as Cas pounds into him, calling Dean’s name over and over again.
“Stop arguing with the cat and help me, Dean.”
…” Dean groaned, throwing his head back once Cas got one of his giant paws on his cock. It was too dry, and the angle was a bit uncomfortable, but Cas was
Not wanting to interrupt Cas’ sullen mood, Dean avoids going back to the motel by hitting the first bar he finds, sitting at the counter, and ordering a glass of whiskey. It turns out to be a smart choice, because he spends the next few hours talking to a farmer that has already lost four sheep and a calf in one of the mysterious attacks reported by the paper. Dean promises him that he will take a look at his barn the following night since he’s already suspecting they’re dealing with a good ol’ chupacabra.
“We’ll do this as a team, Cas.”
Eventually, Cas wakes up enough to look at his surroundings through the window, bleary-eyed and grumpy, only to frown at the sight of the road.
The hot stranger huffs. "Aren't you funny."
Dean should be ashamed, he thinks, of how much he loves sucking cock. How much he loves pulling back and rolling his tongue around the head of Cas’ dick, sucking the tip and then swallowing Cas’ entire length in one go. But he isn’t. He bobs up and down Cas’ cock, determined to make it good for him, running a soothing hand over the skin of Cas’ uninjured thigh, wishing he could ask Cas to crush Dean’s head with his strong, hairy thighs.
“Morning,” Sam yawns, opening the fridge and staring at the contents, probably looking for his weird protein powder. Dean’s too busy preparing formula to care about Sam’s gross morning shakes.
“Cas, it wasn’t your fault.” Dean breathes deeply, rolling onto his back, staring at the ceiling instead. “It was a shitty situation, man.”
“Dean?” Bobby’s gruff voice answers, genuinely surprised. “Boy, what the hell? I haven’t heard from you in years! Do I look like a ditchable prom date to you?”
“I know you feel like that right now,” Dean says. “But we’ve got a game plan: you snoop around a little, I play nice and keep an eye out and once we find out what’s going on, we get it done and then you’ll never have to come back here, Cas.”
for cooking,” Claire snorts.
“It’s fine,” Dean shrugs. “I guess it’s kind of weird to go back to sleeping alone, after months of having the little dude with me.”
“You seem thoughtful,” Castiel’s gravelly voice rumbles behind him. Dean turns to look at him, not moving from his seated position on the grass.
“I’m just a quick thinker,” Cas relaxes against the farm’s fence. The sky is tinted as dark as it can get, littered with stars, away from the city lights. “Or maybe you aren’t focused enough.”
“Look,” Dean grits out, “I just want to know how the hell are you so
Cas smiles. It’s a bitter, sad thing. “No. They never were.”
Cas nodded.
“We ascend once we’re ready to answer Heaven’s call, of course! We’re angels in waiting, but the only one who can talk to God is Michael. That’s why he leads us, bless his heart. He shares with us the word of God every morning, and tells us when one of us has been called.”
Cas’ hot mouth chases his in a messy, wet kiss as they pant together, and it’s all Dean needs, it’s all Dean is ever going to need, the absolutely filthy drag of Cas’ cock against his prostate and his big hands gripping tight into his skin, leaving bruises that will remind Dean of him.
when he wants to make him scream. How stretched out he feels around Cas’ cock once he pushes in, immediately setting a brutal pace, letting out all of his desperation on Dean’s willing body, until his legs are shaking with the need to come and he’s burying his face in the comforter, pressing loud, pitiful sounds against the fabric, ass up in the air, Cas’ big hands gripping his hips hard enough to bruise.
“It’s just—I…” Dean swallows back a sudden desire to cry. “I’m just—you were gone and…”
“It comes with the title.”
“Want you inside,” Dean babbles, letting out soft little moans. “In me. Want you so much,” words seem to leave his mouth unfiltered, like he’s suddenly forgotten how to be embarrassed. Cas holds him down with a hand on his hip, angling his fingers just
Dean looks for them, yelling their names everywhere, shying away from the judgy looks from some of the servants until he finds them playing near the strawberry fields.
They make list after list, naming all the creatures they can think of that live long lives and manage to stay young. The possibilities are far more numerous than Dean expected, and he’s starting to get the biggest headache of his life. He’s about to suggest a break when there’s a knock on the door, and Cas gets up from the couch to open it. Anael is standing in the doorframe, looking somber and more serious than Dean’s ever seen her since they met.
The moment Dean got out of Zachariah’s sick apocalyptic fantasy; Dean stumbled into Cas’ arms as soon as he was able to. “Never change, buddy.”
At home, the lights are bright and Sam’s okay, Eileen by his side, and Cas won’t speak to him, Cas won’t look at him and it carves this empty space in Dean’s chest, this hole of need and rage that beats to the tune of
holds him in his hand. “Yeah. Yeah, okay,” is all Dean can say, suddenly losing all his critical thinking skills. Cas is heavy and warm in the palm of his hand, and then he’s guiding him to his mouth, softly kissing the tip first, savoring Cas’ musky flavor.
,” Dean rambles, trying his best to organize his frantic thoughts. “Soul eater! He could be a soul eater or a kind of soul eater.”
“You seem a little on edge.”
Dean closes his lips around the head again, sucking with his eyes closed, already getting acquainted with the salty flavor of Cas’ skin. Cas groans, hips rocking up into Dean’s mouth, and Dean takes more of him, swallowing past the head and going as far as he can without gagging.
Castiel lets out a very unprincely snort, then, to Dean’s surprise, sits next to him on the grass, and scrunches his nose at how cold it is. “I don’t think that’s necessary; you always seem lost in thought.”
Dean is starting to hate phones a lot.
Slowly, Cas drops the body and wipes his hands on a rag, then raises his gaze to look at Dean, an awkward beat of silence passing between them.
“There was no blood, Dean. None at all.”
“Oh! You’re Castiel’s boy. Right, right,” she nods approvingly, as if Castiel were there to see her approve of his choices. “That boy. So scatterbrained!”
“Cas, don’t beat yourself up,” Dean says. “Look… I don’t know what’s bothering you, but if you ever feel like talking about it… I mean, I’m pretty bad at this ‘talking about feelings’ crap, but I can try. For you. I guess,” he adds, nervously. Cas looks grateful at not being pressured, digging into his food, but not raising the subject again.
“Son of a bitch. A minor fucking deity. What the actual fuck.”
Dean’s not complaining at all, closing his eyes and throwing his head back, surrendering himself to Cas’ touch, fucking into Cas’ tight fist surrounding his erection, arching his back when Cas nudges his thighs apart just a little and nudges a slick finger behind his balls, pushing against his rim until it slides all the way inside. Dean whimpers then, a pitiful, needy sound. His thighs shake and he doesn’t know if his legs will be able to keep him from falling.
“I see,” Michael hums, still looking at Dean in a way that makes him want to scrub himself clean. “Castiel, you’ve been busy.”
Dean doesn’t elaborate. He doesn’t tell Cas that he’s perpetually disappointed that life on the road is so incompatible with an accessible kitchen most of the time. He doesn’t tell him about all the recipes he learned and collected as a teenager, eager to feed and please his family for a little bit of praise. It’s too embarrassing.
“Here,” Cas throws him his jeans, but they’re so filthy and covered in mud that Dean ends up leaving them on the floor. He fishes some clean boxers from his duffel and flops back down on the bed just as Cas picks up his own shredded and blood-stained jeans with a frown.
“God,” Dean rolled his eyes, turning on the bed to look at Cas. “No wonder you’re going to die a virgin, what…”
“Shh,” Cas says, sounding amused. “I knew you’d like this since the moment you kneeled in front of me,” he taunts, pressing a hot, open-mouthed kiss to Dean’s hip, sucking a bruise into the skin as he slides another finger inside Dean. Cas pushes his fingers in and out, fucking into Dean with a hard, steady pace, driving him crazy every time he nudges his prostate with them.
“I’m already destroyed, Dean.”
“Yeah, yeah. Be careful,” he says gruffly, “and call me as soon as you wrap up the hunt, ya hear me?”
“Indeed,” Cas blinked. He looked like he was a bit sleepy, something that felt really rare to think about. Still, Dean snuggled up to him, laying his head on top of Cas’ chest, drawing comfort from his steady heartbeat and thinking that he could get –maybe– used to this.
“Late enough that you should be in bed,” Cas sasses him and Dean almost smiles at it, but he’s too tired to process anything. Without warning, Cas reaches for him again, running his thumb down Dean’s right eye, over the dark skin of a nasty eyebag that must look designer. “You haven’t been sleeping.”
Claire is outspoken and bold, confident, and braver than any man Dean has met. Jack, younger and sweeter, is curious and full of questions, with an uncanny ability to perceive people’s feelings.
“Oh, no, you should take part in this conversation, Dean,” Anael says, “it’s just that…”
“Who?”
“Dean,” Cas says firmly, cradling Dean’s cheeks in his hands. “Look at me.”
“Morning sunshine,” Dean smiles, pouring some coffee for Cas into the biggest mug he found. Cas grumbles, taking a seat at the kitchen nook, and accepting his coffee with an unintelligible noise.
By the time he’s out of the shower, properly dressed, properly medicated, and feeling more like a human being, Cas steps into the room holding some takeout bags, looking like Dean’s guardian angel.
,” Dean sobs when Cas pulls his fingers out of him, only to go utterly quiet when the tip of Cas’ cock brushes against his rim. He loops up to Cas’ eyes, so darkened by want and desire, and grabs onto the sheets as Cas pushes in slowly until he’s buried to the hilt.
“Just good?” Dean huffs, annoyed. Cas tugs at his hair, forcing him to look up at him.
Probably not, it was a pretty crappy gift and Cas liked a different type of music, anyway.
“It’s--
Cas nods, and it looks like he’s going to reach for Dean for a second, but then he’s back to his stiff posture. “It’s for your own safety, Dean. You don’t know Michael, and you can’t imagine how dangerous this could be. I should be able to handle this without getting you into this mess.”
Cas frowns. “There aren’t any popsicle stands here.”
“I’m okay, now,” Dean says, as he keeps petting Cas’ bedhead. “Thanks, Cas.”
, Anael…”
“Yeah,” Dean looks down, swallowing past the lump stuck in his throat. “Honestly, Cas, sometimes I think…”
Dean does as told, still trying to catch his breath, hands, and knees on the bed, listening as Cas grumbles and fumbles around for the lube. Heart beating wildly inside his chest. He knows he’s putting himself in a vulnerable position, but Dean’s never had the best judgment whenever he feels so intensely for someone. It’s like he’s hard wired to crash and burn.
“Right,” Dean spits. “Like you thought of the end goal when you ran away.”
Uncomfortable, Dean opened his big damn mouth. “You show those to any asshole?”
Dean tries to imagine how things could have been different if he hadn’t been raised in the hunting lifestyle and come to know it only as an adult. As the victim of one of the kinds of cases he and his dad worked, someone who witnessed something so crazy and evil that they would have to question all their beliefs.
“I’m done running,” Cas says, unhappy lines on his face. “When I saw that bloody beehive mural… That’s the symbol of our community. Michael was the one who tasked me with looking after the bees. I knew it was a message, and I— panicked. But people are in danger, and I’m willing to do something now.”
Man, he’s so out of shape it’s not even funny anymore.
“I’ve never wanted anyone more than I want you, Dean,” Cas says, eyes earnestly sincere, and Dean launches himself at himself, straddling his lap to kiss him senseless, until their lips are swollen and red and the air between them grows short. He nuzzles his cheek against Cas’, content to finally express his affection for him, dizzy with the exuberant energy that comes with love.
So. It’s like that, then.
“Thanks, bud,” Dean clenches his teeth, stepping away from Michael. “Do you mind? I have personal space issues. Really bad ones, you’re kind of ruining my vibe here.”
Their time blends together enough for Dean to stop counting each month, for him to settle into this new life that he’s accidentally acquired since he made Cas a humble proposition. Dean’s hungry for every bit of information about Cas that he can get, craves every moment they spend at a bar after a hunt, waiting for the buzz of alcohol to loosen Cas’ stoic mask of self-control. But, surprisingly, it’s only after sex that Cas ever feels the desire to open up about himself.
“You should get some rest, Cas,” he says softly, laying his head on the pillow and closing his own eyes. Cas makes a low humming noise and then his breathing slows, not long until he’s fast asleep. Only then does Dean lay his forehead next to Cas’ shoulder, slowly, like Cas is a wild animal that Dean will startle if he moves too fast." to show how precarious this moment is. The bed is too small for two adult men their size, it’s way too cold outside, and Dean’s never liked large distances between warm bodies anyway.
“Only good things, I suppose!”
They’ve got a lot to do.
“I don’t think I follow.”
“Hey, yourself,” Dean smiles, looking every inch the idiot in love that he is. “Ready to blow this popsicle stand?”
“You want them to be happy,” Dean concludes for him. He hates how defeated Castiel looks and he reaches for his hand on impulse, unable to stand the idea of his prince beating himself up, wanting to offer comfort.
Dean feels that lightness soar within his own chest, the fluttering in his stomach getting more intense every time he looks at Cas
“Thanks,” Dean smiles through gritted teeth, unnerved by Michael’s wandering gaze. “Anyway, I’m stealing my husband away now. He promised to have lunch with me and I’m not myself when I’m hungry. Have a nice day!” He grabs Cas’ hand and drags him out of the library, trying not to seem too obvious. That was uncomfortable as fuck.
“And the bees,” Michael says, with a smirk. “Don’t forget the bees.”
“I think…” Cas starts, then appears to stop himself. The frown marring his face softens, and he abandons his chair to walk up to Dean and guide him into the loveseat in the corner of the room, with a hand on Dean’s lower back.
“I don’t feel like I’ve got this, Dean.”
“I- Look, I’ve been here for two days,” Dean tries, but Cas is gathering his knife and trying to walk past him, dismissing him.
Cas snorts, but relaxes considerably. “It sounds so easy when you put it like that.”
(again) in his shitty motel room, feeling kind of deflated, his shitty phone discarded at someplace near the end of the bed. Dean tried to call his dad that morning, maybe to see if he was willing to provide some backup for his hunt, but he never answered and Dean gave up after the third attempt.  He then considers calling Sam, not to ask for his help, just… to vent. But it’s always been impossible to talk about dad with Sam without getting into a full-blown argument that leaves Dean feeling raw and, besides, the risk of calling Sam and getting rejected is too big, and not what Dean needs at this moment.
“A cult,” Dean blinks.
found his prostate, Dean knew it was about time to get to the main act. He gently guided Cas’ hand away from him, then pushed him back so he was resting on his back in the middle of the bed. Dean threw a leg over him to straddle him, heart picking up when the head of Cas’ cock nestled between his ass cheeks.
“What do you need?” Dean asks, mind already made because he’s a fucking idiot.
to love Dean, not about loving Dean in reality, but it’s enough to rattle him into stillness. He makes the mistake of focusing on Cas’ too blue eyes and taking in the pleading look on his face.
. “Cas,” he croaks, finally engulfing Cas into a tight, trembling hug. “It’s you,” Dean whispers, full of awe. “How?”
“Well,” Cas says, looking grim and exhausted. “That’s why we’re here, Dean.”
Dean’s known them for less than a year, but he loves them already. He’s spent more time with them than with his husband and so, he’s been able to get to know them better.
Especially after solving a particularly annoying case. Like a salt’ n’ burn, which Cas hates because he despises desecrating graves and he despises
Dean grinds against Cas’ body, nails digging into the skin of his shoulders, hungry kisses that turn messy and open-mouthed, just them breathing together. Every time Cas touches his prostate, Dean’s thighs quiver violently, and he begs for more between stuttered breaths and loud moans.
“Good,” Dean grins at her. “Trust me, us older brothers always want to know everything. You’ll make Cas happy. You know how he gets when he worries.”
“You’re not making any sense,” Dean says, starting to feel anxious. “Cas,
He remained friends with his former wife, and gave her a sizable castle in the Southlands, completely staffed, knowing that she’d be a good lady to the people who lived there. Many people talk about how, as soon as Lady Kelly moved out of the royal home and finally had time and space to pursue the things she loved, she went from being a quiet, shy presence, to a very happy and animated woman. The children visit her every summer, and she writes to them every month.
“You were just… you were just going to go.”
There’s another long, awkward silence. God, Dean misses the way they used to talk.
His nose is runny and itchy and his throat feels weird, so he’s just going to assume that a cat wandered in during the night. His theory is proven right when he finally opens his eyes and sees a black cat looking cozy on Cas’ unused pillow.
“And we would’ve fucked it all up, Dean!” Cas snaps at him. “You can’t save every person. You need to think about our end goal.”
Dean could use some bacon. He could use all the fucking bacon, the greasier the better.
“You’re freaking destroying yourself, Cas.”
“Do you mean it, then?” Dean asks, suddenly brave, “Do you
“C’mon, Cas,” Dean dares to open his mouth again, the slightest nervous edge to his mouth. “Come back to bed, man.”
. It opens Dean’s eyes to a lot of new possibilities: did Cas know that Dean is a hunter too? Is there a meet-up spot for hunters near the town? Will Dean spot him again?
Dean ends the call with an exasperated sigh. “Okay. The blood of someone worthy. What do we need, a virgin?”
“God, you infuriating, stubborn man!” Dean lets out, in a fit of frustration, finally getting Cas to properly pay attention to him. “I just want to know
Dean was the only commoner who showed up, the Winchester title long lost to his dead father’s gambling debts, his younger brother spirited away to higher education in another country, with only a few years of kitchen work under his (admittedly, very unimpressive) belt.
“Right. Anyway,” Dean sighs, running a hand down his face. “You’ve got something to tell me?”
Sam frowns again. “I was hoping you’d help me with that today, actually.”
“Hey,” Cas soothes him, his voice hoarse from smoking, deep like gravel, “Chase those bad thoughts away. Keep them out.”
“Yeah,” Dean beams. “Guess I’ll need a repeat performance to feel truly impressed.”
Cas frowned at Dean.
“I need you to provide me with a motivation,” Cas finally uncrosses his arms, leaning forward on the table. “I
“She’s a nightmare,” Cas huffs.
Michael arches a perfectly skeptic eyebrow. “Why do you want to know?”
, Dean thinks as they make their way back to the Impala,
Instead, very maturely, Dean hunches his shoulders and grumbles, “Fuck you, you asshole,” and turns away from Cas, walking down the road back to town, shivering in the chill of the night as he tries to ignore the feeling of Cas’ eyes on his back.
He’s about to make a remark about it when Cas sits on the bed, looking dejected and sad with his shoulders slumped. They came to this place all battle-ready, Dean realizes. Cas was expecting a confrontation that never came and now he has to keep up appearances and pretend that he’s going to be what Michael wants him to be. That can’t be easy.
He can’t get his hopes up. He wouldn’t survive it.
“Room,” Cas grunts, and fuck, Dean’s never been carried so easily by another dude before. It’s everything he’s ever fantasized about when he thinks about Cas.
“What made you think that I didn’t like you?” Cas asks, arms tight around Dean’s waist.
“Jack and Claire… they have everything they could ever need and yet, for a while, they weren’t happy,” Cas explains, shoulders slumped. He looks tired. “Their mother wasn’t happy either. I’m aware of the amount of privilege and riches that we do possess, but this sort of life… it’s stifling. My mother says that duty comes before happiness, but…”
Castiel arches one severe, perfect eyebrow.
“Dean… I don’t think Michael was lying about your soul. I think he covets it, precisely because it’s so bright and good. Because you’re someone
“I can give you a minute,” he offers, thinking that they may need some privacy. Dean can’t help but put himself in Cas’ place and think about Sam. It would have killed Dean to leave him behind.
“Utah.”
(And those are the most dangerous moments, too. The moments where Dean forgets himself and plays footsie with Cas under the table, knowing that no one is there to look at them, that they don’t have to pretend to be in love. Dean’s always left feeling hollow, afterward, trying to put himself back together, putting a lid on whatever crazy idea he gets of Cas feeling the same as him.)
He still doesn’t know why Castiel picked him. At first, Dean thought that maybe the prince had been drawn to the way he looked, but once he ignored Dean on their wedding night, he quickly discarded that idea. It couldn’t be. Castiel didn’t care about Dean that way.
“Let’s go home,” he croaks, voice hoarse with disuse, digging for his car keys in his pocket. He throws them at Sam and makes sure that Jack is safely tucked in the crook of his arm before walking towards the Impala.
“Shut up, you loser,” Dean groans. “Don’t ruin the sexy post-coital mood.”
Sam has all but washed his hands of the terrifying mission of raising a newborn since he never has actually interacted with a baby for more than five seconds. It’s fine, Dean knows that his brother still has high hopes when it comes to getting Mary back, and Dean isn’t interested in bursting his bubble: as long as Sam is occupied, he will leave him alone.
Michael arches one douchey eyebrow at him. “Of course. We’re going to find a way for you to give back to this community, so you can earn everyone’s forgiveness. And I’m going to do something I should have done much, much earlier.”
. Look, dude,” Dean fiddles with his glass, shying away from Cas’ beautiful blue eyes. “I'm just... you're making me kinda nervous. And you're really hot.”
Cas grimaces. “I know, but I need to explain this to you… I want to go back home. To the cult. My sister is there.”
“Yes, sir.”
“Peachy,” he lies. Like a liar. “Yeah. Good. I’ve been doing good. Busy, y’know.”
A weird, kind of fucked up fantasy where they did normal shit during the day and hunted monsters at night, but it was all Dean could have ever asked for after his own family was so quick to dump him.
“You’re an adult, Cas,” Dean frowns.
“I’m not beating myself up,” Cas grumbled, air quotes and all. At least he was still himself.
Cas takes that as a chance to kiss lower, mouthing at Dean’s neck in a way that sends tingles down his spine. “Asleep in my room, my grace will sense it when he wakes.”
“Brothers and sisters of Angel Valley,” Michael’s booming voice distracts Dean from his own thoughts. He’s standing in front of the path that leads to the forest, Muriel by his side. Her pretty white dress makes her look like a bride, with her grey hair down in waves. She looks so happy it hurts to look at her. “Father has called for our dear sister Muriel, and she, like any upstanding member of our community, has decided to answer his call. Muriel will now be reunited with her husband and daughter in Heaven, achieving the eternal peace she rightfully deserves. Rejoice! Do not miss her! You will see her again!”
“And Michael said that he’s never seen a soul as bright as yours.”
“Gotcha, I saw some of those bad boys on the edge of the forest. Anything else?”
He falls, legs feeling like jello. He ends up on his knees again, breathing harshly, his head resting on Cas’ leg, sweaty and covered in come. For a second, there are hesitant fingers carding through his hair, but they’re gone in a blink.
Cas answers, followed by an awkward pause.
On an impulse decision, Dean grabs his hand and squeezes it in his own, trying to provide silent support. Cas sends him a grateful look.
Dean fell asleep to the familiar, but rare comfort of arms around him.
“Hmmm,” Dean hums as he works, a particular thing she’s said keeps getting stuck in his mind. “What do you mean there’s fewer people?”
“Okay. I’ll be seeing you two tonight. Behave until then,” she smiles one last time before leaving, closing the door with a soft click.
But as much as Dean appreciates Claire and Jack’s company and the constant stream of chatter that they usually offer, he also loves the quiet moments that he reserves for himself, too. The gardens are full of life and color, even in the dark of the night, and Dean loves to sit between the flowers and look at the stars, wondering if this is all he’s going to get, if this is the pinnacle of his happiness, if this life and
. Dean wants to say
“Yes,” she huffs, a grumpy scowl on her face. “My grandson promised to do it for me, but he didn’t show up. I know he’s been busy, but some warning would’ve been nice.”
“Well, that doesn’t sound like the mafia at all,” Dean jokes, but Cas doesn’t laugh. He walks past Dean and towards the house without another word, looking determined and tense. Dean follows after, grumbling about carrying their bags.
there. Dean rubbed the same exact spot a couple of times until Cas was groaning, his mouth buried against Dean’s neck, and then his terrifyingly black wings were flickering to life only to disappear a few seconds later, just like the room’s light bulb earlier. But it was enough for Dean to think about the shape of them and the sheer power they radiated.
“Well,” Dean smiled, still trying to recover his breath. “That was something else.”
He presses a kiss to Cas’ hair, which makes him straighten up and look at Dean with an adorably confused stare. Heart beating fast, Dean leans in for a kiss, and when Cas doesn’t object to it, Dean slides his tongue right in, licking into Cas’ hot mouth.
“Cas,” Dean cradles Cas’ head in his hands. “Cas, I need you. I need you so goddamn much.”
“Me too,” Dean smiles, relieved. “You don’t have to be so serious about that, you weirdo,” he teases him, but Cas does the annoyed-squinty thing he does every time Dean is being cheeky, and then leans in to press a kiss to Dean’s cheek.
Cas makes a humming noise before raising his eyes to look at Dean, looking unbearably soft.
“I don’t know,” Dean answers truthfully. “I was being serious when I said that this is all I’ve ever known.”
“Oh, Dean,” Cas takes the chair next to Dean and sits, gently resting a hand on Dean’s arm, trying to get him to look at him. “I’m here now. I won’t be leaving again.”
him. “Fuck, okay, okay. C’mere, on top of me—yeah, like that. Let me unzip your pants.”
“Not religious fanatics. A religious fanatic, I’m afraid. My parents are dead, and the task of raising me fell upon Michael, the leader of our blessed community. And my brother.”
just twelve hours before.
Clumsily, he got Cas’ cock out of his pants, taking a moment to admire the bead of precome on the tip, spreading it with his thumb all over the rest of his cock. Cas hung his head low, moaning and rolling his hips, arms shaking with the effort to keep him up.
He wonders if John Winchester would have believed Michael’s lies when offered the promise of seeing his wife again and spending eternity with her. If he’d have walked into the forest, tears of joy on his face, ready to be happy again.
He goes back to sleeping his usual four hours, sometimes not sleeping at all, when he falls asleep in the middle of the library during a particularly long and frustrating bout of research, his arms on the table and his head pillowed on top of them. He’s shaken awake by a soft touch on his right shoulder, right where Cas’ handprint used to be, and he leans into it for a second before awareness comes back to him and his brain decides to come online.
“Is your name on it?” Cas points out mockingly, looking unbearably handsome with his hair all mussed up and still flushed with exertion, a bruise blooming on top of a perfect cheekbone.
“I promise.”
Beneath Cas’ chest, beneath his flesh and ribs, right in the powerful beating of his heart, Dean’s finally found a home.
“Morning, sunshine,” Dean says with added cheer, “you don’t exactly look like a morning person.”
Cas is still covering his face when he answers. “I’m… I feel less anxious. But I’m nervous. And you know what’s funny?”
“What time issit?” Dean mumbles, stretching his sore muscles slightly.
“Yeah,” Dean says, unable to conceal how much he
Dean closes his eyes, too emotional to say anything intelligent. “You can’t say shit like that to me.”
There’s an old lady standing in front of one of the cabins, frowning at her front steps with a grumpy face. If things could be fixed by sheer determination and the power of annoyance, she’d have already solved her problem. One of the steps has a small hole in it, Dean notices, and a humble case of tools rests next to the lady’s feet.
“You love this so much,” Cas breathes, sounding incredibly awed. “I can’t believe how much you love it. How responsive you are. The way you squeeze my fingers…”
“Likewise,” Dean grunts. Cas picks up his weapon, dusting off his pants with his now clean hands. He walks up to Dean, stopping at an uncomfortably close distance.
The rest of their dinner is silent, thick with tension and unanswered questions, both of them looking equally lost in thought. Once they’re done, Cas insists on washing the dishes before going out to meet Anael and Ruby, and Dean figures that Cas could use the alone time to compose himself before seeing his sister again.
He turns away from the sight of Cas and decides to wait for him outside of the barn instead. It’s starting to get chillier and he’s only wearing a t-shirt and a canvas jacket, but Dean doesn’t think this conversation can wait.
Cas’ packed duffel lays there on the floor, ready to go. Dean’s back turns cold.
. Which is why he almost loses it when he gets to the vamp nest and catches Cas beheading the last vampire.
“Oh. That. Yes, Dean, I’ve been ready for hours, but my sister insisted on packing us as many snacks as she could.”
“Hiya, dwarfs,” Dean puts his hands on his hips, trying to hold back a smile. “How about you ask me to go outside the next time before you sneak out of the castle, hm?”
Cas doesn’t owe him anything. No promises were ever made. No labels exist between them, and if they happen to exclusively sleep with each other, well, that’s a matter of convenience.
Once Dean can no longer hear his footsteps,
“Only you, Castiel, tell the sister that you haven’t seen in almost two years that she’s wasting your time,” she rolls her eyes, and this time, Cas actually looks remorseful. Dean feels for him, knowing that he never meant to leave her behind.
. He prays
“Holy fucking shit—” Dean moans, so loud the people renting the room next to theirs probably heard it, too. Cas pushes his tongue inside, then pulls back, fucking into Dean slowly, calmly taking Dean apart.
“You promise?”
“Thanks,” Dean sulks, trying not to let it get to him. The rejection was so abrupt and fast that he’s left reeling, almost dizzy with whiplash.
“How…” Dean tries to ask, but he gets stuck. “This was my hunt,” he says instead.
“Nervous?” Dean tried, chuckling when the prince frantically nodded his response. “It’s okay to be nervous. I always laugh at the stories my uncle and aunt tell me about my parents’ marriage. They were nervous, too,” Dean smiled wistfully. “They are long gone now, but I still remember how much they loved each other.”
The rest of their clothes are quickly discarded until Dean needs to climb out of Cas’ lap to remove his boots and his pants. Once properly naked, Cas pushes Dean onto the bed, crawling over him, never looking away from him. He rests a palm on Dean’s cheek and Dean leans into the touch, eyes fluttering closed.
“Of course, you silly boy. Where else?”
This time, Dean’s
The room Cas books has two beds in it, divided by a nightstand and a lamp. Cas dumps his duffel between the beds and disappears to the bathroom, closing the door with a soft click.
“What are you doing?” Claire’s sleepy voice, followed by a yawn, interrupts him.
“Dean,” Cas says, voice sharp. “You’re his parent, too. You’ve been taking care of him since the day he was born.”
Prince Castiel’s face softened with the fondness of someone who was, indeed, very in love, and for a moment, Dean felt a stab of jealousy for the future princess. Dean always found the prince to be handsome and sweet.
He only snapped out of it when Cas laid a gentle hand on his shoulder. “Dean, it’s time.”
“How was I supposed to know that you’d traumatize that poor stripper?” Dean huffed, not even making an effort to move away from Cas.
“We were supposed to run away together. Her, her girlfriend, and me. But Anael ended up staying behind… our plan didn’t work. Ruby was found retrieving their backpack from Anael’s room, and we were going to get caught, so Anael stayed behind to help her. And I ran,” Cas confesses, face pinching with what Dean recognizes as the crushing weight of guilt.
“Thank you,” Cas whispers, suddenly looking sad, his fingers tracing Dean’s cheekbone. “I mean it.”
He can’t see enough of Cas’ face in the dark, only the shine of his eyes.
Dean blinks. Cas’ eyes are very, very blue if a little foggy. Then, he leans in for a kiss, soft lips sliding against Dean’s down, slow and confident. Cas lets go of his face so he can grab the back of Dean’s head, tugging at his hair, slipping his tongue between Dean’s lips. God, Dean’s never been
Cas leaves the bathroom with his hair wet, barefoot and looking cold with only a towel around his waist. “I need to go get my things before I miss the check out at my motel and everything gets thrown out,” he says. Wrapped only in the towel, his toned muscles wet and glistening, Dean needs to blink a couple of times before anything that Cas has said registers in his brain.
“C’mon, move it,” Dean pat Cas’ chest, once his arm started to fall asleep. “Let’s move this to a real bed.”
“I swear I can explain.”
A familiar sense of disappointment starts to choke him, the same from his lonely wedding night, and he picks up his clothes from the floor, angrily getting dressed before he abandons Cas’ room. He hopes to see him at breakfast but once Dean goes to the dining room, Cas isn’t at the table. He’s nowhere to be found.
“We should clean up,” Cas says, interrupting Dean’s awesome post-coital mood.
“Cas, you’re only human. I’m sorry about what I said the other night, I shouldn’t have lashed out at you like that, man.”
“Like me?”
“What are you doing here?”
He needs it, suddenly, needs Cas' hands and lips against his own, needs the pressure to keep his mind
Not a word comes out of Cas, just a small and pleased humming noise. Next thing they know, Dean is being pressed into the mattress and Cas is nudging a thick thigh between Dean’s legs, pressing him against the bed. There’s still tension in him, his back is stiff and his kisses feel a little bit off, but Dean lets him take charge. He runs a hand up and down Cas’ wide back, nosing at his jaw gently. “Just relax,” Dean whispers.
“I don’t get why you’re so annoyed,” Cas squints, his shoulders already beginning to relax as the smell of weed fills the air. “It’s not like we’re getting
“Fine,” Cas bites out. “But we should make a few stops before we get there. I don’t want to rush out.”
And then… Arizona happened, and now Dean is back to solo hunting and trying really hard not to lose a limb while wrestling to stab a werewolf or fall down the stairs while getting chased by a shapeshifter. At one point, he even considers calling Bobby, but it’s been years since the last time they talked, and Dean doesn’t know if he has any right to call him just to ask for help. Things would be easier if he could just put up a post on Craigslist: “WANTED: HUNTING PARTNER. NO, NOT THAT SORT OF HUNTING.”
His legs fall open when Cas touches his hips, kisses the softness of his tummy. “I love this part of you,” Cas says, amused, just to see Dean flush with embarrassment, probably. The fucker.
, help me understand why—I know you want Mom back. And I know you want Cas back, too,” Sam pleads, eyes big and watery and looking too pitiful. And Dean feels like he’s about to win the Shittiest Brother Award because he can’t deal with that bullshit.
“Sure, dude,” he nods. “And after that?” Dean asks, still waiting for Cas’ answer to his offer.
“Cas, you didn’t really tell me a lot.”
“Dean,” he says, looking terrified. “We need to talk.”
“Hn,” Dean grunts in response. Jack woke him up from a nightmare at least twice during the night, and he’s starting to suspect that the kid can sense them, from the number of times that Jack’s pulled him out of them. Still, he’s dead on his feet and ready to pass out, like every day since they lost Cas and Mary.
Silently, slowly, as his eyelids drag with the weight of exhaustion and Dean surrenders to the buzz of alcohol, he finds his way back to his old way of living and his former self: the one who never looked forward to the next day.
“Anael,” Cas warns.
“Hello?”
“Fucking cats,” Dean grumbles before sneezing loudly. She seems to hear him, by the way her ears flicker, then she rolls on her back, exposing her belly and throwing a wide-eyed look at him.
“Castiel,” comes a smug voice. A tall dude is walking towards them, crossing the gates. He’s tall, almost as tall as Cas and Dean are, with dark hair, tanned skin, and blue eyes that manage to look smarmy instead of earnest, like Cas’ own.
“Castiel,” Michael smiles, all teeth and charisma. Dean hates it. “Hard at work, I see. That’s good, you’ve always been very dedicated.”
There are eggs and cheese in the fridge, along with some other basic items and an assortment of random groceries in the pantry. Dean picks the first items and gets to work, pretty sure that he can make something decent. By the time Cas comes in, looking half-dead on his feet, hair sticking up everywhere, Dean’s finished with the eggs and has just prepared a fresh pot of coffee.
“Dean.”
The fog lifts and his limbs still feel weak, a vague, dark cloud remaining at the back of his mind, but he’s also panting into the kiss, pressing himself against Cas’ body with the hope that Cas will choose to give Dean
, Dean thinks, before trying to back away, nails digging into the soil, gun still clutched tightly in one hand. A loud noise distracts the wolves, and Dean doesn’t have enough time to try to figure out what it is before he’s tackling the werewolf over him and wrestling with him against the ground, heart pumping wildly with adrenaline. A loud bang rings out again: it’s the sound of a gunshot, and by the time Dean is able to shoot the wolf he’s been struggling with, he’s quick to focus on the source of the noise.
Dean comes with a punched out moan, clenching so tight and so viciously around Cas, that he follows soon after, dropping like a particularly heavy sack of potato on top of Dean’s body. His legs are still holding him up, somehow, and Dean stays very still for a moment, trying to get his brain online.
“C’mere, big guy,” Dean beckons him with a breathless smile. “Not gonna break, you can give me your all.”
“Where are you even going, Cas,” Dean insists, trying his hardest to contain his anger. “Were you even going to say goodbye?”
is something Michael has been preaching about since before I was born. I used to believe in it. I believed in
But his silence gives everything Cas wanted to torture himself more. “I thought,” he says, the smile on his face bitter and sad.
They sit on the floor, right next to bed, closing the window after Dean is finished checking for any sneaky stray cats. Once it’s obvious they’re completely alone, Cas starts talking.
. The phantom pain in his jaw, the cold chill of memories he hates dissipate with every moment that Cas makes Dean focus on him, and he wants it-- no,
“You do it,” Dean answers, snuggling into Cas’ side. “I’m not getting up ever again. You fucked me stupid.”
“You sure are in a better mood today,” Dean grumbles, going to sit next to him on the couch, nudging Cas’ leg with his knee. “You were pretty pissy yesterday.”
“I’m Dean,” he smiles his best charming smile, trying to look as harmless as possible. “I’m your brother’s husband.”
He rests his hands on top of Cas’ hairy thighs, just running his hands over them, feeling the warmth of his skin. Cas’ breathing seems to stutter when Dean leans down to kiss the tip of his cock, and Dean looks up at him with a smirk. “Blast from the past, uh?”
“Says who,” Dean snorts, also pouring himself a cup of coffee. He wants to mention that Cas looks pretty grumpy for someone who got a really good blowjob last night but refrains from doing so. They haven’t talked about the whole… sleeping-together-again thing, and Dean isn’t sure if he should be the one to bring it up. Still, there’s something about how soft Cas looks in the mornings… how sweet he is when he’s grumpy and sleep-rumpled… it forces Dean to entertain the possibility of asking Cas if maybe, after this entire mess is over, they could try to go back to what they were (or maybe, become something
. They really didn’t think this through, huh.
“No, not until it’s your time, too. I’ve been looking forward to it, personally,” she whispers, looking softer, even sounding awed. “I can’t wait to see my husband again. He was called five years ago. Michael guided him to the forest after we said our goodbyes. He was wearing his favorite tunic, the one I sewed for him before our wedding.”
“Is this why you haven’t been sleeping?”
Dean flushes, caught a little off guard by the sentiment, clearing his throat once he recovers. “Anyway, what were you saying about...?”
“You sure this is going to work?” Dean asks, taking a moment to pull himself together.
Numb and surrounded by a deafening silence, Dean goes back to the cabin.
Spit dribbles down his chin, Cas choking him on his cock and barely allowing time to breathe. Dean makes a pitiful humming noise, almost overwhelmed by how good it feels to be used like that, eyes locking again with Cas.
“Well, Muriel. You won’t need your lazy grandson’s services anymore.”
“I mean, it’s obvious that your brother’s got everyone here duped, but… what the hell is he doing with these people? Because, yeah, I’m not buying that corny nonsense of going to heaven to play the harp among fluffy clouds.”
“My back.”
“Not really,” Cas shrugs. “Just wanted to say goodbye. And wish you better luck next time,” Cas grins, looking proud of his achievement. Hell, he’s faster than the Flash when it comes to hunting, Dean will give him that.
Cas hums his acknowledgment and soon enough Dean is out of the room, wearing a blue sweater under his jacket that he stole from Cas, because Dean has been known to be a petty bastard when he wants to be.
When he opened his eyes in the morning, Cas was gone.
“Or something,” Muriel snorts, crossing her arms over her chest. “We’ve got fewer people than ever before and barely any new people showing up. Michael’s been running us ragged. It’s hard work and I don’t want to complain, don’t get me wrong, but this is exhausting.”
, Lee had bled on the floor, fast. Dean had made it quick for him, almost tender. He had made it quick for Benny too, because Dean’s a killer with a swollen heart that spills out of his ribcage and leaks everywhere, making a mess, disaster in its wake until he closes his eyes and he’s too afraid of opening them, too afraid to look and find Cas’s body there lying on the ground, joining the others in the big pyre of waste lit by Dean’s love.
Cas takes mercy on him. “You did good,” he says, pressing a quick kiss to Dean’s knee, lowering his legs to grab the lube. Cas quickly slicks his fingers, laughing when he catches Dean looking at him.
about Cas, something that Dean wants to see more of. They’re well-matched, he thinks, and letting Cas go would be a waste. Dean can make all the jokes and brag all he wants about his skills being enough to hunt by himself, but the thing is that he doesn’t
“Hello, Dean,” Cas’ mouth twitches. He’s holding back a smile.
“Training you, Castiel,” Michael says, very matter of fact, “training you as my right-hand man.”
“Okay,” Dean sighs, leaning back in his seat, feeling even more exhausted. “Just gotta play happy families, I guess.”
“I saw you through the window and thought it would be a good chance to talk to you alone,” Castiel says, turning earnest eyes on him. “I wanted to say thank you.”
Yeah, it’s not his most brilliant plan.
Cas carries him all the way to Dean’s room. He closes the door with his foot and then dumps Dean on the bed, immediately crawling over him.
“I could never.” Cas smiles, raising a hand to touch Dean’s cheek, softly thumbing at his cheekbone. “I saw myself as a drunk who took advantage of you, but now I know that things were different. I should have stayed and talked to you.”
“You going to bed?”
“I admire your dedication, Dean. I’ve heard very nice things about you,” Michael hums serenely and lowers his eyes a little, still looking at Dean. “Cas was right to bring you here, you’re a very bright soul and a great addition to our community. I look forward to seeing more of you.”
“Dude,” Dean calls out to him, “what are you doing?”
playing in the background. Dean remembers well the feeling of floating on top of a cloud, hot lips touching his own softly but gently.
“Hello, Dean.”
Dean snorted. “Someone’s horny.”
Oh, Dean thinks angrily,
“That’s why—that’s why I can see your wings,” Dean gulped, too overcome with feeling to come up with anything more clever. He snapped out of it once he noticed that Cas’ face was still marred with misery, and he grabbed him by the arms. “Cas—listen to me, okay? We’ll find a way to fix this, we’ll get you as good as new, yeah, but. This doesn’t mean you’re useless—you’d never be useless, buddy. Way too much of a badass.”
He didn’t come home last night.
, and this wonderful idea that here, in this valley, hid the last sons of God, waiting for our Father’s call to spread our wings, become angels and join him in eternal peace.”
When they open the barn doors, Dean expects a monster ready to pounce, but nothing of the sort happens. Instead, he hears Cas’ gasp next to him, as they stare at the barn walls. Right in the center, there's a massive beehive drawn in dark red lines. Dean realizes it’s dried blood, more appropriate for an inverted pentagram instead. Dean doesn’t know what it means and whatever question he has dies in his throat when he sees how pale Cas has gone.
“No blood. Light. Eating… Oh, shit. Shit shit shit fuck.”
and desire to destroy and poison that Lucifer possessed.
He’s got his machete ready, just waiting for night to fall, watching
, 1879. But the most important thing is--
he can use and finds a bible. He throws it at Michael’s head, then grabs the stake and stabs Michael in the back, right where his heart is. Michael releases a loud, nightmarish screech and transforms into a cloud of ashes, leaving Cas and Dean to stare at each other in the middle of the trashy office.
“Likewise,” Cas says, digging into his pockets until he pulls out a lighter and a small joint, lighting it up with a quick flick. The dim glow highlights the lines of his face and, for a small moment, Cas looks otherworldly. Almost ethereal.
Cas leaves the bathroom, the sound of his bare feet dragging Dean out of his thoughts. There are deep, dark shadows under his eyes and he looks like he hasn’t gotten any sleep in at least a month. Dean feels for him, because he keeps forgetting that he should be angry at Cas for dumping him as if he were yesterday’s news.
“I’ll be right back, buddy,” Dean leaves his room with his gun carefully raised, walking slowly, until he hears the noise again and hides in the hallway. There are footsteps that seem to come from the map table room, and he silently and slowly walks over there, ready to point his gun at whoever has been stupid enough to invade his home—
(Because Cas did, didn’t he? He didn’t hesitate. Dean bared himself to him, gave himself to him that night. And the next morning Cas was all packed and ready to go. He wasn’t even going to say goodbye.)
“Well,” Dean grabs a rolling pin and puts it in her hands. “Do you feel like making a mess right now?”
Well, the answer starts with using Dean as bait. Cas doesn’t seem to agree with this part of the plan, but it’s all they’ve got at the moment. Once they get their stake ready, they wait another day so they can avoid looking suspicious, and then Cas sneaks Dean into Michael’s study late at night, where Dean will play the role of tasty snack. He guesses.
“Why?” Before he can ask again, Cas removes his hand from Dean’s arm and cradles his face gently, forcing him to look at him.
“Yes,” Dean smiled, letting go of the prince’s hands. The prince smiled back at him, blue eyes gentle with gratefulness.
“Too royal for cooking?”
There’s a knock on the door that abruptly pulls Dean out of his ridiculous headspace, and Cas immediately starts looking more awake. “Stay there,” Cas says carefully going to the door. Dean has a kitchen knife right next to him.
. And when you told me about that, I thought that meant that we were going to do something about that. Together.”
. But he’s a weak ass coward, and he’s about to play Fake Husbands with Cas, so he takes the olive branch he’s being offered.
Dean whines. “Cas,
, Cas practically whines. “I’ve had a long day, don’t you dare tease me.”
Cas says, immediately sounding relieved.
“He… I ran,” Cas starts explaining, but he doesn’t look like he’s completely present. “I ran away. From our home.”
Cas doesn’t look as desperate to run away from the bad weather as he is, and Dean wonders again about the place he grew up in. He’s loading the guns into the trunk when Cas comes back from a coffee run with a warm drink for Dean and a brown paper bag that probably contains their breakfast.
Cas makes him come a second time, pulling him apart just with his fingers. Dean beckons for him to get closer, content to have Cas right next to him on the bed, so he can lay his head on Cas’ strong chest, run a hand up and down Cas’ firm stomach, pet his jutting hip bones softly.
“Y’know…” Dean started, resting his head on his hand, heart beating way too fast to be normal. “I could help you. With the virgin thing.”
Dean drops his head on the bed again, eyes clenched shut with the effort not to come. “Cas. Cas, I need you,” he babbles, an old mantra that slips out whenever Cas touches him. Whenever Cas lights him up inside, not even aware of what he’s really doing to him by taking him apart and pulling him back together with his own hands. The press of Cas’ cockhead against his hole feels like freedom. Cas pushes inside in one single motion, one firm stroke that pulls a visceral, punched-out noise out of Dean’s lungs, the air completely stolen from them.
“You could never do that to me,” Dean says, heart beating faster. He doesn’t dare to hope, not yet, but he can’t help it. He just
“Gotcha,” Dean replies, effectively letting the conversation die. He wishes talking to Cas were easier, but their nerves are clearly sabotaging them. Dean barely sleeps that night, contemplating all the possibilities, all the things that could go wrong. During a moment of vulnerability, he spares a thought for Sam, and wrestles against the desire to call him just to hear his voice. Sam hasn’t been answering his phone, something that Dean suspected would happen when John told him to stay gone. Not that Dean’s drunk and whiny voicemails helped his case, but he wishes…
“Yeah…”
“I can’t,” Cas grabs a plume very pointedly, signaling a pile of documents with it. “I’m busy.”
Then again, not everyone gets their lessons from John Winchester.
More kisses follow the first one, open-mouthed and sweet, clumsy with alcohol. They kiss and kiss until Cas opens the door and pulls Dean inside the room with him, then gently guides him to the bed. Dean lays down on it, flat on his back, with Cas on top of him, a thick thigh nudging his legs apart. He lets his husband unlace his pants and kick off his clothes, lets him do whatever he wants to him.
“You’re not that talented, Cas.”
“Michael said that I had a bright soul. Soul. He said he could see
Dean’s married to a prince now.
Dean freezes, a cold, heavy feeling nestling in his gut. Cas is talking about
Cas is gone, turned into ash, reduced to prayers that lead to nowhere, composed of all the things Dean was never brave enough to say. He prays
Cas’ rough voice is enough to make his heartbeat skyrocket and soon, dizzy and still sore, Dean moves clumsily into a sitting position.
“Your brother,” Dean repeats, because that’s all he can do right now. Repeat things stupidly. “And you ran away.”
“I haven’t spent years hiding in this mediocre body and waving crosses in front of fools only for you to ruin everything!” Michael temporarily stops chasing after Dean to throw himself at Cas, who loses the stake in his attempt to roll away from him. Michael straddles him. His nails grow into strong, menacing claws and he drags them over Cas’ chest.
He leaves the kitchen in a hurry, a bitter flavor in his mouth. Calling Jack “Satan’s kid” feels unfair, because he looks more and more like Cas with each day that passes.  With that painful thought in mind, he goes back to the room and puts the bottle on his bedside table, so he can get a still sleepy Jack out of his bassinet. He looks at Dean with drowsy, confused eyes, and burrows into his arms contentedly when Dean maneuvers him into the correct position. Dean feeds him quietly, occasionally humming some Zepp. Every time he catches himself humming
Cas walks over to him, doing a very poor job at hiding his laughter, offering Dean a hand to help him stand up. Dean grabs it and Cas pulls him towards him, so they end up standing so close that their chests are pressing together. Cas’ face is so close that Dean could kiss him if he wanted to, and he loses himself in Cas’ blue eyes.
Without noticing, Dean has started tracing circles on top of Cas’ thigh, just trying to be comforting. Cas seems to melt into his touch, resting his head on Dean's shoulder. Dean freezes but doesn’t make any sudden movements. He didn’t expect he’d get to be this close again to Cas, but he’s willing to be whatever Cas needs in order to survive this whole shitfest without losing his head.
“Yeah,” Cas snorts. “Only after I ran away like a coward for almost two years.”
“Y’know. Just passing by. Thought we could chat a little, wanted to know more about you. You’re my brother-in-law, after all.”
Dean’s always longing, and Cas is always leaving and theirs is a relationship made of ill-timed efforts and miscommunication, of breaking and entering into their feelings. Of Dean, waiting but never asking.
“I wanted to,” Dean shrugs, getting the food out of the oven. “I like cooking.”
“Your brother riding your ass too hard?” Dean asks, taking a seat right in front of him.
He runs his hands down Cas’ firm chest in wonder until Cas pushes him back so Dean’s laying on his back again. He sucks a bruise into Dean’s neck, then another near a nipple. He licks them and kisses them until they peak, until Dean’s arching his back and making embarrassing noises.
“I don’t care.”
“You and your brother have so much to lose, Dean,” Cas said, looking mournful and miserable, and Dean just felt the weird impulse to hug him. To soothe him out of his worries.
“You have no idea,” Cas whispers, gently resting his hand on Dean’s cheek for a moment. “You have no idea how much you mean to me, Dean.”
“I need to go, Dean,” Cas said, “I have a duty to fulfill, and Heaven is calling for me.”
Cas presses a kiss to Dean’s belly, humming. “I’ll give you whatever you want, Dean.”
“That’s Michael,” Cas whispers, pointing at the man standing front and center. “That’s
“I changed my mind. I decided to talk to Dean. He looked lonely.”
Dean is panting, tugging at Cas’ messy dark hair, clutching at the sheets with his other hand, scrambling to find the tube of lube he left under the pillow in a moment of feeling too hopeful.
Lee had said
“For what?” Dean asks.
“Dude…”
Caving to the need of an arranged marriage, but not wanting to end up with someone chosen by his mother once more, Castiel put the word out that he needed a new spouse, a partner willing to take care of and love his children.
He thinks he hears a small huffing sound.
Fuck, his neck hurts.
Cas pulled him into his arms, ignoring Dean’s incoherent babbling to help him get his shit together. For a moment, it seemed to work, and he laid his head on Cas’ shoulder, trying to pretend that he wasn’t living his very own worst nightmare. Suddenly, the world was moving way too fast around him, and he was too dizzy to be on his feet. He fell on his knees, puking on some idiot’s lawn, gagging until his eyes were watering again.
“Okay, I’m not going to complain about that,” Cas says, lowering his hand, barely touching Dean’s cheekbone. “I’m waiting,” Cas breathes, and it’s all the signal Dean needs to stare at his crotch, where Cas’ dick is currently thickening.
“True,” Dean snickers, giving her a friendly pat on her shoulder. “Go say goodbye to him while I make sure the car is ready.”
“Yes. We’re married, remember? It’s the proper way to do things,” Cas snorts, “Michael wants me to take on more responsibility, so he can train me to be his right-hand man.”
Dean, of course, proves those comments to be right by imbibing copious amounts of alcohol. By midnight, he’s pleasantly buzzed, cheeks flushed with alcohol, laughing and smiling (but never dancing, he still has some sense of self-preservation), obnoxiously encouraging Cas to drink more, refilling his cup and telling him to relax. By the look of it, he’s done a good job: Cas’ fluffy hair is messy, he looks pleasantly tipsy and he’s been smiling most of the night. When he starts feeling sleepy, he asks Dean to walk him to his room. They say their goodnights in front of Cas’ door, just like any other night.
“I thought we…” Dean swallows. “Why did you leave before I woke up? Why have you been avoiding me all day?”
