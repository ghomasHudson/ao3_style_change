and not after the show as planned, but Castiel’s hand rested gently on his jawline and she turned his face back towards her. Falling victim to her charm, he let her move his face, and gazed upon her again, swallowing the nervous lump in his throat.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Fine,” Castiel said through his teeth, sweeping away, the trenchcoat flapping behind him, letting a cool breeze into the layers of his suit.
“What the hell was that, Grace? Winchester? What’s going on in there?”
“I beg your pardon?” Baltazar whispered.
The physician whose name she couldn’t remember was fiddling with something, and then moved close, holding something under her nose. The sharp scent of ammonia sudden burned her nostrils and hit the back of her throat like tiny knives.
“They reject their gift! They choose not to love each other; they choose to suffer. I never knew what became of my targets. I always assumed they would follow their hearts, give in to God’s love, embrace His gift with open arms.” The cupid looked between Dean and Castiel, his eyes shining. “I never in my millennia of existence assumed humanity would turn from the gift. I never knew. I never knew until we all fell. The past few weeks have provided me an education I never asked for.”
Blue eyes watched his lips and she nodded. “Perhaps. You know I appreciate our talks, our time together… However I enjoy boundaries and you don’t have those, so—”
Cas looked equally nauseous, but he went on, hissing, “So we’ll take their grace and kill them, Dean. Then, we’ll retake Heaven  and once again we’ll take our up posts as protectors of humanity. No more in-fighting. No more war. Not from us, at least.”
He’d been chanting the summoning phrase for at least fifteen minutes, and his voice was starting to crack.
“He’s good now, I think,” Dean said with a clearing of his throat, and he gestured back out into the bedroom. “Didn’t smack his head off nothin’, so I think we’re good to give him a sec. Cas, you good?”
“Uh, it’s not a big deal,” Dean replied slowly, unnerved by this Professor-Snape-like creep calling someone an ‘omega’. While Dean wasn’t entirely sure what he meant, he could deduce from the man’s tone that he wasn’t using the alien term kindly.
hating Dean for that joke on so many levels. His body ached from the stomach-down, but the light feeling in his chest that accompanied the laughter was certainly welcome.
Dean jumped at the voice because he’d thought the closest souls in the courtyard were the small children playing hopscotch by the gates. He immediately felt a chill down his spine as Uriel, the security guard for Heaven, stepped out from the alcove on the other side of the doors, a cigarette between his fingers and a box of matches in his other hand.
Well, she glared somewhere past his shoulder. “I can’t see your face, but I’m sure you have that
Black eyes stared back.
Shoving the milk back in the fridge, Cas slammed the fridge door closed and turned sharply, snatching up the plastic Cars plate, and saying irately, “Yes, I take the bus. If that’s all you needed from me, show yourselves out.”
“I’m fairly talented one-on-one,” Castiel breathed, not at all knowing if that was true. His experience with men existed but only in brief. He’d done the basics with others and more...complicated acts with his left hand, but…
“There was no war,” Sam went on, changing the subject as they all became aware of how uncomfortable Castiel was getting. “There was no Michael versus Lucifer, so, uh, the world was kind of okay. At least immediately after. Other shit happened but, uh, there hasn’t been any apocalypse that we couldn’t stop.”
“Zachariah? Uriel?” Sam reeled back. “But those are angels, they—”
“Have you ever given birth?” Dean asked, forcing himself to keep his voice steady.
“I’d like to—” Dean said again, more firmly, raising his green eyes, shining in uncertainty, watching Castiel’s face. He gestured with the bottle between them. “I’ve just never, uh...y’know...”
He inhaled the scent of smoke, of cheap beer, of the familiar individual smells of his family. Just in case it would be taken away from him somehow.
Once the stage was empty and the bar lights turned on, they filed out of the club with the horde of other attendees, and the fact that Dean’s fingers were still linked with his so that they “wouldn’t lose each other” was the only consolation.
“Pam?” Bobby asked, raising his brows. He handed her the piece of paper. “You up for it?”
“Start now then,” Dean said, trying with everything in him to sound nonchalant. “‘Cause Cas chose a remote as fuck house and there won’t be a Taco Bell for another forty minutes.”
“Fuck,” Dean muttered from his bed, shifting his legs under the covers. “I hate hospitals. I could heal perfectly well in the comfort of our bunker, y’know.”
Castiel inhaled wetly and when he blinked, hot wetness dragged down the skin of his face.
“It’s not a date, Kevin, shut up,” Dean snapped, dropping the box to the ground with a thump and shoving it under the white table cloth with his foot.
Like a wild animal. Like a wild animal needing to be savagely fucked. Or a wild animal that wanted to savagely fuck someone else...
A hot mouth went around the tip of his cock and slid down the shaft. Castiel’s eyes snapped open and he jerked his hips back, away from the tight throat that had flexed around him.
“Are you alright?” Castiel asked quietly, eyes quickly darting to the cell door, wondering if he was even allowed to talk. He wasn’t sure what he was allowed to do.
“By force,” Castiel choked out, looking white under the ash and dirt on his skin.
The husband snorted, scowling at Dean. “Of course not. She works long hours, but we wouldn’t make her work on a Saturday night. She looks after Tim and our house only from Monday to Friday.”
And Cas hated him.
“Don’t...take it so hard, Dad. A-And you’re not on your deathbed. You’ll get better, it just takes time,” Dean said, pulling his chair closer to his dad’s bed, careful not to knock an IV or a heart monitor or anything. His dad would flip. Dean wanted to reach out and place a hand on his Dad’s, offer some kind of comfort, but he knew it would just make him angrier. Comforting touches meant he was weak in his eyes, and even lying on his side, attached to every machine the hospital had in their inventory, John Winchester refused to look weak.
Sam’s voice, as it always was in these situations, was very, very gentle. “It’s okay to feel like this, Dean. However it is you feel… It’s about time. We’d all been waiting for this to happen. You came back from
Castiel opened his eyes abruptly, gasping a bit, and by his head, Dean beamed at him, one side of his face in shadow, the other glowing in dull orange light from the hallway.
With a one-shouldered shrug, Dean said, “Dunno. Never had to deal with this on Earth. Could be hours, days, weeks?”
Castiel was the one who needed a hand, for fuck’s sake.
Castiel turned to him, frowning. “You’re persistent. Annoyingly so.”
Cas panted under him and his palms trembled against Dean’s skin. “I love you, Dean.”
With a slow nod, Castiel looked over at Missouri, who was watching him already, and they exchanged soft smiles. She winked and folded her hands in her lap, staring up at the picture of John Winchester propped up beside the open-casket as she murmured to Charlie beside her.
had even texted him, which was strange. He wasn’t sure why Sam would’ve bothered to get his number—they hadn’t ever texted before—but Castiel figured Hannah had given it to him, or worse, Dean had when he’d realised he’d been blocked. Either way, as soon as Castiel saw “
“No, they know,” Dean murmured to the floor, his jaw clenching, all of the light-heartedness lost from his face. He almost looked angry.  “Most of ‘em anyway. My brother, too, but...being out is kinda new for me.”
“You don’t look so good,” Dean rumbled gruffly, leaning over Cas and turning on the shower. It sputtered and for a moment he thought it wasn’t going to work, but then frigid water sprayed onto his hand and Dean was happy they were using this stupid contraption to lower Cas’ fever, and not because they wanted the comfort of a nice shower. It was nearly ice.
Jimmy released a long, laboured breath and he swayed sideways, collapsing into Jamie’s arms. His head thumped against her chest and she held him tightly, her tears dripping into his hair. “You’ll be fine,” she whispered. “You’ll be okay.”
Of course she’d tried to make it seem like he was the bad guy. Swallowed in a blast-wave of anger, Castiel didn’t reply at first. He stayed silent, and at his sides his nails left semi-circles in his palms.
Naomi’s tight smile curled into an easy one. Castiel wanted to slump over into his roasted potatoes and groan. The look on her face meant nothing but trouble, and he did not want to find out what it was.
He helped him stand, and to bed. He pulled the covers over him and spoke to Hannah when she came over at 3 am to ask what the commotion was about.
Luci whistled like a cat call, and stepped forward, adding, “
“I won’t leave. I’ll watch over you,” Castiel murmured, “until Sam gets home, and then maybe we can help him with the funeral plans? What do you think? I-I heard he’s not coping so well, himself, without you.”
s voice blaring from the radio beside him. He looked up from a handful of cash, flipping over all the bills to face the same way as he counted under his breath. “How’d it go with Naomi?”
Castiel reached forward, stepping towards Daphne, looking like he was about to go pet a python, his steps careful. Then he took the key fob from her gingerly, and stepped back, away from her.
Castiel groaned, moving away from Dean to set her tea back on the bedside. He watched as she pushed his hand away and pulled her legs out from under the covers, sliding them over the edge of the mattress.
“Is that a personal question that I shouldn’t ask?”
“Well,” he joked at the boats, “we were friends with benefits, but those benefits have been rescinded for my bad behaviour. So friends will have to do, I suppose. Also, I’m hoping if I remind you that we’re friends that you’ll stop giving me the cold shoulder and walking away from me in the street.” Dean waggled his brows and jerked his thumb over his shoulder. “My calves are burning from trying to keep up with you, not all of us have dancer legs.”
Dean grinned, thrilled, but confused. “What the hell? I saw you like fifteen minutes after I showed up here, but it took Eileen two weeks to die? What does that make her, like two thousand years old, Earth 1 time?”
Sam rolled his eyes. “Are you coming to the cabaret show tonight?”
Well, shit. He’d meant to just say ‘I feel like I’m going to miss you’, but it had all just
There it was. The hunter’s alarm again. Castiel’s presence, what she was saying, of course it didn’t come without conditions.
“Free spirits?” Charlie laughed in a bark. “Kevin, you are
“Doubtful,” Benny replied darkly. “Just be thankful he joined that firm in Cali and not here. At least he’s not in the viral hotspot.”
Dean hesitated, then put his hand on Castiel’s waist.
In his chest, something warm blossomed and grew. Maybe it was the golden light. Maybe it was blue eyes and freckles and a ghost of a smile on dry lips.
Maybe Castiel hadn’t known Samandriel was his son, but he and Hannah lead this community of wayward angels. They kept everyone together. They’d been parents to Samandriel in their own way, to all of them.
” Dean said, not willing to admit his voice go higher in indignation. “You take that back—”
“The view,” he choked out, “is great.”
Sam was silent.
“What,” Zachariah asked snidely, “is the story, at least?”
“I’m sure she has her reasons,” Charlie signed, tugging a packet of cigarettes from her pocket and tugging out a stick. She threw the pack at Dean, who caught it in his fingertips. Charlie snorted, “I mean, it’s bonkers that you two are in love. It’s real fuckin’ stupid and risky, but I’d be lying if it didn’t give me warm and fuzzies.”
“Stay here with me.”
“And I can take my time undressing you.” Dean kissed his way down Castiel’s jawline, walking him backwards slowly and kneading his fingers around his balls. “One button at a time… I’d make good use of that tie…”
Gathering some courage, he put one foot in front of the other and joined her, leaning on the stone barrier on his elbows, holding his pint of beer in between his palms. He gazed out into the night for a brief moment, noticing that they had a good view of neighbouring rooftops and alleyways. It wasn’t the view she had in her service room by any stretch of the imagination, especially as prostitutes solicited men just a few stories below them, visible on the street.
Eventually, Dean gripped her tightly and flipped them so he was on his back. He had wanted, for a long time, Cas on top of him, raising herself up using strong legs, and sinking back down, sheathed around on his cock. Finally, it was happening and she was good at it, losing herself completely, ignoring decency and whatever nonsense she’d seen in porn. Cas, to him, was entirely herself, watching him with intense blue eyes and panting as she rode his cock tirelessly. He gripped her hips, his thumb pushing up the bottom edge of the Rob Zombie shirt, his fingers leaving divots in her skin as he guided her pace when it all became too much.
broken. So much so that Dean looked up involuntarily, meeting a set of green eyes that swam with pain. It was terrible; Bobby didn’t deserve to feel that, he didn’t deserve to take on the angst.
“What the fuck are you talking about?” Dean demanded, his own patience running out. While his mind was urging him to calm down, asking him to not lash out, his heart was pounding and he asked in an irate panic, “What about last night? What about all the things you said to me last night?”
Cas waited, and Dean saw the hurt sink in deeper as the silent, wordless seconds ticked by, until he couldn’t wait anymore.
“The apocalypse,” Castiel said.
Without delay, Dean left, feeling like this would be the last time he ever saw her.
“You cannot vacate right now, nephil,” Castiel breathed, his swallows loud and as abrupt as the sweat the was gathering at the base of his spine. “This is no place for you up here. It’s not time, these people, these angels seek to hurt—”
Dean turned his back on the church and reeled his arm back before whipping the phone down the driveway. He watched the little blue light fly through the air, and disappear into a dry, dead bush in the distance. Behind him, in the church, there was a crash of glass and he spun around in time to see a flash of red at the side of the church before it disappeared. At the same time, Zachariah and Uriel stepped out of the heavy front doors.
He watched her tongue as it slipped out and licked at her bottom lip. In a whisper, she said, “He’s very boring. His voice is nasally; it irritates me.”
Cas’ fingers tightened in his shirt and his other hand fumbled to grasp at the sink above Dean’s shoulder. Through his teeth, Cas wheezed, “Something is wrong. I’m different. I’m
Why was Dean not going to come home tonight? What had Castiel done wrong to deserve nearly three days of silence from a man he’d thought was interested in him? They’d talked nearly every day, and spent nearly every weekend together here, on the couch, making out or watching movies or listening to music. They’d ordered pizza. Castiel now knew Dean liked pineapple on pizza but didn’t want him to tell anyone. They’d talked. They’d stayed up hours past midnight just
Twice.
“She was always too cool for us,” Dean chuckled, settling his chin on his hand, propping his elbows on his knees.
“CAS!” Dean bellowed. “WATCH OUT!”
Sam shook his head, his puppy dog eyes shadowed under furrowed brows. “Actually, you’re far past panic, Dean. Panic was when you had to pull over this morning because a cop was following us for too long and you thought we were going to jail.”
Seven hours later, Sam had gone through eleven of EllenOfOz’s stories—or rather, fanfictions. That was what Becky had called them when she’d replied to his email.
If he’d listened to Cas about Jack, and told him how he really felt about having a son with him.
“Oh...yes?”
What'd you think? Lemme know in a comment! :D
that hurt Dean’s ears and then a clattering of metal hitting the floor by their feet.
“Hello, Dean,” she replied flatly, her nostrils flaring.
Though he tried to hide it, Bobby’s glare at his destroyed kitchen and living room was deeply annoyed. “S’fine,” he grumbled. “They were
when Castiel didn’t open any of them. If Uriel was worried enough to bother him so persistently, it meant Naomi had either rushed off to tell him all about their fight or told him all about the texts. Neither case meant anything good; it meant either Uriel had heard Naomi’s side of the story and agreed with her, or that he’d heard about Dean and pitied him.
sick. “You think… Are you telling me what you think you’re telling me?”
Sam stared at the clock, his chest tight, his eyes burning. He was supposed to save the world, he was supposed to make up with Dean. And the world was going to perish in fifteen minutes. He should’ve fought against Zachariah, he shouldn’t have pretended to go along with it, shouldn’t have offered to stay in the room. Now, the world was gonna burn, Dean would die trying to save everyone, and Sam had to live with the knowledge that his own selfish desire to not be a freak had come between them. He shoulda told the angels to take a hike like Dean had ordered him to in the first place.
Dean waved a hand through the air. “Don’t straighten up for me, honestly, I—”
But then, as his fourth orgasm shuddered in his belly, contracting the muscles of his legs, and rumbled up through his shaft, she whispered, “This is when it gets painful for you guys, huh?”
Dean walked out into the yard and through the maze of rusted, abandoned, half-completed, and piled up cars. Without meaning to, Dean found himself standing at the edge of the trees where he’d emerged upon his reanimation.
“Are you sure?” Zachariah asked cheerfully, tilting his head. “Because I’ve got three of your most trusted garrison members right here, ready to be rescued. All we want are the two mud monkeys in your company. You hadn’t even
“We’re working on it,” Dean replied kindly.
out of his head, and to forget the feeling of his anxiety draining away as Dean had pulled him up from the floor and kissed him even when his lips were still swollen and wet and used.
Zachariah set the vase of oil down on a dusty desk holding other odd artifacts and a few ornate bowls. He stepped around the still unconscious Ruby, shooting her a look of disgust. Despite his reaction to her, he addressed Anna as he made to exit the room. Glancing over his shoulder at her, he replied lightly, “Because I want you to watch the Earth—the one you chose to fall to—burst into flames. And I want to save you for later, Anna. I’d like to take my time with you when I rip you a new one.”
“I wish someone would have told me about the barely functioning ceiling before I moved in,” Dean complained, wincing up at the hole above his bed. He pouted his bottom lip out and inclined his head towards Sam. “Hey, Sammy, you wanna trade apartments?”
There was a heavy silence where he waited a moment, expecting to be stabbed through the curtain, but when certain death didn’t come, he peered out from behind thick fabric.
“Sorry about Kevin,” Dean murmured once they were out of hearing range, glancing back at the booth. “He’s a nice enough kid, just kinda grumpy. He works hard for the shop and is basically my best employee, so I let shit slide for him.”
Dean forgot all about his cigarette, his fingers cramping around it as he stood dangerously still. He suddenly found himself breathless, staring at Uriel.
“You prayed?” Castiel said, shifting her feet on the carpet in the middle of the room. The trench coat was settling around her knees from her landing. “I heard your voice, Pamela. Felt your call.”
Hannah took on Uriel with Samandriel, the two of them ducking as he tried to slice them open with quick sweeps of his angel sword.
Though it felt hard to breathe, like air was entering her lungs through a pinhole, Castiel grasped the wooden banister at the end of her bed. In a raspy growl, she ground out; “Then Dean and I will take her after the show.”
For the first time since last night, Cas’ eyes were clear and his skin was losing that shining quality, the sweat cooling on his skin. He seemed to be returning back to normal, while Dean was growing hot, though he was unsure if it was the trance or the sheer panic over the thought that he’d had an allergic reaction to something, and he and Cas were locked together by their genitals.
When she spun around to face the crowd, her face was confident, the vulnerable look in her eye hidden behind her stage persona. She snapped out her arm and swung it down to sit on her hip, just in time for the other angels to join her at the end of the catwalk, their arms coming around her, twining around each other, lips against each other’s skin, lips spread into grins.
"It's what real fun looks like, princess," Dean laughed back, grinning and winking at her. With a rush of bravery, he reached forward and took her hand. Even though his heart hammered in his chest when her fingers wrapped around his, he nodded towards the bar. "Come with me. There's someone I want you to meet."
All it had taken was one text from Hannah saying, “Hey, Cuz. I’ll be staying with Sam, considering everything that’s going on. It’s all so terrible. Text me when you’re done with work and we’ll talk.”
At the door of the barn, Hannah was twining the chains through the handle, pausing to look up at Anael, who stood close, talking in what looked to be hushed tones. Both women looked serious and focused.
That’s when it happened. His orgasm rushed up through his cock, pulling his balls tightly against him, and he gasped.
The blue in Castiel’s eyes was so brilliant and bright, despite his pupils blown out and dilated, that the ocean in Paradise over his shoulder looked pale in comparison. “I don’t want to be on the floor anymore, to start.”
Finding somewhere to lay low was ridiculously easy in the sketchy part of town Chuck had dropped them in. Nearly every apartment building had rooms for rent, and not forty minutes later, Dean was breaking into a vacant apartment in a particularly run-down building. All he’d needed to do was slip some bored looking residents a fifty and ask which apartment had been vacant for a while.
“Glad you’re welcoming of her, even though she stopped talking to you, Char.”
“Yes!”
“Get that sadness out of your voice, Castiel, my unicorn,” Meg mocked, coming up behind them with a clicking of heavy heels. “You started this with the Duke."
“I thought you said…” Dean hesitated, remembering all the times John had implied the doomed consequences of Dean coming out as anything other than straight. “I-You said, I mean, back when I was—You know, when you thought… That one time with me and Lee—”
“After I told you to go, I got on the phone with her. We set up a plan to for you to stay with her. It was just a five-hour drive. We’d decided you’d drive out there and she’d get you settled. IDs, money, clothes. She was sayin’ you could stay with her--”
“Turn back!”
Balthazar and Dean exchanged looks. “It’s… uh…”
Sam shook his head, after following Dean's stare. "Yes...Thursday.”
Dean stepped towards him, a fond twinkle in his eye. He raised his hands to Castiel’s face, cradling his jaw, and he asked clearly, “I told you a million times that I wanted you all to myself, and I meant it. Be mine forever. Will you marry me, Sunshine?”
Meg, Kevin, Sam, and Dean all jolted out of place, striding towards the tower. Behind them, Balthazar finished his descent down the steps, taking three at a time.
Again, Naomi breathed loudly into the phone. “So does this mean you’ll go all doe-eyed and weak-kneed and end up sucking his cock in the stockroom?”
While the hot colour of dusk shone through Dean’s windows, painting them both in fiery tones of purple and orange, the space between them was hotter, their breath puffing against each other, the intensity of their grips making him feel like he would implode. All the heartache he’d felt all day melted away instantly, though he knew it shouldn’t. Castiel hadn’t say anything, this wasn’t amends. For all he knew, it was goodbye, and his stomach hurt at the thought, joy draining from him quickly.
“And save for one scene where they stop Sean from breaking the seal, that’s ending for you, Zachariah. Enlighten us with your thoughts? We are eager to receive your feedback.”
Swallowing a sob, Dean ran his wet hand over his face and gave his head a shake. “Gonna save you, Cas,” Dean whispered roughly as he turned off the taps and looked at himself in the mirror. “You and that nephil. I’m not gonna let you rot up there, I ain’t gonna leave you behind. I...I promise I’ll fix things. We’re gonna get you both back to our universe, and we’re gonna save Jack. too, I promise. Just hang on.”
“Jeeze, Cas,” Dean laughed, shrugging and moving around the room as well, now, gathering his things to avoid her eye. “I know that. You don’t have to keep saying it, y’know? I
If he had to walk, Dean wasn’t sure he’d be able to. Cas pulled the breath out of his lungs with her words, and he felt weak in the knees, the realization that nothing he could say would fix things made him feel empty.
“Hey,” he greeted, before glancing between the other inhabitants of the room and ducking out the front door, his conversation muffled as it closed behind him with a click.
“Please,” Jamie begged. “I don’t know anything. Cas had something to tell Dean but I don’t remember what it was and I don’t—
. We abandon vehicles at random, and yet, this is the third base camp we’ve had to set up because the others have been discovered.”
Dean looked over at Sam and the boys shrugged at each other. Despite the macabre situation, Dean smirked a bit. “Good point, Sammy. You good to go?’
needs us to, how come she can’t help us out once in a while?”
“How do you know each other?” Naomi asked sharply, raising her brows over her sunglasses. “I’ve never heard of you.”
“Been there done that,” Dean chuckled.
Anna stared at him, her hand on his face. She brushed her thumb over his lip and she smiled. “I understand.”
Castiel collapsed back onto the bathroom floor, breathing roughy, tears still leaking from the corners of her eyes. The hair around her face was curly, clinging to her skin, one long strand even snaked over her face and neck.
Balthazar curled his hand around her head and planted a kiss between her hairline and the blue gem that hung from her headband. Pulling back, he smiled at her, giving her a proud shake. “Splendid. I’ll prepare everything, you just keep your schedule cleared for that evening.”
“No sex talk!” Dean barked, his voice tight. “Gross.”
Ah, so they knew. They could read minds.
While he did glance at the bathroom door, Dean licked his lips and stepped into the bedroom, shaking his head. “You’re a weird dude.”
“Stop.”
“Take those fingers off my glass, Kevin,” Dean growled, “or lose ‘em.”
Dean stepped away from her and whispered, “
They were, she realised. She was, Dean was, and Balthazar was.
When he opened them, the swing beside him was empty, and his stomach growled.
anymore. You
His ass was saved from the cool air by a hot mouth latching over his hole, and a wet, warm tongue tracing moan-inducing circles around it. The vacuum was getting louder on the other side of the office, but Castiel was having a difficult time caring as his cock dripped pre-come, and the way Dean was eating out his ass was making his brain short circuit.
“When was the last time you had sex for
“Oh,” Uriel said, his chin tucked to his chest as he laughed under his breath. “She and I shotgunned a few beers on the side of the house before we showed up.”
The woman nodded, her curls bouncing, and her beaded earrings jingling. “I’ve never met an angel, but in our psychic circles, angels have been known to communicate. Some argued they aren’t angels at all, but just powerful, positive spirits. Obviously, as we found out yesterday, that’s untrue.”
What had they done?
Her eyes jumped back to his, holding his stare. “You’re angry.”
A silence fell over them as her face crumpled and a tear leaked out of the corner of her eye. She pressed the tissue to her lips and inhaled shakily, staring down at her desk.
Falling through the portal was less dramatic than last time. This time they landed softly on two feet, not into a showering of gunfire and riots. This time when they opened their eyes, they opened them to see peace and hear nothing but silence.
Castiel stared back at them from the doorway of the kitchen. Her eyes were wide, her mouth pressed into a thin line, and her cheeks tinged red. A flush was creeping up over the collar of her shirt.
“That’s not true,” Dean whispered. It was all he could get out.
Castiel rubbed at his stomach, actually feeling like he might vomit. He wanted to go home so badly. Maybe not to Daphne, but to his bed, to his small kitchen, to his seat on his balcony. He missed his PB&J’s at three in the morning. He missed his shitty instant coffee that Daphne hated. What he wouldn’t give to have the opportunity to eat a burger on his balcony right now—
“Difference number one,” Hannah said with a sigh. “None of our angels fell. The angels you see in our ranks chose to be down here. We chose our side.”
“I, uh, stopped talking to him,” Dean admitted quietly. “After that night at my birthday, I didn’t have the guts to face him. I blocked his number and deleted his emails, and refused to see ‘im. He’s tried to reach out throughout the last year and a bit—either through Sam or Charlie—but I dunno, I can’t face him.”
“I’ve never bullshitted so hard in my life,” Dean laughed as he raised his glass, meeting everyone else's’ with little sharp clinks. “I definitely appreciated all of your contributions. There were points where I was sure I’d flounder. But I’m happy I pulled it off for you, I can tell it means a lot.”
a nice girl. She was just misguided. She made a mistake.” Regina’s eyes went wide and she lowered the tissue, looking between Cas and Sam. “You… You don’t think Ashley is responsible for this, right?”
The bark of laughter the surprised Dean by jumping out from past his lips echoed over the water. He was rewarded by a reluctant smile from Cas.
Castiel stared at the rug.
“My soul’s not that great,” Dean added with a huff of laughter, his shoulders shrugging. “And trust me, my body is only marginally better—”
It was true. Lee was smiling at Sam crookedly—much like Dean did some times—and was patting at his arm. Whatever he’d said was making Sam smile too, so he couldn’t be that bad.
Castiel shifted his phone from one ear to the other as his neck cramped. “A music festival, Naomi.”
Pamela certainly couldn’t; she walked around looking pale, her eyes widening every time Dean screamed. Chuck would jump, or stay up in his room where the screams were the quietest.
Castiel thought back, knowing that Dean couldn’t hear him but feeling like if he replied back, he could fade away from reality, to a safe space in his mind where Dean was there to comfort him.
Sam was leaned over too, and he said with a wince, “Yikes. Everyone all right, officer?”
Cas seemed to wince, and it made Dean feel a bit of guilt under the roaring hunger in his stomach. “Yes,” she replied. Her eyes shining with worry, Cas looked up and admitted, “This is certainly blasphemy, Dean. No one can know. I’m doing this because I feel…”
“I’ll hold off the Duke for a bit longer, darling. Be ready in an hour. I’ll send him to your room at the right time,” Balthazar called after Cas as the girls descended the steps to dressing rooms and disappeared.
“God?” Naomis suggested, raising a brow. “Don’t waste your breath, sterile scum. God is dead.”
Sam sighed. “Dude, it’s just fun, okay? If you’re not into it, why are you still reading? Like, you can’t deny that these characters sound like us. It’s kinda neat to see that total strangers seem to, like, know us, y’know? I mean, if you wanna roll your eyes about something, the most ridiculous thing about all these stories is that you and Cas are in love.”
or did you just need
Dean stared at the phone, eyes almost unfocused. His tongue dragged over his dry, chapped bottom lip and it took a moment, but when Dean finally spoke, it was a weird withered rasp; “I’ve really needed you t-the last couple d—”
“I’m sorry that he hurt you,” he murmured.
Chuck went back to taking tokes from his joint, while Dean and Sam exchanged hard looks.
“Yeah, he was—”
Sam snorted beside him and Pamela yelped with laughter in the front, while Bobby shook his head and grumbled, “Shut your pie hole back there, boy. Hell or no hell, I will kick you outta this damn car and make you walk home.” Bobby’s hands tightened on the wheel, and he muttered, “Makin’ angel puns in
“Were you able to see my hallucinations?”
“Yer being real weird this morning,” Bobby said around a piece of toast, narrowing his eyes at Dean. “Skipped the bacon. You were up before anyone else, which is the true sign of the Apocalypse. And the brooding coffee drinking is kinda disconcerting.”
“Garth!” a man moaned, shrinking against the wall, looking shattered. “Oh God. Oh God. H-He had kids, what the fuck. What the fuck.”
They were running out of money, Daphne was running out of lies to tell people about where Cas was, Castiel was running out of nerve as more men in the building were dragged away.
Rebel. That was the second time someone had called him that this week… Dean’s grinning face flashed behind Castiel’s lids.
Uriel held out the chalice and nodded towards it. “Quickly, Dean. We have minutes.”
“Step into my office, let me make you gay.”
“I don’t want to talk about this anymore,” Castiel murmured, dropping the fork before he threw it across the restaurant—the overpriced fancy brunch joint at the bottom of Naomi’s corporate office downtown, the one she insisted is the best, despite her snippy attitude with the staff.
Blackness.
With the snow and the stillness, it was eerily quiet except for their footsteps and the shuffling noises of their clothing against bulletproof vests. As time drained away and five minutes drew closer to ten, their footsteps slowed and Dean felt both Castiel and Sam walk up on either side of him.
“She could destroy everything!”
He was tired of the pain, he was little bit lightheaded from the beer, and he was exhausted. No amount of blinking would clear his vision. He couldn’t read the label on his beer.
Naomi returned, her heels clicking over the hard floor. Once again, she kneeled before him. This time she didn’t touch him. Instead, her cold, silver eyes darted across the features of his face before settling her venomous stare in line with his gaze.
“God, I don’t even know why I try,” Naomi growled. Castiel heard dishes being angrily thrown into a sink and clattering together on the other end of the line. “I just… I’m so hurt that you’d ignore me for some guy.”
Soon they’d need three bedrooms.
Meg seemed peeved at being interrupted, but she rolled her eyes and nodding, following the depositors and the milkers out of the room. Dumah lingered by the doorway, out in the hallway, watching.
They jumped down onto the ground floor, and tore across the parking lot towards Dean and Sam’s room. Looking over her shoulder, Pamela barked, “I was being thoughtful! Be happy I didn’t suggest the motel down the street. You’re the one who’s noisy and—”

showed me.”
“We’re going to get another drink,” Jimmy said abruptly, reaching over and plucking Amelia’s empty glass from her hand, interrupting her from retorting—Dean saw it on her lips, too; a snappy clapback. All of Ash’s jokes aside, he was pretty sure there
“Dean!”
Cas stared at it and then up at Dean as the light died away.
“Sure. Put it on speaker.”
“Maybe you should eat something,” Dean suggested.
Doing quick math, though thinking felt hazy, Castiel winced and asked, “So you’ve gone to…to the, um, dairy farm twenty-seven times?”
“No, of course not, my Duke. I-I don’t smell anything. Come enjoy the view and enjoy some fresh air with me.”
Sam stared at Bobby, pausing as he slid his jacket over his shoulders. “Uh, that plan… It’s…”
His eyes opened and Castiel was kneeled in front of him, one knee on the floor, her skirt pooled over her thighs. The trenchcoat was twisted to the side a bit, folded over Dean’s extended legs that must’ve slid down as he’d began to feel faint.
and her most recent MBB
“Did they say why?” Dean asked bluntly, his eyes wide under furrowed brows. “I...I mean, why him?”
Dean kneeled down beside the graceless angel slowly, grief washing over him in waves as her hot blood soaked into the denim of his knees and he watched Castiel’s face crumble, a thick, heavy wave of tears pouring down his cheeks. They dripped off his nose and chin onto Hannah’s clothing.
Castiel stared at him, then said expectantly, “You have a line.”
“You remember what? The angels putting a GPS on you?” Dean asked expectantly, throwing out a hand. “You remember them doing some kinda mojo on you? What?”
“I rebuilt you,” Castiel explained quietly, her voice hoarse. “My grace pulled the pieces of you back together again after demons tore you apart. As we travelled through Hell together for twenty years, you and I, I healed your many wounds by my hands, with my grace.”
“Oh my God, relax, Samantha,” Dean groaned, pressing his face into his covers. They needed to be washed. “I have one sketchy hookup and your wig is
“Oooooh,” Steve breathed. “Will that help?”
Cas snorted, getting to her feet gingerly. She shrugged off the robe she was wearing, hanging it on Dean’s coat rack. She turned to him, in nothing but one of his shirts, and began twisting her hair into a plait, scowling. “I’ve never known anything else. I’m already established here. I…I have the lead part in the show. It’s going to be something big, something special for Heaven. I have to be here. This is my chance to save Heaven from closure. And...and this isn’t just about me, Dean. I have the angels to protect.”
“And now,” Dean responded, swallowing the lump in his throat and blinking away the sting behind his eyes, “I’m going to do everything for you. What do you want?”
Not needing to be told twice, Cas said,”I’ll get the babies!”, and ran for the room with the broken glass where his nephil and fledgling squealed in alarm.
“We did it, Sammy. We’re in Heaven,” he agreed, nodding his head. “And it is perfect.”
“Dude. Dude, shut up or I’m gonna be sick.”
Hannah walked in first. She waved to everyone and stood awkwardly, looking around the room. Castiel followed, allowing Dean to close the door behind her. Then she pointed up at the ceiling.
“Sure,” he replied, shoving his hand into a bag of Twizzlers. “Shoot.”
If she didn’t kill him first.
Dean let himself into Cas’ house. It wasn’t hard, the doors were always unlocked so Castiel’s friends could come and go.
Dean smirked. “That explains why your pupils are so freakin’ dilated. I thought you were just super high.”
Dean shook his head as he slid out of the booth and straightened his jacket. His palms started to sweat, anxiety building in his chest as showtime drew nearer.
“Whatever, dude. How’s the party going so far?”
Bobby opened his mouth to greet Sam when someone from the crowd barked, “Who do we have to fuck around here to get a beer?”
Charlie stopped in front of her and scratched the back of her neck. “We work together, Cas. We see each other all the time.”
Sam’s jaw dropped over Lee’s shoulder and Charlie faux-fainted into his arms, hand-to-forehead and all, while Hannah looked like a toddler who realised Christmas had come early. Kevin just looked confused, scowling at Sam and mouthing, “Dean is
“So...you didn’t shut us all out because of the thing with Naomi. You...
A click, then;
Cas would be there.
Castiel admitted, feeling like he was on the brink of being hit in the face with a Louis Vuitton purse. “I have one more show to see at four o’clock and I know it won’t interest you—”
“Of course,” Castiel replied with another tight nod. “Of course, no, that’s fine. I didn’t meant to presume we’re—”
He woke up reaching up for his lips, trying to pull a long lock of wavy hair from his mouth. It had blown into his face from the hot, putrid breeze of Hell, rising up over the cliff they rested on, from depths where souls shrieked and demons roared.
And then he walked away. Away from her, towards the steps leading from the stage down into the center aisle, where he’d eventually reach the exit and disappear. He’d pack his things, wait for Sam, hop on a train and leave her. She would remain in Heaven…forever. With Zachariah. Just how Balthazar and Naomi had always planned.
Dean sat up straighter in the uncomfortable chair, licking at his lips and trying to push down the rising knot of nerves in his stomach. He already felt nauseous from his meds and the sterile smell of hospital, he didn’t need anxiety to contribute anymore bad vibes.
“Cas, chill,” Dean whispered, his eyes darting around. “You’ll draw attention to us. It doesn’t seem to be around right now and we should be using the time to get out! The last thing we need is seven shrieking babies giving us away.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Thankfully, it appeared Dean was a merciful man. He leaned in and kissed Castiel quickly, the peck he planted on his lips brief but still immeasurably reassuring. “Show me that bed.”
“You do, Claire-bear, I heard.” Castiel’s thumb brushed the little girl’s face and Dean tried not to stare, but his heart did a little flip at Castiel’s genuine, big crooked smile. He’d never seen it before. He watched her kneel on the floor in front of the small girl and rest her hands on her shoulders, planting a kiss to the child’s forehead. “You’re a real actress now. Are you excited?”
But he found himself gravitating towards the farthest wall, which wasn’t so much a wall as it was a giant window; glass spanned floor to ceiling and opened to a wide balcony with a couple chairs and a small table. Dean saw a half-empty coffee cup on the railing, looking like it’d been forgotten. He gripped the handle to the sliding door and looked over the trees surrounding the house, pausing to stare at the beach just visible over the canopy of the woods.
This was all wrong. Cas was supposed to escape with Dean. They were supposed to have been out by now.
for being an awesome cheerleader and letting me shower her with smutty excerpts of this chapter as I wrote it.
He could throw up.
fall in love with you like I have—"
“I-I don’t know,” Dean said, his eyes wide, his face pale. “It’s Castiel. He’s freaking out!”
“Should I come back later?” she asked, eyes a bit wide.
“Well, I didn’t say it was gonna be easy,” Bobby huffed.
“No one,” Castiel whispered.
Silence.
“What is—” Zachariah was cut off mid-sentence when Castiel cupped his cock the way she’d cupped Dean’s only minutes earlier.
“Yeah,” Ruby grumbled. “But they don’t work so well against angels.”
“Yeah,” Dean groaned, his head pulsing hotly, the pain transforming from dull to sharp rather quickly. “It got me good. It felt like I got hit with a freakin’ boulder.”
“That feels empty. Who will you share your money, and home, and jewels with when you’re a famous actress? Your reflection in the mirror?”
And he broke the tension by sitting up and wrapping his arm around her, tugging her close to him and onto his lap. Their breath puffed across each other’s lips as they stared at each other, only inches away from kissing again.
asking you not to,” Jamie pleaded. “H-He’ll regret it. You know he will. You’ve been in my head, you know what I know about Jimmy. He’ll miss his family, he’ll regret leaving them. His daughter, Claire. You saw her. How could you take her father away?
Two sets of wings flapped and everyone jumped in front of Anna, except for Dean, who sunk back against the wall, his sweating palms pressed against the old wallpaper. Sam wrenched his handgun from the back of his jeans, Pamela jerked Anna behind her protectively, and Bobby had yanked a shotgun from underneath the kitchen table. Of course Bobby had a gun hidden under the table.
Dean groaned, nodding. “Right. I forgot we’re still glued together. Okay. Hold still.”
The elevator doors slid open and Dean stopped going on about toilets. “Uh, this is us?”
The way Sam was looking at him, Dean figured his brother was thinking the same thing.
“Look,” she urged, and he raised his eyes from the floor.
She didn’t. She smirked at him and nodded. “Yeah. When they were recruiting for this place, they hit up all our spots, called all our ads. For a while there, for the first week, almost all of us were sex workers. Then a bunch started quitting. Some feel bad, y’know? About what they make you guys do. But I mean,” she shrugged, watching her own hands as one languidly stroked Cas’ shaft while the other hand twisted and curled around his head, a thumb sweeping under the sensitive cleft under the tip, “it has benefits! And for the first time ever, I have a pension. And like, I can’t complain about the pay.”
Everyone turned to stare at Cas. She fixed Sam, then Dean, with a cold look before she turned towards the Duke and strode off stage towards him.
He felt them, too. And he stretched them out, nearly groaning as they ached in relief and shuddered. The joints creaked and trembled joyfully. It’d been so long since he’d felt them. They’d been so far away…
At least, until the deep, commanding rasp like gravel sounded from behind him.
Dean pushed himself to his feet using the Impala, which he’d parked in the middle of the crossroads with him, and brushed mud off his knees. His lip curled hatefully as he laid eyes on a demon, her growing red eyes twinkling over a wide, painted smile.
“Lock it,” she ordered, striding across the room towards Jimmy and Amelia’s iron bed frame. “Claire, hide in the closet. Jimmy, come over here and help me break this shit apart.”
“Disgusting to look at, isn’t it?” a slimy voice said from behind the counter.
“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry that I forgot.” Dean’s teeth began to chatter as heat rushed to his face. Emotions churned within him, making his head spin. Memories were rushing at him still, too fast, too much—
Ash, Kevin, Sam, and Charlie all exchanged looks of disbelief.
“Where,” Dean repeated firmly, “is Anna’s grace, Cas? You ain’t a hammer, remember? Tell me and stand up against plans that you know seem fishy.”
His coworkers were nice enough and rarely bothered him save for their morning meetings. People knew not to call him, as he did better over email.
Castiel scowled. “After the show, I will be with Zachariah; so, no.”
It happened so quickly, even Dean took a second to catch up. The hand Cas wasn’t using to hold Leia close shot out and grabbed the fist Barbara was using to wrap around the handle of her blade. Cas snarled as she yanked Barbara towards her and swung out her leg, clearing the Zchitri’s legs right out from under her. The creature shrieked and fell onto her side--just in range to be kicked in the face.
Dean and Cas exchanged tired looks. “Because she hates me,” Cas grumbled.
“Noted, darling. I’ll make sure to have a glance at it before I take another gander at the back side of him.”
When the door opened, Castiel stood there. Her face was washed of yesterday’s makeup, not a bit of proof remaining of her emotional state except for the redness around her eyes. She looked exhausted; pale, with dark circles under her eyes. Her mouth was turned down, a scowl etched into her lips.
As Dean looped an arm around his waist and helped him to bed, Dean said with a laugh, “Your secret is safe with me, man. I’ve had my fair share of tears since I got here.” He paused, linking their hands and helping Castiel climb up into bed. Jokingly, he winked and added, “Y’know, manly tears though. Like, I’ll squeeze out one and call it a day.”
Well. He had a point.
“Oh, yeah? You ascended to Heaven when they played ‘
Like a switch was flipped in him, his desperation turned to fury and Dean ran at the door, slamming into it with his shoulder, over and over and over—
“Oh, uh—”
, not because it’s...” Dean waved a hand vaguely, feeling stupid but not having words to sum up what he was feeling, what existed between them.
“Long story!” Sam yell-whispered, tugging Cas towards the stage. He beamed at them both, sweaty fringe flopping into his eyes. “But in sum, Kevin is bad-to-the-bone, and we owe him our lives—well, yours specifically. Now,” he stopped, skidding to a halt before going on stage. He looked between Dean and Castiel, and he said, “let’s get Daniel and Celeste their ending, and stop the apocalypse.”
Ruby pushed off the doorframe and tapped her foot against the floor. She pointed at Dean and chuckled, “Maybe not you, but I know a trenchcoated Charlie’s angel who has a thing for Dean.”
After looking between Ellen, Sam, and Dean, Hannah sighed and murmured, “She’s in the infirmary. Balthazar’s arranged for a doctor to meet her there, ‘cause she’s been feeling sick for days. Usually we get her taken care of sooner, but the Duke’s been all over her, taking up all of her time.”
Dean cleared his throat and stepped into the doorway, making it look like he’d just arrived. Balthazar slowed as he approached him, and with a little jolt of amusement, he noticed Balthazar’s eyes scan the features of his face.
Sam had gone out tonight with Charlie, Ash, and Kevin, back to Heaven for their slower night; Seraph Saturday, a lighter toned night, less flashy and busy than Thursdays. There were some angels Sam had met at the party performing and he wanted to go “support his new castmates”. Dean had been invited but he hadn’t wanted to face Castiel just yet, in case she was one of the performers. He’d wanted at least the entire weekend to lick his wounds in peace and control the constant flush of embarrassment on his face before Monday morning.
The ghost was too close, too angry. She was so livid that the aura around her crackled and the tips of her hair were beginning to rise like they were about to be struck by lightning. Dean’s limbs felt like lead. He knew he had to move because she was too close, but he couldn’t move a muscle, numb with the revelation.
“None of your business,” the man growled, not bothering to cast Castiel a sidelong glance.
Ms. Tathum exclaimed, aghast, but Sam interrupted her with a lofty wave of his hand.
Shit.
The hum of Bobby’s voice and the cloud of smoke emerging from the bowl in front of him pulled Dean from his train of thought. Worriedly, he looked up from the blade, and with relief, he noticed that neither Sam nor Bobby had seen him staring at it. They were both gazing into the bowl, watching the contents start to incendiate as Bobby recited the words.
“Yes,” Castiel said with a nod of their three heads. Gosh, she didn’t know which one to make eye contact with. “In a manner of speaking. Although I do not wish to fool anyone. I simply require a vessel to walk the earth.”
They both took a moment to allow their hearts to slow. Then Balthazar patted her neck again and pulled his hand back, sliding it into his pockets. As he rocked on his heels, he said with a raise of his brows, “We must offer the Mayor a complimentary night, you know that, right?”
“What, so you think it was a bunch of punks or--”
“Samuel,” she acknowledged, her low, raspy voice smooth and blank. Her tone was matter-of-fact and gave away nothing about how she felt. It was unnerving.
Sam pressed send with gusto and reopened the website again, settling back in his chair. He tossed back the rest of his smoothie and placed it down with a cheery tap on the table top. Putting his feet up, he rested the laptop on his legs, thrumming with excitement.
“Fuck this,” Ishim growled, and before anyone could react, he flipped onto his back and swiped his leg out, catching Duma’s ankles, sending her tumbling sideways into Uriel and Hael.
“Please.” Blue eyes went soft. “They’ll surely come back for you. In this universe, you’ve been dead for eleven years, and I won’t watch it happen again.”
If he’d saved him from the water after the Leviathans, or never had left him behind in the asylum after Cas had saved Sam. If he’d said something different than “I need you” in the crypt, and if he reached out and slid his hand around the back of Cas’ neck in the Impala, if he’d pulled him in for a kiss and never let him go inside his boss’ house to be attacked by a rit zien.
Castiel’s eyes narrowed, and Uriel smirked. “Yes, sir.”
Castiel would have red trails down his back if he had been shirtless… And with that thought, mid-hickey, Castiel wrenched the red plaid off Dean’s shoulders, helping him tug it off his arms. It landed on the floor somewhere, wrapped around the leg of a chair, but neither cared to catalogue it. Nor did they care for the white and black t-shirts that joined it.
and...Cas had let him. “Enlighten me.”
“Refreshments for this fine group of noblemen?” she asked, pursing her lips into a wry smile.
Dean pointedly ignored John’s gaze on the side of his face and just flexed his hands around the wheel. “We all did. And what does Sam even know? I didn’t say shit to ‘im.”
Castiel’s head turned to follow his pacing, her hair swinging down by her waist, her brows furrowing. Dean wished she would blink, because even he was starting to get hot in the face from the attention.
God. That hurt. The very idea of doing that… Castiel sucked in a harsh breath, watching his fingers give into the anxiety, trembling as they picked at the beer label. “I don’t want to do that,” he breathed, licking his lips, his chin crumpling. “And I don’t think I can. I’ve tried to leave...I always come back.”
“No,” Sam said quietly, his head dipping, his smile twitching. “Not at all.”
Dean’s brows raised up on his forehead and he eyed the woman. “You let her out to play?” He had to admit, demons didn’t have the courtesy to do that. “For what?”
Bobby joined in, realizing a second after everyone else, after dragging his eyes away from a smug-looking Uriel. “Son, did you break the warding?”
poor.”
“You won’t like it.”
“I know what you and Dean do in the shadows,” Uriel whispered against her hair, into her ear, his voice dark and rasping, “I know about the thirst you fulfill for him, Castiel. And tonight, you’ll do so for the last time. This time, it’ll not only purify him, but it will purify the world.”
Dean swallowed strangely, almost like he would be sick. His eyes were sweeping across Castiel’s face like it was the first time he’d ever seen him. In an odd tone, Dean breathed, “Where have you been? I’ve been calling, texting—I-I—”
“What are you doing?” she asked, irritated to note that her voice was more raspy than usual, the hoarseness in her throat only making her sound like the turned-on puddle of hot arousal that she felt like.
Her door shook when he pounded on it, and he heard a growl from the other side of the door. Still, it stayed locked, in its place.
“Doesn’t matter,” Anna said, impatiently, her eyes flashing. “Those weapons won’t do anything to damage Lilith. If you want to kill her, you’ll need to tap into those powers that’ve been dormant in you since Azael.”
“Om’gahd,” Dean said around the turkey club, mayo painting the corner of his mouth. “I missed food.”
He and Castiel knew what the Duke wanted, what type of things they would have to do to catch and hook the Duke’s investment. Thankfully, he and Castiel had similar ideas to the Duke’s, and they would do anything that needed to get done to save Heaven from closure.
Of course, Dean didn’t lose Castiel on the way out and he continued to not lose him all the way back to the Impala.
Dean took his hand again, reclaiming his fingers. “I’ll need that,” he said, shaking their interlocked hands. “I...want it."
“I’d forgotten it was there,” Castiel murmured, reaching up with her hand to brush the mark. She looked down at him, pulling her eyes from the burn. “I understand humans can be upset by marred skin. Sometimes they find it disconcerting—”
But Zachariah’s eyes flashed and he sat up straighter in his creaky leather chair. “Uriel, was there a mistake during the upload?”
Castiel hummed in agreeance.
Their toes touched, scuffed worn brown steel-toes against sun-bleached toes of practical black leather boots. The hems of Castiel’s trenchcoat brushed Dean’s jeans, tickling the tops of his knees.
Castiel thought, but he shrugged and said, “I’ve been rude. I should let you go.”
The Duke turned and headed towards the balcony. Dean jumped up, peeking over the edge of the bed. Castiel spun around to face him and with a face twisted in anger, she mouthed, “GET. OUT. HE’LL
She tilted her head again and asked, “If you had to kill a friend for the greater good, you would do the same.”
“A relief?” Dean repeated, licking his lips.
He was totally going to get shot for this.
The flutter of wings sounded behind her as she rushed into the church. Down the carpet, at the altar at the head of the church, Alastair was on fire.
"I've been put on a probationary demotion. Uriel will lead the garrison until my superiors feel I've...understood my role, and strengthened my resolve in regards to the mission. They," she lifted her gaze, and Dean was surprised to see the ghost of tears in her eyes, "believe I may rebel. They believe that by allowing myself to feel emotions, I've stepped through the doorway to doubt. I'm not useful that way."
Blearily, Castiel shifted his head on his pillow, mumbling, “It’s not my birthday.”
“Don’t feel silly, Dean-o. She’s a vision, she makes even the most unattached souls feel a spark of hope that she might love them uniquely. But let that dream dissolve away, writer.” Meg’s thumb brushed Dean’s chin, while her teeth tugged at her bottom lip in a cold grin. Her whisper puffed against his lips, her eyes glittering. “I remember the noises she used to make with me, the whimpers, the long, delicious moans that I still feel vibrate against my lips to this day, in my dreams… I remember her under me, hot and slick… I wonder if she’ll make those noises with him?”
Then, the doors opened one day and Hannah was there, jerking her head out into the hallway, ordering gruffly, “Ready to rejoin your flock? Times up, Mr. Grace.”
“So weird to run into you here,” Dean pointed out, unhooking sunglasses from the top of his sweat-drenched shirt and sliding them onto his face. “What a small world, huh?”
Castiel jerked forward, reaching his hand out to stop her, but before he could, Hannah was hugging Naomi, who was holding out a salad bowl to the side and looking shell-shocked when Hannah hugged her middle.
The staring went on a bit long, and Dean gestured at her, shuffling back against the headboard. He licked his lips then murmured, “Second time you saved my ass today. Or third, but...who’s counting?”
Castiel raised his head, his eyes pinched at the corner and looking suspiciously glittery. “Your world is intact. Heaven is intact, the angels are fertile?”
With the street lamp as the only source of light in the room since nightfall, Dean turned his head and watched Cas snooze. Even with Cas’ back to him, Dean could tell he was in the dead of sleep, his shoulders rising and falling at a slow, steady pace but the rest of his body not having moved an inch since he’d laid down.
“Only if she resists. And she can’t be tortured if she’s dead,” Castiel said defiantly, though she seemed to catch herself and sigh. She looked down at the ground solemnly. “If it were up to me, she would not have a target on her back, but we have our orders. Capture or kill. Our secrets are worth that, it seems.”
The End.
He couldn’t hear her as the drums got obscenely loud and the rest of the crowd join in, singing gleefully, their voices filling the room, but Castiel joined in, yelling the words at him, looking beautiful and delighted under the flashing lights.
“No, Dean. I told you; I think we found you. We’ve got means.”
Castiel nodded, swallowing hard, the lines around her eyes crinkling as she pursed her lips. They watched her pause, then turn back to the Tupperware containers, closing them shut slowly, squeezing at the edges to ensure they were sealed.
“You’re right,” he replied, nodding slowly, rolling his weight from his heel to the balls of his feet. “What if… What if I tried to do better? We can go back to how it was with our original arrangement?” He shrugged and grinned. “Just be gentle with me; if I say I love you, ignore me because I’m just a fool, y’know? A bumbling writer who confuses reality with his stories.”
The clock on the wall ticked and it drew Sam’s attention.
She looked up and met Dean’s gaze. He smiled at her and she smiled back.
Dean’s face bobbed back and forth, and his fingers dug into the muscled orbs of Castiel’s ass, keeping him spread. Castiel’s cock tapped at the touch screen of the copier, activating all kinds of functions he wasn’t sure of and didn’t care about. He was being thoroughly tongue fucked, and nothing else mattered. All that was of import was that hot, wet muscle working him open, the vibrating moans that traveled through him and made his prostate swell, wanting to be touched. Spit slicked his ass and was traveling down his shaking thighs—
. It was almost like she’d been floating until she’d found her ideal position and locked in.
The muscles in Castiel’s body all clenched in tension and he stared at Dean, his face suddenly feeling cold and numb.
“A prostitute,” Castiel rasped. He’d never really spoken during the sessions, not after that first one. He wasn’t supposed to, but Meg didn’t seem like she’d fight him about it.
Dean set the bottle down on the bumper of the car beside him and he pointed at her, twirling his finger. “What’s goin’ on here?”
“I… That is up to your discretion.”
When he returned, Dean was propped up on his elbows, watching him curiously, but when he saw the jar in Castiel’s hands, his eyebrows went up. “Oh. I see how it is,” he teased, shimmying his hips on the bed, his cock bobbing. “Tryna butter me up by
Dean blinked away sleep and asked again, “Why are you—”
Ash hoisted up a stack of papers from within a box and flipped through them. “That’s a lot of paper, hombre.”
It was distinctly possible Castiel might pass out, and this year, it wasn’t because of the heat.
“W-W-What do we do!?” Alfie cried.
That earned him a shoulder nudge and the pleasant view of Dean smiling around another sip of beer. Dean's pink tongue slipped out to lick his bottom lip again and Castiel wondered if he’d blinked even once as he stared at Dean’s mouth.
With two beers buzzing in his stomach, courtesy of Uriel’s generosity and insistence that they ‘double fist’ their drinks, Castiel almost forgot about the crowds around him, the anxiety in his chest at a minimum as he swayed to Gwen Stefani and No Doubt playing
Everyone burst into laughter and Bobby rolled his eyes as he turned back towards the counter, ducking under it.
Anna got sick again, throwing up pitifully out the open door. She heard the demon make a noise of disgust, and heard one of the doors creak open. Then, as she pushed hair from her face and sniffled wetly, releasing a small sob, Sam was kneeling in front of her, his hands on his shoulders.
“Hey,” she croaked, wiping at her face with the back of her hands.
“An angel, Dean,” she repeated. “Surely, you rem—”
Oh, and Charlie had been called backstage about some costume issues, so the ringleader of this operation was missing and Dean had no idea where he was going. He hadn’t even gotten the chance to tell her that he and Castiel had set a time.
Dean spun around when a low, raspy voice jerked him out of his surveillance of the city. He reached back and grabbed the railing to steady himself. The sight of Castiel standing at the foot of her bed watching him made his throat go dry.
For some reason, Uriel, who otherwise had no incentive to give a shit about Dean, was urging him to deal with the tension. It was strange, and yet, Castiel knew he’d been unfair to Uriel over the past couple of days, and he was his friend, after all. His best friend at the moment, arguably. If for some stupid reason Uriel was being dragged into the crap between Dean and Castiel, that was on Castiel. How could he be angry at Uriel for being everyone’s messenger when he’d put him in that position? Castiel would go talk to Dean. He had to.
Castiel shifted her weight from one foot to the other, her skirt swaying gently across the floor. Though her eyes suddenly glistened, her face remained impassive and unbothered. “I belong to Heaven. I don’t belong to just any common man.” She paused, then murmured, “And therefore I certainly don’t belong to you.”
Shaking his head, Dean nudged Castiel with his shoulder. “When I was being carted off to the infirmary last week, I heard a phone ring, Cas.”
The worst was that while Dean hadn’t yet mentioned him or indicated at all that he’d continued to see him after the music festival, he
“I’m sorry,” he found himself saying without meaning to, a compulsion he didn’t necessarily understand. He gestured to the warding, the invisible forcefield separating them. “For this. Uh, you know.”
Truth was, he
Remembering breakfast, and the three deliciously warm and sweet honey crullers he’d shoved into his mouth for lunch, and then the extra-large misery pizza he and Hannah had ordered a few hours ago, Castiel blurted out, “No, not much.”
Naomi slammed her fist down against the table by Castiel’s side, jostling her abruptly, and she spun on her heel. She grabbed at a metal tin and wrenched off the top, pouring the contents over Castiel’s body. Pale yellow powder—sulphur—cascaded down onto her skin in a mist, and Castiel screamed, the demon-derived sulphur burning her. Where it landed, her skin smoked and burned like acid.
“Of course,” Mrs. Harvey replied. “Let me get my address book.”
Something snapped in Dean. He felt it sharply in his stomach and for a moment his mouth moved of its own accord. His voice rang out hot and loud; “She chooses the hunter because she’s in love with him! She doesn’t love
Daphne was quiet. She didn’t smile. Even when things were hard, she usually smiled.
“I can take your coat, Hannah. We’re staying for a bit longer, I think. Um, you want a drink?” Sam said, quickly getting to his feet and rushing to take her coat from her.
Luckily, the only sticker on the window of the pharmacy was an anti-possession sticker and an acrylic sign that said
Instead of a bar, or a strip club, or the local mom-and-pop diner for a beer and a burger, Dean went to a park. He stationed Baby in a gravel parking lot; empty now, it was around dinner time. Free of children, it was instead home to joggers and the occasional person walking their dogs. Dean walked over sand and plunked down onto a swing. He didn’t swing, but he let himself sway a bit, looking over the river that cut through the park. A gaggle of geese honked and led their babies across the calm surface of the water. Dean wondered if Uriel would have wiped them out, too, in a blinding flash of holy energy. Dean pictured it; a burst of light and the geese would vaporize, leaving nothing behind but puffs of feathers that sank into the water.
“Cas, you’re just staring at me and not saying anything, it’s creepy.”
“Friend of our dad’s,” Dean replied, throwing back his drink, shuddering pleasurably as it warmed his stomach. He needed to be as loose as he could without making a damn fool of himself. Castiel would be here soon and he had no idea what to expect.
To his surprise, Dean turned around and his face showed nothing but nervousness, and worse; fear.
“I will return at midnight,” it said, staring at Sam intently.
His brows furrowing, Dean asked, “Why haven't you told Uriel yet?”
“Nah, you stay and have fun, Sam. I’ll figure it out.” Dean dragged his hand over his mouth. “Someone’s should hang around to tell Charlie what’s going on.”
“Anyway, my love. Thank you. Your service and commitment to Heaven, as usual, is unyielding and appreciated,” Balthazar said. Dean dared peer around the door in time to see Balthazar move into her personal space, put his hands on her cheeks and press a kiss to her forehead. The women peered up at him, smiling a bit. Giving her little shake, Balthazar said, “Just one more patron, Castiel. Just one more john, and then you’ll finally be a star, all right?”
“That’s right, Sam,” Cas said, still staring at Dean. “And Dean will try to take that from you. He’s jealous. He wishes you were the freak again, the monster, the dark one destined for Hell, because when that’s true, he’s the good boy, the soldier of the light, ready to defend Earth from
” she cried, her voice breaking as one tear slid down her face, cutting through makeup. “
“Dean…”
Big ol' thanks to malmuses, sobsicles, lawful_feral_merit, and kradarua for beta'ing this chapter!
His hands pressed against her face, forcing her to make eye contact. “Cas, after tonight, even if you fulfill your deal, and we do his ending, he’ll tear it all down immediately after, out of spite. You hurt his pride. It was a big ego to crush, sunshine. Heaven never stood a chance with this fucker leading the way.”
BANG.
Jogged out of the strange moment, Dean looked over his shoulder, and saw Sam cough, running his hand under his nose.
Castiel’s shoulders shook as a series of panicked breaths got sucked into his lungs and Dean moved to envelope him in a hug when Hannah’s quiet voice sounded from behind them.
“No,” Castiel replied simply, again, watching Sam with a distanced intensity. “I have her sleeping. It would not be wise to expose her to particulars of our celestial missions. For her safety and mine. I do,” Castiel added as a soft after-thought, “occasionally allow her to wake when we are alone. She particularly enjoys flying.”
As soon as he said it, he regretted it. The playful, challenging air to their conversation dissolved, and Castiel’s eyes narrowed so much he hardly saw blue anymore. Her jaw clenched. With one look of dislike, she took up her glass of wine and made to leave.
“I would really like that,” Dean admitted quietly, looking helplessly at his daughter over Cas’ shoulder. Still deep in sleep, Leia rubbed her face into Cas’ shirt, her binky still bobbing steadily. Dean rubbed his hand over his mouth to hide the smile that was threatening to unfurl there. To save face, so he wouldn't look like a dorky love-sick boy, he cleared his throat and asked, accompanied a raised brow, “You were saying there’s work to do?”
“He’s a 20-percenter,” one of them murmured.
Sam yanked his hand away and asked rushedly, “How am I supposed to even kill her? Dean has the colt and the knife in the Impala, I’ve got nothing.”
Dean nodded in agreement, then suggested, “Feelin’ pukey?”
Caring for her was easy; she graciously accepted the bath he drew for her, and drank the soup and tea. She clung to his side in bed, and hummed as he caressed her face and scratched her scalp with his nails, but she didn’t say much.
Castiel stood as well, waving a hand at the bathroom as he turned to head into the kitchen. “Clean towels are under the sink.”
“It was one indiginity after another,” Castiel growled as they walked up the rickety country home steps, pausing only to trace his finger over the wooden door. Behind his finger rippled a trail of magenta magic that sparked as it formed a distinct symbol. Once it faded away, the door opened with a click and Castiel stepped through.
Despite the hammering of her heart, Castiel shrugged, looking bored. “I was sleeping in Hannah’s room. We fell asleep going over lines—”
The angel’s jaw clenched. “In brief, I wouldn’t be able to enter through those doors. Neither would a demon.”
“The room is trashed,” Sam sighed. “I got here like fifteen minutes ago to find the place turned upside down. None of our stuff was gone, but there was vandalism.”
After being able to talk to Sam and not being caught, Dean had been euphoric. It was a shame that Cas was passed out all night, because all Dean wanted to do was tell Cas about the conversation with Sam. Dean stayed up all night thinking about what to ask Sam to do next, and began plotting ways to escape.
Sam’s concerned face shifted and he smiled at her. “That’s really great, Cas. You must be really proud.”
Glad that Dean was walking over because his own legs had forgotten how to function, Castiel pulled out his phone too, and began reciting his number.
Castiel reached up and pressed her hand to Sam’s face. While it made Dean jerk forward, ready to catch Sam if he dropped like Bobby had, Sam was still, sucking in a sharp breath as her thumb brushed his cheek.
Hopefully, she thought, Cas would be a comfort to her too. She’d be spending a lot of time with the angel, after all.
“You’re welcome,” Dean replied, winking at her.
The big blue eyes blinked several times and she said, “Uh… um…” She swallowed, eyes swiveling towards Dean. “Oh, Dean is much better at explaining it than I.”
The demon and her lackey’s filed into the bedroom, and the twins backed up against the broken bed frame.
Cas still managed to scowl with satin between his teeth. He made no effort to move, still kneeled down by Dean’s feet,
“Dean?”
Castiel's jaw jutted out and he bared his teeth, but Naomi just flickered her hands at the angels who began to tug him from the room.
Ruby stepped through the threshold, scowling and glaring at Bobby. “Thanks,” she said bitterly, clearly not thankful at all.
Dean swallowed nervously. “Yes.”
Since their talk on the marina, Castiel had been careful about "encouraging bad behavior". Dean noticed a distinct lack of eye contact during sex, and she held him close when he would rather stare into her eyes. She spent a lot of time on her hands and knees, and he noticed, after a few tumbles, that he’d spent an awful lot of time staring at her back or the side of her face.
“I have a feeling,” Charlie panted, “that we’re all fired, judging by the look on the Duke’s face.”
Dean went silent when Sam powered on, though his brows were knit together in distaste. “
They were all quiet for a moment, feeling for the mourning widow.
“So...you’re not mad at me?”
“I love you,” he whispered, his heart breaking into pieces as she shuddered under his hands and a small, raspy sob escaped from between her lips. “I do. I’m sorry. I tried not to, but you consume my thoughts. You’re strong and wonderful, Cas. I want to make you happy, and I know you who are. I know who you are and what you do. I will love you even when you’re with the Duke or the mayor or whoever, I—”
your situation. You told me you can’t love, or won’t, or whatever. I’m just here to provide the orgasms while the Duke bores you to death for six months.”
Dean swept forward and grabbed Castiel by the shoulders, spinning them both around. She yelped a bit, grabbing his elbow as he led her back into the room, away from his eavesdropping group of friends.
Pamela got to her feet and sat down on the edge of the bench as well, taking Chuck’s hand and rubbing at it comfortingly. “Did you see it come to pass, Chuck?”
“I cared because you cared. Remember when I wanted so desperately not to care about Jack? You made me care. So many times I lost myself, and lost faith in humanity. And
Fuck, no. Everything
“Hey, be nice,” Dean scoffed. He pressed a hand to his chest. “I was in Hell for six months, I’m fragile.”
“Who’s that?” Dean said, interrupting Charlie, who seemed like she was trying to explain to Dean how annoying it had been to hang the silk from the ceiling for Cas’ act. Or was she talking about hair? Dean hadn’t been listening.
“You okay? C-Cas—”
His hands were on her cheeks in moments, pulling her hands away, and he had every intention of comforting her, assuring her that everything would be fine. He didn’t think he could love her more, but with Claire? His heart swelled and he felt a rush of joy. He loved Claire, he loved Cas. Seeing the little girl’s face, and her big blue eyes with matching dark brown lashes, he felt stupid for never seeing the resemblance. Of course she was her daughter. Of course Claire was hers. It explained so much…
Please leave me a comment to let me know what you think. It's been a wild ride and I wanna know how y'all are feeling about the ending of this story! Also, lemme know how you're doing--these past weeks have been insane, I hope you all are doing well, staying at home, and following public health advisories.
"C'sst'ul!" Gadreel choked, his face turning red, his hands grasping at the chains squeezing around his neck, the warding keeping them both imprisoned.
“‘Fraid not,” her caller sighed. “He’s got twelve groupies and a few prostitutes who he hangs out with fairly regularly.”
“I can imagine. What a night it has been for you, love.”
Dean held Leia closer and he asked, glancing over at the car, “Uh, you mind if I hold her for a bit longer?”
Dean grinned, “Hell yes.”
Sam made a noise in this throat and said, “I don’t know about that, Dean. Everything else Chuck has said has come true. We should stay away from Chuck’s place.”
“My son,” Cas went on, his voice thin and wavering, his head dipped forward so his lips were on Andi’s fine hair, “he could’ve...if he…”
. To Hell with Heaven and the show! Don’t you see, Balthazar; the Duke is going to tear it all down regardless! Whether I go to him or not! He’s—”
When she woke later that evening, looking pale but missing the sheen of sweat that had glistened over he skin in the infirmary, he tried to have her open up.
“Ooookay,” Sam interrupted, raising a hand to stop the man. “I think that’s enough. Just give us a bag and we’ll go.”
Best case scenario, Sam would offer some kind of help. He’d put their differences aside, and help.
“I am utterly indifferent to where we have sex,” he said in a raspy murmur.
Behind her back, Sam snuck into a row of files, soundlessly rooting around, trying to avoid detection.
After they fumbled for coconut oil from the pantry—a silly but welcome break from the intensity of the moment—Dean did eventually slide inside Cas, holding him on the edge of the table. He whispered unintelligible things into his mouth, but also
It’d been a side of her he hadn’t seen before and that haunted him too, settled in his stomach, the guilt weighing heavily.
Anna stood on her tiptoes, sliding the tip of the blade through a sigil in the bindings around Cas’ hands. She did the same with the ones at her feet and then snapped her fingers.
With a smile, and a soft nudge of his nose against Cas’, Dean whispered, “Because it is.”
The sheer number of speeding laws Sam had broken over the last ten hours was frankly alarming, but he and Bobby made good time. A few hours to midnight, they were in Maryland, closer to reaching Ilchester, the town where they’d find the church Dean was heading to. They were so close that Sam felt like he was buzzing, but perhaps that had a lot to do with the sleep he hadn’t gotten the night before. It was good timing when Bobby pointed it out and offered to take the wheel, because if he hadn’t, the car would’ve swerved right off the road when Sam was taken...
“I don’t!”
, he thought in a voice that sounded a lot like Dean’s.
Anna merely shrugged at him, then turned her head to look over at the angels.
In a series of pings and vibrations, the messages started coming in.
Dean’s hands—sponge abandoned, sliding down the hood of the car towards the front bumper—slid down Cas’ thighs and hooked under his knees, lifting them up around his waist. He was leaning down, smirking, waiting.
The slit in her dress made it easy for her to swing her knee up into his gut and Castiel snarled as she tore her hands away the second he let her go. Stumbling back, she panted, “Duke, please, Heaven is my home, a-and my daughter, Claire—”
Lilith’s eyes swept his face and she leaned in, sniffing. “You look different, smell different. You have grace in you now, don’t know how I missed it before. It stinks. How did you do it?”
“She won't treat you poorly now, will she?” Dean asked.
She accepted his help and nodded at his suggestion, and was surprised when she realised that not only had the car stopped, but they were parked in front of a motel. But instead of asking how they got there so quickly, Anna acknowledged that she
“Yeah.” Dean nodded. He rubbed his sweaty palms together. “Yeah, Cas. I’m sorry.”
. He needed to know she had a place to stay, that she’d found her way even without him.
Beside him, Sam breathed out his name. Everyone had been hinting at it, even outwardly confirming, but perhaps he’d been waiting for Dean to say it.
“‘S he gonna be pissed?”
“Riiight,” Dean recalled, wiggling his finger in the air. “Angel of Thursday, I remember now.”
Dean’s hands slid from Cas’ face as their head turned and tilted, their noses bumping and then settling against each other’s cheeks. Dean’s palms pressed against Cas’ chest, feeling desperately for that strong heartbeat. Dean found it, and discovered that it was thumping fast, if a bit wildly.
“Sorry! But t-this place is enchanting!” Dean allowed himself to be tugged along as he stared at a portly older man giggling madly as he sipped on a small glass of sherry and sprawled out in a chair. He pulled an angel into his lap and she threw her high ponytail over her ear and poured over him, whispering something into his ear flirtatiously, her long, wide diamond earrings swinging near his red face. Dean watched him slip neatly folded bills into her hand, which she slipped away into a hidden pocket so quickly Dean almost missed it.
The pit of Dean’s stomach twisted. “Heaven tortures?”
Uriel | 8:40 (October 20th, 2019): Hannah looks like she about to kick some ass. You never told me that girls got a temper. Usually i can see her halo and wings but tonight i’m pretty sure she’s gonna throw down and get arrested if Naomi doesn’t stop looking so interested in the dank memes Sam is showing her
“I’m over 65, dumb shit. The government doesn’t need us old fuckers giving them faulty product, and apparently, they don’t want us at the farms either. It was this or running the gas station over on Main, so I chose this. Government job, pension, benefits. Ain’t nothing to complain about except all you man-babies around here crying and snotting all day long.”
Sam pushed open the door. “All right, all right, Destiel, enough of the fanfic tropes, I’m not third-wheeling this research session—OH MY GOD.”
Jamie jerked her head up. In her arms, Jimmy jumped, turning his head as well.
“So Uriel came to apologize?” Pamela asked, raising a brow. “Hate to agree with Negative Nancy up in the driver’s seat here, but it does seem strange, Sam.”
“What?”
“This is just before the finale. It’s the scene between Zyon and Daniel in the Green Room, and then another between Shaun and Ruby, where Cas has a short break.”
Andi was grinning at his friends at the end of the table, but he turned back to Dean and said with residual laughter in his voice, “When we ripped out our grace to come to earth with Castiel following the war, we struggled to assimilate. It took years to fit in, to dress properly--I had a phase where I wore nothing but overalls. It took quite a long time to act as humans would. But the most striking thing we had to learn was how to function as humans; eating, sleeping, bathing. Without our grace, our vessels lack the energy to sustain themselves as they would’ve before.”
She was a
Sam smiled and Dean sighed.
“Yes.”
Naomi’s head reeled back and even behind her copper tinted sunglasses, Castiel could see her eyes flash like a viper about to strike. “Princess Peach? I beg your pardon—”
It couldn’t be helped, Dean laughed again at Cas’ guilt trip ramping up from o to 100. “Cas, you did not ‘let’ her get sick. It’s not your fault—”
“What?” Dean asked, his face pinching. “Why?”
“Cut the shit, Castiel,” Anna snapped. “You know it’s true. Nothing has been the same since God left. Heaven has been in a state of disarray; we have no father, no leader, no hope. We’ve been operating under the guise of obedience and faith, but under the leadership of those who don’t understand anything about faith or God.”
“Sammy’s never paid for services like that,” Dean revealed, grinning. “He’s a wholesome boy.”
The pressure of her orgasm as it built around his cock was enough to push him over too. Dean curled his hips back and forth, fucking her deeply, their flesh clapping together, his free hand sliding up from her hip to push her leg up over his shoulder.
Castiel tilted her head back, resting it on the door. In a sigh, she whispered, “You’re going to be bad for business,” She tilted her head down and leaned forward, half an inch away from his lips. “I can tell.”
“I didn’t tell you because then you’d stay,” she admitted, her typically powerful, deep voice now quieter and weak. “You’d stay out of a sense of responsibility, and she’d be a burden. I’d be a burden. I never wished to be a burden to you and… I did not wish to chain you to a new human relationship with your daughter that you wanted no part of. Or, I’d tell you she was yours, and you’d leave anyway. I wasn’t sure which prospect hurt more, so I decided I would simply keep her to myself.” She looked up, her nostrils flaring, and her eyes looking defiant, despite how sad she fucking looked. Dean’s heart dropped. “And I was angry with you for everything you did. I wanted to punish you, in case there was a small chance you wanted her. Or me.”
At a crossroads, Dean’s chin trembled and he leaned forward, pressing his forehead to her freezing cold one.
However, Dean grinned crookedly and entered deeper into the room, dropping down beside Castiel and folding a leg under himself, their thighs brushing. “Don't worry, I know what you meant. But, yeah,” Dean said hoarsely, lowering his eyes to Jack as he reached over to pet his back, “everything’s been totally fucked this weekend. The hospital called on Friday night—”
For weeks he’d tried to escape. Every time that door opened, he threw himself against the guards and tried to run. But this Heaven was laid out differently, and no matter what door he tried, he ran into a brick wall—sometimes figurative, but often literally. He had grace, but it was captive as well, unable to activate past the warded cuffs around his wrists. The first time he’d escaped, before he was front-heavy and riddled with nausea, he’d managed to knock out one of the escorts meant to take him to an examination, and he’d stolen the angel’s blade. He’d tried to break the warding by crashing the blade down on the iron cuffs, but all his attempts resulted in nothing more than a few sparks and ultimately, being thrown back into a wall by whatever magic kept the restraints on his body—
“Same, little brother.”
“I usually arrive here sooner. I’m usually early,” Cas admitted, staring down at Sam’s hand as it lowered back down onto the counter. “The bus was late that day. Perhaps if it had been on time, I could have stopped the Zchitri. It’s easy to kill; death fire or a silver knife to the heart. I’m human but I can still fight, I’m still useful for something. I just...wasn’t useful in time.”
Jimmy stared at her from the top of the steps. “Jamie… Castiel wasn’t ever anything to be frightened of. I don’t want you to think I was, like, scarred. The memory of Cas was always a comfort to me.”
“I...I just thought we might talk, y’know? To get the inspiration flowing--”
For the first time since they’d locked eyes at the Nine Inch Nails show, Castiel felt relaxed, and they shared a laugh.
It was so much worse coming from Dean’s mouth, and Cas found his face scrunching up, tears sliding down his face, and he raised a hand to press over his mouth. He felt fucking pathetic, but the pieces of his broken heart were cutting at his insides, leaving him aching.
“Yes, sir,” Dean growled as he yanked Castiel’s pants down until they were bunched under his ass, exposing his eager hole to the copier room’s cool air.
Dean was so tempted to ask her to stop, but he’d already been a dick about the period thing. Instead of making one more thing for him to be guilty about, Dean asked tightly, “Did you have protection?”
“What a shame. ‘Cause the whole ‘dead husband’ thing is really starting to bum me out,” she muttered. “What do you want, dork?”
“Wow, Cas,” Dean chuckled. “You’re a fuckin’ alien.”
“Where’s Sam?” Castiel whispered, standing just out of view of the audience in the left wing. Her eyes scanned backstage, her brow furrowed.
The two of them stared at each other and suddenly, Dean became almost entirely aware that they were standing too close. Personal space that he’d warned her about many years ago was basically eradicated and Dean immediately understood that he didn’t care. He fell right into those blue eyes and unlike before, when she was an angel and it was wrong, when he’d try to climb and crawl back up, to fight it, now he just freefell into them. Fuck it, they were human, they were equals--
With an eye roll, Jamie hung up the phone. She threw it onto her couch as she made her way to her back bedroom. While her dumb little brother was probably going to fall asleep in front of the TV with the remote in his hand, she had plans to go curl her hair, put on too much lipstick, and dress like a person who was ready to make bad decisions.
“What plans?” Dean asked sharply, his brows knitting together.
Of course she had. This was Cas. Protector of literally everyone.
“I promise,” Dean lied.
“Reapers were alphas or betas,” Castiel added, shrugging a shoulder and unscrewing his water bottle.
A silence hung between them. Dean stared at her and understood this wasn’t the first time she’d uttered those three words to a man, but he wanted things to be different with him. Dean swallowed hard and then replied, “You choose.”
Dean smiled, his heart aching. “He kicked ‘em right in the ass. He rebelled, helped us save the world.”
Anna’s knowing smile spread and her head tilted a bit. “I have known Castiel for millions of years. I was their commander for a least five-hundred thousand of those years. I’ve seen them injured, and pained, and joyous. I’ve known them to sympathize for humans, certainly, but they always followed orders.” Anna nodded her head over to the warding. “But I have never seen the mighty Castiel look at a single human like they look at you.”
“Does your father live in Kansas?” he asked, before he could blurt out something depressing about his own childhood as he had a habit of doing. Dean had proven so far that he didn’t scare easily, but still…if he could hold back the weird for a little longer as much as he could, maybe Dean would want to see him again.
Sam and Bobby’s mouths dropped open.
“What, Winchester?” she asked, managing to sound bored and annoyed all at once.
Ezekiel bared her teeth. “Savages.”
“You, uh, leaving the festival soon?” Dean asked.
“No,” Dean interrupted, raising a palm. “She was of great help. I just needed to ask her some more questions. She’s not here, is she?”
“It’s a work in progress,” Dean grumbled over his shoulder, colour tinting his cheeks. For people who loved to tease him, everyone was doing a splendid job of pretending that they didn’t know Castiel had already been here.
In classic Castiel fashion, she swept away without so much as a goodbye. Dean rolled his eyes and followed, quickly falling into step with her.
“How do I get in?” Pamela said, shaking at the door knob. “It’s locked.”
?!” Naomi choked out, gesturing to the boys. Her eyes were wide, and if Dean didn’t know any better, he saw fear in them. “How did you resurrect them? How…”
“You were upset when we came in, Cas. Wanna tell me what really happened?”
this. He hated that his brother had to be all gentle with him and shit. He missed when they could just scream at each other until someone stormed out and then came back later with pie...or salad, depending on who’d been right.
Again, the world seemed to stop and sound seemed to fade away.
“Oh, shut it!” Charlie whispered harshly as she ducked into the window she’d no doubt escaped through. He followed her in, tumbling into a dingy studio that was filled to the brim with props, costumes, fabric, bags of glitter, and every type of hat imaginable. Dean paused, swirling his finger around the room; “You work here? I...never thought to ask where you actually did your work. Why did I never think to ask about your studio?”
Again, the crowd laughed and the Winchesters glanced at Charlie, who still looked stressed about not being able to talk with Castiel. She did a double glance at them and explained distractedly, “Castiel is not
“I played an instrumental part in keeping you and Sam free from your destinies. You were meant to be Lucifer’s vessel,” Castiel said to Sam. He turned his eyes on Dean and they took on a very distant quality. “And Dean, you were to be the true vessel for Michael.”
“You think that’s why she didn’t return your calls?” Sam asked, his voice sounding a bit downtrodden. “Do you think…”
“Yes, you did. I felt your pull even from Heaven. I felt you demand my presence.”
Her hand slid faster over Winchester’s long cock, twisting over the head. She had a sample cup poised.
… no, no, no, they weren’t in love. Sam shook his head, trying to clear it again.
Stabbing at some boiled carrots, Dean snorted. “Tell that to the hangover I had yesterday.”
Anna stopped in front of him, her eyes curiously sweeping his face. He expected her to ask why, or Hell, even to hit him, but instead, she just nodded and smiled in a melancholy way that made his breath catch in his throat.
Tuesday morning. Fuck.
The gruff man lifted the counter and stepped through the exit. Once it clicked back down, he turned to them and snorted, putting his hands on his hips, his worn brown vest tight around his middle.
“Shall we watch the play?” Charlie asked, raising her eyebrows. “It’s the last scene and then it’s curtain call. Might as well see it while this place is open. I can’t imagine the Duke will want to continue funding it, and Naomi—”
Castiel wasn’t sure what to say again, so he just reached out and took Dean’s pinky finger between his two fingers, and he shook it a bit. The peculiar little touch had Dean blinking and finally turning his gaze to Castiel, his brows doing a little twitch of confusion.
“That’s terrible…and the other ‘ordeals’? Did she ‘fix’ you then?”
“Do you think it had anything to do with that light?” Pamela asked.
“It’s not true,” Sam replied back sharply, his fingertips pausing on Dean’s back. “You know it’s not true. Dean, don’t listen.” His brother leaned in, brown hair falling into his hazel eyes that were full of conviction. “Castiel loves you, okay? Everyone here sees it, they all know it. Her heart belongs to you, don’t forget—”
“Yes, but you didn’t—” Cas cut himself off, the good-humour melting off his face, leaving behind wide eyes and a mouth shaped like— “Oh.”
Dean turned in surprise, raising a brow as he saw two cold beers in Sam’s hand, one half-extended out to him. His lip twitching up into a small smile, Dean nodded, waggling his beer in the air. “Yeah. Kinda nursing it a bit, but...yeah, I got one.”
But if there was any time to air out anything unspoken between them, it was now.
Chuck swiveled his body and pointed at Dean. “A-And you—”
“I mean, like, he’s tall. People call
for some reason, his nose burning with the smell of rain and roaring black clouds of thunder—
Dean’s teeth peeked through his dry lips as he smiled and he gestured out beside the funeral home vaguely. “I know I haven’t introduced you to a lot of people that are important to me, but I’m gonna start today, okay? Can I introduce you to someone really important to me?”
Daphne wept to herself for few long moments, then she whispered, “You had those male fertility tests still in the medicine cabinet, C-Cas. I—”
“Dunno what you mean,” Dean said, looking away, drinking from his glass. He knew exactly what was coming next, his face heating up to match the realization.
Castiel coughed into his sleeve, blinking tears of exertion from his eyes as he looked over his shoulder.
And Castiel was magnificent up there.
“Cool,” Dean said matter-of-factly. “It’s settled then. You and me, Tool. Kansas City. I’ll have to double check, but I think it starts at eight on Friday. I’ll drive.”
Kevin slid off his stool and curled his finger at Dean. He unhooked a set of keys from the wall behind him and lifted a section of the counter up, passing through to the other side. He jerked his head at Dean. “Come with me. I got keys, I’ll let you in.”
It didn’t escape Castiel’s notice that no one acted oddly at Dean’s (second) coming out, and apparently, it didn’t escape Dean’s notice either. Castiel watched Dean glance around, like he was waiting for a blow, but when none came, a lingering glimmer twinkled behind his green eyes.
Yes, yes, yes...” Castiel agreed, her fingers trailing softly over the Duke’s earlobe. “We can explore anything you want tonight, Duke. We can explore for as long as you want, wherever and however you want. I am yours, surely you must know.”
“We did it, huh, Dean?” Sam said suddenly. “We’re in Heaven. For real.”
Meg was one of them.
“...I mean, I see how she’d fall for you,” Ash continued on, sucking on the cigarette and blowing it out in a stream through his nose. “You got that rugged, handsome artist thing going—”
Sam smiled a bit. “Much easier than it is here, I’ll bet. We just kind of...pair up with whoever we want?”
The feeling of hands on his face and carding through his hair, and the feeling of being held, seemed suddenly very real and very fresh. “I think so,” Dean shrugged. “My brain was comin’ up with all kinds of weird shit.”
She looked up at him, watching his lips with intense concentration, her brows furrowed.
They stared at each other.
Under the blanket, Castiel let himself sniff wetly and allowed a tear to fall. It dribbled down the side of his face as the truth crashed down on him in the light of the crushing realization; Dean had used him. Dean got what he wanted by giving Castiel the illusion of being wanted and relied on. God, he felt so stupid. He should’ve just listened to Naomi from the start.
“Why?!” Dean croaked, straightening his clothing and looking around at the forest property and the beach visible through a large parting in the trees. “I told you I wanted to—”
He came to a hard stop when Castiel stared at him coolly and stepped back the second he drew too close. His hand, which had been outstretched for her, dropped to his side.
Castiel rasped, his breaths loud in the hallway that was otherwise so silent they could’ve heard a pin drop. No one spoke. No one breathed.
They broke their kiss to stare at each other. Castiel lay panting on the bed while Dean kneeled on the floor, his lips smudged with lipstick, his eyes dark with lust. He undressed her with his eyes before he physically undressed her, shaking fingers pulling the thin straps off her shoulders slowly. The dress puddled around her waist and hips as he tugged the material off just enough to get access, one strap still around her arm.
Dean tapped his toe and sang under his breath, and as the minutes ticked by and Shirley Manson paced the stage, her red hair bouncing in a pin straight ponytail from atop her head, the tension in Castiel’s shoulders drained again.
