“John, there’s something ... I should say; I-I’ve meant to say always and then never have. Since it’s unlikely we’ll ever meet again, I might as well say it now.” Sherlock looked to John, saw him staring expectantly back at him. Out of the corner of his eye he could see Mary, her red coat accentuating her pregnant form, reminding Sherlock of everything John wanted and could have, just not with Sherlock. Sherlock wanted John to be happy, and he knew that he could not do that. So he changed his mind at the last moment.
“Good morning, Doctor Watson,” she chirped. “Need a lift? Weather’s appalling.” John wondered just how she knew this. Her perfectly manicured hands where constantly glued to her phone, and her eyes seemed to do the same.
“John. You’re alive. You’re real.”
John's hand moved to Sherlock's shoulder, just resting there easily. Their eyes met, and they burst into laughter once again. There was nothing more important to each other than their friendship. Despite everything - Sherlock's fall, their adventures, John's wedding, Sherlock's amnesia - the one constant had been their friendship.
“Sherlock is actually a girl’s name.”
John could practically hear the cogs whirring in Sherlock’s brain as he regarded Sergeant Carter, and he longed to hear what deductions Sherlock had made about this woman that made him smirk like that.
John flopped down in his familiar armchair as they returned to 221B. There was only one way to put it: John was exhausted. He’s forgotten just how taxing their cases could be. He took big gulps of air, trying to wipe the smile off of his face – a girl had died. But just seeing Sherlock go through the motions, to watch him as he deduced, analysed and solved each of the individual puzzles in his brilliant mind, before finally settling on a conclusion. He was always one step ahead of everyone, and it always left John feeling completely awe-struck.
He finally placed his violin down and listened. He couldn’t hear anything from the room above, for John was in a deep, dreamless sleep thanks to Sherlock’s unbelievable music talents – John’s words, not Sherlock’s. He checked his watch, 6am.
After a long pause, Sherlock replied, “tea would be lovely, Mrs Hudson.” His voice sounded strained, the stresses of his new, adapted life were catching up with him.
John was still laughing to himself as the BBC news came on. He waited patiently to hear what he’s been waiting for. Sure enough, 15 minutes into the programme, the newsreader began on the story.
“I’m scared that sooner or later, Sherlock’s going to want to leave me again. That he’ll pack up and leave without any warning, just as he did before. I don’t want to get close to him if he’s going to put me through that again, because once nearly killed us both.”
Sherlock dismissed this, thinking that John had been too busy concentrating on the write-up for their most recent case – which John was halfway through. He turned his face away from John, fearful of his unconscious reactions to John’s closeness revealing too much. John smiled sadly and moved away, up to hi bedroom, leaving Sherlock alone in the living room to try not to think about how good it had felt to have John so close to him, and how much he had wanted to close the distance.
“John?” He turned to see Mary looking patiently at him. “John, did you hear any of that, sweetie?” John shook his head, he did not have the energy or motivation to open his mouth and create words.
“When Sir Boast-A-Lot woke up in the care of the court physician, he could not remember where he was, or what he was doing there. He had no memory of his recent life, he didn’t know who anyone was, or even who he was himself.” Once again, his face turned sad, and yet it still felt mocking, patronizing.
“John, we are prepared for every possibility,” commented Mycroft, who seemed to be reading John’s thoughts. “The flat has been entirely searched by my own team, nothing has been found. We have also paid off all known dealers in the area to make sure that Sherlock does not get his hands on anything stronger than the painkillers prescribed to him by the hospital, which we will rely on you to issue to him in the recommended dosage.” John turned his head towards the floor, breathing in deeply. The amount of trust that everyone was placing in him was touching, yes – but also incredibly daunting.
helping John to plan his wedding. Like he was just a shell that had been running on auto pilot. But he never worked on the first Sunday of the month. Never. He continued to vanish and return to the living world late into the evening. The next day, Sherlock would be back to normal.
John gently took hold of Sherlock’s arm, and turned the underside towards the light so he good get a better look. There they were. The tiny, pink, tell-tale specks. Track marks. Sherlock made an effort to turn it back, and then hid his face in his shoulder, obviously ashamed.
“It can’t be. Impossible.” This muttering came from the figure behind her. Anderson stood with his mouth open, eyes wide like Sally’s, his voice barely a whisper. His paperwork slowly slipped from his fingers and fell to the floor.
Something clicked in Sherlock's mind.
"I wanted to find the man who killed her, killed my beautiful Victoria. I worked tirelessly, examining all of the evidence. My deduction skills were already well developed, but then it had a purpose. I solved it in two days and he was arrested. Mycroft made sure he got a life sentence. It didn't feel good, John, because at the end of the day Victoria was still dead, and so was our child. And
“Brother mine-”
The silence resumed.
“Sherlock wouldn’t.”
it would break him, and you
Still, he could never claim that their lives were boring.
Jesus, how had he not seen the signs? He was supposed to be a bloody doctor for God’s sake.
"You underestimate me, Alvarez, if you think that I believe my life is anything of value."
"Truly, I am sorry, John." Sherlock's voice was barely louder than a whisper, but it didn't need to be any louder. He wasn't addressing a large audience, this was a moment shared just between the two of them. John felt the heat prickle at his eyes, and before he knew it, he was wiping the hot tears from his face.
“I love you.”
you even imply that I abandoned my marriage!”
To forget the threat of (the apparently very much alive) Moriarty. To forget the horrible experience that his best friend had had to endure. To forget that he was now a widow.
“Mmm…” The doctor mumbled, eyes still half closed.
“Yes Jason, I will marry you.”
And then it hit him.
"It was my fault." The voice was so quiet and timid that Greg could hardly believe it was coming from the man next to him. Sherlock had taken his face out of his hands, which were now resting of his knees drawn up to his chest. At full height, Sherlock Holmes was often rather intimidating. In this state, he couldn't even intimidate a mouse. His eyes - usually so analytical as they took in every piece of information available to them - were staring at nothing, completely blank. It was disconcerting.
John was lost for words. It was a good few seconds before he thought of a suitable response, enough time for Lestrade to order his third drink, whilst John was still only halfway through his second. "Wow, that's not something you see everyday."
John visited Sherlock the following morning at 221B before his flight to Antigua for his honeymoon. Sherlock was in his pyjamas and blue silk dressing gown.
John smiled down at her, and received a wide, warm smile in return. He turned and walked back out of the lab. Suddenly the light didn’t feel as bright, and harsh. They were just lights, and they couldn’t hurt him. He walked out of the hospital feeling like a completely different person – like the old John Watson, from a time before the fall. He pulled out his phone and hailed a cab. Once he was sat comfortably in the back, he gave the address.
"John?" He called again. Still no response.
“Indeed. I found Anderson’s ridiculous expression to be highly amusing,” said Sherlock, a smile spreading widely across his face.
"Oh." There was no other reaction John could think of. Mary smiled up at him and closed her eyes. She looked peaceful, happy, completely and utterly perfect.
"I find myself rather lacking in enthusiasm for my experiments without you here to scold me."
Down?
There was nothing to move. All of Sherlock’s belongings had remained in the flat, untouched. John knew that he would have secretly missed the place. He caught the detective running his hands over what seemed to be completely ordinary, even mundane, everyday objects. But John knew that Sherlock wanted to take in every detail about the flat. The brief, yet unexpected separation from 221B must have affected him. John wasn’t stupid. He knew that Sherlock had a heart, it was just too often overshadowed by his mind.
"Why did you leave the wedding early?" John stood with his arms crossed over his chest and stood there. He was not leaving without an answer.
“Amazing?” he breathed, and John could see his eyes moving under their lids, and knew that Sherlock was in his mind palace, trying desperately to seek out the memory of this encounter. Clearly he could find none, because moments later, his eyes snapped open and he deposited the ring back in John’s hands. “Yes, well. That’s not what people usually say.” And with that, he swept out of his chair and towards his bedroom. The door slammed behind him, separating Sherlock from the rest of the world. John and Mycroft made no attempt to follow him. Sherlock need the space and time to himself. His mind palace would be in a state of disarray, and despite how Sherlock treated things on the outside, it distressed him greatly when the inside of his head was untidy and unorganised. Sherlock relied on the organisation of his thoughts far more than anyone knew – anyone other than John and Mycroft. So they left him alone.
“Good deduction, Sherlock.”
Scarlett xx
On the night where he’d run out on John, after having remembered the waltz that he had apparently written for John and Mary for their wedding. The pain had been god-awful – it felt like someone was using a blunt axe in a vain attempt of slicing his head open. He’d needed something – anything – to distract him from this torturous pain.
Sherlock touched his cheek where Mary’s hand had just been. But made no other movement, or sound.
What Sherlock had failed to observe, was Molly Hooper stood in the doorway. She often walked in on Sherlock talking to what she assumed was his imaginary John. Although she only heard half of the conversation, as the other half was being played out in Sherlock's mind, but what she heard broke her heart. Guilt tugged at her heart, like a rope wrapped around it and squeezing it as tightly as possible. She was partially responsible for Sherlock's anguish. She dug out her phone and quickly typed out a text to the least used number in her contact list.
“We got married in Mycroft’s office, and just to annoy him we’d hired this rock band to play. It was hilarious watching his face when we showed them in. It was a perfect day. After we married, we moved into our own apartment on Baker Street.”
“Yes.” She shot John a cheeky wink as she held out both of her hands. John took them and allowed her to pull him up. He wrapped his arms around her and held her tightly. She returned the hug, relaxing into John’s embrace. John kissed Mary’s head, before pulling away.
"John?"
“I don’t
One of them would have a family, but two of them would fight for it.
“Sherlock, you owe me nothing, I should have talked it through with you before, but I’ll admit I was expecting a different reaction.”
And just as John was sure Sherlock was about to unleash his deductions upon her, Sherlock said something rather unexpected.
He'd missed this. He'd missed laughing and joking with Sherlock. He'd missed the easy banter that just seemed to flow easily through them.
“Well if you’d bothered, you would have seen that before you strided,” for Mrs Hudson felt that ‘walked’ was not the right word for Sherlock, “into his life, he had nothing. He did absolutely nothing with himself. He was just trapped inside his head, all day, everyday, very much like you. And even more like you, he was lonely, although he would have never admitted that to anyone.”
Months passed and they took on more cases, argued more about how leaving a set of lungs in the fridge right next to the leftover stew is completely unhygienic, ate more takeaway and just living their lives. But John didn’t seem to go out on any more dates, meaning that he was around Sherlock almost constantly, which made it increasingly more difficult for Sherlock to avoid the problem he was facing.
"Making things up? Me?" Sherlock put on an over-exaggerated expression of shock, even bringing a hand up to his chest and contorted his face into an affronted expression. "Why on earth would I do that?"
“For now, we must let them alone. It’s unwise for either of us to be in direct contact with Sherlock, and he will most likely not let us contact John either.” Mycroft thought momentarily. “I will employ the services of a mediator. Someone close to Sherlock enough for him to trust them, and someone who was equally in the dark about Doctor Watson’s state of being. Hopefully this person will allow us to communicate to Sherlock and John, and will be happy to help us talk him round.”
Knowing by now John's proffered method of dismantling the network Mycroft's team had been prepared to set off much earlier than planned. If they hadn't, John would most certainly have died. They reached the warehouse, first taking out the assassin, judging their position by how John had fallen, before moving to the rest of the organisation in the building. Three members of the team attended to the unconscious army doctor as the team leader contacted Mycroft to inform him of the possible fatality, moving him as quickly as possible to outside of the warehouse.
He didn’t know how long he was there,  but after some time had passed, John felt arms around him, pulling him in. He smelled the honey shampoo before he saw Mary’s face, and allowed her to envelope him in her arms, as for the second time in three days, John completely let go of any self-restraint he had managed to hold onto.
"John, this is Elizabeth Miller."
Luckily, it seemed like Sherlock did exactly that.
When John Watson’s best friend was lying unconscious in a hospital, he hated them. The lights were too bright, the machines were too loud, but more importantly, it had been three days, and Sherlock was still unconscious and the doctors who had been assigned to him had not done a thing about it.
Right, now to establish his condition.
John watched, fascinated at the different emotions passing over Sherlock's face as he finished speaking. Wariness that Moriarty's web was larger than he'd first anticipated, anger at the fact that he had not realised this, excitement at the prospect of the game being back on as Moriarty's still out there, somewhere, pride and elation at John having reached the same conclusion as him, and fear. Fear of what?
"I'm sorry, John."
John was probably going to kill him. Actually, John would definitely kill him if he knew Sherlock was thinking about it. But Sherlock needed to keep John safe, and he was sure that Moriarty would use John to get to him. It had worked once before, and if he did it again, Sherlock would give Moriarty anything he wanted to keep him safe.
Imaginary John sat opposite him, in the chair that had once belonged to his real-life counterpart.
They continued the car journey until they reached the polished front door of a rather large, white, marble house. John turned to pick up his shopping, but Anthea gestured for him to leave it in the car and proceed into the house – at least that’s what John assumes from the tiny flutter of her hand in the general direction of the shopping and then beyond the door.
It's pouring...
“Sure. Thank you for today, I needed it.”
"Well, I hear hospitals are good for that sort of thing."
“So, what did you do?” Asked Wright, still standing.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sherlock, we’re not doubting you, no-one here is.” John glared at Lestrade and Anderson as he spoke. Sherlock’s eyes were still tightly closed as he focused on John’s words. John knew exactly what was happening in Sherlock’s head. His mind palace had turned into a rooftop, Sherlock was stood on the edge. “Sherlock, it’s okay. The past is the past. Moriarty is dead and he’s never coming back.”
A thousand memories coursed through his mind. Walking into St Bart's lab and meeting Sherlock. Running after the cab after their dinner the next evening. Watching Sherlock about to take the pill that could end his life, and then ending that which threatened it. Moriarty in the pool, John telling Sherlock to run, to save himself. Laughing like naughty teenagers in Buckingham Palace, stealing the ash tray. He heard Mycroft's voice.
But now was not the time to think about his complex relationship with Mycroft. Sherlock had somewhere to be.
Just before opening the door, Sherlock turned back to John. He quirked an eyebrow.
The silence was more relaxed on the journey home. One thing for certain was that John’s panic attack had left him exhausted. His breathing was getting heavier and slower as he sat in the back of the taxi with Sherlock. Sherlock could see John struggling to stay awake out of the corner of his eye, but he didn’t mention it. A comment from Sherlock was probably the last thing John needed right now. Their surroundings were growing darker as the late afternoon moved into evening.
Sherlock moved to get up from the bed, probably to begin pacing again like he had been doing this morning when John woke up with an uncomfortable ache in his neck as a result of the awkward angle he'd been sleeping in. Damn the uncomfortable hospital chairs.
The voice, low, with and Irish accent, instantly made the hairs on the back of Sherlock’s neck stand on end. He felt as if his heart had momentarily stopped, and his lungs were no longer functioning properly.
"Everyone's been telling me I need to get out more and actually eat so etching decent, and is way we'd be killing two birds with one stone."
“Yes, but-”
“It’s okay, Sherlock, it’s okay. You’re okay, I’m here.”
John had left him. He was alone.
Mycroft’s face softened at his brother’s threats. Sherlock had always made threats like this, even when they were growing up, but he had never followed through on any of them.
Mycroft never got the chance to tell John that Serbia was the last piece of the puzzle.
Molly flushed bright red and averted her gaze.
"It's alright, John. It doesn't matter."
He pulled out his phone, sending Molly an update on their situation. A tearful phonecall later from the pathologist, Mycroft succeeded in reassuring Molly that everything would be absolutely fine. It would just take a little longer than expected.
"I know. I know."
He just sat there for hours, watching Sherlock. John was just about to drift off to sleep – for he had slept very little over the past days – when he heard the quiet moan and the rustle of movement coming from the direction of the bed.
Sherlock, John and Lestrade walked out of the side door and into the empty, grey corridor. Cameras flashed eagerly behind them, trying desperately to get one last photograph of the detective and the doctor.
John looked around him. The weather did seem to be worsening, his clothes already sticking to him from the dampness acquired by the drizzle, and in all honesty, he didn’t think that the carrier bags would make it all the way back, and he’d rather not risk it. He gave a reluctant sigh and ducked into the car. He placed his bags between Anthea and himself. She would not mind. John knew from experience that these trips tended to proceed in complete silence. The car was warm and comfortable, a combination not often provided by the standard London taxi service.
John felt his heart racing, and suddenly his throat felt dry. He knew that Mycroft would never phone John in favour of Sherlock unless something had happened to the youngest Holmes. Even Lestrade's eyes grew wide at the mention of Mr Government.
"Oh, Sherlock."
Once you have illuminated the impossible, whatever remains must be the truth.
“That’s a load of rubbish.” When Sherlock looked down at Molly, he could see the absolute sincerity in her eyes. She truly did not believe him to be a sociopath, and for some reason, this made him smile internally. Externally, he was still trying to breath like a normal human being, and failing. Molly grabbed an extra stool for him and forced him down by his shoulders, once again proving that there was more to the pathologist that meets the eye. She allowed Sherlock a few moments to collect himself before speaking again.
Lestrade drained his glass again, then turned his attention fully to John. "Not a clue,” he answered, shaking his head. His expression turned thoughtful, and then he averted his eye, choosing to look at his feet as he continued, “but if I have to put money on it, I'd bet my entire salary that it was you."
"Yes, well, your opinion hardly matters anymore does it?"
“It's not a favour, Sherlock, I wanted to.” They held each others gaze after John said this, letting the words drift between them, and John felt the rift that separated them close slightly. Sherlock held out his hand, and John took it without a moments hesitation.
"Fine, as you're being so uncooperative. You jump, or he dies."
Sherlock clapped his hands together, steepling his fingers as if in prayer and tucking them beneath his chin as her whirled in a circle, coat floating out gracefully behind him.
A tall, well dressed man answered the door. He hurried John through the door, eyeing the water dripping from him wearily. He was directed into the hall, and was left to the side of the room, away from the carpet. John laughed to himself at the obvious discomfort on the face of the man stood in front of him. He was reminded of the way Mycroft had first surveyed him, with caution and subtle distain, as if John was some disgusting creature that a cat would drag in through the door.
"He wasn't here John. He's dead. You watched him die. He wasn't here. You need to get a grip, John. He's dead and he's not coming back, and you wishing that he's still alive isn't going to change that."
“You were there,” John managed to choke out, the emotion he was feeling threatening to overwhelm him and close of his throat completely, “because you are my best friend and I asked you to be my best man.”
“It’s not a bother Mrs Hudson. I want to thank you, really. You’ve been so good to us over that past few months, and… well… you saved my life more than once.” John looked away, a mixture of sheepishness and embarrassment. Mrs Hudson took John’s face in both her hands.
"I'm a doctor, of course it worries me. It's not healthy."
He would have liked the sunflowers best, Sherlock thought. They would have reminded him of happiness. He would have wanted people to be happy, not sad or worried.
“You know exactly what I mean, Sherlock.” John had gone from caring doctor and flatmate, to commanding soldier within a matter of seconds. This was one of the many things about John that fascinated Sherlock. How easily he could abandon one persona for another, as if he was shedding his skin in favour of a new one. This often happened during a chase, when one or both of their lives were in danger.
They sat for the rest of the evening drinking tea and talking. It was as if nothing had changed, as if Moriarty had never existed, as if Sherlock had never faked his own suicide, and as if John had never tried. They allowed themselves to lull into a relaxed state, laughing as Sherlock made ridiculously extravagant deductions to entertain their guest. He was in the middle of a particularly creative one about a young man passing along under the window, before Mycroft stepped through the door.
“It’s nice to have a reason to smile,” John confessed to her. He felt completely at ease with her, and that he could tell her anything. She seemed to take care of Sherlock and himself better then they did. A sudden idea struck him.
“John?”
“I also don’t panic in the middle of a case. Clearly I’m breaking all sorts of rules today.”
"What's the extent of the damage?"
"Don't be, John. I'm sure this has been extremely hard on you, not to mention everything else." Once again, Sherlock was the one to pull back. But this time, he couldn't meet John's eyes. "John, I'm so sorry about Mary. I truly am. She was a remarkable woman."
After three days of continuous tapping on the tables, the arms of the sofa, even on his violin as he was that morning as he sat in his armchair, thinking, holding onto his violin, something happened that Sherlock was not expecting. He had just finished his tapping…
"27, married," John groaned internally, "part of the forensics team going by your overalls, Lestrade's using you as a replacement Anderson today after I refused to work with him," Sherlock noted.
“Are you sure about this Sherlock?” Asked Lestrade, looking doubtfully at the taller man.
“Details?” Asked Sherlock as all three of them began walking towards Lestrade’s office. They walked quickly, falling into an easy rhythm down the corridor; no-one met them on their way.
When the simple verse was over, the laughter started up once more. What was happening? Why was his own mind torturing him like this?
Sherlock paused. “I know,” he finally replied, “I know.” He did know, she’d proven very useful when he wanted to when he needed to…
It would happen even if they weren’t at a crime scene. They would catch each other’s eye across the flat, and then John would initiate the smiling. They sat closer together in cabs, and causal touches were becoming more and more common – a hand to the shoulder as they doubled over laughing, a gentle scrape of fingers as they passed each other cups of tea. These moments of intimacy just built on Sherlock’s affection for him. And if Sherlock was honest, it was all rather distracting. It was reaching the point where it was almost intolerable. Sherlock wished he could just have it out and tell John exactly how he felt.
"It's fine, Sherlock. It's completely understandable."
“The face Lestrade! Think! Once again you see but you do not observe! It couldn’t be more obvious. If you know the killer, they’re statistically more likely to stab you in the face than any other body part. So, we know he knew her. He knows her, and yet her stabbed her face after she died, which rules out any of her family. Family have a tendency to just let things lie, a friend perhaps? Maybe, but considering the state the murderer left her face in, it’s more likely to be a previous partner, bitterness is a strong motivator, but so is love. Both come into play here. So, a bitter, previous partner, a previous partner who just happened to be in her flat at the time of death. A previous partner who happens to work at the docks, considering the data we recovered from his footprint. The shoe’s well worn down, manual labour, obviously a man, the possibilities of a woman having size 12 feet is highly unlikely. He’s 5ft 11inches judging by the length of his stride and the angle at which he appears to have put his foot down. The traces of mud, small particles and clears signs that it was once mixed with water, clearly worked in a place with silt, so a river, the Thames being the most likely, considering that’s the river closest to where her body was found. So, we’re looking for a man who works at the river, most likely a dock because of the manual labour, who has previous connections with this girl who’s 5ft 11inches. Lestrade is that enough for your men to be going on or do I have to spell it out further to the morons?” He never seemed to stop for breath. Sherlock moved as he spoke, pointing out the details to Lestrade as he deduced with such ease.
The John he saw was alive - just. He was obviously unconscious, but breathing. A monitor to the side of him helpfully tracked his pulse in irritatingly high-pitched beeps that jumped at a constant rhythm, but the rhythm was slower than it should have been. There were several tubes protruding from him. One was coming from a bag of muddy-red coloured liquid - a blood transfusion. One was a clear coloured with a machine attached so you were able to adjust the dosage if they needed to - some sort of pain relief, probably morphine. And one tube was inserted into his mouth and most probably down his airways to help him breathe. He was deathly pale, nearly as pale as Sherlock himself, which was no mean feat. His eyes were closed, and judging by the dark circles beneath them it was the first time they had been in a very long time. He was so much thinner, looking even more like a corpse than the image of him broken and bleeding at the foot of the hospital. He was wearing the standard issue hospital gown, but Sherlock could clearly make out the bandages underneath, wrapped around his chest. He was covered in the faded blue, green and yellow of old bruises, all of varying size, and there were several scars along his arms that John didn't have which were a sign of recent combat, self defence perhaps.
The press conference regarding Sherlock’s return had been a total success. Everything had gone according to plan.
"Now, John!"
“Shut up you git.” John shoved Sherlock playfully, still ginning at him, before turning to leave. He was halfway up the stairs before Sherlock called to him.
In his catatonia, Sherlock imagined a world where John wouldn’t turn away from him, where he would come back and not leave, he would stay and Sherlock would be loved. But his fantasy turned dark as John turned bitter, resentful of Sherlock keeping him from his wife and child, hurling abuse at him, telling him that he should have stayed dead, turning everything to black. Sherlock knew that none of it was real, it was his mind rebelling against himself, reminding him that he didn’t deserve happiness, that John would never love him the way Sherlock loved John.
“Sherlock, I think we need to let go of everything that we’ve been through. We’ll let go together okay and unfold out new future with each other.” John looked away as his thoughts came tumbling out of his mouth. He chose to look at their joined hands instead. It was somehow easier to talk this way. “I know we’ll probably drive each other utterly crazy, and break each other’s hearts, but I’m prepared to fight for us. When you get sick of the everyday predictability and you’re bored to tears, when you never want to hear my voice. Even if you tell me to walk out the door and never come back, I will always fight for us, and I will always stay with you.”
"John."
Mary.
“Any ransom demands?”
You just read my mind, Dr Watson. I love you – Mary xx
“I often am.” Neither did the detective.
He felt nothing but self-loathing. He wanted to tear his own skin off, wanted to disappear. He wasn’t worthy of John’s care and attentions.
She’d shouted, she said some things that she regretted, mostly about John always prioritising Sherlock before his own wife, resulting in her completely breaking down into sobs. The tears didn’t seem to ever stop. But John understood. She felt like he was abandoning her, choosing Sherlock over her, always Sherlock. And part of him knew that she was right. Mary was always right. Not in the same way as Sherlock, but she was always right, right about John. She knew how their relationship worked, and she knew that John would not rest until Sherlock was better, even if that meant leaving her behind yet again.
Sherlock filed this away in his mind palace for further analysis later. Now was not the time. John had just entered the kitchen, standing in the middle of the doorway.
Sherlock could hear Jason snort on the other end of the phone, the sound made Sherlock’s lurk quirk up in a quasi-smile, before succumbing to his memories.
He had heard this tone of voice many, many times. It was often because one of his experiments had gone awry, and Mycroft, being the only family member Sherlock had ever listened to, was always the one to sternly tell him off. Sherlock had admired his eldest brother so much as a child that it bordered on idolization. He would listen to every single word Mycroft articulated, and whatever he said must have been true because it was Mycroft who said it. Mycroft protected him, guided him. Sherlock made him promise when he was about four years old, that he would never leave. Mycroft, still being young at only the age of eleven, promised.
John and Greg had been stunned into silence.
He pushed through the double doors that segmented the corridors in the hospital, treading an old and familiar route to Molly Hooper’s lab. It probably wasn’t the best equipped lab in the hospital, but Molly allowed him access to it on a regular basis, she’d even provided him with a key card. He wondered, fleetingly, whether John had also been given a key card, but soon dismissed these thoughts. Thinking about John Watson was sentiment, and Sherlock needed fact.
Mrs Hudson sat chatting away. It was near 10pm, and she, John and Sherlock were sat around the table, each with a mug of tea in their hands. The flat smelled of tomato and garlic, strong but not overpowering, and pleasant to the senses. The fire was lit in the living room and there were several candles on the wooden table in the kitchen. As John had been setting them out, Sherlock had made a passing comment about 'not being your date', which had resulted in John laughing so much that she felt like his sides were surely going to split, as Sherlock looked on, a deep, amused chuckled escaping him.  The atmosphere in 221B was relaxed, welcoming and warm, reminiscent of the time spent there before, the three of them around the table. Although, in previous times, Mrs Hudson was the one fussing around the men, at least one of them sporting an injury sustained during a case more often than not. This evening, however, the tables had turned.
John considered going after him, but was not sure that the action would be appreciated, especially after hearing what happened the previous time and then told in no uncertain terms that he was never to bring the subject up again. However, John felt that someone should be keeping an eye on Sherlock, and who better than Big Brother himself. John’s lips quirked into a smile reminiscent of Sherlock’s as he internally praised himself for his excellent Orwell reference.
It was times like this where John allowed himself to forget.
“Okay, we’ll talk.” John agreed.
“You died to save him.”
He’d told them exactly what happened, explaining that Moriarty was the liar, not Sherlock, and how he knew that Moriarty had planned for Sherlock to die. They all listened in awe as Sherlock told the same story as he had told John back in Baker Street – word for word, if John was listening properly.
"Sherlock-"
Sherlock considered the question momentarily before answering. "Both." John looked momentarily confused.
"You're a deduced, Sherlock. Deduce." Mycroft watched as his baby brother tried to piece it all together.
Sherlock stayed staring at John’s face for hours, until the sun began to rise through the window. Just as London was waking itself back up, did Sherlock allow himself to relax, and eventually his eyes closed and he succumbed to sleep’s clutches, slumped over the bed, safe in the knowledge that John was alive, and still grasping John’s hand within both of his own.
"It's not my sanity that's in question."
John smiled as he watched her, before picking up the three mugs, all still half full, and moving them back into the kitchen.
“Oh.” John had been planning on twisting the truth just to get out of there sooner. He did not like the tension between Molly and himself, especially as neither of them had really spoken to each other before. “No, I haven’t been having the easiest of times getting used to it.”
The encounter in the cab had shaken Sherlock, that much was obvious. The colour from his face had gone, and John had noticed a slight trembling in Sherlock's hands as he told Mycroft and John exactly what had occurred in the cab, with no detail left out. Sherlock had been directing his tale mainly at Mycroft, which made sense as he was the only one in the room who could do anything to Moriarty whilst at the same time remaining inside the boundaries set in place by the British laws. Sherlock wasn't an idiot. He knew exactly what thought's were going through John's mind at that precise moment.
he thought,
"Ah, shit." Staying alive. Of course. Moriarty. "Damn it I'm sorry, Sherlock. I didn't think before I spoke."
One thing’s for certain, Sherlock thought as he listened to the rhythms of John’s breathing and his own heartbeat, he was not leaving 221B Baker Street any time soon.
Sherlock was so easily disarmed by Mrs Hudson’s voice. It had such a motherly tone to it, a quality his own mother had never possessed. She smelled faintly of flowers, mixed with the smell of baking and tea. It was a comforting smell to Sherlock, he associated it with being home, being safe and loved. She was his real mother, in many ways. She kept him out of trouble when he first moved in, and no matter how pleading, or angry, or sulky or even rude he had been to her, she had never given him what he wanted. She helped him kick the addiction more than that damn rehab centre ever had, and for that, he owed her his life.
It was Sherlock, again, but he wasn't looking at the camera. He was looking down at the woman in his arms, the same woman from the first photo. His arms were wrapped around her waist, and her hands rested on top of his, showing the matching bands on their left hands. The woman's hair was up, a small flower nestled into her curls. Her dress was cut off at the knee, a classic fifties style, all lace and flared out skirt. The lace spread from the dress to her shoulders, running down her arms in full length sleeves. It suited her. It suited him. They looked like a beautiful couple.
"I've got the scarf, the coat and a curly wig..."
"And I don't expect you to, Mr. Smith." The older Holmes frowned lightly, never taking his eyes from Armand's, "If you are not helping others as I see, and acting by your own ideals without minding who you step over... I believe we have nothing else to discuss."
, about the dangers to come if they continued.
"Sleeping... sleeping is tedious, John." Sherlock took the phone from his pocket and started to browse over police station's sites, probably searching for a new case.
"It is incredibly soothing."
“John.”
The old man smirked and lifted himself from the chair.
There were no more words between the two men. Sherlock placed back his wig and his moustache, opened the door, winked at Armand and left.
“Hm?”
"Nnno." John smiled wider at the answer. This kind of intimacy felt extremely odd but extremely good. "Did you like it though...?"
"Almost eleven." Sherlock smirked. "I'm sorry I woke you up."
Sherlock was actively panting now, each exhale a little moan of uncontrolled laughter.
"So, this kid called us
"No! No... I mean, I was waiting for you, so we could order together..." She was aware of how nervous she was. She had to fight the urge to stand up and disappear.
"Yes, we all are in private spaces to do whatever we want."
"Gregory."
The main entrance was a white door made of wood, surrounded by little windows and no security cameras in plain sight.
The doctor walked away and Sherlock's eyes roamed, looking everywhere. Little white letters were floating around everyone. Without John there he felt incredibly lonely. As if the whole place was settled in another planet. At the thought, he felt something moving in his stomach, a knot, maybe he had too much beer.
Sherlock lifted his eyes, he was naked in Angelo's bathroom. He looked at himself on the fogy mirror; a bit of blood was still on his temple but it was so faint that he didn't pay any attention to it. He recalled the nightmare after the first time in his bed with John. He recalled the things he said to Moriarty on the roof top, the same things that were said in a dream invented by his own mind, by his own fears.
The situation was awkward; they both knew it and they both felt it. Even when nothing had changed there were many things unsaid, Sherlock was still haunted by his dream and his own personality and logic. And there was also the foreign feeling of home, the feeling of... John not only getting into his mind, which he was already used to, but also getting into his skin now, into the deepest parts of his mind. He really couldn't place a name for all this. His mind palace was destabilized and his body refused to do many things.
John stretched his finger and pressed one before the record finished. Sherlock smirked at that.
“What is it? Rosie?” he asked, getting closer to Sherlock’s phone only to find a message from Craig: ‘
"Sherlock..." John lifted himself over his elbows and gave a small kiss on the pale neck. "Do you want... whatever it's going to happen...?"
Sherlock smirked above him, curls falling over his forehead and the fist over his chest was replaced now by his palm. John's heart skipped a beat and started to pump rapidly again. The detective stared down directly into John's eyes, and his smirk was slowly replaced by a serious expression, the face John already knew, it was normally used when Sherlock wanted to say something nice, even though most of the time it didn't come out the right way. Sherlock inhaled deeply and then exhaling slowly he let out a quiet "Thank you."
It was great.
“You were saying…? Also…?”
Sherlock just looked at John, stopping his chewing. Searching for an expression, anything. When John's face remained expressionless, he asked "What did you answer?"
They walked in the dark around the backyard, the smell of freshly cut grass surrounding them. They looked at the ground as they walked, crouching a couple of times to take samples of the soil, grass, a few leaves here and there, all neatly stored in small zip bags. Sherlock stopped in front of a small, green plastic garden shed and asked to take samples of the fertilisers and disinfectants stored there. He made quick work of it with surgical gloves and small bottles, inspecting the contents, lids, and the shed’s plastic door.
“Both.”
It was easy to turn into William Scott for a second time: slicked hair, thick jeans, jumper and a shirt different from last time.
He was walking to the stretcher when John entered the room, he had a tray in his hands and was about to place it on top of the small table when he turned and saw Sherlock.
As he looked at John sleeping he felt alone. It was better this way, he knew. Alone would be protecting him from now on. There were endless possibilities from now on, once he encountered James Moriarty. And sadly, alone is what would protect John Watson as well.
“Obviously it’s an…” At John’s face, Sherlock frowned, “...attack?”
Sherlock let out a little snort at that. He hated that hat, too. Armand continued. "You asked me, if I thought the arousal state was controlled by the mind, remember?"
"Perhaps you should open the windows, smoking in here was not a good idea after all, was it?" the bold man stood up and opened the window behind Mycroft's desk, a rush of clear air entered the office. This was the last time that he would talk to this man probably, he knew what was coming. "Better?" he asked.
"I'm incredibly thirsty..." Sherlock complained. John snorted, his lip curving up lightly. "And I need you to tell me everything you know, John."
Sherlock was observing, as always; he could see all of the changes on his friend's face as the rest of the night passed. John's sleep was not relaxed before but after the kiss, John seemed a bit more settled for a couple of seconds. Sherlock couldn't help but wonder what was going on, even if he had a little faint idea.
As the three of them walked, corridor after corridor, Sherlock opened room after room, they reached for the stairs that would lead them to the first floor. Lestrade took another gun from his belt and handed it to Sherlock. The detective just took it and nodded. They descended the stairs quietly, each with a gun in hand, prepared for anything they could find.
“John,” Sherlock sighed. “What you did before, with the text…”
“Why?” John got closer.
’ and the way it was phrased… he took a deep breath and scrolled down on the results. Nothing.
"No. I don't understand much, but according to a couple of books, it's a
"What are you up to, now?"
"How come?"
When he was fully inside the flat, he sighed and walked to the skull on the mantle. It was staring at him with his immobile grin. He lifted it upside down and smiled when he found his secret cigarette, scotched at the bottom, near the forehead. He took it off and felt it in his hands. He moved it around his fingers and smelled it, taking a big gulp of air. A couple of seconds later, he was throwing it in the trash, crashed, but he didn't light it.
"Shut up..." he managed to growl between clenched teeth.
"He isn't very clever after all... nobody sent him to check on your sister's doing! Now, talk to Sebastian, let him know what we agreed and you're out."
John's stroking on his hair and scalp was very soft now, Sherlock realized John was asleep, almost going into REM state, according on how his pupils moved below his closed eyelids. The light that came from the street lamp and his own dilated pupils caused by the darkness, were more than enough to have a good look at the doctor above him. His expression was peaceful; his hands were warm, like they always were. Sherlock just stared at him from below. He also noted that there was light stubble growing on his chin. His head was tilted precariously, almost hanging from his neck. His chin almost touching his chest; Sherlock knew the position would be a pain in the... neck, later.
"Sherlock..." the moan that escaped his lips brought him back to reality. He wanted – hoped – that Sherlock would come into the bathroom and would... no. Maybe this was for the best. This was
**..**
, as John used to tease him when he wore that pose.
"Explain yourself."
received at 12:20.
"Really, close your eyes and imagine me."
Sherlock didn’t cry but he just inhaled and exhaled profoundly. It was the breathing pattern John had whenever he woke up from a nightmare, like the pattern Rosie had when she was about to cry for food.
's brilliant beta-reading, this fic would make your eyes bleed. Literally. So thank you, dear, for pointing out mistakes, for teaching me and being so generally amazing!
John wanted to say something but he failed. After Sherlock's words, all of his doubts were thrown out of the window. Of course; he could never leave Baker Street, he could never leave Sherlock.
Sherlock nodded and then got out of the car. He was the first to get into their flat - John and Martin were exchanging numbers in the car - and suddenly he felt ravenous. He walked into the kitchen and saw a big leaf of aloe vera on the table and a tray with sandwiches wrapped in plastic. His heart was in his throat when John’s words resonated in his mind
Sherlock rose on his feet and paced to the shelf to arrange the books John had put there minutes ago. John followed the movements of the younger detective. He saw how the robe waved behind him at his fast moves, large hands and strong arms taking large piles of books, not before ordering them alphabetically... Sherlock was oblivious to chores, but the few times he had to, he would do it meticulously; he arranged his clothes by colour or use, he would sort his books following the pattern: topic, author and alphabet.
It was late in the evening and they were walking back to Baker Street, the street was deserted at this hour and extremely cold. They'd had a few beers, and Sherlock had eaten a normal meal, for once. John was surprised at how he had had to force Sherlock to eat all of the carrots on the plate, and had even given a little scientific explanation of how those vitamins are good for your health. John also forced Sherlock to eat at least some of the beef and tomatoes because he had found that his blood was
So Sherlock did, actively panting now, hips still rolling subtly again, and again, his eyes never leaving John’s face. John’s hands massaged from his arms to his hands, eyes stubbornly on front, face a bit closer to Sherlock’s chest. He massaged from hands and then stomach again, fingers crooking at the sides, rubbing his waist, going up, up.
In the cab, he had gone through his contact list and had deleted one by one, he had passed over John's speed dial and Mycroft's. His phone was only left with those two contacts. Every time his phone had asked for a confirmation to delete the contact permanently, Sherlock would smirk and say, almost an audible '
“When Mary was alive,” John started and Sherlock stilled, his back to John, who continued, “You remember when we were following her GPS… I had left my wallet here and when I returned…” John cleared his throat, “Mrs Hudson was in the kitchen... You just removed your shirt. You were usually so careful when I was around, but you weren’t with Mrs Hudson.”
his mind screamed.
"I was with Mycroft." Was the mumbled reply against the wool of John's jumper.
Once the shirt was disregarded on the floor, Sherlock made a mental map of John's sensitive spots over his torso. In his mind, a lot of white lines moved everywhere and he started by the place he was left; his neck. He moved his lips softly over John's Adam's apple and then brushed down to John's nipples. He flicked his tongue over the right one and soon did the same with the left one. John tossed a bit but he didn't wake up. He moved then his lips to the side of John's ribs, he licked there and sucked a bit whilst his finger brushed the other side softly. He noticed how his own body responded to that and he was a bit astounded on how all of his actions on John's body seemed to concentrate on his own cock. He was hard now and he was barely touching John.
be actually developed, and Toby goes into surgery tomorrow.” Sherlock made a small pause and added, as an afterthought, his face now completely turned towards John, “Everything is completely legal, John, even if Abby goes to prison for murder attempt by poison, the money is still rightfully earned.”
Abby was about to get up when Miss Eldridge’s voice came up.
John smiled gently at him and answered with a small and truthful "You."
"John, I need you to tell me everything Mycroft told you two days ago." At that, John frowned and tried to remember.
"I never believed we had something to discuss in the first place." He snapped and turned around.
They were more than ten blocks from the abandoned facility, and the urban area was about to end. They had to get there unseen. Vegetation had made its way from urban and the facility, probably thanks to the contaminated water, there were a few vehicle's tracks forming a path there, and the few houses and rotten flats were abandoned as well.
"You have to tell my brother to stop participating in any case Scotland Yard asks him to. Especially if the case goes against my client's wishes."
“You crazy man.” John started to write in his notebook again.

“You like me being dramatic.” As soon as the words were out of his mouth he looked down and cursed internally.
And then the nightmare.

John was baffled; he was there, in Buckingham Palace, talking about sex with... Mycroft Holmes. Well, not actually
"Hang on... Sherlock, you can only get those supplies on a hospital, with an ID, a certificate, a signature, a doctor's-"
“Who’s-” Sherlock didn’t finish his question as John caught his attention and pointed his thumb at the man currently in the driver’s seat. Sherlock just mouthed an ‘
John snorted and had to put his hand over his mouth. Chloe’s soft ‘
There was a flash in John's look, confusion and soon a frown followed.
"Well..." Mycroft said, "...if Sherlock can have his... little
"What about the new case? What could he possibly
John whistled. “So it
“Yes. I know. Let me…” John’s jaw moved, the same movement he always did when making a decision. Sherlock waited but turned his torso away from John. “Tonight.”
"Yes, Sherlock?"
"Mm?"
After some minutes passed, she started carefully. "You want to continue?"
It made the doctor to come back to reality. He felt the sticky liquid on his hand and he noted how some of it had somehow landed between his and Sherlock's chests and stomach. He was feeling his own climax closer. He, not even caring of wiping his hand, positioned it over Sherlock's over his own member, stroking him again, steady and firmly. Sherlock complied the silent order and, without thinking about it, squeezed one of John's buttocks in his large hand. John opened wide eyes at this, but had to bury his face in the space between Sherlock's neck and shoulder. That action brought new sensations to him, making him moan deeply. Sherlock kissed his shoulder, working with his lips, tongue and teeth every bit of skin he could reach. Slowly, he moved his lips from John's neck to his jaw, he licked there and soon he was nibbling at John's earlobe.
"Your alibi." Sherlock got closer to him with a smirk and out of nowhere gave the tall man a firm but not painful blow to his stomach, pinning him against a wall roughly. "And stop following me!" he added loudly now, each word spoken through clenched teeth. Louis fell over his knees with a huff, coughing and cursing. He was about to return it, more out of habit than rage, but something made him stop. He lifted his head and Sherlock was nowhere to be seen. He frowned at the sudden blow but soon he was smiling. "Alibi..." he repeated as he got up and proceeded to take the attacker to a police officer.
His phone remained on his lap, below the table, his thumb ready to receive another text. Sarah continued "Thank God you could make it today. Imagine! Even without the multiple collision we were short in staff..."
"Oh look! It's the freak."
to remind his brother what he had been telling him for years when Sherlock repeated the same question he had been asking for years as well. Sherlock had noticed that time something he was always curious about and watching from afar: the family's grief for someone who had just died. '
“Oh God… and to make me reach that pitch…” Sherlock’s hips rolled with purpose now, his eyes on John’s face, helpless. “That pitch of inebriating sensuality…” John’s hands pressed hard on the bones, he got a bit closer, so the fabric of his jeans was rubbing against the side of Sherlock’s thigh.
, Sherlock." Armand lifted himself from the chair, he took the card from Sherlock's fingers and put it in the detective’s shirt breast pocket. Then he moved his lips closer his left ear, his hand cupped the opposite jaw. Slowly, he moved his fingers to the back of his neck "I've wanted you since the day I read the blog..." at this, Sherlock opened wide eyes. The young man continued, "I can tell you like the attention. You get upset 'cause no one seems to take in consideration your analytical reasoning..."
He was looking down when Sherlock took off his coat, jacket and scarf, tossing the whole lot towards the chair nearby. John looked up in order to see Sherlock in a white shirt; it was clear he wore nothing underneath.
“He was in love with her?”
"Thank you, Sherlock..." Armand said, smiling, "but my goal is fulfilled. Now my other goal is to step in front of my father at the same level." The younger man removed his hair falling over his eyes, his hand resting on his nape and looking at the floor. "It was all your and Dr. Watson's doing. I did a money transfer to you account. I know you won't mind."
When there was no answer, Sherlock smiled, looking at the phone as if it was John Watson.
"Sherlock?"
Sherlock groaned.
“The new one, yes.”
“Touch him like what?” Sherlock’s voice was soft and his hands were back in front of his lips like a prayer, he had a soft smile, like John did when testing the waters approaching a woman.
John got closer, Sherlock passed him the card.
Mrs Hudson was not trying to be quiet as she cleaned the few cups from last night in the sink.
John knew Sherlock was curious about the blog, even if he would never admit it. So he just waited there. John knew he would leave a message. After a while of fast typing, another loud click was heard in the flat, this time coming from Sherlock's laptop. John pressed F5 and read the new comment.
“Does it have to do with the fact that right now we’re being recorded? Only images, not sounds. Thankfully,” Sherlock said as he pulled his jumper over his head. He started to unbutton the shirt and congratulated himself for the idea to wear a vest underneath.
But there was still something nagging in his head, something small that had been implied so many times by so many people. He couldn’t avoid it now, could he? Could Sherlock? But then, this was a case. Would this have happened if there had been no case?
The detective rose up slowly supporting his palm on the armrest closer to John, his arm making an arc over the doctor's thighs. The action made the hand on his head to fall to his side and the other hand to fall over Sherlock's lap. He observed then John's peaceful expression; he heard his slow and soft breathing. He wasn't snoring, credit that to the current position, Sherlock made the mental note to let him know that tomorrow.
"Of course."
.' He rolled his eyes again.
He stared at the cold dark liquid in his cup for several minutes. He noticed that his hand was trembling for the way the liquid moved inside there. He was feeling something very close to rage... combined with the still lingering betrayal sensation.
“I mean… we can take the chair downstairs to Mrs Hudson’s garden and open the hose, let it dry a few days outside.”
"Oh I work just fine..." Sherlock curved his lips quickly, "when my mind is stimulated, as I told you."
“Well, we won’t be hearing much from him now.” John got up from his chair and headed to the kitchen. “Thanks for coming over. Are you going to Slaney’s tomorrow?” he asked over his shoulder.
" He took a deep breath and continued "I thought it was only my father and now I know it's his sister as well... I just... feel... ashamed, like... I feel like shit." He sighed heavily, cleared his throat and then took the kettle to pour water in the cups.
To prove his point he grabbed John’s smaller hand in his and squeezed. John’s hand slid in between longer fingers, the sound of the oil between their hands seemed loud in the soundproofed room and Sherlock’s heart gave a serious misstep at this.
one is a lot less comfortable than this one. If you want me walking and moving in a while leave my arse where it is, thank you.
"Sherlock…"
“And later you didn’t.”
“They’re using stimulants in order to get the strongest reactions from clients,” Sherlock added.
Sherlock sighed, his thumbs stopping. “Waiting. Let’s wait for this case to come to an end. Let’s wait if you want... even without the… stimulants.”
"I'm sorry. What?"
John’s name was repeated between moans into the safety of the fabric. Sherlock could feel a drop of sweat and saliva sliding from his neck and it felt huge, like a tongue.
“Your software. I’m a programmer,” he lied with a casual smile, adjusting his glasses (how were people able to wear them without feeling their weight during the day, was certainly a mystery left for later).
“I was going to say that you’re like a chameleon when you want to be… you can grow that moustache again. If you rather.”
He tried to classify all of that, but he felt at lost. It was as if he wandered around John's room and the sensations' room and the physical contact's room all by separate. He stepped in the middle of it and felt like screaming. He wanted to shout badly. So he did. He shouted in his mind; he was frustrated and confused. Right in his mind palace, his cry echoed around John's room. He knew that if he moved all of the files from John's room to
to do, John?"
Sherlock finished the button John had missed and removed his shirt completely. John was being observed, and he was observing back the process of that. Sherlock still brushed his fingertips around his shoulders. He was clearly trying to deduce every scar he was seeing. He moved his hands to the doctor's upper arms. Then he pressed his elbows' bones, touched all the way down to his wrists. He ghosted his fingertips over John's hands, following with his gaze every place his hands were touching. He moved his hands then to John's abdomen, recalling what Armand said over the phone
was the voice in his head, apparently it was little white-John,
guilty ones to fall this time."
to let us know that you actually want to find an ideal partner, you don't want to take it lightly like most people do. You are waiting for… how do they say... Mrs. Right. Which of course, could be an issue from youth, most likely a girl, or a boy for that matter, who used the word 'love' with you, when you knew they didn't feel it... probably she... or he, even tried to get physical with you, making you actually think the way you do now about sex. Am I wrong."
"Man... I mean, how could I not?"
"Don't worry, Greg."
“I told you I was coming here for massages,” Sherlock’s voice came out nervously, trembling, and the air turned completely different when John bit his lower lip and gave Sherlock a very obvious once-over.
"Yeah?"
John observed Sherlock for a while. The way the man stretched in the couch was feline, his arms and legs were long and well formed. He remembered his comrades in the army and smiled. Sherlock didn't have the contour of army guys; he was more…
John was quite worried they were going to be kicked out, or if her positive attitude and acceptance towards Sherlock were going to change but then, even in the darkness of the place, he could clearly see her blush and hear the clearing of her throat. She supported herself against the trunk of the tree and covered her face with her hands.
"May I come in?" Asked the man, when he saw the light was bothering him so much.
John stared at the notebook for a couple of seconds and then glared at Sherlock.
"You were serious, then... I was right."
Sherlock was close too, he didn't take his finger out, but instead he moved it in and out for a while. It was a whole new sensation for Sherlock as well, his mind stimulation to such level that he could not associate which was his pleasure and which was John's. He supported his face on John's shoulder, his mouth open again, heavy gasps leaving his lips each time he rocked over John.
“Sherlock, I’m not going to give
Sherlock looked around the room frantically, completely awake now. "Where's John?"
sent at 04:07.
Once alone in there, he stood long minutes with his palms over the sink, unable to look at the mirror; he didn't want to look at himself, he only glanced shortly and noticed the red of his cheeks and then again, he was incredibly embarrassed. One could think that being alone those things didn't have to happen. Why would he be embarrassed when no one could see him? He had no idea, but he still was. His heart rate incremented as he stayed there; his hands still with a firm grip on the edge of the sink. Sherlock was in his mind in repeat mode, he could clearly hear the moans, the panting, the demanding and the naive insecurity. The rush of power he felt over the younger man for the first time, but he still let him lead the whole... session. Even with those feelings, he felt like they were equals for the first time. Sherlock would respond just like him to his stimulation and that had him... fascinated?
Even though John was used to Sherlock being close, always around good fifteen centimetres between their faces, this hadn’t happened in a while. He was tempted to take a step back, but he stood his ground, his eyes inevitably going to Sherlock’s lips and back to his eyes.
"We wait!" Sherlock looked around frantically, searching for a spot with good view to wait for the boat. According to Lestrade, a new boat should be arriving today, but there were no signs of any arrival or sailing. It was probable that the boat would arrive anytime soon, since the weather was getting uglier. "Follow me!" Sherlock screamed to the doctor, who followed him to a medium sized steel container with lots of nets and boats' supplies. Surprisingly, it was neat inside.
Around four o'clock in the morning Sherlock stood up and walked to the door, Mycroft following close behind.
“Yes! Yes, that’s Elsie Patrick, alright. This only proves he’s after Abby Slaney. I bet he didn’t like this photo.”
“Love is a vicious motivator,” Sherlock said absentmindedly. John just lifted his brows.
"...when you say
"I'm really sorry, John, but I am...
it would be a whole portrait. But again, Armand wasn't an enemy... Armand just wanted to help.
Oh, and the violin.
"Your client." John never changed his innocent expression. Mycroft sighed exasperated. '
received at 15:39.
"You're warm now, though."
Sherlock smirked, pleased. John just clenched his brows together, trying to follow the code.
“God bless, Mrs Hudson,” Sherlock breathed, his whole demeanour never showed how fast his blood was pumping. Oh, how he loved this. 99%.
; he wanted to observe John feeling
John glared at his phone. Sherlock's malicious grin was plastered all over it and despite himself, his lips curved up into a little smile.
Sherlock lost track of time as he felt, without a word, John filling him. The doctor's movements were slow and considerate, Sherlock held John's stare as he entered him, a look that spoke of friendship, of trust, a genuine look. Sherlock's raw expression made the task seriously difficult for John until there was a moment in which Sherlock couldn't keep it. His eyes rolled back in his skull as he moaned loudly, almost dramatically; his jaw opening in a deep gasp once John was completely inside him.
“I was just using my resources,” Sherlock said. He was so pleased with John’s remark he felt the need to cough or scream. He wanted to squeeze something with his hands. He was nearly mortified when he felt his heartbeat going faster as John’s eyes were still following his every move.
Guys. This has been long months of writing. I can't even start to thank you all for the support, for the favourites, for the followings and specially for the reviews. You can't even imagine my huge grin every time I have one.
"That factory used to have a fine lab. I recognised the address Lestrade gave us." Sherlock whispered. John felt the voice resonating in his head; the detective had gotten closer to look outside the window above his right shoulder. "I used to go there sometimes, since they had better equipment than Bart’s." John's heart started to jump inside his chest at the closeness, Sherlock continued in the same whispering tone, he didn't want the cabbie to hear him, "there, I could replicate the reagent that can be precipitated by haemoglobin alone... you know, that glowing blue substance used in forensics, also known as luminol."
John opened the door to 221 at half nine. Mrs Hudson was watching that old karaoke show with celebrities which for some reason was half-hosted inside a car. He recognised a rerun that he had watched with Sherlock and Rosie with John trying to sing along to Elton John, Sherlock rolling his eyes at the questions that ‘
"A woman."
Sherlock smiled. “No.”
That particular little fantasy always made him smile. He had imagined John searching for him under every possible pebble in London.
Sherlock just rolled his eyes and muttered, ‘
Sherlock walked fast, his feet were taking him to Louis', the man from the homeless' gang, where he had left his coat, in the meanwhile, he took his phone and saw that it was a little after nine p.m. Then his thumb worked quickly over it.
his voice cracking up a little. He passed his legs over Sherlock's thighs and he supported his back on the armrest of the couch. He moved Sherlock's head and carefully positioned it over his chest. Sherlock shivered a bit more, his throat making a very strange and desperate sound.
I did laugh my as* off at the first chapter from season two when John screamed "HAMISH!" Talking about jealous!John. The writers of the show are geniuses.
"So, what am I then... a gigolo?"
"Why did you send that homeless gang?" Sherlock released his head and lifted his eyes to look at Mycroft. The older brother's face was only visible by the street light outside the window.
He didn't wake up.
"Sherlock! You left the plastic spider inside a
"And why is that?"
under Sherlock's eyes could even be the most insignificant detail to a normal eye. But under John's scrutiny, every little detail about his friend started to repeat in his mind; the jokes, the awkward moments, the constant teasing. He knew Sherlock had nerves of steel, but they kind of failed when there was a situation regarding human emotions. He had the tendency to lose his cool, like a few weeks ago at the pool. Maybe that was the reason he preferred to call himself a functional sociopath.
“I –”
Sherlock's chest compressed but he couldn't do anything. He just kept walking.
“Okay,” her little face had a frown so profound John was worried her face was to keep on growing that way.
He didn’t like those times because he never knew what to think about afterwards, panting and looking at the ceiling.
' Chemical defect presented in most of the humans; in the losing side because love usually always blocked reasoning and logic, making people just lose it.
He took his shirt and trousers off, immediately getting in between the sheets, sighing deeply. The images of Sherlock were vivid, tattooed in his retina. His ears could still listen to the throaty voice, his lips could still feel the warm breath whispering his name in the most erotic way he had ever heard. Not one of all of his sexual partners were ever able to do to his body what Sherlock did with only with two senses: sight and sound. John considered himself a man hard to please, and he often needed lots of touching and stimulation in bed. After Afghanistan, he actually thought he might never be able to feel any kind of sexual arousal anymore.
” as she touched his eyelids.
"Everything good, Marie." Sherlock sipped his coffee and let out a loud and satisfactory sigh. A soft chuckle could be heard from under the blankets.
"Sherlock…" John's voice was merely a whisper. Sherlock moved apart from John a little so he could observe the doctor's face. Slowly, Sherlock brought both of his hands to cup John's jaw and pulled him closer, closing the space between them.
"I'll... make sure to remind them."
Little by little though, Sherlock had grown so accustomed to his presence that he would never wake up when John was near, in fact, there were a couple of times when he was so deeply asleep that he wouldn't even respond if John shook his shoulder attempting to wake him up.
In 221B Baker Street there was Sherlock, quite amused, talking with John. The thought of having him on the other side of the phone was enough to put his mind at ease. He didn't know why – or how, for that matter - this game had started, but he was beginning to enjoy it. Sherlock heard John clearing his throat quietly.
Sherlock turned his head to look back and, from the corner of his eye, he saw the man now convinced
Sherlock ignored his teasing "if everything else is eliminated, I can easily suppose it's a set up, though I can't reach that conclusion yet. You took the information of the laptops in the facility as well, I know you did a backup, I know you."
"The game, Angelo! The game has just begun!" Sherlock exclaimed taking Angelo by his arms and giving this loyal man one soundly kiss on each cheek and he was off, entering a black car that was waiting for him outside.
"They left the carpet full of foot prints and different patterns... oh! And they call themselves criminalists!" Sherlock's eyes spotted a pile of dirt near the door, he collected a sample of it as well.
“I have no idea what you mean.” He knew exactly what Greg meant.
"What is it?" Sherlock questioned, taking the device.
"...photographs of whom?" Sherlock was asking his brother.
and tried to swallow around the glass of water. John never failed to surprise him with these little details. It reminded Sherlock that John was a soldier, a captain, a doctor and a surgeon. A person that always thought ahead, almost a strategist. John Watson may not solve the case, but these little details made the difference in a well-planned one. He had to suppress yet another shiver.
…" Sherlock had his eyes tightly shut; a pained expression on his face, his pulse rising visibly, panting lightly, lips were slightly apart. His chest rose and fell in a steady rhythm. The layer of sweat was thicker all over his forehead and a few drops trailed down his neck and disappeared inside his shirt.
"Yeah! Just family's interests on the way, but everything's fine. Thank you..." Armand let out a sigh over the phone and added "good night, Sherlock."
"Has he ever done
“Ages,” he sighed. He gave Sherlock a few friendly claps on his back. “If I ever knew I was going to bump into you again, I would’ve asked my nephew to make the code more difficult as a challenge.” He winked at Sherlock and smiled brightly.
Mycroft's words flowed into his mind, like sticky honey, and suddenly, he understood the first warning that was the stab in Sherlock's arm. According to Mycroft and calculating a bit, it was the time he had been a bit absent from their lives for almost a month before The Netherlands' case. It was the time, John concluded, in which Moriarty had been interrogated by Mycroft and he had sent the gang to warn him, to warn
!” and a little horse was dancing around the website. She snickered at the same time Craig said “Yes!”
From time to time, he would lift his gaze to look at Lestrade. There was something odd in his behaviour today, he seemed...
And the single phrase, screamed with a baritone, throaty voice still resonated around the flat.
"Alright." He sipped his cold coffee and moved his back on the couch, getting comfortable.
"Gregory."
"I observe, John, I don't need sex to obtain information."
“And I told you I want to help, didn’t I?” John got to his feet and walked over to his jacket. He picked something from his pocket and put it on Sherlock’s side of the table. “I have a colleague working at a cosmetic lab, Mike gave me his number. I asked him on the phone and went to grab it this morning before going to work. It’s their star product on scar removal, it even works on keloid scars which are the hardest to clarify. I thought…”
The two companions stood in silence, just watching the light reflect off of the polished surface of the grave. Just a hint of sunlight danced through the cloudy skies that were typical of an afternoon in London.
“Well, it was very convincing.” The two men chuckled lightly. John drained the remainder of his tea, checked his watch and reached for the television remote. He could hear Sherlock rolling his eyes. “Sherlock, if you’re so against watching the news, go and play the violin in your room.”
They only walked a short distance down the corridor before Greg pulled open another door and ushered both he and Sherlock though it into another room.
As the doctors and nurses surrounded Sherlock, John got pushed back, away form Sherlock. John could see the panic in the detectives eyes as he began to struggle against the help of the medical team. They tried to hold his arms and legs down to stop the struggling, but no the panic had really set him. John tried to block out the scream terminating from his friend, but he couldn’t, he just couldn’t. He pushed his way through the doctors and nurses, forced them to remove their hands from Sherlock’s body, and took both of Sherlock’s hands in his own. He could hear himself talking but couldn’t recall a word he said.
“Sherlock Holmes, you can’t just sneak up on people like that. You’ll make them die of fright.”
When they were alone again, John gathered his courage and took a deep breathe. He called Sherlock’s name and immediately had his attention. Pale blue met deep blue and an electricity crackled through the air, and John knew that this was right.
Sherlock Holmes was in love. And not just with anyone, with his best friend, John Watson.
to do with you.
"I'm not going anywhere, Sherlock. What brought this on?"
“It’s okay. It’s okay babe. I’m so sorry.”
Sherlock zeroed in on their joined hands and held on tightly. His eyes opened wide as if this simple act was the most fascinating thing he had ever come across. Eventually, once he was satisfied that John wasn’t letting go anytime soon, he moved his gaze from their hands to John’s face, which was settled into an expression of bemusement.
“Bloody ridiculous!”
Sherlock’s voice was quiet and weak, and John’s eyes immediately moved to meet Sherlock’s. There were tears gathering in his sharp, intelligent eyes.
"Not incredibly creative, or clever, but they were merely the muscle required for the operation whilst the mind behind this was sat comfortably behind a desk-"
"That's why you shut people out. You're scared of getting close to them only to lose them."
"He does, I'm fact, leave the flat, Detective Inspector."
“Why was I there? Your wedding? I don’t ever go to anything like that, so why was I there? Was I tricked, drugged, or just there to solve a murder?” In that moment, Sherlock had never looked so vulnerable.
He didn’t notice John cross the kitchen and reach him.
And that’s when Sherlock had learned of Mary’s tumor, and John’s attentions had been diverted elsewhere.
John reached inside his coat pocket and dialed the number for Mycroft. He swore under his breath as he did so. It pained him to resort to this.
is the point in trying to help you if it’s obvious you don’t want my help?” How dare Sherlock imply that he was abandoning him. How
“What happened Mycroft? Tell me from the beginning, and don’t be boring.”
The surgeon walked away after giving Mycroft the number of the private room John was being moved to, understanding that this was a lot for someone to take in nod understood if he didn't get a reply.
Sherlock stood there, eyeing the woman. Sherlock was impressed, but made no obvious sign. John could tell though, by the way he angled himself slightly toward her, and the corners of his mouth twitched up ever so slightly. Sherlock was hardly one for smiles and hugs, especially around new people. He buried his hands in the pockets of his coat, still watching, analyzing.
It was open on their first case together. ‘A Study In Pink’, John had called it.
“Well, I can’t deny I shouted. I was so full of emotions, and it just seemed like the logical thing to do. But In the end, I didn’t do any of that. I cried and I think I nearly broke his ribs when I hugged him. I guess- I guess I was so completely shocked, and yet overwhelmingly happy to see him, alive, breathing, existing, that nothing else that I wanted to say or do mattered.”
“We’ve got officers working on that now.”
Obviously he hadn't woken up, he was in fact still dreaming, and the lightness and dream-like state was just a result of him still being unconscious. Sherlock know that this wasn't real because inside the room, lying on the bed was John.
“This piece,” Sherlock didn’t turn around as he address John, nor did he lower his violin, “I don’t know it, and yet I hear it, every time I see you and your wife together.” He turned around to look at John, who had given up with his attempts to hide his emotions and slowly lowered the violoin until it was at his side, bow in the other hand. “It fills my head, my entire mind palace until it’s the only thing I can concentrate on. Why?”
"Thank you."
John couldn't get the words out. He simply could not explain to Sherlock what was happening, or how it was effecting him. Sherlock was the genius, surely he should be able to figure out what was happening without John to spell it out for him.
He was
He dialled the only number programmed into the device.
“Yes.”
Greg rose from his desk and made his way over to his two friends and sometimes-colleagues, leaving Donovan at the desk.
"That's not a valid answer."
If Mycroft Holmes had seemed terrified before, it had been absolutely nothing compared to the look on his face as Sherlock spat these words with as much venom as a man could.
Mycroft sighed. Clearly it was going to take a while for his plan to become effective. It was unlikely that Sherlock was ever going to come around anytime soon, and Lestrade was going to need time. But it was their best hope. The Inspector was a reasonable man, and if anyone could bring Sherlock to forgive his brother, it would be Greg. But it looked like there was a long road ahead.
John could see the amount of effort that Sherlock was putting into just one syllable. One of the machines attached to Sherlock began screaming in warning, alerting probably everyone in this private hospital run by Mycroft’s minions
They were all wrong. Sherlock had a rather large heart, but when you grow up in the Holmes family, sentiment is frowned upon, caring is not an advantage, and love is simply a chemical defect found in the losing side. Sherlock had always been on the losing side, and he had always been capable of love. He was cautious. He’d never expose his heart unless he trusted the recipient completely. Growing up in the Holmes family meant that he’d learned to trust very few people, and hence he never showed any interest in those around him.
Sherlock wasn't even speaking. That was what terrified Greg the most. The fact that the lanky, curly haired genius who loved the sound of his own voice more than his brother, was refusing to utter even a single syllable.
John didn't drink anymore than the two he had when he'd first sat down with Greg, who'd had significantly more than two, but years of endurance practice ensured that the man was very capable at holding his drink. The match that the whole pub had seemed so emotionally invested in appeared to be over, and the fans had trickled out slowly as he and Greg continued to chat about everything and nothing. Only a few people remained behind now, a few regulars, a group of men whose team had obviously been victorious - if their drunken rendition of 'We Are The Champions' was anything to go by - and himself and Greg.
"Uh uh, Johnny-boy. This is between me and your precious detective." He sauntered back to Sherlock, once again invading his space as he leaned up to whisper in his ear. "Here we go again Sherlock, surely you don't need it explained."
Two weeks away did not cause John to forget what he'd heard. He had definitely heard Sherlock tell him that his wedding had reminded Sherlock of his own.
The illogical, impatient part of his brain, however, wanted to scream at them. Why was Sherlock not awake yet? They had to do something, anything.
"Christ, Sherlock. I'm sorry. I'm so very sorry."
John made another mental note to show Donovan more respect.
John didn't think, he just moved until he had hold of Sherlock in his arms, pulling him into another tight hug. Sherlock returned it - hesitantly at first, as if afraid that John would break down at any second, but grew stronger as he realised he wasn't going to. It was strange for them to be so physically close in such a short space of time. This second time, however, they were not impeded by a hospital bed or IV lines.
Alone.
John let out a breath which sounded like a disbelieving laugh.
"One, I face Moriarty alone. It's most likely that he will be expecting me to do this if the last time we faced off was anything to go by-"
"Ouch. Ever think of being nice to me for once?"
Moriarty's face did not falter.
Sherlock didn’t get a taxi home. Of course, they were useful, but they kept you confined within a bubble, and if there was one thing Sherlock could not stand, it was confinement. It reminded him of his awful childhood – if you could call it that!
John couldn't help but feel a surge of pride at Sherlock's reply. A few years ago, he probably would have given a completely different reply. Moriarty took a step back at Sherlock's words, surprised leaked onto his face momentarily, a crack in the carefully maintained mask that not even John missed. But the crack was soon fixed, and his look of indifference and boredom returned.
"There is every point!" Molly's voice was loud, angry, and a little hurt. She shot him one last look of desperation before turning to help the others in their task. They all continued to push and shove at the door. Sherlock continued to watch them from his huddle on the floor.
"The one with the obvious over-eating problem?"
“It will be more than four years. I’ve known him for just over four years, and he has no recollection of who I am.” John did not remember crying again, but he felt Mary wipe away the tears with the cushion of her thumb, stoking along his cheekbones. Her own tears had spilled over, but John could not bring himself to wipe them away. He allowed himself to be entirely selfish for a few moments, before his mind turned back to the situation at hand.
"You've not taken any cases? For a year?"
“Oh my God.” The quiet cry came from their right, the sound seemed to catch in the persons throat, and the three men turned to see Sally Donovan with one hand clamped over her mouth, the other still hanging in the air, where her mug should be, except that it was not in pieces at her feet. Her eyes were wide with shock and terror.
Sherlock's legs moved without his permission, his body acting before his mind had had a chance to catch up. He had no idea where he was going, until he reached a closed door and his hand was on the handle.
Sherlock scoffed at John's words and turned his attention to the black and white wallpaper which cover the wall that Sherlock used to use as he wall of evidence. But there hadn't been anything pinned to the wall since John's death.
Mary was refusing to look at him, and this pained John more than anything. They’d already talked about it. Nothing needed repeating. She didn’t want treatment.
Sherlock had a case, and was continuing to solve it just as quickly and efficiently as ever.
They had agreed not to take on any cases – private or through the Yard – until they had settled back into normality. Sherlock had never liked being patient. For him it was an unnecessary characteristic, waiting infuriated him. He needed something, anything to distract his mind. Only John was the exception. Sherlock knew that John needed the time, needed him to have patience, to just wait, and help. John was the only exception to a lot of things.
"Yes you can."
The first thing Sherlock felt was sheer bliss, such a stark contrast to what he had been feeling over these past few days, this was it, the beauty of the end. But then came the overwhelming oblivion, and pain, such pain. He could feel his muscles spasm; he could feel his consciousness slipping away from him.
Love is giving them everything, despite having very little to offer. Love is willingness to sacrifice everything and expect nothing in return. Love is knowing that something that makes them happy is going to secretly kill you inside, and allowing them to do it anyway. Love is staying strong for them, even when you're falling apart.
He was chained to the wall at his hands, making any escape attempts extremely difficult. Usually in these situations, John was locked in the cells and no other attempts to restrain him were made. However, Alvarez was clearly not taking any chances. It probably didn't help that John had earned himself a bit of a reputation among Moriarty's network. Word had travelled fast of the nameless, faceless agent who was talking the organisation apart bit by bit. He was known to be violent, often losing his temper quickly, and leaving no survivors. If he was shown no mercy, John decided he was not going to give any. Besides, this way, there were no loose ends.
“Yes, sorry.”
Okay, I'll be over in 5 minutes - Molly x
"Mycroft Holmes?"
“It’s nothing.” It took barely any time for John to pack away the groceries. Mrs Hudson had got the vast majority of what they needed the night before, he just got a few more essentials, plus all the ingredients for the night ahead. He left them out on the side as a reminder to Sherlock that Mrs Hudson was coming over tonight.
John looked on fondly as Sherlock scanned the paperwork, his eyes moving swiftly across the white pages. He let out a contented sigh – highly inappropriate for the situation they were in. But he let it out nevertheless. Sherlock continued to look intensely at the words in front of him.
“Yes.” John replied truthfully. There was nothing else he could say.
Thank you for following this guys, I truly love you all from the bottom of my heart!
"No."
“Lestrade,” Sherlock greeted cordially as they entered the room.
Sherlock pulled back, shaking his head. His hands rested on John's shoulders. John's clutched at Sherlock's wrists.
"I'm sure you are aware that I do not comply with the wishes of drug lords."
“You’re leaving.”
Home. I felt good to say, and even better to hear.
"John?"
Sherlock shot John a withering look. "John, you of all people should know how much I detest repetition."
Fair enough, his friend was suffering, but that did not make it okay for him to wake him up at bloody 3am with his violin playing. He thought that he should probably be delighted that Sherlock was showing signs of normal behavior, but all John could feel towards the situation was irritation. Was it too much for him to get a decent amount of sleep? He made his way down the stairs, his annoyance growing with every step he took towards the music. He reached the bottom of the stairs and turned into the living room, about to give Sherlock a piece of his mind.
"You said Hamish."
Dare he say it, John thought Donovan might be jealous of the new Sergeant. After all, she had worked for the Yard for many years, putting in God knows how many hours and working hard. It must be difficult to hear Greg talk about someone so highly, despite only being there as short while when she’s been working hard for years without any mention of a promotion.
"Christ, I can imagine.” Lestrade gave him a sympathetic and very manly slap on the back, withdrawing to drain the rest of his pint. “Are things really that bad?"
“That’s not up to you, Carter.”
"Anything? Surely that's a lie. You must have been taking cases."
"I never went anywhere. I was always here. I just needed a little help."
"It would be infinitely safer for you if-"
Well guys, that's it! The end! Wow... I'm actually feeling quite emotional...
“Okay, I need all the information we have so far about the red-headed lady found in a skip. Have in on my desk in 10 minutes.” Lestrade gave his instruction to the room of workers. They all turned their heads at the sound of his commanding voice, but their eyes found the tow figures walking into the room behind Lestrade.
Moriarty began to circle Sherlock - who continued to ignore him in favour of staring at John in shock and panic - as a shark would when it came into close contact with its prey.
"John."
But John didn’t mind. The danger the adrenaline, the sheer absurdity was one of the things that had first attracted him to the tall, dark, brooding consulting detective. And now, here they were, 5 years later, each with a matching silver band on the ring finger of their left hand. Sherlock had indulged John’s needs for them to wear rings, because for John, it provided more evidence that he was Sherlock’s, and Sherlock was his, and nothing was ever going to take that away from them.
Something clicked into place into John's mind.
"What are you doing?"
been taken from him.
“Should I come and get you?”
“You make me sound like I’m an annoying, spoiled child.”
“I heard that John.”
John’s head snapped back to his friend. He walked quickly over to him, placing one hand on each shoulder, locking his eye with those piercing blu-green eyes. Sherlock flinched at the touch, but he didn’t pull away, allowing John to keep a firm grip on him.
“So, you’ve got questions.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"The Señor wishes to see you," the shorter of the two said with a heavy Spanish accent.
Carter turned to face them.
“Oh, for God’s sake. Make up your mind. Who needs me this time?”
“To the very best of times, John.”
John was utterly stunned as Sherlock’s words sank in. He had never realised how much Sherlock placed on John’s role in their lives. John felt rather flattered, and he could feel the blush slowly creeping across his face.
A wave of pain flooded Sherlock's mind, ice froze his veins and the air was knocked out of his lungs.
“My pleasure, Sherlock.” She smiled up at him, but made no movement to get up, leaving John to dutifully show Sherlock out of the flat.
“Of course, yeah,” John said, managing a smile.
he thought and his giggle ended in a loud sigh.
After the meeting they got into a cab... and John was finally able to concentrate on the case.
The scene she found was very picturesque; a semi dark flat, semi naked Sherlock over the sofa. John on top of him, one of the long arms up in the air, and John supporting himself on Sherlock's back. And to add a little touch, Sherlock's had a hard grip to one of the cushions next to him and he was somewhat panting.
"Sucked me, you know... oh God..." John fell back on the bed, his hand over his eyes, "I can't believe it..."
John scoffed. “Okay. How can she like Mycroft so much?” There was a small pause and then he added, “Not that Mycroft… after everything. God, it’s been years and I’m still surprised he insisted on having a nursery at his own flat.” There was the noise of water being poured into cups. “I’m not complaining, though. I doubt there is a safest place in the world…”
“Hear me out.” John came one step closer, stopping a meter or so behind Sherlock. Two more steps and he would be able to touch him if he wanted to. Their eyes met in the mirror. “You inhaled the same thing probably... you never wore a mask.”
of his arch enemy.
did not resist, as he usually did, but lay where I had pulled him, against my chest. And I
"Well I am craving for two things." Sherlock raised his brows and talked like it was no such a big deal. "First is tea and then..." he tilted his head to the five cans.
Sherlock almost jumped in his seat. His palm no longer held his chin and his expression reflected nothing but shock. His little book was being returned but he didn't care. Sherlock felt something moving inside his stomach when John said
“Oh my goodness, I’m so sorry!” Mrs Hudson’s voice resonated in the spa. No soundproof for Abby’s office, then. She could hear everything going on outside. “It just slipped right through my fingers!”
Sherlock opened his eyes.
“You’re a saint.” John stood up from the chair and gave Mrs Hudson a light squeeze on her shoulder. Even with all the clatter, her smile had never left her face.
"Sorry." Mycroft muttered as he took his phone from his pocket and saw the incoming call, he furrowed his lips when he saw the number. Giving a long sigh, he answered. "Gregory."
The text in Sherlock’s mind is from Sonnet 23, William Shakespeare.
"John." Sherlock said, his tone grave and husky.
"Oh, so the options are hidden?" Sherlock nodded, "but what about the code?"
– only for selected clientele – and she gave him a wink. He allowed himself to blush (he was getting used to it, apparently) and appeared coy as he chose the full-body massage, to Eldridge’s delight (it was actually pretty expensive).
And then there was Armand. At the thought of the young man he couldn't help a sympathetic smile. The bloke had feelings for Sherlock. It didn't need a master in deductions since it was as clear as water. But the reason of why the bloke was so friendly towards him as well was a mystery... maybe there are still people out there believing in justice, people with a noble heart, with a pure heart... something he was pretty sure couldn't brag about himself.
John roamed his hands by Sherlock's back. With secure hands, he kneaded between Sherlock's shoulder blades, and he was rewarded with a little groan, the sound made a – now familiar – feeling going down his belly.
"You're right. There's no point."
“Even with a little of it, I’m sure his wife is going to be very happy,” John smirked, his eyes settling back on his book.
"Yes, the woman re-married and the three of them live together."
"Hello Mycroft." Sherlock didn't move, seemingly unsurprised at his brother's appearance. He knew Mycroft would be coming now that John wasn't around, he wouldn't let this opportunity slip.
There was noise upstairs; a few bangs as if someone had fallen, a muffled scream and a thud and then silence. Two, three, four seconds…
“Yes.” Sherlock opened his eyes and walked to the bags with clothes. He opened them and smelled inside. “As I said, water-soluble,” he murmured. “I checked the flat. Everything is in order and safe to bring Rosie back. I texted Mycroft.”
"No, I came here because I didn't hear you snoring. I thought you were awake, so maybe you could help me with the code. It's good to know you took my advice, though."
He moved around the slow-paced scene and observed himself with John again. Now he was grabbing John’s hand and it was sliding through his fingers. The sound of the slippery product was loud in the silence and he fought the need to clear his throat. He moved to the sink. In the background he heard John’s voice, ‘
"Mr. Holmes..."
"I will not let you die, John... I will not..." Sherlock said, his voice was muffled by the doctor's hair. John noticed that it was just another phase of the drugged state. Sherlock could cry, laugh or get violent at any moment, and very quickly. Even when he could form semi-coherent thoughts and words now, he probably still needed the whole night to recover. John shook his head at the realization: a sleepless night waited for him.
Sherlock turned his neck, facing at John. They both were fighting a laugh. As they locked their gazes they couldn't help it anymore and laughed hard. It was difficult to stop. It was good to know things haven't changed and that they could still throw the tension that way.
“I know I’m not wrong, John.” Sherlock removed his hand from John’s grasp and swallowed. “I
John sighed. He really didn't want to say his thoughts out loud, but he couldn't lie to Sherlock either.
"A passionate crime!" John giggled at the term used, "You like detective stories?"
"I lost count."
And that night, in Sherlock's bed, the detective had been insecure about John's feelings, it was all the same but this time translated to a physical and sexual context.
"Thank you, John." The voice coming from Sherlock wasn't the usual. There was something there, something John couldn't quite put his finger on it. The voice held something strong, Sherlock's eyes just proved the point.
He walked to grab his phone and texted.
"Yes." Was John's firm answer.
“Pass me that wet towel.” Sherlock inhaled sharply and grabbed a chair next to him, all nervous energy again. “I think we didn’t use this chair today except when we threw our clothes on it, did we?”
His thoughts were interrupted with a little pinch pain at his ankle area. John playfully and unconsciously, had taken a little hair from there and was playing with it, moving it between his index finger and thumb. The corner of his lips lifted a bit and again, he realized his features had a deep frown. It was even painful to move the muscles of his face. Looking at John made his face to soften again. He
“You coming?” Sherlock was right next to him out of nowhere. John still had his phone in his hand with the text open. How long had Sherlock been standing there? Did he read the whole thing? He decided not to think too much about it and turned the screen off.
At the comment, Sherlock sat straight and hissed at the pain as the abrupt movement made alcohol get into the wound. He stared at John and sighed.
"Because... it would be the first time I've ever seen you interested in a woman, besides Irene Adler..."
“Sherlock, let me…” John felt those legs opening again, completely understanding what he wanted. John’s mind bizarrely conjured an image of Mary; all of those times when he wanted something in bed and he had to explain because she couldn’t read his mind as Sherlock could.
There were only a few times when he really needed to put Rosie to sleep so early. This had to be one of those times: she was terribly sleepy, John had to be back home in an hour or so, and he seriously needed some time alone.
The next day, three o’clock in the afternoon, found John Watson, CV in hand, a couple of false references, false previous jobs as massage therapist (all courtesy of Sherlock’s network), and false client’s database (Gregory Lestrade, William Scott, Molly Hooper, Martha Hudson and four friends, William Wiggins), in Slaney’s Spa manager’s office, looking for a job.
"Oh you better be kidding."
Lestrade rubbed his temples, he had to play fool in front of Donovan. He took his phone and dialled a number. "Are you sure?" he asked to Sherlock as he waited to be attended. Sherlock just smirked with a light lift of his shoulders; a clear expression of
His thoughts were interrupted by the muted sound of the violin downstairs. Sherlock had bought that rubber violin mute two days after he started to live here with Rosie. It wasn’t the same, though. He missed the reverberation of the strings hitting the walls with force, the energy of Sherlock’s allegro appassionato he was playing now. He remembered the talk yesterday, when he said he missed the playing, and sighed.
The first night Sherlock entered his room had been about two months after they moved in together. Sherlock needed John's laptop urgently since his had been confiscated by Lestrade just to play a prank on him during a drug's bust. Sherlock had knocked that time and, at the lack of response, he had let himself in. John had freaked out; lecturing Sherlock about rules, flatmates’ rules: like he shouldn't enter his room that way, and no wonder people
Sherlock rolled his eyes a bit, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. "I wanted to learn the reactions in the body to certain stimuli when I was younger, so I tried reading." He shrugged, "Reading stimulates the mind by default, so I thought it would stimulate my body as well. It was only dull data anyway, but I only saved a little amount that might come in handy with cases containing any perform of rape."

“Oh my God.” John stood up and walked away to the living room. He moved his fist to his mouth and breathed deeply for seconds that felt like hours.
"Incredible." The word just slipped out of his lips and he eyed Sherlock, he still wasn't moving from the sofa. John eyed him for a couple of seconds and then started the plan he’d prepared this morning in bed. Yes, it had to be done. He knew Sherlock knew about the wet dream, he would have scanned himself this morning, it was easy to deduce... even after a shower, as he had pointed out to Lestrade once.
When Moran finally broke into the flat after John had barricaded himself in, he shot the unconscious man John had knocked out. He took the gun from John and demanded he “Clean the mess.”
Anything to help clear out the hurt he carries.
He waits for the dark haired man to come back,
“Go on, little one, move your hand you know what to do. Or would you like me to help you? You know ever since I saw your naked bum, I haven't been able to think of little else. “ Sherlock felt the heated mouth move downward, one hand still firmly covering his own, the warmth was almost too much. He did as the voice beckoned and moved his hand the Alpha growled and pushing his black hoodie up along with the black t-shirt beneath, expose his hairless chest. The Alpha’s mouth descended on it’s prey taking the pink puckered nipple into his mouth, sucking furiously almost painfully. Sherlock gasped, arching upward his free hand moving to grasp at the injured shoulder unintentionally.
This is how I show my love, I made it in my mind because, I blame it on my A.D.D. baby. This is how an angel dies, I blame it on my own sick pride. Blame it on my A.D.D baby.
Then the brightness of the unforgiving sun disappears and he’s sitting in the hospital bed the dark haired Sherlock is speaking.
“Oh, Mycroft. He’s saying he loves you. And Fafa means Alpha. Isn’t that right? My little genius.” The exhausted DI removed his gray jacket and reached for his son, but the pup only clung to Mycroft continuing to purr. “Well I guess we know who his favorite is. “ Gregory laughed softly.
“Oh, come now. The great Mycroft Holmes knows a million different languages but isn’t fluent in baby genius?"
“Just Listen. I deserve that much. ” John doesn’t wait for the Alpha’s permission. Having vowed long ago to never wait for it, from any Alpha. This one was no different from the others. “This is my fault. I pursued you. You never wanted this-me. I came in like a wrecking ball. I put you on such a fucking pedestal. Like you were so unobtainable. I actually thought you were better than me. That I should be glad with whatever you were willing to give me. ”
Sail. Sail. Sail.
“Hey, I’ll be fine. Not like I was using them.”
“All you’ve ever done is wreck me! You left! You burned us! I will always want you, you idiot! But I wont be left behind, I wont be a second thought. You say you did this, this act. You did it for me? So this war was my fault? I should have never made you notice me. I wanted to tear down your defenses these walls you erected. I was a fool thinking i made progress.”
Is that why he had made the little brother comment? Sherlock was so interested in the picture, he wondered where the Alpha had been shot, obviously his limp was psychosomatic, he had made it home without the boring cane. Had the man even noticed? Foolish Alphas.
It was John to step back from their kiss first, his blue eyes bright and hopeful.
Mycroft's thoughts
“I did this for you John…for us. You must see that. I didn't have a choice he was going to kill you. I couldn’t live with a threat against you, hanging over our heads. I had to end it. Not just him but his very empire! Eliminating any further actions! Please will you look at me? Just please! Don't walk away from us!”
What was this?
John stands in the dark of a hospital room, his blue eyes distant. His concentration is far from whatever scenes play out on the side walk below the stone building. Somewhere in his head he hears the echo of his screams and the thud of a body hitting cement. Blood, darkest crimson spilling, and staining. The pool was so real the scent of his mates blood had been overwhelming, the sudden breaking of their bond, like a string pulled tight then slowly sawed at until it frayed and split. It had knocked the wind from John’s very lungs, nearly killing him and the life that grew unknowingly within. Had it not been for said life john was sure he would have died. And that was proof of his mates love , or lack there of.
“He could be anywhere! The baby, Mycroft? John could have already had the child. What if we haven’t heard anything because he didn’t make it. Omega childbirth for males is dangerous! John isn’t exactly a big framed man. What if they are torturing him? starving him! Forcing him to do foul acts of-”
just a quick shower scene
Sail. Sail. Sail. Sail.
They thought the culprits were caught but were they?
Disgusting he was starting to show signs of sentiment and jealousy. He heard the running shower and paused, he could easily go into the bathroom sit himself on the toilet and watch the Alpha shower. Would that be too forward? His cheeks burned red at such a bold move, he had yet to see an Alpha naked. What exactly did John have under his clothes, Alphas were always so proud of their genitals. Was it really that impressive? He could check. Sherlock shook his head, forcing his thoughts away from such biologically basic needs. He was above that, he was a certified genius, at 21 he was teaching at the university, not attending it as this Alpha believed.
“Omega, I have your lunch.”
NIghts, John hated and dreaded nights here. The bed was large and comfortable, the duvets soft and sheets of the expensive white silk.
John reaches out to take the warm green thermos, a flash of the desert sun and he turns to see a man in army fatigues looking at him the two laying behind heavy sandbags belly down flat on the hot earth.
Strong hands cupped his face forcing him to look back. The rain forgotten as blue eyes met gray and their lips met.
The blond Omega caught some narrowed eyes on the neutered Alpha, perhaps his plan was working. He wondered who would be the first to challenge the man’s territory. After the first couple of nights John was kept isolated from any of the men, except a very needy Moran.
“Fucking christ!” the Alpha grunted panting, holding his massive cock in his larger hands. “I needed that. “
John glared at the taller man. “You clean it up.” John needed to challenge Moran as much as possible in front of his men. This could cause an upset of power,  he hated the sight of the dead young man, a nameless Alpha that just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. He wanted to see how far he could push Moran and as it seemed this didn’t rile the Alpha. Instead the neutered Moran had sworn angrily but had someone else clean the mess.
What happened? The question shown in John’s blue eyes and Moran growled angrily. “MINE!” He was on his feet in an instant and Caleb remained seated his head bowed.
“It is?” John accepts the offered drink and sips slowly. “It is.” He replies more assuredly, closing his eyes in reflection.
"John! I know where they are. There's more markings, it's all discreetly done with prime numbers pointing to the warehouse where their meeting will take place. "
It wasn't enough to find the goods, Sherlock wanted the criminals as well, not for the sake of justice. Though he would never tell John this out loud, but vanity. He wanted to bring in the criminals because no one outsmarted Sherlock Holmes.
The Doctors that come in assure him he’s doing better, they ask him the same questions, he remembers the date only because someone told him what day it was yesterday and the day before. He isn’t stupid he can count, a nurse enters with drugs, always wanting to ease his stress.
He's looking at me again with those cool gray eyes. He knows me?
This took Sherlock’s breath away, and the Alpha showed his appreciation by running his tongue against the lobe, nipping playfully.
"And we've got a signal to boot! Sherlock! You've done it! I'll text Lestrade."
“Eat Sebby.” Moriarty ordered, barely touching any of the baked salmon on his plate. John nibbled at the large slice of bread on a plate to his right.
Sherlock had taken biology and studied the male figure, but a text book had nothing on the true form. John’s left leg was slightly smaller due to his limp and favoring his right. Moving up Sherlock allowed his usually clinical eyes to take in the slim belly where muscle was traceable, also a firm trail of blond hair circled the belly button he licked his lips subconsciously. His mind wasn’t seeing a form from a textbook but rather the true thing. The room was growing warmer, as eyes tried to decide to follow the line of deep blond hair freckles with light brown strands, up or down.
John ignored his father’s call, the man was furious that John cancelled the dinner. He didn’t need the posturing it was hard to remain silent while Mycroft Holmes showed off his fancy rooms and expensive cutlery. John had made it easily into the employee entrance following a delivery of groceries. The delivery boy was happy for the help, John had even helped the cook put the groceries away, she was a sweet woman offering him a plate of biscuits. He had also turned down the tip the young Beta youth had offered for helping bring in the heavy boxes.
John had bitten and punched and scratched his way to taking over the bed, No matter how hard John fought Moran was stronger. The Alpha would then postion himself behind the smaller Omega and rutting shamelessly  against John. Without testicules it was a hopless thing but the Alpha would not be swayed, He would bite and lick all over John’s belly and thighs breathing heavily, searching for release. The Alpha aggressively  ignored the omega’s challenging hiss and growl, spitting into his hand forcing John’s bottoms down Sebastian  would  force his semi hard cock between John’s thighs  moaning and growling into the Omega’s neck. John swallowed back his own vomit remaining still afraid of being penetrated.
“John-you are the only one I've ever loved. You can see that. You of all people should be able to see it?”
“Caleb?”
"John. Sssh."
It's childish but he refuses to tell John he failed, and that the Doctor had been correct. Sherlock acknowledges it to himself, that should be enough. They are lost, fine. Yes, he should have texted Lestrade before they set off into the maze of abandoned warehouses and shipping crates.
“Daddy. Who’s he?” The child stared up at the tall dark haired Alpha in the long coat with a sad face. The boy was suspicious and he glared at Sherlock.
John felt his groin stir in anticipation, he had given his word that the young Omega could return to school and lead his life. However seeing the younger man sitting there in that large chair reading an old book made him feel a sudden fierce protectiveness. God, John needed a shower, he went to the small kitchen, that would not due once he married. He would need to start looking for a new place, one suitable for a growing family. This was just a one bedroom flat, on montague street. Perhaps he would ask his new bride for input, anything to hear that deep baritone, his hands itched to kiss that swan like neck, and feel the vibrations of the Omega’s moan.
This hospital room starts to spin once more and I know the darkness will close in to swallow me up like a sandstorm. A nurse with a syringe enters.
There was a heavy weight on him, and a warm stickiness soaking through his thin button up.
“Please, John, sit. I have a guest.” Moriarty growled.
xxxooxxxx
“You don’t smell so nice either.”
The mocking tone caused the Omega to continue upward with his inspection, the man had light pink nipples, pointed and tensed due to the cold of the room? Or was it in response to an Omega’s close vicinity. The pectoral of the man’s left was a mess of brightly colored flesh and puckered scar tissue. The bullet had been small, but accurate, well nearly. What pain such an injury must have caused the Alpha. How had he survived such circumstance. The Omega made a whimpering sound in his throat without thinking.
"Right, as I was saying-" Sherlock pushed the scrambled chaos into a locked room of his mind palace. He would return to it later right now he needed to focus.
"Well genius lead the way."
Sherlock clasped his eyes, faintly hearing a the sound of zip, then the Alpha held him still, sealing their mouths. The sound of his own heart was in his ears, he could barely think to breath. His body didn’t feel like his own, he was moving without thinking, arching upward grinding against the stranger.
Mycroft greeted his mate with a smile. “Fafa?”
“You have some fucking nerve! ” she swore staring towards the Alpha who was standing wide eyed an frozen all focus now on the small child hugging John’s left leg.
Once John was back in his room he pulled Caleb in, knowing there weren't any others watching. Alphas weren’t allowed this close to John.
Part of me wants to yell something. I try to grasp onto the vague memories, but they are like wisps of smoke. Nothing tangible, If only I could form words and clear thoughts.
Sherlock was fluent in 13 different languages however he understood little of what this Alpha was saying. Even the clumsy petting he had been subjected to with Victor was nothing compared to this. He felt something stirring in him and he wanted more, of what he couldn’t say but his Omega side was begging him to let go and let the Alpha do what his masterfully rough hands promised.
“I volunteered. They wanted to make it believable. You weren't supposed to be kidnapped. I was ready to go as soon as I heard. However, medical wouldn’t clear me until two days ago. I’m going to get you out of here.”
This caused the Alpha to grunt painfully but his mouth only sucked harder as if to recompense the whimpering Omega beneath him. John kept the Omega’s hand in his own moving it roughly, quickly, thrusting against the clothed thigh.
The first night, John refused to undress, and Moran had overpowered him, stripping him completely naked before throwing a pair of pj bottoms and an oversized t-shirt with the words. Royal Marine Corps.
“I trust you.” John whispered laying his head on Caleb’s thigh allowing the Alpha to pet his hair.  “Just promise me no matter what that you will keep my child safe, even if it means killing me in the process. Keep the baby safe.”
John’s tongue took advantage of the parted lips forming an adorable O. He groaned into the  receptive warmth, his tongue quick to run over the smaller man’s perfect white teeth, dancing temporarily with the responsive tongue. He was an Alpha, and easily took control forcing his thick warm tongue further down, needing to penetrate in any way he could.
John’s words stung more than ever. He was back, Moriarty’s empire was done-shattered and forever broken. He expected John to return to him, understanding and forgiving. This wasn't what he thought. And the child? John had a pup? He had a son? Sherlock was a father? He had a son he didn’t know, would perhaps never get the chance to.
John remembers  refusing to ever forget.
The young Omega stared up at him with his usual scrutiny, emerald green eyes looked over his father’s frowning face. WIth a sigh, the boy wrapped his tiny arms around his father’s left leg. Mycroft allowed himself a moment from his dark thoughts and his constant flow of emails and voicemails. Without a second thought the ginger haired Alpha lifted the boy up into his arms, wanting to hold him close. Enjoying the sweet scent of the pup, a mixture of his own scent. It was amazing that a non blood related pup would easily take on his adopted Alpha’s scent.
