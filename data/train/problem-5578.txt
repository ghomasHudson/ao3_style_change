“Nothing says romance like a little privacy-violating-porn-removal,” Tony grimaced.  “I’m not going to watch them. You know that, right?”
Later, Tony told himself.  Or the Rhodey-voice in his head told himself, whatever. After the thing with Steve’s platonic BFF.  Over dinner, maybe.  He could mention it.  The whole, hey, I think I-kind-of-like-you-thing.  Drop the idea in the conversation somewhere between the soup course and for as long as we both shall live.  Smooth.
For some reason, his old war bonds speech popped into his head.  He had been good at that, selling an idea, an image. He had been good at that, at least until he got in front of an audience who knew a lot more about what he was selling than he did.  Something about the thought made him frown, though he wasn’t sure why, and then his phone buzzed, and Steve forgot to breathe.
Steve’s hips bucked, and he caught Kirk’s waist in his hands, stilling him while Kirk’s laugh, low and warm and honeyed filled his mouth.
There is a Steve POV for their first meeting in my Thank You Fics, if you are interested in seeing how Steve reacted to Tony.  Thanks for reading!
I'm sabrecmc on tumblr and discord, so come say hi.
“Why? Why me?  Why...why any of this?” Steve asked.
“Not my fault he won’t leave those damn airplanes alone long enough to do his job. What am I supposed to do?” Josh demanded with frown that quickly changed to a knowing, cheeky smirk when he looked at Tony.  “Come on, Tony, sharing’s caring.  Give me something, I beg you. God, I bet he’s got a huge knot, doesn’t he?  The kind that really fills you up. Not the rinky-dink, sausage party bullshit I have to put up with, that’s for sure. Spill, for the love of God. I need something to think about while Hugh’s gluing wings on the B-52 and listening to Glenn Beck.  Help an O out, would you? Whit, you saw him, right?  Tell me I’m wrong.  You can’t, so whatever,” he finished, waving a hand in the air and taking a sip of his drink.
“I can’t believe you said that,” Steve said with a shake of his head.  He walked over to the pitcher by the basin and placed the lily in it. For now, at least, that would do.  Turning back to Tony, he grinned and pursed his lips into mock disapproval.  “Now who thinks himself amusing, hmm?”
“He thinks I’m going to get my ass handed to me,” Tony observed wryly, glancing at Rhodes while he undid his robe and threw it atop Steve’s.
“Yes, well, he does that talking thing a lot, doesn’t he?” the King asked, giving Steve a side-eyed look. Then he smiled at Cam, almost gently.  “Steve, huh?” the King said, raising an eyebrow and glancing over at Steve. “Does he talk your ear off?  Bothersome, isn’t it?  I know, I know.  Say no more.  Complete agreement from me,” the King continued as he wrote.  Cam shot a helpless, confused look over at Steve.  “Now, listen. This is important. When you get back to your room, I want you to draw a bath for him.  Nice and hot, alright?  And give this to Zola,” the King said, rolling up the parchment he’d been writing on.  He dropped a spot of red wax on the seam and picked up his seal.  He pushed the seal into the hot wax, then blew it cool and handed it to Cam.
“Moinet studied in Florence.  Made clocks for Napoleon, Tsar Alexander.  Like to invent all kinds of things.  The first chronograph.  That was him.  He wanted something to time the passage of the stars and planets, but nothing was good enough, so he built it himself.  That sounded…sounded about right to me.  Everything he made, everything--it was beautiful, too,” Steve told him in a hushed voice like he was sharing a secret.
“Not the gym.  Probably...I guess the Met,” Steve replied. “I used to go there a lot as a kid. There and the library, I guess.  I had a lot of health problems when I was a kid, and so there would be times when we’d go into Manhattan for appointments and all--me and my mom, that is.  Or later just me.  Anyway, afterwards, that was a treat, you know?  The Met or the library if it was a Tuesday or Wednesday. The Met didn’t make you pay, which was great.  I mean, they suggest it, but you don’t have to.  So, we’d go there and just, I don’t know. Wander, I guess. I loved it, and I think she did, too. She always seemed...happy there.”
Just…unexpected.  Much like Tony’s current lack of domestic duties.  Steve, as it turned out, preferred to do the cooking, mainly because he took the whole thing about eating small meals throughout the day as some kind of personal challenge, and, as he assured Tony, figured it wasn’t fair to expect Tony to try to keep up with his metabolism.  Tony strongly suspected this, while possibly true given Steve’s physique, was what he’d come to think of as “Steve-speak” for ‘Please, God, don’t make me another omelet.’  Steve had a way of saying things that were both true and completely full of shit at the same time, a skill Tony had to grudgingly admire.  Steve was probably just too polite to admit the truth, not that Tony wasn’t relieved to be free of the apron strings, though Steve’s staple of recipes was heavy on the meat and potatoes and whatever could be boiled, which turned out, unfortunately, to be most anything.
Steve gave him a wan smile, straightened his jacket one more time and headed for the door.  He stepped out into the living room where Tony was peering into a box Ms. Potts was holding that appeared to contain a number of watches.  Tony glanced up absently, then back down to the watches. Steve offered up a lopsided smile and ducked his head a bit, letting his gaze flit around the room, never quite catching on anything.
“Strange for you, too,” Tony pointed out.  “I mean, mostly strange for you.  We’re just—we just want to help.”
“Tony—you know Stark Industries, right?  Tony’s father founded the company.  Tony would be the one to talk to about adaptive armor.  Actually, Tony and I were just talking about some of the ways to improve armor maneuverability while enhancing protection and lethality,” Steve said smoothly.
“Tony,” Steve called out softly, letting one hand fall on Tony’s shoulder.
“You’ll wait,” Tony repeated.  He frowned, eyes darting off to the side as he tried to figure out Steve-speak.  “For me.  You’ll wait for me to be ready?  For…oh.  For…that. But--but…you don’t even want me.   Or, you didn’t. I thought.  I mean, you said.  You said that you weren’t going to…you know.  With me.  Which is fine.  Whatever. It’s fine.  I mean, I thought, you know, maybe.  After the whole kiss thing.  Which, I know, technically, I kissed you first, and you said you wouldn’t, you know. With me, so.  I mean, it’s fine.  Whatever,” Tony mumbled, darting a quick look at Steve’s wide, blue eyes.  It took Tony three full seconds to realize he had grasped the dog tags and was rubbing them between his thumb and forefinger.  He could see Steve’s eyes drop for a moment to track the movement and made himself let go, but that had the disadvantage of then giving him nothing to do with his hands, which suddenly stuck out from this sides as if they were Mr. Potato Head appendages.
“Stop the international terrorists, get the goods on my murderous pseudo-Uncle, talk about feelings with my fake husband, impress said fake hubby’s bestie….I’ll just pencil in privatize world peace for a nooner,” Tony grumbled.
What year is it, Steve had asked, stumbling to his feet while the terrified man plastered his back to the wall.  He looked around.
“Please stop. I’m going to need to, I don’t know, get some Metamucil.  And a clapper.  Do you remember the clapper? I feel the arthritis setting in. And the sudden desire for a 99-cent buffet.  Pretty sure I have a coupon that’s only barely out of date.”
“That’s not what you’re here for,” Tony shouted sharply, his voice echoing off the room.
“That was burned toast, come on,” Tony retorted.
“Good Steve, good Steve, good Steve,” Tony chanted.  His head thrashed from side to side, and he bore down encouragingly, nodding, unable to do more than let unintelligible sounds fall from his lips.  Steve grasped Tony’s hips and lifted, pulling out of him almost all the way, then thrusting back in, hard and smooth, the head of his cock finding that spot deep inside Tony that made his body seem to soar. Tony’s body gave way, all resistance gone.  He was made for this, for Steve. This was what it was supposed to feel like. This was love and Pleasure and Steve.
“I—they--what?” Tony stuttered, his mental litany still rambling through his head with enough speed that it took him a moment to dial it back to what Steve was saying.
“Well,” Tony said, clapping his hands together.  “I have to go design a toothpaste tube,” he announced, pushing himself off the edge of the bar and grinning as he caught Steve’s almost shy smile that followed him as he headed toward his room.  “What time’s the appointment?” Tony asked, turning to look back at the two of them, Steve scowling down at Barnes, who happily munched his way through the appetizer section.
.  Tell me what’s going on.”
“Please tell me I can touch you now,” Tony husked out.
“I’m just going to look at it, maybe clean it up a bit.  Bruce can decide what more to do when they find us,” Steve assured him, hopefully sounding more sure of that scenario than he felt.
Laughter accompanied the last of Tony’s words.  Stone was glaring daggers at Steve, though he said nothing, just dropped the broken lance, wheeled his horse around and shouted for his squire to collect the coins.  Steve somehow thought that had not been the reward Stone had been craving. He looked over at Tony, who was looking down at the broken lance and railing with keen interest.  Finally, he lifted his eyes to Steve, his gaze holding Steve pinned there. Steve’s hand throbbed and stung. He could feel blood running from his split knuckles.
“Well, we don’t really know,” Bruce began.
“Hey, you shacked up with Nat for like a year,” Steve reminded him, laughing as he reached out to land a light punch on Bucky’s shoulder.
“I don’t have any idea what you’re talking about,” Steve said, though he was more amused than the usual prickly way it felt when Stark’s pop culture references left him feeling like he should be in the corner with a dunce cap on over the cowl.
,” Steve’s mind replied.
.   Put that in blue Kevlar and throw in a dash of sarcasm, a truly impressive ability to flout authority and a somewhat inexplicable fondness for a guy in a metal suit and you’d really have something.
, but he couldn't say it. He had the crazy idea that Steve heard it, though, which made no sense, of course, but he couldn't shake it, and Steve was watching him with this careful, soft look that, for a moment, seemed so lost that Tony had to restrain the impulse to—to do something, anything, to make that look go away.
Coulson was waiting for him.  Of course.  Standing in a suit, looking proper, just missing a clipboard and he would basically qualify as the hall monitor who caught Tony out of class without a pass.
Tony darted out is tongue, licking it over his lips. Steve’s mouth fell open, going dry at the sight.  Steve knew the gesture was intentional, but couldn’t stop his own body’s reaction to it.  He could read triumph in Tony’s expression as he hooked his arms under Tony’s hips and lifted him, moving his hips to line up his cock.  He took a last, steadying breath, gaze shifting up to Tony’s face as he thrust inside the tight, wet heat of Tony’s body, slowly, so slowly he ached with the effort.  He meant to watch Tony’s reactions, but his eyes dropped to where their bodies joined of their accord, and he watched himself disappear inside the sheath of Tony’s body as it stretched around him.
Shaking himself, Steve turned to follow the path the Omega had taken into the keep, with Bucky striding along next to him and Yinsen following behind.
“Exactly, you’re an independent thinker, like me,” Stark nodded, pointing his hands back at his chest.  Brock’s face brightened. Steve had to resist rolling his eyes.
“If you’re doing it wrong, that’s kind of on you,” Steve drawled, making Tony’s head snap around.
“When I was a kid, I was alone a lot,” Steve began, staring out at the deepening night. “Ma had to work.  I was too sick to be in school.  Bu—my friend.  He’d come by when he could.  After school or work.  We’d play checkers with bottle caps he found down by the corner store.  Yellows, oranges, greens and whites, those went with the reds.  Purple, blue, silver, those went with the blacks.  I don’t know why.  Cream sodas.  Those had the most colors.  Cards, sometimes.  His deck was missing a couple, but we made up our own rules,” Steve said, mouth tight, then suddenly relaxing into a smile.  “We did that a lot. Made up our own rules.  He’d tell you it was me, dragging him into…whatever it was I got myself into.  He always followed me, though.  Always,” Steve said with a shake of his head.  He dropped his chin to his chest and looked over at Tony.  “I don’t know why.  Guess he felt responsible or—I don’t know.”
“I should talk to him,” Tony heard himself say.  “I mean, just, you know. Check in.”
“I’m here to see Steve…uh, Captain Rogers. He’s my Alpha.  I don’t know if you, ah, heard,” Tony said, scratching a hand at the side of his head, then forcing himself to let it drop and putting both hands in his pockets.  “We’re Bonded.”
That hurt, Tony thought, shaking his hand to clear the worst of the stinging pain from his knuckles.   Surprisingly satisfying, though. “That’s my husband you’re talking about, Senator,” Tony bit out.
“Look, Cap,” Fury began, “I’ve seen how you are.  I’ve read the reports. I know plenty about PTSD or shellshock or whatever they’re calling it these days, but you…there’s not a person alive who has been through what you’ve been through, and we’re all, we’re…out of our depth on his one, truth be told.  No one wants to be the guy who lost the world’s only super-soldier on his watch, okay?”
He wanted Steve with him, though.  All that logical understanding turned back into a pumpkin in the middle of the night when it was not-cold, and he still couldn’t get warm, and it wasn’t cave-dark, but it was dark enough to see how wrong he was now.  He needed Steve to tell him he was right. That he was alright.  Whatever.  He just had to trust that Steve would answer a question he wasn’t able to ask yet.
Barnes stared at the closed door, then shook his head and turned a hard glare on Tony.  “At least this one ended up better than the last private gig he got,” Barnes huffed out.  “Married or whatever the hell this is instead of…” Barnes let the words trail off, watching Tony carefully.
“That’s pretty much what Rhodey said when I called him last night,” Tony admitted, slumping back in his chair.  “Well, what he actually said before he hung up was that I should man up and tap that American pie, but I think it was the same basic sentiment.”
“Yeah, guess not…Stark’s a lot taller, right?” the man said, going back to his phone.  Steve snorted next to him and bumped his shoulder.
“I prefer to think of it as a well-planned recon op,” Steve countered, then ducked his head and sipped at his—God, it was actually blue, Tony noticed with a shudder--drink.  “Bucky—my roommate?  He’d let me play for free when he worked the counter here,” Steve admitted, giving Tony a sheepish look from under his ridiculously long lashes.  “One of his first gigs when we got to Vegas.”
“Tony—” Steve said, a frown pulling at his brow.
“Do you believe the universe fights for souls to be together?” Tony asked, trying to keep his voice steady and tell himself the answer wasn’t everything.
“I plan to repeat seventh grade next week. Got the puberty re-do the week after that. Trying to hit the high points,” Tony replied, a grin tugging at his lips when Steve blew out a puff of laughter and dipped his head in a nod.
“Thanks,” Steve replied, mouth ticking up at the corners, clearly somewhat thrown by Tony’s momentary lapse into good manners.  “Ready to go?”
“Of course, he can’t go back, Tony, I’m not—I’m,” Rhodes broke off. “Hell, I don’t know what I’m saying.”
Tony stared at the door a moment longer, then let out a long hiss of breath he hadn’t realized he was holding.  He lifted the phone to his ear again, and stood there, leaning against the wall next to the door of his new apartment in his soon-to-be-new building.
“St---“ Tony started.
Maybe Steve wanted SI for the military connections that came with it.  Steve seemed like career military.  SI came with not only money, but prestige and connections with the brass.  Made some sense.  SI was Tony’s best attribute, after all.  How many times had he heard how valuable he was because of the company his father built?
Steve worked his fingers in and out a few more times, until he felt the slackness he wanted, then grabbed the lube again and squirted a liberal amount onto his hand.  He pushed himself up on his knees and took his cock in his hand, slicking himself up. Tony looked up at him, eyes soft and hooded. He was panting, his chest flushed around the bright glow of the reactor.  His lips were red and puffy. A trail of dark, reddened skin dotted his neck, and sweat and Steve’s hands had made his hair into a spikey mess. Steve thought he was the most beautiful sight he had ever seen.
Couldn’t really complain about the guy you were with being really into you, right?  That would be a stupid thing to complain about, Tony told himself, staring up at the inspirational poster above the bed that helpfully told him the river always beat the rock because of perseverance.   It’s hydraulic action, Tony mentally corrected, then grimaced as he shifted again. It was nice to be wanted with a crazy kind of desperation.  Wasn’t it?  Ty was a passionate guy, and that—that was a good thing, Tony reminded himself with what he meant to be a firm nod that turned into more of a head bobble.  It was good to be wanted.  Sometimes, those last few months, Steve had been gone so much with work, it—well.  The point was, having the guy you liked want you so badly he couldn’t contain himself, that was a good thing.  Relationship goals, right?
“Not you, Tony. Just is what it is,” Steve replied. He finished packing the backpack and started towards the door. “I gotta go. Stay if you want. Neighbor has a key. He can lock up. Just knock on his door three times. Hard, or he won't hear you.”
Giving up on the project he was—well—not working on by the current state of it, he pushed away from the console and walked to the elevator bay outside the workshop.  The least he could do was offer to give Steve a tour of the place.  Again.   Tony took the lift to the conference room floors and swept into the room without knocking, drawing annoyed glances from Nat and Wilson, but little more than a curious pause from Steve before he went back to whatever report it was he was reading, probably something inspiringly entitled “Ode to Bucky” or “The Super-Soldier Memory Loss Buddy System for Dummies.”
is a good thing.  Here.  For…for now.  This whole—thing we’re doing here.  I feel like I need to caveat this.  Matt?  Say something lawyerly.”
?” Steve asked, almost gently, pulling a bit at Tony’s wrist until he could slide his hand around Tony’s.
The music was loud.  Too loud. It was making his head pound. The bass thumped through the floor below him.  The sound occasionally made the lamp flicker on the nightstand next to where Tony slumped by the bed.  Disco lighting, Tony thought with a giddy sort of amusement that quickly went sour.  He closed his eyes and swallowed back a surge of nausea.
“It—I—well…” Tony stuttered.  He was standing on the edge of zero to panic.  He could feel it.  His body starting to depress the accelerator, like he was on the outside looking in, watching it happen, but powerless to stop it.
Steve sank down next to him. Only a couple of inches separated them.  He could feel Tony’s warmth, see the way the occasional breeze ruffled his hair, how the sun made his freckles stand out.  It was the closest he had been to Tony.  He allowed himself to relish it, just for a bit.  Tony’s nearness. It was intoxicating, or at least, what he remembered the feeling being like, those few times he and Bucky managed to get into the liquor, his insides all loose and shaky, his mind a wash of giddy happiness, his body warm and languid.
“Yes,” Steve said immediately.  That much was true.
“Thanks,” Steve said dryly.  Making it to Tony’s car was not quite the medieval gauntlet of the prior night, though Steve did notice a couple of brightly dressed “tourists” surreptitiously snapping photos as they made their way through the hotel lobby and out to where Happy had the car humming.
The hike down to the pond was steeper than Tony remembered.  Of course, his last trek down the mountain to not go fishing had been pre-shrapnel accessories, so there was that.  Steve kept slowing to point out a view he claimed to want to draw or some vegetation or wildlife that caught his eye.  Tony knew what he was doing, and felt almost guilty at how grateful he was for it.
He’d always thought it would feel like being held down, having an Alpha signal him like that.  He wondered, though, with Steve, if it might just feel like being held.
Ty was truly a man of the world. He studied philosophy, literature, religion. Hell, he could quote Nietzsche, the Dalai Lama and Hunter S. Thompson interchangeably.  He even spent a summer at some temple in Nepal finding his spiritual center or whatever he called it. Tony couldn’t remember.  It had sounded impressively cool when Ty talked about it, though Tony couldn’t quite recall why.  Something about chakras? Anyway, all Tony could manage was the occasional Monty Python reference and an encyclopedic knowledge of Lord of the Rings.  That was…definitely not as cool.
“I think he wants you to like him, and that’s good, isn’t it?  Most of them, they don’t care if we like them or not,” Cam mumbled in a soft voice.
Steve jerked his head away, unable to meet Bucky’s gaze.  He drew a shaky breath.  He’d never been able to deny Bucky when Bucky asked something of him.  Bucky was the one that had always been there, taken a young, skinny Steve under his wing, had his back when he inevitably got in over his head.  But this…he couldn’t.  A part of him wanted to give in, take away that look that had been hovering on Bucky’s face the past months.  But, Tony was waiting.  Tony, with his laughter and wit and kindness and incredible intelligence and dark eyes and hands moving over Steve’s body making him feel things he’d never imagined.  That he’d get into the car had never really been on the table.
That was the only warning Steve had before the blunt, cool metal of the phallus’ head pressed against the tight ring of his hole.  It’s too much, Steve thought hazily, turning his face against the bed and squeezing his eyes shut as his face contorted into a tight grimace.  He bit at his lip, tasted blood, and shook his head back and forth against the bed, hands twisting into the coverlet.  The thing pushed inexorably forward, stretching him wide. It was no bigger than Tony, obviously, but this was—it was different.  Intractably hard and invasive in a way that Tony’s cock wasn’t, this foreign thing that someone had made just for this.  His vision blurred as wetness seeped out of the corners of his eyes, and he made another deep bellow of a sound.
There was something about the way Tony said the word that wormed its way deep into Steve’s head, as if lifting some kind of curtain or--or
“Ah, come on, Howard, you really want to go here?  It’s not like you can exactly blame the kid, now can you?” Stane asked, then dropped his gaze and leaned heavily on where his arm was braced on the counter. He puffed out a great burst of air through his nose, then shook his head and waved his other hand through the air.   Steve frowned in confusion for a moment before his mind caught up.  Oh.  Jesus, Howard, Steve thought with a vicious spike of anger.  Just how much of your own shit are you taking out on Tony? “I think maybe we should all just, you know…let’s take a breather.  Call it a night.  Get some sleep or something.  Look, I’ll talk to Vernon after the holiday, smooth things over.  It’ll be fine,” he soothed.
“Because you’re all about style,” Steve huffed out.  “
“You can’t…Obie, you can’t.  This would…” Tony stammered, his mind flashing to Steve’s face when he’d pulled out the wrinkled papers and shown them to Tony that night in Steve’s apartment.  “This would destroy him.”
He had to give Steve credit for always wanting to understand the technology he was expected to utilize, or, if not fully understand it, at least come to grips with what it could do and how best he could put it to use.  God knew, Tony loved to talk about his tech, and a willing ear was a rare thing.  When they actually managed to find a shared topic, they tended to manage surprisingly productive and engaging conversations, though not without their disagreements.  Though, to be fair, he was pretty sure Steve had goaded him into the whole Star Wars/Star Trek debacle by deliberately confusing the two then going all wide-eyed innocent when Tony went apoplectic.
Steve looked up and caught the Helicarrier version of himself looking down at where Tony’s hand was intertwined with Steve’s.  He likes that. When you touch him. That way, he knows you like him.
The Veterans’ Affairs building was sprawling and vaguely modern, done in what Tony assumed were meant to be colors evoking the Southwest, but ended up looking a bit like what would happen if a hospital and a Chipotle had a bastard love child.  Happy pulled the car up front and they all piled out.  Steve had to go back for Barnes’ jacket, though Barnes just grabbed it and held it in his fist instead of putting it on.  Oh, look, someone else gets the Disapproving Face, too, Tony noticed with a small amount of glee.  Matt was waiting for them in the lobby, sitting by a potted palm and a stack of last year’s People magazines, including one with Tony on the cover from when he’d gotten back from Afghanistan, which Matt was, for some reason, paging through.
“It isn’t stalling to try to finish my own lunch,” Tony grumbled, looking down disconsolately at his half-eaten burger.  With a long-suffering sigh, he got up from the stool and headed for the workshop elevator.
“And the pirates just want to pet the cute doggy, whatever you want to tell yourself,” Kirk shrugged.  “So, your mom okay with the Big Gay Son thing?”
a waste of time, but, well. It also seemed completely amazing.  At least he got to see it from the outside, he thought, feeling a nearly overwhelming sense of gratefulness to Tony for a moment.  It wasn’t fair to compare, he knew that. Tony had nearly infinite money and resources at his disposal.
He didn’t care if this was all Tony wanted from him.  This was enough.  It would have to be.  He tried to put everything he was feeling into his kiss, giving back as much as he could, and he heard Tony moan, low and deep against his mouth.
Or maybe because as Tony’s gaze roved over his body, he could see the other man react, pupils blown wide, breath coming in shortened gasps, body rigid and taut.  He was sure Tony was hard underneath the tablet lying forgotten on his lap.  Unbidden, an odd, heady sense of power swept through him at the sight, what he could do to Tony just by letting him do nothing more than see his body.
“Well, I name the ‘bots, and this…it was kind of an inside joke,” Tony explained.
“You’re not selfish,” Steve protested.  “What happened, it wasn’t your fault, Tony.  You know that. It was Zola and Stane and...” he trailed off.   And this world, he thought to himself, but left the accusation unspoken between them.
“Don’t help,” Tony shot back with a frustrated grimace.  “It was looking for heat signatures.  Have you felt him?  He’s like a damn furnace,” Tony said.  “You’d have been skinned first.  Sorry.  I’m small and non-threatening. I’d probably have survived.”
With a low sigh, he turned around in a slow circle and looked at the workstation again, with the plastic sheet partially lifted. If he turned the computer on, Neil would probably have some words of wisdom.  Neil.  He should call Neil.  It had been too long since they talked.  There had been a message when he got back to Malibu, but he’d had JARVIS delete them all in a fit of not wanting to deal with anything.
“You make it sound so simple,” Tony said after a moment’s pause.
“I know it’s traditional…” Tony started, looking over his shoulder at the bed.
“It was in with my Dad’s papers.  Obie threatened to go public with it.  File for an injunction, so I couldn’t vote at the meeting.  The implication being that I’ve, I don’t know, fallen under the influence of my abusive ex or some stupid shit like that.  My little move to BFE and seemingly sudden desire to cut our major profit center not exactly helping my case,” Tony explained.  “I’m sorry.  God, Steve, I’m sorry.  I never—I never thought.  Obie, he’s been there my whole life.  I mean, maybe he does really see it that way, maybe he really is worried, I don’t know.  I don’t know.  I would never put you through that.  I couldn’t.  Just, no.  No.  So.  That’s where we are.  It isn’t forever.  Eventually, he’ll come around or retire or whatever.  Fuck, I don’t know, but it’s done, okay?  Just forget it.  Let’s eat our dumplings or whatever, and just—can we just not talk about this anymore?  Please?”
“Pepper’s making arrangements.  Little tour thing.  Like SI may be interested in investing or something,” Tony told him.
“Excuse me?” Tony demanded incredulously, head whipping around to look at Rhodey.
come to the right place,” Tony said, slashing the hand holding the drink through the air and tossing his head a little with the motion.  “Lost your way, soldier?”
“Rio. Palazzo suite,” Steve corrected.
“What?  Having a deeply personal, somewhat awkward conversation in front of our friends while they pretend to ignore us and stuff their faces as some kind of distraction so we’ll talk?” Tony asked with a small smile.
“My powers of persuasion are not to be mocked, Rogers,” Tony muttered around a smile.  “Now, lie back and think of America,” he quipped, grinning broadly.  Steve did that little half-eye roll, half-sigh thing that meant he was going to do what Tony asked, tossed the stuffed toys to the side and lay down on the sheet, still clutching the shield pillow to his chest.  “Not—no, not like that,” Tony grumbled.  “Here,” he said.  “Pillow behind the head and you—you just, like this,” Tony instructed, putting one hand behind his own head and angling his elbow out.
. I did the assignments, but the professor says I have to come to class anyway, and they all just sta--the whole school’s lame. I hate it there—” Tony began.
“Just that this has apparently been hanging over your head for weeks, from what Pepper tells me, and you let it sit there, then sent Pepper like some errand girl—no, don’t start, you practically have her running the company these days, not exactly your typical PA stuff—then finally decided to go yourself, and managed to show up without a notary, which you knew you needed, like you aren’t thinking ten steps ahead of everyone else on anything that isn’t Steve Rogers,” Rhodes ground out, one finger tapping out a rhythm against the top of his thigh.  “I know you.  Anything else, any
“Not really interested in that,” Steve replied.
Which Steve had been doing for awhile, so, really, not a big life change, as it turned out.  Tony was, of course, completely oblivious to Steve’s moment of clarity.
“You have got to be kidding me,” Tony groused under his breath.
“Yeah, yeah, ah, about that,” Tony broke in.  “Change of plans. Lay in a new course for us, will you?”  There was a pause.
Steve wanted to sleep, like Brock suggested, but his mind was churning too much to let him settle down. He found himself mentally replaying the conversation on the balcony.  It was probably a joke.  It hadn’t felt like a joke, though, if he was honest with himself.  He rolled over, and kicked a leg out of the covers, running a hand through his hair.
Steve leaned back against the railing on the step above Tony and stared off into the distance for a moment, then looked down at where Tony waited with a grim sort of sadness shadowing his expression.  Tony desperately wanted to warn him not to lean against the obvious building code violation, but held his silence.  Sure, the place was a shithole, but it was Steve’s, and as much as he hated the idea of Steve being here, Tony wasn’t quite enough of an asshole to point out the glaringly obvious level of life suckage going on here.
“That’s a new look for you,” Tony observed.  His voice sounded strained and tight, like each word was dripping out through a sieve.
Steve was frowning down at the phone he still held in one hand, then hit a button and brought it to his ear with a quick, apologetic look at Tony. “It’s the gallery. Must’ve missed their call earlier,” Steve explained.
“Yes,” Steve replied simply, not taking his eyes off where Tony stood, now feeling ridiculous holding what amounted to a partial picnic for the guy who probably hated him at the moment.
Still.
“You said you weren’t going anywhere.  You promised,” Tony breathed out, voice raw, words so torn apart it was as if they were barely held together.  Maybe they were.  Maybe he was.  Everything felt pulled so thin, so close to tearing in two, that he thought maybe it had already begun fraying and that was why he couldn’t seem to let this go. It might not be there when he came back, like it could slip away when he turned, and that, maybe of all the outcomes, was the thing he couldn’t handle.  “
It made no sense.  It just…was. For no purpose.  Except to show skill, Anto supposed, and effort.  But, why would Steve do such a thing and then give it to him?  Some kind of gift-giving ritual, perhaps? Though, Steve didn’t seem to be waiting expectantly for anything.  He just looked…happy. As if he was genuinely pleased that Anto seemed to like it. It must be because Anto helped heal his leg.  That was the only explanation that made sense. The Others must not have healers, whose job it was to help, so perhaps some kind of exchange was expected, but this was far too much.  Far too beautiful for someone like him.
“Well, how about you start acting like it?” Fury suggested, seemingly unconcerned by Steve’s response.
But, he still needed to somehow get Tony to…to snap out of this fantasy without doing more damage.  Which meant that somehow, he had to ease Tony back into reality.  He just had absolutely no idea how to do that.
“That’s…obviously, completely ridiculous.  I know, it’s confusing, this whole evening, but, clearly, I am not the hero type,” Tony started.
“My place has only ever been by your side,” Steve insisted, watching the play of emotions across Tony’s face as he swallowed heavily. Hope, fear, and a desperate kind of aching need, like Steve was offering him something vital.  “I owe you everything.  I owe you all of me,” Steve insisted stubbornly.  “I would give that to you, if you would have me. Whether we say the words here, under the stars, or beneath gilded ceiling, as long as I am with you.”
Tony waved his hand, as if to say it was nothing, but Steve could tell much of the tension had leaked from Tony’s shoulders.  He saw Tony reach for the covering, and found himself, without thinking much about it, saying, “Don’t.”
“Good,” Jarvis said, the word coming out soft and encouraging.  “Remember.  If I’m wrong, I’m only a phone call away.  Here.  This is my private number, not the house phone.  Your parents never wanted me to give it to you, but I suppose it isn’t their business now, is it?” Jarvis said.  He stood up and smoothed out his suitcoat, then put a white business-sized card down on the table next to Tony’s coffee mug.
Tony would understand, Steve thought to himself.  He would find it amusing.  Steve felt his mouth tug up a bit, then sighed and wrapped the metal veil around his head, just above his ears, so the bright, gold leaves covered the lower half of his face.   Twisted ands of gold went around his ankles with jeweled chains that hooked over his toe.  His heart was beating rabbit-quick in his chest, and he could feel his breath coming in tighter, faster beats.  He was half-hard already, the head of his cock jutting proudly from beneath the golden circles.
Standing still was out, so he settled for pacing back and forth along the cracked pavement in front of the steps to Steve's building, drawing curious glances from passersby who were too cold to actually care what Tony was doing. Down the street, a truck's horn blared at a woman pulling a cart full of grocery bags behind her across the intersection's crosswalk. The abrupt noise jolted him like a buzzer sounding at a gate, making his heart hammer out its echo in his chest. He was really going to do this...this whatever it was.
When he was working on the reactor, one of the main issues had been buckling at the pressure points.  No matter how many different ways he’d reinforced the design, each test had come back with some version of the same issue.  Change a valve here, add a neutralization medium there, but the same issue kept cropping up over and over.   Too much pressure in the system and nowhere for it to go except out.
“Steve,” Tony rasped, curling the word into a hum.  He seemed not to have words, either, but that seemed right somehow.  Steve nudged forward into the cradle of Tony’s stomach, and concentrated on the way Tony’s hands felt in his hair, on his shoulders and back, stroking his cheeks.  His cock was heavy and straining against his stomach, leaking drops of moisture on the bed below and his nipples burned cold where the pendant pulled at them, but it was all good and soft and hazy somehow, as if the world itself had blurred while he waited.
“Where?” Tony asked, seeing nothing but road and night in front of them.
about it.
It hadn’t been a dream, the man, Steve was sure of it, and yet...almost instantly, the whole encounter seemed to take on the hazy, unbalanced feeling of a dream.  It felt so real, though, he thought, reaching up to brush his fingers over the broken skin of his lip where the man had cleaned his blood away with his fairy-made cloth.  So real.
Steve stopped so abruptly that Tony almost walked right into him. “It wasn’t because of you, Tony,” Steve said, mouth tugging down into something approaching a frown. “They just didn’t understand, and sometimes, people are afraid of what they don’t understand. But...you didn’t do anything wrong.”
“There’s this whole new data set we’re just getting, and he’s going to send it to me as soon as possible.   Apparently, both LIGO detectors simultaneously observed a transient gravitational wave signal, and I’ve looked at the first data sets, and it could—I’m just saying could—end up being the first observation of a binary black hole merger.  Which is just…I mean, can you imagine it?” Tony asked, splaying his hands wide.
“Tony—“ Steve started, then stopped, and swallowed whatever else he was going to say.  Steve shifted a bit, rocking back and forth on his feet, his hands going to his pockets, then his sides, like he couldn’t figure out what to do with them.  Steve looked at him, then dropped his gaze to the center of Tony’s chest, before clearing his throat and looking away.
“Yes, ma’am,” Steve nodded, smiling as best he could.
could truly explain his actions.
“You just going to stand there and repeat what I say?” Steve asked, crossing his arms over his chest in such a familiar, Steve-is-frustrated way that Tony almost wanted to crack a smile.
Tony tore off the top of a yogurt cup that held a depressingly small amount of granola and dumped it in a pile on top of the deck railing.
He’d made a bit of a joke out of the idea of closure, but he thought he might actually need to do that, for himself more than as something he owed to Brock.  He was just beginning to pull back the layers and see how much he had taken over all these months with Brock, and if he didn’t confront him, at least in some small way, he thought when the anger and recrimination really did hit, he might not be able to stand it.  This way wasn’t perfect by any means, but he had never been one to back away from doing something just because it was hard.  Except, apparently, getting the kind of help he needed when he needed it, he thought with a sigh as he swiped a hand over his face.  Better late than never, he supposed.
“Me, too,” Steve said after a moment. “Not the talking,” Steve continued when Tony gazed dubiously at him.  “The laughing thing.”
Running his hands over his thighs, he worked at the muscles there, stretching and flexing while his cock bobbed, red and straining.  He arched his back again and ground his hips down against the bed with little thrusts that sent pangs of need down the length of his shaft.  Over and over, he stroked his hands over his chest, his stomach, the delicate arch of his pelvis where newly-shorn skin came alive under his fingers.  Massaged his balls again. Tugged at his rim. Spread his legs wider. He felt open, empty, wonderful.
Stark, the blind man Steve had figured out to be Stark’s attorney and the woman, Ms. Potts, were huddled in the penthouse suite’s living room, heads drawn together conspiratorially as they talked in low voices, punctuated by the occasionally outburst from Stark and sharp versions of “Tony!” from Ms. Potts, which seemed to function as anything from a stern ‘no’ to the equivalent of ‘you’re insane,’ as far as Steve could tell.
“What…did you think would happen?” Tony asked slowly, carefully, looking up at Steve with the same bewildered frown.
“Hello there,” the man replied.  His voice was smooth and cultured, though Steve wasn’t exactly certain what that meant, other than the man must read a lot of books, of which there were four in the church library approved for reading, none of which appealed to Steve even if he could read the words.  Who wanted to read some old monk drone on and on about why we were all sinners meant to burn in eternal hell when you had the Reverend to tell you that?  Probably a man like this had a lot of books that didn’t tell you that you were going to hell, Steve guessed, and the man must read those.
The other changes to the cabin were barely noticeable.  The caretakers kept it tidy and saw to repairs.  A fresh coat of paint on the outside, though the same color.  New shingles on the roof.  One of the deck railings had started to rot and warp, so that was new, though stained to match so well you couldn’t tell which one, unless you knew.
“Are you suggesting that you are wrong so often in order to please me?” Steve asked with as serious a frown as he could muster.  “You are
“Yes, but, now, addendum. Starkiller base?  Look, I’m just saying, if you consider the mass of that thing post-suck and the effect of angular momentum on rotation, it would basically just fling people off the surface,” Tony pointed out.  “Not to mention that the waste heat from the Starkiller’s stellar mass to energy conversion is enough to raise the temperature of the atmosphere of the First Order’s megaweapon to nearly 300 million degrees.  I think a strongly worded letter is frankly in order.”
“Or, maybe I’d have you work yourself open.   Finger yourself for hours before I let you add another.  Wouldn’t let you even touch your cock, just get yourself all loose for me until you begged me to fill you.  Would you like that?”  the King asked.  Steve didn’t answer.  He couldn’t.  All words had been driven from his head, as if leaked out through a sieve. His mind was filled with the image the King described, with the King’s words, his voice—dark and deep and slyly aware of how it was affecting Steve--with the way the King was looking at him, hungry and wanton and half-amazed.   “But, for now, allow me to make up a bit for last night.”
“Not well,” Tony admitted after a moment.  He swallowed, trying to work past the lump in his throat, looked over at the box on the shelf, then raised his gaze to Steve’s.
Steve carded his hands through Tony’s hair, breathing out a long rush of air against his cheek as he felt Tony relax against him, the hands that were clutching the back of his uniform unclenching, then rubbing up and down in slow, practiced motions.
“They were jealous, I think.  The other concubines.  That you do not…with them, I mean, that you--that you choose me, and not them,” Steve stammered, feeling his face heat from something other than the water.
“You mean HAL?” Steve replied, then broke into a smile.
“That’s really very generous, Mr. St—Tony,” Steve amended quickly. “Sorry.  Sometimes you remind me of him.”
Though he had lost track of how much time had passed, Steve could see that it was full light out now, and their stew pot fire had dwindled to little more than embers.  Morning.  They’d slept through the night, apparently.  He reached over to the table and tore another page from the Life magazine, then tossed it into the pot, hoping some tinder would help, though the ball of paper just sat there, the edges idly blackening without really catching.  Not that the small flame had been giving them much warmth, but it bothered him that he couldn’t even manage that much for them.
Not. A. Problem.
Well, that wasn’t exactly true, but Tony figured a request for dick pics was really more a second conversation kind of thing.
,” Steve began, glancing around and apparently meaning all the craziness that came with being Tony Stark.  “Not that it’s bad,” he said quickly. “Bucky keeps telling me I gotta leave a shoe behind or something,” Steve said with a sideways smile that Tony returned. “He was teasing me a bit about meeting you back in Bagram,” Steve told him, the blush creeping back on his cheeks again as he looked at Tony from underneath unfairly long lashes, happy and carefree and full of a fond, teasing warmth.  He should look like that more often, Tony decided, raising an eyebrow in question.   “Said he should’ve known I kind of maybe had a thing for you because of how I reacted to your, ah…proposition.”
“Tony.  Please,” Steve managed, though he could not possibly have said what, exactly, he wanted Tony to do.  Tony didn’t seem to mind his lack of direction.  In fact, his smile widened, almost tauntingly, and he wet his lips again, then took Steve’s cock in hand, just holding it like that, the lack of friction or movement agonizing in some fantastic way that Steve could not understand.
Once Steve’s hips stopped bucking, Tony pushed himself up on his knees between Steve’s legs and spread Steve’s knees wide apart.  He wiped his hand down his stomach, coating it in the mess, before wrapping it around both of their cocks and holding them together in his hand, using Steve’s own seed to slicken them as he slid his own cock along Steve’s in his hand.  His thrusts picked up speed, hips pumping and snapping his cock into the circle of his hand where he held Steve’s.
And he was hungry.  Because he hadn’t ever even gotten his dinner, which by now was probably growing interesting types of mold down in Tony’s lab.  His stomach rumbled insistently.  Yeah, ok.
“Oh, God,” Tony moaned, going limp.  He felt like he could simply keep sinking into the bed, boneless and spent.  He tossed a hand over his reddened face for a moment as his hole clenched around Steve’s fingers as Steve pulled them out.  “Steve,” he whined.  “Please,” he said, dropping his arm to the side and looking up at Steve.  “I’m…” he stopped, not sure what he was.
What said, sorry I used your dead best friend to get out of an embarrassing situation?  Was that daffodils?  Jesus.  How he’d managed to take what had seemed like such a great day and fuck it up this much was truly one of life’s great mysteries.  He should put himself on the Millennium Problem list, but he suspected his self-sabotaging stupidity would be languishing there, unsolved, a lot longer than Riemann and his hypothesis.
“Is he not feeling well?  Maybe I should go check on him,” Steve offered, starting to rise.
It occurred to Steve then that Stark was very handsome.  Obviously, Steve was aware of that already on one level, but he had been so overwhelmed and surprised to find Tony Stark of all people standing out here on some random Vegas balcony that it hadn’t quite registered until just now.
Our beach, Tony called it, because he knew Steve liked it here, where the only noises were the waves and the seabirds.  Steve stared at the line in the distance where the waters met the sky. Here, there was nothing between him and home.  No walls.  No guards.  No Tony.  Freedom tasted like salt air and felt like water rushing through his hands, he thought, though that was what death had tasted like, too, and he wasn’t even surprised by the thought anymore.  He wondered if Tony understood what drew Steve here, and thought perhaps he did. Not that Tony would say as much, not directly, anyway.
STOP READING!!!!  There is a Bonus Chapter in my Thank You Fics that is intended to fit between chapter 5 and chapter 6.  I almost just added it, but then didn't want to be all George Lucas about changing things, so feel free to read this as originally posted or stop now and go read the bonus chapter. I think it adds a lot to their dynamic, but that is totally up to you.  Thanks for reading, however you choose to read it!
“This whole, ‘Tony’s going to leave me,’ bullshit,” Tony continued.  “You’re not afraid I’ll leave.  You’re afraid I won’t. That I’ll stay, and love you
“Better,” Cam pronounced with an approving grin as he hurried out.
“Ah, yeah?  Yeah, I did,” Tony replied.  He was honestly a bit thrown that she’d noticed.
That’s not what this is.
“God knows, I’ll drink to that. To being easy,” Tony chimed in, clinking his glass to Steve’s and taking a long drink.
“I’m supposed to go to The Palms tonight at six.  Someone is going to send a suit to our room,” Steve explained.  “Or suits. I think. I couldn’t remember my size. Or, actually, the last time I bought a suit was for mom’s funeral, and I don’t think that’s really going to work anymore. I guess the suit means we’re going somewhere. I don’t know, she didn’t say.”
It was a fantasy, really, or so Steve thought.  So they all thought, though no one would say it, even as test after test failed. The machine had never worked, after all.  It was in pieces in SHIELD’s vaults, covered in plastic, waiting to be put together like some kind of massive puzzle where you had no picture for what the end might look like, though Bruce, Shuri and Rocket managed to put it together eventually.  It looked ancient. Like something out of the B-movies Steve and Bucky used to sneak into down at the nickelodeon. Bulky and old, with huge rings sprouting electrodes and wires and coils, it looked completely out of place in Shuri’s lab. There was no way it was actually going to work.  Actually send anyone back in time.
“So…” Tony cleared his throat, and Steve would’ve said nervously, but since when did Tony Stark do nervous.
“Scan this for me, would you?  Then have it blown up to something that would look good over the fireplace,” Tony said, holding up the phone for the scanner to get a good picture.
“I like the embellishments,” Nyma protested with a practiced pout.  “The King likes the embellishments, too, I think,” she continued, casting a sloe-eyed look at Steve.
“Really?” the young Lord questioned, sounding surprised, but fascinated.
“You never would’ve found me if I hadn’t had to pee,” Barnes called out from somewhere over Steve’s shoulder.
--Excuse me.  Be ready, my King,” Cam assured him.
“They say body heat is best,” Tony informed him, voice already sounding slightly slurry from exhaustion, the medicine, the reprieve from the pain or some combination of all three.  Steve looked the small cot over, then took a deep breath and picked Tony up enough to maneuver himself underneath, settling Tony between his legs and against his chest.  He closed his eyes and breathed out a long, low breath once he had Tony settled.
“So, ah, anyway, like I said, I spoke with Romanov.  If you want to adjust the schedule, we can do that,” Tony offered casually, though it was the kind of casual that was trying to hard to be just that and nothing more, even over the phone, Steve could tell that.  He wants me, Steve thought.  He wants to see me.  If I ask, he’ll send Happy right now, and there was some kind of strange power to that.  In this world where he didn’t seem to have much control over anything, it felt almost heady.
“Heathen,” Tony muttered, but he took the bag when Steve handed it to him.  He drank it down without complaint, at least not an out-loud complaint, though Steve saw him making a rather horrified frown of distaste as he swallowed.  “What about you?” Tony asked, waving a hand at the packets of food.
Except...there was a box, with a circuit he'd built and the matchbook from the by-the-hour hotel they'd stayed in, and Steve's half of their honeymoon photos, and his ring was still sitting there in the box that somehow belonged to Tony.
“No.  Not going to let that one go,” Steve repeated, following his words with a teasing smile, though his voice was a deep, rich rumble that melted into Tony’s skin.
“Good morning,” Steve said, twisting his head up to look at Tony, who was regarding him with arched eyebrows and a satisfied smirk, eyes sparkling with mirth.
Steve drew in a stuttering breath.  It went down his throat and settled in his chest like ice water
“Feel free,” Steve responded, raising an eyebrow and smirking. Tony stared back at him through the HUD.  He wanted Steve out of the way so he could kill Camp.  Or maybe maim him.  But in some really horrible way, so that he could spend the rest of his life reflecting on how he shouldn’t touch Tony’s things.  But attempting to move a Steve who did not want to be moved would mean possibly hurting Steve, and he was physically incapable of doing that.  So, this was a conundrum.  But, he was very smart, so there were tons of options.  He would be thinking of them any minute now.  It was hard when Steve was right there, looking so perfect and wonderful and close enough to touch.
“Stop it,” Steve objected.
“When were these taken?” Steve asked with a frown.  He reached out and plucked the photo from her hand, gazing down at it.
There was such a cautiously hopeful note in Steve’s voice, it thrummed through Tony’s chest and wrapped around his heart, making it hard to swallow past the sudden lump in his throat.
“I’m sure that I will,” Jarvis said carefully.  “But, that wasn’t what I asked, was it?”
“Yeah, I’m sure.  You go ahead. I’ll come find you in a bit,” Steve promised.  Tony regarded him for a long moment, then nodded and gave Steve’s hand a light squeeze.
“Steve, I would like it if you spent your day doing your cuticles,” Tony admitted with some chagrin. Steve held up his fingernails in front of his face speculatively, as if to examine them, and Tony snorted with laughter. “I know we’re Bonded and all, but, you know. Never been exactly a stickler for tradition, so. Whatever. It isn’t a big deal. You shouldn’t…I mean, you don’t have to or anything. Just because we’re Bonded, is all I’m saying.”
“We really don’t,” Tony corrected.
“So, good thoughts, then,” Tony replied in a throaty whisper that made Steve’s stomach flip, and  smiled up at him. He reached up and brushed a wet lock of hair back from Steve’s forehead where it clung to his skin.  Somehow, that slight touch seemed more intimate than anything they had done so far, and Steve felt his skin warming, despite the shiver that coursed through him.  “I like kissing, too.  See? I knew we had something in common,” Tony breathed out, smile softening as he craned his neck up and tugged Steve’s mouth back to his, his tongue flicking and teasing against Steve’s lips until they parted with a groan.
“These will appreciate in value,” Tony said. “It’s an investment in her future.”
“Thanks,” Tony said in a somewhat rough, strangled tone.  He cleared his throat and made something of a show of checking his watch, then looked back up at Steve.  “So.  Dinner.  Wheel of death thing.”
“Is. There.  A. Mission?” Steve asked again, punctuating each word carefully, but with enough force that it cut Coulson off.
“Come on, pumpkin,” Steve laughed, holding the lab door open for Tony.
“That wasn't what—that really wasn't what I was doing,” Tony replied, the words coming out more grating than he meant them, but every part of him was still live-wired over Steve's little past-life goody box, on edge like he was waiting for something to spark, half afraid it would, half afraid it wouldn't.
Neither, apparently, was defeating salmonella, if the temp of his infamous grill was any indication.
He stared at the oil lamps dangling from the arched roof of the tent, their flames flickering and casting dappled shadows across the walls. Outside, he could hear voices raised in conversation again, occasionally punctuated by bouts of loud laughter.
The fish tank was the only bright thing in the room.  Everything else was shadowed in a soft, dim glow.  He wondered if Coulson had said something.  Steve didn’t look at it.  The tank.  He could hear it, of course, the gurgling susurration as the water processed through the filter, soft and churning.
“It’s called silk,” the man said, his eyes twinkling a bit as Steve drew his hand back as if burned. Maybe he wasn’t supposed to touch it. Probably he wasn’t. It had to be expensive. The man wouldn’t want it messed up by the likes of Steve.
Tony let out a long, waffling sigh and threw on something from the nearest stack of clean clothes, which turned out to be blue boxers, jeans and a grey t-shirt that hung loosely on him the way a t-shirt was supposed to, which must mean it was one of Steve’s that had gotten mixed in with his laundry.  He smoothed his hands over the front of it, then lifted the collar and breathed in. It smelled like detergent, of course, and not…freedom, or whatever the hell he’d been half-expecting.
when he wanted to.  All those wonderful muscles bunching into force and momentum, propelling him across the room and in front of Tony so fast, Tony gasped and would have stepped back were he not already sheltered in the doorway.  Instead, his head snapped back in startle, and he probably would have smacked it rather neatly on the doorframe, except Steve’s hand somehow got between his head and the wall, catching the motion.
“I know.  I know, and I shouldn’t have just dropped that on you, obviously, I—I wanted you to know—I thought you need to know.  That I knew. That--so, if you did want out, I mean, I get it,” Tony replied.
“You’re doing the ah-thing again,” Tony pointed out.
“He was mean to you,” Steve replied, still staring at where the Professor had departed, as if the man might return from the bathroom, bolstered with new confidence that would possibly come with a fresh pair of pants.  Tony figured that Tabbert was probably currently planning how he could turn the faculty men’s room into a perfectly fine living space, but said nothing.
Steve watched the sun’s light spread out over the water in long, glowing fingers as it rose for a long moment, then looked over towards the rocks. The creature was there, as it always was this time of morning, basking on the rocks where it soaked up the sun, along with a few of its smaller brethren.
“Hey, no,” Steve said quickly.  His eyes had gone soft, wrinkling just a bit at the corners.  “Whatever you’re telling yourself, no, okay?”
“A gift?  Someone just gives you something like this because you helped them out a bit?  Someone who?” Tony asked quickly, looking down at the watch with an accusatory frown.  Who just gives someone a watch like this?  Well, more to the point, Tony mentally amended, who the fuck gave his Alpha a watch like this, Tony wondered, his mind going from zero to back-the-hell-away-from-my-Alpha in a split second.
“Is he…is he okay?” Tony asked carefully, picking at the words as if they were notes he could play.  He wanted to sound sorry, but it wasn’t working by the look his mother shot him.
“I didn’t even tell him about the money!  Brock, this isn’t about Bucky,” Steve insisted again.  “It’s about us.  This,” he reiterated, sweeping his hand back and forth between the two of them. “Can we just--”
Steve’s hands curled into fists against the counter, where the little vines wound themselves along the edges.
“Sure,” Nat said after a pause.
“As you wish, Your Highness.  I bid you a good evening then. Should you require anything further from me, you know you’ve only to ask,” Zola said smoothly, taking small, mincing steps as he backed out of the chamber with a bow.
Steve wrapped his lips around the round head of Tony’s cock, letting his tongue slide around it.  He loved the feel of the smooth, soft skin pulled taut with Tony’s need.  Carefully guarding his teeth, he sucked, lightly at first, then in earnest, lapping at the head with his tongue and finding the slit, worrying at it with the tip of his tongue until a gush of precome filled his mouth.  Above him, Tony groaned and twisted his hand in Steve’s hair, pulling just enough for Steve to feel the rough pressure of it.  It felt like being lifted, though he knew that wasn’t possible. Still, his body felt buoyant, lighter, and he closed his eyes, falling into the sensation.
“Tony—“ Steve breathed out, fingers clenching around a hilt that wasn’t there. In his mind, he could see Raza bleeding out, the dark stain seeping into the sand until it was almost black with it.
“I guess,” Steve replied, turning back to look out the window.  “They were always after the ward boss, got couple of ‘em, but Mom said it was on account of them bein’ Irish and Catholic.”
“Nothing,” Steve replied.  His voice shook. Or maybe he was shaking.  He didn’t know. “A dream, that’s all.”
The rest of the dinner was just as easy, Tony thought as they exited the restaurant into the idling car.  He felt like he needed Steve to take him on some kind of Brooklyn backalley tour when they made it to New York, after listening to far too many stories that started with something along the lines of, ‘I was getting beat up in this alley when Bucky showed up,’ but all in all, Tony thought it was a good evening. Steve was smart and funny and seemed to enjoy listening to Tony talk, so basically amounted to the real-life equivalent of finding a mermaid riding a unicorn watching a good Adam Sandler movie, as far as Tony was concerned.
“Stark Tower,” Steve cut in, then aimed a huge, wide smile at Tony, who mouthed ‘Dork’ back at him and rolled his eyes.  “Assemble!”
“You’re not killing anyone, Tony,” Steve said from the middle of the hallway.
“Can’t believe DoD went with Boeing,” Howard snorted derisively.  “There was nothing wrong with our specs.  Nothing.  The test parameters were entirely unrealistic!”
it sent a surge of desperation through Steve.
“Hell of a career path,” Tony observed admiringly.  “Wait…Peggy Carter.  Was she the one who was the inspiration for Betty Carver?  From the Captain America Adventure Program?  God, I loved that when I was a kid! They put it out on CD in this neat collector’s case shaped like the shield.  My favorite one was where he rescues her from Hitler and his Nazi guard.  That was great.  I mean, kind of cheesy, but still, it was…” Tony trailed off, looking between Steve and Coulson, who was watching Steve with a raised eyebrow while Steve looked vaguely horrified.  “Well, I thought it was fun, anyway.”
“I wasn’t sure if I was really here earlier,” Tony told him. It seemed important, though he wasn’t sure why.  “But, I am,” he sighed.  “I’m here.  I don’t know where here is. How do you know where here is?”
“Yes, Captain, how may I be of service,” JARVIS responded.
“Very,” Tony said with a soft smile that reached his eyes and made them glisten, cresting into half-moons. “I am
“Probably not, but he did, and he didn’t fight it, so here we are,” Matt replied. “Ready to throw ourselves to the mercy of the completely impartial review board.”
Tony opened his mouth, then closed it and turned his head to look at the horizon.  “I don’t know.  I don’t know a lot of things about me lately,” Tony said, so quietly Steve almost didn’t catch it over the pounding of the surf.  “So, was it art that brought you out here?” Tony asked far more brightly as he turned back to Steve.  “You’re clearly not a native.”
He could feel the gradual pressure building inside him, the familiar tingling sensation inside his cock and sense of a warm weight in his stomach.  He could hear the sharp, jagged little sounds torn out of him each time he took Tony in, mingled with Tony’s hard, guttural grunts.  Steve pulled himself almost all the way off Tony’s cock, letting the round head catch again on his loosened rim, then slammed down, seating himself fully on Tony’s hard length.
Getting the batteries turned out to be the tough part.  They didn’t make the particular models anymore, so he’d had to improvise a new contact board to fit against the tops of the updated batteries.   The rest, he’d cobbled together from the bits and pieces of various radios he’d gotten from the Army-Navy depot and then cannibalized.
“Are you okay, Tony?” Steve asked, voice sounding strained with a concern. And that wasn’t good. Steve shouldn’t be worried about him.  It was his job to take care of—ah.
“This never would’ve happened if it weren’t for me.  Or if I’d have just gotten my shit together instead of being—being this.  I’m sorry, Steve. God, I’m so fucking sorry,” Bucky said, glancing over at Steve.
Which… yeah, Steve sighed.  Sure, it was a trade-off, but still, it had to hurt, and it gutted Steve to think of Tony hurting over what people like this who had no idea what he was like dissecting his every more and syllable.  If these idiots on TV knew Tony at all, they’d know how hard he was trying to do what was right.  Maybe find a bit of redemption, if that was even a thing these days, not that Steve really thought Tony needed it.  Steve was willing to bet none of the people on the TV had ever had to watch young men and women die because of a war that served only the enterprise of war itself.  Tony was
Steve knew he should move. Run. Get out of here.  But, it was like he was stuck in place by some invisible force.  If he looked down, he might see his feet encased in stone where the floor had risen up, pinning him in place like the way that horrible boy who always chased him and pushed him into the mud used to use his mother’s darning needles to pin bugs to the wall while their spindly legs struggled uselessly for escape.
“For an Alpha, you sure have given how Cap fucks a lot of thought,” Rumlow snorted.  “Something you want to tell us?”
“Sounds like you and your broomstick had more success than we’re having,” Steve grinned.  “I loved Will Rogers growing up.  Used to listen to him on The Gulf Headliners every Sunday. He’d get going and forget his time limit, and they’d just cut him right off, so he got this alarm clock to help him tell when it was about time to be done, and then they started calling it Will Rogers and His Famous Alarm Clock. He was so funny.  I’d laugh and laugh, until my mom turned it off so I wouldn’t start with one of my coughing fits.”
“That’s...you’re not...that isn’t JARVIS, is it?” Tony asked, looking over at the alien.  “You interfaced with his voice system somehow, is that it? With this...stuff, this nano-gel or whatever it is.  So you could talk to me? In like, five minutes. Wow, that’s….actually, you know, that might actually be the hottest thing you’ve done, and that’s saying something.  Anyway, okay, so, you’re saying this will heal me. Gotta ask you to go into a bit more detail here, ‘cause, ah, from where I’m, ah, laying, I have to admit, I’m a little skeptical.  I mean, it isn’t the first time someone offered to fuck me into feeling better, but, ah, going to need some specifics here.”
ness that he had felt being somehow connected to the alien.  To Steve.  He probably shouldn't miss it, but right now, as he could almost feel the tethers slowly stretching and fading away, he coudln't help but long for it.  Must be worse for Steve, he thought. After all this time.  All this time being alone.  That had to be hard on the guy. Tony sighed, scraping a hand over his face and looked up at the alien--Steve-- tall and pale and exotically beautiful in the starlight where he stood next to Tony at something resembling parade rest.
?” Tony demanded, almost plaintive in his confusion, his face scrunching up as he shook his head.
Tony was using one of his machines, of course, those incredible impossibilities that seemed to Steve to be born fully formed from Tony’s mind.  This one was alternately terrible and fascinating, at least in Steve’s mind, making Tony look like some kind of creature of nightmares who rose up from the depths of the sea.  As Tony had explained to Steve at length the evening after the first time Steve watched him use it, when Steve spent the long moments of Tony’s dive pacing back and forth and peering down at the place where the leather hose carrying precious air disappeared beneath the waves, this particular machine was capable of sending air through a bellows and down the hose to Tony, where he breathed out another hose that was connected to the suit’s mouthpiece.
The other half of the time…fuck. The other half of the time was spent wondering.  Wondering what it would be like to answer without even having to pause to wonder if it was the right answer, the way he could when it really was an equation.
“Plans,” Steve clarified.
“Yeah. Exactly,” Tony said, flashing a flat smile at Steve.  “Guess we should head in, huh?” he jerked his head towards the limo’s window, where a couple of tourists were leaning close enough that their breath was practically fogging up the glass.
They had been so young, Tony remembered, pinching the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger as he let out a long hiss of air.  He leaned forward and braced his hands around the top of the dresser, then looked up at his reflection in the mirror.  So damn young, he thought again.  They’d paid the price for his mistakes far more thoroughly than he ever had.  He owed them this, owed them some justice, however hollow the comfort may be.  If Obie was really behind his kidnapping, the funneling of weapons to terrorists and now…now this
Steve frowned, then leaned forward on all fours and crawled up the bed until he had a hand on each side of Tony’s hips and a knee on either side of Tony’s outstretched legs.  “You really think I care about that? You’re beautiful, Tony. Besides, I’ve seen enough guys with war wounds far worse, I’m sure. It isn’t going to bother me.”
“I felt like she was going to end that with ‘spit-spot’, didn’t you?” Tony asked, pushing himself away from the table while Ms. Potts glared at him.
“Sorry.  Didn’t realize this was taken,” the man said, though made no move to leave, just sort of held himself there, expectantly.
It turned out that Le Bernadin will deliver if your last name is on the side of a giant tower in the middle of Manhattan.  Bless Pepper, Tony thought as they wheeled trays of food inside. Steve’s phone buzzed while the table and dishes were being set up, which was a feat in and of itself in Steve’s tiny apartment, though none of the servers commented on the strangeness of it all, and Tony shoved a wad of cash at them before they left.
“Tony…” Steve started, mouth flattening around the word.  “This is crazy.  You know that, right?  God, I can’t…” he broke off, running his hand, the injured one, Tony noted, up and down over the center his chest in a tight fist, the fingers working and rubbing against each other in a nervous, stuttering gesture.  Steve was shaking his head, his eyes squeezed shut as he let out a hiss of breath.  “I can’t do this.”
Life really wasn’t fair.  Honestly, he’d tried.  He’d gotten all dolled up, put his game face on, walked the Green Mile and come in here, only to have verbal diarrhea at the last minute because he couldn’t figure out what the guy wanted from him.  Compatible?  Well, your knot will fit fine in my ass, and that’s all anyone cares about, so yeah, we’re compatible.  Move the fuck on.  The dog and pony Newlywed Game was getting stale really fast.
“You have a good eye,” Rumlow replied, oily and smooth, watching Steve with a careful, considering look.  Rumlow loathed him, Steve knew.  The feeling was mutual.  He wanted to get rid of Steve, even if they had to take a loss on the deal, but their own, strange code required the slavers to divulge issues with their wares, lest they find themselves suddenly without buyers.  “We just had a ship in not two days ago. Fine lot.  Laborers, mostly, but I’m told there are a few who might be worth our efforts.”
a big deal.  I think you’re smart enough to understand why.  It’s a lot of pressure on you.  Probably too much, to be honest.  If you don’t want to do it, I’m sure something else can be arr—“ Coulson started.
The arrangements, of course, concerned Steve’s mom.  That had been his one trip out, finding it rather nice to not have to worry about hiding where he was going Sunday afternoons.  He wasn’t sure if his mom’s condition was improving, though the doctors seemed optimistic, but at least it wasn’t continuing to deteriorate.  He was amazed at how quickly you could go to measuring success in tiny, tiny increments.  He’d stopped at the Accounts department, unable to feign any moment of surprise when the nice woman at the desk told him his mom’s account had been taken care of.
The man
“Wh—oh.  No.  No, it’s completely clean.  Honest,” Steve promised, feeling his cheeks heat as he tried, somewhat successfully, to manage to swallow around the words without choking.
“There you are,” Steve said brightly.  “Thought I’d lost you.”
Maybe Tony liked those things fine, but didn’t want to go with Steve. That hurt, he could admit, but as much as he wanted to go with Tony--a whole night with Tony on his arm...yeah, he wanted to go--the idea of Tony agreeing because he thought he had to, manipulative on a good day, Steve could acknowledge, even though he understood putting on a good front for the higher-ups, suddenly made Steve feel like, well...someone he didn’t want to be.
“Why don’t you listen?  Huh?  How many times—Jesus, Tony, I was still working with those!  Now, they’re—junk.  Useless.  Put in some stupid toy,” Howard said, voice going high and tight, too loud in the quiet, with just the soft whir of the camera recording and the heavy silence that followed Howard’s outburst.  He was bent over, shaking the robot in front of Tony’s face, and Steve could taste metal in the back of his throat and realized his whole body had gone rigid with the need to move, to do something, to stop this, this dawning horror, because he had been there before, on his knees, tiny and small and scared while someone shouted, someone loud and big. Someone who could hurt.  “I told you not to go poking around in my lab, didn’t I?  Didn’t I?  Answer me!”
“I’m not a kid.  I’ve got two Masters and a PhD and a company on the verge of bankruptcy.  I’m not a fucking kid,” Tony spat back, jerking back and giving Steve a scathing look.
“A gift from the Raj’Inama,” she chanted, over and over, as she handed out the food to a wave of cheers and high-pitched squeals of thanks.
As Tony cleaned him, Steve wondered if maybe this was the not-so-subtle hint portion of the evening.  After all, Tony had gotten what he paid for, he thought with a sickening sort of cold realization pushing all the happy endorphins to the side.  He always hated the awkwardness afterwards.  Somehow being told to leave felt like he had done something wrong and was slinking home with his tail between his legs.  It had felt like Brock’s neighbors were all watching them through their peepholes, knowing what he had been doing, and knowing he wasn’t good enough to warrant staying the night. Walk of shame and all that. Not like he hadn’t done it before, though.  Some people weren’t comfortable with people in their bed, no matter what they had been doing together right before. Didn’t mean anything, some people just didn’t like that.  Heck, it had taken Brock ages to get to a point where he wanted that kind of intimacy.
Quickly, Steve stood up and began removing his robes. His fingers shook as they skated over the clasps of the outer robe, but he finally managed to get one undone.
“Tony,” Steve said, voice rough and almost hoarse, like the words hurt to say.  “You don’t need to do this.”
“Hard to imagine.  Corporal, this is my Omega, Tony Stark. Tony, this is Corporal Ellers,” Steve told him, turning to nod at Tony.
He was different, though, this Omega, and Steve was not sure yet of his ways. He was from an entirely different people, after all, with many strange customs, though this was hardly the first time Steve had encountered such odd ideas. The Clan entrusted with his care had been a woeful lot, not worthy of an Omega. They bargained for him, as if he were a trinket. They traded a bit of earth and stone for him, and Steve kept his word, for he had promised the Omega, and so the stones were safe and the people within them were safe. For the most part. Steve didn’t consider the Omega’s enemies to be worthy of a promise-bond, and that would have made killing them require a penance to their Clan. He had no desire to wait around for such matters. This way was better. More time to spend with the Omega.
“Oh, don’t even--Look, much as it pains me that Alec Baldwin gets to hold both the #1 and #2 slots on the TMZ celebrity street fight list, can we take this circle-jerk inside?”  Tony demanded flatly, gesturing towards the building.
The alien glanced at the window, then back to Tony.
“I know!  That’s basically what I said about it.  And see?  Here we have a situation where that exact kind of knowledge comes in handy.  I mean, let’s face it, with us, you really never know.  Better to be prepared, I say, instead of just flying by the seat of your pants, hoping for the best, reacting instead of thinking it through—you’re just going to let me go on, aren’t you?  You’re far less judgmental like this,” Tony observed flatly.  Steve dropped the breadstick on the ground, then let out a distressed whine as he flexed his empty hand, lip trembling and forehead scrunched in confusion.  “Or not,” Tony amended.
“A few years,” Steve finally echoed in a stilted, curt tone that didn’t fit the words and bothered him for some reason, though Tony couldn’t figure out why, but he wanted to take back the whole conversation.  There was something buzzing in his ear, something he couldn’t see, but was setting his teeth on edge about the whole thing.
The lights must have been carefully chosen for the suite, Steve realized as his gaze darted around the rooms, because the experience was different at night, setting off the various artworks in new ways.  It really was truly beautiful.  He glanced over at Tony.  Tony was beautiful, too, he thought, though it felt like some kind of deeper secret knowledge he had somehow obtained than just observing the artworks.
“That’s right,” Tony said, smiling softly again, though there was a tightness to it that hadn’t been there before. “Like a million bucks.”
“Impressive,” Steve replied.
“Anyway, Peter said when the train stopped, the nuns got them all out and took them to this church in the middle of town, and all these moms and dads came to look them over, see which orphans they wanted,” Steve continued.  “’Cept Peter, see, he didn’t like the looks of the people who picked him. Said they just wanted someone to work their farm, not like a real kid, you know? So, he ran away, all of eleven, mind you, and somehow made it down to New Orleans and onto a ship bound for Barbados, which is how he got himself hired on with Stark Trading Company.  Pretty impressive for just a kid, right?” Shellhead nodded, once, slowly, a grimace spasming over his face before it was quickly wiped away.
“Can I get a witness?” Rhodey asked the room in a deep, commanding voice.
Tony’s eyes widened in shock and his mouth fell open for a heartbeat, then snapped shut. He stared down at Steve, his expression hardening.
“It’s not just about the arm! There’s the VA appeal…that can still happen.  We’ve got your appointment tomorrow, remember?” Steve reminded him, turning to face him, adrenaline coursing through his veins.  He needed Bucky to stop thinking like that.  That this wasn’t going to get better. That there wasn’t a way out.  He wasn’t even sure if that’s what Bucky was thinking anymore, or if it was just him, or which one of those scenarios was worse.  “Tony’s coming with us, by the way,” Steve rushed on.  “If that’s okay? He thinks it’ll look weird to the press if I’m there with you and he isn’t, but I think he really just wants to try to help.  He does that. Wants to help.  He really does.  So much of this…hell, that’s what
Until then, Steve had believed he understood how much he had missed Tony, but seeing him again, the air left Steve’s chest in a rush, and he felt almost dizzy with relief, as if he had spun round and round in MacGregor’s field until he fell down in a heap while Bucky laughed and told him he looked like Old Duncan, who made drink from the sap that dripped from the pines and stumbled through town trying to trade acorns and mushrooms he’d gathered when he got hungry enough.  He and Bucky had tried them, once, trading the few turnips and potatoes Steve had on him that day for the mushrooms, a sip of the concoction and Old Duncan’s promise that they would feel like they were flying.  They had ended up with stomach cramps for their troubles, and Steve had gotten his ears boxed by his mom and a good talking to, but he still remembered the thrill of that first bite, closing his eyes and expecting something amazing to happen.  That, finally, they would have something that was on the other side of hunger and work and another day of the same.
. If he laughed, this man would kill him.  He had no doubt of that.  Not today, maybe.  Not right now.  But, he would see that it happened, and that it happened in a way that was probably beyond Steve’s ability to imagine the horror of it.  And Zola would see that Cam shared Steve’s fate.
She had written it with care, the way she did most things, but this…he could almost see her, snipping off a piece of tape with sharp, silver scissors.  The lengths were cut, not torn.  She had wanted it straight.  A thick pen, black, one that would keep with time.
“I guess there’s a lot that goes into what you do that I didn’t realize,” Steve said.
“Purple,” Fury said. “Uh—ah—Look, you are not having furniture delivered, Stark. Captain Rogers’ quarters are perfectly fine the way they are.”  Considering Fury probably slept handing upside down, Tony decided to disregard, well, most anything he said.
“Colonel Phillips?  My God, is that really you?” General Briar asked, sounding astonished.
“Will be there when we arrive, as you keep telling me,” Tony assured him, voice low against Steve’s ear, warm breath tingling on his cheek. “He would not want you to be in pain to earn a few extra hours.”  Steve stared down at the small vial in Tony’s palm for a moment, then took it and dug out the cork, downing the bitter mixture before he thought better of it.  He hated it.  The weakness it signified.  But, he couldn’t deny it, wouldn’t, at least not to Tony. “Good,” Tony said, studying him intently.  “Now, sit.  Rest.”
“Apologies for the heterosexuality,” Rhodey replied, then grinned at Tony’s smirk.
“You like it,” Tony replied.  “Keeps you on your toes.  Makes you shrug that boulder off your, let’s face it, incredibly broad and seriously built shoulders every once in a while. It’s a good look on you, by the way.  This whole, new, hey-maybe-the-entire-world-doesn’t-rest-solely-on-me thing you have going.”
“Tony, then.  My mom always called me Steven, at least when I was in for it. Which was a lot of the time,” Steve told him, mouth twisting into a grimace.  He shouldn’t have said that. Why would he say that?  Tony would think he had been a troublemaker. Granted, that wasn’t without some merit, Steve could acknowledge.
“Buck—“ Steve started.
Stane was offering him a way home.  Him, Cam, and Cam’s mother.  The impossible thing he wanted.  It hardly seemed real.
“Unhelpful.  You know, you’re not exactly perfect yourself,
He stuck out his hand toward Tony, “Hi.  I’m Steve Rogers.  I’m twenty-five, and a part-time art student in New York.  I work odd jobs in between, usually in construction or painting.  About four months ago, I got a phone call that my mother had been hit by a car as she walked across a cross-walk and was in intensive care with something they called a Traumatic Brain Injury.  I took the bus out here and crashed on my best friend’s sofa for a bit while I tried to figure things out.  Turns out, even after insurance, there were a stack of bills to pay off and Mom didn’t have much in the way of savings from her waitress job.  The only ongoing care insurance would cover was in a county hospital for long-term care and when I visited there, I thought I’d rather do just about anything than leave her there to die slowly while I went on with my life.  But I had no idea what to do about it.  My best friend, Bucky, got me a job with the company he works for and I did as many extra shifts as I could, but it wasn’t enough.  Not by a long shot.  I got pretty desperate as the hospital started pressuring me to move her to a long-term facility.  Bucky’s roommate Clint, mentioned an option that he’d used in the past when he was short on cash.  It was one of those ‘seemed like a good idea at the time’ things, but when I met my first client…I panicked.  Then I met this amazing guy at a party and he was wonderful and kind and funny and passionate and so brilliant that I just wanted to stop and listen and just be in his space, even if I had no idea what he was saying.  I didn’t know how to tell him that I wanted him, not his money, but also desperately needed his money.  I kept trying to make that sound right, but couldn’t get there, and then he had this big presentation, and I didn’t want to burden him…so I waited.  Or let myself wait, I don’t know who I was doing that for, him or me.  But then it all went to hell and now I think he blames himself for something that was completely not his fault, that he only made better in so many ways, and I don’t know how to get him to believe that except to tell him how much I love him and hope he believes me.”
“Howard!  We have company!” Maria called out in a tight, urgent voice.  Stane ducked his chin to his chest, huffed out a sigh and shook his head, wiping a hand over his mouth as he looked over at the wide-eyed Van Dyne with a telling look.  The two girls stood stock-still, mouths ringed in red and purple, with their popsicles hovering in front of them.  Jarvis looked, well.  Ready to kill, Steve thought, watching the man take a step towards Tony, an appeasing hand held out in front of him, the way one might approach a wounded animal.
“Am I forgiven, then?” Steve called out to the waves.  A few of its tentacles broke the surface, twirling in a mass, and then its head, which it dipped in apparent acquiescence.  “Thanks,” Steve said, then with more seriousness, “I am sorry, Shellhead. I didn’t mean--I know you’re not like the other, ah, well.  Not like anything, really. I shouldn’t have made a joke.”
The pressure was constant, pulsating through his groin and stomach, down his cock and pushing against his prostrate like he kept touching a livewire.  He wasn’t sure how long they stayed like that, locked together, Steve pressing his mouth against the sweat-streaked skin of Tony’s neck, plastering his hair to his head in slow strokes.  Steve’s hand working his nipples, then lower, palming Tony’s cock and flicking his wrist in slow, leisurely twists around the head.
“Tony?” Steve asked, dropping his hands and stepping back. “Are you still hurt? I thought the cradle…”
Steve watched Tony turn to the guards. “See that we are not disturbed,” Tony ordered. Well, that sounded ominous, Steve thought, swallowing thickly past his suddenly dry throat.
“Oh, ah,” Coulson stopped, holding out a hand when Howard started to follow along behind.  “Just Anthony, Mr. Stark.  Agent Thompson here will show you and Mrs. Stark to a waiting area where I’m sure you’ll be comfortable. Snacks.  Drinks.  Cable TV.  We’ve got all the toys,” Coulson promised, though there was something almost challenging running under the words, nice as they seemed on the surface.
“Hey, not my fault you named them,” Tony pointed out with a shrug.  “Besides, fish ponds. That’s a thing people have.  Charming in a quirky sort of way. Totally normal, though.”
“I know that, Stark,” Fury said, rubbing his forehead with his hand. “I thought he was okay now?” Fury asked, directing the question at Steve and ignoring Tony’s disgruntled look.
Tony walked over to the bed, shrugged off the robe he was wearing and climbed in, kneeling next to Steve.  Hands cupped the sides of Steve’s face and tilted it until he was looking up at the outline of Tony’s face.  Steve’s mouth went dry.  His throat clicked as he tried to swallow.  He wished he could see Tony’s expression, but the dark hid it from him.  Reaching up, he wound his hands around Tony’s wrists and rubbed his fingers over the delicate skin on the insides. He could feel the tension vibrating under Tony’s skin, hear the slow, harsh breaths, and had the thought that Tony could be terrible in his anger, though it wasn’t a thought that scared him, not anymore.
“—then you shouldn’t bring it—Wh--What?” Bruce stammered. “What?”
“How was class?” Rhodey tried.
“Ah, right, dinner. I could, um…” Tony trailed off, glancing around with a slight look of panic on his face.
“You inspired me, actually,” Tony said.
His head jerked backwards. He couldn’t help it. Twin stabs of pain flared behind his nipples, and he made some kind of sound around Tony’s cock that might have been a moan. Trying to relieve the biting pain in his nipples, he shifted his neck a bit but as soon as he moved the hook in his ass pulled hard against his rim. He tried to lean his head back again, but Tony’s hand in his hair held him steady and the concordant pull on his nipples kept him from relief. He kept searching for some middle ground but there didn’t seem to be one. It was one kind of pain or another, and either one seemed to bury itself at the base of his cock and send pulses of fiery need down to the weeping head.
“Yes, well,” Tony admitted with a shake of his head. “It really will be fine. I would hardly risk you and Cam, let alone Rhodey and the others, did I not think it safe. It is only two nights. We will be back behind the Gate before you know it. Would have been faster, but I must meet with the Ul tonight. It would be rude not to, much as I would like to avoid him.”
“How’d I get into the oldest profession in the book?” Kirk finished for him, eyebrows raised to a peak.  “My parents—well, my Dad—cut me off because I was enjoying life too much, so I decided why not make money doing something I enjoy anyway and continue to disappoint both of them at the same time?  Win-win, as far as I can tell.”
“I understand them about you, Tony.  That’s—that’s how I feel about you, too,” Steve confessed quickly, before Tony could bolt.  Tony’s hand fell form the doorknob, and he turned slowly to face Steve, disbelief and something like hope warring for prominence on his features.  “And if I’d realized I might not get to see you again, I would have told you that I am drag you to safety, give you the medicine, keep you warm, let you have the food, pray for rescue, want to wake up and see you kind of crazy in love with you.  Tell me you would have done any differently if our positions were reversed.”
, dammit, and a nearly overwhelming need to hide it away from everyone else kept rearing its head whenever Brock said anything about it.
They followed her through the casino and out past the Cirque du Soleil theater, where huge posters of gravity-defying performers hung on the wall.  The restaurant’s entrance curved outward and heralded the famous chef’s name over the door.  Black and white patterned tiles crisscrossed the floor underneath a glass chandelier dripping with beads that looked almost too heavy for the ceiling.  They were met by the maitre’d, a tall, thin man dressed all in black who welcomed them with a thick, French accent and escorted them to a table in the middle of the restaurant that was flanked by an elongated, curved purple sofa on one side and black lacquered, cream-backed chairs on the other.  Tony took the chair the maitre’d pulled out, leaving Steve to slide into the sofa…thing.
It was so different. He’d thought being wanted meant getting to the real stuff in a hurry, but this languid exploration somehow managed to make him feel Tony’s urgency even more, which he supposed didn’t make sense, but the thought buzzed around in his head nonetheless. Steve’s body felt like an instrument being played by a master. He was heady with desire, dizzy with it and the near-weightlessness of the pool around him.  The wet heat of Tony’s body slid against his own, slick and hard over his skin as Tony moved his hips in an imitation that sent unbidden images flicking across the backs of Steve’s eyelids like one of those old ViewMaster toys, but it was the occasional murmurs of praise in between kisses that made his insides seem to melt.  Beautiful, gorgeous, so good, Tony liked to talk. Steve wasn’t entirely sure the other man knew he was doing it, but the words made something light up deep inside Steve’s chest and seem to glow with a warmth that seeped into his bones.
Steve also thought of Tony mentioning how his father would be gone for weeks at a time, but always return with a smile, pat on the head and an expensive gift.  It was hardly any wonder Tony had learned to show affection by lavishing ridiculous gifts on people, Steve thought with a disgruntled sigh.
He opened his eyes to brightness.  No.  Not brightness. A light.  A sliver of blue light, cutting a bright line through the darkness.  He blinked again.  Not a line of light.  Light escaping under a door, he realized.  He was in the Tower.  As soon as he thought it, it seemed crystal clear, and he wondered why he hadn’t noticed it before.  He was in a hallway in the Tower.  The hallway outside Tony’s room.  There was an Iron Man painting hanging next to his shoulder done by six-year-old Callie, who won a contest at her library in Scranton with it and gotten a fifty-dollar savings bond and a certificate.  Iron Man was handing out glowing flowers to a group of people, two cats, and an iguana with a collar that said his name was Earl.  Tony had asked for a copy and given her a full scholarship to the college of her choice one day.  Steve remembered thinking how casual Tony could sometimes be with his generosity, throwing money around like it meant nothing.  Maybe it didn’t mean anything to him.  It was hard to tell with Tony, sometimes. It
Tony looked at him blankly for a moment, then put his coffee cup down and leaned back in his chair.  “What is your life?” he demanded incredulously, but he was smiling, wide and carefree, so Steve counted it as a win.  They discussed the relative merits of a proportional response, at least as it related to candy thievery, for a good half an hour while they finished breakfast and Tony downed the remainder of the coffee.
“Are you—is that a threat?” Tony demanded, launching himself off the sofa to pace around the room.  “This isn’t even…there’s nothing here, Obie.  It’s lies.  It wasn’t even real.  Dad got some judge he paid off to sign a bogus order.  I never even saw this.”
Steve stared at him blankly.
That was nearly a week ago. It was the last time Steve mentioned anything about the Bonding to anyone, until Coulson told him the negotiations were complete and Anthony would be coming to meet Steve here at SHIELD, an unfortunate necessity given that Steve had a mission in the works that had required far too much planning to delay.  Steve would have far preferred Anthony’s home or someplace a bit more neutral than a SHIELD conference room for their introduction, but under the circumstances, it couldn’t be helped, he supposed. Privately, he wondered if this was part of some machination he couldn’t quite see, like so much of what went on under Fury’s purview, though he didn’t object.  He was probably destined to make a fool out of himself no matter what, but at least here, he had something of his feet under him. Everything was familiar by now. He wasn’t going to spend an hour watching people heat food in minutes in what he’d learned was called the ‘microwave,’ or ask the money machine in the wall to give him money like it was some kind of magic lamp.  That had been embarrassing.
