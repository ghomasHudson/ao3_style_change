It was quite ironic really. Although John had worked and studied in a hospital, the thought of staying there as a patient did not sit well with him... The certain smell in the air, different scents for different parts of the hospital, from all sort of diseases and sickness.. No, he would not go to hospital. It sent shivers down his spine.
John was lifted up slightly by Sherlock's pulling of the jumper he was wearing, and he straightened up to aid him. The piece of clothing came off relatively easy, and below was a simple button-up shirt that would be easy to undo. It was at this point that John realised that he was still wearing his boxers around his waist and he shuffled underneath Sherlock to reach them in order to rid himself of them.
John could faintly feel the soft towel on his stomach, wiping it dry. It brought him back from the edge enough to let him open his eyes slightly. He watched Sherlock walk back into the bathroom, and come back. John hoped that he would somehow get the covers over him, but Sherlock instead got underneath them. He didn't blame Sherlock, he probably forgot that he was lying on top of the sheets. The cool air was uncomfortable on John's skin, he so desperately wanted warmth, but his body worked against him. Slowly, and labourisly, he inched himself up towards the pillows until he could bring up his legs to grab and pull the cover over him. The warmth blanketed him and only aided the invasion of sleep on his mind. It would be safe to say that he had never felt this tired and weighed down before. He turned his head on the pillow to face Sherlock, looking at him through inched open eyes. "Love you..." He mumbled, voice heavy with drowsiness.
Was he? John was uncertain about Sherlock's promise, but he knew that he meant well in his words, and tried to believe them. He lifted his head into the kiss and returned it on Sherlock's chest.
Sherlock jumped up the second John had left the room, barely able to contain his excitement. He rushed to the coat rack, grabbed his coat and scarf, put it on. To the kitchen, where he grabbed a few things and stuffed them in his pockets. His view fell on a tray which he took to check his looks. He ran his hand through his hair to rearrange it. Not that he was interested in anybody's opinion on his looks, but they were one of the many ways to manipulate a person. Maybe he'd need to do that. Also John... steps on the floor. He was returning already! Sherlock dropped the tray immediately and ran back to the front door. He arrived just in time and the second John entered the room he turned up his coat collar and watched the reaction from the corner of his eyes.
John could feel his mind becoming sharper, his mind more alert. Yes, he felt like shit, but it was better than before, when he was nearly exploding from frustration. But, he would welcome a bed with wide open arms, and the chance to touch Sherlock again, perhaps not in an entirely innocent way... Oh, but they needed to make sure that he was ok first, that was obviously Sherlock's number one priority; making sure John was safe. He supposed, it was his priority also, after all, it was his own life. Maybe it was a one time thing...? Like a migraine or chickenpox. What was the time? John realised that he had lost all sense of that word since they stole the car, which they would have to return. It was quite disorientating, and he knew it would be hell to get back into the swing of sleeping nights and staying awake through days. He looked over to Sherlock. He had his eyes on the road, focused. Preoccupied? Worried? Most definitely.
He didn't dare open his eyes, in case the light still hurt them, or in case he couldn't see anything ever again. Darkness was his comfort, his safety. Sherlock... He was there, John knew he wouldn't leave him. His heart hammered.
They stayed there, in each other's presence and hold, until they were interrupted by the clinking sound of wine bottle on plaster, and the unmistakable clear voice that followed. "I'm sorry to break up this little "moment"," she capitalised the "moment" with air quotation marks, "But dearest mother wants to talk to you, you know, after not seeing you for, what, 8 years now? Hopefully, your little bitch here," She spat, glaring at Sherlock, " Will not misbehave." John fought the urge to enclose her neck with his hands at the derogatory term she had thrown at Sherlock. It seemed that Sherlock sensed this struggle, and tightened his grip around John's arms. John nodded stiffly to Harry, who waltzed away. "God if I was in a room alone with her..." He growled to Sherlock.
"No hospitals... N," John yawned and felt his breathing deepen, "No hos....pitals....." The noise of the world grew silent, and before he knew it, John was asleep.
Of course Sherlock had noticed that John had wanted to touch his scar and he would have said something about it if his eyes had rested on it for longer. He knew that John was uncomfortable with Sherlock kissing his shoulder. Was he supposed to feel the same way about the scar? John's hand was a bit cold, but still he stayed silent. It was a miracle to lay next to him, in such a position anyway. "You're safe, I promise", Sherlock whispered and placed a kiss on John's head again.
He sat down with a 'humph' and settled his cup down on the covered table with a solid thump. He looked up at Sherlock. The detective hadn't got much sleep last night, that much was evident from the bags developing under his eyes. He would've been worrying. That was one of his specialties, worrying. And it was John's job to worry about HIM.
“You couldn't stand the fact of never seeing me again. Of course you didn't tell me that you were on a suicide mission, that you wouldn't return. You are not as heartless as you might think, Sherlock.”
Sherlock was happy that he could do John some good. After their kiss he took a break from it and just stared at John. He looked at his face, bright and clear in front of his own, his eyes, his lips, his nose. Sweet perfection.
They must've looked a pair, with John in ruffled clothes and unkempt hair, leaning harshly against Sherlock, who looked, as always, as if he had just stepped out of a movie set, his hair perfect and clothes uncreased. Nevertheless, her wide smile never faltered, even though John looked like he was drunk. Once they had shuffled up to the desk, she spoke in a clear and sharp voice, John had a feeling that her pronunciation of 's' would be able to cut right through him.
"And I was meant to sniff them out like a blind bloodhound? What was the point if me searching for something without even knowing I was doing that? Huh?"
John felt the comforting squeeze of Sherlock tightening his grip on his shoulders, and nestled into it. He wanted Sherlock, as soon as they got into the room, but he knew he wouldn't be able to do anything. Frustration bubbled up again. Could he? As they were waiting for the elevator, John gently pushed away from Sherlock.
Solve the case today, John surely was overestimating Sherlock's abilities! Although he might be able to do it with the right motivation. He got stuck looking at John's smile while he answered it with his own. “Only around you”, he replied absentmindedly and wanted to continue the happy atmosphere and laughter, when suddenly John stopped. Why? Why did he do that? What did just happen? Sherlock's mind started to race against time. What did just happen? Where was the mistake? Silence all around. What did he just say? Stupid autopilot, stupid social rules! Only around you... Sherlock's eyes widened as he realized his words and their meaning. At least it felt like they did. But it was not like he couldn't control himself. He would just act stupid. He was Sherlock. He didn't understand what humans did. So he looked at John as if he didn't understand the silence.
He had to sit down again as he remembered what had happened so far. Jim was both admirable and to be feared.
“As if you weren't already!”, I heard Anderson say from behind. I had to take a deep breath to control myself. A right placed hit would have been the right medicine for that guy, but I knew I couldn't do that. Still, what was he even doing here? What was his use? Mocking Sherlock? He was examaning some part of the floor that surely was irrelevant, Sherlock would have done so minutes ago otherwise. So how did that ignorant piece of... how did he dare insult him?!
John's lips were met with Sherlock's crashing into them, a force that took him back slightly, but also rivalled his competitive side. He pressed harder against Sherlock's face and closed his eyes to enjoy the sensation. Once again, he ran his fingers into Sherlock's hair, they separated at the Palm to allow room for Sherlock's ear. John loved this, feeling Sherlock's hair with the addition of his fleshy earlobe in between his fingers.
As they arrived at the elevator and waited for it, Sherlock held John even closer. He wanted and needed this closeness now.
He held his food in his hand without eating it. Although he was hungry he couldn't eat. It didn't feel like the right time for it, his throat felt constricted. He could never give in to pleasures.
No doubt they would be leaving tomorrow, and leaving mum here with Harry. They could put her in John's old room... No, no, it's much too dangerous, and she had always been a countryside woman anyway, she wouldn't settle in any city, much less London.
Sherlock hurried to bring his clothes in the right position again and ran his fingers through his hair in a fruitless attempt to make them look untouched.
Johns face hardened when he listened to him speak, turning his head to look at him and he met Sherlocks eyes with fire in his own. "Sentiment is for the losing side?" He growled before clenching his fists "No Sherlock, you are wrong. Its sentiment, love and caring that keeps you fighting till the end, which helps you win." He said "And you have no right to talk about sentiment when you have my tatty union jack pillow which you keep refusing to get rid of Sherlock." He said firmly, glancing away briefly before sighing, shaking his head before looking away from him "You can be so bloody cold... I clearly must be on the losing side then since I care about you massively and I also Lov-" the male stopped what he was saying, shaking his head as he knew he couldnt continue that sentance, wouldn't tell Sherlock of his feelings
Sherlock placed his hand on John's arm trying to give him a little insurance to the fact that this counted for him too. He would never let him go.
“Oh I believe you, Mr. Watson, I do”, Jim purred, “But don't you think I would come in here with an insurance?”
As he leant, an ache grew against the side of his head. It seemed whenever he moved his head to any extreme, the ache would develop. Slowly, he slotted the metal into the socket, and heard the schink of it clasping into place. It took him some strength to swing himself back into an upright position, and once he was settled, the seat felt like heaven on his back. His head felt devoid of liquid, maybe he hadn't drank enough? Could that be been the reason he had a headache? John knew that people developed symptoms like his when they were dehydrated, but not as potent as his. To the side, he felt the car move as Sherlock ever so carefully shut the door, it closed with a soft thunk. John hated to see Sherlock so worried and distressed, it didn't suit his usual confidence. If Sherlock was concerned, then it was always something serious. John felt a determination to recover as fast as he could, so that Sherlock would return to his usual arrogant self, the Sherlock John was comfortable with.
“And I love you“, Sherlock replied, being more than happy that he could finally say those words. He loved John, he did more than words could say and he wanted to give in to that affection now, he wanted to be as close to him as close can be.
Was he dying?! An aneurysm, an undetected brain tumour pressing?! He wanted Sherlock! His arms only grasped air, and he returned his palms to his temples in desperation to halt the mind-numbing pain.
“John, listen, I...”, Sherlock started, still out of words. This situation was overwhelming him. He should let go of John, he should let him go to his room, where he could be alone, where he could cry and think, just like Sherlock had done it when he had been younger, when he had been hurt. He had never understood why people wanted physical contact when they were sad as he had never gotten any in these moments, he himself preferred to be just left alone, but John was an ordinary human being. And as much as he used this as an insult when he talked about Anderson, it was a compliment in this case and something he actually wished he could be too.
Sherlock smirked. Why shouldn't he tease John a bit? So he continued touching him and for he knew his soldier's sensitive spots it would be way too easy to have him react to it. He got up again and looked down at John who's face seemed to say “I swear to god Sherlock, if you..” but that made it even more tempting. So Sherlock started to kiss John's neck again and ran his fingers through his hair.
“Jim Moriarty. He ambushed us”, Sherlock started to explain, told the story in their favor, “He decoyed us into a trap, set in the restroom and... John shot him in self-defence.”
They found her sprawled out on the couch, with a playboy adult channel blaring on the tv. She didn't seem into it however, and she watched it with disinterest in her eyes, hand tucked underneath her head. Their footsteps were loud against the aged wood of the stairs, so there was no doubt she had heard them coming down. She had elected to use her iconic strategy of completely ignoring them, although John didn't know what she thought she would get out of this. It was obvious Sherlock didn't care for her antics or personality, and she knew after years of using this tactic, that it had no effect on John, who was actually relieved to not be receiving an earful of her screaming and swearing, but the tv seemed to be on to make up for the loss of her voice. John turned slightly to Sherlock.
"I'm giving you everything because you went out and lived your life, instead of being stuck on one chapter of it and drinking the rest of the novel away. There's a certain point where you've drenched the book so much that the words become unrecognisable, and the pages turn to mush. Harry hit that point when she chose to stay here, but you didn't, you got out. Stay out, John, don't get sucked into this wormhole of normal life, it's dreadfully boring."
John's heart leapt up into his mouth. Sherlock had somehow read his mind, and what he saw there was the small push on the Boulder to send it flying down the hill. He knew Sherlock was entering a nervous breakdown, and he was helpless against it. Panic rushed in. His face paled. "No, no, don't do that to yourself, don't do this, please! I chose to run with you, I chose to come here, it wasn't a mistake it was me making a choice to stay with the man I love. Sherlock," He said desperately, grasping Sherlock's shaking hands as he knelt down, "I'm here, I'm not going anywhere, I know the risks, my mother knows the risks, and we accept them. Please, please, please Sherlock.... Don't do this..." John begged quietly, his eyes wide.
Sherlock looked at John and was puzzled. “How do you...“, he started, but couldn't finish to ask how he knew, for he was overwhelmed by the wave of feelings that crushed down on him. John loved him too. John loved him too! His heart cheered and he wanted to shout it from all the rooftops of the town. John loved him too.
“You were distracted by your emotions that's just human”, he said and looked around, wondering if somebody had followed them, and also he couldn't stand John's burning look, “It's not your fault that you're...”, he could stop himself there just in time before he would probably hurt John's feelings again.
He didn't understand why he suddenly stopped... it had been nice... Sherlock hat just wanted to know what exactly John had been doing, burying his face into his chest... and his hands around his waist... it had been.. surprising.
I-I won't..." John stuttered. He felt like a little boy again, being lectured by his mum. He didn't know what else to say, but luckily his answer was enough to make his mum nod with satisfaction. "So," she started, "Tell me everything."
The detective got up slowly behind him with a slight groan, and they walked downstairs, fully aware of the hospitality they were going to receive from Harriet.
It indeed was a surprise to the detective. He made those mistakes over and over again, hurt people without even knowing that he did and only knowing that he did by their reaction afterwards. But to hear those words from John... it brought the exact happiness that he had described earlier to his heart and also his face, for he couldn't stop the smile that started to form itself. It was a slight, weak, fallen smile. What was the suitable answer to those words? He didn't know. Anything he'd say would come out either stupid, provoking or saddening. Wouldn't he be holding John already he would have hugged him. Being close to him seemed to be the right solution. "Thank you for that, thank you for being with me although you know what kind of arse I can be...", Sherlock said quietly, but still with the slight smile.
John felt Sherlock's warm breath gently sweep through his hair. He loved it, and he craved more. There was something about it that made him feel at home (which was ironic considering he was in his old home). He inhaled Sherlock's smell, the faint remnants of his cologne he had applied yesterday still lingered on his suit, and pressed his nose against the blazer. He took another deep breath. How he adored it. He blinked slowly, watching as his vision narrowed with the gradual shutting of his eyelids. The world was quiet for once, and John treasured it. Beneath him, Sherlock's chest rose and fell with each intake of breath. He felt his own breathing synchronize. Why did they have to go?
John couldn't help but feel regretful for making Sherlock feel awkward, he didn't say anything but it was written on his face plain as day. The way he avoided John's eye, the gripping of his hands and the biting of his lips were all signs of an embarrassed Sherlock. It was clear that he didn't like to be embarrassed by his lack of knowledge in the whole sex area, but he needed to know why they couldn't stay in that room. John wanted to hug him and apologise, but at the same time he didn't want to apologise. One thing was certain; he wanted to hold Sherlock, not intimately, but in a completely innocent way, like how elderly couples do. They had been through a lot, and John hadn't felt the reassuring warmth that emanated from Sherlock's bare skin, it was his soother. In the house, there were only 3 bedrooms, so it wasn't rocket science to figure out which one was the spare room, aka John's old one. John opened the room and was greeted with a woosh of dusty air, something Sherlock would find comforting. "Here we are." John sighed, trying to elevate the awkwardness between them. He wondered whether the bed had any covers on it, and luckily for them it did, big thick things that could probably squash you like a slab of Tarmac. He felt Sherlock shuffle in beside him, and the silence indicated that he was either observing his surroundings, or silently expressing his distaste for the room. John turned around to face the detective, who kept his gaze to the floor. His eyebrows knitted together with regret, and he couldn't take it anymore. John wrapped his hands around Sherlock's waist, underneath his warm coat, and pulled himself towards Sherlock, burying his face into his chest. Damn his height....
John's mind still lingered on the unknown pain he had felt in his head, and how it could potentially hit again, at any time. Maybe next time he wouldn't be so lucky..,
"What has he done?" John whispered calmly, though his mind was racing with grim and gory possibilities.
John swallowed nervously as he watched his detective rush from the room, the doctor able to feel a slight ache in his heart as he was left in his bed by himself. "God... Its like waking up after a one night stand... They just rush off" he grumbled miserably, hearing the shower switch on. John shook his head and slipped out of the bedsheets, deciding he would act normal and do what he did every morning, make tea. The male pulled on his dress robe and made his way outside, doubt beginning to settle in his mind as he wondered whether Sherlock had regretted the night before. And quite frankly, John was fairly hurt at the detectives quick disappearance. John made the pair a cup of tea each before taking a hold of his own, making his way over to where his chair was positioned in the living room. John knew that this was all new to Sherlock, and that what they had done the night before would lead to there being a greater risk of Jim attacking, capturing and possibly killing John. He slowly closed his eyes as he tried not to think of it, sipping at his tea carefully before allowing his eyes to snap open when he heard Sherlock open the bathroom door "i made you tea Sherlock... Its on the kitchen counter" he called to him
“So, what now, my not-expert?”, he grinned for he was, despite his nervousness, more happy than he had ever been before.
Of course John would be fine with it. He was the one who took Sherlock's pants off in the first place. He wouldn't mind. He wouldn't push him away. They had come so far, and no matter what his mind would tell him, Sherlock was turned on by all of the things they had done just now. He was awkward, but John was fine with it. John was fine with all of it. He loved him. He loved him. He loved him. So he dared it and kind of pressed himself against his beloved while he kept kissing him.
“Well done!”, Moriarty smiled as he slowly vanished, “See how a little pressure can help? Now don't disappoint me again, I don't want to meet you among the dead.”
"I know it is!" John exclaimed tiredly, before wiping his face with his hand, trying to calm himself down, he was better than this, "I know it is..." He repeated, softer and calmer.
Sherlock said the last sentence explicitly to John and gave him a little smile. After the comment about his coat collar etc. Sherlock knew that John loved it when he was being mysterious. So he simply went into the car, the other ones following him.
"John, listen, he can't have survived...", Sherlock said carefully as he didn't want his companion to drown in illusions and wrong hopes, "I don't know what happened to the blood, not yet, but that doesn't mean that he... he wasn't killed."
Sherlock hadn't really listened to what the place he and John were about to go to would be, but he was sure John had made a good decision. He couldn't have thought of something too far away, the places in town were restaurants, most snack stalls were able to be found at the river.
“Mrs. Hudson?!”, I shouted. She must have been here somewhere. But where? “Come on, Mrs. Hudson, make a sound!”
John would've touched Sherlock, but he couldn't simultaneously keep up his rhythm and stroke. The detective spiked have to do it himself, there was no other way. A buildup of pleasure had began to grow in John's member, and signified the approach to ejacaculation. He started to pant.
“No, it's just coincidence that there were always found heaps of sands and ashes at the crime scenes! Of course there's a connection!”, Sherlock shouted, still not able to figure out what just had happened. The fear and the not-knowing made him furious. Why was there no body? John had checked on the corpses pulse, there had been none.
Sherlock simply nodded and drove on to find that motel John had mentioned. He speeded up a bit because he could sense that his strong soldier was in need of rest.
Sherlock took a deep breath. He didn't want to pick a fight. Not with John, not as they were so happy. "We have to stop him once and for all." He had used the we on purpose. They would have to do it together. Not only because John wouldn't let him do it alone, but because he would be lost without him.
John inhaled deeply and put his hand over his mouth; although he loved Sherlock, there really were times when he tested his patience. He was tempted to throttle Sherlock for that last comment, but subdued his anger and blamed it on lack of sleep. Did Sherlock not understand that a bloody dildo had nearly disappeared up his ass? From the way Sherlock spoke, it sounded like he also needed to catch up on sleep. As for what Harry said, it was hardly surprising, she had always been fond of expressing herself through vulgarities, but leave it to Sherlock to take things too far. He exhaled his breath and his eyelids fluttered open. I love him. I love him. I love him. John reminded himself over and over in his head. "Sherlock, the reason we are not staying here, in this room, is because of this." John said, flourishing his hands towards the sex toy he had sat on moments before, still vibrating.
John smirked at him and wrapped his arms around the male, pulling him in closer before pausing as he listened to him speak. John hummed softly and licked his lips "Well... I don't think having sex for the first time in a toilet is such a great idea" he continued, moving in close to lick along the shell of his ear before nipping it "But there are still things i can do to you... Mr holmes" he hissed before pressing his hand against Sherlock's bulge, giving it a gentle squeeze "Fuck... You have no idea what you do to me" he snarled before pulling back, panting heavily as he looked up into his eyes. "You are mine... Always will be mine"
The way he had stared at me horrifiedly, the pain that was written on his face, his hallucinations that seemed to terrify him and the desperate moves he had made... I could never forget anything of this scene. And then his breakdown. Not knowing if his heart was still beating or if he had a heart attack. Not knowing if he would survive or if the bloody overdose would kill him.
John forgave him... it was relief. Sherlock felt like he was in heaven. He doubted that he could find sleep now, but it surely would be for the best if they got some now. Nobody knew what awaited them tomorrow, and so they had to rest. Also the evening had been so great, he didn't want anything to ruin it.
John chuckled internally, as Sherlock no doubt was sighing in his mind palace. Nonetheless, he kept up appearances for his mum.
"Yes, thank you. We should sit down and discuss what we're going to do next..." After Sherlock had finished his sentence he walked into the kitchen. Just away from Harriet and her tv. The channel made him nervous. He got out a few cups already and heard how John started to boil the water.
Tears started to form in his eyes now, “He wants to kill you and John, I couldn't live with that, I couldn't live without you.”
"So, you're the Sherlock Holmes I see get talked about on the tv?" Harry asked in a low, seductive voice. Her lips were curled into a feline smile, and she bit her bottom lip. John scoffed quietly, earning him a quick glare from her, quick enough to miss. She went back to gazing at Sherlock with fake awe. John noticed that the detective was extremely still, like he was a statue made of stone. He didn't reply to Harry, but despite that, she still remained determined to catch him. Her eyebrows flicked up, and that smile grew larger. "You're a shy one huh? Tell me, are you this quiet in bed?" John inhaled sharply. "Are you ever quiet full stop?" Sherlock replied cooly. She flinched slightly, before edging closer over the table to him. "I can be, if you want." She whispered, licking her lips as she stared at Sherlock's. She leant over even more, and pulled his tie into her slender hands. Sherlock snatched her wrists, and Harriet let out a gasp of surprise. John stopped pretending to make the tea, and snapped around. He knew, that even though Sherlock would never return her actions, he felt jealously rise. "Get out, I need to talk to John." Sherlock growled. She ripped her hands out of his grasp, gave both him and John a glare of rage, and walked swiftly out of the room, coddling her wrists. John watched her go out, and sat down where she was previously. "What the hell was that?" John ordered.
Sherlock had followed John and watched him from the door now. If only he could do something... anything to help him. But for once his brilliant mind couldn't figure out how to solve a problem.
“We should“, Sherlock agreed and almost whispered the words into John's hair, but he didn't move either. This moment was calm, it assured a safety he barely had known and he didn't want to leave that for anything in the world. If the choice had been Sherlock's he would have stayed like this forever.
“Do you have your phone?”, Sherlock asked and simply repeated his question as John asked what he would need it for. “Call Lestrade. Tell him to come here. He'll help us.”
"You're giving me the house?" He asked, pointing to himself, like he was unsure she had gotten the right person. She nodded patiently, a dark look swept past her face. "The only thing she's getting from me is the funeral bill, as far as I'm concerned." She said huffily.
"Yeah, I mean, we've been driving for, what, an hour or so now? I might be a bit stiff and slow, but I'm pretty sure I'll be able to walk, if I leant against you for support."
That smile.... John could never get bored of it, it was like a map, and he loved it, when it showed itself.
He didn't know actually. He didn't know anything, didn't know what was to come. But he could figure that if John was on top he'd be the one to bring the action, that he'd be in charge. So he said with a slight blush: "Bottom."
He blocked that memory from his mind, now was not the time for a relapse of that sort. To his side, he clenched his fists with determination. One leg rose, and he planted it on the brown carpet below. No problems there, balance was good. He tried the other leg, and it followed in succession. Yes! John felt relief flood him and he let out a silent cheer.
"A... and you'll be fine with it?" He just wanted to make sure he was. He didn't want him to regret this, or to be stopped halfway through.
Sherlock sat there in deep thought. He was plotting. Probably Mycroft could have helped him, but he wouldn't go to him unless it was really necessary or he would have already made a plan. He surely was kept busy hanging out with the inspector anyway, and when Sherlock would call all he'd say would be that there was important government business he had to work on. Funny how neither of them could manage not to get involved.
"I know." John whispered through ragged breaths. And with that, he became engulfed in the tranquil sea of sleep.
He had been observing the room before, but it was too dark to really see anything, the lamp that was burning must have been old and it didn't work that well anymore. Still Sherlock could already sense that this room was comfortable. It had belonged to John. How couldn't it be?
John turned to face Sherlock, reaching up to cup his cheeks before pulling him down closer. The male studied Sherlock's eyes, searching for any sign of the usual cool, calm detective but he found no such thing. He let out a slow breath, Trying to stay calm himself "Alright... Alright okay, We need to get a car, I know where we can go, but is quite a ride away, is that alright?" He asked him, Studying Sherlocks eyes for a moment before gently smiling at him, Leaning in close before kissing his lips slowly, Running a hand along Sherlock's shoulder before he pulled back "It will be okay... Come on, we need to get a car." He said firmly before tugging him down the street, trying to think of the best way to go about it... They could ask Mycroft? But He was almost positive that Sherlock wouldn't want his brothers help. "Sherlock, do you still have DI Lestrades ID, im going to.. Need to steal a car" he said firmly, glancing over to Sherlock with a Serious look in his eye
John gave him a gentle smile and slowly nodded, leaning up and kissing the other males nose gently "Okay, lets get ready for bed and then I will show you the best places to lie" he nodded firmly before slowly slipping off the bed so he could get undressed, the Doctor slowly stripping off his shirt before pausing "Erm... I hope it isnt a problem, but I usually just sleep in my boxers, but if you want me to wear pjs, just say" he mumbled, cheeks turning a soft red before he slowly unzipped his jeans, allowing them to be pushed off and crumple down on the floor. John looked over to the detective who was still dressed and he chuckled softly, shaking his head "Im not cuddling you while im half naked and you are clothed, take them off, you can borrow some PJ's if you are uncomfortable... I just.. like the feeling and heat of Skin on Skin" he muttered before shifting across to the bed, slowly sitting down on it and smiling at Sherlock.
Sherlock opened the bathroom door and heard John calling to him. He had made the right choice when he had put his suit on. At first he had planned to walk into the living room just with a towel around his hips to see John's reaction to it, but he felt much more comfortable like this.
“Why not?”, Sherlock replied, but understood that this mess surely wouldn't be comfortable in any way. She let all her clothes lie on the floor, who did something like that? Then he added: “It had been a joke anyway. She had told me we should go to the 'fuck yourself room' which I told her would be hers going by the number she has been told to do so already.” Sherlock smirked. “I doubt that she will tell us any good room to sleep. So John, I think you should just pick any, as you know the house better than I do, as I can see you're very tired and could use some sleep. I don't want to have to carry you around in the end.”
Sherlock's mind was racing. He was thinking about something to say, anything to say, just anything that would make John feel better... he was useless. It didn't work. He would approach him, hold him, he had seen that in a show that John had watched on tv, but he didn't want to be rejected, didn't want to go close when John had just been in his and got up now, assumingly for some space.
I slowed down when I arrived at the top. Whoever they were, they shouldn't see my fear. It wasn't James Moriarty himself, that much I knew. But that new enemy surely worked the same way. I wouldn't hand them over the superior role just like that. I was going to act as if all was just fine, as if I hadn't been touched the slightest bit.
Then he had to turn his head. John had started a sentence, one he didn't finish, he talked about love and Sherlock didn't understand. He didn't just confess that he loved him, did he? That couldn't be. John always insisted on him being straight and also... nobody could ever fall for such an arse like Sherlock was. Nobody. It was impossible that anybody could ever love him. John had messed up his words for sure, and that was also the reason he stopped talking.
The deep moans of pleasure that emanated from Sherlock's mouth kept John at it, and whilst inside his heart was pounding hard, on the outside his lips were being soft and gentle... Two extremes in one body, mentally and physically. Sherlock's obvious state of arousal made John quiver with enjoyment, both of them were satisfied with what they were doing.
John felt heat swarth his face, he must've looked just like a cherry. He bit his lip as images of Sherlock in various states of undress filled his mind's eye. He let out a restrained giggle that sounded like a hiss through his tightened lips. Sherlock knew how to manipulate his thoughts.
John felt a stab of shock hit him, he wasn't mad! He was just... Embarrassed by his obvious need to feel close to Sherlock. "No... I... I'm not mad Sherlock." He said quietly, "I know you're new to this, I forgot, I'm sorry, I'm sorry Sherlock, I'll tell you next time." John said soothingly, not wanting Sherlock to think he was angry at something he couldn't help.
Suddenly I had realized that I wasn't alone in my bedroom anymore. And it didn't need many deduction skills to find out it was John sitting on my bed. I knew his weight, his smell, the way he breathed, everything.
“Well, thank you for your... support... and the... the last night, John”, Sherlock stuttered as he got away from him and got up, “I'm going to... get ready for the day, have a shower. … See you.”
“My laptop. Why my laptop?”, I murmered as I lifted it and turned it around, looked at it from all sides and angles, “They could have left a note but they didn't... what can a laptop be useful for? Maybe they have turned the battery into the bomb or...”
John accepted, and failed to suppress the look of sheer glee at the shock on Harry's face. He felt her wide eyes follow them as they walked up the stairs together towards John's mum's room. The door they arrived at was normal like all the other doors, except for the slight crack in its otherwise smooth surface. John lightly rapped on the wood, and a small weak voice asked them to come in. It was at this point that John stopped holding Sherlock's hand, his mum was frail, and it was better to tell her gradually that John was no longer straight, or thought that he was.
“We're taking her room. She offered it to us generously!”, Sherlock grinned as he flew up the stairs and came to stand in front of John, still moving up and down in motivation, “Which one is it?”
"But, she can't have.... I thought... wh...." John stumbled over his words, eyes looking down in thought.
Sherlock looked at John and tried to understand his behaviour, but gave up as he continued: “He knows everything about us, John. Absolutely everything. He calculates every step we make, and who knows if he doesn't know we're here? It's... he's been playing with us all along. He tricked us and you won't like how...”
All of the hairs on John's body rose simultaneously as he felt the unimaginable pleasure course through him and the eruption from his member. His release was almost paralysing in the amazing burst of gusto brought on by the discharge of his seed. A loud, strangled moan escaped his lips and he froze, gripping the sides of Sherlock's torso firmly. It was like an explosion! Endorphins raced through his brain and in that moment, John felt that he could do anything, whatever, whenever. He felt that he could bring Moriarty down beneath his feet, make everything and everyone who troubled Sherlock vanish. He had forgotten just how empowering this feeling was! His heart soared with freedom at the thought of how wonderful life was, how wonderful Sherlock was. The pleasure was throbbing still, but weaker and weaker each time, like ripples on water. John let out his held breath, panting a little from the work and overload of pleasure he was just experienced. Sherlock wasn't at the point of release yet, so John continued to hit his g-spot, as uncomfortable as it was, in order for him to receive his pleasure also. But what if.... What if John were to, per say, help him...? No, although John was being swarmed by thick pleasure, a small slither of his sensible brain was still active, the part that knew how embarrassed Sherlock could get. He probably wasn't ready for that level of intimacy yet, which is odd due to the fact that they had just fucked each other, but.... John remained hesitant, and instead stuck to what he knew Sherlock was comfortable with: the gyration of his hips.
John grinned as Sherlock handed the police ID over, nodding firmly before continuing to pull the detective out of the streets. "Its going to be a long drive" he said, eyes scanning the streets for someone who was parked but in their car. John hummed quietly and pulled out his gun from his back pocket, having spotted a fairly new car parked on the side of the road with the owner sat inside on his phone. John tightened his grip on the gun and used the end of the barrel to tap against the car "POLICE, OPEN THE DOOR" He shouted, pressing Lestrades ID up against the glass so the man could see but he kept the picture hidden with his finger. John smirked, feeling a buzz of excitement run through him as the terrified man got out of the car with his hands raised. "We need to use this car for a very serious matter, Step aside, It will be returned to you shortly" He said, Glancing over at Sherlock, motioning for him to get in and he made sure to keep his gun pointed at the male "Step away sir..." He growled before suddenly jumping into the car and slamming down the accelerator, Quickly driving away from the stunned male who still stood on the side of the road. John grinned, clearly breathing heavily as he threw his gun onto the back seat "Holy..I just stole a car!" He gasped, looking over to Sherlock
He took the shirt John had passed him and put it on. It felt strange, he usually didn't wear these kinds of shirts, but it wasn't bad. It was “comfy”, just as John had explained.
John was just looking for the word, 'boyfriend', but in fact he received an answer that was bigger than that. It kind of ruined his strategy. Nevertheless, he soldiered on with his endeavour.
John breathed nervously as he stepped into his bedroom, slowly closing the door behind him. A massive grin grew on his lips and he let out a squeak of happiness, practically bouncing across towards the bed and he fell back down onto it. The male gently touched his lips, thinking back to how soft Sherlock's skin felt against them. The male hummed and allowed his eyes to close, basking in the warm emotions washing through him before a grin grew on his lips again. He didn't care if they couldn't show their affection towards each other besides in a secret place, all he cared about was that, he had kissed Sherlock's cheek and not been pushed away!!
He lifted his hand, he precipitated John down the edge of my bed. But it wasn't just the floor he'd land on anymore, there was a never ending darkness that he'd fall into.
John smiled gently up at the inexperienced detective before he shook his head "its okay Sherlock. That doesn't matter anymore... all that matters is, I have you" he whispered, slowly tilting his head up to look at the detective properly before leaning in close, allowing his lips to press against Sherlock's. "I forgive you..." he muttered against his lips before kissing him again, slowly running a hand along Sherlock's side before carefully pulling back with a chuckle, wanting to go so much further with the detective, but out of love and consideration, he controlled himself. John sighed and shifted back, slowly laying down and relaxing his head back onto the pillow "mmm... shall we get some sleep?" He asked him curiously before meeting eyes with him, a loving smile on his lips.
John blinked when Sherlock told him the plan, a smirk growing on his lips and he suddenly leaned forwards, grabbing a hold of Sherlock and pulling him into a deep kiss "Mine..." He muttered against his lips before cupping his face, continuing to kiss the detective for a few moments "Mine" he muttered once more before slowly pulling back "this sounds like a great plan" he muttered
His hands slid onto Sherlock's waist and swept over his back to rest on his neck before he pushed Sherlock's face down to his. He began to give him small kisses all over his cheeks, his mouth, forehead, everywhere. They were like his mark, to show that he loved Sherlock, and nobody else could have him. His lips finished their journey by pressing onto Sherlock's.
What was once a fire of pleasure, was now a small flickering flame, a wisp or ember of what it once was for Sherlock, but.... That experience... It was out of this world! He saw the white spray across John's chest and felt a pang of guilt, the first sign that his logical mind was returning to claim its primitive home. He felt the hot breath of John on his stomach, and the change in air waves as he spoke.
Sherlock didn't know what to do in situations like this... about a loved person that was ill... “Lay down...“, he figured and pulled the blanket back so that John could get into the bed in a better way, “Is there anything I can do? Anything you need?“
"I thought I didn't have a chance... that I couldn't survive... but then I remembered that Magnussen was still out there and you were in danger. And I just couldn't let him hurt you. So I continued to fight. I was dead... but I fought myself back. For you."
If he could he would just have rushed to John and kissed him, pushed him against the wall maybe or had even, once they were in their room, thrown him on the bed. It was very difficult to resist. And that voice! Sherlock could feel how his emotions started to race. He wanted to be close to John right now. "I do", he admitted, then watched John slowly get out of the elevator. Slow, so slow. This kind of teasing was so much worse than what Sherlock had done before.
John gave Sherlock a gentle and loving smile as he cupped his cheek, the doctor shifting into the touch of Sherlock's gloved hand "I'm glad... Looking forward to the hotel" he muttered before turning his head to gently kiss the palm of Sherlock's hand. "We can stop Moriarty together ... I promise Sherlock... I promise" he muttered quietly before studying his detective carefully for a few moments, a light smile on his lips. "It makes me happy to call you my boyfriend... I just wish I could kiss you right now" he chuckled softly before gently squeezing Sherlock's hand.
“Of course he's dead, he blew his own brain out, no one survives that. I just went to the trouble of an overdose to prove that.”
The hotel looked significantly older than when John had first entered it, which was with one of his previous lovers, a relationship that was as long as a butterfly's life span, but it was a good memory nonetheless. It would make things slightly awkward for John.
John pressed Sherlock back onto the bed, along with himself still in the detective's embrace. He was scared to go back to sleep, in case his nightmare came back to haunt him. From the corner of his eye he looked at the time on the digital clock. 4.... in the afternoon. God their body clocks were going to be out of whack, John was sure they would end up nocturnal. Sherlock's arm acted as a pillow, but John didn't apply all of his weight to it, in case it hurt him, so his head remained lifted slightly, which was very uncomfortable on his neck.
“Not worth it”, he whispered to John, then he got up in a controlled manner and held out his hand to help his beloved to get up, too. After that he walked right up to Harriet and grinned at her: “Too bad you'll never know how naughty I can really be.”
Then, the pain stopped its onslaught against him. John's tense and coiled body relaxed. Relief. Beside the sides of his head, he felt his hands shaking, along with his entire body. What the fuck was that?! He was so scared.. He... It was terrifying. His panting eased up slightly and shuddered. Tears fell down his face and he curled up tighter. It was gone. Whatever it was in the first place.
Sherlock stayed silent now. He didn't want John to get angry, because that would raise his blood pressure and pulse which wouldn't be good in this state. So he simply drove on, he didn't know where. It was a difficult question. Where? He decided for a motel. It was a neutral place, maybe they would be left alone there, and be it only for the night.
John was enjoying the taste of Sherlock on his lips, if this was all his boyfriend wanted then he would be fine, it didn't always need to get full-blown. He would settle for kissing, and holding off the more passionate stuff for later on if needs be.
Sherlock looked at John in desperate worry as his voice revealed how broken he really was. He wanted to help him. But what could he do?
John watched Sherlock as he swiftly put his suit jacket over his arms in one graceful move. He noted how his body twisted, the tug of the shirt on his torso. He felt a sense of pride come over himself at the sight of his boyfriend (if he could be called that) and the comforting thought that he was his, and only his. They really seemed to be an odd couple, but John didn't care. Harry slammed on the door again. "Come on! Hurry the hell up!" She shouted. Someone had a bad hangover then.
"No... No you're, you're nothing like her, Sherlock." John said, hoping Sherlock would buy it. "She was bored with her job, and didn't give us the best customer service... Some things can't be helped, I guess."
Sherlock considered himself married to his work. And it was true. He loved our investigations, he didn't even try to hide his excitement (which I admired so much) at all. So if there was something that could drag his attention away it was a case.
John frowned, squeezing his eyes shut and groaning. "But I need a shower...." He tried to pull himself off of the bed slightly, but it seemed to pull him even harder back, like it had its own gravitational force, keeping John firmly on the mattress. The duvet was still beneath him, so even if he wanted to get under it, he couldn't. His boy literally felt like stone.
John hastily shot back a step, his affection was not being returned by Sherlock. Why? His cheeks burned, and he looked away. Was this payback for the whole dildo incident? He scratched his neck, something he did when he was uncomfortable, eyes searching for somewhere to look.
“Am I not? Let's make this more interesting, shall we? You solve the case, I let him go. Doesn't that sound fair?”
“Is that not what you're supposed to do? I thought everything was said and done, we had been together all night so it was time to continue the morning routine.”
John let out a weak chuckle and shook his head "Nope! Didnt hit on her" he chuckled sadly, looking down at his feet as he walked along, following him with a small breath. He ran his fingers through his hair slowly and glanced around the room, swallowing nervously as he shifted so that he was walking besides him "So, where are we going?" He asked curiously, wondering where Sherlock was leading them. John glanced down at the sausage roll and sighed, no longer feeling hungry but he figured that he had best to eat it rather than waste it. John slowly bit into it and sighed, it was warm, tasted nice, but it didnt remove the slight ache in his heart "Im sorry if I have done anything to upset you or something..." he slowly shrugged, glancing up at the sociopath "But you still havent said, where are we going?" He smiled
“Can we please go somewhere safe?”, Sherlock asked, barely with any tone in his voice, “I... need you to hold me now.”
John hummed as they stepped into the morgue, the Doctor leaning against the wall as he watched Sherlock become excited over the body he was to view. He knew that molly had a massive crush on him, and in all honesty, he found himself getting jealous. The small touches she gave him, the flirtatious smiles and laughs. There were times where he thought that he was going to snap at her for doing it, but he knew that Sherlock would never accept his feelings for him. And here John was, Watching Sherlock deduce a body.
“So, do you know a nice place where we could grab something we can eat on the way?”, Sherlock asked his friend as he realized he had no idea where they could get something. He had never needed a snack stall, food had not been important, and if he had needed some he would just have found something somewhere. But John surely was an expert when it came to this.
"I know." John said, a hint of protectiveness in his voice. He didn't need protecting all of the time, he was in a bloody war, and in war nobody was treated like they were weak and defenceless. But, John couldn't help a small, tiny part of him enjoying Sherlock defending him. Unfortunately, the majority of his mind had no time for it, but if it pleased Sherlock then he wouldn't mind being the princess rescued by the prince. For the time being, anyway. "But that was meant for both of us, you know?" John added, arching an eyebrow.
"Not what I want to hear right now Sherlock." John said lowly, pressing his head further against Sherlock's shirt.
“If you're thinking this is about your sister you must mistaken this for a family vacation which it's definitely not. The danger is real, John”, as he was saying the last sentence Sherlock's voice started to shake, which he tried to stop as he continued, “We're on the run, not up to mind family business or shopping tours...”
John frowned deeply as he watched the detective Shift and move in his sleep, the doctor tilting his head to the side in slight confusion. "Sherlock...?" He asked slowly, carefully removing his hand from underneath Sherlock's shirt. John reached up and placed his hand on the sleeping detectives cheek "Oi, Sherlock, you are having a nightmare" he frowned deeply, taking a hold of the males shoulders and lightly shaking them to wake up the detective before the nightmare got too Serious "Sherlock!" He snapped at him, deciding his Gentle approach wasn't working so he decided that being a little louder would allow him to remove Sherlock quickly from his nightmare.
"She's cold, uninterested in others but herself. She doesn't even try to hide her disapproval of the others, and I hate her. How is it any other from what I do?", Sherlock said, looking to the floor, wondering why he suddenly cared about this. It was like a weakness that he had long pushed away was returning to the surface.
“There's nothing here!”, Sherlock shouted and overthrew a table, “That can't be it! He must have left clues, something to go by! He wants me to find him so why can't I find anything?!”
Yes, yes it was gone. But still Sherlock felt dirty in a way. Not that he minded dirt, he had gone threw way worse sceneries when he had been an addict but... well, this was different. It was human dirt. Still he couldn't help but smile. The way John tried to make him feel better, make him feel safe and comfortable was adorable.
Sherlock's member began to become stiff, and pressed against John's stomach as he rolled his hips. At the start, John found it hard to get a rhythm started, as they didn't have any lube, but as his manhood was getting stimulated, it created its own. Sherlock's moan was like audial viagra. He had achieved his goal, and had made Sherlock moan with considerable volume. He increased his tempo, Sherlock's member began to slap him die to his speed. Something would had to be done about Sherlock's problem, or else it wouldn't be fair. He had to have release.
John waited for Sherlock to leave, though the detective remained standing in the room. He raised his eyebrows expectantly.
Sherlock looked at John with big eyes when he talked about punishment. He knew what it meant, he had done his research. And although he didn't know what exactly John had in mind, he knew that John would never do anything that would endanger him. So a grin formed on his face as he started to look forward to it.
John was beginning to lose the feeling of being in the moment, it had passed for him, but that didn't mean he would stop, Sherlock still seemed to be in the moment. He continued to kiss Sherlock, and he ran his fingertips down Sherlock's arms
"Ye...yes, of course", Sherlock said and shook his head. Why was he being like this? He'd just go for it. So he moved his hands down John's body until he arrived at the elastic waist of the pants. He slid his thumbs into them and looked at John's face now, looking for a final sign before he'd do it.
He bit his lip when the talk went to John's uniform. It was an image he deeply admired and... and John was aware of it! If he wouldn't use that against him he would be... kinda disappointed. And he did use it! Sherlock was speechless for a few seconds after the words his soldier had spoken.
John smiled slightly as he watched the male before his eyes widened as the detective broke down in his arms. He felt an ache in his chest and he pulled him in close, wrapping his arms around him tightly before nodding "Yes Yes, That's fine... We can head back to the flat, it will be much better" he muttered, slowly taking a hold of Sherlock's hand before making his way slowly towards the main road to where a taxi would pick them up "Everything will be okay Sherlock... I promise" he whispered into his ear, gently kissing his cheek before trying to flag down a taxi, keeping his lover in as close as he could, wanting to comfort him.
He shook the feeling off of his shoulders as Sherlock pulled into a parking space, almost effortlessly. It was pretty good, for someone John had thought to have never touched a steering wheel in his life. The car spluttered to a stop, the gentle humming of the engine silenced, and left John missing the vibrations of the seat he had grown accustomed to during their journey.
“To St. Bartholomew's Hospital“, Sherlock told the driver and gave him the address. He could barely sit still and looked outside the windows. Finally he had something to do. Finally something to keep him distracted from... whatever. His fingers thrummed on his legs as he tried to sit still.
"Sherlock, it's fine! It's fine you daftie!" He giggled, leaning down to kiss Sherlock's forehead before wiping himself clean.
So it did work! John increased his rhythm and began to move down slightly (John couldn't reach both Sherlock's groin and mouth, he wasn't that tall). He felt his hips come into contact with Sherlock's raised pelvic bones and gradually, he entered the detective, opening his mouth with pleasure. God, it was tight! He began to thrust with a moderate rhythm.
John gave Sherlock an uneasy look before nodding his head. The kettle behind Sherlock screamed, and John silenced it by screeching out of his seat and pouring out the boiling liquid into the two cups he had placed next to the oven. The teabags that he had found weren't the best, they were Tesco's own brand, but it wasn't really the tea he needed. What he needed, was to feel normal again, and the best way to do that, was to do the most British thing he could do; drink tea. He threw the used teabags into the sink, and told himself he'd deal with it later. As he made his way back to his seat, he put down Sherlock's cup with a small thunk. He settled down into the seat, although his position was tense and rigid, and placed his hands, weaves together, in front of him.
John paused when he watched the other male carefully, a slight frown on his face as he could see the desperation on his face "Sherlock, Relax" he said firmly, reaching up and cupping his face carefully. "You wont disappoint me for not wanting to do something okay? We will go at your pace" he smiled gently at him, leaning forwards and kissing his forehead gently. "You dont need to worry okay.." he mumbled against his forehead before pulling back, studying Sherlocks eyes gently. "Relationships are suppose to be relaxing, you dont have to worry hun" he said before Slowly pulling his arms away from the male "If you arent comfortable sleeping in here, you dont have to, i wont be disappointed" he said truthfully.
Sherlock knew that it was a lot. He didn't have just had an emotional breakdown for nothing. Where should he even start?
Still it felt weird to be in this position and a grin started to form on his lips. It was ridiculous! Why was it always them to be in these kinds of situations? Sherlock couldn't keep himself from giggling.
Sit and discuss what we should do next... Those words sparked dread in John, but something else to, excitement, maybe? The thrill of going back into battle, it seemed to be a terrible thing to get your blood pumping with, but John couldn't help it. He set the kettle on the stove and turned on the gas before moving to lean against the sink side. He watched as Sherlock took the seat facing him on the opposite side of the table.
John shuffled to the drinks tray, his feet scuffling against the carpet as he went. He felt so emotionally drained. Or just drained in general. The cold water hit his chest as he drank, but it felt good. Like a wake up call: get over it and soldier on. Harriet hated him, at least he knew he didn't have to try anymore at family meetings, then again, he would have to be on watch for any more drugs or poisons. A messed up family and a messed up life to match. At least he had Sherlock with him.
His cheeks seemed hollower than usual, the shadow beneath them had grown in size and deepened in shade. And his already spindly fingers had become more dipped where the bone curved in...John hoped he was eating properly. He pushed back the gravid thought to the back of his mind. It was nonsense... Sherlock was eating just fine, he must be. John hoped his concern didn't show on his face, and gave a small smile to Sherlock, who replied back with his own smile.
John glanced up, finally breaking out of his train of thought and he smiled gently at the detective, firmly nodding before pressing his phone to his ear, waiting for Lestrade to pick up the phone before beginning to speak to him. As he spoke to the inspector, the doctor began to do his rounds about the body, carefully studying the wounds and the state of decomposition, knowing that to figure out the identity of the person, they would need the help of dental records. The male listened to greg ramble on about a possible woman but the results were said to be 78% likely that it was said woman so they would need to check dental records. John nodded firmly "Alright, I will tell him" he muttered before ending the call, proceeding to shove his phone into his pocket "So, Body is almost oo decomposed to accurately test for an identity. There has been a 78% match to a woman named Selena Goves, However they will need to check dental records to find a definite identity and that will be atleast a day" he informed the sociopath "Sorry Sherlock" he said before gently patting his arm, able to feel the glares he was receiving from Molly
John smiled lazily, and hoped Sherlock didn't see the hint of sadness laced through his face. He didn't want to get up and walk back into the fear and edginess of being hunted. This moment, right there, was what he wanted to have with Sherlock every single morning, but in their own room, their own apartment or house, where no one could force them to run and hide like rabbits from dogs. He knew he had willingly entered this life when he has started to love Sherlock, but it didn't hurt to dream. John felt the embrace of tiredness begin to loosen. He focused on the alarm clock behind Sherlock, and tried to make his eyes read the time. 8 am... They could sneak in a few more minutes. Slowly, John brought up his hand so that Sherlock could see what he was doing, and rested it gingerly on the detective's pale, smooth arm. He looked up to see whether Sherlock was reacting negatively or not, thankfully he wasn't. "Hey, wake up sleepy head." John chuckled quietly, his voice barely above a whisper.
Once he had closed the door Sherlock took a deep breath. Wow. Just - wow. This had been amazing! And it still was! It felt like something that had blocked areas of his brain was now gone and it felt fresh and new and... relieved. What had he been waiting for for so long? But Sherlock knew the answer. It was John. He had waited for John. For the love and trust that only he was capable of. He wouldn't have wanted to go through this experience with anybody else. Sherlock stepped into the shower. It somehow was a shame to wash away the proof of their love. But well, it needed to be done. This wasn't nice. He wouldn't be able to enjoy the rest of the night if he didn't shower now. So he turned on the water and let it run over his body that still reacted sensitively. 'Thank you, John', Sherlock could only think, 'I love you.'
That was the clearest thought he could make. Actions were necessary now. So he got up, but walking was still hard to manage.
I jumped out of the bed immediately. Probably he had wanted to use the bathroom in the night and had broken down on his way! If he would lie somewhere unconsciously or... worse... I would never forgive myself for not being able to protect him.
John felt his mouth run dry. "So... So it was a hallucination? I didn't kill Moriarty?" He asked breathlessly.
Sherlock was bending down again now, and gently put John in the passenger seat. John could see the concentration and worry in his face as he manoeuvred his arms so that John wouldn't get hurt. He noticed that he avoided touching his head, which was understandable. It made John love him even more for being protective, it was adorable how much he cared for him. Sherlock slipped his hands out from underneath John, and stepped back to see whether he was in a comfortable position, his eyes darting over John. John smiled gratefully and leaned over to buckle his seatbelt.
John growled when he watched Donovan, clenching his fists before scoffing "I didn't hallucinate..." He breathed, flexing his fingers before glancing across to Sherlock, studying the detective before clicking his tongue in irritation at Anderson's comment "Anderson.. If someone had burnt the body, the smell would be horrific in here. Trust me, i know what a burning corpse smells of" he glared over at him before flexing his fingers, Listening to him mention a previous case. The doctor shrugged his shoulders and slowly walked around the room, glancing up at the ceiling as he tried to see if there had been any way of Moriarty escaping even if he had managed to survive. "I shot him dead.... Even if he had managed to survive, where is the trail of blood?!" He frowned deeply before sighing, turning to look at Sherlock with slightly worried and frustrated eyes. "Why cant he just... Disappear? Stay away from us..?" He groaned in irritation
“You know what? Stay here“, Sherlock said and got up again, returned to the bathroom. If getting up was that difficult for John he wouldn't have to. He took a flannel, held it under the water and took just a little bit of soap before he returned and started to wash John whose eyes were closed already.
They weren't, exactly polar opposites, she, however, hid behind a false mask, whereas Sherlock tended to... Wear his opinions on his sleeve. That was a part of being Sherlock, some people loved him for it, like John, and others, well, others didn't.
“You would have what? Come along? You have to face reality. You're going to be a father soon. You're going to have a real family. I was polite enough not to stand in your way with that so would you please simply accept the fact that I might have fought my way out of there and would have returned and wake up to reality again? There's a threat we've got to deal with, so get prepared. We can't afford the luxury of living in the past.”
"I... I'm sorry?", Sherlock tried to apologize. He had just wanted to help. But no matter what he had said wrongly, he didn't let John go just one bit. He held him just as close as before. He would always be there for him and protect him.
"I know, I know I'm not blaming you Sherlock, I just want to find out why I suddenly collapsed. It's frightening being in the unknown."
I fought the darkness that wanted to swallow me, that I wanted to give in to and sleep. I stayed with John.
"We should go downstairs." John said calmly, although he made not attempt to remove himself from Sherlock's side.
Sherlock could feel John's touch and he never wanted him to stop. Him being possessive like this, but protective still, demanding and gentle at the same time. When John ran his hands down on Sherlock sides he could feel himself tremble all over. He blushed and he couldn't remember that he had ever done that before.
“Why would that cause us to leave?”, he asked and as he didn't want to sound like a child he added, “I bet there are a lot of things you could do with it.”
“John, this is the last thing you have to worry about now”, Sherlock replied in a calm voice and reached out for John's hand, thinking that could calm him, “I just wanted to tease her a little, that's all. You are very well aware of the fact that you are my only interest.”
The sudden hissing of the shower told John that Sherlock was in, washing himself clean by his standards. It was understandable, it was his first time after all, John would've been surprised if he hadn't been overwhelmed.
Sherlock was really frightened by the way John was reacting. It hurt him too to see him like that. "Yes John. I will always be there. No matter what we go through. I won't let you down. I will defeat death for you." He then thought it could be right to tell him something else. "Actually... I already have."
So I did as he had said, but it didn't show my usual background, but a collage of John and me as.. as animals. John was a dog, sitting on his armchair just as he did now and me as a raven, staring cluelessly at the screen. It was like a mirror, our heads put together with the animals' bodies like a collage, and all entitled in capital letters with: IT'S GREAT TO HAVE A TRACKING DOG WHEN YOU'RE SO VAIN AND COMPLICATED IT MAKES YOU DULL, AIN'T I RIGHT, SHERLOCK?
Sherlock was lost in John's kiss, he had already closed his eyes, this time to erase anything else but the pleasure. When John's hand met 'him' he breathed in sharply. Out of surprise, yes, but it was also something else. He loved it. He wanted more.
As they arrived Sherlock hadn't know where John had brought them, but as he saw the woman it was pretty clear. Her blonde hair and her whole face had such a resemblance to his doctor that there was no doubt that this was his sister Harriet. It was quite interesting to finally meet her, as she didn't randomly show up at 221B.
So he pushed John backwards without thinking about it and pressed him against the opposite wall. He fixated him with his body and squeezed his lover's upper leg with one hand, while placing the other one with the backside on his cheek. “As you are mine”, he growled looking down on John and started to kiss him passionately.
Why did Sherlock always have to be cryptic? It only increased John's agitation. "How has he tricked us?"
And it was true. John had spoken so well, he had made Sherlock feel... loved and those words... they triggered emotions that he hadn't known he was capable of. Sweet melancholia mixed with happiness.
The damp warmth of the flannel gave John a small jump as he was pulled back from the edge of sleep by its touch, and he cranked one eye slightly open, so that he could see what was going on. Sherlock... John smiled drowsily at him before resting his head back down on to the soft bed, shutting his heavy eyes. The world gradually became muffled, he felt distant from everything, like he was an observer looking in. "Thank you..." He slurred, voice rough from fatigue.
John could see Sherlock was thinking about something, hesitating about something maybe? Was it his hand on his arm? What was it? He wanted to ask him, but he was afraid of something like what happened yesterday occurring again. So, he pretended not to see. "Ok... I'm going to get up now." John replied. He rolled over with a small grunt before getting out of the bed in one fluid move. Because they hadn't brought any other clothes, he had gone to sleep in his shirt and trousers, which resulted in him looking rather bedraggled, but there was nothing he could do about that.
An ache crossed Sherlock's heart, and it was this ache that let him awake to the fact that he had already got involved. He clearly had feelings for John, probably for quite some time now, and he had always tried to fight it. He would continue that fight. He could never give John what he needed. What he deserved. Sherlock didn't know a thing about love, all he knew was that it was painful, because it always ended in loss. Everything inbetween didn't exist. So he would ensure John happiness. He could find the somebody that was just right for him.
I dropped the latop at once and ran down the stairs. By the sound of his feet on the wood I knew John was following me.
“I simply don't like people treating you badly, that's all”, Sherlock replied, still staring down at his sleeves. Of course he could have ignored her like he usually did with basically everyone, but this was different, it was personal, it offended John. And he couldn't just let that through. Mess with him? Call him a freak? It hurt, like it would hurt everybody, but it was acceptable. Hurting John on the other hand was inexcusable.
“I don't know what is wrong”, he continued, trying to calm him down, trying to find suiting words, but he had never been good at that, “But please, please don't be like that.”
He looked outside the window, away from John. He just couldn't let this happen again. He couldn't love to lose. And with Moriarty still being around it was only a matter of time until he'd come after John. Sherlock's past was a heavy burden to bear already, and he couldn't have John die, too. He himself would die before he let that happen. It was a small line and Sherlock was at the edge of it. If he didn't shut it out now... he could probably get involved.
Sherlock shivered as he felt John's cold hands on his skin, both because of the touch and their temperature. But he didn't mind them being cold. Feeling a touch, feeling John's touched let his body cheer with joy and he trembled slightly. He was way too sensitive, probably because he had waited for so long.
Sherlock's eyes moved fast trying to catch every movement John made, as he knelt in front of him and held his hands. They were nice and warm unlike his own who must have been cold as ice. He somehow wanted to pull them away so that John wouldn't have to be affected by his coldness, but he was too caught up in enjoying the warmth John gave to him.
He took in deep breaths as his chest grew heavy. "My, my sister tried to kill me.... She tried to kill me!" He said, voice breaking slightly.
“It would be for the best if we didn't”, he said and saw the sadness reappear to John's eyes, so he added: “But if we found a secret place in which it would be impossible for him to attend then I don't see a reason why we shouldn't.”
John let out a loud squeak of shock as Sherlock suddenly pushed him up against the wall of the cubicle. The male whined loudly as he felt Sherlock's hands on his body before he quickly nodded "Yes, yes im all yours" he moaned before kissing back deeply, wrapping his arms around Sherlock's neck, allowing the detective total access to his bodt "Fuck... Just wait until tomorrow" he muttered, pulling him in a little closer so that he could grind against Sherlock's hardening bulge with his own, the doctors cheeks turning an even deeper shade of red
"What's your fault, the headache? The fact that my sister is a bitch? The fact that I love you no matter what? One little migraine isn't going to send me running for the hills, the same as Moriarty isn't."
Sherlock loved John's clothing style, it had a touch of home, it seemed to say 'Yes, you belong here', but right now it was inconvenient. The big pullover and the shirt below, they were much more difficult to get off of him than just some buttons that you could open.
“You're alright...”, he said to John, but more to himself to convince his heart. It was just a dream. Nothing to be scared about. He leaned against John's chest trying to calm down. His breath slowed down with the seconds passing by. John was talking to him, kind and loving words.
John travelled his lips down to Sherlock's, and felt the hot breath pour onto his neck as he moved from Sherlock's agape mouth. It gave John encouragement, was he responding to his hips? As a test, John made his hip rolls stronger against Sherlock's.
He had started but couldn't finish. He saw John's tears and didn't know at all what to say, all he could do was stare. This was... his fault. He had done this to John. Sherlock wanted it to stop. He didn't want John to be like this. But how on earth could he make this right?
"Mm? Oh, yeah, sure." He mumbled before returning his attention to Sherlock, this time focusing on the sharp slopes of his face.
But that would never happen. John was with Mary now. And even if he wasn't... he'd never decide for me. He was straight. He had insisted on that so often. And I didn't even know about myself, I only knew that I didn't want to share him with anybody else. I wanted him to be only there for me. If he met other people... he'd probably decide for them and leave me. And the impulses... no.
I had none of that. I had to keep myself together now, think about the case. I was married to my work. Sentiment was a chemical defect found in the losing side. I would use the good feelings John gave me to motivate myself, I would keep him save, but not more than that. He was useful for me. He told me how to act when it came to social situations I didn't know until then. That was useful. He taught me how I could get to people easier.
He kept looking at him and wondered if he should start with his explanation as he didn't get an answer to that.
“What a sweet scene”, Jim Moriarty grinned as he stepped into the light, John and Sherlock jumped away from each other in fright, “Wouldn't it be nice to spice it up a bit?”
He was sitting in front of a table and used his laptop. He wore his dressing gown and didn't even look up when he heard me enter.
John was confused, and hesitant. Did he mean what he thought he meant? John gave it the benefit of the doubt, and took his words as an invite to take the lead instead of taking his boxers off. He lazily rolled Sherlock onto his back and continued to kiss him, this time in a line going across his throat, marking out the small indent of skin.
Moriarty?? I looked at John who seemed to be as confused as I was. It was his voice. It definitely was. But how? The laptop, of course...
"Yeah, yeah I'm fine." John grumbled, frowning slightly. His mouth still tasted acidic, which wasn't the best flavour. He found it weird that Sherlock couldn't hear him but as soon as he walked into the room he could deduce that he had been sick. John didn't know why he even tried to hide it, sometimes he forgot he loved a genius. It did come as a relief however when Sherlock so clearly became worried.
The pain, the noise, everything, he begged it to go away. God, please! He curled up on the floor and buried his head to his knees. Just make it stop! Kill him, make him unconscious, just anything! His teeth sang. The pain was somehow increasing, John was bordering on blacking out.
John heard the crash of the tray hitting the kitchen counter, the male rolling his eyes as he stepped through the kitchen, now fully dressed. The male ran his fingers through his hair slowly, causing it to become slightly messy, a stray piece sticking up like a sore thumb. John made his way towards the front door, grabbing his own coat off the rack before glancing up at Sherlock, thinking that he couldnt see him. The males cheeks turned red once more and his mouth opened ever so slightly as he took in what he saw before putting a mask on, turning away from Sherlock as he spoke "God look at you.. with your.. turned up collar and... cheekbones" he scoffed, quickly pushing past him, unable to make eye contact with the detective before he reached for the door, turning the handle yet not opening it. The male looked up at Sherlock, allowing them to meet eyes once. John breathed in sharply, studying the man In front of him quickly before giving him a sheepish smile "Lets get going?" He suggested, clearly quite nervous at their close proximity.
"John, you are and have always been my priority. If this is too much for you.. damn, it's all my fault."
John rubbed at his tired eyes, trying to wake himself up as he shuffled from his bedroom and towards the kitchen. A massive yawn slipped through his lips and he glanced over to Sherlock who was scanning through his laptop. John sighed and shook his head "Tea?" He called, voice laced with tiredness. "Have you been up all night on that bloody laptop?" He muttered, almost spilling hot water on his hand as he poured the pair two cups of tea, a long string of swear words escaping him before he chuckled to himself. John made his way with both cups of tea, placing Sherlock down next to him on the coaster before glancing at the laptop screen, a small smile curling onto his lips "New case?"
John felt a tidal wave of emotion crash down on him, everything he was keeping inside had burst their container, and before he knew it, the shudders of an approaching sob started to take ahold of his body. He felt tears spring up and run down his cheeks in steady streams. He couldn't stop them, part of him didn't want to. They were better out than in. The warm presence of Sherlock acted as a shelter for John, and he wrapped his arms around the detective as if he were holding on for dear life. Like an upset child, he buried his face away from the world into Sherlock's suit where it was black and peaceful. He still heard his muffled sobs in his ears, but at least he didn't have to feel ashamed at crying in the open, where Sherlock could see his face.
“You killed an innocent man, John”, Sherlock finally said and felt guilty immediately that he had told him in such a direct way.
“That?”, Sherlock replied, “Nothing at all. Just trying to figure out what she was up to. You said she was interested in women once, so no need to be jealous, John.”
For the first second Sherlock was surprised that John had come to him, and when he kissed him he felt excited beyond words, especially because of the way he did it. Demanding, irresistible. Then he remembered and pushed John away.
“Do you really think there would be anybody who I would rather spend time with than with you?”, he asked, looking down on his broken John, who wanted to answer but Sherlock didn't let him, “Do you think so? Because I can tell you it's not true. And you know that. You're being hurt, that's all. That's why you're mad at me. But listen, John, I had no other choice. I had to do this, Moriarty's out there somewhere and he will definitely come after you if he sees that I care about you. I can't risk that.”
"I told you... John, I told you that I wanted to keep you out of this... you will only get hurt if you're with me."
Sherlock blinked a few times. Second floor. Would John be able to take the stairs? That was yet to be figured out. He would try to carry him if necessary, but Sherlock was getting weak by now as well, It's been a rough day. He even overheard the question that he was being asked.
“Why do you always assume I'm up to something?”, Sherlock asked with a kind of disbelief in his voice, but it still was clear he was playing, “We'll be going for a nice walk, not more or less.”
"I didn't say that. There were a bunch of people around who know about these things. They're not as good as me, but they're not bad, and they could have told you."
"I only want to protect you...", Sherlock formed these words slowly and clearly, but his voice was trembling. He hadn't meant to insult John.
It was like a mutual agreement, that they would only start discussion after they had readied themselves with a cup of tea. Both of them knew it was coming, but just for a few more minutes they could be the new couple starting to learn about one another in quiet harmony.
“Yes, and I know exactly why”, John said, moving a bit closer to me, “Because you had to keep your thoughts away from me.”
"That I wouldn't think you were smart enough to make a proper plan, that you would just run into the action without thinking about it"
“Thank you...”, Sherlock said and looked at John, unsure of what to do next. Maybe they really should just sleep and look at things from a different angle tomorrow. But wasn't he supposed to either put an arm around John or lay on his chest? Why were these things so difficult?
I was no longer in my bedroom, I was at the scene I had been in years ago. But the roles were switched. John had jumped, I had watched. He was laying on the floor, dead, bleeding, and I was fighting my way through the people surrounding him. “John!”, I screamed. This couldn't be true.
But I didn't want to talk to him about it, at least not now. I had just seen how he had reacted to his own brother and I didn't want to be in the same position. It was a tensed topic. So I decided to do us both a favour and talk about Moriarty. Not that Sherlock wasn't my priority, he was, (and if I could I would have taken him in my arms to tell him all would be fine, while I would nurse him back to health), but I had to talk about something else now. For Sherlock's best and my own as well.
"Mm.. I-I don't know I..." John mumbled, eyes focuses on where Sherlock's hand grasped his wrist. Hadn't he just asked what he was doing? That question seemed like he wasn't reciprocating the feeling John had, so why was he suddenly pulling him back? John felt like a child again for the second time that night. His infantile side was telling him to leave the room, to find a safe place in the house alone, away from embarrassment. Sherlock was in the way however, so he stayed in Sherlock's grasp.
John remembered to bring up the whole "ma'am" thing to Sherlock when they were alone. One cannot simply allow their significant other to call their mother "ma'am" without laughing about it in private.
Sherlock's warmth surrounded him and it felt like the only place where John belonged in the world. He felt a wave of comfort wash over him as long, slender fingers ran through his hair. He loved the feeling of Sherlock's soft skin on his. It felt... right. He couldn't keep his eyes open any more, even if he tried.
Sherlock grabbed John's arm to stop him from walking away before he could he even realize what he was doing. His brain had stopped to be in charge, no more calculating. His heart was breaking through. He had tried to fight it, but he just couldn't anymore.
“That you can't tell your henchmen to kill me or my companions anymore? Yes, tears me apart in fear”, Sherlock replied and sat down on the chair in front of the laptop. I walked towards him and stood behind him then, my hand always on the gun in my bag.
Sherlock breathed in sharply as he heard John's voice next to his ear. Honestly... he wouldn't even mind to vanish to the bathroom for some time.
When he had closed the door behind him he leaned against it for a little bit and took a deep breath. It was just all too much, he had to think about everything now. Have some quiet time for himself.
“Please make sure that they record everything correctly and take a bit of that ash with you so I can look at it more precisely.”
John's thoughts probably were fixed on the case of the house, how his mother could give it to him and how he had never visited her in all these years, touched by the loving and praising words that she uttered. Sherlock on the other hand had found another aspect to be quite interesting: The behaviour of John's mother. She loved the adventure as well as her son did, and her using the word 'boring' let Sherlock at least lift an eyebrow.
“Sh..rlock, wh..s g..ng ..n?“, I heard John's voice. He moved, he looked at me, his face was pale. He seemed far, far away.
Jim lifted his hands and put on an innocent face “Oh, oh you think this is a threat? I just wanted to pay a visit to my favourite restaurant as I recognized you two. How could I have known that I'd interrupt your sweet tête-à-tête?”
This time Sherlock did let out a slight moaning sound, John had moved stronger. Oh god yes. Please, John.
“Morning”, Sherlock returned absentmindedly, still distracted by all the wonderful features of John.
"Oh so what?! Do you think I care? After all, he inherits fucking everything in THIS GODDAMN FAMILY ANYWAY!" She screamed, spitting in his face.
“Correct, correct, and correct, but... wrong! Oh Sherlock, people need to know who I am. I am greater than our little Jim could ever have been! And you are going to help me with that, aren't you?”
It took John 10 minutes to explain everything, all the while she sat quietly, nodding every once in a while. She seemed to understand, unlike Harry, and even brightened up from the invasion of her home by John and Sherlock. When John finished, she straightened up. "Well that's a tale and a half. So you two are together?" John nodded, cheeks reddening. "I didn't know you were gay, but I've already got Harry, it doesn't have the same kick of surprise as hers did, but it's still something new, and it seems that you've got an excellent specimen here Johnny." She said, eyes gleaming mischievously. It seemed that all of John's family took a liking to Sherlock, and not entirely in an innocent way.
“Molly?”, Sherlock asked in wonder, “Why would I go out with her? I told you, girlfriends are not my area.”
„Miss me?“, he asked and couldn't help but smile when he saw his John again... he thought he had lost him! This was relief.
Sherlock recognized the voice at once and jumped away from John; the ecstasy vanished from his eyes and made way for the icy fear that took possession of him now. Jim Moriarty!
John waved her question away with an air of tiredness. "I'll tell you in detail after I get some tea, but basically, there is someone watching us back in London, and we need to get away. Don't worry," John started, when he saw the anger in her eyes, "They don't know we're here. You and mum are safe." His reassurances didn't make a big difference to her attitude, but it did enough to switch her anger to reluctance, and keep John and Sherlock welcome in the house. She looked John up and down, her eyebrow arched. Silence. If he stood too close to her, John could smell the lingering scent of alcohol on her, and although she didn't appear to be drunk, John had every suspicion she was. In a way, she resembled Sherlock, who had also mastered the art of pretending to be sober. Of course, Sherlock was properly sober now. She waved her hand dismissively to the room on her left, obviously done with trying to break John. "You know where everything is, don't you?" She asked with a hint of bitterness. Harriet knew that he didn't know where the cups or the tea was, John could tell. She had always liked to play these little games of control and humiliation, even when they were children, she did it, poking fun at him when his friends were around, telling him constantly that he was doing it wrong, things like that. He walked into the kitchen, and almost immediately spotted where Harriet kept her prized collection of alcohols and liquors. Definitely still a drinker then. John thought to himself, if someone lit a match near her when she breathed, she would go up like a firework. Sherlock had stayed in the hallway, observing and deducing God knows what about John's family. His movements were signalled by the creaking in the wood floor made by his footsteps. Please come in here, John thought, let me hold you, let me set your mind at peace, my little tin soldier. Sherlock remained in the hallway. Now that he thought about it, it was probably best to let him do his deductions, take his mind off of things. John stuck to what he did best, making tea, or at least, trying to find the objects he needed to do what he bloody did best. It had taken John 15 minutes to discover where the cups and teabags were, much to the delight of Harriet, who had stood in the second doorway on the other side of the room for the last 5 minutes, smirking, a bottle of red wine held loosely in her grip. Probably empty. The kettle was easy to spot, set down near the sink. The same one that John had last seen in this house. It was a whistler, meaning that it was heated on the stove, and when the water had boiled, it whistled, hence the name. By then, Sherlock had joined John in the room, and had sat down at the table. Seeing that the famous detective was now at her disposal, Harriet took the seat opposite him. No doubt she would try to seduce Sherlock, and despite the current situation John and the detective were in, it still made John eager to see what Sherlock would make of it, and the humiliation Harriet would experience.
