“Tony, I made a promise to you all those years ago when I slid that ring on your finger that I was going to stick with you thru thick and thin, you would always have a friend in me first  and I would always have your back, pick you up when you fall and walk thru life with your hand in my hand and show you how much I love you every day.”
Tony was feeling elated and then confused, he felt it was the best news of his life and he wanted to turn to Steve and ..but he …he couldn’t because Steve wasn’t here, Steve had kept a secret from Tony, Steve had taken a vibranium shield to Tony’s heart.
“Dr. Wu, Dr. Helen Cho and his specialist Dr. Alex Jensen are all there and I will be able to manage his security better there.” replied Pepper
“My time is up Tony, but you, you have a lot left to do , it wont be easy, wont be easy for a while, you wont might not even remember this but I know you and I know you will make it alright. I love you Anthony.”
They suggest that he stay close to his mate, his alpha that after a time he is going to need his mate, want him, and Tony laughs in there face and thinks he can and he will do this alone.
Steve could still feel tears framing his face he couldn’t see tony now, he couldn’t see his mate, his pregnant mate like this because of him.
“It is common for omegas to not know until a few weeks have passed already, he gave us quite the scare, it was touch and go over there for a while, you need to understand that he is in an extremely fragile state. He was under surgery for more than 8 hours, we were concerned about the baby.” explained the doctor
He has sudden bouts of anger, he remembers all the time Steve had held him whispered sweet nothings to him, promised him loved him while hiding all of it from Tony. Tony thinks he had been a fool to not see not see behind the curtain become so enamoured with the picture to forget to look behind to not have known. He feels so numb, so hurt and so tired he feels a gaping hole in his soul , he feels happiness sometimes slipping from his fingers. Sometimes he goes silent for hours and if it bother everybody nobody lets him know. He feels elated bout the baby and then he remembers about his father and everything he goes numb.
Steve could feel bare hands clawing away at his chest in a desperate attempt to rip his heart out of his chest. He wanted to cry, he wanted to let the pain out of his chest, but little did he know that the pain had made home in his chest. Whenever he opened his mouth it felt as if air was only trying to make way to his lungs because his heart was completely in pieces and his brain could do nothing but gasp around the air.
Pepper has always been there, Pepper who had helped him put his pieces back after Afghanistan, after obie ,always there always helping Tony. He is damn lucky to have pepper in his life.
Sometimes Tony feels people calling him, their voices are muffled also they are very far away, in the background and tony is here with his mama and he is safe and warm and content. He is also very tired but he doesn’t know why and he doesn’t want to leave.
He still has too much to do, get the accords properly shaped up, meet the spider kid, handle the board of directors, handle the media, handle R&D of his company, get Steve away from here, away from him.
Colonel James Rupert Rhodes is a an air-force pilot in the U.S Military since he was fresh out of M.I.T and then he was also War Machine, so he was known for his poise, calmness and ability to retain his cognitive thinking during highly tense situations. but it was safe to say nothing in his life had prepared him for the what he was facing right now.
Rhodey, his brother, his bestfriend was there looking furious and giving Pepper the stink eye, when he had asked about it the answer had hit him like a blow and he had to count backwards to get his breathing under control which again hurt like a bitch because of his lung, so all in all, everything was peachy.
Tony knows he will get through this but he doesn’t know if he will ever recover from his husband’s betrayal, if he will forgive him.
Now 12 years later here they were here  with their house in New York and Steve with his art galleries and Tony with his multi billion dollar company still very much the same in love.
The next time he opens his eyes there is a ring kept oh his bedside with a note and a phone and he picks it up and tries to hold his tears back.
Tony laughed at the memory, he remembered telling Jarvis that with trial and error he would become the best version of himself,the best son. In all his naivety he had thought had if he could collect all the feedback from his father’s responses and attitude towards himself he could make a good enough report and then analyse all of his shortcomings and change himself accordingly.
Tony put his elbows on the bar and his head between his arms, if he could concentrate he would almost hear anna softly humming the tunes to some Hungarian song while mixing chocolate chip in the cookie batter softly looking up to him giving him the most gentle smile and putting some chocolate chips in his mouth for being such a good boy.
Steve hitched a ride from Ethiopia to Egypt and then flew from Egypt to JFK. He was immensely thankful for Natasha because she had managed to get them fake passports and then with the help of the photostatic veil (nano mask) they were able to board the plane and land in America without being caught.
If somehow DUM-E had managed to get into the wiring again he was going to dismantle and donate the bot to Starbucks where he could take orders from obnoxious customers all day long, no more fetch the wrench for him.
It had been 7 days since Tony had been shifted to the room, he currently had a nasogastric tube because he was refusing to wake up so he had to be fed that way. He had an iv inserted in his arm and another one at the back of his arm to supply him with his daily dose of vitamins be irrespective of whether he wanted to wake up or not his body needed it, his baby needed it thus he was supplied with it.
Without waiting for a reply he continued, “ you were always resilient, always so persistent, nobody taught you that. For some time, when you were growing up I didn’t know what to do with you, you were always a bright eyed curious child, getting in all sorts of trouble since day one. I was always so scared for you, you would always fall down but then you would pick yourself up , without fail you would pick yourself up. I looked at you and realized you were a little bundle of trouble hell bent on surviving on sheer will and stubbornness.”
“You always were so strong Tony, even when your father mistreated you, when your mother failed to see your pain behind your innocent eyes you would always tell me that it all happened so that you could become better, as if you weren’t perfect the way you were born. I would often tell you that you didn’t need to be better, that you were my perfect little bajkeverő (Hungarian for trouble-maker).
“I have managed to disable Friday enough for us to get inside without putting anybody at any risk but we will have to be careful because with Pepper and Happy running the show tony is going to be heavily guarded.” informed Natasha
The lift tinged and its doors opened, rhodey, pepper, happy and vision got in \and then went up towards room tony had been shifted to.
Steve looked at the dog-tags and couldn’t decide whether they depicted his heart, Tony’s heart or Tony’s broken trust.
“ I think you are here to understand few things, maybe you have come to old me for some good old fashion advice.” said Jarvis
It’s a parade of doctors now each coming up to tell him what is wrong with him and what he needs to do and all he can think is about a certain super soldier is sitting outside, a secret that acts like a wall between them and a fight that destroyed them.
A feeling of sadness overtook Tony, it was very typical of his life to give him happiness and then wrap it up with a bow of sadness, a bow or the whole wrapping paper, whatever.
“He hates the beeping of the machines, it makes him wanna rip his hair out and both of us now about his passionate hate for hospitals. He would want to listen to music, he always calls music his solace, though he would hate me for playing Bach but if he wants to do something about it he better get up.” explained Rhodey
He is holding on for now, if he lets go now he will shatter, break and he fears that he will never be whole again.
Pepper had experience dealing with the media, the board members and everybody who wanted a piece of Tony’s time. So right now she was doing the one thing her best friend couldn’t do right now and that was keep the vultures away. She would make sure no more leaks happened, she was making the board members dance to her own tune and divert them so skillfully that they even forgot that they never got answers to the questions they had initially asked. And a day in hell would freeze over before the news of Tony’s pregnancy was released.
“Let me help Doll,” Softly, Bucky murmured as he moves to get in front of Tony. Gently and slowly, so as to not alarm or startled Tony maybe, Bucky uses his good arm and hand to unbutton his shirt. Efficiently yet gently Bucky removes bit by bit. Something not many Dom’s in Tony’s experience had been willing to do.
“Ooh, jackpot! I’m leaving this door here open a bit so that we can find it later!” Clint also uses his knife to make a mark on the door to make easy to identify later.
“Nearly finished Terminator ok? I’ll have you smelling of roses in no time,” Grinning cheekily, Tony starts on washing the front of Bucky’ body, using quick efficient strokes, the dirt was soon being washed away down the drain. Tony took his time though to carefully clean the metal arm. Working away as much grime as he could, for now, already the arm was moving better as gunk was cleaned from between the plates.
Tony startled a bit as he felt soaped hands start to wash him off, of all the grime that had stuck to him. Bucky’s hands were sure but quick as they scrubbed away, allowing Tony to float a bit in his head. Enjoying the warmth of the shower as steam rose. Adding an extra blanket of warmth that wraps around his senses.
Sam was happy for her, to have managed to keep ahold of something so pure in such dark times, Sam was a little envious but mostly, he is happy for her. Everyone needed something good to help them carry on.
Mentally cursing, Tony told his brain to stop it. Taking deep breathes he forced himself to calm down. Thinking about what-ifs wasn’t going to help him now.
“I believe you Tony” softly Steve assured him, a hand reaching out but stops just short from touching Tony’s own as Steve looks up at him, asking him with his eyes if he can touch. Hesitantly, Tony reaches out a hand and lets Steve take a hold of his own. Oddly enough taking comfort from the contact. Bucky look at their hands in what Tony thinks is longing when he spots the look on his face.
“Shit man, I wondered what the commotion was all about but we couldn’t see due to the other houses. We not waiting for him?” Sam looked at Steve in disbelief that he was going too leave someone behind like this.
“It…it bit my arm…” hands trembling, Wade pushes up his jacket sleeve to reveal a bite mark on h upper arm. Near his shoulder. The teeth had just barely broken the skin, but that was enough to transfer the disease.
“Bucky?” Hopeful Steve urges Tony and Peter towards the house the sounds come from but makes them hide behind some bins in case there are Deado’s inside that Bucky is fighting. Quickly Steve practically kicks the front door in, shield and machete raised as he steps over the threshold but pauses as he takes in the situation.
“I saw some construction trucks and machines nearby, maybe they have some fuel ion them we can siphon?” Clint looks up thoughtfully, thinking it over Steve nods, there’s a good chance that the fuel would still be in the machines and any spares cartons in an office, this place is pretty far from  most towns to stop by for a refill.
Sam could understand her concern, that’s why they have people seeing each group, to see them for themselves without having everyone in potential danger. Thankfully its Yukio who speaks up as she packs away some of their supplies, an opinion they would trust.
“I think it would be a good idea to join forces, safety in numbers after all. They have a lot of manpower which would be welcome I’m sure we all agree, I mean it’s not like were hurting for space?” Natasha reasoned, turning her gaze to each member of the room as she talks.
As Steve tries to control his breathing, Natasha and Clint are looking at each other in shock. She would never of guessed that Steve would of been the father.  Sure she knew about the cheeky one time on the heli, but this? Clint looked just as out of his depth here as well. His eyes wide from the shock and helplessness to do anything.
The air smelt thick of ozone and electric. A scent both Dom and Sub recall belonging to the Thunder God.
The journey takes them two days, this is mostly from having to track down more fuel and check out some caravans.to be attached to the back of the truck. So far the ones they have found have been damaged in a way they can’t fix or infested by large groups that they have simply left it behind.
“Oh right! Loki came with me!” At that Thor turns and points up on top of a building where indeed, the younger sibling lounged on an ac unit. Idly inspecting his nails.
Tony felt a spark start inside of him as he gently yet calmly extracted himself from Bucky’s steel grasp but kept one of his hands in Bucky’s. Eyes dark and thunderous as Tony clenched his other hand into a tight fist, moving towards the tall metallic Dom. Stopping not far from him, neck craning up to look him in the eye not showing an ounce of submission, Tony speaks; voice hard yet calm- the voice of iron man.
“Keep this, if things go bad for whatever reason, make a run for it if you can ok?” Seeing Wade about to protest he shake his head hard. “No protesting. If I can at least get you to live a little longer I will ok? Stay safe for me kiddo…”
Hopefully now I have means to write the chapters will be updated often. Come to my tumblr under larissaloki to ask questions and bug me to write!
They weren’t sure how long they stood there like this, soaking in the warmth of the other. Enjoying each other’s company when they heard the bedroom door swing open. Jolting apart, they could hear Steve’s amused tone drifting over the spray of water. They could also hear Peter’s non-stop excitable chatter it wasn’t long till a knock on the door came.
“We’re pirates Wade!” Laughing, Wade nods and bumps their shoulders playfully together when shouting could be heard from inside the building. Dropping the fence post and tools, Bucky, Loki and Thor quickly move towards Tony and the kid. Taking up a defensive position incase the shouting isn’t from anyone friendly.
“We should wait til the kids are in bed, and Colossus’s group is here and settled. I think if we all discussed it as one big group, we may have better results. Find out each of their strengths to help us”
Tony’s only reply was Sam speedily backing away, gagging at the smell and tar like blood that slowly drained from the head that Tony held up.
“Strange, I could have sworn it was me saving your butt Clint” Chuckling Steve pretends to stroke his chin. His face scrunched up as if pondering. Only to laugh more fully when a cushion is frown at his head.
Finally finishing the back, Tony taps Bucky’s shoulder, “turn around please?” Looking up, Tony’s eyes again catches Bucky’s. A guarded look had come over his eyes, as Bucky had felt Tony finding more and more scars. There as also an odd sort of vulnerability in Bucky’ face a well, as he had let Tony take them all in.
Agreeing with a Bucky’s orders, Sam sets off up the stairs first. Leaving Bucky rubbing at his face in sudden bone deep exhaustion. If they didn’t have the undead to worry about, this wouldn’t have been as difficult, plans much more easily planned and the government on their side. As it is, they have so many things running against them, that what would normally probably be an easy rescue mission; was now mission impossible.
Chuckles now dying down to simply an amused look, Bucky pulls Tony back tighter and nuzzles into his neck nipping at it playfully as he tries to soothe the irritable Sub.
Nervously fiddling with his glasses, cleaning them with the hm of his shirt, Bruce finally spoke up. Bringing up the most dreaded conversation that none of them wanted to have but needed to have.
“What the hell did you do to this?! Who on earth was messing around in here?! The poor thing is mutilated!” Grabbing tools and a cloth rag, he sets to work quickly and efficiently. Peter wondering over, crawling into Bucky’s lap without a care to peer in, curious. Freezing, Bucky stare’s at the kid unsure what to do.
He knows he shouldn’t of taken it so personally that Tony had hid that he was a sub from him. Had hid it from everyone but he had been thrown for a loop. He came from a time that suppressants were not a thing. Didn’t excuse his shitty reaction one bit though, god if Peggy was here she would of smacked him upside the head for how he handled this!
It wasn’t long before his muscles started to cramp from being in one position for so long. Tony’s arms started to shake from the effort to stay upright, the stress, lack of food and water making him tire quicker than normal. Biting his lip, he tries to stay still, if anything outside saw their hiding spot under the blanket move; they would be swarmed in seconds.
“WOO!” pumping his fist excitedly, Clint tears into his candy and gives out a dirty moan of pleasure. “Better than any partner I’ve ever had!” That statement was met with everyone exclaiming their disgust at him, Bruce even going as far as to throw his water bottle (empty) at his head.
They had already done a supply run, they didn’t have any reason to stay other than a quick reprieve. They can’t stay here though, there’s little in the way of defence. They ideally need a place on high ground to be able to see around for any incoming hordes, rather than always knowing nearly to late. As he pondered on what to do next, he recalls the lightning from several hours ago.
Please tell me what you thin guys, comment are what help my muse and drive me on! Come to my tumblr and send anonymous asks and messages! I won’t always be able to reply on here
“Come on squirt, your turn to use the bathroom and have a wash while you’re at it. The hot water finally works!” Grinning, Bucky shows the kid how to use the shower and gets him a towel ready before leaving him to it. Leaving the door open just a crack in case of emergencies.
At this moment in time, Wade could only feel numbness settling into his mind. The shock still preventing him to feel the full extent of the bite’s pain.  Above his head, he could hear Tony mumbling no over and over. Not wanting to believe this was happening.
“Is the place where your group is stationed safe? What is your group like?  I don’t want to move to a place easily invaded sweetie”
“I’m sorry to doll for not staying around more at the time to help you. If one of us had the sense to hang around more to support you at that moment. You could have kept your old life, not to of had to hide.” Bucky’s voice went quiet as he clutches his cup like a lifeline. “After the truth of your parents you still went out of your at to help me. Brought me peace and a safe place to get to grips. I owe you so much doll.”
Tony on the drive had gotten a hold of a bat and had hammered nails in for extra hitting power against the Deado’s. and refilled all the guns as well as shared out the mag with Bruce’s help. Armed and Peter covered in protective sports padding that they had found in the last town yesterday, Steve led his group on it’s way.
It was too soon for anything else and they were fine with that for now, but in the darkened bathroom together, they could just be.
“-stay behind me ok? Keep an ear out incase any of those things are still about. We are gonna head straight to the house my group were in to see if they are still there.”
“Yeah, take Natasha with you, your both sneaky and good at stealth, you’ll be quicker by yourselves.” Checking the fences as Tony had taught them they spread out daggers drawn in case.
Two hours later found the group in Irondale, they parked their cars in the middle of the roads at an angle placing large signs that Sam and Steve managed to put together in case Bucky or Thor came by and missed them. They would now to wait by the car for the group to come back later.
“Immune? Well how bout that huh? Tell our spy to keep an eye on them and their group, to report back to us any weaknesses and who would be useful. Any Subs?”
Spotting a hill ahead, perfect to slow down the deado’s, he dodges another set of hands pushing himself harder. His legs have started to burn from the continued running, his lungs starting to protest. He will have to find somewhere safe to hide soon before they really do give out.
Snorting amused at this kids sass, Bucky shook his head, “oh god its like a mini Steve/Tony with me”
Rolling off the roof, Bucky falls onto the few at the edge of the horde, knocking them to the ground. Dazed he sits up, the snarls of the dead he had fallen on snap him out of it quickly. Bringing out a knife from who knows where, Bucky stabs at one and rolls to his feet. Deftly avoiding snapping jaws. Standing Bucky backs up watching the horde with a snarl on his own face.
By Steve, Natasha rolled her eyes a bit but nods in agreement to Clint’s remark. “That’s pretty much what we found.”
Quiet falls on them again as they put the food into a pot to cook on the camping gear. Crossing his arms over his chest Steve chewed his lip in thought as he looked at the toddler, an idea came to him.
Sam and Thor deciding to take Colossus and Yukio back to collect their group to bring back, Loki went to sort food, the kids following behind him bugging him to show them (or Wade asking him to teach them some magic, to which Loki scoffed and told him a flat no.) some magic. Leaving Tony, Bruce and Bucky in the corridor.
“That’s true, but this one looks like a small centre. Just enough for a local community for small things. In this town here, a large hospital that looks like only a small drive away where I would think people would go for major things. We would have to be careful obviously but it could potentially work”
It was inside a hardware store where things had started to go wrong. They had just dropped off a few things into their car to make sure they had no extra baggage as they visited the next store. Doing the same routine as the last few stores, Bucky made some noise just inside the shop’s door and closed it again as they waited for any deado’s to come to the front.
“What if Thor isn’t there Steve?” Tony looks up at the Dom, his eyes meeting Steve’s, unwavering. “What if we go back and it was just a freak storm?” What if Bucky in’t there? Lays unspoken between them but they all know it’s there.
Taking a deep breath, Steve tries to reign it all back in. The last thing they need is a deado hearing him having a moment in the bushes.
The bathroom was dim despite the midday sunlight outside. The windows were small and high up, covered in ivy that spanned the entire wall outside. The bathroom looked smaller and less daunting in the low light. The spacious tub that’s sunken into the floor looked more inviting to relax than some mini swimming pool. Tony liked it, as he took off his jacket and slung it over a clothes railing. Turning around he saw Bucky struggling with his own jacket. The metal arm seemed to be paining him a bit as Bucky tried to get it off.
To cover more ground the group split up into smaller groups, Sam and Bruce together, Clint and Nat and the last group being Steve, Tony and Peter.
True to Tony’s and Loki’s predictions, the room with all the patients in was locked and barred from the outside. The staff had obviously attempted to isolate a situation that was beyond their help and tried to prevent it spreading. Grateful for this mercy, the group moved on and soon found a storage room, boxes and boxes of medication and equipment lined the room and shelves.
“That sounds fine with me, I’ll take Negasonic back with me to the others Colossus- you and Yukio would be the best ones to go talk to their group.”
“Finally, why is it that when you need one there’s none of these around but the moment you don’t want them, there’s a whole horde?” Tony chirps as he jumps down from his perch from within a nearby tree, Sam dropping down besides him; making a face of disgust at the rotting skin smeared on the ground.
“about 5 bullets, I’ve been trying to save them as long as possible, nearly all gun shops in the last town were completely bare. A few pieces of clothing was left and wiring but nothing I could easily carry or had room for. I have some stuff in my truck, if any of it’s still there that is”
“What’s your name?” Kneeling down to be at eye level Steve looks at him confident but with steel in his eyes. He needs to let this guy know he’s not someone easily tricked.
“Me, Thor, Loki and Bucky will go into town with you. You will stick close to one of us the entire time ok? We don’t know how dangerous the centre will be so we need to be really careful, we can’t loose you nor Bruce as you are our best bets of surviving this.” Crossing his arm over his broad chest, Steve gave Tony his Captain America look. To his right, Bucky had a similar look and stance, only his actually looked a tad more intimidating.
Tearing his eyes from Bucky’s shoulder, when he felt his shoulders tense a bit, obviously aware of what Tony was looking at. Tony got started on washing away the rest of the dirt. Each patch cleaned revealed more scars, most of them old- obviously from his Winter Soldier days. back from the days, the Soldier had fewer qualms about injuring the body and only focused on finishing the job. Scars from the tests the Hydra scientists put him through or used him as a shield.
“We may not even find anyone Clint, but we still need to collect as much stuff as we can for the possibility of having others join eventually or for emergencies”
At Steve’s exclamation, the group turn to face them. Thor moving quickly to stand between his smirking brother and the rapidly angering Captan.
“I rented out working horses, provided fields for archery events and sometimes to the other farmers close by. I also did machine maintenance for much cheaper than any other company. Pep helped with the bills if I was short one month.” Chuckling, he played with the hem of his robe. “I’m afraid I can’t offer any sleeping clothes to you all, apart from maybe Natasha.”
Swallowing thickly, Steve maintains the eye contact, unwilling to look away first. “If he’s not there…we move on tomorrow. We check he town today and if it’s already empty then we move on.”
Detaching the shower head, Bucky quickly rinsed Tony off before returning it and gently nudges out of the way. Murmuring to Tony that he won’t take to long to wash and then Tony could get back under it.
Nodding in approval, Tony agreed it was a good a plan as any. Bucky who had moved to perch on the arm of the chair Tony is sat on rubbed at his jaw scratching the stubble there.
Giggling Wade smiles at him, it’s a card he actually needs but he won’t take it, Peter till hasn’t grasped the game fully. His excitable personality inables him to keep secrets yet. The two kids upon meeting had gotten along like a house on fire, Peter not straying from Wade’s side if he could help it.
Tensing, Tony looks away trying to calm his breathing. He knew it was only a matter of time before curiosities got the better of the others. He had hoped for more time though, more time to plan for this conversation. He knows Steve would only keep asking over time, he was nothing if not stubborn and persistent to do good by anyone.
The minutes crawl by as the group wait..and wait...and wait. What seems like hours of uncomfortable squatting in the weeds and a few close calls with some dead wondering a bit to close. The horde finally pass.
The mass of scars that spider out over his shoulder in a kind of morbid maze immediately drew Tony’s eye. As Tony gently washed out all the dirt from the area, making sure the skin around the metal wasn’t aggravated or inflamed, he realised how smiler the mess looks compared to Tony’s own scars on his chest. Both scars stood as symbols of just what they had both survived. The trials they had faced in life that helped to mould who they are today.
“They are in the west, hopefully, they are heading out of town, we should wait a while. keep watch in case they circle back this way. If we are lucky, they will head out and keep on straight west.” Frowning Bucky sits on a low branch of a tree next to him. His gaze trained on the town, his ears straining to keep track of the moving hoard of the dead.
They move across to the closest road leading out of the city, slowly. Taking extra precautions to not get seen. Many times having to duck and hide, wait for the few walkers they come across to pass. Slowly but surely they make it to the road. Checking each car they come across for any extra supplies or if they can use it. Most have already been siphoned out of gas.  Several pile ups here and there, that had at one point been burning.
Sauntering over to the other two, Bucky smirked at Steve who had yet to really close his mouth but was helping Tony dry.
The exact same smile Tony had seen countless times on history reels from the war. In the photos displayed in exhibits at the museums. A smile that, Tony had fantasied much more about as a child than most teenage boys ought to. Dreamt of it being aimed at him when he did something good or did something that amused Barnes. Having that very same smile aimed at him, was phenomenal.
Bruce took up three plates for Natasha, Clint and Wade who were still in the quarantine room. Bruce was going up to do the last (hopefully) check on Wade, to see if he was in the all clear of the virus. If he was, he was going to be able to rejoin the group properly finally again; the group, as a result, were all thrumming with nervous energy.
“James…” Tony seemed to sag in relief, glad that the super solider that had saved him, was still alive and whole.
They can’t reverse nor drive forward due to to many dead surrounding them. Gritting his teeth Bucky pushes Wade into the foot wells out of hands reach. If worst came to worst he could try and get out and lead the dead away long enough for Wade to make a break for it. Not that Bucky is keen to take a suicidal route mind you.
“She was, Colossus tried hard to salvage the rice! It wasn’t the best meal but it wasn’t to bad either. Professor Charles since then had taken to doing cooking lessons with her every now and again, hoping to try and avoid that situation again”
Tipping his head politely, Loki calls for Thor to help the group carry everything upstairs to show the group to their rooms, allowing them to finally get settled in for the night. Bucky watches the weary and tired group trudge up the stairs, obviously exhausted from running all the time; looking themselves for much more permanent homes to dig in roots again.
“Tony, we’re just looking for somewhere safe to spend a little while to. You must have seen the news?”
They had been talking quietly to themselves, as soon as they noticed Tony they ceased. Looking up at the Sub. Gazes intense.
“You ok baby boy?” Tilting Peter’s chin up concerned he wipes away at his tears. Nodding a little bit, the toddler curls into his fathers chest shaking in fear. The sound! God they had been terrible!
“How bad is the city when you left? Do any of you know how Pepper is?” Opening his eyes, Tony looked around at the group. A sinking feeling in his stomach as each avenger either flinched or looked away at that. He could tell without any of them opening their mouths, the city was in bad shape. Swallowing thickly, Tony prayed Pepper had gotten out and is alive with a group somewhere.
For the first time in years, Tony could feel the start of a sub drop creep on him. A gentle soothing sensation that made him feel soft and fuzzy. For once, it wasn’t being met with resistance. Tony didn’t want to resist this time, he actually felt safe enough to allow it to wash over him a bit.
Relaxing, Tony leaned back into the contact and closed his eyes, letting his mind wander as they simply soaked in the other’s presence and warmth.
Allowing himself to smile more at the Doms across from him, Tony could feel his factored heart heal just a bit more right then.
Thinking, Tony hums to himself, “What about a disease research facility? They have them all over the country. Maybe one of those would be our best bet?”
“Everything will be fine, ok? Everything will be fine...” Biting his lip, he can’t help but feel guilty for lying. What else can he say? Taking a deep breathe, he pushes Peter to stand and groans as he gets off the hard floor himself. “Lets go and see if the others are ready huh?” Flashing a comforting smile, offering a hand, they head back down stairs after quickly stopping for Tony to change.
“Damn it Robocop, kid present!” Chuckling Bucky moved to sit on a sofa rubbing his face. The other two doing the same.
Upon being separated from his friend Wade, Peter had had a tantrum for a few minutes before going quiet and is currently curled up against Tony’s side.
Hands tightening into fists, it took every ounce of self control to force himself to stay still. To stay crouched on the floor on his hands and knees, Clint sat in front of him, looking to barely even breathing. Above him, Bucky’s warm presence helped to ground him. Keep him from trying to run out of the building and putting them all in severe danger.
Taking a deep breathe, Tony tenses before leaping across the gap, pulling his legs up high to avoid being grabbed. Reaching out he makes a grab for the side of the truck and just about manages it. Relief washes over him as he and Clint climb into the back of the truck that’s safe from the dead below. Looking back out Tony grins at Bucky.
sorry for my temp haitus there! depression  kept coming and going and cleared out all my creative drive for a bit and life in general got in the way and distracting! hope you gusy enjoy this i was debating this longer but i'm mean :p send me your thoughts! flames will be ignored unless they're actully helpful on how to make bits better!
Doing a quick knock incase anyone was inside, Bucky entered the house and called out softly knowing if Steve was here, he would hear him. With no answer Bucky knew they had moved on without him. That’s fine, he knows the plan from before.
Taking a deep breath, Tony brings the device up closer to be able to speak into it, clicking a button to turn it on. Static crackles through the air.
Tony spent two hours grilling Colossus and Yukio; names were finally swapped after an initial freak out; asking them about who they are, how do they know the group that attacked, why would they attack them and what information did Colossus have that he could share?
Pouting but pacified by the prospect of eventually seeing other kids, Peter nods and goes back to his game with Wade.
“Sorry about your farm Tones...” Natasha offered quietly, twisting to face the two geniuses in the back. Next to her Clint is cleaning off a dagger, silently glad he kept his bow and arrows close at all times. Thankfully, due to high alerts everyone had kept most weapons close at all times, making a quick getaway much easier.
Snorting against his own will Tony shakes his head and takes a deep breathe, maybe treat this like a band aid?
The silence in the room after that statement was deafening. What was wrong in Asgard? Was this only temporary? Was Heimdell just simply taking a leak?
His chest squeezed painfully at the thought of all the tine he had missed with them. Things had gotten out of control fast while he was out of the loop, back at the beginning of all this. After the reveal of Tony’s sub gender he had felt betrayed and deceived. He had only jut woken up a few week ago from his ice sleep after all, only to find his best friend still alive.
“Tony? What you hatching in that head of yours?..” Bruce asked tentatively, watching Tony as he goes into the next room, seemingly ignoring the other two. Muttering under his breathe as he moves around the machines.
“Wade!!” Squealing and writhing to be put down, Peter dashes to Wade the moment his little feet made contact with the ground. Peter’s face split wide with a smile of pure joy at finally seeing his friend. Grinning widely, Wade manages to catch the speeding smaller body as it hurtles into him like a tiny torpedo.
“We all heard Metal man and Dollies story, we should discuss as a group what to do from here. Should we trust Colossus and his group?”
The moment the hot water touched Tony’s body, he immediately slumped into the spray with a groan. The water felt heavenly on his aching muscles. Distantly, Tony heard an amused chuckle behind him as Bucky reached for the soap.
On the verge of pulling strands of his hair out in frustration, Tony kept pulling up blanks in his mind- even Natasha had nothing from her time with shield or Red room that could help. If anyone hated not knowing something, it’s Natasha. She often took pride in having so much knowledge and knowing the important people in life, if Natasha didn’t know everything about you yet, it was only a matter of time before she did.
Feeling better with the two Dom’s back and their warm presence surrounding him, Tony allows himself to relax finally. Exhausted from today’s stress and activities, he just wanted 10 minutes to recharge. Get his emotions back into order again.
Relaxing when he realises that nothing is by the car, a sharp shearing pain tears through Clint’s upper thigh. Hand shooting down to his leg to clutch at the area where the most pain radiates, Falling against the camper and rolling to the side to get around to the opposite side from where the shot came from, Clint yells out for Natasha to get down as more shots are aimed at them. Looking down at his leg, Clint sees a cross-bow bolt sticking through his leg, blood oozing around the edges of the wound.
“Yeah, it looks like he may be back, that lightning was to concentrated to be natural. I think in the least we need to check it out?”
“Serial killers could still be alive you know” Chirping cheerfully, Yukio climbs out of the truck, leaving a suddenly frozen Sam.
“Ooh sounds cool,” Smiling the elder boy hugs Peter hard. All of the adults knew the separation wasn’t easy on both of the kids, having made a fast friendship, they didn’t like to be apart. Tony found it endearing that the two boys had such a strong connection already. It often reminded him of his and Rhodey’s own relationship.
“Warning us would have been nice you little punk! Jesus between you and Steve I’m surprised I’m not entirely grey”
They could only conclude, that this Francis had to be a new development from either the result of this current world or a new villain that hadn’t had the chance to hit their radar before all this happened. They were going in this essentially blind.
With a yell, Tony lashes out at a Deado that came toward him- cutting its head in half. He had no patience to be considerate. He just wanted to get into the car. Sliding along the Bonnet of the car, Tony lands on his feet on the other side and climbs into the car. Wade is wedged between the front seats, a butterfly knife in one hand that he was given for self-defence. The hand was stuck making it obvious why he couldn’t kill the Deado.
“Hold on Wade!” Putting the car into gear, Bucky tries to force through hoping to knock the ones in front out of the way. He gains very little ground as the larger group reaches them in the car.
Clint was the one to grin leaning forward nodding, “Oh yeah! It was an escaped experiment! Nearly ate Cap there! So me; being the amazing Hawkeye I am; swooped in and saved him using an exploding arrow!”
sorry for the delay in updating! christmas was hectic and i was ill a lot! i have vague plans on where to go with this bit is there any extra characters anyone would like to see added? i am planning on adding a child wade wilson but still thinking on how to introduce him!
“Why don’t we just attach a small caravan onto the truck?” The question came from Bruce, who up until then had seemed content to stay quiet. Surprised, Steve nods slowly at that suggestion. It’s a good suggestion as well. It wouldn’t really require any extra fuel to run, many people can hide in it as they go from point A to B. Or the group could sleep in it should they need to.
“Well done” Ruffling his hair she pushes a book towards him and Clint, “Try and do some reading as well ok? Good boy, you’re going to have to help Clint, He’s not that good yet”
“You ok Tony?” Standing up and smashing the 5th deado’s head into the side of the truck almost on auto, Steve looks up at Tony, his eyes blazing with protectiveness. They are dark with anger and intense. His body thrumming with energy from adrenaline, his chest heaving. He and Natasha must have found a closer car to be back so soon.
“Come and get your McBucky assholes, limited time only!” Turning, he darts off towards the tree line leading the majority of the horde away. The opportunity of food being so close and easier to get than the two above to tempting to pass up.
The last one on the sofa is a young adult Indian man, he seems to be trying to clean a gun, following Logan’s direction who sat on the floor with Negasonic and another male. The last guy has light brown hair that would probably look blonde in the summer sun, his face is what most would consider handsome, the kind of face that would have been popular in school.
Bucky hesitantly raises a hand, with an exasperated look Tony nods at him to speak, “just a question, how did your barn get full of deados?”
“Considering that all pharmacies we’ve come across have been cleaned out, this medical centre would be our only shot at getting anything that’s still available. Most would avoid it by themselves but with our group, we have a chance.”
yes this is heavily influenced by walking dead this scene but lets be real, that show pretty much did every scene imaginable! either way hope you guys like!
Glancing at Peter to make sure he will be ok, Steve shifts as the group settle around the room and looks at the new guy. Sam.
“We’ll stay put and keep a look out” Tony confirmed for him, watching as the two super soldiers stood and made their way down stairs to the basement.
Staring into her eyes, Tony looks, seemingly searching for something in them. He must have found what he was looking for, for he smiled shyly and nods looking down. “Thanks, I will. Can I join you for the rest of your shift?” Nodding with a soft smile, they huddle closer keeping watch together. Some bridges can be mended it seems after all.
Bucky takes up talking again as he takes a seat by Tony’s side, pressed tightly against him to offer comfort.
His face felt hot and wet. Biting his lip to prevent any more startling cries escaping, Tony pulls Wade into his chest again. This time rocking him harder, his face buried into Wade’s hair. Wade wasn’t stupid. He knew what the bites did, they were what allowed this epidemic to spread. Much like rabies, it sees to be passed through by bodily fluids. In this case, saliva.
“I take it she was taken off cooking duty huh?” Grinning, Sam takes a left that Yukio tells him to take, Yukio giggles nodding in agreement.
Eyeing him carefully, Steve looks for any signs of him trying to lie but all he sees; like Natasha did; complete honesty.
Conceding to that argument, Sam carried on in behind Tony and Bruce with Clint bringing up the rear.
“But that makes the abduction of your friend all the stranger, Captain America is strong.” Colossus’s own thoughts seem to be echoing hers as he speaks out. Shrugging almost nonchalant, Logan shakes his head just as confused as them.
Standing Steve moves over to look down as well. It towns they haven’t been to but they could make it. It’s a start. Tony
“It’s a big place, lots of rooms to booby trap and hide in if we get attacked. The group themselves are nice” she smiles sweetly as she presses a quick kiss to Negasonic’s lips as she passes her. “I’d say we would be safe there with them”
“We need someplace that’s completely secure and easy to fortify from the dead. Some place we can leave people behind in and be sure that they will be safe.” Bucky played with a butterfly knife idly as he looked at Steve.”I’m not sure what’s in this area and even if we did we don’t know what’s overrun or what’s destroyed”
“Yeah, it could be someone by themselves coming to see if we’re an easy target. If we keep vigilant it should be enough to deter them, when we get back into the truck, draw your shield and keep it out.” Clint mumbles back, purposely making his words unreadable by anyone with possible lipreading skills.
“We need to get out of this city Steve...It’s to dangerous here, not enough cover or directions to run in if we encounter a horde again.” Bucky stands dusting off his knees clutching his rifle tight as he looks around. Paranoia is getting to them all due to lack of sleep and food.
Perhaps, now being back together as a group, something could grow again. He and Bucky would have to talk about it ofcourse, but he doesn’t see how it would be a problem. Hopefully they can find a safe place, a place with high walls to hide behind. A place Peter can run around without fear. A place they can all rest without always having to look over their shoulder. A place love could grow.
“Have you ever fought fire breathing dragons?” Bemused, the team exchange looks, behind Peter they can see Tony snort to himself in amusement.
“I and Loki can sit in the back, we are much stronger and able to protect ourselves from these walking dead. Do not worry” Thor assures him smiling at Sam who still looked dubious. Thinking about it Steve had to admit they needed something bigger if they were going to be saving others.
“You mean Captain America looking guy?” Colossus asks, tilting his head as looks back down the street.
Tony grinned as he watched his son and the kid Bucky found, Wade, chat up a storm in one of the bedrooms upstairs.
Loki nods at this, “I shall keep watch here while you focus on the hoard down there. Clinton, go to the cars and inform them of the situation.”
Gasping in mock horror, Tony put his hand over a fan vent quickly, “Hush! She will hear you! Don’t listen to the silly Dom baby girl!”
Murmuring in agreement, Steve goes to the connecting parts to unhitch the camper; lifting it by himself and easily moving it to their own truck. That should be a big enough ‘do not fuck with us’ sign.
“Get out of my home..” His tone is like steel, a no bullshit tone. Lowering all their weapons Steve goes to take a step forward, only for Tony to take off the catch on the gun. Making him stop.
“That’s the thing Tony, we do. We walk to carefully around each other. To much history behind us and we have that affecting us as a group. I don’t want us to start arguing over something in the middle of a street and it ending badly. I think we both need closure.”
Trigger/squik warning. Gore scene near the end so be careful, but honestly if you’re reading a zombie fic it’s to be expected. It’s quick so can skip it easily. It’s practcally just one large paragraph but it’s there. Enjoy and come yell at me on tumblr over it!
Baffled Bucky walks towards the Asgardian prince, his eyes nearly bugging out of his head. They had thought that Thor wouldn’t be coming back ever again. Yet here he was! The Asgardian in question looked pretty much the same as before. Long golden hair Half pulled back out of his face with only a thin wisp that hangs loose. A short beard covers his chin that gives him somehow an endearing look. His leather hide like armor and long red cape that are exactly as he remembered, completes the look.
Feeling a sliver of unease go down his spine, Thor hurriedly pocketed the device and got the gates open as fast as he could, standing to the side to let Sam through before locking them up tightly again.
If he had a lab  or any lab equipment; he and Bruce could perhaps work to make a cure. Anything to slow the effects of the bite! As it was, they were stuck with no equipment. No electricity to run said equipment on even. All they could do was wait to see if Wade was able to overcome the disease.
Compared to the sweet, tranquil air from last night, the next morning was much more explosive. The exploding mainly came from Tony, who was being loud enough to make his displeasure known.
Jumping at being caught, Sam glances at Bucky quickly before diverting his eyes to his own pocket again. With a heavy sigh, Sam pulls out the device he still had on him.
Lungs burning, legs aching with the amount of strain he’s putting on his over tired; under fed body Clint pushes on. Ignoring his bodies cries for rest.
“Don’t worry wrecking ball, I’m OK to do this, I have you all here to help me or take over if I can’t handle it OK?”
“Ok Steve, word of warning before we go in, it’s not exactly pretty in here ok? I only got a glimpse when the bitch came at me-“ they pass the body of said female just outside the bottom basement door that look to be made specifically to sound proof the room beyond it. “But what I did see, wasn’t good and I think another is in there…” trailing off, Bucky got a knife out and ready as Steve raised his shield in front ready to charge at whatever may be on the other side. Nodding at Bucky once ready.
Unease coiled in their stomachs, making their stomachs feel like they are lined with lead. Gasping trying to take a full breathe, Steve’s next words came out in a breathless whisper, “I could have lost both him and Tony...I never got to tell Tony that I still cared about him. I have a family now Nat...and it scares me shitless.” Looking at her finally, his eyes reflect the very real fear he feels. This world they are in, is far from safe. Far from suitable for kids as young as Peter. She can see the unsaid fear, that he’s scared to loose them now. Scared to loose them before having the chance to reconnect properly.
Luckily the machinery area isn’t to far, the building estate thankfully small. Ahead he can see Tony's mop of slightly curled hair behind a tractor. Must be trying to get the fuel out of it. With renewed sense of urgency he skids to a stop by them. Making them jolt in surprise, Bucky already halfway through pulling Tony behind him be fore he realised it was Clint.
Swearing louder, Bucky kicks out at the closest arm chair hands running angrily through his hair as he paces for a few steps before turning to Tony who was still staring at Natasha.
He can guess that the opponent is bombarding them with all this, to make them sloppy, rash in their decisions and easier to take down.
“This room here, where most of the patients where housed, seems to be full of them. The windows were partially blocked by tables, to prevent outside Dead from looking in I suppose. Most of the rooms were empty but locked up tight, we would have better chances getting into them from the inside. This room here,” Loki points to one part of the map for Steve. “Had some more Dead, mainly staff it appears. The door however is bolted on the inside thankfully, someone must had locked the door before being killed from the inside. On the other hand he room is a research lab room, one with most of the machines Tony and Bruce need”
Pausing at Sam’s reaction, Tony grin’s cheekily, “it’s just an arm Sam, hardly going to bite you.” chuckling with amusement as Sam quickly picks the arm back up, a slight blush can be seen on his darkened cheeks. Without further delay, Tony brings down the machete onto the neck, severing the head from the body.
“I didn’t think you would be coming back! No one did!” Grinning in relief he clasps hands with the thunder god, patting his other shoulder. “Am I glad to see you though, always in the nick of time huh?”
Practically everyone raised their hand or voiced their agreement verbally, even the kids waved heir hands about. Excited by the prospect of having new people around.
“I will come straight back ok? Once I’ve checked the gate and closed them to make sure no group of Deado’s get in. I promise I won’t be long” Smiling Bruce ruffle Wade’s hair, urging him back inside the car.  “Make sure you keep these doors shut tight ok?” With the last wave, Bruce jogs down the drive needing to get there fast, so that he can get back faster.
His back hits a wall, meaning he needs to get up fast. Gritting his teeth he gets up wincing as his ankle hurts, must have twisted it as he fell just a moment ago. Doing his best to ignore the horde not far from him he pushes one dead that’s gotten near, back to hit and trip up some. It’s a dead end, he can’t really run in any direction as the horde surrounds him.
“-he’s here to help us. I understand that people may not trust him but he can help you save others. We wish to get as any survivors as possible and get to Asgard. Or at least some place safer”
“We can’t be sure there isn’t still groups managing to get by in once high populated areas. They would still be dangerous. I guess it doesn’t really matter where we go actually...” Nodding his agreement, Steve focuses on the road looking for any signs to get any idea which way their heading. “Agreed, but we can’t just wonder aimlessly. We may have to camp in the car tonight if we don’t find someplace in a few hours. We can decide where to head in the morning.”
“Thats the one” Nodding Tony bends down when Peter gets an excited look in his eye and turns to the group with a look of awe.
“What of friend Steven? Was he hit to?” Thor’s booming voice prompted, worry was needling them all, only getting worse a Natasha tenses even more. Looking at each of them, obviously reluctant to tell.
“I thought he was not far behind us,” Yukio comments as she looks down the street as well confused, following Colossus and Nat who heads back to where they last saw Steve. Grumbling gruffly, the one introduced as Logan strides after them, keeping an eye at the rear while Negasonic stays by the truck with Sam and Clint.
“Thankyou To-“ Bruce is cut off by Tony raising a hand, “Save it, the only reason I’m letting you stay is because my son likes you all for whatever reason...in the morning I will show you around, tell you how everything works and the perimeter. You all pull your weight or else your gone”
Rolling his eyes and finally taking a seat himself, Steve shoved Clint’s feet off the table before replying, his tone long suffering and seems as if he’s had to already explained this several times before.
“Is that the housing place your group stayed at?” Wade muttered as he points through the trees at a building site that was indeed where Bucky had been staying.
Stroking Peter’s hair, Tony tucked him tightly against his side as he whispers soothingly once the tense moment passed. Steve sat on the other side of Peter providing warmth and a sense of safety. “It’s ok kiddo, their gone now, try and get some more sleep ok?” Smiling gently at his son, slowly rocking to send Peter to sleep, his eyes eventually drooping and finally falling back to sleep.
“Ah! That um...a group of them came by during the early hours of the morning, I was just about to turn on my kitchen light when I saw them. Luckily I didn’t or else...yeah...but they had been attracted by the sounds of my horses...” Taking a deep breathe he looks him square in the eye. “I went out, waited till they were all in before locking the barn doors. Stayed away quietly until their movements died down. They are calm in there. Lack of stimulation causes them to sorta just go in saver mode I guess. So please, no loud sounds or bothering the barn, I Don’t know how long it would hold for. “
On the ground, atop a pile of leaves is a shiny metal object, flashing colours coming from it alerting the Deado of its presence. Not caring what kind of colours it was making, all the Deado cared for was that it was changing, giving the appearance of moving which equalled food. With a lurch the Deado shuffles marginally faster towards the object.
Still not completely convinced, Steve looks over at Bucky. Bucky himself didn’t look to pleased with the plan, but Steve could see that Bucky agreed, even if reluctantly, with this plan.
Panting harshly through the pain, Clint swings to aim at the roof again, but before he can make a shot someone else does. Hitting the man right in the side of the head causing the guy to fall off the roof. Confused, Clint lowers his gun as he glances around to look for the mystery shooter.  Down the street shooting down the ones that Nat was aiming at, are two people; a man and what appears to be a teenager around 16-18.
“Sam? Bruce? Is Tony and Bucky back?!” Bursting into the room, his heart sinks only seeing Sam at the window keeping lookout from behind thick curtains. Bruce on the bed showing Peter how to make a snare. “Damnit, Stay up here ok? A horde is heading this way, not big but still dangerous! I’m heading to get Tony and Bucky now. Remember to barricade behind me Sam in case we don’t get back. We may duck into another house closer to where they are now!”
Nodding in understanding, Bucky ushers the others behind him in faster asking Loki to close the double doors behind them. Opening his mouth to start asking questions when two others; that cause’s him to tense up again; join them.
Tony is immediately racing down the corridors, his mind focused on one thing only at this point. Getting to the kids trapped in the car. Questions could come later, Tony couldn’t bare it if he lost his son or caused Wade to get bitten.
“What shell we do about Steve? We have to come up with a plan as soon as possible, the longer we leave it the more chance of something bad happening…”
“So it looks like it’s decided. Sam, you take half the group with you and lead the way to the mansion. The rest of us will follow behind and we will clear out the mansion first and make it safe to stay in. Once that is secured we will make a plan and check out the centre. That ok with everyone?”
“Just one, an older one but still could breed for a few more years. We can’t tell what the kid is yet.”
Rolling onto his back to check on Wade, he notices that Wade is already awake and staring out of the window. Watching the rain with a peaceful expression. For a few moment’s they stayed like that, just listening to the rain’s lullaby.
“You’re right, you’re both like charming cockroaches huh?” Chuckling, Steve lets him with a small push. Trying to ignore the lump in his throat. “You got that right,” Reaching out he ruffles Peter’s hair to try and prevent the child from worrying. Getting a giggle and a small hand shoving him away, he counts it as a success.
“I agree to send the kids, they need to get away from here. They are the future after all…” a look of conflict comes over Tony’ face. He wants to keep his son close but he also knows he could be greatly beneficial to the group. For example, his scent could be used as a lure. There were ways to use his sub gender to their benefit. On the other hand, he didn’t want to leave the kids by themselves.
Snorting with amusement Clint leant against the side of a wine rack, arms folded across his chest. If there was anything down here, it would have found them by now.
Bucky chuckles at that a bit as he winks at Tony over the top of a drink. Tony felt his lips twinge in a smirk at that, able to easily picture this. Besides Bucky, Steve seems to straighten his shoulders as if he was about to face a firing squad. Quite possibly not far from the truth.
With great reluctance Steve stood up an hour later, gently as he could he shook Tony awake. His sensitive ears picking up Natasha in starting to move about in the other room.
Surrounding the stranger, Bucky and Tony move to cover doorways and windows as best as they can and making sure everything is locked. Peter moves to sit on a sofa with Bruce who’s nervously fidgeting. Clint seems to be staring at the guy from behind, with narrowed eyes as if daring him to try something.
“Oh for god’s sake give me a break from you hungry fuckers…Run!” Picking up Wade as he’s much faster, Bucky ran back down the street for the car. Hoping they can get in and take off before they end up surrounded. Cursing spitefully Bucky notices some small groups from earlier had managed to catch up to them and were closer to the car than the large one behind them.
The group were tense, not long after Wade was bitten, Steve ordered them all to go inside. The bottom floor was pretty much cleared earlier, however, Steve, Bucky and the Asgardian brothers quickly sweeper the place that was left to be checked. They moved fast and with little care to themselves. Just wanting to make sure this place was safe for them all to move around in without fear of something ambushing them at night.
He mentally kicked himself for the 100th time for not thinking to carry more weapons on him. The small pistol he had tucked into his trousers is empty and useless. The knife blunting from the continued use making it marginally harder to stab and pull his knife out quickly. Thank god for his metal arm and enhanced stamina and strength, otherwise he would have been caught ages ago.
“I want to help Steve!” Breathing heavily Tony turns to glare at the Dom, looking him right in the eye. He would not sit idly by when he could be helping. It’s not who Tony is. “I can’t sit about someplace safe while knowing you’re out there in constant danger. Not if I know I could help make things that could save you all. Give you all a better fighting chance of saving others!”
Sighing heavily, Clint nods and grumbles as he gets up to stretch, raising his hands high into the air to crack his back.
“Thank god the help arrived when it did,” he shoots at a few that he sees running away, urging them to keep going incase they were planning on stopping to keep fighting. The fight was only brief but it was enough to shock them into all remembering that its not just the dead they have to fear. This time they were lucky help arrived.
Clapping his hands together the group leave the basement, taking a few bottles with them for later. For once, things were looking good for them all. Wade looks to be handling the virus well, they have a stable (for now) home with many rooms to hide and use. Bruce and Tony have talked already a little bit about making a lab here. A place where they can tend to their wounded better.
Huffing a laugh Steve steps back to give Tony space just as Natasha come into the room, looking as alert as ever she makes a beeline for the camping stove. Once it on she starts a weak pot of coffee causing Tony to groan appreciatively at the smell.
Kicking up fallen leaves, it reaches the shiny object but the Deado misses the wire that’s hidden beneath the leaves on the ground. It’s foot presses down on a certain bit.
This i some awesome fan art by an amazing artist on tumblr! Check out their blogs, they have two one for saw and one for nsfw art! They are super chill as well.
Wade’ face was pale, practically drained of colour as he clung to Tony’s shirt. The knife having been dropped moments ago.
Fiddling with his glove, Steve seems to take a few moments to think. Most likely considering what to say, contrary to his more impulsive reactions.
Everyone in the room has practically sagged in silent relief at Wade being ok, but it leaves a big question to be answered. How was it he was able to survive?
Any other moment and Steve would be amazed by the fact that Tony had just let him touch him, without trying to break any of Steve’s bones as a result. As it was, the moment was dampened by the stress, fear and worry that was leaking from them both. The physical contact actually helped in a way to ground them. Comfort of another being there, to share the worry for Bucky. Taking a deep breathe, Steve moved to the kitchen where the others where.
“We are Romanov, I knew you all for only a few days before I was tossed from the team.” Swallowing back the sadness at that she nods a tiny bit.
Startled Steve looks at her confused, “Nat? Why we stopping? We haven’t got time to waste!” Giving him an unimpressed look, she pokes at his chest. Hard.
Nodding Sam understood Tony’s concern on this matter. Hospitals were the first to go in the beginning. The ill and infected easily succumbing to death and risen in droves. It didn’t help that many didn’t realise until it was too late that to kill the dead, properly they had to destroy the brain.
Sam and Thor had decided to take the truck with the camper van on the back to collect the group, ironically the same vehicles that they were in that started this. Clint’s dried blood still standing the footwell on the passenger side.
“How do we want to do this, we need to do a general run on the other shops as well so do we hit the medical centre or the town shops first?” Getting out of the truck they took to be able to carry everything they find, leaving the car for the others in-case of an emergency; Steve checked his gear and weapons as he directed his question to the others.
Nodding the two kids say their goodbye, Peter much more animated than Wade who’s still a bit withdrawn.
Getting out of the truck, Clint hefts a rifle into position; his bow slung across his back that he wants to use only really for stealth moments. Making his way to the other side of the camper van to keep watch for Steve, it was a blind spot that needed covering. They couldn’t afford to get careless now. The time passes silently and slowly with only the sounds of Steve searching the camper to be heard.
So much editing for ths chapter, i hope this pleases people! Just a quick note though, i used UK medical knowledge such as making a science joke partaining to paracetamol. It’s our main pain killer that you can buy in pretty much any store. I think its the equivalent to Advil in US? Correct me American readers! Anyways enjoy!
Bruce was the first surprisingly to break the fragile calm that was over the group. “So, are we leaving town?”
“I think thats a good idea,” Natasha agrees speaking softly so to not wake Peter, “We have to be careful in case they try and use us as experiments to test any serums on, if they have any anti serums, but they usually have the best defences and security.”
Even when they both didn’t know Tony was a sub, they had  both admired him from afar. His genius and drive to help those that need it. His countless donations to children charities and scholarships to give as many teens the best start in life he could. They had both loved his caring nature when away from the press, his willingness to help Bucky the moment they got wind of him. Steve would forever be grateful to the sub for his part in bringing Bucky home.
Steve huffed when all he got in return was a chuckle from Bucky, that jerk knew exactly how that affected him. Their senses were much sharper than a normal Dom’s, even without the serum though, Bucky would have been able to smell how affected Steve was by his words just now.
“What about when we have to run, you’ll just leave us behind, no... I don’t want that false sense of security...” At his words the group look at him with something akin to horror. Does he seriously believe they would leave him and his kid the moment this didn’t benefit them?!
Smiling serenely, Charles whole personality seems to bleed safe and gentle. Sam can feel all tension leaving his bones as he looks at the elder man, muscles he didn’t realise were tense are now relaxing.
Bruce and Clint had taken Wade into a separate room away from Tony and Peter, just-in-case, Wade turned. They didn’t want Peter to have to see that.
“I regret what happened, We looked for you, Pepper is really good at covering tracks. I clearly underestimated her.”
The blind lady, introduced as Al puts her food container down finally and licks her lips, trying to gather the last of the beans sauce.
The next morning, Steve, Bucky, Thor, Loki and Tony set out to the town. They had decided to wait till this morning so that they could make use of as much daylight as they could and have more time to prepare for this. Steve even double checked with Bruce about the item he had written down, face blank, Bruce confirmed that yes what he wrote was correct.
“Please don’t tell me we need the entire body? This guy looks like he’ll fall apart in our hands before we even get to the gate...”
“Natasha...” Tony hesitated briefly before visibly steeling his nerves and looks at her, “If I said the father was still alive and I knew where he was, do you think I should still tell him about Peter? Even after all these years?”
“That sounds as good as any” Steve gave Tony a shy smile, he nearly fist pumped when he saw Tony’s lips twitch before he moved to the table to check on Peter.
He’s even made a makeshift gauntlet to use on humans, just in-case, just because the world was up shit creek didn’t mean all humans would suddenly band together flawlessly to help one another. The gauntlet would administer a shock strong enough to stun a human for a few moments, long enough for him and his group to run away. Should they need to.
“Yeah!” Steve raises an eyebrow as Peter tries to speak with a full mouth, causing him to giggle and swallow before he attempts talking again. “I can show him the bamboo hut in the garden as well!”
“Logan told us what happened, I’m sorry this has happened to your group. We would all like to extend our help to your group in defending against Francis and get your friend back”
Hustling to her, Natasha smiles at the tired toddler before looking at Steve. “It’s all clear, but we did find someone, he claims to be by himself. Personally I think he’s telling the truth and he seems harmless. Wants to join our group.”
“Medical, it’s more of a priority than the other stores. The medical would have food stocked up for the patients they took in and the workers as well as equipment. As most people would avoid a potential death trap, it would make sense for them to target the smaller local stores.” Tony fiddled with his gauntlet and picked up one of his devices. That is, one of his flashing bombs that flashes when he presses a button and then explodes after a few moments. A way to check inside and to lure away the attention of possible Deado’s, it wasn’t overly powerful either at a small distance but it was enough to damage the Deado’s that get to close.
Sighing softly, Tony urged Peter up as the other car pulls up behind their car, the rest of the group joining them. He had spent the rest of yesterday in a bit of a mess after what happened at the housing construction site. When they settled for the night in the town he pulled himself together, Peter needed him to continue being strong for him.
Jumping off the back of the truck, Thor and Loki use the brute strength to pull the gates open to let the cars in. Shutting the gates loosely in case they need to make a quick escape, they jump back onto the truck to head up the long driveway that leads to the mansion.
“One strand of hair misplaced Loki…” Bucky growled quietly at Loki, a knife was twirled in his hands threateningly. Scoffing, Loki turned his back on them, already walking towards the building causing Tony to hurry after him.
Silently, Thor took out the device and passed it over once they pulled to a stop. Sam’s sharp intake of breath told Thor that Sam must have had a similar feeling as he did. Whatever is on the other side of this device, could not surely be anything good. Thor dreaded handing it over to Tony once inside.
“Let’s not forget, usually a hell of a lot of back up power sources and off the main grid in case of power outages!” Grinning Clint bounces in his seat. “God I hope that means warm showers!”
Somewhere down the street Clint hears the sounds of shooting and the yells of Steve and Sam from one of the shops.
Loki was equally as troubled but was managing to keep a perfectly blank face. However, even that in itself was just as telling.
Letting out a heavy sigh of exhaustion, Tony allows himself to fall into the last empty spot in an armchair. A hand coming up to rub at his forehead as a headache formed.
The group all nodded their assent to the plan.  The mood brightening as they work out the new plan. It may not be what they originally wanted, but it’s the best in the situation they are in.
Rhodey could see there were tear streaks that where framing her face. She was standing beside him refusing to sit.
He feels as if he doesn’t get everything out he is going to burn, boil from the inside out, his soul turned into ash, his bones charred, he has a need, a need so deep  to let go before his heart explodes and all the years of hurt and pain escape him and burn everything to the ground.
He is just doing these because he is the only one who can do it, so no point being a child, hiding his toys, disagreeing to share.
Tony needs Steve to have an answer for all of this, a reason, a reason compelling enough to make Steve wanna do this, a reason worth it for their relationship to be broken like this. He doesn’t want to carry this weight alone, he has this cardinal need of sharing this weight with Steve.
These days have been a roller-coaster for him, and he know that the days that lay ahead of him are  going to be even more difficult but he is hell bent on overcoming it.
There is a steady rhythm of beeps surrounding him, the room he is in is spacious but not too big and not too clustered, beside him is one more bed, Rhodey had recently abandoned it to sit beside tony and the wheelchair feels like it is trying to mock Tony,  he is currently eating his jello with the enthusiasm of a teen asked to sit through a family meeting, so all in all Tony would describe it as a platter of a  horrible situation with a side of irritation.
Pepper didn’t know what she did was right or not. She didn’t know if Tony would have wanted this but if there was also a slight chance that Tony could benefit from this, that tony could finally wake up then she was ready to take it.
Tony didn’t know how to respond, words failed him and he felt parched. It was overwhelming to relive the moments he lived all those years ago, to still be Steve’s centre of attention to be very much in love with the man kneeling in front of him.
“It will be good for his to be in a familiar environment and I know the Med Bay of the Avengers compound is better equipped then the hospital so I feel it will be better for him.
The picture shouldn’t have been taken in the first place , no wait that wasn’t correct he shouldn’t have put his husband in this state in the first place.
“He is going to hate you, he is going to be very angry and for a very long time, he is going to be hurt and he is going to hurt you but you need to be there for him. You have to be better, you will have to better yourself for him.” said Natasha
“Well I can try. I think you know why you are here. You aren’t just trying hard enough to remember.” said Jarvis
Steve’s head snaps up as if he is hearing his name for the first time. He tries to takes a step with all the energy he can muster, he takes a step towards Tony.
“You can’t do that alone, I mean you can but you shouldn’t. I should be there, I would…..i would help I mean….I mean you would need me and I…I could help you Tony..help you
“I think it is going to take a long time to get there, it will be a long road, but you will get there, I am sure of it. I wont tell you what to do, you always do what makes sense to you, but I will tell you this Tony forgive but don’t forget.”
“You have to understand we thought his heart was going to stop but thank god it didn’t, his baby is fine, though he did give us a scare, his chest is going to be heavily bandaged, he had multiple broken ribs, we had to stabilize him. He is unconscious right now, he does have a heavy concussion so he has to be monitored for some time. His baby needs to be monitored. As to when is he going to wake up, it is a little difficult to say given his current state.” explained the doctor
He faced the music of life with as much grace as anybody could be expected but right now he felt as someone had gutted him very badly and somehow he had failed to catalog this outcome in all that could horribly go wrong in his life.
After the initial leak of Tony’s pictures no other information had been leaked, so public didn’t know about the fight of Siberia but majority of the world knew that half of the avengers were fugitives right now and the government was being suspiciously tight lipped about their fuck up.
Tony had opened the curtains the moment he had regained the consciousness, he tells pepper he never wants to be cold again.
Pepper was beside Tony, she was holding his hand. She was talking to him, if only she could concentrate.
He sees Steve standing, unmoving body and wants to hurt him, he takes the next thing lying to him and hurls, he hurls it directly at Steve.
Jarvis laughed. He then turned his face toward tony and saw that four year old boy clutching his pant leg trying to hide his hurt after having his heartbroken for the very first time by his father.
Steve doesn’t know if he would be able to take the brunt of Tony’s gaze when he looks at him. Those hazel eyes with their look of betrayal. He doesn’t know that if and when Tony will wake up will the brunet look at him with utter contempt, betrayal, unending pity or just explicable sadness.
Tony thinks maybe it is easy to love him and leave him, he always has been secondary , secondary to his parents, secondary to his lovers, secondary to his godfather and now secondary to his husband.
Tony wanted to stay here, stay here forever in his home with Ana and Jarvis where love always flowed freely, he thought that maybe he could stay here, but deep in his heart he would know that he couldn’t stay here, just like he knew he was meant to survive, meant to go on, meant to live his life with some of the best people he knew.
“Goddamit Steve, Steve listen to me. Steve you gotta breath, you can’t work yourself into a panic attack right now. Steve? Steve listen to me.
“Tony please, just please listen to me I am sorry , I will fight for you, I won’t let you go. You are my husband Tony, my mate, you are my one in a million, you gave me a home Tony, you made me love the future, my chance and my future too, so no I won’t, I won’t let you go, you my kid I won’t let it go so easily.”
He had read somewhere that calling somebody by their name helps something, he can’t remember what, he can’t remember what is it supposed to help ,he wonders if Nat is trying to do that, trying to help with something.
One day Ana was taking out a plate of cookies from the oven when Tony in all his 3 year old  glory has finally managed to climb the stool and had shrieked on the top of his lungs and Ana had dropped all the nice cookies on the floor.
He feels for now he can anchor himself, he would take care of everything just to give his baby a chance.
He looked down he was wearing his white button down shirt and black slacks but he was barefoot,it was odd, what was he doing here? then he looked at Jarvis then really looked at him, he looked as he did all those years ago when Tony was two years old and Jarvis had carried him in his arms all day after tony had fell and scrapped his knee and refused to walk, much to his parents disapproval.
The concept of having his baby was so foreign to Tony , it made him feel so profoundly overwhelmed as if his mind was reeling to grasp the concept that he actually was going to have a baby, his own baby.
Steve enters the room, he looks defeated, sad, tired. He doesn’t look up and stands there quietly. Tony doesn’t care anymore but someone please tell that to his racing heart.
Natasha comes to visit him. She says her apology and he forgives her, he has never been good at holding grudges, has hated himself for it but at the end of the day he forgives her but doesn’t let her get close and then she leaves, she leaves and also leaves Rogers behind and he hopes that she would have taken him with herself.
If Steve was a better man then he would have left, left and never came back, never would have inflicted the pain on Tony, never would make him go through any of it and never would have inflicted his presence on Tony ever again. But he knew he was not better, maybe he wasn’t built like that or maybe he didn’t have the courage to leave and have his soul curse him daily for leaving its counterpart, to wait for the rest of his life and know that the phone call may never come. Maybe Steve Rogers was a selfish asshole.
The walls of the room was painted white and it has a wall clocking ticking away reminding of the moments fleeting away. Rhodey chuckled Tony would have hated it.
He had to be there for Tony, he had to face the consequences of his actions, he was going to do anything, anything that Tony needed just to earn his forgiveness.
“Focus Anthony, you know why you are here, you know what your mind has been thinking for the past week, you know why you wanted me here, just focus Anthony.” said Jarvis
“T…Tony please” Steve closes his eyes and balls his fist. Tony thinks Steve might draw blood from his palms if he closes his fist any tighter, Tony wants to stop him but he…he....he can’t.
“Because of all the things that you are a self-lover  is not something that you are, never have been, it did fall on your closest friends to remind you from time to time that you are human not a means to an end not just some engineer not a problem solver but a human with a beating heart. I think you were hurt pretty badly to have come to me this time.”
Since being defrosted Steve had been for a lot of stealth missions for SHIELD and then as Avengers they had tackled a lot of missions so he knew his way around and since the compound was their home for a long time, he could walk into the building blindfolded and still reach his destination, it also helped that he was a super soldier. The irony of the situation was not lost on him, trying to enter his home as a fugitive, a place where him and tony had made their little family, had so many moments together.
Tony closes his eyes, tries to sleep rest because he feels tired, so tired but as soon as he closes his eyes his brain goes into overdrive and pictures start flowing in front of his eyes. His mother, his father , his mother gasping for her breath calling out to his father, her neck, Howard…Howard with his head and then there is Steve..Steve with his shield…sitting on top of tony, his shield coming down, hitting him..hitting his arc reactor, his face …his…
