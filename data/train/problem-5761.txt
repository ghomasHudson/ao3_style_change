The fingers were rough and unforgiving when they went in and out of him and he could feel blood run down his crack when a third one was inserted. After a few seconds the fingers disappeared from him and he looked up only to see Rumlow spit down on his hand and slick himself up and then lining his cock up to enter Tony. He shoved in and didn't give the genius any time to adjust before he was pounding into him.
He stepped in, unsure of himself, and was greeted by the sight of Steve standing by the stove and cooking bacon and eggs. What really got Tony's attention was the fact he was wearing nothing but shoes and a pair of running pants that gave him a fantastic view of his ass. His eyes trailed up to his back and the genius licked his lips at the sight of those muscles rippling whenever the blonde moved to get something.
Clint had been feeling so guilty about the whole thing that it took almost a week of the team assuring him that it wasn't his fault before he snapped out of it and fought harder to find the young genius.
“F-fuck Steve. I-I'm gonna cum…”
“When he wakes up.”
Steve's face was directly in front of Tony's pink, tiny hole and he was pretty sure that he had found his happy place. Steve had always been an ass man, whether it was a male or female he could always appreciate a nice ass. But Tony's was by far the most gorgeous one he had had the pleasure of encountering so far.
“Sure thing Tones.”
Phil's eyes widened when he read the email and he slowly looked up at Steve's angry face.
Tony, Rhodey and Pepper were in Tony's room and catching up on the past year. Tony and Pepper were leaning back on the headboard of the bed while Rhodey was on the floor playing with DUM-E. Pepper had an arm wrapped around Tony's shoulders and her hand was threading through his hair while his head leaned against her shoulder.
After opening and closing his mouth a few times in an attempt to respond Tony stood up on shaking legs while wrapping the thin blanket around his battered body as much as he could to spare the woman even more distress. He limped towards the door so that he was face to face to Ana. The red headed woman reached her hands through the small window on the door and gently cupped the younger boys face while the tears she had been fighting finally escaped her eyes and ran down her cheeks.
“Those are stupid rules, I am perfectly capable of walking.”
“Ty?”
Tony looked around at his friends and saw them all glancing at each other. It was Bruce who answered him with a grim expression.
“What are you doing?”
Steve took this time to go over well the details of Tony's face, trying to soak it all in. He couldn't believe how close he had been to losing Tony and he wanted nothing more than to lock him up in a tower and wrap him up in blankets and protect him from the world.
He also learned that Steve was an artist and that his mother was from Ireland.
“But the other guy then? Rumlow? The one that, that… You know.”
Tiberius Stone smirked down on the shorter man and crossed his arms over his chest. His blue eyes raked over Tony's body and he licked his lips at the sight, the young genius was truly a sight to behold.
“Yeah, Tones. We were worried that you weren't gonna wake up, but you always did love proving people wrong.”
“Thank you pro-Charles. It was nice to finally meet you properly.”
The Avengers were all running around the mansion, yelling into various phones, doing whatever they can to find their missing genius. Natasha was fiercely spitting out insults in Russian to the man on the other end of the phone call at his failure to get the information she had asked (demanded) from him. Clint as sitting next to her while talking to his own source who had also come up with nothing.
Steve stood frozen in place, just staring at the door in front of him. He didn't notice Bucky and Bruce standing next to him, he didn't notice the doctors and nurses running around him, didn't notice the rest of the team coming in. It was like he was on autopilot when he took the new clothes from Thor and going to the bathroom so that he could change and wash away his lover's blood from his body.
He set the timer on ten minutes since the main entrance was only three minutes away.
“Let go of the boy.” Sneered the tall man in the front of the group, revealing a row of to many sharp teeth.
“I'm so sorry bambino, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry that I couldn't protect you from any of this, you deserve so much more my baby.” Tears were now streaming down both their faces and Tony sat up to his his mother, needing her comfort now more than ever. Maria in turn clutched her baby as close to her chest as she could without hurting him while steadily mumbling apologies, needing to feel him close to her, needing to know that her
After that they cried and laughed together at their memories. They talked about a brighter future, filled with happiness and love. Then Helen came in to check on him, smiling the whole time, telling him how glad she was that he was okay.
His thoughts were interrupted by Clints voice.
He took a pillow and placed it underneath Tony's hips to gain him better access before grabbing the bottle and poured some lube into his hand before slicking himself up.
Apparently Tony was also great with weapons since he had been prepared to take over his father's company his whole life. So he knew how to both build and use most weapons there was (Steve would never admit it but he thought that the image of Tony with a gun was kind of a turn on).
Steve looked at the archer with furrowed eyebrows. Clint seemed a little bit too happy with the information. Before he could ask Bucky beat him to it.
Tony peeked up from where he was hiding his face and looked directly into Steve’s eyes. Before he knew it he was out of Maria's arms and was crashing into the Captain's chest and wrapped his arms around his neck. Steves was hugging back just as tightly, his arms around Tony's waist and holding him as close as physically possible without injuring him any further. The blonde buried his face in Tony's neck, letting his scent fill his nose again, feeling like he could finally breathe again.
“If Jarvis could see the state of this kitchen he would have a heart attack”
Tony whined but soon shut up when Steve's lips were pressed hard against his own and he moaned at the taste of himself on Steve's tongue.
‘How dare Steve try to forbid me from seeing Ty!? Sure, I'm not very excited about it but it doesn't matter. Whether or not I will go should be my own decision!’ Tony thought angrily.
“Hey Tony.”
“Bucky!” Steve hissed. Bucky smiled apologetically at his childhood friend before returning his gaze back toward the distressed and now confused couple on the couch.
“Oh Tony, didn't you think that I was gonna finish what I started? Only this time you won't get away that easily. Oh, I've missed your tight ass…”
“Please don't leave me.”
The next morning Tony and Steve entered the kitchen hand in hand.
“Nah, how about we stay in here all day and I'll feed you something else?” He said with a wink.
“Coconut milk?”
He reached forward and took the cake before blowing the candle out. He and Bruce shared the cake and and drank their coffee and when Tony's phone showed him that it was 7.30 both men put on their jackets and shoes and headed out. Bruce walked over to his car and waved goodbye to Tony before he got in and drove away. Tony walked the opposite direction towards the shop. Bruce had never really told Tony what he works with, only that he was a doctor of some kind. But Tony didn't want to look a gift horse in the mouth so to say and didn't question him about it, the man had already let him into his home and Tony didn't want to risk anything by prying.
Oh! And happy (late) Easter and other holidays if you don't celebrate Easter!! (And happy early Easter for my fellow Christian orthodox's XD)
Anyways hope you like this and stay tuned for the next chapter as it is already in progress and always remember...
Tony quickly washed his face and brushed his teeth and made his way out of the bathroom.
Steve's eyes widened in realization and licked his drying lips. He watched with lust filled eyes as Tony reached behind himself and let out a long moan. Tony had two fingers pumping in and out of himself when he leaned back down and reattached his mouth to Steve’s erect cock. Steve groaned at the sight and feeling of his sweetheart sucking his cock while prepping himself, giving Steve a great view of his ass. Tony groaned a little louder but tried not to lose his rhythm when he inserted a third finger.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hey Buck, what's-” Steve didn't get to finish his question before Bucky's frantic voice filled his ear. “Woah woah woah! Slow down, I can't understand you! Are you okay? Is it Tony? Is he alright?”
“I just got off the phone with Lehnsherr,” he started while looking at his team “he had his men checking out the Stark mansion for the last couple of days to look over the security and their routines. Howard Stark has way too much faith in his technology, there are barely any security guards both outside and inside the mansion if Mr and Mrs Jarvis are correct. Does everyone know what they are supposed to do tomorrow?” A series of nods followed his question. “Good. Then I suggest that everyone gets a good night's rest tonight so that we will be prepared for the mission.”
“Tony. Bed. Now. And besides, DUM-E missed you today.”
“I am not tiny!”
Steve looked up at Bucky and nodded. The brunette smiled and aimed his gun at Rumlow who was now a shaking mess on the floor.
“You okay?”
“Take care, Tones. I mean it. And remember, if tall, blonde and handsome doesn't treat you right, I'll kick his ass.”
“How about now?”
He snapped out of his thought when Bucky placed his metal arm on his shoulder.
Bucky was the first one who spoke.
Instead of responding Steve kissed him and moved to remove his shirt which Tony happily complied with.
Fury just rolled his eyes and gave Tony his list of tasks for the day.
By now Rodney was trembling with anger and Tony had to put his hand over his to get him to look him in the eyes. There were angry tears gathering in Rhodey's eyes and he moved his grip to Tony's hand.
He slowly looked up with wide eyes only to see Howard sneering down at him with pure disgust, eyes filled with nothing but hatred.
Small chapter because I had the time and inspiration for it! Note to self, writing is a great coping mechanism.
“You mean those two gentlemen who have been going in and out of the basement that mr Stark told us to stay away from? Oh, Edwin, those two give me a bad feeling. And what could they possibly do in the basement day in and day out?” Jarvis frowned at his wife's words, not very happy at the fact that two thugs were making her feel unsafe in her own home.
After the trip to the cafe where Tony and Steve had their first date he, Pepper and Rhodey seemed to be glued to each others sides since you never saw them more than a couple of feet from each other. They had kicked Steve out of his and Tony's room for the night so the three of them could have their own little sleepover. They ate junk food and traded stories from the past year. It was a blast and Tony couldn't remember being happier than he was with his new family and his oldest friends.
“Oh…”
They all looked towards him with various expressions.
“For fucks sake Rogers, why do you have to be a constant pain in my ass?!”
“Wise choice.”
“It's okay Doll, I've got you. You're safe now, shh, it's okay. Do you wanna tell me about what happened? If you don't feel ready then it's okay, I can wait.”
Rhodey just frowned at that.
“Thank you, I hope you don't mind though. I don't know about you but I'd be a little weirded out that a guy that I have known for only a couple of days has a drawing of me.” He said with a nervous chuckle.
“He went that way,” he hurried while pointing with a shaking hand towards the hallway that Howard had disappeared with Tony “they're heading to the garage. Stark took his kid there! Pl-please don't hurt me!”
was even looking for him, if they were coming for him. Maybe Howard was right? Maybe the team was happy to get rid of him? Maybe he was nothing but a burden they had finally gotten rid of?
“Why did you stop?”
Steve just muttered something in response before tightening his grip on Tony's hand a bit and dragging the laughing genius in with him.
Brock looked at Tiberius with horror, his eyes taking in the sight of the blonde mans face swelling and covered in cuts and blossoming bruises, choking on his own blood while twitching on the floor. He forced himself to turn his gaze to the captain instead when the bigger man kneeled in front of him.
“Steve you need to calm down!”
Edwin Jarvis was never the kind of man who stuck his nose in other people's business, he preferred to just do his job and stay out of trouble. And when mr Stark had told him not to go down to the basement under any circumstances he had not thought about it much afterwards.
After a few minutes and steadily growing anxiety Tony hacked into the surveillance cameras and found a room where they must keep their weapons and explosives. An idea was quickly forming in his head.
SHORT CHAPTER!
Steve couldn't help but to flicker his eyes to the brunette’s lips which said brunette noticed. They started to slowly lean forward until there was just an inch between their lips.
At the end of his rant Tony had tears streaming down his face and he was shaking. He couldn't get a sound out, only a whimper when his father slapped him hard before dragging him out of the bathroom by his bruising arm.
“Because you emailed me yesterday, saying it was urgent.”
Comments and kudos are my fuel and are always appreciated!
Loud chatter filled the kitchen while the Avengers enjoyed their breakfast when Bruce stood up and headed to the fridge.
I hope you liked this and next chapter will hopefully be up by the end of the weekend.<3
“Slowly bambino” she reminded him as he tried to gulp the water down “take it easy or you'll just throw it all back up again.”
"Nat, stand down. I promise he won't do anything" said Bruce, looking straight at the redhead.
“He did lose a lot of blood, especially from where he had been shot and I'm afraid that his chest has been through severe trauma and that his heart is weaker than it should be and that his lung capacity has gone down around 30%.
He laid back down and curled up in a ball. Exhaustion took over and he unwillingly went to sleep, dreaming of Steve and his warm smile.
“Really?”
“What are you all looking at!? Go back to searching!”
Tony tried not to smirk at hearing the noises the Captain made while he swirled his tongue around the head of Steve's cock while sucking on it. He started to move his mouth downwards and kept licking and sucking until his face was pressed against Steve's pubic hair. When he saw that Steve was about to cum he released his length with a wet pop.
“Yes Clint” Steve snickered “we can sleep now, we have to look presentable tomorrow.”
Their tongues were battling for dominance which Steve easily won. Tony yelped when Steve’s arms slid down over his ass and stopped right under them. He was lift up and he wrapped his legs around Steve’s waist. Steve pushed the small genius against the wall and started to grind their erections together. Tony let go of Steve’s lips and threw his head back with a loud moan. Steve latched his lips against the tanned neck and started to suck, lick and bite wherever he could reach. The moans got louder and louder.
“Yes, his robot, it was his first AI, the boy is a genius. Anyway, we started talking and kind of became friends. A couple of months later I ran into him at a cafe. He had just ran away from home and was homeless, so I offered him a place to stay and recommend him to get a job at Nick’s shop.”
“Clint! Where is Tony!? I need to talk to him! He isn't answering his phone!”
“Wait, this guy is coming with us?” Asked Bucky with a smile while petting the metal claw.
“When are they coming?” He managed to crack out.
Adrenaline surged through his body and he turned around and shot the man next to Schmidt in the neck and Schmidt himself right in the chest.
“Bruce, Bruce!! Stop please!!”
They had arrived at the Hellfire club approximately fifteen minutes earlier and were led to a table where Erik Lehnsherr was already waiting for them with his second in commands/bodyguards Raven and Azazel standing on either side of him with crossed arms but not in a threatening manner. They have known each other for a while and knew that they could trust the Avengers. The club was not open yet since it was still daytime but a few workers/members of the Brotherhood were already there preparing for the eventful evening.
“You are wearing too much, love.”
“Hey, none of that. I don't mind, besides, it's my fault that you are even in this situation in the first place.” A guilty expression crossed his face and Tony own was making a confused one.
Tony kicked him in the face and let go of his human shield and dashed out the entrance, trying to avoid the spray of bullets.
“What?”
“Wait, are you trying to tell me that the kid actually built this?” Asked Steve while watching the robot claw at Bucky's metal arm.
who had taken their Tony.
“Who was that?”
“I mean, I don't need your help right now and I don't understand why you would think I would.”
Suddenly everyone's expressions turned sour and you could hear the metal in Bucky’s arm creak when he balled his hands into fists.
Steve only nodded and proceeded to take the boy into his own arms and started to run towards Bruce's lab. He pushed the door open and went right over to the examination table. Bruce's confused expression turned into one of horror when he saw who the injured person was.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Tony gave Steve a slight shove before returning to the cleaning and continuing in a comfortable silence, the only sound being when they picked something up and Clint’s whining all the way upstairs.
Anyways I hope you enjoy this chapter and stay tuned because the next chapter will be the last! (I know, I can't believe it)
“Damn it! I knew this would happen! I told you I had a bad feeling about this this morning and I'm usually right about this! Why didn't anyone listen to me!?”
Tony pouted but cuddled closer to his friends.
“Lehnsherr, you and your men go and make sure that no entrance is left unsupervised, we'll go get Tony.” Erik nodded and signaled for his men to follow him. Bucky turned to Steve who was getting up from the floor, splatters of blood on his face and shirt from when Bucky had shot Rumlow.
Instead of an answer, a sob escaped Tony's mouth and he allowed himself to break down in front of the woman who had become a mother to him. He clutched her hand like a lifeline while he let out all the pain he felt after days of torture.
“I was perfectly content with him being dead Clint. How did he even survive? I stabbed him in the neck!”
“Those are the rules Tony. And besides, you got shot in the leg, you are gonna have to sit in the chair for a while.
“Aye! We will protect you and young Anthony as if he was one of our own!” Came Thor’s booming voice.
When Tony had caught Bruce up on his situation the older man had immediately offered Tony to come stay at his place.
“If he wakes up.”
Steve looked ashamed standing in front of the woman. How could he have forgotten to tell Tony's surrogate parents that he had been taken by the people who had basically made his life a living hell? Steve bit his lower lip hard and looked down at the floor while trying to come up with an answer.
“Listen to me you good for nothing bastard. Tony is not a whore, he is not worthless, he is not anything of these things you you told him. I swear to God if you ever touch him, look at him or even breathe in his direction then I will kill you in the slowest, most painful way you could ever imagine. Now leave.”
The first thing Tony felt when he woke up was the pounding headache and the light that passed his closed eyelids did nothing to help the situation. The second thing he felt was the hand clutching his own. He groaned and tried to blink his eyes open.
Everyone was blinking at the still smiling woman except Jarvis who was just staring at his wife fondly.
Before he could reply the door to the bathroom in the small lab opened and Tony stepped out, fully dressed. He walked up to the two Avengers with a slight limp and a freshly wrapped wrist, all while looking at Steve who slowly trailed his eyes up and down the younger mans body.
Tony told him about the reason why he was up so early. He told him about his father's abuse and his mother's neglect. Steve got to know that the only good thing about the life in the mansion had been his butler Jarvis and his wife Ana that he still called and met up with whenever he could.
“No, but you were certainly thinking it.” Came the comment alongside a smirk.
“It's okay” Bucky whispered hoarsely into his ear “we'll find him, I promise. And when we do, they will all pay.”
Comments and kudos are always appreciated!! <3
"Goodnight Tony. Happy birthday"
“Oh, darling” Ana breathed softly “we figured it out after Edwin and I went to the mansion to visit you since it had been so long since we last spoke. When we arrived and, and you weren't there… We were so worried and it turned out that the group had been so busy trying to find you that they forgot to tell anyone. And we figured where you were since these two awful men kept coming down here since you disappeared.”
“Rhodey! Pepper!”
“Yeah.” Was the response added with a chuckle. Tony looked up from where his face had been pressed against Steve's neck and looked into the beautiful blue eyes. Steve smiled at Tony when an idea popped into his head. He leaned down and pressed his lips against the brunettes. Tony responded immediately and put his hand behind Steve's neck to pull him closer.
“Jarvis! Ana!”
“Tony” she started with a soft voice. “You know how much we love you and don't you ever, and I mean ever, call yourself a burden again. Howard Stark is an abusive, drunk loser who missed out on knowing an incredibly amazing son.”
“Fuck. You.” Tony breathed out. That turned out to be a mistake because Howard's reaction was to tightly grip his son's hair and forcing his head upwards so that their eyes met. Pure hatred burned in the older Stark's eyes and his face transformed into an ugly sneer.
“Sweetheart, what's wrong?”
Tony rolled his eyes and settled back on her shoulder before sighing dramatically.
“Other than that, I'd like to welcome you to our family and wish the two of you all the happiness in the world.” She let him go and then moved to Tony's bed side and dropped a kiss on his cheek before heading to the door. “I'll be right outside bambino if you need anything!” And with that she closed the door behind her.
Tony just stared at him, he didn't know what to say. What could he say, really? So he just nodded his head slowly without replying.
Heh... Heh... Please don't kill me...
Omg! School is finally out and I am free!!! (At least until August :\ )
Sure, they fought sometimes, all relationships had their ups and downs, but their fights never lasted long, and besides, the post fight sex was mind blowing. So yeah, life was great, for now.
“Well hello there
Erik just gave a small smile and a nod in return.
He snapped his head up when Natasha nudged his knee with hers and she gave him an unimpressed look.
“I…” he started slowly “I honestly don't know what to say ma'am. We have been so focused with trying to find Tony that we didn't really think about informing anyone else about… About what happens to him. I can't even begin to describe how sorry I am.”
A few days later…
“What!? Who did!?” Steve exclaimed, jumping off of the sofa while the rest of the team were rushing into the living room when they had heard his cries. He had asked to be left alone after Tony and Bucky's departure and they had respectfully left him to his thoughts. He had just started to cool off when he received Bucky’s call and now fear had replaced the anger in his body.
Then-”
“What!? No! We can't move here! What about my job!? And DUM-E and all my research!? I can't just leave it all behind just because some asshole decided to rough me up a little.” Tony was almost shouting by now.
Tony took a deep breath before looking towards the two remaining men in the room. They were smirking at him with hunger clouding their eyes. At the same time they made their way towards the now shaking boy who was still sitting on the mattress.
Even though he knew that Steve would never lay a finger on him it still brought up some bad memories of his time under his father's control, never being allowed to go out anywhere with anyone unless it was for the benefit of the company. And Steve trying to keep him from going out just hit a little close to home.
“Thor, you better not be telling me what I think it is you're telling me!”
Remember guys! I am a slut for comments and kudos!!!
He jumped slightly when a voice called out.
“No, no, my boy. Sir believes that we are currently in England visiting your aunt Peggy. Oh, you should probably call her and tell her that you are alright. She has been worried sick and even though she is in no condition to fly she he's threatened to walk here from London unless she knows for sure that you are safe.”
Steve woke up by mumbling outside his door. He looked down and saw that Tony was still fast asleep on his chest. Steve smiled down at him before concentrating on his friends voices behind the door.
Steve held Tony closer to him and kept whispering in his ears while trying to ignore the knot that kept growing in his stomach.
The redhead turned towards the direction of where the egg had come and found a pale faced Clint holding a carton of eggs in one hand and an egg in the other. He swallowed hard and lowered his arm without tearing his eyes of the Russian.
Everyone in the living room looked at each other in disbelief for a moment until Bucky shrugged and clapped Steve on the back.
Snapping back to the present, Tony looked up at her and let her wipe away the tears on his face, not even flinching when she accidently brushed the fresh bruise that Howard had left after his last visit.
We are getting close to the end of this fic. Probably around two more chapters then it's done. I... I don't know what to say...
Just as Clint was about to complain Natasha sent him a look and he shut his mouth and pouted like a six year old instead. Not even Tony complained, he knew not to talk against Natasha, the Incident of last week still gave him goosebumps. Tony looked over at Bruce who had been quiet this whole time and asked him if he was ok.
“Night, DUM-E.”
“Please never let me go.” Tony whimpered, Steve just pulled him impossibly closer and raised his head with hand. Pressing a soft kiss to the brunettes lips he looked into the whisky brown eyes he loved so much with his own wet ones.
Clint was the first one to spot the couple and he groaned into Natasha's shoulder. Tony just rolled his eyes and went up to Bruce and snatched a waffle from the plate and started to munch on it.
The memories of what had happened suddenly came rushing back and he let out a loud gasp which woke everyone up. The team was immediately in battle stance, looking for threats. Most of them let out a sigh of relief when they saw that it was only Tony and within a couple of seconds he was surrounded by his new family fretting over him. Questions flew around which only increased his headache and he shut his eyes and groaned.
“If you all would please sit down so that I could explain everything, this would go much smoother, thank you.”
Coulson just sat in front of him with a raised eyebrow.
“I can't calm down Bucky! It's been three weeks since he went missing! God knows what they have done to him!? Or maybe he is already dead in a ditch somewhere but we can't know that because we. Can't. Find. Him!”
After a minute of punches raining down on Howard Stark and they thought he'd had enough, Thor and Bucky went to rip Bruce off the now heavily bleeding man. They dragged him to the corner and blocked his view of the rest of the people.
He did, however, put away his weapon though when he saw who it was on the couch.
Please me what you want to see in the sequel in the comments, I need inspiration!
“Of course professor Xavier, it's our job to protect the citizens of this city and no civilian should ever have to be put in that position.” Steve replied with a polite smile.
He got up and went to the kitchen to get something to eat but discovered that there was no food and remembered Steve mentioning that they needed to go shopping for groceries this morning.
They reluctantly let go of each other and Rhodey and Pepper got into the car and waved goodbye Tony waved back and didn't go back into the house until the car was out of sight.
The whole incident kept replaying in his mind and he felt his breath quicken while his hands started to tremble. Realizing that he was about to have a panic attack, Tony closed his eyes and tried to stabilize his breathing like Bruce had taught him when he would get flashbacks of his father's abuse. He clenched his trembling fist and walked shakingly to the supermarket.
“I'm just making up for the night I was kicked out of our room.” He said before attaching his lips to Tony's neck and prepping it with kisses and bites. Tony let out a long moan and started to grind his erection on Steve's leg. Steve moved the other hand down to stroke Tony's member through his pants. Tony let out whimpers of pleasure before snapping himself out of his lust filled haze.
“He is my ex boyfriend. We dated a while back in MIT before I decided to run away from my dad. I came to him seeking for shelter but he just slammed the door in my face.” Tony answered, refusing to look up from the floor.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony rolled his hips and started to meet Steve's thrusts while gripping the sheets until his knuckles turned white from the pressure.
“Ok, I think it's time to get some sleep. It's been a long day and you need to rest. Doctors orders.” Said Bruce while helping him stand up.
Steve was trembling slightly when he knelt down by his lover. He stoked his large hand through Tony's curly mop of hair and turned his head to Coulson and his team.
Btw sorry if any of the Italian is wrong, it's all from google translate XD, if you find any wrongs then you're more than welcome to let me know!
He was cutting deep lines into Tony's legs while yelling at him to talk. Tony was screaming and crying but refused to talk. He tried to distract his mind by trying to solve different calculations but it wasn't working too well. Tears were streaming down his face and his throat was sore from the screaming and the bruises that Rumlow had left while strangling him with a piece of rope. Brock was avoiding hitting any major arteries so that he wouldn't bleed to death, the man knew what he was doing.
“Love, are you alright?”
In between all the moaning and panting Tony stood to think if Steve had decided to get as many sounds out of him as possible today.
Steve started to think back on the first time that Tony was taken from him. The horror, pain, anger he felt when they couldn't track him down, not knowing what was happening to him or whether or not he was even alive. And when they finally found him and the state he was in just made him feel helpless and like a failure for not being able to protect him and how determined he was to keep him safe for as long as he lived. Once again he had broken his promise and now Tony could be anywhere and having God knows what being done to him.
“It was Tiberius, he drugged Tony and drove away with him before Bucky could stop them. According to Buck there was also another man with Stone in the car. Bucky sent the registration number of the car to Phil and he and the rest of his team are most likely working on tracking it down right now.”
“No Clint” Steve said grimly from where he was standing with his arms crossed “it's not me Tony’s going out with tonight.”
Steve put him down when they reached the bedrooms and told him to get cleaned up so that they could get breakfast for real before giving him a peck on the cheek.
She just smacked his chest at that and settled so that she was laying next to him and turned off her lamp.
“Steve” he said carefully while taking a step towards his Captain “what happened?”
A little bit of violence, not very graphic though!
He learned that after they came home after the discharge they were short on money since they had barely had anything since before they went of to war and that you couldn't exactly live of the military pension. They had taken small jobs from a mob led by a man and their friend named Phil Coulson where they had met the Avengers and the rest was history.
The older couple looked at each other and felt dread once again spread through them.
Steve learned that Tony loved to build. He could fix and upgrade almost anything within technology and that he had designed a bunch of inventions himself.
“Aw, come on Tony! I'm a changed man I promise! And I can give you so much more than whoever it is you're with now and I know you miss me Tony. Why else would you have agreed to meet me, huh? I know you like playing hard to get but I mean, come on? We were good together, great in fact and I know that you want it back just as much as I do!”
Tony slowly walked towards Steve, eyes dark in arousal and he got on the bed and settled on all fours in front of him. He slowly lowered his head and started to press kisses from the blonde's chest down to the base of his groin.
Cold air hit his skin when Brock ripped of his underwear and by that point he was openly sobbing. He felt his legs being separated and cold hands, not warm like steve's, grope his ass. The sound of someone spitting cut through the groaning and the crying in the room and raw terror spread through Tony while he waited for the inevitable.
What's up!?
“Anthony Edward Stark, look at me. That is not true, not by a long shot. You were kidnapped and tortured for three weeks straight and then you freed yourself. There was bound to be consequences. Unfortunately you were the one that had to pay the price of my stupidity. I should have known better than to leave you when I knew that HYDRA was after you. It's my fault that you are tormented by nightmares each night. My fault, okay? If anything I'm not the one that deserves you. Because you are amazing Tony. You are kind, smart, beautiful, generous and so much more, I could go on for hours. I love you so much Tony and I am sorry I did this to you.”
“Oh Tony” he started while caressing the trembling boy's cheek “why are you even trying to resist? You know that it will only make it worse for you.”
Steve stood up straight with a bewildered expression and almost shouted.
He and Ty had been dating for about a year in college before Tony decided to run away from his abusive father. He had come to Ty’s apartment, seeking for shelter but the blonde had just turned his back at Tony, saying that he was just overreacting and that he needed to stop being so ungrateful and basically shut the door in the brunettes face. Tony had the cut off all types of contact with his now ex boyfriend and hadn't seen him since, at least until now that is.
Said genius couldn't contain the screams that escaped his mouth when Rumlow shoved in. Too fast. Too dry. Too much.
“Where is my hug, huh?”
“Never again baby, never.”
“TONY!!”
The whole team were in front of the doctor within a second and she needed to take a step back to avoid being run into. Questions came from every direction and she had trouble to hear anything anyone said.
“Okay Tony, we have all decided that neither you nor I are safe back home. So we have to move here for a while, I don't know how long though, where we can protect you against HYDRA. Steve, Bucky and I have already gone there and packed our things and put them in our new rooms.”
The bot just beeped and Tony gave a slight chuckle before going over to his bed where a duffle bag lied. He opened it and took out his toothbrush, a pair of clean boxers, pajama pants and an old T-Shirt before heading towards the fancy bathroom that was connected to his room, he decided to save the unpacking to the next day. The whole mansion reminded him a bit of his old house, except that this one was filled with warmth, love and family while the old one only contained coldness and loneliness if you didn't count the loving butler that had taken care of him his whole life (he made a mental note to call Jarvis when he got the chance). With the Avengers, Tony felt safe, even though he had only known them for barely a day. They had offered him protection and had opened their home to him and Bruce. In the Stark mansion he had to look over his shoulder all the time out of fear that his father would stand there, ready to beat him until he passed out for no reason at all. On the very few occasions when he saw his mother she was always holding a bottle, whether it was filled with alcohol or pills didn't even matter. She wouldn't even acknowledge him.
“HELP!!! WE NEED HELP!!!”
“Can we just go home?”
He was really hoping that Coulson had found some survivors so that he could take revenge for what they had done.
When no one made a move Natasha surged forward and started to type furiously.
And now his sweetheart was in surgery, trying to stay alive. All because Steve couldn't keep him safe.
Steve took a deep, shuddering breath before replying.
“Alzheimer.”
“You think the team heard us?”
They stood there awkwardly for a minute before Tony rolled his eyes and offered to make pancakes which resulted the team to erupt in cheers.
He had around twenty minutes until he had to start going so he sat down on the couch in the living room next to Bruce.
The shop, S.H.I.E.L.D where Tony worked opened at 8.00 and Tony got there around 7.50 just as his boss was opening up.
“What!? Three weeks!? Bruce?”
During the weeks that they had been together they had only gotten each other off by hand jobs, grinding on each other like teenagers and the occasional blow jobs. But now, on Steve's bed with the blonde on top of him and the rest of the team out on business, Tony felt like he was ready to take the next step.
If you have watched NBC's "Hannibal" you will probably remember the scene where my son Will bit off Cordell's cheek and then having his mouth/chin covered in blood, that is kind of how I imagined Tony doing it and looking afterwards. XD
Tony was on his bed, sheets spread around him and pillow on the floor. The boy was at the center of his bed curled up in a little ball with his arms covering his chest protectively. He was still asleep despite all the shaking and screaming he was letting out and when Steve stepped closer he saw tear tracks on Tony's red cheeks. He sat down on the bed and put his arms around his sweetheart and tried to soothe him.
After a while and six painful cuts later he stopped. Rumlow was staring down at the bleeding and broken figure on the ground with anger in his eyes. He delivered one last hard kick to Tony's abdomen before sneering.
This chapter is kind of short but I hope you like it anyway.
“I'm tired.”
“So Tony…” Pepper said with a smirk stretching on her lips “when did you and Steve meet, huh?”
Tony, along with the rest except Pepper and Natasha who had just raised a surprised eyebrow, we're looking at Rhodey with wide eyes and open mouths. Rhodey just shrugged and leaned back on the couch.
Natasha stopped her glare and looked around the room.
This resulted in another wave of laughter from the team and Tony and Clint just crossed their arms over their chests a with puts on their faces, though the pouts were for entirely different reasons.
“Get dressed” he sneered while Rumlow drew a gun and pointed at him “we're leaving.”
Tony and Steve had gotten closer and Tony could feel himself fall harder and faster for the older man the more time went on.
“We're all out.”
But it was pointless since he had nowhere to go because the door was still locked. Rumlow had grabbed his arms and was pinning him to the dirty mattress while Tiberius was kneeling beside him.
Jarvis and Ana immediately looked at each other.
“I don’t know what happened to your fath- Howard.” she almost whispered “He used to be the most loving husband and devoted father I had ever known, he made me fall in love with him over and over again, every day. But after a couple of years, the man I fell in love with slowly faded away. Suddenly all he cared about was his company and how much money he would make, everything ceased to matter to him, one thing at the time. He was willing to do anything, and I mean anything to succeed. I always hoped that the man I loved was still in there somewhere, I never really stop loving him until one day. That was when I turned to drugs for comfort and in turn, away from you, my love, and I pray to God that you one day can find it in your beautiful heart to forgive me for that.”
“Steve?”
“Now, I'm not going to bother you anymore as I believe that you'd rather focus on finding mr Stark but if there is anything I can do to help then please let me know.”
“I had such a strange and horrible dream dear” he began “I dreamt that Anthony had been taken by his father and was being kept in the mansion right under our noses and we didn't suspect a thing.” Anas eyes filled with sadness but before she could answer a voice spoke up from the other side of the bed.
Tony let out a breathless laugh and wiped away a lone tear from his face. The happiness that he felt turned into horror when the walkie talkie went off.
“YOU SLEPT WITH HIM!?!?”
“You're very lucky, no broken bones. Just a couple of bruised ribs, a bruised cheek and a sprained wrist. You should be completely healed within a couple of weeks.”
I know it's been a while since the last update and I'm so so sorry about that. School is almost over and then I'll hopefully be able to update much more. Hope you guys will like this!
"I honestly don't know what to say, I'm still trying to process everything that just happened. But what I would like to know is how and when you got involved with all this?" Asked Tony, looking up.
“What is it with you and threats today, Sugarplum?”
Tony startled awake and looked around him with groggy eyes, wondering what all the commotion was about.
"Good" said Steve "we should probably leave, thank you Bruce for helping Clint."
Tony tried to keep the tears back, he didn't want to give them the satisfaction to see him cry. But the pain was too great and he felt drops run from his eyes and down his cheeks. He quickly wiped them away with the back of his hand and glared at Howard.
Tony looked down in shame yet leaning into his oldest friends embraces.
Everyone followed the redheads order while welcoming Tony back on their way out along with gentle hugs and kisses. And if Bruce's hug lasted a little longer than everyone else's, nobody mentioned anything.
Quick as lightning he was straddling the younger of the two and running his hands over his body.
Tony gave a full body shudder when he came in his pants, Steve following right behind. They both held that position, panting as they tried to catch their breaths. Tony leaned forward and pressed a small kiss to Steve’s lips which he happily returned.
Steve smiled back and squeezed his hand.
“That's what I was afraid of.”
“Captain, I'll explain everything but first we need to get him patched up.”
Tony finished up and swallowed a couple of painkillers that Bruce had given him and threw his dirty clothes in the hamper on his way out. He turned off the lights and crawled into the large bed, thinking mostly of Steve and what tomorrow might hold. DUM-E beeped before settling down in the corner closest to his creator.
What he didn't know was that his whole life was about to change that day.
That did change when Bruce had assured him that he would not be living there for free, he had also been in a similar situation and understood why Tony felt like he felt.
Tony was by the door to the weapons room when he heard how the HYDRA goons went crazy on the walkie talkie and tried to pick the lock as quickly as he could with some broken fingers.
“Nothing happened. We’re okay, I just needed to talk to Bruce for a moment.”
“Oh, don't worry about your chest! We managed to get most of the shrapnel out of it and what's left is not a danger to you. Though I am sorry about that, the one who captured you didn't seem to understand that we needed you alive, well, he isn't a problem anymore if you understand what I mean.
“I am afraid that I must inform that the beast calls himself man who hurt our Anthony has escaped.”
“There is something I never thought I'd see, the great Captain Rogers, the biggest mob boss of New York, turned into a blushing mess by an eighteen year old boy he just met.”
Now they knew
Clint sat in one of the uncomfortable plastic chairs with his head resting on Natasha’s shoulder and her own head on his while she sat curled in his lap.
“Yeah kiddo it's just me, come on stay awake, let's get you out of here.” Replied the man and started to pull the genius up and practically carrying him to his car.
“Why are you still here?”
“Yeah Doll?”
Natasha was the first one to tear her eyes away and speak up, asking if Tony had told him about his time with HYDRA.
“I know, love. It's okay, you'll see them soon again. I don't think that neither Pepper or Rhodey will let you go that easily.”
Tony was walking quickly towards the cafe, trying to shake off the feelings of anger and sadness before he reached his destination. ‘Why is everyone so against me making my own decisions?!’ He thought. He was so focused on trying to calm down that he didn't notice Bucky following him only a few feet behind, carefully making sure that his friend would be alright.
“Coulson, you and your team go check for survivors! I want them alive! They are gonna pay for this!!”
What is this? An update? Dear lord I have to get better at this. I was actually almost done with this chapter a couple of weeks ago but I've had some trubble in life, I have had some pretty big fights with three of my "best" and only "friends" where they all ganged up against me even if the fights were about something petty and this Friday they "dumped" me so to say. Oh well, I guess 10-12 years of friendship doesn't mean jack shit to them... :P
“Excuse me?”
“Yeah, let's go”
The team was openly laughing now and Clint scowled before grabbing another egg and throwing it at Thor's direction. The blonde giant only ducked and it hit Bucky instead. Soon the whole room erupted in chaos and there was food flying everywhere.
“Sure, thanks Steve. Goodnight Tony.”
The man Tony was using as a shield was a few inches taller than him and not very muscular which made it easier for him to hold the man up.
“Wha- what's happening?”
“Bruce” the blonde started “I promise you that I won't hurt him like that. I really like him and I just want to make him happy. And if I ever hurt him you have my permission to do whatever you want with me.”
*opens door slightly*
“Kind off, some of us would go back to the mansion to get some food, sleep and clean up while the others were here with you. But nobody could really stay away for long. Steve here on the other hand hasn't left your side once.”
A tearing feeling spread through his lower region when two rough, spit slicked fingers showed themselves harshly into his hole. He cried out and tried to close his legs but the man standing in between them prevented him from doing so.
Ty pushed the full cup of plain black coffee towards Tony with a small smile.
Hope you liked it! Next chapter will hopefully be up soon.
A knock on the front door of the mansion snapped him out of his thoughts and he put down his coffee and headed to answer the door. He walked past the living room where the team sat and watched the new season of Sherlock (because Jesus, they had waited so long for that), not tearing their eyes away from the screen for even a second.
?” She asked, her voice raspy from all the crying she had done over the course of the three days her son had been unconscious, not once had she left his side.
Seeing his chance Tony surged forward and managed to get a hold of Howard's chin with his teeth. He ignored the cry of pain that emerged from his father and kept biting harder and harder until he felt the familiar taste of blood flooding his mouth. It wasn't until his father grabbed his injured arm that the young genius let go with a shout. He opened his eyes to see a furious Howard panting with a now bleeding chin and a piece of it hanging off. The older Stark let out a roar before he backhanded Tony which caused him to fall to the ground with a whimper.
“Wait” he said in between laughs “how come you didn't have to shower off the stench?”  he asked with a raised eyebrow. Maria just smirked before answering.
“Aw, come on Stevie, I'm just joking with ya.”
“Steve I swear, if you don't start fucking me soon I will kill you.”
“Hey, Tony man, come on! This is good, now he will pay for what he did to you.”
He knew the other man was younger than himself but he looked even younger in his sleep.
“Wait!” he shouted while running forward, his friends hot on his heels “Don't kill them, not yet anyway.” He walked closer to them and kneeled in front of the blonde one.
WARNING!!!!!
"You are gonna try and stay out of this business, and you better keep your mouth shut about all of this." Came a deep voice.
It's been a while, here is a new chapter :D
Steve's eyes refused to meet his and he spoke quietly.
The entire team visibly relaxed a bit when doctor Cho confirmed that he would at least wake up.
“I would have hired the kid anyway, he is damn brilliant when it comes to machines”
Figuring that a quick trip to the store twenty minutes away wouldn't do any harm he called out to Clint, saying that he was heading out. Clint replied with a “Yeah!”, probably not even hearing what he had said.
“Yeah” Tony croaked out “let's get to the hospital.” The last thing he remembered was Steve’s terrified gaze at him.
“I don't know Steve, I don't want to leave him without a doctor in case anything happens.”
The words caused Ty's smile to stiffen and his shoulders to tense slightly. He covered it up with a chuckle before opening his mouth.
“Oats milk?”
Walking out of the shop Tony was met with rain pouring down on him. He groaned and tightened his jacket around him and made his way home.
Suddenly the screen on his laptop went black and he cursed out loud. Within seconds the others were by his side looking at the screen with wide eyes.
They both sighed and hugged him tighter. Pepper was the one who answered him.
“I'll hold you onto that, Honeybear.”
“What are you doing here? What happened?”
*nervous laughter*
Ten seconds left…
Tony felt disappointment well up inside it and let out a quiet “oh”. He had missed his friends terribly and he had just gotten them back only to have them taken from him again so soon.
“Hah!” Charles exclaimed “you don't pay me at all.” He pressed a chaste kiss to the Germans lips and waved to the rest on his way back to the bar. Erik smiled after him before his expression turned serious again and he turned his attention back to the desperate mobsters.
“Team! These are my friends Virginia Potts, or Pepper as she goes by, super smart and her main weapons are her stilettos” he said while looking at the redhead “and James Rhodes aka Rhodey aka Honeybear, but only I am allowed to call him that. He is joining the air force after graduation.” and looked at the man next to him.
“Alright, it's settled then. This afternoon me and Bucky will go with Bruce and get their things here.”
“Good! Go there and see if you can find him!”
“Got it Cap.”
When those night terrors occurred, Steve would often find Tony either tinkering with one of his bots or in the music room in his pajamas and playing a sad tune on the piano with trembling fingers.
Shaking he laid down, closed his eyes and quickly fell asleep, letting his dreams take over.
“What are your intentions with Tony?”
“I am really sorry about this. But just so you know, if you ever hurt him, this will only be a fraction of what I'm going to do to you.”
“Pep, Rhodey, let me introduce you to the Avengers which I'm sure Ana’s already told you about. Over there is Bruce with the curls and glasses, who is also my science bro. Next to him is Natasha, who shares the ability with Pepper to be able to scare the living shit out of me and is also most likely to kill someone with her stilettos. The blonde next to her is Clint, he is an idiot.” “HEY!” “And the man with the metal arm is also a James, but he goes by Bucky. Over there is Thor aka the gentle giant” “GREETINGS!” “And this” he said while stepping closer to Steve “is Steve Rogers, he is the captain of this team and… He is also my boyfriend.”
“Nice outfit” the older scientist complemented “where are you going?”
“The Avengers, Bruce, Nat, Clint, Bucky, Thor… Steve…” he sobbed out the last name as a wave of fresh tears descended down his face.
Steve could practically feel the guilt rolling off Bruce in waves and sent him a sympathetic smile before returning his eyes to Tony's face.
Sorry for not updating for a while! I have been on vacation with my family and haven't had time to write anything but now I can! Hope you like this chapter!
“Uh, yeah ok. Let's do it!”
“It was just fine, love.” he replied “Nothing special. Except those two men who have been coming over a lot lately.” That caused Ana to sit up straight without breaking eye contact.
He squeezed Tony's hip gently with his other hand and leaned forward so that he could see his face.
Four…
“We should probably go before Steve sends a whole SWAT team for you.”
When the pants were removed, Steve was met by Tony's hard cock dripping precum on his stomach. Tony spread his legs to give Steve better access and the man settled between them. He gripped Tony's member and gave a few strokes, watching as the teen squirmed underneath him.
Without thinking, Tony stood up on the tip of his toes and pressed his lips against Steve's own.
Bruce saw his friends reaction and hushed everyone. They gathered up their chairs and sat around him but Natasha quickly stepped outside and called a nurse before she settled on Clint’s lap who wrapped his arms securely around her waist.
Steve reached for his phone and pulled up the email, showing it to Phil.
Natasha just walked over calmly and sat on the left side of his bed.
Pepper kissed the top of his head to comfort him while Rhodey stood up and started to pace back and forward in the room, DUM-E rolling after him and beeping.
Tony just shook his head and burrowed closer to the redhead. Rhodey took a deep breath and settled down on the unoccupied side of Tony and wrapped his own arm around him.
“But I can tell you all one thing, none of this is anyone's fault but HYDRA’s. If Bruce hadn't taken him in when he did Tony probably wouldn't be alive or he would be back with his father.
Bruce have a little laugh and waved it off.
, was safe and alive.
The hand was in a red cast and Steve stroked the visible fingers like it was a newborn kitten.
“Anytime, darling.”
Tony woke up the next morning from the sore feeling in his behind from the night’s activities and a full bladder. He groaned and tried to sit up from where he had been laying on Steve’s chest. The action caused Steve, who was still asleep, to also groan and tighten his grip on the boy on his chest. Tony rolled his eyes but would have snuggled closer if it didn’t feel like his bladder was about to explode. He managed to wiggle his way out of his lovers arms and limped lightly to the bathroom. When he stepped inside he let out a gasp at the sight in the mirror. He really should stop being surprised over the amount of marks Steve leaves on him after nights like these but it still does every time. He sighed and went to take care of his business and brushed his teeth afterwards. He then walked out only to find his boyfriend still asleep on their bed. Tony was thinking about waking him up with a blow job when he got a much better idea.
“Thank you, for everything.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony looked up from the drawing and towards Steve's face that was covered by a slight blush.
Everyone jumped when Bruce smashed his hand on the wall and Thor had to hold him back to stop him from harming himself any further. He managed to calm him down after a few minutes but it didn't stop the tears from running down Bruce's cheeks.
“It's fine, we're both clean. And I want to feel you, all of you.”
The silence returned for a second before Bucky threw his arms up.
Jarvis head spun so fast he was surprised he hadn't given himself a whiplash only to face the Avengers standing on the opposite side of the room. Clint, who had been the one to speak up, smiled at him apologetically.
Tony let out a watery laugh and went to hug the larger man.
The nightmares that he had gotten a short while after running away from home had come back. The beating, the stench of alcohol and the yelling that he had received from Rollins had triggered memories that he had tried so hard to forget.
“You were attacked by a member of one of our rivals, HYDRA. He beat you up pretty badly, you were lucky that Nick came when you did or who knows what could have happened. And it's also my turn to watch you. You have been out the whole day and Bruce refused to leave you without any supervision so the team decided to take turns.” Was the explanation. The memories of what had happened to get him into this state came back with force and he started shaking all over. He remembers walking to the shop, a strange man with a gun pinning him to a brick wall, questions about Steve, pain, pain, pain, a gunshot, Nick and then darkness.
"Ok, but hurry up, breakfast is getting cold!"
“Jesus Christ, Tones! Does nobody know where he is?”
“They are my friends from MIT. I've already told you about them before.”
Clint was the first one to throw his arms around her and hug her tight, soon followed by the rest of the team. Their group hug was interrupted by one of the doctors.
“I know love, I know.”
Steve leaned down to face the bloody face of Howard Stark and basically growled.
After a bit of maneuvering they had managed to fit both DUM-E and the bags in the back of their black van. Bruce gave one last glance to the apartment building before getting into the car and driving back to the mansion.
Bucky sat on the identical chair next to them with his legs spread, arms crossed and head resting on the wall behind him while he slept peacefully.
She then turned around and dragged a whining Clint with her. The team immediately started to clean up, fearing what she might do if they didn't follow her orders. Bucky was in the middle of wiping milk from the floor when he spoke up.
Brock used a hand to press his chest down and pinning him on the floor and used the other to tug Tony's pants and underwear down. He immediately started to spread the younger one’s legs so that he could settle in between them.
Tony woke up with a groan and tried to keep himself from vomiting. His ribs hurt like hell after Tiberius had gotten a little bit too excited the previous day and had beaten him until he almost passed out. Rumlow, being the sadistic bastard that he was, had waited until black spots were appearing in Tony's vision before pulling Tiberius off of him. They had then left Tony bleeding and broken and not to mention naked on the cold, hard concrete floor. Tiberius had been vicious, he had kicked and punched him all over after Tony had bit his cock when he attempted to shove it down his throat. It had sent the blonde into a fit of rage after he had checked his now bleeding genitalia and he had proceeded to beat the young genius until he was covered with blood and unable to move.
There were probably more damage to the young genius but she just swallowed and turned to Clint who was closest.
“Fury… Right, he is the one that saved me from that guy this morning. Is he a part of the mob to?” He received nods “Wait, is that why he gave me the job? Because you asked him to?”
“I don't know, can't we tell them later?”
“Why? What's wrong?”
“I'm meeting my ex.” he started “He saw me back at the supermarket and he wanted to apologize for how he treated me back when we were together, or rather how it ended between us.”
“The only one whose brains are getting blown out is yours unless you let him go.” Tony felt his whole body sag in relief at the voice. After a whole week of pure hell Steve's voice was like a blessing from above.
“Tony. You have been out for almost three weeks.”
” Bruce hissed out.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Tony!”
“I'm so sorry Doll. I promised to protect you and I just keep failing at it.”
WARNING! GRAPHIC DESCRIPTIONS OF RAPE, CHILD ABUSE AND VIOLENCE BETWEEN THE CUTS!!
Dragging the man with him while limping backwards to the exit when he noticed the blood running down his left thigh. The goon behind him must have hit him with a bullet before Tony killed him.
The rest of the Avengers agreed. Nobody would take one of theirs and live.
Hi! I'm so sorry for the delay but school just started again and I'm drowning in homework.
Tony woke up to the sound of the door opening. He immediately sat up despite the burning in his ribs and watched as Rumlow walked in with a smirk, empty handed. He swallowed hard but kept a poker face on.
“Though I must say, the previous distraction is much more preferable.”
“Don't you worry about that Steven. That terrible man got what he deserved, you just focus on taking care of that fella of yours. Oh, and by the way, I had Joshua pack up your pancakes so that you can eat them back home.”
Ty hadn't stopped staring at the brunette until he was out of sight.
The team immediately sat down and looked at her in anticipation. The doctor took a chair and sat down in front of them and started talking.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rhodey was staring suspiciously at Steve and before Tony could ask what was wrong, his friend spoke up.
“Hold on, Doll, we’re coming for ya.”
“He is not safe there anymore, neither one of you. If you wish to protect him you are gonna have to move him here where we can keep an eye on the both of you. The sooner the better.”
Tony woke up slowly and tried to sit up while fighting the nausea that was arising along with the feeling that someone had bashed his head into a wall. He pulled his knees up and put his head in between them while taking deep breaths so that he wouldn't throw up.
“I'll run down to the store and grab some.” He said while changing his pajama shorts for a pair of jeans but decided to keep Steve's shirt on. He grabbed his wallet and headed downstairs. When he passed the kitchen everyone had started to clear the table and Thor was taking care of the dishes. Steve looked up at Tony from where he had been wiping the table and and asked if he wanted company which Tony declined, as much as he loved Steve and the rest of the gang some alone time was appreciated every now and then. He grabbed his jacket and headed down to the local supermarket.
“It's amazing!”
Enjoy! :)
“Tony, can you give us a description of where you have been so far?”
Anyways I hope you guys like this last chapter and remember to leave some kudos and please comment what you thought of it/the whole fic.
Tony walked up to the desk and saw the numerous sketchbooks and loose drawings. Some were of the team, some were of places in New York and many other things. He picked up one of himself. It wasn't completely done yet but it was unmistakably him. The curly hair, the same eyes, nose, lips, everything. The drawing was very detailed, like Steve had spent hours working on this. He looked over at Steve who was already staring at him.
A few dreadful minutes later the blueprints popped up on Bruce's screen and he put it next to Steve's.
The redhead looked like she was about to explode.
When the clock turned one everyone except Clint and Tony left for Phill’s. It was an one hour drive so they had to go a little earlier to get there on time.
He started by getting DUM-E to his charging station and walked over to his closet and picked out a pair of old jeans and a dark red T-shirt. He took his clothes and went to his bathroom to change. He then picked up his hairbrush and tried to tame his wild bed head to little avail before putting it down and looked into the mirror. He was met by dark purple bags underneath his whiskey brown eyes since he hadn't slept that night, instead he had had been up until 5 a.m working on his AI before he passed out from exhaustion. He had been so close to finish it that he hadn't even thought about sleep.
This time when Steve woke up it was because Tony was drawing patterns on his chest with his finger. He wasn't looking at Steve's face as he had his full attention on the invisible doodles. He looked up when he felt the blonde's gaze on his face. For a minute they just laid there and looked at each other until Tony broke the stare by putting his head on Steve's chest. Steve looked down on the genius in his arms and frowned.
The Avengers all stood up, bid their goodbyes and started to leave. Tony noticed Clint wrapping his good arm around Natasha's waist on their way out.
Steve haven't felt this kind of anger and worry since Bucky lost his arm and Steve had to wait with him for hours and keep him from bleeding to death while waiting for rescue.
Tony turned his head around and threw up his breakfast which only worsened the pain in his body. Though it didn't stop him from struggling weakly when he felt hands on his shoulders.
Tony desperately tried to break free from the harsh grasp but was unable to do so since the man on him was much larger and not to mention stronger. Tears were streaming down his face as he tried to fight to no avail. He could see the frustration that was burning in Tiberius eyes while he proceeded to rip Tony's shirt in half.
What had happened to their Anthony?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The doctor only shrugged his shoulders with a small frown. There was no point in lying to Bucky, he would just see straight through the it. The man just squeezed his shoulder and gave a small encouraging smile and lead Bruce through the building and into the elevator.
The last Tony remembered before passing out is being tossed into the back of a black van and Bucky screaming his name accompanied by the sound of gunshots
The brunette's arms couldn't hold him up any longer so he laid down while his ass stayed in the air. Steve groaned at the sight and set a faster pace and changed his angle to one one that had Tony seeing stars.
“I'll be back tomorrow you little shit and you better talk.”
Please don't hate me! XD
Bruce was blushing and Thor was grinning largely.
Before thinking about the consequences he managed to get access to one of the largest ones and calculated how long it would take for him to get out of the building and to a safe distance in his condition before the building blew sky high.
Bambino- baby
"So, now what?" Tony asked unsurely and fighting the urge to look back to Steve, despite feeling the blonde's eyes burning holes into the side of his head.
“It's okay Steve, we’re okay now, we will be okay.” Tony comforted him and for the first time in a week, he actually believed his own words.
He blacked out for a second before feeling the sharp pain in his chest and brought his hand up to touch it. His hand was covered in blood when he brought it back and the ringing in his ears was getting louder. Suddenly blurry figures started to appear in front of him and that's when he finally passed out.
“Nothing would make me happier than to take you out on a date.” He said seriously.
The idea must have been that they would have been able to set of the explosions directly from the HYDRA base.
“Yeah, Clint, I'm fine”
Around six more agents showed up blocking the hallway he had come through. He was trapped from both ways and Schmidt chuckled darkly.
That received him a slap on the back on his head and a nasty glare from Natasha. He yelped and rubbed the spot where she had hit him while pouting like a child.
“I'm sorry J.”
He finished quickly in the stall to get away from the smell and went to wash his hands.
Tony looked around the room, noticing that all eyes were on him and that everyone were tense, like they were waiting to attack. He averted his eyes and looked right at Bruce who wore a guilty and worried expression. He sighed and dragged his hand through his hair.
Tony beamed and pressed a quick kiss to Steve lips before getting up and getting dressed in his black pajama shorts and one of Steve's large red T-Shirts. Steve himself put on a pair of grey sweatpants and a black muscle shirt. They liked their hands together and made their way downstairs to the kitchen where the smell of waffles was oozing out. The whole team were settled around the table and were waiting for the waffles that were still being cooked by Bruce. Bruce stood by the stove and tried to ignore the whining of his teammates telling him that they were hungry while cooking waffles and wearing a green apron that said ‘SMASH’, a Christmas present from Bucky.
Various expressions of hope and relief showed on his teammates faces at the information. Erik Lehnsherr and his mob was almost as powerful as the Avengers and had a lot of contacts, powerful ones, all over the world. If there was anyone who would be able to help them it was him. Especially since they knew how Steve was feeling. Only a few months before Tony came into their lives Erik came to them for help. His own lover, Charles Xavier who at the time just finished his studies in genetics at Oxford and moved to New York to become a professor, had been kidnapped himself by a rival mob and had been held for ransom. Erik had come asking for help to find his lover and the Avengers had done everything in their power to save Charles. The mission had been a success and soon enough the young professor had been back in his lovers protective arms. Ever since that there had been a silent understanding and cooperation between the two mobs. They didn't try to invade the other's territories and if there was a threat against either one of the mobs the other one would help without being asked.
Everyone groaned and Tony stood up and headed towards his and Steve's bedroom to get changed.
“It's okay Bruce. We're all worried and gonna say things we don't mean. Tony is one of us now and we protect our own.”
He was only met by silence, but he just grinned and walked over to Tony who just tried to scoot further away from his tormentor. Brock let out a little laugh before gripping the teens arm hard and practically threw him across the room.
“Hey, it's not your fault. You didn't know that my dad would be following us like a crazy stalker and attack me in a toilet stall.”
How dare anyone put a hand on his sweetheart? How dare anyone harm a single hair on his beautiful head?
“RHODEY!”
Natasha turned back to the computer and kept typing.
“It's Rumlow.”
Tony took a hesitant step towards his friend and put a hand on his shoulder.
“It's yours if you want it.”
“That was for dropping out of school without a word, that was for not calling us, that was for not letting us know that you had been kidnapped, tortured and fucking raped! Six months ago! We had to find out from Mrs Jarvis! We were worried sick! We tried to call you but you had changed your number! We dropped everything to get here the second Ana told us where you were! What were you thinking!?”
A little cliffhanger XD
Kudos and comments are always appreciated! <3
“Steve please! P- please I'm ready! Ah- fuck me!”
“Brucie, you should know better than to bullshit me, man” was the reply.
Tony chuckled and leaned against the other male.
“Yup.”
“Disappear. Your car was right behind us but when I looked back you weren't there and I thought something happened and I called and you didn't pick up and I freaked out and-”
“Well, us preparing breakfast before getting distracted, ruining the food and then going out for pancakes.”
“Care to tell me why you are here?”
“How are you feeling, darling?”
Comments and kudos are always appreciated! <3
Tony did as he was told when Rumlow turned off the safety of the weapon and hesitantly moved towards the door when Tiberius grabbed his arm and harshly pulled him along the three men. Too weak to fight after basically being starved and dehydrated for a week Tony had no choice but to follow to avoid falling over. His head was spinning and each step felt like a struggle but he kept walking.
“Oh, uh, right, sorry Bruce.. I-it's just that, uh Tony-”
“What are you talking about,
It had been a few weeks since Tony and Steve had their first date and it had been great so far. He had gotten to know the other Avengers, like that Thor had an adopted brother that used to be a part of them but had betrayed the group and then mysteriously disappeared.
Tony threw his head back and his vision whited out while he came hard, untouched. White, hot strips of semen coated his stomach and he went limp.
His head shot up a minute after when he heard someone clearing their throat.
Steve smiled warmly and kissed Tony deeply before replying.
Tony turned his head around so fast that Steve was worried that he would break his neck. Tony looked at the British man and woman by the kitchen door who both wore an aprons with wide eyes and mouth agape. Tony basically flew out of his chair and into their arms with tears welling up in his eyes.
And with that, the Avengers went into their separate rooms to sleep despite knowing that they were all to tense to truly be able to sleep.
“Don't worry pretty boy!” he called out over his shoulders “We'll be back tomorrow and we are gonna have so much fun!”
“My name is Johann Schmidt. Welcome to HYDRA.”
He knew he was being a bit irrational and that Steve just wanted the best for him but he was perfectly capable of making his own decisions. The reason Tony got so worked up on it was because it reminded him too much of Howard.
“What?”
Doctor Cho took a look at the group of people and was again reminded of why this was the worst part of her job. Delivering bad news about someone's loved one never got easier.
“What?” Thor said “Is there something that you are aware of that could contribute to the rescue of our dear friend?”
Tony was pulled into a hug the second he stepped out of the car. He looked up at Steve with confusion but hugged back anyway.
Steve looked up with a perfect bitch face and Tony couldn't help but to let out a loud laugh. Steve's expression morphed into a smile and before Tony knew it lips were placed on his own and their tongues were wrestling for dominance. Steve easily won that battle and he had Tony moaning against his mouth. Tony separated their lips briefly to remove Steve's own shirt. They went back to kissing and feeling each other up. Steve started to tug at Tony's pants while moving his lips away from the other man's own and started to suck at the spot underneath the ear that he knew drove Tony crazy.
“This is great and all, really cute reunion. But I'm really hungry now and like Tony said, it smells like heaven, so if we could, you know, hurry this along it would be great.”
Squeezing his hand, she placed a soft but firm kiss on his knuckles and slowly closed the small window and hurried back to her job.
Steve trailed one of his hands down to Tony's erection and started to jack him off. Tony moaned so loud that Steve was pretty sure that the whole house heard them and he loved it.
Steve started to see red but before he could punish this monster Bruce beat him to it.
“I didn't tell them anything I swear.”
“Next time” Tiberius started with a glint in his eyes “I get to fuck him. You have to try his mouth anyway, it's glorious.” Brock laughed out a “sure” while he punched in the code to the door, careful to hide it from the nearly unconscious teen.
They stood like that for a few minutes before Steve led his lover back in and they sat down on the couch in the living room and cuddled. Steve gently kissed Tony's forehead and reached for a blanket to cover them both with.
After about fifteen minutes they heard loud voices in the hallway and looked at each other with knowing smiles on their faces. Suddenly the door slammed open and the Avengers were tumbling into the room, followed by Ana and Jarvis. They immediately stopped when they saw Tony awake and both he and his mother were looking at them with amused smiles. Suddenly Tony was surrounded by his family, all shooting questions at him at the same time but all the noise faded out when saw Steve. To say that the blonde was a mess was an understatement. He looked exhausted and had deep bags underneath his eyes, his chins had some small fresh cuts on them along with some shaving foam hind his ear, like he had shaved in a hurry and didn't bother to be careful. His hair was a mess, he had not even tried to style it after his shower, like he just wanted to get clean as fast as possible to get back to his lover. Steve was wearing an old pair of blue jeans along with a black T-shirt and a jacket over.
Tony sighed in relief and thanked everything there was for this. He went straight to the closest one and turned it on. He wasted no time in hacking through it and within a few minutes he was online. He gave a little whoop before making contact.
“Oh Anthony…” She sighed while bringing her hand down from his hair and cupped his cheek “I stopped loving him the second he put a hand on you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He had been so busy the past year that it never occurred to him to call his friends. He remembered how he had been on his way back to his dorm room after the last class of the day and finding his dad's driver by his door. Tony was seventeen and had been working on getting his third Ph.D. at MIT when his dad decided that he wanted his personal punching bag back. He hadn't gotten the chance to say goodbye to Pepper or Rhodey and when he had gotten back to Manhattan he had been greeted with a beating and an order to cut every possible tie with his friends.
Phil had become strangely protective over the young genius during the year after the last kidnapping had occurred. He had come over to the mansion a lot and he and Tony had bonded quite a bit during that time and now Tony considered him a bit of a father figure. Not that he would ever admit it to anyone other than Steve which he had to on a few occasions where his boyfriend would get a tad bit jealous when they spent a lot of time together and felt a bit excluded.
After Fury’s had explained what had happened there was a thick silence. The silence was eventually cut by Natasha.
Tony settled on the couch in between Rhodey and Steve who was still holding his hand.
“I take it you had fun while we were gone.”
Otherwise enjoy!
“Tony, what are you doing?”
Just before he passed out he heard a faint voice in the distance.
“You were right boss, he's with Rogers.”
He sat down on the couch next to Clint who had his arm around Natasha's shoulders.
What can I say? I'm Cherik trash.
“What happened? Tony, who are they?”
“What do you want it to be?”
Steve licked Tony's bottom lip, asking for entrance.
Jarvis just chuckled before a grim expression took over his face and he put a protective arm around the teens shoulders.
When the Avengers returned to their home they were already discussing on how to save Tony and Bucky was on the phone with Phil to inform him about Tony's whereabouts and to prepare his own team. All chatter did stop when they noticed something. Someone was in their house. They all went quietly inside while drawing their weapons when they heard voices from the living room. Steve, who was in the front of them all made a silencing motion and quietly sneaked into the living room, the team right behind him.
“Tiberius! I think he drugged Tony, he was basically unconscious when he dragged him out! He threw him in the car with someone else in and they drove away, I tried to stop them Stevie I really did, I'm sorry, I'm so fucking sorry! This is my fault!” Tears were now streaming down Bucky’s face and he was furiously wiping them away with his prosthetics. He would never forget what had happened the last time Tony was kidnapped and he was terrified of what would happen this time around.
BAM BAM BAM!!!! What do you think will happen next? I'd love to hear your opinions in the comments! <3
“Come on, I know he's pretty but we got to go. The boss said only one hour and we have been here for almost two.” Brock nodded and slapped the teens ass on his way and headed towards the door with the blond man.
So Tony had moved into Bruce's small apartment and managed to get a job at an auto shop that paid fairly well and he had managed to get a schedule that allowed him the time to finish his college degree online. These days on his free time Tony spent most of it programming his AI that he had named JARVIS after his father figure.
I'm so sorry for the long wait guys!! It's just that my depression has been hitting me harder than usual and I've just had such a hard time trying to write and finding motivation. But thank you all for reading this and having the patience to wait for updates! <3
“Night Bruce”
Steve was on day three with barely any sleep and was basically running on coffee now, the rest of the team didn't look much better. Though he, Bruce and Clint looked the worst since they had been up the longest. Bruce for the love and devotion he felt for Tony, Clint for the guilt of not having kept a closer eye on the kid and Steve for his own love for the young genius. He missed the feeling of holding Tony in his arms, the sound of his laugh, of the adorable faces he made but denied and he felt like he was slowly dying the longer time went on without his sweetheart by his side.
The explosion went off and sent Tony flying forward before landing on the cold, hard ground. Before Tony's world went dark he used the last of his strength to turn around to see the HYDRA facility in flames. He let out a watery laugh and felt tears well up in his eyes. The adrenaline that had kept him going slowly melted away and he laid his head down on the ground and closed his eyes.
“Yes, please, just fuck me!”
“Oh yes.”
“Yes dear?” Maria said as she combed her hand through his dark curls.
Tony couldn't help it, seeing what could easily be described as his worst nightmare in front of him and being completely alone. He screamed.
Natasha turned her head to Bruce.
When they had reached the location where they thought Tony was it was obvious what had happened. Cars were burning, windows to shops have been destroyed and people were in hysterics as police, firefighters and ambulances were all around the place, trying to help.
Steve turned around and what he saw broke his heart all over again. Tony stood there in one of Steve's to large shirts with his hair tousled and his arms wrapped around himself. His face was turning pale and he was trembling slightly. His eyes were wide open and they were filled with fear and tears were welling up in them.
The young genius had at first refused the offer, not wanting the pity.
Tony muttered for himself while going through the computers. He quickly memorized the blueprints and searched for something that might help him.
How dare these scumbags hurt what's his!? He hoped that Phil would find some survivors so that he could make them pay.
“You like that Cap? You like having me grinding down on you like a little slut? Want me to ride you?”
Tony just chuckled and stood on his toes to kiss the corner of Steve's mouth.
“When are you gonna stop being so stupid?” She replied without looking up from the newspaper.
This chapter is basically just fluff with some surprise characters!
Alright, here it is! New chapter and I hope you guys like it.
Steve's breath hitched and he rolled them over so that he was leaning over Tony. He went down and threw the brunettes legs over his shoulders and spread his cheeks with his hands.
Tony just rolled his eyes and stepped out of Steve's embrace.
Sighing, Tony stepped out of the shower and grabbed his towel to dry off and wrapped it around his waist. He stepped out of the bathroom and was both a little relieved and a little disappointed that he was alone. He was sure that Steve would have come up and tried to talk to him but he was also a bit glad that the older could sense that he needed some privacy to cool off before approaching.
“O-okay,” Tony stuttered, not liking the thought of being left alone again but not wanting Ana to get in trouble “hurry, before he finds out that you have been here.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“And I'll see you again tomorrow Tony.”
Steve nodded his head with a small smile and started to remove his lover's shirt. He latched on the right nipple and started to suck, lick and bite on it while playing with the other with his hand.
He finished the sentence and quickly wiped away the few tears that had managed to escape his eyes. Immediately he felt large arms wrap around him and looked up to see Steve stare down at him with sadness and adoration in his eyes.
If it had been any other day Tony might now have reacted like that, but seeing Ty had stirred up some old memories that he'd rather not think about.
“Alright” Tony said while slowly standing up with Natasha helping to steady him. “Let's face the music.”
“But why did he run away from home and why were you so quick to offer him a place to stay?”
Just as Tony was about to protest Natasha beat him to it.
Kudos and comments are always appreciated<3
“Yeah, thanks.”
He was immediately greeted by an enthusiastic DUM-E that beeped and twirled around him. Tony petted the claw.
After a minute of silence Tony took a deep breath and looked up at Steve who was already staring at him.
The all too familiar sound of a slap echoed through the room and Natasha was staring at her boyfriend in annoyance while he rubbed the back of his head.
“Are you sure, Doll?”
“Ok guys, I got a mail from Coulson yesterday, saying that he needs us to come by his place this afternoon, but Tony won't be able to come with us, so one of us is going to have to stay with him. Anyone volunteer?”
“How about some toast instead?”
Oops, cliffhanger XD...
“Actually I'm meeting him this afternoon for some coffee. He said he wanted to apologize for the way he treated me before.”
“You okay, Doll?”
Tony stared wide eyed at the woman who had basically raised him.
“Good morning Doll! Did you sleep well?”
After a few minutes of silence Bruce looked up from Tony's face to meet Steve's eyes.
Steve put one arm across Tony's chest and pulled him backwards so that his back was pressed against Steve's chest. Tony turned his head to meet Steve in a sloppy kiss and dragged his hand through the blonde hair while said blonde kept rocking into him slowly.
When he had been on the run for about a week he ran into Bruce in a coffee shop where they proceeded to reconnect. Tony had met Bruce a couple of months before at a science convention where Tony had been presenting his first AI DUM-E and had immediately caught Bruce's attention. Bruce had come forward and talked with him after the presentation and they had bonded over their love for science and became fast friends despite the age difference.
“Steve…”
“I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. This past year has been a mess and I forgot to contact you and I feel terrible, I'm a terrible friend and I don't deserve you. Howard is right, I'm such a burden, I-”
“Tony!! What the hell happened Cap!” Shouted the doctor while starting to check his unconscious friend.
“I love you too, more than you could ever imagine.”
He was one again so distracted by his thoughts that he didn't notice Bucky returning until his friend put a comforting hand on his shoulder. Steve looked up at the brunette to find grey blue eyes looking right back at him, he didn't even have to say anything before Bucky's arms were wrapped around him and Steve's face buried in the crook of his best friends neck, tears now running freely down his face.
“Crap, Buck, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. This isn't your fault. I shouldn't have said that.”
That was the last thing Tony heard before he fell into a deep sleep, feeling safer now than ever in his boyfriends arms and knowing that his new family were right outside the door, keeping them safe
Next chapter should be up sometime this week and there will be a surprise character!
Tony slowly leaned out of Steve's hand and took a deep breath.
Thor on the other hand was on the floor snoring loudly with his head on Bucky's lap which was now covered in the blondes drool. Tony gave a quiet little laugh at the sight but stopped abruptly by the pain in his ribs. He looked to his left where Bruce was sleeping with his head on the bed Tony was laying in with his salt and pepper curls covering his face. The little genius turned his head and smiled at what he saw.
“Goodnight Tony, sweet dreams.” The blond didn't think but leaned down and pressed a chaste kiss to the Tony's cheek and started to walk back to the others, leaving Tony blushing madly.
IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO READ SUCH CONTENT THEN AND IS EASILY TRIGGERED THEN I RECOMEND YOU TO NOT READ THIS CHAPTER AS IT DOES NOT HAVE A MAJOR INFLUENCE ON THE REST OF THE STORY.
"I'm really sorry Tony, I didn't want you to get involved in any of this. I just wanted to keep you safe."
“Steve come on, let's go downstairs! I'm starving and it smells like Bruce's waffles.”
Tony sighed before replying with a “fine”. The brunette grabbed his basket and headed towards the cash register to pay for his milk and quickly walked back to the mansion.
“Damn you for knowing my biggest weakness.”
And why we are here, well, we want to know what you have to do with the Captain and his Avengers.”
Steve hung up his phone and sped up the car.
Steve swallowed hard and nodded his head. He helped Thor carry Tony while Bruce made sure that they held him right so that he wouldn't be damaged further. Steve tossed the keys to Bucky and told him that he'd have to drive while he settled in the backseat with Bruce and Tony in between them. He held Tony's head between his legs so that his neck wouldn't move in case it was damaged while Bruce tried to stop the bleeding on his leg from the bullet hole.
“Oh, I was just in the area you know and then I saw you pass by and decided that it was a good time to catch up. So how you been Tones?”
Tony smirked and went up to suck a mark right below Steve's right ear before whispering with a low voice.
“There is a basement near mister Stark's office that he suddenly forbid us from going anywhere near about a week ago. There has also been two men coming down there regularly during that time. That must be where he is keeping Anthony!”
The sound of fighting and gun shots got closer and closer and Howard led the four of them to the general direction of the garage. Before they could reach the main hall they were stopped by a group of four men that he did not recognize but because of the horrified expressions on his tormentors faces made him relieved to see.
WARNINGS! VIOLENCE, PAST CHILD ABUSE, OFFENSIVE LANGUAGE
Kinda short chapter.
“Oh Clint” said Bruce with a chuckle “Tony was in a possession of several computers. The damage he can cause is with only that is very great. Once he almost blew up the entire apartment building with only a toaster and a couple of tools.”
When he managed to get to the entrance he had about four minutes left since in his panic managed to get lost before he found his way again.
“Now?”
The team laughed at that but didn't stop cleaning. Suddenly Tony was next to a cleaning Steve.
Alright guys... This is it. The last chapter of this story. I can't believe it, I've worked with this fic for over two years now I think and now I'm just, done? I also think this is one of the longest chapters I have ever written (almost 3000 words), I know it's a little for many great authors out there but for me it's huge.
The scientist had Howard on the floor and was punching him like there was no tomorrow.
Bruce looked them over and took in their flushed faces and Steve's arm wrapped around Tony's waist just as the other Avengers came out the door to see what all the commotion was about. The older scientists face turned red but not from embarrassment, but from anger.
This is a very short chapter and it's basically just some angst and fluff.
“You're tiny and need to be protected, Pepper agrees.”
“Alright guys!” Natasha's voice could be heard throughout the room and everyone immediately shut up “Let's give these love birds some space, everyone come with me, I need coffee. And Bruce, you're coming with me and Clint later, we're gonna pick up Rhodey and Pepper from the airport. They haven't stopped calling since we told them.”
Rumlow, who had now recovered, was running his hands over Tony's thighs, hips and his sides. Tony, still dizzy from the blow to his head, weakly tried to push him off while groaning. Brock only chuckled and gripped his chin and forcing his head up.
“You sure?”
“Mr Stark told me that they are working on a very sensitive project and are under no circumstances to be disturbed. But if it bothers you so, my love, I would gladly speak to mr Stark about it?” He offered.
“What do you want Tony, tell me what you want me to do. Do you want me to fuck that pretty ass of yours? Pound you so hard that you'll be able to feel me for days? So that the whole team will know exactly what happened?”
“Ana?” Tony rasped out, his voice sore from screaming so much. Was he hallucinating? Had he finally lost his mind? Because there would be no way that she would know that he was down here if Howard hadn't wanted her to.
“Alright, here is your room. Mine is just across from yours and Bruce is to your left and the others are just down the hallway. If you ever need anything don't hesitate to knock, alright Doll?”
"Mr Jarvis told me last week." said Bruce and held out the cake.
Steve froze for a moment before kissing back and wrapping his arms around Tony's waist who wrapped his own around Steve’s neck in return.
Sooooo... Sequel anyone?
“Yeah, that was pretty shitty of me wasn't it?” He proceeded to grab Tony's trembling hand in his before the genius snatched it back. Ty gave a little glare before continuing. “I want to apologize to you Tones, I miss you, I want to make it up to you. What do you say?”
The nurse came in with doctor Cho who started to examine him and replaced his IV drops. She left shortly after Bruce assured her that he would explain the extent of Tony's injuries and make sure he didn't hurt himself further.
He wondered if the team, if
After calming Tony down they were both so exhausted that they just curled up together and fell asleep on Tony's bed, like every night. Tony slept better when he knew that Steve was there to keep him safe and Steve felt better knowing that his fella was safe with him.
After a while he felt that the food in his stomach was gonna stay in place and that his head wasn't gonna explode he lifted his head and started to take in his surroundings. He was sitting on a simple white madrasse that had a red blanket on in a dark room that contained a simple lamp in the ceiling, a small faucet that was slowly dripping water and a door with a tiny opening on.
Tony moaned into Steve's lips as he kept rolling his hips down, his and Steve's clothed erections grinding against each other.
Heart pounding in his chest he kept going, not giving the bodies a second thought beside quickly grabbing one of their guns and put it in his belt.
“Oh mama” he raised his hand to wipe away the tears of her face “I forgave you years ago.” Maria let out a strangled sob and clutched Tony's hand, placing little kisses on it.
Bruce started to get up and gestured to Steve and Bucky to follow him. He made sure to stop by the room where Tony was resting just to check up on the sleeping genius. With a heavy heart he told his two friends to wait for him there while he went upstairs to prepare the rooms that they would be staying in.
“What do you want Ty? You got me here and can you just say what you want to say so that we can move on with our lives? Because I've had a shitty day and I just want to go home and rest.”
For once my wifi wasn't shitty so I took advantage of the moment and updated!
“Tony. Who was it? Who attacked you? I swear to God when I find those bastards who hurt there will be hell to pay.”
He felt a hand weakly gripping his ankle and looked down at Schmidt whose chest was covered in blood and had blood coming out of his mouth. The man was glaring up at him and sneered.
"Over there we have Thor, next to him is Bucky, aka the Winter Soldier" Tony looked towards the big blond man and the handsome brunette next to him with what looked like a metal arm, oh, what Tony wouldn't to get a closer look on that.
Steve couldn't help but to bust out laughing at that.
Rumlow snapped out of it when Stone put a hand on his shoulder.
The idea was that once the large on went off it would trigger the other ones as well.
“Fucking pathetic, can't even take a slap like a man! Stark men are made of iron, but you, you're nothing more than a worthless little boy that can't do anything right! You're a disgrace to our name and I regret not making your mother have an abortion the second she found out that she was having you! Nobody loves you, not even your precious Avengers, he'll they're probably grateful that they don't have to put up with your crap anymore.”
He was panting while he tried to get his shaking hands to dial Steve's number. He had tried to run after the van that Tiberius and another man had had thrown a seemingly unconscious Tony in and then sped away. He pressed the call button and held it to his ear while pacing back and forward. It rang three times before Steve picked up.
“That was my aunt Peggy. She and uncle Danny live in London and since Jarvis told her what happened she has been calling me everyday to make sure I'm fine. They would have come here if they could but aunt Peggy is in no condition to travel that far.”
“N-night. Oh and Steve?”
Bruce immediately went to track the signal down, heart beating fast and both relief and worry rushed through his body.
They reached the mansion after fifteen minutes and headed inside. Tony was met by a huge banner hanging over the front door covered in glitter and spelling “WELCOME HOME ANTHONY!!” in different colors.
With the thought in mind he headed towards his and Ana's room where his beautiful wife was peacefully reading on their bed in her pajamas. He couldn't help but smile when he saw her concentrated expression when she pushed her glasses up from where they had slipped down on her nose while keeping her attention on the book, one he recognized as a birthday present from Anthony. He smiled at the thought of his boy and stepped into the bedroom.
“Thanks Ana… Wait, if you have been here the whole time, does that mean that Howard knows I'm here!?”
“You heard me. What are your intentions with Tony? Because I swear to God Rogers, I don't give a damn about how powerful or dangerous you are. If you hurt him, I will hunt you down and I will rip your spine out through your ass and beat your cold, dead body with it. Or worse, I'll send Pepper on you and help her bury the body.”
Steve laughed at the statement before getting to work. He rolled Tony over so that he was on all fours before opening the bottle and coating his fingers with the substance.
------------------------------------------------------
It had been three weeks since his kidnapping and he was slowly starting to lose hope that the team would ever find him. Each night he would dream about the days with the team, the times he and Bruce would spend in the lab, the nights he would be wrapped safely in Steve's arms. This was his only comfort and each time he woke up he would feel his heart break more and more and tears stream down his face. He would also try to figure out ways to escape this hell hole and had gotten some ideas of what he could do.
“A few more days in here will do you good.” Howard spat out “Then, you are gonna clean up, put a smile on your face and represent Stark Industries like you were born to do. I will not let you drag my name through the mud anymore, do you understand that? Ad don't think for a second that your Captain will come for you, because he won't. Who on earth would ever want something as ugly and broken as you? You should feel grateful that I chose to give you a second chance, I might as well could have simply given you to Stone and Rumlow rather than letting them play with you here.” Tony paled at the mere thought of being given to the two rapists. Here he knew that they couldn't do any permanent damage since Howard wanted him to represent Stark Industries, to be the face out. But if they had gotten him without any restraints there were no guaranties of what they would do to him. He shuddered and backed away from Howard as much as his damaged body could manage. Howard simply smirked at him and walked towards the door.
“He was attacked by Jack Rollins, one of Schmidt's men” came Fury’s grim voice from the door. “He was asking him how he knew Rogers”
He started to walk out of the cafe on swaying legs but had to stop after a few steps to lean against the wall for support. Suddenly there were arms around him along with Ty's familiar cologne that he had once loved so much.
*hides under bed*
Tony took a few seconds to process what he had just done before pushing Brock off of him. He pulled his pants up and winces at the pain in his behind and then started to search the dead man for things he could use. He started by removing the plain black T- shirt and putting on himself before he grabbed the keys on his belt, the gun that Rumlow had been carrying and checked it for ammo and also took the walkie talkie. He stood up and stared at the dead man and felt both relief and anxiety. He shuddered and started to limp slightly to the door before using the keys to unlock it and poked his head out to see if there was anyone there. The hallway was empty and he stepped outside and cocked the gun before locking the door behind him, hoping that nobody would open and realize that he was missing.
“You ready?”
The old lady just scoffed and rolled her eyes playfully.
He let out a happy sigh at the smell and started to eat as well as he could with a cast on.
He barely even noticed Clint putting his hands on his arms when he came out and leading him to the waiting room and sitting him down.
Tony stood there with tears still streaming down his cheeks and a hand shaped bruise started to form on the left one. He had an identical bruise forming around his arm that he held Steve's shirt with and he looked like someone had just killed his puppy.
They both laughed because they were pretty sure that Steve would do something like that.
“Tony is at the Stark mansion.” He revealed.
‘Three minutes and twenty seconds left…’
To visit that day they had been forced to lie to mr Stark about Ana having a doctor's appointment in the city which could possibly take up the whole day. They knew he would get suspicious if they asked for another day off so soon after the last time, they were used to work almost everyday in the Stark household.
He kept repeating those words while rocking them both from side to side. Eventually Tony snapped his eyes open and he looked around while breathing heavily. He started trash around when he was awake enough to notice the large arms wrapped around him. After a minute he started to recognize Steve's voice and calmed down bit by bit until he was gripping the blonde's shirt so hard that his knuckles turned white and he was full on sobbing.
“Tony!” Steve called after him “We aren't done yet!”
Jarvis happily slipped of his work jacket and shoes and settles down next to his wife and put an arm around her shoulders while kissing her red locks that she had put in a braid that laid on her shoulder. She leaned into his side and returned a kiss of her own on the corner of his mouth.
Hoooooooooly shit it has been a while since the last update. I am so so so so so so sorry!!!!! I honestly have no better excuse other than an extreme case of writers block but I really hope that this chapter makes up for it.
Tony just stared at him with a poker face with a raised eyebrow until Steve sighed.
“H-Howard?”
“He's, he’s out. They had him captured, but he, uh, he escaped almost six months ago.”
“It's going to hurt a little bit at first but after that I'm gonna make you feel so good Doll.”
He looked in the rearview mirror and saw Coulson's car right behind them. They were about two minutes away from Tony's location and he felt his stomach drop at the sight of smoke rising from the direction they were heading.
“Tony.” Bruce started slowly “Please tell me that you aren't talking about Tiberius Stone here. You know,
“Sorry about that. Now let's get back to business.” He nodded at Azazel who put a file on the table between them. “I managed to gather some more information on Tiberius Stone. I also sent one of my best trackers after him and she has been observing him all day. He was seen today in New York with another man who we managed to identify as Brock Rumlow.” He sent a curious expression towards the team at the different levels of horror appeared on their faces.
Tony hung up the phone and shook his head with a little smile. Typical Aunt Peggy, always fussing over him yet insisting that she is always fine herself, despite her memory getting worse by the time.
He had been making his way through the different hallways when he heard voices getting closer. Tony looked around and saw a door on his right and went in and closing the door behind him. He pressed his ear to the door and listened as the voices walked past him and disappearing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Don't call me that, it's mr Fury for you." Nick Fury replied with a scowl.
WARNING: Violence in this chapter
Tony stood there for a while, just staring at the door where Ana had been, thinking that it was finally over. Steve was coming for him.
He was almost done picking it when he heard footsteps coming in his direction, and fast.
“Steve!?”
“Well, mr Rogers is out of a successful surgery and is now resting, but as you all probably could see mr Rogers was in a very bad shape. He has many injuries like burns, deep cuts and some internal bleeding. He has several broken fingers and ribs and his right collarbone is fractured. We are very lucky that one of those ribs didn't puncture his lung since it had been poking at it when you got him here.
When Tony turned to look at the Captain he barely contained a gasp. Light blue eyes met his own brown ones and attached to those eyes was the most gorgeous man Tony had ever laid his eyes on. The man was easily above 6 feet and was made of pure muscle. His blond hair looked golden in the sunlight and Steve himself looked like some kind of Adonis.
I would love to see who you think it is and you can leave your guesses in the comments if you want to.
At the comment Tony became aware of the state he was in. He looked down at his bruised and bloodied body, barely concealed by the light clothing he had been given. He didn't notice how his legs gave out and his body had come close to hitting the floor before Steve caught him around the waist and picked him up bridal style. His head was to foggy and the pain spread through him now that the adrenaline had run its course.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony was about to head back to the living room where Clint still was trying to beat his high score and failing miserably when his stomach growled again.
For three weeks Brock Rumlow, the man that had been with Schmidt the first day, would come in and with new ways to torture him. Sometimes he used a flame torch to burn his flesh, sometimes he beat him with his bare hands, once he had even used a hammer to break some of his ribs and fingers.
Bucky sighed before whispering to him.
The captain shot forward to the stove and removed the pan with the now burned eggs and put it in the sink. The smell of burned eggs filled the kitchen and Steve opened a window. He looked over at Tony with a sheepish expression on his face.
“Okay” Steve breathed out, relieved that it wasn't anything to serious “we’ll take you home.”
Eh, hi guys... Miss me?
“Edwin… Edwin…”
Steve was sitting on a chair with his head resting on the bed like Bruce but both his hands were gently but firmly wrapped around his own. The blondes hair was a mess and like most of the team he had purple bags under his eyes and he his eyebrows were furrowed together.
Steve wrapped his arm around Tony who leaned into his side and they made their way out of the cafe. Before they stepped out Steve turned to the owner of the cafe who had been standing close by during the whole spectacle.
He opened the door and when he didn't see anyone he ran (or limped) as fast as he could while doing the count down in his head.
Meanwhile in the Avengers mansion, the mob was preparing for the next day's mission. They all worked in tense silence, not wanting to wait another night to get their friend back but rather have him back with them as soon as possible.
“You know what” he chuckled “I'll let him go.” Before anyone could blink Howard had his gun against Tony's head and a shot rang out followed by a body hitting the floor.
“It's okay, Doll. It's okay, you're gonna be fine, he won't hurt you. I'll keep you safe.”
“Bruce, I'm fine. I promise. This is nothing I can't handle, I'm okay.”
Bucky lowered his gun and turned to his two companions and Lehnsherr and his men.

His fantasy was cut short when Tiberius gripped his face and held his mouth open.
“What the hell just happened!? You just threatened to kill him by ripping his spine out through his ass and now you are on nickname bases!?”
“I don't know Buck, I'm usually right about these things.”
“No.”
“Uh, Ana, how do you know about Rumlow still being alive?”
They settled in the car, Bruce driving and Tony in the passenger seat.
Natasha walked confidentiality on Tony's left side while Steve was on his right, his hand slightly brushing against Tony's own until Tony decided to be bold and  just clapped their hands together. Steve raised his eyebrows in surprise but didn't let go, squeezing the smaller hand slightly. Natasha just smirked and kept walking. When they reached the common room she went and sat in Clint’s lap and gave him a quick peck on the lips. The archer smiled and wrapped an arm around her waist.
Steve looked confused for a moment before realization hit him and he felt his stomach drop.
Tony just laughed and promised to call her. It had been a while since he had last spoken to Auntie Peggy. Her Alzheimer's was getting a bit worse and he wanted to be there for her, even if it was just over the phone. Maybe he could go and visit her and uncle Daniel soon, he thinks that they would like the team.
“No you are not, you almost fell three times trying to go to the bathroom yesterday. And stop whining, we are going home now, I was expecting you to be jumping up and down in excitement, you have basically been crawling on the walls since you woke up.”
“What? I mean it. If he hurts you I will kill him in the most painful way possible, co-signed by Pepper.” Tony looked over at Pepper who just smiled innocently at him and he turned his head back to Rhodey. His friend's expression had turned into a sad one and he sighed deeply. “I'm tired of you being hurt Tones. You have gone through so much and you deserve to be happy.”
“Whatever you say boy, anyway I got a meeting with the board in an hour. Now, Rumlow and Stone here have agreed to help me discipline you” he said and gave a pointed look to his son “by any means necessary.”
Tony had just gotten in his seat when his vision turned black and he passed out.
He gently stroked a hand through the mop of curls and kissed his forehead.
“Don't worry about it Steve, I get it. I'm just messing with you. It's hilarious how you, the great Captain of the Avengers, have been reduced into a blushing, sappy mother hen after getting a boyfriend.”
“No, I mean, what are you still doing here with me? Why would you stay with someone so broken that they can’t even sleep through the night without waking up screaming? You could do so much better Steve, you deserve someone who won’t keep you up at night with their nightmares or someone who doesn’t freak out when you try to do anything intimate with them. It’s just… I don’t deserve you.”
Pain exploded in his head and stars filled his vision. He was pretty sure that he blacked out for a while because when he came back to it he was stripped down to nothing but his boxers.
He pushed the thoughts out of his head and focused on the precious being in his hold. His heart ached at the sight of Tony so broken and bleeding, he was getting paler by the second and Steve urged Bucky to drive faster without tearing his eyes from the unconscious form.
Warning: slight smut at the end of the chapter!
Soooooo sorry for the wait! I've had some trouble with this chapter and I'm not 100% happy with it. Hopefully next chapter will be better and I'd love to hear your opinions in the comment section. <3
-----------------------------------------------------------------
“Damn it Bruce, why can't you just patch me up in the mansion?” Tony whined.
“No Tony, I simply told him to give you a chance. Trust me, he would never have given you that job if he didn't think that you were truly worthy of it. Okay? You are brilliant and he has complimented your work on numerous occasions and you know him, he doesn't give compliments unless you truly deserve them.”
“How do you know the Captain!?” Shouted the man, his face a mere inches from Tony's own and he could smell the stench of alcohol coming from the man's mouth. “Answer me you little shit!” Roared the stranger before delivering a punch across Tony's face.
“Oh shit!”
“Let's go”
we find him, that is.” Clint mumbled from Steve’s left. The blonde sent a glare to the other man along with the rest of the table.
Tony saw his chance and plunged the piece of glass right into Rumlow’s neck and hitting the major artery. Brock collapsed on Tony's smaller frame and gurgled on his own blood before stilling completely.
--------------------------------------------------------
They walked out hand in hand and went down to the entrance where everyone else already were already waiting for them.
*sits on my throne in hell, laughing evily while petting my pet hellhound*
Tony quickened his pace when he spotted the relatively empty cafe and tried to focus on not getting hit by a car. He entered the small cafe and looked around when he spotted Ty sitting alone in a booth with two steaming mugs of coffee on the table in front of him. The blonde was hurriedly writing something on his phone with his lower lip in between his teeth, a sign that he was either nervous or stressed.
Bruce's thinking was cut off when Steve spoke up.
After a second he shrugged and went inside the building, figuring his roommate probably also finished early today.
Steve didn't tear his eyes from the door where Howard had disappeared until he felt a slight tug on his sleeve and turned around to look at Tony, what he saw broke his heart.
“You're crazy Ty! I don't want anything to do with you anymore! You abandoned me when I needed you the most and all this time that I've been with Steve have honestly been the best time of my life! Now leave me the hell alone!”
“Like you are one to talk. I was at my morning run. Coffee? Bruce tells me that you can't really function without any.”
“Possessive much?” Tony teased with a smirk.
“Doctor Cho gave me the number to a psychologist for Tony, said he might need it after-”
Steve snapped out of his thoughts when the yelling and running around of his team became too loud for him to ignore. He sat back down on the couch with his head in his hands, trying to keep the tears that threatened to escape at bay, he couldn't afford to look weak in front of his team right now, not when everyone was freaking out already. He blinked back the tears and took a few deep breaths before looking up. Clint was on the phone yelling at someone, probably Phil or Bucky, Natasha was trying to comfort a distressed Bruce who was sitting on the floor with his arms wrapped around his legs, Thor was pacing back and forward in the room while spitting out curses in Norwegian.
He was rewarded with a confused look.
What did stir a little curiosity in him were the two men who had been coming to the mansion for a few days now and always went down to the basement where they would stay for hours some days. He could never hear what it was they were doing whenever he walked by since the basement was sound proof.
Everyone just looked at him strangely. It was not often you heard Fury give compliments to anyone.
Tony was fuming in the shower, washing his hair with a little more force than necessary.
Steve gave a small smile and walked away. Tony, still beat red in the face, touched his cheek where he had been kissed lightly. He felt warm all over and went into his new gigantic room.
"Happy birthday Tony!" Smiled Bruce.
"Nothing a little coffee can't fix" he muttered to himself.
Steve, of course, offered to help since it would be quite difficult with one of his hands wrapped in a cast.
WARNING! DESCRIPTIONS OF VIOLENCE AND ANGST!
(See the end of the chapter for
Today he was testing different types of knives.
“Tony Rogers?”
Steve slowly removed his fingers after making sure that Tony was stretched enough, he wasn't small by any means and he really wanted to avoid hurting his lover.
They came to an abrupt halt when they saw Erik and three of his men pointing their guns at two other men who were half kneeling on the floor, blood and cuts covering every one of them. Before anyone could pull their trigger Steve called out.
“I thought we could shower together, you know, to save water and time. Wouldn't want a furious Natasha barging in here because we wouldn't hurry up and she is craving pancakes.”
WARNING! DESCRIPTION OF INJURIES AND MENTIONS OF RAPE!
“Why would you have to meet him for coffee for that?” At that Tony shrugged.
“He is in one of the recovery rooms and he is sleeping. If you'd like, you can come and see him if you promise to be quiet and calm since it could otherwise disturb him and that would slow down the healing process. And doctor Banner, I'd also like to take a look at your hand in there.”
“Fury what the hell is going on? Jesus Christ, what the hell happened to him!?” Exclaimed Steve when seeing the unconscious boy in Fury’s arms.
Anyway here is another chapter for you who are still reading this garbage and I thank your for your patience. I love and appreciate you so much!
“Wait, what do you mean I “healed quite a bit while unconscious”? How long have I been out?”
“WAIT! WAI-” his screams were cut off with a gurgling sound as a bullet pierced his throat and he choked on his own blood. He fell on his side next to Tiberius whose face was turned to him. The last thing Brock Rumlow ever saw was the battered face of Tiberius Stone, the blondes eyes, wide and empty staring into his soul.
Rhodey held his gaze and crossed his arms over his chest.
