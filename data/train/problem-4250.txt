“Look, Claire,” he tried, but she shook her head wildly and marched right into his space, hitting him in the chest so hard he winced, the old wound twinging.
a ghoul, and then get Donna in on it.” Dean held his phone between his ear and his shoulder, carefully setting down the pry bar and making a face as he stood up. “I don’t
“No beer?” Claire asked, looking at him over the top of her coke, and the expression was so familiar for a minute that it punched right through his gut.
“We’re supposed to meet up with Donna in a couple days, but we could come back and help after,” Claire offered, resolutely not looking at him. “I mean,” she shrugged, like it didn’t mean anything, “if you want.”
“Thought I’d miss it more,” he mused to the exposed wall he’d been methodically tearing down. Maybe he was just tired. He’d helped save the damn world, after all. Didn’t he deserve a break?
“Ugh,” he mutters, making a face. The room is cold, and he shudders when the air hits his bare chest, the other side of the bed vacant in a way that makes his chest ache, just a little. It’s better than the outright panic from the first time, staved off now only by the small square of paper stuck to the pillow.
“C’mon,” he mutters, tugging Cas forward with him as he turns, shifting his grip from Cas’s lapel to his hand, tangling their fingers. “I wanna. I got somethin’ for you,” he adds, when Cas tilts his head at him, squinting a question. “Might make you finally get it in your thick skull that you’re it for me.”
“He said some things,” he admitted vaguely, uncomfortable at even hinting at it. “I’m tryin’ to live up to ‘em, that’s all.”
“Dean are you…Sure?” Sam asked, staring up at the place, his face scrunched up and skeptical in that specific Sam way. “I mean, it’s a little…,” he gestured vaguely.
“Ring, yeah. I um. I had it resized,” he admits, wiggling his hand a little until Cas reaches out to pick it up, all gentle like he thinks it might break in his hands. “I figured…I figured she’d like that it was you.” His throat decides to make a bid to close up then, and he has to swallow hard, reaching up to scrub one hand through his hair as Cas carefully inspects the ring.
“I love you,” Cas tells him, an immutable fact of the universe, and tugs him closer until their foreheads rest against each other. Maybe Dean should have waited to reorient their world until he was dressed in something better than Scooby-Doo pajama pants and an old robe, but.
“Go wild,” Dean told her, glancing at Claire who shot him a grateful look that he mostly ignored for both their sakes. He knew what it was like not to have your own room for most of your life, what it meant when you finally did get one, no matter how old you were. “Well,” he amended, looking around the place, “after I get it built.”
“But I know for a fact our kid didn’t leave you there, which means you’ve been ghosting me for the past three months.” He tries to keep how much that hurts out of his voice, but it cracks anyway and he has to stop, clearing his throat. He reaches up to wipe furiously at his eyes, sighing.
Dean called in a favor from a guy who had a ghost problem a few years back, who was eager to repay the brothers for saving his life with a thorough inspection. He went over what felt like every inch of the place - inside and outside, looking for cracks, sloping floors, jammed doors and windows, and a whole host of other things he’d probably explained, but that Dean had tuned out. Mostly, Dean stayed out of his way and poked around the maybe-once-a-garden, trying to figure out how to salvage it.
“And I’m sure I’ve got some family-friendly flicks I could pull up so you don’t have to scramble for a sitter every time,” Dean offers, walking with Cas to the door.
Dean flips the knife back in on itself and returns it to his pocket before leaning his upper back and head against the alley wall. Castiel lets out a breath he hadn’t realized he was holding. “Holy crap, Dean. Are you okay?”
“My dad dragged us all over the place for his fights. Traveling is great and all, but it’s better when it’s done on your own terms, if you ask me.” Dean observes the colorful doodles Jack is making on his new sheet of paper. “Stability is important for a kid. You’re doing good by this one, Cas. He’s safe. He doesn’t need to worry about where his next meal is coming from. And he’s got a reliable role model.”
The rest of the afternoon goes about as one might expect. Pizza is ordered, delivered, and consumed. Birthday candles are lit and blown out to the tune of the Happy Birthday song. Cake is served (Dean abstains in favor of another slice of pizza, the only pie-based option available).
“What?” Now Castiel is wearing his surprised face, but the agitation is still there, so he just looks like a sad puppy.
When Dean came to, he was lying on his memory foam with the comforter tucked over him and a bandage wrapped snugly around his arm. He was woozy and stiff, but the worst of the vertigo had passed. He turned his head and found Castiel snoozing at an uncomfortably crooked angle in a chair beside the bed. It didn’t seem real. Had they actually done it? Or had Dean died in the dungeon and this image was just the last electrical impulses of his failing brain?
An exchanging-of-dollars-for-drinks later, Dean takes one of the large plastic cups from Cas’s hand. “You didn’t have to do that, Cas, but thank you.”
” he practically screams, ignoring the twinge it causes in his head in favor of the rising panic he feels in his throat. At least it’s not vomit. “Red, get your ass in here right now!”
“That beauty is in the eyes of the bee-holder.” It’s probably the worst pun he’s ever made, but he just couldn’t pass up the timing.
It was still so strange to hear himself say, but Dean had been practicing. If this bonkers plan of theirs worked, he wanted to be prepared to show Castiel that he really did reciprocate and that the feeling was mutual. His resume would never include face-to-face confessions as a skill. So, if he could practice into his phone where no one but Castiel’s voicemail inbox would hear, maybe he could muscle-memory his way into saying it for real.
Sam set down the book he’d been reading and signed to Eileen that Miracle was at the door. He could hear paws scrabbling at the sill. Sam’s bare feet hit the floor and in a few quick strides, he had the door open. “What’s wrong, buddy?” he asked, leaning down to scritch between the dog’s ears. Instead of staying put to receive the attention, Miracle bounded back down the hallway, so Sam followed.
Dean sat on his bed with his weapons strewn across a towel. He didn’t actually need to hold the phone to leave his message, so he had it resting on the nightstand while he cleaned and inspected the tools of his trade. It helped him think clearer to have something to occupy his hands while he rambled. Dean didn’t say so, but resuming the hunts had been good for him. A goal he could distract himself with and take pride in, one that required focus. And needing to focus meant he drank less.
” he yelled finally, pry bar slipping from his hands to clatter on the wooden floor, narrowly missing his foot. They drywall cracked and split when his fist went through it, his knuckles splitting; the blood welled up, red amid a sea of white dust. He swallowed and stared down at his hand, barely aware of the pain. He could almost see another wall, blood on his knuckles then, too, and that same black hole tearing him apart from the inside.
you get to stay with me, what kind of question??” He rolls his eyes, does his best to ignore the way Cas’s have gone a little wide. “I told you, man,” he adds, because he needs to make this
“Nope, shut up, it’s my turn,” Dean shushes him with a finger against his lips, grinning crookedly when Cas goes cross-eyed trying to stare at it. “Of course I fuckin’ love you,” he says, meeting Cas’s eyes when they snap immediately back to him, filled with wonder.
He huffed, a terrible bitterness in it. “Yeah,” he agreed, “it is. But it was different this time, Claire. He was –“
“You’re not,” Cas says, half-way to breathless, one hand reaching up to cup the side of his face. Dean leans into the touch, turning his face until he can kiss Cas’s palm. “
“Well…Good,” Dean mutters, ignoring the way his hands are shaking, just a little, as he picks up what he came in here for and turns back to Cas, holding his hand out. “I uh. I was gonna wait, but,” he shrugs, making a face. “Hell, I think maybe we’ve waited long enough.”
“You could stay with me and Eileen at the new house,” Sam tried, his hangdog puppy face at full force. “There’s plenty of room and Miracle would be happier with you there.” And no space for old ghosts, or places to hide convenient bottles of whiskey.
“Mm,” Cas hums, finally turning his full attention to Dean, his body shifting like it’s instinct to meet Dean halfway, and maybe it is, now. After everything. He stares for a long moment and Dean lets him look, used to holding the full force of Cas’s attention by now. It still sparks something hot in his belly, but he ignores it for now in favor of watching Cas back – the way the snow falls onto his hair and sticks, the soft, fond look on his face.
“In the Empty, yeah.” Dean sighed, letting her go once it looked like she wasn’t going to hit him again. “I tried, kid,” he admitted, leaning back against a support beam. “Tried everything I knew, and some shit I didn’t know. Prayed to Jack, called Rowena; hell, I even broke into Death’s library again.”
“Well, it ain’t haunted and it ain’t underground, so things are already lookin’ up,” Dean joked, shrugging. He twisted the cap off the water bottle and downed it; the water was cool, but it did little for the tremors, the old burn in his throat that just wouldn’t go away.
“Oh I see,” there is something in her tone that sets Castiel on edge but he can’t think about it for too long. Ketch is waiting for him.
“Again, don't know what you’re talking about,” he lies, trying to keep his anger and irritation down. If he even shows a hint of how much seeing her and Cas together affected him she will latch onto it like the leech she is and drain him until he is nothing more than a husk of a man in love with his best friend.
to write this article about. And has come up with nothing. He knows he is over thinking this and that there are so many interesting things he could write about but knowing the fact that his job is very much on the line with this? It puts a lot of pressure on finding the right topic. Nothing seems big enough. Nothing is filled with the hope and love and Christmas magic that Charlie and the rest of Roman Magazines is looking for.
“Complementary pajamas Cas! And let me tell you, they are the most comfy things I have ever had. It’s like I’m wearing nothing when really I am!” Dean replies with one of his winning smiles.
“It got easier each year that passed and eventually I was looking forward to the holidays. I was a sophomore in college when I met this guy. His name was Aaron and we clicked right away. We started dating a month after we met and I was so excited to bring him home to meet the family for Christmas. What I didn’t realize was that my dad thought Aaron was a girl. That’s when I discovered how much of a homophobic asshole my dad really was.
“That's so good to hear about Sam! I haven’t seen him in awhile, maybe he would want to meet for coffee sometime? Oh that sounds great! Could you maybe ask him for me?” Becky rambles. Dean can feel his headache getting worse. It was already bad from having to deal with his guys and the plans missing some key bits of information. To be fair these are one of the better drawing sets he's gotten from Shurley Engineering. He doesn’t recognize the initials on the plans, so he’s guessing it's a new hire at the firm.
“Thanks Claire,” Cas replies, blinking away the moisture and looking away. Dean chuckles quietly, knowing how much his friend hates getting emotional about some things. “Emma helped a lot, she really has an eye for design.”
The other man clears his throat awkwardly before smiling at them once again. “Right, of course, a miscommunication on our end, but no problem with that!”
Dean had been dating Lisa for a while and really thought she would be the one he would spend the rest of his life with. Her and her son Ben, who’s only a couple years older than Emma, were at the school's annual bake sale the first year Dean participated and they hit it off instantly.
“A little hot for teacher are we Cassie?” The shorter man teases. Castiel rolls his eyes and sends a small glare his way. He watches the man in question make his way over with his own twinkle in his eye. A small groan escapes Castiel’s mouth knowing exactly what is going to happen next.
It only takes fives seconds for Castiel to fall right on his ass and have Dean laughing at him. He glowers at the other man refusing to get up, honestly he doesn’t even think he could if he wanted to, and Dean just laughs harder. So Castiel does the only thing he can think of that will make the situation better. He pouts.
“Yes!” they all reply in unison. With another smile Cas turns back to the doors and opens them into a beautiful master bedroom. As they walk in they're greeted by a king sized bed with a white comforter and light tan accent pillows and blankets. There's a sitting area to the side with comfortable looking chairs and a unique glass table that catches Dean’s eye. White marble tiles in the master transitions to light hardwood as they continue through the small villa and come to a fun bay window seating area with an amazing view of the ocean, and the second bedroom which holds two twin beds. They also have white comforters but with soft blue accents instead. In the bathroom the white tile returns and Dean is blown away by how amazing everything looks. Cas has really outdone himself on the design and he can’t believe the transformation the villa underwent in just a few days.
“You too,” Castiel replies before stepping around her and down the stairs. Ketch is standing by the door looking at his watch and tapping his foot in irritation. When he catches sight of Castiel he makes a hurry-up gesture and walks out the door. With a heavy sigh, Castiel follows behind him to the shiny rental car sitting in the parking lot.
“Yes, I do! My husband and I run a small inn and we definitely have room for you two,” She says with a smile on her face. Relief rushes through Castiel and he finally feels like he can relax for a minute. They have a place to stay, this is good. “There he is now! Chris! These two gentlemen need a place to stay for the night and I thought they could stay at the inn!”
“Who did she run to last time, Cas? Was it you? No, she ran to me because I was the better option!” Dean throws back at the other man. Cas opens his mouth to yell at Dean again but before he can get a word out Claire speaks up.
Mr. and Mrs. Winters lead them up the stairs giving them a few fun facts about the building that has been there since the early 1800s. Castiel even sees two more trees at the top of the stairs. The sight makes him smile.
Dean closes his eyes, bringing his hand up to rub at his forehead where he can feel a headache already growing. “Cas, this shower is already bigger than the one I have back at my house in the states, it does not need to be bigger.”
“Hello, we really need to get on the next flight to Aspen. We have work to do and our jobs are on the line, so it is imperative we get there immediately,” Castiel states with what he hopes is a friendly smile. His people skills are rusty though so he's not quite sure what he looks like. Apparently, it didn’t work though because the lady behind the counter gives him a flat look.
“Hey Benny!” he calls when he finds the burly man. “Can you take over for the rest of the day? I got some stuff I gotta take care of.”
“Because he was a cheetah!” Dean exclaims with a big smile and some form of jazz hands. Some of the kids giggle at his antics and continue looking at the beautiful animals. While Castiel tries to not look at the beautiful man in front of him. Cas lets them watch the cheetahs for a few more minutes before shuffling them to the next habitat housing the jaguars. Cas is so focused on getting to the next spot that he doesn’t see Dean whisper to two of the students and all of their matching smiles.
The next morning Castiel finds himself wandering around his apartment triple-checking his list. Just as he’s satisfied he has everything, there’s a knock on his door. He checks his watch; he has four hours until his flight takes off.
Dean finds himself sitting next to Cas, who is watching the ocean for any signs of sea life. Dean watches Cas. His friend looks like he's doing better but there is still a stiffness to his shoulders that Dean wants to see gone. Shifting in his seat, Dean turns so his body is facing Cas’ and grabs the other man's shoulders to turn him as well, so that his back is to Dean. Cas glances at him confused, but when Dean’s fingers start kneading his muscles he goes completely pliant. His head falls forward with his eyes closed and leans back into Dean a little more. Dean swears if Cas were a cat he would be purring right now.
“Cassie,” He frowns, looking deeply offended by the nickname. Dean just laughs out loud drawing the attention of a few of the kids. He waves them off and they get back to their assignment.
The sight melts Dean’s heart and, with a genuine smile of his own, he replies, “No problem sweetheart! Have a good flight.”
“Wow, really Cas? Throwing me under the bus like that?” Dean asks affronted. Everyone else around them bursts into laughter at Dean's offended face and Castiel’s shrug.
“Well I hope someday you will be able to get the Christmas spirit back,” Chris says while standing up and leaving the sitting room. Dean stares after him then shakes his head and returns to his laptop. Unfortunately he has as much inspiration as he does Christmas spirit.
“What do you say we go finish this project we started together and then we can go get started on the rest of our lives together?” Dean asks, giving Cas his most charming smile. He knows the line is cheesy, but there are so many emotions swirling around them he feels the need to lighten the mood a bit.
“I’m sorry to hear that, you don't have to tell me, but what happened?” Dean asks his curiosity piqued.
This time of the year you should be surrounded by the people you love. Trading stories and sharing laughs around the fire while drinking hot chocolate. A big giant feast with all kinds of homemade delicious treats. It should be a time to celebrate, not just an excuse to get the family together.
“Oh I bet, did you get her number?” Castiel sasses back, taking Dean by surprise. He didn’t think the man had it in him with always being so stuffy and uptight around the office.
Dean scrambles back to his side of the makeshift bed, which only gives them a few scant inches between them. Dean can feel the flush on the back of his neck and wills it down. He is already embarrassed enough after snuggling up to his best friend, he doesn’t need a blush to help with that. Luckily Cas is still too sleepy to open his eyes fully, so Dean is given a few moments to get himself under control. There is movement from within the boat that catches both of their attention and they turn their heads to see Benny popping his head out from the door with a mug of coffee.
“Just tired.” Dean glances around the room and spies Benny, Jo, Emma, and Claire all still present. “Cas is on the verge of a breakdown and I know I am too, so I can imagine how all of you are feeling. I figured we could use a break since we haven't had one since we came back from Christmas.”
“Alright let's go find our girl,” Dean mumbles against Cas’ shoulder before pulling away. He grabs hold of Cas’ hand and twines their fingers together. Cas doesn’t say anything about it so Dean doesn’t either.
It's the first day of school. His little girl is growing up so fast he can't even believe it. This isn’t the first time he has had to drop his daughter off on her first day of school. He has done this four times already so you would think the fifth time would be easier. Well Dean can honestly say it is definitely not any easier.
By the time the credits roll, Jack has passed out on the floor, cuddled up with a plushie he’d brought. Dean removes his fingers from where they’ve been carding through Cas’s dark tangles and sits up to turn off the television. Cas kisses his cheek and stretches before bending—inadvertently showing off the finer points of his runner’s body, much to Dean’s appreciation—to gather Jack into his arms, stuffed animal and all.
“Oh, and uh, since he sleeps, does that mean he’ll also need to eat? And, you know…?” Dean waves vaguely toward the bathroom.
A good few moments of hysterical laughter pass before she says more clearly into her end of the line, “I am SO sorry. Please forgive my friend. It’s my fault he’s in this state. Have a good night!”
When the following Saturday rolls around, Castiel is up early, aflutter with anticipation of the day’s activities. He’s already set out the birthday tablecloth and balloons. He runs through a thorough written checklist and timeline of everything else needing to get done: clean the kitchen, set the table, wrap Jack’s gifts, prep the snacks,
,” Cas corrects. “And I didn’t name him. He told me. He has reclaimed the name from one of the Fallen, the angel of clouds and weather. I’d say it suits him.”
“Thank you!” he practically shouts as he rockets away toward the staircase so he can get dibs on movie selection, even though Dean and Cas always let him pick.
“Hey, Cas.” Dean hissed in a pained breath as he lowered himself onto the hotel mattress. His right shoulder was heavily wrapped in medical padding and his arm was strapped to his chest to keep it as immobile as possible. But that didn’t stop it from aching every time he moved. Sam had gone out to grab dinner and make a phone call to Eileen, who was likely spoiling Miracle back at her place, so Dean had taken the opportunity to call Castiel’s voicemail again. It had become a ritual of comfort for him. A method of healing.
His gut clenches painfully at the idea that maybe he’s losing it, that maybe he’ll have to deal with everything utterly alone and breaking down on top of it all.
Thursday evening, at 4:55 p.m., Dean fusses about the bakery’s kitchen like a fly at a picnic. He triple checks the stove to make sure the rolls aren’t burning. He straightens the cutlery for the second time. He dunks a pair of tongs into the salad bowl at the center of the table. Salad isn’t really Dean’s bag, but Cas seems like the kinda guy who’d back Sam up on the organic health food schtick.
Walking around to the passenger side, Dean opens the back door and pulls out a box sealed in dinosaur gift wrap. “Here ya go. You’d be doing me a huge favor if you could take this inside to wherever birthday gifts should go,” he says, placing the medium but light box into the boy’s arms.
As Castiel texts, Gabriel finishes his pie and stands to rinse the plate and fork. Setting the clean dishes into the drying rack beside the sink, he turns toward the remainder of the pie. “Should I put the rest of this in the fridge for Jack-a-boy?”
“So instead of smuggling a human, we’re depowering an angel,” Dean mused. “Alright. Sign me up. What do we need?”
Castiel can read between the lines of loneliness on Dean’s face. He’d certainly had his own fair share of isolation, never really feeling like he fit in amidst his older siblings—especially the ones his parents had praised above the others.
Before Cas can say anything else, the sound of a car horn honking fills the air, spoiling the moment. The sickly splutter of an engine in need of maintenance can be heard coming from the other side of the house.
With Cas’s hand resting on his knee and his arm around Cas’s shoulders, Dean doesn’t even care how sappy he feels. Right now, there is no more longing or fear. Here in this home, with this family, it’s enough for him to just be.
He paces around the living room until his cup is empty, only pausing once to watch the sun rise in brilliant orange and yellow hues over the slight hill that sits between the farm and the main road. As he rinses out his cup, he hears a soft scuffing of the linoleum and turns to find Jack shambling into the kitchen, a stuffed rabbit trailing close behind. Castiel puts on an authentic smile, fatigue ignored at the sight of spaceship pajamas and tousled hair. “Good morning, birthday boy! Are you hungry for breakfast?”
As the credits roll, Cas scowls. “Wait, why doesn’t Chewie get a medal? Is it because he’s not human?”
Cas grimaces at the wound, a long gash from the middle knuckle to just past Dean’s wrist bone. Luckily, the bleeding seems to have stopped for the most part. “It’s not deep enough for me to insist that we go to the emergency room, but this won’t be pleasant. I’ll do my best to move quickly. While I work, I’m going to say something and I want you to listen very closely and not argue. Am I clear?”
Cas grimaces, but takes Dean’s hand and leads him into the office, shutting the giant oak weapon softly behind them. He drops Dean’s hand immediately and goes to lean against his desk, arms propped behind him and legs crossed in front of him, and Dean wants to
Dean looks up but doesn’t turn around, instead catching the sparkling blue of Cas’s eyes in the rearview mirror. Cas is sitting in the back seat, center of the bench. He looks better than he’s ever seen him, yet so beautifully familiar in his dark suit, crisp white button-down, and that stupid trenchcoat. The moonlight reflects off the deep blue silk of his necktie. Dean huffs in amusement. “What are you doing back there?”
“No, Dean, everything’s fine, don’t worry.” Jack puts a hand on Dean’s shoulder, and, like Sam, it quells the rising tide of Dean’s anxiety.
Castiel nodded again, bringing the mug to his lips as Just Dean turned to walk away. He took a big gulp, and immediately realized how big of a mistake he had made. He jumped at the pain that engulfed his mouth, hot, bitter liquid stinging his tongue and throat. But that just caused him to spill the rest of the burning coffee all down the front of his shirt. Castiel cried out in agony.
Cas squinted at the writing on one of the posters. “What exactly is a led ze-pell-in,” Castiel asked, curving his fingers in the air to emphasize the unknown words.
Dean looked as if he might cry for a moment before he cleared his throat and leaned over the bar. “You do now, Castiel. You’re welcome here as long as you like.”
He’d sighed, closed his eyes, and let the familiarity of his senses wash over and ground him. The lucidity of what he could
- the warmth of his old, well-worn forest green henley, the heavy boots on his feet - laces pulled tight, the oily residue of the interior cleaner on his fingertips, the soft leather seat cushion underneath him.
Once they were on the road, nothing but sleepy silence between them, Castiel let his gaze linger again on Dean’s profile. Father must have been having a very good day when he created this man, Castiel decided. He was so mesmerized by Dean’s sharp, stubbled jawline that he completely missed Dean asking a question.
Dean pulls back to look at Cas’s lust-blown eyes, cupping his face in his hands. “Sweetheart,” he breathes. “We will have all the time in the world.” He kisses him then, soft, slow, fervent.
Instinctively, upon landing on earth, he began searching for a vessel. Nearby, he locked onto the desperate prayer of a righteous man, in despair and searching for purpose after the loss of his wife and child. The man, Jimmy Novak, willingly let him in, and though he desperately tried to access his grace, he found himself without any of the supernatural powers he relied on. His wings were still intact, yet they were mangled and broken in places. He couldn’t use them.
Castiel was led to a bathroom and told to wait. Dean returned with a soft pair of pants and a well-worn tee shirt. “Throw your clothes in the hall and I’ll get them in the washer,” he told Castiel.
They order pizza for dinner and drink cheap beer on the back patio as the sun begins its descent. Sam offers to stay the night and help Eileen ward the house from the evils they know, habits veteran hunters will never be able to let go of. They don’t talk about it.
He looked around until he spotted a man standing next to a tall building, gray hair matted and clothes tattered. He must have been standing there a while, Castiel decided. Definitely some type of guard.
Seeing Cas come is nothing short of miraculous; it takes Dean’s breath away. Cas arches his back and lets the orgasm wash over him, chanting Dean’s name like a prayer. Dean has been to heaven and hell and back, has seen things that would break even the strongest man, but nothing will ever, ever compare to this moment. The feeling of Cas trembling, shaking apart, panting beneath him, the physical evidence of their climax sticky and slippery on their skin, Cas’s arms pulling him close, his head pillowed on Cas’s chest, every inch of them touching, head to toe.
“I suppose my brothers and sisters are out there somewhere. They fell when I did, but none near me that I could see.”
Dean’s world shifts and narrows to their syzygy. The push and pull of their eager bodies, the give and the take. The sweat-slick slide of skin on skin, Dean’s arms quivering as they hold him up, his swollen lips sucking kisses into Cas’s jawline, down his neck, desperate pants and moans and curses and blasphemies rolling off Cas’s tongue.
“The garage, I think. He was tinkering with the car earlier. I suppose he’s still down there. Wait - is everything okay?” Sam is suddenly gripped with fear. He’ll probably never shake the feeling that something is always going to go wrong.
“Sentry Mar- you know what? Nevermind. A friend of Marlon’s gets his first cup on the house. You want cream ‘n sugar, Angel?”
The woman pulled over to the side of the street. “This is where you get out, kiddo. Can’t let my husband see me with a stranger riding shotgun. He’ll have my hide.”
He slumped sideways on the couch, bringing his feet up to stretch out. The next thing he knew, Dean was gently lifting his head and laying it back down on something soft.
The man was still standing there, had Castiel forgotten his manners? “Thank you, The Coffee Dean,” he said, nodding his head slightly in respect.
There’s an awkward moment, where Dean’s boot gets entangled in the seatbelt, and then they’re both laughing, Dean sprawled on top of Cas, one leg still in the front seat. Cas peppers kisses in between giggles across Dean’s face, while Dean grumbles for help. With a Graceful wave of his hand, Cas rids Dean of his clunky boots, and Dean finally straddles Cas’s hips. He swoops down for a deep, thrilling kiss that sends shockwaves of pleasure rippling him.
A month after they lose Cas, but save the world, Jack appears in the bunker, looking tired, but ever the radiant new capital G God that he is. He finds Sam in the library, startles him from the book he’s reading.
“I did not have a body when I fell. I was purely a multidimensional wavelength of celestial intent. I could not be injured in any way.”
The women chatted, oblivious of Castiel, before gathering their bags and leaving him alone in the laundromat. He walked up to the wet box and began stripping his clothing off - first his overcoat, then his suit jacket, his shirt. His pants followed, but he left the underwear on as they did not get any gross coffee on them. After stuffing the items into the wet box, closing the lid, and pressing numerous buttons, he surmised that currency was the only thing he did not have that would allow the wet box to work. He sighed heavily, shoulders drooping. He really did need to learn how to get currency in this world.
Jack places a comforting hand on Sam’s shoulder, easing Sam’s anxiety with a bright grin. “Better than okay, Sam.”
Now facing the city alone, Castiel was feeling woefully unprepared for life as a human. And his stomach was making the strangest gurgling noises. He supposed it must be hunger, and now that he thought about it, his throat was dry, too.
Dean walked up to Castiel’s chair with a cloth thrown over his shoulder and a spray bottle of some sort.
“Hey, buddy, sorry about that but, uh, my morning help called in and I gotta go open the shop. It’s early, I know.”
Castiel grinned and did and he was told. He returned to watch Dean. It was like the time he witnessed God lovingly handcraft humanity; smooth, graceful hands measuring and pouring and stirring. He got lost in the careful way Dean treated each ingredient like it was precious. He never wanted to look away from the sight before him, but soon, Dean was sliding a steaming cup across the bar with a little flourish of his hands.
“Do you kiss people, Dean?” Castiel asked as he examined the triangular food item on the plate in front of him. He picked it up at the tip and it flopped back on the plate.
Castiel thought Dean looked so graceful as he flitted about the shop, first turning on music (“This is Led Zeppelin, Cas, say it with me!”), then pressing buttons on strange-looking machines that whirred to life, filling the small shop with loud, ear-splitting grinding noises that drowned out the man in the speakers singing about rambling. Castiel covered his ears and winced.
“Yeah, Cas, you need quarters. Look, just put your clothes back on before someone sees you! You take everything so literally, I don’t get it. It’s like you really are from Mars.”
“Sleep tight, Cas, Dean murmured. “Please don’t steal all my valuables and disappear in the morning.”
And as Jack excitedly updates them on his plans for a new, better Heaven, Dean sends out a quick prayer to his Angel.
“Hey,” Dean called out. “I’m sure those stains’ll come right out if you take it to the laundromat next door.”
Dean chuckled. “When I’m bone-tired I don’t dream either. Are you feeling better? Do you remember anything about last night?”
“Sleep tight, Dean,” he sighed, pressing his lips to Dean’s softly. He didn’t have the energy to do it like Doctor Sexy.
Finally, though, they were parking in front of the cafe, and Dean was directing Castiel to grab some boxes out of the trunk. Castiel, laden with sweet-smelling boxes, carefully followed Dean into the shop.
Jack settles back into his seat. “Well, I’ve been discussing design plans with an awesome guy named Bobby Singer.”
Whatever preamble Dean has left, lingering inhibitions or insecurities, is left in the front seat. Cas is gripping and grabbing and pulling and dragging him over the seat; Dean is doing his best to keep up while also not letting Cas’s lips move too far away from his for one goddamn second because he cannot get enough of the way Cas feels like lightning on his tongue, a bright, white-hot spark to every nerve ending in his body.
So, he began the long trek to the nearest city, a place called Lawrence, according to the sign on the side of the road, 50 miles away.
Dean thinks for a moment, then shifts suddenly so he’s kneeling above Cas, surprising him, his voice rough, a little out of tune, but singing anyway, “
“Here, press these buttons and you can change the channel. Find something that interests you, okay?”
He doesn’t give Castiel a chance to ask any more questions before he walks off, Castiel supposed, to do his rounds. What a strange city guard.
Cas presses in again, his other hand laying claim to Dean’s other cheek, so that he has Dean’s face cradled gently, reverently in his palms. Between one breath and the next, the kiss deepens. Cas licks into the heat of Dean’s mouth, and Dean feels his cock begin to harden in his unforgiving blue jeans as they fall further and further into the embrace.
The door jingled as he opened it, and his senses were immediately overwhelmed. There was an earthy, warm, inviting scent permeating the small shop. There were brightly colored posters interspersed with strange black discs decorating the walls, and mismatched tables and chairs scattered about. In one corner, worn leather chairs were placed haphazardly, in another, a wide, blue, comfortable-looking sofa.
“What is ATM?” was his only reply, and that just elicited even more laughter. And she didn’t even explain what the letters meant.
“Why duhs id tas’ like tha,” Castiel moaned, attempting to speak without touching his tongue to any other part of his mouth. “Like duhrt. Id tas’ like duuurrt”
“Mmmmm!” He gasped, eyes wide. He didn’t know something could taste this good! He took another sip, and another, moaning in satisfaction.
“Cas, it’s okay! That’s just Benny. He’s harmless, I promise. I know a lot of people are scared of bigger dogs, but he’s a teddy bear.” Dean said, trying to placate Castiel. “Hey, give me your hand. Trust me!”
Dean checked his watch. “Alright, you go flip that sign over to open and I’ll make you any drink you want. Pick something off the menu.”
After wallowing on the armchair and nursing the ice water for half an hour while Dean served customers and puttered around the shop, Castiel was feeling a little better. His tongue still felt weird, but Dean assured him it would be better in a few days. The same could not be said for his clothes.
Dean lets out a borderline-hysterical laugh through his tears. Of course Jack knows. He wonders how long he’s known. The time for hiding is long, long over.
He led Castiel to the couch and picked up a little rectangular box, pointing it at a bigger rectangle set against the wall.
Chasing pleasure, eyes wild, heart reckless, Dean brings one arm with both his and Cas’s entwined hands to reach between them, releasing Cas’s hand only to take his cock with surety, strokes even, slick enough from their sweat and pre-cum. Cas follows his lead, jacking Dean to the same rhythm of his hips. Dean is on the edge faster than he wants to be, unable to hold on any longer, whispering desperately, brokenly, “so close, Cas, so close, I love you.”
“And when you do that thing with your head, and that eye-squinty thing. So fucking cute,” he mumbled.
“Right now, though,” he says when he releases Cas’s mouth, slick and shining, eyes intense and searching. “I’m not going to be able to think straight - not going to be able to think about anything else - until I’ve made you come.”
, he’d found the cassette of Zeppelin tracks he’d made for Cas under the seat, had to sit with his head down between his knees for a solid twenty minutes, coaching himself through deep breaths like Eileen taught him. When he finally felt like he wasn’t going to shatter into a million pieces, he wiped the errant tears from his face with the sleeve of his shirt and slid the tape into the deck and let his hand rest on the speaker for a moment, feeling the opening riff of “Ramble On” fill the space around him.
“Yeah, it’s a little after four, but I gotta get the coffee on, pick up the pastries from Missouri and the bagels from Jody. Come on, I ain’t leaving you here,” Dean dropped a bundle of folded fabric into Castiel’s lap. “Here’s your stuff. All clean. Get dressed, I’m going to take Benny out, and then we’ll go.”
Sam recovers from the shock quicker, demanding all the details from Jack, who is practically bouncing out of his chair as he regales them of his and Rowena’s adventure. Dean is only barely registering anything Jack is saying because all he can think is
At Dean’s next instruction, Castiel washed his hands in the bathroom and then began filling the glass case with the fresh pastries. It made Castiel’s stomach growl, loudly, and Dean laughed out loud when he heard.
“Dude!” Dean was back at his side with a towel. “You’ve got to let it cool down! Haven’t you ever had coffee before?” Dean grabbed the cup from his hands and pressed the towel to Castiel’s chest. “Are you okay?”
When the man didn't answer, Castiel tore his gaze from the wall. The man was beautiful, Castiel thought, even with his mouth gaping like a fish.
Castiel nodded and took his seat. The Coffee Dean was right behind him carrying a large, steaming mug. Castiel accepted the cup and looked at the light brown liquid curiously.
Dean reaches for Cas’s necktie, pulling at it to loosen the knot, his chest heaving, heart beating out the rhythm their lips just created. He bites his bottom lip and shakes his head.
Castiel grinned, and thanked him, knowing full well that his heart already belonged to Dean Winchester, knowing that if he ever had to leave, it would shatter him into a million pieces.
He tilted his head as he examined the balloon. And that’s when the man finally spoke to him, voice gruff yet friendly.
Castiel looked back to the talking box. “I don’t understand why they’re attacking each other’s faces.”
“It’s okay!” Dean said quickly, seeing the dejected look on Castiel’s face. “You can stay here tonight. I have to put your clothes in the dryer anyway.”
The pair lapsed into silence as they devoured their food. When they were finished, Dean announced it was bedtime.
“I am sorry, Dean, I did not mean to upset you. I will leave immediately.” Castiel closed his eyes and tried to feel his wings manifest. Nothing happened. “I still seem to be here.”
- the rumble of Baby’s idling engine, the faint hum of the air intake in the bunker’s garage, Robert Plant’s voice fading out of the speakers,
“How about the library?” Sam asks, and they all agree. Dean needs to cut off the car and close her up, lest he run down her battery. Jack and Sam are settled into cozy armchairs when Dean joins them a few minutes later. Jack is grinning brightly, but not saying a word.
They’re both silent for a few moments, then Cas scoots forward on the bench, his face so close Dean can feel his heated breaths on the back of his neck.
- the black coffee he drank that morning from the mug still sitting half-empty on the kitchen counter.
Dean’s eyes narrowed as he set the tray down on the table in front of Castiel and passed him a plate. “Yeah, Cas, kissing. When two people like each other a lot, they kiss. It’s really fun.”
He spends the majority of the day with Sammy helping Eileen move into a small house in town. She wanted to be closer to them, yet didn’t seem too keen on living in the bunker. Dean figures it won’t be long before Sam is spending more nights in the white bungalow with blue shutters than he does at the bunker. That thought doesn’t bother him nearly as much as it might have before he learned Cas was okay.
“Sorry about the noise,” Dean shouted. “I like to have all the beans ground first thing so I don’t have to do it later.”
“In heaven, resting. The Empty was cruel to him. Time is different there, you know, so to him he was there for a very long time. But I restored his true Grace, and that is helping him heal quickly. It shouldn’t be long until he is back to his old self.”
Castiel parroted Dean’s actions, finding he enjoyed the food very much and he was a lot hungrier than he realized.
“Like this, Cas,” Dean demonstrated, picking up the triangle from the long end and cramming it in his mouth. “Ith pitha,” he explained around his mouthful.
again. To heal and move on. To have what he never thought he could before: a future. The happiness that bubbles up in his chest is near painful, but not unwelcome.
“I was a high-ranking soldier in heaven, my job was leading my garrison. We guarded the southern border.”
The man knew he was an Angel! Castiel was overwhelmed with gratitude. He exhaled in relief. “If that is best, yes, please.”
Fully awake now, Dean huffs a laugh into Cas’s chest. “Oh it’s - uh. Don’t judge me, okay, it’s a thing, with the car, and the sex and - oh god-“ he looks up to see Cas staring down at him with his classic head-tilt-eye-squint confusion and Dean’s heart stutters because he fucking
“It’s okay, Dean, you needn’t be afraid. It is just my power returning to me - my Grace that had been depleted in the fall.”
But Castiel didn’t hear that last sentence. He was too distracted by the monster currently stalking towards him. He gasped and pressed himself back into the door. “Dean!” he shouted, eyes wide with fear.
Dean laughed, “yeah, I do. You're very weird and I’m pretty sure you have amnesia. But it isn’t a bad weird. So yeah, I like you, buddy.”
Cas runs one hand up and down the smooth skin of Dean’s back as they both remember how to breathe again. He reaches down and pulls his trenchcoat from the floor of the Impala, spreading it over their entwined bodies as the sweat on their skin cools in the chilly night air.
Castiel did trust Dean, he just didn’t trust the wolf-dog-bear thing. Yet. But he stuck out his hand anyways, and Benny sniffed it then attacked his palm with his tongue. Castiel did not like that feeling at all.
“Yeah, dude! A mocha has espresso, chocolate, and steamed milk. It’s the perfect blend of sweet and bitter.”
Cas’s eyes sparkle in amusement, “That one’s my favorite.” He leans in for a kiss that Dean is more than happy to give to him, now, tomorrow, forever.
“Dean, I know what happened when the Empty took him. The Empty showed me. It mocked him with it for ages. It didn’t just break his mind and body, it broke his heart, too. That’s something that Grace can’t heal. Only you. And, forgive me if I’m wrong, but you love him, don’t you?”
He leans back in for another kiss, burning desire simmering low and hot in his belly. They’re both hard now, pressed flush together, and Dean lifts up slightly and rocks his hips forward slowly, the first drag of their leaking cocks together drawing deep, guttural moans.
Dean chattered on about this and that during their walk, but Castiel was unable to pay attention to much, preferring to marvel at Dean’s exquisite profile, his scruff, the way his jeans fit just right - human thoughts that Castiel had never entertained before. Castiel was unsure why he was having thoughts about Dean’s pants, but it felt like a kaleidoscope of butterflies was let loose inside of him.
This time Dean’s heart really does stop beating, or at least that’s what it feels like. He can’t breathe, jaw slack as he stares at the kid, praying he didn’t hallucinate the words that just came out of his mouth.
Castiel landed on a show where a man in a white coat was attacking a woman in all blue clothing with his mouth, though she appeared to be enjoying the attack and was attacking him back with her mouth. They appeared to be inside a closet. Castiel was glued to the scene before him and didn’t even hear Dean return to the room carrying a tray.
Castiel took Dean’s direction and walked next door to the laundromat. There were two women inside, one was folding her garments and the other was pulling them out of one box and putting them into another. Castiel studied them intensely as they worked, and he came to the conclusion that one box made the clothing wet while the other made the clothing dry again.
‘Earth is a strange place indeed,’ Castiel thought, as he watched the rural Kansas landscape become increasingly crowded with little brick houses, cramming themselves together into smaller and smaller spaces. This was the city. This was Lawrence.
Sam lets out a relieved rush of air. “Okay,” he jerks his head towards the stairs. “Let’s go find Dean.”
Jack hadn’t given him a time frame; Dean doesn’t know for sure when Cas will be well enough to leave Heaven. So Dean lets the days pass easily into a few weeks, always, always sending a prayer up letting Cas know he’s thinking about him.
The Coffee Dean set about his business, nodding to one of the armchairs in the corner. “Why don’t you have a seat, buddy. I’ll bring this right to ya.”
Dean groans. Charlie’s had a crush on Sam’s best friend and roommate for going on three years now, and Dean thinks—no, he
Inside, Jack has dutifully set the gift on the short folding table Castiel had set up for that purpose. Hyped up, Jack now leaps between the couch cushions, attention focused on the ancient television in front of him which he has turned to cartoons.
“What do you say, everyone? Should my brother and his friend here join the party?” Gabriel asks into his microphone. A cacophony of encouraging shouts is returned and Gabriel hams it up, curling one palm around his ear and lifting the other hand, palm to the sky, in an upward motion as the din grows.
Cas takes Jack’s winter wear from Dean’s hands and hangs it beside his own on the coat rack by the entry.
“You sure can, buddy,” Dean replies, hoisting Jack onto one hip. “Sam, this is Jack, Cas’s nephew. And his brother Gabriel.”
The early morning voice grows concerned at the sound of a sniffle. “What’s the matter, Dean?” Cas pulls his head back just enough to scan Dean’s face, baby blues opened wide like searchlights.
Cas sits on a stool by the window. Out of the way but nearby, he observes the proceedings and offers smiles of encouragement whenever Dean looks in his direction—which, admittedly, is often. A few patrons recognize Cas and start chatting him up, so Dean turns his attention to the folks actively browsing. The pace has picked up and he needs to focus on his clientele anyway; first impressions are important, especially to a small business like his.
“...is drink this and wait for us in the living room. You spend enough time slaving over these ovens,” Cas replies, handing over the lifegiving beverage and shooing Dean from the kitchen.
“Oh, that’s the bad guy from…” Cas snaps his fingers a few times, trying to recall. “Ghostbusters!” He looks pleased as punch for remembering yet another pop culture reference and Dean can’t help but grin at the enthusiasm. To be fair, it’s been about a year since they watched it together, so he’s granted the small victory.
He failed to keep Sam in one piece. He abandoned Ben. He’d been helpless to save his own daughter from herself. Even the shapeshifter kid had been taken from right out of his arms. How could he ever hope to keep a child as important as
But instead of calling, he simply texts Sam that they’ll be heading back to the bunker in the morning and expect to be there in a couple of days. Sam likewise assures that his support hunt with Garth will be wrapping up soon.
“Well, alright. As long as I won’t be in the way. Maybe I can help you set up or something. What time should I get there?”
Walking down the stairs he takes in the countless Christmas decorations. Last night he was completely overwhelmed and felt like he had just walked into a Christmas store that had exploded. There were trees everywhere. Lights hanging off of every available surface. Dean wouldn’t be surprised if he started hearing “All I Want For Christmas” any minute now. Instead Dean hears people moving around in one of the great rooms and he follows the noise.
Cas’ whole face falls. What's worse than Dean calling him buddy? Calling him by his full name. Dean has only done that a few times in their many years of friendship and each time they had been fighting.
Castiel and Dean stare at their daughters in shock. They really shouldn’t be surprised though. Both of them are incredibly smart and independent, so it makes perfect sense that they would have everything figured out before Dean even thought about the logistics of it all. A proud smile forms on Dean’s face as he opens his arms for a hug. His little girl walks into them with a smile of her own and Dean holds her tight. He kisses the top of her head before releasing her.
“Good morning everybody!” Dean’s cherry voice echoes around the room. The man makes his way to their table and Castiel quickly shuts his tablet down. Him and Dean might have made progress in their relationship but they are still competitors when it comes to the article.
They sit in comfortable silence, watching the sky turn lighter and lighter as the sun rises higher into the sky. The lake sparkles with the early morning sunlight, turning various shades of pink and orange mixed in with the natural blue. Soon the sun hits their faces and Dean closes his eyes in pure bliss, his head tilted slightly upwards to soak up as much as he can get. There is a content hum from his left and he turns just enough to see Cas’ lightly tanned skin glowing in the sunlight, his blues brighter than Dean has ever seen them before. Cas smiles, Dean returns it, and they stare at one another, content to sit as long as they like in the quiet morning light.
“Alright enough of this chick flick moment,” Dean grumbles loudly and is met with a collective laugh from the crowd. “Who's ready to party??”
Cas’ blue eyes fill with unshed tears and he hastily wipes beneath his glasses before they fall. “Do you really mean that?”
That’s not even taking into account any of the other many attributes Cas has. The man is wicked smart and has this sarcasm and sense of humor that Dean just absolutely loves. And his smile. God don’t even get Dean started on how mesmerizing Cas’ smile is. The man has a few that come out at different occasions. There’s the polite one that he uses with strangers, there’s the smirk that comes out when he makes one of his sarcastic remarks, and then there’s Deans favorite. The gummy smile that only comes out when Cas is really happy. His nose scrunches up and all of his perfect straight white teeth show. That one is rare but Dean has made it his goal to make it appear as much as possible.
It’s one of those days in the late fall where the sun still shines, keeping the temperature bearable before the harsh winter makes its way to town. There is a gentle breeze that blows by, picking up a few fallen leaves in its path. The air is fresh and clean. Some might say it’s a perfect autumn day… Castiel is not one of those people. He started his day running late, rushing out the door, barely remembering to grab his coat from the hanger. His coffee mug, however, was not so lucky to be remembered. The sad travel mug was left sitting on the counter for the rest of the day, slowly growing colder as time goes on.
Dean looks over and finds genuine concern in Castiel's blue (holy cow those are really blue) eyes. There’s no pity or disgust that Dean normally finds with people he sits next to on planes. Usually, the person sitting next to him ends up looking at him like he's a complete freak and can’t wait to get off the plane once it lands. Castiel doesn’t look like that though. Dean takes a few seconds to study the other man. He takes in the blue eyes paired with the messy dark hair. For how put together Cas always tries to be his hair is always a mess as if he can’t keep his fingers from running through it. Dean struggles at that moment to not do just that himself.
Before his thoughts spiral any more the bathroom door opens and Dean steps out wearing the most ridiculous pair of pajamas he has ever seen. It's a matching set, collared shirt and pants, with green and red stripes running down.
Since he’s already gone this far, he might as well play the part. Dean curls up on his side, facing away from Cas, leaving as much room between them as possible. Cas doesn’t say a word and continues to read his book. Dean tries his best to relax his body and let sleep overcome him but knowing Cas is only a few feet away has him on edge. It's not until Cas turns off the light, succumbing the room to darkness, and slides down under the covers that Dean is able to breathe a little easier.
Knowing Cas will be there in about fifteen minutes, Dean sets to work getting the ingredients for dinner ready. He decides on a simple pasta and chicken dish since he knows both the girls enjoy that and nobody can actually hate pasta. A pot full of water goes onto the stove waiting to be boiled while he preps the kitchen for the oven. Emma eats just about anything but Dean has found Claire to be a little more on the picky side when it comes to eating. He found out that neither of her parents are very good cooks or don't have the time to cook so they end up with a lot of frozen meals or take out. Dean gets the chicken in the oven and the stove turned on to boil the water when the doorbell rings.
“Are you sure?” Castiel really doesn’t want to sleep on the roll away but it would be rude of him to force it on Dean.
“Well, really there are two options here; you guys can come with us and we figure out some kind of schooling for you or you guys can stay here and continue going to the school you’re currently at.”
Apparently that didn’t work as well as he thought it would. People have told him that it only takes five minutes in the presence of both Dean and Cas to notice how deeply in love Dean is. They actually say how deeply in love they
“Don't want to hear it Meg,” Dean growls and he knows he just made a grave mistake, especially if the spark of satisfaction in Meg’s eyes is anything to go off of. He couldn’t help himself though. The last thing he wants is to relive the moment that changed everything for him. Dean looks away trying to blink back the tears threatening to fall. Some of his emotions must show on his face though because suddenly Meg is frowning and looking at him confused.
Dean sees two men standing together in zookeeper uniforms looking at the entrance expectantly. The shorter one has light brown hair that would rival Dean’s little brother’s hair in length. But the other man. He really catches Dean’s attention. A little shorter than Dean himself, but still fairly tall and a mop of dark hair that is just begging to have fingers run through it. When the class gets closer Dean is met with deep blue eyes that almost seem to glow. Dark hair and blue eyes? Dean is so screwed. That's not even mentioning the other features this gorgeous man is blessed with. A strong jawline, a full pair of soft lips, and a body Dean can’t seem to take his eyes off of. The shorter man clears his throat pulling Dean out of his trance and when he looks over a knowing smirk fills the man's face. Dean feels heat make its way up the back of his neck from embarrassment at being caught and turns back to the blue-eyed man. Of course, that didn’t help at all. Blue eyes squint at him with a slight head tilt which has absolutely no right being equal parts incredibly attractive and adorable.
Dean lifted his eyes and found Castiel’s etched with apprehension and adoration and something else, something like longing. Dean whispered, confirming what Castiel seemed to be asking, “You weren’t supposed to hear it that way.”
Following instructions, Castiel deposited each item of clothing into a pile outside the door and pulled on the pants and tee-shirt, pausing for a moment because the shirt had the same strange balloon design that some of the posters at the coffee shop did.
Castiel watched as Dean tied some rope to the monster dog and led him out of the door. So humans had domesticated monsters now, interesting, he thought.
Castiel may not know yet why the Angels fell, why he landed in a field in Kansas, or how a cafe mocha brought back his Grace. But he did know, without a doubt, that he could make a home here for good, here with Dean and coffee and Led Zeppelin.
“Heaven, yeah. Okay, finish putting your clothes on and we’ll go to my house. I’ll help you wash them and give you something to wear in the meantime. Sound good?”
In the end, it’s Jack and Rowena who team up to save Castiel from the Empty. She’s always had a soft spot for the kid, wouldn’t say no if he asked for a favor, even for this.
“CAS!” Dean’s voice startled him from his thoughts. Dean was hurrying towards him. “Dude you can’t just take your clothes off in public! What are you thinking?”
Dean says his goodbyes and points Baby in the direction of the bunker, but he doesn’t park her in the garage. Instead, he drives up a mostly dirt and grass path to a spot he discovered years ago, up on a hill and surrounded by evergreens, shielded from any prying eyes. From this position, he can make out the lights of downtown Lebanon, but they’re not bright enough to obscure the beauty of the night sky in all its glory.
When Dean finally speaks, his voice cracks in desperation but he can’t even begin to care. “Where is he?”
“Good, good.” Sam sniffs, trying not to tear up at just how good it feels to have Jack close again. “What, um, what are you doing here?”
On particularly difficult days, when Dean can barely get out of bed, Sam calls Eileen, and they pile in with him. And just be. Eileen never minds the tear stains Dean leaves on her blouse; she never lets go of Sam’s hand the entire time.
Dean lets out a shaky breath when Cas reaches a hand towards his face. He runs the backs of his knuckles over the apple of Dean’s cheek, opens his hand until Dean’s face is cupped in his large, warm palm. Cas smiles blindingly, gracefully and Dean is brave again.
Sam unplugs the WiFi and reroutes calls to Garth. Tries to make Dean happy with pie festivals and cold beer under the stars but the faraway, desperately sad look in his eyes turns hollow as the days go by.
Calmly, Dean turns so that he’s practically sideways in the seat, to face Cas, neck straining with the angle, but he doesn’t care.
The fourth time he brought the cup to his mouth, he took a much longer, heartier pull. Then suddenly he felt the tingles of his Grace seep into his new body. He gasped again, took another big gulp of the mocha, and felt Grace flood into him, radiating from his soul. He made eye contact with Dean just as he felt his eyes light up blue and glowing, his Grace fully restored.
“Whoa, hi. Okay,” Dean said, practically mowing Castiel over when he opened the door. “Guess I don’t have to tell you twice.” He released Monster Benny and grabbed his keys from a bowl by the door. “Vamos.”
Jack adamantly doesn’t involve Dean or Sam in the task, though. Doesn’t even tell them about it. Just asks them to rest. To live. To stay out of any frays. He calls it a forced vacation; Sam suggests the beach, but Dean says no.
He freezes, heart stuttering. That’s not Sammy’s voice. He’s out of the car, sprinting towards Jack, towards his
Dean sighs. “Night Moves. It’s Night Moves. Bob Seger. I’ll explain another time just - just please never tell Sammy.”
The lights in the cafe flickered, some of them blew out completely as his enormous wings filled the space behind him.
The man squinted at him in the sun. “You drunk or high or somethin’?” The man asked. “Know what, don’t care. Getcha a coffee at The Family Business. That’ll cure your hangover. Tell the Coffee Dean that Marlon sent ya.”
Dean gasped when their lips touched, and he pulled back quickly. He might have said something else, but Castiel was already falling into a deep, peaceful slumber.
Dean left Castiel to his own devices with the now-talking box that magically changed scenes when he pressed on the box in his hand. Humans had weird playthings.
Dean’s strong arms automatically wrapped around him to steady Castiel on his feet. “Whoa there, cowboy. You doing alright? How long since you last ate, huh?”
Dean gathered their plates to put away. “You’ll have to sleep on the couch though. I don’t have a guest room in this tiny place.”
Dean spills over his hand, burying his cry in Cas’s neck, and Cas holds him through the aftershocks, whispering praises and
Dean’s heart is beating out of his chest with nerves when Cas doesn’t respond, simply studies Dean’s face, tilting his head to the side a bit. Dean feels like his eyes are trying to bore a hole into his soul; maybe they are.
“Thank you, Dean,” Castiel gushed, hoping the conviction in his voice matched the gratefulness in his heart.
Castiel followed Dean, but instead of walking the reverse route to the cafe, Dean walked to a large, black car sitting by the curb.
Jack’s answering grin is like looking into the sun. “Then pray to him. He can hear you. When he’s well, he’ll come to you. You just have to ask.”
“Sorry, sorry. It was just the first song that - it’s just - nevermind. No, we will have a much, much better song. I promise.”
Cas’s deep, gravelly cadence fills the silence of the car, fills Dean’s heart with hope. It’s all he needs.
Dean’s been wiping the interior into a gleaming shine for half an hour when he hears the door to the garage swing open.
They’re all silent for a moment, and Dean finds he can’t stop the flow of tears any longer. This time, though, they are tears of relief, joy. He uses his sleeve to wipe them away. Sam reaches over and squeezes his shoulder, then stands.
“You- god, Cas, you’re a fucking Angel! Holy fucking shit. Sammy is never going to believe this! Wait, are you going to leave now that you got your mojo back?” Dean asked, looking slightly scared to know the truth if the truth meant Castiel was going to leave.
He had been patrolling one of heaven’s vast borders, far from where the spell was cast by Metatron. He had no warning, one minute he was walking along a pristine beach, the next, falling like a trapdoor had been released beneath him.
“Gotta run some errands, remember? Missouri’s isn’t far, but Jody’s is way too far to walk, plus I got to pick up large orders both places.”
He leans closer, eyes flicking down to stare at Cas’s plush, inviting mouth, his tongue darts out to wet his lips; he’s leaning closer before he realizes it, but so is Cas. Their lips finally brush softly, in a whisper of a kiss that feels like coming home.
“So, what brings you by? Not that you need a reason. You’re always welcome here, kid. Just - everything is okay, right? Is there - do you need our help with something?”
Dean doesn’t have to wait another second before the familiar sound of wings beating through the air fills the car. He closes his eyes with a blissful smile.
The man raised his eyebrows. “So, is this where I ask you if it hurt when you fell?” He asked with a chuckle.
Running his hand through his own come, Dean grasps Cas’s cock in a tight fist, swiping his thumb over the head after every couple of strokes. Cas gasps into Dean’s mouth as he claims it once more with bruising, biting, enthralling passion.
“I’m an Angel, Dean,” Cas said, throwing his shoulders back and letting the shadow of his wings pass into the human’s plane of existence.
“C’mon Cas, let's get you out of those clothes,” Dean said with a wink before nodding towards the hallway with his head. “Follow me.”
“You - you, too,” Dean counters, dragging the trenchcoat down Cas’s shoulders, wishing he could just rip it to shreds. “Can’t you just - like with the - shoes?” Dean says between bruising kisses.
He reluctantly lets go, but not before ruffling his hair a bit, for old time’s sake. The gesture makes Jack grin up at him.
Dean presses warm, lingering kisses into Cas’s chest. For a second, Dean thinks this might be a dream; he surreptitiously counts his fingers; his senses ground him, pulling him back from panic’s razor edge, where he never wants to be again.
The moon is full tonight, beams of light bouncing off the hood of the car, illuminating its interior in a white-gold shimmer.
