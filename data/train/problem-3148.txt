She nods, notebook pushed against her chest. She pulls her pen out from behind her ear as he walks away. He can hear her ask for the rest of the orders before the bell above the door jingles and he's breathing in the cold damp air.
me, Dean. Angel, remember?”
Leliel hisses at him. Their eyes screwed closed in pain and disbelief. Somewhere a bird is singing. Cas feels his gut twist.
“Yeah, Dean. I know. But running off after the concept of witchcraft isn’t going to get us anywhere. You need to follow our plan.”
Kevin orders three lamb gyros and turns to Sam. “Okay, what do you guys want?”
“Like Cas seemed really… stiff, or something. And he left right away.”
{-_-}
Double take. Walk back.
So she just texted him.
He is. Or he’s not in the common areas, at least. Dean gets in the shower and cleans out the scratch marks down his back, breathing measured through his nose.Cas’ hands had been where his are now. Had raked down his back and pulled him closer.
“Cas woke up. End of story.”
, and all thoughts Dean had fly out of his head.
“I think Cas and Dean pissed each other off again. Or something.”
Because it isn’t true, but it is massively more tangible than the thing that is happening, unbidden, inside his grace.
Dean pulls a face but he doesn’t argue. Sam isn’t wrong, he doesn’t much look like the academic type. But he could probably pull off ‘guy taking a feminism course to get laid’ if he tried hard enough.
, Des had asked the table as he stormed off.
“Cas!” Jack crows as the man himself enters the room. He bounces on the balls of his feet, waiting for permission to get swept up into a hug. Cas gives it with a nod and a lopsided toothy grin. “You’re okay!”
“Ah, I don't know. Sometimes I wanna be outside for big talks, a little easier to breathe.”
“Not really.” Cas says, dry. Sammy laughs and Dean ignores the lump in his throat. It might not be a dig, Cas doesn’t like angels. They’d betrayed him and hurt him and manipulated him and lied to him—
“Sam. Impala. Now.”
“So then what’s the issue?”
Dean lets his calloused finger brush up against the tugging skin, rough against rough, weathered against weathered. Skin against skin.
The chant echoes on.
go into the woods call that penis mysterious
“Dad and Momma…” Cas smiles for the first time in what feels like years. There’s so much warmth in his gaze. Dean feels like he’s doing something right.
“Days?” Cas repeats, unshifting.
, and what gets Dean isn’t the pain or the pleasure or the warmth— it’s the knowledge that Cas just

“You know, that protest is really mischaracterized by the media even today, it ends up being dismissive and —”
“—And none of them seemed to have any complaints!”
Sam gestures in a vague direction and rubs at his eyes.
Kevin trots over, already imagining holding something warm and wrapped in tin-foil.
“I would prefer not to. Is it a problem— to eat cake in a park? I wasn’t aware.”
,” Sam says, shooting him a look over his shoulder from the front seat.
Eventually the waitress arrives, hair exploding from the damp air.
The room is silent again, but he can hear Cas shifting in the bed, and it’s one of the best sounds he’s heard in a long time.
“Can I go ask Sam what he wants to be called?” Jack asks, waits a moment and then clarifies, “Are we done our talk, Momma?”
Clearly, Dean was going to have to do some research about what the qualifications of ‘true loves kiss’ were. Cas was
Cas nods, a smile peaking through his expression. “Thank you for your efforts, Sam.”
“Dean it is
Sometimes, before Cas had been magic spelled into a coma, Dean would lay there at night, phone open to the screenshot he had taken on a hunt they had all gone on to Saint Louis.
“Are we taking Kevin? Since he is actually student age?” Sam asks with a pointed glance at Dean’s wrinkles.
well equipped.” Sam says, a hint of smugness sneaking into his tone, “Plus, who knows! You may even learn something.”
Normally he’d settle those things with a hunt. But Sam thinks they don’t even know what specifically they’re hunting (it was pretty obviously witches) so Dean couldn’t really count on a good session of kicking the shit out of something. Sam was being overly cautious about the whole thing. Since when had it been important to know the exact flavour of the monster they were killing before they set out? Having a home base had spoiled him.
“Well, Momma it is then.”
Jack is looking at him, awed. Embarrassed. Not quite paying attention to his question, caught up in Dean’s earlier statement. Dean turns to Sam, who's doing a bad job hiding his surprise. Dean raises his eyebrows emphatically.
“Dr. Westchester!” a student is running up to them. She has half green, half blue hair divided down the part and a nose ring. “I wanted to apologize for everyone back there. I'm sure lecture will go smoother next week. Takes a bit to get into the swing of things with a midterm teacher switch. Don't take it personal!”
Cas latches onto Dean’s neck and
There’s a family sitting kitty-corner to Castiel in JJ’s County Diner, somewhere in the cornfields of Iowa. They are eating a late lunch. At least, it’s after two, a time Dean considers late for lunch. The sky out the window is an almost startling blue, stretching on and on and on above the flat earth.
“I have a knife,” Kevin says. He has had lessons, on what to do with it, even. He’s used it for things he doesn’t like thinking about.
.” Hairs raise on Dean. His arms, his neck, his shins. “I don’t care about the fucking tie.”
“That almost got us kicked out of the room, Dean
. Weaving its way into his tendons and slithering up his arms. It isn’t about the pent up energy coiled in his muscles and it isn’t about the vibrations he feels lancing through his bones every time he takes a step. Everytime his naked skin brushes against something warm or something soft or something living or—
“We don’t. Dude’s busy.” Dean growls.
Dean snarls. Strides closer to Cas, fury making his joints stiff and his hands hot, “You think that’s what I want Cas? That I want to fuck you—?”
The worst part is how instantly he feels the absence of Dean’s voice, and how badly he wants it back.
A horn honks, breaking him out of his thoughts, and he realizes he’s wandered into a parking lot. One of the countless rectangular buildings that dot suburban landscapes. In this case, a Wal-Mart. Light from the glass front doors floods out onto the wet pavement. He’s drawn in.
“Okay, Cas. Let’s get you cleaned up.” It takes a moment to stand. His joints are unhappy with him for this one. He slings Cas’ trenchcoat over his arm and holds out his other hand to help Cas to his feet. Cas takes it without a second thought.
Dean grits his teeth. ‘True love’s kiss’. So fucking stupid. And from the looks of it, a total lie. The lore
“You need to know at least the basics. You’re coming into this course two weeks late. What if they ask you something?” Sam says.
He wasn’t cut out for this, and Jack deserves better. The thought settles in all of a sudden that he’s older than his dad was when their lives fell apart. And he’s here making the same mistakes. Dean gets a little more why his dad cut a demon deal and died. Hell was easier than this.
“I took Sam to the car, like you said.” Cas says this plainly, flatly. But there’s something in the way his eyes linger on Dean’s face that isn’t quite as smooth as normal. Something jagged that sticks to him; the serrated edge of a hunting knife.
“Um, like Texas America?” Harris says. At this time, a child nearby shrieks, and they both turn to see a goose extending its wings in threat. And when they turn back, the bench is empty. Only the flimsy white cardboard of the cake box flapping sadly in the damp grey wind, plastic fork still stuck deep in the green icing.
Sensationalist reporters flocked. As they tend to do whenever something that looked kinda culty if you turned your head and squinted sprung up. This one really didn't take that much squinting since… well. It was a cult.
“If you’re gonna deface it, commit,” Dean says, and Kevin looks up in bewilderment to see him digging in one of his coat pockets. He slides a pocket knife across the table. Kevin looks to Sam, because this strikes him as the sort of thing he’d protest to, but he’s just digging into his falafel wrap and side salad without a care.
It’s brutal and savage and unhinged. His feet skid across the gore on the ground and he hasn’t felt this untethered since hell herself laid a razor in his hands and crooned at him to start slicing.
Jack sits up straighter and leans over the table, worry creasing his brow, “Dean? Are you in shock? Do you need a blanket? It didn’t look like you got hit that hard… Maybe some water?”
“Dean. What happened?” Sam has that pinched look around his eyes, sympathy weaponized.
Dean’s soul and Cas’ grace were already… well acquainted. Grabbing the soul of a struggling righteous man with a knife and teeth–who hadn't felt a kind touch in forty years–was a dangerous undertaking.
“Dean. To save his life, man. You
“Do you remember when we went fishing?” Jack asks after some quiet.
She wilts a little. Hm. He smiles toothily at her and she bounces back, energy back up to the top, curls bouncing around her face.
“Hey Dean.” Jack smiles, a little hesitant, “Would now be a good time to talk?”
Cas cleans his angel blade off with his trenchcoat. He’s panting a little, head reverberating with the cries of Dean’s baby inside him. They aren’t reacting in the physical sense, but emotionally. Cas can tell this child is a pacifist. That may not go over well.
Cas loosens under him, fast and thoughtless as he murmurs against Dean’s neck—breathless.  “Come on, come on, come
Cas doesn’t need a flashlight, but Dean and Sam cast weak, yellow light over rotting plant matter, slick spaces where the puddles lay in shadow and never really dried up. The snow had left the woods ages ago, but the melt lies heavy on the remains of last years’ fall leaves.
He scrubs the back of his hand across his mouth. He wads up some toilet paper and cleans off his wrist.

at him for saving his life. Pissed at him for not getting the kiss over with sooner, for not waking him. What the
“So it wasn’t so you could—?”
All Dean can think about is the electric tingle of where he had elbowed Cas, and how the man is breathing beside him.
“It was different, dude.” Sam shrugged. “Like he shit his pants or something. Which he didn’t, because he’s an angel, and they don’t do that. To my knowledge.”
He cuts off. Cas looks him dead in the eye as he dispassionately finishes Dean’s sentence.

. His fingers moved against the current of the shower and stroked over his marked neck. He feels his dick twitch at the memory.
Well. He pauses on that thought outside the kitchen door. Imagines running a sponge over the inside of his brain before stepping through.
“Are you okay?” Becca asks.
“I’ve been hunting since before you were born, twerp. I can read the signs. It’s witches.”
“You guys are saying ‘plan’
Dean doesn’t know where Cas is at. He stops talking.
Dean nods, “Okay, babe.”
CLAIRE:
“About what?”
/////
He stops thinking about it. Maybe Sammy was right. He did have a few angelic qualities about him.
Sam wanted to spend the night at the motel they already paid for, but Dean needs to drive. After heading back to the motel to grab their bags, he drags Sammy out to the Impala. The big baby rubbing at his eyes and complaining, words already slurring a little.
Dean nods and suddenly the room is empty. He’s been able to avoid this the last few days. Sleeping on his own uncomfortable chair through the hours the others went to sleep. But now it’s him and Cas and a big empty room and the idea hanging over Dean’s head that their first and only kiss will be a confirmation of everything he’s ever been scared of.
And now, during their sexual congress, Dean’s soul had gotten far too close, and dragged its fingernails across the furrows it left years and years ago. It gathered together Castiel’s trailing grace, like a magnet sweeping up fine iron filings. Alive and thrumming. A little ball of combined soul and grace, grace and soul. The bond between them was too strong. It might have been okay if this was the first time. It
“Well, if the professor wasn’t prepared to talk about this stuff she shouldn’t be the one teaching the course—!”
“Ew.” Dennis mutters, looking up from his mop and bucket. “Why?”
off for a moment. Sam's mouth tightens and his eyebrows pinch, but he doesn’t say anything.
Sam makes this face when he gets indignant. Righteous and wrinkled with a twitch in his mouth and a swing in his hair. “In what way?”
It starts in a diner, unassuming. Sam glued to his laptop and Cas gazing out the window like he does. Sometimes Dean wonders if he can see stuff they can’t—well, he knows he can, but he wonders what that stuff is. What lurks on the outside edges of his gaze in ways Cas is familiar with? In ways Dean can't even casually daydream about?
“Cas.” He says, rough.
Dean and Cas sit there quietly, Jack unaware of the strangeness and Sam pointedly not mentioning it. Dean cannot hear them, the ringing in his ears dull and loud.
“Oh!” Jack nods and tugs and Dean’s sleeve, “Well let's go then! It’s a big talk for you too, right?”
“Maybe he likes geese,” Harris says faintly. “And there’s a lot of geese in Springbank, also.”
“No. I made them inaccessible from the inside.”
thot we were dead? you thot WRONG
“We got the MILFs. Cult dealt with. Let’s go home.”
“Oh come on, Sammy. Like you dont wanna be peepin’ no toms tonight.” Dean laughs, shoving a stake of myrtle through his belt loop. He tries his best to put on the Samwise Gamgee accent, but the joke seems to fly past the two of them. He glances over at Cas across the motel room, who seems pretty entranced with a carved panther they found at the scene of the last disappearance. It’s some sort of sparkling sharp rock and Cas looks at it like it holds the secrets of every universe.
“Ah. Someone shoved ‘em at me earlier. Thought it would be faster just to take ‘em.”
It’s unbearable.
plan,” Dean snaps.
“I’m not moving.” Kevin says, staring straight ahead and still pouting. “Let me have the leg-room Sam. I had to sit with your brother through a women’s studies course for two hours. They talked about sexuality today. Let me have this. “
So he’s baking. And it isn’t because he’s stressed. He just wants to bake. He
“Then yes.”
Dean blinks and does his best not to let his disappointment show in his face. “Jack!”
She has dimples and little smile lines around her eyes. She seems kind. Dean thinks she’s served them before, once or twice. Never the whole family, though. She glances at Dean’s closed menu— a sure sign he's ready to order. She blinks her brown eyes at him.
“No. I locked him in.” Cas stays standing where he is.
The worst part isn’t the taste of bile or how raw his throat is, the way it feels like swallowing glass.
He digs around in his pockets and holds out a fistful of shiny brochures of students smiling on a campus that clearly isn’t this one. Kevin still has his face covered, so Dean nudges him with the bundle. Kevin makes a noise and goes to swat Dean away before he notices what he’s being nudged with.
“Maybe we should check homeless shelters?” Dean suggests.
“This okay?” Dean asks him, and Cas is almost afraid to answer in case this isn’t what it seems like. But the possibility has him aching, shaking where he stands, so he nods.
The following afternoon, after closing up early and spending a few hours online with increasingly fruitless Google searches, Dean realizes that he’s not going to get anywhere without more information. He doesn’t particularly feel like bothering an octogenarian, so there’s really only one course of action that he can see.
“What’s her name?”
“Yeah, okay,” Dean says at last, and looks back at Castiel. His hands shift at his sides, shoulders raising slightly in the prelude to a hug that never comes. “Try to get some rest on the way, yeah?”
“I might not have
right, Castiel knows. This could never be anything real, anything lasting, no matter how much he craves it. Still, he tilts his cheek into Dean’s palm, relishing it for as long as he can before he meets Dean’s eyes. Wide and green, and sad. So much sadder than Castiel would have expected.
From: Sam 11:13pm Dude I found him!
“Wanna keep you,” he blurts without thinking. He feels Cas smiling.
“Yeah, and we would've figured it out! After!” Dean spits back. “
“Won’t argue with that,” Dean mutters, and grins when Castiel flushes at the words.
“Are you sure? Was there anyone else on the crew that could’ve been--”
He taps the question on the notepad, and Parker swallows convulsively as he nods.
,” Agata says to Bartłomiej, and they both look at Castiel for a long moment before she holds out her hands.
By the time Dean is fully aware of his surroundings again, Castiel is sitting against the wall on the other side of the coffee table, knees bent and spread apart as he rests his elbows on his thighs, watching Dean carefully.
When Castiel had finally arrived home late last night, fingers and nose numb after his long walk back from the hospital, there was a message from Ellen waiting on his answering machine. She’d nearly filled the whole tape telling him what she and Bobby had learned from Dean’s trauma therapist. How they’d been told to prepare space for Dean in their home. What they’d been told to avoid.
Lieutenant Novak was awarded a Medal of Honor and a Distinguished Flying Cross for his service as a pilot.
Dean’s phone chimes with a message before he can reply. He holds up a finger as he digs it from his pocket.
The nearest sign of life are some distant cars driving along a parallel road, and no matter how fast he moves, Dean knows that he’s never going to make it all that way without stumbling. Even if he made a break for it, the moment John catches up with him, he’d have no way to defend himself. Unless…
“It’s like four in the morning, Cas,” Dean says with a quiet sigh. “Course I’m tired.”
“I assume you’re not suggesting we tell the truth,” he says.
“Probably around noon? I’ll bring Sam here right away.”
He doesn’t know how he’ll look at anybody. He doesn’t want to think about how people will look at him. The people who know what happened will pity him; the people who don’t won’t understand all the things that make his body lock up in fear.
“I prefer strategist.”
The door scrapes against its frame as it opens, and the sound of Sam snorting in derision is the first thing Castiel hears clearly.
“Huh. I dunno.”
. Point taken.”
“Wardrobe malfunction,” Dean offers, and Castiel tilts his head at the term before shrugging as if to say,
“Over there,” Dean whispers, pointing again. “See?”
Against his thigh, he can feel Castiel’s cock thickening, and he pushes against him a little. Rolls his body forward so Castiel stutters out his name and pulls him back onto the bed. Leaning down, he takes advantage of their new position to scatter kisses over Castiel’s chest. When he runs his tongue over a nipple, Castiel’s hand rises to tug in his hair. Dean closes his lips over the taut flesh and sucks.
Castiel lifts his brow. His palm presses against Dean’s chest.
He smiles, hopeful and desperate as he raises a hand to Castiel’s cheek.
“They’re not the only people in this city,” Castiel tells him, and looks away when he sees the flush spreading across Dean’s cheeks, because though they both know that being apart is going to suck, it’s not something that either have acknowledged out loud. Even the thought of voicing his fear that Dean will forget about him is enough to make his throat close up. “Have you decided whether or not to take Bobby up on his offer?”
“You gonna see her again?”
Parker shakes his head.
"Do you remember Hell? When you found me?" Dean asks, his voice strained as he starts to move again, dragging out and slamming back in, over, over, over again.
These days, the first page is held in place by several strips of yellowed tape, each layer added when the previous one started to come loose. In the back, there’s an empty pocket where a library borrowing card used to go.
“No, don’t— don’t go.”
“Or maybe we
It’s temporary. It
“Then fine. Hit me.”
Splinters dig into his skin as he drags it into the house, and every step he climbs makes the whole thing groan in protest under his feet, but it holds together. He makes it all the way to the top without incident.
But Dean is quick to shake his head.
Dean gives him a look, and Castiel blanches when he realizes why. He seriously considers just letting himself sink to the bottom of the lake.
They’ve already been doing this for a couple of minutes, Castiel dropping increasingly obvious hints and meaningfully swinging the keys to his truck around his index finger, but Dean just doesn’t seem to get it.
“There’s intent in the feeling, and direction in the name, even if you don’t speak it out loud. It’s not like mind reading—it’s less solid than that, less structured—but when you… when you have craved my presence, I have felt it as clearly as if you had prayed to me directly.”
Won’t monopolize this loss and force his son to downplay his own grief just to keep them afloat.
He seems to like it when Castiel tries to save him, just so long as he doesn’t succeed. It’s almost as though he’s afraid of what lies on the other side of salvation; like he’s convinced that becoming human again will hurt him in ways he’s currently immune to.
“We can’t all sleep until noon,” Sam says, eyeing Castiel’s mug as Dean downs half of the contents in one go. “There’s a fresh pot in the kitchen.”
“She said it would what?”
Dean’s eyes lift to meet Castiel’s, and there’s a shade of reckless humor in them. Something devious and endlessly irritating that makes Castiel want to throttle him for making him wait, even now, when they’re supposedly not doing that anymore.
“That’s not exactly comforting, Cas. Remember what happened the last time we tangled with a cambion? Kid turned you into Fiscal Responsibility Ken, and he really didn’t want to turn you back.”
Dean’s already got the jacket in his hands, along with a duffel bag full of newer records that he thinks Castiel might enjoy, when he glances down and realizes he’s wearing the sweats and stretched old AC/DC t-shirt he threw on after his shower. The last two times he’s been back, they’ve been too preoccupied with the absurdity of the situation to leave the apartment, but now, given time to get used to the whole time travel thing--as much as he figures either of them could ever get used to it--there’s a possibility that they’ll head outside.
“Garth ends up on the weirdest friggin’ cases, man.”
“Have you looked him up?”
He looks around at the others, and is met with little more than helpless shrugs and frowns. Jules looks as though she has an idea for a half a second, then shakes her head.
His back is bowing, legs shaking, and as he stares at Cas he wonders how he got to be so damn lucky.
Before he has a chance, Dean’s palm settles on his arm, warm through his thin shirt. It makes his breath catch, just for a moment.
Castiel arches with the sensation, so Dean does it again, again, until Castiel pulls him back to his lips.
In the end, it takes almost forty minutes of detailed explanations before Parker finally stops his relentless pacing and sinks, defeated, into his armchair. It’s longer than they would have liked, but altogether less time than Castiel might have reasonably expected, considering that they had to inform this apparently lapsed protestant that angels and demons are not only a real and present threat on Earth, but that his old acquaintance is currently pregnant with Lucifer’s child.
“Don’t be. I, um. I don’t mind.”
The impact knocks them off course, but they pull back quickly, and when Castiel asks if anyone is hurt he gets eight replies in the negative. The ninth never comes.
“Ophaniel was here for a very long time. I couldn’t bear the thought of allowing all his years of guardianship go to waste just because he was pulled away on a suicide mission by your God.”
Transcript/description of image:
As they'd walked, he'd briefly wished that he'd been heading home alone. The thought of lounging on the fold-out sofa with Cas for several more hours suddenly seemed agonizing. He'd give anything to be back there right now.
Any hope of telling him what he would have done is lost as Dean’s lips alight on his chest again, so instead he touches Dean’s hair, sinking his fingers into it and holding on. Dean’s hand comes up to rest on top of his own almost immediately, and the touch is encouraging. He’s not sure
“Yeah, but,” Dean huffs. “Look, can we just—”
“People who are... capable of maintaining mature relationships."
sorry about this, Cas. I really… I'm sorry things aren't different. I am. But it’s gonna be a lot easier on you if you just try to move on. Don't put this on Dean, okay? For all of our sakes.”
being the operative word. Lucky for him, Dean is too oblivious to notice.
Pulling open the fridge, he pushes a bottle of ketchup aside before his eyes fall on the small package of meat wrapped in butcher’s paper. He unwraps it and sighs at the miserable sight.
“Deep breath,” Castiel says, and demonstrates, his cheeks puffing out almost comically until Dean manages to follow his lead. “Come on, come back upstairs.”
“Oh, and Castiel—how are you feeling? Are you doing okay?”
Despite Dean’s mouth having already been wrapped around him, it’s only when he feels the soft skin of Dean’s bare stomach pressed against his own that he truly realizes how enormous this moment is for them. How intimate this is. He supposes it must be something primal, something animal, wired into the genetic makeup of his body. Something to do with the most vulnerable part of themselves, their weakest points, exposed to one another willingly.
“You know the most fucked up thing? I had the thought today—just for a second, but… I had the thought that you could just make him forget he ever knew.” Dean doesn’t look back at Castiel when he says it. He doesn’t need to. Castiel can sense the shame rolling off of him like heat waves from a desert highway. “Maybe he’s right. Maybe I’m not cut out for this relationship shit. One bump in the road and my first instinct is to ask you to mindwipe my own brother.”
“What are the chances that she’s an unusually friendly angel keeping an eye on things?” Dean asks, playing the video for the eighth time in case they missed something when they watched it in the diner booth. Though his tone makes it clear he’s under no illusions that they’d be so lucky, Castiel points out the unfortunate reality that any of the few angels still living would have destroyed both Kelly and the nephilim on sight.
“It’s okay,” Castiel tells him. “You don’t have to talk about it.”
- I’ve started making fanvids, and I’d love it if you checked out the first one I’ve posted! It’s Dean/Cas and it made me cry while I was making it. More to come :) https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ4GqnsZalWHJAxwse4xnTA
Dean stares at him for a moment, a smile twitching at the corner of his mouth, before finally huffing a laugh and kissing him again. His hand slips lower as he speaks.
“Cas, I’m not exactly light.”
It’s much the same as all the others in the bunker.
The tape he made for Cas was different. He knew Cas liked the songs, and he loved them himself, but it wasn’t even about the songs so much as about what each song said. What each song meant. Every track was another line of his confession. Every note was another reason why he’d decided to take this risk.
“You’re such an ass.”
, and I— I— I felt it, all the reasons, and the way— and how much you—”
“You do. Admittedly, the other times I’ve heard you sing, you’ve been doing it to make fun of yourself or someone else. But you weren’t doing that just now. Your voice is quite lovely.”
Dean’s breath catches, and he hurries into his room. He starts at the corner closest to the door, prying the carpet up from the floorboards. There’s nothing there.
“Is everything alright, Dr. Thompson?” Dean asks.
Castiel looks at him for a long moment, wondering what he’s done to deserve such kindness.
“Yeah?”
“But?”
“My plane was--” Castiel starts, but has to stop. Has to swallow back bile at the memory of plummeting, of finding Daniel. The man seems to understand, though. He shifts the firewood in his arms to pat once on his own chest.
When Castiel stretches a hand out to the other side of the bed, the sheets are cool beneath his fingers. It reminds him of the last time he woke up like this. That morning feels a lifetime away now. In a way, it is.
The spot Dean leads him to takes closer to twenty minutes to reach in the dim pre-dawn light, scrabbling over uneven limestone and fallen branches, but when they arrive Castiel is glad he didn’t go back to sleep. It’s beautiful. The lake is calm with barely a ripple on its surface, and several sycamore trees stand in the shallow water near the rocky shore. Castiel guesses the lake must be a little higher than usual after several rainy days over the past week.
John’s paranoia has reached such a fever pitch that he’ll likely shoot anyone who comes close to the door. No matter how Dean plays it out in his head, calling for help means certain death—for his would-be rescuers, or for Dean, or for John—and even after what John has done, what his delusions have made him do, Dean can’t be responsible for any of that.
“How did I do what?”
“Honestly, I’m not sure that I care about that one way or the other,” he admits. “I think I just… like people. I’m still figuring it out, I guess.”
“Do you have any idea—” he asks as he finally reaches out to trace reverent fingertips over Dean’s hips, dipping into his navel and back down to the soft crease of his thigh, “—how extraordinary you are?”
Castiel is already pulling it over his head and handing it over before Dean can finish.
Castiel suspects that Parker’s encounter with the demon who came here is the only thing stopping him from discounting every word they’ve said.
“Too effective.”
He takes a photo of the sculpture and after a moment of deliberation, sends it to Claire with the caption;
But now—the feeling draws out longer than usual, shifting to something closer to hunger, to desire, and Dean’s fingers flex a little in Castiel’s hand. When Castiel starts to pull away they turn to gently grip him back. And this…
“Am I low on—”
The way he says it is carefully detached in a way that makes Dean’s stomach sink lower than it’s already sitting. Jack has given up. Dean thinks that maybe he has, too.
to explain what kinds of activities a roomy shower might enable. “You’ll still show me what you meant later.”
“Thanks,” Dean grins, and practically bounces from the bed to go retrieve them. Castiel leans on his side to watch him, propped up on one elbow. When Dean glances back, he doesn’t look away. Dean puts his hands on his hips, raising his brow as he turns to face Castiel fully. “See something you like?”
“Do I need to remind you how my parents were killed?”
“Why? Because I’m in love with you?” Dean flushes. Clears his throat. Castiel rolls his eyes. “Believe me, Dean. I’m more than capable of recognising your flaws.”
Castiel’s voice is strained, barely above a whisper.
He’s glad of it tonight. One way or another, things are about to change, and he doesn’t want his father’s gaze upon them when it happens.
Even now, he’s beautiful. Castiel aches.
“Of course. You were the first person he asked about.”
Their father had been furious, but ultimately made no effort to reclaim either. Castiel hasn’t seen him since Hael’s funeral.
“Any change?”
“It’s fine,” he tells Sam. “I’ll meet you all back at—”
Technically, a demon. 👹
“No, Cas. I’m not mad.”
“Oh.”
He’s terrified that even if he can determine which of his thoughts and feelings and actions are his own, he has no way of knowing anyone else's. He’s terrified, because maybe Sam leaving him behind for Stanford was the only real choice his brother ever really made. He’s terrified, because he can’t know if Cas ever truly chose him over Heaven, or if Chuck just thought it would make for a bit of added drama.
“I want you to. Even if it’s just tonight, I want you to.”
“What do you—”
instead of
“But,” Castiel continues, and Sam’s brows shoot up toward his hairline.
, Dean. C’mon.”
he’d said, but now… watching his way back collapse in onto itself, he feels numb. If he gets trapped down there, if his way back is gone—
you?”
“You see something? Where?”
“Nah,” Dean says stupidly, immediately wishing he’d taken the out.
How his fledgling soul ached every day that they’d been apart; how he’d realized, finally, that this thing between them was love.
“Is everything okay?” Castiel asks, and Dean’s head whips up comically fast, his eyes wide.
“Could be,” he says. “Only one way to find out.”
, of course he is—but there’s an odd little falter to his smile, and despite all his better judgement Castiel feels his heart pound a little harder. He has to ignore it for his own sanity, and he’s about to make a snarky retort—something along the lines of
“It barely hurts,” Castiel reassures him when he doesn’t say anything else, and Dean glances up with a doubtful look in his eye.
“It’s not a rumor,” Dean tells him, raising his brow. “It’s true. They have to print it on the packet and everything.”
“Somewhere in the United States,” he says. She lifts her brow and returns her gaze to Castiel.
Standing with his back to the stockade, Dean stares across the bustling Moondoor Market, watching as Charlie stops beside a stall where a cute girl with elf ears is selling enchantments. The dress he made for her looks perfect, but he can hardly manage to appreciate his work.
“Are you sure?”
“Really?” Dean lifts his brow.
“Nothing more important to do?” he asks, and immediately hates himself for it.
“I thought they were flies.”
He’s floating somewhere outside of himself, secure in a way that is wholly foreign to anything he’s ever known, when Cas’ voice floats into his awareness, rumbling soft and perfect against the skin of his throat.
“I don’t know anything.”
Squirming a little with the compliment, Dean tightens his grip on the steering wheel and stares hard at the road ahead. Castiel tilts his head.
“What the frakk-- Dean.
“I can’t help it if you’re more interesting to look at.”
He heads for the truck, opening the door and ducking inside to rifle through the clutter behind the passenger seat. It doesn’t take long for him to find what he’s looking for underneath his winter jacket and the bag of books he’s been meaning to return to the library. The giant package crinkles when he pulls it free.
“This isn’t resting,” he says, but makes no effort to stop, instead sliding his hands up under the hem of Dean’s shirt to grip him more tightly, skin to skin. Dean’s teeth close briefly around his lower lip at the touch.
When Henry passed away shortly after, Dean found himself the sole beneficiary of Needle and Thread and the small apartment above it.
“Not saying I’m not interested, Cas. I, uh. I’m very interested. Just…” He looks at the wound again, a pained expression on his face. “Staring at the evidence of your near-death experience is kind of the opposite of a turn on for me.”
Sam nods.
Dean snorts.
“Yeah.”
“Yeah,” Dean says, nodding as he shifts forward to slot one leg between Castiel’s, using it to pull him closer as he shows Castiel how to make it good. “Like this.”
“It was… it was Chuck, I guess.”
It’s like being in the alley in Colorado all over again. Castiel can almost smell the stale beer and garbage. It makes his stomach turn.
, he thinks suddenly, but the thought cuts off almost as abruptly as it came, and when he kneels beside the tub to test the temperature of the water, he feels the uneven tile digging into his knees, and it feels about as real as anything else he’s ever felt.
“I’ll still apply, okay? I’m still gonna try. But like… I’ve gotta be realistic or I’m gonna lose it.” His jaw twitches as he looks out the window at the passing landscape. “I’ve been looking around, and there’s this trade school in Wichita that has a whole course on restoring classic cars, so I dunno. Maybe that could be a cool back up plan. Bobby’s trained me well enough that I already know I’d be an okay mechanic, so I could probably keep taking shifts with him if I wanted. I’ve just been thinking about it.”
“I said
it. Needs Cas to fix him with that look he gets when he’s assuming control of a situation, and take Dean wholly out of himself for a while. To free him from the burden of being in control.
Castiel doesn’t have the words to tell him that he feels as though he has, so he kisses him quiet, and squeezes Dean’s fingers where they’re still wrapped around him. It’s not long before Dean helps send him over the edge, and his back bows, and his lungs burn, and he spills over Dean’s fingers.
His voice echoes.
“Only hands,” Castiel tells him.
Through Cas’ grace, still rolling through him like Cas has forgotten how to reel it back in, Dean sees everything.
“It seems likely. I’d hoped that Ramiel was the last that we’d have to deal with.”
“Do I look like a plumber to you?”
“I am Ruqayya. These were my children.”
Castiel laughs, shaking his head, and heads toward the bathroom. It’s humid when he steps inside, and his blue bathrobe is hanging from the hook by the mirror. The wide bathtub—used for storage by the Men of Letters, and untouched by any of them as far as he can remember—is filled almost to the top with steaming, peppermint-scented water. He stares at the tub for a long moment, trying to recall when it was restored to its true purpose.
Castiel doesn’t bother to suppress his eye roll at Dean’s knee-jerk sarcasm, and from Sam’s flat reply, he’s not the only one who’s tired of it. He suspects that even Dean is tired of it, if his recent tendency to give honest responses even when they’re difficult is anything to go by.
Dean does the math in his head, lips moving as he works through the numbers, but when he reaches an answer he frowns and seems to start over. Castiel doesn’t blame him: it seems like an unreasonably long time.
“No, but when she arrived… I got the impression that the one who brought her was in charge of the others. One of the security guards complained that they were behind schedule, and she just… she gave him this
“No, I’m not.”
He’s completely absorbed in it, quickly flipping pages at a rate that suggests he’s taking advantage of his angelic side in order to read faster, but as soon as he notices Castiel watching him it gets tossed to the side, forgotten.
“I didn’t say anything.”
burger place for dinner. So maybe the diner is a better bet. What d’ya think?”
He doesn’t wait for a reply. Doesn’t even pause to see if his assumption that Castiel understands his meaning is correct.
“Okay,” Dean nods, and walks closer, stepping right into the middle of the kitchen. “I’ve got a couple of good steaks in the fridge.”
“I want it too, Dean,” Cas says, trailing his fingertips back up over Dean’s hips, lifting the black t-shirt he’s wearing underneath the shirt. Dean feels his stomach muscles twitch and jump with the attention. “All of it. I’d like to give you what you want, if you’ll let me.”
“Gonna show you,” Dean says finally, and pushes Cas back against the door firmly enough to make it rattle in its frame.
Dean’s hands clutch at Castiel’s sides, trying to pull him ever closer despite the fact that their bodies are flush, and when Castiel tilts his chin down to break the kiss Dean lets out a pitiful sound.
“I haven’t even begun to flatter you,” Castiel tells him.
“That shit’s what killed my Grandpa,” Dean says, and looks back over his shoulder into the apartment. Downstairs, he can make out the sound of people talking--of Henry talking. He shakes his head. When he looks back around, Castiel is frowning.
With slitted eyes, he makes his way out into the kitchen and gropes around in the cupboard for his favorite mug before realizing it’s sitting where he left it on the dish rack. He fills it and trudges downstairs.
. The past is fixed, and free of the risk that he’ll break himself hoping.
The branches scrape his skin, gouge into his cheek as his chute tangles itself in the trees. He aches all over. His face stings. He looks at his blood where it’s smeared on the damp leaves and heaves in a breath, wiping at his face with a gloved hand.
Rubbing at his tired eyes, he taps out directions and receives a dancing woman emoji in return.
Dean sings along with the crackling radio as they drive, and Castiel makes a show of threatening to change the station whenever he gets too obnoxious about it. He feels carefree in a way that he hasn’t since they were just little kids, almost giddy with this simple weekend of freedom that’s stretching out before them.
“We used to hike out here together. All four of us. Hael always wanted to try to bring tadpoles home, but Michael--”
“That’s what I said.”
“And Dean?” Sam prompts.
“Did you leave your message?”
“Too long,” Cas agrees, and stares down at the table. It’s scuffed and worn, like everything else in this room. “I wish I’d understood. I’d much rather be there.”
,” Dean parrots, closing his eyes and leaning the back of his head against the window, arms crossed over his chest. One handed, Castiel reaches into the back seat to grab his coat and jacket. He tosses them onto Dean’s lap.
“No,” he says, too fast and firm to be convincing. His eyes dart to the floor, the wall—anywhere to avoid looking at Dean or Castiel directly. “She hasn’t called again.”
The radio clicks off with the engine, and the sudden quiet pulls Dean from his sleep as effectively as an alarm. He squints his eyes open, rubbing at his mouth with his knuckles as he looks over at Castiel.
Though, he admits inwardly, sitting out here while Dean presumably asks the others where he’s gone isn’t a whole lot better.
“Fine, fine, the sleeves stay.”
“Before I was born. He reached out to me, and I sensed him, and I felt my mother telling me that I should trust him.” Jack shrugs and sniffs and wipes at his nose with his sleeve. “I wanted to be like him, so… I made myself like him.”
“You’re gonna kill me,” Dean says, his voice tight as Castiel presses his teeth into the warm skin of his left pectoral, strumming the pad of his thumb over Dean’s right nipple as he does.
“Then how exactly are you here?”
At all hours, he’s calculating time differences.
“The Impala is fine,” Castiel assures him, making his way back around to the passenger seat so Dean can take over for the last leg of the drive to Danville. “I was just thinking of my truck. It seems I do have an attachment, as you said.”
“Seems more likely than having a swarm of flies on his jacket,” Sam snarks. “Listen, I’ve gotta finish grading these papers, but I’ll make a couple of calls tonight, see if there’s any records I can access through the museum.”
At some point between Dean falling asleep at nearly one in the morning, and stopping to refill the Impala’s gas tank at the Pennsylvania-Maryland border around half-past four, Castiel’s thoughts of satisfaction and contentment had turned to the way Dean and Sam live. How they save the world constantly, but rarely savor it.
The grass is awash in the pink and gray light of dusk, a few birds swooping low to catch bugs. Around the forty yard line, Cas is paused halfway through a stride, looking up at him.
Castiel does. This time, the touch of his lips is brief and soft, and his hand skims down over Castiel’s chest before he pulls away. When Castiel opens his eyes again, he’s alone.
“I shared many years with him here,” Ruqayya says. “And now that he’s gone, I will continue to guard this tree in his honor, as will my children.”
It’s difficult to focus on what Dean’s saying as he strokes and squeezes, but when Castiel understands his meaning, he settles his hands into Dean’s hair and pushes the short strands back. Makes him tilt his face up a little so that he can see his eyes, a thin band of green surrounding his wide-blown pupils.
“So you won’t mind if I take a look.”
“As soon as we got back from Colorado. Can you blame him?”
With one elbow on the open passenger window, she leans in to slot one of the still-developing photos into the sun visor pocket.
“You're sorry? Why didn't you just stick to the damn plan?”
With a snort, Dean returns to his lunch, and they’re quiet for a while, just enjoying the soft susurrus of the river and the warm, dappled sunshine. Dean’s stretched back, leaning on his elbows with his eyes closed when Castiel speaks again.
_____
John hits a pothole, and a sharp shock of pain drags Dean unwillingly back to consciousness.
“Just a couple days.”
“I mean, I don’t— I’m not looking for a play-by-play or anything, but just. I know it’s gotta be harder. Like, how did you even get to that point with a guy without being scared you were gonna get clocked in the jaw?”
Leaning against Dean’s door frame, Castiel crosses his arms and raises his brow.
“No, don’t worry about--”
He glances up at the door again, firmly shut at the top of the stairs, and tries to buy into the illusion of safety.
“You give me too much credit, Cas.”
They only pull apart when they hear Sam’s voice echoing through the bunker.
He sees his own lips, blush-pink and parted on a breath.  He sees Cas’ hands, pressed to Dean’s sweat-damp collarbone. He sees the two of them together, the way they are in this moment, a glowing, swirling mass of soul and grace, intertwined and beautiful. Cas’ grace, wrapped around them both like wings. His own soul, reaching toward Cas as though they’re still not close enough.
. Now, Cas stares at that message for so long that the screen times out and goes dark, and he has to tap it back to brightness, again and again.
He thinks of Dean’s face back by the campfire as Castiel had healed him, and of Dean’s prayer, and knows exactly how to do it. Flattening his hand on Dean’s stomach, fingers spread wide, he holds Dean’s gaze.
“I promise.”
“I guess,” Dean says, casting a wistful glance over at the lake anyway.
As he lies curled on his side in his sleeping bag, waiting for sleep to pull him under, the faint sound of Dean strumming the opening bars of
“Relatively,” he says, and swallows the candy before he has to taste it any longer. “How are you?”
The ground is steep and rocky beside the bunker, and by the time it levels out Dean is breathing heavily. A little way ahead, through the sparse trees, Cas can make out the shapes of Sam and Mary and Claire, and two other women who he guesses must be Jody and Alex. They’ve set up a small fire pit, and from here Cas has to focus to hear them talking. Mary is telling Claire and Alex about the first concert she ever attended. Jody is whispering something to Sam that would make Cas blush if he let his guard down. As he glances over at Dean, catching him staring right back, he’s tempted to do just that.
“You couldn’t have done anything.”
It’s a ridiculous form of jealousy. He’s beholden to it regardless.
be okay. Everything will be okay. Everything will be okay.
“What if you’re wrong?” Castiel asks him. It’s a dangerous question, but he needs to know.
Dean throws up into his own lap.
“I thought you went back,” Dean repeats, and he sounds angry. Hurt, as he pulls back to meet Castiel’s eyes, gripping his shoulders in both hands. “I thought I’d never see you again.”
“What year is it?”
“You did not just ask me that,” he says, leaning forward to rest his forehead against Castiel’s knee in defeat. “Fellatio. Jesus Christ.”
“I’ll drive you back, Cas,” Sam says, snatching the keys right out of Dean’s palm. Dean looks just as bewildered by it as Castiel feels.
“Obviously not,” Castiel says, and gets to his feet. “I don’t even know you.” He blinks, face paling so rapidly that Dean’s almost worried he’s going to pass out. “And you’re a man.”
He frowns as Dean crosses the floor. Even the way he walks betrays his anxiety—limbs stiff, each movement strangely measured as he slides into the other side of the booth. It makes Castiel deeply nervous.
“What on Earth is a laptop?”
Castiel’s eyes settle on every single reminder as he moves around the space, and by the time he heads into the house next door, he’s awash in memories that he’s barely allowed himself to think of in years.
“Cas.”
Choosing this motel was a wise decision, he thinks.
been trying to impress him, after all. “Do you not recall the time before that?”
“Why do you have a bulk pack of instant ramen in your car?”
The Scarlet Oak Motel is not a new establishment by any stretch, but the L-shaped structure seems to have been well cared for, and the hedge that lines the parking lot is lush and green. One of the trees the motel is named for towers beside it, bare branches spreading wide across the rain-wet parking lot.
“Just… didn’t wanna… we should do it like this, yeah? This time, I mean. Want to see you.”
He doesn’t think in days; he thinks in Volkswagen, Honda, Chevrolet, Dodge.
“That was all?”
“You really think that?”
Dean does, and Castiel braces himself on his hands as he slides his knees under Dean’s thighs, encouraging Dean to bracket him with his legs before he leans down to kiss him slow. He lets his grace skim the boundary of Dean’s soul as they kiss, sparking with every sinuous roll of his hips against Dean’s.
“Can I— do you want me to—”
sick?” he asks, the words almost lodging in his throat before he can get them out, and Dean’s eyes widen before he frantically shakes his head, grabbing hold of Castiel’s shoulder.
It’s the end of the week before Sam contacts him with news.
? Really?” Dean cuts in, and Castiel looks over at him.
He ditches her when she gets a call from one of her spell-related suppliers, and regrets it almost immediately when Cas comes to find him killing time in the school coach’s office.
“So… sorry, why exactly are you miserable? Are you just Deaning all over a good thing for no reason?”
“We should go check on Sam, yeah?” Dean asks him with a shaky smile, and Jack nods as he moves away, offering a hand to help Dean to his feet.
“Hello, Donna. I’ve heard a lot about you.”
“No more than yours must be,” Castiel tells him.
Shrugging, Dean picks up his coffee and takes a sip.
He imagines the tables turned, hearing those words spoken aloud—at last,
“Well, you’ll be comfortable tonight at least. You’re in room five, right down on the corner—and if your fella ever admits he needs a painkiller, there’s a little drugstore about a block and a half south.”
“Sorry,” he murmurs. “Wanted you to come first, but—”
They drive for nearly two hours before Dean gets hungry enough to suggest they start looking for a place to stop, and ten minutes later Castiel pulls onto a rocky patch at the edge of some woods.
he thinks, and blinks.
“He’s waiting outside,” Sam tells him before Dean has to ask, and pats him on the back. Dean doesn’t bother to say anything else, lest he ends up triggering a whole other discussion.
“This is untenable,” Castiel supplies, and Dean nods.
From: Sam 11:14pm Get on Skype so I can show you.
“Yes.”
“Keys, Cas.”
Reluctantly, Dean nods.
, Dean had told him, and Castiel is glad for this chance to tell him that he is. To reward him not for his restraint, but for being brave enough to ask for what he wants despite how difficult he finds it.
There’s a clatter, a rattle, and then the door is yanked open behind him, Dean staring down at him red-faced and furious. Castiel pushes to his feet and takes a step away.
“I—“ he shakes his head. “I was just cleaning. And I didn’t sleep well. That’s all.”
Scouring the shelves, he pulls out a few more books. He’s got more than a dozen stacked in a haphazard tower on the table by the time Dean makes his way into the library with his duffel on one shoulder and a weapons bag on the other.
“You went to break things off,” Charlie guesses, her tone laced with pity. “Oh, Dean.”
“So the first time I turned up here--”
“He’s the only one whose first name starts with D,” Sam says. “And it looks like him in the picture. There’s a guy whose last name was Deveraux, but he was short and dark haired and probably in his early forties, so I don’t think that’s him.”
“So, will you come home? I mean, it’s technically your apartment, too.”
Thrown a little off-balance by Castiel’s response, Dean just looks at him for a few seconds before a flush creeps up his neck and onto his cheeks. But he doesn’t ask any more questions. Just says, “Yeah, okay,” and does as Castiel asked.
right, why would i worry
“About what? You desperately trying to bring me home?”
Castiel ignores him, deliberately suppressing his body’s near-instantaneous attempt to flush as he continues, “—not to mention actually procreating. But demons and deities aren’t beholden to any such dogma.”
“No,” Castiel insists, approaching him until they’re only a few feet apart. This close, he can see the sparks under his skin. Like a struck match. “You don’t want to fight me. You never even bring a weapon that could hurt me.”
Dean frowns and thunks his head back against the brick wall a couple of times. He clicks his teeth as he looks back at Castiel.
Every kiss he presses to Cas’ mouth is another confession he can’t find the words for; it’s
The first time he saw Cas was something else entirely. He was pissed at the guy for leaving him like that, for confessing his love in his dying breath, for pretending like Dean was something he “knew he couldn’t have”. Dean was ready to blow his lights out when Bobby mentioned he was here.
Instead, he takes a deep breath and reminds himself that he’ll never get a better chance to speak his mind than now. “Cas, I–Me too.” It’s all he can get out before feeling the throbbing beating of his heart in his whole chest, his lungs closing up, but he has to push through, just this once, right now, because what is he even scared of, exactly? “I love you, too.”
“We’ve been through so much together, you and I, and even though we haven’t been together like
Now, though, sleep is just another pastime. No need to recharge if you’re permanently plugged in and at full power, right? There’s no need for sleep in Heaven. However, Dean likes to keep it in his daily schedule as an escape to normalcy, to just pretend he’s still on Earth and trying to fall asleep in some shitty motel room bed with Sam snoring a few feet away.
Despite everything though, Dean settled in easily enough. Being dead, he discovered, doesn’t hurt, and Heaven has proven to be accommodating enough so far. There’s not much that doesn’t materialize the instant he conjures it in his mind. The weather’s always pretty nice and Baby purrs more beautifully than she ever has on Earth. A bunch of his friends are here, and Dean tries his best to enjoy hanging out with them without thinking about
It’s so effortless and natural, Dean wants to punch himself in the face for thinking it was impossible, that it would always be this unattainable dream, the one thing —
“Let him go,” Dean snarls without acknowledging her words, trying to ignore the aching pain in his chest that he’s not sure is real or just being inflicted on him telepathically by Meg. The Empty. Whatever.
“Backdoor.”
Even now, countless kisses and touches later, Dean can barely believe that he finally gets to have this, even if only in death. Post-life, as he sometimes calls it because Cas hates being reminded of the fact that Dean is dead.
“You’re wondering if I were ever married before—before I married you?”
Castiel smiles and turns off the lights. He carefully lays his hand on top of Dean‘s, softly wrapping his fingers around his sweaty palm. He lets his fading grace work its magic and makes sure to protect Dean from any more haunting dreams for the rest of the night.
Cas shakes his head. “Don’t be. I wasn’t going to keep it secret from you, I just didn’t think of mentioning it.”
Leaning his head back and closing his eyes, Dean felt the car come to a stop. The engine was suddenly quiet, but when Dean opened his eyes back up to check what was going on, Cas was all over him already.
Cas is warm and Dean feels like this is exactly where they should be, together, always. Dean breathes in Cas’ scent, the faint smell of the impala, and he feels right at home.
“Do you remember,” he tries again while Cas waits patiently for him to continue. “Do you remember that time you—you tried to kill me? After Purgatory?”
for a very long time yet, I just feel that...
“But… I know it’s fading, but–”
Ash scoffs. “Oh, we’ll see about that.”
Castiel needs a moment to take a good look at Dean, not his face but his soul. Something is different. It‘s dimmed, shining not nearly as bright as it usually does, restless like the beat of Dean‘s heart. A dark shadow is looming over it, draining all its light and color. Castiel can feel all its distress and pain like it was his own and he mentally promises himself right then and there not to let Dean suffer like this again. “Are you okay?“ he asks quietly.
Dean sighs, finally breaking eye contact. “It’s just–I couldn’t get my head out of my ass and you just accepted that.” Cas’ face relaxed, silently encouraging Dean to continue. “All those years, you knew, and you–you just let me treat you like… It wasn’t fair.”
But Sam’s not here and Dean is still getting used to the feeling of not keeping a gun underneath his pillow, not even a knife. Not that he’d need any kind of protection up here, not that anyone or anything would even dare to come close, but even if he did, he’s got Cas right next to him to fight off any danger without breaking a sweat.
Everyone—Ellen and Jo, Kevin, Pamela, even Kelly—welcomed him with open arms. Said that they’d do it again, that they didn’t want to see Dean’s face for at least another forty years, and then they put their arms around him and told him they were still happy to see him again.
The sight of Cas in the driver’s seat—Dean’s seat, usually—absolutely did
“This has been going on for a while,” Cas states and Dean doesn’t tell him he’s wrong. It’s not an accusation because it’s true and they both know it. Cas must’ve been putting up with Dean’s shit for a while without saying anything, just waited for Dean to talk about it but he never did. “Please.”
“Dean, there’s few things I regret more than—”
Dean had never sobered up so fast. He stopped breathing and he was pretty sure his heart stopped beating, too, at least for a moment. A thousand thoughts ran through his head while at the same time, his mind went blank. He jumped up from the armchair, his glass held tightly in his hand, and turned around to make sure nobody was playing tricks on him.
Dean smiles down at it, at the ring around his finger that he wouldn’t trade for his life, and its identical counterpart on Cas’ hand. He remembers dragging Charlie to the store to help him choose something Cas would like, explained to her that it couldn’t be anything boring or plain, it had to be perfect because Cas didn’t deserve anything less than that. Charlie just rolled her eyes and told him to go with his gut feeling because he knows Cas better than anyone else and yeah, she was probably right (don’t tell her Dean said that).
The second time he died landed him right where he is now, even though Heaven used to look much different back then. The walls have come down, what once was just reruns of one’s happiest memories is now a place to make new ones. In a way, it’s just an extension of life on earth, or at least the good parts of it. Dean still drives around in the Impala every day, but instead of going off to fight monsters he goes to visit his friends, his family, everyone he failed to save.
It catches Charlie’s attention, but only barely. She flickers her eyes up at Dean for maybe two seconds and flashes him a quick smile, then goes back to staring down the computer.
Castiel thinks, the words on his tongue, but he’s not sure if Dean wants him to say anything at all. He knows that Dean gets nightmares more often than not, knows the way he tosses and turns and wakes up covered in sweat. He‘d never let Dean know that he checks in on him sometimes because he‘d just try to re-explain the concept of personal space that Castiel thinks he‘s finally starting to grasp.
Turned out, Cas was just as angry with him. Maybe even more, which Dean should probably have expected considering that Cas had given his life for Dean’s only for Dean to kick it on some random hunt a few weeks later. He showed up at Dean’s doorstep and didn’t hesitate pushing him into the nearest wall, his voice low when he growled, “What the
“Naomi, she—she made sure to prepare me for every possible scenario. She knew that if I had to choose between the tablet and you…” Cas trails off and the end of the sentence goes unsaid.
Cas looked so effortlessly good and he wasn’t even
Dean sharply blows air out of his nose, resembling a snort, or maybe a laugh. Then he shakes his head. “That’s not enough.”
“Watch your step,” Ash says just in time for Dean to trip over several boxes full of wires, cords, cracked screens and other tech stuff Dean can’t even begin to name. He steadies himself on the closest wall and is glad none of the other two saw him nearly fall over.
Cas needed Dean to understand that he is not the person he makes himself out to be, that his negative side isn’t what defines him, and maybe Dean is starting to get it. In a way, he really did everything out of love. He loved his brother so much that he went to Hell for him, he loved Jack so much that he defied God for him and he loved Cas so much that…
Raising his head just enough to meet Cas’ eyes, he squints at him slightly. “Yeah, why?”
he’s ever been, and he’s accepted that but Cas, god,
Dean’s hands retreat when Cas moves to sit up against the wall, hand clutching onto the back of his head, eyes finding Dean’s again. Still wet and tear tracks across both of their cheeks. Dean can still feel himself shaking, his heart beating out of its chest.
“He...says hi?”
Moral of the story is that Dean should know better than to let Cas drive his car, but oh well. It’s sometime in the late afternoon, less than a week after the night at the campfire, when Cas suggests another drive. Dean can’t help when the memory of that first time instantly enters his mind. “Sure, sweetheart,” he mumbles, presses a kiss to Cas’ nose and heads out first.
He yawns and rubs his eyes with one hand. Without the need for sleep there no real feeling of being tired either, so Dean’s body must be just faking it. He brushes away the hair from Cas’ forehead and presses a kiss to it.
With his eyes fixated on the little box held tightly in his hands, Cas tried to wipe all doubts about this from his mind and collected himself, turning his body toward Dean and finally meeting his eyes again.
Something flashes over Cas face, if Dean didn’t know better he’d say it was a moment of anger, like he was mad at Dean for saying it’s okay and for letting attempted murder slide like he just stole Dean’s favorite toy. He doesn’t get to think about it for too long because that expression leaves Cas’ face as quickly as it entered it. “I’m sorry.”
by someone like Cas, wholly and selflessly and generously. The only thing Dean knows for sure is that he will spend the rest of his life trying to give back to Cas what he gave to him. He feels at peace.
One feeling Dean didn’t expect to experience was embarrassment, but here he is. Get raised from Hell, stop a biblical apocalypse—twice, at the very least—fight not only the Devil but God himself, only to be taken out by a couple vampires wearing clown masks. He deserves every single joke Charlie and Kevin make about it. Hell, he can feel himself slowly reaching the point where he might joke about it himself. He’s not there yet, but he’s one his way.
The library was a bit of a mess after he made Sam help him triple check every single book there was, desperately looking for a way to free an angel from the Empty. They found nothing useful, only a handful of spells and rituals that they figured might possibly work, but only ended up being another dead end.
Cas always sees the best in people.
to Dean. His eyes fixated on the road and just occasionally glancing over at Dean, one arm resting where he lowered the window and the other in his lap with his hand at the bottom of the wheel. Dean didn’t know whether to mentally punch himself in the face or pat his back for convincing Cas to ditch the coat and just go out wearing a t-shirt because Cas’ biceps and triceps and whatever it’s called had the tent in Dean’s pants building up faster than he even realized.
Holding Cas tight in his arms is usually the most comfortable he gets, and it helps him fall asleep faster than he can count two sheep, but not tonight. Cas shifts again, then stretches his legs and finally raises his head to look up at Dean with heavy eyelids.
Dean took the box from Cas‘ hands and put it into his lap, hesitantly, before finally flipping open the lid. Inside was a small glass vial, barely as big as his pinky finger, filled with a dimly glowing blue smoke. Attached to it was a small black feather and a thin black leather string, all delicately placed on a tiny pillow.
Dean doesn’t have to rack his brain for the detailed memory because that sure as hell was a day he couldn’t forget if he tried. He remembers all that happened and what he said, he just never knew his words had a real effect. “And I meant it.”
Dean felt a stinging pain in his chest. “A few months? And you’re stopping by just now?“
. Cas’ lips are warm and chapped and Dean can feel Cas’ wet cheeks against his own and when Cas finally presses back, Dean releases a breath he’s subconsciously been holding.
on his tongue but managed to keep his big mouth shut this time. He didn’t know whether it was because his brain-to-mouth filter decided to work for once or because his raging hard-on was distracting him from saying dumb things. “I’m sorry,” Dean eventually said for the third time.
a little bit tighter.
Dean nods in understanding. “Huh, interesting.”
, just—just give me the interesting parts. The cliffnotes version, please.”
This time Cas definitely stopped breathing. “Dean,” he breathed.
He looks up at Cas, a sad smile on his face, looking down at Dean like — like it’s the last time. Dean’s stomach turns. The black goo forming on the wall on his right extends a tentacle-like arm towards the door, across the whole room, past Cas and right at Billie, fully engulfing her in itself. Then it starts to rematerialize and takes up another human-like shape and if Dean didn’t know better he’d say it looks like… Meg? Demon Meg?
Dean couldn’t take his eyes off Cas if he wanted to. His knitted brows, watery eyes, chapped lips. It would be so easy to lean forward and close the little distance between them and just kiss him. It would be so easy to grab the back of his neck and pull him close. It would be so easy to kiss him the way he should be kissed, and Dean wants to do it, every cell of his body is telling him to do it, but Dean has never been one to take the easy route.
What sparked the explanation in the first place, you ask? Well, Dean was straddling Cas’ hips, bouncing on his cock like there was no tomorrow and moaning a variety of pet names like prayer while Cas said nothing but Dean’s name in various pitches, over and over. Of course, he then made the risky decision to ask Cas why he never used any nicknames for him, so naturally, Cas went ahead and dropped the bomb like it was nothing.
Speaking of, Cas starts stirring in Dean’s arms the second his name crosses Dean’s mind. He hums sleepily and nuzzles his face into the crook of Dean’s neck, one arm slung across Dean’s chest and the other lost somewhere between their bodies. Dean lazily plays with Cas’ hair in a way that he knows won’t wake him up, the other hand stroking up and down Cas’ side (carefully though because he knows how ticklish Cas is).
“Amara thought that, in order to establish a true free will, divine beings have to stop getting involved in human matters. Angels can no longer walk the earth as they wish,“ Cas explained. “Jack agreed, and so did I.“
The cracking of the fire is a pleasant background noise that fills a comfortable silence between them. Cas’ hand is resting on Dean’s thigh, stroking it with his thumb in a calming manner while one of Dean’s hands is resting on top of it. He feels Cas’ burning gaze on him but he knows Cas is gonna ask him uncomfortable questions if he looks back at him.
She continues. “That means it’s gone, Castiel. And I don’t take puny humans.”
Dean barely registered Cas’ thumb gently stroking his cheek until it’s gone and Cas’ fingers start cradling the short hair on the back of his head. Instead of pulling Dean close, however, it is Cas who leans in, his hand loose on Dean’s neck and leaving him more than enough room to pull back if he wanted to, because even now, of course, Cas is happily giving him the option to back out at any point.
“Remember what?” Cas prompts and that sweet tone in his voice easily convinces Dean that he can’t and won’t do this tonight.
She smiles at the mention of Jack’s name. “He told us good luck and to keep trying last time I saw him. He said he trusts us not to take advantage of it, if we ever got in.”
Cas ends the kiss abruptly, leans back and tilts his head as if he just had the realization of a lifetime. “Wait, did you—did Charlie tell you about my marriage to the djinn queen, too?”
explain to him how she did it in detail, but Dean zoned out halfway through and the pieces that stuck don’t make a whole lot of sense if strung together.
“Are you real?“ He finally asked.
Dean frowns for a second and seemingly forgets that Castiel didn’t really answer his question. “I‘m fine.“
Cas pitched the idea of going for a drive to the lake and Dean surprised both of them when he suggested that Cas should drive. There was no good reason for not letting him do it, right? What’s the worst thing that could happen, they swerve and hit a tree? They’d just get respawned back at home like this was a video game, and the totaled car would be good as new waiting for them in the driveway (according to Cas, Dean has yet to try it out himself).
It’s a lot. They’ve had their fair share of fights and arguments over the years, and they’ve definitely given each other more bruises and injuries than any best friends should, but
“Why didn’t you?” Cas asks quietly, reserved in a way Dean rarely sees him.
Eventually it’s Cas who sets up the perfect opportunity for Dean to bring it up. He’s been watching Dean for a while, kept an eye on him all throughout the campfire they hosted, frowned suspiciously when Dean dropped his marshmallow because he never drops his marshmallows. If he was in a better mood maybe he’d make a joke about how he wouldn’t be caught dead dropping his marshmallows.
He clears his throat and shrugs it off like nothing happened. He smacks Charlie’s arm softly and frowns at what looks like lines of code on her laptop screen. “What’s that?”
Charlie is silent for a second, then furiously types way at her keyboard before turning back to Dean. “Yup, him too.”
Cas fake pouts and it’s the most adorable thing Dean has ever seen. He physically can’t not lean over and kiss it right off of his face, their noses bumping together and the Cas’ scrubby cheek scratching Dean’s shaved one. Cas’ lips are dry as always and Dean vows to go out and buy him a new chapstick as soon as possible.
And the longer Dean thinks about it, the more his head hurts and his heart aches but more importantly, the more he feels like he can make sense of where Cas is coming from. Because really, of course he raised Sammy for love, of course he fought for the world for everyone he loves. Of course he cares, he cares so much that it drives him crazy sometimes, apparently he cares so much that Cas only started to care because of him.
Cas took a short moment to process. His face was glowing, eyes wide open, his mouth trying to suppress the biggest possible smile. He looked down to where Dean was still tightly holding onto his hand on his chest. “I could ask you the same thing.“
Dean’s heart just about bursts, explodes, and leaves him a smear on the wall. They shuffle back down into a horizontal position and Dean snuggles into Cas’ side (looking so invitingly pokable, but sometimes Dean does have some self control), throwing one arm over him and resting his head where Cas’ collarbone meets his shoulder.
Maybe it was the alcohol that gave Dean so much confidence. Maybe it was the fact that he already knew that Cas loved him, so Dean didn’t expect to be rejected. Either way, he knew he had to say something, had to do something, and took a few small steps forward, closing the distance between them to less than an armlength.
“Cas—”
“Let me explain,” Cas says and sits up. Dean watches him for a second before doing the same, resting his back against the headboard of the bed. He’s glad they’re clothed at least, even if it’s the ridiculous print pajamas they picked out for one another, because he genuinely can’t imagine being naked for this conversation. The cactus and and pizza print bottoms feel reassuring, grounding almost.
Charlie grins at him, then at Dean, then flips her laptop back open.
Cas is biting his lip, and it’s not the seductive kind. It’s a strange nervous behavior he’s picked up at some point, along with fiddling with his fingers in his lap and clenching his jaw. Dean lets him though, not like it’s gonna give him a headache later.
He’s still angry, and he’s pretty sure he’ll always have a thin layer of rage beneath his skin. It’s just one of those Dean Winchester things that even Heaven itself can’t fix, but he thinks he’s managing. Anger is not gonna bring him back to life, and he can’t be bitter about dying for the rest of his—well, whatever.
Desperately hoping to be bent over it and put in his place after dinner, Dean sets the table.
Dean takes a moment to find the right words. “I don’t know. One moment I thought shit, he’s gonna kill me and he’s never gonna know that I—you know,” he explains, assuming Cas knows whatever there is to know that Dean can’t say. Some times the word slips off his tongue more easily than others. “But then—I don’t know what happened, but it didn’t feel right to say it. Not like that, I mean, bloody on the floor of that damn crypt.”
Well. What an answer. Dean wants to show her just how ‘traumatized’ he is, but figures it might be for the best to just drop it. Charlie means well, even if she doesn’t know what the hell she’s talking about. Whatever. He needs to deflect. “How about Cas?”
“Yeah, Sammy called and I had to leave at the last minute. Pretty nice timing, now that I think about it.”
Cas moves to sit next to Dean leaning against the headboard, their fingers clasped and their shoulder pressed together. Dean’s mind is running a mile a minute, trying to process all that Cas just shared with him. He didn’t read the whole story Charlie’s computer gave him, skimming it made him feel nauseous enough.
, using her as its own vessel.
Somehow, they managed to find their way to the backseat with most of their clothes lost in the front. Dean was delighted to find Cas’ cock just as hard as his own and all the embarrassment from before went out the window (along with Dean’s pants that Cas threw out with a wink).
In that moment, Dean realized two things. The first thing was that Cas was a dumbass. He thought Dean didn’t love him back? How could he think Dean didn’t love him with all his heart the way he’d never loved anyone before? It might have taken him a full decade to come to terms with it, but Dean knew it was real. And even it wasn’t, which is a big fucking if, how could he think Dean didn’t still want him around? Cas was his best friend, his family. He’d always want him around, nothing was ever going to change that.
Cas didn’t break eye contact. Dean’s not even sure he breathed, but then again, he never knew if Cas had to breathe at all. Either way, there were a few seconds of thick, tense silence, both of them clearly wanting to give each other a piece of mind but didn’t know how to start. Dean eventually did. “I’m sorry.”
“Brainwashed, I know,” he cuts in. “But it doesn’t change anything.”
“No, Dean,“ he finally said before Dean could spiral even more. “It’s not that.“
Right now, the feeling in Castiel‘s guts is loud and clear, it’s like Dean is calling out for him, begging him to stay, trying to pull him back into the room, like Dean might as well be saying
“And at midnight he made a move on the host’s older brother.”
, and the desperate look on his face doesn’t convince Castiel otherwise.
Problem is, Dean rarely sleeps in peace. It’s not unusual for him to wake up in the middle of the night, heart racing and beating like a drum against his chest and consequently, Castiel’s ears.
Dean thought Cas didn’t have much experience kissing but
He thought about it for a short moment. “A few months, I suppose. Time works differently in heaven.“
It was hot and steamy and the backseat definitely wasn’t made for two grown men to get down and dirty, but whatever. It sufficed, and John Winchester would surely be turning in his grave if he saw Dean trying to get his husband’s cum stains out of the leather seats of the Impala later that day. Dean made a mental note to give Rowena a call so she could personally deliver the news to him.
, about as long as it took Cas to find him and help him take out the whole nest.
Cas was nervously looking around the room again when Dean didn’t say anything. “I hope this doesn’t ch-“ was all he managed to say before he was cut off by Dean‘s lips on his.
“Of course it does.”
was sure.”
He cups Cas’ face with one hand and strokes his cheek before pressing a kiss to his forehead. “Nevermind.”
“It probably wasn’t,” Dean agrees with a scoff, glad about the fact that Cas is so okay with this, apparently, “but you know how they are.”
Although, to be completely honest—Dean would do anything for that guy. There’s genuinely not a single thing in the world he wouldn’t do for him. He just wishes he’d had that chance on Earth, but it is what it is. He’s got Cas now and that’s all that matters.
Both of them were grinning, couldn’t believe how stupidly oblivious they were. Dean wrapped his arms around Cas‘ neck while he felt the angel‘s arms embrace his torso. He stroked the hair at the back of his neck and took in the smell that he had missed so much. They stayed in silence until Dean remembered another thing Cas had said down in the dungeon all those months ago. “I’ve always been yours to have. You marked me, remember?“
God, he was so stupid. There has never been a moment where he couldn’t have Cas, he was just too blind to see it. But Cas knew, or at least had a feeling, and it’s just starting to make sense to Dean. Cas knew he couldn’t have Dean, not because Dean didn’t love him, but because Dean didn’t let himself love him.
expect was for Cas to literally go for it, smash his lips on Dean‘s with no remorse and kiss him like there was no tomorrow.
. But Dean won’t be caught dead (he really needs to stop with these idioms) refusing Cas his comfort movie if it makes him happy.
Dean sighs. “This is fucked up,” he says because it’s the only thing he can think to say. He didn’t even know this shit was possible but here he is, once again underestimating his friends’ tech abilities. One thing suddenly crosses his mind. “I don’t know what Jack’s gonna think of this.”
Cas thought about how he enjoyed listening to the tape in his own car, playing and replaying it for hours because he didn’t have anything else and besides, he didn’t mind. It was personal, it was unique, and it was heartfelt, just what a gift should be. It didn’t take Cas much longer to come up with an idea then.
“Dean, please.” His tone is nothing short of desperate and Dean bites his tongue. He brought it up, so he’s just gonna have to listen. “The angel tablet was my highest priority. I was supposed to return it to Heaven at all cost.”
A full minute of silence passed before Dean spoke up. “Cas, this... is this-“
Dean is a dumbass who should’ve known that Cas would ask questions anyway. He doesn’t even know where or
