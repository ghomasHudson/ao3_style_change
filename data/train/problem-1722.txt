Turning around reveals to him an exhausted-looking Sherlock, swaying slightly on his feet by the dining table, hair a mess from a thorough ruffling and his dressing gown a fright of wrinkles.
He sighs, blinking the sleep from his eyes for a moment or two before turning his head towards the other side of the bed, further contributing to what is in all likelihood some truly magnificent bed hair. He’s managed to flop onto his back at some point during his sleep, and Sherlock, it seems, has taken up John’s previous pose on his stomach on the other side of the mattress, doing a more elegant job of it than John had, but still looking reassuringly ruffled for being unconscious.
Again, John finds himself caught between anger and sympathy. It was really, genuinely shitty of Sherlock to try to play games with fucking Moriarty, as if John wouldn’t definitely get involved one way or another. Alright, fine, he didn’t anticipate John getting kidnapped prior to the weird little playdate he’d arranged with a murderer, fine, Sherlock can be short-sighted like that sometimes, as can we all, but really … Even if the kidnapping hadn’t taken place, did he seriously think that John wouldn’t be affected?
And yet here he is, hesitating to touch John’s skin, despite the very real necessity of it in this particular situation.
“John?” comes Sherlock’s voice, carrying up the stairs, and drugged though he still appears to be, John suddenly realizes that he’s actually quite angry at the owner of that voice.
“Fuck you,” Watson spits out, obviously also taken aback by this development, enough to be at a loss for words, but not enough to shake his stance or loosen his grip.
The point was that silence had stopped bothering John, for quite some time now, but the way that Sherlock stared at him without speaking in the back of the ambulance, as John gritted his teeth against the medics cutting open his trouser leg to clean and stitch the wound, it left him unusually unsettled. No doubt Sherlock was rather in shock over the events of the evening too, even if he’d never in a million years admit it, but the fact that he’ll never admit it means it’ll just be that much harder to get him over it.
It was an unnatural silence that followed them from the moment of Moriarty’s departure and the disappearance of those dreaded red dots of laser sights mere seconds later; it clung to them even through the arrival of Lestrade and his team, and of the ambulance called to see to John’s leg, from which a knife had still protruded when the cavalry came. It clung like a parasite, like a tick, or some other clingy, unwanted thing.
So he falls asleep on a hard wooden floor, without blankets or pillows, sitting upright outside the room in which his injured friend lies unconscious, and he does so silently, lest he betray his own fears. John wouldn’t fault him for having fears, but it’s not about what John thinks, not really; it’s about the fragility of a persona, of self-perception and presentation constructed as a defense.
“John,” the man answers, with a tone that’s a bit hard for John to immediately identify, “You weren’t in bed.”
(There was this whole thing where I nearly died of blood loss because I didn't realize how bad it'd gotten until it was really close ... that might be making its way into my creative output as a therapeutic thing, cuz I don't really have another way of dealing with it, so uh, heads up, but I will warn y'all again if that actually makes it into this specific fic.)
In response to his failed attempt at speech, he hears the sound of footsteps on the stairs; Sherlock making his way to John’s room to ensure that his flatmate hasn’t in fact died, which would no doubt be extremely inconvenient.
And Moriarty knew that. He knew how surprised Sherlock would be to see John there, and that’s why he’d gone to the trouble.
John now firmly deposited back in the safety of his bed, he watches through increasingly bleary eyes as sleep creeps back up on him, observing Sherlock as he turns to leave John alone once more, not looking back as he opens the door, steps through, and lets it swing shut again behind him. John closes his eyes, expecting to hear the sound of footsteps upon stairs once again, this time in retreat, but the sound doesn’t come, stopping with the creak of floorboards in the hall.
Jim flicks his eyes up to take in Sherlock’s face, knowing that he should be able to just about half make out their conversation, but over the sloshing of water and the frantic pulsing of blood through his veins, the man is unlikely to make out every word. The situation is ripe for misunderstanding, and Jim has always loved a taste of the dramatic, the more fraught the better. He’s never shied from poking the beast.
Whether Sherlock had killed Moriarty or the other way around -because they’ll never end up working together, Jesus Christ, it’s hard enough for someone as straightforward and even-tempered as John to get on with Sherlock and there’s no way that lunatic Moriarty could manage it- it would still have been awful. It would have spread, like a cold, to everyone Sherlock’s life had touched. If he’d killed the man, he’d come out of it changed, John knows that. And if he, if Sherlock had been the one to be killed … Well, there’s reason enough that John had tried to prevent that, without even going into the number of other people who’d be left to grieve.
John had gotten away from the whole affair with a stab wound, and that was the best outcome he could have asked for. He’d been hurt, but he hadn’t really lost anything. He hadn’t but he could’ve done. Is that something that Sherlock could even recognize?
And with the very thought of the recent “excitement,” a new wave of exhaustion rolls over him, beating him down, and beating the conflict raging in his skull down as well. John’s bed is comfortable, John’s bed in warm, and John is safe, in both senses of the word. It’s as good a place to sleep as any, and a better place than most, so he heaves himself up out of the chair and staggers on rapidly weakening legs over to the unoccupied side of John’s bed, hauling himself into it and wiggling his way beneath the covers, where it proves indeed to be admirably comfortable, though he’s not as much a fan of these pillows as compared to those in his own bed.
Sherlock shoots him a light glare that feels much more like business as usual than anything has since the “game” with Moriarty began, but to his credit, he does step forward to take John’s arm and begin to lead him to the stairs. The matter of getting up them presents some difficulty and requires a change of position to John with an arm slung about Sherlock’s shoulders, hanging off of the man’s frame with a less-than-optimal level of grace, all the while struggling to keep his mug of water from spilling. Both endeavors are ultimately successful, but not without a close call or two- much as many of their shared endeavors go, really.
He still couldn’t help wiping his mouth with his shirt sleeve though, even as he pushed all thoughts of consulting criminals aside, and he felt the cold grey eyes of a certain consulting detective following the motion, still mired in that odd silence.
“I doubt you’d be able to throw me out in your current condition,” Sherlock notes with a gesture towards John as if to highlight the fluttering of the man’s eyelids and the nodding of his head as artificial sleep creeps upon him once more, “I doubt you could so much as walk without my assistance right now.”
He understands why; his feelings are, most would say, understandable, they’re just not logical, not clear and dispassionate, and that chafes like mad, leaving Sherlock feeling positively skinned. He has no purely logical reason, and yet his stomach had turned all the same at the sight; it turns even now as he merely reflects upon the event.
Sherlock had given a grunt of something like assent and John took it as good enough, hobbling off in search of a cab, which he would most definitely be making Sherlock pay for. They got home somehow, though John had evidently been well under the influence of medication by the time they arrived, given how little he remembers of it the next day when he wakes.
And there John was, fretting over Sherlock, who hadn’t a scratch on him, while he himself had a brand new knife wound . . .
And the man in question hadn’t been able to resist appearing himself in the flesh of course, much in the way that Sherlock hadn’t been able to resist attending in person, the risk of it altogether too tempting, a siren song . . . A song that ended the moment John came into his sight.
Pulling on a jumper and taking both the bottle of medication and cane in hand, John hobbles his way to his bedroom door with a grimace, jaw tight with a pain he’s doing his damndest to ignore, his steps more awkward than they’ve been since he and Sherlock first met. The handle turns easily in his grip however, and he takes a moment to be thankful that at least his hands are still fully operational as the door swings open into the hallway with a gentle creaking.
“Alright,” he’d sighed, addressing Sherlock as he heaved himself to his feet with a wince, “Let’s be off home. I’ve got maybe half an hour before I’m fully off my head on pain meds, and I’d rather I be in my own bed when that happens.”
He’s too tired, too tired to get his own pillow, too tired to worry about what John will say, dismissing this as a problem for the Sherlock of the future and not himself, so he rolls onto his side and flops an arm over on the mattress, near enough that long fingers can hook into the fabric of John’s shirt, soaking up the warmth of the man’s skin, feeling the pulsing of the man’s heart as it beats slowly in slumber.
Had he really thought that John could be kept out of it? That Sherlock could just set him aside, like some inanimate thing?
He hadn’t paid much attention to John Watson, viewing him as not too dissimilar to a handbag or some other accessory to Sherlock’s outfit, at least until recently, when it occurred to him how wonderful the fellow would look wrapped up in explosives, and how wonderful the expression of shock would look on Sherlock’s face. And oh, it had been satisfying, that split second where the man was forced to doubt the one person to whom he’d so unthinkingly given his trust, that split second where anyone watching could see his heart dropping like a stone to the pit of his stomach, pale eyes widening with an as-yet unknown fear. The fear of the unknown is always the worst. And it’s tremendously effective.
“What you say, what you imply, and what you mean rarely match up, Sherlock,” John grumbles, shifting about to find a comfortable position in which to spend the next few hours in drugged slumber, “Now, whatever you’re going to do, just do it, and kindly shut up.”
It’s hard to tell right now if he has such a spot in Sherlock’s thoughts. Sherlock has such a great capacity for emotion, for care, John believes it … and that’s probably why the man doesn’t care, or tries not to. To know so much AND be able to feel something for every bit of it? Who could stand that?
“Fuck, tell me that’s a promise, Johnny,” he sighs, loudly enough that this phrase at the least will be heard entirely clearly, suddenly jerking a hand free of the hold only slide it up Watson’s neck and grasp painfully at his short hair.
Imaginative phrasing escaped John as the medics saw to his leg, restraining himself from commenting on their work or demanding to take it over himself more out of exhaustion than anything, certainly more than politeness, as politeness felt rather superfluous so shortly after being stabbed. He’d have an interesting new scar to add to his already frankly impressive collection, no doubt, and no doubt Moriarty knew it too and would relish the knowledge . . . Moriarty, that was a train of thought that could bloody well wait until John got himself a decent meal and a good night’s sleep. The bastard wanted to be on his mind and John was disinclined to give the fucker the satisfaction.
It doesn’t escape John though, the way that Sherlock flinches slightly at each stifled grunt of pain that escapes John’s throat . . . If he didn’t know better, he’d say that someone is feeling just a touch guilty . . .
The instant distress on Sherlock’s face, glimpsed from the corner of an eye, is an inspiration, and Jim impulsively grabs John Watson’s hair once more, jerking his head up to face him before going in for what is quite possibly the most filthy, disgusting snog he’s ever been a part of. It’s all tongue and teeth and far too wet to be truly pleasant for anyone, but it sends a clear message, better than a basic kidnapping alone could.
“I’m sure that’s true,” the words are almost whispered into his ear, the mouth forming them at the perfect height to do so and the voice hard, unwavering, “but will they do it before I sever your carotid with my teeth?”
Lestrade too appeared to recognize the odd silence that developed and hung heavy like dank clouds around the two of them, for after ensuring that John’s leg had gotten medical attention, the man hadn’t even brought up the subject of giving their official statements, for once entirely content to let that go without even establishing a future date to come in to Scotland Yard. Instead, the man seemed to fairly flee under Sherlock’s stony gaze, appearing to take personal discomfort as well from John’s injury, as though battling some guilt on his own part. He needn’t have; John could think of a decent list of people who held some amount of responsibility for his wounded state, and Lestrade, while not completely off the list, certainly wasn’t anywhere near the top.
The “talk” would be worse, more upsetting for John, if anyone found them to have slept in the same bed, let alone while touching … But who’s to know? Only the two of them, with their respective excuses of exhaustion and painkillers, and perhaps Mycroft, if he’s gone to the trouble of installing cameras or other devices in John’s room. Sherlock’s not checked recently, not in here; he’s been far too busy with all the excitement.
He stares at John’s sleeping figure for a few long moments, taking stock of the man’s breathing -regular, slow; that’s good- and the furrow of his brow as he dreams, curled up under the blanket.
The question is whether to wake him and admit to having seen him vulnerable, or to walk carefully past, retrieve his water, and admit nothing . . . but while John’s still angry, and will be for a while yet, he acknowledges that Sherlock hasn’t exactly had an easy time of it either, and adding to it would be frankly counterproductive and more trouble than it’s worth. He’ll still get a verbal thrashing, but not until he’s had a decent rest and something resembling actual food to eat.
So much of his energy goes to thinking, every day of his life … If he is feeling, perhaps feeling guilty, no wonder he’s tired, no wonder he needs to sleep. And, it would seem, sympathy and concern win out, as they always do with Sherlock. It can’t be easy to live in that head, even less easy than it is to deal with the antics that said head comes up with.
So there’s all that, but then there’s also the here and now, where Sherlock is sleeping in bed next to him, arm outstretched, fingers entangled in cloth, as if dreading being parted. That or he’d been dreaming. John hopes not though; they can’t be very nice dreams. And he wants Sherlock to not want to be parted from him. He wants to be important to him, and he clearly is, enough that kidnapping him was worth the effort, but he wants more than that amount of importance. He doesn’t want to be forgotten or set aside. There’s so much room for information in that head of Sherlock’s, and John knows he can’t expect to take up much space up there, but he hopes to at least have a dedicated spot, somewhere not too far back, not too difficult to reach to.
“Oh,” he sighs as if in disappointment, “but I’m afraid something has just come up. We’ll have to do it next time, babe.”
When he felt better, John knew, he’d give Sherlock a right earful about running off by himself, about playing games with fucking murderers like Moriarty, for not fucking thinking things through despite all his genius . . . but these were things for future John to worry about, in the meantime taking a plastic cup and some proffered pain medication from a medic and chucking them down his throat with little ceremony. He’d refused a hospital stay once the medic admitted that he was no longer in any actual danger from his injury, because as difficult as Sherlock could be, he’d likely be twice as bad if forced to accompany John to a boring, sterile hospital ward.
Jim can’t help but laugh as the shout from over his shoulder echoes throughout the pool, contrasting with the gentle sounds of the calm water. Of course Sherlock doesn’t run, he’s never been able to tear himself away from the danger, from the seductive call of impending doom, of course he wouldn’t leave now, especially with his companion, pet, experiment, whatever he is, clutching tightly at Jim’s torso, creasing his suit.
But then he’d met Sherlock and the meaning of silence shifted to something less menacing. Silence became domestic and relatively harmless; it became drinking tea and reading the newspaper in the quiet of their shared sitting room, no longer the sound of a gun he’s not supposed to have sitting ominously in a desk drawer while he tries desperately to forget about it.
He's hesitant to touch John, a concern he's never entertained before, and if he had to boil his frankly overly-emotional and illogical facsimile of ‘reasoning’ down for a simpler audience he’d say . . . John has put up with enough of being physically manipulated by others in the past twenty-four hours, and Sherlock feels actively averse to the idea of adding to it. John’s had his autonomy interfered with enough lately, and it feels like touching him now, particularly outside of any general nursing capacity, would be . . . not good. It feels like it’d be wrong, yet another improper imposition upon John Watson’s time and physical form.
“I’m perfectly capable of attaining anything of which I have need,” the man in question responds, as if on some sort of petty auto-pilot before his tone softens, “I was wondering if you did.”
He should have realized that John’s significance as his flatmate, singular friend, and right hand man would make him appear significant in Moriarty’s eyes as well despite his inherent, well, boring normality, if only for the man’s relation to Sherlock. Though perhaps, a surprisingly loud and petulant part of his mind muttered darkly, perhaps that isn’t John’s only significance to the game, to Moriarty, now; the consultant criminal had seemed awfully enamored last night as he’d stroked John’s face . . . And there it was, the sickening twist of his gut, the unconscious scowl that clawed its way onto Sherlock’s features without his permission, though here, on the floor of the hall with no audience to speak of, he couldn’t be bothered to wipe the dreaded thing away. But perhaps a bit of scowling was in order, given the circumstances, if only for the therapeutic value.
“Sometimes I forget…” Greg looked away. Sometimes Greg forget that John was a doctor, a solider, an officer, a man, and a person with talents he preferred to hide. “You’re sure you’re not the consulting detective in this family?”
The far corner of the storage units were blocked off for further expansion. John knew, in an instant, that if MacPherson was hidden anywhere here, it would be behind the false security of construction barriers and danger signs. John took point as Greg headed around to the back exits.
“The operative term being ‘was.’” Sherlock replied, “I solved it. Now.” She held up two dresses, the same except for the color, “Cornflower or bittersweet?”
“Your position at the clinic hardly made efficient use of your expertise.” Sherlock continued, “You took the job because it suited you. Despite your over-qualification in every area, you chose to be there. This awareness will assist you in your consideration of open positions.”
Blocks away, in an office in Mayfair, a man smiled. He was no longer the military man he had once been, and he doubted Watson even recalled the shy man who had shared quarters with him at Sandhurst. Now, apart from a little governmental work, he was a staid man who read grain reports and managed properties.
“He was one of our set until he was expelled.” Molly’s nose wrinkled and John knew that she had had something to do with that, though he could not hazard a guess to what it might have been, “I’m certain he gate crashed. I made it clear I hated him, and Violet would never invite the both of us.”
“Yes, but I’m not giving it to you, or using it.” Sherlock replied, stuffing a bit of paper into the dregs of the coffee pot, which John was entirely responsible for binning. “She’s just gotten a divorce, compulsive liar, and quickly on the road to gaining fifty pounds and losing out on a possible promotion.”
Greg looked vacant and grey. John’s training took over, and he knew that he was asking Greg to face something that had deeply shaped him, deeply traumatized him.
He didn’t know why, but he hadn’t been able to pick out the patron that had sent him this meal that reminded him of home. Everyone he’d glanced at hadn’t fit the profile, though there was an empty table just out of his line of sight that called to John. He’d not noticed who was sitting there, but he knew his benefactor had been in that seat before slipping into the crowds, unnoticed but not unappreciated. Though it should have put him on alert, it calmed something within him. Maybe, just maybe, he didn't see everything. The reminder that he was not always as analytical as he had been trained to be reminded John that there was more to him than
She had achieved her aims. There was nothing to suggest that Victor’s taint had touched John. Her mistakes, her errors, had not impacted John. She would not ruin the one bright soul in her life. She would walk away, knowing that John Watson had everything he’d ever dreamed of having, not out of privilege and right and rank, but out of hard work, determination, and care for others.
Not, of course, that this was a game. He knew what this was, what she, in all likelihood was. After all this setup was textbook, so textbook that he could see his instructors, and hear them lecturing about...John did not give further thought to those memories. They were classified. Best to keep up the front, all the while knowing that these were basic tactics, taught the first week.
“I’m telling you—” John broke off, not wanting to get annoyed with her damned insistence. “You have me mixed up with another guy.”
There was no number, no name, no directive, no warning, no code. John propped it up on the edge of the teapot and put to, figuring that if there was a bullet headed his way on his day off, he might as well enjoy his last meal. John stared at the note as he ate, wondering who would have sent it, who would have paid for his meal, and how they had pegged him for a solider.
“Excuse me?” He turned from his paperwork to face her. To equalize the discussion as one of peers, Sherlock made a point to take the other chair, “Who are you?”
Sherlock was sitting on her bed, running her hand over MacPherson’s side. John breathed deeply, knowing that the sight of her as she was in this moment was forever burned into his mind. Far from being entirely sexual, there was a tenderness to her care of MacPherson that only John was privy to, and he knew that to be a gift born out of her trust in him.
Sherlock hummed gently. She was already in her Mind Palace. John swiped her tea cup, and found it steaming. It was a bit too sweet, but he drank it anyway, gazing fondly at Sherlock and MacPherson. Quickly, he snapped a picture he would never share with the world, and began a blog post that he would happily broadcast everywhere.
John Hamish Watson was one of the first patients at the new QEHB following Sully Oak’s closure. Wilhelmina Sherlock Sarah Holmes was one of the first new hires in Research and Development for several projects in the Royal Centre for Defense Medicine. She had a research degree in hand, and a desire to be in Birmingham. She could tap dance through an interview with harried committees, and had a job offer before her clearances had come back, though of course those were rushed to the front of the pack.
Sherlock bit back acid on her tongue and addressed Dr. Grosseman. “I am a capable research scientist. Dr. Chatterjee has no complaints with my work, of that I assure you.”
“I know. Mum was so proud, Johnny.” His sister replied, her voice echoing Inverness in a way that John’s own cadence had long left behind. Sherlock watched the way John shifted his weight. He was not ashamed of his service, but he was…regretful…that…ah, his mother…regretful that it distanced him from memories of his mother. “John, I’m sorry.”
“Just for that I won’t tell you that Mummy has a scheme all cooked up.” Lestrade informed him, “I’ll let you flounder and try to wiggle out of a week in the country.”
Sherlock briefly introduced him to every horse and pony in the barn, and noted that there were several more horses in the pastures flanking the long and winding drive. All told, John discerned that the Holmes family ran toward horse riding as a sensible and reasonable diversion. He had no illusions as to Mycroft’s polo abilities, and added ‘mallet-swinging’ to Sherlock’s laundry list of insults with which to reference Mycroft.
The Sat Nav guided them along the journey, the electronic female’s cheery voice John’s only company save the occasional noise and interested movement from the backseat that John took as an invitation for conversation with the dog. MacPherson was the better conversationalist of the two of them, but John was a doctor, and that meant being able to talk about anything and nothing.
“I’ll go and grab the rest.” John padded from the room while Sherlock turned to MacPherson and began to hang her closet in the wardrobe with the dog’s observational assistance.
“Yeah.” The DI spoke, extending a friendly handshake, “You must be John. Nice to meet you. Myc said...”
John crouched steadily behind the wingback chair, feeling very murderous indeed, as Victor slunk away to slough his skin.
“She was waxing this morning, likely it spilled. See the minor burn, there, and there?” Lucy asserted, earning her confused looks, “It’s Friday. You should look and see if she had a blind date tonight.”
“Do I?” John sought clarification, if for no other reason to keep hear her speaking. Her mind was a beautiful place, and to hear her express its inner workings for his ears alone was a gift beyond measure.
But here she was, wearing a dress she’d gotten who knows where, bag from Kate Spade, and jacket from Boden. She did appreciate Kate Spade’s ability to accessorize. Stacy and Clinton were much nicer than Trinny and Susannah, too, and almost nothing beat ice cream in Manhattan. She’d about died dancing The Shag in South Carolina.
Though he know there wasn’t a soul who would bother the car, it did seem the thing to do. It was, after all, property of the British Government. Never let it be said that John Watson made free with governmental issued property. It was the first thing they told you in basic, and it was not a lesson he saw good reason to abandon.
“The only thing that’s between us is a nine stone dog who thinks he’s a lapdog.” John agreed, redirecting MacPherson gently, to the point that he got the message and trotted off to find his ball that had rolled across the library when he'd dropped it earlier. “Don’t do yourself the disservice of not trusting yourself. I don’t need you to say anything. I just need you to know, before this goes any father, before you are pushed to tell me things you think I haven’t surmised already.”
Sherlock set her magazine down on top of her cosmetics case, not that she even wore cosmetics unless on a case, and looked to MacPherson, “For someone who worked during summers in Uni as a shelf stocker, you would think he’d know better than to joke over such matters.”
John did not want to think about his mother, cold in the ground. He did not want to think of there being nothing left in Chelmsford save bad memories and the one bright spot that had been his education. He needed to get away. Afghanistan was as far as he could go from the hellhole that was his home life.
John chewed his chicken. He was once again living in army barracks. He wanted to go back to Helmand. He never would have the chance. His leg and shoulder were too mangled, even if it wasn’t enough for a medical discharge.  “Hey Doc.”
Sherlock fought not to think of October last, and nodded. She was suddenly very afraid. She looked around, and there was no one beside her but the nurse. “I’ll stay with you a minute. You’ll want your privacy, I’m sure.”
“It’s going to be all right, Sherlock.” John tried, for he knew that there hadn’t been a major case in some weeks, and that the lack of a puzzle meant that every bit of her brainpower was solely focused on their dog’s welfare.
“Your gran’s getting on in years, Johnny. Your sister’s got the farming sense God gave a snail. You might have been something useful, but you ran clean off.” Tom grinned, and John noted that he hadn’t yet given up smoking despite poking at Harry’s recovery like she hadn’t been sober for years, “Face facts, son. We’ll give your family a fair price.”
“Molly.” Sherlock told him, and that was code to tell him that she had her knife in hand, and could begin to saw at the ropes that bound her tightly. John noted that she had dislocated her left shoulder, lending validity to his conceptualization of the struggle, “There is a reason she hates him.”
The door to a small sitting room opened, and his escort stepped inside, “Dr. John Watson to see you, sir.”
Well, John paused in thought. That was telling. Baker Street was home, and Sherlock barely let Lestrade in their flat. Offering to have Nan to stay clearly said that, despite the short duration of their relationship, Sherlock saw much of which to approve in his grandmother. They were a bit of an odd couple, but John knew they would get along famously.
Sherlock knew why John chose to serve. John loved to help people. In this fashion, he helped a lot of people, and the risk to himself ceased to matter. It was why he traversed the grey areas between Army Doctor and Army Solider so well. It had taken her ages to understand this about him.
“Please try not to deduce the medical staff.” John reminded her, accepting her refusal but thankful all the same for her genuine hesitation and consideration. It said enough that the dread in his heart began to dissipate, “Ask for something if it hurts instead.”
empathetic and deeply, confusingly, emotive. They would get on well. They were chatting when a clinic nurse knocked apologetically.
“How do you feel about it, Sherlock?” John asked, knowing that the Work had just taken on another dimension in their lives, “Seriously.”
John was glad that at just that moment, he could snap away, and count to fifteen. Stupid fucking tossers. John turned back. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Ireland. Bosnia. Too many places in Africa to count. The Eastern fucking bloc. Seven. Eight. Nine. He could hear the two men arguing. “--cut off my crime scenes!”
Just as the Man in the Belstaff was winding down, another man, with silvered hair came along, “Sherlock! Leave the poor bloke alone. He’s only listening because he can’t get away.” He bustled up to Sherlock, and looked at John,  “Jesus, mate. I’m so sorry. Bloody Holmeses think the entire military is at their beck and call. Jesus Christ.”
While Mickey answered the phones and handled visitors, John had found that he spent most of his time working to encourage and support patients as they connected with services they needed. Last week, he’d spent a whole day trying to get a cooker installed in a family’s flat so that a pregnant mother could have cooked meals, her father could manage his diabetes, and they could make meals at home. Both were patients, and all told, John had spent about ten hours of time advocating for them to get a cooker, encouraging them to accept it, and assuaging fears that the Home Office would not deport them over a free cooker.
“Hawker, Skinny Pete tells me your mouth is in a bad way again.” John addressed the sickly man with the swollen face, and wan expression.
He’d sworn not to tell her anything they’d discussed. He hadn’t been there to ask permission or for a blessing after all. He’d been there on Father’s invitation, as the man had warnings to issue. John knew well why. If Mummy knew, Sherlock would know. They hadn’t even discussed the possibility. John didn’t want to leap and land on his face. He thought a few conversations were the best way to come to a joint, mutual, decision. He wasn’t saying they had to happen this week, but he wasn’t going to pass the opportunity by if they did come round.
Clearly, Greg blamed himself. A girl he loved as a daughter had been assaulted, traumatized, and she had not said a word to him. He was no doubt asking himself where he had failed, what he could have done differently, both before and after that day. It weighed heavily. John saw a new weight settle between his shoulders, and John knew it would be a long time before it lifted.
John and Carter came upon her in the afternoon, sitting on the edge of the chicken swing. She was scribbling notes, and Carter made no bones about asking, “What’s she doing?”
Sherlock stepped back and primly adjusted her clothing around her dislocating shoulder, “But don’t fuss, Mycroft, I’ve already taken significant steps to alter that path of events. I assure you, John shall not be a shell of himself in his dotage, even if he does have the jumper addiction six years ahead of my projections.”
“Who is this they?” Sherlock demanded, bursting out of the stairwell and onto her floor, “Clearly, they do not know John. He would never let himself die. He plans to retire after another few decades, to buy a small farm in his retirement. He wants a dog, several—” Sherlock was reluctant to discuss family planning with her brother listening in on the line, “He has plans. Nowhere do my projections include a possibility that he may…”
“You see, but you do not observe, John.” Sherlock’s gaze softened as she chided him, “Send Carter home.”
She was one to care for her books, and when envelopes came for their return, John began exchanging them with her in some sort of a lending library. How she sent them without noting an address or even a name through diplomatic channels was unfathomable to John, but she did, even though boxes were irregular and grew even more so towards the second Christmas of his deployment.
Greg spluttered as his arms fell to his sport coat, rumpled and haphazard. He patted his pocket, “Give it back.”
When Sherlock gathered her bag, John looked up from where he was sitting with MacPherson to ask, “Do you want me to come along?”
She knew that one day, John Watson just might think of her as she thought of him. She just hopped he survived long enough for that day to come.
He wasn’t the person he once had been. He wasn’t the dutiful son. He wasn’t suffering in silence anymore. He wasn’t hauling his drunk sister out of the barn before she burned it down. And yet, every time he went home, it was as though every one of his self-doubts rose again to haunt him. There, on the farm, he was enough. It was enough for him, but he had never been enough for it.
By Tuesday, John hadn’t been able to stand the empty flat anymore. Deciding that it wouldn’t hurt to find out a bit more about Steve Meredith and his strange adventure spraining his ankle on the moor, John had gone to the street where he and Craig Welton lived, in order to shadow the two of them and see if they might be hiding anything. Or anyone.
John bit the inside of his cheeks. “Well observed,” he signed. “Name reminds us of not nice person.”
Sherlock was crouched over the tabletop, busy rearranging his insect collection. Several empty boxes were freshly marked with words like ‘parasites’, ‘weather indicators’ and ‘non-indigenous’.
From the minute they got off the train at their final destination, Sherrinford held on to Sherlock’s elbow, all the way to the restaurant, and in fact to their table, where the others were already waiting for them.
When the doorbell rang, he looked up to find Rosie had chewed a considerable part of the edge of one page to mush. “Devouring books already, are we?” he said fondly, as he took the book from her and lifted her onto his arm on his way to the front door.
Jim had put away the newspaper he’d been browsing and leaned on his elbows to look her in the eye. “I need you to seduce the blogger. To complete my little project of Burning The Heart Out Of Sherlock, who is so very clearly, very
Steve was never wrong when it came to the information he plucked off the supposedly secure highways of the internet.
“After serving his time,” Sherlock continued, “he moved to a residential care home for adults with profound and multiple learning disabilities, in Wantage, Oxfordshire. Mycroft and my parents still visit him.”
The truth was, he’d wanted this for so long that his brain didn’t quite seem to know what to do with itself now that it had become reality.
“And was it good to talk about such insecurities? Did he make you feel better about it, in any way?”
Most of the time, ever since their childhood, it had just been the two of them, even after Rose Moran had come drifting along to join them.
If only Sherlock had the guts to tell John to go right now, and save himself the excruciating ordeal of seeing their love transform into complete indifference.
“Doing a little bit better every day, thanks,” he briefly smiled back. Then, more business-like again, he asked, “Molly, can you tell us a bit more about the lady who looked like her? How and where did she die?”
Just as the cab turned the last corner into Windsor Drive, Sherlock heard the sound of a gunshot through his phone’s speakers and thought he might be sick.
Sherlock clenched his jaw. “Your brother chose to take his own life. I had nothing to do with that.”
She took off her glasses, blinking as her vision adjusted. “Culverton gave me Faith’s original note,” she said, standing up. “A mutual friend put us in touch.”
He didn’t care if they laughed at him or made him trip and drop his books, like she’d done so many times, but he wasn’t going to allow anybody to poison somebody’s pet. He knew what it was like to lose a dog, especially to lose a dog by malicious intent.
The kiss slowed further until both their movements practically came to a halt and they stood almost motionless with their lips pressed together, eyes closed.
“Well, yes. Anyway, Professor Jonathan White was a colleague of mine. Also a mathematician, but working on astrophysics rather than the field of thermodynamics, one floor up from where I was. He was always going on and on about his latest theories on asteroids, but the man never bothered to write anything
There was a five-minute break, during which the others discussed which Hamlet they preferred, and teas and coffees were brought in.
He made a sour face, still not used to allowing himself to admit he was susceptible to the concept of amusement.
Sherlock smiled dreamily in acknowledgement, swirling his wine in the glass. “Just like that time in the case with that series of violent street robberies,” he said “when he thought he’d caught his suspect and
was the name of the conwoman they were looking for, then – assuming her first name was real. Not that knowing her name would really make it any easier to track her down, probably, but it was a nice extra.
John squinted his eyes in disgust, waving his chopsticks in mid-air. “Do people actually do that kind of thing?”
The realisation hit him hard as a truck. He was ready. Was he, seriously?? The expected panic following this thought never came. The fear and awkwardness at the idea of being penetrated suddenly
Sex was turning out to be a much more varied and fascinating activity than he had anticipated, and nothing like the mindless routine he had always assumed it to be.
After he’d begun to realise that they induced disproportionate stress in John, during those times they had gone together, and John had started making up excuses not to join him, Sherlock had eventually gently suggested that such outings were useful exercise to gradually build trust in the world again. John had objected that he merely didn’t
“I’m sorry, John. It’s just… lying can become rather tricky, when you have to do it for ninety minutes straight.” Sherlock didn't know where to look, afraid to see the disappointment in John’s face.
Although John could understand Sherlock being upset, his reaction was definitely a bit not good, with Marcus having passed away not two months ago, and of course him having been married to someone else to begin with. “Sherlock,” he said, in a low voice.
They remained standing there, in a tight embrace, for several minutes, as Mycroft softly sobbed into Sherlock’s shoulder.
With the very few brain cells that were still functioning, he realised that there was another erogenous zone that he could reach. He slung an arm around John’s bottom and pulled him close, ducking his head between John’s legs. This elicited a surprised grunt, followed by a strained gasp the minute Sherlock lightly bit John’s arse cheeks – after which he continued licking and kissing them, revelling in the feel of soft flesh that gave way so easily under the pressure of his mouth and of the little hairs that tickled his tongue.
Should he give him a kiss? It felt kind of weird not to, but the right moment for it seemed to already have passed, if it had ever been there.
“Win what?” Fleeting confusion passed over his face. “No! I’m just so happy for you guys! You know, for a long while I
He remembered Sherlock telling him his fake therapist had shot him and that she was not Sherlock’s sister at all. That John had been dreaming.
One evening, when they’d been sitting on the sofa, exhausted, silent, John had taken Sherlock’s hand in his. His fingers had gently closed around Sherlock’s, which had been resting on his thigh. It had felt so natural, feeling John’s warmth seep through his skin.
Sherlock stared up at the man pressing him down, still trying to fight him off, but lacking the force. He didn’t even know what he was fighting anymore, or why.
John’s cock had become almost painfully hard and was awkwardly leaking precum. He had a hard time keeping his voice steady as he replied, “Oh, Jesus, Sherlock, do you even have to ask?”
John briefly tried to think of any good reason why he should still keep postponing this and found none. So he put his hands on Sherlock’s sides and gently pushed him downwards, motioning for him to lift his knees from the mattress, one by one, so that John could spread his legs around Sherlock’s and Sherlock ended up between his thighs.
Without consciously deciding to, he took one of Sherlock’s hands in his and pressed his face against it, willing himself not to cry.
“I’m so sorry I wasn’t more supportive of you back then,” John said, as if reading her thoughts. He swallowed and ducked his chin. “I was always so afraid for you, scared that your being so open about your orientation would get you into trouble. That someone might harm you. But now I understand why you didn’t want to hide. Why you wanted to actively make the world a better place for LGBT people.”
“It was utterly stupid of me,” Sherlock went on, “to have been honest to you about something like that, which completely changes your image of me and which therefore makes it impossible for us to continue the way we were. I’m sorry I didn’t think it through. I just--”
As happy as Sherlock was to have John back home again, he was also more than a little nervous about what it would be like, now that their relationship had shifted into something new. Once they reached the landing, it was decision time. John’s bedroom was another flight of stairs up, while Sherlock’s was right around the corner.
“Well, dear mother,” Mycroft said, “I think it’s worth noting that when Sherlock has a plan, he generally won’t stop until it has been executed to his satisfaction. As you can see.”
Only five more chapters! Half of them are written and in the editing phase; only two and a half to go. After two years of working on this monstrosity of a fic, I can’t wait to see it all finished. (And I imagine neither can you guys, LOL.)
Eurus heaved a shaky sigh, biting back tears as she blindly stared out of the window. The sun had no mercy on her feelings and shone like it was a lovely day.
He sits opposite his friend in the beer garden, enjoying the uncharacteristically warm evening sun and meanwhile trying not to think of Sherlock’s mouth – a continuous attempt that has been largely unsuccessful over the past two days.
Besides some family members and friends, who had in turn brought their friends, there were also a number of other artists there, and even some local press. Janine had invited them through their mailing list with a short paragraph dedicated to Sherrinford’s backstory: a deaf artist who had learnt to communicate only through art. A brother of the famous Sherlock Holmes, no less.
– a book, or playing a game of chess. Sherlock sometimes made drawings – of the mountains and fjords they’d seen that day, or of John and Rosie sitting opposite him.
“Hello, Sherlock. John.” He smiled unconvincingly. “I happened to be in the neighbourhood and thought I’d drop in, to see how everyone is faring in these quarters.”
--Would you like to go out for dinner this Saturday at The Ledbury, around 8pm? Would love to see you again. xx
As soon as John arrived at Baker Street and was about to put the key – which he’d never stopped carrying with him – into the lock, he noticed that Mycroft must be there. He’d straightened the knocker again.
After the friendly nursery nurse had handed her the bag with all of Rosie’s stuff, Molly stepped back into the corridor, carrying the little girl on her hip.
“Yes, you did,” she said, her voice high-pitched. “And I told you it was a waste of time and effort, as…” She stopped speaking as she noticed her middle son elaborately signing back at Sherlock now. (What she didn’t know was that he asked, “What is she going on about and how much longer will it take until we get some food here?”)
Despite the dark, John noticed that Sherlock’s eyes darted all over the place, as he apparently considered his words.
She looked down and nodded. “Acceptance of any existing situation is indeed the most healthy response. Although what other people think of you is rarely relevant,” she said. She then scribbled something in her notebook, which John couldn’t read. “So what happened after the hug?”
When John opened his eyes once again, Sherlock was still by his side, sitting in a chair next to his hospital bed. Just like the previous couple of times. Always there.
Their find was all over the news now. #thelostspecial was trending on Twitter, along with #lostspecialfound. Suddenly, no one called it The Black Pearl of the Borgias anymore, for some reason. (Maybe because one of the Borgias was now dead and there was sadly only one left, out of what had once been a large and powerful family.)
“I noticed.” Sherlock curled his lips inwards to hide a smile as he looked at the man who had decided completely out of the blue to kiss him not twelve hours ago. He was real and he was here.
A waiter came and took their meal orders, which involved more signing at the junior end of the table, and more staring at them from the other end.
Sherlock hesitantly put his arms around him. “John, please tell me this is real. Will you… be mine?”
At that instant, however, his attention was drawn back to the table near the window. He couldn’t exactly hear the words, but Violet and Bob’s body language clearly indicated that the moment Sherlock had anticipated had arrived. They were bickering about who had invited whom.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “But you’re easy to love, John. Any woman having sex with you would probably fall in love with you and want to marry you on the spot.”
But fantasising about it was one thing. Now that it came down to it, adrenalin seemed to be strangely clouding his ability to think. Nevertheless, he knew one thing beyond all doubt: he didn’t want to lose John. He had to ensure that he did everything it took to make John want to stay.
At that, John grabbed the lube from the bedside table and pushed it into Sherlock’s hand, that rested on John’s chest. “Will you fuck me again, but like this?” God, he was already so hard. “Only if you want to, though.”
Sherlock raised his mug to his mouth again, embarrassingly aware that the chances of success on this path were small. “What noise?” he asked innocently, mentally kicking himself.
She wondered if this counted as holding a man’s hand, which she had never done before. It had not mattered, and then when it did, she wanted no placeholder in John’s place in her life. She wondered if this would one day count as a meeting between them, though she knew she would hold these moments deep within her Mind Palace. They were not ones she would easily recount. She wasn’t sure she even remembered how to breathe.
John was becoming rather desperate for some stimulation himself, but this was not about him; so he resolved to simply put his own needs on hold for now.
Right there, on that bathroom floor, he swore to himself that he would always keep loving John, even if John did in fact no longer love him back. At any rate, the whole plan to propose to him seemed ridiculous now and he certainly wasn’t going to follow through on that and make a fool out of himself. Instead, he thought, reluctantly, he’d better focus on getting used to the idea that he might very soon be by himself again, back to the way it had always been, which was probably a more natural state for him to be in, anyway.
Sherlock touched his pyramided fingertips to his lips. His eyes fell closed as he leaned back in his chair by the empty fireplace, remembering the previous night.
After a while, the limo came into view and parked near the back of the ambulance. Sherlock spotted a man approaching and opening the rear right-hand door, letting John out, who walked straight over to the ambulance. “Well? How is he?” John asked Molly.
“I see.” John looked around, trying to reconcile all the different things he saw presented together in the same room. There was typical teenage stuff like some Disney figurines, a tiny Enterprise space craft and a poster of Spiderman, as well as an extensive collection of books on impressionist art and nineteenth century poetry. “So, er… how long have you two been together?” he asked.
take this seriously. This is more than a hunch. The man is a psychopath. He virtually confessed to us and then pretended it was all just a joke. But it wasn’t.” John paced up and down the interview room. “I swear to God it wasn’t. He’s a lunatic. A
There was a strange calmness over him, after all those frenzied months of continuous tension and jeopardy.
John stood up and walked over to him, leisurely wrapping his arms around Sherlock’s waist in a way that was somehow incredibly sensual and flirtatious – and did all kinds of things to the precapillary sphincters throughout Sherlock’s body.
Sherlock dazedly looked up to see John timidly smiling back at him, still gently holding his prick, his hands dripping with cum.
Once all that had been managed (including the adventure of acquiring and subsequently mastering the workings of the hotel’s only electric kettle, for the preparation of Rosie's formula), they went for dinner in the restaurant downstairs.
There was nothing left for her to do but slowly turn around, glad that no one could see her blushing, and leave for the kitchen to see if there was any damn milk – bursting out giggling as soon as she was safely out of hearing range. It was a long while before she managed to stop shaking her head to herself.
By then, he’d already known that Mary was Moran and that she’d done a decent job running Moriarty’s empire after his death. While on the side, of course, accomplishing one of Jim’s most important missions of burning the heart out of Sherlock – by seducing John. So her being who she was, was a perfectly good reason why she could very well have been behind the uncanny mystery with the broken busts also.
John’s hands had a firm grip on Sherlock’s buttocks, pulling Sherlock towards him whenever he hesitated for more than a second, encouraging him to keep going.
Like that afternoon she’d shown up at 221B just as they had been about to go and inspect another possible victim of hers. “Time for our weekly trip to the morgue, I think,” Sherlock had suggested to John, after they’d hit another dead end in an assassination case they’d taken up the week before. Once a week, Molly let them look at any shooting victims for which the Yard didn’t have a suspect yet and for which Mary naturally had been a potential candidate, what with her being a professional sniper.
He clumsily took the note from her and studied the paper, without looking at the words scribbled onto it just yet. (Those weren’t always the most interesting.)
“Why not?” comes the gritted out reply an a harsh exhale, and Jim becomes suddenly much more conscious of both the sharpness and the proximity of the man’s teeth, “If we’re screwed either way.”
Were it an induced sleep, the location would be more understandable, but as it is, it’s quite odd. To the outsider, it might seem like it would be normal, at least Sherlock’s brand of normal, to fall asleep in odd places, and while this is in a way true, Sherlock is also a creature of habit, at least inside his own flat. The places in which he’s known to nap may sometimes be odd, but they are at least predictable: sofa, armchair, the floor in front of the armchair, a few times on top of the coffee table, when the sofa and armchair were otherwise occupied with stacks of books, lab equipment, and other odds and ends. The hall outside John’s bedroom was entirely new, and for that reason both perplexing and slightly worrying. What the hell was he doing there? He can’t have chosen it for the sake of comfort . . .
The frankly not unexpected emotional constipation begins to come into play, though John's not really in much of a position to recognize it.
“Oh, you absolutely should after the bloody mess you got me into,” John confirms, a bit of the anger he’s still harboring slipping into his voice, “but I’m frankly surprised at you admitting it.”
One of the key differences that John can see between Sherlock and Moriarty is that Sherlock is not naturally cruel. He doesn’t have a penchant for it, but he’s certainly able to manage it, and so often in the most unthinking of ways. Moriarty is cruel on purpose. Sherlock is cruel unthinkingly, and that hurts in a different way, because it means that Sherlock didn’t even think of him. Sherlock, the man he is, just didn’t think of it.
He feels the hot breath of righteous destruction on his neck and lets the shiver manifest physically, shifting in the bruising hold, and the way Sherlock’s flick back and forth between himself and John Watson in confusion makes Jim unable to resist smiling. It’s just too satisfying, the widening of the eyes as the grip tightens, enough that he can feel his ribs fairly creaking under the pressure. He could signal for a sudden and bloody end to this, but as yet it’s simply too amusing. Johnny boy doesn’t know that though, how much Jim’s enjoying this, at least, not yet.
Mercifully, Sherlock actually does remain silent, and as John’s eyes flutter shut, he sees the man striding over to the chair, pulling it out, and plopping himself down into the seat with a quiet huff. He’s sitting in it backwards because of course he is; god forbid he sit like an average person, but John knows that this show of unnecessary rebellion won’t last long once he’s fallen asleep, at which point discomfort will likely win out over obstinance.
Sleep and drunkenness, two marvelous, socially-acceptable situations in which one might act out of character. Sherlock has feigned both to his advantage a number of times.
It’s at that moment that John Watson very nearly jumps out of his skin, as the closing of the door reveals the unconscious Sherlock’s location, slumped against the wall, legs stretched out into the hallway outside John’s bedroom, and very still. Once recovered from the shock, the stillness gives John pause, and clutching his cane, he does his best to crouch down next to his friend, where he confirms that yes, Sherlock is alive and that his sleep appears to be a natural one, not induced by anything besides honest exhaustion. Mercifully.
The touch was electrifying, sending shuddering waves of goose bumps across Sherlock’s body. Sherlock let his head fall back against the door and John took the opportunity to lean in and run his tongue over his neck, eliciting a series of gasps and sighs from Sherlock’s open mouth, which were answered by John’s soft moans of contentment.
“You do? Interesting.” Sherlock had steepled his fingers thoughtfully. “Is she the personal assistant to Lady Smallwood at the secret services?”
John squeezed his eyes shut. All he wanted right then was to hold Sherlock in his arms until forever, and keep him in a protective bubble so that nobody could harm him ever again. As he rested his forehead against Sherlock’s temple, John could feel his eyes burning and soon hot tears were spilling down his face. He softly stroked Sherlock’s back in a repetitive, comforting rhythm, as the new information gradually settled in his mind.
Despite her – once again – very different appearance, Sherlock recognised Eurus the second she stepped into the room.
He forgot to breathe for a few seconds as he let the words echo in his mind. John loved him. Sherlock wasn’t even sure what that meant, exactly. But once his brain stopped trying to wrap itself around this new piece of information, a relieved smile involuntarily started to spread over his face.
How could he, Consulting Detective, have let his mind be blinded completely by one false assumption?
John and Sherlock spent a good deal of time comfily entangled on the sofa – John often reclining against Sherlock’s shoulder or chest – while trying to devise plans to catch Eurus, reading the papers, or doing nothing at all but enjoy the relative peace and quiet.
John was barely holding it together by this point and in his head started compulsively reciting the only Shakespeare sonnet he knew (once learnt by heart for some silly contest in his uni days); anything to keep his vital functions within normal parameters.
Sherlock tried not to smile like a fool at this, then abandoned the attempt and raised his hand to summon the waiter.
Sherlock got up, pulling his thoughts away from Sherrinford and into the present, and took Rosie from her, mock-seriously telling the infant off. “Hey there, you cheeky little primate. How are you ever going to grow into a proper Watson, if you behave like this, hmm? Keeping Hannah awake in the middle of the night, and screaming at all of us?” He lifted her in the air above him and gently wobbled her to the left and right. “There should be a law against it. Yes, there should!”
Another half hour after that, he had chosen and ordered a realistically sized but stylishly black one for speed-delivery tomorrow morning. There would likely not be much time.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at Molly, amused. “I see I must congratulate you once more. And you, Greg. Finally a couple, are you?”
Sherlock and John looked at each other, and Janine was glad to see she’d planted a seed in fertile soil. A proper vacation in a different place would definitely do them good, to make up for the ghastly summer they’d had. They surely earned it.
But John wasn’t listening anymore. A theory had started to form in his mind and he was now going over the steps one more time to check their plausibility.
, Sherlock thought, looking across the table at the lies Donovan had faithfully penned down in her notes.
John smiled back, reassured, relieved, until both their smiles merged into a kiss again, slow and tender this time, almost like their first.
Towards the end of the afternoon, when they were lazily lying on the sofa, limbs intertwined, John furtively crawled down and hooked his fingers in the waistband of Sherlock’s pyjama trousers again. Sherlock became hard within seconds, catching his breath when he felt John’s fingers on his bare hips, pulling down his pants. Without further ado, John took Sherlock’s cock into his mouth and, using his already expanding array of creative tongue techniques, soon made him come, grunting and screaming as dazzling fireworks went off in his head once more.
Sherlock fidgeted with the hairdresser’s cape around his shoulders and looked at his worried frown in the mirror, as the barber proceeded to trim his hair. Sherlock had figured that one aspect of his disguise for his undercover work as a builder might as well be a regular haircut (which was long overdue anyway and which usually tended to alter his appearance quite a bit already), even though most of his hair would be covered by the cap that he was planning to wear on the job. While he watched the amount of curls that lay scattered over his cape gradually increase, Sherlock pondered the transience of life and how the nature of relationships was just as changeable as people’s physical appearances, even though they were rarely altered as deliberately. After having hugged Sherlock and held his hand pretty much throughout the previous afternoon, John had started to become distant by the time evening had come. He hadn’t touched Sherlock anymore, not during the night, nor this morning. Sherlock felt a sense of shame creep into him when he thought about it. He had become someone different to John, and he had been a fool not to anticipate that.
When school was out Sherlock gathered his things and walked to the public library, he lived close by so it wasn’t a problem. He knew none of the jock kids would be hear and he didn’t want to go home. The library greeted Sherlock, happy to see the kid who visited frequently. He mumbled a reply then walked over to a round taking out his history essay over Charlemagne.
Just as Sherlock was about to move to the next person John turned around swiftly, not aware of the teen that stood beside his desk. His face collided with something soft and cushy and his eyes widened. Sherlock turned an animated red and squeaked as he realised his crush had face dived his butt. John moved away from the dark-haired kids butt before turning red. His heart began to race as he noticed who the kid was. The blond began to sweat and freak out, he had just involuntarily sniffed his crush’s bum.
“I suppose it is-” Sherlock’s words died in his throat as blue eyes met brown and widened. The blond smiled, a sheepish smile.
