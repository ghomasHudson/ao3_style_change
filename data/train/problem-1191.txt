Sherlock listened to the thumps of John coming up the steps. He had a new cane, his footfalls sounded slow and uneven, obviously an adverse effect of his near death experience.
John opened the creaky wooden door of the cabin and set down his lone suitcase on the hardwood floors, looking at Sherlock who was already inside and busy preparing logs in the fireplace.
“What was the first?”
He carefully lifted John’s feet and plopped himself onto the sofa, letting them rest in his lap.
“They’re not that terrible,” John mumbled.
“Those leaves proving interesting, then?” he asked.
No response came from John, but Sherlock didn’t want to stop trying; it was progress compared to the curt ‘yes’ and ‘no’ answers he’d gotten all morning.
The afternoon sky was full of looming grey clouds and the brisk bite in the air made Sherlock’s pale nose and cheeks turn a bright, rosy pink. He was just about to start wondering exactly how much longer John planned to be out here when John called out to him to say that he was finished for the day.
“Hm?”
“Ah, so I was right.”
It was a few days after John’s trip to the hospital, and he was racing around his room like a madman as he got his things together for rugby practice. He needed his uniform, his socks, his shoes- god, where was the
“Oh yeah…” Mike trailed off, looking mildly confused.
, I promise. Now, why don't you—“
“It might be better to leave it for now,” he said. “You haven’t eaten dinner, which is grossly out of character for you, and frankly a little concerning.”
“You do it; I’m a bit put out at the moment.”
The ride was silent for a beat, and John focused on the soft rumbling noise the car made under his feet. It was strangely calming, and he found himself becoming entranced by the sound. He was wavering on the edge of sleep when Sherlock’s deep baritone snapped the silence in half.
“Perhaps.”
“Up…up there?”
“Sod it; I need some air.” John shook his head, mentally chastising himself for giving Sherlock the reaction that he wanted, but he simply couldn’t stand to be in the room any longer.
Now it was John’s turn to not know what to say. He'd figured that Sherlock would've had no problem deducing his injuries, had even anticipated a prolonged explanation of the exact trajectory of the bullet that’d gone through his shoulder, but he hadn’t anticipated this sort of response.
I'll always have a soft spot for matchmaker Mike lol. Thanks so much for reading!
“Greg, your flatmate? A bit taller than me, short hair, warm brown eyes?”
After a long and arduous trek up the stairs to the flat, John headed straight to his armchair to rest for a moment. He leaned his head back and closed his eyes, trying to ignore the residual ache in his chest and the scrapes on his wrists that still stung somewhat.
He whipped his bow around for a little bit, flipping it in the air as he thought.
John made his way to the library after class, intent on finally getting started on the biology report that was due in just a few days and had been burning a hole in his consciousness for a good week.
“John,” Lestrade started, moving a bit closer, “you feeling alright?” he asked.
“Shit,” he cursed. His ankle was definitely broken, and along with the bruised ribs and slippery, snow-covered ground, there was no way he’d be able to get himself back up the steep ravine.
“Great. So no internet connection, no television, and you’re ‘busy,’ so—“
Sherlock only grunted in irritation. “John, you’re disrupting my concentration. Though now that you’re awake, remind me, what was the name of the pub we found the suspect in on our last case?”
,” John said, exasperated, but Sherlock was already on his way to the kitchen.
Sherlock stopped as soon as he stepped into the other room. It was a small bedroom that was decaying happily along with the rest of the place. Lestrade stood next to a rotting bed frame, looking frantic and wide-eyed as he attempted to hold onto John, who appeared to have collapsed onto him.
John was just relaxing even more into the sofa when he felt Sherlock shiver next to him and saw him cross his arms over his chest. He was clearly starting to feel somewhat chilly, which made John realize that he was actually feeling fairly cold himself.
“What I wouldn’t give to see one of his posh three-piece suits covered in glitter.”
John quickly wet a nearby tea towel and held the side of Sherlock’s face in one hand to keep him still. As John carefully wiped away the remaining sugar, he suddenly couldn’t help but notice the sheer warmth of Sherlock’s skin beneath his palm, the soft brush of his hair as it curled around his fingers, the shape of his lips that were even more unique up close.
“I know. I tried to tell her that, but she wouldn’t listen. We haven’t really spoken since.”
Heading back to the bed, Sherlock got out his tiny notepad and scribbled down his mobile number. He handed John the piece of paper and started walking again.
John had come home from the medical conference earlier that afternoon and was immediately swept up in a case with Sherlock, leaving him no time to bring up Sherlock’s recent violin playing habits.
“Oh, there you are,” John said, still panting after his momentary panic.
“I know how it may have appeared, but I promise you that I wasn't thinking any less of you."
“I still don’t understand why you would want to take a break from our work,” Sherlock said.
“And that’s different than normal how?”
“John?” he tried again.
“John.”
Right before the larger man was finally pulled away, he landed one solid punch to the smaller man’s nose, sending him flying backwards and crashing to the floor.
He and Sherlock sat back and tried to enjoy the game as the others took their turns along with more and more sips of their drinks. John watched them with a wary eye, knowing that it never took very long for the lot of them to get out of hand. John only had the occasional sip and Sherlock wasn’t drinking at all, so he felt safer with the knowledge that at least two of them would still be sane by the end of the night.
“I’m sorry?”
John just shook his head and gathered up his dishes. He put a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder to help keep his balance as he got up, though he disguised it as a friendly pat. “Yeah well, don’t forget you’re one of them too," he said.
“You just said you liked it!” John teased.
It had been over a month since he’d been mugged in the alleyway, and he’d had to go for two more doctor’s visits, as his deteriorating eyesight was worsening at a faster pace. He could now see a sort of smallish oval of visual information in front of him, the rest clouded up and unclear. And more recently, he was starting to lose his colour perception, feeling as though someone lowered the saturation level on his vision.
“Shall I just...?” Sherlock pointed to the edge of the bed, suddenly needing permission to sit.
“John.”
John got up from his seat and peered through the maze of bodies to see two men swinging at each other, one of them fairly large and muscular, the other thin and lanky, swinging his fists in arbitrary directions in search of his target.
“Er, yes,” John said, glancing nervously at Sherlock. “Sorry, you two know each other?” he asked.
It was late, and they were on a very long stretch of road somewhere in the country, the only sources of light being the moon and their high-beam headlights. And that’s when it started; a roll of thunder in the distance, a muffled rumbling that sent shivers down John’s spine.
“Really. You’ll help me. How? You’d need to take a break from cases, and you need those to function. And I am not gonna let you treat me like I
“Then we’ll be more careful.”
With wide eyes and a confused expression, John just nodded.
Sherlock looked back and forth between John and his belongings for a moment before pouting much like a small child. “I’ll be right back,” he grumbled.
John laughed and took a sip of his tea. “That’d be a sight.”
Sherlock huffed and finally looked away from his screen. “Well I can hardly risk getting up and leaving all of my things out for people to steal at their leisure,” he said.
Sherlock looked momentarily surprised before he turned and ran down the stairs.
“Hm?” The detective turned.
is not—“
“But it was never like this,” Mike went on. “The old John would’ve been three pints in by now.”
“Oh, none of that. I don’t need interesting conversation; I’m not your date. Here comes Angelo, just order tonight’s special since you can’t seem to decide, and it’ll all be on the house since he owes me a favor."
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock sat back in his sinking leather armchair and steepled his fingers in thought.
“Upstairs. Got a call from a couple of teenagers, said they saw a body and ran.”
He set down plates and utensils on the desk in the sitting room a bit more grumpily than necessary, having ordered some takeaway with the thought that he’d be able to get Sherlock to talk
“No, cab.”
Lestrade didn’t protest, and made his way out, shaking his head wearily. As soon as Sherlock was sure that Lestrade was out of eyesight, he took John carefully into his arms, holding him from behind and steering him so that his own back was to the wall and John was in front of him.
John cleared his throat. “Yes, dreadful buggers, really.” He sighed.
"Oi," he started, when he could finally see what was wrong with the picture, "what're you doing? For the fiftieth time, that's
Just as John had taken another bite of chocolate and cream, there was a frantic knocking on his door that had him coughing up his mouthful of food in surprise.
He made his way over to the table by the large window where Sherlock sat, his eyes glued to the phone in his palm. He was dressed in a deep red button-up and a thin black cardigan, looking casual but still put-together.
“As you can see, my hypothesis was correct; no surprise there,” Sherlock said, leaning over his desk and pointing to a collection of petri dishes. “I’ve written it all up in a blog post, if you’d like to see the diagrams.”
Sherlock smiled quickly, his lip turning up just the slightest bit at his own brilliance.
“I know that you’ve had a night that was…not good, and normally I leave you alone to bottle up your emotions—“
Finally posted a new chapter after over two years! I hope you enjoyed, and thank you for reading!
Once John saw that a cab was slowing down to pull up to the curb, he slid his thick cardigan off of his shoulders and turned back to Sherlock.
He was currently sitting on the sofa, attempting to sit through an episode of one of the shows that Mike liked so much and absently nibbling on the small plate of biscuits that he’d called dinner.
John rubbed his hands together to ward off the chill as he made his way through the biting cold to Hudson’s café, the overcast sky shrouding all the shops and people in a muted, uniform grey.
“Yes, that did seem a bit out of character, but not drastically so.”
“It’s child’s play, John. His therapist has gone round the twist; the man is losing his mind and so he decided to make others believe they’re losing theirs as well.”
John was asleep before he could analyze Sherlock’s playing habits any further.
“Christ, I'm getting old,” John murmured under his breath, still not looking at Sherlock.
Not long after John sat down, he heard Sherlock’s footfalls as he slowly made his way down the stairs. He felt Sherlock sit down next to him but made no move to look at him.
When John opened his eyes, he felt heavy, cloudy, and more than a little confused. He looked at the white walls surrounding him, the stiff blanket tucked around him, the heart monitor beeping steadily to his right. Hospital, then.
He watched as John’s mum made John sit up and patted his back until the coughing stopped. Then she helped him drink water, and then she stuck that horrible thermometer in John’s mouth. Sherlock knew John hated that.
“John!” Sherlock yelled. “It’s in my eyes!” he complained, shutting his eyes tightly and rubbing frantically at them.
“I don’t follow.”
He’d have to stop this panic before it started, then, had to suck it up and get over it like his father had always told him to do. Maybe if he could do that for once, just deal with it, and-
“No, no,” John said. He had to do this. Not only was keeping his shirt on during sex becoming more and more inconvenient, but the alternative of turning the lights off when he was with Sherlock only saddened him even more. He had made love in pitch darkness too many a time, and he couldn’t bear to do the same with Sherlock. “Right,” he continued, clearing his throat and unbuttoning the first button with shaky fingers. “And you promise you won’t be…disgusted? You won’t run away or, or—“
that it’s finally time that you went out and got yourself a pair of—“
“You…is this…am I—“
“What?” Sherlock said in shock, pulling himself closer to John. “Of course I need you.“
This could not be happening, John thought, not again.
“You trying to murder my laptop?” John asked, blinking rapidly and waiting for the fog in his vision to clear. “’Cause you’re punching the keys like you’re mad at the thing,”
“As I said before, I assumed that you needed the break. And if I’d asked you beforehand, you would have refused to come, then would have continued to overwork yourself and would have been incredibly irritable when I got back.”
“Because I’d promised not to go off without you anymore.”
“Excellent. You see if you didn’t know who I was, you could’ve deduced these things all on your own. Might not come in handy for meeting new people, but it could certainly prove useful for victims at crime scenes.”
“Mm.”
“John, I need you stay with Mrs. Hudson for a moment,” Sherlock said as they walked into the foyer.
“Mycroft is
“You go ahead and eat; I’ll be fine. The cab should be here in just under an hour,” he said.
"That's no excuse. My blogger is slacking, this is unacceptable!" Sherlock chuckled on his way out, "Come John, I came back early so you could make me tea."
When the investigation-cum-therapy appointment was over, Sherlock and John flagged down a cab and hopped in, grateful for the warmth inside that combatted the chilled air of winter.
“For what?”
“Another pint, John?” Mike asked.
“Just…come here.”
“And I’ve never been on one at all, so surely you’re the one with the expertise here.”
John opened his mouth to retort but stopped when he saw Sherlock simply roll his eyes and let out a tired sigh.
, he remembered the term.
“Oi, who let the freak in?” Sebastian laughed, looking to Sherlock with a greasy smile to match his greasy black hair.
-------------
It was a little while later, and John and Sherlock were just about halfway through the film, which so far Sherlock seemed to be enjoying despite his frequent critiques of various plot points.
“Sherlock? You okay?”
It was almost midnight by the time they got back to the flat. The adrenaline rush had long since worn off and John was ready to fall straight into bed.
“Yes, you did. Goodnight, Sherlock.”
“What?” John snapped. More thunder rolled outside his window.
As he and Sherlock had worked, John hadn’t been able to stop thinking about how important Sherlock had become to him over the past few months, about how alone he’d felt before he met him. John had only recently come to terms with his identity, having doubted that he’d ever be comfortable enough with himself to admit when he had feelings for someone. But after spending the last few weeks with Sherlock, all of those doubts and fears had seemed to fall away without him even noticing.
John was close behind, sans cane as the two of them burst out of the restaurant.
“The texture of the skin is different. Is that from your experiments as well?”
“What? Make deductions? Yes, it
“How are you feeling?” Greg asked.
John fell asleep after a few minutes of listening, still smiling to himself.
“Do you take requests?”
This is just a really short snippet of kid!John being sick and Sherlock being bummed out that his friend can’t play.
Sherlock pointed ahead.
“Was it?”
“Excuse you, but I’ll just be getting on with my
“You’re right," he said, still panting a little. “This was more fun.”
“Yet another reason to avoid the sport altogether,” Sherlock said. He was sitting on the floor in front of the coffee table where they’d set down their containers of food, absently picking at his dish.
“Forks are in the drawer to the left,” Sherlock told him. John pointed to the open drawer.
John grinned a bit. “Yeah, and I think I’ll actually drink it this time.”
But now he’d be lucky if he woke up in the morning and saw Sherlock next to him let alone after a nightmare. He was almost beginning to get used to the empty space to his left. Perhaps he should’ve seen this coming, should’ve known that Sherlock was never partial to routine and would eventually move on to something new.
John woke with a start, a breath trapped in his lungs. He sat straight up in his bed and gasped for air until he finally felt the breath return to his chest.
“Why the hell did you bring me along, then?”
“Oh my god, that’s, that is a very elaborate way to convince someone they’re losing their sanity.”
John’s mum rushed in and then it was a flurry of activity that sent Sherlock jumping out of his chair to stand by the door.
“Jo-ohn,” Sherlock whined, pawing at the duvet. “Wake up,” he pleaded. John stayed snoozing, completely oblivious to his friend’s presence.
It took a few moments and a bit more nudging for Sherlock to begrudgingly open his eyes, which he promptly closed again.
been attempting to avoid this conversation all morning.
“When he thinks I need to relax, yes.”
“So you’re studying some sort of science, then?”
“You just finished one last night,” John said in disbelief.
“Oh! You’re a friend of Sherlock’s, then?”
“Well, it’s not really very festive, being the family disappointment, though I do enjoy the mince pies.”
John was just beginning to contemplate the shape of the gum stuck to the back of one of the chairs when he felt his phone buzz in his pocket. He furrowed his brow in confusion, wondering who would be texting him considering his friends all knew he was in class.
It was only after Sherlock had successfully apprehended the suspect had he realized with a sharp sting of panic that not only was John not with him, but that he hadn’t been trailing behind him for the last few minutes of the chase, either.
John shrugged and shook his head. “Nothing, just, normally this is the part where you take over and tell me exactly what I’m thinking.”
“Getting Mrs. Hudson’s Christmas present.”
Sherlock huffed and sat himself down on one the rickety wooden chairs, pushing away some of his science equipment to make room to rest his arms.
He walked slowly to get a better look at everything, still not entirely convinced that this wasn’t all some strange experiment of Sherlock’s. On the coffee table he saw two containers of takeaway food, their two favourite mugs, and a stack of DVD’s. The lamps on the end tables were dimmed, making everything appear softer and warmer, and although John wasn’t sure what this whole thing was, he felt a burst of happiness in his chest at the sight.
“That’s not what people normally say.”
“You have a brother?”
“You’re not getting out of this that easy,” Sherlock said, sitting up straighter in his chair, more concerned now than he’d been the entire evening.
Taking off his coat, Sherlock padded into the sitting room just as John began to wake up.
“You’re right; dealing with your sister always proves to be a taxing experience.” Sherlock smiled, and John let out a quick chuckle.
John was officially at his wit’s end. He and Sherlock were going to sit down and have a talk if it bloody well killed them. It had been far too long since they’d acted like an actual couple and John was done being quiet about it.
“You’ve turned it off,” Sherlock said, staring at it as if wondering why he had never thought to do that before.
“It’s quite alright,” Sherlock said as he stood to check his phone. He couldn’t help letting out a small gasp when he saw the message from Lestrade.
“Now, we’re going to count to ten. Are you ready?” Sherlock asked, and with his hand still kept on the side of John’s head, he felt him nod minutely.
“I don’t see why—“
“Anytime, yeah.” John laughed. “Hey, I’ve got a match on Monday; you should come,” he said.
“Thank you,” John said. He took a deep breath and tucked himself back under the covers. “What’s the book for?”
“Well, she didn’t work with her hands, that’s for sure,” John said with confidence as he felt the perfectly manicured fingertips of the recent murder victim, who lay on her side in the middle of a small bedroom. Sherlock was crouched next to John, watching him as he worked, and looking up occasionally to Lestrade, who stood over them.
“But you’re not
The doctor licked his lips in thought and figured he may as well give it a try. “Okay, uhm,” he started, feeling the dry, cracked skin of Sherlock’s palm. “well your hands are very dry, that’s really bad, there’s moisturizer for these things y’know,” John noted.
It was the third day of winter break, and so far John hadn’t done much other than catch up on all the sleep he’d missed out on during the term and finally use his laptop for something other than typing up papers.
John closed his eyes and rested his forehead against Sherlock’s.
The rest is a little bit blurry but it was clear by your eagerness to help, your knowledge on how to handle the situation, and your calm bedside manner that you were either a university student with a martyr complex or someone studying medicine. Or both,” Sherlock finished, picking up his pen again and immediately getting back to work.
When John came back down to the sitting room, suitcase in hand, Sherlock was busy attempting to fit his laptop into his duffle bag.
There wasn’t much in the cupboards save for a few bags of crisps and some biscuits. The refrigerator held more promise, however, and John managed to put together sandwiches for the two of them. He cut his sandwich in half and Sherlock’s into fours, because after living with him for so long, he realized that Sherlock was much more likely to eat something if it was small and could fit in his hand.
“That nosy little son of a—“
“Sorry, what’re we doing?”
“Actually, I have no idea what happened to John; you just took off with him.”
“Unfortunately.”
“Oh, er, I really don’t think—“
“Mm...s'my shoulder,” he slurred, scrunching up his face in discomfort.
? You got his information and you didn’t go to the police? Why the hell would you do that?”
“What the hell is your problem?” John snapped as he entered the flat.
“I swear that woman has it out to get me. Honestly, I melt one pair of goggles and suddenly she’s got a vendetta.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“John?” Sherlock answered quickly. He was okay, then. Good, now John could be mad at him.
John stepped into the sitting room, ready to greet whatever mad venture Sherlock was up to, but was surprised to find the room empty. He scratched his head in thought and figured Sherlock must still be asleep. Not wanting to disturb him, John set about making himself a much needed cup of tea.
“Wow, that’s…yeah.” John sighed. “Me and Harry don’t get on, never have. She’s always been a bit of a wild card.”
be up until three a.m. You’d be too tired to make me breakfast in the morning.”
John let out a bitter laugh.
“Feeling better?” Sherlock asked without even looking up from his screen.
They were now standing at the kitchen table, covered almost entirely in flour as they attempted to make a batch of gingerbread men. John had insisted that they at least try to make them, claiming that maybe it’d actually be fun this time considering it wasn’t Sherlock’s family he was baking with.
“I don’t understand.” He mumbled quietly.
John went and sat stoically at the desk, resting his arms on the table. Not a moment later, his tall, lanky flatmate joined him, sitting down as quietly as he could manage.
With a plop, Sherlock sank into his seat and looked to John in surprise.
“I’ve been summoned. Detective Inspector Lestrade seems to think he’s found a lead. I might be long; make yourself at home. And yes, I want you to stay here. I know you live alone and I don’t want you heading home in this state. Mrs. Hudson will be up; she’ll make you tea and stay with you.”
“Palace, John, it’s a palace.”
“John?”
Shaking his head fondly, John headed up the stairs to his room to go pack.
John had never been to the Thai place that Sherlock had suggested, which he apparently could tell the quality of by the bottom third of the door handle, though John suspected that that particular deduction may have been a bit of a stretch.
Sherlock huffed. “For god’s sake, John. A small cabin in the woods, a roaring fire, snow falling outside, it’s the making of one of those terrible romance novels you read.”
Sherlock tucked his phone back into his pocket and looked to everyone around him, all of them laughing and enjoying themselves, before looking to John.
John had to admit that he may have been walking just a hair too close to Sherlock as they made their way back to Sherlock’s flat, their arms brushing together every few steps. The harsh winter air stung John’s cheeks and ears as he walked, and he attempted to bury his face as deeply into his coat collar as he could, but shivers continued to wrack his frame nonetheless.
John didn’t even bother actually looking for firewood as he trudged through the trees, barely paying attention to where he was going and muttering to himself along the way.
“I just- I feel, god, I can’t- Greg, I can’t—“ John stuttered. God, he couldn’t even form full sentences anymore, how on earth was he ever going to come out of this? His hands were shaking now, knees wobbling; he felt so pathetic.
“Right, okay,” he said.
“Aside from that,” John continued, “today has honestly been one of the best Christmases I’ve had in a long time, if ever.”
“There’s only room for so much in my head, John. I tend to only fill it with things that are important.”
They maneuvered themselves into the backseat and John’s shaking only got worse. He knew that even if the thunder stopped completely, the panic attack was already in full swing and there wasn’t really any stopping it now.
“The chicken parmesan, please,” Sherlock interrupted, quickly snatching away John’s menu afterwards. “Thank you.” He handed the menus back to the waiter and gave him an attempt at a friendly smile.
At this, John couldn’t seem to contain his smile.
“Um, yeah. M’alright. Thanks,” John said awkwardly, reaching out to take a sip of his water.
“Mm?”
John walked over to the door and peered through the peep hole, finding Sherlock to be standing on the other side. He had a somewhat crazed look in his eye and was practically bouncing up and down in impatience. John quickly opened the door, wondering if something might be wrong.
“I helped Mrs. Hudson out with something a while back,” Sherlock said, shrugging.
“Ooh, s’Johnny’s turn!” Tom slurred. When Tom started calling him ‘Johnny’ he was definitely past coherent thought at that point.
“Right, because it would’ve been so difficult to say ‘oh, John, by the way, we’re going on holiday for three days in the woods’? All thanks to Mycroft’s kind heart.”
Sherlock nodded and motioned for John to take a seat in one of the armchairs. John winced a bit as he sat down, still looking around the place in wonder.
“John, I know the start of a panic attack when I see it. My ex-wife used to have them. It’s nothing to be ashamed of.”
“Mmf,” John murmured, his face locked in a tight grimace.
After a while of talking rugby and filling up their empty stomachs, their voices died down and the flat soon grew quiet; the only sounds coming from the soft clinking of dishware.
“You don’t have to
“You’ll see.”
’ to describe your current state. I’m beginning to doubt that you know the dictionary definition of the word.”
“Dark brown and black, simple to mix up, but you—“
(See the end of the chapter for
“So,” John started, looking around in a bit of a daze, “what’s, er—“
“One minute!” He shouted, quickly wiping the crumbs from his mouth and jumper.
“Why would Mycroft do something like this out of the blue, Sherlock? Is this secretly for a case? Am I going to find some criminal playing hide and seek in the woods?”
John looked down at the half-empty mug of tea in his hand and realized that he didn’t want to finish it, because then what other reason would he have to stay downstairs and avoid going to bed? Even away from the bustle of London, and even after a lovely evening spent in good company, John still feared that his night terrors would rear their ugly heads and leave him tossing and turning once more. But John also knew that he couldn’t avoid his problems forever. And who knew, maybe by some miracle he would have a restful sleep after all, and he’d never know unless he tried.
Sherlock was pacing around the man, examining him and breathing heavily. He looked to Lestrade.
“I would assume that it’s obvious.”
“I never revise. Don’t need to. I could pass this class in my sleep.”
tw: under-eating, dehydration
“Remind me again how you found that?” John asked, pointing to the dirty metal walking stick.
“What a twisted world we live in,” John mused.
“Shame, I was so close.”
“C'mere, Hamish.” John patted his lap in invitation. “Come and sit with me for a minute, okay?” He gave Sherlock a subtle nod that said
But not tonight. Tonight was going to be all about the two of them. No plans, no nosy sisters or nagging parents, just Sherlock, John, and a good film to watch in between all the snogging.
the Christmas tree.”
“Well, clearly it’s not just about getting glasses. You’re not the type to fuss over your appearance, and even if you were, there’s always the option of contact lenses. So it’s a deeper issue, then.” He paused, carefully thinking over his choice of words. “You’re…insecure about…getting older, though I fail to see why,” he finished.
my job. I make simple observations and draw logical conclusions from there.”
“Sorry, the heating’s a bit shit in here,” John said. “Be right back.” He got up, albeit reluctantly, from his comfortable spot to go fetch a few warmer clothing items from his bedroom.
“Yes, that’s him! Shit, what now?”
“I’m not sure I’d call reacting to toxic substances in the bath overdramatic.”
Later that night, John lie in bed, staring up at the ceiling after waking from a particularly vivid nightmare. He hoped that he hadn’t been screaming out loud, but he assumed that he must have been making at least some level of noise going by the slight soreness of his throat.
Luckily, the sound of a small group of people approaching was enough to send the thug scurrying off into the darkened alley, even though the people just walked obliviously by. John lay limp for a moment, still trying to catch his breath.
“He’s all tuckered out, the poor love,” Mrs. Hudson whispered with a hand on Sherlock’s arm.
“What should I do?”
“Who?”
“What I’m saying is that I care about you, very much. There’s a reason why I wanted it tattooed by my heart. I know it’s lame, it’s cliché, but it’s also true. I…I love you, Sherlock. You have to know that.” John swallowed back tears, suddenly wondering how he ended up here. A drunken game of truth or dare to confessing his most private feelings; at least he could say it was a productive evening.
John carefully placed the jar back on top of the microwave where he’d found it and backed his way out of the kitchen to join Sherlock in the sitting room. He’d been at Sherlock’s flat less than five minutes and had already come across a multitude of questionable leftovers from previous experiments.
“On occasion. Helps me think.”
-------------
“Oh, don’t do that, let’s skip that. Right, so, how about we jump to the part where you took a deadly poison seemingly on your own volition even though you were found at the top floor of a house that had quite a set of stairs and considering your limp you would have never made it up without your cane which, as I proved, was not on your person at the time.”
After a short taxi ride back to the flat in which John tried to compose himself, he unlocked the door and let himself in. He went up the steps slowly, stopping short at the door to the sitting room. He took a deep breath and braced himself for the sight that might meet him when he went inside.
When the shaking seemed to have dissipated, John steeled himself and went back to typing. It only took a few more sentences, however, before the tremor crept up on him yet again and caused his fingers to smash clumsily onto the keyboard.
“That’s not what this is about and you know it. Face it, John, you're getting older and your eyesight is not as crystal clear as it used to be. And if you don't want to keep squinting at things and stumbling over cracks in the pavement then I suggest you get over whatever little crisis you're having and
“Then why take so many cases? Why stay up countless nights looking at fungus under a microscope or go to Bart’s or wherever and not even think about the last time you’ve bloody kissed me? Christ, even I can’t remember. Be honest with me, Sherlock, am I…boring now?”
“Ah, the classic love-hate dynamic. Wonderful. I suppose I could just pop out then.” Sherlock said, grabbing his scarf from where it lay on the chair by the door. He tucked it around his neck and continued to stare down at John, who had his head laid back and eyes closed in obvious fatigue.
“So. Allergies?” He asked, accusingly.
John walked slowly back into his room and switched on the small lamp on his bedside table before sitting down on the edge of the bed. He took his phone out of his pocket and scrolled through to Harry’s name in his contacts, his fingers hovering hesitantly over the button before pressing it.
“But you still have an interest in it, the army.”
“This is ridiculous!” John shouted as he sprinted behind the detective. Somehow the cabbie was still a good few meters ahead of them, and Sherlock wasn’t about to stop any time soon.
“It means that you don’t mix up your socks. It means that you always type up your blog no matter how tired you are. That you don’t trip over yourself and you don’t get mugged in an alley and you don’t fumble and break teacups and for the love of god, John, what on earth is going on with you?” Sherlock let go of the shorter man, and slumped his shoulders uncharacteristically as he caught his breath.
Swallowing hard, John left the room and made a beeline for his phone with the intent of texting Sherlock to ask him where he was or if he was okay, when suddenly he heard the sound of someone coming in to his flat.
For a moment, Sherlock looked completely affronted, as if John had just offended him beyond measure.
“You can borrow it anytime,” John joked weakly. “Well, I’m glad you’re okay. See you around, I guess.” John nodded stiffly and walked away, wondering why Sherlock’s words had stung quite so much.
“Yes, I know.” John sighed.
“There’s the John Watson I know.” Sherlock beamed, leaning down to plant a chaste kiss on his jaw.
John smiled and shook his head fondly. “Well, my sincere apologies.”
This story is complete and I'll be posting a new chapter every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday :)
Sherlock silently cursed his brother and placed one arm underneath John’s neck, and the other underneath his knees. He lifted him as carefully as he could, cradling him close as he looked for an alternative way back up.
affected by it.”
“You’re quite fit, did you know?”
John’s jaw dropped a little in surprise. “Wait,
The army doctor took a deep breath and let it out as an exasperated sigh. “I can’t see you, Sherlock.”
“Right,” John said decisively. “Right, okay.” He stoically held back any forming tears as he started to pull his shirt back on. “It’s fine. I understand,” he reassured Sherlock, in case he was even listening.
“Right. Okay.” John sighed and leaned back into the cushions. “But you’re sure you’re all right?”
“No I mean, I can’t type up this bloody blog.”
John stared at Sherlock’s outstretched hands for a moment before silently conceding, because if he was being honest with himself, continuing his attempt to type was likely only going to frustrate him further.
“How do you feel?” he asked, wetting a paper towel to wipe his face down.
“John, as I said, my brother had already arranged everything for this little ‘holiday’ of ours and I assumed that you would be pleased.”
! You’re not boring; I like you.”
“Sherlock, please.”
“John, I—“
“I will actually kill you,” John said, swatting Mike’s arm with a stray takeaway menu. “Go watch your crap telly.”
Sherlock moved back slightly, clasping his hands behind his back.
John had to get out of there.
“Thank you.”
“We meet again,” John said teasingly.
“Yeah? I could barely walk after that episode and you know it. Thank you for shutting up about it, by the way.”
John looked away and nodded curtly. “Right,” he said, his voice ragged. “Well, I’m not an idiot either, Sherlock. And I know you only said those things to upset me so that I’d storm off and leave you alone. But I’m not doing that. Because what I just heard you say is that you think I only wanted to be your friend so that I could fix you. But you’re wrong.” John swallowed hard and steeled himself before facing Sherlock again. “I wanted to be your friend because I
“Yoo-hoo!” Mrs. Hudson chirped, seemingly appearing out of nowhere. “Coffee for you, tea for you,” she said, setting the heavy ceramic mugs down in front of them. “And your scones, Sherlock. I brought one for John as well; it’s on the house.”
The sun was going down outside the windows of the flat, but John was determined to finish the blog entry, even if it took him all night.
“Mostly your upper body, like your shoulders and head. You’re a tad fuzzy and, I dunno, things just aren’t as bright as they used to be.”
And so he sat. And watched the fire. And decidedly did not go up to bed.
John chuckled. He might just have some fun this weekend, after all.
John laughed. “Well, anyway, I’m glad you—“
“Hey, it’s all fine by me, remember?”
“John, you should lie back down. You’re sounding a bit shaky.”
“Got you some water. Are you alright?” Sherlock asked quietly.
“I was, as you put it, ‘completely ignoring you.’”
“Incredible,” John grinned.
“Yeah, I think so,” he said.
“Yes, all right. I will stomach a phone call with my brother if you agree to talk to your sister.”
“You’re gonna scorch your socks if you sit like that any longer,” John said.
“But how can you possibly know that we don’t get along?” John blurted out.
“So you mean…what you’re saying is—“
The cab driver took one look up and decided to make a run for it. He dashed into the nearby alley and Sherlock and John didn’t hesitate to go right after him.
“Hm. Lucky sod,” John joked. He folded his legs up against his chest and rested his arms on his knees, feeling strangely relaxed despite the subject at hand. “And what about, er, relationships? Have you ever had any…boyfriends, or anything?”
Upon opening the door, John was met with the sight of an empty, perfectly made bed, with his cardigan folded neatly on top of the sheets.
“Hm?” Sherlock turned his head, as if noticing John for the first time.
“Sherlock, I’d just walked in the door, you tossed a full suitcase at me and manhandled me into the car!”
“You’re avoiding me,” Sherlock stated.
“How does that feel?” Sherlock asked.
Lestrade let out a frustrated sigh and zipped up his blue plastic suit, following in Sherlock’s footsteps.
“Alright, John?” he asked, feeling the doctor breathe in shuddering breaths.
John took a deep breath. “Sherlock...do you know why I was so angry?”
tw: blood, mention of kidnapping, depiction of injuries
John looked to him and saw that he was hugging his arms close to himself, probably to ward off the chill. John wondered if he’d had a jacket with him before.
“Yes, they think he’s completely bonkers.”
“Obviously.” Sherlock wrapped his fingers around John’s and gave them a reassuring squeeze.
“Come on, Sherlock, that can’t be true,” John said, almost to himself. A part of him simply didn’t want to think about Sherlock being alone, didn’t want to imagine him feeling lonely or isolated.
“Come on, one sleeve at a time,” John said. He held open his cardigan and Sherlock slid his arms in with a reluctant scowl.
“Peachy,” John joked weakly, his voice rough from disuse.
“And how do you know that?”
“Is this one of those things you learned on the internet?”
“Rugby?” Sherlock asked, his previous excitement quickly deflating.
“And I can choose not to eat it. You can’t force feed me in your current condition," he teased.
“Well maybe we- maybe I need a bit of a break from…what we do,” he said, swallowing thickly and turning his head to stare at the nondescript wall to his left.
He sighed wearily and sat himself down on the sofa. He really should have just gone to bed, but he supposed that there was no way of avoiding Sherlock’s questions about his tattoos, so he might as well get it over with now.
Walking back into the sitting room, John was stopped short when Sherlock stood in front of him and planted both his hands on either side of John’s face.
“Just let me tell you before you go off and deduce it behind my back.”
Sherlock heard a small gasp from the kitchen and looked up in an instant. John was standing over a drawer, staring at something in disbelief.
“Just give him to me,” Sherlock interrupted, already beginning to gingerly take John from Lestrade’s hold. “John,” he said, holding him up from underneath his arms. “John, snap out of it," he said a little more sternly.
John smiled to himself and shuffled out of bed. He quietly padded down the hall and stopped at the entrance to the sitting room, watching as Sherlock played by the window.
It was perfect; John’s parents were out for the night and likely not going to be home until at least midnight, and his sister was staying over her girlfriend’s, which meant that he and John had the house all to themselves.
Not a very relaxing situation to go home to, but John would try to make the most of it. Perhaps he'd have a shower before surveying any damage. Yes, a nice hot shower, and then he could stress about whether or not any of his medical texts had been caught up in the fire. And oh, god, had he left one of his jumpers in the sitting room by his chair? That would just be the icing on top of the horrible, horrible cake that was today.
Mumbling a quick goodnight to Sherlock, John headed up to his room and flopped onto his bed, belatedly remembering to kick off his shoes. He was practically asleep before his shoes hit the floor.
Mrs. Hudson frowned and turned to John. “John, you’ll tell me. What’s he gotten himself into this time?”
“I have to admit,” John said, “aside from being unjustly hit in the face with icing sugar—“
“It bothered you from the beginning, didn’t it?”
The flat was silent for a few minutes as their laughter died down and John finished up his tea.
“Hey, er, would you maybe want to hang out sometime? Outside of school, I mean.” he asked, rubbing the back of his neck.
Instead of offering to clean up the mess, the detective stretched his taller form right over John and claimed a mug from the shelf. John gripped the counter and bowed his head, trying to gain back some sense of normality.
“You thought I’d forget about you. You thought I would forget you’d gone out, or remember too late.”
“Well, sorry to interrupt,” John said.
“It’s a horrendous distraction, you understand.”
Sherlock donned his coat and scarf and stepped outside into the chilled winter evening. The sun was still somewhere in the hazy grey sky, casting a dark purple and bluish glow on everything. The snow crunched under Sherlock’s feet as he followed John’s angry footsteps.
“Thank you for tonight, Sherlock. I needed it,” John said quietly. “No one’s ever done anything like this for me before,” he admitted, almost to himself.
Sherlock gingerly sat himself down, pointedly not looking at John.
“Lestrade,” he greeted, only then realizing that he’d been breathing heavily. “I’ve got your suspect, handcuffed to a tree, in fact. I’ll tell you where he is and you can send your team to go and fetch him. I may need your help getting John back to the inn.” He looked down with a grimace at his friend. “And I’m going to need you to phone an ambulance.”
“Hold on, I do not—“
“Christ.” John covered his face with his palm.
“So I don’t even have the challenge of avoiding family members to keep me occupied.”
“Oi, don’t bring that up, he was way out of my league. Plus it’s not like I could go out with him after I realized I was in love with
“What do you mean?” John asked, his eyes immediately darting up from his notes.
“Why?”
“You’re not a freak, Sherlock.”
“Sorry,” John murmured. “Guess I’m getting grumpy now.”
John gave Sherlock’s shoulder a light squeeze before backing away. He couldn’t help but stay for just a few moments longer, admiring the way the moonlight filtered through the slats in the window and illuminated Sherlock’s sleeping face.
“So, was that your brother, then?” John asked as he stretched his bag leg out and tried not to look pained.
John found that he was having the same problem when reaching for a mug. He kept trying to grab it, but his vision was blurring inconsistently. He was so focused on trying to get a mug down that he didn't register Sherlock stepping into the kitchen to stand uncomfortably close behind him.
“Trapped, am I?”
Sherlock’s fingers were on the victim’s neck.
“Just give me a minute here, alright? This is all just coming back to me now. He was an older man, white hair, shabby hat. Glasses. I dunno what he was wearing, an old jumper, maybe?”
“You don’t have to tell me anything either, John,” Sherlock said.
“Yes, John, you know how I loathe repeating myself.”
John only looked at him in confusion.
“Sherlock?” John called. After hearing no response, he slowly pushed open the door.
“No, I didn’t. Good night, John.”
He stepped in and approached the bed slowly; probably a good move on his part.
? There’s a man lying half dead.”
“Then why did you look at me like that?"
Lestrade just rolled his eyes at Sherlock’s antics and turned to leave as he finally backed up past the threshold.
“John, I’m here now, I thought you wanted to talk.”
“Your tremor is acting up again.”
“I can tell by your…your…” Sherlock suddenly began to sway, his head threatening to make contact with the sink faucet.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Don’t, Sherlock, just…don’t,” he ground out, standing halfway out the door and not even looking at him. Without another word, John left the room and tried desperately to push back his emotions.
“He is none of your concern right now,” Sherlock spat, clenching his fists.
If you have any suggestions for some John!whump, feel free to let me know! General feedback is also greatly appreciated! Thanks for reading!
“Right, so, on with your story.”
“Thank you,” he said, taking one of Sherlock’s hands in his and planting a kiss on his palm.
“I don’t understand.”
John watched Sherlock shuck off his coat and untie his scarf, wanting to argue, wanting to tell him that he didn’t need to do that, but he just didn’t have it in him. He was far too tired, and he knew that Sherlock was right, anyway.
“I’m not a med student; I’ll have another,” Greg interjected.
Without words, Sherlock sprang up from his chair and went into the kitchen. He filled a glass with water and set it down in front of John. He then took the afghan from the back of the armchair and started setting it on the doctor’s shoulders.
Sherlock made a noise of disapproval and shook his head. “Too many rules and regulations,” he said. “I just want to get to the puzzle, John, to really put my mind to use, not sit at a desk and fill out paperwork.”
When John walked into the room, he slowed to a stop and licked his lips, looking around.
“What?” John pushed himself up and turned to face him. “Yeah, of course. Why?”
“I know you’ll be looking for a flat share. And I honestly wouldn’t mind a little help with the rent. Also, Mrs. Hudson
John was careful not to rest his head too heavily on him, though, because it still felt as if there was some sort of tension between them, a fragile barrier that would break with one wrong move.
“Oh, I…no reason,” Sherlock said quickly.
His thoughts were interrupted by the door bursting open and Sherlock blundering in, large white snowflakes sprinkled on his hair and coat.
John snuggled a little closer to Sherlock and properly tucked in to his dinner. He rested his cheek on Sherlock’s shoulder; a warm, solid weight to lean on as he watched the movie.
“This programme is dreadful,” he announced after watching for two minutes, not really expecting a response from John.
“I’ll be right there. Bruised ribs?” Sherlock assumed.
“You have Professor Garrick, then?”
“Hm?”
John licked his lips and shook his head fondly. “It’s- god, you’re gonna think I’m a right sap when I tell you.”
“I’m so tired, Sherlock. I know tonight was…we were gonna, y’know,” John mumbled, looking guiltily at the floor. “But I can’t. I’m so bloody knackered.”
Sherlock shrugged. “It doesn’t matter.”
“Bloody hell, mate, didn’t you think you had it in ya!” Tom said.
“And can I ask what you’re doing with my books? M’not asking you to apologize for rifling through my things again, I’m only, y’know, wondering what you’re up to.”
The other doctor simply shuffled his notes and pushed his glasses up on his face again.
“Any other information I cared to share with you in my drunken state?”
“Hm. The
“I’m sure that you’ll do perfectly fine,” Sherlock said.
“If you insist.”
“What do you think?”
“John, do give me more credit.”
“I’m sure you can, too. Now come here, I’ll pet your hair in that way you like and we’ll see how many plot holes I can find in this next film.”
And it may have been fast, and messy, and downright indecent, but it'd felt incredible. That night was over a month ago now, and the mere thought of how long it’d been made John grimace and stop his slow strokes.
“Yes, thank you,” John snapped. “Now they didn’t get bloody
“When mum left, I had to take care of Harry, and last year I had to get a job, and I’ve got to keep my grades up, and then there’s rugby, and—“ John stopped and held back a sob. He put his face in his hands and Sherlock could tell that he was trying not to audibly cry.
“Okay,” John sighed, “how about
“You’ll see. Just sit.”
silly. Of course he would calm down eventually, he always did, right?
Sherlock went and shut the door behind him, politely taking his coat.
“Yeah. So, what do you say, then?”
Almost an hour had passed since John had closed his eyes on the sofa, managing to nod off for most of that time. He cracked open an eye and squinted at the bright orange light from the fire, seeing Sherlock still sitting in much the same position as before. The sun had gone down in that time and it was only after seeing the darkness outside that John realized that they hadn’t eaten a proper supper.
“You’re not gay.”
“Oof, you're getting big,” John laughed. “You might just be as tall as your dad someday.”
Jogn complied and slowly laid his head on the pillows, resting his hand on his stomach.
“Well, maybe if you’d tidy up every now and then—“
,” Sherlock sneered. “That’s all you can do, isn’t it? All you do is take care of other people so that you can feel better about yourself, yes? To try to convince yourself that you’re nothing like your father? To raise your otherwise declining self-esteem? I’m not an idiot, John; I know you only befriended me because you saw me as something that needed to be fixed, but I am not your patient, or your project, or your charity case and I would very much appreciate it if you
“Sherlock, they left to get coffee just before John—well, will you
“I’d let go, if I were you.” John warned.
John shook his head, not looking at Sherlock. “No, I’m not. I’m just…”
Hamish, however, did not understand that silent communication and stood stock still, indecision written in the way he chewed nervously at his thumb.
“John?”
“I’m at the morgue; Molly promised me ‘interesting feet,’ and I’m about to find out exactly what that entails,” he answered, sounding eager.
John didn’t come to greet him, however.
“John.” Sherlock was calling him, John’s mind knew that, but his body made no move to acknowledge it.
“Your date,” Mike said. “You said you were meeting someone for coffee.”
John was sleeping. Or rather, he was pretending to sleep. After John had been admitted to the hospital last night, he hadn’t done much other than sleep, or pretend to in an effort to ignore Sherlock’s presence.
“Just come in, Sherlock, you’re going to anyway.”
“I got a new book about bees that I was gonna show you, but since I can’t I’ll just tell you some stuff I learned,” he said.
John grunted in pain as he slid and fumbled, and could have sworn he blacked out for a split second when a searing spike of pain shot through his leg. By the time he reached the bottom, all he could register was cold and pain.
John stepped wearily into the tiny kitchenette just off the entryway and tossed his heavy bag carelessly onto the floor. He began rummaging through the cupboards immediately, desperate for something quick but filling so that he could eat and start his work as soon as possible. He was so wrapped up in digging for a suitable snack that it wasn’t until he turned his head to shout at Sherlock about their lack of proper food in the house that he noticed all the changes in the sitting room.
“Sherlock!” John scolded, turning to him in surprise.
“You have to go to bed.”
“Yeah, you can get out of my bedroom—“
First thing in the morning, John had tripped over a stack of books in the sitting room, one that he'd asked Sherlock to pick up repeatedly over the past few days. Then, he'd gone and burnt the toast he was going to have for breakfast, but had no time to make more or he'd be late for work. And in his rush to leave, he'd gulped down the rest of his tea, and had ended up spilling some of it on his shirt in the process. It was just as well, at that point. And to add insult to injury, Sherlock hadn't so much as glanced in his direction let alone wished him a happy birthday. It was just like him, a genius who could memorize over two hundred types of tobacco ash, to forget the importance of one single day.
“I come here every Tuesday, mate. So really I should be asking you if you’re following me.”
“James Bond?”
8:15. Still nothing.
“Alright, alright.” John raised his arms and shucked his shirt, taking a deep breath to calm his nerves. No one had seen his tattoos save for the person who did them, and that had been over a year ago. John had gotten all of it done over the course of a few months and hadn’t been living with Sherlock at the time, else he would have surely noticed. He kept telling himself he’d be comfortable showing them off eventually, but eventually was a more difficult place to get to than he thought, it seemed.
“Right.”
“Damn it!” He shouted to no one. It had been two days, and the fingerprints had ended up being inconclusive. There had been two sets of fingerprints; one obviously from John and one from someone else, but there wasn’t enough information, and he couldn’t get a name for the mystery person.
“No, it’s been bugging you, I can tell.”
“Sounds like a plan,” John teased.
Sherlock could hear Lestrade’s exasperated footsteps slowly ascending the stairs, so he made his observations quick.
“No, it’s interesting. I like it,” John reassured him.
John and Sherlock stepped out of the warmth of the library and into the harsh winter air, their breath falling from their mouths like clouds of smoke. As they walked, the light of the lampposts that followed them felt familiar and safe, but John felt as if his entire body were alight with apprehension.
exhausted, don’t think I don’t notice. It’s been getting worse and you know it has. Why do you refuse to give yourself a break?”
Sherlock pouted. “I’m not worried," he mumbled.
“What d’you mean?”
“So you, what, made deductions about my scar?”
“She’s dead about, I’d say, forty-eight hours?” He stated, moving his gloved hands around the back of her head. “Blunt force trauma to the head, definitely,” he finished.
“O-Okay. I- I think I can do that.”
“I’ll do my best.”
“I’m going to put the heat on it now. You’ll have to move your hand.”
“Right. So you…ignored me because you…have feelings for me.”
“There. Much better,” he said.
John sent the text and rubbed a hand over his face. At least the incessant texts from Sherlock might provide him some entertainment during the medical conference.
Lestrade’s heavy footfalls crunched on the pathway as he came closer. He flicked on his torch and shone it on the two of them, sucking in a breath when he saw the state John was in.
“John, wait, no—“ Sherlock tried calling out, but it was obvious that John was not going to listen. He looked to be on his way to the loo as opposed to simply walking out of the restaurant, though, which Sherlock supposed was preferable.
John hadn’t realized how it would feel to have someone who he cared about watch him play. He had caught himself looking to the stands multiple times throughout the game, and even though he hadn’t even been able to properly see Sherlock, just knowing that he was there had rekindled something in Johns’ chest and he played with a passion that he hadn’t done in years.
Through half-closed eyes, he saw the fuzzy silhouette of Sherlock swaying softly by the window as he played his violin. John smiled sleepily, thinking perhaps he was still dreaming. Comforted by his hazy thoughts and entranced by the beautiful music, it wasn’t long before John slipped into a blissfully dreamless sleep.
“Oh my god,” he breathed, “this guy says he’d had a vision of a murder and then saw it happen? You’ve got to be kidding. Have the police spoken with him?”
“Yes, alright.” John absently rubbed his thigh and stared unfocused at the fire. “Let’s just…move on now, yeah? Mostly because these pain pills are wearing off and I’m bloody starving to boot.”
John rolled his eyes fondly. It was going to be a long trip out to the curb.
John smiled bitterly. “Come on, like you’d want to be seen running around with an old man.”
“What, and watch two groups of people behave like wild animals in pursuit of an inanimate object?”
“Obviously,” John chuckled.
“You’re not going home to see your family?” Molly asked.
“Well you were mugged, obviously. Your watch is gone. You never go anywhere without it; your father got it for you for Christmas two, no, three years ago, and it was stolen tonight. But the real mystery here isn’t how you got roughed up but rather why you couldn’t defend yourself. Clearly this thug wasn’t trying very hard or he would’ve snatched your phone too. But how did he catch you off guard? Normally you’re so—“
“What do you want?” he snapped.
Deep breaths, John remembered. He could do this.
“Mrs. Hudson is not old. You take that back!”
“Huh.” John shrugged. “Right, so where do we start?”
“Yes doctor, and what do my dry hands tell you?”
Thanks so much for reading! As always, comments are more than welcome!
John mumbled a halfhearted goodbye to his coworkers at the end of the day. One of them wished him a good weekend, and he prayed that somehow he’d have one.
Sherlock held his arms out invitingly and John cuddled in close, pulling their blanket back up over them. He’d never imagined that one day it would be Sherlock telling him not to overwork himself, but the man was right; he wasn’t going to be able to focus on his work if he didn’t find time to relax.
“I think there’s another way for you to see me,” He stated.
John took a bite of his definitely stale eggroll and thought for a moment.
“I don’t like this feeling; s’not good,” Sherlock went on. John tried to ignore the lingering smell of vomit and carefully placed his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder.
“Why?”
“God I hope he makes it,” Lestrade mused with his hands in his pockets.
“It was one of my mates, Evans. He and a couple other fellows, they were in a very wrong place at a very wrong time. Got captured by insurgents who thought they had information.”
“Give us a minute, yeah? Okay, I dare you to take off your shirt, and leave it off ‘til you get back to your flat!” Greg said, chuckling and basking in the laughter of his mates.
“Every Monday and Wednesday evening. It’s the only sleep I get all week.”
“And you say
“What d’you mean? I’ve got my phone, and my jacket…”
“Afghanistan?”
It was not John's day.
“Oi!”
“Ah, got it. Could it possibly have waited until after breakfast, though?”
“You’re sure about this?” John asked, his fingers frozen at the top button of his shirt. He was sat by the headboard of the bed with Sherlock perched on the edge of it. He didn’t have to do this, he knew, but it’d been months since they’d begun a sexual relationship, and putting it off any more would only continue to build up the anxiety.
“Unfortunately,” he said, smiling.
“Agreed.”
“Well, I am a doctor, in case you forgot, and you have basically just told me you haven’t eaten in a number of hours. Forgive me if it’s my instinct to do something about that.”
“I’ll get you some of those honey scones you like,” he tried.
(See the end of the chapter for
Instead of answering, Sherlock just let John have some silence. He looked at his friend and could see the hurt in his eyes, could tell he was quietly recalling the event.
John closed his eyes as he thought. “Er, The Foolish Fox?” he remembered.
John cursed under his breath at the fact that there was virtually no one else on the street near him, not to mention the fact that he’d forgotten his wallet.
“You think I’m extraordinary?”
“Apparently Sherlock had made some kind of…deduction about the man cheating on his girlfriend, which I don’t think he took very well,” he said. He settled on some slightly dodgy leftover takeaway and sat himself down at the table, listening as Mike pushed himself up from the sofa and joined him in the kitchen.
“Thank you.”
“It’s perfectly alright,” the man amended, “as I said, this is a difficult spot for anyone to be in. As a doctor though you also must know that the severity of the vision loss is varied at times. You may retain a small amount of your sight; you may lose all of it. Perhaps you will only be able to distinguish shapes. All in time, doctor.”
“Please, please!” The man pleaded to John.
“Clearly you’re shaken. We’ll take a break from the story for now," he announced, trying to hide his disappointment.
“Alright, thank you for that. Forget I asked.” John breathed. “I think I want to sleep now.” He said lazily, already closing his eyes.
“Oh, Sherlock, there you are,” she said as she approached the table. “You weren’t here this morning; is everything all right?” she asked in a whisper, leaning closer to Sherlock.
“You don’t want to go back to your bedsit, that’s obvious. So if you wanted to, you could erm, stay here tonight. And the night after that,” Sherlock turned to face him, “and the night after that. And, the night after that.” He finished quietly.
“You slipped on ice and landed directly on your previously injured shoulder and have spent the last twenty-five minutes in varying amounts of pain and will likely spend the next two days at least with a residual ache, not to mention the possibility of your nightmares being triggered, and you insist on using the word ‘
Slowly, Sherlock opened the door and peered inside, letting out a short gasp under his breath at the sight of his lover stood over the sink at the end of the room, his head down with one hand pinching the bridge of his nose and the other clenching the counter with a white-knuckled fist.
John busied himself with cleaning up the mess in lieu of answering. When he was settled down at the table with his juice and toast, he cleared his throat and looked toward Sherlock.
“You know me so well,” John teased, opening up his container. The warm steam and familiar smell of the food made John’s chest swell with happiness.
“Oi!”
“The point is that between the two of us, I think we’ve rather reached our quota for hospital visits for the month.”
John gave him a look.
“Oh,” John said. “Not even friends?” he asked carefully, thinking back to moment at the bar when Sherlock had admitted to him that he hadn’t had any friends.
”But I thought you were studying chemistry,” John said. “Why not just go out for the police force?”
“Nothing. Go on.”
John picked up two biscuits and stretched to place them on Sherlock’s chest.
“I could help.”
“Cane? What cane?”
“Sherlock, where’s this coming from?”
“For god’s sake, John. All the times you pester me to eat, and now—“
“Yes. And it won’t fit.”
“Not to me.”
“Any toxic chemicals lying around in the loo that I should know about?” John asked.
Sherlock slammed his laptop shut and looked up at John.
“Erm,” John opened his eyes a bit and looked down guiltily. Sherlock took that as meaning he hadn’t eaten anything.
"Oh, brilliant!" Sherlock exclaimed. "Tell me everything."
"John!" Sherlock whined, "I was finishing your blog!"
“It’s fine John. You’re awake now. Which reminds me, why were you kipping in the chair?”
“John? Are you alright?”
Tonight, John was finally going to show Sherlock his scar.
“No. The occasion is that it’s Friday night and you’re exhausted. Now come on, the takeaway’s getting cold,” Sherlock said, tugging gently on John’s wrist to steer him towards the sofa.
“Yeah, I know, thank you,” John replied sarcastically, his head landing back on the pillow with a plop.
Sherlock had been told, in a plethora of unnecessary medical terms, that John had been in a terrible state, and was lucky to have gotten help when he did. They said he’d sustained no physical injuries, but he would be incredibly weak and would have to stay under observation for at least a few days. One of the nurses informed him that he should be waking up soon.
John bit his lip and took another look at Sherlock in the crowd.
“Come on inspector, bring it in,” he said, gesturing towards himself.
“Six,” Sherlock continued, trying to ignore the fact that he knew Lestrade was peeking around the door frame, watching them.
John laid back on the sofa with a cold compress on his midsection and downed the last pill, setting the glass of water on the table next to him. Sherlock came around and tossed the afghan carelessly over John’s legs.
John smiled fondly as he watched Sherlock stalk grumpily past the bookshelves in his haste. He looked back to the table and glanced around at all the books and papers taking up half the space and wondered what it was Sherlock was experimenting on. And he sincerely hoped that fetching a book wasn’t actually the only reason Sherlock asked him there.
Right. Fire at the flat. Burnt chair.
“You’re bringing that with you?” John asked, gesturing to the violin.
“I asked John a question but he wasn’t answering, then I look up and the poor man looks like he’s seen a ghost.”
John thought for a moment.
“Ha, I don’t think so.” Lestrade smiled, backing away from Sherlock’s open arms.
?” he exclaimed.
“I’ve got a wedding to go to,” Greg griped. “What about you, Sherlock? What’re you up to for the holidays?”
“Piss off, Mycroft.”
“Right. And I'll get you some more pain killers as well.”
After staying silent for a good couple of minutes, John got himself up out of his chair and went to the fireplace to start building up some flames.
When the movie came to an end and the credits began to roll, John blinked rapidly as if only just remembering that the movie was eventually going to be over.
His eyes brimming with tears of happiness that he didn’t think he’d find, John wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s neck and pulled him down for a kiss.
“Wish I’d been around for
“It’s not important. He’s obviously just taking out all of his own insecurities on me.”
“’Parrently,” John murmured, his voice rough.
“Yes, but why?”
Christmas parties,” John joked as he poured the hot water into his mug. “My family were never really big on Christmas.”
“What for?”
John licked his lips in thought and folded his arms on the table, leaning in slightly to speak quieter.
“No, leave me alone, okay?”
(teen!lock and rugby!John) Sherlock is looking forward to he and John having the whole night to themselves, but when he gets to John's house, things don't go exactly as planned.
It was a week later, and John, Sherlock, Mike, Greg, and Molly were all out at the bar, having a drink to celebrate the end of exams. They were all crowded around the bar as they took turns ordering another round of drinks.
The doctor sitting at the desk in front of John had a head of short brown hair and donned a pair of weathered glasses. He was scribbling something on a legal pad as John licked his lips in apprehension, and tried not to shout at the man to speak up already.
“Yes.”
John thought for a moment. “Yeah, no. God, no.”
“William,” Sherlock said flatly. John giggled to himself, knowing that Sherlock wasn’t exactly telling the truth, but he wasn’t quite lying either.
“Oh, for god’s sake,” the man muttered under his breath.
dreaming, maybe the walls would suddenly start melting or the room would start spinning, or he’d go downstairs and find the whole flat flooded with water, or—
“Well it is to
“No way, you said you’d do it!” he argued.
John put his arm gently around Sherlock’s waist and helped him into the cab.
John looked a bit mortified from that response. He cleared his throat.
“I suppose that would be tolerable,” he said, trying to conceal a smile.
“You’ve called for an ambulance?” Sherlock asked.
When they arrived back to 221b, John shed his jacket slowly while Sherlock stood and awaited anything he might have to say.
“Erm, never mind. As you can probably guess, I picked a damn pill.”
“You do that thing with your lips.” Sherlock tried to imitate the gesture with his own mouth but only ended up looking slightly pouty.
“You’re good. Good deductions.”
“Is he serious? Inspector!”
He opened the door and stepped halfway out, peering his head in.
“Erm, yeah?”
“See there, inspector? All it takes is a little provoking.” Sherlock smirked, and lifted his friend up a bit more as he came back to his senses.
“Oh, bugger,” he cursed under his breath.
“Right, then. And is there anyone at your place that can look after you?”
the worst part. No, the worst part was the fact that ever since John got to uni, taking off his shirt around other people had been the one thing that he tried extremely hard to avoid. His friends and family would eventually find out what he had tucked underneath the layer of cotton over his chest, that was true, but he just wasn’t ready. And
John looked up at him. “Very helpful.”
“Why not?”
“Yeah?” The doctor yelled, jumping over trash bins and discarded boxes.
“I…okay,” John agreed. He supposed he wasn’t getting out of this one.
Sherlock knelt down next to him immediately, his hands on his shoulders, leaning him back to get a better look at him.
“You seem a bit strung out yet, and considering I’ll need you tomorrow anyway, not to mention the late hour, it might make sense for you to stay the night.”
“John, I’m sorry. That was…cruel of me. I realize now why you don't like to discuss these things when we're out to dinner. John?”
“I’m considering a career in forensic science,” Sherlock said.
“Think we’ll beat ‘em?” Greg asked.
“Pick dare, John! C’mon, you’ve been playin’ it safe all night!” Greg whined.
John didn’t look like he wanted to argue, so he pulled he blanket a bit tighter around his shoulders and sat back.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes, waiting.
“Look, don’t listen to Seb. He’s an arsehole,” John said.
“I’m working on some new compositions,” Sherlock said, snapping John’s focus to where he stood in front of the window with his violin, setting up sheet music on his stand. “I thought I would do a bit of work on them tonight. You don’t mind, do you?”
The sounds of passing traffic and stray voices filtered in through the window of the cab, sounding louder than John had ever heard in contrast to the tense, quiet air between him and Sherlock.
John smirked as he pressed send.
taller!” Sherlock asserted form the kitchen.
“I know it feels that way, but you can, I promise you. Just focus on my voice, all right?”
“You brought me here so I wouldn’t be irritable when you got back.”
Admittedly, Sherlock didn’t know exactly what to do. He had never seen John like this before.
“Yeah, just stopped by to drop them off, figured you would need—“
“Of course you don’t.” John sighed.
John clambered back down the stairs of his flat and onto the steps outside. He sat down on the cold concrete and rested his head up against the metal railing.
From the room down the hall, Sherlock could hear Lestrade’s muffled voice explaining something to Donovan. He heard a few footsteps, and then, just out of the corner of his eye, he saw Lestrade begin to step in the room, and immediately retreat.
“Cheers to that,” John said.
“John, how do you catch an invisible car?”
“Tilt your head forward a bit for me, okay?” John asked. Thankfully, the man obeyed without comment and John held the towels against his nose with a gentle pressure, cupping the back of his head with his other hand to keep him steady.
“Hello,” Molly said cheerily, her smile almost as bright as the pink scarf wrapped around her neck.
“Um—“
“And what’ll it be for you, sir?” The waiter asked, pen at the ready to jot down John’s order.
“Cheers is right!” Mike chimed in, motioning for a toast with his paper coffee cup.
“Is this hell, then?” He asked.
That was all the encouragement he needed, apparently, for he eagerly stepped forward and, stuffed bumble bee still in hand, clambered up onto John’s lap. Sherlock smiled warmly at the two of them before getting up to go and make tea, figuring John would ask for it now that he was feeling a little better.
“Yeah,” he rasped, barely above a whisper.
“Goodnight.”
Sherlock turned to see what he was pointing at. “Ah. That would be my violin.”
John laughed under his breath.
“Oh, of course you
John didn’t say anything. Instead he just fiddled with a stray button on his cardigan and swallowed hard.

with the hours you’ve been keeping lately.”
“What?” Sherlock turned to him, a sudden look of uncertainty on his face. “Oh, um, no, I—“ he stammered, clearing his throat awkwardly. “You could stay, if you like.”
“He'll be fine, don't worry. Why don't you go in my room and...look through my things,” Sherlock suggested.
“And you’re awake.”
“Christ, he really does worry about you.”
John shook his head fondly at his phone. He looked at the clock to his right and saw the late hour, feeling like he really ought to try to go to sleep now if he was going to get up early the next morning.
“Oh, right!” Mike said, pointing a victorious finger in the air. “What was he doing fighting a bloke twice his size, anyway?”
the library, I was the other side of campus!”
Less than a minute later, the DI came back in the room and tucked his mobile away in his pocket.
“Are you, I dunno, are you…okay?” John asked. He couldn’t help but notice the large, plum-coloured bruise that painted Sherlock’s cheek.
“Even Harry?”
“A little.”
John frowned. Of course Sherlock was probably thinking now that all his tattoos were just sentimental drivel.
“I know I do.”
“S’nothing,” John slurred, continuing to not make eye contact.
It was later in the evening now and John and Sherlock were sat in the sitting room in front of the fire, enjoying another cup of tea. Mr and Mrs Holmes had retired to bed, leaving the two of them to sit in companionable silence.
“Oh yeah!” Mike exclaimed. “I’ve got chem with him. Bloody hell, he’s gonna get beaten to a pulp out there, isn’t he?”
John watched him go, wondering idly if perhaps Sherlock knew about his eye problem the entire time, and was only pitying him by keeping quiet about it. He was hopeful that that wasn’t the case, though, seeing as how the disease had no noticeable effects on the eyes. His stormy, navy blue eyes would remain unchanged, with only the ability to see out of them actually doing the changing.
Sherlock leaned his head back against the sofa and stared at the ceiling. “Oh, my family couldn’t give a toss who I sleep with. In fact I’m fairly certain my parents knew about me before I did,” he said.
“Just breathe. You’ll be all right,” Sherlock said soothingly. He really did always know what to do, John thought.
Thank you so much for reading! Comments are always welcome :)
“Do you like it? There’s still a few things to tweak, but—“
Sherlock took his time approaching John in case he asked him to leave. He sidled up to the sink next to him and bit his lip, trying to think of what to say.
(See the end of the chapter for
John was still able to see certain shapes and figures, and different levels of light, which he was grateful for, but it didn’t take long for him to begin to miss the sights and colours of Baker Street, and the familiar scenes of London floating by in a cab window.
John bit his tongue and stared daggers at his so-called friends before taking one hesitant glance up at Sherlock, who was stock still and staring in awe. Fantastic; the man who couldn’t leave a pile of cigarette ash alone because he wanted to study it was now seeing all his tattoos and probably would never stop asking questions about them.
Another minute or two had passed before John realized that Sherlock hadn’t actually responded. He checked his phone again just to be sure, but there was nothing.
“Okay, tell us your middle name!” Mike demanded excitedly.
