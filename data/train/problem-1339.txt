He put the man on his back in the bed, straddled his thighs, and for a long while simply stroked the pads of his fingers over the body beneath him, mapping the changes in texture both gross and subtle and noting hitches in John's breath. When at last the rigidity in his spine and neck ebbed away, he rolled him onto his side and repeated the process on his dorsum.
He closed his eyes. No. Surely they hadn't.
“Jesus Christ,” Dr Anderson had said, appalled. “What a bloody

and he would not ever let her become nothing in the history of the man he was now.
Nor does four a week.
“You and I can only make this work together, Sherlock. I can have a job I love and we can make Mycroft pay me a lot of money for it. Besides, he owes you now, doesn't he? That's got to be worth some favours.”
The good Detective Inspector was informed of his new Craven Hill flat, an easy Tube ride from New Scotland Yard yet miraculously affordable on a policeman's salary, before he left his office that same day. Mycroft retained a very, very good barrister for the arson charge that never went to court, and Inland Revenue unexpectedly discovered they had a few matters to discuss with the landlord.

Greg snorted. “I kicked him off a crime scene. He'll make me pay for that for weeks.”
There were lancet marks on Banks' fingertips from checking his glucose levels and the outline of an insulin syringe in his pocket and yes, some diabetics did carry one around but he couldn't take insulin without eating soon afterwards so why—?
Mycroft had heard those tones before, from men who had nothing left to lose and whose focus had narrowed to the next breath, the next step towards escape, and the desperate attempt to hold on to the last vestige of restraint.
Sherlock sighed heavily. "Evidence points to Fitzhugh, but something's off. Aspects of the situation are simply too amateurish to have been engineered by the same mind that organized a co-ordinated attack on you."
"Nice try. You're changing the subject. We're going to need to soak this off. How old is this injury, Sherlock?"
Now Sherlock was perched on the railing like some mutant raven, complete with gimlet eye and cocked head. "John, fetch my magnifying glass."
Sherlock's eyes went wide and he blurted, “Oh,
“Incidentally,” Mycroft tapped his umbrella's spike oh-so-casually on the runner, “you really should see what John is up to presently.”
Mycroft closed his eyes briefly. "Yes, we do," he said patiently, "and I am proposing to make you one of them."
at him during the car ride from the flat to Mycroft's, and quite possibly John had not breathed even once the entire trip. Immediately they'd arrived, Sherlock had whisked him past the rest of the house into what would be their shared bedroom. John had the impression of lots of wood and light but mostly his thoughts, if you could call them thoughts, were of the desperate need to get Sherlock's wicked tongue on his cock
but they really had to stop because—
John realised something was wrong scant seconds later when he saw the car weaving off the drive onto the manicured lawn on either side, never slowing as it approached the gate. As it jerked back onto the asphalt at full speed and was backlit by the floodlights in front of the house, he recognized, with a horrible sense of unreality and dread but not a bit of surprise, the familiar silhouette on the driver's side.
Mycroft could not bring a charge of treason against a man of that standing without hard evidence.  Anything less and Fitzhugh's allies and secret employees would make sure he walked free.  Fitzhugh would not have been able to risk leaving anything in the heavily guarded locations where his own people might come across it.  No, it would be somewhere private, in a place where cleverness, not firepower, would win access.  John and Tobin would get Sherlock into the site and Sherlock would figure out where to look.
“I'm here, I'm here. My phone was charging. Ah, my back can't take one of those pub chairs, but I'll bring beer if you want to watch the game at your place.”
“John! John Watson!”
“Turn left there,” John said, eyes flicking between Mycroft's mobile and the street.  The dot that was John's phone had stopped moving not far ahead, so there was a good chance they'd catch—
“Two hundred forty-three types of tobacco ash. No-one can say you're not a details person.”
So Molly had cried for a while, then had washed her face, emptied the used tissues into the bin, and done the right thing—the polite, civil, courteous thing. She'd petted her cat for a while and had taken deep breaths and then she'd picked up her phone and ordered

“I have no experience to go on in this area, John. I am not able to predict...anything. Tell me—” John heard him swallow. “You don't trust me now. Tell me what I’d have to do to fix this.”
He knew Fitzhugh didn't think much of him after his epic cock-up and that's why he was getting the shit assignments. He wasn't stupid; he knew he was expendable now and being sent out to do the jobs likely to get him killed. He also knew he didn't want to be expendable so he needed to do something brilliant to change Fitzhugh's mind. Well, this was his chance and he wasn't going to fuck it up.
John shook his head in confusion before he remembered not to do that because it damned well hurt. "Um, why'd they do that? Who's responsible?"
"No. Some things take time. I've been remembering m'gran, the one with the dahlias. She was an amateur naturalist, taught me about botany, entomology, things like that. I forgot so much," (he resolutely ignored Sherlock's knowing snort) "but I remember the butterflies. She had a butterfly garden, and one summer I got to see one hatch.
He'd have to remember to turn off comments on John's blog as well. He'd make this work. John would come around and everything would be fine. He just needed to keep him distracted until then.
Righteous indignation surrounded her like a cloud of cheap perfume. "Well, we'll hope he'll come around eventually. That does happen sometimes, you know, especially if—well, at any rate, just see if he gets any of my fairy cakes if he's going to look down his nose at John! Such a nice young man, and a
Mycroft breathed with the unnatural stiffness of a man with a cracked rib. John squinted at Sherlock's bound arm and wondered what they weren't telling him. Probably more than he could imagine.
“Ooh! You should talk with them—Mrs Turner's boys, I mean. She says they've been together for ages. I'm sure they'd have some good advice for the two of you.” She frowned momentarily, looking at the gag. “Although I’m not sure you should take
Sherlock wandered into the room in his dressing gown, hair wet from his own shower. He saw Mycroft, grunted sourly, and continued on to the refrigerator, where he extracted one of Mrs Hudson's currant buns and began pulling off bites with his fingers, noisily popping them into his mouth and spitting out the fruit.
"You mean that you're after him for his money and he's been addled by shagging a bit of rough?"
John, simple creature that he was, just looked miserable.

Sherlock, as always, lay comatose as John disentangled himself, and if John's hands slid over his bare ankles as he placed them back on the sofa, it was only because he was setting his legs down gently.
He shifted a pile of journals from the chair seat to the floor, then from there to the top of another stack on the desk. That left him holding the headphones, about which he dithered momentarily before tossing them onto the newly emptied chair because he
Sherlock's expression was half pity, half disbelief. "You actually think that's true. What must that be like, to persist in a delusion in the face of all evidence to the contrary?"

He inhaled surreptitiously as he took the phone. Flat, sterile scent beneath cheap human shampoo and soap, none of the complex richness of alpha or omega. Body language rigidly military: not re-acclimatised to civilian life. When distracted, the man placed weight evenly on both legs despite the bad limp when walking: psychosomatic, then. Traumatic injury, other post-traumatic symptoms now that he knew to look for them: wounded in action.
Yeah, he understood that it wouldn't even occur to Sherlock to say anything. What he didn't get was why John hadn't either.
Excellent, thought John. Now just keep him distracted long enough for me to drink my bloody tea and escape.
“Biography of Freddy Mercury,” John answered, and then turned to Sherlock, eyes bright, and said, “That was amazing.”

Greg felt his neck flush. God
Mycroft closed his eyes and sighed, mask slipping momentarily. He looked weary and injured and whilst John knew any expression of vulnerability from the elder Holmes was calculated, he was just as sure this one wasn't manufactured. "Please, John. There are things you must know."
By virtue of acquaintance with some former military mates who were now mercen—er, private peacekeeping forces, John had access to some very, very private websites. On those websites, there was every so often a photo of one of these, with its proud owner showing off injuries sustained while acquiring or retaining possession of said item. With something very like reverence, he lifted it out of the cardboard and gently shook it open. Strangely, when he did so, a pair of socks fell out onto the floor, but he ignored them in favour of the prize in his hands.

"—a Jain, where are the lanterns?"
The good doctor was making a heroic effort, but clearly the body was weaker than the spirit and he was flagging. He hoped Sherlock would remember to let the man sleep at least a short while.
"Fuck," said the cabbie. She lay curled protectively around her arm on the pavement where she'd been thrown when the cab rocked upon impact. John fumbled for the door latch, slid as soon as he stepped out of the cab, and ended up on his knees beside her. "Jesus Christ," he groaned, and they grinned at each other through gritted teeth and laughed.

“Full, less one round.  And yes, I had figured they weren't going to walk him into headquarters.  I doubt they've even let Harris know where that is.”
He'd seen how Sherlock turned down advances when he didn't return the interest. He didn't so much have a razor-sharp tongue as a machete in his mouth, but worse than the vicious, frigid words—God, poor Molly—was the utter
Now Sherlock did look at him, faintly puzzled. "John?"
“Yes, Sir.”

But Sherlock didn't have that excuse. John's genius flatmate had deduced—John winced as he realised—within
"Let. Me. Out of here."
How lonely did a man have to be to crawl into his flatmate's bed for a scrap of comfort and human touch? It made his chest hurt to think about it, and all his anger at the deception and his need for revenge drained away. It was a stupid plan—meta-plan—anyway. That had been an awfully nice suit, though, and he was still pissed off at Sherlock for throwing it out the window. It wasn't like he had another couple of hundred pounds to just toss around like that. John sighed. To Sherlock, money was something that happened to other people.
It was sleep deprivation, that's all. He'd spent the last two nights in his chair in front of the telly—not his bed,
In the time it took him to hail a ride, he could have walked home on a better day, one without ice or a swollen knee. He was beyond being annoyed by then and was just grateful to be inside the cab.

Of course there was a trust fund. Naturally. The people he was going to be introduced to saw the world in terms of trust funds and politically, financially expedient relationships and he should remember that. And of course he didn't mind if the whole bloody country knew he was shagging a man—it wasn't as if it mattered if the women he'd dated would wonder if he'd been closeted the whole time. Lately they'd all thought that anyway.
The man tilted his head as if Greg had just done something interesting, and after a slow, lazy moment, he challenged lightly, “What would you suggest?”
Somehow, all that crossed a line John hadn't known he had.
happy news. Felicitations, Brother. John," he gave a shallow bow in John's direction, and his mouth twisted with something approaching real pain. "I'd welcome you to the family, but I wouldn't wish us Holmeses on anyone I like," he said, and tapped down the stairwell.
"—conspire with me against him, I know. I'd never ask you to betray his trust, John. I'd never put you in a position where you'd have to agree to that."
Sherlock had known how John felt about him. Had probably—no, make that definitely (because this was Sherlock, after all)—known long before John had admitted it to himself. And he'd done nothing.
"It's not bad."
“As bad as that.”

John thought it through.  “You're seconded to Mycroft, but you've a primary mission objective from someone higher up.”
“Moderate.”
“Oh, please. You need me too mu—”
He added, “If Waterhouse agrees to support the charge of treason, Mycroft will be safe again. Once the information has been disseminated, it will be pointless for Fitzhugh's people to target Mycroft any longer. They'll begin hiding their own tracks instead.”
Robbie's a practical man. All Dog Squad men are, but especially the ones who work with cadaver dogs. You can't be delicate and train dogs to respond to the scents of blood, of brains and guts and bone, of death. Holmes was practical too, and Robbie knows he'd have appreciated the gesture. So he calls his mate Jason, who's training up a new bitch at the Met Police Dog centre, just a pup yet but showing some talent. He says he has a site to test her responses in the field to blood and death and maybe brain matter, given the nature of the fatality. Meet him at Bart's.
“Why did you do it?” John finally asked. “The truth, please. You knew I didn't want to get hitched yet, so why?”
He pressed his lips to the flapping ones below him. “Yeah, fuck you, you tosser.” He grinned, still a bit cross-eyed. “As many times as I bloody like, in fact.”
Everything changed when he came into his heats.
God damn it, just because he had a concussion didn't mean he had sodding amnesia and he sure as hell didn't need to be coddled.
"Not leaving just means neither of us leaves. Being happy with each other takes much more work, and it takes
Three drinks later, he'd had a flattering amount of attention paid to him and was beginning to realise he could afford to be choosier than he'd thought. He was still reeling in a very pleasant way from turning down an offer of a threesome (and wondering what the hell was wrong with him,
He'd see a solicitor on Monday, get the divorce started. He supposed it should have been harder, sadder, to put an end to things, but really, Holmes (twat though he was) had been right. She was cheating, had been for a long time, and the marriage never had been what it should have been. No, it wasn't hard.
The kissing was lovely and hungry and started a burn low in Greg's belly. He took his time, sliding hands up and down the wiry back for a long, long while before undoing buttons and pushing fine cotton halfway off. There was more chest hair than Greg had expected, and freckles peppering pale shoulders. And oh,
No sooner had the handshake ended than Mycroft had materialised at Sherlock's side. "Helen, how is your grandfather? Please give him my regards when you speak to him next. It would be a pleasure to have him for dinner when he's in the city. If you'll excuse me, I'm afraid I must steal away my brother; there's someone he really must meet. Sherlock, if you will." And just like that they were gone, and if John hadn't known to look for it he would never have seen the stiffness in Mycroft's carriage from his injured ribs.
"Did you set all of this up?"
"I never was, you idiot; no-one with any sense believes that's a possibility. I hadn't realised
On his second trip over the bridge, he stopped and leaned against the handrail, looking down at the water and blowing out his breath. The rain had turned to sleet, so he'd have to start back soon. Time to stop being a dick and think it all through.
Harris was having a serious think about using his socks as a gag. Risking frostbite seemed worth the trouble.
Their next attempt was no better, and after that, they did not try again.
"Mmmmmm." John trailed his fingers down Sherlock's torso and lower. Sherlock caught them gently.
But he turned anyway.
"—is out. It's just us here."
Mycroft hit the floor of the gazebo, his lax body slumped in dark puddles, limbs slack, and John calmly turned whilst Harris planted his feet wide and trained his own gun on John.

Being English, he'd gone right home and washed it all out.

Sherlock snorted.
somebody who knows how to do things properly is teaching Sherlock Holmes how to get on. Watson's free with his praise for the right things, he's good about correcting and then ignoring bad behaviour, and he seems to understand that when a man or a dog has done a hard task, he needs to self-reward.
Waterhouse. The third of the great triumvirate of Mycroft's cronies.
He debated calling Mycroft's house to have CCTV track the black car with the fresh, wide scrape down its left side, but there might be more than one spy and he didn't know who to trust. He couldn't even send someone to fetch Mycroft from the gazebo, although the man must be freezing and probably had broken bones, maybe even a partially collapsed lung; half-armour or not, a bullet from a Browning at that range packed a hell of a punch. John wasn't sure what Sherlock was to Fitzhugh if Mycroft was dead, but Mycroft alive meant Sherlock was a hostage to use as leverage so they couldn't risk that getting out.
He went east, away from the big parks and their bloody swans, and watched his breath puff in the cold air with each stride.
John looked again. “I don't imagine it does any of those things, actually, since you pithed it.”

The long-term one, on the other hand...
and he was going to act like one.
Sherlock had been pacing, making abortive attempts at playing the violin, and irritably refusing to eat while stealing John's cups of tea for hours. John had been making replacement tea without milk and savagely cursing what the frequent resulting trips to the toilet did to his knee. Mrs Hudson's presentation of John's hated old crutch (which he'd binned months ago, but "waste not, want not" was one of Mrs Hudson's favoured idioms) did not help his eroding temper. Unable to fall back on his habit of going for a walk when Sherlock became too obnoxious to bear, he was entertaining thoughts of bludgeoning the git with the kettle.
and wanted it from this boy
"And you still ate—never mind. This isn't about the curry. No—" John held up a silencing hand. "—I don't want to hear it. I'm going for a shower."
"Yes." The packet disappeared somewhere into Sherlock's clothes. Sherlock looked at him, and they both wheezed out a fresh bout of laughter, drunk on danger and thrill and triumph.
“I realise this is anathema to an upper-class, repressed British male of your age, but as your consultant I need this information. How many episodes in the past week?”
“My goddaughter was killed by one of their damned IEDs.”
Sherlock made a terrible sound when John kissed him. John knew that sound: it was the one you made when you'd hurt for so long that the absence of pain came as a shock. He let it buckle his knees, let himself slide down the long, warm body until he could press his face into the stomach above a belted waistband. His hands slid up the thighs on either side of him, and Sherlock made another awful noise when John tugged his shirt out of his trousers and ran his lips over bare skin.
The doorway was empty.
, who is the best beta anyone could ask for. If you're enjoying this story, please thank her for her effort, because it would be very, very different without her. All blunders are my own.
John's eyes narrowed. Sherlock was breathing rapidly and he’d jerked his jaw, the one tell he never seemed to be aware of. “What are you planning?”
He wondered if it was also Not Good for him to be so ridiculously pleased that before he'd been immobilised, John had broken Banks' ulna in three places, dislocated one soldier's knee, and bitten another's wrist to the point where it was a bloody mess. He wasn't sure he approved of that last, however. If anyone were to bear the scars of John's teeth, it ought to be Sherlock, in some private place for only the two of them to share.
"Jesus, I hope not. He was breathing when I took his phone but I don't know how bad his injuries are. He said he couldn't be a hostage."

Diabetes. Why would he think Banks had diabetes?
"Just trying to get your attention."
"Are there two different groups?"
like that, actually.”
“Leave. You're a distraction.” John risked a glance sideways. Sherlock had stopped tapping and was staring fixedly at the mobile.
This time John sighed and squeezed his eyes shut in a series of hard blinks.
Sherlock briefly craned his neck and went back to the paper. “It's a ball gag, Mrs Hudson.”

Unspoken but clearly understood amongst the three of them was that John, with his open face and warm manner, so clearly the naif outsider in these rarified circles and obviously unused to political intrigue (civilians, he'd come to realise, were astonishingly ignorant about what an officer posted to Kandahar Province might know about political intrigue and backstabbing), would be their stalking-goat to draw out the enemy. People often underestimated and dismissed him. People liked to talk to him and thought they didn't have to be so careful around the friendly bloke with the ready laugh. He'd always found that useful, and now so did Mycroft.
“Your proposed solution is that I hold your emergency cocaine for you and you sign emergency divorce papers for me.”
but at least he was safe now. Something didn't seem quite right about that bit but it was fine because he had fresh chips in front of him and that made everything all right.
He looked across the room, and Sherlock returned his gaze with lazy heat, lifting one corner of his mouth, then deliberately turning his head aside to charm a silver-haired doyenne. John repressed a shiver and turned to shake the hand of the young man Helen had beckoned over. Remembering Mycroft's warning from the night before, he took care to keep his stance relaxed, kept
he thought.
“Trust issues,” Sherlock murmured, letting his hand slide down and turning away—a small, unexpected kindness. “Who was your Victor, my John?” And he glided out on cat's feet, slipping the door shut behind him.
“You never come close enough for me to smell you again.”
“Your therapist,” said the suit as he reached into the inner pocket of his jacket and withdrew a small brown notebook, “thinks you have suicidal tendencies stemming from depression. For God's sake, get rid of her. She can't even tell that the reason you're losing weight is that you've inadequate funds for meals.”
from each other. You're in my blood; I'm in yours. How do you think you didn't say yes to this one thing? How do you not understand? You're not that dim, so what else is going on?”
Sherlock propped himself up on one arm and trailed his fingers through John's hair. Waiting, John realised. He took a steadying breath and told himself he could not in good conscience refuse to do something his lover had just done for him and which he had on several memorable occasions literally begged other lovers to do. He let his fingers curl around Sherlock, ran his thumb in circles over the slick head. The body under him arched, and he looked up to see silver eyes locked on his own face. Slowly he lowered his head and ran his tongue over the path his thumb had taken.
When the footsteps had faded, Mycroft let himself curl into a ball of agony. Every breath sent spears of blinding red through his chest, focusing his attention exquisitely inwards. He lay in puddles of freezing water; he'd be risking exposure if he couldn't get to his feet soon. At least to his hands and knees, off the ground, he told himself, but bones shifted when he tried and he exhaled hard through his nose, stifling sound, and lay still just a moment longer.

"Here," he said. "It has tracking permanently enabled and it's unblockable, which won't do you a bloody bit of good if you're taken because the first thing any halfway competent professional will do is get rid of your phone. But we'll be able to find you if you wander off with a head injury, which you do seem to acquire with unnerving frequency. You know the effects can be cumulative, don't you?"
He spun and unlatched John's window. “I know how to fix this.” He stepped onto the ledge and scrambled onto the roof.
The reagent was finally at the proper concentration and the experiment was at a delicate stage but progressing very nicely when John stormed into the kitchen and shook Mycroft's damned jacket under his nose, blocking his view of the flask. "Did you bring up marriage because of this?" he demanded. Sherlock impatiently pushed it aside, craning his neck to watch the flask. He'd need to add the copper as soon as the foaming started.
Frequently, Mycroft despaired of the human race. Was it really not
The leather jacket still fit, though not as snugly through the shoulders anymore and a little tight over the belly if Greg zipped it up. It was 22 degrees out and zipping would have been ridiculous anyway.
He didn't try to go for the gun under his pillow. He'd never make it, not with his leg, and the thought of being shot in the back was more than he could bear.

he snarled down the staircase in response to the damned doorbell. He needed to talk to John and tying up Mycroft's loose ends was going to be boring. “He's going to keep at me until this is done. Please be here when I come back.”
Oh, bollocks. Brain death was the only one that mattered, and he'd been full minutes away from that. Sherlock scoffed. Tried to. The endotracheal tube had badly irritated his throat and the sounds he made were not the ones he had intended.
They both let stand the fiction that John could be placed unsupported into a wet environment because really, it was better that way.
He blinked his surroundings into focus. Sherlock was crouched in front of him, hair wild, mouth bruised, cheek scraped and bleeding. The scarf hanging out of the pocket near John was wet; he must have used it to...clean himself. John turned his face away, shame burning his gut. "I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."
He suspected he would dream about it later nonetheless.

He was too late with the copper. He'd have to start over.
“Oh, don't try to convince me that was anything but a cover story to plant a bodyguard with your brother.”
"I can't see him tolerating that. He'd see it as a prison, a straitjacket."
"Flattered as I am at your priorities, that will have to wait until we're home."

Only once he heard the black car idling beneath his window pull away did Sherlock snarl.
"I need more than that."
no—until exhaustion had him nodding off for a few moments, only to jerk violently awake, slapping at the phantom draughts shifting his hair around, heart pounding, throat dry. All. Bloody. Night. For two nights.
Sherlock's lips twitched. "That's one way of putting it into perspective." And there, the easiness between them was back. John drew a deep breath and let his shoulders relax.
He blinked. There was a beat where he and Tobin glanced at each other, suddenly realising what this looked like from Harris's point of view. Tobin twitched his chin downward:
John said nothing. Loudly.
, you idiot,
"John Watson. And it's fine, really. Would you like another glass of wine whilst you tell me all about the rest of the people here? Particularly the ones who were rude to me?" He grinned. After a beat, she laughed and looked relieved.

6.) Because if he's gay, does that mean all his relationships with women were lies? That they didn't count? Because there were women who mattered, who changed him, did things to his heart, and he hadn't been lying to them. If he's gay, is what they meant to him deleted?
I don’t know if you’ve ever gone through one by yourself, but it really goddamned hurts. I couldn’t think about anything else. Couldn’t think at all.
"Gave me a bit of a funny turn too, I don't mind saying. You've think you've seen it all and then some poor sod has his family jewels taken off with a belt sander."

"I'm quite good with my phone."
John was towelling off and realising he hadn't detoured for his dressing gown before showering when he heard voices in the front room. Well, one voice and a lot of thumping. He cocked his head at the seam of the door to listen more closely.
It would be over soon.  Then Mycroft could sit down and rest and
Damn it. Damn the Holmeses and their ability to dangle just the right bait. "What is it?" he asked, almost against his will.
# # #
"Get these off." Sherlock unfastened John's cufflinks and dropped them into the chair. "What? We'll remember where they are."
They regarded each other. The colonel looked into the darkness after Harris, nodded thoughtfully, and said matter-of-factly, "We're fucking screwed."
He dropped his visor, struck the flame, and squinted thoughtfully. Yes. Start with the collar.
Sherlock brushed his lips over his temple, which tasted faintly of the ocean and wholly of John. "Yes," he said. "Amazing."
Damn this headache, anyway. It was okay. He'd be home soon, and then he'd get a hot shower, some tea, paracetamol, and dry pants, and sit by the fire and explain to Sherlock why you didn't get married because your brother gave your lover a very nice piece of body armour, although he himself was becoming increasingly unclear on why that was so.
Mycroft, who had walked him around the garden long past the time it would have taken to call for a car to the safe-house. Mycroft, who had a dozen reasons for every action, poking and prodding his brother's partner about their intimate life, keeping John distracted...so he would react naturally when the time was right.
"You keep asking me that. Is there a reason I shouldn't?"
After a few moments of silence, the bastard mused absently, “Your new Chief Superintendent is known for such...rigid habits of mind. Little tolerance for unconventionality, particularly for...proclivities that could be said to be the cause of marital dissolution. So difficult to prove discrimination when one's superiors simply argue that one's current rank is the one beyond which one has not the talent to advance. However should such a thing be refuted?”
“Jesus Christ, don’t look at me like that. I wouldn’t fuck a kid even if he’d been willing, much less—
A haughty sniff, and his brother turned away to leave. He stopped with his hand on the doorknob. Examining the brass minutely, he said, "He doesn't...like suits. He likes jumpers."
"Our arrangement! Yes?"
No words are adequate to sufficiently thank my much-beloved beta,
Someone who was not Anthea stepped out, opened the door and waited.
“John Watson, Sherlock Holmes,” said Stamford.
My dear beta did make me aware that John's gun as shown in the series is not a Browning, despite Moriarty's description in The Great Game, but rather a Sig Sauer. I chose to stick with Browning for various reasons. Blame me, not her.
"I have milk waiting." John stalked towards the door.
"If he's at all harmed because of what you've done—"
"So do you, in so many ways. You leave me behind in more ways than I can count. Even when you're

"Mrs Hudson?"
"You know," John said, even though the smarter part of his brain was urgently waving its metaphorical arms

John thought.
Life with Sherlock was like being continuously concussed. He wondered idly how he would ever be able to tell if he had traumatic brain injury, given what passed for normal on any given day.
and tossed it at him, crowing.
John had started to speak twice and stopped himself; Sherlock ran a hand up the long line of his arm and shoulder and said, "Ask."
John reflexively dropped into a crouch when the door smashed open, reaching for a sidearm that wasn't there since he was only in his pants and socks. "What—?" he started before Sherlock flung himself down on the bed.
"They won't be that crude," said Sherlock. "It won't be an attack. It'll be a spy."
"Sherlock explained this may be a matter of treason? Then you understand the need for tact and discretion, and you understand that all matters concerning tact will fall to you. More urgently, I need you to understand how important it is that Sherlock succeeds.
You don't make
coming as well.
"Of course you were."
He was lying, he knew Sherlock was lying and Mycroft was in the house, probably somewhere where he could hear them but apparently John had a kink about some part of that (which he would
“Would you,” he starts, and he feels his neck flushing. “Would you like to come to supper? I've a chicken for roasting. It's just...” He swallows. In his experience, if something's going to go wrong, this is when it happens. “I need to walk my dog first.”
John felt a strange pulsing warmth in his trouser pocket and started. Mycroft's phone. Right. Nothing as prosaic as a vibrate setting for the elder Holmes. He pulled the fabric out just enough to let him view the screen, cupping his hand over the top to block its glow. There was a text from a number he didn't recognise.
, who worked their magic on this chapter and then did it a
“It's good to see you boys have made up,” Mrs Hudson called up the stairs after them as they slammed the doors to the flat shut and proceeded to ensure they'd be receiving a second pointed gift from the neighbours.
They both knew rain did not ruin a well made suit. That wasn't what was happening here.
And Robbie hadn't liked Anderson from that moment on because the way he talked about Holmes had reminded Robbie of the way some of the constables used to talk about Jamie when she was just doing her job and doing it damned well. Besides that, he had heard the man use “bitch” as an insult, which was not a fit way to think of woman nor dog.
"I'm fine."
When John came to himself again, he was grinding Sherlock's cheek into the concrete and spewing vile obscenities. Sherlock's trousers were tangled about his knees, and John had his free hand around his cock and was shoving himself brutally into the arse under him. He grinned sadistically at Sherlock's sharp yelp and pulled the hair in his fist tighter.
I am seriously going to stick a fork in my eye in despair.
“Robert MacIntyre,” she says, “do you mean to tell me you've left your poor dog cooped up for the last two and a half hours whilst we were sat around in a bloody pub?”
"I haven't changed my mind about rushing things."

He yawned and was debating the merits of just falling asleep like this and dealing with the itching later when Sherlock poked his bicep and announced, “I want tea.”
flipped down the visor and stalked off to his bedroom.
John pointed to the mantle with his entirely unnecessary cane. “That's a real skull.” He swung the cane to point at the wall. “Is it jealous of the one with headphones and the better view?”
. Every day. Right to the door." He sat up and reached for Sherlock. "I need to fuck you. Right now. I know you're planning the whole desk scenario and I want that, I really do, but that's hours away and I need you right now."
Sherlock just sat there with his I Do Not Know How Your Funny Little Brain Comes Up With These Notions expression whilst John picked out the rubbish until John sighed and said, "Don't be that stupid again," which earned him a glare and a sniff. "Have you heard what all this was about?"
Nothing sounded right. Finally the cacophony grated his own nerves raw and he tossed his bow into the chair and just raked his fingers over his head again and again. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it.
He could start planning his revenge, though, since stroppiness would be the proper state of mind for that. For truly poetic justice there should be symmetry, so...lots of confusion for Sherlock. John had no illusions about his ability to take on the man in terms of intelligence but in terms of deviousness he'd give himself even odds or better.
"It's not a night for sleeping. Too much—" he ruffled his hands through his hair sharply. "I can't settle tonight. My mind is whirling and there's nothing to do all damned day when all the criminals appear to be icebound."
That sounded promising. Perhaps there were biscuits. The hallway smelt of baking and Mrs Hudson was always generous with her sweet buns, saying Sherlock needed feeding up. He subtly sucked in his cheeks and stepped into her flat to kiss her forehead.

If it had been just
John would not voluntarily remain out of contact for this length of time under these circumstances, therefore something was preventing him from communicating.
Three and a half weeks later his wife said she'd like to try again, and he discovered just how big a coward he really was.
It was suddenly very hard to breathe.
All through his childhood, alphas had been bigger, stronger, meaner, dominating the sport he wanted to play, shoving and snarling for status. The omegas were told again and again to be patient, to let them have their fun while it lasted. Some of the adults looked at the loud, pushy alphas with something like pity when they said that, but John just gritted his teeth and learned to shove back until the packs knew to leave him and his friends alone.
“You—I
“Of course, Sergeant.”
"Whether you agree to our arrangement."
although the fabric of that shirt was still crisp, Greg tasted salt on skin when he tongued a nipple, and it was wonderful.
Right. That strategy explained some of the anomalies he was seeing, but not all. John kept flipping through the chart. He backed up, read the test results again, examined the monitor readouts. “He did have an MI, and his lung was partially collapsed but a chest drain sorted that out. That's good,” he added for Sherlock's benefit. “He's had periods of consciousness?” Murray nodded. “His response patterns are...atypical,” he noted. “He's intermittently alert but doesn't speak—” He had, in fact, become more confused and disoriented over time rather than less.
Sherlock understood now, after the pool, understood how it was possible to be haunted by something that would not stay deleted, and how, even more oddly, the incident did not need to actually have occurred in order to haunt.
Something huge, white, very angry, and fast beat the shit out of him. Somehow, feathers were involved.
sometimes, he would say yes, and not realize the planned post-pub activity was sex instead of football on telly until the child had his tongue in John's mouth. Drunk, lonely, sexually frustrated John Watson, who continually insisted he was not gay but who was addicted to the rush of adrenaline, of surprise, of uncontrolled impulse.
# # #
John stilled abruptly, looking across the dark garden. "Quiet," he said softly. "Your patrol hasn't made their latest circuit. The safety light at the gate is out. Who knows you're outside the house?" He crossed to Mycroft and swiftly shoved him into a crouch near a support pillar, shielding him with his own body. "How much do you trust your colonel?"
He made a long, slow time of it. So many things he'd missed, so many things he'd regretted never doing with a man. A one-night stand, an anonymous fuck, no-one he'd ever have to face again. Bollocks-deep, he leaned forward, snugged his arms around the lean, sweat-slick shoulders, pressed kisses to hot skin. He poured lube over the head of the man’s cock, held it in a slick fist and fucked his foreskin with an index finger; when the man cried out, utterly shocked, Greg managed only seconds more before he groaned and pulled out and barely got the condom off in time to come over the sleek back beneath him, rub it all over smooth skin.
He was not at all surprised to find Sherlock sitting on his bed when he came out of the shower.
After several long minutes of nothing, John levered himself to his feet with the cane and stumped out onto the pavement. A woman looked up from her mobile, blinked at him vaguely, and said, “This way.”
Meanwhile, Sherlock had deduced River was Rory's daughter and the killer in the spacesuit but as the programme still had the full series less one episode to run John probably wouldn't appreciate his mentioning it. There had been a sharp and emphatic discussion about how
It was different this time. John was slow, so, so slow. He kissed not with the urgent drawing and thrusting of the night before, but with soft presses and pulls. Sherlock shuddered and tried to grasp his neck to bring him down, but John just smiled, shook his head, and continued the slow, soft touches. It wasn't enough.
Mycroft's people traced him to a magistrate's, where he'd been scheduled to receive an ASBO. A note in the report stated the man had minor injuries and a possible concussion but had refused medical treatment, saying he was a doctor and lived with a flatmate experienced in first aid.
The solution was, of course, obvious once the third data point was factored in. Sherlock examined the plan from several angles. Oh, it was
Impossible not to remember the last time this had happened.
the best present she could think of.
He'd felt a whisper of touch as Sherlock had moved off, and when he casually slipped his hand into his pocket his fingers closed over slips of embossed metal on a chain.
He shook it off. First things first. “Give me details. Are you with him?”
"No idea."
"Er, Mycroft?"

reprovingly. “Patience, Dr Watson. There is a rhythm to these things. First I put on a show of intimidation, next I explain how I may be of service to you, and then you to me. And then the stick, should the carrot prove inadequate. You've created quite a stir in certain circles. You have enemies in high places. You need friends in similarly lofty places. I could be your friend, Doctor.”
By 03.00, it was simply absurd to go back to the bedsit for a few hours' sleep before moving his scant possessions to Baker Street, and when Sherlock yawned and said, “Mrs Hudson put my spare sheets in the linen cupboard; you may as well take them upstairs to your bed,” John yawned too and nodded and slept that night with Sherlock's faint scent tickling his still-stuffy nose.
Finally John straightened to put his back against the wall, pressing a hand to the stitch in his side, breath slowing.
John shrugged. "It sounded interesting."
# # #
Sherlock tightened his hands around John's thighs and shook his head violently. John hesitated, and Sherlock rolled his eyes exasperatedly and—
He waited, detachedly, for her to realise he was Not One of Us in spite of his new suit ("This belongs to
"I'd like to...try an experiment. Come upstairs."
that was and tapped the icon. "We can follow them."
When the suit had been delivered (along with a shirt, tie, and pair of shoes John didn't remember buying), Sherlock had grudgingly admitted it was a nice suit, glared at the tie as if it had insulted his mother, and flung himself onto the sofa, knees up, to curl his lip at the ceiling. John's eyes had naturally gone straight to that arse, and that's when he decided he was going to the barber's to buy hair product.
Sherlock came from time to time on the pretext of updating him regarding Fitzhugh's clandestine trial. John came to visit out of a sense of guilt and obligation. Sherlock held himself stiffly, anxious eyes tracking John when he thought no-one could see, and John tried so hard to forgive that it left Mycroft frightened at his inability to do so.
None of them return whole, not in body nor mind.
The day had passed with a pleasant undercurrent, anticipation pooling thick and heavy in his groin even throughout his loathsome circumnavigation of the garden. He had so little else to occupy his mind. He filled it with images of dragging his fingertips down through the hair of Greg's abdomen, sweeping across the curve of his inner thigh. As the afternoon gave way to dusk, he showered again and took special care shaving.
, John thought,
"This will dope him up a bit," the doctor cautioned Greg. "He'll be wobbly and unco-ordinated, and he's already unsteady because of that knee so be careful to support him even if he doesn't seem to need it. Are you certain he won't take the tablets? He's going to hurt like hell tomorrow morning."
“The only way to make absolutely sure you’re dead is for me to cut your head off myself. I should have known better.”
Sherlock protestingly clamped his body around him and oh, hell, that nearly did it but somehow John hung on. It was a close thing, though, and he smacked his hand against Sherlock's frantically squirming arse and snapped, “Damn it,
"You did. Right. That's...fine. All right."
“You're missing the point.”
"Damn, my knee hurts." John shifted his shoulders to get more comfortable and closed his eyes. A moment later he half-opened them, found Sherlock's, and murmured, "Not tired?"
There was warmth at his shoulder and then the mattress sank. “I am sorry.”
After a moment, John turned and followed him.
"Mmmmmm, nice." John tilted his head into Sherlock's hand and sighed. "M'head really sodding hurts."
Using his release time as a starting point, they were eventually able to locate CCTV footage of a very bedraggled and limping Dr Watson getting into a cab and then set about following the cab's progress. The many accidents on the roads and the smeared-image quality of footage filmed through heavy sleet made this more difficult than it should have been.
He handed Watson back the phone and baited the hook. “Afghanistan or Iraq?”
John wasn't at all sure how he managed to get up and walk after that, but he did while Sherlock squirmed out of his trousers and shoes and came to the fireplace, where he stripped off his shirt and spread himself enticingly over the blanket.
Rummaging in the pocket of his hanging jacket for his wallet, he found his hands slowing, then pulling the jacket to his face for a closer sniff.
Sherlock had never known him as a practicing surgeon. Since he'd returned to England he'd treated colds at the clinic and stitched Sherlock's split lip after an encounter with the butt of a fish knife, but the practice he'd trained for had been in hibernation since he was shot. Now he had work again,

. It exists whether or not we ever acknowledge it. I choose to accept fact and acknowledge it, however inconvenient it may be, in this part of my life as in all others. I’ve told you this repeatedly. Do you not listen at all?”
He ought to send a text. Sherlock was likely still in the middle of his experiment and hadn't even noticed John had gone, but he ought to text anyway. He'd left the shopping on the kitchen floor.

secret thrill while John twisted himself into knots wondering if that thing he sometimes thought he saw between them (the one everybody else seemed to see without any contortions at all) was real or all in his head.
John and Tobin pelted towards the noise as soon as they heard it, staying to the wooded edges of the field for cover.
The ambulance had made very slow progress; accidents blocked streets all over the city and treacherous curtains of ice on the road surface kept traffic to a crawl. Only emergency vehicles were permitted to be out.
"That," said John, easing himself off and collapsing next to Sherlock, "wasn't something I thought I'd ever do a month ago. Jesus, everything with you is just amazing
Sherlock would probably have something cutting to say about that flight of sentiment, but Sherlock made fun of him for many things and John wasn't much inclined to change important parts of himself just because of that. A decent bloke didn't lay open someone's body and heart and soul that way and then leave, even if that someone said a body was transport and he didn't have a heart and nobody had a soul. You just didn't do that, didn't knock down someone's walls and then leave him vulnerable and alone. The two of them could just order takeaway again, it wouldn't matter for another night.
And it was all fine. Much more than fine.
"—at Mycroft's beck and call, it had to be
"Right, then. What are the orders?"
"Where," said Sherlock slowly, "did you get that suit?"
"They looked like beetles. I wasn't much into beetles. I liked her bees, though." He looked around the echoing room again and took a deep breath. "Sherlock? Mycroft...thinks it's really important you solve this one."
He could have told himself it was because John needed the comfort; clearly his nightmares had returned. He could have said it was insurance against John's anger if he found out about the registrar's. He knew very well, though, that those were partial truths at best, and to himself, if to no one else, he could admit the yearning and
He couldn't. He was pretty sure that was part of the problem, and a symptom of a much greater one.  He screwed his eyes shut and pressed the heel of his hand to his forehead.

of it.”
"Dr Watson, Sir," said the man behind him. Retired SAS, dressed to blend with the crowd, which made him look exactly like an ex-military bodyguard trying to blend with the crowd. "Mr Holmes sends his regards, and says that in the interest of avoiding further Audi-related accidents, I'm to be your escort, Sir." John was slowly working through that when the man realized simplicity was key. "I'm to take you home, Sir."
“No.”
Sherlock paced, hands raking through his hair, mind spinning wildly.
Sherlock brushed it off. “We'll all be leaving soon. He has a whole passel of doctors fussing over him now; no room for one more body in that jumble.”
"You said you wanted the blood on my hands," John said. "You meant the killing, I know, but it's this too, Sherlock. Time to decide. Did you mean it, that you want it all?"
“Fine. If sex isn't going to facilitate renewed emotional and chemical bonding, it's not worth the bother of orgasm.”
He had a new nightmare now, to add to the ones about Whitehall and the morgue. In this one, his thoughtless,
It was an understandable mistake, if unfortunate. He sighed. "As you say, he's never met Sherlock. Don't look so anxious, Summers, I'm not going to have him fired, but make sure he understands that nothing concerning my brother is ever classified as low priority, won't you?"
# # #
After a moment he closed his mouth, cleared his throat, and said in a tone that fell far short of the outrage he'd been aiming for, "Did you just threaten me?"
“Oh.”
Second, Sherlock was deeply dissatisfied with John's current arrangement of semi-casual relationships—
Sherlock's head popped up hopefully. "Any unsolved—"
Mycroft."
Mycroft had taken advantage of the request to use John to bring Sherlock to heel (and oh, he would pay for that), but why had John approached him at all? John could be distressingly slow at times, but his natural self-preservation should have kept him away from that piranha. This required thought.

Seven hours into an ice storm that gridlocked London, Mycroft's phone pinged.
When Sherlock returned, he looked very closely at Mycroft in a way he had not done for years, observing, cataloguing, processing new data, sifting through Mycroft's mind in a distinctly unpleasant and exposing manner.
"John, quickly now, the police will be coming. Can you stand?"
John never knew if it was by luck or design that Mycroft came by a few hours later whilst Sherlock was still in high dudgeon. Mrs Hudson had knocked on his bedroom door to inform him he had a visitor and added
John glanced into the box and promptly forgot how to breathe.
too self-absorbed to care what he could do for his country if he would only—
He'd only stayed on the bed for a little over half an hour before he'd sprung up and paced, but it had been a nice half hour. Looking at him stretched out and loose-limbed, John'd found himself recalling Sherlock's response to his old captain-voice and musing idly that silver dogtags would look very fine indeed against that long, lean neck. A sudden vision of holding a squirming, moaning Sherlock down by the tags in his fist whilst he roughly buggered him over—oh, Jesus Christ—
Aftereffects of the cabbie's drug, he knew, tricking his body, weakening his control, not his fault, and he thrust away a lingering dream fragment: strong hands holding him down, his hair pulled tight, his throat exposed, teeth on his nipple, a voice murmuring, “Brilliant. Amazing. Brilliant.”
"I thought you might like to review your patient's progress," Mycroft said, handing John a paper medical file.

was bitten off before it passed his lips. Sherlock smirked anyway. Mycroft deliberately turned his attention to John. "What have you found out?"
When he returned, John was in his chair by the banked fire, dried sweat staining the shirt he'd slept in. He took in Sherlock's fresh sweat, the weariness in his limbs, the semblance of peace or at least exhaustion settled over his features, and wordlessly opened his blanket to share.
“Where'd you learn about that?” Lestrade asked.
but it wasn't my place to say anything if you didn't tell me..." Her voice trailed off and her eyes were suspiciously bright. "You could have trusted me not to say anything, you know. I wouldn't have gossiped it about if you'd said—"
"Oh. Right." John sighed. "Guess I'd better let them get a CT scan."
"You—he was supposed to be brought in—"
his tailor.
lock,
Fuck.
John was actually speechless for a moment. Private school, doctor, Army officer—he knew he wasn't as posh as Sherlock's people and he certainly wasn't rich by any stretch of the imagination but he could honestly say he'd never been referred to as anyone's bit of rough before. "Er."
even a totally not-gay (not that there's anything wrong with that) bloke—then a totally not-gay bloke could come to terms with it. And he could also come to terms with those disturbingly not-exactly-totally-not-gay things his body did in response. But no way in hell was a bloke going to put himself through the therapy needed to admit he wished his flatmate's knee were wedged just a little bit higher when this whole scenario might be about measuring radon levels in tropical fish.
"As doing this jointly is going to be distasteful for me and borderline traumatic for you, I suggest we get it over with and never speak of it again," Sherlock muttered. "Help me walk him to the bathroom. I'll...put him in the shower. It'll have to be my room afterwards; his is upstairs."
John knew. That was bad, but bearable, that John knew, because John was part of him and it wasn't much different from knowing himself, not really. John understood it was precious and private and held close, wrapped in silence to protect it. It was...all right that John knew.
told him he'd been obeyed. “Twitch and you'll go through the rest of your short and painful life missing your depth perception.” He pressed his right thumb in slightly harder and reached for the gun to his left.
The homeless network hadn't spotted him and was increasingly unlikely to do so as individual members were forced to look for shelter from the ice storm.
He really hadn't seen that coming.
After a long while, John said, "If I tried to get a divorce, would any solicitor accept me as a client?"
"No, I don't. I
Mycroft did not know a great deal about firearms, but he could recognise the soft sound of a safety being thumbed off in an otherwise silent room.

As always, all blunders are my own.
He puked, he pissed himself, he told them everything they wanted to hear.”
In the relative silence that followed, a very small, very young voice in the back of his mind whispered,
Mouth dry, head reeling, heart hammering its way out of his body, he rasped, "Yes."
"There was a queue. I triaged myself and went for coffee until it cleared out."

Eleven men and women had been wounded protecting him and the interests of the nation. Three were dead. He had debts to repay.
“I understand,” she said quietly, “that antidepressants are not an option for a man in your position. In many cases an exercise programme can provide the same benefits. No-one would question your new dedication to cardiovascular health.” No stigma and no reason for anyone to look further into his motives, she meant.

When John's hands finally moved to Sherlock's nipples, he exhaled sharply in relief and half-rose off the bed to tear at John's clothing, but again John shook his head and pressed him back to the mattress. He trailed light, teasing fingers across his bare abdomen, sternum, ribs, running fire down Sherlock's spine and making his shoulders jerk involuntarily. "Shh, shh. Push into what feels good," John murmured in his ear, the warm breath bringing another rush of blood to his groin.

"Don't."

"That would be best," said Sherlock agreeably whilst crowding into Lestrade's personal space. "You'll want to be home early today. See what the wife's up to and all that."
"Yes, fine, whatever, damn it, I've got water all over the floor and I can't hear you."
It had been a false alarm, and he'd been so glad about that, was still so glad about that, because it would have been a right disaster then. But in that interminable night he'd lain in bed, staring at the ceiling, brain caught in an endless loop of
Sherlock had said, as near enough as John could remember, "We need to find the pruning secateurs and the lips. I've had my solicitor draw up papers and applied for the license so we can be married Wednesday morning."
"Do you think it is?"
Except that when John checked, the bottle of lube had only a few drops left in it, not nearly enough for another go. Maybe he was flattering himself that Sherlock would want another round before the next trip to the shop, but John had stitched up rectal tears before and thought that for the patient, the pain had to be almost as bad as knowing what the conversation was like among the staff at the hospital. Nor did he trust himself to stick with oral if Sherlock wanted to shag and got persuasive—okay, so, a lube run it was, but just a fast one.
"Mycroft wants his toy right away, it seems." Sherlock petulantly kicked a chunk of rubble to send it skittering down the street. The bodyguard, John was relieved to notice, did not overreact to the projectile or Sherlock's sudden and violent movement, but his weight shifted. Sherlock scanned the walls surrounding them. "Would serve him right if I—"
Molly Hooper had been raised to do the right thing, always, even when the right thing hurt. Her mother had believed that good manners were the foundation of a civilised society and that there was no excuse for shirking.
"Yes, very good, you do that and I'll go on and take these biscuits up to him. We'll be out for a few days, Mrs Hudson, so I'll just text you to get fresh milk on our way back."
What he had never anticipated was that John would look...empty.
“Bit different from my day,” said an unfamiliar voice with a likewise unfamiliar footfall pattern that came in with Mike and oh, this could be interesting because just this morning he'd mentioned—
