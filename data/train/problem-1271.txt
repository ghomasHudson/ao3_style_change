“Yeah…” John managed in a low whine. His hips were bearing down onto Sherlock’s fingers seemingly of their own accord. “Love…”
He huffed out a small laugh as he moved back through the crowd toward the kitchen with his empty tray. Maybe he should just go to America. He could pull there in a heartbeat, surely.
That would have to come later, though. Instead, he just let out the softest of sighs, and hoped John could read everything he was thinking in the depths of his gaze.
“Alright,” Sherlock murmured against his lips, then kissed him. It was tender and soft, and John sank into him. He tasted sweet, with a hint of tea and sugar in his breath.
Sherlock flung himself into the passenger seat, almost throwing his violin into the backseat as his dad started the car. They had long lost sight of the car John had been in by the time they got out of the car park, but Dad pressed the pedal to the floor and began weaving in and out of the traffic, flying off to Heathrow at a breakneck pace.
all the time; it was as if every part of his body was trying to distract him with pain, preventing him from figuring out what to do.
He pursed his lips together, apologetically, then leaned over Sherlock and grabbed the phone from the nightstand.
Tomorrow was another cabinet meeting; he groaned internally at the thought. They’d have to talk about that new stimulus bill…
Sherlock could feel little vibrations of motion carrying across the space between them – a shake of the head, maybe, or – a trembling of the lips?
“Not to worry, we’ll wait.” Sherlock looked pointedly back at John, eyes sparkling with mirth, his smile slightly stiff. “You won’t be up to it for a while, anyway.”
John let his hands roam along the expanse of Sherlock’s back, smoothing up the planes of his hard, taut muscles. He couldn’t get enough; he felt like he was drinking him in, pulling in his essence through touch alone, the warmth of Sherlock’s body flowing through his veins, building him up, strengthening him. He let his touch wander further south, dipping into the small of his back, pulling a soft moan from Sherlock’s mouth into his.
“Oh no,” Sherlock breathed out. No, no, this couldn’t be happening. After everything tonight, just after he’d finally decided, and now he’d just missed him and John was slipping away –
The two of them left for their honeymoon that same night, and Sherlock didn’t hear from John for two weeks. He
“I love you,” he whispered, and his voice was too heavy, almost broken, but a reply was already far beyond John’s reach, and he’d slipped into sleep before the weight of it could settle on him.
He moved away from John’s lips to trail kisses down his neck. John threw his head back, giving him access.
John pulled in another shuddering breath, eased himself back. He needed to be steady now; he owed Sherlock that much.
Sherlock swallowed heavily. “The suspect, he–”. His voice caught in his throat. He tried again. “The suspect pulled a switchblade, neither of us saw it. He stabbed John in the abdomen and ran off. I shot but I couldn’t follow him.”
He shut his eyes briefly to fight back the dangerous prickle welling up behind them. His attempts at keeping his breathing even were faltering with alarming speed, picking up towards full-body shudders.
“Oh, I was. Much, much worse.” John cast his gaze downward to watch Sherlock’s fingers trace the wound, testing each of the stitches to make sure they were still holding. “Every one of the nurses there hated me. I swear they would have poisoned me if I hadn’t been sent home soon enough.”
Sherlock sighed – a tiny breath of air that ruffled John’s hair fractionally. Still, John could feel the anxiety in it.
“And –” Sherlock hurried on, desperate for something else, for him to stay just a little longer. “You live with your – wife?”
John’s smile broadened a bit with amusement. “Right at the end of the high street – Harris street – near the Queen’s Head?”
But he was barely listening – he was watching Sherlock as he left the room, and his hands were still burning – just the gentlest brush of contact, and it had set all his nerve endings alight.
He felt Sherlock’s breath quicken against his skin, and he sped up his thrusts. Soft moans were escaping from his throat now, his arms shaking where they bracketed John’s body. His cock leaked fluid on to the small of John’s back. He was warm, and his touch was sweet, even in John’s hazy, post-orgasm bliss. He rutted against John harder, and deeper, chasing the precipice of his own pleasure. John shifted himself upward just a little, and clenched his arse cheeks.
Christmas was approaching quickly. A bit too quickly for John’s taste. He could remind himself to be grateful all he wanted, but it just wasn’t going to happen when that came with the realization that he’d have to go through it
The teacher’s voice rang out, and the auditorium rumbled with cheers. The curtain parted slowly, and Sherlock looked out at the black chasm beyond the blinding lights.
The crowd was roaring with exhilarated laughter now. Sherlock levelled his gaze over the field, knowing that what he was about to say would be quoted back to him for years.
“You have me.” Sherlock’s breath was warm against John’s cheek, sweet with feeling. “I’m here, you’ll always have me.”
to look away, ever. He held himself in Sherlock’s fathomless gaze, and gave a small shrug of one shoulder.
“I guess I will,” she said, looping it around him, and John burst out into laughter that seemed to stretch his face out wide. He must not have done that in a while.
“Girlfriend?” he said, quickly, as if that could change the answer. “Three illegitimate but charming children?”
“Of course,” John went on. “I don’t expecting you to be as foolish as me. And of course I prediction you say no…”
“It already is,” he whispered back, and leaned in for one more chaste kiss before leading him towards the door.
Sherlock scoffed. “It's worse. I must have been smaller, then.” He shifted downward slightly, so he could nestle his face into the crook of John’s neck. That helped, gave them a bit more room. “Though it’s easier when you’re alone.”
“I’ll get you something for your headache,” Sherlock said, and John tilted his head up to accept the kiss he offered, quick but tender, before watching him move off toward the bathroom – and John couldn’t be sure, but the thought maybe Sherlock was moving a bit quicker than he would normally have done. Trying a bit harder to put space between himself and John.
“Alright, alright,” Lestrade groaned, hunching his shoulders and pressing his hands hard into his face. “If I get you the warrant, will you spare me the explanation?”
“And Bernie?” John said, now turning to face him. He folded his hands on his desk. “You’ll write a new essay?”
Sherlock’s mouth opened under his without hesitation, and he pulled him in tighter by his shoulders. He angled his face, inviting John in deeper; and John clung onto him fast, sinking into him, swaying lightly with him on the spot as they slotted into each other, matching their rough edges and smoothing them out into something beautiful.
Sherlock kept the camera steady as he ran his other hand through his hair. His hunched shoulders were beginning to ache, but he didn’t have the energy to sit up straight. All his faculties right now were reserved for John.
Sherlock finished the song, letting the final note ring out long and clear. John inhaled deeply, took in the sharp tang of rosin blended with the airy softness of Sherlock’s shampoo, let it wash over him like a gentle, soothing breeze.
He didn’t look up at her as she thanked him and left. He just stared straight ahead at the dance floor and at John, caught between the desire to leave right now, and wishing that this would never end.
No. What a stupid idea. Only an idiot could have ever believed something like that would happen, that just because Sherlock had showed up to play in the band, the most wonderful boy in the world would somehow fall in love with him.
“But, despite that…” Sherlock gave John a little smile as his skin tingled under his tender caress. “We
Sherlock returned, bare-chested, and John stepped in behind him and took hold of his hips again. They held still, Sherlock leaning forward, and someone came by to mark their position.
Not five minutes away, they pulled into a large car park outside a wood-paneled building. There didn’t seem to be any other buildings around, except for a couple houses down the road surrounded by wide expanses of grass. The roof, like the sign at the airport, was piled high with snow.
we had to come,” Molly echoed. She looked almost amused at Sherlock’s statement. She got up off her knees and sat down on the coffee table in front of the chairs, folding her arms against her chest.
. He’d known it was going to be cold, but this was unlike anything he’d ever felt. The ground was completely covered in snow, including the road where the cabs were lined up. Just before him, on a little patch of grass which the cars were circling around, a sign displayed
The back of Sherlock’s legs hit the foot of the bed and he sat down on it, pulling John’s face down toward him, unwilling to stop kissing him even for a second. John leaned down to accommodate him and crawled into his lap, straddling his legs and wrapping his arms firmly around Sherlock’s shoulders.
And then John let out a quiet, desperate sigh, and he was leaning forward, and Sherlock angled himself down to meet him.
Without words, John indicated that Sherlock should cover Orlova. Sherlock nodded, edging as close as he could to him without being detected.
“Hey, hey, I know.” John held Sherlock’s gaze, something other than pain now worrying his brow. He laced his fingers between Sherlock’s and held on tight. “It’s alright, love.”
John pressed his face into his hand, sobbing out into the empty room, tears flowing freely down his cheeks and landing on the sleeves of Sherlock’s dressing gown.
“Mm,” Sherlock hummed noncommittally, setting the violin in its case on the table. “One of Elgar’s more understated works, perhaps, but quite obviously much the better for it.”
“The building’s surrounded. Officers on every floor, and lookouts in position across the street. Is it here?” John’s breathing rate and posture were both calm, but his voice was low with adrenaline.
“I can give you anything you ask for,” came Magnussen’s voice behind him. Sherlock turned around, his hand on the doorknob.
“Er – no,” John replied, with a little shake of his head. “There’s been a change of situation. It’s just me.”
John’s hand fumbled in his jacket pocket, and he extracted his phone. He fumbled at the screen with shaking fingers for a few seconds, then thrust it into Sherlock’s hand.
“Wait, Sherlock –” John stammered out, but not before Sherlock had instinctively hit the answer button.
“Yes,” Sherlock said back, only partially hearing what was coming out of his mouth. “Actually, do you mind if I just…absent myself for a second? I think…the wine…”
Slowly, as silently as he could, Sherlock pulled the window open. Still hearing nothing from within, he chanced to peek through the curtains.
Unbidden, an image of Mia swam before his vision. With her dark hair and hooded, sultry eyes. Wearing a diamond-encrusted gold necklace.
Still, they had covered a lot of ground today, and that meant a chance for progress somewhere down the line. Sherlock was sure of it. He was alright with taking small, cautious steps, as long as they were in the right direction.
Sherlock stared after him. He wondered for a moment if it had really happened, but the slip of paper was solid in his hands, and his cheek was still burning where John had kissed him.
“That was the Christmas effort from the once great Sherlock Holmes. Oh, dear me, how are the mighty fallen! I can safely put my hand up my arse and say that is the
“I mean it, John.” Sherlock’s voice was quiet, but an undercurrent of tender urgency sprang up in his words as he kissed at John’s lower jaw. “You were stabbed and left bleeding out in a shoddy alleyway, and you still won.” His thumb smoothed gently over John’s cheek, and he moved to plant a kiss there in its wake. “He nearly killed you, and you still fought your way back.”
. It was probably Harry, calling to make sure he’d still be back in time for her massive Christmas Eve party. He turned to his left – and promptly collided with Sherlock’s arm.
And he was in front of him, kneeling before his chair with his arms thrown around John’s shoulders. John buried his face in Sherlock’s neck and let it all out, those horrible, painful sounds of desperate relief, of his shattered life beginning to sew its tattered edges back together again.
“John, don’t –” Sherlock flinched, and his eyes squeezed shut. He couldn’t do this. He could barely face what was happening right this moment, but if John started
it was likely to be their last Christmas. At least the alternative meant he’d have been unaware, but the thought of that just made want to break down wherever he was standing when it hit him. There was no winning this one.
A jolt of arousal shot up John’s spine. He hooked his calves around Sherlock’s, to bring him in close. They had more room this way, actually, with Sherlock on top of him.
“Sirius can. If you know where to look, you can see it on virtually every night of the year, no matter the weather. Why do you think it was so important for marine navigation?”
This story is one of my personal favorites from the movie, and the one that may be most befitting of Sherlock and John: the one between Mark (Andrew Lincoln), Juliet (Keira Knightley) and Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor).
“Bugger off,” Lestrade grumbled. His hand was already on the door frame, waiting to shut it after them.
John’s stomach plummeted. His fingers clenched on the tray, and his laughter petering out uncomfortably.
John vaguely recognized her – she was one of the digital artists who worked on the floor above them; her name was Molly, John was fairly sure. And at that moment, in his mind, he was shouting at the top of his voice for her to go away.
“Deep and crisp and even.” Sherlock sang with him, thrown and casting around for the right words. “Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost was cruel…”
“Don’t worry,” John said, threading a hand back through those curls and leaning in to kiss him. He lingered there for a bit, enjoying the taste of Sherlock – black coffee shrouding a hint of morning breath – but didn’t push it any further, knowing Sherlock would have other plans for this morning and not wanting to make him feel guilty about it.
Sherlock gladly left the young officer, whose questions were getting a little too personal for his liking. He sidled up beside John, careful to keep a safe distance between them. “I can vouch for everything Dr. Watson has just said. He is of sound mind and very trustworthy, and you’ll find that his account of the events lines up with the timeline provided by each one of your officers.”
“I love you,” Sherlock whispered, soft and fiercely reverent. “I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you…”
John grimaced, clearly trying to smile but too frustrated and worn out to do it properly. Sherlock wasn’t about to ask, but he’d have bet John was regretting taunting Lestrade with end-of-case paperwork now that such a huge chunk of it had fallen into their laps, as they’d been the ones to bring about the arrest.
was it. Sherlock pulled them together and kissed him deeply, slowly but with a desperate need so tangible, so real it made John sink into him. Sherlock pushed his tongue past John’s lips, holding him close, so close by his grip across John’s back, and John would have gladly buried himself in him, burrowed into Sherlock’s chest and let himself be held, kept safe and warm forever, and he knew without a doubt that Sherlock would let him.
“No, I’m –” A pit of dread was swelling larger and larger in John’s stomach. He glanced guiltily at Sherlock, then looked away. “I’m not busy.”
“Please,” Sherlock gasped out raggedly. He swiped a thumb over John’s beautiful jaw, wiping away a spot of saliva from his activities. “Please, John, I need you, I need you so badly, please…”
He felt Sherlock swallow heavily as he laid kisses on John’s temple, on his fluttering eyelids. “You were so brave,” he whispered, thickly. “So brave, so strong…”
The new drugs were much better, and the pain slowly lessened as the days blurred into one another. John ate more regularly, and felt stronger and stronger – his vomiting episode was shaping up to be the lowest point of his recovery, and he felt closer to normal than ever. That didn’t stop Sherlock from fussing though, and John wondered how he even managed to find things to fix for John when there was less and less that John couldn’t do on his own. Still, whatever John needed, any time he needed something tended to, Sherlock was there to help him, apparently unaware that it had begun to worry John more than it reassured him.
“Just one second,” John repeated, a bit steadier this time. And to prove he meant it, he found Sherlock’s hand still clasped on his collar and pressed his keys into it.
“Ask me anything, I’ll tell you the truth.” Sherlock said, looking back at Mike. He could still get this back on track.
John stepped out of his jeans and followed Sherlock’s hands that guided him gently to lie down on the bed. Sherlock was kissing him again before John could even reach for him, climbing over and settling himself carefully on top on John, pressing their chests together and letting his weight settle down against him, surround him like he knew John needed. John’s hands wrapped around his back to pull him closer, closer still, and he opened his mouth under Sherlock’s to let him take whatever he needed, anything John had to give.
“– since our parents have been gone, well, it’s sort of been my job to look after her.” John said in a rush. “Well, not my
John quickly rearranged his face into a warm smile as he set the bags down on the floor and stepped towards him.
Sherlock shifted backwards a fraction, so John didn’t have to be pressed up so much against the wall. John found himself giggling a little, right into Sherlock’s face.
A soft, nearly imperceptible rustling from the kitchen, and John raised his gun up higher. Sherlock’s focus snapped back, his vision narrowing to the barrel of his gun and the door, all his attention focused on what was going on behind it.
John’s painted-on charming smile faltered a little, and he wandered off. The place was packed – one of the largest weddings he’d ever done. This couple must be rich beyond belief. Either that or they’d skimped to hell on the food, which, looking down at the moldering piles of pâté on the tray he was carrying, didn’t seem all that unlikely.
“Mycroft, don’t say that,” John heard Mrs. Holmes admonish him, but it was too late – the crowd was getting larger and larger, and buzzing.
They held each other that way, Sherlock wasn’t sure how long, sealing that promise with a hard, desperate kiss. John’s hands smoothed up and down Sherlock’s back, his eyelashes fluttering against Sherlock’s face, his lips nipping sweetly at Sherlock’s mouth, and his adoration was so powerful that Sherlock thought his heart might crack under the weight of it.
“I’m ready, Sherlock, please…” John moaned as Sherlock stroked over that spot again, setting his nerve endings alight. “Now, please…”
“Oh – Sherlock,” the man replied. He had a beautiful, baritone voice, smooth as velvet. He extended his hand to John. “Sherlock Holmes.”
“You won’t ever fail me as long as you’re here. We’ve never failed when we’re together.” He pushed his hand up to stroke though Sherlock’s curls, felt him lean into the touch. “And we never will, because we’re so much
“Um, sure,” he said, stepping aside. He was still trying to figure out why John had knocked, when clearly he had let himself in through the front door.
“Yeah, yeah, Sherlock…” John’s voice rasped out, heavy against Sherlock’s neck, his hips rocking steadily, tension building along his spine under Sherlock’s touch. “Come for me, my love, my Sherlock, come for me now.”
with himself not to lose it in front of his brother, but it was then that Mycroft did something that very nearly stunned Sherlock into composure; he reached out and laid a hand on his wrist.
“Well, give them a quid and tell them to bugger off!” Mary shouted back. Sherlock heard some indiscriminate voices filtering though the walls. She’d turned on the telly. Perfect.
He fumbled a bit with the champagne glass he was still clutching at awkwardly, but in a second Sarah’s husband had snatched it away and was indicating that he should go
John offered one of his own, and pulled Sherlock close enough so that their noses brushed. “I don’t ever want you to hide from me.”
“Hey, don’t spoil it.” John heard the note of plaintiveness in his voice even as he tried to keep things light.
“Well, I suppose you’ve figured out the tricks of the trade.” Sherlock tried to shake it off. “I’m very jealous of your plane, by the way.”
Sherlock stood, rooted to the spot, the words barely making sense in his whirling mind. No, he couldn’t have – not
“Hmm. Well you’re right about that.” John smiled back, full of admiration and amazement. Sherlock had never seen anyone so beautiful.
His head snapped up. John was looking at him quizzically, clearly having noted the sudden change in his mood.
Sherlock managed to nod, to blink open his eyes to see John looking down at him with pursed lips, concern worrying the crease of his forehead. Sherlock brushed a thumb over his eyebrow, wanting to smooth it away. “Yes,” he choked out. His heart was hammering; Sherlock was sure John could feel it against his chest. “Please, John, I need you, I need you
“Come sit with me,” Sherlock said gently, pulling John by the hands and into the sitting room. John followed, obediently. He always did.
He thought about that night, that perfect night, weeks ago. That night so much like this one and yet so far away, with Perlman playing and John’s arms holding him close. It had been so wonderful. It still was. It seemed stupid to think so now, but Sherlock still knew – whatever else had happened since then – on that night at least, John had loved him. There was no burying that.
Sherlock moved toward the doctor as if in a trance. Unsure of what to do with his hands, he crossed them tightly in front of his chest as he stopped in front of her.
“But understand that you’ve done all you can do,” the doctor went on firmly, not relinquishing his grip. “The doctors will take care of him now, and I assure you that we will be doing everything we can…”
“Not quite,” Sherlock murmured sweetly over John’s lips, dipping in for a quick kiss, two, three, as he kept working John open. “Slowly, remember?”
“I’m Sherlock.” The man reached back and shook John’s hand once. A jolt of electricity raced up from John’s fingers all the way up his arm at the contact. “Sherlock Holmes – I’m Sam’s music teacher.”
John pulled his coat tighter around him, and made a beeline for the nearest cab. His breath was coming out in thick, opaque clouds. He fumbled with the handle with his rapidly numbing fingers, and slid himself into the warmth of the backseat with a grateful sigh.
Slowly, he reached into his jacket again – the inside pocket this time, where he had pulled the CD from earlier that night – and pulled out small, white envelope, which he handed to Sherlock.
Sherlock drew his finger halfway out, and John nearly cried out at the loss before a second one was teasing at his entrance alongside the first, and as it breached him even more slowly John let out a high-pitched moan and let his eyes slide shut, seeing stars flickering behind his lids.
But when he finally looked back up at John, he was smiling again, and his eyes were sparkling with mischief.
Sherlock groaned and twitched his hips forward in response, smearing some of the fluid onto John’s belly. John didn’t stop, rubbing teasing circles around Sherlock’s cockhead until he had enough to slide his hand easily up them both. The sensation was amazing – it always was – the heat of him, the gorgeous intimacy of this kind of touch, the desperate way Sherlock was pushing into his hand, wanting more of him. And then there was the look in his eyes, hovering above him and clear as anything even in the dark, hooded with arousal, flooded with longing, with awe, and with love.
He took her by the arm and walked with her towards the dance floor. Molly looked absolutely delighted, and John scowled after her. He did notice, though, that Sherlock kept a respectful distance between them even as she tried to edge closer and closer, and it lifted his spirits somewhat.
The pair on the screen began to kiss, and suddenly Dad’s hands had seized Sherlock by the sides and were tickling him.
He stumbles on his way to the edge of it, tearing the knees of his trousers and letting the rocks bite into his palms as he clutches the edge, and he can barely see past the blinding mirror of moonlight but the water is spilling calmly over the sides and there’s a shock of ghostly pale among the blackness that no waves could ever obscure.
The sensation sent a bolt of feeling right to Sherlock’s cock, and he groaned loudly into John’s mouth. John’s smile widened, and he dove in again, pushing his tongue back between Sherlock’s lips, alternating between deep, warm kisses and light playful nips. Sherlock fell back against the mattress, his arms pulling John down with him, and shuffled himself up to the head of the bed, letting John’s lips chase his as he went.
After a moment, far too soon for it to be a coincidence, Mrs. Hudson appeared and began bustling about in the kitchen. Her usual cheeriness filled the room and almost managed to make John let go of the apprehension clouding over his mind, though as she rummaged around (clearing away God knows what, Sherlock kept everything immaculate these days), he wondered if maybe she could help him for a different reason than what she’d been sent up for.
Sherlock looked around at them all, feeling as though he was seeing them clearly for the first time that night – it was as if he’d been underwater, everything blurred and distorted, and finally he’d been allowed to come up for air.
“I started this thing years ago, you know?” John said, vaguely in Sherlock’s direction as he pulled the newest sheet from the typewriter and set it on the stack. “But then I didn’t really have time for it when I was in the army, and I was a mess when I got back.” He stabbed at the keyboard again, writing mostly by muscle memory. “And I just kept putting it off.”
“Yes, I think so,” she replied, and her voice was low and dark in a way that suddenly seemed unbearably irritating. “Just a basic kind of thing? Wives and family and stuff?”
“Oh, God, it’s half the book,” John groaned, watching them being carried forward on the wind. Most of them had already landed in the water.
But then his mouth contorted somewhat, and he did speak, but it was so quiet that John couldn’t hear him at all.
They were starting early that day. John picked his way through the crew, bleary eyed, as huge lights were wheeled in behind the windows to simulate late afternoon sun. Someone was up on a ladder, wiping down the glass, and the associate director was striding through the crowd with a large clipboard, shouting “bit of quiet while we finish the lighting, guys!”
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry John,” Sherlock rasped out, breathless. “I know it hurts, but you’re going to be alright – help is coming, they’re on their way, stay with me...”
John might have noticed his unusual behavior, but Sherlock knew he was mostly just grateful that the evening wasn’t horrendously uncomfortable and didn’t feature Harry and Di sniping at each other. He would thank Sherlock later for trying so hard to make it bearable for them.
Sherlock blinked, his gaze shifting out of focus. The room, his desk, Mycroft, all blurred into indistinct shapes, none of them seeming real.
“John,” Sherlock breathed. The heat of his mouth drew John in again and again, making him tremble in Sherlock’s grip. “My wonderful, brave, brilliant John.”
John was there, lying on the bed in a flimsy hospital gown. His eyes were closed, and he was as pale as death. Somehow he looked smaller than Sherlock had ever seen him, and so, so fragile, but his chest was rising and falling with tiny, fractional movements – he was
,” Sherlock corrected him with some bitterness. “And also the same Curtis who we just chased half a mile down the South Bank.”
Elton’s so I could come here and tell you –” And now Sherlock’s eyes had snapped shut, and he drew a deep breath in through his nose, trying to stem the tide that he knew was about to break loose from him.
It didn’t take long for that to wear off. The pain didn’t recede as it normally did that evening, and John’s stomach twisted around itself as the drugs struggled and failed to fight it. He had to shrug away Sherlock’s attempts to get him to eat, and fell into a fitful sleep when he went to bed early, feeling more frustrated than ever that even such little activity could worsen his condition so much.
“Oh, Sherlock, please…” And now John’s eyelids were fluttering, the desire to throw his head back and get lost in the sensations warring with his need to see Sherlock, to look into his eyes as he stroked long and deep within him, to let that heart-stopping adoration shining out of him like the sun envelop him, hold him tight. He tightened his grip on Sherlock’s shoulders, trying to hang on as long as he could before he floated away on a sea of desire.
“Ugh, tastes like it, too.” John choked out, swallowing it down with difficulty. It was like forcing down bile.
There was a heavy snowfall coming down outside, piling up against the windows where fairy lights twinkled in slowly flashing reds and greens and blues. But the inside of the flat was filled with an enveloping warmth; a soft red glow emanated from the crackling fire in the grate, and a few candles were littered here and there along the tables, giving off a sweet gingerbread scent.  Soft violin music was playing from the stereo, and the hearth and bookshelves were strung up with tinsel and some smaller lights, bright and festive.
Sherlock nodded, leaned up to kiss his forehead too, then stood and hurried down the steps, pulling his coat on with a flourish.
He craned his neck, to try to see Sherlock’s expression. He was a bit too far away to make out if any understanding had made it through.
John’s heart swelled up – the burst of affection was so powerful and so sudden it knocked him off balance. He managed to nod his head a little, and still his hips, and just try to feel every little touch of Sherlock’s perfect fingers.
John looked up to meet Sherlock’s eyes, questioning, and Sherlock nodded once, his breath shuddering in anticipation. John leaned forward, hovering over him with shaking arms, and pushed inward with one slow but continuous movement. They cried out in unison, Sherlock’s hands clawing at John’s neck, and John pushed forward until he was seated up to the hilt, wrapping an arm underneath Sherlock’s shoulders and swallowing his cries with a deep, passionate kiss.
“Bonjour, Monsieur Watson,” she replied, brightly. “Welcome back. And this year, you’ve brought a lady along with you?”
Sherlock paced back and forth in front of the dark window, the lights of the city below twinkling up through the settling mist.
everything John needed at any given time never stopped being a mystery to him, and it was one he never tired of trying to solve.
“God, she’s gonna be insufferable.” John shut his eyes briefly. Harry’s busy work schedule had kept her from visiting John more than once while he’d been in hospital, and she’d been so frantic as she fussed over him, snapping at Sherlock and all the doctors, that John had had to pretend to fall asleep to get her to leave.
“Just try to spread some reassuring feeling around, alright?” Sherlock said, moving toward the door of his office. “You can do that, can’t you?”
“Oh?” John raised his eyebrows. He hadn’t expected Sherlock to pull out all the stops, but God, it just made the burst of affection in his chest swell up even more.
“Tread lightly, sailor,” Sherlock carried on with a cheeky grin covering his face. “You wouldn’t want me to put you on the night watch, would you?”
It was a few days before the landlady came by. John was surprised – last year she’d come right away to introduce herself, quite enthusiastically too. She was an Englishwoman, but she’d lived in France so long she had a unique pseudo-accent that lilted her voice with unusual tone patterns, and nothing seemed to give her greater pleasure than to have someone staying in her villa, at last.
“You know, Sherlock…” Dad was speaking slowly, stretching his legs out lengthwise on the sofa. “I’m sure he’s unique and extraordinary…”
“I can’t be without you.” Sherlock’s voice hitched again, a dangerous lump rising in his throat. “Not anymore. I don’t know how.”
A low sigh escaped Sherlock’s lips as he leaned in to kiss John again. Desperate, tender and slow, he pressed in with the softest of movements, angling his face gently as John invited him in. Quiet breaths mingled with the smooth glide of his lips, his lashes brushing along John’s cheek, his tongue warm and wet as it explored, feeling him, tasting him.
Those three words. That’s it. Three words, not even spoken to him but to his reflection, though there was no doubt in John’s mind who they were for. Three words he’d spent days and nights imagining in that voice, and still been unprepared. Still couldn’t have imagined how he would breathe them out like the most blessed of prayers and the most sacred of confessions.
The fire was still burning bright and warm from when John had last stoked it. Outside, the sun was setting, tinging the sky a dull orange colour.
A powerful jolt shot up John’s spine as Sherlock scissored his fingers slightly. John cried out softly into the mattress. God, he loved those fingers, those long, deft, gorgeous fingers. They could draw pleasure out of him as if it were a science, touch him in ways that he never knew were possible. They felt so incredible inside him, John felt he was going to lose his mind if Sherlock kept teasing him like this.
“…reckon he’ll be traded by the end of the season, don’t you?” John was asking. But Mr. Sawyer was suddenly giving a strange jerk of his head. John blinked, then realized he was trying – and failing – to subtly indicate something behind John.
He waited, but Sherlock didn’t turn around for another retort. He just stared out the passing cars, not looking at him. John’s smile faltered a bit.
“Yeah, probably.” John said, encouraged. “Most of them. Well, at least some. From what I saw, anyway.”
“I – I have to say, Sherlock,” John stammered, as Sherlock’s eyes seemed to pierce him. “This is a real pleasure. It’s – I mean, it’s really nice to find someone I can actually chat to.”
“Oh yeah?” John beamed back, his breath catching a bit in his throat; snowflakes had settled in Sherlock’s hair, tiny pinpricks of light dotting those ebony curls. “And where would it have taken me?”
"There, that will help." Sherlock was holding him by the nape of his neck with gentle fingers. "What else do you need?"
He might have been the most beautiful man John had ever seen. Bright eyes, ebony hair curled in tight, flowing waves, sharp cheekbones and a strong jawline that gave him the impressive yet delicate look of some Byronic hero. He was tall, and wearing a long coat which only accentuated this, but it was unbuttoned and beneath it John could see a broad, strong chest and a slim waist clad in a sleek button-down shirt. John’s eyes raked his frame up and down, from his shoes to his gorgeous lips to the little mole on his neck, and his every faculty seemed to shut off in an instant, overtaken by Sherlock’s handsome figure. It was a good few seconds before he even realized he hadn’t yet spoken.
John grinned, his heart singing in his chest, and they fell back into the kiss. John let his hands trail down Sherlock’s back, and shifted his hips so that their cocks would rub up against each other. He groaned, a low sound from deep in his chest – he could feel Sherlock getting hard against him, and it was stoking the quickly-growing fire in his belly.
Sherlock read the words slowly. When he finished, he read them again, certain he must not have seen it right the first time.
John beamed at him, reaching down to take Sherlock’s hand and thread their fingers together; the other hand coming to rest in his pocket where the watch sat, heavy and shapely and perfect.
With a final glint of joy, Sherlock pushed the door open and stepped through it, flashing a final shy look at John as it closed behind him.
Sherlock understood, and tugged at John’s hips, gently. John’s legs shook when he tried to raise himself up, but Sherlock quickly shoved a pillow underneath them for support. He pumped his fingers in and out, faster now, faster than the torturously slow tempo that had been building John up toward the edge for what seemed like
It was warm outside, for Christmas Eve, and the light snow that had begun to fall before the show had mellowed into a mist. Beads of it flecked onto the widows, fogged up with the heat of the school building and muting all the bodies going past outside.
Time seemed to have stopped. John’s blood was roaring in his ears in the silence. Beside him, he swore he could hear Sherlock blinking.
Sensing this, John stopped teasing, and gave his cock a final soft kiss through his pants. He dipped his fingers into the waistband and yanked them down, tossed them aside. Sherlock’s cock sprang free, already flushed and leaking, and finally
“Obviously, um, if you don’t want to, you don’t have to,” he went on. He looked sheepishly away from those eyes, still wide and staring up at him. “I was just, um – I’m rambling now, sorry…”
John pulled off for a moment and looked up at him with concern in his eyes. “Are these walls soundproof?”
“So, Sherlock,” barked the show’s host, Mike, a few minutes later, when Sherlock had settled himself in the chair behind the microphone. “Welcome back to the airwaves! You’ve got a new Christmas single, a cover of ‘Love is all Around
He became shorter with the students, less and less interested in their end-of-term excitement. Even the teachers seemed to know to stay out of his way. But rather than give him any kind of peace, it just made a lonely sort of silence settle on him, wherever he went in the school. He wondered, vaguely, whether he’d have anyone to talk to at all once the break was over.
“You are so incredible,” he whispered, planting a final kiss on John’s bottom lip, then angled his face to press a soft kiss at the cleft of his chin. His touches drifted downward, feather-light brushes of his fingers wandering down towards John’s inner thigh.
John came into the office late that day, coffee clenched between his chilled hands. He adjusted his grip on it, trying to warm them up, but trying to do that while also hurrying to his desk before Sarah saw him scrambling in was a hopeless endeavour, and he ended up burning one of his palms on the bottom of it as he set it down on his desk along with his coat and his bag.
With more reluctance than he could bear, John slowly pulled back from Sherlock. But Sherlock didn’t let go – he kept his hands on John’s shoulders, kept the distance between them short. John could count the freckles on his long, beautiful neck.
John held on too long. When Sherlock finally released his grip, John’s hand felt like it was about to freeze completely.
Sherlock took it, grateful to him for breaking the tension in the room, and slipped it into his inside pocket.
Sherlock’s heart soared at the familiarity of this. The two of them, at the height of a dangerous case, and laughing at something so mundane. It was like coming home.
John nodded, and Sherlock hurried towards the bedroom. His fingers were still shaking as he stabbed the eject button and took hold of the CD, but he was breathing easily again by the time he’d returned to the sitting room and fed it into the stereo on the shelf.
And then it was over, and Sherlock pulled back. He gazed at him just long enough for his expression to shift again into undisguised longing, and before John could even open his mouth to speak, he turned away.
And suddenly John was crying out, and Sherlock’s hips stuttered, and they tumbled over the edge together – John’s hips arched up into Sherlock’s touch, clinging to him as he came in one long, unbroken moan of pleasure while Sherlock gasped out a breathy cry as he came apart with his own shuddering movements. John felt him spilling warm and deep within his body as his own cock pumped out over his chest and Sherlock’s hand, and he gasped and moaned as they rode out each other’s orgasms, clutching each other tightly and breathing each other in, pleasure coursing between their bodies, perfectly in tandem.
“There we go – oof.” John tangled his weary limbs around him. Sherlock’s skin was warm from the shower, his hair still damp.
“And…” Sherlock finally drummed up the courage to look John directly in the eyes. “I realized that…it might be that, the people I love, is, in fact –”
“You know, Itzhak Perlman was among the first to teach your cold, English husband how to feel.” Sherlock turned his head a bit as he said it, so he could see John out of the corner of his eye.
And then a sparkle of red caught his eye, flashing light at him, and Sherlock’s eyes snapped to the woman clad in a sheer red backless dress, and – Sherlock had to blink before he was sure he’d really seen it – an Alice band with two sequined red horns stuck to it. He supposed it was supposed to be charming, or sexy, but Sherlock felt that same roar of irrational anger in him at the sight of it. Who would wear a stupid thing like that to a Christmas party? For police officers? He stared daggers into Mia’s back as she picked her way through the throng of dancers and towards the cluster of people at the edge of it, felt his mind clouding at the edges as she zeroed in on her target. She tapped on John’s shoulder.
Sherlock’s grin spread wide over his face, and John answered with one of his own, each of them feeling lighter, more whole, slightly less burdened of the weight they’d been carrying in their chests throughout their long separation.
He turned it on and held it up at chest height, so that it could record without obstructing his view. The recording was for later: his own, uninterrupted gaze was for right now. He focused both on John, standing at the centre of the altar with that look of subdued love in his eyes.
There. That would do. Now he wouldn’t have to remember it. Lestrade gave him a little nod, and Sherlock moved on.
Sherlock let out another quiet breath of laughter, less shaky this time; the lines of his brow weren’t as deep anymore, and John pulled him in a tiny bit more, craving that closeness, hoping to smooth the rest of them away.
He pulled him close again after he’d shut the door gently, threading his arms around John’s waist and holding him there, lips seeking out John’s with kisses so gentle, so full of tenderness that they made John want to cry out with feeling. Instead he kissed him back, pouring every fiber of his soul back into Sherlock, his heart swelling with emotion when he felt Sherlock giving himself in equal measure.
Sherlock sighed, pushing the images away. No good to think about that now. He was gone. He’d be Sherlock’s shining moment in an overcast career, the one true thing he could remember when the bills stopped passing and the polls turned against him – because they would. They always did.
Sherlock could hear the tears rising up in John’s voice, but he couldn’t open his eyes to see them. He could only pull him in for a deep, breathless kiss – a kiss so powerful it
They lugged their bags up the stairs toward 221B, weariness from the day exuding out of both of them. Sherlock sighed gratefully as he dropped his suitcase just inside the sitting room door and peeled off his coat, hoping to expel the last twenty-four hours out of his system entirely.
Sherlock was glad John didn’t elaborate. He really didn’t want to know anything about the honeymoon at all.
John stared at the empty doorway for a while after he left. Conflicting emotions were crowding into his heart – relief, affection, concern, anxiety – all vying for attention and making him reel with confusion. He wished he didn’t feel so
“I’d rather not,” he said, laying his hand over John’s and stopping his frantic movements. He gently took away the sponge, and turned him by the shoulders to face him.
But Sherlock knew, and with gentle worshipful hands he worked John open, all the while continuing to dip in for gentle nips to John’s lips, drawing him out, guiding him through it.
“When the snow lay round about,” the driver had joined in behind him, making Sherlock jump. He had a perfect operatic basso.
Still, the entire ride was an exercise in restraint. John spent most of the time staring out the window, but would occasionally turn and catch Sherlock’s eye, lingering for a dangerously long moment before shifting his gaze away again.
The shot dragged on, and on; it was the longest one Sherlock had gotten. The John on screen rotated slowly, the camera catching every inch of him it could. Everything Sherlock couldn’t bear to lose.
John’s face broke into beautiful, earnest laugh, and all the tension vanished from the office in an instant. Sherlock exhaled a deep breath, feeling like a large weight had just lifted off him.
“Thank you,” John said. Then inspiration struck, and he seized the plate carrying his last croissant.
“Oh, God…” Sherlock breathed against his lips – he was just as overcome as John was. “God, you feel…”
“I know.” Sherlock replied by tilting John’s head back for a soft kiss, then pulled off and kissed the corner of his mouth with a gentle smile.
John was gone – taken away by strangers who may not even be able to save him – and Sherlock had barely seen his face, hadn’t even registered what he’d last said to him before he’d been rushed off.
He continued stroking, stoking the white-hot flame in John’s abdomen and making it crackle up to his chest, lighting him up from the inside. He worked John open torturously slowly, spreading his fingers apart gradually with every stroke until he could scissor them properly, and each delicate movement made John gasp and tremble until he was a desperate writhing mess beneath him.
“A friend who bullies us, is no longer a friend. And since bullies only respond to strength, from now onward, I will be prepared to be much stronger.”
The scene changed again. In the reception hall now, John in the middle of a group of well wishers. Sherlock watched, with dread swelling larger ever second that ticked by, as the camera slowly zoomed in on John’s eyes again.
He kept staring, even as the sight of them made the ache in his chest steadily more painful. It was dangerously easy to imagine, once they had turned so that John was obscuring her from view, that it could be an entirely different scene he was watching, in another life, maybe. He was already half imagining that he would see that scene when he watched the footage later – that what he was seeing with his own eyes was just a projection of his tortured heart, and that he would see the truth once he got it on video. Somehow, everything would be right then.
Steadying himself, and keeping his grip on John’s arse, Sherlock lifted his legs to wrap around John’s thighs and rolled his own hips down onto John’s cock, the angle deepening and suddenly John was hitting Sherlock’s prostate with every deliberate thrust, sending white hot sparks up Sherlock’s every nerve, down to the tips of his fingers, to the top of his scalp, tearing John’s name from his lips in a sound that was half shout, half sob.
He stood up again, stumbling as if he’d been drinking. He shrugged his coat off his shoulders – probably stained too, though he couldn’t make himself turn around to check. In a bizarre moment of practicality, he wondered vaguely just what kind of look the dry cleaner would give him when he brought him his prized vintage Belstaff covered in blood. He let out a bemused huff of air – the barest skeleton of a laugh – but the thought slid out of his head before he could gain any kind of reprieve from it. He left the coat over the back of the chair and wandered off toward the bathroom as if in a dream.
His eyes glinted, brilliant. “Traditionally, no,” he said, leaning in slightly. “But in this case I think perhaps I might like to keep you up all night.”
The relief that crashed over him was painful in its intensity. It struck him in the centre of his chest and spread out like pins and needles over every nerve. It flooded over the wasted mechanisms of his mind and washed out hours of built-up anxiety and terror and left him light-headed, whirling.
He let the kiss go on for many long, perfect moments, before John broke it with a quiet sigh, struggling yet again to hold his eyes open.
, hands smoothing tenderly up Sherlock’s hips, and looked up to meet his eyes, his gaze questioning and calming, silently saying
Something like a sob was pulled out of the back of Sherlock’s throat, and he pulled John close, kissing him hard and desperate, needing him so badly it was almost painful, needing every inch of John, needing every beat of his pounding heart.
Sherlock was mouthing the words as he reached outward and pointed his finger straight ahead, his other hand on his hip and rotating slowly, like a perfect disco legend.
Sherlock chuckled – a strained, watery sound through his tears – and he wiped at his face once more before settling his hands onto his hips and clearing his throat.
He made a beeline for his office and found Mycroft in there, collecting some files from his desk. Perfect.
He dropped Sherlock at his house on the narrow, cobblestoned street, and watched him until he’d slipped inside. As soon as he was gone, the sun seemed to set all at once – the area became darker and colder, the long lonely night reaching out to swallow him.
His commitment never wavered, only the barest cracks of insecurity breaking through his mask of confidence where John almost couldn’t see them. But every time John caught a shadow of doubt in his face, or a miniscule hesitation in a usually steady hand, it made something clench around his heart, leaving him grasping for something comforting to say or do and always coming up empty.
With small, slow movements, so as not to wake him, John dislodged himself from under Sherlock’s arm and shuffled up out of the bed. He fumbled for a moment in the dark, found Sherlock’s dressing gown, and tied it around himself before opening the door as quietly as possible and slipping through it.
“Alright, genius,” he smirked, and loved the almost-undetectable flush that crept up onto Sherlock’s cheeks at the word. “And where are you on my grand adventure?”
He turned himself enough to look back at Sherlock, whose eyes were bright with sympathetic understanding.
But John didn’t look upset at all; in fact, his brows knitted together with what looked like sympathy. For
“Um.” He glanced up at the calendar hanging on the back wall, and did some quick mental maths. “Two years, seven months, three days and…I suppose, what, two hours?”
Sherlock reached down, one hand cupping John’s arse greedily, the other deftly undoing his belt, pulling open the button and zip on his trousers. John pulled back from the kiss suddenly; worry was seeping into the creases around his eyes. “Wait, hang on, do you have-?”
He scanned the crowd, and finally spotted a woman standing by herself in the corner. She was pretty, but looked bored, and unimpressed with the whole affair. Maybe John could go cheer her up.
Encouraged, John hollowed his cheeks and began to suck, taking as much of Sherlock as he could. Sherlock strained against John’s grip, but John held him firmly down, bobbing his head slowly up and down, setting a maddeningly slow pace that had Sherlock keening and moaning and gripping John’s head tightly, urging him to give him still more. John sped up slightly, but held back just enough, just enough to keep Sherlock from going over the edge.
“The tumor has shrunk since the previous x-ray – quite a bit, actually.” And now Dr. Moore had pulled out a dark translucent sheet and was looking over it, like he might look over an interesting curio at an auction. “And it looks like the ongoing treatment is going to make it
Sherlock smiled wide, and almost at that exact moment John heard the click of the kettle switching itself off from the kitchen.
They sat in silence, each on opposite ends of the backseat. Sherlock was afraid to look up now, afraid of what he might see. It might be too much, and make him go into a full-blown panic.
Sherlock swallowed back the tightness in his throat and blinked his eyes open, not caring that they were still wet. He dropped his hand from his face and turned to look at Mycroft, eyes searching.
“Hey, I usually was too.” John ran his hands slowly up and down Sherlock’s back. He was still tense.
But the bubble of hope only had a couple of seconds to swell before John’s mobile vibrated loudly against his desktop.
Sherlock’s eyes bored into his – the depths of emotion that had suddenly flooded back into them nearly knocked John off his feet.
“Right, yeah, must have been this place,” John carried on, his lips twitching up at the corners. “You know, rabid dogs, murderous scientists…”
He wasn’t sure how long they stayed like that, but it was long enough for Sherlock to be breathing a bit heavier than normal when they broke apart. John seemed to be as well, breath coming deep and even as he smiled rapturously up at Sherlock.
was any word he had learned – and then another, younger man stepped out from the doorway at the end of the hall.
John couldn’t stop himself from trying to buck up into Sherlock’s hands – Sherlock let him, a little, though his weight on him still kept him fairly well pinned. A low, continuous moan was emitting from John’s chest now, as every delicate brush against that sweet spot inside him sent him spiralling into another wave of pleasure.
John giggled above him, that bright, musical sound that rang out through the small room and filled every corner of Sherlock’s heart. No other sound in the world could feel so complete, so perfect; Sherlock was sure of it.
Sherlock stood at the far window, violin tucked under his chin, working his way through some sonata that John vaguely recognized. The sound was full and peaceful, clear yet soothing, and John let it wrap around him as it filled the room; it was calming background to his novel, which on its own was mediocre at best, and when it inevitably failed to hold his interest he let his eyes settle on Sherlock, watching his fingers gliding across the wood, his entire body swaying slightly with the movement of his arms as he pulled the song from the instrument.
“Sorry about her,” John said, relieved, as Sherlock closed the door after her. “I swear it was almost easier when she drank.”
He turned back to the dance floor, trying to ignore the way Janine’s eyes were still trained on his face, probably seeing what he’d been doing a very bad job of hiding all evening.
His shoulder sagged a little, and he shivered. He was working outside today, on the little table out by the pond. But although the sun was out, there was a chilly breeze, and John’s jumper wasn’t warding it off. Still, it was a good place to write – he’d done quite a lot today. Or maybe his troubling thoughts were just good creative fuel.
Sherlock still looked puzzled, but nodded, gently. John gave him a shy smile, then took a step back and moved around the corner.
The door of number fifty-six swung open to reveal, seemingly, no one, until Sherlock looked down and saw three young children, probably no older than eight.
“I mean, I don’t want to ruin…” The uncertainty had returned to John’s eyes as he looked back at Sherlock.
He turned back around to face the sitting room, stepping towards the table. He nodded once, resigned, running his fingers along the wooden edges and staring out into the street.
“I’ve just tried the wedding video, and it’s a complete disaster,” John went on. “It’s come out all blue and wobbly.”
ago. And still, Sherlock felt more than a little disorientated as he rang the doorbell at Baker Street not two hours later.
She was silent on the other end, only the faint sound of her breathing coming through. John braced himself for the explosion.
It was the longest one yet. Sherlock cradled John’s skull with his other hand and poured everything he was feeling into it, knowing that John could understand him perfectly.
“Well, I was there for a minute or two,” he said, and he was surprised at how quiet and unsure his own voice sounded. “But then…I had an epiphany.”
He leaned up to kiss John's forehead, sweet and smiling, before walking off to the kitchen. John watched him go, fondness radiating out of the lines of his brow.
“This could backfire on you really badly, you know that,” he’d said as they’d sat in the dark in John’s Baker Street flat, watching Sherlock’s Graham Norton spot.
“We may be a small country,” he said out to the crowd. “But we’re a great one, too. The country of Shakespeare, Churchill, the Beatles, Sean Connery, Harry Potter!”
She turned to him, just enough to see that she was on the phone. She shook her head, looking annoyed.
And Sherlock opened his eyes to find John’s, a deep, sparkling blue, wide and beautiful as a summer sea, and in an instant, everything became clear and calm.
Sherlock blinked down at him once, twice, and the moment stretched on until John felt like he could have gotten lost in it, could have frozen to the spot where he stood –
Sherlock’s heart seemed to lurch to one side. He felt off-balance, disoriented, not quite sure what to feel or what to think.
“Couple more,” said Harry’s voice behind him. She stepped into the kitchen and laid a stack of dirty plates next to the sink. “Listen, Sherlock, you really don’t have to, I can –”
She tilted her head and swaggered towards them, then leaned sideways on the bar, barely a foot from John.
The ringing noise grew louder, and suddenly Sherlock realized it was coming not from inside his ears, but from his mobile phone buzzing in his trouser pocket.
Sherlock lowered his arms to wrap around John’s body and pull him impossibly closer, needing more, still more. He curled his tongue against John’s, inviting him deeper, and let his own rumbling moan of pleasure escape from his throat.
December raced by, John couldn’t believe how quickly. He’d expected to be counting down the days until he left with desperate impatience, but time sped along so rapidly that he almost couldn’t believe it when he saw that his flight left in less than 24 hours. The excitement simmered over inside him, and all too soon he was throwing clothes into a bag and stepping outside into the pouring rain, rushing for the tube.
There were a few people in the lounge tonight – families in groups of armchairs, benches, exchanging gifts and tentative laughter. The space had been strung up with lights, and it looked at little less lifeless than it had done the last time.
The reason, though, that John could no longer hear anything, was that Sherlock was up on the second-floor landing, laying down plates in front of two patrons.
He was looking up at Sherlock, his light blue eyes deep and swimming with emotion, but Sherlock finally had to tear himself away. He couldn’t do this here. Not in front of all these people.
“Okay,” he breathed back, then whipped around and ran through the door. The attendant didn’t notice a thing.
He budged up a bit on the cushion to let John sit close. John sank down beside him with a phenomenal lack of grace, but he didn’t care much. He was tired, and Sherlock was warm.
John's smile stretched wider; he tried his best not to twist it into a grimace. "I've been better." The pain in his side was now radiating up through his chest.
John, however, moved to the table and set his own tray down on it. “So, I thought maybe we might check that video thing out?”
The street outside was almost silent – no cars driving by, no straggling pubgoers on their way home, no rustling from the trees in the park. It was as if someone had switched off the city.
“Obviously.” Sherlock couldn’t quite keep the smirk out of his voice as he said it, loving the barely-detectable edge of exasperation that settled in the corners of John’s mouth. God, he’d missed him. “All the previous victims were younger members, none of them older than thirty-five. Probably held junior positions within the family, unlikely to arouse the wrath of such a major opponent. They’re dispensable, more easily killed, and clearly taken notice of when they go missing.”
Sherlock moved just enough to let John scoot out and perch himself at the edge of the bed again. Otherwise, he stayed completely immobile. John knew he was staring at him, stunned into stillness.
“Alright, let’s carry on,” said Mike. “How do you think the new record compares to your classic stuff?”
Sherlock was laying against John’s chest, their legs stretched out on the sofa and facing the window to watch the snow come down. Sherlock had a blanket tugged up to his waist and a cup of tea cooling in his hands. John had a well-worn book propped open between the cushion and Sherlock’s shoulder, and he was occasionally reading out his favorite lines from it. Sherlock was sort of listening, but mostly just enjoying the feeling of John’s voice rumbling through his chest and into Sherlock’s ears. It was so soothing Sherlock could have fallen asleep if he hadn’t been feeling so peacefully happy.
Sherlock rounded the corner. He was at the end of the security line. Straight in front of him, the gate stood tall, a guard framed in it as he passed his wand over a traveller he was checking.
From beside him, a great wheezing cough wracked Sherlock’s sleeping frame. Then another, and another, until his body was trembling and shaking with the awful hacking sounds whose only mercy was to let him sleep on through them.
“This isn’t how I imagined you playing nurse.” John’s voice was a bit too rough to achieve the lightheartedness he was going for.
“I know.” That same uneasiness flashed across Sherlock’s face again, worrying his lips into a thin line for the briefest of moments before evening out. “But we’ll get you fed, and showered, and I’ll make the tea strong – that should help a bit. And Mrs. Hudson’s been nagging me about wanting to cook for us, so she’ll keep us busy for a while today, I’m sure.”
He sighed; Sherlock’s eyes boring into his back were all that was keeping him from dropping his head in shame.
He screams again into the dark. He climbs over the rocks, and the moon answers only with a sickening white light.
He pushed his way through a glass-panelled door and turned a corner into the hospital canteen. The space was cramped with tables, nearly all of them empty except for one in the far corner near the window, which seated four young men and two women in lab coats – residents, most likely. Despite the late hour, they were all in high spirits, nursing their soft drinks and trading jokes, laughing with booming peals as if they didn’t know that the world was ending.
Sherlock looked in the mirror. He still looked fine. He rubbed at his cheeks a bit more to force some colour back into them. Then he straightened his lapels, expelled the last of the tightness in his throat, then took just one more moment to steel himself before he left the bedroom.
John stared back, silent. And then, slowly, beautifully, a bright, wide smile spread out across his face.
John’s right hand was resting on his lap, underneath the table, safely out of view to anyone who looked into their conference room. Sherlock reached out his own hand and covered it, gently, threading his long fingers between John’s broader ones, settling himself into his warm, comforting grip, just where he belonged.
The doorknob rattled loudly, snapping them both out of the spell and forcing them to tear their gaze away with the utmost reluctance. They raised their weapons in unison, both sucking in a steadying breath as the door was unlocked and swung wide into the room.
His brain felt like it was hammering against his skull, his ears ringing, daggers shooting through his side at every inhale, every retch. His entire body was shivering in a cold sweat, and he barely noticed Sherlock’s arms wrapped around him, holding him through it, lips brushing the side of his neck as he whispered soothingly against his skin.
She dragged her hand along the top of John’s chair as she turned away, and sauntered slowly out the door, passing by Sherlock without even glancing at him.
He angled his face to pull him in even deeper, and the kiss was almost overwhelming in its intensity but John didn’t care, because he could feel Sherlock’s heartbeat across his own skin and breathe every breath from his lungs, because he could feel the depths of love and devotion and vulnerability in every press of his lips, because Sherlock was holding him and protecting him and
It was still pitch dark outside. A low boom of thunder sounded from over the hills, and John’s eyelids began to sag with sleep again.
“Perfect, thanks mate.” Lestrade grinned at them both, and then turned to climb the stairs after John. Sherlock followed them, his footfalls a bit heavy, and he caught John’s eye just for a moment as he turned over his shoulder with a doleful smile, just long enough to give him a curt nod and look back down at his feet. Maybe it was better this way after all.
Sherlock paused, swallowing hard, then exhaled heavily, trying to expel out his anxieties as best he could.
John stared for a moment, feeling it stretch out into a silent eternity as he took in Sherlock’s inquisitive expression, then swallowed, pursing his lips. He wasn’t exactly sure what he’d been about to ask, but the idea of asking
Sherlock watched him, as he ran toward the school doors and disappeared through the crowd, watched the black coat and blond head until he couldn’t see him anymore. He took a deep breath, his mind reeling for what he could possibly have in mind, but if it meant the smallest chance that he wouldn’t have to leave him, well. Sherlock would never have been able to pass that up.
A wave of profound disgruntlement washed over everyone at this speech. Some people shifted their eyes away uncomfortably, some others grumbled a little and turned back to their papers. Even the most sympathetic-looking ones seemed anxious to voice their support.
There was silence, just for a second. A heartbeat. And then, like a rubber band pulled taut and snapped, they surged toward each other.
“Hey, I don’t care.” John stroked soothing circles around Sherlock’s back, and dropped a kiss on the skin closest to his lips – which happened to be the middle of his scrunched-up brow, right above his nose. “As long as you’re here.”
The small rustlings and shifting of the reporters quietened a little. A few of them had stopped writing, to look up at him in surprise.
He’d been here before, once. Last year, when the dull ache of London life had finally grown too stifling and repetitive. So he’d found this place, this lovely, secluded little villa in the rolling hills just outside of Marseilles, where he’d have space to collect his thoughts.
“No star can do that.” John’s eyes followed where Sherlock was pointing, upwards and vaguely to the right.
The laughter in the hallway rang out in his ears, but there was no picture to accompany it. Sherlock scowled in frustration and bounded up the stairs; he had no patience for his mind palace to fail him now.
Sherlock cast his eyes down, shaking his head, but John drew him back with an urgent hand at the nape of his neck.
Mycroft nodded, and turned away. Sherlock lingered a second, two, just long enough for him to school himself back into composure and give John a polite nod, then followed his brother.
John quieted suddenly. His eyes blinked open and he fought to even out his breath, as Sherlock’s words whirled around his desire-clouded mind before coming to a halt. The words that weren’t just a refusal, but a vow and a reassurance and a declaration all wrapped up into one, and John felt his breath hitch again, not with arousal this time, as he held the steadfast gaze of the man who loved him.
“Alright,” Sherlock murmured back. He resumed his stroking up John’s arm, but the motion felt…less restless now? John was too drowsy to tell.
John’s rapid breath hitched, and he swallowed, nodding quickly. He stroked once more over Sherlock’s prostate – Sherlock gasped out a silent cry – and drew his fingers out, grabbing the lube again and slicking himself liberally. He positioned himself deliberately between Sherlock’s legs, trailing one hand gently up and down Sherlock’s side, using the other to line himself up at Sherlock’s entrance.
John’s smile widened, which deepened the lines around his mouth, but somehow, only made him look more youthful.
“You’ve seen the films, kiddo,” he said, something low and fierce in his words now. “It ain’t over till it’s over!”
Sherlock nodded once, quickly, and kissed him deeply once more, his thumb brushing one more time down his cheek as his other hand gave his cock one last deliberate stroke. John relaxed his grip on Sherlock’s back reluctantly to let him reach for the bedside drawer and fumble for the bottle of lube, his neck and chest flushed a sinful shade of pink and his plump lips fallen open, breathing evenly, heavily.
He was getting too old for this, surely. Before, the kids and their stupid antics had been fun, even charming, in their way. But now they were barely enough for a distraction.
wasn’t about to relax. He needed something to do, something to keep him occupied while he was stuck here being useless. “Coffee!” he almost shouted. “Does anyone else need coffee?”
“Get these off,” John whispered, tugging at the waistband of Sherlock’s pants, tented sharply at the front.
On screen, the video cut to the last shot – of John waving out at the crowd of remaining guests as he got into the car that would take him and Mary to the airport.
Sherlock scrambled in awkwardly, dropping the towel and trying to pull the sheets over himself without stealing them all from John. John rolled on his side so Sherlock could slot into him, and wrapped his arms around him to pull him closer.
Slowly, he let out a shaky exhale and stood up on unsteady legs. Molly and Mrs. Hudson reached out to lay clumsy hands on his back as he steeled himself, one last futile attempt at comfort.
“Certainly it’d be worth it for – what’s the sale right now?” Sherlock looked around at the mass of gold-emblazoned advertisements surrounding the entrance. “Getting the best deal on the new line of jumpers.”
In some adjacent room, the monitor had levelled out and was gleefully announcing 84 beats per minute. Somehow, Sherlock thought he felt his own heart calm enough to match it.
“I know. Oh God, I know.” John’s voice was becoming equally as strained. He brushed a curl away from Sherlock’s temple. “I love you too.”
. Blood, so much blood, seeping through John’s shirt, staining his jacket, running down toward his palms…
“Well,” he said, finally. “I just – wanted to say…” Something stuck in his throat. He had to swallow it down painfully before he continued. “…thank you for the Christmas card.”
“What were you doing up there?” he asked. They hardly used the upstairs bedroom anymore, only ever dusting it out when Sherlock’s parents came to stay, or Harry needed a place to crash after another domestic.
“Gorgeous,” John whispered reverently, and Sherlock groaned long and low in the back of his throat.  John’s hands came to rest at Sherlock’s hips, his thumbs pushing down the waistband of his pants to continue nuzzling his iliac crest. He planted a kiss at the base of it, and then moved downward, kissing at the inside of his thighs, nuzzling at the crease of his hip, paying attention to everywhere but his cock, prominently tenting the soft cotton of his pants.
Sherlock smirked a bit as he dabbed away the last of the adhesive residue left by the bandage, then tugged a dry towel off the rack. “She won’t stay long, you know her.” He carefully patted at John’s skin with it, drying off the wound. “And if she gets to be too much, I’ll put her off.”
He hurried from the Baker Street station up the street, and let himself through the front door to Sherlock’s flat. He bounded up the stairs, beaming, and knocked twice on the door to the sitting room to announce his presence before pushing it open.
Sherlock reached out and took the flowers, and then leaned in as John stepped forward to close the gap between them. Their lips met, and it was soft and uncoordinated because they were still smiling too wide, and that only made them laugh harder as they tried again, and again, until at last they sank into each other, not feeling the chill trickling in through the open door. Sherlock flung his arms around John’s shoulders, the bouquet clutched against John’s back, and John pulled him closer with one arm snaking around his waist and the other clutching at the fabric of his dressing gown, feeling the warmth of his body chase out the darkness, the last vestiges of doubt.
John grinned back as a he felt a small weight lift from his chest. “Perfect,” he said, and reached across the table to thread his fingers through Sherlock’s, hoping to coax that remaining anxiety out of him, hoping Sherlock would let him shoulder some of it. Sherlock’s brow smoothed into contentment as he brought the phone up to his ear and let it ring, but somehow John didn’t feel quite as relieved as he thought he would.
“Hey!” shouted another voice from his left side. Another guard. Sherlock didn’t slow down. The guard seized the collar of Sherlock’s coat, and Sherlock slipped his arms out of it and kept running.
John moaned, a long guttural sound vibrating deep within his chest, and dipped his head to kiss messily at Sherlock’s lips. He rocked his hips forward, slowly, and the sensation pushed a sharp, breathy cry up through Sherlock’s lungs. John tightened his grip around Sherlock’s shoulders as he sped up slightly, setting a slow but earnest pace, savoring the quakes of pleasure coursing through each of them together.
Flashes of white teeth, shining blue eyes, laugh lines swam in front of his vision and flickered out before he could reach them. The front hallway at Baker Street, the ornate walls of Buckingham Palace, the darkened shadows behind brick buildings, the soft glow of their bedroom – they were everywhere, everywhere, and Sherlock couldn’t hold onto any one of them. And that laugh – that beautiful, joyous, resounding laugh echoed through them all, cruelly out of his reach, and for a moment Sherlock wondered if he’d ever truly remember what it sounded like, or if he’d have to settle for the crude approximation by a faceless resident in a white coat, and somehow be thankful for it.
“Thanks,” Sherlock said, lowly. He tried to smile, tried not to let Dad see his disappointment, but he knew it was no use. “Plan didn’t work, though.”
“Good morning,” Magnussen replied. He was smiling at him, his eyes trailing on him as he moved down the stairs. “How is your day so far?”
She’d had no idea what to do about Sam, and John looked around at the empty room now, hoping the answer might magically come to him from somewhere unexpected, but there was nothing yet. He sighed, moving to the sink and staring out the window above it.
The painless comfort of that afternoon didn’t last, as John knew it wouldn’t, but it was still no less frustrating to be awakened as result of full-body soreness warring with full-body exhaustion, with the pain eventually winning out. It happened so often this past week and a half that John was almost used to it, but it hadn’t yet become much easier.
Someone had chucked a mobile phone at him, and someone else had barked out a loud “shh!”. Sherlock brought the phone to his ear.
He watched Sherlock’s strong, nimble fingers as they applied the new bandage, smooth it over gently, making sure it covered everything and stayed in place. When he was done, he leaned in and pressed gentle kiss to the skin right above it, like he always did, and if anything could have taken away John’s pain in that moment, that was it.
Sherlock nearly gasped out loud – his heart was thudding in his chest, hopeful but not quite believing it – but there he was, standing right over the pocket watch display, sandwiched between the cufflinks and the women’s necklaces, and stuffing the package into his inside coat pocket as quickly as he could.
“For actually giving a real answer to a question. It doesn’t often happen here at Radio Watford, I can tell you.”
Then a faint rattling sound came from beyond the door at the end of the room, and it swung open to reveal…John, pushing a rolling cart laden with cups and teapots.
John swallowed – Sherlock saw his Adam’s apple bob in his throat – and looked like he might have been about to whisper something, but then suddenly there were footsteps approaching behind them.
“Well then.” Mycroft dropped his hand, and schooled his features back into professional stoicism. Away from being Sherlock’s brother for now, and back into being his chief advisor. “Would you like to meet your household staff?”
“Got them,” Sherlock said, holding up the gloves, and trying his absolute best not to betray what he’d just seen in his expression. “Now, what are we getting for Harry?”
He opened his eyes, saw a blinding light shining in his face. He broke off from John reluctantly, and stared outward – at the entire auditorium, staring back at him.
As he approached the office again though, he slowed down, then stopped at the end of the row of cubicles. Through the glass paneling he could see John at the desk, and Mia standing there next to him. Her bright red nails were clasped around a stack of files, but her other hand was resting on the back of John’s chair. Actually, not resting so much as…stroking. It looked like a large spider, waiting to strike.
John cradled Sherlock’s face in his hands and drew him up again, thumbs swiping over the hard lines of his cheekbones as he kissed him, less hurriedly than before. He shrugged himself the rest of the way out of his shirt and let it fall to the floor, all of his beautiful upper body now bared to Sherlock’s greedy eyes. Sherlock ran his hands down over his muscled arms, up his taut stomach, lingering over his peaked nipples, needing to touch him everywhere, needing to feel the entirety of John’s body underneath his hands.
They sat together a while longer. Janine said nothing as Sherlock started his recording again, didn’t even give the impression that she noticed. Relieved, he gave some subdued laughs to her further abuses of the DJ and various wedding guests, then, when he could tell she was getting bored, pointed her in the direction of a young man who’d be keen to dance with her.
Sherlock, though, was cheerful, or as cheerful as he could be with the mountain of papers teetering in front of him on this desk they’d commandeered. It had been an
– but at the same time, letting Sherlock take control like this, go at his own pace, was so bloody sexy it made his toes curl. He pulled in long, slow breaths, and tried to get himself under control.
“Any progress with our matchmaking plans?” she asked. She nodded towards Sherlock, who was gesturing towards a large sheet of paper propped up against the wall.
“I’m here, John. Can you hear me? ” Sherlock held John’s hand as if it would shatter in his grip, running his fingers over chapped skin and settling it between both of his own. He looked up at John’s face, at his tensed brow and fluttering lashes, and willed him to try to respond.
Sherlock leaned forward, and John titled his head to meet his kiss with eager lips. Sherlock delved in with just as much enthusiasm as before, and John dipped his tongue back in, picking up his exploration where he left off. Everything else was falling away again, and there was nothing but the feeling of Sherlock, here and now. They might have never stopped.
,” he said. His arms were spread wider now, as if in supplication. “Sherlock, you’ve got nothing to lose, and you’ll always regret it if you don’t.”
“Yeah, yeah,” John replied, absently. He’d only just noticed the second person getting out of her car, parked at the end of the drive.
“He’s not here. He’s at work.” Mr. Holmes grabbed his coat from its hook next to the door. “Come on, I’ll take you.”
Sherlock was staring, too – he looked just as breathless as John, his eyes roving over him just as uncertainly.
, but how was that possible, when Sherlock had never left his side? When Sherlock had been more caring, more affectionate, more tender with him than John could have ever felt he deserved? How could he ever make Sherlock feel like what he’d done wasn’t enough – like
made me strong,” John insisted, something heavy muffling the words in his throat as his hands clutched tightly at Sherlock’s sides.
Sherlock watched him as he left, closing the door behind him. John’s footfalls echoed through the staircase as he climbed up to his bedroom, and Sherlock’s smile faltered only a little, his shoulders sagging only a fraction of an inch as his steps faded into silence.
Time passed in silence, and finally, Sherlock stood. He seemed to stretch himself arduously, then packed up his things and slid on his coat. John turned back to his computer with a blank stare, and didn’t look up as Sherlock flicked off the lights and stepped out through his door.
“Because…” he sighed, then paused. He seemed to be searching for the right words. “Because…then you would have asked me why I was bothering, when obviously a necklace isn’t going to fix anything between them. And…”
John gave a nervous little chuckle in return, casting his gaze around, trying both to look at Sherlock and not look at him.
He didn’t look angry or upset, but there was something knowing in his expression all the same. John’s stomach flipped at the sight of it. Sam had always been perceptive, understanding the things John didn’t say as much as the things he did.
It could have been a room straight out of Buckingham palace, and yet they were going to be using it, as far as John could tell, to shoot a single sex scene over the next five weeks.
She gave him a little smile in return, and laid a brief hand on his shoulder as she passed. It was a gesture he wouldn’t have allowed from anyone else, but Mrs. Hudson just seemed to have the intuition for things like that. It was nice, sort of.
“It’s not worth it, you know,” John shouted back, shaking the water out of his ears. “It isn’t bloody Shakespeare.”
John felt better in the morning, though still fairly dazed, and the pain was more from the soreness of the previous night’s dry heaving than any internal throbbing, which was a relief. He felt weaker than normal, his legs too shaky to stand for too long, so Sherlock settled him onto the sofa and brought him his breakfast there, tea and buttered toast that John devoured instantly, ravenous even as the residual sickliness ebbed away.
“And then today, seeing you at the station…” John pressed his face into Sherlock’s neck, his voice suddenly thick. “I wanted so badly just to hold you, and I couldn’t, I had to pretend…” He sucked in a long shuddering breath. “And you were so brilliant, with the plan and at the break-in, and I wanted to tell you, to show you, but there were all those people around… God, Sherlock, it was
Sherlock felt sick as he turned away from them and approached the counter. From a tired-looking boy in a green apron he ordered three regular coffees and one decaf for Mrs. Hudson. The boy brought them in a cardboard tray and Sherlock threw down too much money and moved off before he had to say anything more.
Sherlock turned back to John, whose head snapped up to meet his gaze. His hands were clenching in his lap.
As John drove back to the villa, the only thing he could see was that vision of Sherlock on the dock, bare and determined, ready to leap.
He felt elation bubbling up in his chest, and he bit back the grin that was trying to creep across his face, reigning it into something more sensible. He was sure that the small smile he sent back at Sherlock didn’t fool him, but he didn’t care. There was a thrill of excitement running through him that he’d never felt before.
He lingered under the warm spray just long enough to feel some of the tension ebb away from his shoulder and lower back, and there was a pleasant current of warmth underneath his skin. He stepped out of the shower with that pleasant feeling that the air in the flat was outside of him, rather than a part of him. Feeling thoroughly loosened up, he gave his hair a quick towel dry, then pulled on the nearest dressing gown – Sherlock’s red one, as it turned out – then opened the door to the bedroom.
John burst through the door to his bedroom and raced around it in a mad scramble. He seized the clothes tossed carelessly onto the bed and shoved them into the wardrobe. He grabbed the old magazine from the nightstand and stuffed it into the drawer. He cast his gaze around, looking for anything else – it seemed okay. Nothing out of place. Appropriate, and inviting. John placed his phone on the nightstand, then tugged his coat off and tossed it over a chair.
John closed his book quietly and stood up from his chair, crossing the room to where Sherlock was still channeling his sonata. Softly, tenderly, John wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s middle, pressing his chest to his back, and felt the music flow through them both, followed his movements and let them rock together.
man, who wanted him so much that it may as well have been written on his face – and then he glanced around one last time, just to be safe, before covertly reaching forward and squeezing John’s fingers between his own.
It opened almost instantly, with a slew of people apparently about to flood out of it. A middle-aged couple with three children in front of them, and two younger women pulling on their coats, all saw him and stopped in their tracks.
Understanding dawned in John’s eyes a nanosecond after Sherlock’s own. He cleared his throat awkwardly, and looked away, but the determination in his expression was unmistakeable.
Sherlock blinked, letting his mind sluggishly absorb those words and all their implications. They filtered down through his nerves and lodged themselves in the pit of dread at the centre of his chest.
He couldn’t bear this anymore. He couldn’t bear to see Sherlock across the room like this but not really
Somewhere, a heart monitor faded into earshot, beating out a rapid half-stable pattern. Sherlock waited for Mycroft to speak again.
Sherlock moaned, desperate, and tugged John down to kiss him deeply, snaking his arms around his back and pulling him down so that they were chest to chest, the warmth of John’s entire body settling on him like a comforting weight, bared to him at last, nothing left to separate even one inch of Sherlock Holmes from the man he loved.
“Well, um,” John finally looked directly at Sherlock, his lips pursing briefly before evening out into something beautifully genuine. “Last night meant a lot to me.” His eyes were deeper than Sherlock had ever seen them. “And, I guess I’m just trying to say thank you.”
But he was running out of time. Christmas Eve, and their last shooting day, was coming quickly, and John didn’t know what he’d do if they finished and he couldn’t pluck up the courage to ask him. What would happen – they’d just say goodbye, and never see each other again? No, that wasn’t on. John couldn’t have that at
Sherlock tried to laugh, but it was so sudden and harsh that it sounded more like a sob. More tears were slipping out from underneath his screwed-up eyes, so overwhelmed with this respite, with this reaffirmation, with knowing that things were going to be alright after all – it was all so much for his fragile, newly-restored heart.
John inhaled deep, pulling in the smell and warmth of him into his lungs, and felt his own trembling limbs steady somewhat.
Inside his mind, he opened his eyes to the front door of 221B. He made himself reach for it slowly, listen to the click of the knob as he turned it, feel the creak of the hinges run through his hand as he pushed it open.
His voice broke on the last letter; underneath the doctor’s arm flung solid across his chest, Sherlock sucked air into his lungs with the desperation of a drowning man.
He didn’t know how long they stayed there; hours, maybe, or days. Maybe it was next Christmas Eve by the time they finally broke apart again. All he knew was that the chasm in his chest had long gone now, and the tears had dried on his face by the time he drew back with a wavering smile.
He waited maybe five minutes, watching out through the dim window, before he saw him running back. Sherlock scooted over the seat to the window, and rolled it down.
Sherlock tilted his head upward, and kissed at John’s jawline. His warm breath tickled John’s face. John smiled, humming a little in the back of his throat.
“Mmm, great,” John replied with a smirk. He wrapped his arm around Sherlock’s waist and leaned into him, though not entirely because he needed the support. “Maybe we can talk her into a game of Cluedo – liven things up a bit.”
back in – for a bruising kiss, and John’s heart filled to the brim and spilled over. He dove in without restraint, tightening his arms across Sherlock’s back, and kissed him long, hard, and jubilant, kissed them both breathless and gasping, kissed his own bursting soul into Sherlock’s gorgeous lips.
Sherlock heard him, but it was if at a great distance. He was still looking at John, into those bright laughing eyes.
“Yeah,” John murmured again, barely a breath this time. He tilted his chin up for another kiss, nipping sweetly at Sherlock’s bottom lip. “Just...slowly, okay?”
He squeezed her shoulder reassuringly, and darted out of the room. He gave a sigh of relief as he spotted his keys on the kitchen counter.
For once, they didn’t speak when John drove him home later. John kept stealing little looks at Sherlock out of the corner of his eye, but the silence felt unusually fragile, and sacred. He didn’t dare break it.
They were barely through Sherlock’s front door when they collided, falling against the wall of the entryway and hands scrabbling for anywhere they could reach. Sherlock’s mouth was everywhere, on John’s lips, his jaw, down his neck, and John clumsily shucked Sherlock’s coat off his shoulders, breathing hard and fast.
Through the crowd, Sherlock spotted John hanging out near the back; his eyes were glued to the radio like everyone else’s, the wrinkled skin under his eyes growing more pronounced with anticipation as the seconds ticked by.
“It’s a rainy Christmas Eve all over the UK” came the voice from the radio. “And the big question is, who is number one on the Radio One chartshow tonight?”
Lestrade’s efforts were hardly better than Molly’s. Sherlock breathed deeply, trying to relax his tensed muscles.
He looked up to see that the window had swung open, and a harsh wind was coming through it. One of the trees outside was rapping its branches against the glass. John could hear the air
There was a good three feet of distance between them, but suddenly it felt as if they were closer than they’d been all day. Finally they had no responsibilities, no one watching them, no one to answer to.  It was as if a wall lying between them had suddenly come crashing down, and they were finally free.
“I love you,” Sherlock whispered against the wound. “More than anything. I love you. Please…” His voice was shaking heavily, like a sob. “Please know that.”
“Well, here’s one that says, ‘John and Mary’s Wedding’, do you think we might be on the right track?”
He replied to a few texts while he waited for Sherlock; he could hear the steady rhythm of the water, and heard him sigh a couple times as he relaxed into it, washing away the irritations of the day. Normally, a night after a long case was one of John’s favorite times – either with a lovely late-night dinner, or adrenaline-fueled post-case sex at Baker Street. This case today had been far too frustrating for either of those things, though, and Sherlock had been running around in the spiral of his own mind for hours. John supposed it was fitting that all they had to come down from that with was an old guest house in the middle of nowhere.
She didn’t laugh. She looked from the hors d’oeuvres to him, then shook her head sharply. “No, thanks.”
A huge fist suddenly wrapped around Sherlock’s lungs and squeezed all the air out of them with a painful jerk.
Sherlock moved to close it again, but someone else had arrived – John, bearing some files. Sherlock ducked his head quickly and motioned for him to come in, watched him deposit his pile and collect the finished one from the desk while his mouth worked uselessly, trying to say something,
Dimly, he heard a chair scraping the floor as it was pushed up beside his, and a figure in a lilac dress dropped down into it. He didn’t have to look to recognize her as Janine, the maid of honour. They’d only introduced themselves briefly after the ceremony, but she’d been the only bridesmaid to bother with him, and she’d taken to him rather…strongly, to say the least.
John sighed again as he pulled him in deeper, deeper still. His fingers dipped under the collar of Sherlock’s shirt, dragged across pale, smooth skin, traced the sharp lines of his collarbones. They trailed down the fabric and began undoing the buttons, and Sherlock’s fingers quickly joined them to help. He made quick work of it, tossing the shirt to the side, then moved on to his trousers, pulling at the zip and efficiently shucking them off and throwing them in the same direction.
“Let’s go,” Sherlock cut across him. He held open the door for John to climb in first. “They’re waiting for us.”
“Any idea what we’re working on, by the way?” Sherlock said in a low voice. He spoke out of the corner of his mouth, looking over the sea of crew members working at least three cameras.
Sherlock seized the phone out of his pocket, fingers fumbling at the keypad as he ripped the scarf from his neck.
It didn’t make sense. John’s mind had spun as he pulled on his jacket, trying to fathom a reason for it. It was just a holiday to the States, what could go so wrong? But still, whatever it was, it had silenced him, and he’d found no desire to needle Sherlock about it anymore.
Mrs. Hudson hurried forward and folded Sherlock into a bone-crushing hug, and he sank into it eagerly. Lestrade wrapped his arms around Molly, who buried herself in his chest, while Mycroft dropped back down into his chair with a contented exhale.
“A mistake, yes.” Sherlock nodded, and his heart sank further at the relief that flooded through John’s face.
“You have,” John whispered, desperately. “You do. Oh Sherlock, you always do.” John tugged lightly at the base of Sherlock’s skull, and Sherlock obediently came back up to capture his lips again, kissing him with a hard desperation that held all of his built up doubts, all his fears that he’d been carrying alone; John took them all, drew them out, and they shouldered the weight together so that Sherlock could let them go.
He abandoned the couple at the table and moved toward the railing, looking down at the crowd on the first floor.
John suddenly was very aware of how close they were. Sherlock had swum towards him, making his way back to the dock, and had stopped within a foot of him, where pages were floating all around.
The red wouldn’t subside – flowing like a river over every polished surface, every glass door, every whitewashed tile of this waiting area. Sherlock tried to breathe in time with a heart monitor that was beeping away in some adjacent room, visualizing the peaks and timing each inhale and exhale, slowly, deliberately – but that only brought him back to red, red pouring out through gauze in the back of the ambulance, red flashing out on the surrounding buildings as the siren screamed its way through traffic. Red dripping over pale, pale skin and staining the tips of strong, callused fingers.
Sherlock took a few deep breaths. He could do this. This was what he’d been practicing for. A few girls around them were muttering to each other about stage fright as they started to take their places behind the curtain, but Sherlock tuned them out. His nerves weren’t about performing. He’d played in front of people lots of times before. No, this was when everything was either going to slot into place, or it wasn’t. It was his last chance. He had to make it count.
tell her when we go over there on Christmas Eve. We’ll need something to liven the night up, after all.”
Sherlock replied with a kiss to John’s temple. His lips were warm, his heartbeat steady against John’s own, and his hands trembled only the slightest bit as they held John like they would never let him go.
John sighed, and his hips hitched again, rutting half-heartedly at the sheets beneath. He could barely move them, though, what with Sherlock’s weight pressing down on his lower back, and
“Oh.” John could hear the dejection in his voice. He forced his face into a neutral position, and stood up, too. “Right.”
A dreadful weight settled in Sherlock’s stomach as he looked desperately at the men and women around him. At least ten of them in the immediate vicinity, all of them armed, and all bound by law to put a stop to any homosexual activity they witnessed. They’d been gracious (or perhaps simply put off) enough thus far to leave Sherlock in relative peace while he worked, but there was no doubt in Sherlock’s mind that nothing could make them turn on him more quickly than to see him embrace another man in the middle of their station.
“…finally caught him going over Southwark bridge.” Lestrade finished his story with just a hint of pride in his voice. “He was easy enough to find – you wouldn’t have liked it, Sherlock – but he gave us a hell of a chase.”
He raised his eyebrows, a little surprised, but replied: “Of course, sir,” and closed the door again, standing protectively outside it.
“And, Jerry says, if you could just put your hands on his chest?” the AD said, from just out of the way.
Sherlock’s breath hitched again, his pupils dilating with unmistakable yearning. He worried the crease of his brow for only a moment before leaning in slightly, his hand moving upward to cup John’s face gently, holding him steady.
It was soft, and genuine. Not bright with laughter, but warm and crinkling the corners of his eyes. It was a bit crooked on one side, like he hadn’t shown anyone this kind of real pleasure in a long time, and was out of practice. It was
It was very late by the time he was able to drag himself up to his bedroom. He toed off his shoes and tugged off his tie and jacket, feeling weary down to his bones.
Forcing his hand to steady enough to reach it, he pulled it out and brought it up to his ear. “Hello?”
“Fuck, it’s freezing!” John shrieked as he surfaced. The water was like tiny icy daggers, piercing him all over his skin. “Fuck!”
He gave a half-hearted little laugh, and, to his immense relief, Sherlock’s face relaxed into the smallest of smiles. He looked weary beyond belief, and it send a sharp spike through John’s chest, but it was still a smile. Still Sherlock.
Waves of confusion, of desire and caution crashed against each other in his mind. He felt disoriented and lost. How the hell had this happened so quickly?
Her nose was a bright red and her eyes watery, but other than that she didn’t look too bad. She’d probably get over her cold in a few more days. It was just really bad timing, honestly, that the worst of it had hit her on the day of Mike Stamford’s wedding.
His eyes flickered back up to Sherlock, his gaze carrying no small amount of heat behind his reserved expression. Sherlock swallowed, knowing full well that John was having just as much difficulty holding back as he was. He tried once more to look apologetic – God knows this isn’t how he had pictured their reunion – but John gave him a soft smile, to show he understood.
“They can wait, they won’t split up in five extra minutes,” Sherlock said, waving a hand dismissively. “And anyway, first things first.”
The days dragged onward, with hardly enough change in John’s condition to make them worth noting. The wound still throbbed, though the painkillers were mostly enough to force it down to a manageable ache, and the nausea and headaches came in intervals that were only slightly shorter each time. Mostly, now, John was starting to get restless – days of crap telly and sleep were wearing on his mind like a whetstone slowly scraping away, and his limbs itched with the desire to get out of the flat, to seek that excitement he relied on so much now, just to
“Yes, you would.” John was grinning stupidly, foiling his attempt at sternness. “And you’re doing it right now.”
The house was quiet on Christmas Eve. Just a bare-bones staff on tonight, the rest were at home with their families. Even Mycroft hadn’t been able to escape dinner with Mum and Dad, though they’d graciously let Sherlock off to do his duty to his country. Sherlock imagined he wouldn’t be hearing the end of that from his brother any time soon.
The man lifted a shaky hand in deference, and with his other reached into his trouser pocket, fingers fumbling for the memory stick, and Sherlock began to lower his pistol–
“Yeah, not always the case, is it?” John had crossed his arms over his chest now, unsure of what to do with them. “I was um, standing in for Chris Pine once, on
But he couldn’t even listen to her; he lifted his head, and stared at the door where Sherlock had left through, his body too full of misery to take in anything else.
“Yeah?” John said, without thinking – though he could feel his cheeks reddening at how bright and hopeful he sounded. “Good.”
“Oh – yeah, thanks,” he said weakly. He took the napkin Sherlock was holding out to him, which held a few brittle crostini with what looked like salmon laid on top of them.
“John, I’ve got it!” He shouted as he burst through the door of Baker Street that evening. He pulled off his coat and shook the moisture from it – the roads were still running with melted snow – and bounded up the stairs to the sitting room, where he tore open the first file and began pinning sheets to the Crime Wall, which was growing rather rapidly over the sofa.
They left him in a rush, and he watched the breathy cloud they created break across Sherlock’s lips.
John smiled softly, feeling his mind slow to a blissful crawl and fade into the warmth of Sherlock’s body, beside him, all around him, keeping him safe. Just as he was dozing off, Sherlock pressed a firm kiss to the crown of John’s head, and didn’t move away.
If Mycroft saw Sherlock’s bewilderment, he didn’t acknowledge it, just quirked his lips up in the subtlest of smiles.
“Yeah.” John quirked his eyebrow up, almost imploringly. “Just an easy one, something without running?”
Sherlock had the sudden urge to laugh. If John only knew what those words sounded like to him. What this all
Nice of them, John thought dimly. Maybe they could do the entire world next. Stop it from spinning. Just stop all of it.
Sherlock gave a soft snuffle of quiet laughter. “Next time I’ll get us home in time,” he murmured, gently.
“You’re sure it’ll be alright?” He whispered, and his voice was so deep and rich it felt like liquid fire pooling in John’s chest.
“Um…” John was stammering now, too. “This is – my sister, Harry,” he indicated one of the women at the back, “and – Clara, and my cousins, Tony and Julie…”
“I was embarrassed,” he said, nearly whispering now, too. “I didn’t know how much you’d seen, or what you would think…”
But the last bit of restraint in him snapped at the sound – the sound of his name in that beloved voice, simple and earnest. John surged forward, seizing Sherlock with both hands by the nape of his neck, and kissed him.
John’s face broke into a chuckle, and Sherlock instantly felt better. “That, too,” John admitted. He turned to look towards Sherlock again. “Just don’t go too far, okay?”
John smiled, and Sherlock couldn’t help but mirror him a bit. It always felt like a gift when he pushed out of their burnout enough to smile at him like that.
He clutches at the jagged rock wall. He knows it’s useless. It’s fifty feet high, and his hands scrabble at the sharp pebbles, slashing feeling into his frozen skin. The water’s up to his waist, and only rising.
He rattled off something about the news story coming up afterwards, and Sherlock turned back towards John outside, hoping to share in the laughter with him. But John’s head was hanging down between his shoulders, shaking back and forth.
“Oh, Sherlock…” John choked out a shattered gasp of breath; the prickle behind his eyes flared up even stronger. “Of
“Well, on all manner of adventures.” He looked back up toward where the star supposedly was. “You could have gotten your bearings from it all the way round Europe, or used it to set out looking for the New World.”
“You’ll come back a broken man,” he said from the sitting room table, barely glancing up from his newspaper.
“Mmm, yeah, come on, Sherlock,” John whispered. He kissed blindly at Sherlock’s bottom lip, his mind whirling. “Come for me, let me feel you.”
Sherlock gasped out something between bewilderment and hope, and the corners of his mouth twitched, not yet daring. “Do you mean it?"
“Yeah.” John grinned a bit and opened his eyes, bringing the mug to his lips and sipping at the milky liquid. “Bit unfair though, me lazing around all day while you do all the work and worry about me.”
The hesitation in John’s voice was different from what it had just been. Sherlock looked back up at him to find his brow raised, almost shyly.
“No!” he shouted in a whisper. He whirled around, scanning the other kids around him to make sure no one had seen.
Sherlock sighed deeply, and leaned his forehead against John’s, allowing his eyes to fall closed again. He melted into John’s touch, feeling in the warmth of his body so deeply it was as if he were absorbing it.
I’ll marry you, of course…” and his voice was breaking, and John could taste his certainty in every swipe of his tongue, every gleeful
“Hello, Sherlock.” John said, with a brief smile and a nod. Then he realized what he’d just said and his eyes widened. “I mean – sir” he stammered out.
Sherlock had the song memorized in about ten minutes – it was comically easy compared to what he normally played – but he practiced for hours upon hours anyway. All his free time was devoted to going over those notes, again and again, until they were muscle memory, until he could have played them in his sleep. Until Dad started groaning every time he started up playing it again, so loudly that Sherlock could hear him wherever he was in the house.
John trailed off from whatever he had been saying. His face didn’t change, but he turned his head microscopically to look at Sherlock, a hint of worry behind his questioning eyes.
But John was smiling at him, that sincere, genuine smile, and Sherlock knew how much he meant it. Every word.
“You’d still be taking a chance, John.” Urgency was rising in Sherlock’s voice now. “Even…even at this stage, it’s still not advisable–”
“I’m glad we weren’t driving in this,” Sherlock said softly. He stared out the window, trying to track the storm. His naked silhouette, illuminated by a pale sliver of moon, was unearthly gorgeous.
“Come on, get a grip,” he murmured sourly as he straightened back up. “You’re the Prime Minister, for God’s sake.”
He fidgeted with his hands a little, clenched in his lap. They were still itching, burning with lost feeling.
Sherlock surged forward at the harsh, desperate sound that was John’s voice, at his gentle tugging at his shoulders. He let the tickets fall to the ground as he threw his arms around John, clutching tight to his back, his shoulders, whatever he could reach. He buried his face in John’s shoulder and let out a single, earth-shattering sob, letting himself expel his tears, tears of embarrassment, of joy, of heart-crushing relief that was spreading through him like a warm flame, chasing away the darkness.
together – and Sherlock had been missing him so much he could hardly bear it. Any satisfaction that he might have gleaned from deducing the hiding places of gangsters using little more than layers of dust on door hinges was immediately snuffed when he would instinctively turn around to share his brilliance with John and find only the DI’s stone-faced stare. The endless hours on increasingly dreary crime scenes were filled only with stiff questions from mind-numbingly stupid officers, and Sherlock often thought that he would give up any number of secret boltholes and missing corpses just to hear one word in John’s familiar, comforting voice.
“Verusha Sokolov.” He extracted the file triumphantly and handed it off to John, who began poring over its contents. “Forty-seven years old, kingpin of the Sokolov family, and all but untouchable for the past ten years. The Sokolovs have storied and bloody history with the Orlovas, the family to which all the victims belonged.”
“Yeah.” John nodded. He felt the grounds of this argument settle a bit more solidly under his feet. “I probably need to go for girls who are cooler, you know.” He straightened up defiantly, looking Sherlock up and down. “Game for a laugh. Like American girls!”
Sherlock didn’t think twice. He grabbed John’s hand and pulled them through the back curtain, away from the stage hand who had just walked through their hiding place. He pulled him along the back of the stage, right along a large carboard painting of a sleigh, before he felt they were safe again.
The next morning found John awake early, earlier even than Sherlock, and he rolled over carefully so as not to wake him. He winced only the tiniest bit as he settled himself onto his wounded side and scanned Sherlock’s face in the shadows; his brow smoothed of the day’s worries, his eyelids fluttering with the hint of a dream, his sleep-mussed curls tumbling softly over his temples.
John trembled faintly with his own sharp intake of breath, then drew back from the tight embrace to claim Sherlock’s lips once more.
A barrage of dreadful thoughts chased each other around his head, until he finally fell into a fitful sleep.
“But wouldn’t it be great,” Sherlock went on, resting his chin on his steepled fingers next to the microphone. “If the number one song this Christmas wasn’t some smug teenager, but an old ex-cocaine addict searching for a comeback at any price? Come Christmas, those young popsters will be half naked throwing back tequila shooters, and I’ll be sitting in some flat with my manager, John,” he nodded towards the door of the booth, “fucking miserable because our fucking gamble didn’t pay off.”
“I doubt it.” Sherlock smirked back; he settled his hands on John’s hips, softly tracing patterns with the pads of his fingers.
“There,” John said, as he spotted a sign on the side of the road. “There’s a guesthouse in this one.”
Sherlock gulped down too much of his coffee, the inside of his mouth burning. “No, I don’t. Sentiment?”
“Call him right now,” Sherlock continued, doing his best to keep a straight face. “He won’t be busy, he can confirm anything you want. Make sure you run
looking annoyed. She got to her feet stared at him evenly, eye to eye. “And I think Sherlock does, too.”
John was panting, fighting the urge to grind against Sherlock’s thigh. “Drunk enough to know that I want this,” he offered, breathless. “You?”
“You don’t have to do this alone, Sherlock.” John laced his fingers with Sherlock’s, breathing him in deeply. “I’m here. I’m still here. I’m here, love, I’m not going anywhere, don’t you see? I’m here, right here, and I still need you, Sherlock, please…”
But Molly had sunk to her knees beside Sherlock and thrown her arms around his shoulders. She was wearing an old tattered cardigan and had several flyaway hairs escaping from her ponytail. Lestrade was unshaven and had on a threadbare t-shirt with a frayed collar poking out from under his jacket.
Everything racing through Sherlock’s mind was reflected back unmistakably in John’s eyes, blue and deep and fathomless as the sea.
He worked slowly these days – his hands seemed heavier than usual at his computer. He only ever stole glances up into the office in front of him a couple times a day now – any more, and he wouldn’t have been able to get anything done at all – but even so, he felt like he was constantly staring into empty space. It was unbearably quiet, and cold, and even his lonely flat seemed like a better alternative now, though he could barely sleep in that room any more, could barely move in it at all without remembering everything in vivid detail, in every cell of his body. And it ached like nothing else before.
John gave a little chuckle, glancing at Sherlock over his shoulder. “You’ve stayed rather close, haven’t you?”
“That’s my address in New York,” John said in a breathy rush. His eyes were staring into Sherlock’s eagerly now. “Write to me?”
It was everything Sherlock could do to tamp down the smile that was threatening to reach all the way to his ears.
Before John even knew what he was doing he had pushed Sherlock up against the wall and was kissing him,
There was a cold, dark chasm in the centre of his chest. Sherlock though his heart must have stopped beating because he couldn’t feel anything there. Nothing but blank shock, and a mounting obstruction in his throat.
Sherlock shook his head, trying to rid himself of that possibility. No, he’d seen John’s face, he’d seen how desperate he’d been to get out of that room. He’d seen what Magnussen was like.
Sherlock thought she looked immensely pleased with herself, and felt an annoyed twinge in his gut at the sight of her striding up the aisle. But then, he supposed he wasn’t exactly the most impartial onlooker here.
“There’s already a link here,” he was saying, breathlessly. “At least three of the emails from Home Office were from people who had hired lawyers out of this firm when Curtis was there. They would have met, probably several times, even if he hadn’t been hired by them directly they might have consulted with him – John?”
It probably wouldn’t work. Every ounce of logic said he’d be back home tomorrow, same as he’d always been.
She side-eyed him, then picked it up and wrapped it around her neck, tossing the longest end around John’s shoulder.
He’d tried to keep his voice light as he said it, but it came out oddly constricted, and John wasn’t surprised in the least when Sherlock stepped up beside him.
“Aren’t…” she seemed to be screwing up her eyes to try to see him better. “Aren’t you the Prime Minister?”
, yes,” Sherlock was whispering between kisses, and he was laughing, and crying, and so was John, and they couldn’t get each other close enough. “Yes, John, yes, of
“You probably think I’m pathetic.” He turned back to the road. “Well, you’re not wrong. Hell, I doubt
Everything after that had been a blur – a gunshot, a shattering of glass, a frantic attempt at escape scrambling over the rocks, and before he knew it a searing blow to the back of his skull, then darkness. Then the water, and the moon.
John grinned a bit more, tilting his head back a bit with a sigh. “I know. You should have seen me after I got shot.”
further of the man who’d already given him everything John could conceivably need, everything Sherlock seemed capable of giving, felt akin to churlishness – like he’d be spitting on everything Sherlock had done for him all this time, degrading it into nothing.
This time, I bring you the story originally featuring the Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) and Natalie, his catering manager (Martine McCutcheon).
Sherlock kissed him, and kissed him, and John kissed him back, delving his tongue in to taste the depths of Sherlock’s emotion, Sherlock offering whatever he had freely. It was dazzling, and Sherlock’s mind was spinning faster than ever even as everything felt suddenly still and calm. The world was alight, and he was here with John, and nothing in all of Britain, in the entire
It had hit him after he’d rushed past John and his friends after class before he could be seen – he’d been shouted at by the teacher for arguing with her about the material again, and his face was still red with anger and embarrassment. He didn’t want that image to be probably the only memory John had of him.
She’d slumped further into the pillows and was scrolling through her mobile phone. “Get out, loser,” she smirked up at him.
Sherlock’s mind slowed to a crawl; he couldn’t believe what he was hearing. He looked once more from Molly to Lestrade and back again, at the incomprehensibly genuine concern in their eyes, and a blaze of earnest affection for them both flared up in his chest.
It was a nice day. The sky was cloudless, the sun shining on the water. A few boats were floating lazily by, propelled by the crisp November breeze.
“I wish I knew what to tell you,” he said. “Sometimes, even the surest cases can respond unpredictably to certain treatments.” He shook his head, seeming dazed. “I suppose you just have phenomenal odds.”
John drew him in for one intense moment, then broke off with a series of smaller, chaste kisses to his lower lip, hoping to urge him forward a little. Sherlock took the hint, and sat back a bit to snap open the bottle and slick his fingers liberally; his eyes never left John’s, something unfathomably tender in them that knocked the remaining breath from John’s lungs.
“Yeah,” John said, a breathless humour in his voice. “She tried to come onto me while we were dancing – you remember – and I told her she was wasting her time, and that I was married.”
“This way,” John whispered, and Sherlock followed him along, having to swallow down his giddy laughter – here he was, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, sneaking into a school concert from backstage like a teenager, holding a cute boy’s hand.
his usual brand of smugness that flowed underneath his words. Only Sherlock would ever be able to detect the difference, but there was a tiny twitch of his eyebrow that gave him away – an almost entirely hidden trace of pride.
“He’s right, John. Best not to rush things, you know. Play it safe.” Molly’s smile was sympathetic, but her voice was even. “You’re lucky you’ve got Sherlock here to look after you.”
But the thought was swiftly silenced as John moved against him with a little gasp, and Sherlock let the sensations wash over him. Maybe this would kill him, but he’d let it. He’d have died over and over again, for this one perfect kiss.
As soon as she was gone, Sherlock pressed his hands hard underneath his eyes, holding back the tide.
The barest ripple of noise spread across the restaurant, then died out. Even the bartender was staring at him expectantly.
“I love you, too.” Sherlock gently took the mug out of John’s faltering fingers and laid it on the table.
“Merry Christmas, John,” he breathed out, jerkily, and John felt another wave of breathless tears rise up in his chest.
Sherlock pressed a long, smiling kiss beneath John’s ear. They stayed there for a long moment, not bothering to move, even as John felt the strength start to flow back into his limbs. There was nowhere in the world that John wanted to be more than here.
“What are you doing here, John?” Sherlock asked, and there was an unbearable current of sadness in his voice. He sounded utterly devoid of spirit, and all at once flashes burst in John’s mind of all the things he’d said, all the ways he’d tried to stop John from leaving. And all the ways John had shot him down with crudities he didn’t believe, letting himself just be swept along in the joke.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and chucked that one away too. The next one was smaller, and less glossy, and had a rather cute cartoonish picture of a snowman in a scarf on the front.
Lestrade was surprised to hear from them, but quickly agreed to let them meet him at a sporting goods shop in Camden that had been broken into without any trace on the CCTV. Fairly mundane, but John felt that familiar thrill anyway all the way there and let himself get lost in it as he poked around the shop and asked all his usual questions, even though he knew Sherlock could have probably solved it at the breakfast table if he hadn’t been humoring him.
“I’m here. I’m here with you, and I’m alright.” John’s voice grew stronger with every word, the truth of them buoying him up. “It’s over now, the danger’s passed, you can let go. Please, Sherlock, let go now.”
“No, I’d – I’d better not.” Sherlock sagged into his seat. It was useless. “The last thing anyone wants is some sleazy politician stealing the kids’ thunder.”
Then he’d been unable to hear anything but Mrs. Hudson making soft shushing noises, and he knew Dad had started to cry.
