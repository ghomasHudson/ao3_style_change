Dean pulls away from the kiss breathlessly, murmuring a thank you against Castiel's lips before he returns home. He feels lighter in his head but heavier in his body, of whose muscles were soaked in the need for sleep.
Monroe grabs him by the sleeves of his shirt and pulls him back up. "We're fighting the devil. They say he lives in LA. We'll start with you, considering you're just as gay as the rest of them."
Another desperate cry. Dean moves in his seat, and his chest rises and falls in a panicked way, as if it was not getting air and getting too much air at the same time. His hands grip the side of the seat tightly.
Sam furrows his eyebrows, the light fading from his eyes. Dean continues quickly.
Castiel's lips twitch into a frown, looking painful as he musters the next few words out of his mouth. "It means transient. Lasting a short while."
Castiel simply hums and stands up. "We should go do sparklers now, like you said."
July 20th, 1986
"I'm coming over. I know you're at Bobby's." John's voice responds in a tense fashion. Dean knows that he's pissed. "You snuck out the damn window? Really? I knew I should have put a damn lock on that thing soon as you turned thirteen."
"That's alright," Dean gives him a short smile. "Hold the sparkler out, and I'm going to light the paper at the very end of it. Then it'll start sparking, and then you can wave it around like a magic wand, okay? That isn't a euphemism."
"Don't talk about my dad." Dean spits out, his tone laced with venom. "And I won't talk about yours."
"Carrots," Jess fills in for him.
“He put me in a spare coffin and buried me under. Told me I had to dig my way out quick, or I was good as dead.” He sighs heavily, and it quivers in the air. “It was cold. And suffocating. And dark.”
Sam grins at him. "That's great! I'm glad you guys had a good time. Right, Dean?"
“I love you,” Cas breathes, and he feels lighter than he’s ever felt in his thousands-of-centuries-long life. He grins brightly and says it again, just to feel the shiver up his spine for a second time. “I love you, Dean Winchester.”
The wind swirls around them, whistling in Dean's ears. It's a quiet evening. It's a quiet town. A quiet, shitty tourist town. It's a beautiful town, one that is blessed with the sun rising every morning. It's a town that is filled with dark corners and tall shadows that hide monsters between the cracks. The waves won't stop crashing. The wind won't stop whistling.
Castiel stands stiffly in the corner, looking like an object set out of a match. He blinks and then raises a hand to greet Jody, giving an awkward smile. "Hello."
(Maybe Dean doesn't want things to go back to normal. Maybe he wants things to go horribly wrong. Maybe the pain of a few punches is worth it to see Castiel's face every day.)
He continues thinking down that path and wonders if they’ve ever seen Castiel really, truly happy, and that’s what finally gets him concerned enough to stand up and walk down to the angel’s room.
•Morning Song, The Lumineers
"Do you always do laundry on the kitchen floor?" Castiel asks, tilting his head to the side as he watches Dean pull out a clean shirt and turn it outside in.
Green eyes flare open, staring up at the white paneled ceiling.
It was all too familiar, once again hanging out in the background, pretending to ignore Dean and Cas's staring contest.
"Dean, I—" Cas tries to pull away, tries to stop it all before it's too late to turn back.
"Well, we can't all be nerds," Dean joked, poking the angel's back with the end of his pool stick.
The quiet was relief enough. It would give him time to begin making sense of this confusing life, time to prove his dad wrong in every way possible, time to listen to the person he trusted, instead of the person he hated.
"Well," Dean shrugged, "looks like we got some more time. Sam hasn't finished with 'research' yet, apparently he couldn't find the book. So much for 'remembering exactly where it is.'"
Cas’s beautiful eyes, his perfect nose, sharp cheekbones, rough stubble, everything.
The thoughts that left him gasping, bent over in a pile of whiskey bottles, pointless prayers screaming ceaselessly through his exhausted mind, until he'd fallen dizzy and unconscious to the floor.
Cas's heartbeat hums, and Dean listens, he does.
Paste that entire thing into this wordhtml.com program. Check everything is working properly by finding a word that should be italicized. It should have a < em > on either side. If you see that, that means it's going to work.
And his smile is slow, and it becomes him, until he feels his chest might not last through this day—
Cas however, couldn't seem to find a single thing wrong with the room. He wandered about curiously, peering into closets and drawers, taking out a miniature bible and flipping vaguely through the pages.
Dean eyed him suspiciously. Maybe talking would help. "so, whaddya think?"
Dean Winchester is saved. Those were the first words he had spoken regarding the Righteous man. And he knew it was likely they would be the last words he ever said, the last thing he ever did.
His jade eyes flicker over Cas’s face, his chest filling with a lightness, a bursting emotion that he can’t quite label, but never wants to stop feeling.
"What if we did?"

Miracle shakes himself off, spraying water over everyone.
She flicked her head in the direction of the jukebox. "You know this song?"
Dean shook his head, amusement filling his chest with a warm lightness, as if he couldn't remember what it was he had been worrying about only a moment before. "Oh, man—" Dean breathed shakily, still recovering. He couldn't remember the last time he'd laughed that hard.
"But you enjoy wearing those clothes?"
Dean frowned at the unfamiliar

, his savior, his almost lover, his living regret.
Charlie took a bite from her slice of pizza, then grabbing a napkin and a nearby pen, began to scribble out a rough schedule. "Okay, so, when do Cas and Dean expect you back by?"
The four of them clink their beers.
Dean had gone shooting around noon, just target practice, and then cooked up a pot of cheap macaroni. Lunch had been quiet. Their father was there, after all.
Dean tries to listen to the story, he really does, especially with Sam being so excited. But something nags at him, something Sam had said, and he can't figure it out until Cas walks into the map room, his hair still mussed from sleep.
kind of free time.
the beginning of the footnote read.
Dean stares down the entity, furious that it would dare stand between himself and his angel, and for the first time since entering the portal, his eyes meet Cas’s still-blue gaze, taking in the angel’s weakened appearance.
"Alright, your turn." Cas raised an eyebrow expectantly, and Dean shrugged, reaching for the meatloaf. Surprisingly, it was better than he'd expected. "Not too bad," Dean grinned. "Needs a little more seasoning, but all in all, I think I made the right choice."
Cas handed him the chalk pads, and Dean placed them back in the equipment slot. "I'm sorry Dean. I wish I could have been there. For you. I didn't know you at the time, of course, but I wish I had."
Dean realized they hadn't decided on any further plans for the evening. There were so many things he wanted Cas to experience. So many things he wanted to
Cas nodded thoughtfully. "If you wish, I could take us to the bunker, and we can assist Sam with the research."
Cas smiled fondly. "Well. She isn't quite technically my daughter, but I understand what you mean. She reminds me of someone I know, actually…"
Cas stares back, not quite knowing what to say, and Dean sighs.
“Nope, guess not, bitch,” Dean grins, and turns to leave before his hopelessly teary-eyed moose brother can try for a sweaty hug.
He snaps back into reality, just as Dean pays, then unlocks their bike.
Cas nodded, and sank, exhausted, into a nearby chair, fingers massaging the bridge of his nose.
"I apologize, Dean, it was not my intention to upset you."
But neither has it been forgotten. The bunker’s one and only key resides under the Leahy family’s watchful eyes, as do mounds of lore and old books which Sam insisted on bringing with him to their new house

Cas ignores the choking sob building inside his throat, ignores the creeping blackness inside his own thoughts, the fuzzy spots collecting inside every blink.
? Or is that too harsh?” Meg’s lips quirk upwards, dark eyes glinting, and Cas flinches back, stung.
"No."
Eventually, the kisses turn softer, gentle and careful, and Dean's mind softens with them, falling into ease. His fingers tangle themselves in the soft locks at the nape of Cas's neck, and as he combs each strand into place, he feels his own thoughts smoothing out too, his own tension, and worries, suddenly all seem so
The Empty shrugs, taking another sip of the golden wine.
, Sam thought hazily before sinking his head into his folded arms,
When he returned from the bathroom, Cas had managed to set up the movie, and was now sitting in the tiny dining chair, happily analyzing the title screen. Dean walked over to the bed that was centered best in front of the TV, and was about to ask Cas to toss him the remote when he realized the angel was looking at him curiously.
"What is a block buster?"
The thoughts resound stronger and and stronger, fading with the beat of his slowing heart and everything is somehow both different, and exactly the same, and it is solid, and pure and peaceful.
When the hunter’s breathing slows, Castiel knows it is time. He sends a surge of grace through Dean's hand, the warm golden light displaying their entwined fingers.
"I—yeah, I guess so," Dean said.
As he leaves the room, he shuts off the light and whispers to the darkness. “Goodnight, Dean.”
Jack in some way, or—" Dean gestures furiously at Sam, who sits innocently at the bunker's map table, seemingly deaf to the ongoing argument.
He stood up, obviously satisfied with himself. "…I believe I just scored a ball on what was

Dean closes his eyes. Tries to block it out. Tries to breathe. Tries not to wish for impossible things, but the wishes come anyway, helpless, hopeless—
It didn't feel quite so cold anymore.

Dean moved onto a new row, and Cas followed, then stood waiting as he watched Dean crouch and dig through a new bin. The label was smudged, but Cas could see a lot of cowboy hats depicted on the covers.
Sam says nothing but rolls his eyes.

"—but, yeah, I'd like that."
Not some fish he could reel in whenever he wanted.
A woman’s face stares coldly down at him from where she sits atop an ebony throne. Cas inhales sharply, recognizing the blonde curls, the smug lips, the leather jacket…
The way they love.
When you love someone, you don't care about their thinning eyebrows, or the way their chin wrinkles into their neck when they smile, or their receding hairline turning gray.
There's another cough in the background. Sam. "Guys."
“Why, hello there, Clarence.”
After what Cas estimated to be about ten minutes, a different worker came through the door holding two plastic bags of food. She smiled cheerfully, handing Cas the bags. "You've got our famous meatloaf, some sweetbreads, and a turducken sandwich. Will that be all then?"
words, they were not even Cas's words.
, and maybe—"
"—you don't have to put that mixtape in your pocket, you could just leave it in the car, if you wanted, I mean."
But Cas still looked nervous, refusing to touch his food, and Dean frowned, sensing deep contemplation.
Dean coughed, but Sam thought he could hear a faint laugh. "well. Glad you're here anyway."
Suddenly, Charlie looked up, all sense of excitement drained from her eyes. "Sam."
"The cashier gave me their ‘famous meatloaf,' some sweetbreads, and a turducken sandwich."

Cas opened his mouth to correct him, but Dean shook his head, laughing, mouth full of food. "Dude, don't get him started."
"No." Dean's face hardens, and he shakes his head, the red anger fading into a chilling glare, and he steps closer to Cas. "No, your
“I am very happy with my progress! Claire says I have ‘mad skills,’”Jack raises finger quotes. “I am... not sure what that means, but I believe she meant it as a compliment.”
Only… it wasn't just Cas. There'd been Lee, obviously. And although Dean had been shoving it off as a mistake, an
Sam nodded, swallowing back a forced smile. "Someday."
Cas's eyes hadn't stopped scanning the room, flickering between Dean's face, their entwined hands, and then back at the wall, the table, the floor, the door.
"He's- he's fine- amazing, actually. Listen, Jody- that's sort of what I'm calling about."
He pulled the blanket over both of them, wrapping his arms around the sobbing angel, and when Cas gripped his hand, Dean didn't wonder if it was a good sign. Cas had given his answer, and if Cas needed a hand to hold to make it through the damage Dean had once again inflicted… then so be it.
Just to
Dean falls silent. What does one say, in a moment like this? Because Cas isn’t talking about the movie anymore.
“Hiya, Cas.” Dean’s jade eyes glint. “Also, what time is it?”
But now, kneeling on the cold stone floor of the dungeon, cradling Dean's bloodied and pierced body, Castiel wished he could go back to the beginning of the footnote, when Dean Winchester had been saved instead of dead.
Cas’s expression changes to something darker. “You…. The Empty stabbed you when we were escaping. I took the knife and cut my grace out. We nearly died.”
But Cas knew he was lying to himself. Denying Dean was never simple. Lying was only slightly less difficult. He'd barely managed it in the past, and that was only because the urgency of their situation required it. Even then, Dean had managed to see through him.
good to see you," she pulled away from the hug and picked up her bags, already starting energetically down the stairs and clamoring all the way. "I realized after our call that I probably shouldn't have mentioned fanfiction or Chuck's books before I saw you in person cause who
Who Dean Winchester really is, and really wants to be, is somebody who apologizes. Somebody who stands on the front porch of their enemy and knocks on their door to support them, because he understands now, and he's been there. (At the end of the day, every broken kid is, at most, the product of a broken parent manipulating puppet strings. Just like Dean. Just like Eli.)
Dean doesn't expect a response now, but for some reason he feels the need to talk to her and tell her what her first son has become. He figures, if Heaven won't strike me down for what I will confess to you tonight, then I may not be so bad after all.
The overload of answers makes Dean unsure how to properly respond; so he doesn't.
Castiel does. Slow and sweet, with everything Dean needs for the entirety of his life. When he pulls away, his eyes are blue like the deep sea, and how badly Dean wants to keep Castiel in his pocket and remember him forever. He was his ocean.
When he gets there, Sam is already sitting on the sand next to Jess. People are lighting sparklers and Roman candles, blasting the new pop music on speakers, sharing food and starting bonfires.
Dean glances over. Families are swimming normally, but the waves are pushing some of them out of the guided flag lines. "They're not in the proper range."
"Here's what I'll do, Dean," Bobby says finally. "I'm going to take some money out of my retirement fund. I can't give much, but Lord knows I might not even live until that point, so it's not like it'll matter much."
"It told me to 'find my adventure.' And a boyfriend," Castiel lists off. "To be honest, I wasn't planning to do either, but you kissed me first."
Sam comes back from the grocery store to find Dean sobbing loudly over the library table, a pencil held limply in his hand as he poured over a book. Not two, not three, but five bottles of beer were on the table beside him. Sam thinks two of them aren’t even fully empty.
"I'm sorry it didn't work out tonight," Jess says sincerely. She stands up and kisses Sam's cheek. "I'll see you tomorrow, Sam."
Dean scoffs lightly, because he honestly can't wrap his head around this. Some not-a-stranger calling him beautiful, nearly unprompted, and he's acting like it was just another thing to say on a normal day, like "hello" or "good evening" or "how was your day?"
"They're good together," Castiel says kindly, a smile gracing his lips.
"Fuck." A sob chokes it's way out of Dean's throat; a strangled and desperate sound that he can no longer help. He buries his forehead into Cas's lap. "Cas."
A red blush blooms on Castiel's cheeks and the end of his nose, and Dean blinks repeatedly because of it. Castiel shakes his head. "Thank you two, that's very kind. I'm glad you're okay, Dean."
"Dean. You deserved to be saved. From all of it. The unfairness. The abuse. The anger." Castiel tilts his head slightly. His eyes could sharpen daggers if they wanted to. "You are more than your weakest link."
"This guy looks like a fairy, so I told him so. God doesn't like people like him."
"What does ABC stand for?" Jody asks randomly.
Sam clears his throat, causing Dean to snap out of his daze. "Uh. Right. This is my brother, Sam. Sam, meet Jody, she's my supercool coach, kind of. And Jody, this is—"
Grief hits Dean like the shore pulling him in. It'll swallow him if he isn't careful, so he makes a move towards the door and leaves before Bobby or Sam can say anything. He thinks of Castiel, who is probably still sound asleep.
"Y'know, I got a vibe from you, but I didn't actually know you had a boyfriend," Charlie nudges his shoulder with a grin. "How long have you two been together?"
Despite the people around him dancing and shouting with glee, drinking bottle after bottle, Dean feels peaceful. He's happy just waiting for Castiel, sitting in the sand quietly and observing everything.
Dean bites back a groan. Of course the town homophobe is Styne's kid. Not that Dean has to worry about it, considering he isn't like any of their targets, but he can't keep defending gay people out on the street. People talk, and that's not what he needs right now.
“Great. Thanks.” Dean stands up from the table and stretches his arms up with a yawn. “Night.”
Castiel is staring at him, Dean can see. He's narrowing his eyes and scanning over his face. His expression softens after a moment. "You should go home and rest. I can foot the bill for the coffee."
Dean clicks the phone back onto the receiver and ignores how badly his hands are shaking. When he looks back up at Bobby, the man looks proud. And as if that isn't enough, Bobby tells him himself.
That's how it began, really. Months of training and Dean was now on his first day— the beginning of June came quick, and the cheap tourists came flooding in just as the heat did.
At some point during the evening, Dean convinced Cas to stay the night.
He grows to understand why humans are picky with the nutrients they consume. (Dean told him, as he pushed away vegetables on his plate and stuffed his face with more of his burger, that it was because some foods were not as good as others, and that ‘good’ can mean more than healthy.)
"I think you two would have gotten along great," Dean says. "Really, I believe that. Mom liked to think before she talked. She was thoughtful and stuff like you were."
Dean waves him off and disappears into his bedroom. His bed is more comforting now than ever, and he collapses on it heavily, letting his body weight sink into the mattress. He can clearly see the jar sitting on his desk.
•Are You Lonesome Tonight?, Elvis Presley
•Wonderful! Wonderful!, Johnny Mathis
Dean struggles against the air for a moment and then his eyes flash open, awaking with another shaky gasp. His gaze is everywhere, traveling quickly around his surroundings until they finally meet Cas.
Jody nods. "Gotcha."
And yet, here Dean was, asking, pleading for help, vulnerable and desperate to the only person that he believes won't judge him for it.
"Dean, you have always supported Sam," Castiel reminds softly. "He loves you. You're his brother, and you've always been there for him. That's why you're raising money for him to go to college, isn't it? Do you care about him?"
Bobby doesn't even seem to bat an eyelash, immediately looking up to Castiel instead. "Cas, then? Nice to meet you."
He picks up one of them and flips through it himself. A great deal of it is a dialect that he doesn't care to analyze, mainly because it all falls on a thin tightrope of a line that extends between manipulation and persuasion—Which seems more like a sewing thread than a rope.
The woman finally gives a gargled gasp and she sits up, letting herself cough up water onto the sand next to her. Dean feels a wave of relief and then quickly assesses the rest of her body, noticing a slice on her arm and scrapes up and down her leg. He opens the first aid kit. "Hey, stay with me. What's your name?"
But he’d smile nonetheless, because he was more content than ever, looking up at—
"Kiss me."
Looking at him again, with his piercing eyes and his plump but chapped pale lips, strong cheekbones, stubble—even his unruly dark hair was sticking up in all directions and twisted in such a way that it made it look like a halo. And he thinks that, no, there was no way that this man was capable of any ill intent. It was almost as if somebody whispered in his ear that Castiel had a good heart.
Obviously, this didn't sit well with Dean, and he was rushing forward immediately. He yanks the guy away from the kid and shoves him to the side. "I can't believe I'm saying this, considering you're the size of a fucking twig, but why don't you pick on someone your own size?"
"What do you think it is?" Dean asks, still studying Sam for any sort of negative response. There isn't one, yet.
But that isn't what he really said. Instead, Dean implied to Sam that night that his big dream of helping people was stupid. "Lame." And while Sam had stormed out of the house in a smokescreen of hurt, Dean was collecting every dollar he could find in his room to put in a mason jar taped with the label "Sam's Getaway".
"I—" Dean's mind struggles to think past anything other than John, but he untangles the knots in his head enough to remember Bobby. "I've got a place. We should move quick, though."
"Do you think it would help relax you more to get out of the house? We could go down to that diner," Castiel suggests thoughtfully. "I'm sure they have coffee or something, if you don't want to go to sleep."
The woman pulls her hair behind her ear in a frantic motion and gestures to a portion of the water. "You have to save her, please, hurry!"
"We played Skee Ball for a while," Castiel says with a solemn nod. The sincerity lessens into a pleased smile. "And then we went on the Ferris Wheel. It was... very fun. I saw the sun set."
"I'll take care of him, Mama. Just like you said, I'll be the best big brother. I promise."
Nearly an hour went by and they finally arrived. Dean put the Impala in park, taking the keys out of the ignition and looking over to Cas as he waited for his reaction. Castiel furrowed his eyebrows, taking in the old barn that they stopped in front of.
Chimney managed to not say a single word to Dean, though that involved avoiding him for most of the time. That rose many more questions from Dean, and the crew had to come up with every lie they could think of. Every lie they’re certain Dean has ever heard.
"It can't take you. I won't let it. I-I can stop it. If I just-"
“Pushing it up is also risky.” Dean chimes in from the radio. He would yell, but he didn’t want to scare the kid. “If we lift the car, it pushes the wall into the ceiling which could also cause everything to collapse on top of us.”
Sam and Dean were laid out on the grassy field, only a few feet apart. The slight gust of wind passing through the atmosphere and across their sweat and blood covered skin. Both of them groaned as they shifted, their bodies aching with every slow movement they made in order to get up. Castiel was further away; closer to the nephilim who stood tall above the three men. He too, felt aches and pains in every movement he made, but he sat up to look around. He saw the sun shining bright on the earth, a sign of peace. It was something you see in a movie and it brought a soft smile to the angel's lips...then that same smile grew once he saw his son standing in front of him. Jack had stood there, facing the distance in front of him and drew a deep breath as he took in the peaceful nature. Sun rays hitting his skin, closing his eyes to soak it all in.
“No, me and my friends are gonna get you out of here okay?” Dean’s voice was muffled because of the mask. He takes off his helmet first, placing it on the ground and removing his mask to put it on the little boy. “Here, this is gonna help you breathe better.” He carefully lifts the boy's head to put the mask on him. “No more funky smell.” Dean gave a soft smile and the boy nodded as he took a deep breath. “Running out of time here y’all.” He tries to whisper into the radio.
“C’mon superman, in you go.” Chimney teases as he steps up into the ambulance with Dean.
”Okay, let’s go.” Sam grabbed the keys to the Impala from the other table and headed up the stairs with Jack following. He smiled as he thought about the two he was leaving behind, knowing that his big brother finally found where his happiness lies and who it lies with. After everything they had gone through, the way he was raised, Sam knew Dean deserved this.
“Dean’s birthday is in two days.” Eddie mentions, which doesn’t help with the amount of pressure everyone is feeling already. They all wanted it to be perfect, make it special for Dean since he didn’t have the best experience back home. “Did you guys ask his brother?”
“We just don’t want to do the wrong thing Cap, life here has...brightened up since Dean got here.” Hen admits, and the boys nod in agreement. “We’d hate to see him go so soon.” Bobby stood for a moment as he took in those words, words of truth. Hen wasn’t wrong, the 118 had gotten this sort of
“Better?” The Winchester looked up, smiling at how casual Cas looked.
”Yeah,” Sam chuckled as he opened the bunker door. “Yes they are.” Jack hesitantly smiled, but walked out anyway to walk to the Impala. “Couldn’t be better.” Sam whispered to himself, locking up and following the nephilim to the car.
“I agree.” Cas whispered, cupping Dean’s face to pull him into another soft, but passionate kiss. The question still remained how Dean was able to see Castiel’s wings, but as of right now that didn’t matter. The moment was about them, what they shared, the closeness and their feelings. It was just them. That’s all that mattered.
“Dean what are you…”
"Is Chuck not...?" Sam asked, trying to find out as much as he could from Castiel and Jack who had clearly known something that he and Dean didn't. Castiel looked at the brothers and smiled at them sadly.
“Well, good luck cause you might have a concussion.” Dean groaned knowing where he’d be going. “Did you not expect to have anything after a damn house fell on you?” A small chuckle left Dean’s lips and Hen rolled her eyes and smiled. “You’re alive, that’s what matters.” He nodded, sitting on the edge of the ambulance as Hen started to check his breathing and hooking him up to oxygen.
“Sorry, I just wanted to drop off a gift from me and Donna.” Her smile was beaming as if it were the sun. It showed Maddie and Buck how long they waited to celebrate this special day for Dean.
“You know what, that could work.” Hen says.“We could even take Dean gift shopping and trick him into thinking it’s for Chris.”
Dean was upstairs at the dining table, scrolling through his phone while the rest of the team was hiding in front of the fire engine to discuss the events happening in two days. “All good, he’s occupied.” Hen says, rejoining the secret meeting.
“Yeah? What’s her name?”
“Keeping.” Eddie says. “We’re throwing him a surprise birthday party in two days. Buck’s been stashing decorations at your place and we’ve all come up with a plan to tell him about the party if he asks again.”
“No, no, this...this is great. It’s better.” Dean looked over Castiel’s face, taking in the smallest details he never noticed before. How truly bright his blue eyes were, the small scar on his upper lip — probably his vessel’s doing before Cas took over. How rosy his cheeks would get when he would get flustered and shy. Dean sighed contently, moving a hand to gently go over his wing once more. “This, this is gonna be great.” Cas chuckled, wrapping his wings a bit tighter around Dean which gave him an odd feeling of safety. If he were honest, it was the safest he’s ever felt.
“That means we better hurry,” Dean pauses for a moment to speak into his radio. “Cap, there’s a kid underneath the car. No older than 7, he’s pinned pretty good.” Bobby cursed under his breath.
“And if we’re wrong?” Buck asks out of curiosity.
“Andy, okay. Keep talking to me buddy, do you have any siblings?” Andy nods slowly as he tries his hardest to keep his eyes open.
“You didn’t expect me not to? A man- sorry, an
“Yep.” Hen says as she walks up the stairs. “He sounded very excited to be doing this.” Everyone raised their eyebrows and sighed.
“Let’s go.” Bobby tells the driver, putting on his headset like everyone else. The engine started, the sirens were blaring. Whatever happened must have been serious.
“Bobby,” Buck stands up straight with a cocky smile earning a silent ‘oh boy’ from Eddie and Hen. “When you take a man into a store, he finds things he likes. Trust me.” Before Bobby could speak, Eddie jumped in on the conversation.
“You know what I’m about to say don’t you?” Dean removed the oxygen mask with a sarcastic smile.
“The last time someone touched my wings, it was in Heaven — my garrison, but it was never gentle. It was painful, especially when they were injured, but…”
”They’re okay, trust me.” Jack furrowed his eyebrows at Sam’s statement. “Why don’t we get out of here for a bit? Maybe get some food or look for more computer games?” The boy’s eyes lit up with excitement.
“How fast can you be?” Buck asks.
Dean wrapped an arm around him, pulling him closer to his body and once again closing all the space between them as he rubbed his hand up and down his back. Every so often drawing small circles on his shoulder blades. Cas was still a little tense, never having done something like this, fearing he wasn’t going to be able to sleep and disturb Dean. “Hey, it’s okay. Relax.” He stopped his movements, his hand resting on Cas’s shoulder. “I’ll be right here, all night, okay?” Dean moves his other hand to lift up Castiel’s face. “You wake me up if you need me.” Cas nodded, finally relaxing his body, allowing himself to snuggle closer to Dean and his head snuggled into his chest. His hand resting on Dean’s ribs, a thumb softly running back and forth; the smell of detergent filling his nose, calming Cas even more. His breathing started to slow and steady, eyes growing heavy. The feeling of security, love, it all filled him.
“We could say we’re planning a surprise baby shower for Maddie?” Eddie offers. “It’s believable.”
“Buck! What’s wrong?” Cas jumps out from his desk and steps towards his boyfriend’s friend.
It’s been a week, Castiel was human now. The angels had fallen, he’d been on the run and Dean had just found him. Getting him settled in the bunker, helping him adjust to his new way of life; Cas couldn’t help but feel useless to the Winchesters. Getting hurt in hunts, asking the wrong questions, struggling to do the basic things. Sam had tried his best to assure him that Cas was doing good, that he and Dean were more than happy to have him around...but it just flew right past his head. Nights were always so difficult for the former angel. Not knowing how to relax himself so much to the point where he could fall asleep; staying up all night or getting at least five minutes of sleep. It was only then that Cas started to grow frustrated with his lack of knowledge on being human.
“We should get the rest of the gifts.” Cas says, trying not to laugh.
“Am I gonna…” The boy started to speak and Dean looked down at him softly. “Am I gonna die?” Dean felt his heart stop, going back to the time Jack cut his head open and saw all the blood and he asked the same question.
“Can you get her out?” Bobby asks.
“Good, maybe you can pick up an extra shift.” He joked and Dean shakes his head with a smile.
“Buck wanted to.” Jack says with a smile, his dirty blonde hair covering his blue eyes.
“Shut up Chimney.” They both laugh and sit in a comfortable silence on their way to the hospital.
“You do remember stabbing me with a demon blade to the chest, right?”
Cas shakes his head, “No, this was all Buck’s idea.”
“Happy birthday.” They all say in unison. Dean starts laughing nervously, not sure what to do in this situation — until his eyes land on Cas. Everyone was here. Buck, Jody, Donna, Maddie, Claire, Jack, Alex, Kelly, Eileen, Sam.
“Kinda defeats the whole purpose of the surprise.” They share a look and Hen wishes Dean were here to see so she could tease the two men with him. “What about Christopher? That could work.” He looks at everyone to see if they would agree, and it looked like they were on the verge.
“If we break the wall, the whole house will collapse.” Chimney says, noticing that this wall is the only thing keeping the front of the house standing.
“Mm, maybe move it down a bit on the left.” Cas starts climbing the ladder on the left side and adjusts the banner.
”Okay.” He cleared his throat, adjusting his position on the chair and straightening his shoulders. “Listenin’ to yesterday,” Dean began singing softly, his fingers moving along the guitar strings to hit every note perfectly. “Long before the way it has become. it all came down to you,” Cas couldn’t help the smile that appeared on his face, smile being so big it pained his red tinted cheeks.
“Sam?” Jack spoke, bringing the youngest Winchester out from his thoughts. “Is everything okay?”
“I have a family.”
The barn. Where they first met. Castiel blinked, turning around to face the man who summoned him all those years ago. “Why did you bring me here?” Dean shrugged, nudging the trench coat wearing angel with his elbow before getting out of the car. Cas did the same, watching as Dean pushed the barn doors open and stepped inside to see all the warding he and Bobby did. Most of it fading away, the ones on the floor all scratched up. He laughed at himself, wondering what the hell he was thinking using all of this when it was so pointless. “Using all the wrong warding, such a Dean Winchester thing to do.” Cas said sarcastically earning a laugh from the man who observed the place.
“Cap, I’ve known that man longer than any of you. No he can’t.” Hen says as she crosses her arms over her chest.
“My bad, I was just talking with my old man.” Dean’s tone seemed to drop when he mentioned it and it didn’t go unnoticed by his friends.
"Wh- time? Cas, what are you talking about? What time?" It was Dean's turn to become frantic. Fear flowing quickly through his veins, but he didn't move from his position. Not when this could possibly be the last time he would feel the angel's touch. "Talk to me, Castiel. Please." His voice was barely above a whisper, cracking at the full name of the angel. Dean's bottom lip quivered in fear as his green eyes filled with tears. Still, no word was said from the angel that stood in front of him. Instead, Castiel placed another hand on the other side of Dean's face, pulling his head down to his lips to place a gentle, lingering kiss to his forehead. Finally letting his own tears fall.
“Why can’t I stay home by myself? Claire gets to.” Cas chuckles, putting a hand on Jack’s shoulder.
“If Dean happens to ask...again, the party we’re setting up is for Eddie’s son, Christopher. Hen said it would be a good idea to take him shopping to see if he’d like anything while pretending to shop for Chris.” Buck explains and Cas smiles at the plan while Alex stares confused.
“Agh, my children.” Dean says as he wraps them up in his arms and kisses both of their heads. “D’you guys plan this too?”
Everyone still laughed at it. The moment brought deja vu for Dean when he was back home. He smiled, remembering that it was the first time he ever heard Sam laugh. Before long, Hen got a text message and Dean noticed her sudden change in attitude. “Hen? Everything okay?” She ignored him, leaning forward to speak to Bobby.
“What if we tried removing the car? We could get something else to replace the weight so the wall won’t fall.” Eddie offers.
“Okay. Cas. Good human etiquette is to
Fortunately, Dean found something else to concentrate on, because Cas's form was absolutely atrocious. Unfortunately, that
but they seemed real."
It was Dean. Stark naked.
"Okay, so—come here—the first thing you have to do, like I just showed you, is you gotta rub the smaller end of your cue stick with a chalk pad." He gave Cas a sage look, and nodded as the angel followed his instructions. "Gives it more friction, see—so the tip doesn't slide off the cue ball as easily. More chalk, less slip. Plus, it helps give the cue ball a bit of a spin."
"I don't know—Hey! Rowena. Uh—what's up?" Sam tried to sound casual, hoping Dean and Cas couldn't hear the voice on the other end. He turned the volume down as low as possible.
He sighed. "I better get back over there." He slid back the barstool, and reached to collect the shot-trays, but Taylor's hand touched his wrist, and he looked up to see her smirking.
Perhaps not.
Forgetting all about nature’s call, Cas bends down to pick the pages up. They’re at least several years old, some older than others, but all of them are creased and worn in a way that suggests constant revisits and readings, and one of the notes has been crumpled to such a degree Cas wonders if it had been rescued from the garbage and re-flattened.
“You mean the one you’re working on for Cas and I, right?” Dean says with mock-innocence. “Remind me— what does it look like again?”
Cas shouldn't have said those things. He shouldn't have said any of the things he'd said, because it was all
, instead of just his own weirdly-patterned bed. He'd felt at home almost immediately, although it took Sam a while to stop considering the bunker as 'temporary.'
It’s temporary and confusing and there seems to be nothing but chaos— but not all bad comes from it.”
Lee had been the only real hunter friend he'd ever had, back then. And look what that had gotten him.
Putting on what he hoped was a vaguely tired and bored expression, void of any ulterior motives, Sam glanced at Cas. The angel was still staring at Dean, as if trying to communicate telepathically. Sam coughed, and Cas turned towards him with a grudging look.
In that moment of decision, Castiel remembered the footnote.
Sam uncovers it. “Can we eat now? I’m starving. Jody, are you going to stay?” he asks.
Dean pulls it a little tighter around him. “Th-Thanks, Cas.”
The empty gestures at the portal, its black shadowed limbs reflecting the golden glow. “This—all of this. All mine. My little
“But Dean…”
“Oh, well if that’s all then.” Dean lets go of the shirt, and grimaces, wiping his hand on his jeans. “I’ve got the stuff in my trunk.”
"You're not supposed to be in here. It's summer vacation."
“Ehh, let me shower first. Swamp gunk is super freaking disgusting.” Charlie says.
Dean bit his lip, staring at the image of Cas's coat placed on the same chair as his cargo jackets.
But now… maybe some small part of him, stronger than the rest, had always wanted Cas to speak up about his feelings. Maybe he was curious, and wishing, to know that Cas felt..
“—that
The words flashed through Sam's mind, but they were not a statement. It had been a question for a
I HAVE A BETA READER! jupiticas, you've been absolutely AWESOME. And I can't wait to continue working on this fic with you. It's been so fricking fun, thank you for all your spot-on tips and suggestions :)
And then after a few unanswered rings, Cas’s voice came out from the phone, and Dean had almost stopped breathing, for a second, he thought Cas was back, in the motel room. And he was saying something so stupid, so damn stupid, and Dean could practically see the confused head-tilt, the frowning, adorable look that he’d learned to love, somewhere along the way.
Sam tried to take an academic approach to these lists, because he knew if he really analyzed what he'd been doing for the past several hours, it wouldn't be too out of line to label himself as an 'invasive pervert.'
It meant lying in bed, in the dark, eyes turned unblinkingly to the chair in the corner, and wishing he'd asked Cas to stay, just one more time. Wishing he'd asked him something else, too.
Sam laughed. "Seriously Dean? And where has
Dean felt no breath enter his lungs, wondered if maybe some merciful being had taken pity on his existence, and decided to grant his wish.
Cas told him one night before they went to sleep.
It was written across every inch of Dean's expression.
So, he decides to try his best.
Cas's compliments are poetry, and Dean's… well, the few times he's tried, it usually comes out sounding like a cheap pick-up line, so cheesy even Dean can feel his brain cringe at the memories.
Dean sighed. "Well there's another one for the list."
The slice had been hasty, and he could feel that it was perhaps a bit too deep. He was human now. A wound like that could be fatal.
before you enter a room. Or, even better, knock, wait, see if the person behind the door says yes or no,
“I…” Cas croaks.
Sam checked over the excerpts he'd copied and pasted into a document. These being especially long sections, he'd initially skimmed over the details in order to move on, but even a quick glance had convinced Sam that these particular bits were important enough to put aside for in-depth analysis. The first excerpt started on Valentine's day, 2010. The day they'd killed Famine.
"Did you receive the spell I sent you?"
Dean muses.
Groaning, Sam tossed their duffle bags into the back seat, then gave Dean a look over the top of the impala that he hoped meant 'I've heard this a thousand times would you please shut up.'
Until then….
So yeah, he considered it. And then he considered it too much. Maybe a little more than he should have. Singing the lyrics of one of his favorite songs, he allowed himself to imagine Cas's face in his mind, see the dark slanting blue irises and the raven sex-hair. He could smell the rainstorm scent of the trench coat, that damn trench coat… his hands clenched as he remembered how it felt to stand so close to the angel, sharing breaths, waiting to see who would break the connection first. It was electric, paralyzing, staring into the eyes of Cas, an actual 'angel of the lord,' as he had said so long ago.
"I just—I guess I've just been thinking—"
After politely questioning the agitated motel owner, he discovered that Sam and Dean, the customers from room 7, were indeed out for the day, and had apparently headed into town, wearing suits, and "talkin' about some weird crap: murders and such." Castiel tipped the owner generously for this information, which he knew was not necessary, but it seemed to brighten the man's countenance considerably, and Castiel retreated to room 7 to wait for the Winchesters' return.
I just learned how to convert my italic text to HTML script!
The kid was born to create.
"I forgive you Dean. I did a long time ago."
"You'll find someone, Sammy," Dean had said as he'd helped pack the car. "Some badass person with really

killed him, if only to save him from what came next.
He tries again, but feels a sharpness in his throat, and his heart pounds. The words won't come out. Cas blinks over at him, a soft smile, but Dean can only swallow.
Well, so here we are. The end.
Dean dreaded it. Turning over. Seeing Cas's face. He wanted nothing more than to just stop existing. That would be simplest. Easier for everyone.
Dean slides out of bed, face tense. “Cas? What’s wrong? Are you crying?” He’s at his bondmate’s side in seconds, a warm hand on Cas’s shoulder.
I can't thank you all enough, for your meaningful, thoughtful comments. You're the reason this fic is still going, the reason I've reached OVER 50K WORDS. It's more than I ever thought possible, and it exists because of you guys. And jupiticas, seriously, you've made me smile so much this past week, you've made me so very happy, and your comments, and your notes, and your reaction videos: you've made me happier than I've been in a long time, so thank you.
"I had to," Cas continued, ignoring Dean's reaction. "In order to piece you back together. Memories are perhaps the most vital element to any human's personality and soul."
"uh—" dean snapped his fingers—"California. And we thought that was weird because usually vamps prefer the less populated, shadier areas, with lots of abandoned warehouses and all that crap."
back. Cas
The empty had taken everything once before.
Sam bit his cheek, desperately praying Dean couldn't hear. "Yes, we're going on a hunt. Vamps in California."
The lamp, so easily repaired by Castiel's own hands just the night before, now lay once again in broken shards upon the carpet. Dean saw now, the rainbow-colored swirls of stained-glass that made up the body of the lamp, their iridescent colors glinting sharply in the cast morning light.
it tastes like warmth and pancakes and—
Cas wants so badly, to kiss the man he loves, to lean over and finally…
Cas brought out the tape again, tracing the handwritten label:
Cas stood up and for a moment they simply stared, dean slightly open-mouthed. Sam mumbled behind him about 'hurrying his ass through the damn door already,' and Dean looked down, walking inside.
“Ah—this is Liv. She’s your- nurse,” Cas stammers out, sitting back in his chair, and Dean is amused to see a faint blush rising on the once-angel’s cheeks. He smirks.
"No." Cas pointedly ignored the assumption that his company would be female. It didn’t truly matter. "Dean does better when he has a stimulating topic of conversation to distract him from his worries. I need something that will be…
------------------------------
“Oh…” Dean frowns, trying to remember. “No, then, I guess not. They probably don’t drool in their sleep though.”
Dean melts into his touch, his chest calming. Cas tries to take this as a good sign. Tries to continue.
"Yeah." Dean dropped a ball into the nearest corner pocket. "When you succeed in hitting a ball into a pocket."
Cas already knows what his happiness is. He’s aware Dean is part of it.
Either the guy doesn't find this amusing, or he didn't know how to tell a joke from an insult. Janitor boy simply continues squinting at Dean with that strange expression of lofty suspicion.
Dean's excuse had always been
Dean looks down at the two rings in his palm. One, silver with glimmering blue enochian glyphs: a true gift, holding a reminder of everything Cas had given up
TRIGGER WARNING:
Apparently, his younger brother is also blessed with superhuman hearing abilities, because he turns around just as Dean is about to sneak out again. “So,” Sam smirks, leaning against the fridge door.
He hears the shout. Feels hands clasping his face. But nothing hurts. It’s all just so…
Sam turns around, a panicked expression on his face, and he snaps the phone closed, joining Charlie at his brother’s side. “An ambulance is on its way but it’s a long drive— we’re going to meet them halfway, so I need you to go move the car from the garage out to the front of the road.” His voice is firm and leveled, but Cas can hear a barely controlled edge of hysteria in the younger Winchester’s breaths.
Cas could sense the sarcasm. The anger. And underneath it all, he thought he could sense a deep hurt, an ache that matched his own.
Dean pops the cassette in the player, and gently eases one of the earbuds in Cas’s ear, then his own.
Cas shook his head slowly, "he was here Dean. I greeted him briefly, then I came to talk to you. He was there, by the desk."
They weren't sentimental people. But sometimes, when everything else went to shit, it was nice to have something concrete, something to solve and fix and repair when it seemed they couldn't fix anything else.
Cas slid gracefully into the seat opposite of Dean, adamantly refusing to return Dean's stolen glance.
For the first time, Sam sees the deep wound inside his brother’s abdomen, gushing a dark stream onto the dungeon floor, Charlie’s small, shaking hand pressed up against Dean’s stomach trying desperately to stem the flow.
"uh-huh." Dean obviously wasn't buying it, but thankfully, he didn't pry into the matter further.
than…I want you to stay. I need you to stay. I just. Wanted you to know that."
be adorable, if he didn't look so frickin terrified.
Cas says that night, an arm curled around Dean’s body, a whisper in the dark. And this is an unexpected happiness.
Dean folds his legs beneath him, and leans back with the air of someone who has no doubts as to the legality of their situation. "What does it
Charlie winces, blinking back the flow of tears as Dean’s chest collapses into another fit of wet coughs. “SAM—you gotta hurry up, it’s not good—”
“Come on, honey. It would be rude.” Cas murmurs. “They came all this way.”
He glanced quickly down and threw out his usual answer. "Fine, man. I'm great."
Dean thinks. But he can't say it. Not out loud. Not like Sam could.
Dean turns away, and Cas stands silently, holding back the tidal wave of toxic memories. Because as much as it hurts, being Dean's friend, still he wants more.
And of course, Cas had called a couple hours before, updating Dean on his progress with heaven's angels. Things were apparently going well, and he had promised Dean a visit to talk in person.
type. So after several hours of listening to the grouchy artisan complain about everything from knee joints to diamond cutters, Dean had been just about ready to knife the guy, despite their deal.
Nodding, Cas meets his gaze, and Dean wonders if he’ll ever get tired of their color. No color is worthy of describing Cas… but blue, well.
to remember you?”
But this time, he wasn't here to drink. He was here for Cas. And Cas was….
Heaven's duties had kept Cas away from the bunker for over a week, and as per usual, Dean had decided to skip the warm welcome, and alleviate his frustration through loud, argumentative accusations.
Gingerly, Dean knelt down to collect the pieces. He couldn't repair the lamp like Cas could, but leaving the shards on the floor was unsafe. He picked up the larger fragments, and almost tossed them in the trashcan when he saw it—
When Dean finishes reading, Cas has moved from his position on the floor, and now stands only inches away, one hand outstretched.

Once he’s catalogued the highlights of his current stash of books, Sam restocks with the next shelf, visiting Claire and Kaia on the way to and from the bunker.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Without hesitation, Cas stepped quickly in the direction of the bathroom door, and reached for the warm door handle. The angel could sense a movement behind him, and a weak
Dean spits a mouthful of coffee back into his mug. Too hot. He couldn’t have swallowed it anyway if he tried.
favorite, Dean?"
And then John had stormed in, and Sam remembered the look on Dean's face, the horrible fear, the kind of fear he never thought he'd see in his older brother's eyes. Even in the low light, he remembered seeing Dean's shaking hands, a bloody smear stretching across the length of one finger, matching perfectly the smear on his terrified face.
Dean nodded.
Dammit, Sam," Dean muttered.
Cas squinted suspiciously at the fork in front of his face, and Dean chuckled. "It won't bite, buddy."
he’d felt, no—a
Dean shook himself out of his thoughts. Thinking like that never did any good. He returned his focus to the bartender, who was squinting at him in concern.
He walked back over to the car, and slid into the front seat. Cas gave him a questioning look.
"You deserved better, when you fell, and I just kicked you out without even a pair of extra clothes, or even a credit card, and I…"
“They are cold. Unfeeling.” Cas stares off into the lamp. “Unfathomable to you, I cannot adequately describe them, or their true forms. What was once
Wow. Sam took a deep breath. He felt more exhausted than he had in a long time. But he couldn't stop now, not when things were really starting to make sense. That Valentine's day had always bothered him. Besides the whole demon blood thing, obviously.
“Hey, stop stealing all my best lines!” Dean laughs, and when Cas grins, it's the most beautiful thing Dean has ever seen.
Sam's shoulders stiffened a bit at the memory. His dad had been… particularly frustrated during that job, and he took it out in petty arguments with Sam. Dean, the big brother as always, usually attempted to protect Sam from John's wrath, most often ending up on the receiving end of their father's fists. It wasn't the first time Dean had taken the fall for his little brother, and it hadn't been the last, not by a long shot.
“Bondmates, huh?”
This one was GOING to be funny... and then I went and made it painful. Sorry, not sorry. Heh.
This is just the end of the beginning.
"Hell yes," Dean assured him seriously, and Cas carefully placed the bottle back in its holder, smoothed out his trenchcoat and fiddled with the napkin in front of him. Was the angel…. nervous?
Dean can feel Cas's amused smile and almost knows what his angel is going to say before the words are spoken.
“Dean, please, I need you to stop,” Cas says thickly.
“Cas, what happened—”
Cas flicked his gaze to the hunter.
“Yes,” Cas replies, walking into the room with a smile. He places a warm kiss to Dean’s cheek, smelling suspiciously of raw onions and—
Dean's heart still hadn't stopped pounding. He'd stood frozen, leaning against the car for what felt like hours, agonizing over Cas's words. Wondering. Wishing the angel had been just a little more clear. Why couldn't the dumbass just say something he could actually understand for once? Why did it all have to be poetry and eloquent speeches?
"YES, really."
Charlie carefully extracts the hastily-shoved, crinkled, pages from under the mattress.
Their faces were too close, and Dean wasn't ready. Not yet. Maybe soon. He gently pried his fingers away from Cas's hand, swallowing down his own self-disappointment, and headed to the bathroom to wash his face.
Sam finished his reading, and glanced over his shoulder at Dean and Cas, who looked mostly confused.
. I don't think Dean can talk to you right now."
moment lacks true happiness… he feels it in his gut, the familiar
In truth, Castiel wanted nothing more, and dreaded nothing more, than to join Dean Winchester in the impala.
"Oh." Cas paused, considering. "I don't… honestly know. I've never really had a chance to discover my smaller interests. I like.. Bees, of course. And—"
"Cas, it's the least I can do."
that someone like you could care for me.”
The breeze whipped through Cas's half-cracked open window as Dean drove back to the motel. The sun finished setting while they were paying for the movies, and now all that was left was the purple blue of evening, a slight tinge of orange resting on the horizon's brink. Dean could see snatches of it between the spaces of the blurred buildings.
Dean couldn't even have bothered to find Cas a place to
“Let’s get this son of a bitch and find a way to bring him home.”
This desire to wake up, to live, to do, to be, the knowledge that your existence is ahead of you, that all you have to do is live with the person you live for, and the goosebumps start to race, and oh how beautiful it is, to even just exist.
“Heh. See— that’s funny.” With a lurch forward, Dean wraps a hand around the man’s oily white t-shirt, and pulls him close.
"Where's uh— where's Eileen? She's okay right?"
And sometimes he slept, but it felt more like half dreaming, half wakeful loneliness, until he couldn't tell the difference between his dream-Deans and his thought-Deans. One time, Dean told him "
that he was subconsciously exaggerating every nuance in the angel's behavior, every touch, every longing glance…
“Let’s get married.”
He felt physically sick.
"You better."
Sam and Charlie stand back from the danger-zone, hands covering their ears, trying to block out the angry, inhuman shrieks pouring forth from inside the blackness
But Cas wouldn't want that. His reply was proof.

Just another method of torture, another poisoned illusion: just like the Empty had said.

think?
A squint. A head tilt.
"Hmm. Well, first of all Dean Winchester, stop telling yourself you sound stupid when you give the guy a compliment. That's helping nobody.
“Cas, will you marry me?”
Cas kept his hand in its place. "Dean I can fix the lamp easily, that's not what I'm worried about."
“I know the feeling,” Cas nods. “But it's okay to be scared, Dean. This… right here. You and me. There's nothing standing in our way anymore. We can have this.”
"Please, Dean, let's not talk about Meg."
“Oh shut your sweaty face, Exercise Boy,” Dean retorts, turning towards the coffee maker to hide his own smile. It’s hard to act properly inflicted with a case of morning-agitation when all he can think about is Cas’s face, and hearing those filthy words escape the once angel’s mouth, mixed in with poetry the likes of which Dean had never heard, which is saying a lot, considering Cas is always spouting sappy shit, and
Dean had looked. The horror. The disgust.
This fic was the beginning of everything. Blu, my awesome, talented, hilarious, beautiful friend: you mean so goddamn much to me, and I can't wait to keep writing with you, to keep talking with you.
that's what Charlie had said once. Dean feels the corners of his lips lifting and he shakes his head, amused at the memory.
Seven months after the deal.
Cas, in every sense of the word, but whether he liked it or not, the damn thoughts were popping up everywhere, and maybe Cas felt the same, maybe a week from now, they'd be
Rolling his eyes, Sam straightened up and flipped his laptop shut. Cas was staring after Dean, looking almost… regretful.
I hope you enjoy it anyway, and leave a comment! Even if your comment consists of jibberish-fangirl-keyboard-bashing, cause honestly, I CAN RELATE TO THAT SHIT.
Red was the color of his life when Cas wasn’t there to paint over it with blue.
Leaning in, Cas presses a tender kiss to Dean’s forehead. His lips are warm, and full of life, and Dean softens beneath the once-angel’s touch, feeling his clenched chest finally relax.
Dean presses a kiss to his angel’s lips, and his heart flutters furiously as he feels Cas grab hold of his wrist. Shaking breaths mingle in the small space between them, and it’s far too much distance, far too much air.
Hi! I SWEAR THIS WILL BE THE LAST TIME I CHANGE MY NAME I WAS HAVING A NAME CRISIS but hiii it's Blu!! Sorry to keep you guys waiting and it's a short chapter but it seemed right to end it where it was djfdhsdfj don't hate us eeeee ly guys<3
It was these little things, these touches of Dean's thoughts, that had kept Castiel going for so many years. And whenever he wondered why he shouldn't just give up, why he was here, why
any good memories.
“And who is
“And guacamole,” Cas says.
"The specifics to my geometric-based technique which is granting me so much success."
Dean laughed at the angel's expression. "Yeah.
All at once, Dean’s attention is swiftly grabbed by an outdoor food stand that is advertising tiny burgers. “Wait, hold that thought, I’m hungry.”
Dean sighs, checking his phone. He has time to answer a few stupid questions. Might as well hear the guy out. "Fine. What do you want to know, oh Great Interrogator?"
“-okay, okay I get it,” Dean huffs.
The feeling dissipates as Cas reaches his other hand to yank the cord on his bedside lamp, warming the room with a yellow glow. It’s almost like an entirely different dimension. Dean breathes. Neither of them say anything, because neither of them have to.
Beads of sweat are now dripping steadily from Jack’s face, his golden eyes glowing fiercely, outstretched hands shaking with fatigue. The rift seems to be flickering, black tendrils creeping out, then retreating as quickly as they came.
Swallowing hard, Dean tried to shove down the wave of guilt before it reached his face. Cas deserved better. But for now, he was here,
But it is also the color of Cas’s flushed and swollen lips, as he pulls away for air, blue eyes turned upwards.
"You're Dean frickin’ Winchester. You got this. Cas loves you, and you love him. Now I gotta go because I think I see Claire and Kaia bringing in another vamp body and I
Cas inhaled slowly, watching Dean's expression, then nodded. "Dean, that was a long time ago and—"
As always:<3
Cas takes a few hurried steps away, not looking back, not even hearing the rest of Dean’s sentence. He flies off, not caring if anyone saw him disappear into thin air.
“Okay. Here. I’m gonna go back to my room, then you knock. Good?”
Breathing heavily, Dean returned to devouring the burger, giving Cas a stubborn grin as he finished swallowing a bite after only 3 chews, and Cas sighed in exasperation.
"Guess you'll never know."
Sam wraps one welcoming arm around the boy, then gestures the two of them down the stairs and down the hallway into the kitchen. Jack sets the pastry on the counter.
The lyrics drifted out of the vinyl jukebox in the corner of the bar, crackling slightly with static near the beginning, but smoothed out enough for Dean to recognize the tune. He smiled a little at the familiar words. His childhood, if you could even call it that, hadn't had much in the way of fun. Whatever time hadn't been spent making food for Sam, hunting with Dad, or staring out the window of the Impala, had been mostly pacing around motel rooms and watching whatever happened to be on TV at the time. Back to the Future had been one of his favorite films, although he had only gotten to watch it once.
Even their father had never managed to find one of the home nests. Course they'd 'questioned' a few of the newly-breds, but it quickly became obvious that the senior-vamps kept that piece of information extremely private.
Dean thinks, watching the dark haired angel out of the corner of his eye. He's humming again. Still Zeppelin. Dean thinks he can recognize the tune to '
“Did you… did you find the—”
Luckily, both he and Cas had valid excuses for taking the bench. Impalement doesn't exactly heal quickly, and Cas was still getting used to being human.
Also: guys: I am just gonna say this: I am the luckiest fricking fanfic author on the planet. Jupiticas (Blu) started off as my beta-reader, and now: here we are: Team Blu/Charlie, and I have never loved anything so much as I have loved sharing this fic with them.

It scared him to admit that those two words had often been the only barrier between himself and death. Death was a nail, incessantly pounding its desirable promises of rest into Dean's thoughts, poisoning every happy moment. Was he happy? Or would he be happier dead? Was it all worth it, or should he just get it over with, since he was bound to die anyway?
Cas's promise, made not too long ago, and it meant more to Dean than he cared to admit.
A huff from the other end, then: "She knows, I called her. Kaia and I were on a

I want to commemorate this chapter to the events of March 16th 2021: the day Misha Collins said 'Still Beautiful, Still Dean Winchester' as Castiel. Misha: Thank you. So much. And thank you to everyone who pooled together the money for the cameo request. I will forever remember yesterday.
Dean realized with shock, his heart jolting into his throat.
She winces as the papers shuffle noisily under the door. Red hair flying, she speeds back to her room.
"Huh. Awfully quick to talk, Cas. Sure you aren't hiding something, like maybe you wanted to kiss someone else?" Dean stood up and prodded the angel's shoulder teasingly, causing Cas to stumble slightly, feeling a slight layer of heat settle on his skin. If angels could sweat, he imagined he would be.
The white of the shirt contrasted quite nicely with Cas's tan skin and dark, ruffled hair, which was sticking up in miniature cow-licks above both ears. It was kind of adorable.
He could already feel the prickling heat, the beginnings of tears, either from relief or from nerves, he couldn’t tell.
(See the end of the chapter for
But Cas had left a note anyway, and though the words were few and short, Dean felt a jumping sensation in his stomach when he read them.
Dean laughs. “As you wish.”
Dean glanced over at the angel behind him, still standing in the doorway. His blue eyes, almost black in the low light, were squinting around grimly, as if analyzing each and every stranger within the tavern's premises. Looking around for the nearest pool table, Dean clapped the angel on the shoulder jovially, and pushed him towards the right corner of the room, where a green-felted game table awaited unused. "Here we go, buddy. All for us."
another voice warned.
The boy rolled his eyes. "aw come on dude. I've had a rough week, this weird game of yours isn't—"
Cas nodded, knowing the struggle it took for Dean to 'forget and forgive,' himself, and handed over the remote.
It was so easy, to believe that Cas would stay around this time…
And they will plan to build a home and fill it with their dreams, and they will plan a future they will learn to acknowledge their deservance of, and they will plan events and holidays, but shining brighter will be all the unplanned moments in between.
Dean realized.
“I mean…” the Empty shakes her head in mocking sympathy. “He was your best friend, wasn’t he—should I say, your

"Hey you said you were curious, you coulda picked any one of us, you know you were just dying to—
Cas stepped gracefully over the burn-mark, and turned once more to Sam. "I will be in contact."
It’s quiet, except for the occasional interruption of Dean relaying lines.

It was actually pretty interesting, although he'd rather be attacked by a swarm of paper wasps than admit it out loud.

The deal that will end his life the moment he lets himself be truly happy.

might not exist.
Without looking up, Dean pulls a smirk. "Picking locks ain't exactly hard, sweetheart."
It could be worse.
He had fallen to his knees in the middle of the road, and felt the sharp gravel dig into his skin, and the coldness of the air and the realization that an oncoming car could actually kill him now, but Castiel didn't care if he died, because
And then the angels fell. And Castiel fell with them. He lost his powers, his wings, and his kin. But those losses were nothing in comparison to losing the
It was never enough, touching Dean, but Cas had his own words to say. He let go, and Dean remained propped up against the car, as if he hadn't wanted to let go either.
Dean's heart skipped a beat, jolting spasms through his shaking fingers, and he dropped the shard.
Silence. It wasn't awkward this time, but the pained absence of words, of apologies, of affectionate jokes, it was too much, not enough, and far worse than any silence before it.
“-so you see. I know a lot about being human. And that is how—” Cas steps a bit further away, shrugging on his trenchcoat. “—I know—”
"Hey Sam—we're outside the door."
Seeing Dean felt like waking up from a nightmare that felt so real, and the

Sam knew, both from real life and from Chuck's narration, that his ship's—
"Right."
But Cas knew Dean wouldn't want that either.
The credits to the Princess Bride are rolling upwards on Dean’s laptop screen, blue glow bouncing off their faces in the darkness. Of course, Sam and Jack had offered to let them have the lounge room, but Dean had refused. There is something… irresistibly reminiscent, traditional, watching movies with Cas on his
How 'bout some more angst. Heh. Hopefully some fluff in the next chapter. Movie night with Dean and Cas, so the probability of fluff is VERY high :)
Dean realizes.
at what cost?"
"Oh." Cas visibly relaxed. "Nothing—The clothes are nice. Thank you Dean. I—I think I understand now, the appeal in wearing apparel specifically designed to promote comfort. I didn't think the difference would affect me, but… it's nice."
“It’s my new salad!” Jack smiles proudly, apparently misunderstanding Dean’s reaction. “Cas and I made it, just a few minutes ago. We spent the day trying out new food combinations. What do you think?”
The nearest church is about an hour’s drive, but neither of them mind. There’s no such thing as boredom when one has good music, and even better company.
"Yeah?"
It was in those times, of being a ghost, that Dean wondered how others could still be so passionate about this
It’s true. It’s bona-fide, genuinity.
Sam got up from the bed. He was going to find those damn notes, because if Dean had a chance at real happiness….
"DAMMIT, Cas, you KNOW they're a bunch of dicks but you still run off to help them like the coward you are!" he was yelling, but it didn't feel like it. It felt as if he were in a dream, shouting until his voice grew hoarse, with no one to hear him, and no sound escaping his mouth, and no matter how much he tried, he could only emit silent whispers.
---------------------------------------------------------------
“Hey, kid,” Dean raises a plate questioningly. “Pancakes?”
Cas stared serenely out the window. "Well… I think humans
A whisper. “My coat—” He shifts his gaze to the beige trenchcoat draped over the armchair, and Dean tentatively pads over to pick it up, then looks questioningly at Cas.
"I can't- I can't help it. And I just needed you to hear it, and you don't have to say anything, I just wanted you to know—"
The angel cocked his head to one side. He remembered that day. He had mistakenly walked in on Dean shirtless, halfway through the process of getting dressed. Apparently, Dean had not felt the same way, and while Sam was tucked away in the bunker's library reading up on lore, Dean had spent the day teaching Cas the ways and habits of human life: including knocking one's fist on doors when you wished to enter. This rule was apparently, not to be forgotten, particularly if he was going to start living in the bunker. Cas remembered that day fondly. It was one of his good memories, and he had so few of those. But the ones he did have, no doubt revolved around Dean.
Dean adjusted his own seat so that he could more comfortably face the angel. "So tell me somethin', Cas. And," he held up an warning finger, "it has to be about you, not me”
Cas swallows back the fear rising inside his throat, and fixes his gaze on his family.
Dean can’t explain it, this feeling of being complete. It’s as if… before Cas, before

—doesn't erase the clenching of his lungs, his jaw, the music in his head gets louder with each pounding word, buzzing noise, a loud shot, a scream, blue eyes, Novak, Novak—
He stayed there for a long time.
Closing his eyes to gain focus, Dean tries to block out the lyrics
yet. So if Charlie had been reading about Cas…. that meant Chuck had published more books before he 'came out' as the literal God.
Cas I- I'm not mad at you." Dean cleared his throat, trying to take a real breath, but it felt forced, as if his lungs just wanted to curl up and refuse air. "I just couldn't- I couldn't keep pretending, anymore, you know?"
,’ Charlie murmurs. “Sam
He raised a finger at Cas as if warning him. "And don't think I won't notice if you shoot a few extra points while I'm gone."
And he felt horrible, invading Dean's thoughts like this. The last time it had been this bad was when they'd stood in that sigil together. Cas remembered well the strength of Dean's thoughts then, the speed at which they shifted and disintegrated… he hadn't been able to understand a single word, even the emotions had been thoroughly swirled together.
“In fact, the opposite,” Dean grins, grabbing Cas by the hand and hauling him towards the rental shop, Cas stumbling to keep up. “The vamps can wait, we
we can watch
The answer seemed to steal the weight from Dean's lungs, and he bit his lip to hold in a grin. "Right. Well I was thinking, your room. Now that you'll be staying there, it might be nice to make it yours."
well… I'm invested, Blu. I am fucking invested in this friendship.
Cas sighs into Dean’s neck, breathing in the familiar scents. He can hear Dean’s heartbeat beneath warm skin, and the fallen angel knows:
In all honesty, Dean had no desire to work a case. For the first time, he didn't need a distraction. So when Sam offered to take the case alone with Jody, Dean didn't argue. Much.
It was quiet for a moment. Dean fiddled with his ring. Then—
"What about Sam?" Cas reached out to collect the chalk pads, thoughtfully rubbing them between his fingers.
"No, no, I know," Dean assured him. "You forgave me. And I—Cas
Blu, you were my first comment. You said, "COLOR ME FUCKING INVESTED."
“Oh, my apologies.” Sam quiets down, giving Dean a meaningful glance before turning to the nurse and gesturing at the door. “I can tell you outside, if you’d like.”
These were the thoughts which stole Dean's sleep. The thoughts that whispered truths:
“Hello, Castiel.” A voice sounds from behind him.
:D :D
The name leaked out in a whisper, and Dean spoke the rest of the prayer aloud because, in some strange way, it helped to hear something besides his own stifled gasps.
He'd shoved away the urge, obviously, laughed it off as a reaction to his secret fetish. That's all it had been. He'd have reacted the same even if a
And Cas had barely noticed. Barely reacted. It was the loudest cry of desperation Dean had ever dared to voice, and Cas had probably forgotten about it by now. Rejected it as another joke.
For weeks, while Cas was gone, the only thing Dean could smell was the trenchcoat, wet and dirty, and the scent of the rain falling in droplets across the lake, the musty updraft of dust that swirled into the air as Dean wiped off the table, and settled his best friend down upon it.
there with a freaking apron over his head.
But it’ll be worth it.
"Well… he was kind of the only friend I had." Dean began replacing the pool sticks and balls. This would be a long conversation, and there were other customers.
“I-It doesn’t really matter. Just, make the fist, and hit it against the wood.”
"um- so anyway- you guys talking about moving?"
A warm hand on his shoulder. Cas was standing behind him, Dean could hear plastic bags rustling and suddenly noticed the scent of food wafting through the room.
Dean hangs up, no response.
“Knock?” he says tentatively, like a question, then hearing Dean’s quiet laughter, smiles confusedly.
He turned back around to look at Dean. "It was the humans who decided to interpret love as a sin. Chuck has his… faults. But homophobia is not one of them. Actually, his idea of same-sex attraction was originally invented to stem the issue of over-population. Do you know how many orphans there are currently in the world, Dean?"

Usually, Dean would prefer to watch a movie without dozens of questions. But he'd seen this particular film about eight times, and besides. It's

There is only Jack. His son. The nephilim created by Lucifer, placed on the edge of a knife from the moment he was born, destined to be evil, his fate chosen by others…. But in the end, he chose to be a hero.
No angel was allowed to have romantic, or sexual relations with any human, due to the possibility of creating a Nephilim: the most powerful being in existence.

understand the significance hidden in the simple gift of a personalized mixtape? It was just music. Just words. Cas probably expected frickin gold-nuggets, or baskets of ambrosia. Whatever that was.
"DAMMIT Cas," Dean growled, shutting the water off with a quick twist of the knob. Now the only thing Cas could hear was Dean's unusually quick breathing, and of course, Sam's muffled movements behind the door.
isn’t real anymore?
For the first time, it doesn't help—
"Wonders never cease," Cas interrupted, nodding in mock seriousness, and Dean swatted him on the arm.
Dean noticed, just the realization that Cas actually looked happy—truly happy— was enough to make himself grin all over again.
The voice was back with vengeance, Cas was gone, and Dean wished then, face buried in his shaking hands, sobs building and building in a crescendo of unquenchable gasps for air, he wished to die.
Dean let his head tilt backwards against the hard bed frame, and closed his eyes. He could see it all, the stars reflected in the black of Baby's roof, the pleading softness in Cas's eyes, the tilted face, the words, those
Cas's hand slides down Dean's chest, almost like he's forgotten it exists, and he makes a very small noise in the back of his throat that leaves Dean weak kneed and dizzy.
Then again, maybe Cas just hadn't understood the real meaning. Maybe gifting a personalized mixtape of 13
"You could have
Dean reddened, his mouth opened slightly at Cas's expression. "I was only teasing, Cas I'm sorry man, I know you cared for Meg, I—"
Dean doesn’t finish his whispered sentence, he feels Cas’s warm breath mingle with his own, and it’s all over.
“But— if it's going to change everything then we gotta change too. No more doubts. We have to stop second guessing this. And I know—” Dean takes a breath, trying to stem the onslaught of memories. All the times he’d pushed Cas away, in fear of these
