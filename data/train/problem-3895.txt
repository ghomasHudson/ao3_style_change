“Sam, we don’t have time, let’s move!” Michael ordered, who was now snatching Dean’s body out of Cas’ grip and hauling him over his shoulder like he weighed nothing. Castiel knelt on the cold ground in shock, staring at his blood-covered hands. Had he just killed the man he loved? Or was it the thing that took hold of him?
“Nice try, boys.”
“Michael.”
“Damn it, I’ll hold them off. Lucifer, do it now!” Michael yelled, before a burst of bright light flew from his hands building a wall against the horde that threatened to engulf them. Sam quickly handed over the book to Lucifer who studied the younger Winchester for a long moment.
An icy cold shiver ran down all three of their spines when they heard the deep, rumbling voice echo from somewhere within that dark space. Readying himself with the angel blade, Dean glanced stared ahead as a dark figure with blood red eyes slowly made its way into view. Sam could feel beads of sweat forming all over his body as the nightmares that had haunted him for years tried to force their way to the surface.
“What book?”
Sam mumbled a quick “Okay,” before securing Chuck’s book just a little closer to his chest. There was absolutely no way he was going to lose that damn thing in there. That book was everything to them right now and if they lost it …
“Damn it, Lucifer, we're running out of time!” Dean shouted, clearly losing his patience, “We can only read half of Chuck’s book and Metatron said some crap about God leaving his secret fear with his ‘favourite,’ and if I remember correctly, that was you.”
Lucifer chuckled and opened the book, flipping through it page by page as slowly as he desired. The words began to burn through the white pages, leaving red enchocian scripture that would only be read by one ‘angel.’
“Sam … Dean,” Lucifer spoke calmly but the malice behind his voice was indescribable. He crossed his arms and stared at the three so called heroes. “Whatever can I do for you?”
Three seconds of standing in a void of pure nothingness and already Sam and Dean were on their knees, clutching their heads and crying out in agony as flashes of every horrible memory began to fill their minds. Loss, grief, pain, every torture experienced in hell that the boys had ever experienced was replayed on them tenfold, like it was happening in that very moment. Dean screamed as he felt his body carelessly flung back on the rack, giant hooks ripping into his sides and legs, holding him in place. All the while Sam was being pinned against the cage bars, staring up fearfully into two red eyes that held an evil in its purest form.
“Let’s go home,” Dean begged, “I can fix this, all of it. Everything. We’ll do whatever you want. We’ll have p-picnics and cook breakfast together ev-every morning and I’ll make you watch those dumb cowboy movies a h-hundred times until you get sick of me,” Dean half chuckled, before having to blink the oncoming darkness away.
Dean’s breaths came out in shallow gasps as he stared up into the thing’s eyes, willing it to believe him, willing Cas to believe him.
One final low growl emerged from somewhere deep within the thing’s chest as the dark liquid that covered it began to seep onto the ground, where it sizzled and dissipated into the world around it.
“You good?”
How long had they been searching, Dean wondered. Hours, days, weeks … years? It was strange wandering around in a place where absolutely nothing existed, yet there was sound all around them. Occasionally the brothers would feel something yank on their sleeve or bump into them, sending them falling to the ground, only to get up and see nothing there. Sam and Dean were beginning to think there was far more going on around them than Michael was letting on. That thought was quickly interrupted however when the archangel suddenly halted in his tracks, staring ahead with a strange look in his eyes.
“Do you see Cas?” Dean asked. The tiny crack in his brother’s voice would have broken Sam’s heart if they weren’t currently in very real danger. Michael’s eyes glowed a dangerous blue as he clenched his jaw, turned and began walking in the opposite direction.
With a loud crash behind them, Michael’s wall came tearing down sending him tumbling backwards. Lucifer has finally managed to translate the last few pages and Sam knew there was nothing for it but to run like hell back to the doorway and pray to … God? … that maybe, just maybe, they’d make it back in time. Sam snatched the book from Lucifer’s grasp and ran to his brother, who now lay cold and motionless in Castiel’s arms.
They hadn’t found Lucifer … he found them.
“The hell is that?” he asked, more to himself than anyone else. He squinted his eyes but trying to find a shadow in a place of eternal darkness was a futile effort, but he knew there was something out there. Watching. Waiting.
“Dean. Dean?”
Michael looked up from Dean and noticed the incoming stampede of good and evil which had recently been corrupted into pure, unrelenting hunger.
Michael took a step forward, placing himself between the hunters and the thing that used to be his little brother. The boys never would have noticed it, but the oldest archangel had spread out his mighty, gold wings as wide as they would go, shielding them from Lucifer’s gaze.
Michael could feel the grace in his wings buzzing like a swarm of bees, filling his entire being. Something was wrong, it was all wrong. None of this was even their choice!
“Really?” Lucifer lazily asked, watching his brother show off his far superior wingspan than the chicken wings he’d been reduced to. “Okay, enough small talk. Why are you here?”
“AHH!”
“Billy was coming through the door, and you were telling me all these things, and I just … I couldn’t breathe, I couldn’t think. I just ... I froze. All I knew was that I was about to lose the one person in the whole world w-who would ever l-love me … completely.” Dean was practically sobbing by this point. His whole world was crashing down around him but he'd be damned if he didn't tell Cas what he'd wanted to say for years.
“The book,” Dean stated, a little colder than intended. He knew they had to somehow get on Lucifer’s good side but the thing standing before him was far lower than any monster Dean had ever gone up against.
“I love you, sunshine ... I love you.”
Sam already knew the answer, the real answer, but he wasn’t about to push his brother into admitting anything now, not when they were about to walk into something they had absolutely no control over. Flicking his eyes between Sam and the doorway, Dean cleared his throat a little louder than he’d intended, almost giving himself away.
“Yeah,” he replied, swallowing nervously, “I’m good.”
with a capital T?”
Cas doesn’t respond, still panting, dark eyes on Dean, the outline of his erection not-at-all hidden by his sweats.
, where you need to keep your hips level.  They need to be able to move much more than that, or you’ll have no fluidity in your dance.”
Cas smirked.  “It worked though, didn’t it?”
Dean feels a hand on his back, and nearly jumps out of his skin.  He turns to find Cas, because of-fucking-course he does.  The guy can’t get enough of tearing him a new one squeezed into their classes, he’s gotta come and ruin his social time too.
Music floats from the tinny old piano at the side of the stage, gradually building as the scene progresses.  Dean wants to let himself get lost in it, but even without the distracting sound of limbs and chairs being dragged across the floor, he’s gotta keep counting bars like a motherfucker.
“Well get over here, idiot, and help me figure out this bingo thing Charlie sent over.”
of the pride flags.  Not even
i just know yr by yourself atm
Dean feels himself flush; a combination of embarrassment at being so easily seen through, and dread that Cas maybe already knows about Dean’s feelings for
“The fuck is this?”
“Oh, no reason.  I just thought you were having a thing with that Grindr dude, but here you are mooning over, admittedly, the most attractive person to ever grace your fine establishment.”
When Castiel’s daily run next took him past Pie & Vinyl, he was surprised and delighted to see a sign outside reading “Don’t cry: we have PIE!”, and a temporary counter set up in the open doorway of the café.  As he got closer, he could see two baristas painstakingly adding little toothpick flags to a range of pastries in between serving masked customers.  The woman, with fiery red hair, seemed to be mainly in charge of the flags, and was concentrating furiously on the positioning and distribution of the various designs across the baked goods in the glass display case next to the counter.  The man was talking easily with the customers with a smile like sunshine.
“Dean,
u could have chosen a username w the word daddy in it
“You can keep your right knee where it was, on the bench, and your left foot against the floor,” Garth demonstrates as he talks, ducking into the car.  “But then, we’d like you to try being lower down, like this.”  Garth bends fully over, practically lying on Michael’s back.  Dean’s reassured to see that Michael looks a little freaked, too.  Garth’s a great guy, and a fantastic repetiteur, but he can be…a lot.
After much rummaging, he finally found his running shoes in a box under the kitchen sink, covered in an inordinate number of candy wrappers.
You look beautiful.
He kicks his door shut, rather harder than necessary, and slumps down on the other side.
fuck jimmy, yr gona make me come

“Don’t you think you should maybe lay off the burritos, Chunky?”
The door thuds behind Cas as he dashes to his next job.  Gabriel continues silently watching Dean as he has a go at cleaning up some of the tequila mess, packs his bag, and also leaves.  Damn, he’s creepy for such a weird little dude.
Cas, still frowning, approaches the table and turns the card around to face Dean.  “Is this supposed to be a compliment?”
want to know anything about Castiel’s Dean-free love life.
“These are typical tango steps, and it is my job to teach you.  Trust me when I say it is not personal, and being right up in your sweaty space is not my idea of a good time.”
“This isn’t like an
Cas groans and is immediately back on top of Dean, fumbling with the buttons of his shirt.  He growls a little in frustration and then pushes away, leaving Dean suddenly cold again and aching for touch.
Dean looks away from Cas, and busies himself with the exact placement of the webcam on top of the TV.
— by a Starbucks mug and plate of pie being loudly and deliberately thunked down on the table in front of him.  Charlie is scowling slightly, and he feels like a shitty friend.
Dean kicks him under the table.  “Don’t be a dick.  There’s not an ounce of fat on you.  I just mean where the hell do you put it all?  You could give some of the ballet guys a run for their money.”
All in all, Saturday afternoon’s delivery kind of comes as a relief.  At least, until Cas actually opens the thing.
“What?  No, nobody told me.  But Dean, who else would they have been from?”
send pics
Dean wipes a towel over his face and neck before shuffling inwards to face the barre and is greeted with Charlie’s flushed and damp face.
Castiel dumped the box of shoes in his new bedroom, where Gabriel was lounging on his bed eating a pack of Twizzlers.
The puzzled squint remains as Cas tears open the envelope to reveal a card inside.
“Thanks Bill Nye, anything else?”
Eileen was half-right, as it turns out.  The drinks are real cheap, and the hot blonde chick behind the bar must be on wheels, he gets served so fast.  He’s a good person, so he grabs beers for Sam and Eileen in addition to his own.  The music, on the other hand, is absolute on-fire garbage.  That’s not to say he’s not enjoying it, or that it’s not one hundred percent appropriate for the venue, but to call it ‘great’ is practically criminal.  It’s the kind of party shit that gets people moving, and armed with the comfort-blanket of a beer in one hand, Dean can’t resist dancing too.
I just want a hug.
“Eileen, obviously.”  Charlie deposits herself down on the side of his bed and prods him sharply in the ribs.  “I haven’t seen you in like two weeks.”
Dean’s eyes dart to Cas’s bedroom door, as if he might be summoned by the mere mention of Dean’s card habit.
Once Dean has absorbed the message, he reads it out to Sam.
He’s been going to classes with Cas for weeks, been rehearsing for the production for just as long, but even Dean has to admit he’s taken a substantial step backwards recently.  He’s beginning to dread every rehearsal and coaching session, Cas and Rowena’s irritation bleeding into him and locking up every muscle in his body.  He knows it’s not what he’s supposed to be doing — knows perfectly fucking well — but he can’t help keeping himself stubbornly at arm’s length from Cas, and things are awkward as hell with Michael both on-stage and off.  Try as he might, he just can’t dig himself out of this one.
Cas stretches and groans.  “What do you want me to do about it?”
Dean cried out, grabbing desperately at his bed sheets.  He spread his legs on the bed, arching his back as if Jimmy were really behind him, as if he were really about to fuck him with that clever tongue.
He’s...silent?  Totally silent.
“What’s the sappy expression for?”
Dean’s eyes snap to Cas’s.  It’s not phrased as a question, but neither is it a demand.  They’ve both had a drink, but nothing like the amount he saw Cas put away during their class last week, and he was still of pretty sound mind then.
.  All that’s changed is that now Dean doesn’t have to resist the urge to kiss Cas when he’s on one of his rants, or squeeze his hand after a frustrating meeting.  And holy crap, it’s awesome.
Fuck.
“Damn, a guy could do himself an injury between those thighs.”
— what’s French for five? — with some of the guys reminds him just a little too much of why they’d never have been a long term thing.
Two shots later, Cas asks if Dean has ever done a body shot.
“Um, Professor?” the voice was timid, but wobbling slightly with suppressed laughter.  “You’re not wearing… you haven’t got…”  The voice cut off abruptly with a choking noise.  Castiel squinted at the laptop perched on his desk, nonplussed.
Dean tensed slightly, but she didn’t look like she was about to launch into teasing mode.
“Wow.  Hot date?”
Cas is relentless in his ministrations, pressing his tongue along the sensitive underside of Dean’s cock and moaning his pleasure.  There’s a slurping sound and the sensation of cool air as he pulls off with a gasp.
” she said, punctuating the last words with a prod to his chest.  “All you’re doing is asking him about your mystery smell.  What could go wrong?”
“Oh, I, er… I’m not… I mean, you’re a cool guy and everything, but—”
.  And if we change the bit in the middle to a more
“Bela, take more care when landing from your
Delivering two lectures in one morning had absolutely no business being so exhausting.  Especially considering he didn’t even have to travel to campus to deliver them.  Nonetheless, after a morning of Zoom teaching, Castiel was wiped.  As he stared into the half-empty fridge, waiting for lunch inspiration to strike, he heard his phone buzz from his bedroom.  Inspiration having failed to appear, he closed the fridge and went to check his phone, in case it had any ideas.
“...Oh, right.  Well, no sweat, see you tomorrow.”
“Ready, and one, and two, up through
Dean lets himself be drawn into Cas’s space.  It feels natural at this point to wrap his arms around Cas; one firm around the small of his back, and the other hand at his neck.  His judgement and coordination are slightly off, and Dean
“I really thought I was going to go into professional ballet, and that would be my life.  My whole family was in ballet; it just seemed logical.  It seemed easy.”  Cas sighs.  “Having said that, spending all day every day with my stuck-up cousin wasn’t high on my list of preferred activities.”
Anyone who knew Dean could immediately see his personality writ large all over the café. Pie & Vinyl was an independent oasis in a parched desert of Starbucks, carefully and conscientiously built from the ground up by Dean. Charlie had helped with refining the décor and getting the social media ball rolling, but the aesthetic and the offering was Dean to a T.
Dean can’t breathe, let alone string words together, but he nods jerkily.
.  But, he’s a masochist, so...
Dean can’t resist the opportunity to gross out his little brother.  “Not really my type, but hey, maybe he has a sister...”
hey, are you interested in joining an orgy tonight?
Cas’s eyes take on a glazed look as he revs up the mental choreography engine.  “We could put a lift leading into the early
“Yeah, I just had a rehearsal so… y’know.”  Dean fidgets, trying to reassemble his brain.  “I’m all set.”
The near-silence as Dino drives away from the diner is broken by a cacophony, cueing Dean up for his and Bela’s raunchy
“Ok, ok.  Sorry.  Let’s take a break for a moment.”
“Sorry, sorry.  So why’s he got you moping like a budget rom com?”
“Can I suck you?”
“There’s a
Dean blinks, mindlessly staring at the innocuous lid of the cup.  “I thought teachers were the ones who needed bribery to write a good report card.  You worried I’ll leave a bad Yelp review or something?”
Dean exchanges a look with Michael.  “Is there a problem with it?”
“Hey, no judgement, you already know I think she’s the spawn of satan, but your recreational activities are your own.”
Dean nods, understanding.
Are you sick?
“Whatever, did you get them?”
“There’s nothing happening with Bela.”
“You can.”  Cas insists, over and over again, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.
“We’re doing that again?  Wow, I can hardly wait.”
So, Dean doesn’t mention it.
Sam rolled his eyes. “Keep it in your pants. He’s new to the Linguistics faculty, which is literally in the same building as PolSci. Please don’t make me need to bleach my brain when we’re all back on campus.”
In an instant, he was wide awake, catapulted upright by a shot of adrenaline.
Castiel’s —
“Nice place you’ve got here.”
“Yeah, well,” she grimaces.  “Apparently my character has poor taste.  As do all the other poor saps who are falling over themselves trying to shag you.”
“Dean!”
Rowena frowns at Dean, then looks over Benny’s shoulder at the pages of benesh.
“Dude, I’ve only got what I’m wearing.  There’s no way anywhere with steak that’s safe to eat is gonna let me into their premises like this.”
.”  He stood, reaching for a board pen from his desk, and wrote the term at the top of the whiteboard.  “The Roman empire was vast, and most people would not have spoken Greek or Latin as a first language.  We’re talking Etruscan, Phoenician, Punic, Venetic…”  He trailed off as he heard the Zoom chat function ping with a new notification on his computer, distracting him from his train of thought.  He shook his head slightly, trying to get back on track.  “Roman authors referred to Latin and Greek as
“Hey, I never said--”
“It’s all that having to teach morons how to tango.  Hungry work.”
dude, no, it was great
Dean throws an arm over his eyes and tries to slow his breathing.  It
“...Great, now let’s actually try that in the context of the scene.”
Finally, Dean sighed and nodded, ever so slightly rolling his hips to take more of Cas’s fingers.  Cas kissed his thigh again, murmuring praise for his beautiful man.  He added even more lube to his right hand, now dripping onto the towel pre-emptively set down to cover the bed for this evening’s plans.  He was trembling almost as much as Dean, but he had to put his own arousal and anticipation to one side to give his partner what he needed.
Dean makes his most innocent ‘who, me?’ gesture, but makes his exit sharpish so he doesn’t have to hear the kitchen cleanliness lecture again.  Or worse, watch Sam’s prissy smug face as he witnesses it.
Charlie gets up from Dean’s bed, and leaves the room in silence, closing the door behind her.
“This isn’t a tea break, ladies and gentlemen.  Focus.  Dean, don’t get stuck at the top of the rise.  You must keep moving through your foot for the full count.”
“I thought you’d find it funny.  And--”  Cas audibly swallows.  “And getting a funny one also gave me an out, in case I had...misunderstood.”
“Do I look like I’m joking?  Come here.”
There was something deeply satisfying about having all your books in order having moved to a new place.   More than any other part of the unpacking process, this was really what made it start to feel like home.  Castiel stood back from the wide shelves to admire his handiwork.  It had felt like an unnecessary luxury, buying somewhere with (what was generously referred to as) a second bedroom, but since he’d embraced it as a potential home office he was glad for the additional space.  Some of these books hadn’t even been unpacked from their boxes during his last move in Chicago, back to the poky studio after things had finally gone irreparably south with Balthazar.  But now, he had all his books in place, he’d set up his workspace, his teaching timetable for the quarter was pinned to the wall, and he was in a new city where nobody knew him and he could get a fresh start.
r u kidding
“You’ve seen me every day at rehearsal.”
It seems you’re also an early riser.  What do you do?
Charlie falters, looking bemused.  “I mean… everyone’s been talking about Dean and his cute boyfriend… is there something I’ve missed?”
card had elicited a laugh, and although Dean had worried it’d be a bit on the sappy side, the
“I saw the new guy this morning.”
,” says Charlie, pointedly.  “It doesn’t sound like Castiel’s reaction was completely fair either.  Don’t worry, handmaiden, your queen is here, and we’re going to work this out.”
His mom chuckled and Dean smiled too, but then his face got serious, because even though he wanted to talk about it, he couldn't tell his mom, because she was still living in that abusive household.
"Woah, who hurt you?" Sam asked as he stepped into the kitchen as well, putting down two bags with, for Dean's taste, way too much green in there.
Cas looks hesitant and shy at first, but then he starts mimicing Deans movements from before, kissing his way down, until he reaches his waistband. He also opens Deans jeans quickly and pulls the fabric down, gasping by the sight of the hunters huge dick.
"Hey, shut up. You don't know her at all and she's great, okay? She just wants me to get - to be fine."
Dean stands there, his hands clenched to fists and his eyes darting at the floor, while he waits for Castiel to leave. When he's gone, he rubs his face with one hand, having the heavy feeling of guilt in his chest. He doesn't want this, never wanted Cas to leave, but this is his only option.
Dean put the cup in the sink, before he turned around without another word, his arms crossed in front of his chest.
The hunter swallows hard, staring at Cas like he has never stared at anyone else before. "I... I can't... you have to be safe. You have to stay away. They will find out and they... they will kill you..." he whispers, his heart racing and his hands shaking.
"Yeah, I think so. Fell asleep on the couch."
, he thought, but even though his voice sounded a little shaky, his grip was firm, which seemed to impress the other man, judging on how he raised his eyebrow.
"Uh, you live here? I mean, usually, when you go to therapy, there's uh- waiting rooms, and- and-"
"Y-yeah. 'm in the kitchen."
"C'mon buddy, don't be like that now." Deans voice is just a mumble and again, he stares at the ground.
Dean released a breath he didn't know he was holding and cleared his throat, his gaze fixed on the things in the fridge, which was mostly Sam's healthy crap.
"FUCK! Cas, just like... like this" Dean huffs out, his voice a bit higher than normal.
I think after that train wreck today, I'd upload chapter 2 early, since a lot of us might need a distraction anyway. I'll stick to uploading on Saturdays then instead of Thursdays, since it's also easier for me.
Dean never really was a cat person, he couldn't be because of his allergies, but Lisa wanted one more than anything else, so of course he had to give in. The first few weeks were a nightmare. His eyes were watering constantly, he couldn't smell or taste a single thing and his skin was itchy the whole time, but eventually Lisa found a solution. She came home from work with a bright grin one day, some papers in her hands. At first, Dean was more than confused, but when he'd seen that all of that stuff was about drugs for cat allergies, a smile had spread on his face and he kissed Lisa stupid - after he was done sneezing four times. Now, Sammy was one of the most important things in Dean's life and he couldn't think about living without him anymore.
"Yes, it isn't a typical name. My - my father gave it to me. He was really religious, and it's a changed version of an angel's name, Cassiel."
Dean leans back again and holds his breath, his eyes also filled with tears. "You - you know that it's there. It always was. But... it's too dange-" He can't finish his sentence, because Cas leans forward again and presses his lips against Deans. He waits a few seconds, before he leans back once more and looks into the hunters eyes, these oh so beautiful green eyes.
"Cas?"
He could hear the smile in her voice, but he also noticed that she sounded tired, almost wrung out. There was a sting in his heart all of a sudden and he felt his eyes watering, but he quickly blinked a few times.
For a second, Dean wanted to shake his head, but he knew that he couldn't let it go without knowing what was really going on, so he gave her a defeated nod.
Dean almost got angry that Castiel didn't answer his question, but to his surprise, he actually did feel better. His heartbeat was almost back to normal, his hands had stopped shaking and his breathing was slow and deep, calmer than it had been all morning.
The hunter slowly opens his eyes now and cups the angels cheek, caressing it softly with his thumb and smiling heavenly, before he leans forward and places a soft kiss on his lips. Both of them breathe heavily and just stare into the others eyes until they calmed down a bit.
"No, that's why I wouldn't charge you."
"Uh, yeah, right, I'm Dean."
Dean had to swallow, because even though he knew Sam was right, hearing his little brother say it out loud was something else entirely.
As soon as he heard the door closing, he got his phone out of his pocket to dial his mom. It rang a few times before she picked up, but it wasn't his mom.
Dean swallowed, suddenly too embarrassed to look at the other man anymore, so he took his cup and sipped on his coffee, thinking about how to answer.
Sam tried to stay serious, but when Dean looked up, he could see the corner of his mouth twitching, so he reached out to hit him, but Sam was faster and took a step back.
There was silence again for a short time, but then he could hear his mom clicking her tongue. Shit.
Dean stared at his phone, tears in his eyes, but he blinked them away quickly. One day, he would get her out of there. With another sigh, he threw his phone on the table in front of him and lay down on the couch, trying to focus on the movie that was playing, but soon, his eyes fell shut. At first he tried to stay awake, but after a while, he let it happen, let sleep take over, hoping that he wouldn't be such a mess anymore after some sleep.
"Hey Dean, how are you doing?"
Feeling a little nauseous from having to think about his dad, Dean agreed quickly and said his goodbye, almost like he was in trance, before he ended the call. His phone dropped on the couch and he took his beer, just to empty it completely this time. When the nauseous feeling was still there, he lay down, staring at the ceiling. He noticed that his whole body was shaking a little, and breathing was getting harder once again. Before it got any worse, he suddenly remembered the technique Castiel did with him and tried it by himself, but for some reason, it didn't work.
"No… yes, I just - you know what, nevermind."
With that, his mom hung up and Dean noticed only then that she completely avoided talking about herself once again, which probably meant that something did happen. Shit. Why was she so stubborn? She could leave John, could live a life free from pain, but she decided against it.
Sam's eyes grew three sizes bigger for a second, but he got his face under control again immediately.
Once again, Dean started to feel selfish, because even though he couldn't stand that man, he was still family. Sometimes, just sometimes, he thought that maybe he was so afraid because he hasn't had much time with his dad, and seeing him in a state like that would do more harm than good, because he knew he wouldn't be there long enough. Dean couldn't save him, and even though John didn't deserve to be saved, Dean felt like it was just wrong to let his dad go like that.
He could feel how Lisa wrapped her arms around his neck and his smile grew, but only for a few seconds, because what she said next made him freeze.
"Yeah, sleep," he mumbled, while he pushed the door open and took off his shoes. He almost stumbled over Sammy, their cat, named after his brother, which reminded him that he needed to get more allergy pills as soon as possible. With a small smile, he leaned down to pet him and watched happily how Sammy leaned into the touch.
Lisa let go of his face and sat down next to him, taking his hand and squeezing it softly. That those blue eyes were still popping up in his head every time he wasn't careful, he didn't mention.
"Uh-huh. Sure. I thought all that therapy crap was about
"...you can't stay."
Dean wanted to say that he didn't need this shit, that he was an adult and could get through rough times on his own, but then it occurred to him that since those attacks started, he hadn’t been able to calm down again
As soon as Dean agreed, Lisa's words seemed to hit him. Castiel would be there. Castiel, with those fucking blue eyes and this unbelievable deep voice. Shit, Dean was fucked.
"Sure… uh, thanks, I guess. Maybe another time. I think I'm going now."
"No," Dean forced out, and he could hear Castiel sigh on the other end.
Dean raised an eyebrow, impressed by the implication that Castiel did all of this on his own.
When he was done showering, Dean got out, just to realize that all of the fresh towels were gone. Rolling his eyes and cursing his brother once
Dean also smiled as he wrapped his arms around her waist, before he pulled her into a tight hug.
"Dean, wait."
"Are you even allowed to do that?"
"I uh - I'd like to…"
"Oh, really? I know what I've seen Lisa, and I won't visit her just to see more of that crap. You can go, but I won't come."
The ex-angel doesn't seem to care. He feels the blood of his now human body rushing through his veins, feels how his breath hitches with every single touch. He feels how his lungs fill with air when he leans back again, because he suddenly felt like he couldn't breathe, too lost in their kiss.
Impressed, Dean's eyebrows shot up, but after thinking about it for a few moments, he shook his head.
"Can I ask you something, Dean?"
"It's nothing mom, really, I just… something happened today and, y'know, it - it brought back some memories."
"Alright, what if I promise to try not to analyze you? What if we just talk, and we both don't think about it as therapy, it's more like… getting to know each other. As - as friends, I mean."
were still popping up in his mind over and over again.
Again, Dean nodded and tried to clear the fog in his brain just a little.
"A pillow. And you-your arm."
about that, Dean. You have to understand that there has to be some kind of trust first. Just go, and if you don't like it, or Castiel for that matter, I won't bother you ever again."
"Alright, alright. I get it, I do. But call him at least and apologize. You owe him that much."
Before he entered, his gaze jumped to Sam's door, which was opened wide. Of course his little brother was up already, but the whole apartment was completely silent, so he must've already left, for whatever reason. With a shrug, Dean turned on the light in the bathroom and closed the door behind him, just in case Sam decided to come back again. His fresh clothes found their place on the closed toilet and he turned to glance into the mirror. The dark circles under his eyes weren't
Castiel smiled as he leaned back and seemed to think for a second, but then he nodded.
"You know what, I met Naomi on my way back. We talked for a while and she asked if we wanted to come over to have coffee together."
Helloooooooo people! :D
Sam tore his gaze away from the TV to look at Dean, but Dean couldn't bring himself to meet his little brother's eyes, so he took his beer again instead and gulped down the other half of the bottle. Feeling Sam's eyes on him, he stood up and headed to the kitchen to get another one, but when he came back, Sam was still staring at him.
There's almost no blue anymore, his pupils are dilated so much that he nearly looks like a demon now. A guttural sound escapes Dean because of the sight and he closes his eyes while he starts moving his head slowly, sure that he can't withstand Cas' gaze any longer.
Again, Dean didn't even know why he was trying to defend Castiel, but something in the other man's eyes had told him that there was more crap going on, more that reminded him of his past. What if he also got hit? What if his father was also a drunk bastard who didn't know how to raise a kid?
to say something.
"Dean, it's so... tight." The former angel moves his finger a bit, pushing it in a bit deeper. How should this work? How will his penis fit in there? Questions are running through his mind, but he doesn't say them out loud. He trusts Dean fully and is sure that he knows what he's doing.
. His hair was ruffled like he'd just gotten out of bed, and Dean felt the strange urge to push his hands through it, just to feel if it was as soft as it looked like.
“Excuse you, I object to that.”
Despite all evidence to the contrary, Castiel was definitely dead.
“I know it’s a bit pathetic to get your own birthday cake, or pie I suppose, but I only just recently moved here, just before lockdown, and this is my first birthday by myself.  My brother lives a few hours away, but I don’t know anyone else in the area, and–”
He makes it, and emerges on the other side to drunken screams and claps on the back, the crowd merging back into one sweaty, pulsing heap.
Cas shoots him a wry grin.  “My job would kinda suck if I didn’t.”
Cas had to briefly loosen his grip on Dean’s hip to palm his own cock, almost painful from being ignored.  But this was about Dean, and he couldn’t get distracted.  He continued the miniscule rotations of his hand, brushing up against Dean’s walls and causing the man to jerk and moan.  They were both sweating and panting as though they were running a marathon, despite the fact they were barely moving.
Oh, Ranger
Dean shifted uncomfortably.  “I dunno Charlie, I mean, I barely know the guy.  What if he’s a hipster or something?”
“You are an emotionally-constipated wimp.”
Michael adjusted his stance as though stating his dominance to some unseen enemy. The boys looked around for a moment still seeing nothing but darkness.
The creature slashed another clawed hand across Dean’s chest, spraying blood into the empty where the darkness seemed to engulf it. He could feel the energy draining from his body as the monster continued to rip him apart. Dean took a second to glance up at the things face and gasped when he noticed somewhere behind the black strands of goo that covered it’s eyes, was a very familiar blue.
Dean, who was already panicking over whatever master plan Sam had in store, whirled around madly with the blade when he heard a low, static growl coming from behind him.
The change of atmosphere in the bunker sent a cold chill down everyone’s spines the very second Michael opened the door. The four of them stood there, silently staring through the long, dark rip that had been torn through the fabric of the universe. Time and space had no meaning there and had never existed within the empty, and only Jack knew what awaited them on the other side. Sam and Dean watched on as drops of black goo oozed its way out of the tear and onto the hard-wooden floor below, where it seemed to crackle with some other-worldly electrical current. Jack noticed this and knew that was his doing.
“You can see them?” Sam asked. Michael nodded but kept his eyes fixed firmly on the shadow in the distance.
“Okay, everyone knows what they’re doing when they get in there?” Dean asked, pulling an angel blade from his back pocket. He had absolutely zero idea if the blade even work in that place since literally everything in there was already dead, but if offered a familiar sense of comfort having some kind of weapon in his hands. Adam took a breath and nodded, allowing Michael to take full control of his body. Together, Sam, Dean and Michael would go in search of Lucifer and use whatever means they could to make him read the last few pages of the book, while Jack stayed behind to keep the doorway open. There was no use sending the kid back into that place, especially after what had happened.
Sam let go of the breath he’d been holding onto and turned to look at his brother. The older Winchester was busy staring directly into the doorway, knowing that somewhere in that God-forsaken place was his best friend, and he was determined that come hell or high water, he was going to get Cas out.
“Dean!”
“Lucifer, listen to me,” Michael began, “Our father has returned to earth, and he’s destroyed every single world he’s ever created and now he’s coming for this one.”
Dean could feel the hot, red liquid filling his lungs as he begged the thing to let him go. “Cas, listen to me. What you said … back when I lost you. I never, ahh, I never had the chance to say anything back,” Dean choked, feeling warm tears and blood stream down his face. The thing paused but continued to growl as it pinned him to the cold, hard ground.
Unfortunately, Michael was only able to read the first half of Chuck’s ‘death book,’ until it became blindly obvious that they required the help of God’s other favourite son.
Michael whirled around to see the same dark shadow that had been stalking them from the start, now pinning Dean to the ground and gnashing its long, sharp jaws at his neck. Sam turned, hearing his brother cry out and suddenly became all too aware of the thousands of angels and demons that were now staring directly at them, teeth bared and eyes blazing deep reds and blues. The explosion Jack caused in the empty had clearly done more damage than they ever could have anticipated.
“No,” he mumbled, turning to Lucifer with tears now forming in his eyes, “Please. Please!”
“Sam … I’m sorry.”
“You shut your damn mouth,” Dean snapped, taking a dangerous step forward, earning himself a glance from Lucifer that seemed to almost dare him to take another step. Michael held up a hand and gave Dean a stern look of warning, who sighed in defeat and glared back at the devil. They weren’t here for a fight, they needed information and if Lucifer wouldn’t give it to them then they had nothing to work with, other than a few notes they’d made from the first half of the book. Amara could now hold flowers in her hands without destroying them but Jack couldn’t, and something about a ‘doorway to doubt’ would be opened and ‘the lost shall be released unto the world,’ whatever the hell that meant.
Dean jumped slightly and turned to glance at Sam.
“Sam, are you sure you want to do this?” Adam asked, staring uncomfortably into the deep abyss that awaited them. Sam took a deep breath and nodded.
“…no. No no no no no,” Sam mumbled incoherently to himself, running both hands through his already messy hair. This wasn’t happening, he thought. It couldn’t be happening, not now. They had just found the answer to stop Chuck!
“Yes!”
“Come on. We need to move quickly,” the archangel replied, not daring to give the man an answer. Dean barely had a moment to glance at Sam in confusion before they were both practically jogging to keep up with him.
“Dean. Dean?!” Cas yelled, shaking the man’s shoulders desperately. “Dean!”
“We can get you out.”
Lucifer.
“You’ve changed, Sam,” the devil remarked, “You’re not the scared little boy I once knew.”
Michael frowned and glanced about wildly in every direction like a cornered wolf, seeing everything the brothers could not. Angels and demons, all of them blindly fighting one another in a desperate attempt to escape the emptyness they’d suddenly found themselves in, but it was the thing that stalked them in the shadows that made Michael wish they’d never left the door open.
For the first time in an awfully long time, Dean smiled. It was soft, genuine and lasted for only a moment before that Winchester spark in his green eyes flickered once and faded away. The angel watched on in stunned silence as the man’s gentle grip on his cheek quickly lessened and slid to the unforgiving ground.
Dean took one last side glance at his brother who gave him a short nod of assurance before all three of them proceeded to walk forward into the unknown.
“Hmmm, and I should care why?” Lucifer asked.
Dean reached a hand up to gently rest it on what he thought would be Cas’ cheek, and gently caressed it as though it could somehow bring his angel back from the edge.
The archangel ignored him, too busy watching the interaction between devil and vessel, unsure if it was truly about to end the way it was always meant to. Sam was busy explaining about the back door they’d opened to the empty, and how if Lucifer could only translate the last few pages, they’d help him escape. A thought suddenly occurred to him and Michael wondered if any of this was real. What if God was writing this? What if Chuck had planned this to happen all along and none of it was actually ever written in the book? The whole time Chuck had made them believe the words they had read, but it was all just … ‘script.’
“Cas, come on!” Sam cried, trying to wipe away the tears and haul Cas to his feet at the same time. Cas stared up at him hopelessly, tears now streaming from his bloodshot eyes.
“Michael?” Dean asked.
“Don’t worry about it right now, we just gotta get out of here!” Sam yelled, grabbing hold of the angel’s trench coat and pushing him towards the direction they’d come from. There was absolutely no way Sam could let himself go there, not when there was an entire army of seriously pissed off zombies chasing them down. All four of them were now bolting for the door, Michael leading the charge with Dean carelessly tossed over his right shoulder, followed by Sam, Castiel and Lucifer at the rear. The hoard was gaining on them, but the light flowing from the bunker could be seen streaming through the door only a few strides away. Jack’s face quickly came into view as he urged them to run faster. Dark tendrils began to reach up out of the ground almost wrapping around their ankles, threatening to drag them back to nothing. They were a few feet from the door when Jack suddenly disappeared, and Chuck took his place.
“Hmm. Uhh, let me think about it … no,” Lucifer said, turning to walk away. All three glanced at each other nervously. Absolutely nothing was going to plan and for all they knew Chuck may have completely destroyed their world by now. Sam, on the other hand, had one idea left.
“Ohh Sammy, did you miss me?” Lucifer taunted, “Is that why you’re really here?”
“They’re awake.”
“Lucifer, hurry up!” Michael yelled, his arms shaking from the pressure. Lucifer was savouring every moment and taking all the time in the world which left Sam in near hysterics. It was like watching his brother be torn apart by hellhounds all over again. What would happen to his soul if he died in here? Sam didn’t want to think about it.
“It’s not the memories you’re hearing,” he replied, shouting over the multitude of voices that filled every endless space that had once been the home to silence.
Sam and Michael moved to help him but Dean shook his head, ordering them back.
“Ahhh, sonofabitch!” Dean grunted, trying to keep the creature at bay, “Don't worry about me. Just translate the damn thing!”
Sam was sure the tremble in his voice would have certainly given him away and he’d be torn to pieces right there and then, but instead the devil studied him closely for a long moment.
“I’m listening.”
“Michael?” Sam asked, nervously.
“Well, what is it?” Sam asked loudly. He too was covering his ears like it would somehow dull the sound. Michael took a deep breath, still keeping a steady eye on the creature that seemed to give off the same electrical spark the doorway had when they were first about to enter.
“We have to,” he replied, “It’s the only way we’ll beat Chuck.”
“Chuck’s book,” came Sam’s reply. Lucifer smiled and looked straight through his brother’s wings, burning his eyes into Sam’s. He still had a deep longing for his pet and would gladly have the man tied up on a tight leash by his side, worshipping the very ground he stood on.
Lisa laughed and pushed him away, but then gave him one last, quick kiss.
Slowly, Dean turned his head and named the first four things that jumped into his vision.
"Thank you. I think the furniture and the glass were the things that took the most time."
When he was done, he headed back to the living room and sat down on the couch to watch some TV while he was eating, but even though he tried to focus on whatever was on right now, his mind kept wandering. He thought about just getting over it and visiting his father - but as soon as his mind went there, his stomach turned and a wave of nausea hit him. He knew he shouldn’t feel like that about his father but with everything that had happened in the past, he couldn’t help himself.
Dean lets out a loud and throaty moan, his cock twitching and his muslces around Cas clenching. "Didn't know that... it would feel like... THIS..." His voice sounds more like a moan and he wraps his arms around Castiels neck, pulling him down into a wild and messy kiss.
Cas follows Deans orders and when he positioned himself, he slowly moves forwards, pushing against his rim, wanting to feel Dean so bad. When his tip slips in, he moans loudly, the feeling of getting squeezed like that almost driving him crazy.
, but otherwise, it's a good thing, Dean. Maybe you'll get the help you need to get over the past."
, he got Sam's blow dryer out of the cupboard and dried his whole body with it. As soon as he was happy with the result, he put his clothes on, brushed his teeth and went to the kitchen to make some coffee. Just when he opened the fridge, there was a noise on the front door and he immediately froze. His hand clenched around the handle of the fridge and he couldn't move a single muscle anymore.
Since when did she talk like that? Usually, she was nice and worried and caring, but right now, Dean felt like he was just punched in the face.
He'd never thought about going to therapy, even though he probably should have after everything that had happened, but when Charlie brought it up the first time, it was the
"Yeah, uh… same. See you, Cas."
her elbow into the other man's side.
"Actually, it happens more often than you think. It's fine, I get that opening up to a stranger is something that can be terrifying, and even though you know now that it wasn't for you, you can be proud of yourself for trying."
"I told you already. I know what I've seen, okay? I know there's something going on."
The new angle makes Dean scream Castiels name and he almost immediately gets hit by a strong, breathtaking orgasm, which totally surprises him, but he doesn't question it. He bends his back, pressing his ass against the angels crotch and screams out his pleasure, words that make no sense, but he's sure Cas' name is often there.
Now it was Dean's turn to sigh and he nodded, but he remembered that his mother couldn't see him, so he choked out a quick "Thanks, mom."
"Yes, I can. I just did it." With these words and a little smirk, Cas leans down and licks over the tip of Deans throbbing cock, moaning by the taste and the feeling of it. Dean inhales depply and tries not to show how much this little touch affects him, but his body isn't that reserved and his cock twitches, while a drop of precum forms on its tip.
Cas shakes his head, while he gets out a bag and starts stuffing the few clothes he has into it. His gaze doesn't meet Deans, he's totally fixed on his task.
Dean could hear something rip, and a few seconds later Castiel turned around with two cups of coffee in his hands. He walked over to the couch and sat down on the other end, placing the cups on the glass table in front of them.
"You aren't playing fair, you know that, right?" Dean groaned while his head dropped back. He really didn't want to do it, but now that Cas brought Charlie in, he couldn't say no anymore, could he?
a towel. Dean thought about sitting down again, but when he looked at the clock, he knew that he couldn't sit dreading it any longer. His arms dropping to his sides, he sighed and got his wallet, his keys and his phone from his room, before he forced his feet to leave the apartment.
Dean's first thought was to say no, to tell Castiel to fuck off, but when he kept talking, something inside of Dean seemed to change. He knew he needed help, had known it for a long time already, but this was the first time that he was actually considering getting it. Cas seemed to care about people, not just his job, and because his words seemed fucking genuine, it was easy to believe him.
“I just feel...that dance should be about joy.  About creativity of expression.  Without that, what’s the point?  I was doing ballet because I loved it, but at school I woke up every morning dreading the day ahead.”
Sam huffed in a way that implied a force 10 sulk was impending.  “Whatever, Dean.  I’m going out for a run.”
Dean mumbles his assent.
probably
“Please tell me you’re joking.”
“Lighten up, Sammy.  We’ve all got our kinks, it’s nothing to be ashamed of.”
“Aren’t I—”
at the fixed barre.  He feels loose and energized in a way that always happens after an intense morning training session.
“Get naked.  Now.”
Not at all
to literally climbing the walls.
Cas grabs Dean’s arm, stumbling a little.
“You are a stalker and a criminal.”
“Not in the last few days.”
“Cas, buddy, you’ve gotta explain to me what the hell is going on.”
“Hm, good save.  You’ll be spared, for now.”
Cas takes a step back, expression unreadable.  “In what sense?”
Castiel laughed, causing Dean to have a small heart attack.  “Cas is fine.”
Dean looks up.  That doesn’t sound like it’s the first time Cas has tried to get his attention.
Packing up shoes and donning outerwear at the end, the lack of sound from either music or direction means it’s pretty quiet and tense.  Dean can’t bear it.  If they’re going to continue working together, he’s got to try and break through the mile-thick ice one way or another.
Michael laughs.  “Don’t worry, I know your type.  I’m not expecting you to romance me or anything.”
“Right.  And Krushnic?  No offence or anything, but you don’t sound particularly...what, Russian?  Eastern European?”
“Do you want more?”
“It’s Cas.”  At Charlie’s blank expression, he elaborates.  “Castiel?  Naomi’s cousin who’s giving me the extra classes?”
“I’m sure there are no rules against it.  Plus, from the other list, we’ve taken shots for… someone who had a crush on you, someone
Charlie looked at him, arms crossed over her chest.
card had provoked a soft smile that would be etched on Dean’s retinas for the rest of forever.
“I, uh…”
— there’s a sprung floor.  What the fuck?  What kind of nightclub has a sprung floor?
Dean pounds up the stairs, Bela wrapped around him like a bony koala.  His thighs burn as he reaches the top, and her long nails rake through his hair.  As he releases her, she pushes away from him and begins disrobing, pulling the straps of her dress down her arms and exposing her bra.  She shoots him a flirtatious smile as she backs through the door, and Dean follows her.  He pulls his shirt over his head, throwing it carelessly to the floor, and stalks towards Bela as she slips out of her dress.
its a good job i like you
“All due respect, Director, I don’t get it.  Why pick me if you don’t think I’m good enough?”
Michael swats his arm.  “Is that the best you can do, stud?”  Dean snorts, despite himself.  “Look, I’ll turn over.  Okay?  They won’t be able to see me anyway, and you can just brace against my back.”  Michael wriggles onto his side, and Dean backs up to avoid any knees in any sensitive areas as he shimmies onto his front.  “See, I can still do the stupid Titanic-thing with my hand this way.  Hold onto my back, then you move me, and I move the car.  That should work, right?”
Dean climbed behind the wheel and started the engine. There was no sense in asking if Cas wanted to go home: whatever that word meant to him at the moment, it was probably not a place Dean could get to by driving. He’d seen a motel not far from the police station that would probably do for the night, but he had a sudden premonition that if he took Cas someplace warm, with a couple of beds and a shower and a coffeemaker and a vending machine, that might become home, for both of them. So he drove.
Except maybe a global pandemic.
Dean gapes at Cas.  “Are you serious right now?”
Cas steps back again into Dean’s space, trying to keep them close and moving fluidly together, huffing exasperatedly when Dean doesn’t comply.
Then he had another idea.
“Gross, Dean.”
“Sure, I could use a shower too.”
“Mm, I see why you like him.  Hey, is that my tequila?”
“If you spent half as much time actually doing what I am asking of you as you do ensuring your No Homo can be seen from space, we would be making far better progress.”
Michael grins at him.  “Bring it on, big boy.”
not today bc you probs need 2 catch up on sleep first
No, wait -- New Year’s Eve had been the worst.  Definitely the worst.  Just as Dean had suspected, the suggestion of having a small party (just them, of course -- they’re not plague rats) and ordering in food and drink had been met with a lukewarm reception, to put it generously.  It was fine, though.  Dean could understand it.  He wouldn’t want to be reminded that his only option for socialising for the foreseeable future was himself, either.  Still hurt a little.  Anyhow, in the end they’d both just trudged off to their own rooms after a quiet dinner, and gone to bed as normal.
“–it’s
“Tough titties, friend, you’re gonna.  Did something happen with Bela?”
Chastised, Dean reaches for the proffered coffee, since it hasn’t
“Well, I used to do ballet.  For years.  Before I ever branched out into other areas of dance, or into teaching.  And I still teach it, sometimes.”
can i do anything for u?
“Michael, great thinking with the positioning on your front.  We’d like to keep that.  Now, Dean, if you could be lower down in the car, that would be just fantastic.”
“Don’t you think you should maybe lay off my dick, Anna?”
“I think there’s a twelve-step program for—”
Dean felt like he really knew Jimmy; knew him far better than he knew Cas, and wanted to get to know even more.  But he also felt so guilty when he turned into a stammering mess at the sight of Cas.  It would be so easy - in theory - to just slip Cas his number with his flat white, or write it on the side of the paper bag carrying his pastry of choice.  But,
Dean feels his hackles rise.  It’s not that he hasn’t heard it all before: ‘highly-strung’, ‘diva’, all that bullshit.  He really thought another pro dancer would be above this crap, but apparently he’s just as bad as everyone else.  Dean grits his teeth but tries to deliberately relax his posture.  He’s here to learn, after all, even if the guy’s a douche.
“What?”
“Yikes, poor guy. He’s made one hell of a first impression.”
“What seems to be the problem?”
“Better,” hums Cas.  “Over the course of the next few weeks, I’ll be teaching you some basic steps and techniques that Rowena feels will support your current project.”
“You wear plaid and work in a coffee shop full of vinyl records, houseplants, and vintage furniture.”
“It’s ok.  We can stop if you want.  Whenever you want.”
“Wait, that came out wrong.”  Dean bit his lip and reached for Cas’s hand.  “I think you’re gorgeous.  The hottest thing since hot pockets.  You’re also just…”  He cast around for the right words.  “...just,
“Something like that, I guess.”
id be begging u
Why had he done that??
its ok
The usual sight of Cas’s bright blue eyes and perpetually messy dark hair was enough to short-circuit him on a normal day, but now it was accompanied by an overwhelming, all-consuming wave of that delicious fucking smell.
not exactly busy atm
“Don’t fucking touch me.”

“Then what’s up?  Please, Dean.  I’m worried about you.”  Charlie lies down on his bed, and he turns over to face her.
“Dean, I swear–”
Dean gulps and makes a show of reading the printed words.
“Why are you finding this so difficult?”
Castiel sat looking glumly at the TV.  He had woken up to an email from the department administrator to let him know they would be bringing a whiteboard and an OSHA form by, so that the university could say it had fulfilled its basic obligations for remote teaching.  This really wasn’t how he anticipated beginning this new chapter of his life, but he had to cling to the wins.
had that much to drink, but Dean’s head is spinning.  He doesn’t remember ever wanting anything — anyone — so badly in his life.  He pulls back from the kiss with a gasp, putting a hand out to Cas’s chest to keep him from closing the gap.  What is he doing?
Maybe
didn’t have to know that.  It wasn’t like the card came with a free neon sign saying
Looking down at the lithe body and dark hair before him, Dean’s mouth goes dry.  His mind goes straight to Cas, the stupid-attractive asshole.  He’s confronted with the same narrow hips but muscled ass, broad shoulders, hips like handles.  He grabs on, and fucks forward, barely avoiding actual dick-on-ass contact.  He feels the car prop rock around him, and hears a sound of approval from outside, but mostly he can just hear his own harsh breathing, the creaking of metal and plywood, and the blood rushing in his ears.
“This isn’t Averno.  You don’t need to stand to attention.  I know it’s hard for you ballet boys to let go, but that’s what you’re here to do.”
been withdrawn as punishment for being a shit listener.  “What were you saying?”
Dean draws a deep breath, then reaches out and takes hold of Cas’s hand over the coffee table, despite anyone being able to see that he’s holding hands with a man.  The sky doesn’t fall in.  The world fails to end.  Time ticks on.
