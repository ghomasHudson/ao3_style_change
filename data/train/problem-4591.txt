After he lets Cas go, he gives Dean an appraising look. He tries not to let his anxiety show. It helps that he’s still holding Charlie. Maybe, the guy will go easy on him.
“I know I’m your shining city upon a hill or whatever. One day, I’ll see what you see, but I need time.”
After his initial shock, Cas reigns him in, gently pulling him away from his wings. He can tell that he’s one good pet away from caving, but he respects Cas’s wishes and keeps his hands to himself, even if every part of him is screaming to keep going. All he wants to do is make Cas happy, and the angel grace flowing through him makes it impossible for him to feel anything less than pure adoration for the angel in front of him.
"You're welcome buddy, but you've been a Winchester in my book for a long time now. No need to get emotional every time I mention it," he says, patting him on the back for good measure.
Normally, he’d prefer not to know, but he doesn’t want to do anything to draw attention to himself if he can help it. Just because Cas thinks this world is safe, doesn’t mean it is. Sometimes his angel has real shitty instincts.
Before he can take the plunge, Cas gives him a chaste kiss on the lips. He’s more than ready to derail the conversation and turn this into a full on makeout session, but his angel retreats too quickly for Dean to even try to deepen it. He then takes Dean’s captured hands and tenderly presses his lips to each one, a signal for him to be patient and let Cas talk.
Cas’s humongous wings appear and rise up in challenge, practically eclipsing him without really having to try. It takes all his willpower not to fall to his knees.
He realizes a second too late the minefield he’s entered by phrasing it that way, even Cas looks shocked. He hasn’t exactly advertised his doubts to anyone other than Sam.
Dean looks down thoughtfully at his empty drink instead of saying something sarcastic. When he finally looks up, he’s rubbing his neck, looking a touch embarrassed.
“Hello Dean,” Cas says as soon as he enters the room, eyes never leaving the book he’s reading, a small smile on his lips.
“I hate that Metatron cursed you with pop culture knowledge. I miss stuff flying over your head,” he says grumpily, trying to escape.
The archangel that brought them here won’t be back until morning so they have some time to kill. Before they can duck out of Lux for the night, the bartender lets them know that drinks are on the house if the brothers want to stick around. As much as Dean wants to get as far away from this place as possible, he longs for the taste of alcohol more.
He nods again, absently twirling the hidden fork. It’s his only means of self defense in this stupid universe. No weapons had been one of Jack’s conditions. He’d only let him take the fork to humor him. He’s about to barge into the bookshop when the damn demon gives him some unsolicited advice.
The fear that Cas will leave him again returns with a vengeance, and he tightens his grip on the angel. He’s heart jumps when Cas doesn’t respond in kind.
"What did you feed him while he was human?" Aziraphale asks accusingly. It's the closest to mad he's ever seen him.
Dean turns around and does a double take. Right, angels come in all sorts of packages. He’s a well built dude with kind eyes. He can see why Linda decided to hit that.
“My siblings have varying opinions on the matter. I myself believe he’s well meaning but not without fault.”
Charlie babbles excitedly at him like he gets what he’s saying. Dean chalks it up to coincidence as he bounces the kid up and down. He refuses to entertain the idea that he’s holding a half angel baby. Sure, they may think they want their kid to be magic incarnate, but he wouldn’t wish what they’d been through on anyone. It’s simpler this way.
Thank you to everyone who commented and left kudos for this series. This is the intended finale, but if the mood ever strikes me, I may revisit this particular storyline again. Hope you guys enjoy the ending.
“You,” Michael says, ridiculously pleased at how easy he is to pick apart. This dude might as well be a cartoon super villain come to life with how little he gives a damn about anyone other than himself.
Being wholeheartedly showered with unconditional love gets kind of overwhelming. So, he clears his throat and makes an excuse to pry himself free from the angel’s grip.
“I figured he’d screw this up. Which is kind of pathetic, when you’re such a sure thing, I haven’t seen anyone so head over heels since, well . . . me.”
Dean scoffs. The more things change, the more they stay the same. He can’t find it in himself to be worried. As long as his angel is with him, he can do anything including kicking a third Michael’s ass.
Dean shoots the devil a dirty look for bringing up the stupid rebar, but a drink appears in his hand, and all is forgiven.
Cas vouching for him gets him to pause. He lets Dean go, but his freedom is short-lived. Lucifer yanks him up by the jacket and tosses him over his shoulder like a sack of potatoes.
“It’s too easy to get a rise out of you brother. You’re more like Lucifer than you realize. Threaten your little human, and you lose any and all common sense.”
He breaks into a smile. He wasn’t a hundred percent certain what Dean’s heart's desire actually was, but he’s pleasantly surprised to have his hopes realized. The devil is grinning too for entirely different reasons.
"T-Thank you, I'll return as soon as your orders are ready. Always a pleasure seeing you, Mr. Crowley, Mr. Fell."
Dean rubs his neck, concentrating on the fancy tiles under his feet. This part is kind of hard to admit to. Even if Sam insists they’ve been acting like a married couple for a while, and the kid didn’t even realize they weren’t together-together this whole time, everything feels super new. Things haven’t been that different, but they’ve been dancing around each other so long. He’s kind of off his game.
Dean freezes. It's painfully clear that Cas has omitted some of the things he did during their twelve year slow burn.
“Why’d you take him? Low on angels?” Sam asks. It’s a sincere question with none of the anxiety and fear that’s been plaguing his brother since the Devil popped into his head.
“Glad to see you two in one piece. I’m dreadfully sorry about your run in with Michael. He’d been keeping a low profile before your visit. I didn’t think he’d be a problem.”
Lucifer smirks, pouring himself another drink. He’s surprisingly happy despite the fact that both his guests ran out on him without so much as saying goodbye.
Lucifer’s mood has soured once again and only grows worse, the more he hears about Dean. There’s an intensity in his eyes as he grips his hand as if he too wishes to free Castiel from his current Hell.
“Look Lucifer, I’m not your biggest fan, but you seem like a pretty reasonable guy in this universe. Can we at least talk to him? We’re just a little worried about him. He did disappear on us out of the blue.”
“Obviously, we need to show the devil I’m in this for the long haul. So, give me some intel. What has the devil been whispering in your ear that has you dead set against me meeting him?”
Lucifer raises an eyebrow, intrigued. The first thing he does is offer him a drink. Castiel gladly takes it and downs the thing in one go. He almost wishes it had any effect at all on him.
He feels a headache coming on. Good thing Chuck destroyed every other alternate universe directly connected to their timeline before they could go too far down that rabbit hole and have to discuss whether or not seeing other versions of themselves counts as cheating. Dean’s not super sure he’d have been able to turn down, shell of himself Endverse Cas if he’d tried hard enough. He also got super lucky that Cas never met perfect well adjusted rich Dean before he got his hooks into him. Coincidentally, his angel is not allowed to go anywhere near Brazil.
“Are you sure it’s not something else? If he only saw them for a few seconds, it should have worn off by now,” Amenadiel says, puzzled by Cas’s power over him.
Again, the devil suppresses his worst instincts, biting his tongue for Cas’s sake. He adjusts his cufflinks so he can have a reason to ignore him and collect himself. When he does look up, he gives Dean a tight lipped smile. Super, somehow implying Lucifer deserves better than the whole devil shtick is what sends the dude over the edge. He probably would have been better off punching him again.
“Anyway, back to Lucifer, I know the dude has an important job or whatever, but he can’t be working on cases twenty four- seven, right?”
“Sure, maybe, I’ll jog something loose. If not, we’ll kick Lucifer’s ass and politely tell him to give you back the rest of your brain.”
Dean turns to face him, suddenly serious. He grabs him by the lapels again, and Cas lets him drag him forward, half expecting a kiss. He doesn’t get one, but the words Dean says are wonderful to hear all the same.
“I’ve waited long enough. Now, if you excuse me, I should go back before Dean impales himself on something else.”
Cas packs so much meaning into his name. It oozes with frustration, worry, and utter devotion, and Dean can’t take it. He needs the angel to understand that he’s not father material.
Dean feels impossibly warm all of a sudden, and he wonders if he’s been put in an angel cocoon for safe keeping. He relaxes, trusting Cas to hold him steady. Grace flows into him like an involuntary antidepressant. He should probably yell at the angel for overstepping but it’s nice to just be for a sec.
There’s something playful in his gaze, and he meaningfully takes a hold of his hand. Cas heart jumps. He can’t possibly be misinterpreting that signal. So, the Righteous Man’s answer completely catches him off guard.
He desperately needs a drink. Castiel immediately smashes the bottle he reaches for. Lucifer scowls, glad he didn’t go for something more expensive. He’s already had to go through one too many brawls today. At least, Castiel has an understandable reason to be cross with him. He still gets a headache every time he tries to figure out why Michael would even want to manipulate him for his entire existence.
He’s saved by Sam who puts a hand on the devil’s shoulder, stopping him in his tracks. The fire leaves Lucifer’s eyes as he turns to face his brother. There is a tinge of regret on his features, and Dean curses, looks like this devil has a soft spot for his brother too.
Cas is very close to snapping. He can tell. That’s like his fourth solitary Dean. He claps his angel on the back and gives him a quick peck on the cheek.
He offers his hand to the devil to make a deal of sorts. Lucifer’s eyes widen, catching the significance of the gesture. He takes the offer, and the contract is sealed.
Cas scowls at the phone, and he can see the glimmer of near invisible wings raise up in agitation. He’s so much more expressive this way. It’s fascinating.
“As riveting as this is, the detective has contacted me for a case, and I’ll need to leave you two to your own devices for a while, feel free to do what you like while I’m gone.”
"Hush, it's your own fault for not telling Castiel that the poor dears weren't in any danger of actually being destroyed. I'm sure he would have left you to your hobby and not instantly healed them every time they looked the slightest bit worn otherwise."
Lucifer is having none of it. He casually takes out a curved knife similar to the one Michael had on him. Dean tenses, but all the devil does is casually stroke the edge of it with his thumb and give Cas a serious look.
“I understand this ritual is important to Aziraphale. Early in our acquaintanceship I suggested he open a library where the humans would be obligated to return his books so he wouldn’t have to spend so much energy chasing customers away. He looked at me as if I’d asked him to give away all his children.”
He gives a little bow as he runs off with his tail between his legs. Dean can't help but snicker. Maybe, there is still a little Hell left in him.
“Nothing I can’t handle. Stay behind me,” Cas says, forcibly pushing him back as he staggers forward. He has a ton of shallow cuts and the angel’s breathing heavily like he’s actually winded. It’s strange how much damage one little wall throw caused.
“I don’t think Father would care. We stripped him of his power and doomed him to die of old age,” Castiel says bluntly, taking what he said at face value.
The elevator door opens, and he swallows nervously. His every instinct is telling him to tear open space and time and fly home. He notes the easy smile on his brother’s face and dares hope that he has not crossed several dimensions and ignored protocol for nothing. The easy smile leaves immediately when he sees him, and for a second, he is apprehensive, assessing if he is a threat. He can’t help but be reminded of himself every time Heaven makes a house call to Earth. Castiel continues to stare at this odd version of Lucifer who reminds him more of Michael than the brother he’d once known. They certainly had similar tastes in fashion. Standing his ground turns out to be the right call, Lucifer’s eyes light up in recognition and any and all suspicion melts away.
He slams open the door to his brother's charming little bookstore in Soho and sits down, gratefully accepting the tea they’d left out for him while giving a muted apology about barging in unannounced. Lucky for him, Aziraphale is more than happy to have angelic company who doesn’t want to harm him or destroy his way of life. It’s something they have in common. He risks a glance at Crowley, the classic car lover with a secret soft side that he’s learned to squash down for his own survival, and sighs. Among other things, he amends silently, grateful that angels here can’t read minds.
Castiel knew that was likely the case after that speech about family, but his heart still stutters, and he imagines his glittering wings begin to dull at the thought that the man he loves will never love him back, not in the way he needs. He must be a glutton for punishment because he decides he requires a more definite answer.
Lucifer catches Cas’s gaze and they share a quick telepathic convo. Suddenly, the guy is over the moon. Dean really hopes babies didn’t come up, because even thinking of the wedding makes him want to find the closest approximation of the Impala he can find and high tail it outta here. Nevermind, he has no way of jumping universes on his own.
Lucky for them, they clean up nice and have the right look to get waved into the club fairly easily. He’s glad Lucifer doesn’t seem to know their faces because he’d prefer to avoid breaking in after hours if they can help it, especially when they don’t really know what the devil’s deal is in this world. He regrets misplacing the Colt now, holy water and Devil’s traps aren’t going to cut it. At least, Sam still has Ruby’s knife neatly tucked away in his jacket.
“Believe it or not, even though I chose you over my family, I still miss them. Visiting these worlds allows me to forge connections with members of my family that are otherwise lost to me in our world. Will you deny me this small happiness?” Cas asks.
"I tried to salvage my reputation by threatening to give them to Castiel so they could slowly wither and die in an underground bunker."
“Nothing’s wrong with you Dean, but you could benefit with individual visits with Linda. You harbor an absurd amount of hatred for yourself and your crippling abandonment issues could overtime put a strain on our relationship.”
He pours himself another drink. Mind mulling over what little information Castiel had offered on his paramour. If this Righteous Man truly is Michael’s sword, his Father couldn’t be behind the two of them meeting. He smirks, if anything should the two get together, it would completely upend that version of Father’s plans, possibly permanently. He sighs again, thinking of Chloe. Why couldn’t he stay away? Was she really a golden chain designed to wrap around him and rob him of his power? Or was this Dear Old Dad’s idea of a joke? She’s everything you ever wanted, and I made her for you. He chucks the empty glass on the floor in frustration.
He shamelessly launches himself at the angel. Cas catches him instinctively, completely lost. This is so far beyond how he’d normally handle things that his partner has no idea what to do to placate him. It’s easy enough. Dean just wants him to say yes dammit.
Dean starts hopping without actively thinking about it. Amenadiel eyes widen, and he’s decidedly less chill as he turns attention to Cas. He already has the ‘I’m disappointed in you’ look down as he switches to responsible big brother mode.
“I suppose so. The things I do remember are incomplete and out of context. Can you fill in the blanks for me?” he asks.
He’s so wrapped up in his head that he doesn’t notice the sudden fire in Cas’s eyes like he can single handedly stop middle age from slowing him down and wearing him out.
Linda makes a face, and Cas chuckles as he turns his attention to Charlie who’s staring at him as if he’s the most fascinating thing on the planet. He holds up a finger, and Charlie grabs it eagerly. Unfortunately, despite all his big talk, Cas seems to prefer to casually observe children from afar while Dean does all the actual work. He’s honestly surprised that Cas’s unexpected baby sitting gig went as well as it did.
What’s with Cas and making unilateral decisions designed to break his heart into a million pieces? He doesn’t want this. Why would he do this? Why can’t they be a normal couple who talks about things first? Dammit!
The devil doesn’t bother to argue with him. Instead, they jump off of the balcony without warning, and Dean’s reminded that he’s deftly afraid of heights. Worse than that, his angel is dying on him again, and he’s just giving up like his life means nothing. It’s maddening, hella frustrating, and exactly . . . what he did.
Dean sighs, a little weary of the fact that every version of God seemed to be some kind of meddler by nature. Damn creative types never know when to leave well enough alone.
Honestly, they might have gotten together sooner if Sam had decided to become a lawboy after all and quit hunting. He lets that thought slip his mind when he feels Cas’s chapped lips on his forehead. Dean shuts his eyes and inhales a shaky breath. The moment ends and Cas withdraws.
Lucifer tries hard not to laugh in his face. Sam just gives him a disbelieving look that says ‘Really? You’re going to flirt now.’ Dean simply grins and offers him a tiny shrug. So, he’s having a little fun with Hell’s angel before they snap him out of it. He doesn’t see the harm. Unfortunately, the next words out of the angel’s mouth nearly give him a heart attack and remind him that Cas has indeed been hanging out with the devil.
Dean’s grin if possible grows wider, and he wiggles his eyebrows suggestively. He’d definitely be into that. Cas turns even more red and breaks eye contact with him. Well, if that isn’t a first, he thinks to himself, taking a sip of his drink, feeling accomplished.
“It’s okay Dean, but please stop talking,” Linda says with the anxiety of a new mother that’s not about to hesitate when it comes to her baby.
The ‘And you’ is implied, but he’s too full of rage to completely back down. Sure, Dean isn’t perfect, but what gives Lucifer the right to actively sabotage them? He’s paranoid enough as it is without Lucifer slowly building up a little black book for Cas to look through the moment Dean makes a mistake.
Dean narrows his eyes. They don’t think he’ll actually go through with it. Little do they know, God's personal dream crusher, Dean is all about results. It’s not the angel juice talking.
He’s a blip in the angel’s long and mind bending history, an unimportant, forgettable, painful chapter that he’s buried deep in his mind.
Dean swallows nervously. He can't deny the angel anything, not anymore, not when he's lost so much for his sake. And you'll never catch him saying it in his universe, but these angels are actually nice if a little strange.
Cas has a tendency to omit things in order to protect Dean from harsh judgment. He mentally adds that to the list of things he should probably bring up in therapy.
An uncomfortable silence follows, and he half hopes that one of the angels will barge in and free them from the oppressive silence. Hopefully Aziraphale and not the one he royally pissed off by implying he was secretly an archangel. He's not sure he believes it even though he's technically already lived through that plotline with Gabriel aka The Trickster.
His gaze hardens, and Dean swears he can feel electricity in the air. There’s yet another agitated wing flick as Cas grabs him by the shoulders, probably just barely holding back the urge to shake him.
He stops pacing, frowning at him, looking slightly guilty like he’s wronged Dean somehow. He gives him a thumbs up to reassure him he’s fine. He just creases his eyebrows in worry.
“ I can see that you two need some time to clear the air on your own. I’m going to go check on Crowley. You two take as long as you need, and you can join us for dinner later,” Aziraphale offers, hastily retreating now that he’s caught wind of the fact that their lover’s quarrel isn’t ending any time soon.
“Unlike Lucifer, I know when the game’s over. You were never going to let him out of your sight long enough for me to do my thing. So, I thought I’d be more direct.”
Nevermind, they’d both fit into the category before. Dean’s getting too old to keep mourning like a widow every time the angel up and dies on him.
Michael chuckles, lazily pressing his curved blade against Cas’s throat. It’s anyone’s guess whether he’ll follow through. Dean’s not about to take that chance.
More fractured memories break through the void. They’re just as painful as the last one that managed to slip out. Maybe, the giant abyss is meant to shelter him from his dismal past. He wishes walls weren’t so easy to break. In some ways, this feels like karmic retribution.
And yeah, he’s getting a semi-sympathetic look so he definitely made the right call keeping it short. Cas meanwhile has nabbed his hand in a, ‘No, I’m the lucky one’ kind of way he doesn’t have the energy to argue about right this minute.
“Of course not, your candid and compassionate nature is why you’re a favorite of mine. If you want to play therapist for the night, feel free,” he assures him, and Cas gives him a little smile like he’s a good supportive big brother.
“He doesn’t want to go back to Earth. He wants to stay in Heaven with me. I suggested temporarily removing my grace and joining him but-”
Last time nearly destroyed him. He’s not going through that again. He tries to walk away, but the angel is in front of him before he can even blink. Dean scowls. He did not miss Cas being able to sneak up on him at the drop of a dime.
Cas shoots him a dry look that tells him that he’s completely missed the mark as far as what’s going on. Dean shuts up, and his boyfriend doesn’t bother to dignify what he said with a response.
As soon as he steps out of the portal, he kicks himself for having no real plan. This is a terrible idea in every sense of the word. He knows nothing of this world’s rules or the possible evil lurking within. Hell, he’s not even sure which sibling he is looking for. All he really knows is that one of his brother’s is in love with a human and that human loves him back, and he has a vested interest in finding out how it’s going. He licks his lips, thinking of Dean . . . if it’s worth it.
“You bastard, you’re going to let your little brother die because you don’t like me. Well, screw you, I at least know one other angel who will give a damn.”
Castiel can tell he’s lying, but he feels it’s impolite to point it out when the man is trying to be friendly. He only hopes that he’ll tell him the truth about who they were to each other. He has no other way of knowing otherwise.
There's comfort in that. He can help as much as he can and send them on their way. No chance of ruining a good thing. The kids won’t ever have to know he’s not as good as they think he is.
Dean smirks at the weak jab. Cas believes in him wholeheartedly, and the angel is not very good at bluffing.
“Too long but I can’t say I didn’t enjoy parts of the ride,” Cas says as he allows his wings to slip into another dimension now that he’s proven his point.
“I suppose we could go visit Linda and Amenadiel after our therapy appointment so you can meet baby Charlie. He’s surprisingly normal for a nephilim,” Cas says idly, less cagey than before.
“If that were true, Dean, we wouldn’t be having this conversation. It’s sweet that you want things to go better this time, but I’ll always be grateful that I met you. No matter what any of my family thinks of you.”
The devil’s eyes flash red with the promise of Hellfire and torture, and Dean instinctively pulls back. He’s super not over his forty years in Hell, and the reminder kicks his PTSD into overdrive. Suddenly, he wants to be anywhere but here.
"Yes, please, anything that's not a burger. It's a wonder they managed to keep you alive if that's all you ate," Aziraphale chides.
He doesn’t finish the thought. He’s never heard exactly what happened, but he’s seen the emotional scars that angel witch left behind, and it’s reason enough to hate her.
He nearly trips over himself as everything clicks. Turns out, they’re both idiots who think they’re the worst person to ever exist. He mentally adds self worth issues to their respective lists.
“You’ll never catch me saying it to his face, but Lucifer seems like a good guy. Well, as good a guy as the devil can be, I guess. I’m glad he was here to look out for you when we didn’t really know how to help. ”
Castiel tenses when he feels Lucifer’s hand on his shoulder. He looks up and is surprised by what he finds. His brother actually looks worried for him, sympathetic, as if recognizing something of himself in Cas. He stiffens further at that realization. Is Lucifer what his family sees every time they level scorn on him? Is the doubt he is beginning to feel just a symptom of something that was always underneath?
Can angels heal here? Would Michael do it if he did him a favor? Could Lucifer or did he lose that ability when he got kicked out of Heaven? Should he take the chance?
Aziraphale spares either of them from having to answer. Dean blinks, and they're suddenly inside the Ritz. No one nearby bats an eye.
“ Michael got into my head. I’m sorry. I should be stronger than this,” Cas says like this is all his fault.
Dean’s had it. Cas knows from experience he can’t handle this kind of scrutiny, not when it comes to his feelings. He’s about to ask the devil to back off and give them some privacy when Dean beats him to the punch.
If his little brother hadn’t taken a painstaking amount of time singing Dean’s praises and gushing about his brilliant perfect little soul, he would have flat out told him that the idiot lumberjack wasn’t worth it. As it stood, he’d interfered enough, and any partner that would take on Dear Old Dad when he was clearly in the wrong was a good egg in his book.
The dude’s totally checking him out. Cas shoots daggers at the interloper as invisible wings surround Dean protectively.
Cas is beyond pissed, and suddenly, a normal sunny day in L.A. gives way to a freak storm. Thunder rolls ominously, and Dean’s reminded that he’s engaged to an unknowable eldritch being.
“Are you under the impression I’ll have a change of heart? Shame Cassie here found you first. You radiate such pain and terror. I would have loved digging my claws in, ” he says sweetly.
Dean suddenly feels inadequate and insanely jealous, but his brain helpfully reminds him that he has a title of his own.
The elevator doors open, and he’s immediately sucker punched in the face by said angel.  On second thought, maybe, he doesn’t.
Wow, he really is just some guy the cute monster fell in love with because they have no frame of reference when it comes to these kinds of things and therefore, developed an emotional attachment to an undeserving schmuck.
Lucifer’s wings flare up defensively. He studies them, feeling nothing but passive appreciation. They’re pristine and subtly glow with miraculous holy light, but Cas’s wings blow them out of the water in every way, not that he’s biased or anything.
Simple innocuous memories, suddenly become painful. He remembers the kid coming up to him, asking if he'd ever thought of wearing shades. He'd told him he didn't see the point when he spent a chunk of his time in an underground bunker. Jack never brought it up again but started wearing a pair of dark shades every time he got the chance. Dean asked him where he got them once, assuming Cas had bought him a pair. The kid never gave him a straight answer. He'd even asked him what kind of car he'd want if he could have any one he wanted. The kid had asked for a Bentley. Dean promised him that he could have the one collecting dust in the Bunker as soon as he got the hang of driving. He'd been so happy. Even the kid knew Crowley was better than him.
He fully expects Cas to correct him and explain what they’re actually doing. Instead, it becomes super clear to Dean that he and Cas have very different ideas of what counts as fostering.
The next night he sings ‘I was Born To Love You’ to Dean before they head home, and it makes Lucifer uncomfortable for reasons that have nothing to do with either of them. He simply smirks at the devil on his way out the door. Fingers crossed his older brother takes his own advice before Chloe finds a nice prophet of her own . . . or a man that literally looks like Superman as Dean so helpfully put it.
The man lets him go, and Castiel takes that as his queue to remove himself from Dean as much as he doesn’t want to. He sits down next to him, determined to find out what exactly he did so he can give Dean a sincere apology.
Oh wow, Lucifer literally took a baby on a murder investigation, even he’s not that crazy. Sure, he reluctantly let Jack tag along on a few cases, but it had been Sam’s idea. Then again, in his mind, he was going to have to kill the kid sooner or later so it totally hadn’t been a bonding thing. Whatever, he might not be father of the year, but he can definitely handle taking care of a baby. He tries not to think about the time a demon almost made off with a kid he was babysitting. Dean has a feeling this world isn’t nearly as dangerous as theirs. No sense giving in to his paranoia.
The dude ignores his confused stare and continues his villain monologue, absently moving the knife along Cas’s throat now that he has him good and pinned.
“Timeline’s different here from what Castiel’s told me. It’s actually been a few decades since he’s popped in. I’d assumed Naomi had got to him again, and he’d find time to drop in when he finally snapped out of it. I do wish he’d just stay here, but he’s always been a stubborn one. ”
The guy’s dressed all in white, and there’s a nasy scar on his face. His gut tells him this is the inlaw that has a bone to pick with him.
“Boy, I can see why you two gave Dad so much trouble. Insufferable lovebirds, the both of you,” he says, shaking his head.
The last line echoes in his head, haunting him. Were they ever friends? Was he just someone that had caused this man pain? He starts seeing his last meeting with Dean a lot differently.
As much as he appreciates the friendly greeting, he wants a moment alone with Dean. Cas is entirely uninterested in making small talk with this man. He gets another snippet from the void.
“Fair, but hypothetically, when would you like to get married? Like a date?” Dean says because if Cas thinks he’s not giving Sam a heads up about this just in case he has another thing coming.
Dean almost falls out of his chair again, but he’s there to catch him. His eyes are comically wide, and he swallows nervously.
The void is far too daunting. He’s not sure he wants to see the other side. Everything he’s ever tried to do for this man has ultimately ended in failure. All Castiel is good for is ripping away pieces of him: his Apple Pie Life, his faith, his trust, and worst of all, his family.
Crowley scoffs skeptically, but Aziraphale beams at him, not at all bothered that he’d come to complain about Dean.
“But surely you can understand his side of things, now. I would wait before mentioning again. Let the idea simmer under the surface for a while. He’ll come to a decision on his own, one way or another,” Crowley insists.
Hmm, Dean does feel the steady thrum of grace flowing through him. He recognizes the signs from his brief stint with Michael. It should worry him more than it does, but he trusts his angel, and it’s not like this is the first time Cas has slipped him a little angel grace. Apparently, this time it was a little too much.
“Angels are all about mind over matter. We are what we believe ourselves to be, but with you, Cas doubts,” Michael says like that explains anything.
Something about the look on his face makes Lucifer stiffen, and the devil ends up feeling the need to justify his actions to him. It’s pretty surreal to see the devil looking sheepish.
“Care to explain why you were holding up an angel blade looking like you were about to wipe Castiel from existence? ”
It’s clear whose side he’s on, but it’s also clear that Crowley is speaking from experience. With that in mind, Castiel decides to heed his advice. He nods solemnly and takes another sip of tea. It’s gone cold. Aziraphale instantly warms it up for him.
Lucifer steps away from the piano and pours himself a drink. He silently offers them each a glass. Cas shakes his head, grabbing Dean’s arm before he can accept, basically saying no for the both of them. Lucifer raises an eyebrow, surprised when Dean doesn’t kick up a fuss. He shouldn’t be. Now that he’s punched the devil in the face and ruined his chance of making a good face to face impression, his one remaining goal for this visit is to not make a damn scene in front of his in-laws. He’s actively ignoring the fact he blurted out a proposal at Linda’s.
Cas slices at Michael again, but the blow doesn’t land, and the archangel’s divine strength allows him to easily overpower his mysteriously depowered angel. He wrestles the angel blade out of Cas’s hand and plunges it into his abdomen.
Aziraphale definitely realizes something's off, but luckily, the angel decides to mind his own business.
Dean bites his tongue, keeping his eyes on Michael. He’ll make damn sure the angel knows he has nothing to apologize for later. First, Michael needs to go.
Cas hands him a small bottle of holy water with a promise to bring him more next time. Crowley takes the offering and hastily stuffs it in his jacket. Aziraphale frowns in disapproval but doesn’t begrudge him the extra protection.
“Call me crazy, but if he’s flaunting his wings and singing Queen in front of a bunch of normies, he’s nowhere near sane.”
“Bullshit,” Dean says. Sam shoots him a look telling him not to piss the guy off, but he’s not about to go easy on the devil. It doesn’t matter who’s face he’s wearing.
“Don’t scold me. He’s practically my husband,” he says putting his invisible wings back in attack mode. Amenadiel must notice because he backs off a little.
Cas chuckles as Dean slowly lures him into a false sense of security. The naive angel really thinks he’s going to let this go.
“You could always adopt. Jack was a special case, and while you two love Claire like a daughter, you didn’t get to raise her either. It’s understandable to want another,” Linda says, well meaning but more than likely unaware of just how painful their last baby adventure was.
That’s not quite true, but surprisingly, Dean doesn’t push. He swallows nervously, staring down at his hands securely holding onto Cas’s arms as if he’s afraid he’ll vanish with a flutter of wings.
Dean flinches, wondering if the stink of Hell is still on him even after all this time. How could he ask something like that so casually? He has to remind himself the rules of this world are different. Demons are simply fallen angels that dared to question God. And yeah, he’s damn sure that most of them are nasty pieces of work, but from what Jack’s told him, Crowley’s practically a saint. The only thing keeping him from Heaven at this point seems to be lack of interest, and his slightly warped morality. In Crowley’s mind, he’s probably paid him a compliment.
“It was wrong of me not to mention them to you, for you to find out this way. I promise when you meet Lucifer and Amenadiel that it will be under more pleasant circumstances.”
“Maybe, we should reschedule our appointment for another time. You’re too worked up about this. It would be pointless. ”
“You’ve never been enough for him, and yet paradoxically, you’re his everything. He takes and takes while giving you crumbs, but you still give and give until you’re nothing but a shell of your former self. You’re more pathetic than the giving tree. ”
Nevermind the fact that’s his third trench coat. He’s not about to undermine Cas in front of his older brother. Dean’s no nark, and he does indeed like the unflattering dorky thing.
Dean tries not to think of Adam. To this day, he can’t conceive of the boy saying yes. So, the only conclusion he can draw is that Michael took Adam as a consolation prize when Dean went back on his word.
Yes but also no, he doesn’t really want to talk about that now. As much as he enjoyed Dean spilling his guts to him, it was entirely involuntary, and therefore, less satisfying than he would have thought.
“Yeah, I mean a good chunk of the ones here think of me as the slut that corrupted you, or they’re, you know, dead,” he says with a shrug.
Castiel smirks. He’s yet to see anyone succeed in such a venture, but maybe, this human will manage it. He’ll enjoy the show no matter the outcome. Crowley watches him watch Aziraphale and smirks himself.
“Don’t feel too bad about that. It is my M.O. after all,” Michael says, tucking the curved blade into some hidden pocket. He tosses Cas’s angel blade at Dean. He catches it easily.
No, it’s the kind where you settled because you didn’t know any better, and it’s too late to take it back.
Instead, the devil sets his drink down and leans back, cool as a cucumber. Maybe, he’s more mature than Dean thought.
Just another form of rebellion for him probably, perhaps, his fondness for his human is greatly exaggerated, more of Lucifer lusting for life than humanity. He’s always been fond of Earth. It was only a matter of time before some of that fondness extended to its inhabitants.
Crowley scowls at him, but the other angel seems immune, still happily holding his hand. The demon keeps sulking.
The comment completely wrecks Cas’s concentration, and Michael easily parries with his own curved blade. He knocks his angel to the ground and nicks him on the shoulder. He bleeds, and there’s yet another cut that refuses to heal, marring the angel’s skin.
To be honest, he’s iffy on how true that is, but he has trouble picturing relationships without sex in general. Cas was a twelve year anomaly and a good chunk of that was repression and Cas’s seemingly lack of interest outside of Endverse Cas. (We don’t talk about Endverse Cas.) So, maybe, Cas’s past romances aren’t something he’ll ever be able to picture.
Castiel doesn’t give him any further details. He’s not sure if it's out of caution or embarrassment. The fact is that Castiel and Dean’s profound bond has become quite the scandal in Heaven. He deliberately marked a vessel meant for another, went on to proudly display the size of his wings in a subconscious attempt to woo said vessel, and for all intents and purposes, has been at the beck and call of the Righteous Man since he freed him from Hell. It doesn’t help that Dean seems to actively detest Michael and has foolishly dubbed him Cas, actively removing any association with his Father from his name. As far as Heaven is concerned, Dean has claimed him right back.
“Well, I remember that I love you . . . and bees, possibly cats,” Cas goes on, trying to relieve the tension by undercutting the confession.
Oh, that hadn’t even crossed his mind yet, but the angel’s not wrong. Dean has a large network of friends (larger now that Jack has revived a huge chunk of them), most of whom probably have bets going on when they’d finally get hitched, assuming they ever did.
He holds onto Lucifer for dear life; eyes shut tight, silently praying to Cas to be okay. After traveling a few blocks, they land on the roof of some nondescript building.
“Wow, seriously? You’ve been making the angel snobs eat nothing but burgers this whole time. I knew you were a Winchester at heart.”
“It’s not that. I’m just surprised he’s as coherent as he is,” Amenadiel says, silently examining him for traces of angel cooties or whatever grace is here.
“Congratulations on the engagement by the way. I’ll be stepping in as the wedding planner naturally. I’m thinking a blue-green outdoor celebration, and I’m willing to make it somewhat Scooby Doo themed, but I refuse to hire a sweaty man in a dog costume. You’re adults.”
It doesn’t bother him as much as it would have when he first popped into this universe. He ignores Crowley and turns his attention back to Cas, fishing for the fancy fork he’s been carrying.
“I mean Cas is like a millennia old. I didn’t think I had a shot, and well, things got messy after that,” he says with a shrug, not bothering to elaborate further. It’s not like the devil doesn’t already know.
He wants so badly to plunge the angel blade into that damn sucker and prove him wrong but Michael has Cas within easy reach. By proxy, he’s at Michael’s mercy. There isn’t anything he wouldn’t do to keep the angel safe at this point. Besides, he’s afraid the angel might do something stupid if Dean endangers himself. Cas is in too rough of shape to go for a Hail Mary if things go sideways. So, he keeps the borrowed angel blade trained on Michael, hoping it’ll be enough to protect them both.
Eventually, the devil notices him and has the gall to wave. He says something to the miserable dude next to him, and the guy shuffles off. He beckons them over, still all sinful smiles and party boy attitude. He and Sam share a look, silently deciding it's worth the risk. They reluctantly follow the devil into his penthouse suite on top of the club. It’s about as classy as you’d expect from a man in a well fitted suit. It’s strange to see pieces of obelisk used as support beams in what otherwise looks like a typical penthouse. If he weren’t visiting the devil, he’d assume the ancient stone is no more than a good replica. The devil makes his way over to his impressive collection of alcohol and pours them each a glass of whiskey. Neither of them accept the drink, even though Dean desperately needs one after watching Cas sinfully belt out his desire for love to a bunch of horny strangers.
Crowley turns sour, put off by Aziraphale's clever conflict resolution skills. Dean's busy admiring the architecture when he notices he's wearing a tux and so is Cas, and whoa, does his angel clean up nice.
Dean runs away like a little girl, but like Hell, he’s going to stay and turn into a sobbing wreck in front of the clueless angel and his stupidly supportive big brother. Thankfully, the God in this universe is a little kinder, and Sam follows him out without a word. It makes sense that Sam doesn’t put up much of a fight. He didn’t even want to come here in the first place.
They don't leave with Gabriel in the morning. Cas is more than capable of bringing the Winchester's home at their leisure. He practically has to shoo his brother out of this universe before he causes untold havoc on the populace. He introduces them to Amenadiel and a few of his friends, including Chloe. After helping solve a bizarre case, that coincidentally involved ancient magical artifacts instead of the usual homicidal maniac, Dean pulls him aside.
“Lucifer can be petty, but he has a good heart. He’s come a long way in the short time he’s been on Earth,” Cas says without missing a beat.
His stomach flips, and he has to remind himself he’s too old to be thinking about having a second-no third kid. Besides, why go through all that trouble when they’re in a prime position to spoil the Hell out of their friends’ and family’s kids without any of the responsibility?
“I detect traces of Michael’s grace in this room. He may be aware of our presence. We should be careful. I suspect he may try to target you.”
Unfortunately, it’s nowhere near the end of Lucifer’s meddling. The devil’s head pops out of the elevator one last time and drops a bombshell on them.
His little brother takes a deep shuddering breath and proceeds to spill his guts for the next two hours. Even though he’s told an extremely condensed version of events, he’s amazed that his brother is still in one piece, although admittedly, he’d died a worrying amount of times. That’s not why Castiel is here though, and he realizes rather quickly that situation is not what he thought. No, if anything, Castiel wants to vent, and he was the easiest target for his anger, well, after the vampires that have definitely been vaporized with holy light by now.
Castiel waits for him to elaborate, but the demon refuses to say another word. Cas does what he does best and stares him down. Crowley’s dark shades easily shield him from the angel’s penetrating gaze. Despite this, the fallen angel instinctively tenses, disliking the sudden scrutiny. He knows he’s being rude, but if Crowley can help him, he's not above intimidating a demon, even one he’s quite fond of. Aziraphale can’t stand the tense silence and intervenes again.
“You dressed me up as a cowboy and took me to a cowboy themed hotel with our son,” Cas says, daring him to give a platonic explanation for that.
“That is correct, and we can still go meet our nephew. I enjoy seeing you interact with children,” Cas says, smiling softly.
“I had complete faith in you, and you lied to me. You pretended we were still in this together while you went behind my back and put your faith in a demon, and it got you killed.”
“I should have told him sooner. And, now, he’s- I wasn’t ready for him to die so soon. What do I do now?” he says helplessly, sitting on the couch as his anger morphs into full blown panic.
“I see. He really is determined to ruin everything. I’ll inform Amenadiel of the situation personally. I’d sooner go back to Hell than see my nephew baby napped for the second time this decade.”
Does Cas automatically get the front seat now? Should they legally adopt Jack? (Yeah, he’s God. So what? It’s not like he doesn’t visit.) More nicknames? Less nicknames? Should all his gifts be bee themed? Do angels have courting traditions he should look up? Wing sex is a thing apparently? Shut up, brain, we’ve been quiet too long.
He’s not familiar with this world, but he’s pretty sure showing off your angelic abilities in front of mortals who aren’t in the know is just asking for trouble.
“He may have casually asked me how attached I was to my male vessel on the off chance we didn’t work out.”
Nope, he definitely doesn’t want him hanging out with Crowley any more than necessary. So, he agrees a little too quickly. Dean only hopes he doesn’t regret it later. There’s only so many times he can watch his angel die on him.
Castiel tries his best not to look crestfallen. Maybe, the man in front of him is simply a terrible flirt. Of course, he’s found someone better by now. Hell, maybe, Castiel was never in the running, and he’s deluding himself.
“One last thing, should I reschedule your interview with the adoption agency? Or is that still on the table?”
Cas nods, annoyingly understanding of Dean’s reservations. He feels a twinge of irritation, wondering if this is something he’s run by Crowley too. He tries not to let it get to him, reminding himself that he and Aziraphale are a thing, a six thousand year thing apparently.
Cas’s wings slump in defeat after suffering a particularly long tangent from Lucifer. He subconsciously grips Dean more tightly as if he’s afraid he’ll wander off into the crowd when he’s more than content to stay in the angel’s arms.
Dean hugs back awkwardly, pushing down how much it saddens him how grateful Cas still is for even the slightest acknowledgement that he cares about him. He may not deserve his angel, but he’ll be damned again, before he takes him for granted this time.
Castiel grimaces. It’s not what he wants to hear, but he senses the sincerity of his brother’s words. He is clearly speaking from personal experience. And yet, he is unclear as to why his Father would deliberately set him up for failure. Then, he realizes; why of all the angels that could have saved Dean, he was chosen. He is loyal, disciplined, and trustworthy. No matter how blindingly beautiful Dean’s once broken soul is to him, like a piece of Kintsugi pottery laced with his grace, he will not fail Dean.
“Understandable, but why hesitate now? There is literally nothing stopping you. No Dad, no Aunt Amara, no Michael, Hell not even me, well other me. ”
Dean is beyond confused. Isn’t this situation supposed to be the equivalent of your boyfriend moving back in with his family? What does Jack have to do with any of this?
“I take it you’re here to see Castiel?” His tone is perfectly friendly, but he can tell the dude’s not happy about it. Sam frowns, probably thinking the same thing.
Cas’s ice cold exterior melts when he sees how nervous Dean is. He’s sure the death grip he has on his hand also probably clued him in that he needs some reassurance
Oh, he never told Lucifer they weren’t planning to see him. This should be good. If there’s one personality trait Cas inherited from Chuck it's his tendency to avoid the real issue for as long as possible, preferably until there’s a literal apocalypse on their doorstep, and there’s no running away anymore.
He instantly pales at the possibility, not knowing Lucifer is very much hung up on a certain detective who’s been making googly eyes at Cain recently, and that doesn’t even take into count whatever his brother and Cain currently have going on that involves half of Maze’s torture kit.
Apparently, his angel didn’t fully absorb the temporary voluntary aspect of the gig. Kids aren’t stray dogs they can just pick off the street.
“Well, if it helps, so, am I. We’ve both been keeping secrets for far too long,” he says, choosing to keep his words vague. He doesn't want to burden his little brother with his soap opera of a life, not when he has a Righteous Man to sweep off his feet.
Cas lips twitch, debating whether or not to let Dean in on Lucifer's existential crisis.  He decides that he doesn't want to give Lucifer another reason to dislike Dean.
Cas’s wings puff up for some reason, and he stands there speechless, blushing madly. Dean throws him a wicked grin. He should have done this years ago. The hunter in him reasonably reminds him that his sudden interest in marriage and babies is suspicious as Hell, but it’s such a rush to please his angel he ignores his instincts.
“Unfortunately, Lucifer is very aware of everything that happened during our tumultuous courtship, and while I have done equally horrendous things to you, your actions as a whole do not paint the prettiest picture. ”
He ends up out of earshot before he hears the end of his little rant, but he’s quite pleased with himself as he dashes upstairs. He’s chosen not to linger in the bookshop although he can tell with one glance that the other angel’s collection is worth its weight in gold. If he’d found this shop in his world, he definitely would have been one of the annoying customers that kept coming back despite the abysmal service and intentionally malicious and confusing hours of operation.
That’s all it takes for the damn to break, and tears start spilling from his eyes like he’s the overly-emotional romantic lead in a love story from those rom-coms he would always make fun of but secretly enjoyed. In those stories, you get a guaranteed happy ending, and your communication issues with your future partner are solved before the hour and a half movie is over after you break it off with your conveniently terrible fiancé.
Dean flinches, not at all expecting the devil to outright offer to set Cas up right in front of him. He feels a little better when Cas rolls his eyes and gives Lucifer a knowing look.
Lucifer casually takes a sip of his drink and shoots Dean a derisive look. He still has a death grip on his coat. Dean lets him go and returns to his seat, all the while staring down the devil. Cas frowns, concerned by his maybe future boyfriend’s lack of preservation instincts.
“We-we can give it a try, just promise me you’ll tell me if it becomes too much,” he says, eyes stupidly watery.
“Last time I let him baby sit, he took Charlie on a case and sent me a picture of my baby eating Dan’s pudding.”
“You have a lot to offer a child, Dean. I value your practical experience with them and have no doubt in your ability to care for one.”
He can’t stand the depth of Cas’s love right now. It’s too much. Not here, not now, in this unfamiliar world, he’s been hiding away in. When they go home, he and Cas can pick up where they left off but not before.
If you told Dean a year ago that one day he would willingly enter a nightclub owned by the devil, he would have called you crazy, taken a swig of his beer and walked off. Yet, here he is waiting in line to enter some dumb club the devil opened for kicks that’s probably nothing more than a glorified drug den. To make matters worse, Sam is totally not on board with his plan to go in guns a blazin to rescue their angel. Yeah, he’d done some dumb shit, but he’d more than made up for it, and Dean had gone and left him in the damn psych ward as if no one would take advantage of a half-insane angel.
For once, Lucifer is speechless. He looks down at his empty glass, frowning as if debating whether or not to tell him something. Castiel stays silent, waiting him out. His patience is rewarded.
Within seconds, the devil has him by the throat, and no amount of struggling is going to get him free. He’s deceptively strong, just like the angels in their universe. Lucifer's wings come out, astonishingly bright and beautiful.
“Don’t let him intimidate you, Dean. If you’ve changed your mind, I can handle my brother,” Cas says, frustratingly sincere. So freaking sure he doesn’t want to go through with this.
Amara? Brutally devoured by her own sibling, and he hates himself for pushing her in that direction. Michael? Traitorous Angel Dick who’s stuck in the Empty for the foreseeable future. Same as every other angel, so Gabriel’s out too. Rowena? She’s already got a gig. He doesn’t even entertain the idea of giving Lucifer another shot at it. He shakes his head.
Dean seems to be in a much better mood now that they’ve talked things out. He throws a grin his way.
“And, her being a shrink to all your relatives and friends isn’t it?” he says because it’s true. Sam had said as much when he'd talk to him about going to therapy in another dimension.
His other hand cups his cheek, and he lightly brushes his thumb over Dean’s lips. He thanks this universe’s God that Aziraphale bailed already, or Dean would have definitely ruined this moment between them just because there was another person in the room.
Aha! He’s not the only one internally panicking about the possibility of the whole thing getting away from them and becoming a mad circus.
“I wasn’t expecting you to be the one to come get me, but I’m glad you did. There’s something we need to discuss, and it might be better to have this particular conversation where Jack can’t eavesdrop.”
“Listen here, Bizarro, you leave the kid out of whatever ineffable plan you think you’re following,” Dean says as he tries and fails to get out of his angel’s grip. It kind of ruins his intimidation factor. Luckily, Cas is intimidating enough for the both of them right now.
Dean is totally on cloud nine right now. How could he not be when the best thing that ever happened to him is right here, safe and sound, practically glowing with grace? He’s sure he couldn’t see it before, but he can’t look away now. Maybe, he never will. Is this how Cas felt  every time he gazed into his soul? He regrets calling him a creep if this is what he had to deal with all the time.
That gets a smile out of Dean, and he shrugs, figuring that he doesn’t really know enough to weigh in on the whole evil twin fiasco even if he wanted to. Already, he’s way more involved than he wants to be.
He decides to play dumb. Years of pretending nothing’s going on between them has made him an expert.
No one will ever rob him of his freewill again if he has anything to say about it. His own words mock him from the void, all encompassing and vile.
“You seem to be under the false impression that this universe revolves around you. It does not. If you’re so desperate to be the center of attention again, go back home,” the devil says, jabbing a finger into his chest. The red eyed monster is inches from his face and practically breathes on him in disgust.
They both confidently sit down at the nearest table without waiting for a server to seat them, and a young man eagerly comes up to the two angels unbearably excited.
“Let’s have a few sessions with Linda before you meet my brother. I worried you’ll end up spiraling and as much as he dislikes you, not even Lucifer would wish that upon you.”
“ I’ve been researching ways for Jack to transfer his powers to someone else. Finding a solution has taken longer than I expected even with Aziraphale’s resources.”
Cas takes the opportunity to slice at his kneecaps. Michael doubles over in pain, cursing more than he’s ever heard an angel curse.
“Yes, Lucifer has most likely returned by now, and knowing him, he’ll hunt us down if we don’t hurry back,” Cas says, still refusing to look at him.
“He is the Righteous Man. My garrison was in charge of retrieving him from the throws of Hell. I gripped him tight and raised him from perdition, and I’ve known no peace since.”
“If we don’t go through with the wedding, he’s going to kill me, isn’t he?” he says, only half joking. He’s already gotten a taste of Lucifer’s divine punishment, and he’s not sure cancelling the wedding would be a lesser crime in the devil’s eyes.
“Burgers from Tommi’s Burger Joint, most likely, it’s what I’ve been eating for the last three months. I’m sure Crowley must have cried tears of joy when he saw you. He’s been complaining loudly that he’s sick to death of burgers. Unfortunately for Crowley, Aziraphale is an absurdly good host and has been treating me to burgers every time I ask, which is pretty much every day.”
Cas is not at all amused by the suggestion. If looks could kill, the devil would have dropped dead already. The lights flicker but thankfully, don’t burn out.
“Actually, a quick Vegas wedding sounds perfect, but Sam would also kill me if we went through with it so no need to murder me, at least not for that.”
Cas narrows his eyes, more wing flicks. He vaguely wonders if it’s the bird equivalent of flipping him off.
If he plays his cards right, he can buy himself some time, and they can be engaged for another decade. Dean knows for a fact he’d be able to get away with it. Cas has ridiculously low expectations when it comes to their love life. Surprisingly though, his angel does the wing flick thing and crosses his arms.
He decides it’s better not to say anything yet, not until he finds the right words. After a few seconds of nothing, the devil scoffs, opting to ignore him in favor of Cas.
“Not soon enough, call me crazy, but people constantly telling me your fine after we had a huge fight without any supporting evidence makes me think I accidentally ended up in a djinn dreamland again, especially when you don’t answer my prayers.”
He knows it's irrational to be jealous of the most taken man in existence, but he can’t help it. Cas is amazing, and he’s stupidly confident that the angel could seduce the demon if he tried. He certainly managed it when he was one.
It doesn't seem like he's lying, but Dean understandable trust issues flare up, and he can't accept Cas's answer as is.
Cas stiffens, knowing exactly what the devil is about to do. The only question is whether or not he’ll stop him. He’s about to interfere when he gets the second half of the memory, the one that convinced him that he must have been evil incarnate.
“You take that back. Cas was never- I mean they put it in his head that I was a Righteous Man but-” he says, digging himself into a deeper hole.
Cas knows he’s serious, but he’s also known him long enough to realize that Dean won’t go through with it if he doesn’t want him to.
“Aren’t you worried someone will figure out his wings are legit? Angels are hard to kill, but it does happen.”
Panic seizes him, and he’s halfway to the elevator before he can even think. He can’t let Dean leave without talking to him first. If nothing else, he’d like to apologize before he’s gone forever.
“Is something wrong?” he asks, keeping his voice neutral. In his head, he’s already calculating the odds of doting Uncle Lucifer double crossing them.
“Very well, I’ll explain the situation to Linda, and if she agrees, we’ll stop by for a visit before heading to Lucifer’s suite.”
Dean catches the sleeve of his trench coat before he can retreat any further. There’s one more thing he needs to get off his chest while he’s still brave enough to say it.
"Also, weirdly fond of frozen burritos and burnt nachos, I wonder why that is," Crowley says in a disapproving way.
Dean rolls his eyes. His angel is beyond biased. He stopped being the Righteous Man a long time ago.
“In that case, we’d be happy to babysit any time. Just give us a call,” Dean says, offering her his most charming smile.
Cas is adorably exasperated, but his expression darkens into something akin to desire when he willingly falls to his knees. He hesitantly strokes his cheek, clearly tempted. Never let it be said he doesn’t know what his angel likes.
The Righteous Man had traveled across universes to find him despite all the awful things he had done. The sight of his wings had left him speechless and utterly mesmerized. From what he’d learned from Amenadiel, only the most devout humans reacted so strongly when faced with divinity. For anyone else, his wings were glorified props. Dean took one look at him and saw an angel worthy of his devotion.
Yes, that’s right, your favorite angel. He comically falls over himself to get to Cas quicker. He gently touches his neck, and Hell is replaced with Heaven. He’s missed the electric feelings coursing through him. Dean hasn’t had a serious injury in a while.
“I asked around while you were busy drooling. Lucifer is up there in the balcony sitting next to a guy that . . . kind of looks like Superman for some reason.”
“Always,” Cas says, pressing a small kiss onto his cheek which is nice, but he’s craving a Hell of a lot more than that after everything.
Thankfully, Cas seems to agree. He eagerly heads for the stairs with the kind of look he only gives to Dean, well Dean and any burger he can get his hands on.
Of course, Cas doesn’t get it. Sam loved him from the start simply because he was an angel even though he treated him like crap in the beginning for being Lucifer’s future vessel. Not only is Dean starting with negative points, he’s reasonably sure that if this devil had gotten a hold of Cas while they were on a break that his angel would be getting hitched to someone else by now, probably a saint, you know, someone actually worthy of him.
He’s kind of glad he’s not all human right now because his heart just stopped. He wrenches himself from Castiel’s grip and stands up, already calculating the most hurtful thing he could say to end this conversation. In the heat of the moment, only one thing comes to mind.
He shakes his head, pushing down the guilt. As much as he would have liked to bring Jack, they can’t afford to leave their universe unprotected, not with the Empty active and angry. He’ll make it up to him somehow. As for Dean, he can handle a few days without him. Everything would be fine.
“You’re more than the sum of your parts little brother. You can’t keep fixating on the past,” Amenadiel says.
Dean laughs at how easily Cas calls out their mutual bullshit. He taught the angel how to love so he can only blame himself for the angel constantly declaring his undying love for him when it’s too late, and he can’t possibly process it.
“Besides, at this juncture of our relationship, I would not allow a harem to develop,” Cas whispers into his ear as arms and wings wrap around him possessively.
Lucifer pinches the bridge of his nose, mentally counting to ten like he’s dealing with an escaped mental patient.
“We did find a spell that should work, but it’s not permanent. The power can be transferred back and forth at will. Jack can have a break, and I’d be free to join you on Earth when you're ready.”
“I don’t need another speech declaring your undying love for me. I know how you see me, but I can’t help feeling I’m getting the better deal here. You’re a freaking angel.”
Another agitated wing flick, the devil clearly wants to hit something. He’s just glad that Lucifer’s wrath is no longer directed at him. Dean can still feel the burning sensation along his throat, a taste of Hell that lingers.
He doesn’t know what else to say. It takes him a minute to even remember how the devil ended up being the topic of conversation.
Okay, maybe, they can pretend the wedding is still happening for another few minutes while he indulges in pie. Unfortunately, Cas snatches his hand and shoots him a disbelieving look that says we are not lying to the devil so you can have desert.
Dean hates that he’s not actually sure if he’s talking about him, even if it looks freaking obvious on the surface. He can’t be that lucky. He’s just some guy and Cas is-
“Stop changing the subject, this is all your fault,” Castiel snaps, once again confiscating his alcohol and taking a swig. He is actually starting to look tipsy. That's new.
“I haven’t changed my mind exactly, but maybe, we could be engaged for a while. We haven’t even gone on an official date yet.”
That small admission is enough to snap the box of his heart shut before hope can escape. He presses himself closer to Dean, and the man’s breath hitches.
Castiel cuts through time and space without even thinking about it. For once in his life, he wants to be as far away from Dean as possible. The man is impossibly stubborn and refuses to be happy. This is starting to frustrate him. Of course, he has no illusions about Dean. He’s always known that the man isn’t perfect. The moment he’d touched his soul he’d learned everything there is to know about Dean Winchester, flaws and all. He’d still fallen for him hard, metaphorically and literally. Even so, now that there is nothing in their way, his reluctance to compromise even a little is testing his already frayed patience.
“I would advise against any mention of Charlie for now,” he says, again looking past him as he does his best impression of a marble statue.
“You’ve nothing to apologize for. Michael is the one exhibiting erratic and self destructive behavior,” Cas reasons.
He shakes his head, still doubtful. Wings dragging on the cement forlornly as they casually walk to Lux.
Something inside him tells him to forget the dance floor and check the bar. Sure enough, he finds Dean at the bar with his face pressed against the bar top, clutching a cocktail. It’s one of the fruitier varieties. The tall man next to him looks at Cas in surprise. He recognizes him but can’t recall hearing his name.
When they come back home, they don’t go back to Heaven right away. Instead, they plant their own garden. They go visit Claire and Kaia. From there, Dean insists that Cas should see the kid Garth named after him. And, it only seems natural to return to the bunker and check on the garden after that. Sam mysteriously shows up one day with Eileen. Dean runs up and hugs him. For once, tears fall freely from his eyes, he knows what his brother gave up to be here. They stay at the bunker, and he doesn’t confront Cas when he starts feeling more human. He’s happy, and when they do go and visit Crowley and Aziraphale again, he brings Crowley a plant in thanks. To this day, Dean’s never seen him yell at it. Of course, all the other plants hate the tiny little succulent named after him. He wouldn’t have it any other way. Cas, in his infinite wisdom, makes the situation worse by bringing another plant from their garden to keep little Dean company. Crowley names that one Cas, and subtly, reasserts his authority by using the other plants jealously against them. It’s kind of hard for Dean to hate him after that. Cas’s a weird nerdy dude who deserves an equally unhinged dorky family, and he’s finally got it. If only Lucifer would stop trying to set Cas up with a nice prophet, his life would be perfect, but that’s a story for another time.
“What does that even mean? You’re not trying to do the whole keep me in the dark shtick are you? Because I will keep throwing fits in therapy until you cut that the Hell out.”
Cas gets desperate enough to try and break free again. Against all reason, Michael lets him go, not at all threatened by the depowered angel. The angel he infected with humanity.
“ I take no pleasure in hurting my baby brother. Well, maybe, a little, he’s a bit of a stubborn ass,” he says like this is a normal family get together, and he’s having a quick chat with them before he has to catch a plane.
Cas has the gall to laugh at him, wings rubbing up against him affectionately. He wonders how much of these little gestures he’d follow through with if he actually knew he could see what he was doing.  Amenadiel gives Dean a sympathetic look because he gets that he’s not trying to ruin everything with his big dumb vulgar mouth on purpose. He hopes he didn’t accidentally get them blacklisted from babysitting.
Lucifer has had a very bad no good day. Chloe finally knows what she was created to be and has decided her life is a lie, and there doesn’t seem to be anything he can do to change her mind. That knowledge won’t stop him though. Game night is in a few days, and the Detective never misses that. Surely, she’ll realize by then that being a Gift from God doesn’t change anything between them. Yeah, when he first found out, he completely moved house and ran away, but the Detective is a rational creature. She’ll eventually want to talk. He just needs to be patient, and in the meanwhile, he's going to be his best charming self. So what if he’s a few thousand years out of practice, Lucifer is nothing if not stubborn, and he knows what he has with Chloe is real, despite his Father willing her into creation in the first place. For the first time in a millennia, he thinks of Castiel and hopes the poor misguided bastard is doing better than he is with his celestially acquired bae.
The guy snickers revealing messy dark wings. Dean’s floored that seeing them has no real effect on him. He might as well be a beat up pigeon.
“He’ll likely be busy with a case that against all odds will end up being extremely relevant to whatever problem my brother is facing that week and provide him insight that would otherwise go over his head or take years of therapy to work through.”
“I’m sorry, what?” he asks, only half paying attention. His eyes want to go back to Cas, to his wings. The hunter part of him realizes something's off, but he really can’t help himself.
“Wait, you’re nephilim is a baby, baby? We were robbed,” Dean says without thinking it through, but Cas only winces silently, aware he can’t help himself.
Cas pulls his chin up so the man will have to meet his eyes. He wants to dispense some serious wisdom that the man seems to have forgotten despite the fact that he’s the one with amnesia.
The devil’s eyes flash red in warning, and Dean suddenly feels weak in the knees. Yeah, this guy definitely knows all of his worst sins.
“You’re welcome. I also took the liberty of putting Sam up in the Hilton for the night. So, you should be free of interruptions if you decide to take things further. ”
“I might never be ready Cas. Earth wasn’t a picnic for me, and I’d rather stay in Heaven where you’re safe. I don’t ever want to lose you again, and like Hell, we’re going back to, I have angel business to attend to, see you in six months.”
Cas is unphased. He gives him a long speech like he’s been expecting this. Then again, considering he pulled out a beautiful confession out of nowhere before the empty took him, it might just be the way Cas talks.
Coincidentally, he’s finally noticed that Sam was gracious enough to disappear into the crowd for a while. It makes him feel all the worse for ignoring him in the first place.
Lucifer huffs, put out by the reminder. It’s kind of funny how he’s still dealing with overbearing inlaws after defeating God, arguably the worst father in law ever. At least, this family member’s heart is in the right place.
Castiel doesn’t remember what he was feeling then. He only remembers dropping the knife and becoming Cas once more because he knew exactly what those words meant coming from Dean.
And just like that, Cas brings up the crux of their big fight. Dean doesn’t want to go back to Earth. Cas thinks he should. He takes a deep breath, cursing that he’s about to take Crowley’s advice again and be honest about why.
He doesn’t stick around after that, disappearing from sight in seconds, traveling much faster on his own now that he doesn’t have to worry about Dean. Cas places a steady hand on his shoulder, and he lets himself relax a little. His angel won’t let him go back to Hell, literally or figuratively.
Lucifer nods, picking up his drink, subtly breaking eye contact without actively advertising his little brother is making him nervous.
“Well, don’t leave me in suspense. What kind of problem requires you to travel to an entirely different universe? ”
Dean wraps his arm around his shoulder and gives him the most devastating smile he’s ever seen. He wants so badly to sear a mark into his flesh and hold onto him forever.
“Whatever, I don’t have a horse in this race. I’m not here to take sides. I just thought we should meet in person. Get the feeling, you’re not super thrilled I’m Cas’s fiancé.”
“I didn’t know you felt that way. If you’re worried about being unable to keep up, I am literally an angel. I can do the heavy lifting if you desire a child.”
The devil does the Picard facepalm, and Dean has to hold back a belly laugh. His angel loves him, and Lucifer can’t stand it.
It’s not Aziraphale who reacts. Crowley lets out a sharp laugh that almost sounds like a hiss. He finally removes his shades and sets them on the coffee table, shaking his head fondly.
Does he? Dean swallows, conflicted. He likes the idea of basically calling dibs on Cas forever. A giant party on Valentines day terrifies him. And Jack help him if the theatre kids find out about it through the grapevine, all he can picture is a screaming match between Lucifer and Marie over flower arrangements.
Oh, so, his first assumption was correct. If they were friends, they’re not anymore. He doesn’t bother to hide his disappointment.
Dean really doesn’t.  As long as his angel is with him, nothing else matters. He hasn’t dared admit that to himself before, but the angel brain rot makes everything easy.
Dean scowls, hating how vague he’s being about the angel dick. Like seriously, it would be nice to know what he’s up against instead of the angel blindsiding him at the last minute.
Cas snarls, uselessly struggling against Michael. He worries when he sees blood trickle down his angel’s throat. Hating the idea he’s the reason his angel can bleed at all.
He smirks, knowing exactly how to play this. All he has to do is keep pushing. Cas will always do what Dean wants in the end. And yeah, that’s probably a topic they should bring up in therapy, but he’s not going to look a gift horse in the mouth.
“I’m sorry you had to see that side of me, Sam. I know you’ve been through a lot. Angels are all about consent in your world until . . . they aren’t.”
“You’ve been gone for days, Cas. You couldn’t have left a note or something? The Empty could have taken you again for all I knew.”
Whatever, he wasn’t interested in finding out whatever drama Lucifer and Michael were going through this time. He’s sure the devil is probably the one that ended up with a nasy scar, and Cas was trying to be polite by not drawing attention to that fact.
"I got to visit Aziraphale and Crowley's cottage in South Downs. I especially liked the garden, reminds me of the first one," he tells him, easily climbing down the creaky stairs.
He’s sure such a statement would have once left him overjoyed. Now, he is ambivalent at best. From what he’s heard from Lucifer, being the favorite is rarely a good thing. On a whim, he decides he’d rather know if the man in front of him favors him or not.
“But I’m still here,” he says, absently tilting his head and narrowing his eyes to try to find some clue of what happened on Dean’s face.
“If you wanted him to go back to Earth, making yourself vulnerable was absolutely the last thing you should have suggested, he only wants to stay in Heaven because he knows you're safe there. Keep in mind it’s only been a few weeks since you were rescued from the Empty, and he wasn’t even the one to save you from it.”
“Let me save you a lot of trouble. This is clearly a trap from Father designed to set you up with this Righteous Man. Your relationship is doomed to failure. Don’t even bother pursuing it. You’ll just end up hurting each other,” He says with a note of finality.
He ignores the threat of violence directed at his brother. Castiel is confident that Dean will not act on that impulse if he asks him not to.
“You’re right. I’d rather not return while Dean is compromised. Our world is a bit less forgiving than yours. I accept your invitation, but please be on your best behavior,” Cas says with an air of resignation.
“Maybe but if I don’t, I’m not going to force it. I’ll find another way to get over my issues,” he says despite Linda being his best shot of getting help without the danger of ending up in a mental asylum for his ‘delusions’.
Lucifer chuckles, shaking his head like stealing kids is a perfectly acceptable hobby for angels to have.
Castiel nods. He understands that now. Besides, better that he chase away customers here, than for him to suddenly break into the homes of any patron who is foolish enough to ignore the return date or Heaven forbid, lose or damage the book in any way. He’s not sure the poor humans who tried such a thing would come out unscathed.
Dean’s face falls as a stab of disappointment runs through him. He didn’t think Cas would hesitate like this. Old insecurities crop up with a vengeance. Maybe, he’d been right all along about them being too different to make it work.
Neither of them talk until they hear the door snap shut. He realizes too late that he’s failed to make a good impression with either angel. Oh well, with any luck, they wouldn’t be visiting Heaven’s odd couple too often.
Dean hates that all the angels were right about him. He’s literally Cas’s kryptonite no matter where they are.
This can work. It’s not exactly what they might have had if they’d figured things out sooner, but it’s still good. They can be happy. He can make Cas happy.
Lucifer spends the next hour on the piano, thinking of his baby brother, Father, and most of all Chloe. The music channels his anger, twisting it into each musical note until he is left empty. He finally stops and eyes the broken glass on the floor. He could wait and have his cleaning service take care of it, but Chloe had finally agreed to see him after his little freak out move to Vegas, and he didn’t want her stepping on it accidentally. He goes to grab a broom, knowing he’s well and truly fucked.
He almost wishes Cas had reconnected with this classy devil during their pseudo divorce and met a Jesus type. Most of him is relieved that he gets to keep the one person who will always put him first.
This time the squint and head tilt is done for effect. He’s blushing again for all the wrong reasons. He shoves the angel off of him, more than a little mortified.
He nods and starts gluing another coin to the ground so he has an excuse not to look the demon in the eye.
“It took you twelve years to make a move. I may be an optimist but even I realized this was a long shot,” Lucifer says, continuing to drown his sorrows in alcohol as if Dean is a typical bad boyfriend cliché and not the love of Cas’s life.
Dean trusts Cas. He doesn’t know anything about the devil’s therapist. There’s also the issue that Lucifer might be pulling a long con and trusting her might end up dooming them both if things go sideways.
Lucifer smiles at him for the first time, and he becomes uncomfortably aware the devil is attractive.
Cas sighs, not at all happy to be having this conversation but resigned to the fact that there is no avoiding it now.
“So what? You’re going to leave me a single parent. Is that the super special awesome life you want me to have on Earth? Because any life without you in it is going to be Hell for me.”
Cas jumps when he tries to touch them. Okay, so, he can’t feel them this way, but his angel sure can, interesting. He likes the way wings work here, less burny, more fluffy. Getting a rise out of Cas is also a nice bonus. Emboldened, he invades Cas’s personal space and lightly strokes his invisible wings, quietly assessing where he’s most sensitive.
Dean swallows thickly. The room has gotten way too hot. Maybe, he should have seen this coming considering a wavelength of celestial intent has ensnared him in his all encompassing light. Lucifer snickers, and his face feels flush. He definitely heard everything.
“Promise me you’ll be kinder to yourself,” he says, sounding pained in a way that hints that Cas probably isn’t the only sibling dealing with shit.
Cas squints and tilts his head. It’s his turn to be confused by an out of nowhere comment. Unfortunately, his angel must have caught a glimpse of what he’s been thinking because the confusion goes away, and he chuckles.
“My family is getting along. It’s a miracle. And, here I thought, I was going to have to break up a fight and start hiding all the demon blades.”
He shuts his eyes on the off chance this little interdimensional tear in space is capable of burning his eyes out. He hears the familiar whoosh of wings, and maybe he’s imagining it, but he feels impossibly soft feathers on Cas’s back as he holds on for dear life. Only his angel can convince him to get anywhere off the ground.
Dean holds back a grimace. No way, he’s getting out of a big wedding now. Oh well, no reason to say something when it’s so far off. Too bad, Cas has other ideas.
Whatever, at least, he still has sweetheart and sunshine. He’s still trying to get babe and angel on the table, but it’s slow going.
Dean doesn’t seem to see it that way. He grows more sullen. The man tries to order another drink, but Castiel subtly shakes his head at the bartender, and he is cut off for the night. He’d like Dean to remember this in the morning.
Dean is gripped by guilt. If all of Cas’s siblings think he’s no good for the angel, even the ones from an entirely different universe, maybe, it’s the truth, and they’re both in denial. He doesn’t say that though. They’ve been through too much for him to accept the devil’s snide comments lying down.
He takes out his cell, but Cas yanks the phone out of his hands before his brother can dial their future shrink’s number.
He’s actually tempted to drop the whole thing for a second, but unfortunately for Cas, for good or ill, he’s still John Winchester’s son, and that unholy man didn’t raise a quitter.
“Now Dear, don’t assume Castiel came here because he’s having boyfriend trouble. Maybe, he just wanted to visit.”
“He’s upstairs researching with Aziraphale. It’s good you came. He was planning to come see you anyway,” Crowley offers helpfully before he can give in to his violent impulses.
Cas slinks further into the sofa in shame, looking down at his tea. He does tend to come here when he is in trouble. Time moves faster in this place. He can stay a few days, clear his head, and return to Dean in minutes if he wants. That way Dean never has the opportunity to miss him, and he can vent to people who in no way are associated with Dean.
His angel is so freaking stubborn. They could be there in a blink, but Cas doesn’t want him to fry his brain on angel mojo more than he already has. Honestly, he doesn’t think another few seconds will make a difference. What an overprotective pain in the ass, his double wasn’t the one who ended up hooked on drugs.
“And? We’ve all made mistakes. We raised him as a family, and he turned out to be the ultimate good. You’re being too hard on yourself. There is no mortal that has been through what you’ve been through and remained so pure.”
“First off Cas, if I was going to develop an opioid addiction, it would have happened way before I met you. You’re basically a walking pain killer.”
Dean laughs because yeah, that makes a whole lot of sense. He has no doubt Cas was the cutest angel in the garrison. Of course people were interested before him. Too bad for them, Dean’s about to put a ring on it.
Practically, a shortened version of hurt my brother, and I’ll kill you, but he can live with that. If he were in the devil’s place, he’d say the same thing to someone with his terrible track record.
PDA is still kind of hard for him to deal with. Infamously, sex crazed, Lucifer smugly eyeing them with approval isn’t helping.
Lucifer’s drink shatters in his hands, and his eyes turn into Hellfire. The devil is losing patience with him.
“Nice to see you too Cassie, but I’m kind of in the middle of an evil twin situation here, and I’m not really in the mood to discuss your love life. I trust whatever it is can wait till morning.”
He’s suddenly frustrated. He may be an angel, but the man in front of him is divine, and he doesn’t realize it. He’s more holy than Castiel will ever be.
“Oh, I didn’t realize.” But he should have. Dean has gone through so much in such a short time. Maybe, he is the one being unreasonable for suggesting they immediately go back to their old lives. Cas just wants Dean to have everything he deserves.
The answer is not as definite as he would like, but it’s enough for him to come to a decision. His life with Lucifer is good if by no means perfect, and he’s caused this man enough pain. He’ll let him go despite everything in his being screaming for him not to.
“But I don’t believe anyone is ever truly helpless and doomed to give in to their worst instincts. Everyone is capable of growth and change. You of all people should realize that. ”
Dinner ends up being pretty great. Aziraphale is easy to talk to, and Crowley eventually lightens up and joins the conversation, adding his own anecdotes wherever he can. Dean is pretty sure Cas constantly kicking him from under the table when the demon is especially rude to Dean has something to do with it. No one comments on Dean's lack of table manners. Jack's fork lesson end up being irrelevant. And, he surprises himself by agreeing to come see them again with Cas sometime.
Cas’s lips press into a firm line, and his shoulders tense, almost imperceptibly. He pretends to look at Dean, but really, he’s staring at a nearly invisible stain on the bunker wall.
Cas nods reluctantly, barely registering the words.  Dean wants so badly to grab him by the shoulders and yell at him until he gets it through his thick skull that he’s worth more to him than the whole world. Why can’t he see that?
“That’s not what I’m worried about. I know this is important to you, but in your current state, I can’t in good conscience take you to see our future therapist, even for a simple social visit. What if you end up blurting out something you’re not ready to talk about?
He doesn’t see this conversation going anywhere good if they continue so he figures it’s time to cut his losses and ignore the fact he has babies on the brain.
“I have dragged him out of Hell and remade him atom by atom. I have marked him with my Grace and have answered his prayers time and again. I have fought civil wars in his name and given up armies for his sake. We have raised a child together. He is good and wooed.”
In that moment, he realizes he’s sabotaging himself again. He’s not that different from old Dean yet, but at least, his life is no longer some big cosmic joke. Even better, after that big damn speech and weeks of positive reinforcement, it’s become impossible to trick himself into thinking the angel doesn’t love him unconditionally. He simply wants to be worthy of that love.
“I wasn’t planning too. I just wanted to get away from you for a while, and I ended up here, because this is one of the few places where I feel at home even when you’re not with me.”
Why is it that every time he tries to connect to a human they end up bursting into tears? Castiel replays the conversation in his brain trying to figure out where he went wrong, but nothing in particular jumps out at him. He’s sure he did everything right this time. Dean seemed receptive to his advances and was obviously attracted to him. The guy had been staring at him all night, looking at him like he’d willingly fall to his feet and worship him. As blasphemous as the sentiment is, he can’t say he wasn’t flattered.
“That doesn’t seem that bad,” Dean says with a shrug. He’s about the right age to start eating solid foods. So, it doesn’t strike him as particularly irresponsible outside of the initial pudding theft of someone who he assumes is a friend/frenemy of the devil anyway.
Aziraphale claps, and Crowley’s snickers. He scowls at them, but Cas leads him away, casually filling him in on what he’s been up to when he wasn’t in research mode.
“He’s kind, compassionate, righteous, and his faith in me- his love for me is impossibly bright. I couldn't look away if I tried,” he finishes.
Cas is the one holy thing he’s ever believed in, and for some reason, the sight of his wings hits him like a truck. He wants to forget the lies, the pain, the treachery. He wants to believe again.
“Oh, you gonna stick some angel grace in it or something?” he jokes, not expecting him to nod seriously.
“In his world, my counterpart is female. Charlie and I dated in that universe, and he is quite fond of her. Lucifer was devastated when I ended up marrying someone else,” he admits reluctantly like Dean’s caught him cheating or something.
Michael raises his wings in a familiar intimidation tactic. He’s beyond being impressed by something like that. All he sees is an easy target. He lunges, but Cas yanks him back.
“Maybe, we can even bring Charlie to meet little Charlie at some point. Get some cute pictures,” he says, already mentally adding a nephew he’s never met from an angel he hadn’t even heard of until two weeks ago to his extended family tree.
Unfortunately for Cas, he gets where the devil is coming from. In his position, he’d also be pushing his angel to stay away from the alcoholic drunk with anger issues who kicked him out of his home in his hour of need. Sure, it hadn’t really been his choice, but he’d still left the angel woefully unprepared for the outside world, practically throwing him to the wolves without any warning or reason. Worse, like a guilty coward, he hadn’t really kept in touch until he miraculously found him by chance at the Gas and Sip where his angel was doing fairly well for himself, if you count sleeping in the storeroom of a Gas and Sip okay.
“Let me put it this way, I stabbed him, and I was still his favorite,” Dean says, giving the devil a knowing grin.
Just like that, the wedding starts feeling too real. Does he want a Scooby Doo wedding? Would a cowboy wedding fly? How did the devil catch wind of what they were doing anyway? He feels a sudden stab of betrayal the likes of which he hasn’t felt in years.
Dean immediately narrows his eyes and stumbles forward. He grabs him by the lapels so they're only inches apart. Cas resists the urge to close the distance.
Judging by Michael’s dumb face, he knows full well what just happened. He’s all happy go lucky deceptive smiles as he makes his way over to them. Cas holds up his angel blade, but he’s trembling. Dean makes an executive decision and takes it for himself so he can defend them both.
“Actually, we’ve been talking, and we’ve decided to wait a while before having a big wedding,” Cas says, not sounding particularly bothered by this new development. That irks him a little, even though he’s getting exactly what he wanted.
Cas reluctantly banishes his wings, unsettled by how much sense that explanation makes. Once again, he sees his meeting with Dean a whole lot differently.
Another devastating smile, and he finds himself thinking, okay, maybe, the devil is nice, nice to look at anyway. He may be hopelessly in love with his angel, but he’s not blind.
“He didn’t want to involve Cas, but he name-dropped Charlie in his evil villain speech as an and I quote, Pawn I can’t ignore.”
"You were gone, Dean. Michael had you, and I could see that Jack needed the break, needed a familial connection he'd never be able to have with Kelly's family without endangering them or breaking their hearts. So, I went to visit Aziraphale for the first time in years and brought Jack with me. I’m glad I did. He’s much happier than I’ve ever seen him. Jack took a liking to Crowley especially.”
The place is classy, modern and sleek with traces of ancient architecture thrown in. He mentally calculates which brother he’s dealing with, but there’s something about the soft subdued light that makes his stomach twist in recognition. He ignores his intuition even as the copious amount of alcohol and grand piano seems to confirm it. If he truly is in the home of the once glorious Morning Star, he knows he is doomed, knows where rebellion leads.
“Wait, you fell in love with Michael’s sword. I don’t believe Father would, and I never said-” he said, more flustered than he’s ever seen him in any universe. He seems truly baffled by Castiel’s decision.
Of course, Cas wants to believe his brother is good. Hadn’t he put up with soulless Sam for a year? It’s his job to be suspicious enough for the both of them.
It's nice to be reminded that happy endings exist, even if their world had completely missed the mark. He’d found out later that even Sam had been miserable in his seemingly perfect life. Castiel desperately wants to give Dean a chance to live his life free of destiny, bring them all back to the point before he’d been the unfortunate victim of impalement and start over. For reasons beyond him, Dean is vehemently against the idea.
“You’re going to shamelessly flirt with me the entire time, aren’t you?” he says, already resigned to his fate. Even so, he holds onto him more tightly.
Dean raises an eyebrow. Apparently, they dine here so often that their three month absence was noticed. Aziraphale mutters something about miracles coming in handy. Crowley, on the other hand, keeps glaring at him which if quite a feat considering he's wearing his sunglasses indoors.
Crowley ends up being nothing like he expected. He’s tall and lithe like a snake, and Dean stares a second too long as he bends down to glue a coin to the ground. The demon is all sharp edges and weary glances when he finally notices him. Dean walks over, takes a coin out of his pocket and uses his own glue to add it to Crowley’s collection. He nods in approval, not quite able to hide his surprise even with his thick black shades. He straightens his suit jacket and clears his throat, suddenly nervous. He’s not sure why. If anything, Dean is the one who should be feeling threatened right now.
Dean freezes up as he looks directly at Amenadiel, Linda, and their impressionable angel baby. Whoops.
Castiel smiles, patting Lucifer’s shoulder twice in an effort to comfort him. It has little effect. He doesn’t mind that his older brother is uncertain of his path as long as Castiel is sure. Cas will not waver from his chosen path, no matter how he may end up suffering from it.
His eyes are sparkling and full of desire, but as much as he’d like to give in to the impulse and take Castiel up on his offer, he still has the devil to deal with. The devil who at the very least is guilty of introducing his poor wide eyed innocent angel to the highs and lows of hookup culture.
“Then, I wish you two the best. May you have a long and happy life together without being impeded by any other stabbing implements.”
Dean starts sobbing too, clutching the angel like a lifeline. He didn’t expect to get this emotionally wrecked today, and he regrets not having coffee this morning.
“Great, I’m so glad you stopped by. When Cas mentioned celestial brain rot, I was worried you’d be angel drunk or something,” Linda says like he’s not still hopped up on angel magic.
He chuckles fondly at the memory. He shuts his eyes and tightens his grip on Cas’s neck to ready himself to take the angel express. There’s a familiar terrifying rush and in seconds they're back on solid ground. They end up in a high end penthouse that Dean Smith would probably kill to get his hands on.
“Not to, but I’ve noticed our relationship goes smoother when I do. Would you like to go back to tormenting yourself over an imagined affair I’m having with my brother’s lover?”
Charlie starts fussing, and he hands the kid over to Amenadiel. He instantly shushes, but Dean stubbornly refuses to read into it.
Dean narrows his eyes. The angel is hiding something from him, and historically, that hasn’t been a good thing.
Lucifer presses his hands together, eyebrows furrowed in deep concentration as he takes in Dean’s words. Finally, he points to him and gives the last answer he expected. He’s not sure whether to laugh or curse the devil’s one track mind.
Cas seems to get that Dean doesn’t want to have a big romantic moment here and backs off, but he can’t completely hide his disappointment. He sits back down on the loveseat and doesn’t bother pulling Dean down with him. He joins him anyway.
Dean goes from happily leaning against Cas to being unexpectedly scooped up so his angel can carry him bridal style. He should be embarrassed that Cas had the audacity to sweep him off his feet in public, but Dean finds himself liking it. He’s not sure he’s currently capable of expressing any negative emotion, or if he is, it’s being suppressed by the happy angel juice pumping through his veins.
Cas and Aziraphale are sitting at opposite ends of the room surrounded by ancient texts, each armed with a cup full of coco that must have gone cold hours ago. There’s a third cup waiting for him by the love seat on the coffee table. He sits down and accepts the offering, a little surprised that he doesn’t feel the familiar pull of anger he usually does when Cas goes against everything they planned. In fact, he’s alarmingly calm.
“You are nothing like an average insert character in a wish fulfillment fantasy. I love you because you are you, not because you were the first person I ever saw. I assure you that you are not,” Cas says with a secretive smile.
Suddenly, it’s like he flipped a switch, and Cas is perfectly calm although his eyes are watery and tear stains streak his face. It’s unsettling how easily angels can turn their emotions off.
“He honestly seems fine. I can still see you today if you’ve changed your mind about rescheduling,” Linda offers.
Cas is sure that he used to be too oblivious to notice. He decides it's about time he corrected his mistake. He wraps his arms around Dean, and the man stiffens but eventually relaxes, practically melting into him.
Dean playfully shoves Cas on the shoulder, all smiles and sunshine in an effort to tamp down his insecurity. After all, last time he’d dropped in on Cas’s extended family he’d invited himself. It’s no use hiding what he feels anymore though as the angel easily gleans his feelings from the surface of his mind. For once, Dean doesn’t complain because he gets exactly what he wants, well almost.
Cas doesn’t try to explain. In fact, he gets kind of broody like he’s wondering the same thing. Dean wrings his hands, working up the nerve to say something. He can’t put off explaining himself any longer. His angel deserves to know he was way out of Dean’s league in every way.
Of course, it’s not true. Cas has always been father material. Somehow, even though he was indirectly responsible for Jimmy’s death, he still ended up being Claire’s favorite dad. Dean, on the other hand, let Sam kill his own daughter.
“Dean tried to use Angel as a pet name once, I think,” he muses, not sure why he feels compelled to tell them this story. He thinks maybe Aziraphale will get a chuckle out of it.
"I'll have the same, and I am also Mr. Winchester by the way, but I am very flattered. You are a very handsome man,"  Cas says in his usual deadpan.
“I’m not having a repeat of that conversation. So, you better remember the whole thing so we can take your sorry ass home,” Dean presses.
“You leave classic children’s literature out of this, better to be a giving tree than the damn Grinch.”
“That’s unfortunate. Perhaps, after everything I’ve done to hurt you, it would be better if I stayed here then. I can see myself being happy here.”
Turns out the angel is already bored of him and living a double life, and they’ve only been an official couple for a few weeks. He’s lived with Crowley longer than that.
Dean stops struggling. Oh, how many of his subtle flirtations had Cas retroactively understood after Metatron beamed the knowledge into his head? Too many and the realization has him red as a tomato.
It’s not fair. Lucifer has no idea the kind of inter species bullshit/Heaven drama he’s had to deal with to get this far with Cas. That’s not even taking into account Cas’s rusty people skills and their mismatched love languages. He wouldn’t have ever realized the last thing if Sam hadn’t gotten fed up with their rom-com levels of miscommunication and shoved a book into his hands.
“You're welcome to stay as long as you like, honeybee,” Aziraphale says, briefly placing a hand on his shoulder to reassure him he’s welcome before zeroing in on a patron who is intent on buying a rare book.
Dean might as well have thrown ice cold water on Cas. He withdraws from him, physically and emotionally, stiffly turning around so he doesn’t have to look at him anymore.
"I just think its a shame that his palette is so limited. There's plenty of good food out there that isn't a piece of meat slapped between two buns."
He manages to sound light hearted, but Dean is more than willing to throw hands if Lucifer oversteps. The devil’s expression hardens as if reminded why he doesn’t like him in the first place.
Dean’s missing a lot of context, but he assumes this Chloe chick also has to beat lovestruck supernatural creatures back with a stick anytime she wants to get anything done.
Dean winces, finally realizing that for the most part Cas only went to see his other family when he willfully sent him away. Even now, Cas always prioritizes him first. And, here, he was banishing an angel from his presence so his devil of a father can talk down to him.
Dean smirks, pleased that his angel has actually been making Crowley miserable all this time as unfair as that sentiment is. Overall, he’d actually given Cas pretty good advice.
“Oh yes . . . that. I’m afraid the ship didn’t exactly set sail for reasons I’d rather not get into.”
Invisible wings spread wide in challenge, but the devil barely bats an eye, beyond exasperated with the two of them.
He ends up making out with an angel on the roof. When things start getting hot and heavy, the wings come out unexpectedly, and Dean nearly falls off the building, successfully killing the mood. Cas hides his wings almost immediately after he pulls Dean to safety, and he lets out a strangled frustrated noise. He wants to touch them so badly.
Unfortunately, Lucifer finally picks up, and he loses Cas’s undivided attention. He regrets taking it for granted before.
Awesome, walking to L.A. is impractical, and for some reason, his angel gets particularly twitchy when anyone one other than him or Sam is driving. He was damn lucky he managed to convince him to take an Uber to Linda’s.
“Cassie, you’re the baby of the family, and so help me, if he convinces you to elope and get married in Vegas I will have him murdered.”
Cas places a hand on his shoulder, the one that used to bear his mark, and he automatically relaxes. At least, he knows it's not Lucifer messing with him if nothing else.
“I see. So you’re saying this is a test of faith from Father. A temptation I must reject wholly in order to stay under the holy light of God. I may have recreated Dean atom by atom, but you’re right if he was meant to be Michael’s vessel. I must stand aside and offer him what help I can until that day comes, ” he decides finally, and it’s as if a weight has been lifted off his shoulders.
Dean lets out a dramatic sigh and imagines giving Castiel the finger. His angel gets the message and stops peeking in, rolling his eyes.
“I suppose Jack might come to get him again if Castiel stays with us too long. He always checks in with us first, then Lucy,” Aziraphale reminds him before abandoning his favorite chair so he can sit by Crowley.
“Oh please, Castiel was miserable and out of his mind. I got him some clothes that actually fit him, and helped him come to his senses, your welcome,” he says, taking a shot from their untouched whiskeys.
“I didn’t mean to hurt your feelings, but you have a tendency to steamroll others to get your way. It can be quite taxing,” Cas says with a grimace.
“Second, we may have endured one of the longest will-they won’t-they romances of all time, but in all honesty, we’ve been an official couple for like a month at this point. I’d like to enjoy that for a little while before getting hitched,” Dean says, honestly expecting the devil to explode and go off on him for needing even more time to seal the deal.
"By the way Dean, I'm going to need your help carrying all our new plants back to the bunker. I thought I'd start a garden there."
“Mazikeen actually, she can be quite the snoop when she wants to be. We’ll chat later assuming Dean doesn’t get cold feet. I hear he can be quite the heartbreaker.”
“We could foster. Children like you Dean. Despite what you may think of yourself, I believe you could help them.”
“Dean is better than you give him credit for, and I’m perfectly capable of handling things myself. So, what are you even doing here?”
“If you like hanging out with Crowleys so much, why don’t you just marry this one? He’s practically a better version of me,” he huffs.
“You’re just jealous Castiel is out here living his best life. It took you two a couple of weeks to even notice he was missing. The kid’s been with me for months,” he says dismissively.
“Yes, Lucifer recommended her after hearing everything I’ve been through. Doctor Linda specializes in helping celestials,”  he explains.
Dean’s life for once is pretty damn near perfect. The old Dean wouldn’t have been able to enjoy it. He’d keep waiting for the other shoe to drop, probably forever if he didn’t sabotage himself first. New Dean is secure in the knowledge that Cas loves him, and Jack isn’t interested in micromanaging his life like Chuck would. His life is his own. So, it’s kind of stupid of him to go poking the hornet's nest, but this has been bugging him for a while now.
Dean enjoys the way Cas’s wings twitch behind his back nervously. He wonders what would happen if he tried to run his fingers through them now when they’re in a different plane of existence. He gets up, immediately giving in to the impulse. His angel doesn’t notice Dean sneaking up behind him.
When he opens his eyes, he’s gobsmacked by the otherworldly prismatic feathers he’s buried his hands in. He scrambles off Cas to get a better look at the whole picture. Without consciously thinking about it, he gets on his knees.
“I don’t follow,” he says, predictably narrowing his eyes and tilting his head as he tries to get a better read on him.
The warm expression on Lucifer’s face grows cold. Castiel has always been far too blunt. Lucifer takes a sip of his drink and looks away as he closes himself off.
Is that what Cas expected when they met? Would this hypothetical replacement be able to see his true form? Hear his true voice? Once he knew how easy love can be, would everything he experienced with Dean fail to compare?
Dean frowns, not getting it. He’s just a little buzzed. Sure, his filter is practically gone, but this is probably the best time for him to go to therapy. Otherwise, he’d more than likely give Linda the cold shoulder and give one word answers because he’s so terrified that they’re going to steal his angel. Why wouldn’t they? He took the ‘iel from Castiel and never looked back.
Cas smirks, fully aware of what he’s doing as he pulls Dean closer to him, a hair’s breadth away from his lips. Dean scans his face. It’s playful yet full of quiet admiration.
"Yeah?" he says, preoccupied that he'll end up falling down the stairs with the way Cas is dragging him around.
Lucifer is left staggering, full of guilt and self loathing. He has no way of reaching Castiel and setting him straight- erm right about what he meant. Even at height of Amenadiel powers, he did not have the strength to hop dimensions. He winces, finally thinking of Mum. They could have used a dimension hopping Angel to get her somewhere safe. He sighs, dismissing it. No sense crying over spilled Vodka.
“This should be far enough.” He sets him down, and Dean immediately makes him regret it by punching him in the face. His hand stings, but it’s satisfying to see the devil hiss and cradle his swollen cheek.
Dean feels it in his bones. Two more decades, and he’ll technically be over a hundred. Besides, he seems to do better when someone else is in charge of the kid. He doesn’t count Sammy. That was a fluke he’s never successfully repeated. As for Ben, well, he’s lost his chance with Ben. The little guy is probably better off without him anyway.
Dean instinctively gets up and places himself in a fighting stance. He’s still in fight or flight mode, and he’s not ready to trust the devil to help them. Lucifer’s stupid grin falters when he sees Cas covered in blood, and Dean holding an angel blade. Dean freezes as the devil’s eyes turn hellish. He knows exactly what this looks like.
Angels are stupidly good at turning one of their own into something they’re not. Lucifer’s preferences are simply different from Naomi’s if he had to guess.
“I’ll go along with your plan, but I need you to promise me something. No matter what you hear, don’t take any of my brother’s words to heart. You’re good, Dean. You’ve always been good.”
Dean swallows nervously. Yeah, he’s like ninety percent sure that having another kid this soon after their official hookup is a bad idea, but Cas wanting to provide does things to him. He manages to fight the impulse just barely.
Then again, anyone can be good with the right script. He’s kind of glad there’s a version of Jack's biological father that isn’t a total douche. If their Lucifer had been anything like the one in front of him, maybe, he wouldn’t have been so quick to write Jack off as a lost cause.
Dean throws the stupid fork on the floor, not caring how much of a rude ass he’s being. Two hours, two whole hours, the kid made him look at forks, and he can’t even name the fork he brought with him.
His angel shoves him off, but he immediately collapses afterwards, and Dean’s never been so aware of blood pooling on the ground. Dean has a traitorous thought as he begins to panic.
All he really wants is to lighten the mood, but Cas is not at all amused by the joke. Dean clears his throat and moves on, suddenly reminded that the angel has lost a shitton of family thanks to him. Sure, most of them were assholes, but it wouldn’t kill him to be a little more sensitive about the whole thing.
Dean makes a decision. He’s going to charm the pants off the devil, figuratively of course. If nothing else, he’s going to be one Hell of a boyfriend, and good boyfriends win over their inlaws. First things first, he and Cas need to get on the same page and come up with some kind of strategy.
Crowley subtly relaxes and leans into Aziraphale, taking his angel’s hand without a hint of hesitation. Aziraphale responds by giving him a quick chaste peck on the cheek. Crowley blushes, but otherwise keeps his cool and doesn’t outwardly react. He’s a little jealous at how easily they show affection in others company. Dean is not quite there yet though he’s trying. At least, he doesn’t seem to mind if Sam sees anymore.
Cas stiffens, and his hidden but faintly visible wings snap shut. His angel is panicking, but it’d be impossible for him to tell without the wings. Dean wishes he could see them all the time. Maybe, they would be on the same page more often.
"We should give them a little nudge, least we could do after Lucifer helped us get hitched, even if I hate the way that dumbass went about it."
He releases his hands and embraces him fully as if somehow his mere presence can heal the tortured parts of Dean’s soul, in many ways it has.
He wants to cry as a tumult of emotions pour through him. Unfortunately, he remembers the man in front of him is not fond of Chick Flick Moments, and since he is not currently dying, it is probably best to keep his feelings to himself.
Dean is not sure if the bone chilling deep eldritch voice that comes out of Cas’s mouth is real or if the angel mojo is making him insane. Michael surprisingly isn’t shaking in his boots despite his initial hesitation. No, instead, he seems worryingly gleeful like Cas has just fed him more ammunition.
"I assured them that I could use my grace to keep them alive indefinitely and that I would never yell at them."
“We start by impressing Amenadiel and Linda got it. Once the devil hears that I’m actually a decent guy from people he trusts, he has to come around,” he says, regaining some of his initial optimism.
When they’d met face to face, he’d openly flirted with him and only became angry once he realized Lucifer had been teaching him things of a sexual nature. Dean had even called him his angel. Were they an item in his universe? Why wouldn’t he just come out and tell him if they were? He would have never insinuated Dean didn’t matter to him if he’d known that beautiful man had been part of the life he’d left behind.
“What’s your point, Sunshine? Because it kind of seems to me you packed a suitcase and split without Jack.”
“That’s certainly a poetic end for him. Good luck wooing your Lumberjack,” he says, raising a glass.
Dean had come to the penthouse to visit Lucifer, not him. He’d finished his set early, eager to chase after him and stake a claim on the off chance the green eyed man had caught his brother’s interest after all.
“Lucifer did offer to set me up with a nice prophet. If I’m patient, he might even be able to find me one with green eyes. I’ve decided I like green eyes.”
Too close, too close, always too close to him. Why did the goddamn liar have to prove the angel dicks right about that?
The rest of the lights go out. He doesn’t see how, but suddenly, he’s safely on the leather couch, and Cas has Michael by the throat pressed into some sort of ancient stone the devil shouldn’t have the permits to place in his suite.
“Alright lovebirds, we’re taking you and your boyfriend to the Ritz to celebrate you two getting back together without either of you having to die first. For you two, that shows real growth,” Crowley says, obviously privy Dean’s entire life story.
“Considering finding out Heaven and Hell are real caused her to have a debilitating crisis of faith that nearly ruined her life, it would be unwise to put another therapist through such turmoil simply so my family has options on who to see. ”
Castiel tilts his head and squints, but for once, that puzzled look is not directed at him, and Heaven help him, he’s jealous that he’s not Cas’s number one right now.
Despite Lucifer’s obvious disapproval, his wings come out unbidden, fluttering excitedly. His heartbeat quickens, sharing the same sentiment. They want him to come home!
For once, it’s super clear to him that the angel’s definitely interested, and he’s not sure how to feel about that. Everything seemed a lot easier when he was suffering from some sort of celestial brain rot at the sight of Castiel’s wings, part of him wants that certainty back. Without a better idea, he shakes the angel’s hand and introduces himself.
Michael’s not looking at his wings though. No, instead, his anxious gaze is directed at the ceiling or rather something the size of the Chrysler building that’s beyond Dean’s abilities to see even with a touch of grace in him. He takes a step back, holding his hands up in surrender.
Dean’s eyes go wide. That’s a game changer. In his head, he goes through a list of supernatural entities he might trust with that kind of power.
‘Like a fungus I can’t get rid of,’ goes unsaid for Cas’s benefit, but Dean’s learned to read between the lines. He hasn’t quite won Lucifer over yet.
“Please,” he murmurs, burying his face in his neck. He can feel the exact moment Cas caves. He sucks in a breath and when he breathes out, his resolve breaks.
“So angel, expecting any other relatives to drop into our little pocket of the universe?” Crowley asks, making great efforts to appear grumpy. He knows that’s his cue to supply him with the goods.
Aziraphale’s voice snaps Crowley out of his fear induced stillness. He’s had one too many close calls with angels and part of Castiel feels guilty for trying to take advantage of that. These two are one of the few remaining angelic beings he considers family, although he knows full well that Crowley would vehemently deny being remotely angelic despite being the patron saint of lost things. He nods stiffly at Aziraphale before reluctantly facing Cas.
Lucifer rolls his eyes again like he’s a dunce who can’t pay attention. He wishes he’d managed to convince Sam to let him hold onto Ruby’s knife because he’s this close to punching the devil in the face and hurting his hand.
He knows its a stupid question, but he needs the reassurance. For a cocky guy, his self esteem is fragile as Hell. Cas’s eyes seem to glow brighter, but not in the ‘I’m an angel of the lord’ way, but in the ‘my future husband is an idiot, but I love him’ way. He swears that a bunch of butterflies spontaneously invade his stomach when Cas presses his forehead to his.
Dean desperately wants to be wrong about this. So, he ends up asking a question he probably doesn’t want the answer to.
“Let’s not forget that the Empty is far from silent despite its weakened state, and from what you’ve told us, it has formed an unhealthy obsession with taking you,” Aziraphale said, mouth forming a grim line.
“He’s not here,” Cas says, oddly tense for what’s supposed to be a casual visit with the inlaws. He scans the area, wings pressed against his back. He glares at the empty space, and it’s telling that his angel does not let him go.
“Stay out of this,” he says, reclaiming his weapon. His hands are steady again so he willingly lets the angel blade go.
Your stupidly sacrificial angel doesn’t keep secrets from you and repeatedly make the same mistakes over and over again. You don’t get worse and worse until you almost turn into the very thing you spend a quarter of your life fighting and drive the angel away without ever once entertaining the thought he would have stayed if you asked him to. What he wouldn’t give for them to follow a nice uncomplicated storyline for once. Cas deserves the world, and he’s settled for Dean.
He looks around the eclectic living space and gazes at an old black and white photograph of Aziraphale and Crowley posing outside a destroyed church, a hint of a smile on his face.
“Back at full power and still in love with humanity, interesting. I take it Naomi is out of the picture, then? That’s too bad. I always liked her,” he adds offhandedly.
Linda lights up, relieved to have better babysitting options next time she goes out on the town. Cas nods in solidarity, still having a silent staring contest with the kid. His wings casually encircling him and the baby. Dean heart thunders painfully, second guessing his choice not to do the whole baby thing.
Cas presses his forehead to Dean’s, and he imagines the sudden warmth along his back are his angel’s wings wrapping around him.
Cas sighs as if this is something he knows but only accepts begrudgingly. Dean wants to argue, but it’s taking all his concentration to keep from falling over.
The demon finally calms down and lets Aziraphale take the lead. Dean grimaces. He'd been hopeful when Cas said they might be going to a pub or something, but this is something else. Aziraphale seems to sense his anxiety and tries to reassure him.
Cas possessively clutches his coat, pouting slightly. It’s freaking cute, and he makes a mental note to ask about this Constantine dude later.
He really should have realized he was well and truly fucked then. At the time, all he felt was fear and trepidation but now-
He wasn’t really expecting a reply as his grumblings weren’t meant for Cas’s ears, but his angel gives a thoughtful answer that he must have had rolling in his head for a while.
Dean’s brain short circuits as Cas confidently struts onto the stage with dazzling prismatic wings. He suddenly has the urge to fall to his knees and comb his fingers through Cas’s feathers and never ever let the angel go. It only gets worse when the angel starts to sing ‘Somebody to Love.’ His angel is about half way through the song when Sam shakes him lightly to snap him out of it.
"I have eyes, man. Are you saying that they're not banging? Like why? Their chemistry is off the charts. It's like they were made for each other."
He doesn’t say anything more. Castiel lowers his eyes, allowing some of his disappointment to show as something in him cracks. It really is hopeless then. If the once great Morningstar could not do the impossible, how could a simple soldier even dare to think he could do the same, especially with the most important soul in the universe: the Righteous Man, Michael’s sword, the man he marked with his very own grace.
He turns his back on him, and Dean suddenly has to deal with the fact that he’s on top of some no name building. Knowing his luck, the way inside is locked, and he’s too old to be breaking down doors.
“All I had to do is remind him of his many, many failures and bam, suddenly, his greatest strength turns into his greatest weakness.”
“I must admit that my advice may have been colored by recent events I was experiencing at the time, but you’re the one that decided that God wanted you apart. I was merely suggesting that Father was literally dropping the righteous man at your feet for a cosmic hook up,” he explains, more than happy to clear things up even if it was twelve years too late to make much of a difference.
“He’s as good as married, and I have someone else in mind,” he says, squeezing his shoulder meaningfully, an amused sparkle in his eyes.
In which Lucifer is staunchly Team Prophet and Castiel is strictly Team Righteous Man even if he doesn't remember why
“I didn’t think you’d be susceptible to celestial brain rot, but I suppose I would be the one holy creature you would get on your knees for.”
“Your support is appreciated. Especially, since we’ve already agreed to stay at Lucifer’s suite until Dean recovers,” Cas says suddenly next to him. He’s far too used to it for him to even half-heartedly complain. No, what has his attention is how Cas’s wings automatically curl around him in a protective gesture, he has to bury the sudden urge he has to touch them.
He doesn’t remember everything yet, but someday, soon, he will, and that’s enough for him. He already knows the most important thing. He loves this man, and he might have trouble saying it, but this man loves him right back.
“If it’s about moving in together, I have news for you,” he teases, successfully getting a little blush out of him. They really have been doing things in the wrong order.
He turns beet red. Even when he wins, he loses. He’s jealous of himself. What’s with him and imagining his angel having torrid affairs? He’s not some easily scandalized Victorian maiden.
“Well, with a name like Charlie, how could I not love the kid? We gotta establish ourselves as the cool uncles early,” he says, feeling a little lighter than before.
Did he tell this devil how he felt so worthless that he was willing to be his meat suit and more than likely die in the process? All because Cas got it in his head that he needed to be useful to be wanted. Dean had failed him, and as much as he apologized and explained it was nothing he’d done, he’d nearly doomed an angel with his carelessness. Worse, it was only one of many, many times Cas would offer himself for slaughter, all for Dean.
There is a tense silence after that tells him that they’re definitely picking this up again during therapy, but Cas is willing to hold off airing his grievances until then. He hates himself for being so weak. In a perfect world, Dean would have gripped Cas tight and raised him from perdition instead of getting black out drunk every night and taking the first way out he could find.
“Heaven’s no, fairly sure, they came to take you back with them, not that they deserve you. You’re welcome to stay here and forget that wretched universe if you prefer.”
Cas bites his lip, still refusing to look away from the elevator. Maybe, Lucifer can clear things up for him. He’s always been better with humans.
Michael shoots Cas a wicked grin like Dean’s just revealed one of his angel’s big dark secrets. He feels Cas stiffen as his older brother silently dissects him.
He pats him on the back and leaves him to his affairs. Cas has a sneaking suspicion he’ll end up breaking into the poor detective’s home tonight to discuss the details of Cas’s love life in person. He shakes his head, silently chuckling to himself. Some people have no sense of personal space.
“You don’t have to prove anything to my brother, Dean. He’ll see that I’m happy and get over it eventually. Besides, I believe Amenadiel and Linda will be more understanding of our situation and help smooth things over,” he reasons.
Cas’s eyes soften and he strokes Dean’s cheek. He doesn’t pull away, savoring the small touch. It’s not like Sam hasn’t figured out what’s going on anyway. He has eyes.
