Samuel smirked. "So this is it, huh? The inseparable duo. Doctor Watson and Detective Sherlock Holmes,"
"Oh, Sherlock! I'm so glad! Did you tell him that you also-" Sherlock shut the door before she could finish. John turned to him, surprised at this. He did one of his confused-frowny-smiles.
Suddenly, Samuel spoke up. He handed Sherlock a small piece of paper. "Do call, I'd love to get together and hear more about your work." He delicately placed it in the palm of the taller man's hand (which he then put in his coat pocket), and then strolled away.
John softly broke the silence. "Oh," he exhaled. "Come here." He opened his arms and gently put them around the taller man. He seemed surprised by it at first, but quickly adjusted. He almost shakily put his arms around John as well.
Sherlock pulled away, smiling at John with a 'grateful' kind of look on his face. It made John feel warm and happy inside. John hesitated and looked at the floor then back at Sherlock.
Lestrade still looked confused. He put his hands on his hips and turned his head to where Samuel had went. "Who just walks on to a crime scene
and we don't actually entirely know. Says his name's Samuel, he's got an ID?" He finished with a slight shrug.
Of course it kind of did make sense to John. A lot, now that he thought about it. But how did Sherlock tell him on the day they met..? He thought hard to himself. Their dinner conversation. Girlfriends? No. Boyfriends? No. But it's okay. He knows it's okay. Totally okay. Thank you. He froze. It was there. He literally, thanked John for being okay with it because he
"John, I know, hope, you won't think of me any different; I mean I told you on the day we first met, but in a way you normal people probably wouldn't get let's be honest,"
When they got into a cab to take them back to 221B, John still couldn't help pondering what just happened. Did the man have any significance to anything? One can't simply do what he just did without a motive. And John still couldn't fathom the fact why Sherlock Holmes was acting really off, sort of how he acted throughout the time after Rosie was born till they helped his secret sister. Extremely out of character. Unlike him. He stole a glance at Sherlock but only saw the side of his face. It was a nice face; defined features like cheekbones and jawline, gorgeous eyes and lips framed with curls--
Hey, sorry this chapter took so long. School and life have both been real busy but I'm finally off for winter break and got a chance to write!
Greg finally broke the unbearably uncomfortable silence. "Well, these men came here for a reason, better let them get on it,"
just to see you. I think he was interested in more than just your work. You should give him a call."
it. Wow. He froze again. He remembered shortly after that Sherlock thought John was coming onto him; which he
"No. Nope. Not at all not me, not ever." He said aloud and shooed away past therapy sessions. "I. Don't. Love. Sherlock Holmes." He quietly repeated to himself. "Not today, not ever." He stared at the opposing chair in front of him. "We're not... a couple." He then stood up. Rosie was at Molly's for the day till 11; John didn't want her around at this age while Sherlock was doing his 'experiments'. Sherlock begged to differ, though. John chuckled to himself but quickly stopped.
John frowned and inhaled to say something, but then exhaled. "What about The Wo- er, Irene?" He cocked his head. Sherlock raised an eyebrow.
It was a quiet ride, which John expected. When they arrived, however, something was different. There was another man at the scene; an extra away from the regular. He was a taller fellow: he had a very firm facial structure with a bit of scruff. He had dark, strawberry-blond hair and a soft expression; although his eyes looked like a rough storm at sea.
he said it to... maybe he meant the general 'you'? Not Sherlock alone? It couldn't be. They solved almost every case together after they met; he can't have meant Sherlock alone. They were a team. Duo. Couple. No, no no. John's mind rapidly backspaced. Not 'couple'.
John remembered. No matter. It was over now. Knowing Sherlock he'll probably throw away the paper when they get home. They'll never run into that person again.
"I see. How nice of you to allow him on site," Sherlock said with a hint of sarcasm. He reached the man and held out a gloved hand. "Sherlock Holmes. Consulting detective." The man looked pleased and took it.
John quickly walked towards his jacket. "Will we be back before Rosie's s'posed to get here?" He said as he put an arm through the sleeve.
"Thank you. That, that really means a lot." They stood there just sincerely looking at each other. It was calm. Bliss.
Thank you all so much for your support on the first chapter! I love hearing your feedback. Everything is appreciated <3
Samuel turned to the blogger as if he was required to acknowledge him, not because he wanted to. "Ah, yes, ..."
in here, speaking of which.." He turned away to go talk to the near officers. When he was out of the radar, John quickly turned to Sherlock.
"Yes yes," he said with pace, "I've decided I should probably tell you something. It's important." He walked closer to John. John straightened his back. What could it possibly be? He's lived with Sherlock for quite a bit now, he knew a considerable amount about Sherlock, but let's be real, it's Sherlock; really, who knows. John pursed his lips.
A sure possibility. It made John feel weird, but he knew it had nothing to do with him. Sherlock deserves love. Everyone deserves love; even this intimidating Samuel guy. John decided to shrug it off for now.
“And yet you live alone. You spend your evenings here, working on patient charts. You haven’t had a date since you returned from military service…” Sherlock’s words tapered off and his face grew solemn. “I’ve made you angry.”
Mycroft trailed off as his mother’s narrow-eyed glare—so very like Sherlock’s, John thought—skewered him to his chair. John tried not to giggle as his mate poked him in the side gently with his elbow. Sherlock was positively delighted not to be the object of his mother’s scrutiny. He’d very nearly begged to be included, along with John and Kit, in the dinner that would bring his parents together with Mycroft’s intended for the first time.
Mycroft turned and closed his door, punching a code into the panel beside it. The door bolts slipped into place; Mycroft glanced up to where he knew the cameras would now be in blackout. He continued across the floor, approaching his own desk. "Where is who? Is Kit missing?"
“No,” John stopped him, pushing back to place a finger over his lips. “We don’t do that. Ever. I love you, and that’s it. So you don’t always want to have sex. That’s okay. I know I’m the only person you feel that kind of attraction for, and you show me that in a hundred different ways every day. And when we do make love, you’re the best I’ve ever had.”
Lestrade watched in awe as Sherlock suddenly pressed himself into John’s back and dropped his head to bury his face in John’s hair. John couldn’t stifle his grin this time, and reached back with one hand to pat Sherlock’s hip.
“I thought maybe we could take a mini-break somewhere? I know they’ve closed travel to Spain again, but France is nice this time of year. Or we could just do a little hotel up in the Lake Distri—”
Finally, they dug out their photos and talked about their children. John knew he was gushing a bit about Rosie. He couldn’t help it. She was his only child. And she was, in fact, amazing.
"Mrs. Hudson is very sentimental about the Victorian period, for some reason. That tends to bleed into her choices in décor."
Sherlock was quick to reach under and pull his knees up, as John lowered himself over Sherlock’s body. He braced himself with his hands on the bed at Sherlock’s shoulders, his thrusts hard and steady. His belly was now rubbing over Sherlock’s over-sensitized cock and the poor man was trying desperately to stay silent. His eyes were watering with the effort.
“By what you said,” Sherlock clarified. “Not good. I wasn’t bothered.” He’d finished straightening the equipment and was pulling on his coat as John approached him.
Dr. Awiti leaned in and patted his knee. “I would tell you that the feeling will pass, but I think you know that.”
“Perhaps,” Sherlock sighed. He peeked at John out of the corner of his eye. “For now, I feel like supper. You?”
“Yes, that’s wise,” Mycroft agreed. “Unfortunately, I’ve done all I can without making more of an enemy of John. Sherlock’s left plenty of money for them, and I’ve made sure John has unlimited access—though he is unaware that I have anything to do with it. And I helped Sherlock secure a long-term lease at Baker Street. This, though, is up to you.”
This caused the Alpha to grunt painfully but his mouth only sucked harder as if to recompense the whimpering Omega beneath him. John kept the Omega’s hand in his own moving it roughly, quickly, thrusting against the clothed thigh.
This man with the sharp cheekbones, and unruly curls, all so familiar to me. Whoever said men aren't beautiful obviously never met this man.
“John-” Sherlock stepped forward wanting answers that his mind already deduced. His heart was denying the truth that was so plainly written.
“Well aren’t we a naughty boy. Not so innocent then?” The Alpha purred nearring with two easy strides, again without a limp or any trouble. And Sherlock caught his own breath as he was suddenly lying underneath a nearly naked Adult Alpha. Those thighs still damp from his bath cradled his hips, the only protection Sherlock had was the towel between them. The Alpha growled playfully his nose nudging at Sherlock’s neck, the Omega moved his head allowing full access to his scent gland, at the same time his own hips arched upward.
Sherlock was a genius, it wasn't vanity but a fact. His keen eyes even in the rain and dim lighting had discovered the pattern of marked shipping containers. Like bread crumbs he found them until they came upon the one that held the black market relics. John wooped, holding up his mobile.
Sneaky rebellious Omega Sherlock breaks into John's flat with hopes of tempting the Alpha. However things don't go as he hoped.
Mycroft stood up in response, his whole body tense. Sherlock pulled the phone from his ear and looked at the screen. Mycroft leaned over and the video played. At that moment it felt as if the world had fallen around them.
The warmth spreads through his sore body, and the aroma reminds him of home. John suddenly has a flash of an olive green door, and a somewhat crooked gold knocker. “I want to go home.” He sighs, eyes open “221B Baker?”
John shivered, lowering himself even deeper into the bubbles, his hands nervously rubbing his belly. He needed to get out of this place. He had less than a month before the pup would be born. He wanted to be back in Sherlock’s toned arms, needed to fill his lungs with the scent of his love.
The scent of John Watson was stronger here in his home, the heady smell of spice a musk heavy and thick in the air the closer he moved to the bedroom. This made sense, that’s where John would spend most of his time, sleeping. Did Alpha’s nest? The young Omega curiously ventured into the dark room leaving the cane propped just outside the door, forgetting his reasons for being there. He wanted to know more of the Alpha.
Sherlock can't explain the warmth that is spreading through his soaked clothes, John removes his own jacket to cover them both. "Come on don't be shy, we can huddle under this poor excuse of a roof while you form a plan. Too bad our phones have zero service out here."
Moriarty had said he would cut the heart out of the consulting detective, the mad man had said that he would burn him. Now, as Sherlock stood watching his family leave that room without another word, the realization that his dead enemy had done just that nearly brought the man to his knees. The heart from his chest had been taken, he could feel nothing but pain.
“Go on, little one, move your hand you know what to do. Or would you like me to help you? You know ever since I saw your naked bum, I haven't been able to think of little else. “ Sherlock felt the heated mouth move downward, one hand still firmly covering his own, the warmth was almost too much. He did as the voice beckoned and moved his hand the Alpha growled and pushing his black hoodie up along with the black t-shirt beneath, expose his hairless chest. The Alpha’s mouth descended on it’s prey taking the pink puckered nipple into his mouth, sucking furiously almost painfully. Sherlock gasped, arching upward his free hand moving to grasp at the injured shoulder unintentionally.
“It helps not being a psychotic sociopath.” John couldn’t help but reply stepping back. The thin Omega with dark circles under his eyes didn’t smile.
Mycroft stood back as his brother proceeded to destroy the office. His staff had become accustomed to such outbursts these last few weeks. No one blinked or dared to interfere. When his brother had first received the distressing video message, Mycroft had been visiting 221B. He had distressing news concerning his brother and mate.
here we go! Another update for my dear M. I hope it's to your liking everyone! find me on tumblr! Things will get a little interesting in the next chapter.
The Alpha put a finger to his lips, and he held his watch up, it made a beeping noise and then a little light at the side of the cheap black digital watch turned green.
“ He is nobody Sigerson. Just someone that used to know your dead papa. But we are going home you and I. He will not be visiting or stopping by.” John took his son’s small hand and pushed his taller blond sister towards the door. Harry shot several glares over her shoulder but ultimately followed her brother’s lead.
“Damn.” John hadn't felt such a stirring since his waking up in the hospital. He needed release, but damn his new status. He would normally find a willing partner have a mutual one night stand, a night of thrusting deep into a wanting partner spending until there was nothing left then showering a quick peck to the cheek and taking leave.
It's childish but he refuses to tell John he failed, and that the Doctor had been correct. Sherlock acknowledges it to himself, that should be enough. They are lost, fine. Yes, he should have texted Lestrade before they set off into the maze of abandoned warehouses and shipping crates.
He wanted to finish quickly so he could perhaps test his newly formed theories about John's actions.
It was Sebastian that made it a nightmare. The Alpha had made it clear that he and John would share a bed. As a security measure of course, he hadn't taken John’s bonding bracelets from him. Moriarty wanted them to stay put, John was grateful and suspicious of the reasoning.
“Oh, fine! Put it in the sitting room I’ll be out soon.” John pulled himself out, the ache of his muscles gone. He was in fact famished.
Disgusting he was starting to show signs of sentiment and jealousy. He heard the running shower and paused, he could easily go into the bathroom sit himself on the toilet and watch the Alpha shower. Would that be too forward? His cheeks burned red at such a bold move, he had yet to see an Alpha naked. What exactly did John have under his clothes, Alphas were always so proud of their genitals. Was it really that impressive? He could check. Sherlock shook his head, forcing his thoughts away from such biologically basic needs. He was above that, he was a certified genius, at 21 he was teaching at the university, not attending it as this Alpha believed.
“Fuck. You little minx. I could take you now, roll you over have you present to me. You want that don’t you?”
Sherlock had knocked but there was no answer, and it was all too easy to pick the lock out of curiosity, shouldn’t the Alpha have gone straight home? Or had he decided to meet up with a consort, did he have a lover, and if so would he be keeping this lover?  Sherlock frowned, why was he even considering these things?
Sherlock swallowed his pants had been discarded as well his gray boxer briefs, he felt sheer panic starting to settle in. This was not what he had planned.
John’s tongue took advantage of the parted lips forming an adorable O. He groaned into the  receptive warmth, his tongue quick to run over the smaller man’s perfect white teeth, dancing temporarily with the responsive tongue. He was an Alpha, and easily took control forcing his thick warm tongue further down, needing to penetrate in any way he could.
Is that why he had made the little brother comment? Sherlock was so interested in the picture, he wondered where the Alpha had been shot, obviously his limp was psychosomatic, he had made it home without the boring cane. Had the man even noticed? Foolish Alphas.
“Sssh, let me.” And blueish gray eyes, pupils wide stared in astonishment as the naked Alpha ran that same devilishly skilled wet muscular oral organ licked his calloused palm straight to his fingers. The Omega was panting a question on his lips, one that never quite made it further then an inaudible whimper. Because the Alpha with bright blue eyes and a devilish grin brought his hand back to it’s earlier ministrations.
Now it had been two weeks and nothing. No sign of Moriarty, Sebastian Moran or John Watson. All traces of Moriarty just vanished into thin air. Even their informants had come up with nothing. Mycroft had anticipated some kind of negotiation from the mad Irish Omega, but there had been no contact.
Sherlock was fluent in 13 different languages however he understood little of what this Alpha was saying. Even the clumsy petting he had been subjected to with Victor was nothing compared to this. He felt something stirring in him and he wanted more, of what he couldn’t say but his Omega side was begging him to let go and let the Alpha do what his masterfully rough hands promised.
The thoughtless breaking of a bond. It had been easily done and without second thought to John’s well being. His fucking breaking heart. He is wearing his blue stripped shirt, his arm in a sling. The omega takes a breath, unsteadily he turns fully towards the large picture window. Up until now he had only been partially facing.
For this reason Mycroft called in his own specialists in to treat the injured doctor. Because Mycroft Holmes knew, if Doctor John Watson died, his brother would not be far behind.
"You're sure? " John didn't wait for an answer instead he sent another quick text, the sun setting just over his shoulder. Sherlock thought it made John appear angelic, his gold hair lit up and shimmering. Then blue eyes met gray, and the remembered heat from earlier had the consulting detective turning away.
He grew up as did most his age hearing stories of soul mates, the theory was disgustingly sentimental. Logic was god to the elder Holmes, therefore love, or the existence of one's destined mate was laughable.
“Oh, look at you.” James Moriarty removed his expensive navy blue suit jacket. “Oh, not so fast! Let uncle Jim say hello.” John stiffened, wishing he had more on than just a plain gray t-shirt and black sweats. His bare feet curling into the soft white carpet, James reached out to place a hand over his belly, a slight pressure. No more than that but John felt as if he were burning from it.
“Uhm, yeah,” Greg answered, shaking his head when he realized Jeremy wasn’t going to risk missing the end of the story. “Anyway, we talked for a bit when I suddenly got a bit woozy. I must have blacked out, because I woke up in a lovely big bed.”
Mary’s mouth opened slightly and then she closed it again, blushing ever so slightly. “I’m so sorry. That was presumptuous of me. I didn’t mean to pry—”
John smirked, stretching. “Shut up. Prat. Be nice to me—one day you’ll find out what it feels like to get old.”
“No. I love your long, hairy legs. And your chest, with those dark tufts, makes me drool. Are your nipples sensitive?”
He turned on his heel and marched back to the door. He threw it wide, allowing it to bounce off the wall, and stomped out of the room.
It was a reminder of a friend who had granted him a chance when few others would have believed in him, who would get up in the middle of the night to give him a lift and a pair of slippers.
John tried to smile, scratching absent-mindedly at his forearm through his jacket. He really needed to get his clothing off. “Yeah, this is it. Probably start tonight. Sorry.”
Janine led the way, with Michael, John and Sherlock falling into step in her wake. The camera, too, was not far behind.
He took John’s hand and led him to the single bed in the corner of the room—what must surely have been Sherlock’s own childhood bed. It was still made with fresh sheets and cosy duvet, with a colourful old quilt folded neatly at the foot.
"Oh, right." The dealer turned and began unlocking the case behind him. "You didn't come so I put it back out. Lucky for you, it’s still here."
A handful of passengers talked and laughed as they made their way down the dull grey surface of Platform 1 and ducked into the First Class Lounge through one of the ornate arched doorways in the white promenade wall.
John smoothed hands over Sherlock’s narrow hips before returning to his task. He grasped Sherlock’s prick and began to stroke. “Tell me what you like,” he whispered, peppering kisses over Sherlock’s chest. “Show me.”
Michael made his way to where Sherlock and John were standing. “My god, that was amazing! I mean, we’ve all heard what you can do, but blimey!”
"I had thought things were getting better with the new medication and that you were able to go back to work."
John’s shoulders sagged. “I shouldn’t. It’s just…it isn’t that I don’t love him or that he doesn’t love me—”
Sherlock stared at his new flatmate. New—well, he wasn’t sure exactly what to call him. Bedmate would do, for now, probably.
John licked the length of his lover’s long neck and nuzzled under his earlobe. “You are delectable, too,” he whispered.
Sherlock sighed and tugged his dressing gown tighter around him. He was not in any sort of mood for his brother’s annoyingly insightful deductions. Or his snide comments.
“How do you feel about it?” John asked. “This will mean more time away from the work. More mess around the house—not that you would notice their clutter. More of my time taken up.”
He leaned in and kissed Sherlock. It was meant to be a quick peck of appreciation, but rapidly turned more heated as Sherlock’s scent filtered through John’s ramped up system. John slid eager fingers into the soft curls at Sherlock’s nape and lapped wantonly at his mate’s plump lips.
“I’m afraid that won’t be possible until I have completed my investigation.” John tried once more. “Tell me where you’ve hidden the drugs and this ends now.”
John grasped Sherlock’s hand and pulled it to his lips. He kissed Sherlock’s knuckles and grinned. “Would you like to go out for dinner with me tonight?”
“I don’t know. I loved you so much I was willing to do anything for you, and I believed that having you—finally—was enough. Now…”
Sherlock quietly began tidying his own paperwork and, without a word, passed it back to Greg. The DCI took it with a furrowed brow.
John smiled as Greg tugged his phone free and starting tapping at a message. “So you’ve got him texting, have you?”
“Fine,” Sherlock grumbled. He rose from his chair and spun to flop down to the floor facing his brother. He squinted at the older alpha, clicking fingers in front of his face. “Mycroft?”
, and the fact that you tend to talk in your sleep, I thought it would be best if we limited your visitors to just me and Margaret. The fewer people to overhear, the better, I suppose.”
Sherlock sighed, entirely resigned and not really put out in the least. “Well, it would have been. Of course it would.”
“It doesn’t have to be like this,” Sherlock repeated irritably, meeting John’s eyes. “I’ve told you: This would all be so much simpler if you moved back in here…”
Sherlock scowled at him, slapping the remote back down to the desk after muting the telly. “But why bring
Sherlock rolled his eyes before looking at his new bondmate. “I didn’t want you to change your mind about me.”
His throat was raw and his body ached. His face was crusted and itchy. His clothing smelled of commercial cleaners from the carpet.
“But one out of four is a significant improvement for an alpha who isn’t ready for or interested in mating.”
“No. No, I’m fine,” John protested. He was relieved that Kit had the alpha pheromones he’d clearly been yearning for, but John was still a bit panicked by the idea of leaving him.
John wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s neck. “I didn’t mean it. It’s just that I’m starting to feel a bit…rotund. But that’s how I feel, not how I think you see me. I’m sorry.”
A few minutes later, the wonderful wet heat disappeared from John’s prick. “John, John. Sorry, sorry. I can’t hold on. I’m going to—”
The coat was removed and thrust in John’s direction. John took it, trying very hard not to look at his passenger’s fit figure beneath the well-fitting suit. It had been some time since he’d been with a man, but he could still appreciate that Mr. Holmes (W. Sherlock S.) was a very attractive specimen. Sad that he should have put himself in such a situation.
He waited patiently. Generally, information like this was intended as conversation—John didn’t always expect a response, but sometimes he appreciated it. It was usually best, though, to see if he had anything more to add.
“Well, I am,” Sherlock said solemnly, burying one hand in John’s hair to pull him close for another kiss.
Greg laughed heartily at that, giving his mate a sidelong look. “As you can see, Mycroft has been pretty busy making sure we’ll never need anything again.”
He froze, instantly aware of John’s stillness beside him. Michael was unfazed, of course, as were the rest of the crew. As far as they knew, Sherlock and John were already a couple. They wouldn’t recognize the significance of the confession Sherlock had just made—they wouldn’t recognize the horror or dismay on John’s face, or what that meant.
Finally, Sherlock began to droop. John drew him down into the circle of his arms. He kissed Sherlock’s brow, over his eyelids and down over his cheeks.
He tore his shirt free and threw it to the ground with his jacket. His mind was flooding with sensory input as his heat began to take over. Smell of fertile alpha. Everywhere. Sound of potential mate. Mate in pain.
John gasped out loud as Sherlock plumped up the other side and fell on it like a thirsty man man offered water. He sucked hard first and then made several passes with the rougher surface of his tongue. He swirled around the centre and then made a wider pass, taking in the whole of the areola. John shivered as Sherlock applied teeth, gently catching the hard nub of the nipple between them and tugging.
Sherlock nodded enthusiastically and dropped his knees out to the side, opening himself wider for John.
Sherlock’s eyes were turning red. It was clear he was as close to breaking as John was. “Who knows.”
Pro: The hottest arse and sweetest cock John had seen in years. And the first time he’d been aroused in an age.
Sherlock hoped so. He’d taken a lot of care in choosing his outfit that afternoon, following a leisurely late breakfast and some crap telly. He’d tried several suits while John was making reservations before finally settling on classic charcoal. However he had picked the deep plum coloured shirt he was pretty sure was John’s favourite. And if he happened to have left one more button open than he normally did, what of it?
He rubbed his hand over his eyes and yawned. He turned and regarded his handsome alpha, still wearing the dark green shirt and navy trousers he’d put on that morning. “Are you planning to sleep tonight?”
“How can you possibly love me in the first place?” John asked softly. “I didn’t expect to be here either, my love. I thought my chance had passed. That there was no way we could be...this.”
“No, thanks. I’ll take it.” John reached out eagerly for the phone. “God knows I could use a distraction.”
Still, if his aborted experiment would not produce useful results, he would have to put an end to it. No matter how appealing he found it personally.
Sherlock rolled his hips again, enjoying the subsequent drag of bedclothes over his own erection. John withdrew slightly and slid back in, effortlessly recreating the rhythm he had set in Sherlock’s mouth. He melted into Sherlock’s back with his hands on Sherlock’s narrow hips as he slid out and back, over and over. With every stroke, he pushed a little deeper, a little harder.
“Very well,” Holmes said briskly. He offered his own hand this time, and John took it with a feeling of relief. Whoever the man was, John had managed to pass his test. “Thank you, Dr. Watson.”
flat. With 24 hours of the end of their mating, John had found himself at a crime scene. Shortly after that, he’d found himself agreeing to move in with the much younger alpha.
“What? No! God, no.” John turned swiftly and drew Sherlock into his embrace, knocking the laptop off onto the sofa cushion. “Oh, god, I’m sorry. Is this why you’ve been so quiet the last few days?”
“They take people who want to move out to the country and show them a few homes in and around the area they are interested in. They show what the place is like, how house prices are, what sorts of homes are available. That sort of thing.”
John fell to his knees, bringing them face to face. Sherlock couldn’t help himself. He kissed John, exactly as he’d dreamed of doing since the day he’d had to leave. It was tentative, and he was fully expecting John to hit him, to lash out for everything Sherlock had put him through.
“D-don’t,” Sherlock said weakly. He settled back into his seat and struggled to sit still. “Sorry. Sorry. Please, sir. Don’t stop. Please.”
John waited a few minutes, but there was nothing more. He swiped at his watery eyes and put his phone in his jacket pocket. With a deep breath, he stood and contemplated the still-made bed. He had grown far less conscious of people’s opinions over the years, but not so much so that he wanted to invite strange looks from or gossip among the hotel staff. He tugged the bed apart and mussed it appropriately—no sense letting everyone know he’d slept on the floor.
They wrapped their hands together around their joined shafts and stroked. They clung together, hips thrusting minutely, hands working in unison, moaning each other’s names.
If John had to guess, he’d have said Sherlock was nervous waiting for his reaction. He smiled to himself. “That…was amazing.”
“It’s fine,” John said, his professional smile back in place. “It’s all fine. Let’s get back to you, shall we?”
“Yes, yes, yes…Sherlock. So good. More right….oh, god, there,” he rasped, trying to keep his voice down.
John’s voice was soft and his tone gentle, if slightly leading. The dark head snapped up and Sherlock locked eyes with him.
Dr. Awiti shook her head. “Your hormones have balanced perfectly. Ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, vaginal opening—all in excellent condition. And Sherlock, your sperm count and motility are excellent.”
“Yep.” John pushed up on his elbows and shifted up on the bed. “Here,” he said, pressing Sherlock over onto his side. He kissed the tip of the younger man’s nose. “Trust me?”
Sherlock lifted the makeshift curtain surrounding the bed/nest and deposited John gently in the centre of the mattress. John settled on his knees, his back to Sherlock. He watched his mate still standing on the floor. He looked frightened.
John tilted his head to look back at Sherlock. He reached up and was granted Sherlock’s tea. He took a sip and made only a mild face at the sugar in it before handing it back.
“I am,” John agreed, laying hands on every part of Sherlock’s body he could reach. “Sherlock, I don’t think — that is, I know we have time, but I don’t…I can’t wait.”
He lifted the covers where they had pooled in his lap. No, no sticky traces. True to his word, John had cleaned him up after their frotting session. Sherlock licked his lips and tamped down on the warmth that threatened at the sense memory of John’s cock against his own.
He stumbled toward the cupboard in the far corner of the small room. He pulled the door open and rifled through the contents until he found what he was looking for. He squeezed a generous amount of the medical lubricant out into his hands and swiftly returned to where Holmes was just beginning to shiver.
“Is there documented evidence of altered taste perception after imprinting? The influx of hormones after bonding would certainly have an effect— ”
John nodded and took a cleansing breath. “I just need to keep reminding myself that we’re all together now and everyone is fine.”
Dr. Watson strolled in after him, reaching to undo his jacket. He pulled it off slowly, never breaking eye contact with Sherlock, and tossed it onto the sofa. He braced his hands on his hips.
“The victim is an illegal from Eastern Europe; Latvia, at a guess. He was smuggled aboard a passenger flight by an accomplice. At some point, an argument ensued—possibly regarding payment for his entry into the UK. He was stabbed with an ice pick and deposited in the avionics bay, where he bled out. The bay in this case has been modified for access to the forward wheel assembly. He was dropped out of the plane on final approach…which explains the mess and the lack of significant amounts of blood.”
Sherlock bit his lip as they manoeuvred John down the stairs. He didn’t want to miss him, but he already did. There was a horrible clawing feeling in the pit of his stomach the likes of which he’d never experienced before.
Jeanette’s second husband, Max, was another story. John listened with interest as she shared Max’s story—surviving war in Bosnia, eventually making his way to Britain and training to be a doctor. It all sounded horribly familiar, particularly when Jeanette admitted that she’d known when they met that Max’s relatively placid demeanor hid a tortured soul, but that she had thought she would be able to help.
Greg’s expression was a little wistful as he turned to watch Sherlock once more. “It’s good to have him back.”
“Ah, I see. Well, we were vigilant. It was easier at this stage, to conceal our true relationship. We had not been together at university, of course. I was too young and far too focussed on my studies. Victor was far too focussed on his girlfriend.”
“Nothing,” John said. “Just something Sherlock once told me about Mycroft. It’s not important.” John finished his ice cream and tossed the rubbish in the bin. “It’s good of you two to spend so much time with Kit. He’s so fond of Mycroft and he’s taken a real shine to you as well.”
“Yes. Of course.” Mycroft reached down to pat the head of the little boy waiting expectantly at his feet. “Goodbye, Kit. Thank you for being so kind to Detective Inspector Lestrade.”
“I have no regrets. The Empire Strikes Back is a classic,” John defended. He waggled his hands. “Just going to go wash up. Back in a tick.”
“Was that nice?” John asked, teasing. “Good. I want you to enjoy this — I don’t mind — but don’t you dare come. Not until I tell you. Is that understood, corporal?”
Sherlock felt a rush of pleasure at the child’s consideration. This was heightened by the “I told you so” expression on John’s face.
Sherlock’s mouth went dry as he surveyed the sand-coloured t-shirt and camo trousers, both of which hugged John’s body — now posed just inside the door at parade rest — in a most flattering manner. The t-shirt was a bit snug across the shoulders; John was not a large man, but he was still quite fit. His arms and shoulders were really quite remarkable for a man of his age and newly domesticated lifestyle. Clearly he had been maintaining his exercise regime in Sherlock’s absence.
He grunted as he felt his rear passage began to moisten. He shuffled around in the bath until his back was to the wall where he had stuck the new alpha dildo. It was the closest in size to Sherlock that he’d been able to find and had a fully formed knot. And he really needed to be full.
“Right you are. There—all set for the day.” Angie smiled up at him as she hit ‘Enter.’ “Good trip in?”
Finally, at half-five he headed down the stairs to meet the cab he'd booked. The drive to the restaurant was not long, but the traffic was heavy. He occupied himself thinking about how he had would frame his concerns to Sherlock about the growing distance between them...and express his confidence that they could find their way back to each other.
“Not now,” the young man hissed under his breath. They’d reached the train door and the stranger tugged John’s forgotten ticket from his nerveless fingers, addressing the porter. “My fiancé has his ticket, but we weren’t sure I was going to be able to join him. May we purchase another fare?”
. Or whatever the hell she really was called. Her shitty past brought all of that to our door, and none of us could have prepared for it. The only reason any of us were at risk was because of her lies. Her stupid, selfish lies.”
Sherlock stood and began to pace. John followed his progress, taking in the clutter and strange objects resident in the flat: stacks of old papers and books (many in foreign languages), maps and photographs tacked to the wall beside the propaganda posters, strange objects that looked very like medical specimens floating in jars on the coffee table, a stuffed raccoon, a skull on the mantel.
“He. Sorry. Well that’s good news. It’s always nice to hear about couples who found each other when they were young.”
Feeling slightly buoyed by the idea, he checked his messages. Sure enough, there it was—a cheerful invitation to grab a drink with an old friend.
Sherlock was reeling now, his mind struggling to accept what he was hearing. “But if you love me, then why…you married her. Mary. You chose her! You left me!”
There was a strangled noise from his passenger. John started and quickly bent to pat down each leg before stepping well away. His breathing was erratic now, and he was on the verge of coming in his pants.
It seemed to John that a light had been turned on behind Sherlock’s eyes. He beamed down at John with a completely unguarded expression.
John pulled back and cupped one of Sherlock’s cheeks in his palm. “It is difficult. I don’t think I can live without you, but that comes with some bloody awful choices.”
“I’d been feeling a bit funny all day, but not like heat,” Greg continued through the veil between them. “I was so focused on the Trafalgar case that I hadn’t paid any attention to my calendar. Tara’d had me on suppressants so long so that I’d got used to my semi-annuals. I forgot when I switched to straight birth control that it was likely to throw the dates off. The last two years I was on my own for my heats anyway, so it just wasn’t anything to get fussed about. It was my fault. I should have been aware.”
“Granted, I may not be as astute at judging human desire as you are, but I did eventually realize that you might be a little bit attracted to me. In some way.”
John offered breathy little words of encouragement and tantalizing groans. He tilted his chest ever so subtly in Sherlock's direction. Sherlock took advantage and moved his ministrations to the other side of John's chest.
He stood her beside Drew. All the adults watched as Drew took her hand and led her over to his toy box underneath the skull painting. The two little ones sat heavily—landing on padded, nappied bottoms—and began to play with some soft, stuffed building blocks.
“At your parents’? What about…Sherlock?” He glanced down and realized that Sherlock had dozed off. “Oh, never mind.” He slid sideways and wiggled and shifted until he was laying full length on the sofa with Sherlock draped over him. He kissed the top of Sherlock’s head. “Sleep now, love. Tell me tomorrow.”
The porter regarded them with mild disapproval—for their lack of planning—before checking John’s ticket. “Oh, well, you’re all right,” he said with a thick Welsh accent. “You’re in a twin berth, anyway. I’ll send someone down with the machine once everyone’s settled.”
“Well, hello,” John crooned. He pulled Sherlock close once more and kissed a trail down his belly. He lapped gently at the head of Sherlock’s penis. “Aren’t you lovely?”
She turned on her heel and stomped away. Sherlock sniffed, as much to signal his disinterest in her comments as in deference to the cold. He stood and tugged his scarf tighter about his neck.
“Noonish,” Sherlock replied. He was sitting up on the edge of his bed, legs tucked down into the narrow gap between it and John’s own bed. He was hovering, surveying John with a frown.
John stepped out of his cubicle and made his way to the sinks. As he washed his hands, he heard his neighbor depart the other cubicle and join him at the sinks.
He bent his head and sucked the flat nipple into his mouth. It was gratifying that some of his carnal knowledge, earned with the fairer sex, would still be of use. He was bound to be out of his depth in some areas. This, though, he understood. He teased and flicked at the warm peak with his tongue, and then drew on it firmly. He used his other hand to tweak the other nipple, causing Sherlock to squeak.
John drew away from Sherlock’s chest with a sigh and dropped his gaze to the fastening of his trousers. “Let’s just get these out of the way.”
“Don’t care. I’m fed up to the back teeth with carrots and celery,” Greg grumped, his voice rough. “I know he means well, but my midwife is mental. I’m nearly forty-five years old and I’m healthy as a horse—if I want to put on a few pounds while I’m breeding, then tough tits.”
John chuckled again. “Because you are remarkable, and handsome, and funny. You make me feel alive again, in a way I haven’t for months.”
John smirked, catching the first drip from his cone with his tongue. “Not a word. What’s the point in being pregnant if we can’t indulge every once in a while?”
“Right. I’ve got you some chicken tikka and rice,” the doctor announced. “Promise me you’ll eat it. I couldn’t find the coffee you like. Chap said they’re not carrying it anymore, so if you want it you’ll have to go to that specialty place Mycroft suggested…What?”
Sherlock strode into the room, hands stuffed into the pockets of his trousers. He stopped in front of John’s chair and waited. “You’re over-reacting.”
John yawned again, letting his body sink into the bed. He felt the dip as Sherlock crawled in beside him. He let his eyes drift closed as his alpha shifted closer. The scent was wonderfully calming.
He does not attend. He has a valid reason (of course he does — he is not a rude man), but the nagging feeling that all is not as it should be plays a part as well.
John climbed up into the nest and rolled happily in the overwhelming smell of his mate. He moaned and reached for his aching cock.
“So a limp, but you don’t use a stick. And you don’t favour the leg when you’re standing, like you’ve forgotten about, so it’s at least partly psychosomatic. That says the original circumstances of the injury were traumatic. Wounded in action, then. Wounded in action…Afghanistan or Iraq.”
John stood with an apologetic nod, suddenly very grateful for the length of his paternity shirt. “Uh, right. Sorry. Back in a moment.”
The two men stared at one another. Sherlock was fairly certain John would be able to hear his heart beating. Certainly John would notice that Sherlock was staring at his mouth. He could hear the breath hitch in John’s chest — he’d heard that sound before. Nearly four years they had been dancing around it now.
“I’m investigating our recent lack of hot water,” Sherlock replied dryly. “And exactly what are you up to, Dr. Watson-Holmes?”
Fran opened her mouth as if to speak, but seemed to think better of it. She took a deep breath, cast one last scathing look at their difficult charge and departed.
John’s hand was lifted to Sherlock’s mouth. Gentle kisses rained over his knuckles and then his palm and then his wrist. There Sherlock paused, lifting his eyes to John’s as he flicked the tip of his tongue over John’s pulse. John gasped at the unexpectedly erotic nature of the contact.
“Skull,” William said, sounding very pleased with himself. He nudged Sherlock with his elbow. “Just your sort of thing. Interesting, eh?”
Sherlock shuddered with want. The rising scent of his omega’s desire flipped a switch in his brain. His libido had been much more on than off since he’d gone off his suppressants, and he’d been pleasantly surprised to discover that he did not find it distressing. He loved John so much—the physical aspect of their relationship was just an extension of their profound connection.
“Barren?” Sherlock’s brows knit together. “Are we discussing having children? Because I really hadn’t even considered the idea—”
Sherlock could not help his pained expression, or closing his eyes against the knowledge that John would never know just how much Sherlock’s area those very things had become. Fortunately, John was nodding at the carpet.
“Hello!” the little girl enthused. She twisted in her father’s arms as John turned to face Sherlock, reaching for the taller man. She tilted her face toward him, eyes closed, lips pursed for the expected kiss.
John had to fight to keep from shivering at once again hearing the velvety baritone of the young man’s voice. God, it was like audible sex. Fortunately, he was saved from the embarrassment of having blown the cover he’d helped to create.
“I’m amazed Drew can sleep through this racket. Em would never have made it—it’s why I left her home with My.”
John grunted, no longer capable of coherent speech. He was vaguely aware of the front door closing and the sound of the bolt sliding into place.
“Oh, lovely. Thank you,” Sherlock said. “You go and get your bag and I will see you both for lunch.”
“My sweet baby. All right, just because it’s a special day. Off you go, then. Papa will put it on for you.”
“By me?” This last was a little quieter. Sherlock hadn’t really intended to expose his underbelly quite this early on, but John was different. He needed to be sure.
“Mmmm,” John agreed. “So since I’m not an ill-mannered little boy, and I’ve finally managed to tell you how much I love you…”
John sighed heavily from his perch on the examination table. “A little hacked off, if you want the truth.”
“I realize this is a lot to ask. I realize we had said we weren’t ready even to consider the idea, and might never be,” Sherlock shifted forward and reached for John’s hands. “I’m not asking you to make up your mind now. I understand what I’m asking you to consider.”
Sherlock leapt to his feet tearing the wet clothes from his body as quickly as he could. John was soon standing beside him, giggling as their fingers tangled over buttons and zips. In short order, they were both naked.
Sherlock leaned in, resting his elbows on the narrow table between them and steepling his fingers. “How did I know…what? That you’re an Army doctor and you’ve been invalided home from Afghanistan? That you’ve got a brother who’s worried about you but you won’t go to him for help because you don’t approve of him? Possibly because he’s an alcoholic; more likely because he recently walked out on his wife. Or that your therapist thinks your limp’s psychosomatic? Quite correctly, I’m afraid.”
John pushed in firmly, not giving Sherlock time to adjust. There was a little resistance—he knew Sherlock would be sore the next day—but Sherlock had been very clear that this was what he wanted. He liked it rough.
He undid Sherlock’s trousers and tugged them, along with the simple black briefs beneath, down over Sherlock’s thighs. Sherlock flushed as his penis bounced free and strained upward toward his belly.
John guided Sherlock’s hand to the juncture of his thighs, and pressed the palm over his own stiff penis. Sherlock glanced down, anxious to see. He gasped as his fingers closed around John’s girth.
“It’s different for alphas, especially you,” John grumbled sadly. “You’re young and strong and gifted.”
“Yes, love?” John hitched her further up into his arms as he swung her little bag over his other shoulder and made his way to the school door.
“And your scent is starting to change anyway, so I don’t suppose we really need to announce it broadly,” Sherlock rambled on. “But I rather enjoyed sharing this news the last time. It felt…nice.”
Sherlock looked around, mentally tracking something. “We haven’t had sex in…three weeks. You are a healthy omega with an active libido. You’ve been going without because I tend to forget about things like orgasms when I’m working.”
“There are some lovely fruit trees in the back. And a garden, though I was never much for fussing with the veg. Oh, and there are the beehives.”
“No.” Sherlock prowled toward him, pupils dilated and breathing rapid. “God, John, do have any idea how you smell?”
John licked his lips again. “Duly noted. I’ll alert the BMA.” He completed the injection and pressed at the site with a clean swab.
“That, too,” Sherlock confirmed. They had reached the front door of Angelo’s place. Sherlock opened the door with a flourish and stood back to let John in ahead of him. “After you, Dr. Watson.”
Disappearing from someone's life had its own patterns. It also had its own sounds: ice cubes in crystal, vibrating mobiles hastily palmed, cutlery on china through silent meals, rustling bedsheets to create distance, hollow laughter, sharp accusations and, eventually, slamming doors.
Sherlock let loose a breath he hadn’t realized he had been holding when he watched the Arrivals/Departure board update.
“I said thank you, what more do you want?” Violet picked up the skinny file off the big table and made her way to the chair that would always be known as “John’s.” She sat cross-legged in “John’s chair” and opened the file in her lap.
Why couldn’t he have just been a scientist like he was supposed to be? It would have been so much better if he would have been sequestered away in some lab, curing Ebola or discovering an alternative fuel source, lessening the world’s dependency on petroleum.
“Not one bit,” John grinned. “But I suppose you still want me to portray you as an emotionless machine in the blogs, right?”
John didn’t know if Sherlock was sad or anxious or angry. But he knew his friend was exhausted. And little wonder too.
be an argument. Even though technically there was nothing illegal about Susan living with them, Mary would demand the lion’s share of Susan’s time with her, which wasn’t fair. After everything she’d been through, Susan definitely needed two parental figures to care for her.
“Because Marie Devine was her best friend, her only real friend,” Sherlock patted John on the knee then kissed his cheek, “Get dressed.”
“Good luck convincing the Trevors of that,” the sneer was back in Mycroft’s voice. “He disowned Victor. Told him the only way he’d be welcomed back into the loving bosom of his family, was to give up his sinful life and his,” Mycroft inhaled sharply through his nose, “’Worthless junkie fag of a boyfriend’ as they used to refer to my brother .” He reached for his tea cup. “Are you sure you wouldn’t like a cuppa, John?”
While Sherlock suffered the prattling of Molly’s spinster aunt, Violet and Mary helped Molly make final adjustments to her veil. After Mary made one final tweak, the matron-of-honor and another one of Molly’s aunts (wearing a dress  equally hideous as Aunt Tildy’s) entered with John right behind them…
Molly looked up, a genuine smile bursting across her face. “Mary!” she started to get up from the table to give Mary a hug, but her pregnancy hampered her movements.
Mycroft ignored the handsome, golden-haired teenage boy hovering over him. He continued to do his sit-ups. He was still rather stout for his age, but his clothes weren’t so tight around his middle anymore and he could do twenty sit-ups before getting winded and needing a break. A month ago he could barely manage five.
John broke the kiss, quickly but gently, so not to hurt his feelings. He wrapped both his arms around the detective the best he could and rested his face against his shoulder, not ready to meet those omnipotent, kaleidoscopic eyes quite yet. “Not like this,” he reached up to cradle the back of Sherlock’s head, carding his fingers through those heavy black curls again. “Not like this, not like this…”
since he skyrocketed to six feet . He had hit his growth spurt when he turned into a sullen, uncommunicative sixteen year old. The rare occasions he actually did speak when he was a teenager, it had always startled Mycroft. Until he got used to the resonant baritone, that is. He had told himself to stop expecting to hear the birdlike chirping boy’s soprano… little Stormcrow indeed.
Lady Hilda whispered, “All I had to do was to run an errand while Tree was at work. And leave the door unlocked and the location of the safe where my husband keeps important documents. A safe-cracker must have come into the house and took the letter.”
But John had shook his head. “No… it’s OK Sherlock, I know what you’re trying to do. I’m OK. I just want to be alone a bit before Violet comes over and before I see my wife in the morning.” A shadow had crossed John’s face, a shadow that concerned Sherlock. “I need to process this.”
“William, of course. I have Mycroft’s balls in a vise. I nearly have the votes I need in the House of Lords to pass my Transparency Bill and demand MI-6 to start declassifying their files.”
But this morning, after the nurse roused her to see if she could tolerate a cup of weak tea and a bowl of chicken broth (she couldn’t,) Mary turned the dosage down. Her belly felt like a swarm of bees had lined up and had simultaneously stung her over and over in the same spot, but again, a massive improvement from having a butcher knife buried to the hilt in her gut.
“Rest assured my dear John, my motives are purely selfish. I neither have the time nor inclination to locate and train a new doctor in my methods.”
“Memory and emotions can play tricks on the mind, which is why I have striven for a life devoted to logic and rationality.” Sherlock tucked his hands into his trouser pockets and stared at his bare feet. “You know I have an eidetic memory. Yet…” the old burning pain flared in his chest again, pooling into his gut. “I have no memory of what happened in the grove That Day…”
“Because I want to view the pictures on a larger screen,” Sherlock murmured, “Obviously.” Then he stood there, humming while he waited for the download to complete. After an agonizingly long wait, Sherlock’s mobile pinged and Sherlock’s elegant fingers flew over the touch screen. Then he plucked the iStick out of his mobile and handed it to John.
“No. It’s a place not a person. A big military hospital in Bethesda,” Violet pressed her fingers against her lips as dark memories started spiraling up, ghosts of men and women who had come home from their first tours of war. “My proctor kept telling me I was supposed to listen to the patients, not interrogate them.” She laughed silently through her nose.
Molly dropped back down to her knees and resumed putting full pressure on Mary’s wound. Her tears spattered down on Mary’s chest, a chest that barely moved with each strenuous breath Mary took. Her color was horrible now, a ghostly pallor. Even so, she could not let Mary and the new life within her die either. So Molly bowed her head and prayed to a God she was never sure was there for a miracle while keeping pressure on Mary’s wound.
Once again, frustration clawed at John as Dupin engaged in a conversation in French with a beautiful woman with honey-colored hair and huge, bright emerald eyes. She was either the hostess or the owner. Other than the bare basics such as
Remember, I'm a needy writer who needs comments to feed my ego.... OK, not really, but I do enjoy reading and replying to comments so please don't be shy!
“I’ll explain later, we need to find Sally now. It’s so much worse now, if Peters is involved,” Sherlock whirled around, snatched the key from Mrs. Algar’s hand.
, she mused, her mouth tasting like sawdust. She looked at the blankets she lay underneath: a creamy-white down duvet and a fur-lined throw blanket on top of that, rich and sumptuous, brown and soft like a mink.
But Sherlock looked fondly at the body as if it was not crawling with maggots but rather as if it were  a cuddly fluffy puppy. “Three,” he said dreamily. “Sergeant MacDonald, the other three bodies, all female, all burned postmortem, correct?”
Violet gave him an unkind look then her attention reverted back to the photographs. “The order is random,” she observed. “That makes me think that the order is not random at all.”
“Didn’t exactly rule it out,” John kept his face straight. But his trembling chin gave away a stifled giggle. “I can catch up to him if you like.”
John lost all track of time and jumped when the door opened, half-expecting Sherlock. He flicked his eyes down to the ugly linoleum floor when he saw it was Violet instead.
It wasn’t just second cousins and spinster aunts who showed up at the church and, worse, the cemetery. The press and the paparazzi had shown up in full force as well. Harry’s murder was splashed out on every tabloid, despite the Met’s (and MI-6’s) best efforts to keep it quiet. But once word got out that the sister of Sherlock Holmes’ blogger was shot point-blank in the head in her fancy Mayfair flat, it spread like wildfire. The rags gleefully dug up all of Harry’s transgressions, her drinking, her gambling, her sex life and her ruined career.
John wanted another drink. He reminded himself that kind of thinking is what got both him and Harry into trouble. “Will you be safe, in Witness Protection? What if the Red-Headed League finds you, pays someone to reveal your location?”
“That’s just for tonight and tomorrow. If she’s still having trouble sleeping, we’ll have to find her a shrink or something. Maybe we should find a therapist for her anyway, with all she’s had to deal with regarding her mother and her piece of shit sort-of-step-father.”
“Do you think I would have made it this far if I wasn’t a good actress?” Violet still sounded bitter. “I should have realized that if Mycroft believed that I’d screw Sherlock over, then you would too,” But when John approached her to help her to her feet, she gave him a cold smile, “John, I know you’re sorry, but I really don’t want you touching me right now.”
Next to the Deputy Director stood Section Chief Adrienne Melrose, his unofficial go-to person and a true “Steel Magnolia” if there ever was one. She was thin as a reed, eyes huge and cornflower blue and with a cream-white complexion that defied her fifty years of age. Her Georgia-born-and-bred was still as thick as molasses and her backbone was made of pure titanium.
Violet had thought the bribe of swimming would have improved the boy’s mood, but he was just as sullen today as he had been yesterday. It was also boiling hot again. It was a good thing John had come early to stake a claim. Seemed like everyone in London had the same idea today as children laughed and splashed in the paddling pools and the adults wilted on the grass.
She also remembered being thrown down on the dirty concrete floor… Jack’s knee on her sternum, a towel held over her nose and mouth, cold water poured over her face… her body’s panicked reaction…
“Sure,” Victor planted a kiss on Leigh’s temple and put her down. “Go find Mummy.” As Leigh scampered off, Victor added as they walked a few paces away from the pouting boy on the rug, “Sweet boy you’ve got there.”
She ached to do more, to run her fingers across those prominent cheekbones then down his neck. To kneel before him so they could be eye-level. To drown in those brilliant eyes, currently the hue of an ocean at sunset. To meet his lips with hers, to discover what genius tasted like.
So instead of checking on Edward, Violet had decided to take advantage of her freedom from Edward. She had been left alone to clean up after spending the afternoon at the lido. So she had tried to do a little snooping. Most of the rooms she had tried to enter, however, were locked. The only rooms that were open to her were the kitchen, the parlor, the main foyer, Edward’s nursery and the bathroom closest to his nursery.
“Violet,” Sherlock became somber. “Once the medical diagnostics tests are run and if it is discovered that John’s theory is fact, they won’t let you be a field agent.”
“Thank you, by the way,” she kept her voice neutral as she studied the tiny young woman. Already, her profiler’s brain had kicked into high gear,
“So, Sherlock knew how to freefall in case the parachute doesn’t open and he wore protective gear under his coat,” Violet ignored Mycroft’s snipe. “He knew Moriarty was going to goad him into suicide, he had always known. There weren’t thirteen options available to him, there was only one. No matter how it ended… he was always going to jump, wasn’t he?” She held up a finger just as Mycroft was about to speak, “But it wasn’t Moriarty who forced him to jump, was it? It was
you. You were my friend. I know you never really bought into that cult’s rubbish. I know you’re a good man.” When Professor Moriarty sighed and turned back to his calculations, she cried out, “Jamie, please, he’s my
“Th-they tell me I’m in France?” Clarissa sounded like she couldn’t believe it. “Um, I’m in a town somewhere in Normandy… um… Mont-Saint… Mont-Saint-Michel?”
Susan stopped crying. Now that one arm was free, she wiped her face with the back of her hand. “Him? That
“She helped us clean a lot of dirty money that we wouldn’t have been able to get rid of ourselves. Her hands aren’t clean.”
Mary crouched down and pulled out her gun from her rucksack. She checked the sights and took the safety off. Violet, with great trepidation, did the same.
“He hired his idiot housebreaking friend to bust into Baker Street to steal the mobile back,” John groaned. “Dear God, what an eejit.”
She set the rucksack quietly down inside the flat next to the door. Then she lifted her gun  and glided into the lounge, mindful of her blind-spots. The process of investigating her refuge was excruciatingly slow and nerve-wracking. But only after she checked the flat from John’s room on the second floor to Sherlock’s tiny half-bath in the back and found nothing and no one, did she feel secure.
“I think you’re a cold fish,” he snarled, wounded to the core that Miss Smith… or whoever she really was… was attacking him instead of flattering him. “I can’t believe I even considered… that I thought I could…” he glowered at the Earl. “She’s all yours.”
“He knows Mary is up to something,” John said. “He told me to tell her to lay off her side project, basically saying it’s not in her best interest, whatever it is she’s doing.”
“Wonder what happened to this place?” Violet mused once the last little lamb got out of their way and Mary put the van back in gear again.
As the cab drove off, Sherlock clasped his hands behind his back and silently observed the building. This was not the kind of place for a man with a wife and young daughter.
“That would be good, yeah, thanks.” John tried to get comfortable. He didn’t even bother to ask if she could pull some strings to get him out of the hospital altogether. He knew he’d have to endure the mandatory psychiatry evaluation period that happens after a suicide attempt, unintentional or otherwise. “Just… stop by once more before you leave for Paris, OK?”
The Professor swallowed then neatly wiped crumbs off his lips with a serviette. “Ah, there he is, the captain, the soldier. One of the many reasons why I admire you so much is your ability to cut through the codswallop.”
“Do not let your lack of language expertise allow your mood deteriorate more than it already has,” Sherlock admonished him. “If Dupin’s appendix were to suddenly rupture, you would be able to remove it with ease whereas I would probably kill him if I attempted.” In a lower voice, he added darkly, “Of course, maybe you should let me operate if Dupin’s appendix does go bad.”
“Yes, this again,” John shouted after him and Sherlock stopped. But he didn’t turn around. John trotted to catch up to him, determined to have his say. “That’s why I stopped, that’s what I was blathering about ‘Not here, not here.’ I didn’t want whatever was about to happen to happen in a dark, filthy place as if it was a secret, as if I was embarrassed by you.”
Then he cupped Sherlock’s thin face and tilted his face up for a kiss, running his thumbs along those impossible cheekbones again. He sighed against Sherlock’s mouth as he felt Sherlock’s hands move slowly up and down his back. He smiled as he felt Sherlock’s inquisitive and clever tongue nimbly prodding his open mouth. As John gladly reciprocated, he felt Sherlock un-tucking his button-down. John pressed his thighs around Sherlock’s hips as Sherlock started un-buttoning John’s shirt.
She snorted silently through her nose. “That’s why you stopped worrying about me trying to run away,” she said lowly, so Alex and the other nearby cops couldn’t hear.
“The Basilica?” Sherlock sounded very much like John after hearing one of Sherlock’s insane suggestions.  John wondered if he had inadvertently stepped into some sort of alternative universe. “Why on earth would I go to the Basilica while the Game is on?”
Bodley licked his lips. “I… never really thought about it.” He shrugged his rounded shoulders. “I suppose it’s possible, although the burning to destroy evidence is most plausible.” When John refused to stop staring at him, he crossed his pudgy arms and said, “Look, I’m not really an expert when it comes to anything out of the ordinary. I’m more comfortable with car crashes or drug overdoses. But, I’ve got a colleague, we go back from uni. Name’s Basil Evans.
. He huffed, still irritated, knowing he’d  eventually have to hold her hand, to keep Putting On the Show.
Violet all but snatched her mobile out of his outstretched hand. She grimaced when she saw the missed text from Mary.
Then he tilted his head, the long black curls rippling down his back. Violet followed with great trepidation as Sherlock strutted around the hotel, towards the back, where deliveries were made.
Violet held up the still-half full plastic glass. The other half was the smoothie was mostly splattered on Sherlock’s shirt and coating Violet’s hand and arm. “Not even close.”
To her mortification, she also saw the rubbish bag, neatly tied shut and sitting next to the door, waiting to be taken out to the skip behind the building. But at least the flat didn’t smell like rotting meat any more.
The Copper Beaches was indeed a handsome, impressive piece of real estate. As well as six bedrooms, it boasted of a spacious lounge, an elegant dining room and a gourmet kitchen that would have made Gordon Ramsey and Anthony Bourdain drool in envy. Detached from the house was a four car garage, constructed with the same sandstone bricks as the main house.
"John leaned over again, kissing her the way a solider kisses his bride before leaving for war. “Stay safe,” he ran his fingers down her face. “Take care of yourself and the little one,” he rested his hand on her abdomen. “I’ll be home before you know it...”
“Ah. So, Sherlock’s bored then,” John reached for a pork scratching but stopped himself when he saw Violet’s facial expression. “What? He’s not bored?”
, very, very delicately, for she did genuinely like the disenfranchised agent as well as completely empathizing with  his predicament. She leaned forward, her head dipped down, then looked up at him, her hazel eyes wide and wondering. “No one will tell me the truth,” she lied in a breathy, desperate voice. “What really happened at Appledore?”
“Well done,” he murmured so lowly John almost didn’t hear him the first time. However he heard Sherlock well enough the second time after he had bolted from the desk to John’s side. “Well done indeed, John. You are learning to observe rather than see faster than I expected.”
“You don’t want to be separated from your friend, which is understandable. But you two were separated for two years. Surely you can stand one night.” Dupin patted John on the shoulder then turned to Sherlock. “Besides, it’ll be fun for you. The basilica is closed to visitors at this time. You’ll have to break in. You would probably enjoy the challenge.”
“John, if it wouldn’t inconvenience you, would you like to be my fake best man at my fake wedding?” Sherlock unzipped his track suit jacket and pushed it off. He stretched his long legs out in front of him and kicked off his tattered “Drug Den” trainers. “Now, about that tea, John…”
Mycroft blinked, nearly tumbling out of his seat. He had literally been sitting on the edge of his seat, balancing precariously on the Client’s Chair, hands on the umbrella’s hook, chin resting on his hands. Despite himself, he found himself riveted by Sherlock’s narrative. Sherlock’s aside about tea shattered his concentration.
Instead of notes to Sherlock’s cases, his little black notebook contained a laundry list of Violet’s symptoms. In his stereotypically awful doctor’s handwriting, he had written down:
“Good. Now shut up. I need to think…” and he snapped his eye shut again. Soon his hands started moving, waving around. He looked like he was rolling yarn for a knitter.
idea to hide the sex crimes committed against your brother instead of telling your parents. Great idea,” she set the cup on the railing. “Good fucking job.” Violet slow-clapped, the effect spoilt somewhat by her leather gloves.
She interrupted her own musing about her shaking hand when she saw a photograph lying on ground next to the books.
“But water can wear a rock down after enough time,” Violet bit her lip, looking into her mug. Then she cleared her throat. “Just so you know… if you and Victor… um, I just want you to know that I don’t want to be an obstacle if you and Victor find that you two still… that you two want to… try again. To be…” she shrugged. “I would just ask that you help me get back to America faster if you and Victor reunite, that’s all. Or, at the least, out of England, I can manage on my own if I could just get away from Mycroft.”
But twenty-one year old Ford had gone to Ireland for the summer to spend the holidays with a new girlfriend while Sherlock’s world went to hell. While Siger Holmes was more mild-mannered and tender-hearted than his elder brother, he did not possess an ounce of the business aptitude Rudy had. He nearly lost the vast fortune he inherited from his brother. This financial malady provided the hole for the Cullen-Culpeppers to slither through into the Holmes’ lives.
“Nonsense, you’re lovely,” Mary stood up as well and the women kissed each other on the cheeks. “You and Greg must come around for dinner soon. Tell me all your pregnancy cravings and I will cook them all.”
“I’ve ruled out Ireland and Scotland, too close to home. New Zealand has too sparse of a population. Australia and Canada are wild cards, but my money is he’s hiding her in the States. Probably the Midwest,” she circled the center of map.
Before Sherlock could answer in the affirmative, Mary stuck her head out of the kitchen and summoned Susan to come help her please. Susan had pouted but went to assist.
Veering far away from the tourists heading towards Platform 9 ¾ , Violet found a kiosk that sold hot drinks and purchased a small coffee. Then she plodded to the terminus she always visited whenever she required a retreat from her double-life, when she just needed to sit and think. Or (to be more accurate) to dream about actually leaving London.
She did a neat little pivot to completely avoid his touch altogether. Let him fall and face-plant onto the pavement.
He hoped and prayed that his own little girl was being cared for and loved as much as Susan was by Mary. He also hoped he’d have a chance to be a real father figure to Susan, so he could show her that not all men are shits who leave their children or psychos who carve people up and cut off their ears just because they knew Sherlock Holmes.
“Oh why not,” Jim crowed. “Not like it’s going to help them anyway. It takes about an hour to get from here down to the village anyway.”
,” her eyes blazed. “I am torn between wanting to switch the telly off then chuck it out the window or being proud of my boy for standing up for himself, for setting that disgusting creature on fire.”
Sherlock watched Mary sleep for bit while he pressed his fingers tightly against his lips. Then he dug into his coat pocket for his mobile, wincing as his cut knuckles grazed the fabric. He thumbed a text to Mycroft:
Sherlock cleared his throat. “Anyway, every time I remove one bug, Mycroft’s agents come in and add three more. He wants to find Violet as much as we do.”
“By Ford,” he said quietly. “You know Ford would not tell me something like that without being absolutely certain. Alastair had Uncle Rudy and Aunt Beardy murdered because he planned on adopting Ford. Then stealing his inheritance.” When Mr. Holmes leaned back in his chair, the leather seat creaking, Mycroft added, “There’s more. The Old Earl’s done. He’s a walking corpse at this point. I’m surprised he answered his own phone honestly. He can’t control Heathcliff any longer. And Heathcliff has gotten into bed with a very dangerous terrorist group. I can’t tell you much more, Daddy, it’s classified. But Sherlock can’t go back to Prague. Not now.”
But John could read just fine, even in the dim light of the studio. “Westaways,” he growled just as a rumble of thunder reverberated outside.
“Ah,” Violet, understanding, slid the diamond ring on the appropriate finger. “He’ll see it as a game. He wants to be friends with the Famous Hat Detective, but he’ll want to steal his fiancée from him even more. The story will have him on every gossip site and on the cover of every gossip rag in this Godforsaken city.”
“Don’t bother reaching for your piece, doc,” the beast hovered over him. “I’m unarmed and it’s broad daylight. Don’t be stupid.”
Then she watched Miss Stangerson gently take a little pink snow-suited bundle out of the back seat. Hope had to bite her lip to staunch the happy tears.
He placed his laptop on his father-in-law’s desk. Then he checked his watch and did some mental arithmetic to make sure he wasn’t calling too early. Then he closed the door to Mr. Fowler’s study. Scrolled through his contacts on his Smartphone, found who he wanted to talk to and pressed his thumb on the illuminated name.
“Harry Potter? From the books and films, surely you must…?” But when she saw his befuddled expression, she exclaimed “Sherlock, you really need to read a book or see a film just for pleasure once in a wh-.”
Mycroft missed Section Chief Adrienne Melrose. Not only had she been the love of Ford’s life, Adrienne had been Mycroft’s friend. Maybe even his best friend, after Ford, of course.
“Mycroft is monitoring him for me as a great personal favor. I figured he owed me one since I’ve risked life and limb multiple times now as I hunt Moriarty,” Sherlock muttered as he skimmed the diary. “John, tell me. Who was the Greek god of wealth?”
“I’m not a crack shot, like John or Mary or even Violet. I meant to frighten Magnussen, scare him into revealing something condemning, I knew he had a secret I could use against him, all men do. But I was still weak, recovering from being shot. My hand shook. I missed.” Suddenly, he looked like he was seven years old again and terribly afraid and hurt. “It was an accident.”
John. Pre-Fall John. Pre-Mary John. He wasn’t wearing the horrid Brut cologne Mary bought him anymore. Sherlock could smell AXE deodorant, plain old Ivory soap and that indelible
you wish to ask me about. You’ve been dying to ask me for over two weeks now, biding your time until the right opportunity presents itself. John said he won’t be here until nine o’clock but as distracted as he sounded when he called me this afternoon, he will be late by at least thirty minutes. So here is your opportunity,” he lifted his mug to her as if to say, “Cheers.”
“I smelt your perfume,” Sherlock quietly informed her. “Or rather, Irene Nesser’s perfume.  Also,” he waved a hand towards her laptop, sitting open on the coffee table, “I’ve been keeping an eye on things as well. I confess, I saw you coming before you reached the door.”
“Of course,” Lestrade kissed her forehead, then her lips. He helped her off the bed and watched her walk towards the bathroom, his t-shirt barely covering her backside.
Irene crossed her legs, not caring in the least that she flashed Sherlock in the process, revealing to him (again) she was bare and hairless everywhere… which was something Sherlock never quite understood…
It really wasn’t as boring as one might have thought it would be, watching someone create a forgery. In a low voice, Sherlock explained the painstaking process while mimicking the Princess’ handwriting at an excruciatingly slow pace. From time to time, he would hold his document up to the computer screen, comparing and contrasting, asking John for his opinion.
, Violet thought again about the millions she stole last spring from the gangsters as her headache intensified. “It’s not about the money, DI Dimmock. I’m not feeling very well, actually.”
, can you imagine? She had to tell grown women to stop calling me names. As if we were in nursery school instead of a proper office,” and she had mopped her eyes with a crumpled tissue.
Finally, the Professor smiled, “You’re wondering why the good lady continues to weep. Well, her youngest daughter has been arrested. Cubans don’t enjoy the freedom of speech that Americans do, and supposedly she was overheard saying something quite unsavory regarding the current regime.”
?” John snorted, closing his eyes in disbelief. “You knew it wasn’t going to be Mary who provided Susie with
He turned his satellite radio on and fiddled with the buttons until he found a classic rock station. Soon, he was humming along to the Rolling Stones’
He finally realized that the strange vibrating noise was the rattle of an ancient A/C unit that was doing nothing to cut through the humidity in the room.
John dropped to his hands and knees, sucking in deep whooping breaths before rolling to his side, drawing his knees up to belatedly protect the most vulnerable part of his body. Violet staggered away but only a few steps. Then she slid down the wall, burying her face in her hands, sobbing as if the world had ended.
me. Keep me in line. Keep me from embarrassing Crown and Country and from tarnishing our family name.”
Violet read aloud: “‘And the Lord said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?’” She peered closer at the page then cried out, “Sherlock, look. All the A’s in that passage are underlined, do you see?”
Violet’s mind, however, had been racing, trying to get ahead of the situation and, more importantly, Mycroft. “What happens if I say no? If I tell you to fuck off?”
Mostly because Mycroft would never let him live it down if he had gotten captured and beaten by a pair of twelve year olds.
He arched an eyebrow at her. “Dear me, I hope not,” he murmured as he put the sausages and mashed potatoes on a plate for her. He wrinkled his nose over the simple fare. “How unimaginative.”
“Who are you sharing a room with at school this year?” Mycroft deflected Heathcliff’s jab. “Another first-year? Jesus, what is wrong with you? What is it about little boys that gets you going anyway? Why can’t you throw a leg over a girl like a
“I know,” Violet agreed, keeping her voice cool and confident. “And I’ve had how many opportunities to kill your brother?” She paused for a beat, “Or you? I have trained formally in kickboxing. I do know how to crush a man’s windpipe. Yet,” she shrugged. “Here we are.”
