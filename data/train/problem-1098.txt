After a couple of more minutes, Sherlock lifted his head slightly from John’s chest and looked up to John. “Thank you,” he said softly. He sounded utterly worn out.
The nurse gave John a small, knowing smile. “Tramadol. We were told not to use ketamine or morphine unless it’s absolutely inevitable.”
“But your eyes, your heart rate… The grin on your face, the colour on your cheeks…”
“What do you mean?”
The nerves in Sherlock’s stomach settled a little, and he walked inside. He walked behind John to the living room. Only then, Sherlock noticed he was limping slightly. “Your ankle was a little more serious than expected, hmm?” he asked.
John stood up, walked to the taller man and grabbed him firmly by his shoulders. “Hey,” John started, his voice calm. “Stop it.”
John felt a rush of relief going through his body. Of course, she knew. Mrs Hudson knew everything. He chuckled a little and couldn’t suppress a smile, but his face fell into the previous serious look almost immediately. “He’s hurt, traumatised and afraid. I’m trying to help him as much as I can, Mycroft is too. But I think I could use your help.”
“I don’t know why I’m here. Mycroft came to me to ask for my help. I don’t know what I could do what he can’t do himself.” John’s voice sounded small, not his own. “I think he doesn’t want to survive this.”
They were being watched. John noticed it when another colleague walked by and glanced inside. Several colleagues had walked past their classroom. A few even stopped to look through the window. Some looks were purely out of curiosity, but most of the looks John saw were between sceptical and envious. He was sure that Sherlock had also noticed them, but that he consciously refused to say anything.
To top things off, one of the nurses had called his emergency contact, which meant that not only he had to deal with his ankle and his shortness of breath, but also with his sister for the next couple of days.
He watched John walk away from his room with a smile on his face and Sherlock couldn’t help it but think that this almost felt like old times. But then, he realised that it was a perilous thought.
“Yes,” Sherlock answered, not meeting John’s gaze. John sat down and waited for Sherlock to start talking. He watched him open his mouth to say something, and then he closed it again.
John turned slowly towards Sherlock. He was clenching and unclenching his fists, and Sherlock knew that wasn’t a good sign. “You are. Lying about your progress.”
It took John every bit of willpower to ignore everyone instead of speaking up, but he knew it wasn’t what Sherlock wanted him to do. So instead he squared his shoulders and followed Sherlock and Lestrade inside.
“That would be nice, thank you,” John said, his voice still sounded a little rough from sleep.
Sherlock glanced up to John briefly but looked down right away. “I uh…I wanted to see how you were doing,” he said in a smaller voice than he anticipated.
Sherlock let his eyes roam around the living room in hope to catch John’s eyes, but he didn’t have any luck. He quickly scanned the kitchen and listened to know if John was upstairs, but John wasn’t there either. He took another look around the living room, noticing that John’s coat wasn’t there. John was gone. Had he been so caught up in the case that he hadn’t heard John leave?
John started to laugh again. He then stood up, took the two empty cups and walked to the door. “More coffee and then get back to work?”
He raised from his chair. “I have to go. Thank you for everything, Greg. I owe you one.”
This was another thing John appreciated about Greg. He knew Greg wanted to know what was going on, but he didn’t push. He never did. Even though he was a DI and knew many techniques to retract information from someone, he never would use those on friends.
John had decided to answer the text from last night, which resulted in a frustrating back-and-forth to get to an agreement. Eventually, he had proposed to meet up this afternoon so he could discuss everything face-to-face instead of over the phone. By the time he had settled on a time and place, he was pacing across the room, feeling agitated.
John returned the smile and started walking along with Sherlock. At the nearest stand, he bought two large cups of coffee and handed one to Sherlock. They continued to walk and started chatting freely about nothing in particular.
When Sherlock finally laid down against his pillow, Mycroft gave his shoulder a gentle squeeze and decided to leave the room in silence, leaving Sherlock and John behind.
Sherlock looked down at his hands and took a deep breath. “We need to talk.”
What if he would lose John?
“Sherlock is not doing okay. He’s exhausted, lost weight and he obviously isn’t feeling well. I think you should be able to see that as a doctor, but I’m afraid your judgement is clouded.”
Mycroft cut him off. “Nonsense. The fact that you didn’t know and therefore didn’t approach him differently made him feel he could trust you again right away, even after not seeing you for two years. You were one of the few people who, in his eyes, hadn’t changed.”
“Four, so far. It looks like the suspect is choosing his victims beforehand.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock let out a frustrated groan and threw his arm away from his head. "For God's sake, I'm not sick!" he growled, looking in John's eyes. "There was just too much to cope with during the session, and my body couldn't handle the stress."
"Continue the partial splenectomy." Mycroft's voice sounded annoyed. John couldn't blame him.
“That is bullshit!”
“Of course it’s for men! I’m wearing it!” Anderson exclaimed impatiently.

Soon, the whole parking lot was filled with kids, and it took only seconds before everyone knew what was going on. It seemed that the plugs had blown in the old part of the school building, causing a short circuit and thus causing a fire. Luckily there were no classrooms situated there, which was a relief.
He glanced at Sherlock, who was sitting beside him. He actually didn’t seem that nervous, which surprised John a bit. But then again, he had to admit that the last two days had gone quite well. Sherlock hadn’t argued with him every step of the way, he’d accepted to rest in the afternoon (although they were disturbed after half an hour by a call from Lestrade), and John had even managed to get him to eat a meal or two. If anything, he maybe was a bit quieter and more absorbed in his thoughts, but that didn’t strike John as an odd thing in Sherlock’s behaviour.
Sherlock stood still with the doorknob in his hand. Although he didn’t turn around, John could hear the smile underneath his voice.
causing great surprise or wonder; astonishing.
John laughed out loud at that.
He was safe. John was safe.
“It’s not.”
“We are not a couple, Sherlock!”
“I did. You?”
After the lunch break, the class started to work on a new project. John had come up with the idea to start a blog about the class and the events that would take place during the upcoming year. Sherlock wasn’t a big fan of the idea at first. It would take a lot of dedication and was probably going to be one of those projects they would start with a lot of enthusiasm, but forget about It halfway during the year. But he gave John his blessing to go ahead if he wanted to.
“They don’t know the half of it,” Sherlock spat. He regretted it right away. He knew John didn’t deserve it. He was just so fed up with everything.
“Okay, everyone,” Sherlock said softly when everyone was silent. “I want everyone to focus. We did a great job last year, but I’d like to keep working on our harmonies. I believe we can finetune those even more. We are going to warm up our voices, and then I want to repeat Viva la Vida. After that, we’ll start with something new. Norah, could you give us a C?”
“Thank you, John.”
We slowly turn on the beat of the music, and I feel my heartbeat quicken. When I look over Donovan’s shoulder, I see Sherlock standing there. The look he gives me is so bright and intense that it leaves me breathless.
“Unfortunately, there will be a lot at stake this year. The inspection is breathing down our necks. If we’re not able to get better results this year, we will be in trouble. We need to up our game.” Lestrade looked around. “As you can see, there are some more changes in staff. Anthea and Bill have decided to leave Bart’s and work somewhere else.  Molly agreed to do year three by herself this year, and Mike will be fully responsible for year 6.” Lestrade paused for a brief moment to let the news sink in. “However, I’m fully confident that we can make it work and that you are the best staff the school could wish for.”
But before John could walk away, Sherlock spoke again. “Is there any chance that you will forgive me?”
“All right, all right. His name is Sherlock,” John started. “He’s around my age, maybe a couple of years younger. He’s quite tall, taller than me,-”
The first time it happens, it’s a Monday afternoon. It’s a typical Monday; it has been pouring all day, the clinic was swamped with crying toddlers, and when I leave work and get on the tube, I am stuck between a woman who smells like an ashtray and a man who clearly has undiagnosed Hyperhidrosis.
“Yeah, that won’t do. You need to eat.” John laughed at Sherlock’s scrunched-up nose. “You know what, I’ll order something we both like. That way you can steal a bite or two.” And while John waved the waitress towards him and ordered, Sherlock tried to hide the blush that was starting to creep up his cheeks.
But today, Sherlock had his last therapy session before he got to go home. Tomorrow he would get his last dosage of pharmaceutical GHB, and if everything went well, he would be released the next morning. For some reason, John wanted to see him before the session and make sure he was doing fine, especially after the events that had happened yesterday. He tried to reassure Sherlock he could do this.
“Except you are not.”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow but decided to let it pass. “Fine,” he answered finally.
"Yes," Sherlock answered almost immediately.
Sherlock beamed at him. “Harry Watson. Clearly a family member who’s given you his old phone. Not your father, this is a young man’s gadget. It could be a cousin, but brother is more likely. Now, who’s Clara? Three kisses sais a romantic attachment. The expensive phone says wife, not a girlfriend. Must’ve given it to him recently; this model’s only six months old. If she’d left him, he would’ve kept it. People do, sentiment. But no, he wanted to get rid of it, he left her. He gave the phone to you, that says he wants you to stay in touch. But you were unemployed and unable to pay for your own phone, and you’re not going to your brother for help? That says you have problems with him. Maybe you liked his wife; maybe you don’t like his drinking.”
“Bits and pieces, yes.”
Sherlock managed to return John’s smile and tried to push the renewed rush of nerves away. The fact that John was still holding his hand made it hard to do so. He briefly wondered if he ought to let go, but the warmth of John’s hand surrounding his felt too good. Instead, he raised his other hand and tried to hail the first cab he saw, with success.
Suddenly everyone started running. The doctors immediately walked away. The necessary devices were disconnected, and the bed was removed from the brakes. Two nurses were ready to take Sherlock; a third stood by the door to keep it open. They all looked at John. Only then did John realise that he was still holding Sherlock's hand. He quickly let go, and immediately the bed was rolled out of the room. Mycroft hurried after them, looking over his shoulder to John.
John nodded understandably. “That happens with PTSD,” he simply answered. It all sounded too familiar. “You know I slept with the radio on the first couple of months when I returned from Afghanistan? The whole night I would listen to boring talk shows so that I got the feeling someone was there in case I would fall asleep. It made me feel a little less alone.”
They both got out simultaneously when the driver pulled the car in front of the restaurant. John looked up at the name sign. “Angelo’s,” he read. “Perfect, I’m always in the mood for Italian.”
“Jesus,” Greg breathed.
“Don’t be an idiot, John. I won't lower myself to such a basic emotion. You are completely missing the point.”
They stayed like this for minutes, and John was almost sure Sherlock finally started to fall asleep when he suddenly started to speak.
Pfew...
John started to move as well, and for a second, Sherlock had the hope he would lay down with him. But John just turned around to grab his keys again.
“Sherlock, you ready?”
(See the end of the chapter for
He reached for the box he kept hidden on the top shelf and opened it. His hands were trembling uncontrollably now, but he somehow still managed to take out the small, glass vial with the clear liquid in it. He held it up, looked at it, and swallowed. Somewhere deep down, he knew he shouldn’t be doing this. He should be asking for help instead. But the helpless, forlorn feeling he had was too powerful and he just couldn’t handle it on his own, not anymore.
John started to lose his patience. He gritted his teeth. “I don’t need any details, Mycroft,” he spat.
The students however, responded enthusiastically when John told them his idea. So he decided to go ahead with his little project. The first assignment he gave his students was to come up with different subjects that they could write about and the various tasks they could fulfill.
"You're still not feeling quite well, aren't you?" John asked quietly as he watched Sherlock's troubled expression.
When we enter Sherlock’s bedroom, the mood shifts. The cab ride was filled with some excellent snogging and playful touches, but now it grows into something more delicate, more vulnerable. This won’t be just sex; it’ll be the start of something new. I realise we only get to do this once, and I’m determined to make it rememberable.
But that wasn’t necessary. The door of the room opened, and Mycroft tiptoed towards Sherlock and John. Without a word, he took Sherlock by one arm and let John get up. Together they lifted Sherlock on his feet and guided him to his bed. When they stood opposite each other, John’s eyes met Mycroft’s, and he instantly knew the older Holmes brother had seen and heard the whole thing. He felt his cheeks flush.
“What do you want, Mycroft?”
“But I’m dealing with a child,” Lestrade countered. “Sherlock, I want you on my staff, but you can’t do this on your own. Clear?”
Sherlock didn’t reply and considered his options. He could insist on being fine like he always did and push John away. But he knew John wouldn’t buy it. He also could tell what was bothering him, but that meant allowing John to come closer, which was incredibly frightening.
John sighed and closed his eyes for a second to shake his embarrassment. “I am really buggering this up, aren’t I?” he said softly. “Maybe we should take a rain check.”
John looked into the room briefly. Several nurses were busy  administering medications or preparing things. He was able to catch a glimpse of Sherlock and instantly knew what was going on. This was bad.
Sherlock didn’t answer immediately. Instead, he looked down at his hands and started fumbling nervously. “I’m doing okay,” he finally answered.
“Good. Start from the beginning. You don’t have to go into detail. Just tell me what you want to tell me. Take your time.”
John waved with his hand, dismissively. “I’m sure he does it with every new partner he has,” John said, but he could feel his cheeks burn up a little, and when he looked at Mike, John knew he noticed as well.
“Yes, I do get to. Now come on people, let’s move!” John practically yelled. Why didn’t they move? He looked at Mycroft for support.
He was pleased to see that Sherlock left a note for him in where he wrote what he had done with the students. There were no difficulties or things they had to discuss, which John was happy about. The last thing he wanted was to start this year with a lot of problems.
“I said don’t,” Sherlock snapped.
and 6
The man was still smiling. “Stamford! Mike Stamford, we were at St. Mary’s together."
And I might know how to be.
“I’ll talk to him. I think I have some tricks up my sleeve to make sure he will cooperate,” Mycroft said, giving John a knowing look. Then he stood up. “If that’s all, doctor Wilson?” He held out his hand and waited for her to shake it. After that, he walked away, leaving John behind.
“We also found-,” John started, but Sherlock cut him off.
He leads me around the building into the garden, out of sight. After walking a few yards into the garden, John stops, turns around and looks at me with big, blue eyes, and I know that this is it.
“Information,” the man answered quickly. “Nothing indiscreet, Nothing you feel uncomfortable with. Just tell me how he’s doing, what he’s up to.”
“I’m fine. It was just a dream.”
Sherlock’s head snapped up. “I am not embarrassed!” he snarled
John turned around on his heels and took a breath. “She will be. But first, I need you guys to do something, okay?” He waited for Charly and Kyle to nod. “I need you to get out of here. The stairs are safe for now, so if you go quickly, you can get downstairs. The fire is in the old part of the building, so you should be fine if you go through the main entrance. Once you are out, you need to find principal Lestrade and tell him that he needs to call an ambulance, okay?”
A moment later, there was a knock on the door. “Come in,” John replied, not looking up from his computer screen. “With you in a moment. Have a seat.”
“Obviously.”
“I don’t need protection,” Sherlock sneered. He started pacing around. “And I definitely don’t need those vultures to do my job.”
Lestrade mirrored him and showed his patch too. “Neither do I. Let’s work together this year.”
“Yes,” he answered casually while putting on some aftershave.
A yawn overtook Sherlock before he could answer. John smiled back at him. “I take that as a yes.”
His attention was drawn to the sudden movements that Sherlock made. His heart rate spiked. John immediately got up and hurried to the bed. He put a hand onto his shoulder. “Are you awake? What’s wrong?”
John didn’t answer.
John told himself.
The kids from year one and two were a little upset, but Janine and Mary were doing the best they could. They had put their kids together, so they were able to calm down some kids and still keep an eye on the rest of them.
“He’s in pain.”
John nodded and reached out to take the papers, but Mrs Hudson held on to them. He looked at her questioningly and saw a slight twinkle in her eyes. “You two are going to be such a great couple, I’m sure of it.” she gave John a small smile and let go of the papers. “Now, off you go, don’t let the man waiting.”
“What did you gave him?”
John clearly tried to keep Sherlock under the impression that they were sleeping separately by pulling himself away when he woke up and leaving the room before Sherlock would wake, but this morning Sherlock wanted to know what John would do if he couldn’t move. So he had grabbed John’s hand. He expected John to try to pull his hand back, but he didn’t. Sherlock had anticipated that John would get angry with him for invading his personal space, but he didn’t. Instead, he had given Sherlock one of the warmest smiles he had ever seen.
Sherlock cut him off. “I’m an addict. Cocaine, mostly. I managed to get clean a couple of years ago and decided to live a celibate life. That’s the reason why I don’t drink. No drugs, no alcohol, nothing. It’s too much of a trigger.” He held his burning cigarette up and looked at it. “The only thing I allow myself is to smoke an occasional cigarette.”
“Sherlock dear, did you hear me?” she asked, and Sherlock realised she must’ve been talking to him for maybe a minute now.
Molly sat down opposite him. “Well, Sherlock asked me to tell you he can’t attend next weeks’ field trip. He asked me to switch with him, so I guess I will be joining you if that’s okay with you.” She gave John an apologetic smile.
Mike huffed. “Even so, he still managed to have the best results with his class.”
“Then why did you? Do you have any idea how humiliating that was? I know you have your doubts about that project, but you don’t have any reason to doubt me!”
John heard Mycroft sigh. He knew what he thought. This was the first setback. It was naïve of them to think it would go as plan, that everything would be easy. They both knew that with Sherlock Holmes, that was just too good to be true.
And with that, Sherlock let himself fall into John’s embrace again, not letting him go for the rest of the night.
“You two really are getting along then.”
“I want to look if it’s possible to make this project school-wide,” Lestrade explained. “That’s why I asked John to tell you something about it. Of course, we must see what’s achievable per class and work out the details, but I think it will be incredibly motivating for our students to participate. Any thoughts? Questions?”
“I’d hoped you didn’t take pity on me, but I see I was wrong.”
"I… I didn't-"
John didn’t respond right away. “I don’t think you can do this,” John said softly, and for a second Sherlock thought he had lost John’s faith. But the doctor took a deep breath and continued. “I know you can. But if you want to stop, if you don’t want to do this, then that’s okay. I’ll support you anyway.” He reached out his hand and placed it over Sherlock’s.
“Withdrawal?”
Sherlock looked up, questioningly into John’s eyes. John didn’t need words to understand what he meant by it.
“No.”
John let out a laugh. “Shut up. He has a head full of curls. Dark brown, almost black. He’s slim; not in the skinny kind of way, but in an elegant way. And his eyes are beautiful. They seem to shift from grey to green to blue.” He paused a moment to adjust the sleeves of his shirt, unable to look Harry in the eye. The thought of Sherlock made his stomach flip and his cheeks warm.
“Good luck with the freak!” the woman called after him. John stopped and looked back at her, but her attention was already back on her computer screen. Freak? What? He decided to let it pass.
Wow, this was a big one...
I'm not a medical expert, but google is my best friend. There will probably be some things that are incorrect, but i'm doing my best :)
“Our colleagues, John. Obviously.”
After having a cup of coffee and a quick chat with Mike John returned to his classroom, only to find principal Lestrade and Sherlock standing in the middle of it, arguing. John hesitated for a moment, but Sherlock had already seen him and John knew by the look on his face he wanted him to enter. When John did, he knew what it was about right away.
I don’t. I already had decided to ignore John the second time he asked; an extra time won’t convince me. Besides, it’s not that I don’t want to stop; I can’t. Not when it feels like there’s a colony of ants living under my skin.
The closer John got to the end of the stairs, the more trouble he had with seeing where he was going and trying to keep himself from coughing and inhaling smoke. But he should be almost there, just a couple of more steps…
John froze. The sherlock he knew would never hit his brother. Sure, the two had a unique, distant relationship with many unspoken annoyances towards each other, but that never went beyond heated discussions and an occasional insult. Now, sherlock had not only fought Mycroft, but he had done it hard enough for Mycroft to be limping the next day.
But lately, I find myself less and less interested. In fact, I haven’t been on a date in months. At first, I thought It was because I just didn’t find anyone of interest, but now I know that my judgement is clouded by a certain dark-haired detective who occupies my mind most of the time.
Suddenly, Everything went fast. From the moment John decided to come along, Mycroft was in control mode. He had cancelled John's appointments in no time and arranged a helicopter to bring them to London. A driver was already waiting for them to take John home so he could pack some things. John went through his house like a chicken with his head off and quickly gathered some stuff. After a couple of minutes of running around, John sat back into the car which drove off to Brighton City Airport. They didn’t speak during the ride.
John took a large sip of his coffee and looked at his watch. Sherlock's therapy session was finished in about 15 minutes. He took another gulp, stood up and put on his coat. He waved at the girl behind the counter as a goodbye, and the girl gave him a friendly smile back.
He leaned a little to the side and looked over the shoulders of the people in front of him. The girl behind the bar had as much trouble with this morning as he did, and the other line wasn't going much faster.
Sherlock’s lowered his gaze and looked at John’s lips, which were slightly parted. Why? Did he want to say something? Or do something? Or was he waiting for Sherlock to say or do something? Or maybe John wasn’t even aware of having his lips parted. Sherlock’s mind was spinning right now. What did this mean?
Greg lets out a frustrated groan and starts talking. Before I know, I’m listening to a lively story while enjoying a second and a third, beer.
“I don’t think we have anything more to say to each other.”
Trigger warning: implied drug use, so please skip to the part where Mycroft shows up if you feel uncomfortable reading it... But I promise, everything will be okay.
Mike frowned a little. “They haven’t hired you already? They are crazy not to; you were top of your class!”
Sherlock let out a shaky breath. “I don’t know how to be,” he said with a small voice.
Usually, I’m a pretty confidant man. Some people think I look alluring and exotic; with my high cheekbones, raven-black hair, and colour-shifting eyes. But going on a date with John – yes, I do like to think that this is a date – makes me incredibly insecure. I know it’s shallow of me, but I can’t help myself. I feel ugly.
When Sherlock entered Speedy’s café, John noticed he didn’t look like the confident, arrogant man he pretended to be yesterday. Sherlock’s shoulders were bent forward; his head hung low. John almost felt sorry for the man, but the bruise that had formed across Sherlock’s face reminded him of the events from the previous night.
“Oh my god. You are serious about him, then.”
Sherlock walked closer and cleared his throat. “Well, I sent Thom to the gym, but he couldn’t find you, so I assumed you were sick.”
“My brother.”
“What’s going on?” John tried.
John changed his tone. “Okay. If you think that’s best. You can decide for him if he is no longer capable of doing himself.”
“I will. See you tomorrow then. If you need company or anything else, just call me.”
When Mycroft gave no further response, John dropped his elbows back on his knees and clutched the cup of hot tea between his hands. He stared at the steam rising from the container.
Finally, Mycroft straightened his back and looked like he was going to get up and leave. Then he spoke again, not letting go of John’s gaze. “John, please sit down.”
Conflict or animosity caused by a clash of wills, temperaments, or opinions.
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock said softly.
“The schedule for the parent-teacher conferences? Today’s the 17
Then John saw the man on the other line. He was his age, brown hair, a bit chubby, wearing little, round glasses. He smiled at him and waved, But John didn’t recognise him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Mycroft cut him off. “It’s not. Believe me, John, it’s not.”
Mike didn’t reply to this but gave John a long look. John couldn’t help it but feel a bit uncomfortable. He quickly looked away and pretended to look through some of the work of the students.
“Aren’t meetings mandatory?”
John looked at his glass and smiled shyly. The evening was progressing pretty well. After having a decent meal, Molly, Mike, and John went to a pub nearby. They had found a table and had John got the first round of drinks at the bar. Once seated, they exchanged some small talk and some thoughtful questions and answers when Molly realised John and Mike had studied together at St. Mary’s. That was when Mike started telling embarrassing stories about their time at university.
For a moment, John was startled. Mycroft spoke to him by his first name, something he rarely did. There was something about the tone in his voice, too. John couldn’t quite place it. He almost sounded... desperate?
Luckily, there was no sign of fire or smoke in the hallway. The path to the nearest fire-exit was short, and in no time, John got the class out of the building. Once outside, he looked around to see if he could find any other classes. He spotted the class of Janine on the opposite side of the road and walked over there with his class.
His voice was barely audible and broke at the end, but John heard it loud and clear. He let go of Sherlock’s hands and pulled him towards him. “Me neither,” John whispered, closing his arms around Sherlock’s back.
John turned around and looked at the receptionist with big eyes. It took a couple of seconds before he knew what she was talking about, but then it clicked. “I didn’t realise today was the 17
“Why didn’t you let us file them? Did you really think my men are incompetent enough to fail to notice them? Do you really think we would be that stupid?”
“Last year has been… a challenge. I was trying not to relapse, but I got in quite a dark place. I will spare you the details, but it wasn’t pretty. Lestrade got through to me in the end and made sure I got help. Not without consequences, though. He made me go into therapy and demanded meetings once in two weeks to keep me in line. He cut my hours too, so he could hire someone who could keep an eye on me. Which brings us two here.” He gestured between him and John.
As the evening progressed, the topics of conversation shifted from work to other things. John found it hard to keep his attention on the conversation, though. Once in a while, his gaze shifted to the man opposite him, and he let his mind wander. Sherlock caught his glance once or twice, replied with a smile and looked away.
Sherlock just shrugged. “Since I told you what happened, you aren’t talking to me like you did before. You are watching your words. That, and you are texting more often these last couple of days which means you don’t want to be here. It’s quite obvious.”
No, no... I haven't abandoned this fic! Life just needed my attention, not to mention my massive writers' block... But don't worry, I haven't forgotten this fic or the fandom at that!
“That’s okay,” John simply replied. He didn’t know what else to say. “Do you want something to drink?” he added a moment later.
Around 9, John and Sherlock excused themselves, thanked Mrs Hudson and went upstairs. Sherlock said John he was tired from the day and went to bed early. John couldn’t blame him. He wanted to go to bed as well but knew that If he would, he would just lay there and stare at the ceiling for hours.
John sighed. “Yeah, you’re probably right. I just wish I could help him more. Take some of the pain he’s experiencing away to deal with it myself, so he doesn’t have to. ”
That’s why I don’t have to think before I reply. “Good luck.”
"I'm glad to see you found the decency to come here in person," John said, putting the cups of steaming, hot tea on his desk.
Sherlock let out a puff of smoke. “You make it sound like he belongs to me.”
John looked at how the man reached inside his suit jacket and took out a cheque book. “If you keep an eye on him,” the man began as he started to write some things down. “I would be happy to pay you a meaningful sum of money on a regular basis, to… ease your way.”
Sherlock turned to John and glared at him. “You don’t have to come with me. I’ll meet you at home.”
When Sherlock looked up from his book, their eyes met. John instantly stopped thinking, and he could do nothing else but stare into Sherlock’s eyes.
“Please tell me you two at least made out already.”
"Technically, I didn't ask anything," he smiles against my lips.
John gave his sister a shy smile. “Not a girl.”
John took one of the menu’s Sherlock offered him. “You want to eat?” He asked, his eyebrows raised.
I reach up with my hand to brush a curl away from your forehead and sigh. I know you were questioning my feelings for you, that you started to think this all is too good to be true. That even after last night, you still believe that I don’t want this with you. But you’re mistaken; there’s nothing I’d love more.
Reluctantly, I stretch out my arm. The touch of his warm, soothing fingers is so soft, that suddenly I forget how to breathe.
“Mine is in my briefcase.” A small smile crept up at the corner of Sherlock’s mouth.
“That’s horrible.”
“I’m sure If John here asked,” Mike began and clapped John again on his shoulder, “he would come running. You should see them together, Molly, it’s quite endearing.”
“John, I’m—” Sherlock started uncharacteristically soft, but John knew what was coming and interrupted him.
He looks at me, and I see his eyes light up at the praise and a slight blush form on his cheeks, but he tries to keep his cool. “Mere observation, John.”
“You remembered.”
He frowned. “I didn’t. I wouldn’t be able to escape; I was too far gone.” But then, a sudden realisation hit him. “I think I had a client who recognised me and who contacted the government.”
It was a busy morning. John had seen five flu cases, two patients with headaches, one nasty sprain, a patient with a deep cut in his foot, and three patients who needed an exam. By the end of the appointments, he desperately needed a second cup of coffee and his 15-minute break. He was just about to walk to the kitchen when his phone rang.
The second method is quite the same, but we’ll use pharmaceutical GHB instead of Valium. We’ll decrease the dosage to zero in approximately twelve days. The downside to this kind of treatment is that we don’t treat the psychological issues such as hallucination and psychosis. Still, we can monitor that and treat it with other medications.
"I don't think that's what he ..." Anthea began, but John interrupted her.
John reached out and took Sherlock’s hand in his. “I am.”
John quickly tried to regain himself and got up from his chair. He didn’t want to know anything more. He wanted to be alone. He held out his hand towards Mycroft as a sign of goodbye. "Thank you for letting me know. If you would like to excuse me now, I have two house visits."
Nobody moved, only glances were exchanged.
The corner of Sherlock’s mouth twitched. “Seems like you still care about me.”
Department B12, room 3. That was the department where Sherlock was. It was a nursing ward with extra supervision, Mycroft had told John. To John's surprise, there were only four rooms in the ward. The other three rooms weren’t occupied, something Mycroft undoubtedly had arranged. Room three was at the far end of the ward. It had a large window next to the door.
After year six, the fifth year students entered the gymnasium. John stood opposite them, waiting for the group to be quiet so he could check the students’ presence. He counted, but he was sure he missed a couple of kids. He counted again but got interrupted by a girl who raised her hand.
“I’m afraid not,” Maggie answered in earnest. “He’ll probably change his mind if you wait too long.”
“I should hate you,” John murmured, his voice strangled, putting all his effort in not breaking down completely in front of his former best friend. He squeezed his eyes shut and fought the tears that were threatening to spill. “But I… I just can’t. The last two years were exhausting, grieving you, letting you go… but hating you was the most exhausting, and I don’t want to do it anymore.”
So he decided to do the only thing he could do. He needed to solve this case, fast.
John gave Sherlock a moment to regain his composure a bit. It broke his heart to see Sherlock like this. He knew what it was like to wake up from nightmares, being someone who had fought a fair amount himself. But to see someone like this, so utterly frightened and scared was hard. He swallowed hard before he started to whisper. “Is it okay if I touch you?”
(See the end of the chapter for
But that didn’t happen. Instead, Sherlock heard a soft chuckle coming from John.
“Sherlock, stop this nonsense. Calm down!”  Mycroft tried, but nothing seemed to work.
John's mind went into overdrive right away. "Did someone examine him? What kind of tests did they order? Do you have any other symptoms?" He asked and stood up to take another look at Sherlock.
“I accepted the consequences, didn’t I? I’m doing everything you ordered me to. So back off.”
With a jolt, I realize what’s happening. This is me, falling. For him. Hard.
“Oh, uhm,” John stammered, slightly taken aback by the arrival of the waitress. “I don’t think we—”
John stopped dead in his tracks. “What?”
Sherlock let out a hollow laugh. “And you think I will cooperate?”
John felt his nerves cool down a bit and smiled at the principal. “No problem. I’m just glad everyone’s okay.”
“I can’t!” I yell, frustrated and push myself up to face the doctor. “My skin is on fire, John!”
Sherlock hadn’t moved. He still stood in the middle of the room with the photo in his hands. When John got closer, he noticed Sherlock’s hands were shaking. “Sherlock?” he began softly. But Sherlock didn’t answer. He just looked down at the photo, completely lost in his own thoughts.
John closed his eyes, pinched the bridge of his nose and breathed in a long, deep breath to keep control of himself. “I want to help you, Sherlock, but you are making it very hard for me to do so,” he started in his don’t-mess-with-me voice. “You are fighting me every step of the way. I don’t know what’s going on inside that giant brain of yours, but you need someone to help you cope with it. If you don’t want to talk to me, that’s fine. But you need to talk to someone. I’m going to reschedule your session. End of discussion.”
Molly raised her eyebrow at that. “Just friends?”
The detective guided John through the door at the back of the café. He led him through the kitchen, opened the backdoor and gently pushed him outside. There, he took hold of John’s arms and firmly pressed him against the brick wall. “John,” Sherlock said in a calm but firm voice. “You’re starting to have a panic attack, and I need you to take a deep breath for me.”
Mycroft just nodded in answer. For a long moment, they just sat opposite each other in silence. Mycroft looked at the doctor. The man had done so much for Sherlock and never thought of himself. And even when he was doing everything he could, he still wanted to do more for him. He cared for him, cherished him even. It was then that Mycroft realised that the words Sherlock had been referring to in his note as “unspoken”, weren’t unspoken at all. The doctor had answered them without knowing.
“Do you need to stop for a moment?” Maggie asked after a minute, her voice soft and encouraging. Sherlock knew she meant well, but if he stopped now, he wouldn’t be able to continue. He shook his head in response and reached for the glass of water on his nightstand. He took a sip and noticed his hands were shaking. When had they started to do so?
They entered the small two-room apartment, and both men started to look around. It was clear Brandon lived alone. There was a small kitchen with a dining table and two seats, a living room with a couch with a tv and a bedroom with a single bed in it. It was clear Brandon had been not too long ago. The bed was unmade, and there were dirty dishes in the sink.
Before I can register them, he seals his words with a passionate kiss. “I do hope this token is only temporary,” he whispers against my lips.
“We do need him to get some answers. And If that means needs a couple of minutes to get those, I’m more than happy to oblige.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“That what we thought, but so far we didn’t find any.”
Sherlock looked up into John’s eyes and felt a little less nervous. The look on John’s face was so open and full of adoration that he again wondered if John felt the same about him. He was close, very close. He searched for some discomfort in John’s face but didn’t find any.  He licked his lips before whispering. “There were some things I wanted to say back then. I…”
John grabbed a chair and put it next to Sherlock's bed as quiet as he could, not wanting to wake Mycroft, who was asleep in the far corner of the room. He sat down and immediately grabbed Sherlock's hand. He ran his thumb across the back of it without thinking.
Mike nodded. “Yeah, state school, year 6. The new school year starts in two weeks. What about you? Staying in town, getting yourself sorted?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Enjoy this one... Oh, and did you notice the rating changed? Just a hint ;)
John nodded and gave the inspector a little, knowing smile. Without further words, he left the kitchen.
Sherlock closed the front door of the school with his keys. He and John were the last ones who were working, but when John started to complain about being hungry, they decided to stop as well.
“It’s fine; you didn’t break it.”
“That’s not that hard.”
The group started running, and after a couple of minutes, John called them back together to make teams. He was in the middle of counting when he got interrupted by the incredibly loud whooping noise of the fire alarm. The class started to chat right away. Some kids were holding their ears against the sound, and some were panicking a little.
Sherlock turned around to face him. “You know you do that out loud?”
“How is it going?”
Ever since he moved in with me at 221b, we’ve had this Sunday-morning ritual. On weekdays, John has to hurry to get to the clinic, and I can’t be bothered with breakfast, but on Sundays, we share the newspaper over a cup of coffee and enjoy each other’s company in silence.
“It’s okay; you’re safe. Nothing’s going to happen,” I whisper soothingly, allowing him to slump against me. I don’t care if anyone comes in and sees us like this. I know he needs this. Needs me.
“Harry’s short for Harriet.”
John shook her hand. “I think I am. John Watson.”
"Okay." John stood up from his chair. "Do you want to rest? I can ask the physical therapist to come by later this afternoon."
A moment passed. John knew Sherlock was trying to deduce what was going on, and he let him. He was just too tired to explain his thoughts to his friend.
John waited for Sherlock to comment, but there was no response. “Sherlock?” He tried, but he didn’t get an answer. He placed his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder and squeezed, but that also didn’t seem to snap him out of whatever was going on inside his head. He cursed inside himself. He should’ve known that this photo would trigger something, that it would be hard to see. He should’ve kept it from him and handed it over to Lestrade.
He also knew he needed John. Now.
John sat back and ran his hand across his face. “Honestly? I don’t know. I thought things were fine, but since we had been out last Friday, he’s acting strange. It’s like he’s ignoring me. Forgets to leave a note, doesn’t read mine, forgets to bring the class to P.E, and now this? It’s like he’s completely following his own plan without including me.”
His hands started shaking. Sherlock refused treatment. He had internal injuries and refused treatment. Was it because he was acting stubborn? To prove a point to his brother? Would Sherlock really go that far to risk his own life, even after he was rescued from Kosovo?
John was waiting at the bar to order when he felt a light hand on his back. “I’d like to have sparkling water,” he heard Sherlock say in his low baritone.
“John,” Sherlock breathed.
“Were you able to catch any more sleep?”
Once seated at his desk, he opened the map he and Sherlock used for schedules and administration and looked for the note Sherlock left for him. He couldn’t find it.
Charly nodded. “Yes.”
Sherlock, for once, had respected that. But it didn’t do him any good. By the time John’s holiday was over, he had thought of every possible scenario that could happen to the doctor. So when John texted him a couple of hours ago with the message that his plane had landed and he would be back at the flat, Sherlock felt relief. But shortly after that, he felt angry. Because how could John be so incredibly stupid? How could he go on a holiday while he was a target of a criminal mastermind? And how could he have left Sherlock alone and let him deal with this situation by himself?
“Donovan,” Lestrade intervened, his voice firm. “That’s enough. I’m still your superior, and I still call the shots here. And if I hear you question my decisions once again, I’ll kick you off the case, understood?” He turned to John. “You should go back inside. I can give you 3 minutes.”
“Oi, don’t you look awful today,” Donovan commented when John walked over towards her and Lestrade.
"No," John replied and shook his head. "You don't owe me anything. If you want to give me one, you can. But don't tell me out of obligation. Like I said earlier if you want to talk, I will listen. But you don't need to tell me anything."
John smiled a little. “I’m glad you’re feeling a bit better. I should go then. Do you want me to bring anything?”
“Oh, I’m glad you find it amusing,” Sherlock spat venomously.
“When was the first threat received?”
“And beyond that, did you realise you denied our pupils proper education when you decided not to come to P.E?” John was getting on a roll now, and the fact that Sherlock didn’t argue with him made him feel even more powerful.
John gestured at his leg and shrugged. “It’s just a sprain, no big deal.” He tried to suppress a cough, and Sherlock shot him a look. “Alright, maybe I inhaled some smoke as well. But they’re just going to do an X-ray and check me over. I’ll probably be at home by the end of the day.”
This time, Mycroft did look from his phone. “Two days ago,” he replied. He seemed to hesitate a bit.
He was moving uncontrollably, every muscle in his body tensed, the grasp on his blanket so hard his knuckles where white. When John stood up, he could see the tiny drops of sweat on Sherlock’s forehead. He was mumbling unintelligible; his face scrunched up in a hard grimace.
When Sherlock didn’t respond, John pushed himself from the man’s chest and looked up. He didn’t expect to see such a tormented, sorrowful look on Sherlock’s face. For the first time during this encounter, John realized that it would be possible he wasn’t the only one who was in pain.
John let out a frustrated growl. Sherlock, I assume you realise as well that this can’t continue, right?”
Sherlock just glared at Lestrade. After a second, he looked over at John.  “Let’s go home, John. We’ve got some files to check.”
I love this weather; it clears my mind in a way nothing else can and allows my thoughts to wander. It lingers on you, upstairs, still vast asleep. I admire your ability to sleep trough this all. But I guess you are accustomed to this kind of weather. Because unfortunately, you’ve been in a much bigger storm.
John decided to sit down in one of the benches at the far end of the row. He watched Sherlock walk up to the stage and stood in front of the group, patiently waiting for them to be quiet.
"Let's get right to it, shall we? The main goal today is to get you out of this bed and walking down the corridor. I also want to discuss your living situation. I think we can manage this in one session, but if it's necessary, I will come back tomorrow." Patrick took Sherlock's chart and a pen and scanned the documents. John was sure the man was thoroughly briefed because he didn't seem to be surprised by what he read at all.
Anderson finally looked up from his phone. “What? Of course, we are complete,” he snapped.
He clenched his phone between shoulder and chin so that he had his hands free to change. “Thank you. I'll be there as soon as I can. "
Sherlock did as he was told and felt himself fall back into reality. He closed his eyes for a second as he took another deep breath. She was right, of course, she was. John was a hero, trying to get those kids out alive. And here he was, being a coward who couldn’t keep his act together. This was no use. He needed to do something, needed to control the situation.
“What’s going on, Sherlock?”
John was silent for a moment; the colour rising high to his cheeks as he bent down to tie his shoelaces. The thought of doing those things with Sherlock made his knees feel weak. “We haven’t…”
“Please,” I answer politely. What happens next is surprising, to say the least. John places a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder to get a reaction, and when he does, my brother looks up and gives the good doctor a small smile.
But it didn’t help. Sherlock’s breathing quickened even more, and he started gasping for air. John grabbed him firmly by his shoulders. “Calm down; you are starting to hyperventilate. Stop fighting Sherlock; you are okay.” He tried, desperately trying to make contact.
Sherlock didn’t stop; he was on a roll now and enjoying this far too much. “Then there’s your brother. Your phone is expensive, email enabled, mp3 player. But you were looking for a job; you wouldn’t waste your money on this. It’s a gift, then. Scratches, not one but many over time. It’s been in the same pocket as keys and coins. The man sitting opposite me wouldn’t treat a luxury item like this. So it’s had a previous owner. The next bit’s easy, you know it already.”
His mind tried to wrap around the words he had just heard. Something about them seemed odd, but he couldn’t figure out what it was. Obviously, Sherlock knew he and John weren’t a couple. He had heard John explain to people over and over again that he wasn’t gay - something Sherlock doubted was entirely the truth, but he had decided that, for once, it would be in everyone’s best interest not to mention it. Because even if John wouldn’t be completely straight, even if he did experiment when he was at university, and even if he was able to fall for a man before during his tour in Afghanistan… It did not mean he would ever consider Sherlock as a potential love interest. Sherlock knew that. Besides, it wasn’t about that. It was about John who was stupid enough to go to the other side of the world with a renowned criminal mastermind on the loose, and the fact that he failed to see why going on a holiday wasn’t the best idea he had. Or at least, that was what Sherlock kept telling himself.
John knew the answer in a flash. Those kids were Charly and Kyle, two of the students from year five who he had missed in P.E. His first reaction was to tell Lestrade, but he realised it didn’t matter. What mattered was that those kids were in danger and someone had to do something. He looked around to see if anyone was getting ready to act on it, but both Sarah and Lestrade seemed petrified. He looked up to the window again. Someone needed to get inside to help them, fast.
“Okay, go!” he demanded.
Sherlock gave a small nod and looked away. As John walked past him to get back inside, he briefly took Sherlock’s hand in his own and squeezed a little. Sherlock barely got the chance to register it properly; John’s hand was gone almost immediately. But Sherlock didn’t miss the warmth and sparks it caused, which ran through his whole body after that touch. He wanted to take John’s hand back into his, to pull him closer, to feel his skin against his own. But it was too late already; there was no one left.
I laugh, suddenly feeling giddy with the prospect of what we can become.
The principal stood up from his desk immediately and held out his hand. “You must be John Watson,” the principal started with a friendly smile on his face. “Mike couldn’t stop talking about you when he came by an hour ago.”
After a few seconds, Sherlock speaks again. “Unless you want to go together.”
But then again, John was always up for a challenge.
“Did you read it?”
Although he was, to say the least, surprised by the arrival of Mycroft, John tried to recover quickly. His heart was pounding wildly in his chest, his hands began to sweat, But the last thing he wanted was to show Mycroft his emotions. He got up from his chair, chin up, hoping that the shaky feeling in his legs wouldn't betray him.
Carefully, he starts to push. Inch by inch, I feel him enter me. His eyes roam across my face in search of any sign of discomfort, but all I can feel is pleasure ripping through my body.
“This is unexceptional. How do you even know he’s not going to walk out again and let you deal with the crap he leaves behind?”
It was barely a whisper, but John heard it loud and clear. It made his skin crawl with anger. He clenched his fists and set his jaw, ready to defend Sherlock in any way needed. He waited for Sherlock to fire a snarl, but he didn’t say anything.
I don’t hear John entering a few hours later. Only when I smell his aftershave as he leans over me, I notice he’s back.
“More than I like to admit.”
The principal looked at Sherlock for a moment, as if he weighed what to say. He decided to give an honest answer. “No, we didn’t.”
“Sherlock’s alive, John.”
Time passed by quickly, and soon it was almost 8.40. John took a deep breath, a new rush of nervousness overtook him. He stood up and started pacing around the classroom.
“Let’s get to work as soon as we’ve cleaned up a…” John started, but Sherlock began to speak, as well.
John stared at the note in his hand. Minutes passed by. He re-read it, desperately trying to remember every word of it, trying to understand what Sherlock had tried to say to him. But he couldn’t. His emotions got the better of him.
“I can see you struggling.”
“all right, you need to snap out of this. I know you’re probably thinking about all kinds of things right now, but it’s no good.” Mrs Hudson tried in a calm voice. “Come on, take a deep breath.”
Sherlock swung around and glared at John. “Why?” He spat. “So you can introduce me to her? How adequate of you.” He couldn’t keep his anger from his voice.
John felt the anger creeping into his body and knew that he could not control himself for much longer. Usually, he was able to control his anger. He had learned this during army training. But Mycroft had turned John’s life upside down too many times now. The man didn’t seem to have no problem pretending that someone was dead, to let someone do the dirty work "for the governments’ best interest," or to send one of his relatives away on a suicide mission. No, he didn’t have any goodwill left for the older Holmes brother.
“Vultures?”
The line of the local coffee bar was the longest around 8:30 in the morning. John knew that. And he usually wouldn’t dare to stand in that line, but today he just needed a decent cup of coffee.
Ooooh, we’re nearing the moment suprême! 💕
Sherlock scoffed, anger flashing in his eyes.  “Why would I? So I can be your little charity case again? So you can be the big brother who saves the day, again? No, thank you. I’d rather die. Now, get the hell out!”
After a second, Sherlock backed away a bit, a new wave of uncertainty overcame him. His eyes roamed over John’s face again, searching for something. He still needed reassurance. Sherlock looked into John’s eyes questioningly, and John understood.
I also want to thank you guys for leaving kudos and comments. They really make my day! So if you have a second, please leave a comment behind! I promise it will make me smile! :)
“Hmm?”
,’ he thought. ‘
“Sherlock?” John managed to say. His voice was barely a whisper. He moved forward a little and placed his hand on Sherlock’s knee. “It’s okay. Just tell me what you want to say.”
Lestrade snorted in answer. “For someone who calls himself a sociopath, you are a terrible liar. Why did you do it in the first place? Even you must know taking evidence from a crime scene isn’t a smart move. Did you really want to make us do another drugs bust? Because you know we would.”
“I think we have to if it comes down to it.”
The detective walked towards the window in hope to calm himself a bit, but it didn’t help. He knew he couldn’t hold himself together much longer. He
But the man ignored the question. “I got started on the first weeks’ schedule. Together we can work out the rest. Meet me tomorrow at 11 o’clock. Sorry, got to dash, I think I left violin case in the music room.” The man started to walk towards the door.
“Oh, shit.”
“Goodmorning, dr. Watson, how was your weekend?” she asked and gave him a small smile.
Lestrade looked at Sherlock and let the words sink in. He seemed to consider his options for a moment. Then, he sighed and continued, some of his anger replaced by disappointment. ”You know, I really want to, but I can’t. I can’t trust you after this. Because here you are; obstructing the investigation, while there are men out there who are being tortured.”
“Did you sleep well?”
“I believe so, yes.”
“Hey,” John said quietly in hope to wake Sherlock from his train of thoughts. “Are you okay?
Sherlock raised his own arms and pulled John closer. “I’m happy you chose to come with Mycroft as well, John,” he mumbled against his shoulder.
They stood there for several minutes, John slumped against Sherlock’s chest with his own chest heaving and tears flowing freely, and Sherlock with John’s hands in his, patiently waiting for the doctor to calm down.
Mrs Hudson shook her head. “You don’t give yourself much credit, do you? I don’t think you realise what a relief it is to see him like this.”
John was already at the door to enter when two nurses pushed him aside and ran inside. They acted quickly and injected a drug into Sherlock's drip. In no time, Sherlock stopped kicking and fell asleep almost immediately.
“You’ve already asked plenty of times. I’m asking you now.”
Because Sherlock Holmes felt anxious, frustrated and angry.
John wanted to say something, but he didn’t know how to respond. He was flattered that Sherlock was sharing this with him, touched even. He knew it couldn’t be easy for him to do so. Just when he stepped closer to Sherlock, he spoke again.
It took another ten minutes before John heard a soft knock on the door of the waiting room. John stood up immediately, and so did Mycroft. Without waiting, a resident entered. He definitly was in a hurry.
“Cheers mate!”
Sherlock didn’t answer. John walked a bit further into the room and looked around. There had to be something that triggered this. He started walking. His mind went a thousand miles per hour. There was no radio on. He checked if the TV was still on, but it was turned off. There was no book, so Sherlock hadn’t read something that might have upset him. The lights were on, so it wasn’t the darkness that caused him to panic. He went through the conversation earlier this evening. Was it something he said? Was it something he did? But he couldn’t think of anything.
John started to worry. These were definitely signs of internal injuries.
When John finally had his emotions under control a little, he tried to speak again. “You know,” he started, his voice hoarse. “At one point, I thought people were going to be right about us.”
I walk to the sofa and let myself fall, determined not to get off of it anytime soon. I need to re-evaluate yesterday’s events and figure out what to do with this situation before John gets home. Closing my eyes, I let myself sink into my thoughts.
Sherlock raises an eyebrow. “What for?”
“Yeah, I think we just lost our reservations,” John said as he walked up to Sherlock to stand next to him.
Sherlock woke up abruptly and sat up with a jolt. He looked around in fear, eyes searching for something he could recognise. His first thought was John. He needed to know John was okay. He was shaking, his breath was ragged, and he could feel the strains of tears on his cheek. But that didn’t matter. He needed to find John.
“No.”
“Why?”
“There’s a note.”
Sherlock faced away from Mycroft, and Mycroft knew he had to push through. “You know you flatlined? Twice? Even though you eventually decided to live, you almost died.”
When John entered, Norah and Penny noticed him right away. “Mr Sherlock? Mr John is here!” Norah called.
“But the case…” Sherlock tried, but he knew it was no use. The only thing he got in return, was a furious glare.
“We’re colleagues; he’s my partner,” John started. A quick look told him the man knew that already. “And we’re… friends,” he added cautiously.
years.”
“Sorry, sorry! I know I’m not supposed to laugh,” John snickered. “You are an idiot; you know that? I’m not going anywhere, Sherlock. And I’m sorry I let you think I bailed on you. Please believe me when I say you are the most interesting, brilliant person I’ve had opposite me. And not to mention, incredibly attractive as well.”
“What?” He turns away from the window and looks at me, and for a second, all I can think is how mesmerizing he is in the passing city lights. “I never send us to the wrong location?”
John used his last resort. “Sherlock. Now,” he said in his Captain-voice.
“Seriously, though,” John started after they stopped laughing. “why did you try to push me away?”
“Four days,” John repeated and clenched his fist under the table in an attempt to control his anger. “And you told Molly, Mycroft and people of your homeless network.”
“Hey John, I thought you didn’t work on Fridays?” Molly asked friendly.
Anderson huffed. “Don’t pretend you worked that out. Someone told you that.”
John was about to ask another question about Sherlock, but principal Lestrade cleared his throat, and the attention in the room shifted to him at once. “Welcome everybody. I hope you all had a pleasant summer holiday.” Some teachers nodded their heads. “I will keep this meeting as short as possible; I know you’re all busy preparing the upcoming year. First, the good news. I’d like to welcome our new colleague John Watson, who will teach physical education to the upper years and will be teaching our year four together with Sherlock this year.”
John heard Mike sigh a little while he was grasping in his pockets. “Sorry, left mine in my classroom.”
“Hey! Believe it or not, but this is me being interested in your love life.”
“Hey, it’s okay,” he said softly and waited for Sherlock to look at him. “It doesn’t hurt that bad. Plus, I should’ve known better than to touch you,” he continued and gave Sherlock’s hand a soft, reassuring squeeze. “Rookie mistake.”
“A quarter to eight,” Sherlock answered as he closed the door and walked to the street to hail a cab. Only when John didn’t follow, he realized what the problem was. “Oh.”
John watched the bartender walk towards the tap. When he was gone, he felt how Sherlock bent towards him. “Thanks for the invite,” he whispered and returned to the table, leaving John standing at the bar with a blush on his cheeks again.
He suddenly felt a little guilty, realising he was the reason John hadn’t slept well. When they finally got upstairs last night, it was nearly three o’clock in the morning. They went to bed in silence, but John had known precisely what Sherlock needed. He had taken the detective in his arms and had pressed him close against his chest, not caring about the fact they had pretended their sleeping arrangement was a secret to the other. Sherlock was gone immediately, but that was only because he knew John would watch over him, which he apperantly had done at the expense of his own sleep.
John had expected Mrs Hudson to burst out in tears by the mere sight of Sherlock being back in living form and was ready to comfort her, but she didn’t. Instead, there only was fondness in her eyes.
John started to get frustrated. He turned his body to Sherlock, stared at him for a moment in disbelief. “Where is this coming from?”
“Your dad’s?”
“Do you?!” John suddenly yelled, unable to control his anger any longer. “I don’t think so. Because if you knew, you would’ve let me know that you were alive!”
John's sleep was roughly disturbed around 2:30 by his phone. It took a while before he registered what was happening. Only when he heard the sound for a second time did he realise that it was his telephone. He shot up immediately. This could not be a good sign.
Of course, Sherlock didn’t miss the hidden message. He easily could deduce what was going on. An ex-girlfriend who felt guilty, probably because she had cheated on John, or at least kissed with someone else. Not recently, though.
“Do you want to?” Sherlock asked, unable to keep the disappointment out of his voice.
“Is he all right?”
Sherlock kneeled before the two kids and gave them a brief moment to catch their breaths. “Are you two all right?”
“Fine,” John managed to answer through gritted teeth.
“No,” Sherlock answered, his voice sounding small.
“Thank you,” Sherlock managed to say.
To form a picture in your mind of what something might be like
I don’t get time to respond; before I know, she has turned around and walks away with John, leaving me behind, blinking.
“Undoubtedly,” Sherlock answered without looking up. He reached out his hand and waited for Lestrade to give him the files.
Greg cracked a small, knowing smile. “There’s coffee if you want. Would you like me to make you some breakfast?”
“The Italian place we’ve been to before?”
“I’m okay, just a little tensed,” he answered in honesty.
The man looked at John defiantly. “I know you’ve been teaching abroad and you’ve been invalided home from Afghanistan. You’ve got a brother worried about you, but you won’t go to him for help because you don’t approve of him, possibly because he’s an alcoholic, more likely because he recently walked out on his wife. I know you’ve got a license to teach physical education, but you are insecure about it because of your shoulder, your left if I’m not mistaken. That’s enough to go on with, don’t you think?” The man walked out of the classroom but looked back at John halfway through the door. “The name is Sherlock Holmes. I’ll see you tomorrow.” He gave John a small wink and greeted Mike. “Afternoon.”
Sherlock jerked up his sleeve and showed a nicotine patch on his arm. “I don’t even smoke.”
Mycroft kept his face completely blank. “Yes, In the end, I think you will. For him, you will.”
Sherlock listened to how John walked down the stairs and closed the front door behind him. He knew John was right; he did feel exhausted. Besides, it would be incredibly foolish of him to ignore John’s orders. He lay down on the sofa with his back towards the room and closed his eyes, hoping to catch some sleep.
“Am I keeping you from your appointment at Hills?”
After quickly checking Alice’s vitals again, he brushed her hair away from her face and saw immediately where she had hit her head. Luckily there was only a small head wound, but the large bump on her forehead was clearly visible. He looked for other injuries, but he couldn’t find any.
They stared at the door for a long moment, and John hesitated on what to do.
“You interviewed them, friends, relatives, colleagues?” Sherlock asked. He didn’t wait for an answer but stood up and started pacing across the room, clearly not paying attention to the conversation anymore.
Sherlock just nodded in answer, and John managed to provide him with a small smile. “Listen, I will ask if your session still can continue this afternoon. I’ll come back afterwards; I have to go somewhere. Let’s pretend this conversation never happened when I get back, yeah?”
John just stood in the middle of the street and looked at how Sherlock walked away, unable to move yet. He tried to process what had happened, but all he could think of was the feeling of Sherlock’s lips against his and the taste of Sherlock that lingered on his tongue. He had kissed Sherlock. And even better, Sherlock had kissed him back. They were finally done dancing around each other, finally able to come clean about their feelings. John liked Sherlock, and Sherlock clearly liked John as well. The realization made him feel utterly giddy with everything, and it was the best feeling in the world.
“I’m… Sorry?”
After long minutes, Sherlock noticed John’s unsteady breathing. For the first time, he looked up at the man, who looked down at him and gave him a glimpse of a smile. Tears were pooling from his dark blue eyes, but he didn’t seem to care. John pressed Sherlock closer against his chest.
So Sherlock had done the only right thing to do; he had turned around and walked back home where he had landed on the sofa to sulk for days.
“What?!” John exclaimed, his voice raised. “You seriously think I should’ve asked for your permission?”
John didn't say anything. Sherlock was describing Baker Street as the house where he would return to like it was the most normal thing. He knew he couldn't avoid the subject anymore, knowing one of the next questions would be if Sherlock had any support at home. John made up his mind quickly. He couldn't leave Sherlock alone even if he wanted to. He could at least stay with him until he was feeling better. They would sort out the rest later.
“Personal stuff. He said he wouldn’t be back in time for an appointment, but wouldn’t tell me what kind.”
“Why are you not answering your phone?” John heard Mycroft say. His usual, composed tone was completely gone.  “I’ve been trying to contact you for fifteen minutes!”
“Dr. Watson,” Dr. Wilson spoke before John could exit the office. “I know it may be a little hard to believe right now, but we are on the same team here.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Lestrade didn’t miss the urgency in John’s voice. “Of course,” he answered with a nod.
“As you wish.”
He groped for his phone in the dark and answered. "Hello?" His voice sounded rough and thick with sleep.
“Will Alice and Mr John be okay?”
John did his best to finish in time, but when the still buzzer went off, he had the feeling he was behind on everything. This wasn’t the way how he wanted to start the week. He sighed, stood up and walked to the door.
"Stop."
“It’s okay; you are safe. I’m with you,” John whispered. “Try to relax. It’s going to be okay, love. I’m not going anywhere.” John was only vaguely aware of what he just had said. For a brief moment, he wondered if Sherlock had heard it.
Before Sherlock could speak, someone interrupted him. “Can I get you two anything? A refill, something to eat?”
“How did you know?”
More colleagues started to come up with ideas, and John felt a weight fell off his shoulders. The fact that his own class was dedicated to the project was great, but he didn’t expect that his colleagues were that enthusiastic as well.
After several minutes, Sherlock spoke again. “John? Can I confess something?”
This made Sherlock stop dead in his tracks. John never asked, never begged. He turned around and walked up to John. He sighed and tried to find the right words to convince him. “Listen,” he started in a softer voice.” I have to prove to myself I can handle this. Do you understand? I have to do this. I know it’s hard for you to understand, but it’s something I need to do.” He looked down at John and gave him a small smile. “You know it would be a lot easier for me if you would join me, don’t you?”
That was odd. Sherlock had written a note for John every time he had to teach the next day and John had done the same if Sherlock would be teaching the next day. He was sure there would be a note somewhere. He looked again, searched under the map, in the stack of paper on the corner of the desk, looked for it on the ground, but he found nothing.
On another note: I would love to get in contact with some of you! I'm relatively new to this community, and I absolutely love it, but I don't know what's the best way to reach out to you guys. So if you would also like to chat with me about Sherlock, or maybe even would like to write some stuff with me, feel free to leave a comment! That way, we could find a way to chat with each other :)
“Oh, but you did. Remember the time we had to call Lestrade because we were lost?”
“Are you all right?”
John turned around to continue to Anderson, leaving Sherlock and his class behind. To his surprise, Anderson wasn’t paying attention to his class, but looking at his phone.
Because some demons just can’t be beaten.
John let out a small sigh. “good, that’s good. We don’t want another relapse.” He returned his attention to Sherlock. His chest was still heaving, but apart from that, he looked a lot calmer. His head snapped at John, and the look in his eyes told John he was about to pick a fight with him. John knew it was best to walk away now.
“Hey,” Sherlock managed to say. His voice sounded rough.
He followed her into her own apartment and set down at the kitchen table. He watched her make tea and suddenly found it hard to break the news to her. She had been there for him when Sherlock went away. She came by every other day to check up on him and had been a tremendous help with little Rosie the first few months. Even though she missed Sherlock incredibly, she had stayed strong for John and kept her hopes up for him. She had not blamed him when he finally told her he was going to leave London. She understood. But John knew it was hard for her to see another of “her boys” leave.
Sherlock shot up. “I tried John, I really did,” he almost pleaded before John got the chance to say anything. “But I just can’t sleep.”
But John didn't answer. He stood in the middle of the room, unable to move. He started to feel sick. He turned quickly, grabbed the closest spit tray and vomited.
When John arrived at Sherlock’s room, he was surprised to see that the therapist was already there. He looked at his watch, but he was sure the appointment wasn’t scheduled for half an hour. The therapist was talking with Sherlock, but it didn’t seem like they had already started. When she saw Sherlock looking past her to John, she turned around and walked towards him.
Fortunately, there was nobody there. He took two cups from the cupboard and switched on the kettle. Only then did he notice that his heart was still reeling, his hands sweaty. He sighed deeply, trying to regain his composure.
John snorted. “Well, thank God you’re above all that.”
Mary and Philip were about to argue on that when Lestrade came between them. “That’s enough. This meeting isn’t about last year, and definitely not about Sherlock. It has been discussed, and as you can see, agreements were made, and consequences were accepted. End of discussion.” Lestrade looked around the group of people with a stern gaze. No one dared to argue anymore.
Sherlock suddenly reminded himself that he should do something and hesitantly placed his free hand on the back of John’s head. John answered by reaching up to cup his cheek with his own free hand and pulled Sherlock a bit closer, deepening their kiss. Sherlock felt the soft brush of John’s tongue against his lips. He realized it was a silent question, one he was only eager to answer. He opened his lips a bit and let his tongue touch John’s, trying to capture his taste. He tasted like toothpaste and tea, fresh and spicy and uniquely
Neither one of the men seemed to want to start the conversation. For moments they stood opposite to each other, waiting for the other to take the first step. The thick, uncomfortable silence hung between them. John searched for the right words to open the conversation, but nothing came to mind. After a few more full seconds, Mycroft coughed softly.
John arrived early at the hospital the next morning. In two days, Sherlock would be able to go home. Now that they had established that he would be coming back to Baker Street, John couldn’t help but feel a little excited. It felt like they were finally on the right track to becoming themselves again. To be able to fix what was broken, even though John didn’t know exactly what it was that was broken. It felt good to be alone with Sherlock once again, just the two of them. He was aware that there were still going to be so many things to conquer and that it would be a long and hard road to do so. But he knew they were going to survive it, together.
“Some cold cases.”
John spun around and saw Sherlock standing in the door opening with a smile on his face. He was taken aback for a moment but tried to recover quickly. It was the daring, playful look in Sherlock’s eyes convinced John to join his class.
New Scotland Yard hadn’t changed a bit. The tall, white building still had the same stately appearance as before, and the sign was still standing proudly at the entrance. The reception and the hallway hadn’t changed much as well. Well, the only noticeable thing was that they had repainted the stairs somewhere over the last year but other than that, everything still looked the same.
John decided to break the silence. “Why did you tell me though?” he asked, his voice soft and friendly again. “I am your colleague, as well.”
John gave Greg an apologetic look and followed Sherlock.
John hesitated for a moment and went through the options in his head. The first method was not ideal, John was afraid that Sherlock would become depended on Diazepam, but to give him GHB to detox from said drug felt contradictive. Then again, it was the best option available.
“I…” John started, but the voice on the other side of the line cut him off.
And last: THANK YOU so much for all the kudos and comments, again. You really are the best, and it really makes my day. So I make you a deal: I will try to update as soon as possible, and you write me a comment. Sounds good, yeah? Thought so!
A sharp pain shot through John’s ankle and he almost stumbled and fell. The breath he was holding rushed out of his lungs and he started coughing immediately. He tried to breathe through his nose, but that only made it worse. The step he tried to take made him yell out in pain, but he knew he had to keep going. They were almost there, almost at the door. After another two painful steps, he hit the door and tried to reach the door handle. He opened it and tumbled out of the staircase, coughing violently.
John sped up his pace and looked for the right direction on his phone while he was walking. It took him less than five minutes to walk to the address Sherlock had given him. He walked up the doorstep and wanted to send a message to Sherlock that he was waiting for him outside, but the door already swung open. Sherlock greeted him with a shy smile and walked out of the apartment. His eyes were glistening with excitement, and John could see he was eager to start the new school year.
“GHB?”
Sherlock took a deep breath. "John, I think I owe you an explanation."
“You know, when I left,” Sherlock started, still not looking at John. “I didn’t think I would be able to see you again. I thought it was our final goodbye. I knew I had to try, though. That’s why I managed to stay alive for so long. And then, something snapped. I didn’t see the light at the end of the tunnel anymore.” He took a deep, shaky breath. “I gave up.”
Can’t wait to see what will happen in week two!
John closed the tap of the sink, took his towel to wipe off the remains of his shaving cream. He looked in the reflection of the mirror and saw Harry leaning against the door frame of his bathroom. She was giving him a daring look, and John knew his sister knew what was going on.
Sherlock opened his mouth to say something but snapped it shut again. He knew this was an argument he couldn’t win. They stared at each other, waiting for the other to say something, but nothing came. After a minute, Sherlock admitted his defeat, stood up from the floor and walked over to the sofa.
Harry grinned and raised her eyebrows. She wasn’t going to let him off the hook that quickly and John knew it. “Around dinnertime, eh? Don’t lie to me, little brother. You are going on a date!”
“Looks like it.”
John raised his eyebrows. He had not expected this question. Of course, they wouldn’t return to Baker Street. It wasn’t theirs to come back to anymore. “I don’t think so. I don’t want you to have to kick someone out because of us.”
When Mike got back with three beers and a coffee, he asked everybody’s opinions about the plans for the upcoming field trip, which led to a new topic of conversation.
When he entered through the front doors of the school, John was greeted by a new face. An older looking woman sat at the reception desk. When she saw John entering the building, she stood up immediately. “You must be our newest addition!” she said enthusiastically, holding out her hand through the window.
Sherlock looked up at the sudden fierceness of John’s voice. “Okay,” he answered eventually and let go of John’s hands.
“Tell me you got some theories, Sherlock,” Lestrade asked right away.
“I haven’t spoken to him yet,” Sherlock mumbled.
Before Sherlock could offer to take care of the tea, John walked towards the kitchen. Sherlock sat down in one of the chairs and watched him while John rumbled through the kitchen. He was surprisingly cheerful, Sherlock noticed. He had a small hint of a smile on his face almost constantly while he was making tea, and Sherlock wondered what caused it. He looked around. There was something different about John’s apartment, something he couldn’t quite place. His eyes lingered on the purse next to the sofa.
Sherlock closed his eyes briefly, took another breath and shifted a little so that John was out of his direct line of sight. It made it easier to talk. “Okay, I’m ready.”
Mycroft intervened. “Doctor Watson is right. My dear brother will, unlike every other human being, be best off when he experiences the detox. Only that will keep him from slipping. And I’m not going to pick him up again if he falls.”
“Okay, we’ll ask someone to help.” John shifted slightly. “Let me just call someone.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“And who do you think made that happen?” Sherlock snapped, his tone arrogant and bitter. A couple of colleagues started mumbling with each other. John looked at him in disbelief. This was a low blow, even for him.
But then again, Sherlock could have shown some interest and asked John about it.
John waited for Sherlock to walk towards him and sit in his chair. He didn’t. He lowered himself to the couch to sit next to John with difficulty.
When I open the door, John is standing in the hallway. He looks stunning in his dark-green velvet suit, but what really takes my breath away is the look on his face. The open, warm, affectionate look that makes my heart stutter, and I instantly know he doesn’t think I’m ugly.
Lestrade held up the two photos Sherlock had stolen from the crime scenes and Sherlock knew he was in trouble.
There was another thing that hadn’t changed. The moment Sherlock exited the taxi, the game was on. He rushed out of the cab, let John pay for the ride and entered the building with his Belstaff coat flapping behind him. He followed Lestrade through the building, his head held up high and eyes full of focus. John had to hurry to keep up with the detective. It felt like old times, like before. The only thing visibly different was the cast around Sherlock’s, but John knew better.
John suddenly started laughing, and Sherlock joined him after a second. “Do you do this with the kids as well?” John asked when the laughing calmed down a bit.
YAY! :D <3
An engagement ring.
John realised that he had to approach this situation extremely calmly and carefully. He had had panic attacks himself when he had just returned from Afghanistan, but never as bad as this. This was a whole new level of panic.
There was a long pause. John didn’t want to look up, but when he did, he looked right into Sherlock’s eyes. Another rush of warmth ran through his body, and he was sure he saw Sherlock’s eyes darken a little. John licked his bottom lip; he couldn’t help it.
He does, his eyes falling on the silver tie pin I wore yesterday.
“What makes you think I want to go?”
John looked up and froze. There, in the middle of his office, stood Mycroft Holmes.
Maggie nodded. “That’s understandable. Just take another deep breath and know that we can stop at any time.”
“No, it’s fine,” Sherlock said with a small smile while he opened the door.
“interested in Sherlock? Why? I’m guessing you’re not friends,” John challenged.
Maggie’s words were the encouragement that Sherlock needed to start this. “I started in Ukraine,” he began hesitantly. “I went undercover in a Russian organisation which was settled all over Eastern Europe. They were specialised in hacking and were preparing a big attack on some big European countries. If they would pull through, it would mean the end of Europe as we know it.”
Sherlock gestured at John’s face. “That,” he replied impatiently.
“He’s hurt. The injuries he has suggested he was tortured back there. Multiple breaks, a heavy concussion, contusions, internal bleeding probably. They found gamma-hydroxybutyrate in his blood.”
Thanks again for all your kudos and comments. They mean the world to me! So pretty please, leave your thoughts behind :)
“Someone’s coming.”
At first, John was concerned. He knew the cab ride wasn’t the moment to ask what was going on, so he didn’t speak as well during the trip home. But when they got back at the apartment, Sherlock walked straight to his bedroom and closed the door with a loud bang, leaving John standing in the middle of the room, startled.
The man’s face fell again. “I worry about him. Constantly,” he answered deliberately, and John couldn’t miss the threatening tone in his voice.
“Molly told me I could probably find you here.”
“What do you mean?”
For a second, John thought Sherlock was going to argue with him, but he only gave a small nod as an answer.
When John entered the room an hour later, Sherlock laid on his bed, looking at the ceiling. John didn’t know what to expect. It had gone rather well. Mrs Hudson had been sweet and reassuring, and Lestrade was able to pique Sherlock’s interest with some cases he told him about. But now that they were gone, Sherlock became silent.
John didn’t reply and shrugged. Of course, he cared about Sherlock, that was no secret. He’d always care for the man, friends or not. But why did Greg’s statement made him feel uncomfortable then? And why was he so affected by all of this, more then he wanted? Why did it feel like he was about to lose someone he… loved?
“Sherlock!” John yelled after him. But Sherlock kept walking and tried to ignore John. He knew it wasn’t fair. John would not be able to keep up with him, but he didn’t care. He wanted to get away from him as soon as possible.
“My deodorant?”
It took John a moment to realise what the man had said. He looked at Mike to see if he had heard it right, but Mike just grinned at him, his eyebrows raised. “Sorry?”
“Are you alright?” Lestrade asked puzzled.
When John entered the surgery that morning, he was greeted warmly by his assistant.
John started laughing. “You git.”
"You're not fine, dear brother."
Sherlock didn’t respond. John took a breath and reached out to take Sherlock’s hands in his. He felt Sherlock tense, but he didn’t let go.
John didn’t mean to yell, but he could no longer manage his anger. He saw Sherlock flinch a little and knew he had gone too far. He wanted to take back what he said immediately, but two bright grey-blue eyes looked up at him, and John suddenly lost the ability to speak. He saw something he didn’t see before. This wasn’t the competent, almost arrogant man John knew. This was a man who was incredibly insecure and did his very best to hide it. Could it be that Molly was right after all?
Once again, John’s phone interrupted the conversation at the right moment. John reached for his phone for the second time, this time with no hesitation.
When John came back, he was in an even more foul mood than before. His conversation  didn’t exactly go as he hoped, and it had started to pour just when he got out of the tube. He did his best to get inside as quietly as he could.
Sherlock closed his eyes tightly at the sudden tenderness with John was speaking. “I can’t tell you that,” he confessed eventually.
“Great! Thanks, John. Next round is on me!”
Lestrade closed the door behind him and sat down at his desk. Before John would take place opposite him, and Sherlock would stand so he could pace around like he always did. This time, Sherlock walked over to the chair and sat down, trying to hide the painful grimace that threatened to show on his face. John immediately walked closer and stood behind him, protectively.
“I’ve had enough,” John hissed through clenched teeth as he tried to keep his anger under control. “You are acting like an annoying five-year-old, and I’m sick of it! You can’t continue like this. Ignore me all you want, but I will not stand here and watch how you are neglecting your body. I know you don’t want to admit it, but you are drained from last night. Hell, I’m exhausted, let alone you. You are going to sleep, and after that, you are going to eat a proper meal.”
There was something in the way she asked the question that made John want to defend himself, and Sherlock, instantly. “I think he’s doing the best he can at the moment. His pain is manageable; he’s mobile enough to take on a case. He’s sometimes struggling, but that’s expected.”
I can only conclude it’s because of the words that are too fragile to say right now.
Mycroft was waiting for him outside the room. He looked like shit. He was pale, and his eyes were small with deep, dark circles underneath them. The visible stubble on his chin and cheeks indicated he hadn't shaved in days.  His hair was tangled, and his clothes were wrinkled. In other circumstances, John would remark it, but he probably looked just as bad.
John nodded and felt a little irritated. It was the third time in a row Anderson had allowed students to skip his P.E. classes. Usually, it wouldn’t be that big of a deal, but with the school reports coming up he had to grade everyone.
I sit in my office and lean back in my chair, my feet on the desk, and my eyes screwed shut. The aspirin I took an hour ago doesn’t seem to help with my headache, but at least my nausea had subsided. Nasty things, hangovers. But then again, I know damn well that you never go home after a beer or two when you go drinking with John Watson. Especially when he got things to tell you.
“No. It’s nothing.”
“And what’s that?”
Sherlock let out a long sigh when his brother was gone and relaxed a little. He pressed his eyes shut and sank a little deeper into the mattress.
Sherlock’s eyes fluttered open. John’s heart sank when he saw the pained, almost desperate look in his eyes.
I put on a simple pullover and black jeans, not feeling like wearing my usual fashion today. Those shirts and suits usually are my armour, but today, I feel unarmed.
Mycroft grabbed the doorknob, and again, John saw Mycroft’s brief hesitation. He braced himself and entered the room.
I can hear John walking down the stairs, but I’m so preoccupied with samples of cat saliva under my microscope that I don’t look up immediately. But when I do, I almost let my pipette drop. I manage to grab the edge of the table just in time to make sure my knees won’t buckle, but I can’t prevent myself from sucking in a breath. John is facing the mirror, adjusting his tie. But more important, he’s wearing a dark-green, velvet suit.
Sherlock didn’t respond and avoided John’s gaze. He was fighting the urge to look up into the doctor’s ocean blue eyes because he knew if he did, his anger would subside. Instead, he decided on fixing his gaze on the woman behind John.
Sherlock answered right away. "It's an apartment on the first floor, 17 steps to be precise. The bedroom is on the same level as everything else, and there are a bath and a shower."
How did we end up here?
Mycroft identified himself at the reception with a card, and the receptionist nodded approvingly. He then took another card from his pocket and handed it to John. "identification. This gives you access to the entire building, including all wards and treatment rooms."
John’s mind was preoccupied during the rest of the meeting. He couldn’t stop wondering what had happened last year and noticed he found himself conflicted. He actually started to like working with Sherlock. Who was he kidding, he began to like Sherlock himself too. But he was sure he’d only seen the tip of the iceberg and that working with Sherlock would become a challenge.
“Or,” John started, and Sherlock looked up from his thoughts. “We could grab something to eat? Get to know each other a bit more?”
“Piss off, Mycroft."
Even though his first instinct was to approach Sherlock and to touch him, John knew better. No sudden movements. “Sherlock?” he started, surprised to hear that his voice sounded completely steady. “I’m here. I know you can hear me. I am going to help you.”
“And what about the fact that you had to shock him? Twice? I don’t think that that’s part of the normal procedure, is it?” Mycroft snarled.
“Maybe.”
It took John a moment to recollect himself, but Sherlock had already put on his game face and sprung into action. “Three, so far,” he answered and started to walk across the room. “The kidnapper is a man, or are multiple men, that much is obvious by the size of his clothing. A woman could not be able to overtake him. There isn’t any sign of struggle or resistance, so I believe he wasn’t taken from here.”
John sat in his chair and stared outside. The little drops of rain where gliding down the windows. The sky was grey with large, dark clouds hanging above the sea. The sea itself was stormy, with rough waves hitting the coastline of Fairlight Cove. Just like it had been for the last couple days or even weeks.  On days like this, John could really appreciate the village.
“He wasn’t,” Sherlock answered impatiently. “But someone has been here after the kidnapping,” Brandon clearly wasn’t a smoker, but there is fresh tobacco ash near the window in the bedroom. Marlboro, by the smell of it.”
tun tun tun tun....
“About… this. About us going on a date.”
“You are here for the job in year 4?” John heard the surprise in her voice.
“I know it probably can’t beat Hills and it’s not the fancy place you had in mind, but… I don’t know; I thought you liked it and…” Sherlock mumbled. He looked down to his shoes, suddenly feeling incredibly insecure. “Never mind, it’s a stupid idea.”
“Oh, but I think you will,” Lestrade insisted and walked closer to Sherlock. “You have to. You’ve already wasted your privilege to continue this case, but I’m sure you want to avoid putting yourself, and John, in a lot of trouble.”
“You know Mycroft is paying, right?” John grinned.
John immediately regretted the loss of Sherlock’s warm hands but fought the urge to reach out and grab them again. He cleared his throat instead. “I should go.”
“He had those when we were young,” Mycroft continued. “Got stuck in them for hours.” He shifted on his feet, uncomfortably.
“Part-time? Who would want me as a partner?”
Sherlock’s face grew more serious. He backed away from the wall and straightened his jacket. “When I was young, my brother thought me that caring is not an advantage, and I lived by that motto since.”
"Why?"
“Yes, Sherlock, we did. Nothing came up.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I know,” Lestrade said and ran his hands across his face. He couldn’t keep the slight tremble out of his voice. “The fire brigade should arrive in a minute. Sarah
“You are getting there,” John finally said, gave him a small, crooked smile.
"Excuse me?"
Happy Valentine's Day, sweeties! <3
“Thank you,” Sherlock spoke after a moment. John didn’t answer. He looked at Sherlock and saw him struggle. He gave him a moment to find the right words. There was another long silence.
The next couple of days went by in a haze. Because the P.E. lessons were canceled for this week, John was able to work at home Tuesday and Wednesday, which he used to prepare his P.E. classes and his upcoming lessons. He still had a lot of reading to do in order to catch up with the new teaching methods, not to mention Sherlock’s own methods and ways to teach the children.
John couldn’t help but notice that all the questions focused on the aftercare of the splenectomy and the bronchoscopy. He wondered if she was deliberately avoiding questions about how Sherlock was coping with the withdrawal. And if so, why?
John sat in the middle of his living room and blinked. How did this go south so fast? One moment, they were chatting, maybe flirting even, and now Sherlock clearly was upset about something. He stood up, ignored the pain in his ankle and grabbed his keys. “Harry, I’m out!” he yelled and rushed out of his house after Sherlock, who was already halfway down the street.
Sherlock walked towards the table and greeted Molly and Mike politely. They both looked surprised but happy at the unexpected sight of their colleague standing in a bar on a Friday evening.
Sherlock frowned and shook his head, still not knowing what John was talking about. “I don’t know to who you are ref-,” he stopped mid-sentence, realization hitting him. Harry. Harriet Watson. John’s sister. How could he possibly forget?
John guides me through the crowd, into the hallway and through the front door of the building. He clearly knows where he wants to go, like a soldier on a mission.
“We’ve only just met, and we’re going to prepare the upcoming year tomorrow?”
John opened his mouth to comment on that, but luckily he realized in time that he was out of his league here. He knew that if he pushed, she would have Sherlock admitted in a heartbeat. And suddenly, he realized that maybe she was right to do so. That didn’t mean he had to like it, though.
“I couldn’t.”
The faint light of the fire they had made that evening lit the room, but besides that, it was completely dark. John expected Sherlock to sit in the middle of the piles with files, but he was surprised to find Sherlock laying on the sofa, his back towards the room. He walked a bit closer to see if Sherlock was awake, maybe somewhere deep inside his mind palace. But when John bent over him to see his face, he was even more surprised. Sherlock seemed to be asleep, quite soundly actually. A wave of relief ran through John’s body, and his anger subsided. He was glad to see Sherlock wasn’t fighting against it, at least not tonight.
“Look, our beloved colleagues were told a different story, as well as parents. They don’t know anything about my history with drugs, or why things happened last year. At school, only Lestrade knows, and I intend to keep it that way. One of the last things parents seem to want for their child is to be thought by an addict.” His voice was back to his previous, distant tone so sudden that John was taken aback by it.
John didn’t answer the man. They stood outside of Sherlock’s room and were waiting. John didn’t know it would be a good idea. But it had to be. He had made sure Sherlock was feeling okay, that he wasn’t feeling too unstable of worn out from his EMDR treatment earlier this afternoon. Sherlock had waved away every form of concern and had given John an honest answer about how he felt about the procedure. This had reassured John to go through with this.
“Did you take it?”
I'm really to like writing this fic! Didn't know i would have so much fun. And the best part is hearing from you guys in the comments, It makes me so happy! So please, let me hear some more! :)
John looked at his message and started doubting his words. Maybe it was too casual. He quickly decided to send another message.
“Honestly, I don’t know. I haven’t been to the apartment yet. I didn’t know it was still my apartment until a couple of days ago.” Mycroft couldn’t help but notice the small flicker of sarcasm.
“Made me pull the trigger,” he finally whispered. “I couldn’t see him, but I knew it had to be him.”
A shiver ran across his back when John looked in Sherlock’s eyes, steel-blue meeting stormy blue directly for the first time in two years. For a moment, John couldn’t fight his instincts. Trying to ignore the stammering of his heart against his chest, John lowered their arms but didn’t let go of their hands. He shifted a little bit closer, allowing Sherlock to do the same. The taller man let out a shaky breath and let his gaze lower on John’s lips. They inched even closer, their noses almost touching.
a person who is admired for their courage, outstanding achievements, or noble qualities.
“Everybody, listen up!” John yelled as loud as he could, desperately trying to remember what to do in a situation like this. “There is no need to panic! Find your fire buddy and form a line at the door, please. It’s probably just a drill, nothing to worry about!”
But as John walked across the schoolyard, something else crept up too. He started to feel a little anxious. Not because of the job itself, he knew he was a good teacher, but because of his new partner. When he met Sherlock yesterday, he couldn’t help but be impressed by the young man. But when he met some other new colleagues and told them that he was the new teacher of year 4, they all gave him a look, and no one said anything about his new partner. This made John wonder.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at Lestrade. “The one who sent the threats is following true.”
This felt a little different, though. He had had a couple of sexual encounters with men in the past, but his actual dating history consisted only of women.  Sherlock was the first man who he would be dating, which made this uncharted territory. But, John decided, if there would be anyone who would act normal about it, it would be his sister.
From their first brush of lips, Sherlock was
“If you want me to come back then…” John started, but Sherlock him off.
A couple of hours later, John arrived at Bartholomew’s State School. He had read up on the school a little bit. It wasn’t a big primary school, and it wasn’t one of the top state schools in London. They weren’t specialised in a specific kind of education and didn’t provide much extra curriculum activities. They didn’t stand out against other schools. Just an ordinary state school, nothing more, nothing less. If John weren’t in desperate need of a job, he wouldn’t even consider applying here. But then again, he was desperate.
"What do you mean?" John asked immediately, no longer able to hide the anxiety in his voice.
Principal Lestrade stood up from his chair and held out his hand again, waiting for John to follow and shook his hand. “Now, Let’s find Mike.”
“Pictures, obviously. Don’t be so obtuse, Lestrade.”
For a long moment, the man didn’t do anything. He seemed to contemplate what to do next. Then, he looked over John’s shoulder, nodded and gestured something. When John heard the engine of the car start again, he felt a little relieved. He greeted the man with a small nod, turned around and walked back towards the car. He could be wrong, but it certainly felt like he got the benefit of the doubt and that the man had given his permission to continue his interactions with Sherlock.
“That sounds delicious,” the young woman opposite me – Joyce, as I recall, says sweetly and gives me a charming smile. We met between the shelves of pasta minutes ago where she searched for ready-made carbonara sauce, and I couldn’t resist telling her it would taste much better if she just made it herself.
“All right, everything seems to go as well as expected. If you don’t have any questions, you’re free to go. Try to take it easy for a couple more weeks, okay?” Dr. Wilson spoke gently before she turned her gaze towards John. “Dr. Watson, I want to have a quick word before you go, please.”
"I approve," John said in a calm, deliberate tone. "I trust that doctor Wilson knows what's best. But I want to make sure she attempts to save as much of the spleen as possible. Tell her it will not be removed without my permission, understood?"
“I know,” Sherlock whispered, his breath tickling John’s skin.
“Yeah, he’s always like that. Does it with the kids, too.”
The class quickly followed Sherlock and John out of the classroom, walked through the corridors, and up the step to the first floor, where the music room was situated. John was surprised to see it was a large room with college benches and a stage in the front of the classroom. Keyboards, drums, guitars, and other instruments were spread around the room.
“It’s fine; I know you’re looking for Sherlock. He’s outside, talking to Greg.”
“John, is everything okay?” Lestrade asked when she was out of earshot.
“I think that’s for a doctor to decide, hmm?” He walks over and settles himself next to me on the couch. I try to ignore the warmth from his hip against mine. “Come on, roll up your sleeve.”
“I didn’t mean it like that… It’s perfectly okay to go by yourself.”
John stopped for a moment and realised he was practically yelling. He tried to regain his composure. “Do you?” he asked after a long silence.
And yet, miraculously, they had survived.
Sherlock felt his cheeks warm and nodded. He started to realize John was actually serious about this date.
John looked at his watch. 03:18 a.m. It had been more than two hours since they had seen the resident. Maybe he just was too afraid to show his face again, but John could not shake the nagging feeling he had started to feel. He tried to remain calm and steady, but deep down, he was frightened. He knew something was off; the surgery was taking too long. "Something's wrong," he stated.
“Let me have a look,” John offered.
Thank you so much for reading! I've been walking around with it in my head for a long time now, so to know that you guys are liking it means a lot to me!
When John came back from the kitchen with two cups of tea, Sherlock made up his mind. He really didn’t want to be here. “I should go,” he said and raised himself hastily from the chair.
He heard Lestrade let out a relieved sigh. “Thanks, Sherlock. And drop by at John’s afterwards, yeah?”
Sherlock’s head snapped up in the direction of John. It was soft, but he did hear him. It was too much for him to understand and Sherlock knew it. His body tensed, and he tried to control his breathing, but a rush panic ran through his veins. This was going all wrong. He wanted to let John come closer, not to push him away.
This time, Sherlock’s head snapped up, and his eyes narrowed. “I know it’s fine.”
The physical therapist stood up and pushed his chair away. "I'd like to examine you first, okay? See what kind of strength you have left. Sit up straight for me, please."
“I don’t need to,” Anderson replied without looking up from the screen. “I know who’s in my class. And I’m sure you counted before you handed them to me.”
Mycroft started to approach Sherlock’s bed. “I did hear you. How are you feeling?”
“Oh, Sherlock…”
“Under some conditions, yes.”
"Nauseous."
Sherlock’s mouth fell open. “Harry’s your sister,” he exclaimed.
After an hour, Sherlock started to feel desperate. He really, really wanted to sleep. He turned, switched sides and turned again, but it only made him feel more anxious.
“Bisexual. Yes, of course,” Harry said quickly. “But I’ve always figured your interest in men was more sexual than romantic. I thought you were shagging both, but that you would end up with a woman eventually. I never heard you say you were interested in dating men as well.”
John’s eyes grew big in disbelief. “What?”
Then, Sherlock placed a hand on John’s back as a response and John had to fight back the tears that threatened to spill.
John felt the corners of his mouth creep up and wasn’t able to stop his smile. He quickly answered back.
There was nothing left of the peaceful morning they had shared once they got back from the hospital that afternoon. The first couple of appointments had gone well. Dr Wilson seemed to be happy with Sherlock’s recovery, they had made an appointment to remove the cast from his arm, and Patrick also seemed pleased with the progress Sherlock was making. His last meeting of that day was another session with Maggie. John was surprised to notice that Sherlock was in quite a good mood when he entered her office. But from the moment Sherlock walked out of the hospital, he had gone silent.
John gave him a small smile. “Just checking.” He looked down for a moment, trying to find the right words to announce the two visitors. “Do you trust me?”
“No need to snap, brother mine;  just a social visit. Plus, mummy asked me to bring you these. She knows you love them.” I put the tin can on the coffee table for Sherlock to take. He simply huffs in response, but I can see the cookies have his interest. I wonder how long it will take before the temptation beats his stubbornness.
The third method is a rather unknown method, mainly used in America. It would require bringing Mr Holmes in a medically induced coma for about two weeks. That way, his body can recover and get through the detox without experiencing withdrawal symptoms.”
Everyone looked at how the firetrucks stopped in front of the school and how the firefighters exited the vehicle. One of them walked straight over to Lestrade, Sherlock and Sarah. He started talking to Lestrade and Sarah immediately, trying to get an update on the situation as fast as possible.
He followed Sherlock and hoped for the best.
John raised his eyebrows and looked at the detective for a moment. “But it could be?”
Sherlock looked at him for a moment, his face unreadable. “Yes, please,” he answered, his voice much softer than John had anticipated. He decided not to dwell on it and walked out of the bedroom.
Half an hour later, Sherlock sat on the sofa and was staring outside the window, his cup of coffee forgotten between his hands. He listened to the of the newspaper John was reading and sighed.
“Oh, of course, go blab to bloody Mycroft. You two are becoming two peas in a pot,” Sherlock spit venomously
John heard the slight disappointment in Sherlock’s voice. He walked to his briefcase and took out a lunch bag. He walked back and sat down on the floor again. When Sherlock looked at him, he shrugged. “I’m good. Meant to ask you something anyway,” he said and took a bite of one of his sandwiches.
"Doctor Watson," it sounded on the other end of the line. John immediately knew it was the hospital. “I'm sorry to call you in the middle of the night, but we don’t know what to do with Mr Holmes. He has been very nervous for a few hours and doesn't talk anymore. When we get close to him, he only seems to become more anxious. We cannot administer medication or help him this way. "
“Yeah mate, come with us!” Mike added. “It’s the perfect moment to get to know one of your new colleagues outside these four walls. Besides, I feel like we haven’t had a decent chat in ages.”
The three men sat in silence for minutes. John realised this was a good sign. Sherlock had admitted that the session was too much. Not only Sherlock noticed it himself, but he actually said it out loud. That meant the issue he had been working on during the session wasn't much of a big deal anymore, which was good.
The nurse walked away with her tail between the legs. Mycroft turned to the window to see what was going on. John watched how his face fell, and all colour slowly pulled out of his face. "Are you alright?" He asked, but Mycroft didn't answer.
From the moment they entered Lestrade’s department, John tried to push his unsettling feeling aside and decided to focus on the case. But it took only a couple of seconds before the officers noticed who walked in. John felt how everyone turned their heads and how every eye was on him and Sherlock. The conversations fell quiet and made way for some soft whispering. John narrowed his eyes and looked around. He had forgotten the lack of decency of most of the Yarders. The man was going to help the Yard to find their criminal, probably catch him single-handedly, and they were just staring at Sherlock like some kind of surreal thing.
Maggie chuckled a bit. “You know him well.”
He locked himself up in his bathroom in a desperate attempt to leave everything behind.
Oh, also! Thanks for the Facebook tip! Although it's probably a little quieter than in the early days, I love it!.
From the first look, there wasn’t much to see. Sherlock started to look for clues, for any trace he could use.
“You would tell me if you got the hots for your new colleague, right Johnny?” Mike teased.
Sherlock stepped back from John and straightened his coat in a desperate attempt to compose himself. “That’s acceptable,” he said. He gave John a small kiss before he turned and walked away from him with a broad grin on his face.
Sherlock waved his hand dismissively. “I’m good. But if you want to take a break and get to know the vultures, by all means.”
John blinked up at him and felt almost felt sorry for Sherlock. The man who he got to know the past week was nowhere to be found. Instead, there was an insecure, almost scared man struggling in front of him, and John felt a dull ache inside his chest. How could this be so hard for him? What had happened?
Lestrade eyed John for a moment before he seemed convinced. “Okay, that explains a lot. And how is he holding up?”
“What was he like at university?” John asked and regretted the question almost immediately. From the corner of his eye, he saw Mike grinning at him, but he decided to ignore it.
“How can you tell?”
He tried to remember the names and was making a list inside his head. There were Sarah and Janine who were responsible for the reception year, Ella did year one by herself, Mary and Irene did year two together, a young teacher named Molly did year three. Year four was his class, another guy named Philip thought year five and John knew Mike already, who thought year 6. It wasn’t a huge staff, but then again, it wasn’t a large school either.
John didn’t reply immediately. He just stared at Sherlock and blinked. “You don’t remember?” he asked eventually.
John's heart shattered into a million pieces. He wanted to scream, to throw things, to punch someone. He wanted to say that Sherlock didn't need to apologise for anything, but he didn't trust his voice. All he could do was give Sherlock's knee a small squeeze.
“I think you should leave,” Sherlock spoke after a while, his voice almost a whisper.
“Always, Sally.” Sherlock looked at her for a moment and sniffed the air. “I even know you didn’t make it home last night.”
“No, it’s fine. Sleep, you need it.”
The chapters keep getting longer and longer, but there's just so much stuff to write about! The struggle is getting real with these two... I really hope you guys like this chapter! I worked my butt off to get this one up, haha.
“We did.”
John just stood there, frozen in his place. A look of surprise covered his face. “Amazing.”
“Stop it. I’m not gay,” John replied a little too quickly.
“I didn’t,” John answered coldly and saw Sherlock flinch at the words. “But I’m willing to try one more time. I think you owe me an explanation. But I’m warning you, Sherlock; I think I’m still able to tell whether or not you tell me the truth. If you don’t, I’ll walk out of here, and that’s it.”
After a long moment, Sherlock started to speak. "I don't have an issue with you, John," he managed to say. His voice sounded a little more steady now. "I know I can trust you."
It took John seconds to realise what the therapist had said. “And you’ll allow me in?” he asked in disbelief.
Sherlock looked down at his plate again for a long time, trying to come up with a proper response. “Thank you,” he mumbled and gave John a small, shy smile.
“Good, that’s good. Now, all we can do is wait. Thanks for the help, John.” He clapped John on the shoulder.
“I’m fine Greg, nothing to worry about.”
John decided it was time and entered Sherlock’s room. This was all according to a plan which he and Mycroft had discussed earlier.
This time it was John’s turn to glare at the man. He really knew how to work on people’s nerves, didn’t he?
John nodded. “I think so, yeah,” he answered.
“So is Sally over there.”
(See the end of the chapter for
And after that came the image of horrid realization on John’s face when he saw the little red dot of the second sniper appear on Sherlock's forehead. That was the moment for Sherlock where he had realized that was it. It was game over. He wouldn’t be able to save himself, to save his friend. He had failed to protect him.
“I can’t believe it. It’s the freak.”
Mike chuckled a little in answer, and John looked up, curious. “What?”
Sherlock nodded, pressed his eyes shut again and let out a groan of pain. John’s chest clenched painfully by the sound. With every bit of strength he had, he tried to continue.
And then, he thought of a conversation he and Sherlock had two years ago. It was a brief one, just a casual talk between two friends. But Sherlock had taken it seriously, very seriously even.
John glared at Mike and wanted to respond, but Molly was ahead of him.
“Nope.” I open the door, place my other hand on his back and guide him inside. “It was absolutely brilliant.”
John didn’t register what happened next, and frankly, he didn’t care. Alice was safe, and that was what mattered.
Sherlock raised one eyebrow and looked at him questionably. John stood up and reached out his hand towards the tall man. “Come on, let’s get to bed. You must be tired. At least I am.”
“Because London isn’t that big,” Sherlock sighed, visibly getting tired of this conversation.
“Oh John, before I forget,” Mrs Hudson called after him. “Just a quick reminder that you have to send me the schedule the parent-teacher conferences of year four. I need them by the end of the day. Sherlock said you were in charge of those?”
“I’m not going to blab; I need to talk to him about what happened last night.”
“Yes, John, yes, I am.”
“No, it really couldn’t.”
“Sure. Why not,” I answer equally casual. I get up and walk to the kitchen before he can see the smile on my face.
“Jesus, John! What a surprise! What are you doing here?”
He ran inside anyway.
There was no immediate answer. John really did not want to look up, but when he did, he saw the small nod Mycroft gave him.
“How did you manage to escape?” Maggie asked with a trembling voice. It was hard to hear for her as well. Sherlock noticed it took her a lot of effort to speak. He knew she was trying to steer the conversation a bit.
Hours passed, and although John didn’t want to admit it, he was starting to get frustrated. Sherlock hadn’t spoken since this morning, had decided he could go another day without food and ignored John completely. At first, John had tried to make clear that it wasn’t Sherlock’s fault, but it was no use. Sherlock had decided he wouldn’t forgive himself for the upcoming time and had thrown himself on the case.
Maggie looked at John for a moment as If she was trying to remember her own conditions. “You’ll just sit in the back of the room,” she started. “No questions, no response, no comments. You’re only allowed to listen. If it’s getting too much for you to hear, get out.”
Bastard.
Molly gave John a small smile. “I didn’t have to. John listen, I think I know what’s going on here. I think Sherlock is scared of letting you in. So he tries to push you away to compromise.”
“I need a drink,” John answered flatly.
At last, principal Lestrade looked up from John’s resume. “I would love to have you on board, John. If you want, I can offer you a two-day job in our new year 4 class and one and a half-day teaching physical education to our 4
John just nodded in answer. He followed Mycroft through the corridors of the building. They took the elevator to the third floor where there were various temporary offices and meeting rooms. Mycroft opened one of the doors with his card and entered one of the offices. In the middle of the room was a large desk with several files on it. Mycroft sat down carefully behind the counter and John sat opposite him. He said nothing and waited for Mycroft to start the conversation.
He knew the answer to that almost instantly. Yes. Definitely, yes.
Around one, John suddenly woke up from a restless slumber. His first instinct was to reach for Sherlock, but his hand didn’t find the comforting warmth he was searching for. He opened his eyes, pushed himself up and stared at the empty pillow next to him. John ran his hands across his face. He knew Sherlock was probably still downstairs going through the files, or that he was in his mind palace reminiscing about the case. He also knew he had to try to get him to sleep, and that wasn’t an argument he wanted to have in the middle of the night.
The next morning, Sherlock sat at the kitchen table reading the newspaper when he heard John coming down the stairs. “Good morning, John,” he greeted, not looking up from the article he was reading.
John felt his nerves settle a bit. He knew she was right; it would play out eventually. Besides, what was the worst that could happen? “Thanks, Harry. That means a lot to me,” he answered and put off the lights.
The students started to whisper instantly. For a second Sherlock looked shocked, but he recovered quickly. He straightened his jacket and wanted to say something, but one of their students cut him off.
“Of course he can’t,” John sighed. “did he say why?”
“Molly, you went to Roehampton, right?” John asked politely.
“Ta, Mrs Hudson. I’m sure he’s just happy Autumn break is coming up.”
Mike shook John's hand in return. “Yeah I know, I got fat. I heard you were abroad somewhere, teaching in a war zone and got shot? What happened? "
“Who? John? He’s fine mate, didn’t he tell you?”
He guided Sherlock to the window and opened it. Sherlock immediately leaned into the fresh air, took a deep sigh and tried to slow down his thoughts. For a moment, they just stood there, letting the cold air fill their lungs and clean their heads.
“I’m afraid to sleep alone."
Time flew by. In no time they had made an overview which they could use as a basis and had agreed on a class layout to try in the first period. John had proposed a system that he knew from his education where students and teachers could indicate how things went at school that day, something that had impressed Sherlock.
John didn’t say anything in response, but Sherlock could see him smile. Suddenly Sherlock felt more comfortable than he had been the whole night. Something about John made him feel safe, which was unique. He looked at John and was greeted by kind, dark blue eyes and Sherlock felt his heart skip a beat. He was completely mesmerised by the man in front of him. How could he feel so secure when he was in John’s presence, even though they only knew each other for a couple of weeks now?
When they were done, Sherlock pushed himself off the wall and turned to face John. “John, for what it’s worth, I did have a really good time.”
Sherlock sat on one of the bottom steps and was tapping nervously on his knee with his left hand. In his right, he had his phone, which he used to check the time every other minute. In the forty-one minutes, he sat there; his mind had made up every scenario, every reason and every excuse for why John was running shamefully late. But he only conclusion Sherlock had reached in the end was that John had made up his mind and didn’t want to go on a date with him after all.
“Ah Molly, coffee. Thank you,” the man said and gave John his phone back. He then looked up at her. “What happened to your lipstick?”
When John didn’t say anything, Sherlock took a breath. Even though he didn’t want to admit it, it wasn’t easy to talk about it. He preferred to keep things to himself, especially stuff about the past. But for some reason, it didn’t seem that hard to tell John about what had happened. He cleared his throat and continued.
“What?”
John had been there from the moment he knew Sherlock was back and had never left his side since. And during that time, Sherlock had noticed a change in John’s behaviour. Earlier, he would keep things at a distance, hold back on the touches and apologise or excuse himself if he felt like he had invaded on Sherlock's personal space. But now, he was more comfortable around Sherlock than he had ever been.
“Where did you find him?” John asked, trying to get some more facts.
“Did you set those conditions, or did he?”
"Listen,” Mycroft started, carefully choosing his words. “I know you threw in the towel. That you rather would’ve been dead than saved. But this is not just about you. I know I don’t have much to ask and that my sentiment will not touch you enough. But there is someone here who has not left your side since he knew you were back. Someone who fought for you to make sure you would survive, to make sure you have a chance to fight this. And I know you don’t have any problems hurting the people around you. But if you now choose not to fight, you take him with you."
John and Mycroft didn't respond. Both knew this wasn't the whole report. They waited anxiously for the resident to continue.
Behind them, the footsteps of sergeant Donovan tapped on the staircase. “You can’t be serious,” she started while climbing the last couple of stairs. “The freak just shows up after a year, and you’re already giving him privileges?”
“Okay, listen up everybody,” John called out to the students. Slowly, everybody turned their heads towards him and became silent. When everybody had their attention on him again, John continued. “I have to compliment you. You guys were really focused on the project and worked together really well. I look forward to hearing your ideas. For now, make sure your tables are empty before you leave the classroom, and don’t forget to put your chair on the table. We will go to the music room when everyone is ready.”
It took John a moment to find Lestrade, who was standing around the corner looking at the fire together with Sarah, who apparently was one of the emergency response officers. She was on the phone with the fire department when John walked towards them.
His expression changes from annoyed to concerned in a flash. “Let me see.”
“I’ll take care of it.”
Greg’s eyes grew big. “No way. That’s not possible. Are you sure it’s not of Mycroft’s schemes? Another one of his twisted…”
John automatically walked back to the couch and sat down, but Sherlock didn’t follow his lead. He stood still in the middle of the room, his gaze directed to the ground. He obviously felt uncomfortable, and John didn’t know what to do. Part of him wanted to grab his hand or hug the man, but he figured that wouldn’t be appropriate.
They were true.
This time, John interrupted Sherlock. “Don’t be. I’m fine; I managed to learn how to deal with it through therapy.”
John just gave him a hint of a smile. “Do you want to get back to your bed?” Sherlock nodded.
“I… uhm… I hadn’t thought of that.”
“I can’t do that, John. I can only rest after I solve the case. The sooner I solve it, the sooner I can let you hover over me. That’s what you want, right?”
But then again, Sherlock had done the same thing two years ago.
“Okay,” was all Sherlock managed to say.
John couldn’t help but question this. “Are you sure? Did you count?”
“It’s fine, John.”
He really had to do his very best not to fall head over heels in love with this man.
He didn't think about him as often as before. And when John thought of him now, he no longer had those unbearable thoughts, but memories of their past. He didn't allow himself to think of those memories for too long, he couldn't bear those yet, but they were there, and that was quite some progress.
Of course, John had seen worse cases in Afganistan; he knew that. But this was about his former best friend, about the man who he lived with for years. And that fact made it a lot harder to read.
John’s night was a constant battle between sleep and being awake. For the first couple of hours, he had laid down in bed, staring at the ceiling and hoping Sherlock would come to bed soon. John had been incredibly wound up because of the text message he got earlier that night. He knew that he would have to face it sooner or later and that he had to text back in the morning, but he could guess what it was about though.
“And how did you two meet?’
Sherlock shrugged. “Fine, I won’t.” He let his gaze fall back to the file, but he couldn’t fight the panic he was starting to feel. Now would be a good time for John to step in. Where was he, anyway?
Mycroft had recommended John to stay outside the room for now. John didn’t know why, but something in Mycroft’s voice told him it would be better indeed. John took place in front of the window, wondering if patients were able to see the person opposite of the window.
“Jesus Sherlock, what  got your knickers in a twist?”
His cheeks were stained with tears; he hadn’t even noticed he had started crying. He never cried. He tried to remember himself to breath and drew out a shaky breath. His hand found his glass of whiskey, but when he wanted to take a sip, it was empty. He must have drunk it while reading but hadn’t noticed that either.
Thank you so much for all the comments and kudos. As you can see, you helped a lot! It means so much to me to know you guys like the story!
As always, your thoughts are being appreciated! Thank you for the comments and kudos. I really enjoy writing this story and i'm really glad you guys also like it. So, thanks!
Sherlock looked up shyly at John through his lashes and was welcomed by two ocean-blue eyes and one of the most genuine, beautiful smiles John could give him.
"Obviously," Mycroft answered slowly.
“After two months, they decided I was ready.” His voice sounded raw now, not entirely his own. “They gave me my own clients. But in those two months, I had formed a plan. Before someone could do something, I was able to deduce my clients’ darkest secrets and used it against them so I wouldn’t have to have sex with them. Everyone has secrets.”
John inhaled deeply and braced himself. “Okay. I’ll start with an easy one. How long beforehand did you plan it?”
“Tea then?”
The waiting room of a hospital always was a strange place to be. Whether it was because somebody was hoping to receive good news, or expecting to get bad news, people were still a little anxious for what was about to come. It didn’t matter if you were waiting with ten people or, in this case, had the waiting room for yourself; there was always this energy around. And even though he was a doctor, John couldn’t shake it.
Sherlock couldn’t find his voice anymore. He gave a small nod as an answer.
Doctor Wilson narrowed her eyes and looked at John for a second. “Doctor Watson, I know you have to deal with a lot right now. But as a colleague, I’d like you to advice to put aside your personal opinion and look at this professional. My advice would be to go for option three.”
“Could we see the menu, Rachel?”
When he’s done venting, Greg takes a large swig, puts the bottle down with a thud and eyes me for a long moment. “So, what’s going on with you and Sherlock?”
“In that case, you should order the most expensive bottle of champagne tonight, just to piss him off,” Sherlock replied and gave a small grin as well.
From the moment they got home, Sherlock threw himself entirely on finding a connection between the four victims of the threats. John tried to help as much as he could, but Sherlock made it clear he was more of a burden than a help and snapped at him every time John thought he had found something. When he suggested Sherlock should take a break and eat something, he got the ‘my-body-is-just-transport’ and ‘food-slows-down-my-brain’ speech he knew all too well, together with some comments on how he shouldn’t hover and how he should just get out of the way.
“Three beers and sparkling water, please.”
“Are you sure? Did you inhale any smoke?” asked Lestrade who came to stand next to Sherlock together with the fire-fighter.
“Good. Come on, let’s go.” And there it was again, another reassuring smile and a comforting hand on his knee. Sherlock felt the warmth of John’s touch radiate through his trousers, even if his hand was already gone. And suddenly, Sherlock knew he couldn’t play this game anymore. It was all or nothing. After today’s session, he would tell John about the way he felt, about the letter, about everything.
“I know.”
“I guess I’ll see you next Monday at the staff meeting, then? We could prepare some more things afterwards?” John asked as they walked across the schoolyard.
Before John could ask what was going on, Sherlock turned away from him. “You should go upstairs. I don’t want to keep you from her. I’ll see you at Bart’s,” Sherlock mumbled and rushed out.
Around 6.30, John took his briefcase, left his apartment, and started walking in no general direction. He bought a sandwich at one of the stands on the corner of the street and was pleased to notice that his mind was a lot more at ease than earlier this morning. He allowed his thoughts to come and go as he walked through the city.
“Tunisia, Beirut, Mexico, Russia and Serbia. That’s where Mycroft found me.”
“And how are you going to measure the results?” Sherlock suddenly spoke, and everyone fell silent instantly. “And how will you motivate your students to proceed with this project through the year? Or include the pupils who aren’t that motivated?” He shifted in his seat and sat up straight. “And how much time will it take to work out this plan? Time we also need to do correction work, to prepare our lessons, to fill in reports. I’m sure it will be at the expense of the quality of our regular curriculum. And that’s the last thing we want since we got the inspection breathing down our necks, isn’t it? Not to mention…”
We’ve been driving around for twenty minutes, unable to find the location where the Valentines’ fundraiser will be. Sherlock insisted he had told the driver the correct address, but I’m starting to get my doubts.
He was fighting an inner battle with his conscience. Sherlock trusted him to make the right decision, but it wasn’t really his decision to make. Sherlock had already decided, and John really didn’t want to go against Sherlock’s wishes. He couldn’t. If Sherlock would survive this, he would not be able to forgive John, and that was something John couldn’t live with. But he absolutely did not want to lose him. Not again, not definitive. It was an impossible choice to make.
Molly gave John a sympathetic smile. “That’s great to hear.”
The second setback came at 00:57 a.m. They were now operating for about three hours, and there hadn't been an update in an hour and a half. Mycroft was starting to get impatient and started pacing the room.
Although John had been preparing himself for this for months, it still felt as if someone hit all the air out of lungs,  if the ground was sinking underneath him. He sucked in a breath.
The second week of John’s new Job went down in a haze. Everything started to settle, and there was a lot more work that had to be done compared to the first week. John was happy to notice his PE lessons went quite well this morning, although it was more of an introduction than actual lessons.
But he was cut off by someone entering the door. A young woman with hazel brown hair tied in a ponytail walked inside with two cups of coffee.
“You know,” John started, his voice sounding a little weaker then he liked. “I’ve planned his funeral at least a dozen times in my head? I even wrote my last words to him.” He sighed. “I hate to admit it, but I think even a little part of me feels relieved.”
“Oh, believe me. I noticed.”
“He has a panic attack,” Mycroft muttered, still looking pale. John looked at Mycroft and tried to read his face. He almost looked scared.
“More then you want to,” Greg continued.
"What if," Patrick started deliberately after minutes. "What if John was the one to help you? Would that be okay?"
Dr. Wilson paused briefly to type some things down on her computer before she continued. “All right, let’s continue with the examination, shall we?”
Sherlock shook his head. "I'm sorry," he stared. "I thought I could do this, but I… I can't. I need another therapist."
Suddenly, the tension between the two men was more tangible than ever, and they both felt it. Sherlock stepped closer and slowly closed the space between them, almost hovering over John. In his turn, John raised his head a bit and licked his lips. He could practically feel Sherlock’s breath against his skin. He lowered his gaze to Sherlock’s lips. “That’s worth a lot,” he managed to say before Sherlock kissed him.
John looked at Sherlock in disbelief. “How could you possibly know about the drinking?”
That was all John needed. He grabbed Sherlock’s hand as tight as he could and let out a quivering sigh of relief. “it’s okay, we’ve got you. I’ve got you,” he whispered.
John waved it away. “We’ll figure it out. Besides, let’s not get ahead of things. We need to go on this date first, see how it goes from there.”
Sherlock looked down at the ground. “I didn’t want to do that,” he mumbled. He started to shift on his feet uncomfortably.
John ran his other hand, trough Sherlock's dark, thick curls. A simple, loving gesture. It was full of meaning and emotion, but John was too tired to wrap his mind around it. The fatigue hit in, making it hard to keep his eyes open. His head felt heavy. Slowly, he sank and rested his head next to Sherlock's, still holding his hand. He quickly fell asleep, and for a couple of hours, everything seemed under control.
After nine months, John could not bear the pain and the emptiness anymore and decided to leave London on the recommendation of his psychologist. A month later he gave up his rent and moved to Fairlight Cove, with nothing more than a suitcase full of his belongings and an old violin case.
The sound of sirens filled the air. It was a welcome sound, the sound of relief, of help. In a moment, there would be professionals who were taking care of the situation. They would search for a way to put the fire out, and above all, they would get someone inside as fast as possible.
