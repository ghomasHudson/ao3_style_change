“But but but, I’ve just solved a case!”
“Wrong” Greg asked alarmed.
Greg nodded. “Good, go home and get warmed up. I’ll call you both into the station for your statements tomorrow.” He turned and walked back towards the crime scene, and the squad car that held their suspect.
Rosie decided that Mycroft didn’t mean it and continued her rampage.
Rosie looked down into her lap, contemplating her uncle’s words. “Daddy says Papa has a sister, but that I’m not allowed to see her. Daddy has a sister too, but we see her sometimes. Why can’t I see Papa’s sister,” she questions, “she’s your sister too! That means we can go and see her while Daddy and Papa are on holiday!” She was excited now, a full on grin graced her face, and she was positively bouncing in her seat.
When getting mushy about your relationship with your cousins, the quote often goes something along the lines of ‘cousins are your first friends.’ In most cases that’s correct however, at this exact moment fourteen year old Rosamund Mary Watson-Holmes was decidedly not friends with her five year old cousins Gina and Max. No, definitely not.
“You sure do have a lot of off colours in your neighbourhood. Is it because of the sandwich shop? Ours only has the Ghanbari’s next door and the Attar’s at the corner.” She spoke nonchalantly but Rosie was flabbergasted, Stasha couldn’t mean what she thinks she meant, could she?
This was how Mycroft found her five minutes later. Being a proper adult, he settled the twins, calmed his niece, and righted the playroom. Later that evening he spoke to his husband, brother and brother-in-law, and commended Rosie on not burning the house down or murdering anyone. After seeing photos of the carnage of the playroom they all agreed it was an amenable first attempt at babysitting.
Mycroft has yet to remove his hands from his eyes and is beginning to see random spot in his inky black vision. “Wouldn’t our departure interfere with your shift, Inspector?” Mycroft is sneering but his state takes some of the bite out of his words.
John raised an eyebrow. “Nope,” he reached for Rosie “It’s nap time.”
Greg and Mycroft share a drink.
Greg and Mycroft sat across from a very nervous looking Molly Hooper, at a corner table of her local pub. It was just past 7 p.m. and the place was packed with football fans and regular visitors of the establishment. In other words it was loud, an no one was giving their little table any mind.
Regina Scarlet Ashe Lestrade-Holmes had never seen her cousin Rosie cry like this before. I mean she'd seen her in some pretty bad states, like the time she and her brother were 5 and Rosie watched them for the first time. There was also the turkey incident, but nobody brought that up. This however, was a different beast entirely. The always sunny, steadfast, intrepid cousin she knew was not currently present.
Mycroft visits Greg at work.
“It was sloppy, Mrs. Tarly at m old school, had done a better one, and it was blue and purple.” Stasha had sneered a bit at their art teachers name. “Daddy says we can play in the garden or we can play cards at the table.”
“How can my dads think you’re the bad guy, you’re sweet.” She looked at him, a watery smile on her face, but her eyes were sincere.
“Sounds like someone’s been watching their films again,” Molly teases. Mycroft raises an eyebrow in mock reprimand, drops it, and then laughs. He laughs freely, joyfully, and with love in his heart, his tablemates join him.
Rosie could have argued, could have lectured or debated but, there’s no debating stupidity. So instead she stood up and threw her cards on the table.
Gina left the safety of the in-between that was her cousin's doorway and stepped fully into the room. "I'll kick his ass if you want me to." Rosie's sniffles stopped, and she let out a short wet laugh and rolled over facing her cousin.
“No!” The Lestrade-Holmes twins kept dancing in a circle in the centre of their playroom. Rosie’s pads stuck to every surface imaginable. The windows, walls, the back of Max’s shirt. Everywhere. If that weren’t bad enough each twin also had one of Rosie’s bras on. Rosie was currently chasing Gina attempting to remove said article of clothing but, the slippery little snake demon dodged and danced at all the right moments.
Sherlock scooped them up and opened them. “Ta, love” he said as he tossed one in air and caught it with his mouth. John chuckled and walked away with the still dramatically displeased toddler.
Gina comes upon a distraught Rosie
Greg turned his focus to the front as well. The woman and the manager were having a heated argument. He was about to ask Mycroft what they were saying when he noticed a strand of black curly hair peaking out from under the blonde. “Oh for the love of,” Greg began, “Shove off Sherlock you’re clearly not winning this. I will call John” he shouted.
Molly smiles, through tears, but not unhappy ones. She shakes her head. “No, no, it won’t be like last time,” she grins, and the entirely too loud pub is suddenly silent, at least to the ears of the three involved people, “four and a half months. Honestly I thought the baggy clothes and yoga pants would give it away the moment you saw me.”
"I don't know about that Regal Regina, but I think a cuddle would do me some good." Rosie sat up and extended her arms towards the younger girl. Gina ran and bounced on to the bed and into Rosie's arms. They made themselves comfortable and enjoyed each other's company. Gina, though glad to offer her cousin the support she needed, was mentally preparing the demise of a teenage boy. For now however, it was cuddle time.
Rosie had had enough. She had a large group project due next week and none of her group mates were pulling their weight. Three older students the year up had taken to recirculating an old rumour that her dad’s had had her mom whacked so that they could be together, and the school was abuzz with those looks and whispers.  And yes, she was on her period. Overall, not a good week. Yet she had still promised to watch the twins for an hour. Their nanny was off today, Uncle Greg, Papa, and Daddy were all on a case. Aunt Molly was in Scotland presenting findings for some sort of study, and Uncle Mycroft, who had been working from home today, was suddenly called in for a meeting. The meeting would take half an hour, plus travel, so really Rosie would only be in charge for an hour. Rosie was thirteen, and had begged her Uncle for the chance, rather have him phone another nanny or sitter. After an agreement between her parents and Uncle Greg, it was decided Rosie could handle it.
Adventure and.....treasure?
John sighed, in no mood to argue. “Are you sure there isn’t an easier way?”
John clenched his jaw trying to keep his anger about Mycroft being involved, in check.
Mycroft copes badly with Mummy's rage.
Mycroft gives a long with, cracking an eye just to give the inspector a look of loathing. “She’ll have to come to me then, which means I better sober up and find the quickest way for her to see Eurus.”
“You jumped off the fucking bridge, the bridge for the love of god. Tower Bridge! Are you insane? No don’t answer, of course you are!” Greg paced in front of them, hand gesticulating wildly. “It’s not enough that you didn’t wait for back up, no you had to tackle the man and jump off a bridge! Not only am I going to be buried in paperwork for the next eternity but I just know your dear brother is going to kidnap me the second I leave the office. Just to inquire why I didn’t stop you! Well I’ll have words for him!” He stopped suddenly, and looked them both over carefully, eyes darting about their faces, legs, and torsos. He sighed. “You’re sure you’re both ok?”
Rosie sat up, and turned to face the desk behind her. Her brow was furrowed, troubled. “But only, I don’t see how you can be.” She looked him straight in the eye. “Daddy and papa were really worried before the wedding yesterday, because Aunt Molly had a convention, and Nan Hudson was going to be visiting her sister. Which meant you had to watch me. And I don’t understand,  because you love us.” She looked at Mycroft with pleading eyes, seeking confirmation.
Greg sat up straight, confused. “Second?”
Sherlock turned around to face him, letting the absolute exhaustion show through his entire body. “I can’t do this anymore John. The Work is everything, at least it’s supposed to be. But then Watson, Rosie, got hurt and everything stopped. I don’t think I’ve been fully aware of anything in weeks. But she can’t get hurt if I work down here, she can’t be assaulted painfully and suddenly if the Work is locked away down here. 221B is home. Mine, yours, and hers. The Work can live down here.”
“He threw his dissected frog at his lab partner, who happened to be the owner’s daughter. I should say said incident occurred after Sherlock had smuggled the abomination onto the playground. He wanted to show the girl why she missed question three of the lab write up.” Mycroft was now mirroring Greg’s position.
Rosie giggled. “Not for long,” she gestured with her head towards the door.
Sherlock froze, turned his face towards Greg’s exclamation, and looked absolutely offended. His moment of pause was enough for the manager to toss him out.
“Honestly Mycroft, you’re lucky I’m covering a shift for a buddy or else someone less sympathetic would have gotten the call of,” here the approaching D.I. lilts his voice in a mocking manner “,Some overly drunkard posh bloke making eerily correct statements about people passing by him on a bench in Vauxhall.”
“Well mate, you’re coming home with me whether you like it or not.” Lestrade’s words are firm but, they hold no malice. “See I’ve been an emotional drunkard idiot myself and I get it. The thing is though that it doesn’t help one wit and if you hadn’t gone and ran off you’d see that you’ve got Sherlock backing you up.”
M: Also...(ง •̀_•́)ง
“Well we’ve had an emotional day, so I do believe we deserve hot chocolate.”
“The foreigners. Daddy says they should all be gone by now. The vote was pretty clear, we’re taking our country back, finally having the gonads to stuff it to the EU. They’ve been robbing us for years and we won’t stand for it any longer.” By now neither child was paying attention to their cards, but instead looking at each other dead in the eyes.
“You did the right thing, and we’re proud of you,” John began, “however, you lied to us and attempted to keep us out of the loop. For that your papa and I need to discuss your punishment. You’re upset, so why don’t you take your food to your room while your papa and I discuss what we’ll do.”
“She sounds like your Papa” John added helpfully.
“Yes!”
“They’re people just the same as us. EU exists to create stability, and maintain peace. If anyone should leave, it’s you and your kind, but right now it’s me.” Rosie pulled out her mobile, meant only for emergencies, and called her Uncle Greg to come and get her as he was closer to her than Hudson.
“Yeah, a bit shaken up, and wet to the bone, but we’re good mate” John replied.
“It’s nothing really. Just some school stress.” She spoke nonchalantly  and shrugged her shoulders, but she didn’t look up at her Da, and continued to draw figure 8’s in her fried rice.
Sherlock hummed an affirmation.
“Well that was fun,” Sherlock said with mirth, “But a nice long hot shower is over due.” John sobered immediately.
“There’s nothing in this world that could possibly make your Gran love you less, or for her to feel you’ve let her down.” Sherlock leaned over and kissed her cheek. “Besides Mycroft is the family disappointment.”
The two men jumped in surprise and turned in the direction of the commotion. Sherlock couldn’t see Mycroft’s face but, he knew he was frowning. Just then Sherlock received texts from both of the men.
Mycroft smiled and nodded in agreement. “Yes, they duet together. But Rosamund, you will find no sympathy from your fathers, Aunt Molly, Nan Hudson, or even me, when it comes to visiting Eurus. Perhaps when you are older, an adult really, talks can be entered into allowing some sort of contact, though I make no promises or even encouragement about it.” He spoke softly, but his voice was firm.
She was left there stunned, not at the coldness of her eldest but, her middle child’s eyes. They held a light again however,  it wasn’t the spark of joy she hoped for. It was an empty baleful fog covered light of intelligence and annoyance. The same Mycroft now carried, the same she saw in her daughter’s eyes after they escaped the fire. Truly, her children were lost to her.
Help. What a word. He’d been trying for three decades to help his family, to be kind, to protect them from themselves and each other. Yet Sherlock returned to the drugs time after time, Eurus was so far detached from any sense of humanity she would design this experiment, and he didn’t even want to think about his parents’ reactions. He winced. He knew that he would have to tell them after this was all over. The knowledge of their impending disappointment and hate is the straw the breaks his proverbial back.
Rosie immediately stilled her movements when she felt Mycroft’s mouth begin to cover her arm. Mycroft bit down, only enough to rest his teeth on her flesh, without any pressure or leaving any indents behind. Rosie opened her mouth in a gasp and looked Mycroft in the eyes. Then Mycroft made a deep chest growl, trying to sound ferocious. Rosie shrieked in joy and began giggling, she found the situation hilarious. Mycroft removed his mouth from her limb, and the took his pocket square out to wipe the bit of saliva from her. He then leaned across the table to pump a bit of hand sanitizer into his palm. He first rubbed it into his hands, and then the access onto Rosie’s arm.
Sherlock is over him in an instant, leaning down to whisper into his ear.
“Have you been out there since you became ...that.” Sherlock gestured in an all encompassing way at the man's body. “Or have you spent time somewhere safe?”
“Hi.” John tries to keep his voice even but doesn’t fully succeed. He is still hidden behind the blue shower curtain which makes it impossible for Sherlock to deduce if he is welcome.
“I don’t know… He’s still there, though. Every time you need him. Shouldn’t that tell you enough?”
"Doubt that the sun doth move, doubt truth to be a liar, but never doubt I love".
“Why?” Sherlock’s frustration was clearly written between the lines of this one line.
John wasn’t able to focus. He felt guilty although he assumed Sherlock had a point. He should definitely call Lestrade and ask if there was anything he could do for him.
He lined his cock up with Sherlock’s dripping entrance and could feel Sherlock’s hole accepting him greedily.
Awkward was an understatement. John was fidgeting the whole time and Sherlock left his gaze lowered to the table. While they were eating neither of them said a word. John kept refilling their glasses of water but didn't dare ask how Sherlock felt and the detective drank them down in one go, every time. When there was nothing left of the sandwiches and both of them had already had 2 cups of tea, John cleaned the table and then gestured for Sherlock to go into the parlour. Stiffly, the detective sat down on the couch and waited for the doctor to join him.
“Of course I am afraid! If I wasn’t we wouldn’t be having this conversation.” He shouted in exasperation.
Sherlock was already nibbling on a piece of toast and watching the cheerful landlady prepare an indulgent breakfast with a fond smile on his face.
Eyeing the dark well hole, Sherlock began to ascend.
“Well…”
“Don’t sound so offended. That’s not my fault. But if it helps, I’d gladly change that.” There was definitely something flirtatious in John’s eyes now. It made Sherlock’s chest feel suddenly full and too tight and let it tingle in an unfamiliar way.
Within a second, Greg was behind him pointing the torch where John was looking. His fast breath was giving away that he hadn't expected to be send in by Sherlock.
“I mean he was…” John watched helplessly as tears started filling her eyes.
The Alpha brought one arm under the Consulting Detective and gave his a cock a few firm strokes before he pushed two fingers of the other hand into his entrance.
“No, I think it would be wasted.” She replied bitterly.
“He is a beta. Normal, if you want.” Sherlock answered narrowing his eyes before he flung himself backwards on the couch he’d been sitting on.
When it was time to get ready for their nocturnal excursion, Sherlock made sure that John was watching him as he pulled on his leather jacket. In turn the soldier made a show of checking his gun in-depth before they left their quarters. Both of them basked in the anticipation of excitement and possible danger. John had long accepted that he didn't handle boredom much better than Sherlock did. He was just less dramatic about it.
“To give me a full body massage?” John asked in disbelief. He leant forward, looking from right to left while trying to find out where this was coming from.
“So, why the box? Care to explain?”
Waking up the next day, John makes his decision. He will learn it. Learn to value her and explore his feelings in depth. He will learn to love her. She deserves to be taken seriously and, hell, he deserves to be loved as well.
In a blur of movement, Sherlock grabbed his coat from the kitchen chair and crossed to the door in two strides, exiting without a look behind
Cautiously, Lestrade walked to the door, taking care to keep a healthy distance to the furious doctor. He just opened his mouth to say something else, when John closed the door with another growl.
*****
The detective stepped on a toothbrush as he took his towel from the hook at the door.
“I...I don't know what that means. John...” Mrs. Hudson was at a complete loss looking around for help.
A few minutes of nervous waiting later, Sherlock heard John’s steps on the stairs, then crossing the kitchen and, finally, there came a knock on his door.
The touch of his hands turned into caressing motions wandering down his back. Featherlight brushes over John's sensitive sides.
“It’s your choice, John. Do you want to come down my throat or have me riding you?” John is unable to respond while his mind supplies vivid pictures of both opportunities.
Nothing Happened. The man jumped up holding on to the pole for balance while he tried and failed to grab the lantern. John cringed watching his attempts to remove his hand from the alien surface. His friend arrived, pulling on his arm while taking care not to touch the thing himself.
Not the safest of guesses but John and Greg had agreed that there was no other possibility than to take the risk.
“The physiotherapist is going to come tomorrow instead of today. Makes more sense anyway if we give your muscles time to relax.” Sherlock stated, sitting on the couch in shoes and a black suit.
With a short nod, John and Greg agreed to circle the creature's hideaway.
“Yes. God, yes. Please, John!” Agonizingly slow, John removed his fingers before he tried to regain the lost time by rolling on a condom hurriedly and coating his cock in a handful of lube.
“Leicester, obviously. Well, if you go there you will find the son of the poor Mrs. Mullins well fed but homesick.”
“Anger…. Disappointment? “
Laughing and sweating profoundly, they were leaning against the wall and each other while they tried to relish the satisfaction of a good chase.
“Lestrade, I would advise you to leave now! As you see, we aren’t in the condition to work. In two weeks, we should be available again. Goodbye.” Sherlock drawled the last word cheerfully and took a forkful of his takeaway before he began to eat the rest of John’s.
“I could easily take them out while Sherlock is blinding them but I think we all know what the real problem is.” John stated evenly. A wave of affection reached him through Sherlock’s hand on his as the other men nodded.
Sherlock felt the tentacles press down on his shoulders as John began to thrust. He hadn’t considered John’s width, not in comparison to the pointed tip he’d enveloped shortly before. He felt the ridge of John’s cock rubbing against his inner walls with every movement of his hips. In his own considerate way, John kissed Sherlock’s knuckles while he build a cautious rhythm. He sighed when he felt the tightness loosen bit by bit around him, a clear sign for him that his partner started to relax into his ministrations. He relished the slow drag on his sensitive skin and the small waves Sherlock’s hips began to make in answer to his own motions.
Watson finally gets a taste of Sherlock.
The Omega reaches out a hand and gestures to some general direction with a smug look on his face, which--considering he’s in heat and is about to follow home a stranger he just met--shouldn’t even belong there, yet, Watson doesn’t ponder on it for too long, especially once Sherlock says, “After you,” and his cock does a little jump, expecting to hear that heavenly “Sir.” that never comes.
Watson’s poring over the notes he captured from the crime scene today. A very messy break in. Not something they’d expect from the omega serial killer suspect John Doe; his homicide scenes, in contrast, were much cleaner. Less...amateur.
Sherlock goes quiet, but Watson continues. “When I met her, she was still a bit sad about it. I had been a heavy gambler ever since the war and she was desperate for a new mate. I believe that we were two people who should have never gotten engaged. I can’t tell you how long it took for me to admit that.
"Take your time, I'm only dying."
“What contradicting parents you have; they want you to stay locked up during your heats, but refuse to put you on suppressants,” Watson contemplates out loud.
And Watson feels wild, animalistic, taking Sherlock good and proper. He can’t really stop himself, just keeps fucking into Sherlock long and deep, each brutal thrust causing the younger man to gasp and beg even more.
He truly feels wonderful, but there’s this horrible, dark twinge of remorse coloring his perfect picture of peace – the regret he can’t quite shake. As much as Sherlock loves Watson, Watson doesn’t belong to him. He belongs to
Watson feels a pang of sympathy for him, because he knows all too well the ignorance of the parents of Omegas. Some despise their children and send them off once they’re of age or arrange a marriage for them so they won’t be a burden to them anymore, while some love their children too much that they become overprotective and some after learning of the Omega status of a child, will simply ignore the child and force the child to fend for themselves. Of course, heats are a terrible time for all, as the uneducated parents, who are most likely not Omegas themselves, never have even the slightest clue of what to do and often the most chosen option is to lock their child away.
Special thanks to my betas Abel and Ranger for the much needed help. You guys are awesome.
“Stop touching yourself,” He commands and the lad halts immediately.  Watson’s hand flies to Sherlock’s hair and he tugs Sherlock’s mouth off his cock. There’s lines of saliva connecting them still, but they are both too gone to care.
Alphas get jealous and though Watson is nothing if not caring and sweet, Sherlock doesn’t want to test the waters. He doesn’t want Watson knowing about Irene because chances are that even if he were understanding of their affiliation, he wouldn’t quite like Sherlock conversing with someone as (his parents would say if they found out as well) ‘boorish’ as she.
“But of course, how else would I survive in that house?” John shrugs, then replies:
“If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be; and if all else remained, and he were annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty stranger.”
Alpha number one nods, then leans in and licks a grimy stripe across Sherlock’s face. “You cause too much trouble. Boss says you need to be silenced.”
So he keeps it a secret, just like his relationship with Watson. He also doesn’t want anyone knowing about the work he does in the dark to bring Omegism down. If no one knows, no one gets hurt.
Sure, it wasn’t the first time the alpha had done one of these seemingly fruitless searches, a side hobby, apparently when he wasn’t off ruthlessly taking the lives of omega citizens. They’d found similar boot prints in a run down pawnbroker’s shop and a few crowded market stalls, where for some reason the suspect had been far more careful in trying not to leave a trace than he had been here. Clearly, he was never successful at disposing of evidence, but he had made attempts, hurried, sloppy attempts, but attempts all the same.
Watson studies him carefully, he’s still the same Sherlock despite the obvious discomfort he’s in, he still remains as beautiful as ever. Watson’s angry that he couldn’t sense that the Omega was hurt, but he supposes that he must have missed a lot of things while he was in his misery.
Watson clears his throat and attempts to stop her from walking away.
Despite his efforts, Sherlock feels it coming, with all the force of a train. He cries out Watson’s name, hole clenching tight as it tries to coax Watson’s knot to pop. And all he manages to do is grin before his orgasm crashes over him, leaving him boneless. He delights when the alpha’s sharp teeth sink into the smooth flesh of his neck - there is no pain, just mind-blowing sensation.
“Ahh, that’s it, Holmes,” Watson praises. “Just relax.” The sea is calling to him, all he wants is to sink down into the depths of pleasure. To be one with Watson in a way they’ve never been.
P.S. I never wanted to leave this at a cliffhanger but they are a necessary evil sometimes. :(
The Alpha in Watson thrills at the fact that the Omega has taken an interest in him, but Watson tamps it down, because this isn’t about him, it’s about the interesting Omega who’s currently fidgeting in his seat. The look he’s giving John is doing nothing to mask his arousal and the scent and heat emitting off him in waves isn’t doing either of them any favors.
Sherlock’s father smirks, “And he gets his rowdy behavior from his mother.”
On a peaceful, rainy Sunday afternoon, Watson languidly situates himself on the chesterfield in the sitting room. A warm cup of tea is resting on an adjacent table and the daily paper is in his hands. He finds it hard to convince himself to leave the lodging for any other reason than it catching on fire. The calming patter of the outside downpour as it taps on the roof coupled with the crackle pop of the burning wood from the fireplace are enough to tempt him into staying, along with the fact that it is probably deathly cold out there while it is toasty in here. Even though he promised he’d go to Scotland Yard to discuss some things with Lestrade, he isn’t feeling the least bit inclined to leave this sanctuary of warmth and comfort.
The bearded Alpha points a grimy finger at the two of them. “You can’t be much of a doctor if you advised the boy to go out in such a state.”
Watson wants to tell Sherlock that he can go anytime, that if he’s unsure or he’s having second thoughts he’s free to leave. His hindbrain barks at him that such a notion is ridiculous. It was torture leading Sherlock to the carriage. With every step they took Watson could swear the boy was emitting more and more of that indescribable scent. The drive to the lodging was completely, unbearably exhilarating with the ache in Watson’s pants taking every opportunity to make itself known. Giving up now, after surviving all of that, would make his torture pointless.
“What’s a pretty little Omega like you doing out here at this time of night? Don’t you know it’s dangerous?” The bearded man questions, stroking the boy’s arm sensually.
“It’s my fiancée, she’s returning today.”
Was listening to a lot of Florence and the Machine, hope you guys like hurt/comfort and fluff. ;)
“Who Sherlock? Who took whom? What are you talking about?”
“There is no one else as qualified for the task as I am and I have too much pride to let something insipid like fear get in the way of my quest to make this city a safer place. He’s murdered numerous omegas, I won’t let him take another one,” Sherlock declares with conviction.
“Whatever may I ask is the problem here?” He inquires, rather bravely, seeing how the other Alpha is considerably larger than him.
“I don’t care! That bastard took my brother. He will pay for this!”
“Are you sure?”
And yet, he was considered one of the lucky ones. To not be in a brothel or forced onto the street because of his status.
The lad’s pleading eyes rise to meet Watson’s and they burn with unresolved hunger. Once again John finds himself being pulled under and brought back to the matter at hand.
I can’t just stay there in my room like this anymore. The older I get it seems the more insatiable my being becomes.” Sherlock frowns, looking ashamed of himself and Watson feels more sympathy tug on his heart.
, really. And then maybe return home.”
Hello everyone! This chapter is pure smut. Maybe it has a little plot? If you blink?
” Sherlock promises, pulling away from the kiss just as Watson’s really beginning to enjoy it. The doctor doesn’t miss the emphasis on the last word and the rush of blood leaving his head to make his dick stand at attention makes Watson dizzy. He has to think of sick patients and illness just to will himself from giving up this whole ‘Righteous Man’ charade and taking what he wants right this bloody minute.
“Sherlock said last week that you thought I was snobbish and cold.” Mycroft spoke distractedly eyes focused on the entrance, where now a woman with long blonde hair was being blocked from entering.
“Gran loves Maths and I’m worried I’ll let her down.”
“How do you know it was Gran?” Rosie was sipping on an apple juice box, staring out the window of the tree house.
“Everyone keeps telling me you’re the bad guy.” Five year old Rosamund Mary Watson made her proclamation unprompted, while drawing unicorns on the scrap paper Mycroft had given her. She was lying on her stomach in the middle of her newly minted Uncle’s home office. The particular unicorn she was drawing had a bright blue mane and purple hooves and horn. She was blissfully unaware of the hurt expression on her Uncle’s face.
Mycroft takes her hands in his, and she stills, subdued at his expression. “Her name is Eurus, she’s mine and your Papa’s younger sister. She is ill, very ill.” Rosamund’s eyes widen in concern. “She’s not dying I’ll sweetheart, her illness is of the mental kind, it makes her dangerous. Very few people are allowed to see her, your Papa is one of them, and he visits every fortnight. She cannot speak anymore but, she does play the violin.”
“What data my dear? And of course you’re not stupid, neither are you an idiot.” She says the last bit giving a reproving look at her elder son.
Lestrade gives a shallow laugh. “Yeah well he’s banned her from seeing Eurus at the moment.”
“Why yous face is coloured?  Markers is for paper only.” Her face was crinkled in concern but her eyes were inquisitive and bright.
Lestrade now gives a full bark of a laugh. “Well you’re half right, with you giving Sherlock special permissions in Eurus care, the two of you are her only access points into Sherrinford.” He leans jovially against Mycroft. “Except, Sherlock has banned her from bothering you about it with the threat of not seeing Rosie for a year if she does.”
Sherlock and John join the muck people.
“If you use up all the hot water again, I swear to god! You’re on the couch for a month!”
“We’ve had three joint Balls, gatherings, and even a damn company picnic together since we moved into the Curtis and not once have you actually been in attendance.” Greg was speaking in an admonishing tone to the younger man beside him but, his eyes were full of mirth. “Yet here we are now, in the most decrepit old pub the North could muster up, sipping a cider.”
Now the two seamed the best of friends. Sherlock was scrubbing the rest of the kitchen, and Mycroft was periodically making growling noises as he read, each one causing a giggle from the infant. It was absolutely disgusting, he couldn’t wait to show John the video he had snagged of the incident when he got home.
He cries, first a few sniffles, then a few tears, until eventually the dam cannot be held back. The knees of his trousers become wet with the abundance of tears and snot. His chest, eyes, and abdomen become sore with the strength of his grief, decades of forced upon responsibilities and secrets. A life of self inflicted loneliness, all in the name of protecting his family, pours out of his soul. He doesn’t wail per se,  but he does scream. He screams as loud as he can for as long as he can. He screams until his throat is raw and his eyes produce no more tears. He hurts, physically, but the torment he allowed to himself to release has stopped the onslaught of emotional pain. He takes a few steading breaths and centres himself and his resolve to escape.
The Holmes-Watson household sat gathered around their kitchen island enjoying a family meal, for once. Sherlock and John had just solved a case around lunch that day. Which meant they both returned to Baker Street dirty, exhausted, and simply collapsed in their bed. Which is how their thirteen year old daughter found them upon her return from school. Normally the sight of her dads collapsed after a successful case brought her joy and excitement, for it meant slow and relaxing times with them. This particular time though, made her stomach twist in anxiety. Dads focused on a case meant dads not paying attention to her worries, dads on a solve high meant hyper fixation on her every mood. The traditional takeaway celebration dinner would mean trouble. So here they sat, two on a solve high, one playing with her food.
The aggravating ring of the doorbell snaps him out of his self-deprecating thoughts. For a second, he’s about to call Mrs. Hudson to go and get the door when he once again remembers. He rakes his frantic hands through his hair. Sinking down into his chair, his long wispy fringe shadowing his face, he heaves a great sigh - he will move on, as Watson did.
Hope you all like this chapter! <3
me? Did I hear that correctly?” Sherlock blinks, because this
Watson’s in his dress pants, suspenders and white silk shirt. The sleeves are rolled up as he works on filling the tub with hot water. “Get undressed.” He orders softly, not looking at Sherlock.
Sherlock doesn’t explicitly need permission, they both know this, but that’s why he says it, to kill Watson with the anticipation alone. Watson gives him a nod, all the same.
“And it is too late for me to change my mind,” Sherlock informs them, though it sounds as if he already has.
The burning is starting to dull now. Little sparks of pleasure dance along his spine as his body adjusts to the cock spreading him wide. If he relaxes some more, he can probably get Watson in up to the hilt. “Don’t you dare,” he warns, gasping out.
“Well, come on. I haven’t got all day.” He says, preparing himself for their ambush.
One day, he hopes to visit his brother, hopes that the distance that separates them will no longer be a problem. He feels bad from time to time, because Mycroft never asked for any of this, to be the one that didn’t fit in with the perfect picture their parents tried to paint. To be sent away or forced to leave for fear that he would ruin the Holmes’ reputation. It was wrong, but sooner or later, things have a way of coming back to haunt…
"Mother, Father? Can we get back to the matter at hand please?”
So far, this day has been one of the strangest in his life.
They won’t be getting much sleep after all, but Watson finds that he doesn’t mind one bit...
"Of all the fires, love is the only inexhaustible one."
care, not when it feels so -
Watson doesn’t seem bothered by his eagerness, instead he smirks, cruel but kind. “Are you saying that all it will take for me to claim you, is to promise that I won’t leave and mean it?” His calculating blue eyes scan Sherlock’s face perhaps for signs of subterfuge.
Watson cannot find the words to speak. Mary, once again, glances between the two of them. “How?” She questions.
The Omega gapes at Watson in disbelief, before saying with great admiration and some dubiousness dripping from his words. “You’re crazy.”
“I need you to tell me how bad you want this.”
“I’m serious.” He hisses, though it holds no steam. He’s too preoccupied watching the slight bob of the boy’s Adam’s Apple, wondering if it will taste honey-sweet if he just laved it with his tongue, to stop Sherlock as he tiptoes to steal a kiss to Watson’s parted lips. And Watson--God deliver him--can’t stop himself, he leans into the kiss and stares at the lad as if he just knows he’s dreaming, because Sherlock can’t be real, he just can’t.
she thinks,
As if possessed by a spirit, the omega flips himself around, pressing his face into a pillow, he raises his arse for Watson’s view. He’s presenting, he’s never done this before but he doesn’t feel the need to be shy. As Watson lets out a satisfied growl and clutches his arse again, Sherlock feels emboldened.
He’s eighteen now and old enough to be living on his own, but with the rising crime and the rate of adolescents going missing, his parents are, understandably, anxious about sending him anywhere alone.
It’s the first time he’s been in a solely Alpha pub since getting engaged to Mary and he has to admit, it feels strangely… welcoming. It’s definitely been too long.
Watson hadn’t planned for Mrs. Hudson to meet Sherlock, but then again it wasn’t as if he planned for any of this.
As he turns to go fetch his coat, he almost collides with his mother who is standing at the foot of the stairs, watching him with concern in her hazel eyes. “Wherever are you going?” She inquires, a flash of suspicion darkening her tone.
If you enjoy this chapter, please leave a kudos or a comment or both. ;) Also, I want to thank all of you amazing readers who have been sticking with me from the beginning and even those who have just started reading. I appreciate everything! Thank you!
“Are you alright?” He asks, pausing from his actions to check Sherlock over. The lad is squirming and breathing hard, but boy does he look like a pretty piece. All bound like that, he looks like Watson’s very own gift. Watson can’t help but stop to tap an idle finger at Sherlock’s hole, basking in how it flutters at the mere hint of an intrusion.
Sherlock gives him one of those breathtaking grins that Watson hadn’t realized was possible until now. Honestly, could the boy be any more charming? He places another kiss to John’s jaw before finding his lips and it is suddenly clear what his intentions are.
And dammit if Sherlock isn’t everything Watson didn’t know was missing from his life. He looks like a gift from the heavens. And Watson wonders what he did right in a past life to deserve such a thing. Sherlock’s eyes are closed while he chants John’s name like a prayer, his lips deliciously swollen and red, and every now and then his hips rise to meet Watson’s and it feels too damn good. But Watson knows they haven’t even started the fun stuff yet.
You go Watson! Go get Sherlock! Also, I know I made Irene totally very un-alpha in this chapter, but I swear she's very much the dominant one in her relationship with Mary, while Mary is the wise one. They make a good pair, or I like to think so. :) Anywho, thanks for reading and I'll see you in the next chapter. Love you guys loads!
Despite himself, Watson grumbles in annoyance, pinching the bridge of his nose. “Of all the times to take Lestrade seriously, why now, hmm? Suddenly, now you trust his judgment? Or is it simply the call of danger you cannot resist?” It comes off more scathing than he means it to.
Anyways, I hope you all enjoy this chapter!
Please expect an epilogue and a delicious, steamy mpreg smut bonus chapter coming soon.
” The young lad replies and it goes straight to Watson’s groin.
Sherlock looks back at him, eyes still wild but at least a little more calm than they were before.
The doorbell rings again and Sherlock stalks over to the foyer, frustrated and miffed at the obnoxious visitor who obviously can’t take a hint. With nothing but his trousers and his long-sleeved shirt on, he presses himself against the door.
, badly. Need it, need you.”
<3 you all!
I love you all so, so much. Thank you for sticking with this fic so far and for putting up with me. I am forever grateful!
Once the velvet soft head slips in, there’s still the stretch as the rest of Watson’s length presses in. The burning is fading and in its place is an insistent pulsing ecstasy that’s forcing him to let go of his willpower and just ride Watson like he wants. But he holds tight, until Watson is sheathed up to the hilt and he’s free to push back, fucking himself while Watson watches in a daze.
Watson places money on the table and moves to rise from his seat, but Sherlock stops him by grabbing his arm. “Wait,” the boy pleads, “take me with you?”
and Watson’s so hard it
He goes over to hug her, getting his long arms to wrap around her tiny waist easily.  She pats him on the head. “Be safe.” She cautions and he smirks, “Will do, ma’am.” Before walking over to the window and climbing out.
And Sherlock finds that there is nothing left to say, except maybe “I love you,” over and over. It feels good knowing that he has all of eternity to say that, after all, he refuses to lose Watson again. Wherever he goes, Sherlock will follow. Always. Even if it is to the ends of the earth, he will follow his mate, without question. For the undeniable fact is his love knows no bounds. It can’t even be contained by his heart.
Frustrated, he stops running. And takes in a few full breaths. On his third inhale, he senses something; he is not alone. There’s a man who’s been following him since he left Irene and two more  a foot away behind him.
"You're a holy fool all colored blue
And ambush they do. It isn’t much of a fight, but Sherlock manages to get one down, but the other two prove to be much more worthy adversaries and get Sherlock into a corner.
I want to thank my beta readers Kate, Abel, and Ranger for the much needed help and advice.
“If what I thought mattered, I’d be the one going down the aisle with her and not you.”  John bites his lip - a nervous habit he was accustomed to doing in his solitude - finally he answers:
“We will never be even.” She mutters, and with that said, she leaves.
“Forgive me, Lestrade, but I am encountering a great amount of difficulty in my attempts to understand exactly what, if any, advantages exist for this plan. I mean, it's absolutely preposterous and it appears Holmes agrees,” Watson says, his disapproval so apparent Sherlock doesn’t even need to raise his head from the dusty footprint he’s investigating to know that his alpha is extremely far from pleased. Instead, he nods to show his solidarity with his mate, albeit absentmindedly.
He shakes his head again. “If it means anything, I would just like to return to Watson.” He shudders again and bites his lip. “I don’t really want my parents seeing me like this.” He clarifies and shows her the bruises.
of his sanity, Watson closes his eyes. Clearing his throat, he says, sternly, “You can’t wear that.”
Watson leans him back until he’s pressing into the mattress, the alpha’s sturdier frame keeping him still as he peppers kisses across Sherlock’s bare skin…
And as much as Watson would prefer
So he stayed silent, pursing his lips, he took the scolding and waited until his father was finished before asking if he could retreat to his room. And when they’d sent him off and he was safe in his seclusion, he sat down on the carpeted floor, sighing from sheer exhaustion and the relief of escaping virtually unscathed.
“Sherlock no, please it’s too dangerous.”
“Breathe,” Watson urges, placing a kiss to Sherlock’s hair. And so, Sherlock, unable to find it within himself to make a scathing retort, does. Concentrating on the beat of his heart, the firm hand on his back and the other on his hip, Sherlock tries to calm himself down. Pressing back experimentally, he wills his body to let up on the death grip it has around Watson’s dick.
“Yes, but it is also something that many people avoid.  We’re connected now, our minds, bodies, souls are one. You can feel my emotions and so it is the same with me.” Every word makes Watson’s stomach twist with unease but Sherlock needs to understand this.
He blinks, temporarily disoriented by the circumstances. “Uh, yes. I’m just a little shaken.”
Watson continues, “If you want me to go, I can. I’ve lied to everyone, and that was wrong, but the pain I’ve inflicted upon you…well let’s just say…” He pauses to place a gentle, lingering kiss to Sherlock’s brow. “I deserve to be violently struck by lightning. I’ve been selfish this whole time and you’ve been nothing but good to me. You need only say the word and I’ll be gone. You deserve so much better than me, Holmes. I hope my absence will constantly remind you of that. Though it kills me,” Watson places a warm kiss to Sherlock’s hand, entwining his fingers with his and clasping tightly. “I want your life to be as wonderful as you deserve, even if it holds no place for me.”
Watson chuckles. “Your wish, my command.” And he slowly inches more of himself into Sherlock’s wet heat. When the alpha finally bottoms out, it’s a thrill. Like every nerve in Sherlock’s body is alive and bursting with a current of unbelievable intensity. The waves crash over him and he surrenders himself to the rush, letting it flood him. They both wait for the extraordinary pleasure to settle before Sherlock is urging Watson to finally move.
, pleading with him.  “I need this.” is all Sherlock says, sounding broken beyond repair already, and Watson has barely even touched him.
“I’ll be on my best behavior,
Watson’s warm, soft lips press against his and steal all the air from his lungs, replacing the oxygen with his delightful scent. It’s like something off limits, a foreign, forbidden taste of what Sherlock can have, but all too soon Watson pulls away.
"I’ll wait here for Mary. Do you need anything? Cab fare?”
“You’re old enough to learn about soul bonds and pheromones. I’m guessing your parents have little care about what the law says the correct age of consent is and want to raise you by their own rules. Which is reasonable, seeing that many Omegas are forced into prostitution at a young age. I can even understand that they want to save you from such a fate, and yet it has been a massive failure seeing that you’re here instead of at home.” Watson points out.
Mycroft is due for his visit in a couple of days and Sherlock’s getting restless. It doesn’t help that the only person he has to talk to about it is Gertrude, seeing as his parents never really mention Mycroft or allow Sherlock to talk about him much (it’s a touchy subject for both of them as Mycroft hasn’t yet forgiven them for what happened).
In a ragged, breathless voice, Sherlock softly whispers, “I haven’t tempted you into doing anything you didn’t already want to, doctor. You can still walk away now.” John thinks of Mary for a second, wonders what she'd say if she found out. Perhaps it would be better for him if he ignores this little temptation and he just carries on walking home. But then his hindbrain informs him that this opportunity to have a gasping, sweet smelling, writhing Omega in his grasp is rare. Frustrated, he sighs; a warm gust of air in the cool London night.
Watson pinches the bridge of his nose. “Mary, not now, please?”
“We’re getting married, what do you think?” Watson asks. Sherlock frowns.
His voice is hoarse when he calls Watson’s name. A part of him wishes the alpha has left him, that he’s already gone back to Mary while Sherlock was sleeping. He doesn’t want to watch Watson leave again - that’s a scene that doesn’t need replaying.
Watson pauses to pull off his suspenders and Sherlock licks his lips as the shirt goes next. Watson has a beautiful chest, it’s hard and muscular where Sherlock’s is soft and lanky, with scars from the war of long ago. Watson never seems embarrassed of them, though he has nothing to be embarrassed about - they are as wonderful as the rest of him. It tapers off to a narrow waist, strong thighs and a gorgeous arse. Sherlock doesn’t quite know what his favorite thing about Watson’s body is and with so much for the eyes to feast on it’s hard to pick just one, but as he watches the alpha unbutton his pants and slide them down to reveal his, thick, leaking cock, he may admit that he likes that part most of all.
“You’d look so pretty on my knot, stretched full and begging me to move. And those
And Watson groans. He knows on his tombstone, the words
sensation. Of course there’s a bit of soreness, in his leg particularly, but it is not uncommon for him to wake like this. However, there’s a new feeling. Something akin to distress. At first he lays there, trying to make sense of this mood, but then it becomes very overwhelming and soon he finds that he can not lay still.
“Oh hello mother, I didn’t want to disturb you or father. I was going to take a walk.” He smiles, easily lying due to many years of practice.
He should
That night, Sherlock cries himself to sleep, but Watson is there, holding him the entire time. He understands that what has happened is serious and so truly awful. It hurts him to see his omega so, so sad. But he can’t just let Sherlock go after one of London’s most violent men. He’d die before he’d let that happen.
He shakes his head in the negative. “No, but thank you for saving me.”
With the help of his mother, Sherlock comes forward.
He winces. “I’m sorry, Mary. You cannot believe how true those words are -”
And then he feels it - the sharp sting of a slap. His hand rises to touch the quickly reddening bruise and he looks up at her in shock.
Once again, it all just screams of urgency to him. Desperation. Like John Doe really can’t afford to get too creative or comfortable anymore. But why? Why now? What has changed?
Watson wants to deny him, but his trousers tighten at the desperation practically dripping from those words. But he’s engaged to a terrific beta woman and there was a reason he chose a beta—he’s not one to bend to the will of biology and he definitely won’t break all those years of resolve over one adolescent—but he can feel the warmth from Sherlock’s arm through his coat and the way the lad is looking at him with those huge bourbon eyes, irises totally eclipsed by pupil, hunger evident in them, the protesting words can’t help but escape the doctor.
“We need to talk.”
Is blazing in me out of all control"
Any hope of an intelligent response from Watson is soon to be abandoned forever, when he feels something wet pool against his chest where Sherlock’s pressed against him. The omega’s slowly filling breasts seem determined to rob him of whatever sanity he has left as they ruin his shirt, leaking profusely as his mate mindlessly crushes them against him.
Sherlock sighs, the tears begin to fall but he doesn’t make any effort to wipe them away. Why can’t it ever be easy? Why does he have to love the one person he absolutely cannot have? He leans his head on Watson’s shoulder and closes his eyes.
, need you, God, need you to
“I can’t be wise when it comes to you, I’m afraid.” Sherlock’s smile is wide but his eyes burn into Watson’s with blazing sincerity. “Promise me you’ll stay,” he pleads.
He sucks a bruising hickey into the hollow at Sherlock’s back and then finally,
Sherlock, having heard enough, goes over to them. “What I am about to say, and Lestrade I wouldn’t get used to this, not for a moment, but I’m afraid Watson that I agree with him. First, he’s right it is a snowball’s chance, and mercy help me, but secondly, as absurd as this whole plan is, he’s correct, we don’t have many chances to get close to the suspect. We cannot wait any longer before he takes his next victim.” Tucking a curl of his dark hair back in place, Sherlock turns his pleading gaze on Watson. “He won’t let anyone other than his admirers anywhere near him and so we don’t have many options. It will only be for a few hours, and I won’t let anything happen. It may very well be our best opportunity to catch this criminal.”
The alpha inches more and more of himself in at a torturously slow pace. Watson’s cock is bigger than Sherlock’s ever imagined. Even with the amount of slick he’s producing, there’s still an incredible burn as it stretches him. He groans out, trying to pull away but his hole seems to have other plans. It clenches around the intrusion latching on, taking them both off-guard.
The salty, all-encompassing scent, coupled with the heat in the room, causes sweat to form along Sherlock’s body. His heart thunders in his chest, loud and erratic while the taste of Watson’s lips still lingers on his tongue, like a savory treat. Strong fingers card through his hair, pulling him until his back is flush to Watson’s chest.
Once he sees that they are gone, Watson turns to Sherlock who is staring at the doctor’s equipment skeptically. “You don’t actually use these things?” He asks.
- Saint Augustine
A soulbond, especially one as strong as theirs, is something that has many aftereffects, whether or not these aftereffects are wanted is beside the point. They are something to be controlled and sometimes, even ignored, as a soulbond from the result of mating should not prevent one from functioning in daily life. Watson knows that he and Sherlock are going to have to get these
After ensuring that he’s tucked into his massive bed, she sends for one of the maids, Gertrude, to keep an eye on him. And when the ever busy, ever stressed Gertrude, probably the only person Sherlock trusts in the house, comes to check up on him, she smiles.
they could make saints sin, boy. I bet you’re not even real; bet you’ve just walked out of someone’s dirtiest, naughtiest dreams, ready to lead ‘em to hell. You’re temptation and corruption in a sweet, little package, aren’t you?” Watson whispers into his ear.
The only sound that can be heard is the lad’s hard panting, “Your name?” he asks and Watson knows he doesn’t owe this boy anything, but his very
“Holmes, love, you know you don’t have any obligation to go through with tomorrow,” Watson tells him, rubbing a soothing hand across his back.
Despite all the calamity, Mycroft visited faithfully every year. He’d come to see Sherlock, bearing gifts and hilarious, fascinating stories about his pilgrimage and life in France.
“You’re lactating,” he says, in a strange mix of both wonder and arousal and now he’s really sure he needs to get some distance or Sherlock's going to find himself not only filled with a knot but bred properly too. He’s not so sure how well Lestrade’s little plan would go over if the main jewel in his crown shows up reeking of Watson’s pheromones and leaking his spunk and repelling every alpha within a thirty-mile radius.
When they’re finished, both satisfied and panting, Sherlock asks him, “Does it feel like home again?” And Watson, bless him, says with candor, “
But Watson is no longer listening, he’s too busy glaring at the devious, wicked trickster standing before him who has suddenly replaced his mate right before his very eyes. Tempting and effervescent,
“Whatever is the matter, Watson? Do you not like it? I can wear something else. I just thought maybe I would be more irresistible in--” And heavens, he might be hyperventilating. Or is Watson the one hyperventilating? Who knows? And good heavens, were the walls always so mobile? Were they made to shift and bend like that?
Sherlock chews his bottom lip, looking in Watson’s direction without even seeing him. Instead, his mind is preoccupied with thoughts of unknowingly putting on the worst performance known to man and ruining everything. “As you know, I can neither flirt nor act, Watson, much less to save my life, which is precisely the predicament we’re in.”
“Well, if you’ll excuse me. I’ll just be going to the shop now.” Mrs. Hudson says, regaining her composure and trying to escape from the scene of the crime unscathed.
“So tight,” Watson praises. “You’ve let yourself go untouched for so long.”
It’s hard to describe what Sherlock is wearing, simply for the fact that there’s not much to describe. Watson’s never seen him reveal so much skin. His pants are far too short and way too tight, and the shirt he’s wearing under his jacket is thin enough to leave nothing to the imagination and so sheer against his throat that Watson can detail exactly where he would like to sink his teeth. It’s too much and not enough all at once. And mercy help him. He needs air.
Sherlock’s father nods before speaking in his warm voice. “Well Sir, my name is Arthur, but you my good man, may call me Mr. Holmes.”
“I want to, Watson. Do you not believe I can do it?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock turns to call his father but as soon as he turns his back to the constables, his mother is there. “To what do we owe the pleasure of this visit?” She quips.
Sherlock grins. “That’s why I like you, Irene.” He gives her the money and she slides another picture to him. It’s a man with red hair, it’s not a dark auburn like Irene’s but his eyes are almost the same color as hers.
“Holmes, please.”
However, that other part of Watson invites the lad inside, and the urge returns. Before he can stop himself he’s moving into the boy’s space, gripping Sherlock’s hair and tipping those perfect, plush lips to his. And it’s like drowning, sinking, going under, deep into the depths of lust where everything else is overrated: air, rules, society. The only thing that matters is Sherlock. All that should ever matter is Sherlock.
Hello everyone! It's good to be back! Happy New Year, I hope it's going beautifully for you guys. <3
But Sherlock’s own dulce one is intertwining with his dangerously, along with the post-coital aroma lingering in the room from last night. He can practically almost taste it, the salty sweet caramel-like consistency that’s keeping him on edge. He can’t quite get himself off but neither can he stay this hard forever. It’s fucking intoxicating, and cruel. And Sherlock can probably sense this too, but he’s quiet, as if he can do this all day with no complaint, just ghosting his breath over Watson’s dick, driving him mad, until either of them does something about it.
The boy—Sherlock, levels his gaze with him and in those eyes there is desperation and innocence as well as the same sort of self-assurance that can only be seen in lads his age, yet Watson’s never seen it on Omegas in heat.
“And what do you deserve?” Suddenly, Watson’s low voice comes from somewhere in the room and Sherlock’s heart beats faster as the blood rises to color his cheeks. The alpha’s scent, calmer now, surrounds him, willing him to relax as strong, warm arms wrap around him, pulling him closer.
A litany of curses string from his lips as he watches Sherlock just take it. He knows Sherlock is wet, hell, people from the streets below probably know, the smell is certainly there, but Watson wants to
“They took him, tortured and mutilated him until he was almost unrecognizable.” Sherlock whispers so low that Watson would probably not have caught it, if he weren’t paying attention. The rain begins to pick up again, so the doctor puts his makeshift brolly over Sherlock and tries to get him to come inside.
And as he stares down at his mate, still making a mess of himself, filling the room with the scent of his honey sweet slick and breastmilk, Watson's not so sure this won't, in fact, kill him. But still, he tries to get Sherlock’s attention. He calls his name softly, but Sherlock is way too wrapped up in chasing his own pleasure, pleasure he rarely takes the time to explore, to care. He peers up at Watson with those large, pleading brown eyes, seeming to ask permission to dry hump him right there in his study. All for that peak he needs to reach.
Okay, onto the story: enjoy. ;)
I also updated the tags and will continue to update them as needed.
However, the next day he wakes up alone. Not remembering when he fell asleep, he mentally reprimands himself. Because lying there in Sherlock’s place, is a note that simply reads:
Eventually he does cross the distance into the room. He knows he must look like he’s in great pain, because Sherlock tilts his head and screws his face into a pout when he sees him. Watson’s trying to tame the alpha and be civil and maybe even romantic but damn it, it’s not easy.
Sherlock whimpers and tries to move his hips, but Watson’s herculean grip doesn’t let up. “What?” He frowns.
ready and he’d be so perfect, so innocent and yet this is wrong. He should just leave, go back to his fiancée and pretend he’d never met the lad.
John sighs and presses his face against Sherlock’s chest, inhaling that amazing scent of butterscotch as well as his own musky aroma. Watson’s glad that Sherlock hadn’t tried too hard to scrub away their mingled scent from his skin as it makes the lad all the more real instead of too dreamlike. As if he needed anymore reassurance that last night happened or that this is happening now.
snarls, this was a bonafide Alpha
the best plan we have, then we have as much hope as a snowman’s chance in hell!”
Luckily, Watson regains some sense and stops Sherlock before he can go any further. Sherlock pushes and pulls, but Watson’s grip is like iron.
about him. Decent, proper Watson has thoughts of him - and inappropriate thoughts at that?
Wrapping a comforting arm around Sherlock to drag him away from the eager beta, Watson sighs. “You’ve apparently never courted Holmes.”
He can see her reluctance, but to his surprise, she pulls him to her side and leads him out of the alley.
Fire, Flesh and Bone
Then he remembers that he was asked a question and he blinks, trying to get air into his lungs. “I deserve a life that I can endure. You are both the worst and most wonderful thing to have happened to me, Watson.” He gazes into the alpha’s face, unable to hide the pain from his voice or his expression. “And I don’t know whether to thank you or curse you bitterly for that.” He swallows, closing his eyes again and tries to make his voice sound less broken. “Why-why did you come here?”
Rising up to look at his mate, Sherlock studies Watson’s pressed lips and burning eyes, the way his grip tightens on the sheets below him and his quickening breathing and then a light bulb switches on. “Y-you’re jealous of the alpha?”
The lad points those wide, dark eyes on John and frowns. “But wouldn’t that be lying by omission? And what if they can sense it on me?”
Watson places a soft kiss to the palm of Sherlock’s hand. “I just don’t want you to get hurt. I don’t know what I’d do with myself if anything happened to you.”
“You’re so marvelous,” he hears himself say, rubbing Sherlock’s back soothingly while he licks the claiming mark he’s made to the boy’s flesh.
“Do you know who’s in charge?” He asks, looking around for any wandering eyes. When he looks down at the picture, it’s as gruesome as the last.
“My name’s John Watson,” he declares. Sherlock seems to float the name around his brain, perhaps testing to see if it sounds recognizable. Watson sees the exact moment when he realizes the name holds no familiarity, as the boy’s eyes flash again and next thing Watson knows a pair of warm, plush lips are on his.
The pause seems to go on forever and Watson almost wishes it would, except even he knows that today is just not his day.
Omega. Everything comes crashing down on him. All the memories, meeting Sherlock,
Sherlock’s face lights up with curiosity. “Do you love her?” The question throws Watson off guard.
As soon as he steps through the door, his skin prickles and his spine stiffens—Alphas. The whole bar’s full of them, but of course it is. What else could he expect from a town just a few miles from Devil’s Acre, one of the most overpopulated Alpha slums in London?
Grinding down roughly, Watson watches as Sherlock lets out a needy whine before covering his mouth with his again. Tongue breaching Sherlock’s parted lips, he teases more breathless moans from him while rocking his hips. He seems determined to reduce Sherlock to nothing but a whimpering, begging omega.
“If a man is not rising upwards to be an angel, depend upon it, he is sinking downwards to be a devil.”
There’s a pause before firm hands are pressing Sherlock back down to the mattress, bending him until his arse is raised high and his head is low. His hole twitches eagerly in anticipation and he closes his eyes, trying to slow down his breathing.
me to leave. Apparently, the truth all came out while I was influenced by…other things.” He laughs, but it holds no mirth. “I’m surprised you haven’t figured it out yet that our marriage is a farce. It was an act of sheer cowardice, choosing her over you. But I still hurt you, despite my best efforts, and that is…unforgivable.”
Watson chokes on perfectly good air, “That’s not how this works. It’s not just your body; your soul will bond with this person as well. Alphas can break a bond at anytime, but it’s not an easy process, and it usually isn’t a good outcome especially for an Omega. Didn’t you learn this in school?”
Sherlock comes again, way before Watson is even ready to be finished with him. His arse clenches around John’s dick but it only serves to make Watson fuck him deeper, leaving angry palm prints on Sherlock’s arse cheeks as he thrusts like a madman.
“How did this happen?” Watson asks, more to Sherlock than anyone else, but his father answers: “We caught him trying to sneak out.” He says unimpressed.
Still, he feels a little cheated. Without Mrs. Hudson around, who despite her nagging is somewhat decent company, what is he supposed to do? Go outside? That idea is so preposterous it’s comical.
“Thank you, Mary,” Sherlock smiles at her. “I figure that I owe you that much.”
I want to give a special thanks to all those who've read/kudos'd/subscribed/everything to this story! I am forever grateful to the responses this story has received. Thank you guys so much! I also want to thank my betas 95Echelon, Abel and Secret for the much needed help and inspiration. And for giving me the kick in the pants I need to keep writing!
Sherlock continues like that, tracing patterns on Watson’s dick with his tongue while his warm, wet lips place tender kisses at the base, right where John’s knot waits to rise. Watson’s knees feel weak as the pleasure dances up and down his spine, and he’s tempted to just fuck Sherlock’s face like he asked, but he really doesn’t want to interrupt the show Sherlock’s making of worshipping his dick.

The boy looks up, giving Watson a better view of his eyes, darker than ebony they focus on him, like a night with no stars, like a sky without sun, they pin him, calculating. Watson has to catch his breath when he sees the lad’s nostrils flare as he scents him. It’s almost too much and Watson almost loses it once the boy pulls his plush bottom lip between his teeth and
Watson fiddles with the tub some more, adjusting the temperature and not looking at Sherlock.
Luckily, they had been so happy to see him, of course, and understandably distressed by his sudden disappearance that they hadn’t asked too many questions or evidently noticed that something was off. When he’d explained that he’d been with the Rochester brothers, his mother, who’d seemed the most troubled, with all her crying and refusing to release him from her constricting embrace, had calmed a little by that news. His father, on the other hand, had scolded him for leaving and had told him that being out on his heat was a ridiculous thing to do.
The perpetrator left only two dusty boot prints, and a broken doorknob as the only trinkets to remember him by. Not his usual frequent; dressmaker's shops must lack that certain je ne sais quoi to attract many grimy murdering Alphas, Watson surmises.
And what would he want from these places? If he’s not stealing or buying anything, then why break in? Is he searching for something? Someone, perhaps?

Watson doesn’t try to stop her again and lets her leave with nary a look back.
Both Sherlock and his mother say nothing. They don’t want to know, don’t want to think.  It isn’t until the constable flips open the watch and they are forced to read the inscription in perfect cursive, in a moment that will haunt Sherlock forever, in tauntingly infallible gold calligraphy,
. It would make him feel less guilty.
Then Sherlock grins wickedly, perhaps figuring it out...he leans in close to Watson, close enough that his breath tickles Watson’s ear. “I want to try something.”
, Watson quickly reminds himself—is walking temptation; from his come hither lips that are currently pursed to his huge, dark eyes searching the room for someone and his messy hair, that is in desperate need of a trim, ruffling when the boy turns his head.  And then that smell hits him, that warm, butterscotch scent that makes his mouth water and his hindbrain practically explode from the need to do something about this torture.
Sherlock is rubbing his wrists and his shoulders, both bruised red now by the harsh grip of the brutes. When he looks up, Mary is running towards him. “Are you alright?”
chance in hell and though I concede that the suspect has homicidal tendencies, Holmes would not be doing this alone. Need I remind you that you and I and the best constables in the force will be just outside the door where the uh. . .strategy will take place?”
“Are you in rut?” He asks, and Watson would have hugged him and kissed him for being his own little doctor, if the very mention of rut didn’t have Watson’s twitching dick leak precome. But he does gain the common sense to shake his head again.

“It must be fated that I end up being your doctor.”
“He gets his cynicism from his father.” The woman with the hazel eyes and beautiful smile remarks.

With tears in her eyes, Mary walks over to her fallen things, kneels down to collect them and whispers: “I never want to see you again John. And as for you,” she turns around and points an accusing finger at Sherlock
“That’s a shame, then,” Watson says, slowly making his way over to him before planting both his hands firmly on his hips. “He’d get off lucky. You in the habit, sweet talking him with that mouth of yours.” As Sherlock’s head eases up the slightest fraction and his scent peaks in curious response, Watson makes sure to drop his voice, bending slightly so his breath ghosts the shell of Sherlock’s ear. “Meanwhile I get you, prancing around in this,” and to emphasize he reaches for the swollen globes of Sherlock’s arse, squeezing the tender flesh through the barely there fabric of his pants. “Saying so little to me, while your body is making all these promises.” He trails a hand along the seam of his omega’s ass loving that he can feel so much of his glorious, now dewy flesh. It’s
Of course, this isn’t exactly doing anything to ease the panic rising within him, especially with Sherlock being this close. In fact, this is the stupidest, least logical thing to do in this situation. But, he doesn’t want to alarm his mate. So, he takes a deep breath, planning to look at anything but the pretty omega standing in front of him. He’s beginning to think this evening can still be salvaged when said omega tip toes suddenly, and Watson’s hand quickly finds itself acquainted with the soft, plush skin of Sherlock’s arse.
The feeling is short-lived because almost as soon as his dick earns its freedom and Sherlock is basking in the sight of it, he gets a flash of an impish grin before a soft but firm hand wraps around him and is tugging gently.  Sherlock gives him one last evil look before he guides the pulsing head to his mouth, giving it a teasing kiss and wiping precome onto his now glistening lips. Watson shudders, trying his best to stay still, if he moves and does what he wants, this will be over way too quickly. Sherlock seems to sense what Watson is doing and as a reward, Watson’s cock is met with the burning warmth of a slick tongue licking a stripe from the base to the tip. And the sound Watson makes is absolutely guttural.
But Watson doesn’t want to discourage Sherlock from getting ideas or trying to explore new things. He doesn’t want to stop the lad from his actions by fucking the living hell out of him every time he does something irresistible. So the only thing he does is try to even out his breathing and it works, he wills his arousal into a more comfortable state and is about to encouragingly rub his fingers through Sherlock’s hair to reassure him that he can take his time, when in a voice that’s a little deep but still as innocent as ever, the lad says with absolutely no shame, “I want you to pull my hair and force me to call you
“I belong to those 90 per cent but I wouldn’t want a child, anyway. Extinction is our destiny, it seems.” Sherlock said coolly.
“I know you would see right through it, but that doesn’t matter. And, actually, nothing matters anymore. You left me, Sherlock! You fucking left me!” He took a steadying breath to calm down, it was a cemetery after all.
Promptly, John felt Sherlock tense below him and clench around his cock.
“Hello.” John said, grinning and with a playful nod in Sherlock’s direction. He was just about to ask, if Sherlock would like to watch the storm with him, when suddenly there was a hand at his nape and plush lips pressing against his.
She left a few minutes ago, crying and furious. John is standing at the window staring out on Baker Street as if he would find answers out there.
Slowly, Sherlock drags just the tip of his cock over John’s hard arousal leaving a trace of pre-come on the sensitive flesh. The doctor squeezes his eyes shut and lets out a small whimper.
“You ever done this before?” John asked in a hushed voice.
“I am not sure.”
A muscle underneath that purple silk shirt flexed restlessly in a sign of agitation.
“Oh, fff....” He commented eloquently as his breath left him in a rush. Not having a choice, John pulled back and repeated the motion. He clenched his eyes shut. The onslaught of stimulation, Sherlock’s appreciative groans and the pale man’s flushed face simply too much to handle.
“Idea? I assure you, I know what I'm doing.” Sherlock tilted his head to the side, undoubtedly trying to deduce a reason to hesitate. “Or is there another logical reason to pay someone less qualified.”
“How long do you feel like that? Two weeks? Three? Don’t fall for your lizard brain John!” Sherlock said angrily.
“Lestrade. You shook his hand. Shortly after, he fell ill. I met him at the Yard and noticed that he kept scratching his back. Long story short, he’s got tentacles and disturbing dreams about my brother.”
“7 weeks and 3 days.” John answered immediately.
John grinned to himself. With precision he let just the tip of his erection glide over Sherlock’s now perceptibly hardening shaft. The movement made both men groan simultaneously before each of them strove to intensify the sensation.
“Did you actually listen to me?” The Consulting Detective asked annoyed. “And if anyone did, it was Howard Phillips.” He added defensively.
“Drawer.” Sherlock replied before he understood the possible implication. “John, I am not sure that…”

The non-alcoholic beverage aisle of Tesco was deserted at 10 am but John still hurried to get everything Sherlock had sent him for. He already had six bottles of water and was now packing some bottles of Sprite into the caddy. (“At some point we will need the sugar, John.”)
Often, he ended up sweating and breathing hard with dots dancing in his vision. Just as he would notice the signs of panic, he could already feel Sherlock's hand on his chest and hear his deep voice murmuring the physical symptoms he had displayed. Sometime speaking, sometimes just thinking. It was Sherlock's way of reassuring him and, as far as John was concerned, it was the right way.
Only as he stepped out of the cool spray of the shower, Sherlock noticed that they hadn’t even said hello to each other. He toweled himself off, thinking about Beth’ judgment on the matter and the ideas she’d had. Surprisingly, her assessment was the same as his. Probably, he wasn’t that bad when it came to sentiment, after all.
“Oh god!” He moaned loudly when John entered him.
“Good. Good. I thought you probably…changed with being ill and all that…” John stated in relief while Sherlock weighed the box in his hands.
“And?”
On the 2
“John.” He sighs before kissing his neck while his arms close around John’s waist. He presses the length of his body against heated skin. It makes his senses tingle and he groans softly to answer the hitch in John’s breath. “John.” The name is barely a whisper on Sherlock's lips as he takes the sponge out of John's hand, letting it wander over his chest and stomach. The doctor's head falls back on his left shoulder, his eyes closed, the lips slightly parted and Sherlock is pleased by the possibility to watch the sponge glide over his golden skin. But much more pleased to see the which impact his proximity has on Johns hardening cock. He drags the sponge lower, over the pubic hair at first, but leading it still deeper - first over the right thigh then the left. John shivers under his assault but his eyes remain closed. Sherlock can feel his own arousal pressed against John’s bare back, just above the cleft of his arse. He drags his teeth over the doctor’s neck, biting carefully at his pulse point, sneaking his left hand to the hard length standing out proudly from the body in front of him. One slow stroke is rewarded with a rather obscene sound and a choked groan. “Sherlock. God, this is…Oh, fuck.” John thrusts unhurriedly into Sherlock's fist which makes his back rock against the detective's cock.  “Bed. Now?” The air around them is growing damper and Sherlock hasn’t actually showered but John's question is very welcome, anyway.
John's hand came up, unbidden. Sinking into the dark curls and tilting Sherlock's head downwards, just enough to let him feel the soft lips again.
“Can we… maybe not stop...this?” Sherlock grumbled still panting. John felt a small pang somewhere in his chest. If he remembered correctly the feeling was quite similar to happiness.
He demanded, angrily staring at his flat mate which immediately looked up at him. He knew what he would see on the back of the bra-clad upper body.
But he wasn’t in the mood for any games or further delays. John had an idea on what was going on and he would get it confirmed or not but he’d get the truth out of Sherlock.
He knew the way by heart, had seen every grave on the way a thousand times. He was observing everything he passed because he wasn’t able to face his destination. Not yet.
One month later, Prince Sebastian was found dead in his bed, a single coin lying on his chest. Rumors said that he had died from a broken heart after losing his beloved Prince Sherlock.
you.” John murmured into silky curls.
“I am going to use an oil that warms the muscles while they are being massaged. In order to maximise the blood circulation, it is best to keep the warmth in for as long as possible, so I will cover the relevant areas with blankets.” Sherlock replied pragmatically.
“Last time we started the massage with me on my back.” He whispered through a careful smile before pulling Sherlock closer by the arm. Their lips still knew what to do. Which was good because all of John's experience with men was of the theoretical kind and he did not know if Sherlock had more to draw from.
“I am sorry we kept you waiting, Mrs. Phillips. Please, sit down.” He gestured to the chair, closing the door behind the young woman. She wasn’t much taller than John when he’d first meet her but now they seemed to be of equal height. Sherlock watched her intensely while she took the few steps towards the chair. The Consulting Detective nodded at her when their eyes met but kept his face impassive. These things were always John’s area of expertise and by the way the woman curled in on herself as soon as she sat down, the Doctor knew that he didn’t have to use many words to make her understand.
“I just thought…” Sherlock whispered before stopping.
The first touch of Sherlock's hands on his forearms made goosebumps bloom all over his chest.
) doing nothing to diminish his increasing want.
Shaken, John threw his head around and looked at the men's target. The picture Sherlock had sent him affected his heart-rate in a not entirely unpleasant way. John realised what was happening the second he saw that Sherlock had his night vision back on.
“Yes!” Although, it wasn’t clear which question Sherlock had answered, John urgently entered the bathroom…
“Don’t worry you don’t have to. I can manage.”
“I wanted you for so long!” Sherlock stated with all the emotions he'd had to suppress for so long. It was all the confirmation John needed. He ran his hands over Sherlock's chest, savoring the feel of that pale soft skin under his fingers. Goosebumps, affecting John almost as much as Sherlock’s ragged breathing, spread over the milky torso.
As London lay silently, what had been washed deep into the earth by a sudden rain shower three weeks ago, was now fundamental to growth. Neither orange nor green plants were pushing upwards between cobblestones and broken cement. Blossoms falling onto sickly glowing leaves, their fruits grew in just a few hours into crooked versions of vegetable life.

“Yes, I’d like that.” Sherlock said equally hushed.
“Still processing?” He asked, softly teasing.
He has probably taken it too far. He doesn’t know. Uncertainty forces its way into his mind but he pushes it aside.
Right here in this moment, he realized that not being in control, not foreseeing the next touch/wriggle/thrust, was the real stimulus. Sherlock had a hard time not allowing his body to fall for John’s ministrations. This was only the beginning of a long cherished fantasy and he wouldn’t let his transport sabotage the real thing.
“And what about the dreams?” He asked with closed eyes.
Sherlock briefly considers sending John a picture of the dozen dismembered hands that are currently stored away in the freezer but he supposes now is not the time to be provocative. Take picture. Edit. Send.
“A natural defence mechanism, most likely.” Sherlock stated confidently. “I would have preferred to see it's whole body but I expect that it has no claws or other characteristics of a hunter. Herbivore or its complement in his food chain.” John looked at Greg who was watching the ruin nervously. “If we could only make it come out of it's corner so I could inspect it more closely...” Sherlock wondered absently.
“Boring!” Sherlock exclaimed in mock annoyance before grabbing his hand anyway and dragging him to the exit.
“Sherlock, what the hell is happening?” The doctor hovered awkwardly in the doorway between kitchen and living room.
John was painfully hard.
Without further ado, he shed his jacket and knelt down to free John first of one then of the second combat boot. The doctor still had his feet on the floor but now Sherlock had somehow managed to position himself between his legs. In an attempt at looking coy he watched John through his lashes while he let is hands wander up the soldier's thighs.
“So, is he dead?” Mrs. Phillips asked, keeping her gaze fixed on the floor, her voice controlled and even.
“Don’t go.” was all John managed to say.
John Watson apparently chose this special night to be a pain in the arse. Annoying, frustrating, irritating John. Sherlock sat up, leaning against his headboard before he considered an answer.
?” The doctor began to pace behind Sherlock.
Deliberately confident, he walked over to the cabinet checking for useful survival equipment.
The Alpha tuts. “Now, now, this isn’t the place for young lads such as yourself to dally. Do your Mum and Dad know you’re here?”
Lestrade, only slightly wounded by Watson’s criticism, coughs. “I believe the expression is a
Watson’s nostrils flare and the salty, wonderful scent of the sea gets stronger. “I don’t want to be with her.”
And Watson thankfully doesn’t need to be told, he positions Sherlock right so that he can slide a finger in, and they both groan when there is no resistance. Sherlock’s hole clenches hungrily around the first finger. Two more fingers later and he’s chanting Watson’s name, begging, groaning, desperate for more.
