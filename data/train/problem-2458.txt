“I think once I get the gear-box right that rattling sound will stop,” he’s telling Cas, who’s watching him work, intently. “Could be the cooling-system, too, but that’s fine too. I can fix that.”
A nurse leads John away, and Dean doesn’t look at him, doesn’t say anything to him. He doesn’t know what he would say, and he doesn’t want to hear what John has to say. A man in a dress shirt and carefully combed hair leads Sam and Dean into his office.
He doesn’t talk much on the way back to the manor. Talbot doesn’t seem to notice. He chatters away as usual without much input from Dean. And if Talbot, once or twice, throws the son of his old friend a worried look, Dean doesn’t notice.
Dean’s logged onto the bank, staring at the paid invoices, when the door to the office opens and Ricky says “fuck, holy shit.”
“I left you to pick up a mess, and I should have known you wouldn’t just abandon it– abandon dad. You’re too good for that. You’re too kind, and caring, and–
Dean stilled against him. His eyes shuttered. “Oh.” Then he was silent for several moments. Then he pulled back.
“Yeah,” Dean says, and tells her what a hell it had been, trying to replace some of the valves. He tries not to curse out Talbot too much. “Things take forever to ship here. It would have been faster to fly over and get them myself.”
“Our 30-day program,” he’s saying, locking his fingers together on the top of his desk, “is 11,000 dollars.”
Fear rushes him like adrenaline, and he’s rushing again, trying to urge, asking for something so that he doesn’t have to think, something that will ground him here, in this bed, in this place, something that will drown out that goddamn untethered-ness that’s trying to yank him up and out and pull his to pieces.
He’s at Taste Buds when it opens the next morning, standing outside the locked door at 7am. His head is pounding, and he can still taste vomit in the back of his throat, under all the toothpaste. The sun is already glaringly bright, and he chugs water out of a bucket-sized bottle Eames provided him with.
“I don’t know, I feel like I’m losing it. Talbot flew me out here but it’s like he doesn’t want me to work on the car? He keeps dragging me to events and refuses to pitch in with getting parts or contacting leads– He’s weird, his butler is weird, and, I don’t know, Cas is…” He trails off, pushing at a loose bolt with his wrench, just to hear it rattle.
Dean is trying to push back, tilt his hips, trying to get Cas deeper. “Harder,” he hears himself say, “Cas,
A little later she asks, “so when you going back to the States, then?” and Dean breathes through it until he feels loose and buzzed again.
Castiel was a widower. He pressed his lips against his ring, pushing so hard he could feel metal cutting into his teeth. No time at all. Not even time for a tan line to appear on either side of it. A young ring, a young marriage. In the grand scheme of things not even the length of a blink, an inconsequential dot in the map of the universe, their marriage was. And yet, and yet, and yet. He wasn’t crying. He couldn’t remember how. There was just that terrible pressure on his ribs, his lungs sucking in and pushing out oxygen, again and again when all it did was push on his organs and aching ribs and keep him alive, allow his body to keep working, the cogs to keep spinning, whilst Dean was still, he wasn’t supposed to ever be still and Cas wasn’t supposed to ever be a widower–
Then Cas is stepping aside, making room for him to pass through the doorway, and he steps through in a daze. He toes out of his shoes and follows Cas’ outstretched arm to the couch, where he sits, jacket bunched up around his shoulders and cold and wet against his neck and ears.
As he lies there, despite the aching in his skin, despite the churning in his gut and the wetness of his eyes, he thinks about Cas taking his hand, Cas’ fingers stroking along his wrist, and he falls asleep.
“Keep telling me about the Halloween party,” Dean insists, and they walk shoulder to shoulder through the park, on their way back towards the parking lot.
She walks over, hands in the pockets of her overalls. Without the loud music, Dean can more clearly tell she’s got a different accent than most people here, not that he could place it. Welsh maybe? Irish? He wouldn’t know how to tell. She’s wearing overalls and a tank top, her hair greasy and pulled back in a ponytail.
This countryside passes them in much the same way. Fields and houses and farms and a very lot of green. Some of the churning nausea is leaving his stomach now, soothed by the drink. He leans forward, elbows on the edge of the divider between driver and backseat.
Even here, naked and close and hard, Cas flushes, high on his cheeks. Dean wants to make him look that happy all the time.
All the while, the strange, sad man stood next to him, looking at Dean like he was waiting for something.
DEAN, I was talking to Sam since he got that virus on his computer and can’t afford to buy a new one AND he tells me you’ve met someone?? DUDE YOU HAVE TO TELL ME THESE THINGS. I need to know everything. Is he british?? Does he like Metallica?? Does HE have a smartphone?
“Right,” Dean says. “I’m going out, don’t let Talbot touch the car.” He hands the cup back. Eames looks so affronted by this that Dean, if he weren’t suffering from severe caffeine withdrawal, might have felt bad. Instead, he grabs the keys to a ’62 Imperial Crown off the wall, presses the button to open the garage, and gets the hell out of there.
He stops fiddling with the keys, and he sounds angry now, Dean thinks. He should be angry, but his face is still and expressionless.
Dean sits down on the couch. Sam’s face is red and his cheeks are wet, his eyes bloodshot and wide, and his mouth set in a stubborn line.
Dean took a hold of his cart and looked both ways down the aisle. It was a Sunday morning, there were barely any people around, an employee was sweeping the floor by the canned goods. "Are you here with someone?" he asked. He couldn't very well just leave him in the aisle of a Walmart when he looked like he might cry at any moment. The guy also didn't have a cart, nor was he holding so much as a packet of crisps; it seemed like he'd just wandered into the store and decided to stand next to Dean while he picked out his pasta. "Do you need me to call someone?"
Cas reaches out, and squeezes his shoulder, just once. His palm is cool and dry. “My therapist tells me I should share more,” he says, and heads to the car.
“I want to buy it,” Dean says, which makes Talbot look up. “I want to buy the Impala. How much do you want for it?”
Talbot looks at him then, surprise painting his face. Dean’s voice echoes slightly under the high ceiling. “Kid, I don’t know what–“
And suddenly he was sure. Dean must be dead. It was a moment of absolute clarity, sparking like electricity under his temple. In this very moment the doctor was putting the paddles back, sighing, wiping his forehead. The machine would still be on. One long, piercing sound the only thing still panicking in the room; the only thing saying
“Yeah,” he tries to say, but it’s just more air. He clears his throat, nods a little, kisses Cas’ bottom lip. He can’t think of why his head is spinning, why his hands feel clumsy and numb. Then Cas presses a hand against his chest and he realises his heart is pounding too hard, too fast.
When they’ve eaten, Cas sends him to sit on the couch, and does the dishes. Dean cradles his mug of lukewarm coffee and lets his eyes travel across the backs of the books, across the few photographs in frames, the little trinkets Cas has gathered around him.
Sam’s the one who makes the calls, both to the hospital and the rehab centre. He lumbers from room to room in Dean’s house, making breakfast and looking things up on his laptop and writing things down on sticky notes all over Dean’s kitchen table. He’s shaking, and he looks stressed and worried, has to stop to rub his temples and breathe. This is new to him, he’s not used to all that weight. Dean is too tired to feel guilty.
, and he looks pleased when Dean breaks, gets coffee in his nose, when he laughs. As if making someone laugh is a good thing, even when it’s not intentional.
“This might be a mistake,” Cas says, and Dean nods. He nods and nods, packing all his hurt away, as far down as it can go. “Dean,” Cas says.
“I don’t think he meant to,” Dean says, and wonders why he’s defending him. Habit, maybe. “He’s in rehab now. And he gave me the auto shop. I’m selling it,” he says, unaware of exactly when he made that decision, but insistent that Cas knows about all of it. “I don’t want it.”
“Don’t tell me you don’t.” Something else is in his voice now, something small. There’s no background clatter anymore, just Sam’s voice on the other end, “I’m the one you whispered them to when you couldn’t sleep at night.”
Swing music. The flowers tickled his nose and hung down over his food. The center pieces really were quite large. Happy people on the dance floor. Cold champagne. Castiel poked a small leaf away from his roast potatoes with a fork. It was non-edible, presumably. The groom laughed. Castiel snuck another glance off to the corner.
Cas lifts his hand, strokes his fingers across Dean’s forehead and into his hair. It’s so gentle, too gentle. It makes Dean shudder and ache, makes him feel turned inside out. He doesn’t need gentle, he has no use for gentle. He doesn’t deserve gentle.
He gets out of the car and opens the garage door. Then he gets back in, puts his arm over the back of the empty passenger sear, and backs out onto the gravel. He doesn’t close the garage door behind him.
"That, my boy,” he puts an arm around Dean and steers him towards the steps, “we can arrange. Eames! Take the gentleman’s luggage to his suite, thank you very much!”
“Say hi to Eileen for me.” He hangs up and sinks low into the plastic seat and settles in to wait, trying to ignore Sam’s voice ringing in his ears.
“So I gotta tell you something,” he says, and a shadow falls quickly over Cas’ face. It makes his stomach churn in a new way. “On the way back, yesterday, with Gabriel–“
“I’m not busy,” Cas says, but there’s still voices in the background, and he sounds stressed and tense. “I have to– I have to go, I’m sorry, Dean. Gabriel will help you.”
“He didn’t mean to, and I think he felt really bad about it. I’m not trying to throw him under the bus or anything, I just felt shitty knowing and not… saying anything. So. We can pretend this never happened, I won’t bring it up again.”
When he turned away from the shelf, pleased with this week's taglietelle, there was a man standing by his cart. He started and narrowed his eyes. The stranger looked unashamedly back at him. Dean slowly leaned down and placed the pasta in the cart, not looking away from the man who, incidentally, also did not look away from him.
He looked away and awkwardly scratched his neck, “well, I guess that explains why I came to my senses so suddenly,” he was noticing the bags on the ground and Cas knew that tightness of his shoulders, “and shit, you were just getting groceries weren’t you? And I full on frontal assaulted you. That’s not cool.” He bent and started shoving vegetables back into the plastic bag. Cas tried to imagine the confusion he must have been feeling, the stress of again and again having to face the very real consequences of that tiny little fault folded into his brain.
He sits there, hands on the wheel, engine rumbling and exhaust fumes sneaking in through the open window and tickling his nose, and he’s so goddamn lost.
"Yeah, well…" He made a vague gesture with his glass in the general direction of Sam, who seemed to be initiating a conga line.
Dean sighs, “I’m going to England for a job,” he starts, powering right through Sam’s incredulous repetition of
“Winchester and Son, yes? I was in the States a couple of years ago, completely busted my suspension in the middle of nowhere, completely out of American money… Your dad really stepped up.”
“Goodnight,” Dean says. Cas has a hand on the door knob, ready to close the door behind him. He’s having trouble getting his feet to move.
He didn't know what to say then. What did you say to your fiancé who you couldn't remember ever meeting? A person who stood next to you on the steps to City Hall, dressed to marry you, who knew what you had in your pocket, who knew things you'd never told anyone, who you had declared 'the most awesome', who was gorgeous, who was looking at you like you were the most important thing in the world and who was apparently willing to promise the rest of his life to a ridiculous mechanic who might and might not survive, and who forgot him. What did you say to that person?
Cas smiles down at him, “Meg-themed,” he says, and Dean wants to kiss him so bad. Instead, he just wraps his hand around Cas’ ankle and squeezes.
“Ugh,” Dean says, but wraps his free hand around Cas’ cold heel. “How does she know Meg?” he asks, “she wouldn’t tell me.”
No sense of urgency sets in, even when Cas rolls them over on their sides and hitches Dean’s leg high over his hip, or when he slicks his fingers up and opens Dean with steady movements. Dean gasps, and shivers, and presses their lips together. He can’t believe the wonder in Cas’ eyes, can’t believe the love there – but it’s there, and undeniable, it’s spoken and shared.
Dean tries to fit this story into what he knows, tries to reconcile this sad story, told in Cas’ low, serious voice, with the guy who keeps trying to sneak hard boiled sweets into his pockets when he’s not looking.
"Sam." Dean said. And it was like someone had turned the volume down; his own harsh breaths were only whispers to his ears, he could feel his heart beating in his chest but something was pressing over his head and it was getting hard to focus on Sam and he wasn't getting any oxygen, he could swear he wasn't getting any oxygen–
“I’m really sorry, Dean,” Joey says, sounding it, “it’s been a mess since you left, I just can’t deal with John anymore.”
“Yeah, yeah, but listen. The last five years all you’ve done is work in dad’s shop, pay dad’s bills, clean up his messes. This is gonna be the first time maybe ever that you’re away from him.”
He clenched his hands in the sheets. "This is so fucked up. I just lost three years of my life. In five minutes." A warm hand covered his. Cas looked at it as if he was as surprised as Dean at where his hand had ended up and tried to pull it back but Dean, surprising himself, turned his hand and took a firm hold of Cas' fingers. They felt nice against his, and he'd just lost three years of his life, and if he wanted to hold someone's hand he was damn well going to do just that.
"It's okay, Dean. I'm right here. I'm right here with you. We're going to figure this out. We're going to get you help. I promise."
Cas gets sick of him, mutters grumpily at him, pushes him down on the bed and holds his hands down and tries to make him shut his damn mouth.
He learns some things over subsequent visits to Taste Buds. First: don’t flirt with Meg the waitress, it’s a bad idea. Second, the American’s name is Castiel. He’s not told that, he just reads the name tag and no one corrects him when he starts using it. Thirdly, a guy named Gabriel owns the candy store next door. He keeps coming over to bother Castiel. Dean isn’t sure he likes Gabriel very much. He finds him unnerving, like if you turned your back for a second he might steal your wallet, or give you a wedgie.
“You don’t usually… talk about it.” Cas said it carefully. Wishing he was brave enough to do something, brave enough to even place a hand on his shoulder. But Dean was so frantic in his stillness. Something was thrumming under his skin and Cas was afraid to waken it.
“No, you’ve been sick sometimes.” Cas walked over, surprised that his knees weren’t creaking and his heels weren’t crushing the floor. He sat next to Dean. He stopped himself from leaning on him. “Most of the time, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with you.”
He banged his head against metal. Metal was very hard. The wrench had not ended up underneath the car, and now he had a headache. He rubbed his scalp as he looked up.
He ignored the prickling at the corners of his eyes. Stared at the curve of Dean’s cheekbone turned away from him. He tried to imagine something soft would meet him soon, “I know it’s hard–”
“Dean,” he says, and his voice breaks Dean’s heart. Then he’s being pulled back in, he’s being kissed, and kissed, and kissed, and then it’s over. Cas’ hands are gone. He turns away, and leans against the car again.
“I wonder how we’re meant to forgive our fathers,” Cas murmurs, but he’s staring out at the lake, not at Dean.
Sam is walking a half-step ahead of John across the parking lot. He’s taller than John too. This is the first time Dean has seen them in the same place since Sam left for college, a lanky teenager, and he’s struck by how old John looks. He’s thin and hunched over, and he’s walking weird, like he’s in pain. Sam looks furious. John looks furious too. Dean looks away. He doesn’t think he’s strong enough for their anger.
He stopped halfway up a staircase because he realised he had no idea why he was climbing it. Now, Dean wasn't a lazy person per se but he wasn't going to climb the steep ass stairs to City Hall when he had no reason to. He was pretty sure he didn't have a reason to.
Dean shakes the notebook in front of his face. The Impala is progressing, but he is quickly running out of things he can fix without supplies. He needs parts for the engine, the hydraulics system, the electrical. He needs connections, dealers. He needs, at the very least, a junk yard. He
“No, you dolt,” he said, “there was absolutely nothing wrong with it. I just can’t believe that’s how I gotta tell people we got engaged. Sam’s gonna fucking lose it.”
The coffee maker clicked off, and Cas filled their cups. He stopped in the doorway to the living room to watch. Just a second. A second for him to soak in what is as sunlight on his skin. Dean was on the couch, socked foot rapidly tapping against the carpet and he was humming something Cas didn’t recognise. The book he was reading was a gift. At first he hadn't like it, but yesterday he had called Cas and without even saying hello, started in on how Crowley was making terrible choices.
He laughed. They fell asleep tangled together like the vines in their garden. The room was silent, but they were supernovas.
“You’re goddamn right you didn’t.” Dean takes another pull from the bottle. What made him think he had the fucking right to–
“Yeah,” Dean says, and breathes through his mouth. “I’m back. Come on, let’s get you in the shower.” He helps John sit up, and steadies him when he sways, carefully leans his head on the back of the sofa. “Alright, now on your feet.”
“I think that’s what I am,” he says, and she hands him the last of the joint, which is very cool of her.
Cas hums in question but doesn’t respond further, which Dean thinks is undervaluing the threat level they could be under later tonight.
Some of those places have been soothed, by Sam’s voice, by the weight he took off of Dean and how ready he was to take it. By the knowledge that his father is sitting somewhere, face to face to what he did to himself, what he did to Dean, and that someone is watching him. That Dean can look away from him, can turn his body in a new direction.
“That’s true. He looks like our mother. I have two more brothers, and a sister. They’re all in America with our father. We don’t talk. My mother died when I was very young.”
Never again would he make Dean laugh. Never again would Dean make him feel young and silly and invincible. Pressure was pushing his ribs into his chest cavity. Could they break?
Sam leaned over Dean’s shoulder, “Well, you do write like a kindergartener. Cas, do we have crayons?”
At one pm, Ricky buys them both burgers, and asks Dean about England. Here, in the dingy little office with its blinds that can’t be rolled up anymore, the manor seems exaggerated in his mind, the little town and the rows and rows of expensive cars a bit excessive, like he’s telling this story for the hundredth time, at a party somewhere, and all the details have gotten a life of their own. He can’t grip them in his hands. It’s all coffee and hands and gears and blue eyes and dark skies. Every word out of his mouth sounds like a lie.
Sam doesn’t answer right away. “What’s going on Dean?” He says, finally, something like alarm in his voice.
“I can keep it open myself. By the time we have enough customers to require more hands we might be able to afford it.”
When Dean found him, he was still standing there, but he was holding the frame tight in his hands. Even now, with the lump in his throat and the way he felt too small to fit in this house, Dean walked in and everything felt like it made a little more sense. Like the chaos of atoms spinning through an infinite universe with no destination and no purpose could just for a second stop and say
Gabriel’s eyes are tracking him suspiciously, and Cas has turned around in his chair, looking after him with so much concern.
When Sam tries to make Dean talk about things, he makes his voice so carefully casual, so distractingly even. Cas just looks at him, stands close, and asks.
Dean dropped the wrench. Then he started shaking with silent laughter. He looked up at Cas, eyes shining, grin stretching his lips. He leaned his hands heavily on the car, and Cas was slightly distracted by his biceps again. Cas knew he was smiling too. He always smiled back at Dean. Summer had brought out a constellation of freckles across his skin, his hair was ruffled and damp, Cas had cut it yesterday. Dean usually did it himself with a pair of kitchen scissors. When Cas found out, he had gone out and bought a real pair. Last night Dean had sat on a stool in the bathroom, laughing more and more as Cas pressed his shoulders down, insisting that he sit still or he’d cut his ear off. On purpose. Then Cas was running his hands through Dean’s hair, lightly scratching his scalp, and Dean had let his head fall to the side with a groan. Things had deteriorated when Cas leaned down to press his lips to Dean’s collarbone, then his jaw, and Dean had sort of grabbed his neck a little and made sure Cas knew exactly where he wanted him. The scissors had clattered to the floor, forgotten.
“I could use a ride,” Cas says, quickly. “Tomorrow. Gabriel always takes me. I would reschedule, but there’s a fee, and–“
He drags his teeth over Cas’ bottom lip, pulls it in between his own, and Cas makes a low noise against him, grips him tighter, for just a moment. Then his hands become gentle, grasping at Dean’s arms, trying to hold him still. Dean doesn’t want to be still, he moves his hands to the bottom of Cas’ shirt, pushes it up, his palms against his stomach.
”Wait, wait, wait,” Dean laughed. He was pressing a hand against the center of Cas’ chest which was doing all sorts of things that made it difficult for him to remember what they had been talking about. ”You’re telling me you haven’t watched
Dean sits up, “yeah, he’s gonna change the fucking world, that kid. He got this girl too, Eileen, she’s incredible, and they’re absolutely gone for each other. Sam’s great, but that’s not the Winchester blood, believe me.”
“I don’t know,” Dean said. “I guess not. Dad opened the auto shop when I was seventeen, and by then I already knew everything he had to teach me, so. Kind of just made sense.”
She showed him through the glass doors and he saw Castiel out of the corner of his eye, one hand in a fist on his thigh, the other holding a phone to his ear.
“I know,” Dean nodded, “I don’t want to push you away. I know you– I know you’re here to stay. This is all just fucking with me–”
“What else would you call this?” Seething. Seething was a good word. “Refusing to speak to me, acting like any second what we have is going to end, what is that if not rejecting me? Doubting my feelings for you. Am I not sitting here outside of
He opens his eyes again when the car turns onto gravel. They’re making their way down an avenue lined with trees, at the end of which sits a massive, sprawling manor. It’s huge, ivy-covered grey stone and massive windows reflecting the dark sky. When they pass through the ornate steel gates and slowly turn around the circular driveway leading up to the front steps, he wonders if he’s ever seen anything like it outside of films. What the hell is he doing here? He doesn’t fit in to a place like this, he doesn’t even watch the kinds of films that take place in places like this. He certainly never watched Pride and Prejudice late one TV one night because he was drunk and a little sad and couldn’t find the remote.
The show turns out to be fairly enjoyable. Talbot, as it turns out, can be normal if he wants to. He talks about cars and engines more than he talks about Eames, he shakes peoples hands and laughs at their jokes. He even chews some tobacco. Dean feels like congratulating him.
Dean sits there until lunch, and Cas brings two quiches, and sits with him, and eats with him. Something big and strange and scary is ballooning in Dean’s chest.
The gate finally comes into view. The only empty spot to sit is next to a family of four. He switches his phone to the other ear and shoves his duffel bag under the seat with his foot.
“I don’t have a plan,” Dean says into Cas’ hair, “I spent all my money on dad’s rehab and plane tickets and I don’t even have a job, I have no idea what I’m gonna do next. I’m so fucking happy.”
. Best case scenario Dean lays himself out on the ground and Cas walks all over him. Worst case scenario Dean has to hurt him.
Cas doesn’t say anything. He just watches Dean stand at his door, on his thirty-second hour awake, wearing his dad’s old leather jacket, rain in his hair.
“I’ll wire you back the money you’ve paid me, and if you want more, I can look into that. I have savings, I–“
He doesn’t go to sleep. He wants to blame the time difference, but knows that’s a lie. Instead, he throws out all of his plants, puts his bedding in the laundry, and, as the sun sets on his little street, he mows the lawn.
“No, no, I got this.” He looks down at his wallet, and Talbot’s shiny black credit card sticking up out of one pocket. He sighs. “Is there an ATM somewhere close?”
It was a very unpleasant experience to wake up and be immediately blinded by the bright, white lights of a hospital room.
”You should go talk to him!” She said loudly. The music was at a very decent volume. She needn’t have raised her voice so much.
The grin slid off Dean’s face. Replaced by a look Cas couldn’t read. On the TV, the countdown started, and people started shushing each other. Sam giggled loudly from somewhere. Dean had been right, he really shouldn’t make his own drinks.
She bursts out laughing, and Dean feels stupid. “Bring him! I love that guy, when he goes–” she tucks her chin in and pushes her eyebrows together, adopting a low, gravely tone, “I don’t understand that reference.”
Cas shushes him. His fingers are pumping steadily faster, faster but stay so fucking gentle. So fucking kind. Then he presses them in deep and twists his hand a little and Dean
Dean gestures to Talbot’s foot, “that have anything to do with what you did to that poor car I’m here to fix?”
The first time they kissed they were in Dean’s car. And it was like they were in high school except Cas didn’t do things like this when he was in high school. He didn’t get dropped off home after a date, having held someone’s hand over the gear shift for the last half hour. He didn’t get guys – men – like Dean Winchester.
Cas takes a deep breath, and Dean worries. Then he moves his arm to slide up underneath Dean’s shirt to rest against his stomach.
The little old ladies with cars that broke down no matter how much you fixed them up made it quite clear that he was a hero to them, and there were worse things to be. Besides, there was nothing quite like the sound of a healthy engine, and knowing he fixed it.
“I’m not trying to–“ Sam says, “I know I nag. I just want you to do something for yourself. Try things. Enjoy things.”
Dean hasn’t heard him stand, or walk over. When Talbot’s hand lands on his shoulder, he flinches, and it falls away.
He wakes up to several texts from Sam. He showers first, shaves, gets dressed. In the mirror, he looks tan and worried and old. He avoids his own eyes.
and he means tonight, Dean knows he means tonight. Will you sleep here, with me, is what Cas wants to know but it’s not what Dean hears.
"Dean!" And that was Sam's voice. Sam was standing in the doorway holding two take-away cups, looking scared and worried and–
When Cas comes over, Dean talks too loudly, it sounds fake even to him, but Cas doesn’t say anything, because Cas doesn’t push. Cas doesn’t poke and prod and invade and make Dean look at all the gross, hateful parts of himself. Cas just refills his coffee for free and squeezes the back of his neck with his hand.
“Dude, no,” Dean hurries, “I mean, shit. You don’t have to tell me shit. Not that you can’t tell me shit, I mean.” He puts his face close to his cup, “Nope, no questions.”
His phone rings, and he answers it without looking, shouldering a stool out of his way so he can reach across to the break lines, “It’s Dean,” he says, putting his phone between his shoulder and his ear.
“Yeah, right.” Sam is getting that harsh note in his voice that Dean hates, the one he only gets when they’re talking about John, that makes Dean feel gross and guilty and ashamed. “He hasn’t done real work with that shop for years and you know it. The only reason he’s in business is because you work your fingers raw on the cars
(I want to be myself. I don’t want to become someone less than that. If I do… If they mess up and something goes wrong–
(Dean was drinking coffee out of his Pendleton National Park-mug and reading the newspaper like he wasn’t sliding one socked foot further and further up Cas’ leg.)
Cas leads them down a trail to a lake, and sits on a bench by a tree. Dean sits next to him, glancing at him out of the corner of his eye.
It’s stuffy and warm in there, wax candles spread out on the tables and along shelves. As soon as they step inside, a short, skinny guy with brown hair starts towards them, eyes fixed on Cas, arms stretched out and brandishing a beer bottle.
“I don’t really need to get around right now, anyway,” he tells Sam. “The Impala should get here before the end of September.”
Cas nods. He starts to get out of the car, and Dean wants to kick himself. Quickly, he reaches out and grabs Cas’ arm. Cas turns to look at him, one foot out the door.
Dean tries to figure out how he feels about that, attempts an internal inventory of emotions to see if anything wants to guide him to a decision, wants to tell him what the right thing to do is.
“It’s okay,” he tells Dean, but it isn’t, “you don’t have to explain.” His hand slides down to press against Dean’s chest, and the way Dean’s heart is hammering must be so clear to him.
Cas goes to Sam’s house. The door opens before he can knock and Sam looks scared. He invites Cas in without saying anything. Sits him down on the couch, presses coffee into his hands, collapses in the armchair across the little table, without saying anything. Then he sighs, heavily.
Sam’s answer is a little too soft, but it doesn’t hurt like it usually does. “That’s great, Dean. I’m really happy.”
“Cas,” Dean’s voice was strangled, but his fingertips were pressing into Cas’ scalp and he was stroking Cas’ elbow with his other hand, “You’re going to be okay, because you have to be. You have to be okay for me–”
“Can’t you paint around me?” Cas lifts himself up by the back of the driver seat to look at him through the windshield. “I’m comfortable.”
He looks up when Cas drapes a blanket over his shoulders and gently steers him towards the kitchen door.
Dean glares at him, wishing he was actually annoyed. “Tell him you’re an annoying barista I know who doesn’t know how to respect personal property.”
Cas is visible through the glass windows, counting money at the till. Dean loves watching him like this: his measured, calm movements, the line between his eyebrows deepening ever more. He always wears button downs, and they never sit right on him. They’re always rumbled and lopsided, the collar bent wrong, or there’s a button missing over his chest.
In the garage, Talbot stands leaning against a 1960 Cadillac, Series 75. It’s sleek and shiny, polished within an inch of its life.
“What is that?” Dean asks. He’s potting his new plants at the kitchen table, but stops to wash his hands when Sam looms in the doorway.
When he comes back to the restaurant, Cas is making small talk with the teenager, who’s looking up at him with wide, starry eyes.
fingers through it –, but he stood very straight and very still, so silent it seemed like he was barely breathing. Calm, collected, in control, boring things like that.
” The smile dropped as quickly as the stone lodged in his stomach. He let go of the bags and grabbed at Dean because Dean was right there suddenly, frantic hands shaking against his neck and waist.
Dean paints the Impala four times. In between coats, while the layers dry, he lies next to Cas on the grass and watches the sky, waiting for any hint of cloud. The sky stays clear and blue.
He drives to the manor in a daze, parks the Impala in the garage and leaves the keys on the dashboard. Fifteen minutes later, he’s packed, and his duffel bag hangs across his shoulders, weighing almost nothing. Cas had still been asleep when Dean left and he hadn’t turned back to look at him. The moment he’d woken up he’d started moving. He didn’t stop for coffee or food, he just walked out, avoided his own eyes in the elevator mirror, in the rearview mirror.
Dean presses his eyes shut but doesn’t turn his face away. Cas can see the tears, Cas kisses his cheeks where they fall.
“I enjoyed this, Dean,” he says. “I would like to come with you next time you go to purchase car parts.”
“I mean I knew Talbot was loaded, but seriously?” He adds, scanning the man up and down: late fifties, long faced, wearing
Inside, the floor is covered in newspapers, magazines and envelopes. The door pushes them up against the wall, bending the papers. He picks them up and stands in his tiny kitchen, throwing away ads and expired grocery store coupons. All of his house plants are dead.
“I’ve been trying to keep my nose out, I have, but…” He looks guilty, and sympathetic, and Dean thinks he knows what’s coming. “I’ve been opening the post, and sending invoices, you’re not doing so great.”
“You’re amazing,” Cas tells him, voice hoarse, as he leans over Dean, supports the lift of Dean’s hip with his hand, and pushes into him.
“I just left. I didn’t even say goodbye. How shitty is that? I snuck out like a bad lay.” Dean is feeling delirious. Like he’s drunk again, like he’s high. “It’s worse because I think he loves me back. It felt like he did, when we were together. He was so– and if he didn’t, if that wasn’t love, I don’t think I can stand love. ’Cause that was… it feels impossible. It should be, right? He’s there and I’m here and if he doesn’t hate me now I don’t think I can be with him ’cause that’s some really shitty judgement on his part, right? I can’t be with someone who won’t protect themselves. God knows I’ll take advantage of it.”
"You are not going to be stuck in the garage all day, you are coming to eat breakfast, and you are going to enjoy it. Eames made eggs.”
He dropped out of high school in junior year. John nodded silently when he told him. He moved into his own place as soon as he turned eighteen, and John didn’t put up a fight. He was already at the auto shop working full time. His name was on the building, and Dean liked it. There was some monument to his work, some proof to his existence.
“Everywhere. He saw everything worth seeing. And when he heard we had gone to America, he came back here. Stayed with our aunt and uncle, who are more forgiving of difference.”
The world was sun-warm and green, Dean’s fingers were rough and dirty, his eyes crinkled at the corners.
It’s a small lake, sheltered by trees along the edges, but the sun beats down on the water, and glittering lights scatter across the surface.
At four am he falls asleep on his leather couch. Three hours later, he wipes the whiskey off the floor, downs the last drops at the bottom of the bottle, and makes himself a pot of coffee. It’s bitter and stale and burnt, and he pours it all down the kitchen sink. Then he stands leaning over it, his ragged, panicked breathing filling the empty, quiet house until all the corners are soaked in it.
I need you to know. You’ve been doing everything, you’ve been the one saying things, and you’ve been here when you didn’t have to, and you’ve made me laugh, and you bought me a tree, and you
”Okay… Okay, okay–” Mumbled, and almost rambled, but clear and promising and warm. Then a third finger is pressing into him and Dean gasps out and pushes back but they are gone just as quick.
The cute little flower shop across the road from Taste Buds is moving and the space is up for rent, that’s what catches his eye.
Cas moved into him. He wrapped his arms around Dean’s bare back, pushed gently until they fell back on the mattress, kissed his shoulder, pulled the covers over them. He tangled their legs together. There was close enough, and there was too far away. This was almost close enough.
Dean goes and gets a bucket from the kitchen, positions John leaning over it, pries his jaw open, and sticks his fingers as far as he can reach down into his throat. He holds John’s head and shoulders still while he vomits, and when he seems to be fading out again, he shakes him.
we had decided to meet. Then, he saw Jess’ ring one day and got all loud and chewed me out for not telling him we’d gotten engaged. That was two weeks before the wedding. I– I thought he was joking, that it was a bit or something–” He buried his head in his hands. “I should have realised. I’ve been trying to convince myself it’s nothing but the second you called it all came rushing back. He would never forget you, Cas. Never.” Sam looked up at him. “Something’s wrong.”
“She knows it’s August, right?” Dean asks Cas, holding the ladder steady as Cas affixes fake cobwebs to the ceiling. Dean is mostly speaking so that he won’t stare as Cas’ ass.
Then puts his lips against Cas’ collar bones, his chest, sinking to his knees, hands clinging to Cas’ sides like he’s the only thing keeping Dean tied to the earth and it feels that way, like if he didn’t hold on he would just fall–
Cas doesn’t see him until he’s halfway to the door, tying an apron around his waist. He looks up and stops, blinking at Dean through the glass door. Dean waves weakly.
“I’m a shitty person, who does shitty things to the people he loves, and fucks up even when he tries not to.”
Cas’ favourite cereal was in the kitchen. He had a toothbrush in the bathroom upstairs. He slept here, he kept work clothes here, Dean was trying to make him do laundry, weren’t they already both living here? In all the ways that counted, this was home. He could bring it up. He could just… ask.
fine, a bit of a headache maybe but he'd just been blinded, it was only reasonable. He shouldn't be here. He had fallen asleep in his own bed, in his own room, he was
For a moment, Cas does nothing, then he reaches up and rests his hand on top of Dean’s, holding it tight for a long moment.
The sky is an azure blue, the sun beating down on him, the Mustang, and his map. The new exhaust manifold is lying in the back-seat, and Dean is lost. He must have taken a wrong turn somewhere, but nothing on any road signs matches anything he can find on the map. He’s sweaty, he’s thirsty, and he’s pretty sure the signs aren’t in English.
He opens his messages with Cas on his phone, scrolling back slowly. There’s very little of substance there, except it’s all substance, all references to meeting places, negotiations of times: the sort of messages shared between people who didn’t have to worry about distance or time or expectations.
“Oh, shut up,” Ricky says, “I’m happy to help you out. John been… John. He was being a real bitch about me coming in, I’ll tell you, but I haven’t seen him yet this week, so it’s been quiet.”
Eames rounds the corner with a tray of sandwiches, and Dean sinks down in a maroon leather armchair. Talbot sits in the one next to him, lifting his cast up on a matching foot rest, and pours Dean a glass of something golden. Eames places the tray between them, and quickly leaves again.
“Ugh, I’m too old for this shit,” he says, but takes the joint when she offers it. “Also,” he adds, “don’t do drugs.”
Dean shuffles over on the couch and lifts his arm. “Come on,” he says, and Cas dips against him, pushing his face into Dean’s neck and slowly snaking his arm around Dean’s middle. Dean presses his nose into Cas’ hair and breathes deeply. Coffee, and sugar, and just a little bit of lemon.
His husband was scared and reaching for him and he couldn’t move an inch. He couldn’t believe he’d forgotten; forgotten that stars burn. Stars die. The world wasn’t actually shaking, he was just shaking his head.
Dean looks down at himself. His jeans are freshly cleaned but oil-stained, and his duffel suddenly looked grimy and sad, sunken in on itself. He shrugs, his leather jacket creaking. “This is all I got.”
At 10am Dean drives the Impala past Taste Buds, takes a right, and then a left up to Barnett Wood Lane, where he slows to a crawl, scanning the small detached houses. Around a bend in the road, a cluster of cars are congregated, people milling around in twos or threes in the yard.
“What are you writing? Dude! What are you writing?” Dean cranes his neck to try to see. Cas puts his hand on the back of Dean’s neck and turns his head forward. Dean almost swerves the car off the road.
Dean hurries around the corner, sidestepping the girl with the dog, on her way from the park, and spots the ATM right away. He feeds it his American Express, bouncing lightly on his heels while it thinks. Then he freezes. His total balance is displayed on the screen, right above the exchange rate. He looks over his shoulder, then back at the screen.
He jerked upright, blinking furiously. There was a sharp tug in the crook of his arm and his fingers started scrabbling with the IV before the room had even sharpened into view.
A man wearing dress pants and a blazer under a beige trench coat stood a few steps over him, looking concerned.
Watching the staff and patrons of Taste Buds is a small change of pace, a nice sometime break from the manor. Talbot, much like Sam, thinks he doesn’t get out enough, and has taken it upon himself to drag Dean away from work if he thinks he’s been down there for too long. Regular trips into town allows Dean to work the rest of the day, uninterrupted. The longer he stays, the more uninterrupted work hours he gets.
Ten minutes went past in silence. Castiel now and then opened his mouth as if to speak, looking troubled, but never actually said anything. Then a nurse called Dean's name.
Cas wipes his mouth with a napkin. It’s barely more than a hole-in-the-wall, but there’s high seats along the windows, and they sit facing a park in the late afternoon light. It’s finally stopped raining, and the sun shines on the wet grass, where a girl is playing fetch with a small dog.
“I love you,” they were the only words he could press into Dean’s skin with his lips. Tiny, insufficient, all he had. “I love you, I love you, I–”)
Dean tries not to laugh, he does, it’s shitty to laugh when someone’s just telling you things they think, but Cas is
Sam stares at him, says “are you serious? That’s– Dean that’s our car!” and Dean smiles for the first time in what feels like a very long time.
“Yeah?” Dean says, “well, it’s why I’m here.” He unscrews and lifts the tires off to get a better reach for the suspension.
Dean logs onto his email again, and stares at the neat little row of unread emails. He clicks on “new email” and types in the email address of a Steven Hardy from Andover who’s recently been active on a forum about American muscle cars.
“When did you get home?” Dean asked. His casual tone had no place here. It jarred the stillness of the room.
Hot, ugly guilt crawls its way towards his diaphragm. He tries to push it down, tries to ward it off with the lingering warmth on his skin where Cas has touched him. It doesn’t work. A hand is wrapping tight around his spine and he can’t move. He wonders what the hell he’s doing here if he’s not doing his job, doing his goddamn duty. So he lies, and breathes, reminds himself that the car is being put-back-together, that he has worked hard for weeks and months. He tries not to be consumed. When he can’t lie there anymore, he picks up the whiskey bottle he’s hidden underneath his mattress, he creeps through the silent house down to the garage, and pops the hood.
Dean makes a non-committal noise. He’s sweating under his collar. A voice so like Sam’s is whispering in his ear, prodding at him insistently. ’You fixed that car,’ it says. ’He ran out of liquor and disappeared for two weeks, Dean. He never even looked at that car.’ and then ’you had a bruise on your shoulder for a week where that bottle hit you, Dean.’
After all that time and energy Dean put into messing with him over cake tasting, he couldn't dream of getting away with spending five minutes inspecting different kinds of pasta.
“Some of my professors are being really understanding,” he says, “but I have to go back and start sucking up to the ones that aren’t.”
“I’m serious! You don’t. Look at your life for a second. You raised me for like fifteen years, you took care of dad for over twenty years, following him around the country making sure he didn’t end up dead in a ditch somewhere. You work at the same place you have since high school and you have the same friends you made when you were fourteen. You commit like crazy. You can’t
“I am,” he insists. “I just–“ He doesn’t know how to finish, but Cas just waits. “I don’t know when he stopped needing me, I guess.”
Their clothes fall off fast. Dean is tired, from the last few weeks, from the plane ride, from not sleeping, and everywhere he’s aching Cas’ hands find their way, firm and warm. Dean smoothes out Cas’ hair with his hands, stroking it away from his temples, pressing his nose there and breathing Cas in, like sweet coffee.
He’s spent a lot of time looking at the shapes of Cas’ face, the shadow of stubble, the serious turn of his mouth, the hint of a dimple in his chin. Yet it’s such a different thing, touching him. Dean touches his nose to Cas’ cheekbone, just for a second, just to feel him there, and then they’re kissing. Cas hand is on his hip, and Dean is pressing the tips of his fingers into the back of Cas’ neck, that soft, vulnerable spot, and their lips come together once, twice – Cas is turning into him, seamlessly, and before Dean knows it, he’s not leaning against the car anymore, he’s standing, pressed against Castiel, holding on to him, and Cas is pressing right back.
Dean can’t breathe. He can tell, in some remote, unimportant part of his mind, that he is being too loud. He’s embarrassing himself, gasping for air like this – it’s too close to a sob, and inch, a push, a kiss away from turning into a sob – but Cas just slides his nose along Dean’s knee, pushes and folds his leg up, murmurs something into Dean’s thigh.
“I wanted you to,” Dean says, pressing the heels of his hands to his eyes. “I was glad to stay, so you could leave.”
“Yeah, it’s– He bought it off the impound lot, turns out. Offered dad to buy it back off him but he refused, so.”
He glanced out across the Canyon. The sun was resting on the creeks and crevices and the other end was so unfathomable far away it might as well have been resting on the surface of the sun. It was an infinity encased in rock.
Dean wants Cas to write his own name. To leave marks on his skin that can never go away. He wants this bed and this man, and Dean’s fingers fit so well right there in the groove below Cas’ hipbone, he fits fits fits right here–
The cards bent under his clenching fingers. That was a secret, not even Sam knew that. He flipped to the next one.
“I don’t really know how to…” Dean starts, the rest of the words stacking over each other at the back of his throat until nothing can come out.
He looks over at Meg, who is looking at him with deep disappointment in her eyes, shaking her head slowly as she plates a cheesecake.
Between the seats, a compartment opens to reveal several whiskey glasses, a bottle on ice, and a bowl of peanuts.
He did. The man looking back had short dark hair and blue eyes. Several day's stubble covered his jaw and chin, a bruise was fading to yellow on his cheekbone, and his eyes looked blood-shot and sunken. He looked terrible and he wasn't wearing scrubs or a white coat and Dean had no idea who he was. He yanked his hands out of the man's grip and suddenly they came easily.
He moves on. The living room is sparsely decorated, but has a nice wooden ceiling. The midday sun falls across the floor in an almost reddish hue.
“Yup,” he says. Then he says, “ever feel like you trick people into liking you?” and a part of his brain goes
Dean looks up, and Cas’ right hand is covering his mouth, his eyes fixed on Dean’s face. Dean reaches up and pulls Cas’ hand down, tangles their fingers together. Then he opens Cas’ pants the rest of the way and yanks them down firmly.
For a year, Sam has tried to get him to buy an iPhone. Or, “if you don’t want to conform to societal pressure, some other brand, just please join us in this century.” Dean doesn’t want a smartphone. He wants readable maps, not built in GPS-systems that probably tracks him wherever he goes.
Cas was just getting more coffee. Outside the window Dean’s garden was a tousled kaleidoscope of vines and flowers, hedges allowed overgrown. The little table where they’d discussed the meaning of names. Red, blue, lilac. Soft.
He wonders if Cas would get it. Would he be able to see beyond the dirt and the dents, recognise the potential of this car? Find something beautiful in the process, the painstaking, slow work, and not just in the finished product.
“I missed you,” he says, and Dean says it back, under his breath and like a chant every time Cas thrusts into him. A static sound is starting in his ears. He puts both hands on Cas’ ass and pulls at every thrust, lifting his hips and much as he can to get him closer but he’s also saying “wait, wait, wait–“ because he’s not ready for it to be over.
Dean taps his fingers against the floor, “not as bad as I feared, I guess. The left side doors are all messed up, and she was definitely on fire for a little bit. But the interior is salvageable. It’s gonna take a fuckton of parts and a small fortune but… I can fix her.”
, Cas is leaning over him, leaning down, crowding close and pressing them together as so much skin so much warmth. He wants this forever. He hates how he’s wrapping himself around Cas, desperate and childish and so goddamn selfish, but Cas is shaking too, just a little, clinging just a little too hard, and it’s the only thing Dean can think of. No one has ever wanted him like this. He has never wanted like this.
“Of course,” Sam says, and then he does pull back, and he wipes his eyes a little bit, “I promise I’ll bug you about everything.”
In the rearview mirror, Dean sees that John is furious, but he doesn’t try to argue again. Part of him is impressed. He could never shut John up like that. Then again, Sam always stood up to him, he was never scared of him.
At least Sam's voice was the same, he thought to himself. He lost three years of his life but Sam was right here, and if he just didn't look at him he sounded the same and Dean could happily pretend that everything was normal, if he just looked down at his–
Dean pulls him close to his chest and breathes, lets the aches and pains settle in his body again, welcoming them as proof that he got here, that Cas welcomed him home.
“What? No! What? Sam!” He feels hot and sweaty and he regrets calling. “Never mind, ignore me, what’s up with you, how’s school?”
“That’s not how this works, Sam,” Dean gets up and goes into the kitchen, “I can’t just abandon ship. It’s my shit to deal with.” He takes a beer out of the fridge and opens it, steps back into the living room.
“That’s what they say,” he mutters, side-eyeing the horizon. “When I start, I’m gonna need you out of the car, you know,” he adds, loud enough for Cas.
“I don’t know what I can offer him,” Dean says, and again words are just coming out of his mouth against his will, before he has time to think them over and make decisions about them, “I clearly have commitment issues, that’s not gonna go away because I love him.”
Cas calls him late on a Tuesday night. He’s stepping out of the bathroom, towelling his hair, and notices his phone light up where it lies, charging, on the bedside table. He throws the towel back into the en-suite, but the phone has gone quiet before he picks it up.
Meg groans, long and loud, “Please spare me,” she says, “It’s in two weeks, here at Taste Buds. If you don’t show up I’ll murder you and put you in my pies.”
Sam had been quiet for a long time, and Dean thought he’d fallen asleep, but then he said “cheetahs can run this fast.”
Cas is soft and rumpled and so very, very naked. It’s a sight Dean’s not used to. It’s a new one. Dean knows Cas is smaller than him, that his chest is narrower though they are almost exactly the same height, but it’s something else to see his bare hip leaning against the counter, his flat stomach moving a little when he talks, or laughs. His shoulders shifting and his collar bones protruding when he shrugs. It makes Dean’s head spin.
"You too." Dean raised a hand. That was one attractive man in one terrible car. He shook his head and turned back to the Mustang.
She nods, “tell me about it. I’ve got a Model A, you know, 1928 Ford, I cannot tell you what a bitch it’s been– Been working on it for near six years now, and it’s still nowhere near running.”
“Dad tells me you’re fixing up a car over at the manor?” She says, “A sixties Chevy right? I’m a Mustang girl, myself.”
“Gabriel has been having trouble with his suppliers, there’s been inconsistencies and the drivers blame the factory and the factory blames the driver and– it doesn’t matter. He needs to go into London tomorrow to sort it out and…” He trails off.
For a while, when Sam was little, he drew on everything, on every surface he could reach. They were all of the three of them, John, and Dean, and Sam, awkwardly stick-legged and with smiles so big they didn’t fit on their faces, so they went outside the lines a little. As if the happiness was leaking out.
He follows the signs towards Leatherhead. The Chrysler’s gear shift sticks in two places, which Dean makes a note to fix at some point. He doesn’t notice he’s driving on the wrong side of the road until he meets a Honda driving the other way. He swears loudly to himself, waving apologetically out the window. Sam would kill him if he were here.
. No such luck. Sam got engaged to a fire cracker of a woman and then hyperventilated for four months while planning the ceremony, and who did he come to complain to when the chair cover-people sent him saffron instead of mikado yellow? Dean, that's who.
“They offered me a job at Popular Mechanics, and the pay isn’t that much better but… well, no one’s gonna be throwing bottles.”
“Okay,” Talbot says, and picks a chair for himself by the poker table. “Okay,” he says again. “I’m gonna pay John, the price we agreed on over the phone. The money on your account is for you.”
Dean shakes his head, “it’s fucking incredible, like she hasn’t aged a day. I mean, she’s still looking pretty rough, but I think I can do the first round of priming next week, so.”
“Seriously, I’m sick of talking about me, tell me what’s happening over there. Just, some normal shit, please.”
Dean stopped rubbing his head and stood up. "Yes, hello, sorry about that, didn't hear your car." He took a rag from his pocket and started wiping his hands, "welcome to Singer and sons, how may I help you today?" He flashed a smile.
Mrs. Ridgley had started jabbering about a conga line, so Castiel had put on his best smile for charming old ladies and said, ”actually, I’m going to need Dean for some urgent wedding business. There has been a slight inconvenience with the band. I do hope that’s not too much trouble.”
It’s full of people. He should have known better than to come at lunch time. But his usual seat is there, empty, waiting for him. Meg looks up when he comes through the door, and gives him the finger in greeting. Then Cas comes out from the kitchen, and stops in his tracks. The second he sees Dean, a wide smile breaks out across his face, and Dean’s heart skips a beat.
Dean grinned, “That’s very specific. And inappropriate.” But they kissed. Then leaned shoulder to shoulder and watched the patient synergism of light and shadow.
“Yeah, and once he’s sober, he can deal with it. Until then, I gotta do it.” He lifts the beer to his mouth, and it smells like John’s apartment, like vomit and sickness.
This particular guest didn't seem the dancing type. He was, after all, standing in a corner with the best man, rather than joining in.
He presses a plastic tray to Dean’s chest, then turns back to the still-growing line, already taking orders.
Cas says, voice rougher than ever. It’s almost a question, lingering on the edge of a plea. He presses his face into Dean’s neck, holds him tight, nearly tight enough.
“Well, I tried to get a hold of his insurance, but– anyway, we can pay the first three thousand upfront, and after that–“
“It’s fine, it’s just paperwork. When dad gets out again, we–“ Dean runs out of words. “I can ask Charlie for help with marketing stuff, she knows people. I can get back into the good graces of the community. I can make it work.”
“I had to see for myself,” Talbot says again. “I know you think there isn’t a lot to you,” he continues, with no regard for the bile rising in Dean’s throat. “But you’re wrong. You deserve that money for the work you’re doing here. It’s yours. I’m not taking it back. And I’ll always have work for you, if you want to do something else.”
Sam flicks him on the forehead again. “Dude, you raised me better than that! If you fuck something up, you fix it. You gotta stop thinking you’re doomed to fail, Dean, you’re not dad!”
The longer the silence rests, the stupider Dean’s answer starts to sound in his own head. As if he didn’t care either way.
”I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Castiel answered. He took another sip of champagne and tried not to look towards the corner.
At Heathrow, Dean has to sit with his head between his knees for a couple of long minutes, leaning against an unassuming brick wall next to an ad about taxi-services. Around him, people rush towards baggage claim. Dean doesn’t have any baggage to claim, he just has his duffel. A couple of changes of clothes, his phone charger, a couple of paperbacks. It’s almost everything he owns.
Dean nods. Cas’ hair looks worse than it did hours ago, standing up in all directions, and his shoulders are tense and concave. He looks haggard, and upset.
Walsh looks taken aback. “Guess so, huh? Well, after your dad got his hands on it, I never had a problem again.”
He turns away before Cas can see him flush. “Thanks.” He opens the driver side door. “Help me get her out of here?”
Cas leaned forward, almost conspiratorially, and put on a posh accent, “’It’s not quite what I had in mind.’ Can you believe it?”
That night, he’d shared that feeling with Sam, where they lay in the backseat watching the street lights pass. Sam had wondered, innocently, if magic was real and Dean thought for a long time and then he said that people often didn’t understand magic. People thought it was an unexplainable thing that only existed in other worlds, but they were wrong, because magic surrounded them all the time.
He gets placed on a stool by the island in the modest little stainless steel kitchen. Cas hands him a towel, which he uses to dry his face and scrub at his hair. When he looks up, Cas is watching him. Then he turns around and pulls a put out of a cabinet.
“It’s too much for one person,” Ricky continues, gathering steam, “especially when the other one is… well.”
“Whatever he said,” Cas interrupts him, voice insistent and eyes flicking back and forth between Dean’s face and the table, “he doesn’t know what he’s talking about. If he made you uncomfortable, or insinuated anything that– that you don’t–“
“Come with me, I have an idea.” Cas took his hand and pulled him towards the house. Dean’s hand was steady and warm in his.
“Hey, no,” Cas says into his shoulder, kisses into his skin like he’s made of something shiny and fragile and admirable, something you want to run your lips over again and again– “No,” he whispers, and pulls their fingers out. He grabs Dean’s hand and presses it into the sheets next to his head, helps his fingers curl around the fabric.
His voice is so very small then. Too small to fit under high ceilings and in a broad chest cavity. “I think I might know what this is about.”
“I– Yes, sir.” He steps back from the Camaro, and looks over at the Impala, sitting innocently by the wall.
In the middle of the night, they wake up and stumble out of bed. Dean’s legs are shaky and from the way Cas giggles and steadies himself against the dresser, so is his. They go into the kitchen, awkwardly holding on to each other the whole way, the whole goddamn fifteen feet and stand, stark naked by the counter where Cas’ shirt still lies abandoned, eating cold leftover pasta from two nights ago out of the little glass containers Cas has for leftovers instead of plastic tupperware because “plastic is really bad for the environment, Dean.”
“You met my dad,” she says, grinning. Then, when Dean looks confused, louder: “you met my dad at a car show back in June. I’m Katie, Katie Walsh.”
Three hours later, he’s standing on the welcome mat of Taste Buds, which he hasn’t realised until now reads “oh no, it’s you again”. It seems like a strange thing to write on a welcome mat. Half-heartedly, he tries to wipe his feet on it, but it doesn’t make him any drier.
The man inhaled sharply and took an abrupt step back, and he didn't look like he was waiting for something anymore, he looked like he had been sucker punched in the stomach.
“I don’t really know how shipping cars across the ocean works, but I figured you’ve done it before, Jimmy, so if you could organise that? You can send me the bill, obviously.”
Sam crossed the room in two long strides, put the coffees on the bed-side table and then he clasped Dean's shoulders in his hands. The other man abruptly let go of him.
Cas is already in the kitchen, making coffee. His head is bowed and the back of his neck looks pale and bare over the collar of his t-shirt. Dean wants to place his hand there, just to cover him up, just in case.
that you don’t know that loving you has nothing to do with what you’ve done for me. Loving you is… not circumstantial. It would have happened anyway. It was always gonna happen. I love you in every version of myself, in every… alternate fucking universe there is. Sick, healthy… in a post apocalyptic world run by machines– I love you–”
Talbot starts to hobble down the stairs, and Eames moves quickly to his side, trying to stabilise him.
His voice sounds normal, he notes, when he tells Talbot he’ll miss him too, and thank you, and yeah, sure, he’ll email every now and again. Then he sits in the back of the Pullman with his duffel next to him and listens to the gravel turn to asphalt.
"It sounded very heartfelt." The man commented. His voice was far deeper than his face would have anyone believe, and Dean definitely blamed the champagne for the warmth in his stomach.
Sam nods, a little too quickly, and picks up his phone. Dean sees the notes-app open, and a long list of numbers.
“That’s just not good enough,” he says, “I’m here to do a job, and if you’re not gonna let me do it, then we’re gonna have a problem–“
Talbot aims a thumb in the general direction Eames left in, “you spend ten years with that guy and then tell me what your defence mechanism is.”
“Apparently they don’t even have the remote, it’s locked up somewhere. I tried to tell them people didn’t need to be watching people dying in a hospital show while their loved ones were–”
“I would give you anything. I would do anything for you.” He was hurrying. He wanted to get it all out before the countdown ends. He was not sure why. But his heart was clenching painfully and Dean was staring at him and the room was somewhere else and– “No matter what happens, in health or– or sickness–”
“It’s okay,” Cas says, and when Dean looks up there’s a small smile on his face. “I don’t mind that you know.”
As they stood before the official-person-who-gets-to-marry-people in a simple room with a desk and a window facing a brick wall – Sam at Dean's shoulder, grinning like a fool – Dean remembered many things. He remembered laughing so hard and feeling so giddy he stepped in front of a cyclist, fell and broke his wrist. He remembered endless days of sneaking behind the garage and making out like horny teenagers with muffled moans and roaming hands and hot, hot skin. He remembered arguing over whether or not buying organic products really saved the world and giving up.
It’s Meg’s voice on the other end. “I don’t want to hear it,” she hisses, “you can flirt on your own time.”
, he thinks to himself. This isn’t the real world. This is some moment he is living, across an ocean, where Cas kisses him back, and he has somewhere to go, and the Impala sits in the garage, waiting for him. This isn’t the real world. The real world is waiting for him to come and clean it up, wipe the vomit from its face and pay its fucking bills.
Dean ate his fries. “Soon though.” They pressed their knees together under the table. “Are your students impressed?”
“Halloween is a difficult time for Gabriel,” Cas tells him, “having to decide between sweets and pranking innocent neighbours is very stressful.”
” Sam’s voice. He turned, their eyes met. The second it took for Sam to fill his lungs and speak again, was the worst moment of Cas’ life. “He’s awake.”
“Will you let me?” He asks, and his fingers, those goddamn fingers, are tucking into the waistband of Dean’s jeans and not tugging so much as leading, guiding. It makes Dean fumble, punches the air out of him to puff against Cas’ lips.
Sam was looking at the stranger with such unrestrained pity in his eyes that it seemed to make the air heavy and difficult to breath again, like you might look at an abused puppy left out in the cold and the rain. The stranger was looking at Dean, and that look… well, the last time he'd seen that look; the 'it-hurts-like-fucking-hell-but-I'm-putting-on-a-brave-face-for-you"-look, had been in a mirror. When John had just died, and he'd suddenly been alone with a twelve year old kid brother to take care of.
In the morning, Talbot finds his feet sticking out from under the car, moving to an imaginary beat. Dean hears him coming, but doesn’t stop working.
"I tell everyone that my first kiss was Annie Cartman from elementary school–" these were not only secrets, they were very specifically the secrets he would never tell anyone. Why was he standing here, reading them out to a stranger in a
Cas rolls his head towards Dean, pressing his cheek to the back of the couch. He looks small there, Dean thinks.
”There’s still the cake.” Cas said, in a daze because Dean was just grinning at him like there was nothing else. Like the people around them were dust, and the room was a void. Like the two of them were stars. Blinding each other.
Cas makes no move. Dean can’t tell anything from the look on his face. “We never promised each other anything.” Cas says.
Cas moves closer, presses their shoulders together, the bare skin of their arms lined up and pressed close.
They sat on the hood of the Impala and watched the sun rise over the Grand Canyon. Dean was laughing. The world was a cascade of orange and red and incomprehensible expanse.
Time became useless. There was no ticking clock in their bedroom to remind them of it passing. Their silences were fabric stretched over tongues. In between, their words seemed rushed and insubstantial.
In a weak moment, on his way to bed, he hears Talbot’s voice in the other room, and wants to knock on the door, wants to say, “what do I do?” wants to say “can you tell me what to do?” but even in his head those words are the words of a child. It’s too late for him to start acting like a child.
Then Cas reaches out and strokes the back of his knuckles against Dean’s arm, then against his neck, and goosebumps are erupting all over Dean’s skin. Feeling his heartbeat in his fingertips, he leans forward and meets Cas in the middle. It’s a simple, soft press of lips against lips. Dean’s bottom lip catches a little between Cas’, and then they’re leaning back again. Cas puts his thumb against Dean’s jaw, and smiles at him. Then he gets up and goes back to work.
He drags his nails against Cas’ bare arm, slowly. “You deal with lots of people at Taste Buds every day.”
“It was my doctor,” Dean says, “I’m deathly allergic to sugar and can no longer be within fifty yards of hard-boiled sweets. You’re gonna have to leave.”
“Sure,” Dean says, trying for casual. He pretends Cas doesn’t hold an arm vaguely around his back when he walks in.
His phone starts ringing, Cas’ name flashing across the screen. He considers not answering, then he does.
“Did I wake you up?” Dean says. It’s the first thing he can think of. The hair of Cas’ head is flat on one side. There are circles under his eyes and he’s wearing a long sleeved t-shirt that’s old and stretched out and falling off of one shoulder.
He looked 'round. There weren't many people in the ER. Some teenagers who seemed up to no good, a kid that seemed about eight, looking miserable and tired next to an equally miserable and tired father, two young women, of which one had her foot on a bundled up jacket on an empty seat, arguing heatedly over one of the magazines, and, sitting right next to Dean, a man in a purple button down, black slacks and carefully styled hair, looking worriedly at Dean's swollen wrist.
“You’re wildly attractive.” He could hear how his voice had dropped a few octaves. Even if he hadn’t heard it, he’d be able to tell from the darkening of Dean’s eyes, and the way his hand clenched suddenly.
He sits in Talbot’s ’73 Dodge Challenger outside Cas’ apartment building at five to noon, his fingers tapping the dashboard, trying not to stare at Cas’ door.
”We need to fix this, like, immediately. You should come over to my place and watch them. Right now.”
“Obviously there’s a lot to do. Basically at this point she’s got gas and breaks, and the steering wheel works. Hopefully.”
When Cas comes, Dean has his arms wrapped tight around his hips, pressing as close as he can get, swallowing, and Cas is shaking.
) He was probably sad. It must be sad to lose patients, especially the ones with family. They would roll his body down to the morgue. He wondered if Dean had felt it. Would dying hurt, even under anesthesia? Did doctors sow up the patients if they died on the table? Would they be stitching Dean’s head together again before they left the OR? Would they be leaving it open, gaping, for Cas and Sam and Jess to stare down into–
Dean’s fingers twitched on the fabric of Cas’ vest. Then he resumed folding it. He tossed it on the bed. “Did you hear the part where I said I love you?”
Cas kisses him, and for a second he thinks, maybe– but then he’s being led to the couch, and Cas curls up against him, both of them still wearing jeans, and presses close close close for long moments. Cas pulls a blanket over them, and Dean holds his face in his hands and presses kisses to his cheeks and it’s the gentlest thing he’s done since he held his newborn brother in his arms for the first time, feeling clumsy and scared but wanting to do something right.
Talbot’s driver is wearing a tuxedo. He looks like a butler from a period drama. Dean might think this was just the way British people dressed except people around him are throwing them weird glances, pausing on the way to their cars.
Dean rolls his eyes. Pressure is lifting off his chest now, he’s breathing a little easier. “Bitch,” he mutters.
Cas ducked his head and tried not to grin too much. “You don’t care about the structures of ancient languages.”
That works. I don’t have another race until mid-September. As long as I don’t have to do the back-end stuff, it’s cool. Will give John a call on Monday.
"I am Castiel." He said. "I am your–" he glanced at Sam, who nodded encouragingly. "I'm your boyfriend."
The centre reminds Dean of Headley Court, though it’s nothing like it. There’s no lawns or gardens, that he can see. But it has the same air of carefully manufactured calm hanging over it.
“I always thought he was such a dick,” Dean says, before he can stop himself. He looks at Cas, alarmed, but Cas is smiling.
Then John hadn’t been in a few pictures, because he hadn’t been there when they snuck into the zoo without paying, or there to drop Sam off at school. Dean has stood alone on his awkward stick-legs, with his overflowing smile, holding his little brother’s hand.
Ricky takes his baseball cap off the hook on the wall and shoves it on his head, “no idea.” He sounds bitter.
me, but you were in my life and in my bed. That’s not something I can fabricate. I am not that good of a liar, and neither are you.
An older woman Dean has seen before comes in, and gives him an odd look as she orders a coffee to go. He smiles politely at her, hoping he doesn’t look like a drug addict with his blood-shot eyes. When she leaves, Cas comes over and hands him a very large cup of coffee, then stands by his table, frowning down at him.
Sam calls the bank. The money from Talbot comes in, and it’s enough to pay for a couple of months of property rent. Dean hangs a “temporarily closed” sign on the front windows of the shop, and lets his customers know that there’s been a family emergency, and that when, and if, they open up again, his offers for discounts still stand.
“I can pay it,” Dean says to the man, a little nameplate Dean hadn’t noticed before reads Mr. Taylor, “Upfront.”
Hey Charlie. I’m really sorry. It’s cool that you’re mad at me. You didn’t do anything, I’m just an asshole. How’s Max? And the cat? I’ll come visit you as soon as I’m home again. Maybe I’ll fly right to Boston from here? If you want. Miss you, kiddo.
Dean loses his breath. If there were any doubts in him – and there were, there were so many he thought there was nothing real beneath them, that he was made up of them and if they disappeared there wouldn’t be enough left of him to make him a person – they fall away in this moment. The last time he showed up at this door, unexpected, he had been a man made of missing pieces, scared to death there was no substance to him – scared that he was all lack.
Dean sees Sam clench his jaw from the corner of his eye, as he pulls out of the parking lot. Then Sam turns in his seat and looks at their dad for a long moment.
Sam tries to make himself scarce but it’s a small house. Dean steps outside and sits on the stoop, rubbing his sweaty palms on his jeans. Evening’s setting in over Scottsbluff, the sun dipping over the summit to the west. He doesn’t get much evening light in his garden.
When they eat, Sam starts asking questions. He wants to know more about what Talbot is like now, what it was like living in a manor. He wants to know if it really does rain as much as they say. Then he asks about Cas.
He leans back for a moment. Cas’ eyes are full of concern. Dean considers stopping. He considers stepping back. The precipice surges close to his feet and he feels dizzy with it.
Cas doesn’t answer for a long moment, and Dean starts to worry he’s put his foot in something. Then he says, “to have somewhere to go,” and Dean doesn’t have an answer to that, so he changes the subject.
And there it is again, that cavernous thing. That gaping precipice. Leaning up towards him, rushing up towards him and as if he can tell, Cas curls a little closer and says, voice low and husky and god has Dean wanted to hear his voice like this, wanted to know what he sounded like in this moment and here it it, it’s his to drink in and savor and have and Cas says
Dean always disliked hospitals. Not because he felt particularly adverse to needles, he could not care less about the smell and the color scheme, and he hadn't been scared of Doctors since he was five. What annoyed him about hospitals wasn't even that they made you wait five hours before they poked at your wrist to tell you it was broken when you clearly already knew that. No, what
Cas’ hands scrabble uselessly over his shoulders, not getting any grip, but they feel like a gift, every press of his fingers and twinge when a nail gets him make Dean shudder.
“It happens instantly. I look up and I don’t know where I am or how I got there. And people are looking at me like–”
He’s cross legged in front of the headlights, carefully teasing it out of its holding and turning it around to check the wirework.
The corridors look different at night. He has to feel himself forward with a hand against a wall, and the floorboards creak loudly under him. The staircase seems longer, the ceilings higher.
He goes back through their conversation, Sam’ “is it a date” hanging empty on the screen without a response. When he goes to his contacts, Castiel Novak is right there at the top.
“It’s okay,” He’s saying, “of course I get it. You’re gonna be an awesome dad, and an awesome husband. I’m real happy for you.”
A slow roll of worry is gathering in Dean’s stomach. “I’m gonna have to go back to the States,” he says, “I have to sell the shop, and I have a house there, and I think I should see dad again.”
“Dean,” Cas is saying, “Dean, Dean, Dean,” and he’s pulling his fingers out to move Dean’s arm away from his mouth so much like Dean had in the kitchen but Dean unclenches his teeth and grabs Cas’ hand and pushes Cas’ fingers back into himself along with his own and it hurts but it’s better than–
"I accidentally tore his favorite comic book when he was eight. He'd been saving for it for a month. I hid it and never told him." He glanced up at the stranger, who nodded encouragingly again.
“We get all sorts around here,” the guy says, “even shouty mechanics.” Dean looks down at himself, noting the fresh oil stains and his dirty fingernails. “We don’t have a dress code,” the guy adds, and walks away.
"Sure was," he offered, "unless you had hay fever or disliked any of the way too many shades of yellow."
It takes a moment for Cas to speak, “are you sure? I’ll need to be dropped off and picked up, it’ll be out of your way–”
“Wait,” Cas starts, but Dean looks up at him, and something in his face makes Cas stop and swallow, red flush creeping over his chest.
“You’re gonna be in a different country, around different people, it’s a change of pace and we think that might be what you need.”
Cas trudged up towards the house, shifting his hold on the plastic bags to try to get some blood back into the tips of his fingers. He sidestepped a rake. Dean never really got far with the yard work. Cas thought he enjoyed it unkempt. Last week he had spent hours carefully pulling weeds by the azaleas but raking leaves? Yeah no, that rake was going to be abandoned.
Cas presses his lips to the corner of Dean’s mouth, then pulls back just a little to look at him, still rocking close close close, in in in. ”Yeah?” He breaths. So unlike how he usually speaks, but still so much himself.
“She’s my best girl,” Talbot tells him. “A bit temperamental, but what’s a car without some surprising elements?”
In his room, he showers and puts on boxers and a t-shirt. He feels drunk, or hungover. Off-kilter anyway. The room seems different. It looks imposing and unfamiliar, taller and narrower. Dean rubs his hands through his wet hair.
“I love you,” Cas mumbles into his cheek, then kisses him there, and then at the edge of his jaw, and then again, on his lips.
“Yeah,” Dean says again, a little weaker. “This job I just did, should be enough to get us back on track.”
For some reason, that made the guy laugh. It was a low, bitter, slightly manic sound, and it hurt to listen to. He dragged both hands through his hair and then rubbed them over his face. "No. No, thank you, that is very kind but I am quite alright. Would you mind very much if I accompanied you to the register?"
He started and almost spilled his champagne. The previously empty spot of wall next to him was suddenly occupied by a guy roughly Dean's age, with dark hair and blue eyes. Dean vaguely recalled seeing him during various wedding-party relates crises over the last few months. He had mostly looked terrified by the whole ordeal, and, well, Dean could relate to that.
It’s proof, he tells himself, that it was just him. It’s proof that whatever he was in those people’s lives, they don’t mind him gone. If they had they would have called to yell at him, to curse at him. People who care don’t let themselves be treated like that. If Cas missed him he would– He thinks about the way Cas had smiled at him, that day at the lake when he’d told Dean all those things about guilt and forgiveness. For some reason he’d picked Dean to say all those things to, and Dean had picked him to say all sorts of things back. It was easier to say things when Cas was there, but he has no idea how to pick up the phone.
Cas doesn’t get out of the car. “Thank you for sharing it with me,” he says, and Dean hates it. He turns his head away and presses his eyes shut.
Sam chuckles, “I don’t know, he was always a little strange, we never got a single one of his jokes.”
“No,” Dean insists. “I’m talking like all of your feelings aren’t real and you’re just acting them out ’cause you’re supposed to, and really you’re a sociopath who doesn’t actually care about people?” Someone who doesn’t want to feel things. Someone who doesn’t feel real unless something hurts. Someone who doesn’t feel good about taking care of his dad, who can’t be happy for his kid brother being happy and doesn’t know why. Someone who knows, deep down, they’re a bad person, and every day they get away with it is just a day closer to the end.
Cas touched the back of Dean’s hand and his relief was intense when their hands tangled together because at least this is the same. This easy reach for each other.
Sam looks surprised. When he starts towards Dean, he’s pretty sure he’s gonna get hugged again. Instead, Sam reaches out and flicks him on the forehead.
“It turns out I was not a very good soldier,” Cas continues, between bites of food. “My father was not pleased. He would have preferred I give my life to the army, than come home like this.”
“That’s insane,” Sam says, “where does dad get off sending you halfway across the world to fix a car for some rich old friend–“
“I thought this couldn’t be real,” he’s saying, and they are just holding on to each other as tight as they can, “I thought there was no way we could have this.”
Dean laughs, and laughs, and laughs. He pushes the hair out of Cas’ face, lays his hands on him, talks to him until he is smiling.
“That’s awesome, Dean,” Sam says, “It must be so weird for you, I can’t imagine…” He trails off and Dean doesn’t have any words to fill in for him. “Still think it’ll take two months?”
Dean shrugged and looked away, sipping his champagne. He made it look so effortless. The buttons on his suit jacket were undone, and his tie was a little crooked as he leaned his elbows on the railing, glass hanging dangerously from his fingers. Except not dangerously. Castiel trusted those fingers more than he trusted this balcony to stay fused to the building. And he didn’t even
Rows upon rows of bottles line the walls on either side of them, and in front of them shelves upon shelves. It’s an entire basement full of alcohol. Talbot leads him along the shelves and there, somewhere in the middle of it all, sits an island of armchairs and couches and, in the centre, a poker table.
There’s an adjacent garage and a big driveway. A couple stands inspecting the hedges along the edge of the property and closer to the street a man has stopped, phone held out with straight elbows, to take a picture of the For Rent-sign stood in the grass. The front door is wide open. Next to it, a handwritten sign says “Open House” in big, loopy letters.
“Give me the bottle, kid.” Talbot’s hand is open. He’s not reaching for it, not trying to take it. He’s just holding his hand out, palm open. There, Dean can see the same dark lines of grease that Dean has on his own hands, where the grease sticks no matter how hard you scrub. The same calluses.
“Huh,” he mutters, and puts it back. He stands, knee creaking worryingly, and pops the hood to finish tweaking the fuel injection. It only takes a couple of seconds of probing fingers for a sick sort of deja vu to settle in his stomach. He’s done that already.
In the early afternoon, she sneaks him out through a back door of the barn and around the back of the pig-pen, shushing him when he tries to ask where they’re going. She sits down on the ground, leaning her back against a fence-pole, and pulls him down to sit next to him.
He runs his tongue over his teeth. He doesn’t taste blood. His cheekbone and eye are burning and he blinks, blinks, blinks until he can see again.
He hadn’t noticed that Cas was home yet. He could see Dean through the doorway to the living room. Dean sighed, nodded.
He wants to keep saying it. They are the only words that don’t hurt his throat, that seem to want to fall out into the space between them and fill it up so it’s not cold and empty. But Cas looks like Dean’s slapped him, and the space between them stays.
A noise leaves him, something ragged and breathless, and Cas pushes his face close to Dean’s neck, kissing the skin beneath his jaw, and Dean is staring into blue, blue sky, with Cas’ hands gripping his arms tight, and Cas’ lips against his throat.
Sighing, Dean puts his tools down. On the tray is a french press, plunger already down and a cup poured, steam rising gently off the surface. He drinks it leaning against the bench. It’s nothing like Cas’, but it’s coffee, and he gets the message.
Ricky gives him an understanding look, “sure thing, Dean.” He rocks on his heels for a second, “I’ve got an alignment to fix, they’re gonna pick the car up at lunch,” he says, but he lingers in the doorway, worrying a pair of car keys in his hands.
. It doesn’t make you un-thirsty, it doesn’t speed you up or slow you down, doesn’t make women hotter than they are. It has, literally, no purpose.
“Of course I’m coming there,” Sam says, sounding surprised, “Eileen booked the ticket for me like half an hour ago.”
Dean hasn’t planned this very well. He lands at five am and balks at the price the taxi driver gives him. For a moment, he considers calling Talbot. Then he considers calling Katie. Both options seem terrible, and it’s five am, so he gets in the cab and tells himself he’ll have a job soon. He has a marketable skill.
, he was holding two cups of coffee, he wasn’t even wearing shoes it would look– what would Dean think?
She doesn’t ask him why he dropped out. She lets him talk at her about the Model A for a while, though she’s nodding like she already knows the stuff.
A tingle ran up his spine as he remembered Dean’s smile, his shining eyes, the backdrop a soft bokeh out on that balcony.
He tries to remember if he’s ever done this before. If being naked with someone has every been about anything other than sex.
Dean clears the table, then clears three more. He drops a cup in the kitchen, and doesn’t have time to sweep it up, so he shoves the pieces aside with his shoes and tells Meg when they pass in the door to not step on them please.
Cas lifts his head from Dean’s neck, blinks at him, and smiles, slow and soft. “I don’t have any money either.” He tells Dean.
. He thumbs past advertisements, a painful loss for Derby County rugby team and the personals, but stops at property rentals.
A woman in an apron by the register jumps and spills hot water on her hand. She shouts, “ah, bollocks!” and sticks her hand under the tap. There’s only a few customers, sitting in armchairs around small tables. They all turn to stare at him. Dean can feel his face growing warm.
“You too, Talbot.” And it is, strangely. Jimmy Talbot always did affect his surroundings like a punch affects a face: suddenly and with lasting effects, and something about his smile makes Dean think of a too big leather jacket, Sammy’s hand in his, and the smell of grease and cigarette smoke. “Though I have to say, from where I’m standing, a lot has changed. Man, what are you wearing?” Dean grins, “The mansion I kinda get, but what happened to your jeans? Why are you wearing glasses from the eighteenth century?”
“Thank you for everything you did for me.” He speaks carefully, like he’s rehearsed this too. “I leaned on you, and you’re the best brother anyone could ask for. And I’m sorry I left you to deal with a mess you shouldn’t have had to deal with, that no kid should have to deal with.”
“You didn’t tell me about Katie’s,” Cas says, and hands him an opened beer. There’s a pizza box on the coffee table, and a crime show playing in the background.
Sam managed to stay in the waiting room. Cas could not. He clutched at his own ribs and wished that it was night. Because Dean had always been stars. It was the way he had come to think of him, in accordance with heavenly bodies; bright lights breaking up the dark.
“Hello,” she says, her smile wide, “I’m here to answer any questions that you have. Are you looking for yourself or for a family? This is a perfect starter house for a small family, or for one who just wants the one child. The bedroom down the hall is smaller than the master but perfectly suitable as both a nursery and a bedroom. Do you have children?”
“Great!” Talbot jumps out of the chair. He can do that now, he got the cast off. “You can come with me to this car show I have to go to. You’re a good kid for keeping me company. Meet you in the garage in 15?”
Meg starts decorating Taste Buds. Castiel hangs a sign in the window, reading “temporary decorations for a rented event” and, in a smaller hand, “we are not practising satanism”. The tables get covered in black fabric, the jars of loose leaf tea and landscape paintings replaced by skulls and crystal snakes, and wall hangings with strange symbols on them.
“It was awesome,” Dean says, “she’s never gonna finish that car without help though, not without some serious income.”
Anger flashes across Sam’s face, “I don’t really give a shit what he likes right now. He’s gonna do it.”
“Yeah,” Dean says, dragging a hand over his hair. He needs to cut it at some point, and shave. “I’m good. Your, uh, your tie is on backwards.”
Cas has ear-dogged pages and written little notes in the margins with a neat, cramped hand. It makes Dean feel inescapably fond.
,” he hisses, glancing down at his coffee-stained jeans. Cas calmly takes the travel mug out of his hand and gives him a napkin. “He’s in law school for crying out loud, can he stop acting like a high schooler?”
There is something venomous within Dean, sitting between his ribs, pulling them apart – spreading his chest open until he is violently, brokenly exposed, threatening to spill out. He needs to pull something in, to pull something down with him.
Dean thinks he will shake apart, that he will fall into pieces because how could he contain all the things growing, bubbling up inside him. It comes out as a smile, he can feel it break across his face and hear the relieved laugh falling out of his mouth. He can’t look away from Cas’ face. He couldn’t, not for anything.
“Right,” he says, “so I have to replace a lot of parts, and it’s gotta be original. Talbot’s being really unhelpful, but I found this guy over in Andover? He said he had a bunch of stuff I could look at. Except I guess I… kind of didn’t find him. I don’t think he gave me a real address.”
Time is moving strangely. In a way, there is only this: Cas’ hand in his, Cas warm and heavy in his mouth, narrowing his world down into something he can understand. In another way, he is hurtling forward, experiencing the loss of every second yanked past him like breaths.
He works until he can’t stand to look at her anymore, this misshapen skeleton of all he used to know.
Dean says, “sure, yeah,” not really listening, distracted by how blue Cas’s eyes look against all the grey and brown behind him.
The drive goes by in moments of seamless gear shifts. He blinks and he’s at Cas’ door. Maybe he knocked. Either way, Cas has opened the door, he’s standing there, with his rumpled hair and his sad eyes, and he’s saying something but Dean can’t hear him.
Dean rubs his neck. “Well, I was actually wondering if you wanted to– See, the car, the Impala, it’s sort of…”
Cas is back, pulling at his shoulder, urging him onto his back. Dean isn’t sure what Cas sees in his face, but it makes him stroke Dean’s cheek, it makes him whisper things into his ear, things Dean can’t hear or doesn’t understand or doesn’t want but which land over him in layers. Cas grips Dean’s thigh and pushes his legs up and then pushes pushes pushes back in. Dean’s back arches without his permission, a moan falls into the air and he can’t say whose it is. Cas puts his thumb on Dean’s chin, tilts his head until they’re looking right at each other, and then he pulls back out and thrusts back in, solid, even hard.
“I lived outside of Brighton for the first few years of my life, until my father’s ambition took our family to the States. Technically, I have dual citizenship.”
Dean didn’t usually love public displays of affection. He had no trouble sneaking off to have sex in a broom closet during a wedding, sure, and had more than once grabbed Cas’ ass in public. Affection, on the other hand, was doled out in private. A kiss on the cheek, twining their fingers together, resting his head on Cas’ shoulder; these were the things Cas had learned to treasure above all else.
He nods, “I was three.” Suddenly he’s turned on the bench, looking right at Dean. His eyes calm, a little sad. “Our father valued loyalty. He had our lives planned for us, Michael and Raphael never questioned it. They were good sons. But Gabriel wouldn’t be pushed. He just. Refused.”
Today, he’s the only customer. He has been watching an old lady through the window, slowly making her way down the street with a walker. A bird flies down and sits in front of her on the sidewalk, then flies away again. The old lady keeps walking.
He glances over, just to check for any sign that Cas is fucking with him. There’s nothing in his face but an open warmth. It does something weird to Dean’s chest. His hand goes up to ruffle Cas’s hair, just to see if he can, but it turns into a weird sort of pat halfway through. The corners of Cas’s mouth twitch up into a wide-eyed smile. He looks fragile and soft and like the most solid thing Dean has ever encountered.
Cas directs him out of Leatherhead and onto the M3, where Dean lets the ’66 Ford Mustang stretch its legs. It isn’t the original engine, but Dean doesn’t mind much, glancing at the speedometer. Talbot hasn’t bothered to fix the radio, though.
It’s a ten minute drive until he starts closing in on the Leatherhead town centre. It’s a small, old little town. Cute, almost. He parks the car on the side of a street and marches up and down streets until he finds a little café, nestled between a candy shop and a travel agency. He frowns up at the name of the business, “Taste Buds”. It seems like a new low. Then he marches inside.
Dean doesn’t know what that is, “no, like, ever feel like you got all these people convinced and one day you’ll slip up and they’ll figure it out?”
“You just arrived, let’s not talk business. I want to hear everything,” Talbot says, leaning forward, “what have you been up to? How long has it been? What are you now, nineteen?”
It’s really, really difficult not to drink. He checks his cabinets, he checks his bookcases, he checks his bedroom: no bottles anywhere. He doesn’t own a car anymore. He considers walking to the store. Instead, he sits himself down on the couch and makes himself stay there, forces his legs not to move.
He goes to John’s apartment with a pile of bills. They do that sometimes, sit at John’s little kitchen table and sort invoices and bills until they make sense, and John signs what he needs to sign so Dean can do his job.
“I’m just saying,” Dean tries again, “she might not have invited anyone else, and it’s a ruse to make us drop out guard.”
“No,” Dean agrees, and hopes it’s not a rejection, not yet, not before he’s said his piece. “But I should have. Promised you things. I don’t know– obviously, I don’t know what this was… to you. But, to me.” His voice is disappearing, and Cas is just looking at him. There are walls there that Dean doesn’t remember, can’t remember seeing there before.
The grin is the same one Dean knows from his adolescence, but very little else is. He looks older, sure, it’s been more than ten years since they saw each other last, but Dean knows Jimmy as John Winchester’s friend, who wears torn jeans and yesterday’s wife-beater and who’s missing a tooth, he doesn’t know this man in the nice suit, whose American accent lilts in odd ways, who is clean-shaven and sober and wearing delicate round spectacles.
“It’s my aunt’s farm,” she tells him. “She raises pigs and lets me live here since I dropped out of Uni.”
When he thinks Talbot’s out of the house, he fixes every single thing he can find wrong with Talbot’s cars.
“Remember– Remember when we lived in Oregon for a bit? You were nine, I think.” His throat was full of the words he wasn’t saying. “We’d been in the car for weeks–“ because John hadn’t wanted to stop, “and you were really bored and cranky, and you shoved that army man in the ashtray? Remember that? We tried to get it out before he noticed but every time it moved it would scratch the metal–“ Dean stops to breathe.
“Sam, for fuck–“ he glances at the little girl next to him, who’s still staring with wide-eyed attention, “For christ’s sake, I’m not having this discussion with you right now–“
“I pretty much raised him. Dad– Dad did what he could, but he had to earn money, and he took the jobs he found, so a lot of the time… it was just me and Sam. I wasn’t good at it, believe me. I was either too soft on him or too hard on him, but dad made sure I knew, ’you gotta take care of your brother. You gotta look after Sam, cause no one else will.’ So I did. Then he gets into Stanford, so I guess I didn’t screw him up completely, right? So he went to California. Dad lost it. He was so angry, and Sam was so angry. I thought I’d never see him again, but he kept calling. And dad kept drinking. I’m glad he got out. He’s gonna have a real good life. A real family.”
Cas was already inside the room. He didn’t hear the end of Sam’s sentence. Didn’t care. Dean’s jaw was clenched tight. They looked at each other for several long moments. Was it silence? Or was it a black hole, swallowing everything and anything so greedily even light died between its teeth?)
He goes back to the car. The windshield wipers are going furiously fast, looking desperate yet failing miserably at keeping the rain off the glass.
), looking slightly concerned. He had his hands in his trouser pockets and the material stretched tight over his crotch.
Dean takes his face into his hands and kisses him again, over and over. He wraps his arm tight around his waist and pulls him close.
It looks nice on him. His face softens and the corners of his eyes crinkle. He looks rumpled and warm.
“Jess is getting coffee.” Sam said. “The coffee here sucks, but you know that. You’ve been drinking it too. Dean’s lucky, not being allowed to have any.” It was a bad attempt at a joke, and the quirk of Sam’s lip fell quickly into nothing.
When there’s a lull in the crowd after lunch, Cas sits with him for a little bit, complaining about a man who’d been in this morning.
Dean feels mean for wanting to laugh, so he doesn’t. When Castiel walks back to the kitchen, Dean lets his eyes linger just for a second. It’s a decent view.
ticked him off was that he had to sit those five hours on a hard plastic seat with the only entertainment being a TV playing
because of my advice, you actually listen to me, and you’ve been doing all the brave things and I’ve just been… It’s not fair to you, any of this.”
The moment stretches, seconds ticking past despite him, and he knows that for every second he doesn’t talk he’s making it worse. Every second his throat is closing tighter. Cas is looking worried. Dean moves his hand up, to hold onto Cas’ ankle, his skin is cool to the touch.
When he found out, he hadn’t said a word. He had been silent all the way back from the hospital, and he didn’t stop at the house. He had driven straight to Singer and Sons and got out of the car. Cas followed him. Having nothing to say, it was the only thing to do. Just walk after him, watch his jerky movements, wait, think.
The covers are still rumpled from where Cas slept last night, and it’s easy to push them aside to make room for the two of them. Dean runs his hands over Cas’ back, pushes their chests and hips together, and Cas breathes out, long and slow, across the skin of Dean’s throat.
“Dude, wait,” Dean stops him. Cas is wringing his hands in a tea towel. “Shit, I’m so hungover, wait a second.” He takes a couple of deep gulps of coffee. “Gabriel let it slip that, uh, that you were in the army.”
Dean loves him. He puts his beer down on the table, says “look,” and turns around on the couch to face him. Nothing else comes out.
"You forgot me. And I tried to comfort you. I wasn't thinking, I tried to kiss you and– well, you reacted reasonably. Under the circumstances."
When Dean pulls Cas into his mouth, his hand clenches in Dean’s, but the other one strokes his cheek, his hairline, his neck. Cas is saying things, but Dean can’t hear them. He doesn’t need to, he just needs Cas’ voice, landing like a blanket over him, starting to fill up all these new, empty places in him.
Dean laughed a little, “yeah, of course. I missed you too.” They kissed again. “Are you holding coffee?”
Talbot’s eyes grow sad. “I don’t think you do,” he says, and Dean’s jaw clamps shut. He’s suddenly furious with Talbot, furious with how he keeps toying with Dean’s life, keeps pulling rugs out from under him.
They do, indeed, have everything. Talbot leads him along, hobbling happily, through the massive entrance hall with a shining chandelier, into a restaurant-level kitchen, through a wooden door and down a staircase into what is very obviously a wine cellar. Except it’s not so much a wine cellar as it is a jungle of booze.
Sam waits silently. Dean puts the phone between his shoulder and his ear and starts in on the breaks.
“Cas, you okay?” And then Dean was right there, putting his hands on Cas’ hips, where they belonged by all decent laws of the universe. He touched a thumb to Cas’ lower lip, “you look upset.”
Whatever Sam said, it made Dean pick up a book from the coffee table and throw it as hard as he could against the wall. It made Cas flinch. Then he spoke in hushed tones, as if he knew someone could hear him. As if he hadn’t just thrown Cas’ copy of Egalia’s Daughters across the room. “Yes. Sam. Exactly. I
He calls out before he can stop himself. His nails dig into Cas’ back. Then Cas does it again, never looking away, holding Dean’s hip steady with one hand, leaning on his other elbow, placed so his hand can cradle Dean’s jaw and of course, of course this is how he would do this: giving Dean what he needs, clear blue eyes never looking away, looking fearlessly, tenderly, not shying away from all those ugly things Dean is trying to hold inside, all that empty space.
Cas makes him soup. It’s warm and dry in the kitchen, especially after he peels his leather jacket off his skin and wraps another blanket around his torso, and once the smell of potato and leek soup starts filling the air.
He steps away from the door, and goes to the travel agency next door. The man there is confused why he’s asking for help at a travel agency, he can just book things online now, and instead of asking him why he works at a travel agency if it’s so obsolete, Dean stammers out something about not having a computer, and asks him to please just book it for him, thank you. The man does, and Dean pays with his shitty, scratched up American Express and tucks the ticket into his pocket and tells himself he’s doing the right thing.
When Sam was little, Dean had been the best thing in the whole fucking world. He had been a big brother. His hands were good for more than fixing cars, they were good for wiping tears, for tying shoes, for being handed drawings.
Dean squeezes his eyes shut and holds onto Cas until he feels like a person again, a person and not just a body overflowing with joy and fear in equal measure.
“So you work for your dad, yeah?” Katie’s eyes are closed, a pleased curl to her mouth, “I couldn’t do that, I’d kill him.”
Looking back over his actions the last few hours, Dean feels assured that this cannot be blamed on his poor map-reading skills. He decides to blame it on the English countryside, and road signs, and the car, and England, and the rain.
The summer has been hard on the house. The green paint on the walls is peeling off in places. As the taxi drives off, he lifts the postbox up and tries to hook it back on its nails. One of them is bent. Dropping his duffel-bag on the stoop, he heads around the corner to his tool-shed, stepping over his overgrown raspberry bushes on the way.
Talbot raises an eyebrow at him, “I don’t know how to tell you this, but it’s actually a pretty mediocre car.”
“I was not trained for this!” He yells back, then Cas puts another tray in his hand, loaded with full cups, and pushes him towards a group of teenagers taking up two tables.
His wrench lay, in plain sight, among the other tools. Dean scoffed at himself and went back to work.
“Come on, dad, time to get up,” Dean says, rolling him over on his side with a grunt. There’s no response.
“You don’t have to explain anything,” Dean says, looking away. He looks down at his hands, rough and cracked, little lines and shadows crawling over them where the engine grease would never quite wash out.
“Sam: how did it go with those leads yesterday, question mark, question mark,” Cas reads, like he’s reciting the phone book, “Dean: got lost, trying again today. Castiel is helping me.”
). "See you around, or something." He gave a mock salute with his none-broken wrist and went to meet the nurse.
Cas didn’t manage to speak. He pulled a thread on his trousers as hard as he could. It cut into his palm. Sam was scared but trying not to let it show.
Dean leans his elbows on the car roof, and rests his chin on his fist. His stomach is twisted up in nerves, and he’s sweating under his collar, but he could stand here, looking, for a very long time.
“It’s Talbot’s butler,” he explains, and pulls out onto the road “he’s a pain in my ass. He’d been force feeding me the stuff for five days when I lost it and went looking for coffee.”
“Dean, love, wait,” Cas grasped his face with both hands, pressed their lips together. Dean relaxed as if his strings had been cut.
Dean had picked up a wrench. His last couple of steps toward the beat up old Ford sitting in a corner had been long and urgent. When he started beating it, he started screaming. When he smashed the windows, Cas cried.
He looked older. His hair was hanging in his face and curling at his shoulders. He had wrinkles around his eyes and along his brow. Dean's little brother looked older than him.
“I haven’t actually driven her yet,” Dean says. “She starts and stops, but it will probably not be a very smooth ride.” For the first time, he gets to look at her in the light of the sun. She looks bigger out here. “She might break down, which is why I’m bringing all that.” He nods at the tools in the backseat.
He was eleven the first time he kissed someone. They hid behind the car on the far side of the motel, and she pressed her lips to his just for a second, before she ran off, giggling. They’d left the state the next day.
”Please,” he breaths into the mattress, then turns his head and breathes it again into Cas’ mouth. Cas shudders and tucks their foreheads together and Dean can see him squeeze his eyes tightly shut for a second before he says–
When Cas goes back to work, there’s a high flush peeking out of his collar and painting his cheeks. Deal spills coffee on himself. Every time he looks up, Cas is smiling at him, hair standing up in the back and eyes shining.
(Before the surgery. Dean’s hospital room. A void. Dean’s frantic eyes and his outstretched hand reaching for Cas.
Cas buckles himself in, and his hands are shaking a little. “Good. I’m good. Thank you for asking.” His voice is stilted and flat. Then, as if remembering he’s meant to ask: “How are you?”
Dean doesn’t answer. He slides his leg fully in between Cas’, his arms around his waist, and lays himself carefully, gently, across Cas’ body. He lays himself to rest there, in such a welcoming place. He hopes Cas can tell what he means. He hopes Cas knows.
“How old were you?” Cas asks him. He doesn’t think anyone’s ever asked him that before. It seems like such a simple question.
When his breath evens out, and his fingers and his palms, soft and warm, find Dean’s cheeks, Dean is pressing kisses into his hip bone, teeth catching against the skin. Dean is embarrassed that his eyes are burning, and at that feeling, still: a colosseum spanning his chest cavity.
Now, Dean turned around to sit lightly against the car, close to Cas side. He found Cas hand with his, and pressed his lips to his cheek for a short moment.
Don’t you get it?” Dean collapsed on the couch. He buried his face in his hand. “I can’t break his heart anymore, Sam. I can’t do it.”
Dean leans over and opens the passenger door for him. Cas throws him a quick smile, not quite meeting his eyes.
He almost forgets to be scared during turbulence. There is a strange rush in him. All the strings keeping him together have loosened – it’s not a precipice, it’s something else, a sudden rush of adrenaline, a waking up from a dream of falling. Turbulence is nothing against this. He barely understands what the flight attendant is saying to him. He’s too busy wondering if she can read it all on his face, if she can tell this is a man about to throw everything he has at something and hope it catches him. If he dies here, he thinks, at least he dies doing something.
“I will never…” Cas said, swallowing over the lump in his throat. “I will never understand, quite what you’re going through. I can’t imagine. Not being able to trust the people around you, trust your own mind… But this isn’t only happening to you.”
“Fuck you,” Dean says, and starts laughing. She punches him in the shoulder, which makes him laugh harder.
Cas gets them painlessly through the small roads where Dean had gotten lost, and in no time at all, Dean has payed for his smog pump, as well as a cruise control harness, a battery tray, a linear wire loom, and been handed a list of names of people all over England who might be able to help him with the rest. Steven Hardy shakes his hand firmly, and even knows who Talbot is. “That American,” who’d made himself a reputation shipping American classics out into the English countryside.
Sam talks him through looking at his face in the bathroom mirror and washing the vomit off his hands, talks him through calling an ambulance on John’s landline, and stays on the phone with him while an EMT tells him he did good making John vomit, and asks if he wants his face looked at.
Glancing over his shoulder, Dean sees him place the tray on a clear area of the work bench. Then he leaves without another word.
He opens the garage door and drives them in. She’s not difficult to spot, a fixer upper in the corner, surrounded by shiny polished cars.
“So there’s a rehab centre in Gering,” he says, when he’s made Dean hot cocoa on his own stove and sat him down at the table like he’s about to ask for a divorce.
Dean lowers his beer, “for real?” he asks, and she nods like she’s trying to be casual about it, but her eyes are shining. “That’s awesome though, how the hell did you get your hands on that?”
Dean nods. “Cool.” He raps his knuckles in a little pattern on the top of the counter. Then he goes and sits down, wishing he’d done something, touched Cas’ hand, or said something, anything, just to know, just to get anything through the tension layering his skin.
“What are those?” Sam asked. He had his mouth full of bagel, and when he gestured little crumbs ended up all over the table. Dean brushed them off with a glare.
Dean doesn’t unpack. He toes his shoes off, puts his phone to charge, and lies himself, face-down, on the bed.
“You,” Cas says, voice shaking, “are a very good man. Good men often suffer, at their own hands or others’. Now please clear that table.”
Don't get him wrong, Dean was happy his brother was happy, but he couldn't help but wish it was his new sister in law who had insisted on flower arrangement larger than his torso at every table and twinkling lights and
They didn’t speak for a while. Cas let his eyes rest on the piles of new planks, the places where the porch was beginning to take shape, and the places where is was still a skeleton. They were sitting on lawn chairs on the grass.
He’s sold his car to a guy from Bayard who looked like he was going through some kind of crisis, so he has to put Sam in a cab that morning.
They stop at a security gate, and Cas reaches past him to show his ID to the guard, who lets them through. Dean bites his tongue.
He’s taller than last time. He’d been a teenager, the radio blasting loud, Sam singing along in the seat next to him. He hasn’t fixed the radio yet. His hands had been smaller on the steering wheel, less dirty, softer. His head had been clearer, he hadn’t had this pressure on his ribs all the goddamned time. There hadn’t been so much fucking guilt in his stomach.
He’s got the radio working, and quick-speaking British voices are streaming out of the Impala in clear quality. It’s some celebrity talk show, except Dean hav never heard of any of the celebrities. To be fair, he barely knows American celebrities.
“Dean? What’s wrong? Are you hurt?” Some small part of his mind knew the milk had burst open and was running across the grass. That could not be good for the wild strawberries.
Dean lifts his head to argue, lets go of the sheets to push those fingers back into him, but Cas is shifting, pushing Dean’s knee further up along the mattress, and fumbling with the lube, dropping it twice before Dean’s hand is there, steadying it and helping him and it spills over but he can’t find it in him to goddamn care because Cas is hard and wet against his thigh, then right up against him, then Cas is curling both arms alongside Dean’s, grabbing both his hands in his own, lying heavy on Dean’s back, and pushing pushing pushing in.
Sam laughs and doesn’t say ’you don’t get paid enough’. Dean presses the phone close to his ear, grateful. As far as sympathy goes, that’s pretty nice.
I’m super mad at you. Are you dead?? I hope you’re dead cause Sam says you’re talking to him on the phone all the time and if you can call you can check your email. Did I do something? Are you mad at me? I know I’m busy and can’t get out of Boston very often but you went to the UK, dude, you could at least let me know.
Dean sighs, “the thing you do where you judge me really hard for my life choices and it helps me get my head out of my ass.”
Dean feels like writing ’condescending’ in capital letters across the dude’s forehead. “So you know you’re not just picking up some random guy?”
When they’re lying in bed that night, Cas is falling asleep on Dean’s arm and Dean wouldn’t move it for anything, not for anything.
“You don’t have to wait,” Cas says, staring straight ahead. “It takes three hours. You can head back to town or– I’ll be done at half past three.”
“Well, no. But it used to be dad’s car. After mom died we kind of– lived out of it a lot. So I kind of grew up with it. Bank took it when dad couldn’t pay our bills anymore, and then it ended up with Talbot. So.”
White noise filled his ears. He could feel his lips moving but no sound was coming out, he couldn't find his vocal cords, or they weren't working properly.
The rest of the day, the ticket burns a hole in his pocket, and he means to tell Cas. He does. He rehearses it in his head, over and over. “I need to talk to you,” he would say, and Cas would look worried and take him aside and Dean would say stupid things, would put it wrong. He’d make assumptions, make it sound like he’s apologising, and best case scenario Cas would look confused, ask why Dean is making such a big deal out of this, it’s not like they’re in a relationship, it’s not like Cas
Except, doesn’t it not matter, in the end, if Dean gets a chance to repent? You fuck up, you apologise, because people like Cas don’t deserve to walk around wondering if they did something wrong. Good, honest people don’t deserve to think of themselves as undeserving of the kind of love that Dean has for Cas, that seems to want to pour out of him, un-regretful and ardent. People like Cas deserve to hear it.
“That doesn’t sound half-bad, actually,” he says, and takes it. The cup is warm against his hand, the tea soft as silk against his throat. At his pleased noise, Eames almost, almost, smiles a little. He doesn’t say anything about Dean’s red eyes.
Would the doctor be telling them himself? Or sending someone? Cas wondered how he would react to the words, now that he knew already. It wouldn’t be a surprise. Was that better?
“That was the plan,” Talbot says, putting his laptop aside and gesturing at a chair. “Once you finished it I was going to do a whole thing where I put a bow around it, Eames spent hours finding ribbons that were wide enough, he’s gonna be so annoyed– anyway, it’s your car.”
As they drive, Cas tells him about working at Taste Buds, about customers with strange requests, and how Meg keeps scaring away tourists but the regulars have gotten used to her. He tells Dean about himself.
(He had been on his way back from the restroom when Sam and Jessica stepped out of Dean’s room. Sam was shaking, Jessica was holding his hands so hard their knuckles were white.
When Sam starts to pull back, Dean stops him. “Hey,” he says, “I wanna help with the wedding, okay? I wanna help pick flowers and– and argue with vendors and I wanna feed your kids sugar and teach them how to ride bikes, okay?”
The man gives him a long look. “If you want to order something, you can stand in line like everyone else–”
“We should find some colorful flowers that will survive when the vines aren’t blooming. It might get too green otherwise.”
Cas heart pounded painfully against his ribs. He tried to tell himself he was being stupid. But. When it came down to it. There was a fifty percent chance that it was exactly what was happening. As big odds of Dean surviving, being rolled out to them by a smiling surgeon, waking up with a tired grin and some… witty comment, wittier than Cas could ever dream to be. Yes, just as big odds as Dean dying on a table, head cracked open–
Dean tries to pay for dinner, but the teenager working the register gets wide eyed at the sight of Dean’s scratched up American Express card, and stammers that “we don’t take that, sir.”
Below, there’s a rental flat in Cas’ building, and below that, a picture of a little brick house with an untamed garden. It reminds him a little of his house in Scottsbluff, with the prairie windows and the slanted roof.
you don’t care about me having a fucking college education. You never have, I was pushing your buttons which was a dick move but you
That night, he crawls into the backseat of the Impala and huddles up there. He lies, staring at the worn upholstery, covered in a layer of dust; the roof, no longer smoke-blackened. He lifts his head just enough to drink his whiskey without spilling everywhere. He drinks until he feels nauseous, then he closes his eyes.
He was also pretty sure he didn't have a reason to be wearing clothes this fancy. He pulled at the neck of his shirt, opening up the first two buttons. These weren't the clothes he'd put on this morning.
He didn’t let go of Cas’ hand when he kissed him. Just unbuckled his seatbelt, leaned as far over as he could and first, just touched their noses together for a second, and then–
He gave Dean a small, teary-eyed smile, and well, Dean was either going to get murdered in the parking lot, or he was going to do a good deed. If he survived, he could always pick up the rest of his shopping another day. "Yeah, sure, that's fine." He nodded, and started pushing his cart toward the front of the store. The man followed at a respectable distance, casting furtive glances at Dean at regular intervals, but not saying anything. Dean unloaded his shopping, flirted with the girl behind the register, and then packed away his steaks, his pasta, his favorite beer, breakfast cereal he had never had before, organic milk he didn't know existed, and caviar.
“Oh god, what if he dies?” Sam said, and then he was crying. Jessica wrapped her arms around him and he fell into her. She kissed his hair. She looked at Cas, her eyes shining with pity.
Cas smiles at him, “not yet, she has another semester to go. Why do you think she’s working at the café? She has to pay tuition.”
When Cas rises, Dean’s not sure what let him know it was time. But he joins, and they walk back towards the car.
Eames doesn’t elaborate. When they turn off the M25 and onto winding countryside roads, when the roar of traffic fades away and all he can hear is the hum of the engine, he closes his eyes for a moment and wonders when the last time it was that he went driving, just for the hell of it. Just for the feeling of it. He can’t remember.
of yours?” He said ’fiat’ like it was a dirty word. He never said dirty words like they were dirty words. ”This is how a car is supposed to sound.”
Dean’s house smelled of coffee, wood, leather. Perhaps it would one day smell of books too. Perhaps one day Cas would cram his many volumes into the rickety bookcases in the living room. Perhaps he could have a study. The guest room was barely used, Dean had said. They could paint it. His desk would fit. They could buy more shelves, they could put fairy lights in the garden.
“I wish I had real problems,” he tells the car. “Cas has real problems. If I had real problems, all of this might make sense.”
Katie’s fun, even though Dean doesn’t understand what she’s saying half the time. When he gives her blank looks, she just laughs and repeats herself. She makes appreciative noises over the Impala, calls his wiring “interesting”, then shows him the Model A she has tucked away in an empty barn.
He hurries past the people in the hallway and out the open door, heart hammering in his chest. He doesn’t stop until he’s sitting in the Impala, hands on the wheel, hysteria rising in his throat.
Dean had been twelve when he drank his first beer, sitting on the hood, his dad beside him and the sun beating down on the top of his head. He had coughed and wanted to spit it out, cold and foamy and bitter, but he had forced it down and his dad had grinned at him.
The auto shop is dark and locked when he arrives, fifteen minutes before opening time. He unlocks the office door and turns on all the lights, tries to find signs of catastrophe. There’s a pile of opened and unfolded bills on one side of the computer keyboard, with a sticky note on top reading, in Ricky’s handwriting: “John, all of these before Sept.”
. He remembered loud music and the sound of an engine and thinking that he was so, so lucky. He remembered feeling scared and wanting and not daring to ask but saying yes, yes, yes. He remembered stubble burn and arguing and dancing and slamming doors and blue eyes and bad TV and good books and nails digging into his back and rings.
He grabs for Cas again, but Cas, smile so soft, eyes so goddamn understanding, crinkling as his eyebrows pull together and down, squeezed his arms and leads Dean to the bed.
They drive in silence for a little while, Cas murmuring directions out of Leatherhead and onto the A24.
Ricky shakes his hand firmly on his last day, and invites him to come over for dinner “literally, any time.”
The room is getting darker, a muted red folding like waves in through the window behind the bed, falling across Cas’ face. Dean presses the heels of his hands into his eyes but when he looks again Cas is still there, lit up and pulling Dean’s boxers the rest of the way off, and then his own jeans and underwear so quick and perfunctory in comparison to how he’s touching Dean and that hurts too – everything goddamn hurts.
A man comes out of a swinging door behind the counter, wiping his hands on a towel, looking calm but like he hasn’t slept well lately.
He texts John to let him know he’s back and will be coming into work in the morning. There’s no response, but he doesn’t care much. The taxi drops him off outside of his little house is Scottsbluff, which looks sad and dark. The yard is completely overgrown, his post-box hangs off its hinges.
“I’m really in love with him. Stupidly in love with him. And I miss him. I wish I’d never come back so I could still be with him. But I also wish I’d never gone there and we’d never have met.”
He didn't like champagne very much. In fact, he didn't like it at all. But, as the best man, he was required to have at least one glass since it was the 'classier choice'. He'd
He was standing in the parking lot somehow. Next to a Volvo. Dean would have scoffed at it. “Useless cars,” Cas could still remember his voice. How long would that last? When would he start to forget? Sam was going home to a house filled with life soon. Cas would be going– Except for what was in their suitcases all of Dean’s possessions were in their house. Dean’s house. No, Cas’ house. Because Dean was dead and he left him the house. Cas would be going back to the empty rooms and the wild garden. He could almost feel the grass under his feet. Could see the vines growing, growing out of control, the leaves falling off the trees and the trunks twisting in on themselves, the fruit rotting, the flowers bleeding, the house creaking under a massive weight. The rooms would whisper to him. The floors would ask, where is he?
Dean stays in the garage, staring at the mess of the Impala, his arms crossed tight across his chest. The ghost of a hand still weighs on his shoulder, making him feel lopsided and achy.
Meg meets them at the door, dressed in all leather. She stares Dean up and down. Behind her, a strobe light is gliding across the room, and the place is already full of people. The music spilling out onto the sidewalk is something with a loud, slow base and what sounds like an electric violin.
“Please, stop bullshitting me,” Dean says, hating that it sounds like he’s begging, “just tell me the fucking truth.”
Talbot powers on, “I can’t talk long, I’m just calling to make sure you’re home this afternoon, the car’s gonna be delivered to your front door, and there’s a paper you have to sign that it’s arrived in the expected condition.”
“Not right now, obviously,” Sam continues, “it’ll be years before I’m settled in a job, and Eileen is about to be promoted, but you know I’ve always wanted a real–“ He stops, and then hurries on. “A big family.”
“What?” Dean says, poised to argue and a list of contingency plans for how he can do this, how he can afford it, ready at the back of his throat.
Dean shifted his weight from foot to foot. "You sure? You look a little…" He didn't know how to finish that sentence so he just made a vague hand movement of the general 'not good'-variety.
Sam makes hot cocoa again. They sit, quiet, on the sofa together, listening to the house creak, to a car pass, to a neighbour mowing their lawn. Dean’s staring at a crack in the wall he’s been wanting to fix. He wonders when next he’ll have money to renovate, when next he’ll have time to.
Dean looked at Sam, whose jaw was clenched tight and whose sympathetic look left Cas for a moment to glance at him. He looked at the bruise at Castiel's cheek.
It was an even more unpleasant experience to wake up, be immediately blinded by the bright, white lights of a hospital room and then realize he had absolutely no idea why he was there.
Dean clinked their beers together, or rather, nudged Cas’ beer with his own a couple of times insistently. “Dude, you’re getting a PhD. I care about anything that lets me brag about you.”
“Oh, uh,” Dean says, “It’s going okay. Believe it or not, this place isn’t a mechanic’s dream, but I think I have some leads.
At Taste Buds, Cas hovers around him on the pretence of refills, really leaning over his shoulder while he reads the last couple of chapters of Jailbird.
Dean wants to stand, wants to walk over to Cas and embrace him and assure him, but he doesn’t move. Cas isn’t done yet.
When the last of the cobwebs are up, Cas takes Dean’s hand and leads him into the storage room, where he presses Dean up against a shelf of baking supplies and kisses him until he can’t breathe.
A wounded sound made it’s way out of Dean’s throat and he covered his face with his hands– there was the wedding ring, gleaming dully under fluorescent lights. Cas went to him. He tangled their fingers together –
. It was okay though, he'd already bribed one of the caterers to set aside some beer for him in the fridge, he'd go get it once he finished this awful glass of champagne. Why any drink should be held in a glass he could easily crush in one hand was beyond him. But, of course, it was
Then he’s knocking on the door anyway, and Talbot is telling him to come in. It’s one of the endless lounges in the damn manor, and Eames passes Dean in the door with a nod in his direction. Talbot is sitting on a sofa with his laptop open, typing rapidly, doing whatever work it is that rich people do to keep being rich.
When he wakes up, it’s dark outside. According to his watch, it’s mid-afternoon in Nebraska. He turns on the lights in the room, which just casts long shadows across the mass of empty floor. In the en-suite, he washes his face and neck, and drinks water from the tap, avoiding his own eyes in the mirror. He feels jittery and out of place, like it’s too quiet, or he’s being too loud.
“It’s okay if you are,” Sam says, insistently, like he’s rehearsed it. “I get that you’re the reason I could leave. You did all the work and gave me all the options, and I just took them.”
“Please,” Dean scoffs, “For one thing, we live on different continents. For another, I’ve got all of this shit going on, and– and honestly he has his own shit to deal with.”
“Kid,” Talbot says, still not looking at him, “you would have to buy so much cocaine for me to even notice the money missing.”
Dean was still muttering to himself, looking on edge and uncomfortable. Cas made him leave the bag on the kitchen counter then grabbed his hand. He looked sad.
”Well.” Dean cleared his throat. ”Of course you do, everyone should, it’s a fucking awesome car. Not everyone does, though. Some people think it’s… you know… out of style. Unreliable. Rude.”
“You’re gonna wear sweater vests and glasses and be mister professor guy until I make you retire and I’m gonna yell at kids to get off my lawn.”
He doesn’t buy any more alcohol. He also doesn’t sleep. Every night he lies awake and shakes like he has a fever, worried he might be dying. Sam doesn’t say anything about it, just walks with him past those aisles in the grocery store and sneaks more lettuce into his cart.
Sam didn’t answer. Cas would have looked at him but he was caught staring at a thin, wispy cloud hovering close to the horizon. He wished it was night. Or at least raining, storming, savagely wrecking.
When he opens the door, Gabriel waves at him, “the car’s looking good,” he calls, and irritation rises quick in Dean.
But Cas is saying “wait, wait,” and “it’s okay,” and holding his face and saying “I’ve got you” and Dean doesn’t want to ask if he really believes that, if it's really true, but those questions are pushing against the back of his teeth so instead he says “where” and starts reaching for the bedside table.
John backhands him. Dean’s not ready. He falls to the side, knocking his hip into the coffee table, the pile of bills toppling over onto the floor, and catches himself on his elbow.
