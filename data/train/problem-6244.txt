“Focus up.” Steve called, waiting for his team’s attention before continuing, “Thor and Iron Man keep the perimeter. Spider-man, I want you to figure out where those..
“I wasn't planning on becoming a Capsicle again,” Rogers huffed out a laugh, “But if I do, I trust you’ll give me the
Maybe he would let Peter take one of his less intimidating cars out for a spin in the parking lot. May
“You’re killing me, Steve. There’s no way I’m reaching across the Grand Canyon every twenty seconds to give you a bite of this,” Tony waved the sorbet in the air, “I thought you were my shoulder to cry on?”
“I’ve got the hard drive,” Natasha patted the rectangular form sitting in her apron’s pocket, “But we’ve got to move, now.” She threw open the window and secured their rope. Tony reached forward, but Natasha intercepted his wrist. “I’ll go first.”
. Admittedly, it had been some time since he’d gone on a date, let alone dated someone. When he took a client out to a luncheon he brought Thor along, who swept Mr. and Mrs. Pavelski off their feet, and somehow made the business lunch
That only left a handful of people. He couldn’t ask Pepper, that was an even bigger no-no for separate reasons. Rhodey and Carol were obviously not a choice. Clint was a big no, no explanation needed. Natasha would never agree unless his life were in danger. Bruce, well, as annoying as they were, he wasn’t trying to unleash the Hulk on a bunch of paparazzi. And he wasn’t quite on that level with the other Avengers to ask them to fake date him.
Just as Tony started to eat, a finger tapped on his shoulder and someone cleared their throat. Tony looked over his shoulder to see two girls, college aged, looking at the two of them with sheepish but bright eyes.
Steve’s hands came to rest on Tony’s ankles, and for a second he considered asking him. They got along well enough, more than well enough actually. If there was anyone who could make this situation fun, it would be Steve. They already spent enough time together, it wouldn’t disrupt their schedules. And maybe a small part of him wanted to hold Steve’s hand out in public for the whole world to see, to take him out to art museums and not have to pretend like he was staring at the painting when he was really staring at Steve, to invite him out to galas as more than a plus one, to dance and go home with him and not go their separate ways at the end of the night—
and productive. When Thor travelled to New Mexico to visit friends, Tony tagged along and ended up spending the weekend picking apart Jane Foster’s head and enjoying a comfortable back and forth with Darcy. Whenever he wanted to go out, he had someone to keep him company
He came to an abrupt stop as he crashed into Thor’s arms, covered in ropey, green acid. He looked back at the two halves of the parasite, it’s legs twitched for a few more seconds before it finally stopped moving.
Tony winked back at him, “Funny you say that. I have a proposition for you.” He rolled off the couch and knelt on one knee. He cleared his throat before meeting Thor’s amused eyes, “What do you say we make things official and stick it to the man?”
“Hey, do you want to help me teach DUM-E how to write the rest of the alphabet?” Tony blurted out, “After you taught him how to write his name he’s been practicing,” he continued, the heat rising up his neck as Steve kept staring, “He can hold a pencil without breaking it and, um, he doesn’t tear the paper anymore, so,” he trailed off.
“Clint, keys,” Natasha ordered, and Clint nodded, heading towards the valet to grab their car. The two of them stood near the entrance, far enough away not to be recognized, but close enough to hopefully not look suspicious. Tony tried his best not to look like an injured man on the run, but it was hard to remain inconspicuous when it felt like his chest was caving in.
“Hey. We’re not done here.” His tone was light enough that Steve didn’t think that meant he was looking forward to being chewed out, but hopefully he’d have a chance to actually explain himself.
, you don’t happen to be related to these guys?” Tony could hear the smirk on Sam’s face, “Can’t you coo at them and tell them to fly back to wherever they came from?”
make me spell it out for you, Stark.” Bucky groaned, “I’ve got a lot of money riding on this and I am
“Always happy to meet fans,” Tony added once he managed to swallow without choking himself. He stood next to Thor as one of the girls pulled out her phone and switched it to the front camera. Tony wrapped his arm around Thor’s shoulder and smiled brightly as the girl started taking rapid fire photos.
Spider-Man, Ant-Man, Wasp, and Black Widow at some point deemed themselves the “Bug Avengers”. Tony tried to argue that if Peter was wearing the Iron Spider suit, then he belonged in the “Iron Fam” with him and Rhodey, but after discussion they rebranded as “Team Power Armor” to include Sam since “Bird-vengers” disassembled as soon as Clint suggested it. Steve took pity on the archer and dragged him over to join the two super-soldiers’ sparring match.
And then Bucky’s lips were on his. For a second it was just lips pressed together, Bucky making no further move to deepen it. Only when Tony finally caught up and pressed back did it turn from a brief touch to downright sinful. Bucky kissed like he fought—ruthlessly, like his life depended on it. He bit Tony’s bottom lip, eliciting a moan from him before he licked his way inside of Tony’s mouth. Their tongues twisted, Bucky’s running across the top of Tony’s mouth, sending a shiver down his spine. He pulled away in favor of nipping down his jaw and neck, his hand running along his ribs, the other fisted in his hair, pulling his head back to bare his neck as if they weren’t in the middle of a crowded room. He sucked a spot right below Tony’s ear, teeth scraping against the sensitive skin before returning back to his mouth. Tony moaned something whiny and high in the back of his throat as Bucky wedged a leg between Tony’s thighs.
Clint had an actual birdbrain or missed out when they were handing out self-preservation at birth; it was the only reason he would have thought shoving an exploding arrow into the creature's mouth was a good idea. There wasn't even a second for Tony to berate Clint for being an idiot. A blast of orange flame and smoke erupted, a stark comparison to the white and gray snowscape of New York, and Clint's purple form was falling out of the creature's hold. Tony redirected all his power to his boots in a futile chase after him, but a moment later Clint hit the river with a
“Well, looks like the vultures have found us,” Tony motioned to where a group of men with cameras were trailing them, “That’s our cue.”
The door to the kitchen swung open and a server nearly ran into Natasha. The server’s eyes widened, darting between them, “Che sta facendo?”
“I’m not—you did nothing wrong. I’m just…working through some things.” He said with a sigh. “I think I’m going to head to bed.”
As tired as Tony felt, he doubted his mind would let him fall asleep if he laid down right now. His thoughts kept drifting back to Peter. He shook his head. There was no way he was sleeping.
“Rise and shine, Spidey-Boy!” Tony flipped on the lights as he entered, making a b-line towards the lump of sheets and blankets in the middle of the bed. “Wakey wakey, no eggs and bakey. Unless you ask Cap nicely, he—Jesus, what happened?”
“What?” Rogers’ eyes darted between the two of them. His hand squeezed his for a second before he dropped it, like he had forgotten it was there in the first place.
“Couple of days.” Tony answered, poking at the coffee machine in hope that it would brew faster, “Why, are you trying to be his rebound?”
“Steve was busy,” Ouch, “And you know the layout better than any of us. We’re counting on you to maneuver us discreetly while inside.”
Tony started searching around the room for a spare key, or anything he could use to pick the lock. “I’m at the panel but it’s going to be a minute.” He said, pressing on the comm unit in his ear.
“Speaking of sleep,” Steve tugged gently at Tony’s sleeve—the same blue dress shirt he wore last night, “When was the last time you got some?”
The images of Rogers a sweaty mess, pinning Tony against the gym mats suddenly rushed to the forefront of his mind.
Natasha circled around Bucky, eyes narrowed, feet slinking like a cat hunting its prey. Bucky remained planted in the center of the circle, head barely turning but his eyes remained locked on Natasha with ice-cold intensity.
“Anyway, I think I’m going to head home.” Bucky grasped his shoulder and squeezed, “If you break his heart, I’ll personally make sure all your coffee is decaffeinated for the rest of your life.”
Steve was at his side a second later, hesitantly reaching for Tony’s hand. His thumb swept across his knuckles and paused. A
Bucky, already in the kitchen and digging through the fridge, replied without missing a beat. “Yeah, just dropped him off at his workshop.”
Bucky’s mouth dropped open in disbelief and sat stunned in silence for a moment before taking off after Sam. Tony turned to Steve, the man seemingly unbothered by the interaction before him.
,” Tony half crawled, half dragged himself away from the toothy maw of the parasite, “I’m tapping out. Hawkeye, you’re in.”
Tony looked up and met Rogers’ concerned gaze. “Don’t worry Cap, I have at least 30 seconds before I go into cardiac arrest,” A twisting pain shot through his chest, “Give or take a couple seconds.”
I was. Watching you kiss everyone in front of me.” Steve opened his eyes to meet Tony’s. His head was still reeling from the past 24 hours, not at all recovered from the emotional whiplash he’d just endured.
Tony, also without hesitation, aimed his repulsors towards the cans and shot them just as they hit Rorgg in the face.
Tony sat stock-still, eyes darting between Steve’s. His questioning expression slowly morphing to hesitant disbelief reminded Steve of the slow cranking gears of an old clock.
Steve threw his shield at Peter, catching him in his shoulder. Peter shot a web to Steve’s face, pulling him in and sending him right back with a kick to the chest. Steve’s cowl flew off. He gripped his shield a little tighter.
“I’m sorry Captain, Boss—” Steve barely managed not to flinch as Friday’s lilting voice echoed around the room. “local authorities are requesting the Avengers.”
“Oh, nothing.” Natasha smirked. As if on cue, Clint rolled up to them, barely stopping the car long enough for them to get in.
He stepped out of his suit, the air immediately freezing in his nose as he dropped to his knees and dragged Clint’s head back. He listened for a few seconds, watching Clint’s chest for any sign of movement, but his body remained frozen still. Tony clamped his hands over his prone body and began chest compressions, willing his heart to beat again. He huffed out, his hands moving in a steady rhythm even after Clint's sternum cracked under his fists.
“Of course. Perhaps this time you’ll be able to keep up.” Thor teased. Not a second later he took off, his hammer swinging wildly in front of him.
The lights had returned and the heavy footfalls of guards sweeping through the estate echoed. A group of guards exited through the front, passing by the valet and fanning out in all directions, a pair of guards heading right towards them.
It’d be a good opportunity to really test out some of the new features of his suit in a safe environment. Plus, he’d feel much better about sending him out into the world with a little formal training in his back pocket.
That seemed to open the floodgates. As they finished their food and walked through the park they were stopped four more times. It was barely a nuisance, as Tony had grown up with this kind of attention, but a few flashes of light in the of the corner of his eye meant the paparazzi were starting to gather, and as much as he loved meeting new people and making their day, he hated the paparazzi more.
Steve had his Captain America face on, which meant Tony could either surrender or Steve would make him surrender.
“Hold on, you have something—” Thor reached over and swiped his thumb over Tony’s bottom lip, pulling it away to reveal a smear of ketchup.
“That’s better than nothing,” Steve replied, “Thor, think you can hold the perimeter? We could use an assist from Iron Man.” He eyed where a block away another of Clint’s explosive arrows exploded in a column of fire.
The jealousy dissipated, leaving him with a heavy feeling of defeat. “I was yapping your ear off for months. God, Buck. You should have just told me.”
Tony let himself be pushed onto the couch. His placidness was only surface level—his spine remained taut as he sat, his mind wracked with worry as his thoughts raced. He had been away from Peter for a couple hours, and even though he saw him for a couple minutes and was considerably less panicky than he was this morning, he still worried. He wondered if he had slept the whole time or if he had been woken up by another fit of coughs, if Bucky had taken his temperature or Bruce stopped in to take his vitals. He had to call May and update her, maybe see if she wanted to take him up on that offer to fly her back home—
Tony took off after him. Thor was already a small dot in the distance, his form disappearing into the clouds. Friday helpfully displayed his current speed in the corner of the HUD, clocking in at just below Mach 2.
It had been a tentative acquaintance for the longest time. He spent years of navigating a tumultuous relationship before he gained Tony’s full trust. After his more romantic feelings started to develop he didn’t bother letting them come to surface out of fear of losing a friend. If he would have told Tony that he loved him and the sentiment wasn’t shared, well, he wasn’t sure if it would be worth potentially endangering their friendship.
In a moment of confidence, or maybe post-battle exhaustion, Steve surged up to kiss Tony. Their mouths met at an awkward angle, noses bumping and beards chafing sharply against each other. Tony’s hands flew up and gripped at Steve’s shoulders, tightening as he tried not to fall over due to either surprise or the sheer force of Steve’s face colliding with his.
Pepper seemed satisfied for the moment, and let out a sigh, “Good. I see any more scandals this week and you’re presenting at the next board meeting for me.”
He continued, flipping through a couple holograms without an apparent rhyme or reason, “Anyway, what brings you down here, Cap?”
“Let’s get this show on the road, unless you’ve got one hundred thousand euros to spare.” Clint said tightly.
and of course Thor was seen out with Bruce in the city around the same time, and of course it was all an elaborate plan so they could dine in peace.
“No, I mean,” Bucky paused briefly, closing his eyes and pinching the bridge of his nose, “I’m sorry, Steve. I shouldn’t have kissed Tony.”
“One of those was actually for me.” Steve said lightheartedly, stepping close enough so as Tony spun his knees knocked into his legs, stopping his movement. Tony stared up a him with a frown while raising the mug back up to his mouth.
Steve must have looked as confused as he felt because Bucky fixed him with a patient stare. “I think half of New York knows about your crush on Stark. You think it’s time maybe someone clue him in on it too?”
She silently led them out of the study and towards a floor overlooking the ballroom. There were plenty of people milling around with drinks in their hands, a low murmur filling the space as people chatted amongst themselves. In the front of the room was a small stage. A small podium sat in the corner, but in the center was a table illuminated with spotlights, lined with various items ready to be auctioned off. There on the end sat a silver hard drive, identical to the one that was supposed to be sitting in the storage room.
Clint made an impatient noise, jolting Tony out of his head. The image of a sweaty Steve Rogers pinning him down on the gym floor lingered for a moment before he physically shook the thought back.
As soon as Bucky landed the Quinjet safely they were jumping through the small gaps of the webbing and headed into town. The distinct explosion of one of Clint’s explosive arrows was followed by a groan from the archer.
Steve’s face was suddenly a few inches away from him. Tony could see him, but it was hard to get a good look at him in the midst of the chaos.
The memory of Thor dipping Tony in a heated kiss in the middle of battle and Bucky not an hour ago pressing Tony against a wall with a possessive hand around his neck barraged his mind once again.
you can do,” Steve said from the couch, not even looking up from his book. Tony shook his head and paced across his workshop.
.” Clint wiggled his eyebrows at him. Tony tried not to smile as Clint was sent into another coughing fit, gripping his chest.
“It’s enough to keep lingering eyes away,” Natasha said with a finality in her voice. “We just need to get into the storage room in the back manor. I can get through the front and sneak you in through one of the upper levels. If we stick to the plan, the disguises won’t be more than an extra failsafe.”
“Peter, can you press your chin to your chest and tell me if you get a shooting pain up your neck?” Bruce asked, calm as ever. Steve was already digging through the en suite bathroom closet for cleaning supplies. Peter did as he was told, holding his chin there for a few seconds, and shook his head. Bruce released a breath Tony didn’t know he was holding.
“If I don’t love you, then who does? Pepper and Rhodey like you as friends, but even they’re not around you long enough to really love you. The Avengers certainly don’t love you. Get this in your mind they came back because they missed their old lives in America. They didn’t come back for you. Steve doesn’t love you. He’s merely keeping up pretenses because he knows his image can’t suffer another blow like it did last year,” he explained.
Without saying anything, Bucky went toward Steve and motioned that he sit down. Steve complied and at the instruction seemed to slouch into himself. Bucky went to the stash of medical supplies they always had on hand in the gym and knelt by Steve. He took Steve’s hand in his and went about unwrapping the wrap and applying antiseptic wipes to Steve’s cuts. Bucky remained silent as Steve tried to control his breathing.
Everyone soon took defensive stances. The man backed up and raised his hands. “Okay everyone let’s calm down now.”
The two of them broke apart briefly, after hugging and Steve clasped his hand warmly on Peter’s shoulder and taking one of the two bags from Peter’s hands.
He began to wonder whether he was missing something important or had forgotten that somehow had plans tonight. Either way he kept going, briefly looking down at his phone and unlocking it to see that his text to Steve had still gone unanswered. He had checked in to make sure that the boys had made it back home safely and Steve had assured him they had. But when Tony followed up with asking them what they wanted to have for dinner, there was silence.
“I sure did miss you, when I came back to the hotel,” Ryder rasped. “I saw bodies lying all over the building, but my main concern was finding you. It nearly broke me, when I found out that you were gone.
“That’s okay,” Steve said as he wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist and pulled him closer to himself. He tightened his grasp when Tony tilted his head to rest between Steve’s collarbone and his chin.
“No, Tony that’s not silly. It’s okay to feel hopeful. I mean I’m not going to lie and say I’m Rogers’ biggest fan right now. However, I will admit that he’s…” Rhodey winced as though not wanting the following words to come out of his mouth. “Adecentguy.”
Steve had extensively read over all of the material, in hopes of it being used just in the wonderful case of Ryder slipping and revealing his true identity. Steve had dreamed of that moment, ever since it was said that he would be arriving. So now he held the sleek black folder in his hands, some of the information redacted, but Steve remembered it all.
The tips of Harley’s ears turned a bright red as he looked down at their joined hands. He tried stuttering out a response. Julie smiled mischievously.
Tony sighed. “I know, but Peter you are also a young teenage boy. This is a lot. You’re right it is a responsibility, but making sure that you’re getting good rest and making it to your classes on time is also a huge responsibility. How about later on we try to work something out that doesn’t involve you getting fined for truancy and having teachers give out bad grades due to your tardiness.”
Tony’s eyes widened at the question. “Of course I like Ryder Pep. I wouldn’t be dating him, if I didn’t.”
“But no honestly May, Peter will be protected as if he were my own. I have eyes on him always and that’s not going to change. I’ll make sure he doesn’t get into any harm, while webbing it up.”
Tony waved his hand in the air, “Oh there’s not much left. Just wanted to say a special thank you shout out to the man of the hour, MVP of my heart, apple of me eye, the one who’s managed to give me the most satisfying orga-”
And then Isak smirked, something so unique to Ryder. It was a smirk that lifted first on the left corner, before sliding down to become an even smile.
Natasha looked up and Tony missed the way she frowned at the others, each sending back their own varying levels of that same serious expression. When he looked up, all their expressions had been smoothed over and Natasha was handing Tony a Lego block.
“Yeah, look I…can we talk when I get back. I have to meet someone really quick,” Tony kissed him on the cheek. “Glad you could make it though. You can sit down in my seat. I’ll be right back.”
“Crap, sorry. Fuck, I’m messing things up again,” Tony bemoaned. “Fuck, can’t ever get things right. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Sure, makes this wish that you hadn’t found me? Don’t need a sarcastic asshole back, am I right?”
He did this a few more times, before Miles started laughing. Tony turned shocked eyes to Bucky who was looking on with amusement.
Steve tried swallowing down the urge to throw up and tear Tony away from Ryder’s grip. He tried to cease the burning in his chest and the desire to pull Tony into his arms. He didn’t want Tony to be leaning on Ryder for support. He didn’t want to see this and he hated that he was led here. He hated that he was seeing Tony’s eyes look up at Ryder in wonder before settling on Steve.
“You’re been ignoring my calls. I even tried seeing if Pepper had been in contact with you, but no surprise there you’ve been shutting us out.”
His shaking hands wanted to soothe the bruises left behind, he wanted to kiss every trace of visible skin and mutter praises into them. He wanted to offer comfort to Tony, hold him in his embrace and be a steady presence behind him.
Tony’s mouth began to tremble and he felt confused. He wanted to leave and he didn’t want his mind games. He didn’t know what Ryder’s intent was, but he wasn’t here for it. Ryder had never acted like this before.
“Then what Steve? Tell me. Because people keep on leaving and I must be doing something wrong. So help me Steve. What have I done so wrong in the past few weeks to get you to leave?” Tony finally whispered growing closer to Steve. “Why are you leaving me?”
“Are you gentleman alright?” Harry asked as he motioned for one of the other waiters to set down their meals at their appropriate spots.
He leaned over and began dry heaving at the point, trying to control his sobs as he heard the door open. He muffled his noises with the back of his hands, ignoring how the tears felt hot on his skin. The door to his stall opened.
Tony’s body went pliant as Steve laid him down. Steve left for a second to gather something more fitting than the hospital gown that they had placed on Tony’s body. He reached in for some warm pajama pants and a hoodie, both of which helped with the coldness that Tony might wake up feeling.
“The only cool thing about you,” Michelle dryly said leaning forward on her elbows. “Since you’re going home can I have your lunch?”
Steve threw up into the wastebasket that was brought in as a precaution after Tony’s accident. All of the morning’s contents and acid flew outside of him. Hot scorching tears burned bright at his eyes.
Steve was unsure that Tony would feel comfortable about leaving Miles in his care. While he felt there wasn’t as much hostility between the two as it had been, he knew that Tony still did not truly trust him especially with his son, especially not to watch him for that long.
Steve couldn’t help, but to let a small breath of laughter escape his lips. At that noise, Tony turned sharply to him.
“Again, something that we will have to seriously discuss when you come back,” Bruce said suddenly looking tired.
“Yeah, that’s what you all keep telling me,” Tony said as though that fact alone scared him. “And what if I told all of you and you would see just how…just how weak I am. I mean Steve I can’t handle being in an enclosed room. My body is always cold. Every single time a nurse comes in I think it’s someone from the CMPNY because they’re essentially doing the same thing, just pocking and prodding. And I should get over this, right? I’m a Stark. I’m Iron Man. This…this shouldn’t phase me.”
“Isak was his brother. Apparently, Ryder was driving the car overturned and Ryder passed on impact,” Bucky explained.
Tony of course at the time was so focused on returning to business with SI and trying to spend as much time with the kids as possible that he hadn’t even realized that a third date was coming, until Clint had mentioned it off handedly. And that was when things went…well either laughably or horribly wrong.
“Mhm,” Steve said, finger pressing slightly into the space there where lube and Steves’ cum was leaking out. Tony’s mouth parted and he shifted one leg over Steve’s waist.
All throughout the story, Tony’s back grew tense and his fingers were now clutching the bowl of soup tightly. It was as short and abrupt as the end of his friendship with Ryder had truly been.
With hesitation lacing his body, he blinked his eyes open. They settled on the darkness first then to the source of light coming from his windows. He breathed out a sigh of relief. He craned his neck to pinpoint more familiar points in his room.
Steve didn’t stop his movements. He continued running his fingers through his hair, occasionally placing a straying curl behind his ear. While doing this, Steve wondered if he should try bringing up what made Tony go into that panic attack again. He didn’t want to disturb this peace blanketing him, but he also wanted to be the one that helped Tony.
“No, it’s fine Tony. Look I’ve just been stressed. Some of the treatments aren’t working on the kids down here and I’m putting all my negative feelings on you. That’s isn’t fair,” Ryder confessed.
He had promised Ryder he would be patient with him. So what if somedays Ryder just tended to be a little rough. He at least apologized and thanked Tony for being so patient and understanding with him.
“What are you going to do now cry and bitch like a baby? We already have one in the house for a few weeks. We don’t need another. I’m going out. I’m on call for the night shift. When I come back from the hospital please look somewhat decent,” Ryder said.
“Steve,” Tony’s voice sand out. His hand detached from the bed and wrapped into Steve’s hair. Steve took more of Tony into his mouth, bright blue eyes heatedly blinking at Tony. Tony gulped some air into his throat, head falling back onto the pillow.
“Okay, Rhodey. My sunshine. My honey bear. The straw to my berry. The apple to my pie. The peanut to my butter.”
That was the only way Steve and the others had agreed to putting Tony in the room with Ryder alone. Tony had argued his case, saying Ryder was much more likely to say it was him, if he felt that it was only Tony. Add the others and you would just get defensive statements.
The doors closed to Ryder’s manic screaming and pleading that Tony would come back for him. Steve continued walking away, until he saw a familiar face being brought in by two guards. Her face was stretched into a somber expression, mouth pressed into a line sharp enough to cut through ice.
“Uh, guys? I think I found the source of the webs.” Peter unsteadily said over the comms. A yelp followed and Steve looked overhead to see a flash of red and blue flung through the air, crashing through the roof of a small store.
Suddenly, Tony felt the need to apologize. He wasn’t sure what for, as long as Steve would stop looking at him like that. His stomach churned something uncomfortable, the space between them feeling more like an ocean than the width of the room.
Steve offered a weak smile. Thankfully, Bucky only shot him a questioning glance and continued to snack on his apple.
“I guess that makes us the Strongest Avengers.” Carol declared with an amused smile. Bruce winced as Thor tackled Carol to the ground, but bit down on a smile when Carol blasted the god into the ceiling and shot him a wink.
Steve threw his shield at the one closest to him and let out a huff as his shield bounced off it’s back instead of lodging into its body. The alien spider spun around, and Steve almost dropped his shield as he was met with human-like eyes and mouth.
Steve’s eyes flickered for just a moment but Tony, ever observant, followed his gaze to where Bucky was toeing at Rorgg’s unmoving head several meters away. Tony blinked, and then turned back towards Steve.
Without warning Natasha boosted Tony the rest of the way up, his hands barely catching the edge of the vent before she darted towards the server. With a kick to the face the server instantly fell limp to the floor.
Tony blinked, caught off guard this early in the morning. He hadn’t expected anyone to be awake at this hour—he usually wouldn’t be if he had gone to bed, but he spent the whole night trying to recover and rework his armor.
Thank you for all the love on the last chapter 💕This one is a short one, mostly due to Bucky's efficiency.
quite as platonic as it was, but if anything it looked fond. Not seductive or erotic like the tabloids usually spun it.
way!” Steve amended, “That would be hypocritical of me. What I mean is it’s weird to see two of my teammates dating.”
Peter emerged from the small shop he previously crashed through with an armful of metal cans. Without hesitation he flung them in the air, carefully aimed towards Rorgg, and shouted, “
Tony sighed and started shuffling his way through the air ducts. He headed towards the power room as stealthily as he could, struggling not to sneeze as he kicked up dust. His respect for Clint’s air vent adventures increased only slightly as he squeezed through the narrow ducts.
Steve raised his hands in a placating gesture, “I don’t—you don’t owe me an explanation for who you step out with.”
“It’s not too late to change your mind. I can still have you and May set up in a five-star resort in Morocco by five.”
With that, Clint sputtered underneath him, drawing in a deep breath and coughed water right into Tony’s face.
Even worse, what if he did finally tell Tony how he felt about him and Tony just…treated him like everyone else. His feelings ran too deep for something casual. If he kissed him as easily as he kissed Clint, Nat, or Thor, he imagined it wouldn’t be a dissimilar feeling to dismissing his feelings. Not that Steve thought Tony would ever be careless with his emotions on purpose, but Tony would jump to one night stands or a quick fling before ever entertaining the idea of a long term relationship.
That much was obvious. Most of them couldn’t get close enough in fear of getting swallowed to help. They had tried Steve’s shield, Thor’s hammer, Clint’s arrows. The parasite was impenetrable, and had a one track mind, unwilling to be distracted or led astray from its goal.
“I was wondering when my beloved would call.” Thor said wistfully with a mischievous twinkle in his eye.
“Yup. I even learned I still have a few nerve endings in my chest.” Rogers had the look he only got when he was about to insist that Tony go to medical and let someone check him over. “Don’t worry, it’s mostly superficial damage—some scuffs and bruises.” Tony dragged a hand over the blue and purple discoloring around the arc reactor before he dropped his hand and released his shirt from between his teeth.
With his attention in front of him he helped Natasha take down one of the spiders. The two of them joined up with Sam and quickly fell into a rhythm that seemed to be working. As Sam kept the other spiders distracted, Steve and Nat took out the singled out one before moving onto the next. It was slow going and his limbs were starting to grow heavy. Every so often he glanced up, seeing Tony and Bucky circling Rorgg without much progress. Clint and Thor remained quiet over the comms, but the occasional explosions were starting to dwindle, and Steve hoped that meant they were making progress and not that Clint’s arrow supply was running low.
It wasn’t like he had claim over Tony. No, he only had himself to blame. He knew it would have been stupid to assume that he was the only person attracted to Tony, but a part of him always hoped he would have been brave enough to be the first to admit his feelings.
“Captain America hasn’t committed any felonies,” Steve said seriously. Peter’s eyebrows shot up and Tony could see the apologies starting to poor out, but Rogers lip quirked up in a smile, “As for Steve Rogers, that’s a different story.”
Plus, he wasn’t trying to drag Steve’s name through the mud with him. Half of America would be on his front door step if he were to even lay a finger on America’s golden boy.
Tony scanned Peter’s face, but relented his search as he found no signs of bruising. “Try not to get snot on your suit.”
“You need a break, Peter’s room needs to be aired out, and I’m not letting you back in there until you look less like a ghost.”
Tony moved from Clint’s chest to his mouth, his lips already a dull shade of blue. He pinched his nose and quickly breathed two short breaths into his lungs.
He ground his teeth and decided it was now or never. He let out a muffled yell and forced himself through the bars, the metal caving into his chest with a pinching pain. He stumbled through the gate and barely kept his footing as he crashed into the electrical panel. The tight pain in his chest radiating with every breath.
Natasha braced herself against the wall and motioned for Tony to step onto her linked hands for a boost up, “Not a fan of Italian. Steve on the other hand—”
And between all that, Tony had remembered to leave time to eat and sleep. He was proud, to say the least.
Steve returned a few moments later with an ice pack in hand and a rumpled looking Bruce in tow. Steve pressed the cool pack into Tony’s hand and took a step back, allowing room for Bruce to brush past him.
“My head and neck really hurts, and I feel weak.” He said. Bruce mumbled something about blood samples and scans, but Peter suddenly swatted at Tony’s hand and sat up, his legs caught in the tangle of his sheets. He leaned over the bed and threw up next to Tony’s feet. Tony’s stomach churned at the smell, but he stayed put and rubbed Peter’s back as he heaved in a breath.
the time to panic, he scolded himself. But another look at Peter’s pale and limp form sent a dizzying wave of anxiety over him.
“Thank you.” He said simply. He ducked his head, overwhelmed by Steve’s gaze. The two words weren’t nearly enough to express what Tony was feeling.
Tony stilled, waiting to see if Thor would change his mind, or someone would mention it, but minutes passed and no one said anything. He relaxed further into Thor’s embrace, knowing that it was going to be a problem he would to have to acknowledge soon, brushing it off for his future self. This wasn’t real, he shouldn’t get to use to it—it all didn’t matter in the moment.
She only gave him that look when he had seriously messed up and would be paying in at least three new pairs of shoes and one board meeting
It was decided, he drowsily thought. He had to tell him. If his reaction tonight wasn’t proof enough that his feelings were starting to get out of hand, then he at least owed Tony the truth. And maybe it would help Steve move on if he laid it all out there. He’d been holding onto this secret for years. It was time he let it go.
Natasha packed away a dinner for Tony and set it in the refrigerator. No one had wanted to wake Tony up because what Peter had said was true. He did need sleep. Clint followed Natasha up to her room and asked if they could have a sleepover. Natasha pushed him out of his chair. Bucky had left the living room a few minutes ago to mediate for the night. It was something that his therapist suggested and something that Bucky had been trying to do daily.
“Tony is there anything you can give us to help us locate you. I mean we’re trying, we’ve followed your location and tried scanning your suit, but there’s a point that your location just gets lost,” Steve said disappointedly.
“We’ll play some more another time okay sweetheart. I think it’s time we head home,” Tony told him already calling Happy to pull around the car.
Steve knew that maybe he wasn’t ready to hear it. He wasn’t ready to hear that the man he loved could have been…
Steve smiled at her and chose to sit in the chair closest to his bed. Harley must have pulled it so it was directly beside his mom, but Steve chose to create a little distance for some breathing room.
He cleared his throat and played with the fabric of the blanket in his hands. “It was good. Things were fine. I mean we weren’t living in a nice house or anything…but the apartment we stayed at was nice. It was ours. Then mom met Jack. Jack’s pretty cool. They had my sister, she’s cool. I just don’t think I was in the cool factor.”
“There was a marathon. I merely suggested to Tony we could watch that, instead of him being holed up in his lab,” Natasha said. “But that’s not the point. I’m just saying I don’t think Ryder is the one for Tony.”
“Steve!” Bucky shouted as he watched the butter crackle and sizzle in the skillet. “You can’t just leave stuff unattended. What were you trying to make with butter?”
Tony started to lean into it, but just as he felt that unconscious response he pulled away. “You were going to get me another funnel cake either way. Also this time I will take a lemonade.”
“Again I’m sorry Ryder. I’ll make sure to answer your phone calls all the time from now on,” Tony said feeling the guilt begin to settle in. “Are you sure you don’t need to talk right now? I can step away for a bit.”
“Fine, but do not exert yourself. I don’t need you pulling stitches or anything. Natasha and Clint watch over him….actually Natasha please make sure Clint and Tony don’t manage to blow up the entire lab. You’re in control.”
The roof over the years had been a sort of escape for a lot of the team, so they had made it into a sort of outside patio. But tonight it had a magical aura to it. Fairy lights were strung like curtains, the glass table was covered with a thin sheet of champagne colored silk. In the middle of the table a bouquet of flowers were fixated. Plates of food were nicely already out and the smell was so enticing that Tony couldn’t help the response of his mouth watering.
“You’re right I’m ecstatic. I’m over the moon. It’ll be truly swell when I can truly court you without the added presence of Ryder,” Steve added.
Tony hummed and allowed his eyes to flutter close, safe in the comfort that Steve was beside him and not going anywhere. His eyes studied Tony’s sleeping features and he took comfort in seeing how the tension from telling the story was melting away. There was still a frown, but even that frown smoothed out as the minutes passed.
Tony left to go take a shower and Pepper collapsed into the chair beside Rhodey. “I’m so glad Steve texted everything is a go because I forgot being a licensed Tony-sitter is exhausting.”
“Pepper,” Tony admitted. He really hoped Pepper wouldn’t get mad at him for revealing this tidbit of information.
“We need medic now. He’s on something and I don’t know what,” Natasha said from her place on the floor, cradling Tony’s head on her lap. “He’s been muttering about this is a dream.”
Setting his mug of tea on Harley’s side table, he entered the fort they made. He had to note that each week it got increasingly better with its styling. They even started playing a soundtrack of calming instrumental music to filter in the room.
Steve had an internal debate with himself, before Peter snatched the phone out of his hands. “Good evening Dr. Ryder. How are you? Yes, I’m doing quite well. Look, Tony hasn’t been feeling all that well this morning. I’m afraid he’s caught something so that’s why he hasn’t been really able to answer your calls.”
Luka obeyed and grabbed Tony’s shoulders to push him down into the tub. Tony gasped his lungs filling with water. His vision became blank. His body came up.
When he looked back, both Clint and Bucky were looking at him solemnly. Steve offered a tentative smile which stuttered as soon as all the events that led him to here came rushing forward.
Steve took of his gloves and cracked his knuckles. “That’s all I need. If he arrives earlier than expected, I want you to tap on the window. Bucky, Natasha.”
“Yeah, it would,” Tony grinned, leaning back into Pepper’s arms. “I can’t wait. I’m like a nervous puppy though.”
“With the weather changing and people coming in and out looking to adopt it seems this little one has contacted pneumonia. And we’ve had doctors come out and the help you’ve sent is great, but it’s still hard taking care of one kid when you have so many to watch after, you know? I mean we’re not neglecting him and we’ve been helping him recover, but sometimes I think it would be better if he had a family whose sole purpose was providing for him and taking care of him when he’s sick.”
Tony laughed and smiled warmly at Steve. Steve tried everything to swallow down the cry that was crawling in the back of his throat. He felt his whole body become drained as he looked at the tired, yet hopeful expression of Tony.
A nudge to his ribs brought him out of his thoughts. He turned to face Bucky who was now looking at him with concerned filled eyes.
Steve nodded to himself, getting out of his chair and punching Isak straight clean across his face. He kept punching, until he felt blood come back on his hand. His hands pressed tightly against Isak’s throat and felt it spasm with how much he was trying to gasp for breathe.
Steve said this, but he really had no intention of moving. This was the most time he had spent with Tony in the past year and he wanted more of it. So he was genuinely surprised when Tony opened his mouth.
Ryder couldn’t touch him either. He couldn’t touch him, but when he got back and saw how bad he had been he would punish him. He couldn’t touch him. No one could touch him.
Tilting his head up to the ceiling, he let the water hit his neck. He let it wash away the bloody finger prints that had wrapped across his neck in Ryder’s last ditch effort to get a semblance of dominance.
Clint nodded his head slowly. “That’s good. Everything you know alright up there?” He tapped his temple.
Tony stood up offering Karen his hand in order to help pull her up. Karen followed him and they were led to one of the playrooms. The buildings were all placed up against the wall. The kids themselves were sitting down in the room, bodies full of unrestrained energy.
He knew that Tony just didn’t want to be seen being carried. He knew that at any moment, someone with a phone could take a picture and send it to some gossip magazine or something. So he knew where Tony’s concerns resided. He lifted an eyebrow and shrugged, the movement causing Tony to shift closer to Steve.
“You do the same,” Tony said. Then to Miles he went, “Alright let’s finish up on breakfast so we can get you to school.”
He had been certain that none of them would get back up again. He had been planning for it, but he was so thankful that they had gotten up. He didn’t want to think what would have happened if none of them had come back or even if one had come back. He wasn’t ready for a funeral.  He almost wanted to take a step back and just take another quick look around to make sure everyone was still physically okay.
Bucky watched as Steve grabbed pasta and put it dryly in the pan. His eyes widened and he hurriedly ran over to stop Steve from turning the stove on. He sent an internal thank you to FRIDAY for letting him know that Steve was attempting to cook.
“What terrible thing Steve,” Natasha whispered, wanting immediately to ask Steve what his love confession meant. But as much as she wanted to explore that she needed to know what Steve felt like he had to protect Tony from.
When they made it to the main floor where Bucky, Miles, and Harley were, the first thing Tony noticed was Miles adorably trying to keep himself awake. His body was slowly losing its upright position only to be jerked back when either Bucky or Harley gave a loud shout to the game. Miles’ eyes would the unfocusedly shoot between the two, before his eyelids fluttered close for a few seconds.
“Right, well I met Ryder at a college party, the first I ever went to. We talked and hung out a bit, but after that we didn’t really cross paths. I was disappointed,” he said amused at his past self. “I think I latched onto this idea that I could meet a friend so easily. I mean on the movies, it seemed so simple.”
“I’m gonna wake up baba now,” Miles said running away, before they were even able to register that he had hoped out of Natasha’s lap.
Ryder visibly grew nauseated and his mouth gaped open, finally coming to terms that Tony was being serious.
“Yeah, I have to go in a short bit so I can catch my flight. So I’ll say goodbye to Peter real quick and then I’ll let him know where you’re at,” May kissed Tony on the cheek and told him goodbye before walking to Peter and doing the same.
“Yeah and that makes me really excited just knowing that he feels the same way even if he hasn’t articulated that to me just yet. I can be a very patient man,” Steve proclaimed. “I mean I did stay in the ice for 70 years, so if that isn’t patience I don’t know what is.”
Tony rolled his eyes. “I give up. Natasha just make sure you tell whoever group leader they had, that you’ll be taking them. I don’t want a teenager having a heart attack because they think they’ve lost a kid.”
He tried staying awake. He used to be so good at it. He could stay up for nearly 72 hours without a nap, but now he struggled to stay awake for five minutes. He had taken to removing the patches himself and hiding them under the mattress. Cali helped him with that at least, but it didn’t help. From whatever pills they were giving him, the alcohol, and he knew that they probably placed something in his food, the little food that he received.
He lifted his eyes up. “But every time it felt like a lie, as the days went by. I’m so sorry. I’m so so sorry,” he said lip trembling. “I thought this is it another person in my life gone. And I got so angry. So angry that you never told us.”
Harley helped pour Miles some cereal and then poured some for himself. Seeing Tony and Steve come in, he hopped into his seat. He started to hungrily wolf down his meal.
“Yeah, I know. You two have always been my constant,” Tony smiled. “And so I think you two are honestly a part of why I started this non-profit. I had to step back and realize that I have had amazing resources to help me financially and more. And I just wanted to extend my resources to those that didn’t. I wanted to help people who felt like there was no help for them anymore.”
Sometimes Tony would admit to himself in the silence of his own thoughts that he wished he hadn’t asked FRIDAY to tell him what had happened to Ryder. He wondered if it would have been better to live in blissful ignorance of his ex’s death. But then again Tony wondered if he’d have been strong enough to live with the lagging fear of his presence, if he would constantly be questioning whether he was still alive and if his contacts could somehow break him out of the Raft.
Pepper narrowed her eyes and held her hand out. “And why did you not deliver this at the hotel we are staying out. Better yet how do you have our location after all?”
Tears now fell down in steady streams and Tony felt as though things were clearing from his chest. Even though Tony had visited this gravesite multiple times, the finality of today was finally getting to him. It seemed like Tony was finally able to acknowledge that it was time he let himself heal. He had done the process, but still a part of him had been hanging on to this part of Ryder.
“Shh, go to sleep,” Steve whispered while setting the halfway eaten bowl of spaghetti aside. “I don’t think Miles is letting you go anytime soon, so you might as well just go ahead and sleep here.”
“Shh sweetheart. I know it hurts. I know it hurts, but we’re gonna get you some medicine that will make you feel all better okay?” Tony whispered and attempted to keep his tone light. He knew they had medicine for this, but there was still this fear of whether he was doing things right.
Natasha began to notice the state of panic Steve was succumbing to. She knelt beside him and took her hand in hers. He thought he heard her telling him to mirror her breathing. He always found it funny, mirroring someone’s breathing. His eyes remained unfocused and he tried centering himself.
The girl slouched in her chair at Steve’s sharp tone. On any other day and speaking to any other person, Steve might have apologized.
He continued to sob into her neck, clawing his hands around her woolen sweater. The two melted into one another, grasping each other for comfort. Eva ran shaky fingers over his hair and then to his trembling hands, not minding her husband's hand's usual softness was a little callous and how he was missing the ring on his left hand.
“Of course you do, but you’re falling asleep Miles,” Tony whispered. “And you, Harley, bed by ten. Bucky if he goes to sleep later I will know and I will find you.”
“You killed me the day you refused to listen to me,” Ryder announced using one hand to play with the waistband of Tony’s boxers. “You killed me when you didn’t give me the chance to say goodbye or even tell you the reason I had to leave.”
“But sometimes it’s hard for me to think that I’ll ever just have this maternal nature. Kids are too fragile and they just need so much attention. I feel like I would crush them,” Natasha laughed, though it lacked any amusement. “I think I fit better as a part-time mentor than a mother.”
Steve shrugged. “I just wanted to give a nice Christmas gift. I mean I know it’s not enough to make up for the past year, but it’s something nice.”
“I told her that in confidence! Goodness, I can’t tell you two anything,” Rhodey sighed a smile gracing his features.
Yes, this is late. I apologize. I planned on updating last week but the site kept being down every single time I uploaded and I got frustrated and said f it. Then I re-read my chapter took it as a sign that wasn't my best work and re-wrote it. Personally, I am very glad I did and think you all will enjoy this chapter. (Also I will be getting to responding to comments soon!)
Tony pulled back to look at Steve, wanting that statement to be a promise. However, he struggled with himself seeing as though he hadn’t had the best luck with promises anymore.
A few minutes passed of this comfortable silence, before Tony muttered, “Close your eyes Steve and rest.”
Tony shrugged not wanting to explain himself to Natasha. “Doesn’t matter. Just no leaving notes or just tell them you went shopping.”
“I said no touching! Why doesn’t any…anyone listen? No touching. No touching. No more touching. Stop. Please stop touching,” he said wild eyes settling anywhere, but where Natasha was standing. “Go away. Ryder’s coming back. He’s…he’s coming. Have to…hafta be good so he doesn’t hurt my baby. Go away now. G’way.”
“Sorry. Sometimes he’s seriously like a panda bear just latching onto me like I’m bamboo, when he’s really tired,” Tony muttered as he sat down on the bed.
Clint had never seen Steve like this before and to say he was surprised would be too little of a statement. He had rarely even heard Steve curse before.
He drew with Miles and redirected questions of when his baba was coming. He watched Pepper try to hide her shaking shoulders, when he stumbled upon her one morning. She had hurriedly wiped at the running mascara, offered a shaky smile, and turned away.
Cool wind caressed Pepper’s cheek and she closed her eyes to bask in it. “This trip has been a welcome relief. Seriously, I think I was going to go lose my mind, if I had to keep entertaining those business investors in London. Half of them still question Tony’s capability to run the company. I almost accidentally tripped one.”
He heard a crunch and Isak barely winced, but instead smirked through it all, even as Steve’s grasp tightened around his neck.
Each apartment was beautifully made, with the intent to be a home for however long they needed it to be. Any changes could be made, once the families moved in. There were apartments specifically designated for those with younger children, the apartment being more childproof and closer to the childcare office.
“Hey, now don’t go doubting yourself. When you start doubting yourself, you lose focus of what you truly want. You remember when we went on missions with Howling Commandos we couldn’t let doubt cloud our thoughts because if we did one or all of us could die. Doubt here means you could lose Tony. So just…you know don’t do that,” Bucky trailed off awkwardly.
Steve nodded and handed his phone over to Bucky. Bucky read the text message and smiled warmly, before handing it back to Steve. Nodding to himself, he returned to cleaning his dishes.
“What do you mean hmmm? I mean things aren’t back to what they were, but we need them to get back there and better or at least try. So yeah it’s fine. Nothing’s blown up yet. Why?”
“Oh, yes Tony. You two are still going strong. I am glad to hear of that,” Miriam said delightedly. “Let me tell you Tony has a good one of his hand. I owe my whole life to this man right here. He saved me and my sister. I’m not sure I would have been in this field, if it weren’t for him.”
Steve could view him as a completely different person. But he couldn’t stop himself from wanting to tell someone and here was Steve wanting to listen. Sure, the others had offered but he didn’t want to tell them. So what made Steve different?
Tony had calmed himself down, all to look at Clint sip at his juice box. And that was how the others found them.
Tony figured he would stall for a moment and maybe give a few details of the Accords. Surely, they would listen to him for a little bit if he sounded reasonable. And Tony was always reasonable.
“Oh dear I’m often right about a lot of things more oft than not,” a sultry voice replied. “I must ask you to be more specific.”
Tony laughed inwardly. Miles was nowhere near being five. He had only turned four three months ago, but ever since Sally started saying she was seven and two quarters, Miles began telling people he was almost five.
“See, what you have failed to come to the understanding is that I may be Captain America, but I did fight in the war. This mantle was not just for show, so don’t delude yourself to thinking that I was ever going to let you leave with the thought that you would win.”
Steve had hoped he wouldn’t run into Tony on his way out. He had hoped that Tony would be arriving later, but as things would have it Steve just could not catch a break. His chest clenched and he felt sparks of pain settle there. He didn’t want to physically have this conversation and he couldn’t lie about the real reason those bags were there.
By the time the two had made it to the Tower, Pepper was already situated in the board room. Immediately, without any thought she went over to Tony and wrapped him in a hug. Tony had his suspicions that Happy might have passed on what had happened, but now they were confirmed.
Steve’s teeth nipped teasingly at Tony’s lip and Tony breathed out a laugh. Steve responded in the same way their laughter mingling with one another. They laughed as hands landed on chins or kisses were misplaced on each other’s eyelids. A short giggle reverberated in Tony’s chest and came out softly as Steve found a ticklish spot just at the curve of his hip. Steve trailed his fingers over the spot, teasingly leaving a hot trail on the little bit of exposed skin. Tony shifted lightly so that the ticklish touch would become firmer.
Or maybe he did and he just chose not to focus on how he allowed himself to be put in this situation.
They followed her into the candy store, but Tony was not in there. Steve looked toward Wanda and addressed her, “Is there any way you can reach him?”
“If you came from this conversation thinking otherwise, perhaps I need to go over this again,” Steve teased. “Yes, I’m going to do it all Tony. Staring with dinner.”
“Speaking of how are things with Laura?” Steve asked looking down at the menu. “Were you able to get in touch with her and the kids?”
Despite spring making its early arrival in the city, this cemetery saw no inklings of new life. Every single thing reflected in this space was dismal.
Before Bucky had the chance to respond, Clint darted out in front of them. “Okay, I am ready to go!”
It wasn’t until later that night with Ryder buried so deep inside of him and hands tight around his throat where Tony could hardly breathe, that Tony agreed to stop seeing Dr. Sana for a little trial run. Ryder had then lifted himself off of Tony so satisfied and pressed a lingering kiss to his cheek.
“And you want to say you don’t need the Accords? The Accords are for those bad judgment calls. The Accords are a time to reflect on your actions and how it affects others. The Accords are implemented to make sure average day civilians are not freaking terrified of going outside their homes without Avengers going headfirst into some crisis and not looking back behind to see the damage.”
He had sent a text to Steve a little while ago making sure everyone had made it back safely and that the kids were all picked up. Steve had sent back his own text with a picture of everyone in the main room smiling.
Once they arrived back at the tower, they immediately went to grab something to eat. While they were cautious that they needed to clean up, their stomachs were so hungry that they quickly washed their hands and grabbed whatever was available on the counter.
“He was right about one thing,” Fury said stiffly as though he hadn’t wanted to even say it. “If we bring Tony in-”
Tony stood in the center of the room not fully sure what to do with himself. He didn’t know if he had passed the point where he could smooth talk himself out of this. He had enjoyed his time away from Ryder and had hoped he would have had a few more days without him. But Ryder coming back unannounced messed everything up.
“Didn’t sign up for aiding in kidnap either, but look what we’re doing. It’s part of the job,” Miriam told her. “Look I love you because you’re my sister. But if you’re going to whine about this all day and night I can do this on my own.”
Tony let the bowl be lifted from his hands. He didn’t register Steve placing it on the table. His mind was on other things now.
Everyone had been vetted, references checked, poked and prodded. Those that could withstand the heat and realize it was only for the safety of victims and their families, that they were doing this, made it past the first few rounds of interviews.
Tony shrugged his shoulder. “I don’t know. This is just all of a sudden, but is it bad I feel…” Tony trailed off, his cheeks rising in color.
Jaime gave Tony three rings and leaned back against the wall. “Alright Mr. Stark you know the rules. Ready?”
Tony tried talking around the bottle and some of the drink dribbled outside of his mouth. Miriam grew delighted and began to force the bottle down his throat. Her eyes grew dark and she grew fascinated with how his throat spasmed and how drops of alcohol traveled down his jaw.
“Yeah that’s why we planned on after eight and until two in the morning the park is open for all of the high schoolers to enjoy their time, while we take the kids back,” Tony said. “We’ll have the normal workers step back in to do their jobs, while giving them a nice Christmas bonus, since they’ll be working later hours.”
Steve’s cheeks grew even warmer. “I don’t love him. And besides I bring him food because if I didn’t, we’d just have a starving genius on our hand.”
“Bekah,” Steve said knowing full well he would revert back to calling her Mrs. Keener, even unconsciously. “How are you doing?”
This time it was Winston. By then Tony had lost all feeling in his body. He was completely paralyzed, he couldn’t even move his mouth. Winston knelt between his legs and rested his head on Tony’s thigh.
“Well what other kind are there? To the dinosaur nuggets we go!” Tony shouted and skipped to the kitchen, enjoying how the child’s laughter followed him.
“May we’ve already discussed this. Peter and you are an extension of my family. I take care of family, yeah? So we’re good.”
“Seems like it amplified the bad in me much more than the good,” Steve softy uttered to himself. “And I felt like I had to disprove that. Out of all the bad things that the serum had caused, the person who had the serum running in their blood had the ability to make it good. And it did for a while. But it caused this snowball effect.”
His feet carried him so fast into the main floor and into the living area, that he didn’t even register the weight of a body bumping into his. Tony looked up into the eyes of Steve and let out a relieved breath.
Steve left Bucky and Natasha back at the tower, so that they could help in locating Isak and bringing him back here. Energy thrummed beneath his veins at just the mere hope that Isak was Ryder. Within him he had no ounce of a doubt that Ryder had managed to do this unthinkable offense, but it was just all too convenient for Steve to let fly over his head. He had dealt with too many ghosts that had turned out to be alive. Death to him didn’t quite mean anything more, until he actually saw a body and some provable information.
Ryder only dug harder until he pulled his hands away to push his boxers down. His cock sprang up and Tony’s eyes rolled back in hopes that for once Ryder would be gentle this time.
“Ryder! Look at the fucking road. Are you trying to kill us,” he screamed loudly. “I will roll out of this care I swear to…”
He winked at the older woman, who blushed. Her husband playfully waved his fist in the air toward Tony. Tony smiled brilliantly at the crowd once again.
Steve took the time to notice there were more faces in the room. Nick Fury was in there as was Maria Hill. However, the two faces that surprised him the most were the appearances of Vision and Pepper.
He looked at the bodies lying down on the ground. His breathing came out in harsh rasps and he felt his heart nearly ache to be out of his chest.
“Miles came to us crying saying you were scared,” Steve told him. “Wanted to make sure you were alright.”
But Ryder wouldn’t go that far. Sure, his time with Winston, Cali, and Miriam was awful and he definitely didn’t need an encore of that night’s performance. Ryder wouldn’t do anything to him like that again. Tony always believed that people could change. So who was he to pass judgment on Ryder and think that he couldn’t?
Ryder’s eyes brightened. “Yeah! Tony cooked last night and we have like some crazy mad leftovers. Come on sit down I’ll warm things up.”
“Oh,” Steve simply said. Inside he was screaming and doing the most intricate happy dance his serum-enhanced body could do. “Well, that’s fortunate for us. That means that we can enjoy our spaghetti as was intended.”
Of course Tony left out the part where he cried with relief at knowing he wasn’t tainted and the realization that this could still be enjoyable for him. And sure at times Tony was insatiable with his need for this closeness for Steve, but it was also the moments, where they didn’t need any of this physical intimacy but instead just had this desire of lying beside one another content with each other’s presence, that made him trust and fall deeper into love with Steve.
He didn’t exactly have to imagine, though, with the way Tony was making his way through the Avengers.
wait here for my signal.” And with that she snatched the car keys from Clint and drove off towards the front gate of the estate. Tony and Clint watched from the distance through their binoculars, confirming that Natasha made it past the valet and inside.
When Tony made his way to the shared kitchen the next morning, a warm mug was pressed into his hands before he made it two steps.
Tony had been swallowed by the parasite and soaked in its green acidic stomach juices just to be thrown back up when Steve or Thor landed a hard punch to its stomach.
“Hey!” Peter whined, “What’s wrong with spiders?” He glanced over at Natasha for back up, but only received a shrug before she returned to securing her Widow’s Bites to her wrists.
since he and Steve had talked for more than a few seconds, and Tony was just realizing how much he desperately missed him.
“You’re a good dancer.” Bucky said, eyes sweeping across the room. Tony leaned against the wall and shrugged.
That made Steve look up from his book. He stared at him with a furrowed brow for a long moment before he ventured, “Do I even want to know?”
“Alright, alright. I’ll…I’ll figure something out.” Tony ran over to a work table in the corner of the room, shuffling around papers in search of a key. He threw open the drawers, quickly sorting through the various bits and bobs, but still no key.
“Behold your king, spider men! Claim and conquer this land!” The large alien spider bellowed out. The alien spiders began slashing and spitting webs with a renewed fervor, pushing them from their weak offense to pure defense. Steve blocked a thick black web with his shield, ducking his head from the electric sparks flying off the web.
Tony arched an eyebrow at him. “You might want to book an appointment with your eye doctor, Sniper Eyes. I haven’t seen Steve dance once since I’ve known him.”
He had a funny look on his face, like he wasn’t quite comfortable with his plan, like maybe he wanted to say something but because he was a nice guy he wouldn’t.
Across the room sat the circuit breakers behind a metal gate. Tony deflated when he realized that it was lock and key, nothing he could hack his way into.
“The guy who almost died is fine too, Cap. Thanks for asking.” Clint said dryly. He shivered and broke out in another coughing fit, struggling to pull in another breath between coughing up mouthfuls of water.
But he did agree with Bucky and Steve—he hadn’t left Peter’s room in the past two days, accepting food from whoever brought it—usually Steve—and only left Peter’s side to use the bathroom. His skin felt clogged and his undersuit was starting to get itchy. He didn’t even want to imagine what he smelled like to the super-soldiers.
Bucky shook his head and waved him off. Tony let out a relieved sigh. “I’m just glad you’re feeling better.”
“I’m sorry if I’ve been making you uncomfortable the past few weeks,” Tony started. There was no reason to drag this out any longer than it had to be. “I mean, even without Barnes’ death glares, it’s pretty obvious I’ve been doing something to make you avoid me.”
“Maybe try not to leave a trail of bodies in your wake.” He teased. She finished smoothing the uniform down and dragged the unconscious woman towards the bathrooms.
“And they’re not about to turn a new leaf and pull a Stark Industries.” Clint chirped from where he was changing out of his stealth suit and into a black Giorgio Armani two-piece suit, courtesy of Tony Stark.
Steve managed to prop himself up on his elbows as Tony hastily landed next to him flipping his faceplate up, a mixture of worry and annoyance on his face.
Tony chuckled and led Peter out of the training facility and back towards the living quarters. “You did good today, kid. Wash up, eat, take a nap. You can meet me in my workshop when you’re rested up.”
“Tony,” Steve’s voice came through their private channel, “I have an idea, but you’re not going to like it.”
“Same time tonight?” Rogers asked as he handed off the coffee. Tony blinked up at him. Rogers only smiled back, a small dusting of powdered sugar stuck to the corner of his mouth.
“He does like supporting a cause he believes in,” the corner of Bucky’s mouth twitched upward in a half smile, “but what he really comes for is the dancing.”
Steve retreated to his own room, deliberately not looking at the elevator as he passed, and methodically started getting ready for bed, focusing his restless mind on unbuttoning every button of his shirt, and brushing each individual tooth. He slid under his covers and turned over a few times until he ended up flat on his back, staring up at the ceiling.
Tony’s stomach somersaulted at that. A feeling started to curl in his stomach, something close to jealousy. But that made no sense at all. What did he have to be jealous over?
To Tony’s surprised, Steve scooted over without any more goading. A second later and he was laying with his face on a super-soldier chest and had a strong arm curled around him. Tony blinked, and after Steve had stopped moving he situated himself into a more comfortable position. He squirmed, and finally settled as Steve’s thumb landed over his hip with a
“There’s a lot to think about.” He sighed. Steve continued to work his hand over a knot, the tightness in his shoulders starting to give. He blinked slowly, his eyelids growing heavier.
He figured that would take a day or two, and after that he could introduce him to a few of his own projects that he thought Peter might be interested in. They could start the base code for a new AI. Tony could walk him through building a miniaturized arc reactor. Hell, if the kid wanted to spend the week creating a new element, Tony would hand over a pair of safety goggles and get to work.
“And the nurse there…or at least the semblance of a nurse will give you a pill every day. It is your option to take this pill. But know the pill can have two separate effects. One can cure you completely of everything that I inflicted on you. The other could automatically kill you on the spot. Either way, you won’t know because they look identical,” Tony smirked.
Helen shifted on her feet uncomfortably. “I am sorry, but there are some things that I cannot address to all of you. Also even then that is up to the discretion of my patient. We will only perform an examination, upon Tony’s permission as such rules dictate.”
Immediately, her words cut off as a ball of yarn filled glue was thrown to the back of her shirt. She shrieked and jumped.
Steve’s note of surprise on his face did not go unnoticed. However, it eased into something softer when his eyes rested on Tony. He went into the room, hands holding a bowl of soup and a cup of water.
“Foolish me, thinking that everyone eventually hurts me. But see with you I tried seeing if as long as I accept the hurt, you’d stay. Unfortunately, you did and you almost killed me.”
“I swear to my mother’s grave I am not lying. I have never met Tony Stark. I have never laid eyes on the man. Please, just let me go. I can’t breathe.”
Tony turned watery eyes toward Rhodey. Rhodey’s heart clenched and he was trying his hardest not to end this phone call and schedule a flight back to see Tony. But Tony was right in saying he couldn’t miss his physical therapy appointment. So he checked in his disappointment and hoped his words would tide him over until he could make a personal visit.
“No, no, no. Don’t pay until you see the item and make sure it’s perfect for you. Then you can pay,” Mr. Moore told him.
“What? You can’t tell me how to feel Rogers. I am not something that you can control!” Tony hissed. “I am not a soldier that you command.”
Tony breathed out shakily, watery eyes meeting Ryder’s. Ryder’s fingers moved inside of him again and he titled his head at Tony.
“You decided to sleep in your room today, bambino,” Tony affectionately said into Miles’ curls. Miles nodded his head and had decided there on Tony’s lap was just as well another comfortable position to fall asleep, because he had fallen asleep mere seconds later.
Natasha helped bring Tony to his feet, smirking brightly. She led Tony out of the room. Clint turned to look at him.
He parked his car in the back of the school, something that Tony had made sure to impart some wisdom on him. During heavy pick-up traffic it was best to park in the back, since they were such high profile figures and thankfully they had clearance from admin to do it.
“Finally. You two took forever to get ready. Remember I need to get to school early so I can set up my project presentation with my group. We need to leave in like eight minutes at the latest,” Harley rushed out, mouth full with food.
“Well, that was unexpected. But admittedly hot,” Tony said after a beat, straightening his tie back into place while scanning the room for any lingering eyes. Luckily, no one had seemed to clock their brief heated moment, all eyes turned in different directions.
“You could’ve just said that, you big lug.” Tony gently shouldered Steve. “I missed you, too.” He cleared his throat, “Good news is that me and Thor are ending things in a few days, so you can have me all to yourself.”
Tony ran a hand over his tired face. He called May the morning after Peter came down with his mysterious illness, apologizing and offering to send a plane to pick her up from her Girl’s Vacation in Rome, free of charge of course. After May had declined—she had been properly worried but expressed her trust in Tony to take care for her nephew—and Bruce had confirmed that it was just a nasty virus, Tony decided the least he could do was make himself available to Peter’s every beck and call.
He passed by Steve who was already dressed and showered for the day and Sam who was still in his running clothes, the smell of dried sweat lingering around him. Tony wrinkled his nose at him, and only got away with it because Sam is always immobile for at least a half hour after his runs with Steve.
Tony managed to nod his head. A hand cupped the back of his neck, a comforting weight acting like a barrier to the spreading panic, stopping it from fully consuming his mind.
Steve watched as Iron Man dashed through the air, avoiding Rorgg’s flailing limbs as he tried to grab Bucky’s outstretched arm.
“Seems we’ve gathered a crowd.” Thor said, an eyebrow raised in a silent question. Tony’s eyes slid back to Thor’s gaze. At this proximity he had to tilt his head up to meet his eyes.
They weaved their way to the kitchens, thanks to a key card Natasha swiped from an unsuspecting server. Tony tried to angle himself away from any wandering eyes, and managed not to catch any lingering looks.
Caught in a moment of distraction, Steve somehow managed to forget the giant spider falling through the air, and as Rorgg hit the ground, one of his legs kicked out and sent Steve skidding across the pavement and into the side of a brick building.
“There,” Clint said after a few minutes, pointing to an upper floor window. A light flashed three times before the room went dark again. Tony nodded and followed where Clint had already started down the hillside towards the estate.
When Tony showed up to the next movie night, Steve apparently another no-show, he bypassed the common area and instead headed toward the gym.
“Ah, Anthony,” Thor turned towards him with a pleased look on his face. “How have you been since we last met?”
Maybe Steve hadn’t noticed. He probably had better things to do than hang out with Tony on his ratty couch.
He’d seen Steve turn down and refuse plenty of dances before, albeit with genuine regret. He didn’t even know if Steve could dance—the super soldier serum helped his reflexes and Steve was a fast learner; certainly if he wanted to dance, even if he didn’t know how to, he would pick it up fast enough to be flying around the ballroom like a pro.
Tony clucked his tongue. “One night isn’t going to kill me. You didn’t drop an Ambien in here, did you?” He narrowed his eyes suspiciously at the half drunk coffee in his hands.
“Actually, how about one of those training sessions?” That earned him a questioning eyebrow, “You, uh, might be onto something with them.”
“Please. Just, let me say this before I can’t.” It was getting harder for Steve to meet Tony’s eyes, and by the looks of it he seemed just as uncomfortable as he felt. Tony opened his mouth once more looking like he wanted to protest, but eventually slumped back into his seat, giving Steve a patient look. “Okay. Okay.”
“Thanks. It was Cap’s idea.” Tony said as he started removing his helmet. “Hey, help me out of this? I think the acid is starting to eat through my armor I’m only sort of fond of my limbs.”
After a couple of minutes of awkward crawling back and forth, peeking through the vents to check his progress, he made it to the power room. He jumped down from the vent, his knees cracking in protest. He straightened back to his full height, stretching while he looked for the circuit breakers.
Steve sat down next to him and dropped a hand over his shoulder. He started massaging his thumb in circles around the spot where the back of his neck met his shoulder. Tony scrubbed a hand over his face, but slumped into the couch cushions a little more.
“Shower, food, then bed.” Steve ordered. Tony nodded, and starting going through the motions of undressing and showering. The door clicked shut behind him as he stepped into the hot stream of water. He stood there, leaning against the cool tiles as the hot water pelted into his back.
Steve’s arm remained wrapped around him throughout the movie. Tony’s own melancholy mood was forgotten as he provided his own social commentary about dating, and Steve theorized that the blonde woman in the movie was played by Natasha while undercover.
Even though paparazzi never came near the compound, he avoided Thor for three days straight. When he did leave the compound he dragged a reluctant Carol and Rhodey with him to grab dinner, mostly because he knew no one was crazy enough to shove a camera in their faces with Carol at their side, but also half hoping that if they did get pictures then the dating rumors would be squelched.
“Are you—did I upset you?” Tony asked. Steve finally met his eyes, obviously holding something back.
“Fever broke an hour ago,” Bucky voiced over Peter’s head, and then added, “I already called May and let her know.”
Steve’s morning resumed the same as always. He woke up at 5am, asked Friday if Tony had made it to bed last night (
“You’re a strategist, Cap. Sometimes you gotta fight fire with fire.” He plopped down on the opposite end of the couch and swung his feet onto Steve’s legs. “I just need a willing boyfriend. Or girlfriend. A date mate. I’m not picky.”
“Steve, get Bruce.” Tony barked. Peter winced at the noise and Tony lowered his voice to just above a whisper, “Fri, lights down to ten percent.”
sexy, and more painful than he imagined, though had a hunch that was due to his earlier threat— he barely had enough energy to shed his clothes and cross his bedroom. Despite the soreness already radiating through his body, it felt good to be back. Even Rogers’ nagging felt less annoying than usual. Tony might have even appreciated his concern.
“Three blocks north, Cap.” Sam called as Steve watched his flying form dive into the cloud of smoke to where the fight was at.
The discomfort stayed with him well after they ditched the car and boarded the Quinjet. He pointedly ignored it the rest of the flight home.
where it is?” Natasha’s eyes narrowed at him and he raised his arms in surrender. “Fine, I know where it is. But I can’t just walk in there. I won’t make it five feet before someone recognizes me.”
Steve ducked his head and rubbed the back of his neck, “And I guess I was a little jealous. I’ve missed you.”
Rogers nodded, his mother-henning instinct supposedly soothed for the moment. “Think I could hitch a ride with you back into the city?”
Out of the corner of his eye he could see a poorly hidden paparazzi in the bushes, hiding like the animal they were. Tony had workshopped countless ideas for this moment; they could have a physical brawl in Times Square, a messy break at the top of the Eiffel Tower, a press conference turned screaming match in front of all the press.
He wasn’t exactly thrilled to be called on a super-secret spy mission with the wonder twins, and even less thrilled when he was told to forego the Iron Man suit and sneak into an Italian estate on the southern coast like some James Bond character.
Bucky and Nat peeled off towards a few storefronts in search of civilians as Steve ran forward to join Sam. True to Clint’s word, he came face to face with what could only be described as a giant space spider. Thick red hide covered its arachnid body, it’s eight legs as tall as telephone poles. Sam darted between three of the spiders, laying gunfire as he dodged their swiping appendages.
“I think I have an idea.” Peter chirped, sounding as bright as ever. “Mr. Stark, have you ever heard of that old game,
“Remember we have team training this afternoon,” Steve said. He turned towards Tony, “I understand if you won’t be making it.”
Steve remained in the doorway as Tony rearranged the room, pulling the chair from the desk in the corner of the room to the side of Peter’s bed.
Bucky gladly accepted his bowl of soup and they ate in silence. Steve left the fourth bowl, a couple of bananas, and a bottle of water on Peter’s night stand, and ushered Tony out of the room and towards the communal living room.
Tony clapped his hands around Peter’s ears, stretching his face into faux-scandalized look, “Mind the young, impressionable minds in the vicinity!”
Tony nearly choked on his coffee as Pepper slapped down a newspaper in front of him. It took him a few seconds to process the unimpressed look across her face, her arms crossed against her chest. Why was Pepper at the compound? Why did she have a physical copy of the paper? Most importantly, why was she glaring at him with the intensity of the sun?
They traded blows. Peter dodged. Steve threw a punch with considerably less force behind it than usual. They danced around the gym in an evenly matched fight, the minutes passing in a tense silence only with the occasional grunt from the two men.
A knock at the door made his eyes fly open. He hadn’t even remembered closing them. He haphazardly finished cleaning himself and got dressed.
Bucky narrowed his eyes. “What’s the catch?” When Sam only shrugged, Bucky pressed on, “What thing of mine did you steal, break, or lose?”
But Thor only wrapped an arm around Tony without sparing him a glance, eyes remained glued to the movie in front of them.
As they got closer to the city they slowed their speed to double digits, almost feeling like crawling after spending the better half of an hour at supersonic speeds. They waved at gawking tourists and did loop-de-loops as they passed a school playground.
“We can work with this,” Tony started, “We know exactly where the hard drive is, and we don’t have to break into anymore buildings or disable anymore security systems. The hard part is out of the way, we just have to grab it.”
Steve managed to refrain from rolling his eyes at him. Tony ducked his head, wild curls blocking his face from view, and took a long sip from his mug, barely managing to smother the amused smile on his face. Steve had to slip his hand into his pocket to keep from running his hands through Tony’s hair.
“If anything I’m doing them a favor. Half the tabloids in New York would tank without me. Think of all the jobs I’m creating.”
And finally, thank you for the love on the first chapter! This is my first Stony fic, so I appreciate the kind words :)
It had been three weeks of intense dating. Three weeks of public outings. Three weeks for Tony to grow attached. Not necessarily to Thor, not that he wasn’t a catch, but to the feelings of being wanted by someone, being important to someone. It wasn’t rocket science—he didn’t need a psychologist to tell him about his crippling daddy issues and how that effected his interpersonal relationships. Even if it was fake, his brain couldn’t exactly differentiate the feelings inside his head.
Bucky shook his head, but narrowed his eyes. All of the others stood up from their seat. Everyone in the room noticed the movement and watched as the Avengers got up. They distinctly wondered if they should care. However, Rhodey called them down by simply explaining they were looking for something. He told them that a few should stay at the table so as to not cause any panic.
Fingers dug into the sand and rested in there. She smoothed her fingers out and watched as the sand grains traveled through her fingers.
Steve seemed to be suffering the same, not willing to let go of Tony. Instead he kept holding him against his chest, breaths soon teetering off into soft puffs of air. Steve shakily sighed and pulled back a little, well only as far as Tony would let him.
“Go,” Cali explained once she had got done resetting Tony’s arm. “My sister won’t be asleep for long and Ryder will come back in a day. Take this hoodie cover your face. There will be a driver downstairs who will not ask questions. He will drive you to a plane. Get on the plane and he will take you home.”
Steve smiled feeling hope grow warm in his chest. He was already mentally going through a plan. Natasha leaned closer to Steve.
“I’m not suggesting anything. I am simply stating what is on the paper. I make no assumption, but only say what is on the paper.”
“Cut the bull shit Steve. For once stop lying to yourself and to those around you. The Accords are not what you have a problem with. If you seriously have a problem with the Accords, I would be doubting your efficiency as our team leader.”
“FRIDAY go three images back and pause,” Steve told FRIDAY moving closer to the screen. FRIDAY did as suggested and Steve felt a frown overtake his face at the image.
Only Steve was left in the living area. His mind immediately went back to a month ago and he realized all that he lost in that timespan and everything that he was willing to do to gain it back. He looked at the counter and saw the bracelet gone. He hoped Tony had taken it back. After all, it still meant something to him.
Tony sat back looking around himself and smiling softly at just the pure happiness that was encompassing the room. Harley by then had taken to playing with Julie and Miles. Miles meanwhile kept “discreetly” making kissing faces at the two.
“Okay, can you be quiet,” Steve hissed looking around to see if anyone heard him. “Seriously, look I may have a crush on him a while ago. But it’s all over now. He has a boyfriend that he seems to really like.”
“We’re going to stay here, for a bit longer. Come here, when he’s put to bed,” Natasha whispered the final part just for Steve’s super soldier hearing. “We have some things we need to finish.”
As they laid there together, Steve ran his hands through Tony’s damp curls that clung to the nape of his neck. Pressing a small kiss at the top of his head, Steve shifted his body as if wanting to bring himself closer, even though there was no way that could be possibly achieved.
“Thanks for that by the way. I know keeping things a secret had to have been a little difficult,” Steve said as they finally made it to the car. He threw in Peter’s bag in the truck, after realizing that he couldn’t put his things in the backseat since they’d be picking up Harley and Miles shortly after leaving the airport.
“I don’t know why I keep coming here,” Tony confessed. “It certainly hasn’t really helped besides constantly letting me know you’re gone. You’re dead and there’s no way you can hurt me here anymore. You know it’s funny even after death, you had some strange hold on me. It’s like I was in this state of limbo, while you had already passed on.”
“Good,” Miles said hiding his face in Peter’s shirt, once he saw there was more company around. Miles looked over his shoulder nervously.
Tony probably would…no he knew he was definitely going to be putting his son’s stickers on the suit.
“And after everything with Ultron, I tried getting in touch with families and friends of everyone who was affected. I was trying to get in touch with them because I wanted their forgiveness. I wanted to know I hadn’t just written Merchant of Death onto my tombstone,” he chuckled.
Apologies for no chapter last week life happens, you know? Also there will probably not be a chapter update next week because I'm trying to study for finals *sobs*
Ryder waved his concern off. “Yeah, no you go. I’ll have this all packed and ready to go. I’ll follow you back shortly.”
Tony stopped short, eyes welling up. He felt his breath catch in his throat, remembering the exact moment all of his strength had left him.
“DUM-E that wasn’t nice,” Tony reprimanded as DUM-E grew closer. Tony noticed the coffee cup in DUM-E’s hands and took it. “Thanks, DUM-E. Coffee is just what I need.”
“What’s wrong with him?” Tony asked as Miles body rocked with coughs. He pat his back and looked to Karen for an answer. He wasn’t sick last time Tony visited and Tony made sure to visit at least once a week.
Tony looked at him, eyelashes stuck together. Steve kissed the space between his eyebrows and Tony’s eyes fell shut. Steve softly kissed the eyelids of both eyes. Tony breathed softly and opened them once more.
“It doesn’t matter, if it’s a minute into it. You just say the word,” Natasha said, piggybacking off of Steve’s sentiment.
He whispered softly, but his voice was too soft for Rhodey to register that he said something. So Rhodey opened his mouth to say something to break the silence.
Rhodey shook his head, “No, it’s fine. I actually have to head home that nap wasn’t enough for me and I think I’m just about to drop any moment.”
Steve hadn’t even noticed how late it was getting, until he realized that Tony was slowly leaning forward. He had realized that toward the end it was mostly Steve talking about his time with the Howling Commandos and Tony hadn’t inserted his two cents in a while.
Steve didn’t give Ryder a chance to say anything else, before his hand went swinging against Ryder’s cheek.
“That’s different. I haven’t seen Bruce in forever,” Tony tried explaining. “That’s extremely different. Plus that’s just how I always greet him. It’s just how our relationship works.”
“You should put a little quinjet on yours, maybe make a few little black widows, yeah? The girls will love that,” Natasha exclaimed.
“Steve, visiting hours are over,” Helen announced. “You are certainly free to wait in the waiting room with the rest of your team, until visiting hours begin again.”
“Oh, umm sure,” Steve said. He reached out to shake Tony’s leg awake, but was stopped by Peter. Peter shook his head and mouthed to not wake Tony up. Steve frowned at him, but stopped his actions nonetheless.
Tony’s voice was rising and Miles was starting to shrink in on himself. Steve stood off to the side as he watched Tony place Miles on the floor. He noticed that Tony placed down Miles so that he could gather himself. His shoulders were rising as he tried inhaling a ragged breath.
“It’s alright we can eat in here, if you don’t mind. At least until Miles’ grasp lessens,” Steve said.
“Okay, now I am definitely hurt. First you vote for my enemy’s Lego building and now you won’t accept my kisses. Oh no mister this won’t do,” Tony said grabbing ahold of Miles and smothering him with kisses.
“But Tony always had this extra place in his heart for all of you. And I know all it would take is a simple we need you Tony to help us out, and he would smile and forgive and welcome you back with open arms,” Pepper laughed bitterly. “Because that’s Tony for you. And I want to yell at you until I’m blue in the face and you understand just how selfless and caring Tony is, when you all have done nothing to deserve his kindness. But frankly I just don’t have any more anger to yell at you. I just feel disappointed in you all.”
[2] Jeg vet ikke. Jeg skal svare. Var vi ventet noen?  I don't know. I am about to answer. Where we expecting someone?
“Hey, what’s that face?” Rhodey questioned finding a chair and moving it to the other side of Tony’s bed.
“But seriously I love you and I need to make sure you know that. Do I need to like tell you that every day and give you hugs and kisses like I do for the kids,” she said, her laughter calming down.
And he threw up again, the acid scratching against the back of his throat. Clint left for a minute and then came back and placed a wet towel in Steve’s hand. Steve wiped his mouth with it and also took from Clint the piece of gum he was offering.
“Okay, Mr. Steve,” Miles said as he climbed over Steve’s body to grab coloring books and his crayons. “But you have to color in the lines. Baba doesn’t because he says we shouldn’t re…rect…”
“Don’t leave just…stay here for a little bit longer,” Tony said trying to incorporate some strength back into his voice and not heavy begging.
“That’s not true. Plus I wanted to make a home-cooked meal. I need to show him that I’m making all the effort and am serious about this,” Steve admitted.
Tony was looking down at his hands with a frown. He chewed at his lip and Steve watched as it nearly drew blood. Walking toward him, Steve took Tony’s hand in his and brought one to tilt his chin upward to look directly into Steve’s eyes.
“Maybe,” he said instead. “But I figured since his body was forever buried in that ice, in the cold maybe that’s what I deserved. So I didn’t try feeling warm for a while. I believed that it was just something I had to get used to.”
I deeply apologize for updating a whole two weeks too late. My film project kept being pushed back because of actors' schedule problems, so we had to keep re-filming scenes. Anyways I am back and we will stay on the regular schedule of Saturday updates. Thank you guys for your patience and hope you all enjoy :)
“So I thought the Accords were just another thing we would fight about. I thought eventually one of us would concede to defeat and laugh about it. I mean I was half way in about the Accords. I didn’t agree fully with it, but-”
“Would the Accords have saved your parents, if they were to have existed? Would the Accords had saved you from that cave in Afghanistan? Would the Accords have stopped the death of many innocents done by your hand? Can the Accords forgive all the red you have left behind in your wake?”
Emerges from 2 year hiatus. Here are 28 pages full of...well let me not keep you all waiting, you've done that enough. Thanks for being a part of me with this journey and giving me a reason to come back two years later and finish this. :)
“Maybe it’s because you haven’t employed the same courtesy,” Natasha said. “So listen now and read the document. Good night Steve.”
“All this is helping to do is effectively treat your trauma and your responses to it. It is to help mediate the pain you feel and all of the emotions that are brought up in your day to day job. It is to make sure that your thoughts are clear.”
Harley had become silent and whenever he talked his words were laced with anger. It seemed he displaced his anger at Ryder to anyone who dared say something to him. So Steve had taken to training Harley so he could exert some energy. After Harley’s body loosened some of his tension, he would leave to visit his mom. Then he would come back to the tower and sullenly lock himself up in his room.
“Oh, and then when I was fifteen I was taken by some business investors that were upset over a deal my dad had cut them out of. Then a few months later I was taken by this guy who claimed I was actually his son. My dear old dad, Howard, claimed he would have been so lucky for it to have been true. My mom was the only reason that I came back from that one. Sometimes I think my life might have been better staying with that crazy man.”
“But what if they don’t see us,” Tony countered. “Whenever someone tries to get the jump on the Avengers when do they usually do it? When do all the creepy crawly bad guys come out?”
The first photo he wasn’t surprised to see. The two girls from yesterday smiled widely in the foreground, and behind them was Thor and Tony. Thor had Tony’s head cupped in his hand, his thumb over his lips. And, yeah, it didn’t
The pitch black room brightened only slightly as the opaque windows shifted to semitransparent. In the middle of the room sat a four poster bed, the curtains drawn back enough to show a mess of brown curls poking out of the sea of navy blue sheets. Tony sat on the edge of the bed and patted Peter’s ankle.
“Hey, hey, hey. Before you disappear, what do you say you go on a fly with me?” Tony knocked his gauntleted hand twice against his helmet, “Just finished up this one and I need to take it on a test run before it’s officially in commission—I love all my kids equally but this one takes the cake. How does Carol put it? Higher, further, faster, baby.”
Tony flung open the metal lockers, finding nothing more than a dusty hat in the top of one. Tony scanned the room once more. There was nowhere else for a key to be hidden, he wasn’t strong enough to muscle the gate open, and he didn’t have time to find and knock out a security guard in hopes of finding a key on their keyring. He ran a hand through his hair, tugging at the silver strands in frustration. He whirled back around to the gate, eying the metal bars. It would be a tight squeeze, but he could probably make it. He had to try, at least.
“Aye aye, Captain.” Clint saluted. He winced a bit as he waddled over to Sam, and they took of towards medical. Natasha nodded and disappeared back towards where the Hulk’s angry roars echoed.
“Hawkeye, stay on perimeter watch. If you see any civilians let Widow or Falcon know.” Steve ordered, “Iron Man, we need you here. The others don’t have armor or a healing factor to protect from the acid.”
It wasn’t until they were already home and Steve pulled out four bowls for soup that Tony realized he hadn’t been bombarded by anxious thoughts in the past few hours. He took two bowls of soup from Steve and followed him towards Peter’s room. Peter was still asleep, but the room was recently cleaned—Peter was wrapped in fresh sheets, the air smelled slightly of lemon scented cleaner, the garbage emptied and replaced with a new bag.
“What would I do without you?” Tony winked at him and turned back to the camera, giving them a few more photos without his face covered in condiments. The girls thanked them and ran off, talking with their heads bent close together in hushed, excited tones.
wasn’t that bad.” Steve crossed the room and held one of the two spoons out for Tony. “I think I have a few cardboard boxes laying around if you need help packing up Thor’s stuff.” He continued.
“He doesn’t like being paraded around like a monkey in a suit selling war bonds again.” Bucky continued.
“I, um, I talked to Buck last night.” The words stumbled out, considerably less confident than he was moments ago. The light, teasing atmosphere was suddenly gone as Tony’s expression shifted marginally, brows slightly drawn. He was rapidly becoming hyperaware of their proximity, the point where Tony’s knee was still pressed against his leg abruptly felt all too much.
Natasha clawed at Bucky’s face. He shoved her away, not wanting to lose an eye, and Natasha skidded to a stop at their feet, gasping for air. Bucky charged her once again, ready to claim victory, but her hand shot out and grabbed Cap’s shield. She jammed it in his kneecap, forcing the super-soldier down onto his other, and smashed the shield upwards in an uppercut to his chin. Bucky fell over, a dazed look in his eye, and Natasha dragged herself back to her feet, shield in hand.
At movie night, Steve came to a halt as he walked into common area, eyes glued on Thor’s arm wrapped around Tony’s shoulders. Tony patted the seat next to him where Steve sat every movie night. Steve eventually unfroze and hesitantly joined them on the sofa. Tony was hyperaware of Steve’s presence next to him, only because he sat rigidly for the entire three hours, barely shifting position. The rest of the team slowly trickled out, back to their rooms during the second movie, until it was just the two of them left.
“Boys, play nice.” She chastised, a grunt, and then added, “My bites are useless against these things.”
happy for you and I respect your relationship with Bucky—I would never try to undermine it— but I can’t keep living with this secret inside me. I don’t want to lie to you anymore.”
“Five more minutes.” Peter turned, wrapping himself tightly in the blanket. Tony sighed but started out the door.
Thor chased him through the air and Tony weaved and spun, dodging the god’s grasp. He slowly started getting the hang of piloting the new armor—he kept his arms closer to his sides as he flew linear paths, and after nearly breaking his neck in the whiplash of a too sharp turn, dialed down his movements until they were delicate twitches.
Tony twisted enough to glance over his shoulder, greeted by the view of Steve leaning against his doorframe.
. But he deserved to know, he deserved an explanation. Bucky didn’t seem to mind or find his attraction a threat, which he shouldn’t, because he would never try to undermine their relationship despite his own feelings, so maybe Tony wouldn’t either. Or at least, Bucky would help smooth things over, with Tony being more inclined to listen to him.
. His body finally caught up to his mind, and his heart nearly jumped out of his chest. He was caught flatfooted, his mind reeling over the past two weeks for anything that would have landed him in trouble.
Between them a holographic map of Maine appeared alongside shaky video footage of the scene. Steve stared blankly at the images before him, trying to follow along but not quite able to snap into a battle ready mindset.  Tony, despite any internal conflict he might’ve had and lack of sleep, sprang into action, covering for Steve.
. The next seven days were going to be a science extravaganza, something close to what he did during his spring breaks before he started joining other college students in Cancun, getting drunk off raspberry flavored Smirnoff Ice and dancing with strangers in a packed club to some top 40’s song.
Tony flinched back on reflex, not wanting to be in range of Natasha’s arm as it smacked Clint upside the head.
Natasha continued to scan the room before turning towards Tony. “You’re going to have to create a diversion.”
The next movie night Steve skipped completely. Tony tried to ignore Bucky glaring daggers into the side of his head.
alien invasion, and although it wasn’t a New York level threat they weren’t about to take any chances.
The sharp pain of the brick cracking behind him only lasted a second as he limply fell over on the ground, his vision going black almost immediately after. When he opened his eyes again, he saw Iron Man quickly approaching him. He took a shuddering breath, but his ribs twinged as they expanded, knocking the breath right out of him again.
Steve took the box and slowly pulled apart the silk ribbon and opened the box. Once opened, the box had a soft melodic tune and inside the box was lit up with a light blue setting nicely on the pair of jewelry inside.
And by everything Steve was so thankful to finally experience this. He had to make sure to send Shuri his most humble of thanks.
“Come on Tony. You’re a smart man. Surely you know what you did wrong,” she questioned. “Again nothing?”
Tony’s lip trembled and Steve immediately pressed forward wiping at the tears that were now falling from his eyes. Tony shook his head, wanting Steve to leave him alone. It was too much. Yet Tony didn’t want him to leave. The little bit of warmth he had left would leave him completely if Steve got up and walked away.
Tony hummed as Ryder leaned down to angle his face toward Tony’s and place a warm kiss on his cheek. Tony almost felt a sob threaten to break out with how light everything was. With everything that has been going on in the past year…this is what he wanted. He wanted someone to care for him.
“You mentioned therapy?” Clint questioned, now seeming interested in knowing what all was happening. He’d be foolish if he let himself go into anything without knowing the whole story behind it…which was exactly how he got himself into all of this.
Tony turned gob smacked to Clint in complete and utter disbelief.  Clint averted his eye gaze and his lips turned downward.
Tony turned toward Peter shocked by the sharp demand. Looking at Peter, he watched as a solemn darkness passed over Peter’s features. Peter stared back at him.
The two then continued talking about finding ways to prove that Tony was one of the greatest humans that ever existed. They were going to do their own little outside work. The two were so involved in discussing their plans that they hadn’t realized the time passing. Harley went to go use the restroom and Peter placed his earbuds back in his ear.
“I said were which implies past tense. Then I got to know you and you became that annoying big brother that refused to let me go on a date with that fine sexy firefighter. Like do you know how much I have fantasized about that firefighter using his dick like a water hose and-”
Steve pulled him closer. Tony ignored the burning in his throat. He wished he could go back and tell himself not to fall in love with Ryder. He wanted to save himself from the heartbreak and maybe knock some sense into his naïve brain for falling for anything that Ryder said…much like he had done even when he got older.
Thanks again for all the support y'all. Appreciate the comments, kudos, and bookmarks. Have a wonderful Saturday :)
“Then the chill will set in, you may get hypothermia. May lose a few fingers to a limb or two. Your vision will deteriorate to the point where you won’t even be able to recognize the physical changes to your body.”
“Yes, I do. Look is it something I did. I’ll change. I can’t change something, if I don’t know. So what do I have to do to get you to stay, huh?” Tony questioned still walking back and forth. “Do I need to change my attitude, my work hours? What needs to happen?”
Between his legs was someone different. Tony looked through half-lid eyes how the person licked his lips hungrily and unbuckled their belt. Tony thrashed, but was held down by several hands. He tried kicking the hands off of him, but couldn’t. He looked down and this time saw a light purple patch on the inside of his thigh.
“I thought you were joking,” Tony said as he took in everything on the table. “You made all of this?”
“Come on Tones get up baby,” Ryder quickly added on the endearment to make his words seem softer. “You’re going to get a crick in your neck with it hanging off of the couch like that.”
He then used his free hand to play with the fraying end of Steve’s jacket. Steve tracked the movement and noticed sadly how Tony’s finger seemed to be shaking.
Bucky cleared his throat so that Steve would know he was there. Turning around quickly, Steve’s cheeks flushed a bright red.
Bucky sighed. “Look Steve I’m gonna be frank with you. These past few days it seems like I’m encouraging you to go after Tony more than you’re encouraging yourself.  I’ll always be your encourager, you know that. But either you are in this or you are not. I can only steer you right for so long.”
All three of them nodded, a grim determination taking all of their features. They began walking outside to get in the quinjet and head toward the hospital. Each were undergoing a greater inner turmoil that they couldn’t voice…not yet.
Steve carried Tony outside of his hospital room. A nurse was immediately at his shoulder. “Ah, Mr. Rogers you’re not allowed to take patients outside of their rooms, especially nearing night time. Our policy doesn’t allow it.”
Steve went back to the kitchen, after Tony and Ryder had left. Sure, he was disappointed that the evening’s plans had turned out differently than expected. However, he had nothing but confidence that at the end of the day Tony would much rather be eating spaghetti with him than at some restaurant with Ryder. He had a text to prove it. Smiling at the thought, he grabbed his phone and looked at the message he received a few minutes ago.
Currently, all three had decided that Harley’s bedroom would be on the rotation for fort night. They had taken to sleeping in each other’s room. At first Tony had been concerned that they had grown an unhealthy coping mechanism and this would lead to separation anxiety.
Steve ran his tongue along Tony’s lower lip and caught it between his teeth. Tony did this little whine that had Steve thinking he either speed things along or Tony might be proven correct on his time estimate. And Steve already had to live up to his promises of breaking records tonight.
A few minutes passed with neither of them saying anything, before Tony took this as a sign to continue leaving. “Okay, well this was nice. See you later.”
Tony swallowed a lump in his throat. Miles still looked sad and Tony never wanted to fix anything as much as he wanted to fix the expression on Miles’ face.
And how many times had Tony told him how wonderful his art was or how nice of a person he actually was aside from his title.
“But it didn’t last very long. It almost seemed to change without me nothing it for the longest. I don’t know if that’s because he was so good at hiding things or just because I wasn’t looking.”
straight I definitely would have tried pursuing him. However, that it may be I am not attracted to men in any type of manner and I am married to an amazing woman, with whom I have children.”
Tony shifted on his leg. “Oh, then what mission are you going on? Is it like some super-secret thing?”
It's that time again! Hope you enjoy this chapter. Also I am including Miles Morales in this story. However, his background story will be altered to fit this story.
There was some rustling going on the other side of the phone. Tony waited with bated breath before a bright voice came through the phone.
“This does seem to be a simple disagreement and no one was seriously harmed. However, you do understand that I have to hold these meetings. Now we will be having some issues resolve meeting to work through this problem between the boys. During the study hall period all three of you will go to the school counselor to talk and she will give me progress. Once you have satisfied those requirements, you will be free.”
Today has been the greatest 'cause like I almost ran over a squirrel, I became a victim of identity fraud, and I learned shopping on Christmas Eve Eve is terrible.
Steve decided that for all he thought about Tony sharing himself, maybe it was time to do the same. His fingers went back to Tony’s hair, the repetitive movement helping his own fingers to not shake.
Steve circled around the spider, careful to keep out of reach of the giant legs, and looked for any discernible weakness, but if there was any weaker part of the outer hide, it wasn’t apparent. He sent his shield flying towards it’s stomach and neck, but just like before his shield bounced off of it without a scratch in sight. He charged forward, this time using the blunt edge of his shield and aiming for its leg. He gathered all his strength and slammed down, hoping that the leg would collapse under his blow, but it scraped off its armored skin like a spoon to cement.
“I’ve got my sources.” Tony shot him a sly, conspiratorial wink. He jumped up from his workbench and started towards the elevator, “C’mon, Cap. Let’s see if you can teach an old dog new tricks.”
He couldn’t look away. Steve’s eyebrows remained raised in shock, his mouth hanging open slightly. Even from a distance Tony could see a pink blush spreading across his cheeks. As his eyes moved from Tony to Bucky, the look of shock was replaced by a series of rapid emotions—confusion, betrayal, disbelief, before settling on something adjacent to anger. Steve’s mouth snapped shut, eyes hardened, his hands clenching and unclenching at his side.
Bucky rolled and clamped his arm around Natasha’s neck in a chokehold. The metal plates of Bucky’s arm whirred as Natasha struggled to get free, and elbowed him in the chest, not hard enough to crack a rib but enough for him to let out a grunt.
Tony could have listed at least two weirder things they encountered just this past week or mentioned Scott and Hope, or Carol and Rhodey, but he decided to let it go. Mostly because he was still trying to decide if Steve had just softly come out to him.
“Children of today!” Tony continued, leading Peter towards the elevator, “The great leaders of tomorrow!”
She wasn’t wrong. It just so happened that Tony had visited this estate once before, granted, he was more concerned at the time with getting as drunk as possible than memorizing the layout of the place.
Steve’s eyes snapped open, finding Bucky’s dark silhouette emerging from the elevator. His bowtie hung loose around his neck, sleeves rolled up haphazardly around his elbows. He carefully didn’t read too much into his friend’s debauched appearance. He deserved that peace of mind.
“Public displays of affection make people uncomfortable,” She said with a cryptid smile across her face, “Steve could learn a thing or two from you.”
As he rinsed the suds from his hair, he reviewed the plan he prepared during his run. He didn’t want to ambush Tony and lay it all on him, at least, not until he had a couple hours of sleep in him. He would have to ask Friday what Tony’s schedule looked like today to see when would be a good time for them to talk, preferably not before something important. God forbid he took Steve’s confession poorly only to have to rush off to dinner with an international shareholder.
Tony nodded. He’d long ago learned that most benefit dinners and charity galas were nothing more than a show. A business deal. Majority of the attendees weren’t there out of the goodness of their hearts. The one’s that dabbled in philanthropy were few and far between, people only wanted to look good, not do good. They wanted to shake hands with the right person in front of the press while handing over checks that barely made a dent in their pockets, all for some good PR to appeal to investors.
Bruce had finished up gather scans and blood samples and reassured Tony that he would have Friday let him know as soon as he knew anything. Tony thanked him, watching him disappear down the hallway towards his lab.
They drove into the city for dinner, and Peter spent half the time raving about their progress on his suit and the other half stuffing food into his face like it was his last meal.
“Let’s get Peter some water while Bruce runs some tests.” Steve suggested, but was already leading him out of the room.
Rogers cocked his head at him, a smug smile stretched across his lips, “Is Tony Stark admitting he was wrong? I must be dreaming—”
Tony rolled his eyes, “What, so you can catch me when I fall?” But Natasha was already out the window.
“I didn’t know,” Steve said suddenly, “That you and Tony—that you felt that way,” He drew in a shuddering breath, “I wouldn’t have, ya know…” he trailed off.
Tony shrugged. “Wouldn’t hurt to hear him say it out loud once in a while.” It wasn’t like he was actually upset. He understood more than most how difficult it could be to show thankfulness in situations like this. Not because he was ever ungrateful, but a simple
“On it.” Tony gritted out, forgoing the killer pigeons and pushing his thrusters to the point where FRIDAY was flashing red warnings in his face.
Tony only raised an eyebrow in return, but Bucky laughed and dragged him by the waist towards the center of the room. Bucky’s metal arm grasped his own, his flesh and blood hand pressed to the small of his back. They were pressed incredibly close, their faces only inches apart. It was hardly a dance—they swayed back and forth for the most part, an intimate moment to a slow jazz song that had Tony’s head swimming in brief confusion at the whole thing.
Tony hadn’t made his way to the kitchen if the untouched coffee pot was anything to go by, so Steve poured two cups and went in search for the man. A quick look into Tony’s bedroom confirmed he was still in the workshop.
Pepper only bristled at that. “It’s Ralph Lauren,” She said tartly, and tapped a stiletto-shaped red nail against the newspaper in front of him, “And you can explain
With a wave of his hand the holograms blinked out of existence. Tony leaned back against his workbench and met Steve’s gaze.
Tony let the nanites disassemble around him, leaving him in his black undersuit. He walked over to Peter and offered him a hand up.
Whew, that was a longer one! If this chapter seems familiar, it's because it's heavily inspired by the Italy mission in Uncharted 4. I also snuck in some silver fox Tony because I can't help myself.
Tony was met by silence. He looked at Steve, who was across the workshop, only a few steps away from the door. His hands were settled on his belt, but he might as well have had them crossed with how rigid he was. An emotion flashed across his face, too fast for Tony to place it, and he schooled his features into something more diplomatic, like he was talking to the press or a government official.
With that, Rorgg’s eyes rolled back into his head and his grip on the web dome loosened, his breaths growing even more strained.
“Are we any closer to finding how to wrap this up?” Clint haggardly asked over the comms. So maybe he was running out of arrows.
Tony Stark was technically a genius in the academic sense, but he could admit that sometimes he had a lapse of judgement when it came to interpersonal relationships.
Tony watched Peter’s chest rise and fall every few seconds, his brow furrowed even as he slept. He bent down and moved the now room tempered pack off his forehead, and pressed a kiss into his hair. “If he gets worse. But I think he’d be more comfortable here.”
Peter was starting to drag, his kicks getting sloppier and Steve’s fists coming closer. Cap of course noticed it too, and before Tony could really start worrying Steve caught Peter’s hand in mid punch and patted him on the back.
Tony jerked in surprise as Sam landed on his other side. “Actually, in drowning situations rescue breathing is encouraged.”
“She’ll wake up with a headache and in someone else’s clothes. You’ve been there, right?” She smirked as she started undressing the server. “There’s probably a backup generator, so the lights are only going to be down for a few seconds.” Natasha explained as she swapped clothes, “The only person who can get close to the items inconspicuously is a waitress.”
Rorgg immediately flinched away at the exploding cans, coughing and sputtering as Peter flung more towards him and Tony fired.
Tony pulled the covers back and was met by a pale, shaky, and snot covered Peter Parker. He instantly pressed his hand against Peter’s forehead, and nearly yanked it away when he was met with boiling hot skin.
“Hey Friday, order a shit ton of cannoli for Rogers in the morning. From that one place in Greenwich—”
Tony paused, unable to see Steve’s face from underneath the car he was working on, but from his tone, even as calmly as he tried to sound, he could tell he was irritated.
Right. He needed to get his suit. Go collect the other Avengers. Start thinking strategy. Tony was already halfway out his workshop towards the Quinjet by the time Steve had gathered his bearings. He caught his gaze, and Tony stopped for just a moment, giving Steve an earnest look.
He shoved off his coat and started to squeeze through the gate. He sucked in as much as he could, getting his head, arm, and leg through, but the metal of his arc reactor caught on the bars. He twisted, trying to hunch his shoulders and curl his spine so his chest could clear the gate, but it caught no matter which way he turned. A wave of frustration washed over him, and he mentally cursed the metal in his chest.
Tony flipped up his hood as they entered, following Steve throughout the store. He picked up chicken stock, a few vegetables, all the basic ingredients for soup. He threw in a few bananas, a bag of rice, and crackers in their cart, along with vitamin c and zinc supplements. A warm feeling bloomed in Tony’s chest, unrelated to the arc reactor, and his hand reached up to
Natasha motioned for Tony to boost her up to the air vent located at the top of the wall. With a few jerks she freed the metal panel off and shined a light into the space. She nodded and Tony set her down again.
“I can do a lot more than a two-step. Daddy dearest made sure of that when he sent me to boarding school.” Tony let out a short laugh devoid of humor. He shook his head, as if to physically rid himself of the memory of Howard. “I could show you sometime. Whatever you want—waltz, tango, square dancing—I’ve mastered them all.” He offered his most blinding smile. Bucky turned back towards him and shook his head, taking a step closer to Tony.
Tony made his way back to his armor, letting it comfortably wrap around him like a warm blanket. He pointed ignored the flashing alert on the bottom of his HUD informing him of his rapid heart rate and elevated cortisol levels. He closed his eyes, focusing on the familiar hum of his suit and and the warm air blasting through the heaters. His hand gauntleted hand unconsciously travelled towards his arc reactor, the chilled metal feeling more than ever like an unwelcome intrusion in his chest.
They finalized the upgrades to his suit just in time to meet the rest of the Avengers in the training facility. Peter perked up a bit surrounded by the heroes, bouncing on the balls of his feet as he animatedly talked at an exasperated Doctor Strange.
! What were you thinking?” Tony crouched down, his armored hands hovering over Steve like he was afraid to touch him but couldn’t help but want to poke and prod to make sure he was still in one piece.
Things came to a screeching halt in Tony’s mind and he froze up, realizing what he had just done. Thor would surely push him off, they weren’t out in public and on display. He was overstepping a boundary, crossing a line, showing how desperate and pathetic he was, that he’d accept affection even if it was a fabricated lie.
Tony turned towards him and was met with a serious face, not that his face was usually anything other than serious. Tony cringed, wondering if that’s what Bucky, what
“Steve Rogers also took drugs from strangers because they promised him super powers,” Clint chimed from the couch, eyes still focused on the video game in front of him. Steve furrowed his eyebrows, but after a moment he gave a reluctant nod.
), and then went on his run. When he got back he started the coffee pot before taking his shower in hopes that the smell would lure Tony out of his workshop.
Tony half registered voices quietly conversing above him. His side was pressed against a solid body, the soft thumps of a heartbeat underneath his ear. There was a hand carding through his hair and gently scraping against his scalp, and he let out a content sigh. The hand and voices stopped, and Tony frowned and furrowed his brow, his eyes still closed. He nudged his head a little and smiled when the hand returned to his hair a second later. He tucked himself into as small of a ball as he could, chasing the warmth of the body next to him, and slipped back into unconsciousness.
Like a period to the end of his sentence, Tony brought Steve into a gentle kiss. Their lips just brushing for a moment before melting into something soft and gentle. Unlike before, a wild confession in the midst of heat and adrenaline, this was almost reverent and unhurried, so full of love that Steve felt like if Tony let go his body would float off into the atmosphere. Tony pulled away but pressed a soft kiss to Steve’s brow, murmuring lowly against the skin there.
He shrugged his shoulders, but couldn’t quite shake the crawling feeling of guilt tickling the edge of his arc reactor.
Training was going smoothly. It wasn’t hard to integrate Spider-Man into their drills and exercises—he worked well as a bridge between air support and the ground fighters.
Tony shot a repulsor blast at the back of its head, not even making a dent. “It’s impossible to get through its skin. We’ll be here all week trying to take it down.”
Tony hopped off his stool and quickly threw a pair of jeans on over his undersuit, having not been bothered to change out of it after training, and headed out of the workshop and towards Peter’s room to drag the kid out of bed for the second time today, Steve travelling behind him.
surprised.” Steve took a steadying breath, “and I was jealous. It was a lot to take in but I promise you Tony, I
Steve shrugged. “Not really my thing.” Casually, because he couldn’t help himself, he asked, “Did you—did Tony get home alright?”
After dodging around a few guards they were directly under the window Natasha signaled them from. Clint unwrapped the grappling hook from around his back and tossed it up, metal hooks catching the stone railing around the balcony. He gave the rope a few tugs, confident that it could bear their weight, and started climbing. If his sternum or tailbone were giving him any trouble, he didn’t show it.
The room was instantly plunged into darkness. Tony didn’t wait for confirmation from Natasha or Clint. He pulled himself back through the bars, the pain in his chest spiking once more, and made his way back into the air ducts and towards the study. He crawled as fast as his chest let him, disregarding any finesse for stealth.
“If I get you into the ventilation system can you find your way there?” Natasha asked, the tightness around her eyes fading a bit. Tony nodded. The mental map he had of the estate was nowhere near cohesive and definitely did not include the air vents, but he had enough of an idea to guide him in the right direction.
keep him safe. He didn’t have to worry about being turned down when he asked for someone to join him for dinner or see a dumb movie.
"You should stop by medical too," Rogers knocked his hand against Tony's gauntlet, but his eyes darted towards the blue glow of arc reactor, "Make sure you don't have frostbite."
“Shit!” Tony fell back onto his ass as Clint pushed him off and turned onto his side with a groan. Tony flopped onto his back and threw his arms over his face, the adrenaline still coursing through his body, but relieved to hear Clint breathing again.
Thor, unfamiliar with the emergency releases on the side of his armor, began to strip pieces of his armor off. Tony winced as his armor was ripped apart, thinking about the hours he spent on this particular design. He sighed. Better the armor than him.
Bucky seemed to consider him for a moment before letting out a heavy sigh. “Well, this isn’t how I thought this was going to go.”
In case the title of this chapter freaks you out, I will assure you right now that the kiss in this part is NOT sexual/romantic. It's a purely familial kiss from Tony, to Peter's head. No lips will be touching here!
“We don’t have a minute, Stark. Bidding’s started and the hard drive is up next.” Clint said through clenched teeth.
“Hey, Steve?” Steve looked up towards the kitchen where Bucky had moved to dispose his apple core, his jacket gathered in his arms. He smiled gently at Steve, and he let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding. “Just talk to him.”
“The Átta will not leave until it has consumed the core of your earth. We must defeat it in battle to end this.”
“Sorry,” Tony hoped Natasha wouldn’t instantly chop off his balls as he pulled her in by her face and kissed her. To his surprise, she kissed back harder, flipping them around and covering as much as him from view with her body as possible. He stood pliantly, sandwiched between her and the wall for a few more moments, her hand coming up to caress his face as the guards walked passed without a second glance. When the footfalls disappeared, she broke free from the kiss and straightened Tony’s collar.
So, yeah. Tony was feeling a little raw. If he wanted to mope around in bed at 7 in the evening that was his business.
The more he thought about it, the more confident he was of his plan. At this point, he doubted he could change the minds of the public of his relationship with Thor, so he might as well take advantage of it. Instead of potentially creating more rumors that he was cheating on Thor or purposely trying to cover up their relationship, he would lean into it, validate and indulge them, and as soon as they got comfortable, he’d definitively end things.
Bucky’s hand squeezed his hip. He cocked his head back slightly, his eyes half lidded, a wolfish grin spread across his face. He made an attractive sight.
Steve’s resolve started to crumble as the silence stretched on between them. Tony had looked back up at him expectantly, expression soft and open, encouraging, if not a little curious. The sight of him made his mouth go dry. It was so easy to be swept up in Tony’s energy, he’d forgotten his nerves in the first place. But now, the confession he was prepared to make just a second ago was gathered like a lump stuck in the back of his throat. He was all too aware that this could be the last time Tony looked at him like that—unguarded, warmly, like a trusted friend.
Iron Man flew ahead as Steve and the rest of the Avengers boarded the Quinjet. Steve took the time to clear his head, ridding himself of anything that didn’t pertain to the situation ahead. He listened closely this time as Friday updated the rest of the team—they were heading towards a small town in Maine, the newest location of apparently
not an improvement. It was like anything he did led back to him dating Thor. He could blink and somehow, someone would say it was because he was madly in love with Thor and make a headline of it.
“Iron Man, think you can give me a lift to Rorgg?” Bucky called out. Out of the corner of his eye Steve saw the red and gold armor swoop down and lift Bucky bridal style into the air towards Rorgg.
“I’d let you sleep in but we’ve been subpoenaed by Cap for training, and we need to finish up your suit.”
“Friday, can you patch Thor through?” Tony asked, much to Steve’s apparent dismay. Before he could argue, the familiar blue eyes and joyful face of Thor appeared on screen.
He had tried going out with his friends, and that had backfired tremendously. He tried hiding out in the compound, but that only left the tabloids to their own imaginations and “inside sources”, and that was
Tony whizzed by, grabbing both mugs out of his hands, and started on one as he made his way to one of his work stations. A blur of blue projections followed him across the room, blueprints to different designs and various documents orbiting him like their own mini solar system, some disappearing seemingly at the flick of Tony’s eyes. He set down the other mug on his work station while simultaneously plopping down on a stool, spinning a few times with childlike—or manic—amusement.
They finished the simulation and rejoined in the center of the room for Tony’s personal favorite part of training days. To an outsider it probably seemed barbaric—a little too Fight Club-esque for a bunch of global level superheroes—but the one-on-ones had its benefits. For one, it bred a special breed of camaraderie between them, to watch their fellow teammates beat this shit out of each other. Second, it gave the captains a chance to get familiar with every individual’s fighting style, something to keep in mind during individual training sessions.
“Is this mine?” Steve was sitting on the edge of Tony’s bed, a red sweatshirt in hand. Tony shrugged and grabbed the sweatshirt, pulling it over his head.
His gaze instantly landed on Peter’s form on the settee perpendicular to them. He sat wrapped in a blanket and leaning gently against Bucky, his forehead pressed against the cool metal of his arm. They both were watching the TV with half-lidded eyes, a small smile on Peter’s face as he watched Harrison Ford shoot at a group of Ewoks.
That hadn’t been Tony’s intent at all. If anything, it was a purely selfish act. Steve was better company than any random date would be; he could always count on him to somehow magically swoop to his side and save him the mental power of trying to talk his way out of an awkward conversation, or instead of entertaining himself at the bar with too many glasses of whiskey that would lead to a PR nightmare, he could watch Steve charm the pants off every person in the room with just a smile.
“I’ll keep an eye out on him.” Steve offered. It wasn’t much, but it was enough of a relief to help him focus on training instead of worrying over Peter.
Thor dropped to the ground as they reached Central Park, making a b-line towards a hotdog vendor. Tony shook his head with a laugh. A few people had stopped in their tracks, eyes wide and hands fumbling for their phones as the Norse God of Thunder strolled passed. Majority of people though barely spared a glance, either locals used to the sight of superheroes or assuming the long haired man with a cape would ask for money as soon as they locked eyes.
Tony bent forward and grabbed his toes, the arc reactor touching the tops of his knees. “Just peachy, Cap.” Steve raised an eyebrow at him, and Tony sighed. “Peter seemed a little off this morning but clearly,” He nodded towards where Peter was excitedly greeting Scott, “Everything is fine.”
Bucky got a hold of Natasha and threw her off him, sending her straight into Sam and Scott. Bucky stalked over, but Natasha was back on her feet a second later.
“If that’s what you want,” Steve pulled out two spoons and a pint of Ben and Jerry’s ice cream from behind his back.  “Or we could exact revenge. You could go to the prom with Chase and show Thor what he’s missing.”
He dropped into the study, landing on his side in an ungraceful heap. Natasha was instantly on his side, hauling him up and dragging him towards the window.
He blinked a few times, letting his eyes adjust to the dim lighting. He gently lifted his head to see Steve, his mussed hair and peaceful features bathed in the soft blue light from the TV, passed out underneath him.
“C’mon, Clint. Breathe, goddamn it.” Tony vaguely heard the fight die down around him and Captain America's voice barking out his name over the comms. The sound of his own heartbeat in his ears grew louder as he continued to will Clint’s heart to start again. He was shivering, his thin undersuit a poor defense against the chilling wind and packed snow beneath his knees. A crawling feeling of panic was curling around his spine as he finished another round of chest compressions, Clint still unmoving, blonde spikes of hair freezing to his pale forehead. He ducked down again, sucking in enough air to make his lungs spasm in protest, the arc reactor a icy weight sitting heavily in his chest, and met Clint’s mouth once more.
. That’s rich coming from—” Clint yelped as he was snatched up in one of the bird’s jaws. Normally, Tony would have no problem letting the fucker drop, he might even push him in for a laugh, but it was more likely he would crack his skull open before the sheet of ice covering the river would give way.
“You’ve got to stop going on runs with Steve,” Tony said, pouring himself a cup of coffee before rummaging through the fridge for breakfast, “You’re going to hurt yourself before you ever catch up to him.”
Peter pulled on his mask and jumped towards the center of mats. Tony grabbed Steve’s arm, meeting his eyes.
, thought he was doing; dressing him up to the nines and using his all-American-patriot charm to squeeze a couple more dollars out of people.
. Tony nodded, and curled back into Steve’s chest. Steve inhaled deeply beneath him, and his hand gently ran along his spine, coaxing him back to sleep. The tension in his body was already melting away at the sight of Peter and Steve rubbing his back. With his mind at ease and his body comfortably wrapped in Steve’s warmth, he fell into a restful sleep.
“How are you feeling, Peter?” Bruce quietly asked. Peter flinched even at that, but let out a shaky breath.
Steve released a breath he hadn’t known he was holding as soon as Tony has Bucky secured in his arms, but in the next second an aching in his chest enveloped him at the sight of them flying through the air together. He couldn’t help but stare at where Bucky’s metal arm rested on the armor’s hip, a similar sight to last night at the gala.
Steve blinked. He couldn’t have heard that right, he must have hit his head harder than he thought. He blinked harder but Tony was still there, lips slightly parted, looking half mortified by his sudden confession, half imploring, like he so often did when willing someone to understand a simple concept.
That wasn’t much better. Peter had been napping for around five hours, and spent more hours asleep today than awake. His sleep schedule was going to be all out of whack, and Tony had the distinct feeling that May would not appreciate him returning her nephew on a nocturnal schedule.
“Right. I guess you saw…” Tony gestured his hand in a noncommittal wave as his words trailed off. Steve nodded. There was no use in dragging this out any longer than it had to be.
"I think I'll survive," Rogers frowned at him and Tony rolled his eyes, "Friday will monitor me and let me know if any of my fingers are about to fall off."
special between him and Tony. He was his own special category in his mind, a mix of new feelings attached to his name, separate from friends or family. It was incomparable. It was different than his friendship with Sam or his bond with Bucky. If anything it was more appropriate to say it was adjacent to what he felt for Peggy. Equally as important, but somehow
Tony waved a dismissive hand in the air and spun around the opposite direction, knees hitting the other side of his legs.
Tony felt a twinge of guilt. He was slightly out of his depth here; covert missions weren’t his specialty, he was more of a
“Hey, Pep! Pepper-pot. Pep in my step,” Sweat started gathering at his hairline, “What can I do for you? You look beautiful, might I add. Is that the new Hermès spring line pant suit?”
“Kid, are you actually apologizing for getting sick?” Bucky chuckled and lightly nudged his shoulder.
The need for air finally pulled them apart, but their hands remained clasped, their foreheads touching. Steve screwed his eyes closed and nudged Tony’s nose with his own. “You have no idea—you drive me crazy,”
Tony excused himself and headed towards Peter’s room. He knocked a few times, giving the boy ample time to hide any incriminating objects or make himself decent. A few seconds passed, no telltale sounds of a body falling out of bed and scrambling around the room. Tony knocked once more, a little louder, but the room remained silent.
he was in a relationship with Thor, something about Pepper breaking things off a few years ago because of his infidelity, an “inside source” gushing about their cosmically long distant romance—
It had been ages since Tony had spoken to Thor. A couple weeks, maybe a month at least. It was hard to keep track of nowadays, with most of his waking hours spent focusing on SI as the fiscal year came to an end, and on Avengers business whenever he had a spare moment. Right now was a rare day where his responsibilities towards both were a bearable load, meaning he had an extra couple of hours to dedicate to his own personal projects. Building a new Iron Man suit being the first on the top of his list.
Predictably, Steve was there, his back to Tony, beating on a punching bag like it had just insulted his mother.
“Steve. Believe me when I say I don’t want anyone else.” He took a deep breath and smiled softly at him. “I don’t love anyone like you.”
Tony popped the arc reactor core back into his chest, two pairs of relieved sighs filling the room. Rogers eyed the reactor for a moment longer, a wary look on his face. His eyes roamed across Tony’s torso as if looking for something, like if he stared long enough a new injury would appear across Tony’s stomach.
“You’ve got to be—” Tony groaned, rubbing his temples with his gauntleted hand. “Steve. Listen to me. There is nothing,
Tony didn’t bother to break his gaze as Bucky joined him at the bar. He sipped his drink and continued to track Steve’s form as he dodged and weaved between patrons, offering an apologetic smile as he passed by hopeful guests, eager to get a word in with Captain America.
Tony, perhaps sensing some of Steve’s inner turmoil, grabbed the sides of his head between his hands, the repulsors still warm from the fight holding his face so tenderly. Those two points and his eyes staring right into his, all of them anchoring Steve in the moment.
“Keep staring like that and you’ll have a guy thinking you’re in love with him.” Bucky laughed quietly, flashing a bright smile down at Tony.
“One second, honey.” Tony replied, blasting through the snow filled sky and taking down as many pigeon-pterodactyl hybrids as he went, “PETA’s going to have a field day with this one.” He mumbled, already irritated at the PR nightmare ahead of him.
“It’s alright kid. Been there, done that. Spent most of my twenties worshipping at the porcelain altar,” Tony rambled, shaky hands still rubbing circles across Peter’s back.
With an audible sigh of defeat, unable to keep his mind occupied, he let his thoughts drift to Tony.
He circled around the parasite once more, giving him enough room to have a running start. Steve and Thor goaded it, getting just close enough for it to reach out its arms and open its mouth, and Tony shot towards it.
If Peter was still set on spending the week at the compound they could start on a few personal upgrades to Peter’s suit. The kid had been spit-balling ideas the past few weeks, and Tony figured it was about time he learned to do proper maintenance and upgrades to his multimillion dollar suit instead of jury-rigging it like some high school home ec project.
Bucky slowly got up from the floor and limped over towards Steve. “Ugh, I’m done. I’m tapping you in.”
“Let’s get Hawkeye to medical and find Hulk. We can debrief after coordinating cleanup.” Rogers said, effectively ending their squabble.
about him. Air and gravity hung differently in his proximity. Animals raised their hackles around him. Babies stared; not because of his astounding frame, but an innate reaction to something new and foreign.
was appealing and Peter decided he was more inclined to the wet sciences, he was sure Bruce wouldn’t mind a few extra sets of hands in his lab.
He waited until she was a few feet off the ground to start his rappel down the wall. His chest ached, even more so with his labored breathing, but he kept his grip tight on the rope. It was a less coordinated climb down, more of a slide than anything if the rope burn on his hands meant anything. He tried to center himself as Clint made his descent, but all too soon they were on the move again, travelling through the tall grass towards the front of the estate.
Natasha vaulted overhead, landing on a spider that Steve hadn’t noticed approaching him, landing an impressive kick square in its face.
“You plan on sharing any of that?” Tony asked as he landed next to him. Obligingly, Thor handed over a hot dog loaded with condiments from the pile in his arms.
“Right now? I’m on top of the tram where my dearest Tony left me—” He took a sharp turn, already headed towards where his HUD zoomed in on Clint standing atop the Roosevelt Island Tram where a dozen of the flying creatures were circling him, “In about five seconds? The East River if Stark doesn’t hurry it up.”
Maybe Bucky had grown tired of Steve’s pissing and complaining after all these years, maybe he wanted to see what all the fuss was about—Steve couldn’t exactly blame him. He’d spent years wondering what it would be like to be the object of Tony’s affections. Tony was a passionate man—anyone could tell that just by looking at his work at SI, with the Avenger— and it wasn’t hard to imagine that passion extending to his love life.
It was a testament to how tired Peter must have been, because he didn’t argue or press on. He flopped to the floor with heaving breaths, the lenses on his mask closed.
?” Sam shouted as he whizzed past Steve, dodging another swinging leg. True to his word attached to the ends of each leg was a four fingered hand.
“Not the first spider you’ve seen with hands.” Bucky’s humorous voice crackled over the comm. An offended Peter sputtered through the comm before Natasha tsk’d.
Steve rolled his eyes and dragged Tony through the compound and into the garage, pressing him into the passenger seat of his own car. Steve drove them into the city, the windows cracked open just a bit. Tony closed his eyes, soaking up the sun through the glass and relishing the feeling of fresh air hitting his face. When he opened his eyes again, the car was still and off, parked in a familiar parking complex.
Natasha smirked, “You’re just mad I beat you twice in a row,” She handed back the shield to Steve and tapped Peter on the shoulder, “You’re up, little spider.”
“I’ll give them what they want and then throw it back in their faces. That should keep them off me for a while.” Tony explained, “I can date someone for a few weeks and really play it up, and then have a very public, very secondhand embarrassing, explosive breakup that not even the seediest reporters would want to touch with a ten-foot long pole.”
Tony was just donning the Iron Man suit as a bright technicolor beam of light flashed outside on the lawn, the branches on the distant trees blowing wildly in the gust of wind. The Bifrost dissipated and all that was left was Thor’s proud form stood atop burnt grass.
Thor spent most of his time off world, but when he did roam Earth, it was usually under catastrophic conditions. And if humanity wasn’t being threatened, he spent his time hanging out with Bruce, the two a seemingly unlikely pair, but best friends nonetheless.
“When is that,” Bucky waved at tablet in Tony’s hand, a picture of him and Thor locking lips shining brightly back at him, “going to end?”
When Clint made it to the top he motioned for Tony to follow. He warily eyed the stone wall covered in ivy and the rope, palms a little clammier than they were a minute ago. He didn’t want to slow them down any more than necessary, but he wasn’t a super-soldier or trained spy. A fall from that height would mean he probably wasn’t getting back up.
As they approached the outskirts of the town the damage caused by the aliens was already apparent. Giant craters still smoking from impact littered the streets. Crushed cars and half collapsed buildings gave the impression of a meteor crash site. But the weirdest thing was the giant, dome-shaped net over the majority of the city.
He realized that the last time Steve had been down here was when he decided to kick off this whole fake dating plan. All his time that usually belonged to Steve had been redistributed to Thor, and every time Steve saw Tony and Thor together, that strange look would cross his face and he would hightail it out of there before Tony could get a word in.
“It looks like...power lines? Hm. No, they’re electrically charged, but my repulsors can’t cut through them.” A beat, “Oh, gross.”
Tony pulled away for a second, eyes searching Steve’s face with bated breath, a slight look of disbelief on his face. Whatever he was looking for he must have found, and pulled Steve back in for a proper, deeper kiss. The cool metal of his gauntlet wrapped around the back of his neck, Steve’s own hand mirror him, gripping the back of Tony’s helmet like a lifeline. He couldn’t tell if the thudding in his chest was from his jack rabbit heartbeat or his throbbing ribs, if his head was dizzy from kissing Tony or the possible concussion he just acquired.
“Hey, stay focused.” She reprimanded him before taking out a dagger and attacking it’s face once more. Steve shook his head, trying not to let himself be distracted by Tony and Bucky.
“Eh, do as I say and not as I do,” Tony waved his hand flippantly in the air, paused, and then amended, “Actually. Don’t do as I say. And definitely don’t do as I do. You know what? When in doubt, consider Cap. He turned out alright.”
He stepped out of his boots and tip toed to a spot clear of acid, not wanting to burn the soles of his feet. He stood next to Thor, admiring his handy work, sliding his gaze from the parasite’s dead body to Steve and further to where a group of civilians and news reporters were standing a few blocks away, cameras out to capture a glimpse at the creature and Avengers milling around.
