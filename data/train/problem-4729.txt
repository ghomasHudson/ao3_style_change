“My old man dragged me around wherever he went. Didn’t do me any good, trust me,” Dean says around the rim of his mug.
As though on cue, his phone goes off. He slides the green button to answer, pressing it to his ears.
“Castiel.” He nodded back.
"I don't want anything, Dean." Cas replies, tired and shaky. "I just want you to be okay."
"Yes, Dean?"
Sam let out a snicker and Brady didn’t talk much after that.
"Fuck!" Dean hisses, dropping the knife.
"You'll always be to me." Dean replies, 'no chick flick moments' be damned. "What did I do to deserve you?"
"Is it about Trenton and Bettelheim?"
“Yeah, fair enough.” Jo shrugged. “You really ready for this?”
,” Cas mutters, keeping his voice low. “There are things you don’t fully understand.”
About fifteen knocks later, the door opened and Dean was met with a grumpy blonde.
"It can't be…" Dean says, voice barely a whisper. "You– I saw you–"
"Shit. He didn't tell you..." Sam fumbles with his words. "Dean, we couldn't cure you like we tried to cure Crowley."
"Whatever." Dean got up, squeezing between the seat and Castiel's legs to get outside. Castiel moved inside and Dean claimed the seat next to him. Castiel fidgeted with his seat belt clip, trying not to be obvious as he glanced at Dean.
The clinking of a glass caught their attention and Sam turned to see a woman holding up her cosmo, ready to address the crowd.
“Oh, Samuel. Don’t be upset, deary,” Rowena cooed. “I stayed out of trouble like a good little witch, didn’t I?”
," he fumbles. "I– I was so goddamn happy you’d finally get to always be around.”
“Happens when you’re raising a bunch of idjits.” Bobby grumbles.
A beautiful shade of pink colors Dean’s cheeks, and he opens his mouth to reply, only to be stopped by the sound of footsteps coming from the stairs. Through the corner of his eyes, he sees Dean tense. A few seconds later, a young girl, no older than seven, comes bouncing down the stairs, her pants bunching up at her ankles as she skips the final step and chooses to jump to the floor. She pauses when her eyes fall on him and Dean.
Dean dropped his gaze, his cheeks heating up with the memory of Cas rubbing his back after the nightmare. It felt so unreal, like he was surrounded inside out by Cas’s warmth; so far from the cold numbness that seemed to have made home in Dean’s heart. Once again he was met with the mother of all urges to reach out and touch Cas, to hold onto him until Dean’s feet felt like they were on the ground.
Dean shudders an exhale, "Uh, why me?" He asks. The question is abrupt and as vague as it can get, but Dean can't bother with words right now.
“See for yourself.”
"You woke up here," Dean finishes.
He watched as Cas reached out with his free hand, only to stop an inch away from Dean’s skin. His hand retracted faster than it came. "Are you feeling alright?"
Dean lifts his head, green eyes looking up at him with an unreadable expression, "Would you do the same for me or Sam?"
Dean ignores the pointed looks Cas is aiming at him. “Ma’am we just need to cover all the-”
It was way past the point of telling himself all those lies.
"Fuck." Cindy curses, "I'm trapped in the house and I don't know what's going on. Please, I need help."
“Get the husband out of the way so Terra doesn’t have to choose between him and Louisa. Makes sense," Dean said. “But what’s the deal with Emily?”
Within seconds, Dean is on him, lips pressing soft kisses to his jaw.
Cas sighed, "I can't heal you, I'm aware."
Camael looks at him and down at his hand before shaking it, grip to soft and unsteady, as though he's never done it before. Dean can't help but snort, knowing that's probably the case.
"Gotta admire your patience, Cas," Nadia mumbled.
"That was not a lie, sweetheart." His voice barely a whisper. "There is no reason I would not like you. You're one of the most amazing people I have had the privilege knowing."
Cas nodded, eyes on the floor. “Permanently.”
“Right, orders.” Dean grumbles, not knowing where the annoyance is coming from, “You know where to find us.”
"Thank Christ," the man gestured for them to follow along. "I'm Dr. Homer, senior pathologist."
"And today is a Friday, that's three days."
"Cas?"
Cas scoffs, meeting Dean's eyes in the mirror, everything unspoken between them hanging in the air.
"Hey there, Ella," he coos as she blinks up at him blearily. "I'm your Uncle Dean and I'm gonna spoil you rotten."
"He thinks he's really funny." Sam grumbled.
For once Cas didn't argue and Dean thanked every God who wasn’t listening. They turned another few corners and came to a stop at the sight of two familiar silhouettes. Sam was slouched against the side of a building with Nadia crouched down next to him, her hands pressed to his bicep.
"Well, you're lucky I'm an amazing chef," Dean pats his knee and stands up, making his way to the kitchen. "Don't want your first human experience to be spoiled by shitty food."
"Good," Dean nods. "Hope she likes her room."
"Took you long enough, I thought you got eaten by wolves," Sam snorts. "Eileen says hi, by the way."
“We all saw him win, Owen,” the younger man says, his eyes fixed on Castiel. “Just let it go.”
The much longed vacation had started to turn into an itch under Dean's skin, and he knew sticking a blade into something that went bumping in the night was the way to scratch it. Sam and Cas seemed to be more than happy to sulk around like losers doing nerd shit like their lives weren't a regular freak show. Sam being Sam was elbow deep in books. Seriously, who read this much? Why? Dean’s brain wanted to liquefy itself at the thought of sitting still and reading for that long.
"Yeah, alright," Sam breathes out. "Thanks, Dean."
“I think you know who deserves to have it,” Michael claps his shoulder. “I will have you escorted back to Earth. Good luck, Castiel.”
“Sweetwater, Wyoming,” Cas supplies, from the death certificate.
Castiel follows Dean and Camael through the clearing, keeping an eye out for the rest of the troops taking their positions. They once again make sure their coast is clear before heading for the personal heavens.
“I’ll never get enough of that,” Dean chuckles as they pull apart. “Come on, let’s find Sam.”
"Good to know you're planning to go celibate for the rest of your life."
"M'kay." Dean mumbled, flopping down on a chair opposite to his.
The picture—it’s so bizarre. Dean clings on to those memories like a raft in a flood, though he knows if he goes poking hard enough, it will all feel flat. Two dimensional. Like the memory of a child that grew up to live inside a different man. He hasn’t felt that touch, that
Dean rolled his eyes, "Come on, buddy. It's pretty clear."
“Awh, don’t take it personally, Sammy,” Dean pats Sam on the shoulder, grinning wide. “It’s not because of your face…mostly.”
“Tell you what, I’m gonna go find you something to eat and I’ll send it along with Cas.” Dean said, “Gotta go check on Jess.”
“Yeah, well. You say that now and before I know, they’d be off to prom.”
"Shit, Cas...thank you," he said, offering a smile he hoped was reassuring and grateful. "For doing that for Dean. I know how important this is, so yeah, thanks."
“Finally,” Sam makes a face. “I’ve been talking for the past ten minutes and you hear
Dean tilted his head, looking up at Cas. The air around them grew warmer and Dean knew where this was going. He sighed, getting off the couch. “Come on, Cas. Let’s finish packing before dinner.”
Dean's not sure if he's surprised or disappointed. On one hand, people's description of heaven does no justice to what it truly looks like. Dean now understood what Cas meant when he said heaven reflected earth but not literally. The place looks like a whole ecosystem made out of all the wildlife that was destroyed on earth. On the other hand, Dean was silently hoping he could see Cas' wings. But that didn't stop him from gawking at the angel. To his surprise, Cas was looking back at him, mirroring the awe on his face.
Cas ducks his head to hide his smile as he follows Dean out of the driveway and to their final interviewee. The houses in the neighborhood are almost identical, with a little personal touch by each resident that gives it character. He leans against the railing of the porch steps as they wait for the door to open. An elderly woman is on the other side when it opens, dressed in pale blue pants and a matching cardigan wrapped around her.
Cas sits up straight instead, "Are we going to keep ignoring everything that has happened between us?"
“Have you been in contact with him since then?”
"Cas, wait. What now?”
It is absolutely impossible and effectively unnatural for a human soul to sense the presence of an angelic being. Castiel is not sure how this particular soul is able to do that. Then again, beyond the bearing of being the righteous man, Dean Winchester’s soul is intensely capturing. When Castiel first laid eyes on it, the soul shimmered and swirled blithely, pale green and white curling around each other, making everything else in its surrounding insignificant.
"Sam."
“It was more than-” He stopped when he saw the grin on Dean’s face. “You’re an ass.”
Castiel sighs, “Raphael does not see the angels as nothing but his suicide bombers. Once he gets what he wants, he won’t hesitate to get rid of any loose ends that might turn into an obstacle in his path.”
The righteous man's soul is bright, brighter than anything he has seen in his entire existence. It does not cry or plead, barely reaches out to Castiel’s grace like a warm embrace. He finds himself drifting forward to the very beacon of light and hope in the land of death and destruction.
Suddenly, there is no skin for him to kiss, instead Cas is next to him, a hand wrapped around his waist. "You have had too much to drink, Dean." He lets himself be guided over to a chair, too tired to protest.
He ducked down to tie his shoelaces that didn’t need any tying, to hide the color rising in his cheeks.
Cas stared at him with an unreadable expression before whispering, “I’m an angel.”
“Sorry, Cas was looking real hot.” Dean chuckled.
“Still alive and kicking,” he grunts, as if that’s disappointing. “As for me, I’ve got nothing interesting going on ’cept for an arthritis that’s getting worse.”
Here we are, at the end of the road.
Castiel sighs, "I appreciate the sentiment, but Uriel is under my commanding rank. I have the leeway to issue orders to him." He says, "I assume you would like to drive back to your motel?" Dean notices Castiel's flight mode kicking in.
"Hey, baby," Dean lets go of his wrist and pulls him close by the lapel of his coat, "You know why I cut in on you two in the first place?"
"Tank's still not full, huh?"
Cas nods minutely, "Sure, I will go on that walk now "
It's so painfully endearing, Castiel feels the separation like a physical thing.
Cas follows him down the hallway, huffing and audibly rolling his eyes. “I don’t enjoy watching you suffer like this.”
"Suburbs are fucking creepy," Dean scoffed. "Their dumb fluffy carpets and their frilly little curtains.”
He stalks over to the desk, stomping harder than usual against the old wood. Looks like it's time to murder his brother.
Dean blinked back in surprise, “Greece?”
“Can I kiss you?”
Sam snorts, "You'll have to narrow it down a bit more. Remember the case with the Romans?" he asks, and continues before Dean can answer, "The DA is calling in one of Roman's clients and I'm prepping my questions for him."
"What did you tell Sam?"
Jaime scoffs, “Dude, get in line.”
Castiel scowled at him, "I'm very attached to this coat," he said, feeling defensive of the piece of garment.
"I'm Dean," he introduces, "Now your turn."
"Who said we're doing nothing? We're gonna train you on the intricacies and pleasures of human existence."
"Yes, I have seen dinosaurs," Cas says, wistfully. "They
“I would appreciate it if there wasn’t a next time,” Cas said softly. “You were drunk when you drove back here. You could’ve gotten into an accident–”
"He loved the guy a lot, I guess," Dean said, forehead crinkled in a thoughtful expression. "It's pro’bly why he was stupid to do that. Love's always stupid."
“Too bad you’re not the bridesmaid, Bela.” Another girl with bright red hair huffed in amusement, “Can’t use the excuse of tradition to sleep with him.”
"Thank you, Dean," Cas smiled at him, giving him a reason to stop babbling. Dean's cheeks had turned a beautiful shade of pink and he was examining the wallpaper with newfound interest.
“Whatever you are, I...” Dean trails off, almost a whisper, “I need some fucking answers, please.”
Dean dips down, licking a strip along his cock, making Castiel's hips stutter. Dean's hands pin his hips down, biting and licking at the skin on the underside of his thigh. Castiel keens under the touch, carding his hands through Dean's hair. Dean moans headily into his skin, the vibrations travelling all the way to his nerves.
“Not to be crass but saving the world might be a little more than nothing.”
“Shut up.” Ruby mutters.
“One more report has been filed about an hour ago.” Sam says, as they enter the room, “One Heather Finnigan.”
Anna giggled and Ruby made a gagging noise. Dean kicked them under the table, aiming to hit at least one of them. Fortunately, Benny was the one who got kicked so the whole thing dropped there.
Irene didn't pay Dean any attention, her eyes remaining fixed on Castiel. "Tell me, Cas. If it weren't for the Winchesters, wouldn't your life have been so much easier?"
Dean looked over at Sam for help only to get a shrug in response.
passes through those blue eyes and he nods sagely.
"Gotta ask you the same thing, Cas," Dean laughs, feeling dazed.
"It's been said," said Dean with a grin. "You can take me out of their lives and Sam and Cas would be off on their merry way. But, you gotta stop killing altogether."
Castiel knows he doesn't need to answer that for Dean to know his response. Instead, he pulls Dean closer, pressing a kiss to the top of his head, and says, "I'm glad you're here, Dean."
"What the fuck?" He hears something crash into a wall. "Salt circle?"
Dean raised a brow, "So, what's the verdict, doc?"
Cas glances at him, raising a brow, "Besides you?"
A knock on the door startled him and Dean slipped to the floor, "Come on in."
. Tell me you want this."
“We only have one house left to interview,” Cas says. "Do your 'talking' as you please."
Robert Walter’s daughter, Rory, doesn’t prove to be as useful as he had anticipated, which is expected since she was the one to find her father’s body. She informs him that her father left late at night to show the house to a client calling from Australia, and when he didn’t return home or pick up her calls, she rushed over and had found her father’s body. Castiel tries his best to console her before returning to where Sam stood, filling him in.
"Thank you, Camael." Castiel replies, smiling at him in gratitude. When he turns back to Dean, the hunter's eyes glints mischievously.
In hindsight, nothing much had changed.
“I still can’t believe Ruby just handed over the weapons like that,” Dean comments as a part of explaining everything that went down. “You sure these are not fake or anything?”
"I'm tryna fix this, Cas. Just let me." Dean knows how pathetic he sounds but he can't find it in himself to care. "I let you down more than once, I don't wanna do it again. Just let me make this right."
"She wanted to sell the house before news spread," Sam says. "Financial emergency or something, didn't really get time for chit-chat."
" he repeats, a content sigh escaping his chest. "Feel like I don't have any of my bones."
Castiel laughed, and it was a really adorable sight. His eyes crinkled in the corners. “I do have reading glasses.”
Castiel’s grip on his blade tightens. He looks out through the window and sees Dean stepping out of the house, a middle aged woman closing the door behind him.
Fuck.
“You don’t need to take blame for that, Dean.”
“Go to sleep, Dean,” Cas said softly, startling Dean back to the present. He should probably have stopped staring at Cas but Dean couldn't exactly find a convincing enough reason to do so, and his brain was too battered to afford the luxury of coherent thoughts.
Cas looked down at him with a frown pinching his brows, "I don't sleep, Dean."
"Sammy's got a point." Dean grins at the douchebag, "You're desperate for our help, or you wouldn't even be here. So play nice, and you might get something out of us."
"I love it, Dean," Cas interjects, his expression fond. “Now, can I have my breakfast?”
Cas’ lips twitch into a smirk. “Nothing you can prove.”
“I don’t think he’s the type of guy who does casual.” Dean replied.
Castiel smiled, dipping down to press a kiss to the top of Dean's head, "Did you, Dean?"
“Then that would be my choice to make!” Cas takes a step closer, and Dean has to concentrate very hard to keep himself from backing away. “You can’t make my choices for me, Dean. It’s impossible to coexist when everything is built on secrets.”
“Dean, you need to stay here.” Cas ushers, “It’s safer.”
Dean turns to the side to glance at him, "Did you just call me a bitch?"
Cas, but he'll probably smash his phone against the wall. They’re a bit tight on money so that’s not wise. If there is a gun to his head, Dean would say he wants to make out with Cas. And, that’s just the baseline. Dean, for one terrifying moment, thinks about thinking about this—the feeling of absolute fucking insect population in his stomach just because his head is on Cas’s lap. He really decides to think about the fuck-all of his feelings about Cas, but then, Cas pushes his fingers through Dean’s hair and—
"Why the fuck would you love me?" Dean snapped, looking the gift horse right in the mouth.
Dean slid his hands down to grab Cas’ ass, pulling them flush against each other, “Is that so?”
Jo mumbles something under her breath and Dean grins, "Girl it is. Gimme a name."
"Why can't I seem to handle something my father and my brothers seem to run easily?"
Castiel does not understand how Dean can be so full of love for everyone else around him but can never be selfish enough to spare some for himself. He leans forward and captures Dean’s lips in a soft kiss, keeping away all the love he can muster up solely for his lover.
“That’s as simple as I can explain,” Cas glared at him pointedly.
“Dunno, like someone was watching us. It’s probably nothing.”
"You gotta stop putting yourself down like that," Sam quips. "Ever bothered to stop and ask Cas what
"It should be fun explaining all this to him in the morning." Dean throws his left arm around Cas' waist, pulling him closer.
"I enjoyed the movie a lot," Cas says, barely a whisper.
Next chapter very soon!
“Interesting." Castiel hummed around the rim of his cup. "I often assumed architects to be sitting hunched over their drafting table, and not humor a boring guy at parties."
"It's just a shirt and a jacket. Stop whining," Dean muttered. "You wanna freeze to death in the middle of a hunt?"
"She's a baby, Dean. She'll like literally anything."
"The earth is surreal during a rainfall."
"Yeah, that's not how it works," Dean scowled, pulling on his gloves.
"It's Lucifer's markings, like a brand." Castiel trails his fingertips through the cravings. "They seem to have retrieved more from the crypts than we were able to."
Someone is pulling the man away and helping Dean up from the floor. Probably the bouncer, Dean thinks.
"Enemy's enemy is our friend, Sam." Zoe says, "We need to survive and for that we need to be respected, and feared." She flings something that looks like a bag of toes into the fire. Dean internally gags. "Once we help Lucifer rise, we will be feared and respected. Even the ancestors will grant us all their power. The heretics will be unbeatable."
And so Castiel, accompanied by Tamoah scour the building, which by now is in a state of wreck, among an unnerving number of vessels strewn across the floor. The sight is heartbreaking, many of his brothers and sisters losing their lives misled by some absurd cause that was fed into their minds as being beneficial to the angel kind.
"You suck," Dean tugged him into a kiss, hands shaky as he fisted Cas's shirt in his hands. "I love you," he murmured as he pulled away, the words like honey on his tongue. He couldn’t wait to repeat those words as long as Cas would let him.
"I'm glad you know how important it is that I leave," Cas says with a smile that doesn't quite reach his eyes.
"So, this Italy thing, is this boss of yours gonna be there too?" Jess asked.
“Do you know her name?”
The man blinks, "Earth?"
“Heard you two are planning to settle down here,” Irene smiled graciously at Cas, and when Castiel frowned at her she chuckled and added, “Word travels fast around here.”
“Son of a bitch. No wonder the company was too eager to pay for our stay.” Dean said. “What about the tourists?”
“Then I will stay and watch over you," Castiel smiled at Dean, his grace flaring at his core when Dean returned the smile.
“Cas, man, come on,” Dean chuckled. “You said it would work.”
long enough that by the end of the day some strokes ended up looking like chicken scratches
“There isn’t enough training in this world to deal with me, sunshine.”
“-And you had to call off the whole thing.” Dean hazards a guess. Cas looks so sad over the prospect of humans fucking up, Dean wants to hug him. Instead, he loops an arm around Cas’ waist, pressing a kiss to his cheek. “So, I can go in just like that?”
The next thing Castiel heard was Dean's cry of pain and nothing else mattered. He was not sure why Sam wanted him to wait. He began to move but Sam stood up, grabbing his own machete and walking towards Irene from the side. He gestured at Castiel to reach her from her back, and Castiel nodded in understanding, moving a pace slower behind Sam.
“What’s that?” Cas asked.
“Like hell I will.” Dean draws his blade just as Nemiah and Camael pull their own out. He hears movement inside the tunnel, labored footsteps drawing closer to them. A figure emerges from the tunnel and Dean blinks back in surprise.
"Stupid fucking chicken," Dean mutters under his breath, stomping his way over to the oven. He grabs the tray and heads over to the counter looking anywhere but at Cas. It's stupid and childish but Dean never got the instruction manual regarding what to do when you almost kissed an angel of the lord.
This chapter is a little bit shorter than the usual ones. I wrote this one while I was at the brink of a writer's block and had a hard time working around it. Anyways, hope you enjoy!
“Hey, I’m not saying it’s a bad thing,” Sam said. “You being nice to him must help, especially after everything that went down last time he was human…”
Dean grimaced, “Sorry ’bout that.”
Castiel gives her a nod of encouragement, and turns to Camael, "I need you to store the weapons safely for the night. I hope the plan is clear. We will be leaving first thing in the morning."
"You're incredible, Dean," Cas says. "I look at you and I'm left speechless."
Dean pulls away slowly, panting, “I…” In the thirty or so seconds they were kissing, Dean’s brain has managed to fuck off all the way to Miami.
"Look, I know it's weird. Hell, I myself don't know how I'm here." Dean says, "So you test me all you want and keep the gun up. Shoot me if I attack you."
His hair is an unruly mess, and he's wearing one of Dean's old t-shirts, the collar hanging loose around his shoulders—knowing damn well Dean's not going to tell him off for raiding his wardrobe. Dean had given up his bubble of personal space a long time ago for Cas to come and go as he pleases. His pajama bottoms are scrunched up around his feet. It makes an adorable picture, Dean hurries to look away before he does something stupid.
Cas blinks at him before slowly nodding. "Okay."
"You let a fucking stranger stay with you?" Sam barks.
“I hope the reason will be revealed with our visit tomorrow,” Cas runs a hand through his hair, looking around the room. “Where is Dean?”
“Bingo.”
They help Eileen up the backseat and Jo climbs in with her. Dean panics for another moment before Jo whacks him on the forehead, "Drive. I'll call Sam."
"You said there is so much you don't understand about...
"Feeling good?" he asks as they lay side by side, sharing soft smiles in the dark.
He followed her line of sight and snorted when he spotted them.
“Why is that?”
It's only a little later that he realizes the implications behind his words. He leaves that thought in the
Dean snorts, "Got any names?
around here.”
"I shouldn't have taught you that," he jokes, earning a laugh from Jaime.
Cas nods and places the now empty bowl on the coffee table, his hands instantly going back to his shoulders to pull the blanket close. Dean has to remind himself every few minutes that the man in front of him is literally an ancient cosmic being, but Cas makes it so easy to forget that. It doesn't take much to pretend like he's just a plain old Joe, though there is absolutely nothing plain or bland about him, every small feature standing out as quite peculiar in the best way possible. Dean knows if they had met under different circumstances, Cas would
Dean couldn't help but smile at that, wanting nothing more than to crawl back into bed with Cas and go to sleep. But he had two days left to leave and his clothes hadn't even made it out of his closet. He got off the floor, the cool air in the room slamming against his bare skin. Cas looked so adorable when he slept, lips slightly parted and body buried under a mountain of blankets. Dean was always the one to sleep with one pillow and a blanket, for which Cas called him a psychopath and said they'd sleep in his room all the time. The clock on the nightstand said twenty minutes to seven and Dean figured they had some time to spare. He peeled the covers back and climbed under them, instantly having an armful of Cas. Dean pressed a kiss to the top of Cas' head, inhaling the familiar scent of vanilla that seemed to follow Cas everywhere and had become a part of Dean's life too, so much so that he sometimes felt it on himself. Everything about the man had become a part of Dean's life, always giving him a hand when he needs one. He would hate to lose it.
"Shit. What's wrong?"
"The Iliad," Cas supplied.
"No," Cas says simply. "Perhaps I should name this plant so that you can mock me in return."
"Thank you!" Dean threw his hands up dramatically. "What'd you find?"
"Dude, you don't have to—"
It took him a second to realize he had offered their real names, but she knew Sam's already so there was no point faking anyway.
"I could say the same for you," Cas said, a smirk evident in his tone. Dean's hand stilled at his calf as he looked up at Cas, only to have the other man drifting his eyes up and down Dean's body albeit shamelessly.
"Dean!"
Cas frowns at him, “Dean, are you feeling ill again?”
"You gotta drink it, you know." Dean jokes, his heart rattling like rocks in a tin can in his chest. Cas looks up at him, blue eyes cold and far away. Dean swallows with an audible click, "Heya, Sunshine."
The 'good measure' in question is Dean wanting Cas to stay. It's not just stupid, but downright ridiculous, some silly need for wanting to feel the way he does when Cas is around.
Dean waggles his brows, "I swallow too."
“Mom will skim off my allowance so it’s totally fair,” Jo counters. “Paying is paying.”
Dean made a noise of protest but lifted his shirt off, revealing an expanse of freckled skin jarred by three long scars that resembled being scratched by nails rather than claws.
Dean hates how much he wants to feel appreciated. Castiel is giving him way too much and Dean has nothing to give in return, nothing good.
Dean frowns, "Who?"
"Thank you, Dean," Cas murmurs against his lips, amusement springing in his bright eyes. "Boyfriend, is it?"
Dean ran a hand through his hair, shaking himself out of his head. He needed a drink. Or four.
“Didn’t know you lived here,” Dean commented, an unfamiliar distaste in his tone. “Then again it feels like the whole damn town lives in this neighborhood.”
“Dean, are you listening?”
Perhaps, it is time for him to introduce himself to Dean. In the previous briefing, Zachariah made it clear that Lilith was not far behind in breaking the next seal and Dean’s choices are going to matter. Waiting until Dean comes back from the hunting trip is not advisable.
"You know what, there could be." Dean adds. "I don't think they got time to do anymore raiding once they took Sammy…"
Dean clenches his fist, nails digging into his palm to reroute the burn bubbling up behind his eyes. The mere thought of waking up next to Cas everyday makes him want to cry out with happiness, because Sam is right, Dean wants to belong with Cas so much it hurts. He wants Cas to be the one that finally clicked.
He lets out a watery laugh, "We've never been, Cas. Hell, we've never even been in the same book. I'm the crappy fourth sequel." He grabbed his clothes off the floor and got dressed quickly, turned away from the bed.
“I’m gonna take all seven.” He muttered, shoving them into his suitcase. Charlie put her phone into her pocket and walked over to Dean.
——————
"You don't know, my ass." Dean grumbles. "Why were you going all Gordon Gekko on him? Guy was terrified."
“Shut up.”
"I met a wild mole once in a prairie. It lived in what is the present Finland," Castiel began. "When I found it, the creature was digging a burrow in the soil."
Cas blinks up at him, taking a second to process his question, then shakes his head, "I could help you with dinner preparations…"
“Jeez,” Dean held his hand up in surrender. “Night, Cas.”
Cas rolled his eyes, giving Dean a look that translated to an inside joke Sam had no idea about. “It could be a coincidence.”
"Ugh," she snarls. "Charlie."
“Cas...he pulled Dean out of a terrible place he was in,” Sam said, smiling fondly as he watched his brother and his best friend so relaxed for the first time in years, right where they belonged. “Since then he’s become family. A little more than that to Dean.”
Castiel faltered at that, "Really?" He blinked at his brother, taken aback, "I barely even joined."
joke with. It’d hit too close to home) in his hand and the man standing next to him. Cas’s scruff has grown a little darker and his brows were scrunched up in a frown like a pissed off (and very adorable) cat. Dean knew he was being such a chick but they were alone, and Cas would never have him the way Dean wanted him to, so he could indulge for a minute just to keep him from spiraling with the intensity of everything he was feeling.
"Everything looks good on me," Dean smirked, earning a laugh from Cas. The familiar flutter that kept resurfacing every time Cas laughed, or even smiled his way, returned,  hitting him hard, knocking the air out of his lungs.
Even after everything he gave up for Dean, and for the world, if Cas still thinks so low of himself, then Dean’s doing a shit job as his best friend. It’s just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to making it up to Cas for kicking him out of the bunker without an explanation. Speaking of which…
enough, he can almost make out the shape of his mom’s lips on his belly while she blew raspberries, making him laugh until he couldn’t breathe.
Castiel followed him back into the room, the warmth making him shudder. "You should lock your door. Anyone could have just walked in."
“Cas, what the hell is going on?”
She signs, ruffling his hair.
"Cas coming back or not, I'm still in love with the guy. That's not gonna go anywhere."
"Woah there, buddy." Dean lowers his gun since it's as good as a twig against a grizzly bear, "You can't drop news like that and bolt on me." Dean swallows the lump stuck in his throat. "What do angels want with me?”
Andddd that's a wrap, folks!
There was nowhere else he would rather be.
Dean lets out a muffled gasp, knuckles white as he curls his fingers into the sheets, holding on for dear life.
Sam nodded, "Alright."
“I’m sorry.” Castiel breathes.
, Dean had told him. Castiel wonders if Dean would be proud of him right now if he was here.
"Jesus, you're like a kid," Dean threw his head back and laughed, and Castiel's eyes followed the line of his throat.
Sam rolls his eyes, "You've been to hell." He reminds, helpfully. "Anyways, the guy was divorced. Wife lives in Montgomery."
"Don't want that happening, do we?" the man grinned, his hand still holding Dean's forearm. "Oh, where's my manners. I'm Luke."
“And that’s where you are wrong. Sam and Dean are capable of making the right choices. It does not matter if they are humans, they are fighting for the good side, which unfortunately, is not heaven.”
The night sky is cloudy, barely any stars visible, good thing since he hadn’t washed Baby that morning. Dean cuts off from I-290 into the beautiful suburban nightmare of Clarendon Hills, a fancy range of homes, with the cheesiest damn picket fences he's ever seen.
Dean snorted, “We got Rowena to thank for that.”
There are so many things wrong about all of it, but Castiel does not question his superiors, like any other good soldier. He nods curtly and walks out of the room, ready to head back to the Winchesters.
Jo purses her lips, eyeing Dean wearily. He’d had an elaborate and very much uncomfortable conversation with Sam before leaving Colorado and his brother had promised to leave it at that. And he could see how hard Sam’s trying not to bring up the topic. Eileen’s more subtle, changing subjects when she thinks is needed and helping him stay distracted with chores. Out of everyone in the family, Jo’s the one person who fortunately inherited Dean’s need for avoiding hallmark moments as much as he could. So when she wants to talk, there’s no way Dean’s going to get out of it.
Nemiah laughs at that, "He's annoying, but we'll take what we get."
“That’s wonderful!” the woman grinned, clapping her hands together. “Oh, where’s my manners? I’m Claudia Jacobson, and this is my husband Henry.”
Dean nodded absently, mumbling quietly under his breath and shaking his head along to some music only he could hear.
“Good, he’s coming your way,” Sam grins, sliding off the stool and walking away.
"You did good, Cas." Dean says, meaning it. "Saved our bacon, didn't you?"
"There is a spell…" Cas says.
Sam’s eyes were constantly scanning the surroundings looking for anything—
“A group of angels led by Raguel and Nathaniel attacked us once we managed to open the crypt.” Ambriel replied, unimpressed.
Dean kicked his leg where it was hanging off the edge of the bed, “Snarky asshole,” he mumbled, climbing off the bed. “I’m gonna get my beauty sleep.”
"I could have you."
“I…Cas, I know I fucked up, okay? I know, trust me. And you have every right to be pissed at me for kicking you out. I get it–”
The touch lit up a new wave of longing in Castiel, shaking him to the core. He wanted Dean closer—wanted Dean to want him closer—to hold him and protect him from everything that dared to hurt him.
Nor the cause of the friendship I emit, nor the cause of the friendship I take again.
He has an idea regarding Dean’s intentions here. Dean’s apparent need to explain himself to Castiel seems to be nothing more than the beginning of a goodbye. Everything that had been left unsaid between them are the final strings that hold them together. Once those are cut out, Dean can be on his way without any grievances holding him back. Perhaps, it is good for Cas too. If they ever cross paths again after this case, they could pretend to be two hunters working together, and not Dean and Castiel, who were once good friends.
“Jesus, that must have taken a toll on her,” Sam winces. “So, our culprit doesn’t want anyone to buy or stay in this house.”
“Yes,” Cas said gruffly.
“The part of you that sticks out like a sore thumb is what makes you different, man. And we’ve all got our sore thumbs,” he leans forward, trying not to lose his train of thought in Cas’s bright blue eyes. “In our line of work, being rigidly fixed in one box is what brings trouble. You were always a bit soft around the edges, Cas. It’s a good thing because you never let anyone mold you, but you did what you liked. And you did it because you wanted to. It’s all a part of your little rebel streak. That’s what I like about you.”
They are quite the experts at hiding how they really feel, but Castiel can see the vulnerability of two children who suffered the untimely demise of their parents in their eyes. He wishes he could stay, but there are cases to work and people to save. He's eternally grateful that these children are generous enough to give Castiel a place in their home whenever he visits, and it very much pains him to leave, but he has to do his job.
"I can fly that distance without any trouble."
Dean parks his car across the first victim’s house. “If she annoys you too much, just knock her out.” His fingers momentarily brushes Castiel’s forearm, eyes soft as a hint of smile flickers across his lips.
“Oh, good,” Cas says.
Dean chuckles, throwing his arm around Cas’ shoulder, “Then order away, Commander.”
Castiel huffs a laugh, knowing he would never be able to deny Dean anything, "Close your eyes."
"I suppose that makes sense," Cas says, blue eyes bright as he looks at him. "Thank you."
“That is not what I said,” Cas squints at him. “You’re making an awful lot of assumptions today.”
“I don’t know how to.” Nehemiah cuts him off. “He doesn’t even know Castiel let me back in. It’s not like I can just barge into his heaven and destroy the afterlife peace he deserves.”
Castiel leans further back against the bed, watching as Dean bobs his head up and down, the warm pressure of his tongue twisting something low in his gut. He gasps when Dean swirls his tongue around the head, reaching out for the man.
"Rowena escaped," Cas started. "I tried to stop her, she put me under a spell and I couldn't move. There was no way I could—"
"We have a few hours till sunrise." Camael says, "We have restored the tent if you wish to rest."
"A case," Cas says. "You know it was bound to happen at some point."
Dean’s never been the one to respect traffic rules out in Kansas just out of spite because he never gets to drive in Chicago. It’s faster to ride a turtle to work than try to drive Baby during rush hour traffic, so he begrudgingly became a subway man. But now he’s got his leg pressing down on the accelerator hard. Eileen has another contraction and Jo says they’re six minutes apart and it’s all good until they start becoming four minutes apart or less. Dean racks his brain to try and remember anything he learned about pregnancy in ninth grade biology but all he can think of is being too horrified to actually pay attention in class. They pull into the parking lot and Jo scrambles to get Eileen a wheelchair while Dean helps her out of the car.
(See the end of the chapter for
Nadia must have noticed as she moves her attention to Dean and Cas, "Who are your friends?"
Dean leans his head against the steering wheel, feeling the purr of Baby’s engine vibrating through him. It’s hard to breath, the air mixed with the scent of himself, Cas and sex. He’s plumbed the depths of the kind of low that no amount of faking can mask.
"I suppose it's something only the elder siblings feel."
“Huh,” Dean considered the question, “I kind of think it’s something you build up. You find someone and you grow around each other and if it works out well enough, why bother if they’re your soulmate or not.” He said, “Why’d you ask?”
“Hey guys—” Sam just had to come in that exact moment. Cas pulled away like he was burned, taking a courteous step back from him.
"It's fine, Cas. Nothing some stitches can't fix," Sam batted his hand away.
Perhaps, one day, Castiel would be able to say with absolute certainty that he was going to stay. Until then, he would try his best to be by Dean's side; after all, if the choice was his, there was nowhere else he wanted to be.
Heaven is filled with millions of human souls and finding Sam among them through the power of his grace is impossible. Perhaps, if it were Dean's soul, Castiel would have been able to identify it quite easily.
"Seriously? This how you treat a dying man?" Dean complains, reaching over to flush down the toilet. He's
“You’re here,” Dean found himself blurting out before his brain could catch up, or maybe he was still concussed.
"So, before you get bored of my speech," Dean's hand closed around the ring in his pocket. He pulled it out and got down on one one knee, "Marry me, sweetheart?"
commanded it?"
Instead of pulling away, Dean was being pulled in. Yet he couldn't find it in himself to complain.
The music began playing and Sam and Jess stepped on the platform for their first dance, and Castiel switched between watching them and watching the look of absolute adoration on Dean's face.
Cas continues kissing down Dean’s throat for another few minutes—or hours, who the fuck knows—and Dean feels each press of his lips through his veins and down to his bones. When Cas pulls away, the
“For my Patroclus?” Castiel flicked away a smear of dirt on Dean’s jaw with a flick of his thumb. “In a heartbeat.”
"Don't worry, he'll calm down in a minute," Sam said, nodding reassuringly.
As much as he knew Dean was concerned for his safety, the idea of staying back at a place that was not even his home while Sam and Dean were out hunting was unimaginable. Castiel wanted to be out there—be useful in Sam and Dean's endeavors. He had to contribute in some way if he wanted Dean to let him stay, because it was only going to be a while before Dean realized Castiel was nothing but a burden.
try to convince me you’re anything but good. I might not be able to see your soul anymore, but I know it without a doubt. You’re a good man, despite the mistakes you’ve made. Everything you have done for the people you love—everything you have been through for this world—is the evidence of it.”
"What happened?"
“I did not.”
"We'll wait until she has the mind to send a postcard."
"Sammy, stop," he cuts him off, not having it in himself to think about anything other than Eileen and the baby making it out healthy. "She and the baby are gonna be fine, don't work yourself up before you even know what's going on. I'll get tickets for the next flight, just hang in there until then."
"My true visage can cause you harm, Dean," Castiel explains. "You might not be able to see my wings but you can feel them."
"Wasn't all me, once he was good enough to stand on his own feet, Sam pretty much raised himself. The kid worked hard to get where he is right now."
“I’m Cas, and this is Dean,” he introduces. “And who are you?”
He pulls into the driveway of the house, the yellow police tapes making it stand out from the rest of the neighbourhood. The streets are empty, the eerie stillness of an untimely death clinging to the air. After one quick look around, he ducks under the tapes, twirling his lock pick between his thumb and middle finger. Gone were the days when he could rip open doors from its hinges with a touch of his finger, so Castiel crouched down next to the handle and started unlocking, glancing behind his shoulder every now and then.
Cliffhanger again? I'm sorry ;) Hope you enjoyed the chapter. Let me know in the comments! See you next week.
“How’d you know all this?”
“Nah,” he waves his hand in a vague gesture. “Got the residents’ list?”
A blonde woman in hospital scrubs sat down next to Sam. "Hi there, Cas. I'm Jessica, Sam's girlfriend."
Cas rolled his eyes, “You will have to give me a better reason.”
"Jenna, baby…I'm so sorry."
“Corner right pocket,” Castiel slurs, lining his cue and aiming at the right angle. He knocks the ball in the right pocket just as he had called, but not before potting the eight ball along with it.
“Why are you still standing here?” Dean shot back, eyeing the direction Cas just disappeared in.
“I know,” Castiel smiles at her. “Until then, this job doesn’t look so bad.”
Dean chuckled, “Go sleep in your bed. Trust me, your back’s gonna thank me in the morning.”
"Sure, how's Castiel?"
"I had called Nadia to come get us," said Sam, leaning against the side of the building, swirling the machete ideally in his hand. There was something about the way Sam held himself that Castiel knew as a sign of him bracing himself to ask a question."
"Indeed. I'm the one who gripped you tight and raised you from perdition." Castiel replies. "Like I said, you are an important piece in the grand scheme of things." He says, as though he's talking about the weather. "All in good time, Dean. I should take my leave now."
"Oh," Castiel mouths softly. "I assume I will need this spaghetti you were referring to."
Right now, he needs Castiel.
"What crawled up your ass and died?" Sam asked as he slid into the passenger seat.
Dean selects a couple of items and heads over to Cas, who has his eyes trained longingly on a light blue cardigan.
"Don't apologize to me, go back to the dude." Dean says. "I'll see around on my own, Commander."
Dean groaned, but stayed still. Castiel thrust his hips forward, urging Dean on. He was growing crazy with the need to have Dean fully inside him, like shock waves pulsing down to his spine.
(See the end of the chapter for
"It's something to be cherished," Cas nodded, tapping his fingers on the table. "With the right company of course."
. Castiel wondered to himself, knowing he couldn’t be anymore wrong as he stared at the man next to him.
"Good," Dean smiles back at him, buds of hazy bliss unfurling in his heart.
"The Harry Potter kind?” Cas frowns at him, and Dean just shakes his head in resignation. "What do you need for this spell?"
“I’m fine, Sammy.” Dean blurts out.
“Wow, you didn’t even deny,” Dean chuckled. “Way to stroke a guy’s ego.”
Dean wanted to object but he knew Cas wasn’t asking. He grabbed the glass and pills that Cas seemed to pull out of thin air and gulped down, trying not to feel like a kid about to get his ass whooped for sneaking out, under Cas’s steel blue gaze.
“Have you considered the fact that perhaps he’s waiting for you to return? Every moment you spend here is agony for him.”
"Woah, none of that, big guy." Dean reminded him. "I haven't even told the guy yet."
Months pass by and many of his brothers and sisters get wasted away in hell as they continue their search for the righteous man. Castiel silently observes humanity in the meantime, new life being born and old souls making their way back to heaven. Humans living their lives under the vision of free will, making choices with such confidence, believing they can shape their destiny. Castiel does not envy them, as choices lead to disobedience which in turn leads to fall; and that is a fate he does not wish upon anyone, let alone himself.
“Lord knows I’ve tried to get it past your thick skull that you should give yourself more credit,” Benny mutters. “You’re a damn good man, Dean.”
“Cas, I—” is all he manages before Cas pulls him into the kiss, hands hot and unforgiving on Dean’s skin.
“Lie down,” Cas reached to tug at his arm until Dean sprawled down next to him on his back, both of them staring up at the same ceiling. “There was a man I used to know a long time ago. He used to live in what is now Andaman and Nicobar Islands. He had a strict rule that he never broke, no matter what.”
The room falls silent at that, Dean fiddling with words to find a reply. Cas breaks the silence.
For the past two days, Dean had been ignoring his calls and turning the other way around anytime he spotted him. Castiel was not sure what had happened between them but he knew he should have stopped Dean from walking out on him that night.
“What for?” Castiel narrowed his eyes, "Where is your car?"
“I practically live here,” Nadia replied, gesturing down at her pajamas. “I hate seeing her like this. She used to be so full of life…” she ducked her head to rub her eyes. “Dammit.”
"Hey, no degree is worthless." Dean assured. "One day, if you wanna quit your job and move to some cabin in the hills, going to art museums and squinting at the paintings disapprovingly through your glasses, you can do that."
Sam sighed, wishing there was a way to get legal documents, a marriage certificate to be specific, for a legally dead convict and an ex-angel.
The world comes to a screeching halt, the only voice reaching his ears being the small laugh that bubbles past Cas' lips and the only sight filling his vision being the stormy blue of Cas' eyes, crinkled at the corners.
"Not very good, Commander." Camael says. "Now you have come back, and there is nothing to worry."
“Right,” Dean mutters, tone clipped. Cas glances over at him to see Dean’s features morphed into something akin to disappointment. He doesn’t understand why.
she signs to Jo, and turns to him. “It’ll be over-rushed later in the day.”
He grabs a cue from the side rack and twirls it around in his hand, locking eyes with one of the men at the pool table. He’s the youngest of them all, dressed in a red flannel with a black shirt underneath and washed out dark jeans. Castiel grins at him, pulling a hundred dollar bill from his pocket.
"Only the blind knows the value of eyes," Dean says, grabbing a spoon and scooping up a bit of spaghetti sauce. Without much thought, he extends it to Cas, his brain catching only when the spoon is right in front of Castiel's lips.
Dean’s not sure which part he’s supposed to freak out over—that he asked the question at all, or that it came out all accusatory like from a jealous wife on a soap opera. From the way Cas’s head snaps up so quickly, Dean’s pretty sure he pulled something. His eyes are wide, not like the kid with his hand in the cookie jar, more confusion than surprise on his features.
"Is that okay?" Cas asks in a whisper, his whiskey warm voice rumbling deep from his chest into Dean's skin. "How are you feeling?"
up from her nap?”
“That’s more like it.” Alastair grins, “If only you could see yourself now, covered in blood and guts. You belong here boy.”
"Cas, what's wrong?" Dean asks, dusting his pants as he gets off the floor.
“Now if my memory is correct, you were the one who insisted I watch those movies,” Cas grinned softly. “You can’t alter your words according to your convenience, Dean.”
“Trust me, putting your life on hold for your kids is the wrong way to go about it. You gotta let them get adjusted to the way things work for you,” Benny says.
“Anything solid to prove she’s who we’re looking for,” Dean replied, pushing open the front door. “Sam, you take left, Cas right. I’ll take the stairs.”
“Castiel.” They shook hands. “And I have ran out of things to say.”
Sam stares at him with an expression of blatant disbelief before he lets out an albeit hysterical laugh, "Do all of us a favor and go after him before he overthinks and freaks himself out. Please."
Dean rolls his eyes, “Well, there isn’t anything to repress. What’s gone is gone.”
"Good to see you too, Dean." Ruby has switched bodies since the last time he saw her. "Hey, Sam."
"Stone," Sam corrected, not sure how else to contribute to the conversation. "And I gotta admit, salad on pizza feels like a crime."
"I assumed you would have decided to retire."
Castiel jerks back into reality, fiddling for an answer, “I shouldn’t.” He mumbles.
"Excuse me," Dean felt a tap and his shoulder. "You're blocking my way to the carrots."
"Who said I'm worried?"
Irene ducked her head, tucking a loose strand of her hair behind her ear, “I would’ve gone off about how great this neighborhood is if you two weren’t investigating two deaths that happened here.”
"I’m all good. Besides, you're in no shape," Sam replied.
"Stealing my best line there," Dean nudged his shoulder gently.
Cas makes a humming noise around the fork in his mouth and Dean grabs a broom and heads to the attic. The stairs are as creaky as it can get but Dean trusts Benny's handiwork, not to let Dean fall and break any bones.
Cas doesn't reply, leaving the silence hanging heavy between them. A few moments later the soft sound of the front door shutting reaches Dean's ears, the empty cabin wringing the air out of his lungs.
“You’re here.” Dean states ― not his smartest moment.
"I have never had 'spaghetti'," Castiel replies, using air quotes to put emphasis on the word.
Sam snorted, “You have no idea.”
Cas offers him a soft smile, "I believe, after all this time, the universe owes us that much."
(See the end of the chapter for
"'Course. You deserve that, sunshine," he kisses Cas' forehead. "Gotta treat you right or heaven's gonna reign their wrath on me."
“I don’t know, okay?” Dean snaps. “This is fucking insane. Angels, heaven, all that crap can’t be real. And what would heaven want so much from me that they send in a freaking angel to pull me out?”
“Woman, definitely. Dark hair, worn out clothes, pale.”
"Can you look at me, Dean? Please?"
"Careful, it's hot," Dean warns, before he can stop himself.
Dean scoffed, "I can't do this now," he said, feeling exhaustion running deep down to his bones. "We'll figure something out in the morning."
“I insist,” Linda waves them off, springing to her feet and heading to the kitchen.
A soft click of a door has Dean rising his eyes up to meet the soft blue ones he feels like he can't get enough of, as little as he has seen them. Cas stands leaning on the pole of the arch, dressed in Dean's clothes, his hair even more askew, a stray drop trailing its way down his neck.
“You don’t drink to this extent unless something is wrong,” Cas says, his thumb rubbing circles on Dean’s knee. “What happened?”
Dean rolled his eyes at his dad, but couldn’t help but smile, all of it feeling surreal. He turned to Cas who was mirroring his smile, blue eyes soft and warm. It felt good to be home.
“Copious quantities,” he chuckled, every muscle in his body aching with the effort.
Cas spins around, spatula pointed at Dean like a sword, “I’m well
"Dean," he reached out, hands moving on its own accord as he pulled the hunter into a hug. Dean stilled a moment before settling in Cas's arms, a pained noise escaping his chest.
thing but that's just a load of bullshit in our case. So yeah, forever. Whatever that means for us."
God help his soul, he's too far gone.
“Italy? What?”
"No point asking you to stop, right?"
“Bi,” Dean muttered, and added because he was a little shit; “And, you must be Sam’s straight friend.”
"Uh, I'm fine." Dean says, pulling on a faded grey t-shirt, "You came down here for that?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Sam nodded gratefully, "Thanks, man. Still, if something's up or you gotta leave, then wake me up."
“Who did this?” Cas asks, his tone burning with fury, so much so that Dean pulls his hand away on instinct.
"I don't need anything from you, brother," Castiel shakes his head. "We painted humanity as the weak link in creation, meanwhile look at us. And I too hold responsibility for what heaven has become. We fight our inner conscience and with each other, only to end in destruction. Look around us, brother. All these lives would have been preserved if we were not trying to prove ourselves superior to everything. Do you think this is what our father would have intended?"
“Walter was on facetime with a client while he was attacked,” Sam says, leading them over to an empty corner of the room. “The sheriff talked to them. Apparently, there was someone behind Walter and the client asked who it was. Walter turned around and saw something and started screaming, and that’s the last thing they heard before the phone was dropped.”
Dean doesn't say anything in reply, just leans forward to press a kiss to Cas' lips. He feels Cas smile into the kiss and run his tongue against Dean's bottom lip, deepening the kiss. They sit there for what feels like hours or days, lips against lips, the whole world fading into a soft melody in the background. The whirlwind of emotions in his chest flicker and fade off like a stray flame, gentle warmth taking its place. They pull apart, foreheads touching, smiles soft and careless.
The angels nod and scurry off.
"You got a dog," Cas states, dropping to his knees in front of the mutt. "Hello, Miracle. I'm Castiel."
He thought, but those words felt like poison on his tongue. It didn't matter that he cared or not. Cas gave up everything he had and some more only to think he didn't have a place in their life. It hurt more than Dean thought it would. Dean would hand over his heart on a silver platter if Cas wanted him to, but the selfless son of a bitch would never ask.
"Take a left and pull over there."
Charlie gasped, "That's it, you're officially one of us." She exclaimed. "Took me years to get him to call me that. Also, he's told us a lot about you. In fact, he wouldn't shut up."
"There you are." Gabriel exclaimed. "So, did you and green eyes boink?"
"I'm fine, Cas," Dean turns to him with a weary smile. "You think we can afford one more quick trip down there?"
"We saved the world, more than once. That should make up for it."
The Clydes have been talking nonstop for over twenty minutes now, and Cas—even while being the patient one—was starting to get antsy. He shifted his eyes over to Dean, silently indicating at him not to punch them.
"Got one of my own now, don't I?" Dean grins at Cas, ignoring the empty weight the words leave on his heart.
“I will try my best,” Cas says, and he can only hope the investigating officers would come up with something believable.
Few minutes later, Nadia pulled into the parking lot, looking very much angry before her eyes settled on them and her expression turned into relief. Dean had substantially recovered from his haze by then and was standing upright, though leaning against Castiel's side on occasion, which he was sure was more out of comfort.
Sam looked up at him and snorted and Dean rolled his eyes, unable to hold back a chuckle, partly from the relief of finding his brother alive.
"I do not require sleep, though if I need to, I can fall asleep. Especially since I'm in a human vessel." Castiel gives him the first lesson in Angel 101.
Castiel couldn’t help but mirror the infectious smile, “Perhaps, it’s the influence of my company.”
Dean laughed mirthlessly, “Yeah, when I kicked him out.”
Dean has spent—or rather wasted—his entire childhood and teenage years seeking validation from John, looking for ways to be the son John pretended he raised Dean to be. Sam got whiff of the situation earlier than Dean did and he didn't give a shit about what John wanted or didn't want.
“Come here and sit, Jo,” Dean tries, knowing it’s of no use.
"Great," Dean mumbled, pushing past the swinging doors.
"I wouldn't have to if you'd fucking listen to me!" Dean ran a hand through his hair, messing up the almond brown spikes even more. "All I'm saying is you deserve a break after all this."
Dean runs a hand through his hair, eyes falling shut as a soft breath bubbles past his lips. He could see the picture painted behind his eyelids; white picket fence, two and a half kids and a dog, the perfect family. The warmth seeps into his heart, growing, growing and swiveling akin to a soft summer breeze. He's holding a hand, a familiar warm hand. Somehow Dean knows the hand belongs to Castiel. For once he wishes it would hurt, just to remind himself how out of his reach his dream was.
Cas narrows his eyes, "You're being unnecessarily rude. I can do a lot more than boiling water, considering I have been around—"
Eventually, Sam and Bobby retreat back to their respective rooms, leaving Dean and Castiel alone. The air grows heavy between them, and Castiel watches the pale green and white glow of Dean’s soul swirling around each other in a frenzy. He could get lost in that soul forever; nothing else he has ever seen beats the virtuous beauty of Dean Winchester’s soul. Even as the righteous man sits a few feet away from him, his head thrown into his hands, the warmth of Dean pulls Castiel closer. For the first time in his life, the idea of being utterly and completely lost does not scare him.
"I will visit soon, I promise," Cas smiles reassuringly.
"Let's keep looking then," Dean says, and adds for good measure, "Don't get me wrong, it's not because I want you out or anything. I just thought you would wanna go back to your family…"
Sam blinked up at him, taking a minute to process the question. "Tuesday."
Sam snorts, “I try.”
Sam sighed, “Dean and I aren’t just coworkers, he’s my brother.”
“Can’t believe I missed it.” Sam says, reminding Dean of something Castiel said.
"The Gloxinia sitting on the window sill of his apartment says a different story."
“What the hell was that?”
“How are you holding up, Cas?” Dean asked suddenly, his head turned to face Cas where he leaned back against the wall.
"You keep pretending as though you don't know."
Dean was angry. He was angry at himself, he was angry at everyone that died and left him carrying the weight of their loss.
“You kidding, Dean?” Bobby says. “‘Heaven has work for you’ sounds like a joke to you?”
Not that this is a date or anything.
Cas sighs, "I don't want to trouble you, Dean."
‘More like a
“I’m so happy for you guys.” Dean couldn’t help but me more proud, his little brother all grown up and building a life for himself.
“I’ve been running with these weapons for a while now, and taking the demons on a merry go round with me.” Ruby says. “Take the weapons and go find Sam.”
"Please, don't shoot!" she shook her head, eyes wide and glazed. "I was just—"
"Good." Dean says, pulling off his boxers in one go, "Fuck, that's hot." He grins, peering up at Castiel through his lashes.
“I’m not sure.” Castiel hauls him to his feet, scanning for any visible injury. Castiel taps into his grace and uses the energy to null any aches on Dean’s body. The hunter shudders softly, his soul letting out a gentle flare. “Let’s go check.”
Cas cocks his head, "Why is that?"
The faint smell of coffee woke Dean up, and he followed the scent straight to the kitchen, rubbing his eyes on the back of his palm.
There isn't a single tangible answer for it. When he looks back at the time he spent with Dean, everything about him counts as a response to her question. Dean is a whirlwind of things. He's crass but gentle, challenging but understanding, he's hard around the edges and soft in his heart. He's anything and everything.
“Didn’t know you were a romantic at heart, dude,” Sam laughs. “Sounds like you’ve been thinking about this a lot.”
Sam pinched the bridge of his nose, “You know what? I’m gonna go pick up Nadia and I’ll swing by to get you guys,” he grabbed Baby’s keys from the table and walked out of the door, but not before throwing him a sad smile. Asshole.
"You don't do that anymore?"
Dean laughed, throwing his head back, “Guess you lucked out on that because I have a reputation of talking people’s ears off.”
"I don't know," Cas mumbled. "Did you catch—"
The pile of books on the table were tall enough that Sam couldn't see past it, which was why he startled and bumped his knee under the table when the chair opposite to him scraped against the floor. It had nothing to do with the exhaustion he was feeling from spending way too much time the previous night looking up ways to find a very powerful witch with a deadly book.
"I bet it is," Dean chuckles, knowing the joke will probably go right over Cas’ head.
"Then you need not worry, because," Castiel stares straight at him, “I’m an Angel of the lord.”
"I have never seen that thing," Nemiah says, "Hope it would be enough."
Maybe good things do happen.
Dean splashes a handful of water on to his face, watching it grip down in the dirty mirror. He never looked in the mirror while he was a demon, terrified of what might look back at him. His eyes might be green now, but his heart still feels dark like ink, blood tainted with the lives lost by his own hand. Back then it didn’t feel anything. His mind was hollow and the lines between right and wrong were all blurry. As things got clearer, the walls came crashing down, suffocating him.
——————
, and they used to joke about how since Cas knows everything about everything, he could switch jobs every couple of weeks. Back then it felt so easy.
, but then Cas looks about three seconds away from throwing him against the nearest wall and that’s when Dean gives in. He pauses at the door to his room, turning around and reaching out to hold Cas by the shoulders. “’M sorry, okay? Shouldn’t have drank so much and dumped my crap on you.”
“Hey, it’s all on this hot piece of ass.” Charlie pointed at Meg, “She lured me into ditching you.”
Cas opens his mouth but Dean glares him into silence because he's on a roll.
"You deserve that, Dean," Cas smiles at him softly. "After just a few days of your company alone I've realized how you give everything in you to the people you care about."
"We will have to work on that self esteem of yours."
"I need to find my siblings," Cas says in a rushed whisper, his hands stilling on the spatula he's drying up. "There is a war raging and I cannot stay here being useless."
"Not all women who love women are lesbians, Dean," Cas muttered, thankfully not too loud.
Dean huffs a laugh, "You know how to make a guy feel good."
“When did you start seeing her?” Cas asks, trying to distract himself from the feeling of Dean’s hand still resting on his arm.
, before he fucking explodes.
"Yup, you got me," Dean chuckled, reaching out to ruffle his hair. Castiel bat his hand away, smiling despite himself.
Castiel notices the way Dean stiffens next to him. All of the other neighbors were welcoming and seemingly unfazed by him and Dean, two men, being in a relationship. Cas is familiar with the working of the world enough to understand Dean’s reservations with being perceived as a queer man, especially considering his upbringing. The fact that Linda is someone of the older generation must not be helping. Though the way Linda said
“You were the only new person here besides those two,” she shrugged. “Are you an agent too?”
"Bruised your ego, huh?"
He throws his cigarette to the floor, crunching the butt under his boots, “I would very much appreciate it if you stopped talking.”
That's all the confirmation he needs to open the door and push Cas down against the seat, straddling his things. The space is a little two small for two large men but he makes do. He leans forward, nipping at Cas' jaw, the scratch of stubble like electricity through him. He feels Cas' half hard length against his torso and doesn't wait for anymore foreplay, because Cas doesn't want Dean like that. There is no reason for him to want to.
“So, no regrets?"
"Not gonna look the gift horse on the mouth," Dean replied. "I was thinking we could sit back for a while."
Dean does the bravest thing he has ever dared to do. He leans forward, tilting his head and presses his lips to Cas’s. It’s a kiss,
It had been two days and thirteen hours since Castiel turned human. He wondered why it felt longer than that.
There wasn't much to up chuck except alcohol and bile, and maybe his own guts. After everything went down the toilet he dry heaved for a minute, tears burning like lava behind his eyelids. The warm hand that landed on his upper back and rubbed down gently didn't help when all he wanted to do was flinch away and let the earth swallow him whole.
"Achilles' true weakness, in my opinion, was not his heel, but his fondness for Patroclus," Castiel said. "The desire to avenge his companion led him to self destruction."
"Cas, hey," he reaches out, finding Cas's hand and squeezing it. "Thanks, man. Really."
"Another 'guy'," Cas finishes, and Dean would've laughed at the air quotes if those lightning blue eyes weren't glaring him into silence. "
“What you did to protect your brother does not define you,” he replied simply, rolling up on his elbows to look at him. “Come here, Dean.” he murmured.
Sam pursed his lips, "Oh, I'm sorry."
you.” Dean replies. “Your life is not worthless.”
“He’ll be here, just don’t worry about it, ‘kay?” Dean rubs her back. He feels a wet splash against his feet and looks down at the pavement. “What the–”
Sam's jaw tightened, "Don't you dare—"
Sam glanced at Dean, who sure enough had his shoulders drawn in a rigid line and jaw set hard. The shift is microscopic but Sam had known his brother long enough to catch the meaning behind those little twitches. If there was anyone who knew his brother as well as he did, it was Cas, and sure enough his eyes too flicked to Dean for a moment.
Dean's already salivating like a damn dog, but the sound of the front door opening has him turning around.
“I would be worried if you were not a bit of a ‘basket case’ considering the life you lived,” Cas said, folding his arms around himself.
“Dean,” Cas said softly, and Dean jumped when he felt a hand over his own where it was wrapped around Cas’s wrist. “Why would I get bored of you?”
There wasn't anything Rowena-esque happening so Sam dropped the filtered search and started digging around for anything that remotely fit their category. Apparently, the freaks of nature were on a sabbatical because the papers were empty, so was the internet. The weirdest news of the day was a guy from Florida getting arrested for accidentally setting his neighbor's house on fire. Go figure.
“So, how does this whole God thing work?” Dean asks, finally getting the nagging question out of his mind. “I mean, there’s your dad and then there’s these other Gods…”
“Wouldn’t hurt to know Sammy’s opinion on this,” Dean chuckled. “He was the one with the imaginary best friend.”
“You better be careful, Sammy.” Dean grins.
After a week of locking himself up in his room almost all the time and barely being able to look Cas in the eye, the idea of being left alone in the bunker with Cas makes his stomach drop. Dean feels pathetic. After everything Cas did for him, he can't even find in himself to talk to the guy without wanting to move to Mars. Cas doesn't deserve this, any of it.
And what is more frightening is that he does not feel guilty, rather he feels liberated.
“No, but the voices were persistent,” he said. “Prayers and requests, sometimes from Sam but mostly it was you.”
"Fair enough." Dean folded a shirt and placed it in the suitcase. "You're not taking that sweatshirt."
Perhaps, he was wrong. Pain, apparently, does not strictly have to be the kind that is physically afflicted. Dean is tormented by the memories of his time in hell, all those days of torturing and being tortured. Castiel is a little more sure that Dean Winchester is remarkable, as when he touched the man’s forehead, his nightmares were made up of visions of not the thirty years of being tortured, but the ten years and thousands of innocent blood that was spilled by his hand. Castiel watches the righteous man in awe, not being able to fathom how even in his subconscious, his soul aches from the pain he caused. Dean must be really proud of himself, to be such a noble soul even after all the hardships he has faced.
"Did it help?"
"At least we got one of them."
that settles in his gut any time he remotely thinks about moving on still remains as strongly as ever. There’s nothing in this world that can replace the piece of him that Cas took with him when he left.
"You still believe I can't hold on my own?"
"Cindy, I know how tough it can be to digest all of this. But you need to know it's not your fault." He says, "Sometimes you mess up and stuff happens... stuff you can't fix. All that's left is to move on."
," Dean finished with a disgruntled sigh. "What'd y'know? You've never been to school. You've never even been to prom!"
"I don't remember exactly," Castiel says, exasperation evident in his voice. "I remember being present in a furious battle and it went dark without preamble, and then…"
"You got some nerve showing up in my dead kid's meat suit."
“And where do you think you belong?” Zachariah asks, “It’s pathetic of you to be this delusional, Castiel. You think those humans care for you? You think you have a place there?”
Cas looks up at him, a flash of something indecipherable flicker across his eyes.
When his eyes wander up from it's unannounced detour to Cas' lips, he finds his friend’s eyes glued to his own lips.
"Woah, stop straining yourself," Dean reaches out and guides him to sit on the couch. Castiel leans into him, though only minutely, the creases on his forehead slowly smoothing out. "You sit tight and I'll get you the soup, I still gotta make dinner though, spaghetti sounds good?"
"I thought it would be easier than this, to pretend the feelings away," Cas grouses. "I never anticipated my control to slip away like this."
"Nah, man. I'm good." Dean lies through his teeth. He's ridiculously hard but he's not doing this for himself. "We only have a few hours before we have to hit the road."
"Aw," Sam crooned, ducking out of the door before Dean could throw the first thing he could reach at his brother. He poked his head in again, "Oh, Dean. Heads up."
He felt fingers touching his palm, gentle and tentative, “Dean, you’re alright. Everyone is alright. Please look at me.”
"You're insufferable," Cas shook his head and went back to drowning his pancakes in diabetes inducing levels of syrup.
something.
"Why would he not be proud of you? " Cas asks, confusion spreading across his features. "As your parent it was his duty to give you a home. If he made you feel like you owed him for your existence, then the wrong is on his part. You're an incredible man, Dean. There is so much about you that deserves praise. "
"It's okay, Cas," Dean says softly. "It's okay to feel, there's no one here to tell you what to do or feel. I never realized how easy I had it. I was always a coward, too scared to act on the things I wished for. You're not anything like that."
“Good, your ears are still working,” Joseph quips. “Just thought I’d let you know ’cause that sounds like your wheelhouse.”
Sam barely spared them a glance before moving to his own bed, mumbling a
A HUGE HUGE thank you to everyone who stuck through the ride and left kudos and comments. I'm so thankful for y'all. I hope you all enjoyed this! Let me know your feedback in the comments!
“Fine,” Dean said. “Send us the details.”
Castiel still doesn’t have a clue regarding the matter of ducks, but he says, “As long as you promise to be careful, you can punch a few angels.”
“Call 911,” Cas tells Jaime.
"Cas," Dean grunts, ducking his head. "So, wings huh?"
Sam frowns, "Sorry, what did you just say?"
"Can you switch seats with me?
They cleared their plates and Dean grabbed his jacket, throwing it over his shoulder. The weather was still a bit misty from the June rain.
“Son of a bitch!” Dean exclaims, a little shaken. “Who the fuck are you?”
"I don't have many clothes."
He will have to trust Cas here, because Cas knows better. He always does. Dean’s even more sure of it when Cas pulls him closer, guiding Dean’s head to his shoulder, because Dean needs this.
"Eileen's in the hospital...it's probably nothing but I can't help but worry," he mumbles, turning to rest his head on Cas' shoulder. Strong arms wrap around his middle, holding him closer against the sturdy warmth of Castiel's chest. "Sammy might be losing his mind, can't blame him."
Ivan springs off the couch with a grin, only to pause at the doorway to his room, “No cut off since we are celebrating,” he raises his brows.
He fights and kills and protects, everything he was meant to do, yet he doesn't feel like himself. He, for the lack of a better term, feels too
"Uh, yeah," he stutters, bending down to hit the pause button. Cas stares at him, head cocked to that perfect angle that says he's yet again confused by Dean's actions. He sits down next to Cas, taking his hand in his.
"I'm fine, Dean," Cas sighs. "A little tired perhaps."
Ruby sighs, “It’s a deal.” Castiel opens his mouth but she waves her hand dismissively. “Yeah yeah, I know. I break the deal and you hunt me down yada yada yada.”
If Dean hadn't stopped himself from slamming the brake at the last minute, they would have crashed into a lamp post for sure.
, not some Joe with a broken rib that you tried to heal. Of course I get a fucking say in this!”
Sam exhales deeply, "You're gonna be okay, just get back home earlier. We'll spend Christmas together, that should cheer you up."
Something flickers behind Dean’s eyes, something conflicting and profound. A slides hand around the back of Castiel’s neck, pulling him forward.
“Oh my god, who’s she?”
Castiel clears his throat, "The previous attack must have been Zachariah's way of telling he had the upper hand, considering how he has Sam Winchester hostage."
Dean notices the small smile on Sam’s face, probably from Cas’s newfound technical abilities. Dean chuckles softly, shaking his head, because his two favorite people in the whole goddamn world are both fucking nerds.
Castiel swallows, swirling his glass, watching the amber liquid in it move in slow circles, "Jaime, I'm so sorry…"
"Was hard on me too, and I was just a squirt back then," he grumbles, something about Cas making him want to bare his soul to the man. "Had to look after Sammy when I was just four while John spent time with his old friend Johnnie. Dammit, that just makes me sound like a shit brother."
“Do you have any children?”
paying attention,” Dean grumbled. “She was trying to flirt with you, not stare.”
“It’s alright, Cas. You don’t have to explain anything to me,” Justin smiles, reaching out to pat Castiel’s shoulder. “Get yourself something nice with that money you skimmed off my friend.”
"Where are we going?" Cas asks as they climb down the hill.
"Yes, I do."
Dean doesn't say anything in reply, just gets up and heads to the bathroom to freshen up. He picks up his phone, a part of his nighttime routine to check for any messages from Sam, Eileen or Jo. He unlocks the phone and sure enough, a couple messages from Sam are waiting.
"Cas, for the last time," he drew in a breath, trying to keep his voice calm, "you and I are gonna stick together and keep an eye on Louisa. Sam and Nadia will take care of the rest. Understood?"
“I mean, you would know if someone infiltrated, right?”
But his thoughts packed up and left as soon as he spotted Cas coming out of the hall, his hands stuffed into his pant pockets. Dean took his time to eye him up and down, appreciating the view that was his boyfriend.
"Who do you want, Cas?"
“That’s right, you’re stuck, Novak.”
“The hell if I know,” Ruby shrugs, and adds “Any news on Sam?”
“Mr. Novak?” Dean inquired, looking over at Michael.
Bliss is the only emotion he knows and feels in that moment. The soul in his arms is unlike anything he has ever felt. It is warm and full of heat yet cold and solid. Castiel’s wings soar high on its own accord, finding the need to separate the soul from everything it stands against. He wonders how none of his brothers and sisters were fortunate enough to experience this bliss. Perhaps he spoke too soon because stronger attacks are aimed his way, trying to pry away the soul from him. Castiel fights, he does not let go. It is not an option, the soul is threading itself into Castiel like vines creeping up a window sill, hold fierce and binding, providing him with the nerve to fight his way up. Castiel cannot let go, he does not want to.
"So get this, Bobby," Sam doesn't bother placing both his feet into the house before starting the briefing, "There's gonna be a storm th-" Sam stops dead in his tracks, mouth agape as he stares at Dean.
“Be careful. Both of you,” Cas mumbled before pushing past Dean.
"I'm sorry," Cas murmurs. "How old were you when she…"
******
“Just go inside, Dean.” Castiel pushed him further in, “No need to catch an unnecessary cold.”
"Dean!" Castiel found his own voice calling out, mimicking the way his grace struggled to reach out to the hunter.
"Unlike me."
“You can call me for anything, not just cases,” Cas says, balancing his phone between his ear and his shoulder as he pours himself coffee. “How are you? How is everyone at the shelter?”
"Nah, Cas." Dean chokes out, drawing a deep breath and slapping on his best grin before turning around. "You gonna eat that burger or what?"
did not discuss anything,” Cas snaps. “You decided our background would be that we met during a wrestling tournament. Which, by the way, is outlandish.”
Dean cleared his throat, "Hit me with 'em suitcases."
"What?" Dean cocked a brow.
He doesn't know who pulls away first but he knows neither of them wants it.
Dean nods, “Yeah,” but he doesn’t move.
Castiel notices the way Dean hovers around him all throughout the morning as they prepare to go on the mission to rescue Sam. He prides himself for being able to understand human behaviors—or, at least Dean's—more accurately than before, as now he knows Dean's way of caring for the people he loves is keeping an eye on them at all times or making jokes as a way to cheer them up.
Dean sighed, "Mind if we poke around a bit?"
“Kiss ass,” Dean chuckles, his heart feeling like it’s got its sunny side up.
“Cas,” Dean breathed out, overwhelmed by it all.
"She knows better than to cause trouble right now," Sam shrugged. "We'll wait until she slips up."
