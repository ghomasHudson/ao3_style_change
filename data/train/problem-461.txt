I sat up in my chair, blinking several times to wake myself up. I looked at him and he immediately looked away in the window again.
‘Are you free today?’
“God, please, not again…” was the only thought that kept pumping in my head, “Don’t take him away from me again,”
I swallowed, feeling my whole world crumbling around me.
‘Charity? No, not really our thing. Give him our sincere apologies,’ Sherlock replied immediately. He approached me, putting his hand on my shoulder, ‘We are incredibly busy,’
‘Are you afraid of me?’
We approached the man by the doors. When he was done with the previous guests, he turned to us, a forced smile appearing on his face.
‘I should’ve stayed with you even though you acted like a total jerk,’ I said, my body starting to shake.
When I said I would never regret what happened, I didn’t lie. I’d never do it: I dreamt about it for years. But now when the endorphin levels in my blood lowered, I found myself completely not ready for whatever Sherlock was going to tell me.
I know it’s not easy to move on from my own experience, but seeing her constantly trying to flirt with him even if he didn’t respond was the last thing I wanted to see.
‘Well, you are. It’s our prime minister,’ I shook my head, sighing. Sherlock arched his eyebrows, ‘You said he looks like the orange American guy and turned off the TV, remember?’
‘Believe me, it is,’
‘We had so many and still, you can’t recognize them,’ Sherlock smiled fondly and turned back to our nearly burnt by now breakfast, ‘Do you think order-in works at 8 am?’
‘Don’t worry. Sherlock is taking care of that,’ I smiled wryly.
Sherlock nodded.
For a second I thought I broke him like a Waldo, but then he turned off the stove and fully turned to me, grabbing both of my hands in his. I stood there, frozen, while Sherlock bent to leave a light kiss on them and looked up at me. My eyebrows went up in surprise and all I could think of is how not to black out right here and right now.
‘A little,’ I felt my cheeks burning. I licked my lips, approaching him. I still felt like everything that happened last night was a dream and had no idea how to act around him. I leaned on the countertop with one hand, watching him flip the bread on the pan, ‘How is your stomach?
He wasn’t like that in the beginning.
‘What the hell are you doing?’ I whispered through clenched teeth as we walked in the grand foyer. Sherlock took his coat off me with unusual gallantry and negligently threw it in the direction of the house worker, who tried his best to catch it.
‘You’ll so regret it,’ Sherlock stopped, looking at me searchingly, ‘Honey,’
He started smoking during solving complicated cases since he came back. And for some reason, I didn’t mind.
I couldn’t help it, but laugh quietly. Sherlock smiled back, but sighed in pain a moment after.
‘Doctor Watson,’ I looked up to see Mycroft now emerging from the doors. His face was as pale as the walls and you could almost see just the faintest look of sorrow on it. He always had this expression though, ‘I am very glad you were… Able to come,’
‘The dresser…’
‘I hope it is in plain sight,’
I barely opened my eyes, shutting them back at once. The sunlight had already brightened the whole room and I desperately tried to hide my face from it in the pillow. When my attempts fully failed, I forced myself to sit up in the bed, rubbing my eyes.
I came to the house of the victim, questioned his wife, who seemed quite relieved with her husband’s disappearing, looked around his office in the house they’d been ranting, but couldn’t find anything to help the case. Greg never asked me this kind of favour again and we ended up just occasionally meeting for a beer.
‘And you did,’ he replied sharply. I could see that he was getting annoyed. He always did when we were fighting. Like I was boring him with my stupid social standards of friendship, ‘What is the problem then?’
‘You cock!’ I yelled when the car disappeared around the corner.
‘I am so sorry…’ I took a deep breath, moving away tangled curls from his forehead. I tried to ignore enormous wound underneath them; even though it was washed, it still gave me chills when I looked at it, ‘I should’ve… I should’ve stayed with you,’
‘Easy as pie,’ Sherlock replied, ‘We just need to get past dozens of security guards in a mansion stuffed with individuals, who are all, one way or another, involved in the unstable situation in our country or the whole world,’
‘You could’ve talked to me!’ I cried, shaking my head in outrage, ‘You could’ve told me about everything and we would sort it out together!’
It didn’t feel like a thousand butterflies inside. Instead, I felt incredible… relief. Like I’ve been holding my breath for years and finally, I was able to breathe out. Like I’ve finally been set free.
The music stopped abruptly and I felt my heart go right through my feet. A whisper has flied through the hall and the guests started exchanging quite suspicious looks.
"I am flattered by your interest, but I consider myself married to my work,"
‘Dance classes. For five years,’
‘Which is never,’
The door flew open and we entered a spacious ballroom. Women in elegant dresses, one more pretentious than other, were chattering with their companions, while servants were offering endless glasses of champagne. Small orchestra in the corner of the room was playing some unobtrusive classical music. It was mad, it was like in a film or on the telly and I was seriously fighting the urge to ask Sherlock to pinch me.
‘Jane Underwood. Thirty-eight years old, married, two kids,’ Greg said in an almost casual tone as Sherlock and I followed him up the stairs.
‘This is a remarkable case, Lestrade. Thank you,’ his hand dived into the pocket of his coat and pulled out a small set of instruments, ‘Let’s start then,’
So yep, go ahead and leave your feedback.
I probably looked like I just saw a ghost because Molly looked completely terrified. It took Greg several tries to wake her up from her trance and make her bring the form.
One down.
Look who's back again :) It's been... three months? I must confess, I didn't feel like writing for a long time, but several days ago I just opened this fic and read it from the start again. And fortunately or unfortunately (decide for yourself hehe)  I decided to continue. So here is a pretty big chapter, which I really enjoyed writing so I hope you'll like it too.
‘Ghm,’ I cleared my throat, wrapping the coat around myself better, but noticed the red stitches around the buttonhole. I frowned, puzzled, ‘Sherlock, that’s not my coat,’
Instantly his hand grabbed my arm and squeezed it so hard I almost let out a moan. Sherlock’s eyes were burning me with a look full of anger and some strange desire. I bit my lip, my eyes going up and down from his eyes to his lips.
The flames in the ancient fireplace that fronted the foot of the bed cast faint shadows on the rest of the furniture. Mycroft couldn’t stop watching them: they had an entirely aesthetic purpose, the room was too big for them to affect its temperature.
Even if I wanted, I never could.
Long, sharply-chiselled face, a goatee and high forehead made a very disagreeable impression. You could see that Mr Magnussen was used to getting anything he wanted at once. And was clearly unfamiliar with refusal. He looked like a typical businessman, but something about him made you feel vulnerable and miserable.
“You are unbearable.”
There is a line and he crossed it.
‘Please…’ I leaned closer to hear his whispering, ‘M-Moran…’
He was unconscious. A smile was stamped upon his lips.
But when he appeared, his eyes so distant, his face covered with scars of unknown origin and his mind being completely in another place, I just couldn’t. I couldn’t make myself to say even a word. I just let out some strange sound of surprise and a complete mess of feelings as I threw myself forward pulling him as close as I could.
‘Because that’s where my lies started. And that’s where they are going to end,’
I sighed and laid my hand on his arm. Sherlock looked up at me and for a moment we just kept still, both thinking about something.
‘Why would we be interested?’
And he kissed me. Sherlock Holmes kissed me. I needed a moment for it to settle in my mind.
Hey, guys! The new chapter is up and believe me, some crazy stuff begins after it hehe :D
The blood in my ears kept pumping as I stood up and rushed up the stairs to my bedroom. I shut the door behind myself, pressing my back to it. I closed my eyes.
‘Well, hello, gentlemen,’
I heard the car door behind me open and then close. I turned around, but it already disappeared in the darkness of the night.
A hero is someone, who people believe in.
One by one we slipped under the yellow line we learned to ignore over the years as we approached the last floor.
Whoever that Sebastian was, I was more than sure I’d snap his neck at once if I stumbled upon him now.
My mouth slowly opened in shock as I remembered that evening.
‘It would be very helpful if you were just so observant at work,’ Sherlock chuckled and I shook my head disapprovingly, trying to hold back my own smile.
‘Moran,’ his face grew suddenly grave, ‘He is here,’
My eyes slid down to the end of the sheet, where dark-brown curls were visible. Suddenly it was as if I had received an electric shock. I started back, bumping into Greg, who gave me a concerned look. He must have asked me something, but I couldn’t hear him. All I could think of were the curls under the white fabric.
‘I’m here,’
‘It’s not human to do this,’ Greg said, pointing at the neck, ‘It’s monstrous,’
Greg smiled slightly, putting his hand on my shoulder. I couldn’t even look at him. I didn’t want to see his eyes filled with unfailing condolence. I hated this. Everybody was giving me that look, but I never knew what they expected me to act to it like.
I slowly approached it as if it could open up and something would jump out of it. I held my breath as the smell grew stronger with each step. I leaned down and grabbed the zipper, pulling sharply.
He started to go missing for days. His bedroom door was always shut. I had to start working at the hospital again so I wouldn’t lose my mind in the infinite silence of our flat.
‘John, I - ’
‘Am I supposed to know him?’
I didn’t hear a single word behind.
And when my head almost slipped down my hand and my mind was ready to shut down, I heard his quiet husky voice.
The silence at once became intolerably oppressive. My eyes went to the massive frames of guards, who appeared in the doorway. I could feel the outline of the gun pressed to my back under the jacket. If a brawl starts, there’s a chance I manage to take it out and...
A light nod and the orchestra played again. Rhythmic melody gradually made everyone pair up and glide over the parquet floor. We had to step back to the wall not to get knocked down by an extremely encouraged couple.
I turned around, barely being able to see Sherlock’s body and clenched my fists. On an impulse I hit the metal wall and bit the lower lip, trying to ignore the dull ache in the knuckles. I looked down at Sherlock and suddenly I felt annoyed as if he was ignoring me and my feelings just like he did when he was…
Suddenly, I felt cold fingers touching my palm and then clasped it, lightly squeezing. I closed my eyes, feeling a strange mix of relief and tension at the same time.
I pulled myself up, standing up and helping him to lie down. Sherlock groaned quietly, but didn’t say a word when I tore apart his shirt to see a round lacerated wound surrounded by a growing bloodstain. It looked like the one who did it twisted the knife inside of his body. I pressed my lips together, pressing my hand to the wound.
I felt like I was about to fall. The only thing that was still holding me up was Sherlock’s hand squeezing my arm. His uneven breath on my lips and his eyes piercing made me forget about everything. Everything he had done. At that exact moment, I was ready to turn blind eye to it and be with him whatever it took.
I chuckled and turned around, looking out of the corner and outstretching a hand with the gun.
Speaking of that ghost.
‘It’s too quiet. Even the crime page is almost fully empty,’ I pointed at the small box in the corner, ‘The only distress that happened is a missing dog,’
‘Dear guests,’ his deep voice echoed across the chamber, ‘I am glad that all of you could make it today. For such a good cause…’
‘Sebastian Moran. His errand boy. He used to be…’
‘It was you, wasn’t it?’ I swallowed, making myself continue, ‘The body in the abandoned house. Was it your doing?’
‘Not bad,’ Sherlock whispered and I chuckled, unconvinced, ‘Well, not as bad as I thought. Don’t compare yourself to me: I took dance classes,’
‘I… I am just scared of what’s he going to ask for,’ I said so quietly as if someone else apart from him could hear me, ‘I haven’t willingly killed a man since Afghanistan. Not sure if I can do it now and…’
‘For God’s sake, Sherlock…’ I sighed while continuing to hypnotize my breakfast victim sandwich. I would never expect myself to get so excited and happy about somebody’s beheaded body, ‘A person was murdered,’
‘Indeed, dear,’ a big plate with a perfectly fried toast, egg and beans landed on the table right in front of me, ‘Here you go,’
‘Oh, sorry,’ he came closer to me, taking both of my hands and stroking my knuckles with his thumb, ‘I know this place is not really your favourite. But I wanted to tell you what happened here, where it all began. Just the two of us,’
‘Hi, Molly,’
Maybe I should just stay in the dark and enjoy what we have. Pretend that I didn’t see him dissolving arms of the main suspect in a murder in aggressive acids in our kitchen right after the breakfast. Keep ignoring Lestrade’s calls. I have nothing to tell him anyway, I don’t know anything.
I walked out of the hospital when it was somewhere after half-past eight. The streets were wet cause of recent rain that was still falling about half an hour ago. Sidewalks were shining in the soft light of the street lights that just turned on. I turned up the collar of my coat, trying to shut out the cold humid wind coming right to my face, and hid my hands in the pockets.
‘John…’ he murmured, his hand clenched on my wrist. I sat on the side, gently moving wet curls from his face.
‘I already have one,’ he gave me a barely noticeable smirk and leaned back to the body. I shook my head when Greg laughed shortly.
Sherlock quickly shifted backwards, his hand slipping down my chest. He awkwardly pressed his lips together and I finally noticed about six people, who just walked out of the crime scene, looking at us like they just saw something paranormal. Well, seeing Sherlock looking uncomfortable must be such a thing after all.
I turned around to see Greg’s face in the window before it disappeared. He probably thought I was beating up the corpse here or something.
‘Mycroft Holmes,’ he said, raising his chin in the coldest manner possible. For a moment, I could see the resemblance, but it was gone at once.
I couldn’t hear him anymore.
I turned my head to look at Greg, who was now fixing the wiretap on the inner side of Sherlock’s jacket. Its owner, by the way, was as taciturn and focused as always. His eyes were closed, but eyeballs rapidly moved under the eyelids which likely indicated that he was calculating all possible outcomes of tonight. How thoughtful of him.
“It’s a good deduction, yeah,”
Sherlock reached out his hand, his gaze sought my eyes insistently. Several seconds I just stood there, staring at him in bewilderment. Once it struck me, I started frantically shaking my head.
‘Focus on the task, will you?’ Sherlock said, almost sarcastically, ‘Aren’t you my spouse?’ He faltered and grabbed my glass, taking a pretty big sip and grimacing immediately. After that he got rid of it, putting it on a tray of the passing-by servant.
Sherlock had been circling around the body for about a minute now. Finally, he understood there was no other way than to stand directly in the bloodstains with his knees and that action was accompanied by Sally Donovan’s irritated sigh.
I rushed to the dresser, following his directions, and got out a dark box with a red cross on its cover. I got back to the bed, opening it up on the way, and put it down on the covers. I took out the antiseptic and a spool of surgical thread and let myself stop just for a second to look at Sherlock again.
I sighed, accepting my fate and pushed the door open as quietly as I could.
‘Hungry?’
‘Of course,’ he replied, ‘Now go kill someone or whatever you do in your spare time. I need to think,’
‘Mrs. Hudson…’
Sherlock’s smile disappeared and his face assumed a strangely cold expression that made me freeze for a moment. Just for a second. And then it was gone.
All the love XOX
‘Of course. I’d be lost without my blogger,’
Mycroft gave him a mock sigh, poorly concealing the smile, and pressed himself to Greg’s back, covering both of them with a silk sheet. His nose touched the warm skin and he unwittingly breathed in the dizzying scent. His own kind of drug.
He rolled his eyes.
As a rule, Sherlock would get very offended by such closure. But this time he seemed absolutely unbothered by that and the only reaction I got from him was:
“You had a different point of view tonight.
His eyes were fixed on the fireplace with some strange look of detachment. It was like he was back there, in that room. I couldn’t look away from his face lightened up by the flames.
Present day…
‘Is it a date?’
‘Wow,’ Greg murmured.
The lights were out, but the room was lightened up by the lights of the night London: the walls were fully made of glass and there was only one heavy scarlet curtain that was usually unfolded during the day or important meetings.
‘I am sorry,’
‘Is it bad?’ Sherlock said, folding the paper back and putting it away, tilting his head, ‘I thought you weren’t very fond of anarchy and chaos,’
Sherlock turned around, smiling widely.
Mycroft’s phone was blowing up in his pocket again and now was impossible to ignore. He answered and his voice lowered to inaudible for human ear again. Lestrade bent over to tell something to the driver.
A smile gradually grew on my face.
Sherlock seemed to be sleeping peacefully for several hours now. I touched his forehead to check the temperature once again and took a look under the sheet to see if the bandage was clean.
I leaned closer, just a few inches before Sherlock’s face.
The place next to me was empty. Instead, there was a spare set of Sherlock’s home clothes at my feet. Initially, I looked around for my underwear, but gave up and got up, putting on a dark blue t-shirt that I was almost drowning in and a pair of loose striped pants just like that. My eyes met their reflection in the mirror in front of me. I bet Sherlock found the biggest clothes he had for me.
Now when the adrenaline stopped pumping, the terrible smell of rotting stung my nostrils. I suppressed the urge to vomit and looked around to find the source of the smell. My gaze fell on the black bag under the window. I completely forgot about it.
I closed my face with hands, leaning on my table and taking a deep breath.
‘Where were you all this time?’ I asked while removing his coat, ‘Why didn’t you call me if you needed help, you idiot…’
Moran knew no names and there was no point in learning them: every two-three weeks they died getting their work done or were killed for not doing it. Simple, but effective motivation.
‘Not a chance…’ he replied absently.
I pressed my lips together, my whole body shaking in response to his words. It wasn’t true. Or was it? The thoughts in my head were rushing from side to side and I couldn’t concentrate on anything, but his eyes.
I turned slowly on my heels, marching down the road.
‘It’s okay,’ the corners of his lips twitched up, his hand stroke my cheek, reassuring, ‘You know I’m extremely enduring,’
‘What is wrong with you?’
I pressed my lips together, pulling myself together. I looked up at the ancient arch absorbing the night sky above me while pushing the door open and going in.
I feel like I’ve been completely useless today. Sarah didn’t say anything to me, but the way she looked at me was very, very expressive. I couldn’t concentrate at all and kept thinking about Sherlock the whole day even though I went to work to get distracted from him in the first place.
A man walked out from the shadows and we saw a tall blond man with his arms wrapped on his chest, smirking.
Sound of someone’s footsteps interrupted my deliberations. One by one all of the heads looked up at the balcony. The people, who stood there before, parted hastily before the tall man, whose dead eyes looked at the sluggish with reproof.
‘I am done now,’ Sherlock jumped up, blood running down his ankles, and turned to me, ‘You want to take a look?’
Mycroft gave me a tight smile.
‘What?’ I sat up, looking at him confused. Sherlock swallowed hard and I hurried to wipe his forehead from tiny sweat drops going down his face.
‘When I was there, tied up in a damp underground chamber in Serbia, looking at the floor painted with my own blood, all I could think of was this place,’ Sherlock put the violin down on the table and turned around, not looking at me even for a moment.
‘What are you talking about?’
‘Just once, can you two behave like grown-ups?’ Mycroft’s ice tone hit me in the ear through the headset.
Moran slowly moved towards one of the sides of the roof and casually looked down as if he forgot about us for a moment. His movements were sharp, but completely silent: typical walk of a military man. You didn’t have to be good at deductions to see that his whole face was covered in scars of different depth and size. Also, his leg must have suffered a serious injury in some sort of battle and hadn’t completely healed, making him walk with a slight limp. But he still looked like he could kill anyone without even blinking.
Behind the translucent curtains, the numerous silhouettes of guests were moving around, indicating that the party must have been in its full swing. Even so, the driveway was full of continually arriving fancy cars and their owners hurrying to the main entrance.
He was so close now that his hands, holding me tight, were the only thing that kept me from falling. I couldn’t remember what were we even doing this for. All that mattered was his other hand on my waist slowly pulling me closer to him. It was a sort of tremor, a boiling of the blood, against which no effort of the will availed anything.
Hey, honey bees!
All the love XOX
‘John,’ Sherlock said and I stopped, gazing back with my best pleading eyes. His hand got closer, ‘Just follow my lead,’
The tear fell on his pale skin and slid down the cheekbone.
“You are disappointed in me,”
Greg opened the door and walked in, leaving it open for us. I already headed in the direction of the growing awful smell, mentally preparing myself for the worst picture, when a sharp movement of Sherlock’s hand on my chest pushed me back and pressed my back against the wall. Before I could resent or get surprised a large chunk of old plaster from the ceiling fell down on the spot where I had been standing a few seconds ago.
‘Everything is fairly obvious, Lestrade. I have no idea why would you ask us for help,’ Sherlock said bored, ‘Even you could’ve come to a decent conclusion,’
Greetings to you, my fellow johnlockians, who came here to read some fantasy of mine :D This chapter isn't that long, but it's one of my favourites for now because of the warmth it has (let's hope I won't decide to ruin everything at once hehe).
‘Y-you want me to come?’ I knew I sounded desperate and I didn’t care about it. For once in my life, I was not afraid of what he would think of me.
‘You have no idea how much the pile of unsolved cases on my desk grew over these two years,’ he said a little disappointed, ‘I’ve never thought I would need you two so much,’
He widened his eyes, astonished.
I gave a deep groan, looking at his emotionless face.
‘The only reason?’ Moran asked, lifting his eyebrow. Jim laughed, turning back to the window again.
My eyes were slowly closing, but Sherlock started getting a fever and I kept running back and forth, changing wet towels on his forehead.
I put an ear to the door, waiting for any other sign of somebody’s presence. It’s been several seconds of silence when I heard the bed creaking as someone landed on it with another moan.
‘No, John, let me finish… I - ’
‘We can’t just keep standing. Magnussen isn’t blind,’
Not waiting for the answer, its owner sat up and put his head on Mycroft’s shoulder. Surprised by himself, Mycroft wrapped his arm around his shoulders, pulling him closer. Only his proximity was pleasant for him for some reason.
At last, he got closer and I closed my eyes.
I heard the doors closing quietly behind my back.
‘I swear, I’m coming up and you’ll have it all!’
‘Yes?’
I sighed and turned around with a rehearsed smile.
I looked up to see if anyone was watching: Molly and Greg were quietly talking beside the opposite wall while Mycroft was looking at them with much curiosity, but was probably too proud to join them.
But before I could open my mouth, Sherlock just walked out to the kitchen and a moment later I heard the door of his bedroom shutting.
The fire reminded him of people’s feelings – unpredictable, chaotic and dangerous. It is the greatest weapon human beings ever created. Not even an atomic bomb can give that much damage to one’s life as an irregular heartbeat when he’s looking at somebody he cares about.
‘It was hard to stop,’ I whispered, still out of my breath.
‘Sherlock, please… I am begging you,’ my own voice sounded alien to me, ‘Stop this. Stop this now because I’m…’ I pressed my lips together, shaking my head, ‘I can’t do this. I just can’t,’
Did we just get ourselves exposed?
I looked back at Sherlock. What did I have to lose?
I only opened my mouth and she was already in, interrupting me.
But it would never happen. Because I am me, and he is him. And it will never change. Our obsession with danger brought us where we are now and my fantasies are most certainly going to stay fantasies.
I couldn’t stay there any longer.
Sherlock opened his mouth to say something, but from the expression on his face, I knew he would say something scathing and get us both killed in no time. I squeezed his hand to stop him and swallowed, already regretting about what I was about to say.
‘John?’
‘That’s true,’ she said and I could barely contain myself by now. “Like she had any clue…”, ‘Bye!’
‘You are still not talking, are you?’ she asked carefully, tilting her head.
‘He said that he wouldn’t be able to do it without me,’
Greg called me the other day saying that they officially close the case for now as a result of lack of any proof if the main suspect was guilty or not.
‘Everything will be okay,’ Sherlock lifted his hand and placed it on my cheek, making my skin crawl. I leaned forward without realizing it, ‘As long as you are on my side…’
Everything went spinning before my eyes and I tried to attack back, but was rewarded by several more punches in the chest and ribs. I groaned in acute pain, not able to strike back: it was so dark I could barely see the silhouette of the attacker.
I wanted to lose myself in him completely. I wanted to forget about the halfway through mission and just stay here and now forever: Sherlock’s hands gripping my hips and pressing his against mine, the taste of blood that we now shared and my fingers pulling his hair, making him let out stifled moans.
‘And this is…?’
‘Do you really want to discuss it now?’ He moaned as I pulled the sleeve of the coat too fast. I froze.
‘Are you okay?’ Sherlock asked so quietly that I doubted if I really heard it.
Only one person in the world can make that sound. I turned my head to the right as I felt a warm small hand on my shoulder and smiled.
‘What the hell are you doing?’ he whispered, his eyes widened, ‘It’s madness,’
‘It’s none of my business,’ Sebastian gave us a dreary sigh, ‘I am just following boss’ orders. And I am not leaving without getting what he wants,’
‘Don’t,’ he grinned, ‘You are right.’
‘I never miss anything,’ his eyes flashed, but he immediately suppressed his emotions, straitening up, ‘I am glad that you’ve been of use for once,’
‘What do you want?’ Sherlock said through his teeth.
‘Understood,’ I replied, trying to gently wipe off the blood smeared all over his lips with my thumb. It was hopeless.
I started at a sudden touch of a cold hand on my cheek. I looked up to see Sherlock looking at me with such softness in his eyes as if he wasn’t dying in my arms right now. And for a second I forgot about everything. My heartbeat slowed down and the only thing I could see now was his eyes light up in the dark.
‘I will. When the time comes. And when Sherlock allows me to,’
‘It’s insignificant, Gregory,’ we heard some fuss, in the result of which Mycroft took over the mic, ‘Do you see Magnussen?’
He didn’t reply. My heart skipped a bit and my hand reached to his neck to check the pulse. I sighed in relief.
‘Sherl...’ I couldn’t finish the sentence. My legs went weak and he barely managed to catch me before I hit the floor.
I shook my head, throwing the coat on the floor. I returned to the knee position, my eyes stopped near the first button of his shirt. My eyes got all blurry from the wetness and I felt that I could break down any second now.
- SH.”
‘So all we have to do is to sneak into Magnussen’s office without getting caught?’ I asked. It took Sherlock a great effort to take his eyes off his rival. He tilted his head to give me a meaningful look, reminding me of our agreement. Like I could forget.
‘Don’t,’ I muttered through clenched teeth and put a finger on the trigger. God, I felt this bolt of electricity coursed through me when he slowly smiled. It was that kind of smile you give to a silly child who is acting out when he is told to go to bed.
I could swear I felt Sherlock’s fingers tightening on mine.
‘I know. And you deserve to know…’ he let go and turned from me with his back, ‘But you will regret tonight if I tell you,’
‘Sherlock,’ I said, my voice stone cold. Sherlock seemed to fall into true despair.
‘I won’t,’
‘Sherlock, no,’ I said.
‘Several weeks before I got a message from Moriarty,’ my muscles tightened. Only the mention of this name made me fill in with rage every time. It meant there was nothing good to expect, ‘He said that he planned something massive towards the whole England and not even Mycroft would be able to stop him. And he needed my help…’
I tried imagining just the two of us having a date. We would go to one of the countless tiny restaurants, the owners of which owed Sherlock after some shady cases, or get order-in. I’d make him watch the whole Harry Potter series or CSI just to watch him criticizing every single bit of it. Then we’d probably end up laying on the couch and debating about something till we fall asleep. And in the morning, we would wake up with terrible neck pain, Sherlock would drone about it the whole day long and several days later ask me if I was free that evening again.
‘Do you always have to talk like you are quoting the Britannica?’ Sherlock sniffed venomously and sat back on the sit, narrowing his eyes, ‘Your megalomania is escalating,’
‘Sherlock…’ Greg started, but was interrupted right away.
We just reached the corner when we heard a loud stamping of feet and I turned around to see Sherlock reloading his gun and tilting his head questioningly.
‘I have morphine,’
“Who are you lying to, John?! You would never tell him. Because you are a freaking coward!”
‘Do you really have to do this, freak?’ she grimaced, leaning closer to get the attention of Sherlock, who calmly lifted up the victim’s sleeve to reveal enormous bruises all over her skin, ‘We have ten more people to work with the body after you and you better not mess up the crime scene,’
"I don’t have friends. I just have one…"
I moved back, my eyes meeting with his. I pressed my lips together, trying to hold back laughter, touched. He looked like a confused teenager, who let his guard down for the first time. He was one after all.
I opened my mouth to tell him what I thought about him acting like a complete moron, but before I could, a black shiny cab stopped a meter away from us and Sherlock quickly jumped in, not saying a word. The car sped away as quickly as it appeared.
I bit my lip, suppressing the laughter.
I gave him a deadly look, but when he held his elbow out for me, I took it.
I forced myself to reply to her with the faintest trace of a smile. It was enough.
For the first time in forever, I felt calm and happy. Sherlock was here. Yes, he was badly injured. Yes, he looked tired and broken. But he was here. He was here next to me and it was enough.
‘I have no choice,’ I replied and I could see it in his eyes that he knew it too. I pressed my lips together, frowning, ‘I can’t lose you again,’
The city kept living its nightlife behind our backs, not knowing that its end had just begun.
‘J-John…’ his voice quivered, making a shiver run through my body.
I swore under my breath, stroking his back. When he finished, I helped him to lie back and a moment later he blacked out.
I smiled, expecting Sherlock to be impressed. He chuckled coldly instead. The unreadable expression came over his face as he gave me a long stare and then turned to Lestrade.
‘Rabble?’ I chuckled, pointing at the blond man that held a woman that could be his daughter by the waist, standing before us in the queue to get in, ‘Isn’t that Boris Johnson?’
‘I don’t think he’d mind if Sally taught you a lesson for once,’
The dark-wooden table was fully covered by numerous opened folders. Most of them contained photos and all information about a significant person or organization. It’s funny how just one thin folder could destroy a life, if it got to wrong hands.
I took the final step and pushed the dark metal door open. The wind immediately hit me in the face and I hurried to close the door behind me.
‘But, Sherlock!’ I cried. Sherlock turned his head, raising eyebrows in surprise.
I closed my eyes, taking a deep breath and then exhaled, letting my head drop on my hands.
It was about nine in the evening. I sat in my chair and kept staring at the fire in the fireplace in front of me. My eyes were slowly closing and from time to time I could find myself being almost half asleep. Sherlock was standing near the window. I couldn’t see his face, but I could almost feel his tension.
‘Are you, guys, okay?’ I heard Lestrade’s voice muffled like I suddenly went underwater, ‘I forgot to tell you that here they have very weak…’
I shook my head, texting back.
I sent everything to hell and grabbed his face with my hands, pulling him as close as possible. Sherlock let out a little amazed moan and I swear to God his knees buckled a little when I used my tongue. Even though he would never admit it.
The door opened and a soft light brightened me and the pavement before it. I opened my eyes to see Sherlock’s astonished face.
‘Whatever happened to him, he deserved it,’
‘Charming,’ Moran smirked, turning around and moving towards the exit door. He stopped for a moment and looked back in our direction, ‘We will be in touch,’
Sherlock didn’t.
‘I-I know, but…’
It was so cold inside and the only smell felt in the air was the smell of medications. I slowly passed the wall covered in plenty of metal doors, behind every single one of which was a human life. One of the doors was open.
I smiled fondly, shaking my head. Sherlock sighed, taking his seat beside me and taking a bite of his toast.
- SH.”
‘What was that?’
‘You killed people, John,’ he was almost whispering now as if he was telling me a secret, ‘Many people. Don’t tell me you didn’t like it…’
‘Six ‘no’s?’ Sherlock asked mockingly, ‘Is dancing with me such a horrible prospect for you?’
The man looked down at his list, his finger going down the black lines. Finally, he found what he was looking for and made a little mark. He looked up, looking at me questioningly.
Sally snorted with laughter and folded her arms on the chest, looking questioningly at Greg, who sighed wearily like a single father of two always fighting kids.
‘Nice,’ I said, expressively pulling the door open a bit more, ‘Well, I better be off. You know he hates to wait,’
Boom.
‘Exactly. But I suppose that you two are able to take care of that, aren’t you?’
‘You won’t get away with this so easily, Sherlock,’ I held my breath and put my hand over his. I felt him slightly startling and I looked up to see him blinking at an inhuman speed, ‘I want to know the truth,’
The street was so empty and quiet that I started to doubt if it’s not some kind of a strange dream. But the pain was real. I knocked on the door, leaning against the doorpost. I closed my eyes, seeing spots.
Suddenly we heard the sound of the bedroom door opening. I could only catch a glimpse of the dark blue silk robe flying after its owner before it disappeared behind the closed bathroom door.
‘Stop it!’ Mycroft shushed and we scowled at each other like two kids, who got caught.
‘Because I’ve seen his eyes,’ Jim replied, turning to the window in his chair, and it took Sebastian all of his self-control not to roll his eyes, ‘He’s just like us,’
‘If I told you, you would try to stop me,’ Sherlock said sullenly, he glared, ‘I could not let you get into this,’
"…whatever remains,..."
I froze, not able to control myself anymore. Sherlock sighed deeply.
He quickly moved towards the tall white doors on the opposite side of the room, dragging me with him.
‘It’s never going to happen,’ Sherlock said, getting his attention while my hand slowly slipped into the inner pocket of my jacket. With a lifestyle like ours it was always handy to have a gun with yourself, ‘The deal was that John stays out of this,’
I knew it was ridiculous. I knew that it was too late, but I just couldn’t help it. I needed to know that I told him. Even if he couldn’t hear me.
‘Do you think I would be able to do something like that?’
My eyes were fixed on the barely visible contours of fields and lonely houses behind the window, while my mind was rushing back and forth. I was familiar with this feeling: tingling sensation throughout my whole body, slightly shaking right hand, the left one - completely still. I knew what I felt. Excitement. And I hated myself for it.
I was trying to get enough of that brief intimacy, knowing perfectly well that when he wakes up, he probably won’t remember anything at all. And I was okay with that. I accepted the fact that he would never love me back a long time ago. It was hopeless right from the start.
‘I placed the memory in my mind palace,’ Sherlock moved closer, burying his nose in my hair, ‘So it will stay there forever,’
I can’t tell for how much time we stood like that. I breathed in the scent of his skin. It was a mixture of his own and a coconut shower gel. This bastard used mine again. I chuckled, wrapping my arms around his shoulders. Sherlock responded with a light stroking down my back.
I couldn’t finish. Sherlock leaned closer, covering my hand with his and looking straight into my eyes, making me hold my breath unconsciously.
I hated the fact that Sally freaking Donovan was right. She was right all along. And I was just a fool, who was too blinded by his own loneliness and the promise of a thrilling adventure.
‘I know who you really are…’ I didn’t even notice how the gun slipped out of my hand and the sound of it falling down on the floor made me flinch, ‘It’s okay. I am here now,’
I used to be afraid of that word. I spent years running away from my own heart and suppressing my desires. I got trapped in a hopeless situation and I had no one to blame, but myself. I felt something, but denied it to the point when it was physically painful to be around him.
He lifted an eyebrow slightly. And something about this haughty glance made me tremble. It was so familiar that I might have frozen for several seconds and only roused myself when Mycroft cleared his throat loudly.
I bit my lower lip, looking down and after weighing the pros and cons for a moment, proceeded.
“You need to make up your mind, John Watson,”
‘Stop it,’
I am not even sure which way of losing him was worse: thinking he was dead for two years or him acting like I barely existed now.
‘Sherlock?’ I whispered, ‘What’s going on?’
‘Good morning,’
I lifted one eyebrow, being 100% sure he was just teasing me. But when he frowned puzzled, I sighed and took several steps closer. Fighting with myself, I kneeled and leaned closer to the place, where the neck was supposed to end and the head – to start. The place of the cut was so straight and even as if the woman’s head was chopped off by a machine for cutting cheese.
I could feel his warm breath on my neck. His curls were touching my cheek.
‘If you don’t mind helping me now…’ he said through gritted teeth.
My fingers slowly pulled the fabric down. His livid, motionless body looked so surreal like it could vanish into thin air any moment. He was so different from the Sherlock I knew: restless, irascible and truly magnificent to watch in action. I couldn’t believe this man, who looked like he was carved from the stone was my friend. My best friend.
‘I do,’ I opened my mouth and froze for a moment, not willing to sound stupid, but then continued, ‘But can you please not stand so close to…’
His only answer was silence. I chuckled at myself. I don’t know what I expected. But for some reason, I was disappointed.
‘No, but he doesn’t talk to me…’ I felt Mrs Hudson’s hand squeezing my shoulder and I looked up to see her smiling sympathetically.
I swallowed, trying to get rid of unpleasant associations.
Sebastian was quickly moving down the narrow corridor and passing countless metal doors on the sides. Near each one of them were standing guards like pieces of furniture, as useful, as impersonal and as silent.
A thundering crash echoed through the stairwell. The bustle of the policemen on the lower floors stopped and a dozen heads popped out from different levels.
‘You know he’ll never be a competition to you,’ he shrugged his shoulders, ‘But he’s important. Without him and Johnny, we won’t finish what we started all these years ago,’
I closed my eyes, frantically trying to calm my heart that was mad bumping into my chest down.
‘Getting into the character,’ Sherlock replied, shrugging his shoulders, ‘And stopping you from revealing your identity, Mrs Holmes,’
Someday I might just explode from everything I keep inside.
‘John!’ he cried, his eyes squeezing my arm, ‘John, calm down! What happened?’
‘You don’t understand,’ he said, taking a step back and pointing at the building across the street, ‘Right here was sitting an assassin who would’ve killed you without even blinking if I did anything out of plan! I had no time for talking!’
I slammed the door after me, taking a deep breath before starting to get up the narrow stairs.
I was beginning to feel uncomfortable in the suit that Mycroft kindly lent me for this evening. The dark blue fabric, fitted too close to my body, was making me feel exposed. I couldn’t get rid of the thoughts about how obvious I must look in my “disguise”. The last time I wore a tuxedo must have been my father’s funeral. Not the best memories for sure.
- SH.”
‘Moriarty said it was just the beginning and if I didn’t surrender, he would hurt you much more,’ I looked up, meeting his eyes filled with a strange mix of sadness and pity. I snorted.
The house wasn’t just abandoned: it was nearly falling apart. The heavy smell of already begun rotting process and the total air humidity made me close nose and mouth and stop myself from a natural reaction. This smell was too familiar from my Afghanistan past when I had to cut off my best friend’s leg that couldn’t be saved on my own under the unstopping shooting. Good ol’ days.
I bit my lip, thanking heavens he couldn’t see my face right now. I bet I was blushing like a schoolgirl.
‘Go to sleep, Gregory,’ he said, looking down at silver-haired head shining under the moonlight, ‘You’ll be babysitting my brother again tomorrow,’
‘Secret services, I know,’ I interrupted, lowering my head and running a hand over my face, ‘I read his file…’
It was enough to just hold his hand, his fingers twitching around mine, listening to him raving and calling my name so tenderly as he’d never do sanely.
Now when almost all of the people were engaged in circling around, Magnussen made his way down the stairs and began the conversation with an old gentleman, who stood nearby. Even so, his examining gaze kept scanning those present.
The first horseman of the apocalypse just arrived at my first call.
Maybe if I told him what I felt, we wouldn’t end up here. In complete anarchy, the cause of which was him.
Sherlock smirked at “investigation” and I am sure it took Donovan all of her strength not to snap at him. She marched out of the room, almost pushing me and Greg apart to make her way to the door.
‘Sorry,’
We both laughed and I felt better. My forehead laid on his shoulder and Sherlock pressed his cheek to mine. The melody slowed down and now we were just swaying to the rhythm of the orchestra. I closed my eyes and tried to forget that we were possibly in great danger, surrounded by a considerable number of strangers and a likely criminal mastermind.
‘Of course,’ surprisingly enough, my voice obeyed and he seemed to believe me.
My eyes went right into his.
Sherlock slightly frowned as his eyes quickly moved up and down my body, stopping on mine.
‘Don’t tell me I made it up for myself,’ I looked right into his eyes as if I was trying to read his mind. That would be a very useful skill at that moment, by the way, ‘What did I do wrong? I just tried to help,’
Since it's so complex it took me quite a long time to finish it, I'm sorry for the waiting (shorter than waiting for another season of Sherlock tho lmao).
Sherlock stared at me for a moment with an unreadable expression. His hand was still holding mine and I could feel his fingers tightening around my palm. I couldn’t understand what he was thinking about, but his eyes were filled with a strange inexpressible sadness like he knew something, but couldn’t say it out loud.
‘The cut. It’s too straight. He must have used some kind of thread…’
His eyes were wet. I couldn’t believe it. Maybe it was just the light from the fire, or maybe it was just my imagination, but Sherlock’s eyes were wet as he continued.
‘It’s not like I was against it,’ I sighed, looking around the room. I turned back to Sherlock, whose chest was heaving from uneven breathing, ‘Do you have any aid kit here? Mine is upstairs,’
‘T-That was my first kiss,’ Sherlock mumbled when we let go, our foreheads resting on each other. I couldn’t help, but smile to myself, ‘My first real one,’
‘I made a drugged coffee for you just once. Can you stop being so dramatic?’
I opened my eyes in amusement. It was the first time he said something personal to me, not something concerning getting the insides of our refrigerator.
‘Sherlock!’
‘I will do it,’ Sherlock turned around at me with a look like I was insane. Well, even if I was, he was the one to blame for that, ‘Whatever it is, I will do it,’
‘Or string,’ Sherlock’s face hardened. I swallowed hard and turned to the body, pointing at the place of the cut, ‘There are many tendons in this place, which means it must have taken him a lot of time and effort to succeed,’
‘But before we start the charity auction, it is time for our small tradition,’
All of a sudden Sherlock moved away and grabbed me by the shoulders, gazing into my eyes.
‘Oh really? Don’t you tell me you did it only cause you cared for me,’ I clenched my fists, almost spitting the words at him, ‘You wanted it. You were bored and ran off with someone, who would fulfil your desires. Someone who would entertain you the way you like,’
‘John?’ I felt a slight pat at my back, ‘John, you okay?’
I never felt this way before. Like all of my fantasies came to life, but I never thought it would happen this way.
‘She’s upstairs. I tried my best to keep the examiners out of there, but you don’t have any more than 10 minutes,’
I looked at the empty evening street, panting. He left me standing here in the middle of the road, like some kind of an idiot, my legs covered in blood, so easily. I asked myself again why the hell was I still helping this narcissistic, irritant Spock, who barely appreciated anything I did no matter how much I tried to understand him.
My eyes locked on a wide white door with two tiny windows in it. Morgue. I stopped unwillingly as I approached it. I felt a sudden cold shiver down my spine. The main lights inside were out, but I still could see somebody’s corpse underneath a white sheet.
My fingers wrapped around his. I squeezed his hand, my eyebrows meeting in the middle.
So I hope you'll enjoy it! Comment your thoughts, tell me what you think and feel free to contact me on ig to propose your ideas :)
‘Then just coffee,’
‘I am not talking about that, no,’ I said, biting my lower lip to stop myself from bursting out with laughter. Considering Sherlock’s pouting it wasn’t the best choice, ‘The coffee is marvellous, thank you,’
‘Just let him work, okay? Go check how the investigation downstairs is going,’
He reached the big blurred glass door and reached out to knock, but stopped. There was no need. The only reaction possible if now was the bad mood time was something heavy to be thrown at you once you enter. You could only hope it’s not the bad mood time.
I covered my face with my hands, growling in despair. It was all my fault and I had no one to blame for it.
I had not taken above a couple of steps before I heard a loud beep coming from my pocket. I took my phone out and its screen immediately got covered with tiny water drops.
‘We already are, Sarah,’ her face lightened with the most genuine smile and I couldn’t not respond to her with the same, ‘I’d love to meet for a coffee sometime. With pleasure,’
‘He almost beat you to a pulp! What choice did I have?’
Suddenly Sherlock bent over and pressed his lips firmly to mine. My head started spinning a little as I felt the metallic taste on my lips and tongue. I closed my eyes and kissed him as hard as I could, drowning my fingers in his hair.
At once, I was thankful that it was dark enough for Sherlock not to see that my skin colour turned five shades redder.
‘Jane Underwood is known for being arrogant and scandalous. She even has her own revealing secrets of celebrities show on her husband’s TV channel. She had many enemies. No wonder she ended up like this,’ I licked my lips, sitting up and looked up as Sherlock approached fully immersed in his deductions, ‘Her husband, Fred Underwood built his career in the same way: his previous wife was rumoured to be beaten up by him. And what do we see here? Bruises of varying degrees, the ligature marks on her neck and the fact that she’s not wearing the engagement ring are speaking for themselves,’
‘Obviously. I thought it would suit you better than my brother’s,’
‘You did what?’
‘You came,’
The smell of his eau-de-cologne and cigarettes made my head start spinning.
I stayed beside his bed the whole night. The wound was serious, but thanks god no vital organs were affected. Once I handled the bleeding, I could finally calm down.
‘John,’ Sherlock said, his voice trembling and his eyes fixed on the man, ‘Stay back,’
‘You don’t have to pretend with me…’ Sherlock’s hand gently rested on the gun, slowly lowering it down. I closed my eyes, not being able to fight back. I never could.
Are you sticking to the tradition for one of the sides (usually, female) to be late?
‘Thread?’ he repeated with a sneer.
In a dark room, lightened by ultraviolet and usual lights, surrounded by broken, dusty furniture, was lying the body of a woman. It was dressed in an almost fully destroyed office suite of dark violet colour. And even though the head was unmistakably missing, all around her were wisps of tangled brown hair, drowning in dark thick liquid spreading all around it.
Hope you'll enjoy this new chapter, which is slightly (or very much) bigger than the first one because it's about time to really stop talking in riddles and reveal the storyline hehe
‘Seb-Sebastian…’ he was going to add something more, but suddenly he leaned over the edge of the bed and vomited right on the floor.
“I am waiting.
‘What the…’ I looked up, meeting with his blurry gaze. I was angry, but not even at him. I was angry at myself. He needed me and I wasn’t there. And now he might…
‘I hope you’ll be happy together…’ Moran mumbled, biting his cheek from the inside.
Mrs Hudson quickly said her goodbyes and went back to her little kingdom of never-ending TV morning shows and radio, leaving me alone with a ghost of someone I used to know.
I clenched my teeth, watching him and slowly pulling out the gun. Suddenly he looked at me and tilted his head. Something about his gaze turned my heart cold in terror. I was very familiar with that crazy look.
I stopped, breathing heavily. Molly Hooper was standing right next to a retractable table. She forced a smile for me and took several steps back.
“Oh god, yes,”
‘Yes! Sherlock asked me to, actually,’ her face brightened up with a quite proud smile and I felt slight irritation, ‘He said he’d be needing the rooftop for something and I stayed to be the one, who locks it up today,’
‘Don’t worry. They’ve done worse things. Much worse…’ he grinned and then leaned in to whisper in my ear, ‘I suggest we resume after we are done here,’
‘Which is never?’
And now Mycroft found himself succumbed to the primal temptations too and became a victim of his own decisions. And there was no one to blame for it. Unless…
It was like some sort of competition: our tongues were fighting for dominance and it was slowly growing into something more.
It was colder than I had expected and suddenly I realized that my coat was still inside. I folded my arms, trying to ignore my teeth chattering. Freezing to death seemed more appealing than explaining my behaviour to Sherlock’s older brother.
‘Bottom drawer,’
‘Not yet,’ Sherlock looked up, his gaze circling around the second-floor balcony. I followed the direction of his glance. I had this strange feeling that I’ve already seen all of these people somewhere, but couldn’t remember where, ‘He will have to come down at some point. It’s his party, after all,’
‘I can stand up for myself. And it was just a few bruises,’
‘I think we are done for today. Most of the patients left are Jane’s. We are free to go,’
So yeah, enjoy this because the drama's gonna increase from now on ;)
Sally Donovan approached me with a satisfied grin. I sighed, trying to pull myself together.
A loud cough brought me back to reality. The car wasn’t moving anymore and I could hear loud music muffled coming from outside. More importantly, I felt two pairs of eyes staring at us. I backed away harshly, trying to ignore Greg and Mycroft’s shocked face expressions and Sherlock stifling a snicker.
‘Isn’t it suspicious?’ I said, putting down the newspaper while Sherlock was pouring the coffee in my cup.
Sebastian quietly opened the door and walked in, closing it after himself.
‘We are absolutely not,’ I said, bringing up a storm of emotions on Sherlock’s face, but continued, ‘Why does he need us there though?’
‘What do you mean?’
‘I don’t know,’ he swallowed. My hand reflexively tightened on his arm, ‘But stay sharp,’
I held my breath involuntary as my eyes fixed on his lips. He smiled, noticing.
I had to take several breaths before I could let out even a word. I felt like something was clenching my chest. Mycroft frowned a little in disapproval. It’s not like I expected him to understand.
‘John! Get ready. I’ll call a cab,’ we heard his muffled voice from the bedroom, ‘We need to find you something decent to wear,’
I dropped the knife and fell down on my knees, my face against his waist. My hands were shaking as I touched his hand that was covering the wound.
‘I wouldn’t hold on too much hope,’ Sherlock mumbled. He paused and looked around the room, ‘There. C’mon,’
Sometimes I felt like I didn’t know Sherlock at all. Like he just let me get to know some tiny part of his character so I would piss off. And now when I finally had the chance to find out more, I was terrified. What if I find something, deep down in his soul, which will change everything? And seems like the psychopathic killer part isn’t the worst that can happen for me…
‘I am done with the soldier boy,’ Sebastian looked at Jim, satisfied, who has just walked around the table and slumped into a chair, exhausted, ‘He’s with us,’
I brushed my hand through his hair, trying to distract him. His head leaned closer to my touch.
I could barely breathe. My hand touched his stone-cold cheek and I smiled ruefully: my body still quivered to his every touch. And I refused to believe it was the last time.
This is officially the last chapter with jumping in time: from this chapter on it's going to be just one storyline unfolding and I am hella excited about writing it (I can't even predict myself what's gonna happen haha).
‘Why there?’
‘Sebastian Moran. Pleased to meet you, Dr Watson,’
I caught up with Sherlock when he was already waving to a cab on the side of the road. I went over and jerked him sharply by the sleeve of his coat, turning him around.
‘Indeed he did, Sergeant Donovan,’ I turned to her, making myself sound as coldblooded as I could. I had a lot of experience after all. So many years by Sherlock’s side weren’t an entirely wasted time, ‘Now you can finally try your luck and leave me alone,’
I almost jumped back with my hand pressed over my mouth. A wave of complete horror and disgust covered me, my eyes glared at the freaking human hand peeking out of the whole. My hands were shaking and I barely managed to close the bag and kick it back with my feet, pushing it away to the wall.
All of a sudden I was out of breath and I prayed he wouldn’t notice. But it’s Sherlock. Of course, he did. But if so, he decided not to show it. His eyes went back to the fire and I looked down, trying to calm myself down. Why was my heart beating so fast?
‘I think that soon you’ll have to go around with a lifeguard for your own safety, Sherlock,’ Greg said, smiling at me, pleased with himself. Sherlock shrugged his shoulders.
‘Ghm, Mycroft asked me to invite you to the charity evening tonight for him to...’
At once I staggered back in horror. I pressed my hand to my chest.
I pressed my lips together, holding back a burst of laughter, while Sherlock’s pale cheeks flushed barely noticeable.
‘Please do stick to the plan, brother,’ he put the phone in the pocket and sighed as if he knew the plan was already doomed from the start, ‘Magnussen is not the best option for demonstration of your volatility and pride,’
‘Hu-hu!’
It took me several minutes to force myself to get up, supporting myself against the wall. I took a bunch of small breaths, grimacing from pain every time and managed to make my way to the door of our flat, practically falling onto it.
Voices echoed in my head when I passed the pavement where two years ago I watched the person that was my whole world leave me.
Finally, he moved away, breathless, and smiled widely. His eyes were sparkling with such desire that I’ve never seen before. I smirked, pleased with myself.
I looked down at his hand and back at his face. He lifted his eyebrows and bowed slightly, steadfast. My heart was close to its stopping and I did the only thing I could. Accepting my fate, I took Sherlock’s hand and let him pull me round with him.
‘Holmes,’ Sherlock rattled off. The butler opened his mouth to ask something, but Sherlock got ahead: his hand slid down my waist and pressed me to his thigh. My eyes widened, but I managed to put myself together before the butler looked up again, ‘John Holmes. But I’d appreciate it if this remained between us…’
‘Fascinating,’ Sherlock replied. We were now both avoiding any eye contact, but I could still hear the irritation in his voice. I bit my lower lip in a wretched attempt to calm myself down.
‘John?’ Sherlock called hesitantly. I looked up and found myself several inches from his face.
‘And I am not,’ I replied caustically, narrowing my eyes, ‘I just thought that selling my soul to the devil would at least change something,’
Hey, guys! Glad to see you back reading my stuff hehe
‘Can I see him?’
I reached my hand out and carefully touched his face with the tips of my fingers. His skin was so cold but soft. If someone told me I would be here, in his bed several weeks ago, I’d laugh in his face. But here I am.
Three weeks before
Sherlock took a deep breath, pulling me in a tight hug and hiding his face in my neck. He trembled.
‘In the end, that’s the reason I took you out of that Iraq hell,’
When Sherlock woke up, I wasn’t there.
The car’s wheels silently glided on damp asphalt carrying us further and further away from the London full of evening bustle. Streetlights and passing cars grew fewer. The narrow gloomy suburb street seamlessly turned into a deserted highway.
Love you all :3
‘There’s something I should say before we do what we do tonight…’ he looked down for a moment, blinking fast like he was plucking up his courage. He looked up again and I could see that he was afraid, ‘I’ve meant to say, always, and I never have…’
‘What are you implying?’
I grabbed the doorknob, holding my breath. “Whatever…”
"Once you eliminate the impossible…"
Magnussen smiled wanly. His hand made a hardly noticeable gesture in the air. A whole flock of people dressed in dark inconspicuous suits immediately hurried to drag the tables and other furniture to the walls, freeing up space in the centre of the room.
Before I could see the source of the sound Sherlock frowned and pushed me back with one arm, standing before me like a shield.
Don’t get me wrong, I have nothing against Molly. And in the beginning, her feelings for Sherlock and her willingness to help him at first call were adorable, but over the years it started to slightly annoy me.
I was angry at myself for leaving. Angry at him for pissing me off. Angry at Moriarty for coming back when I was about to…
‘I used to,’ Sherlock replied, closing his eyes. He took a small breath, ‘Mycroft trashed it all when I was gone,’
‘It was his work?’ I asked, starting to fume mad. This madman never failed to amuse me.
I chuckled to myself, biting my lip. I quickly texted back.
But the sudden voice from the back made us wheel around.
I got up, quietly cursing everything and everyone and trying to ignore enormous red stains on my pants. Lestrade opened his mouth in trying to say something, but failed and started looking very busy and calling for examiners. I exited the room, manoeuvring between white-suited people in masks, like a guilty child.
Moran came closer to the table to look at the folder, the insides of which were messed up more than any other and took the black and white picture to his hand. He chuckled, not surprised.
My fingers slipped down to his chin and I could feel that I completely lost it.
My breath grew short and I hastened to look away. Sherlock Holmes is jealous. Or maybe he’s just a very good actor. In both cases, I felt extremely uncomfortable. That is why I was happy to hear Greg’s voice in my ear.
I was about to turn around the corner of our house when I felt a sudden strong push on my back causing me to fall face forward. And before I could get up and understand what happened, someone grabbed me by the arm and turned me on my back, planting a brutal shot to the face.
The quiet gentle voice didn’t suit Jim at all. But it always helped him to fool the ones, who needed to be fooled.
