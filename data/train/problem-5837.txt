Steve flushes, not entirely sure how to handle this. "Ok, ok, to be fair, I only had an hour of sleep that night."
"You're all I want." Steve reaches down between them to tug at Tony's belt, undoing the buckle with practiced ease.
"Oh yeah! Did you not see the press conference? Me and Rogers are no longer officially dead as of.. an hour ago." Tony feels a hand slip into his. "I'll just track you kid."
"He also mentioned Tony Stark twice, which surprised me because the most recent pictures we have of Tony put him in Malibu only a few hours ago."
"And I'll pay you for a thousand cakes," he says in an equally sappy tone. "Seriously though, how much do you want. Ten, fifteen?"
Steve laughs. "Yeah, it woulda." Pietro was a good guy. He never failed to brighten any room he was in, even if sometimes his humor was a little dry. He even cleaned up nice when he wanted to, and one day he would make a just fine husband. As it stood now, he tended to jump from girl to girl, but the one he was with now was pretty nice. Steve had even met her once, which was further then most of the girls got. Crystalia, her name was. She said her dad had never been in the picture and her mom had gotten to the birth certificate before the birth drugs had worn off. Everyone just called her Crystal though, which was an actual name, so what did Steve know really. "I didn't know you were scheduled so early," Steve says, squinting at Pietro.
Halfway through his shift, he gets a text from an unsaved number that only serves to widen his smile.
"Do you want to see Peggy? She's busy, but I'm sure she'll make time for you." His voice is tender at that, because of course he knows exactly how much he missed her. How much he hopes she misses him.
She looks up at him with swimming orange eyes. Her eyes scan his face carefully. "It's doing it isn't it." He nods once in confirmation. It must've been something in his face, maybe  "I'm going to... here." She sets her hands on either side of his face and they begin to glow. He's not worried; he trusts Natasha with every fiber in his being even when he shouldn't. But right now, he definitely should, because he can feel his body temperature regulating to its normal status and his head clearing.
"Yes, I'm afraid we've been out of contact for quite a while, working closely with Howard Stark. He doesn't appreciate fraternizing with the enemy."
Sam goes silent for such a long while that if it weren't for the road noises, Steve would assume they lost connection. "Fine," he says finally. "Where are you."
Morgan takes Peppers hand, and Pepper squeezes it. "Let's head inside." Steve gets the door for them, and mother and daughter walk in, Pepper sitting on the couch next to Happy and Morgan situating herself on Pepper's lap. Steve goes to stand behind them, next to Thor, who was also apparently here. Pepper pushes something on a remote, and Tony appears, sitting backwards in a chair. Rhodey shifts in his seat, his hand clenching the arm of his chair. Steve remains as still as a block of wood, the only sign of agitation a tightening of his jaw.
The important thing to focus on was that he was going to see Bucky tomorrow and they would be able to start planning an extraction, not the terrible things he's had to do to get here.
Bucky hesitates, but seems to understand that he should drop it until after work. "Uh, ok.. this guy wants to know if you can make that cake he asked for by Sunday."
"What's up with you?" Steve asks, pulling him away from the fridge and kicking it shut. Tony was always weird, but this was funny behavior, even for him.
"One of the six singularities created at the dawn of the universe, sister to the aether, lost to the ages."
Steve rolls his eyes. "Come on genius," he pulls Tony to supporting his own weight and closes the door behind them. "You don't get to eat the cake until the reception, Peter."
"I was sent here to defend the soul stone, which I can never possess myself. Well.. could never possess myself. It looks like you have brought it here for me."
She shrugs, hardly acknowledging the paparazzi flashing around them. "Fury doesn't see it necessary to mention a lot of things. Now, are we going to talk about work the whole time?"
The party proceeds as if nothing was wrong. As if there weren't a massive elephant in the room. Peter always keeps at least one person as a buffer between him and his dad, and Steve doesn't leave Tony's side, their hands intertwined. As the night progressed, so too did Tony's fidgeting.
Roaring wind races past his ears, then Tony feels pressure on his right arm his eyes snap open to see a red and gold gauntlet, then another snapping over his arms. Two boots, followed by the chest piece ant the helmet folding over his head. "No! Friday!"
"Nice to.. meet you too," Steve says, feeling the smoke rising from his brain. Maybe he should have just fled and made Sam take care of this. He didn't know how he was going to make it through this. "Um.. you can sit down over there if you'd like.. I'll get the samples."
Bucky turns, his eyebrows shooting up into his hair. "We met. Oh no wait, you were on a date, weren't you. Oh, I'm so—"
Yeah, Pepper looked great, but that's not who Steve wanted to make out with on the spot. Tony looks over at Steve as if he can read his mind (or maybe he just noticed the obvious staring (not that steve couldn't stare, they were dating)) and he smiles in a way that makes Steve's insides melt. "Platypus!" Tony says, looking back away from Steve, and that jackass knew exactly what he was doing. "May I say hi?" He says to Pepper, even with his arms wrapped tightly around Rhodey neck.
He steps out into the street, pushing his wrapper into the recycling bin against the door. The street is busy, but not as busy as it could be during the day. It was nice out, and a cool breeze sweeps through his hair. He could go home, but what kind of a man would he be to waste a day like this, especially when he knew he had a tiny sketchbook tucked away in his wallet.
"I'm always cute Nat," he says, bumping her with his hip. His beard was shaven off and his hair was bleached and re dyed to blond, but still much longer then this Steve's hair. Other then that, they may as well be clones. The implications of that were scary for Steve, and he didn't really wasn't to think about it actually. He looks over at her with her loose hair and too thick tie and smiles. "Say hi to me for me."
"From what I understand of Tony before Afghanistan, they were pretty similar. I'm just glad that whatever changed in Howard while he was being a parent didn't change in Tony for Morgan." Steve crosses his arms, half a smile still plastered on his face, but a flicker of genuine sorrow taking his words. It's not that he didn't like Howard, he did, but he also knew very well that the Howard he had known was very different from the Howard Tony had grown up with.
Steve breathes heavily, completely naked sparing Tony's sheets twisted around his legs. Tony walks back in, holding a wet rag with a dopey smile on his face. "Hi beautiful."
Should he.. no. That would just make her panic, and then Howard would lock her up and study her. They had things to do. He would tell her... later. Later. "Howard, can you.. can you keep the stones safe for a while."
Was it possible that this was James Rhodes and that Tony wasn't getting married today. Which would mean that he had actually been into that kiss a week ago and that he wasn't a terrible person and neither was Steve. Oh, but that also meant that Steve had pushed him away and practically told him to get the hell out and proceeded to actually literally hid from him like a child. So there had been actually chemistry between them, and Steve had ruined it by assuming that Tony was getting a cake for his wedding when he had never even said that.
Slowly after that, they began making each other meals, first just a sandwich, then a big bowl of salad left on the counter, from fruit platters, to sweet pancakes set in the center of the table, until eventually they began sharing nearly every meal, trading off cooking duties.
Tony nods, pulling away from Steve. "Yeah.. yeah.." he blinks, then stands up, walking to his large closet. Steve pulls off his own jeans, climbing into Tony's obscenely large bed. He had asked Tony about it once, it was called an Alaskan King, and it was all custom. Well, nobody has ever wished for a smaller bed. Still, Steve was pretty sure that someone could get lost in all that mattress, so he scoots closer to the center, flipping the covers open for Tony. He returns soon, wearing the same shirt and sweatpants combo he had had on earlier, rubbing his eyes as he falls into bed next to Steve, curling into his arms. "You're a good boyfriend."
He scoops up an arm full of branches, very glad for his augmented super strength, as he lugs them down towards the wreck. He positions them leaning up against the top of the plane, and has to make several rounds back to the tree line before he's satisfied with his leaning wall. Then he lugs a pretty large pile of logs and sticks into the plane, setting them down in a pile near the controls. He directs his attention to Steve, who had somehow found a space blanket and was sitting in the pilots seat. "Cap?" Tony asks softly, but the other man is very firmly asleep. That was probably for the better. Steve could sleep off the pain, and hopefully any memories of that conversation. "Jarvis, you think we can start a fire," he mutters, almost to himself.
"Sounds great," Steve smiles. They all end up in the kitchen, and it's true what they say about too many cooks. Eventually everybody gets their burgers and they all sit around on the floor in Tony's living room, the coffee table pushed to the side, eating and laughing. Tony is incredibly thankful that he's getting along with all of Steve's family as well as Steve got along with his.
It's then that Tony comes down, looking, perhaps better than Steve had ever seen him, in a black tee shirt and black jacket combo with oil stained jeans on bottom. Really though, didn't Steve think that every time he saw Tony? "Thanks.." he says to Rhodey, snapping out of his trance only to go set the box next to Steve's own gift.
"We'll pick them up kiddo. It's all okay now." It takes a matter of seconds for Friday to pull up Peters location. "See you in a second."
"Hey there, I came in last week about a wedding cake? I was wondering if I could stop by sometime after closing to do a cake testing. I'll be more then willing to compensate you for the extra time." The voice on the other side says and Steve feels his heart leap into his throat. He knew that voice.
Steve laughs, pulling Tony closer with that same arm. "I think I'll still keep giving you reasons, if that's alright with you."
Still, there was a pressing need for a sudden speeding up of the time tables, so drastic measures were going to have to be taken. A month. If Howard could hold out a month, Nat would go back with or without Bucky and leave Steve there. It wasn't ideal, but only Steve could bring Bucky back.
"Not your fault." Steve sighs, feeling very small. "What do you think. Do we need damage control? I mean, I guess I'll have to resign now, so it shouldn't really matter."
It's refreshing to be able to talk to someone he doesn't already know. His friends are amazing, but it's been a long time since Steve's been able to get to know someone, and have someone get to know him in turn.
The next day, they're in England posing at that US embassy for the front pages of a newspaper proclaiming: US VETS STRANDED IN KOREA SAVE RUSSIAN WOMAN LEFT TO DIE BY SOVIETS. Then they get to Howard's boat and are off on the way back safe to America with time to spare. It's Howard who greets them, and he looks a mixture of thrilled and pissed. "The news paper! Seriously?" He proclaims, then sweeps them all into a rather awkward hug. "I mean really, you were supposed to keep a low profile," he grumbles, then let's go of them. "Hey Barnes, glad you're back with us."
"Grand, sweetie," Tony responds with a sappy smile. "We can just go fifteen. It was a really fucking good cake."
"Don't worry doll, I can practice discretion. I assume that means you're not going to want to stick around and meet Maria?" He turns away, walking back towards where he had been working.
Gideon doesn't smile as he walks off, but Natasha does, pulling Steve's hand to wrap around her waist as she begins to walk towards where Howard and Maria were standing.
Steve bites his lip. "Yeah I can do that. Can you ask him if he meant to write a check for three thousand dollars?"
There had to have been a reason that he hadn't done this sooner. Something right on the edge of Steve's fogged up mind.
"Tony." Tony shuts him up with a cold set look staring down at the tablet. Steve sinks into his bed, squeezing his eyes shut. "It wasn't him," Steve says quietly, cursing himself for the tears prickling at his eyes.
Steve nods a couple times, his eyes darting between Tony's face and tented pants. "Use the tie as a blindfold, dear." Tony has to stare back at him for a moment before Steve complies. "You already know who's fucking you, don't you," Tony mutters as a halfway explanation, really more just wanting to get Steve all rumpled up.
Steve nods, pulling out his phone. He selects Sams number, undeniably grateful for how calmly Tony was handling all of this. If this was a test, Tony would've passed with flying colors and the night was still young. The phone rings against his ear, once, twice before Sam picks up. "What do you want Rogers."
"Steve Rogers. I must say, I never expected to meet again." The voice belongs to a creature Steve had never expected to meet again. Johann Schmidt, the Red Skull. The head of HYDRA that got away.
"Please sit down Sir," she says, holding her hands out and taking a step back, her fingers twitching for a gun that wasn't really at her side.
Steve frowns deeply, rubbing the eraser on his pencil against his scalp. He just couldn't get the angle on that building right.. he couldn't capture its sleek modernized elegance. Things were smooth before 1845, but everything was dirty. The depression, the war, the streets of Brooklyn. Steve had never seen an elegant thing in his life before 2012. At first it had upset him... why did everything need to be immaculate? Was it not enough that things were there?
That's how he knows Tony's going to be perfectly alright. Once he's making butt jokes, it's all uphill from there. "I love you so much." Steve confesses once more, tightening his grip on Tony. Steve has a feeling that this wouldn't be the last they heard from Becca, but at least now they were a little more prepared in battling her brand of homophobia, and hopefully helping her son. Jack was a good kid, and Steve would hate to see her ruin him.
The elevator dings, and Tony gets to his feet as Bruce walks through the door, a bowl in hand. "Happy birthday Tony," he says, extending the bowl.
Eight days later they receive a summoning to a previously unheard of outer facility, only nine miles from where they were. This whole time, they had been so close. Nat insists they walk instead of taking a transport. Once they're deep in the Siberian woods, they pick up a jog, while trading free words. Nothing too incriminating, but things that were honest and real, not sent through a filter that would approve them for HYDRA ears.
"Oh, we drove actually. AJ and Lucas get sick on flights." She sets a hand on his arm. "Have you seen Sammy, by any chance?"
Sam was a good employee and a better friend. One of the perks of being a young business owner is that you can straight up hire your friends, or in Sam's case, befriend your employees. Bucky had come right out of high school and he left for the Army. He returned 5 years later with only one arm and a haunted look in his eyes. He moved to New York to stay with Steve, who had just been starting his business at that point. Bucky hadn't been the same man he was when he left. He was quieter at first, and he would sometimes wake up screaming. Once Steve made the mistake of waking him up in the middle of a nightmare and ended up with a knife to his throat before either of them knew what was happening. After that, Steve put Bucky to work in the shop. There was less time to dwell in the terrible things you did if you were painting walls. Bucky had stayed on, and even though he wasn't great in the kitchen, he could do the front work just fine with one arm.
Remarkably, she doesn't get winded until well into the seventh mile, at which point they slow to a walk. She grabs his hand, squeezing.
Tony bats his eyes at Steve next, clearly doing his absolute best to appear as though nothing was wrong. "You're next lover boy."
"I'll do my best," Tony mutters, leaving it up to Steve to determine exactly what he would be doing his best to do. After all, Tony was a little shit. "I love you," Tony whispers into his skin, sending goosebumps down Steve's arms. Steve lets his fingers find Tony's hips, remembering to continue to sway back and forth so they didn't look entirely like they were doing romantic foreplay in the middle of the dance floor at someone else's wedding.
She regulates her breathing, setting a hand on her chest. "The.. I don't know. Like.. shadows. They grabbed me—wouldn't let me go." Great. That makes no fucking sense.
He looks into the mirror and sees the tears streaming down his face, such a contrast from his impeccable suit. With shaky hands, he brushes away his tears, the cuffs of his suit getting wet. He looks away from the mirror, walking away, to the kitchen. Everything here looked like Tony, the sleek lines of impeccable architecture, the huge windows, the lights he knows run on Ark Reactor power. The kitchen is mostly empty, upon first glance, but upon further observation he sees a small army of ants marching towards a bagel. Scott was here. The kitchen was never empty. Nat was always here. That was her knife on the counter, the peanut butter she always left out, the mission reports hung on the fridge, notated in her handwriting.
"You're not supposed to be back here Becca, you're not in the wedding party." Steve says, walking up to her and setting his arm around her shoulders, not su subtly pulling her away.
"Ok. I believe you." Tony pushes him back, Steve landing on his ass, tears tuning down on his face in front of Tony as his armor peels back. "Fri, don't come no matter what he says." Fear dawns in Steve's eyes as the words register, but Tony's running—sprinting towards the cliff as fast as he can.
Alas, there is nothing to be heard but the crackling of fire, warm against his back. Tony flies up into the air again, landing atop the hull of the plane. He searches slowly for any sight of red and blue, but there's nothing but white show and brown trees.
He takes it, pulling her to her feet. Her fingerless gloved hand lingers in his as they stand chest to chest. "Thank you." He turns to Howard. "I want to know that we can trust you."
"3..2..1" Steve presses the button to send him hurtling through the timestream, finding himself in a hallway in Asgard with... no Nat. Oh no. She could... no, there wasn't anything that could keep her, she was time traveling. She had to be... lost? Dead? No. Then a flash of light and there she is, falling to her knees and gasping for air. Steve exhales, sinking down next to her. "Nat? Are you ok?"
There's a knock at the door. Steve's heart leaps into his throat and he hurried to the door, opening it to find Tony holding a single red rose. He was wearing those red sunglasses again with a deep red shirt. "Sorry I'm a little late Steve, I got caught up on a phone call with Peter. Kid was insistent that Princess Shuri should come stay with us. Well, I can't do that, there isn't enough Xanax in the world that could relax me with those two running around, that girl would completely take over my lab. She's too smart for her own good, and certainly for mine. I don't know how the Queen does it. Now she's amazing. And so kind too for letting Pete stay with her. He's been working on his SAT's too much so I just needed to send him on vacation."
"Gimme. Give me that." He snaps at the tablet, turning on Steve with an intensity he wasn't used to. He can't help but obey, fumbling with the tablet.
But... Bucky pulled him out. That was Bucky. He knows what he saw. If he had to do it all on his own, so be it.
Well shit. If he had to make a wild guess, it would be that Jarvis's speaker system was damaged, because he had responded to Tony's request about the gauntlet. He didn't really want to take the suit off and check on it though, given that it was really fucking cold, which was honestly hardly even on the list of bad things. He walks over to the storage compartment he knew was built into the side of all Hydra planes. In it, he finds a Hydra uniform, a first aid kit, and about a weeks worth of food and water, if he could find cap. If it was just him, he would probably be able to make it two weeks.
Tony's eyes snap open and his body is solid again as he sits up, gasping for air through his tears. He looks down at Steve, who is smiling up at him, his lips parted. He looks different. Weaker. "Steve what—" Steve launches himself up at Tony, thinner arms wrapping around his shoulders.
She raises an eyebrow. "I don't know. This is new territory for everyone. You're time travel long with the mind stone, there's no protocol for this sort of thing. She rubs her elbow slowly. "I know you saved me, which is nice, but if that's all, I need to find something to kill me before the battle is over."
"No!" The scream is anguished like a knife through Tony's heart, but he closes his eyes , letting the tears fall as he hurls himself over the cliff towards the rocky bottom below. "Friday!"
"Well Howard needs to get going. I'll be back to collect you two in a moment." He steers Howard towards the door to leave the room, then in a quieter voice adds: "And I believe you have much to catch me up on, Mr. Stark."
For those of you returning, Hey! Welcome back! Ive got a couple of one shots that will stem off this fic as well, so those will be showing up soon as well!
She pats his hair, smoothing it out gently. "He loves you. A lot. He might not understand today, but he will. He's.. he will." She swoops down to press a little kiss to his forehead. "I'm heading to court. They called me in. Someone might come by asking for a statement."
Tony turns on his blinker, slowing to pull into a spot. "I'm gonna need that back darling," Tony says, smiling  at Steve as he takes his hand back to pull the car around into the spot. Steve steps out of the car, staring at the small mostly nondescript brick building. It was off the beaten path, and he can't help but wonder how Tony found a little place like this. "I know it doesn't look like much." Tony steps up next to him, his soft brown hair blowing in a subtle breeze that hadn't been present when they left Steve's place.
"Steve. Cap. Steve. Yes really. You're living in the future. Really, we'll be getting responses in moments. Things are faster now." He winks, tapping a few more buttons and then setting the tablet down. "There. You want some ice cream? What about Chinese. I can call Clint for Chinese, he's never doing anything important."
"Bet that's what you said to the brunette too," Tony growls, before leaning into the now fully exposed skin on Steve's neck, very ready to paint it purple with bruises that would only be there for a few hours.
And boy, it really was snowing. At his best guess, he would say it was almost 8, and there was probably a foot and a half of snow. "Jarvis, it's looking like I can't hear you right now, so um..." He needed a way to get something close to answers. "Ok, I need to know how much power I've got. So light up my right boot for higher, and left for lower. 70%?" Left. "60%?" Left. He really wasn't liking this. "50%?" Left. "30%?" Right. Thank god. "40%?" Right. "45%?" Neither light up. Ok, presumably that meant he had hit the dot. He could work with that. "Ok." He looks around at the long crater the ship had created when it had fell, a couple inches of snow already covering the freshly upturned dirt. The track probably extended a 100 feet. Presumably, Steve was that way.
"I've never really held a baby, but if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to," Steve cuts in, feeling a bit like an absolutely insane teenage girl.
With due regret Steve loosens his grip on Tony to turn and face her. "To what do I owe the pleasure Becca?"
"Yes." Steve grips his fingers tightly into Tony's hips, sure to wrinkle his suit. "Now let me be good."
Tony flicks his wrist, armor reassembling over his hand. He sets the bandage in his palm, lifting Steve's back into an arch gently, setting the bandage to where he could actually see it from the other side of Steve's body. Ow. "You're so pretty. And nice. Love your pretty eyes." Steve hisses out in pain, his body pliant to Tony's manipulations as he sets a second bandage over the front of the hole and ties them together.
"Tony. You're going to be ok. We're going to be okay." She sets her hand on Tony's shoulder and Strange steps out of a portal with Peter. "Friday."
She throws herself onto the bed, sinking into fluffy blankets. A thumbs up is her only signature to him before she's gone.
"Thank you, sassmaster3000," Steve says, flipping him off, but going to take care of the playmates and crumbs left at table 3.
"Hello Mr. Stark, it's nice to meet you. Hey Steve," Wanda says, returning his glare then smiling at Tony.
"Great, let's go see it and we can be on our merry way," Tony says, feeling Steve physically tens up next to him as the figure chuckles again and says something in German.
He starts to cry. There's no shame in it, just a sort of acceptance. Steve knows very well that Natasha isn't going to judge him for it and that they're alone here. "That's why we're here traveling, isn't it. You just want to find a home." Hearing it put so plainly sends him into another wave of tears, a hollow emptiness curling in his chest. She wasn't wrong though. She wasn't wrong.
Uh. Uhhh. No? Except, the more Steve kept talking, the more Tony's walls broke down, and god, how he hated that. Dumbly, he notices that he's been quiet for a long time, but somehow he doubts Steve had noticed either. "If that's what you want..."
"Just thought I'd let you know." He smiles back and continues walking. It's an odd sort of interaction, the kind that makes Steve's insides turn. Peggy had gotten over him—as she should've—and here was the proof. Steve follows after Daniel into the kitchen where the heated conversation between Peggy and Howard falls silent when he enters the room.
That earns him a startled choked off laugh from Tony that turns into a more natural one. "Yeah yeah alright. You can take me out."
"Twice! It makes the whole story about rescuing the prisoners make more sense though. I can't imagine that kind of loss."
Tony laughs, hitting his shoulder. "I'm actually not worried about it. I think telling him will do more than enough in that department. He's an ass but he's not a dick."
Tony rubs his cheek with the thumb still coated in saliva, then he trails his hand up into Steve's hair, pulling his head back. "Hands behind your back for me. Don't move them unless you need an out." Their easiest nonverbal safe word was three taps on the others body or the floor, and given that Tony was planning on shutting Steve up, he wanted to be clear. Steve complies readily, eagerness thrumming through every muscle on his body.
And that, folks, is how Steve ended up standing in front of Peggy Carter on a Tuesday evening, tears streaming down her face, and her fiancé standing next to her, looking between Steve and Peggy. "So... what am I missing?" He says, flexing his grip on his cane.
"Yeah, we've got places to be. You I assume will go take down HYDRA. For forever. We can tell Howard and Peggy everything we have on the infiltration of SHIELD, and the rest is up for you." Steve says, looking at Nat, who is staring right back at him.
Every one of Steve's last minute plans go right out the window as he leads Tony over to the couch, tossing a blanket around them. "How do you know?" Maybe Tony was just overthinking it. Wouldn't that be nice. Everything would be fine, and Peter would show up. Problem solved.
"These stones are incredible. I've only seen these kinds of readings twice. So tell me. Where the hell did you get these?" Howard's voice rings out, inquisitive and hardly hostile in comparison to the steel bars around him.
"Interesting idea." Tony leans against the counter, resting his elbows and looking at him in a way that makes Steve want to forgo the drinks completely. Another part of him longed to stretch this out as long as possible so he could just keep talking to Tony.
"Tony. I trust you." Somehow, that felt different from every time Steve had said it before. Like perhaps, he meant it more than he had ever meant anything else.
"Ok, that's enough of that," Tony interjects, pushing away from the table. "You two, behave," he says sternly, pointing between his friends.
The corners of Bucky's mouth twitch up. "Fair enough. Lead the way." Tony leads him back into the private elevator, hitting the button to take them up to the first floor of the lab, setting his thumb on the control panel. Really the panel was for show, he knew Jarvis was doing full body scans of both of them right now, but fingerprinting was fun.
Boo yah! After a bit of being awkward (of course), The star Spangled man executed his plan to get a boyfriend. Also Tony gets his ass chewed out by 1 (rightfully) angry Pepper Potts.
"Steve," Pepper says with a smile, her eyes twinkling. "This cake better not be strawberry," she teases.
Sam sits back down, adjusting his tie. "Well, I guess that's... okay? Tony's going to take care of it?"
"Well.. we know better than most that it never gets any easier." Steve says, smiling sadly over at Tony. He squeezes Tony's hand before Tony pulls it back to bring the quinjet down towards where he sees Peter standing with a teenage girl carrying a mace. Sure why not.
"I think my parents would cry if they found out we weren't pure." Steve can almost taste the ire in that one word. The anger of a mother that someone could think her son wasn't perfect.
Steve stands too, fidgeting with his hands. It had been a while since Bucky had had a bad panic attack, so Steve didn't really know what to expect. "Thank you Tony. Let's go," he says quickly, knowing that time was of the essence here.
Turns out that Pietro had knocked over three boxes of cereal that were now scattered across the kitchen floor, Pietro next to them holding a newly fetched broom. "You can go back to bed, I've got this handled."
"Hi guys!" Tony says with a little wave, walking over and hugging Rhodey and Pepper tightly. "Pepper, you look amazing!"
"Everything's good. Come on Happy." Tony walks back towards the jet and up the ramp, to find the kids crowded around Peter and Steve, asking a plethora of questions. Good questions, really, given that they didn't know he was Spider-Man. Well, except for Ned. And apparently MJ. "Hey!" They all fall silent and look at him with a bit of fear. Yeah, he might be 54, but he's still got it. "Sit down kids. You may ask me questions once we get in the air, not them." The teenagers silently get into the surrounding chairs, and Steve goes back to patching Peter up. Tony sets a hand on Steve's shoulder in the quiet commotion. "You good?"
"Hi ma'am. Thanks for the ride." Something about the novelty of the car (they had lost theirs shortly after the house) and the perfection of the woman had always turned him into a respectable boy.
"You shall," Thor agrees, sending a volt of electricity zipping through the body of the final prisoner. Steve sees his gaze lingering on Loki before he turns away, but the younger asguardian is staring at Steve still. "Let's go." Upon reaching the surface, they find a barrage from alien ships and Steve adjusts his shield. Here was the true attack. The one in which Frigga died.
"Ok Bucky, look at me." Thankfully, Bucky didn't look like he was having an actual panic attack right now, so the situation wasn't all lost. Another plus, no tears in his eyes.
Tony smirks, bracing one hand on the wall, using the other to grip Steve's floppy blond hair. "Good boy," he says, before bottoming out in Steve's mouth and holding himself there, letting Steve gag around him he savors the feeling of the slick skin of Steve's throat constricting around him tightly. "Steve," Tony gasps as he begins to thrust unwaveringly, feeling Steve struggle for air around his cock, spit dribbling onto his chin. Steve makes an odd assortment of noises, everywhere between sobs and moans as Tony fucks him. His arms don't move an inch even when the blindfold over his eyes turns dark with tears and he backs himself up against the tiled wall, truly a mess like this. "You need to be—ah—fucked like this every day? Will this stop you... from flirting with anything that..... fuck.. moves." Tony says, the words coming out staggering as he looses himself.
"None of your business," Steve snaps. He still hadn't told a living soul what had happened on Friday night, and quite frankly he would rather keep it that way. He knew there wouldn't be teasing, but there would be judging looks and then pity. He didn't want that.
Puddles of water splash under his feet as he walks the long New York streets, his shoes soaked by the time he finally reaches his apartment building. He usually walked to and from work, the motorcycle in his spot in the parking garage was usually reserved for longer journeys. He climbs the stairs to the 12th floor, pushing through the door and into a quiet apartment. Not uncommon in itself, Wanda spent increasingly more nights at her boyfriends apartment and Pietro had always been quieter. He was content to sit in bed and read, but even the crack under his door was dark. Steve takes his shoes off at the door and hangs his jacket on the hook next to the door. He trudged into his room and throws his clothes in a wet pile in his laundry basket. He pushes into his bathroom and glares at his reflection in the mirror. He looked as disgusting as he felt with his hair plastered to his head and his eyes gaunt and shallow. The water he turns on is warm, but not warm enough to completely erase the chill from the inside of his bones. It was okay though, he deserved it.
He puts it down, letting his phone sit on Peters back, his hand resting over the phone. Peter snores once and Tony's heart melts. He was a good kid. The kids at his school were assholes, but lucky for them, Peter was too good of a kid to let Tony have at them or even have a press conference with Peter. Still, Tony wasn't entirely useless, and he had connections with the royal family of Wakanda, so as soon as the SATs were over, Pete was taking a week off to hang out with Princess Shuri. Unfortunately that meant he wasn't attending Pepper and Rhodey's reception, but Tony insisted on Peter taking off for Wakanda the second the ceremony was over. His phone buzzes under his hand.
"Did you hear they're taking me out of duty?" Tony says, thankful that Steve wasn't moving to pull away.
"I love you so much." Tony's hands automatically wrap around his body, finding him much thinner than ever before. The serum. He gave up the serum. "I'm sorry. I get it if you—"
"2023–10 years from now," Nat says, not protesting when Steve slides a hand around her waist to assist her. It should feel weird, given the circumstances, but things have changed since then. This was the heat of the moment now.
Natasha stands across the room holding a glass of red wine. She's wearing a high necked, sequin covered black dress with an open back and sides, laces holding it up and obscenely massive silver hoop earrings. Somehow she's also managing to keep her balance in 5 inch torture devices. She looks at ease, smiling and laughing and talking in a luscious Russian accent; the opposite of how Steve felt. The heads of HYDRA mingle around them, all as immaculately put together as a puzzle. Steve sets his shoulders and saunters over to Natasha, a dangerous smile on his face. As soon as he's in reach she has a kiss planted on his cheek. "And I'm sure you've met my darling boyfriend, Ivan," she says to the older man she had apparently been conversing with. He has a young woman in a skin tight dress on his arm, and she looks fairly bored, but judging by the diamonds Steve doubted she would be bored enough to leave.
"No wait—" but the line goes dead anyways. God damn it. Never get on a Russians bad side, just a word for the wise. Even if it's only for a minute. She'll make you do something you don't want to. And knowing her, he had probably just interrupted a game of cards or something. He loved Nat, but god could she piss him off.
It's a long awkward conversation that omits many many details from 2023, but that wasn't even their future anymore. There was no telling how much they had changed the events to come in this timeline. Then Steve jr picks up a slice of pumpkin pie, a disbelieving chuckle on his lips. "So then what the hell do we do now. You guys are leaving, right?"
Alright we’re back! This can be read as a standalone, but it references back to the first series a couple times, so you’ve been warned.
Tony hits the auto fly button—which would keep them straight and steady until it was hit again—and leans over to kiss Steve gently. "Thank you."
Tony let's out a huff. "When I was little.. I didn't even know birthday parties were a thing until someone else's came along. I think I was 11. My dad never threw me one, so I didn't get one until I was 17. It was just me and Rhodey. For a while, the celebration felt like a middle finger to my dad. I would have bigger and bigger parties.. and then he died when I was 28. They feel a little empty now. Sometimes my friends do something, usually I get a cake with pressure from Peter.. but.. I just don't care that much." His eyes are focused on the turned off phone he's fiddling with.
Steve pats Bucky's shoulders, they pull apart, but his eyes continue to speak volumes more then anything else ever could. Of course he would miss Bucky, with every fiber in his being, but that was the very problem. He had to go somewhere his actions wouldn't catch up with him. He had to. He had regrets that leaving wouldn't solve too, sure, like the fact that he never told Bucky he liked boys, or Tony that he fancied him. "It's gonna be okay, Buck," he settles on, drawing a faint smile. Then Steve pulls away, finality in his steps as he walks up into the machine, activating the time travel suit.
"No! Don't.. don't do that." Steve sits down on the couch, abandoning his tea cup on the table. That was a lot to process, and his brain didn't work quite like Tony's. He would just have to worry about unpacking that all later. Right now, there was a matter to be attended to. "Sorry um.. yeah. I can.. do a thing. I guess I should explain."
"Never better," he grumbles, slumping back down into the chair and grabbing the med kit off the wall.
An awkward silence hangs in the room for a moment, broken when Howard claps his hands together. "Alright, well, who wants to sit down," he says with all his usual bravado.
The judging and concern increase exponentially. "Not.. really. Not unless you give me a reason. Sam and I are having a date night, remember."
"It's the word!" Tony protests, propping himself up on his elbows to look at Steve. "I don't know. Sounds stressful for three superheroes." But he doesn't sound opposed, and he certainly doesn't sound disgusted enough to dump Steve for suggesting it, so that's a win.
Tony breaks off, but Steve keeps kissing at his jaw. "And let's get a fro yo machine in the tower. Ooh, or a dippin dots."
"Don't be ridiculous, Vanya, that's not real," Nat scolds. "What about extra dinner time rations," she offers as a useless counter.
"Isn't that my line?" Steve sighs deeply, resting his head against Tony's shoulders. "I care. I do. I just can't... I can't let him slip out of my reach again."
"It's ok." Steve rubs Tony's knuckles with his thumb gently, soothing him into dropping the subject. Either Steve would sleep or he wouldn't, it didn't make a difference, not really. No matter what, once they get to wherever they decide to spend the night, they would be tired and together.
It was good. As soon as they're all finished up, it's actually Bucky who mentions cake first. Steve perks up at that word, and Tony can't help but want to kiss his cheek. "Who made cake?" He asks, looking at Nat.
Peter shifts on Tony's chest and Tony rubs his back gently. Rhodey was right, Peter was going to make one hell of a big brother.
"Don't look at me like that. He jumped away from me like I had a knife. I can't get the look in his eyes out of my mind." Tony takes a bite of pop tart, splitting through frosting into strawberry filling that only serves to make him remember the way the kiss felt. "He looked like a deer caught in the headlights and told me I had to leave." Tony furiously neglects to meet the eyes of the nosy teenager in front of him.
"Yeah?" This was going to hurt his heart. He was way to old for this. He hadn't had a crush in.. well, probably a decade, to be honest, but something in him was dusting off cobwebs at even the idea of Steve liking him.
Steve grabs his most expensive wine bottle out of the cabinet—labeled with a sticky note that said nothing but "hands off" to keep the twins away—along with two glasses. "And it's my turn to take you out."
Oh right. Tony was engaged. Steve snaps back away from him, his hands gripping into the counter farther away from Tony, near where he had made the frosting mere moments ago. "I'm so sorry, you need to go." If Steve couldn't control himself, then he would have to get Tony out of here as quickly as possible.
Tony smiles. "Good to hear. Now, I also have the technology to make it.. well, really really strong if that's something you're into. Steve said he started working out so he could make bread." Bucky snorts. "I don't know if you have a similar thing. Or I could just um, put inhibitors on it to make it only exactly as strong as your other arm at any given time."
He inhales deeply, just now realizing that he hadn't been breathing. So that's why his lungs felt like they were being crushed. In for four counts, hold for four counts, out for four counts. In. Hold. Out. The room comes into sharp focus, and he's quite frankly delighted to see that nobody was staring at him like he grew another head. Other then Nat, not a single eye was on him. He offers up a thin smile, and she returns it. You ok?, she taps
"Tomorrow, though. That's tomorrow. Because it's for the third, and today is the second. Jarvis?" Tony smiles, brushing flour off his hands. Not that that made a difference.
Steve only gets more popular when he brings out the cake, proclaiming a happy 20th birthday to Tony. That gets a few laughs, and then they cut into the cake. Steve must say, it's very good. There's a reason his cake is so fucking good, and that's because it's made with love.
They leave Howard a file downloaded directly from HYDRA's servers on the infiltration of SHIELD, along with a letter addressed: To Tony, on his 21st birthday. Steve had written it while they were infiltrating HYDRA and left it here with their stuff. Net smiles down at Tony, grinning up at her. "Hey kiddo," She says, picking him up.
"You too. Bye," she says, a bit muffled like the phone is already being pulled away from her ear to hang up.
Even though Steve hadn't been on a real date in so long, he knew enough to know that it's not really that easy usually.
Tony blinks at her. "Uh sure. Just pinky promise me you won't... upset him."  He pries himself away from the bed, his own hospital gown swinging around his ankles. He had been admitted to the same hospital, but he convinced the nurses to move their beds to the same room, and he's just the right amount of reckless enough to climb into Steve's bed. He wasn't that badly hurt, but it still took some convincing.
"Thanks Mari." Peggy walks out, heading towards the upstairs bathroom, her shoulders stiff as she leaves.
"Not all your dates get you to drive them to find their best friend in the middle of a panic attack and in need of help with an engagement?" Steve jokes, knocking his hip against Tonys.
Tony collapses backwards again into the mass of pillows, looking up at Steve with sweet joy all over his face. "Steveee."
"A week. You should re-dye your hair." She tucks gets feet under her body, leaning easily on the arm rest. Steve nods, focusing back on the TV. It was shit, but that's what he sacrificed coming back into the past. "We've been here for a year tomorrow."
"I mean the irony alone... anyway, what can I do for you? It's not often I meet some of my late fathers old business associates that I didn't already know." Gideon says, taking a sip of his wine. Steve vaguely remembers that he is only nineteen, making that completely illegal.
"You got me." Steve doesn't try to hide the look of adoration in his eyes when he cooks down into Tony's stunning brown eyes.
"Yeah. He's great. Really smart. He was an ass when we met, but... we both came around." Sort of. Then Steve left him alone and almost dead in the Siberian winter after lying to him for years about his parents deaths.
"I try my best," Steve says, unable to stop the joy from blooming through his chest. "Jarvis, can you turn the lights out?"
"Very well, ma'am." And very well it went indeed. He graduated third in his class. Unfortunately, college wasn't cheap enough for a kid living unstably just above the poverty line. Instead, in the middle of the depression, he began to paint. The federal government was paying artists and authors to produce their goods, and as he couldn't exactly get a job in construction, he was left to that. By then, he was saving up to buy a nicer flat for his mom and him. It so turned out that he was good at art—at least, good enough to get by. In the 21st century, he had seen one of his paintings from the time, a look over the New York water, the Statue of Liberty towering over it. There was a boat moored at Ellis isle, and a few immigrants piled off. He remembered that painting, Bucky had been siting next to him while he painted it, licking a cone of strawberry ice cream. He also remembered that he had sold it for almost 40 dollars. Now it was priced at well over three million. It was good, but not that good. The name attached to it was worth that money, not the art. He had asked Tony to buy it and donate it to a veterans relief organization Tony had done so, which was the first markable point in time that Steve realized that he really liked Tony. Because of course, ever the overachiever, Tony had bought every Steve Rogers for sale, and donated it. Just like that. It meant little to Tony in the long run, he wouldn't even miss the money, but to Steve it meant the world. To the vets that got all that money, it meant paid medical bills and meals on the table. The seemingly simple gesture had inspired Steve to start painting again.
Tony let's out a bark of laughter. "Oh, that's adorable Steve. I think you went a little over board though." He reaches over and pokes Steve's upper arm with a pretty smile.
He deflates softly. He knew what Steve looked like when he was lying, and conversely, this was how he looked telling the truth. Cheeks slightly flushed, eyes wide, a serious lilt to his posture. Tony glances down at the floor, taking a deep breath. "Nobody else needs to touch you like that. You, I trust. But not her."
All around him, shouts of "finish him," erupt, and he knows he has to. He feels the fear in the other man as he begins to beat the back of his skull in. He doesn't stop when he feels shattered bone under his knuckles until his fist crashes through the now long dead man's skull, sinking into his brain with a sensation that makes Steve gag.
Bucky lets out a little laugh. "Yeah no, actually I um.. I took a landmine while I was out on a rescue mission. I did finish my mission though."
Ow. Right in his heart. And really, he knew he wasn't enough for Steve, knew that this wouldn't end well, but when he phrased it like that, Tony found himself quite unable to say anything but exactly what Steve wanted to hear. "Jarvis.. set a reminder for next Monday to take Steve out for boba. On a date." His suit lights up once, as if Jarvis was signifying a message received, and Tony feels something palpable in Steve relaxing.
Tony smiles at Steve and waves him over. Alright. He steels himself, walking towards the large table, through the people, some of whom were now dancing. This was all going to be fine, yeah? It's not like he had really done anything wrong. He hadn't kissed anybodies fiancé. Well, at least not that he was aware of. He had, however, probably hurt Tony a little in the past week or so. If Tony's friends wanted to chew him out for that, then they could get that right. They deserve it, even.
"I'll be safe." Not exactly what he wanted to hear, but Thor was already propelling then towards the castle. So there was no time to think about it. No time to think about hardly anything before they're locked in combat with escaped prisoners.
Before Tony can retaliate, the elevator slides open, revealing Victor, Wanda, and Peter, laughing. Steve could feel Tony's heart stop at the sight of Peter, but he looked perfectly healthy, for a 17 year old boy. Victor was the only one of them holding a gift. Peter turns away from Victor, his eyes passing right over Tony with only a twinge of emotion. "Hey guys! Wanda was just telling us a story about Mr. Rogers grabbing a pan from the oven without a mitt."
Maybe it's just the fact that she died and came back to life today (or was that several years from now?), but the thought that that might be her having to adjust to the newness of whatever was going on under her skin does cross his mind. There was no telling what happened to her without extensive testing, and the only person he trusted to do that was dead. Or was he not born yet? Whatever. Time travel was confusing. "Goodnight Nat."
Steve grits his teeth, but walks down the hall to Bucky's room, labeled with "the better groom," which Sam hadn't known about until it was too late. He opens the door to find Clint sitting there, retelling the story of his own wedding while patting Bucky's back comfortingly. "Clint." Steve says, and Clint looks up at him.
"You need to breathe Tony. I need you to breathe for me." Steve walks towards one of the chairs, sitting Tony down in it and kneeling down in front of him. "Tony, focus on me." Tony looks up at him, his hands shaking in his lap. "Four count ok. 1..2..3..4.." on and on they go until the clouds have retreated from his eyes. Finally, Tony stops shaking, and Steve feels like he could cry now too.
"Bye," Steve says, feeling the simple goodbyes like a punch to the gut. He was so screwed. Head over heels for an engaged man. A man who was most certainly out of his league and probably straight and definitely not interested in a baker. The click of the phone is another punch in the face. He deserved every ounce of pain for crushing on Tony. Beautiful, perfect, torturous Tony.
"Night," Steve says, not watching as Sam leaves, flipping the sign to closed after him. Steve turns off the brighter lights, watching the clock turn to 8. Not a minute later, Tony walks through the door in all his same glory, except this time he was wearing a rain jacket over his perfectly styled hair, up in a swooping style. He's got on purple glasses this time, with an AC DC tee shirt under his jacket.
"Thanks champ." She pushes it open, patting him on the shoulder. "You comin boys?" She looks over her shoulder, all of her swagger replenished by the easy success. Steve climbs to his feet and helps Bucky up.
After the longest three hours ever, the door opens back up to reveal Tony, tucked under his jacket, holding it around his body like it was a blanket. "Hey," he says quietly. Steve sets his book aside, sliding over in his bed. Tony apparently is happy to take the silent invitation, based on how he instantly walks towards Steve's bed, sliding under the thin covers next to him. He tucks himself readily under Steve's arm, careful to go slow and not mess with his sore muscles. "I'm sorry. For what I said."
"I need you to return the stones and the hammer. Hank Pym and I are already working on the machine and the particles." He sets a hand on Steve's shoulder, dwarfing him easily. "We should be ready in three days.. maybe four."
Tony follows after him towards the door, stepping out into a crisp night. "So where am I going?" Tony asks, walking swiftly towards the parked car.
Sam pats his shoulder, a sympathetic look on his face. "It's okay man, I'm sure the right person is out there."
"Sorry!" Pietro calls back, somehow sounding wide awake despite the early hour. "Making breakfast before I head in for my shift."
The pain is blinding, just looking at the damage to his arm, but he was nothing if not stubborn as fuck. This was not how Tony Stark was going to go out. He moves up to sit on his knees, assessing the damage to its full extent first. From what he could glean from the carnage, the belt had gotten so tight it had created a weak point in the armor, and when they hit the ground, his body had jerked in just the wrong way that it split the armor and his arm clean in half. Well, not clean. Clean wasn't a luxury.
If he had never left, he might be happier, but he also knew that Sam would've had his ass, and rightfully so. Morning shifts were always the worst.
She pulls back away, setting a fleeting hand on Steve's arm. "It was wonderful, great beaches. Thanks for lending me your beach house."
"Exactly, that's just not right. I mean I had Scott ask him to be his best man, and I'm not even in the party? I mean, let alone the scene he threw, and then he didn't even show up to the wedding." Steve sees red as she plows right ahead. "But that's not what I'm here to talk about, I mean I forgave him a long time ago. I just want to make sure he's doing okay. It's been so long since we've seen each other."
"Fucking hell," Steve growls, taking off towards where he knew Bucky was holed up. "Becca!" He calls as soon as he can see her.
His new paintings hadn't sold for that much, but they had been worth a lot of money, all donated, of course. Steve didn't need the money, he lived in an all expenses paid SHIELD apartment in Washington DC. Then he found Bucky. For the first time, he kept one of his paintings, a red and black piece of the winter soldier contrasted with a blue and white piece of the man frozen in time. Those had been shipped to Stark Tower with the fall of SHIELD, where Tony was given instructions to store them in a safe place.
Steve kisses him gently. "You know you have me." Now that was true. He wasn't in love yet, he knew that, but damnit, he knew he could be, one day. He could feel it every day, snaking into his chest, warm, and fuzzy, and absolutely devoted.
"Mind? I would kill to ride on the back of your motorcycle sweetheart." He gets a little spring in his step while he pulls Steve towards the back entrance Steve had come through at the beginning of the night.
"Let me prove it to you. I'm yours, and nothing anyone else could do would change that. She can flirt all she wants, but I come home with you." A playful smile slips onto Steve's face and that's precisely when Tony knows, in some small way, that Steve
Steve smiles softly, his eyes twinkling behind Tony's red glasses that the genius had lent him until they met again. "Deadly," he confirms, reaching behind his back to tie up the apron.
It's nicely made, with less creamer then Pietro would've put in it if it were for himself, but more then Steve usually preferred. "Hey so Crystal was going to take me to meet her mom next weekend. Can I take a few days off?"
But far be it from Tony to deny Steve anything he wanted. Steve knew that too, that Tony would understand, and that he would get whatever he asked for. He changes his demeanor minutely back to the jealous boyfriend, upset with the transgression. "You may try to prove it," Tony pretends to concede, pulling Steve just a little closer by his tie. "If you think you can."
"You'll never get the stones." They launch into what feels like never ending combat. Given the complete equality of their matching, Steve found it quite difficult to get any sort of upper hand. Gold wraps around his heart and the Skull's face is charred with lightning. Physically they were matched, powerfully they were matched. Steve found himself desperate to prevail, hurling himself into risky moves that would be ill advised in the situation at hand, but he can't help it. In his hands, there is the resting weight of two handles he can't let go of. One he is trying to protect, the other he is using to protect it. Both... he feels both pulsing with a near violent ferocity. He spares a glance down to see the case glowing a vibrant orange light. The next moment his breath is knocked from his chest as he is thrown up into the air, over a mound of rocks, and to the unforgiving rocks below. When his body lands, both of his hands are empty, and many of his bones are broken—maybe even shattered. He groans, stretching his hand out to feel the crackling electricity of the hammer answering his summon, a now familiar weight by his side. He inhales shakily, kneeling up and crawling to the case. It's dented, and one of the clasps is undone, but still in one piece. A pair of boots lands between his fingers and the handle only seconds before he can grab it. No. "A valiant attempt, Captain but—"
"You bet." Steve knew he was lying, and judging off the look in Bucky's eyes, he knew the same thing. The helmet folds over his face.
Also on the 6th day, Natasha finally breaks down crying. The whole trip, she had been trying to get control over her new powers and was no closer then than she was when she began. "Did you learn nothing in Siberia?" She says into his chest, his shirt damp with her tears.
"No." Her voice is small, like she's afraid of the answer. It's not that he wasn't expecting to illicit an emotional answer with a question like that, but her voice almost takes him out. "I have to go through the program." She says it like it's a confession of sin, like it is the worst of her. Perhaps it is. He steps out of the closet to find her curled in the chair facing away from the mirror, his suit jacket still over the shoulders of the chair. She looks... broken wasn't the right word. Just... sorry. She looks up at him with wet eyes shimmering with a pale gold—danger. That's what that meant. That meant that she could burst, and he still wasn't sure what she could do—how much damage she could do. Unfortunately.. he also hasn't been able to bring himself to tell her about it either. They've been isolated occurrences so far, and not once had he or anyone else been put at danger. Maybe that's all it would ever be, a golden glow in her eyes.
"Ivan." The man has his hair slicked back with copious amounts of gel, and it doesn't help Steve's unease that he's wearing a loose coat. He could have any number if weapons under there. This could be a little HYDRA stick up.
Tony smiles slightly, an adorable blush on his cheeks. "Ok, thanks. Thank you. Right. Um, that's my car actually." He points to the car next to the one they had stopped in front of.
Still, Tony knew very well that it wasn't long now before he was beyond the point of being able to reign himself in. He was a romantic at heart, after all. But he was ready. He was ready to fall into Steve's arms, because he just knew that Steve cared more than Sunset ever did. Tony reaches up to run his fingers through Steve's adorable bedhead, his breath fluttering onto Tony's lips. "Steve, baby. You're gonna ruin me," Tony says quietly, kissing him again. This time, Steve reciprocates, kissing back softly.
"Very all right with me," Tony says, hooking Steve's hand to pull Steve's champagne glass to his own lips, keeping direct eye contact the whole while. He licks his lips when he's done, and Steve desperately wants to drag him into one of the oddly large bathroom stalls and make out, maybe even more. He could if he wanted. He has the feeling that Tony would be an enthusiastic participant in such an activity. "You know, it's getting late enough that if we left, nobody would bat an eye."
"It's ok, I know." Tony reaches for the first aid kit, searching for bullet wrappings. That would be the closest to an appropriate stopper he would be able to find. While he's searching, Steve's fingers reach for his armored leg, looking for something like comfort. "I'm just looking for a wrapping. Then I'll get you some food."
"Not so much that it can't be taken care of, okay. Sam loves you. A lot, okay," Steve consoles, rubbing Bucky's back steadily. "Hey can you breathe with me? We're going to do five counts in, five out, okay." Bucky nods against his chest and Steve's begins to breathe in the aforementioned rhythm.
He didn't know quite what to make of the exchange, but he knew that Bucky and Tony would be great friends. Bucky had always been into science, more than the regular amount. He had spent hours pouring over crap Steve had no hope of understanding when they were kids. It was fitting that he would become friends with a literal genius. Steve wouldn't put anything past the two of them together.
"Wrong! I know you're classically trained in all sorts of different things, you just specialize in pastries." It made Steve feel all squishy to know that Tony payed that much attention to everything he said.
"I'll be there soon." Sam hangs up first and Steve lets out a heavy breath. He hadn't known what he was going to do if Sam wouldn't come back.
Not that it was a big deal. Tony was an adult. He didn't need to get married, he didn't need to have kids, he didn't need any of it. Sometimes though, he really wishes he could have someone to share his life with.
"Very." Tony leans over to give him a chaste kiss, given their current surroundings. "And last but not least." He makes grabby hands at Rhodey, who was carefully holding the box. He hands it over, and Tony pulls the lid off with no further ceremony. He doesn't say anything for a long time, instead staring down at whatever it was, getting a little misty eyed. "That's baby Tony?" His voice cracks, and he tenderly pulls a black and white photo out of the box. Oh. Ultrasounds.
Steve closes his eyes, stuffing the check in his jacket. Tony would probably come in again and he would be able to have Sam or someone else ask if he meant to leave three thousand dollars. He walks around the rest of the shop, turning off the rest of the lights and discarding the cakes Tony had left behind. By the time he finally pushes through the door, hearing it lock behind him, it was fully dark to the point where it would be dark even if it wasn't still raining.
Tony pauses, flicking his wrist to free his hand up to play gently with the ridges of his armor. "That really depends upon what you remember."
Tony's gut clenches in a way it hasn't in a long time. "It has to be you." Steve snaps back to look at him, his eyes widening. "I'm sorry. I know you don't love me, but I love you, so it has to be you."
This was the actual painful part though. All that had just been a precursor to having to set the bone. One handed. Alone. In a Hydra jet. Tony leans back against the floor, staring up at the ceiling, before directing his attention to his arm. Okay. He could do this. Yeah.
"So I could... feel again?" Bucky asks, sounding entranced as he stares at the data displayed behind Tony mesmerized.
"No no no," Tony interrupts with a little breathy laugh. "He's my friends son. He lives in the tower too though, so we kind of ended up raising Peter and Victor together." Ok, that made a lot more sense. The elevator stops and they step out together, Tony's hand wrapping easily in Steve's like a missing puzzle piece. Steve's heart quickens but he holds on for dear life like Tony is his only lifeline. It was easy to fall together like this. They just fit.
"Um.. why is Peter so scraped up?" Betty asks, leaning into Neds shoulder, obviously falling into that post adrenaline tired haze.
"Please, Steve, were not strangers here." She slips her arm through his, leading him towards the doors.
Bucky pokes his head around the corner, his eyes landing on Steve crouching begins the counter with an air of confusion. "Hey Steve... what are you.. doing?"
"Right. Well, I looked at the list.. kinda a lot, so I have it down pat. Unfortunately, his next assassination isn't until September 7th, 1978, in London. Georgi Markov."
"That's okay." Because sex wasn't really sex if one person had to be coerced into it. "We can just cuddle tonight." Tony nods against his neck, inhaling shakily.
But speaking of Pepper and Rhodey, Tony shifts carefully to get his phone out of his pocket without waking up Peter. He opens the group chat with them and types out a quick message.
"If you like Bucky, and Bucky likes you." Tony opens his mouth, and Steve puts a hand over it to silence him. "And I like Bucky, and Bucky probably still likes me, and you like me and I like you..."
"Exactly. And, praise god, she is staying there when Peter comes home on Friday." Tony looks towards the sky in a joking manner.
Generally, he prided himself in not being a jealous person. He had been on the receiving end of unwarranted jealousy more times than he cared to tally up, but he knew Steves body language, and he knew that Steve was absolutely fine with the blatant advances the woman was making on him, even from all the way over here. It was doing things to his insides that hurt in a way he didn't particularly appreciate.
Howard steps out of the car first, holding the door open for Maria, who's bright yellow dress falls around her ankles when she steps out, holding Tony in his baby suit. Steve follows them, his hair dyed black and his beard grown out. Natasha steps out, taking his hand and pulling herself up. Steve collides the door, and she slips her arm through his. The pearls around her gloved wrist are cool on his hand. "Smile dear," She says, beaming at the paparazzi. Luckily, most of their attention was on the Starks. Still, if they recognized him... it was all up. It would be considered far to dangerous to remain in this reality and they would have to leave.
"Surprisingly, I actually didn't find anything about that. Think Fury put a filter on my computer?" Steve bumps her hip with his and they enter the kitchen. She makes a direct line to the wall of liquor bottles and he jumps up onto the counter.
Nat was sweet because she really did try, but Steve was pretty sure by now that it was a lost cause. He couldn't even speak to a customer.
"That's nice, thank you. Would you like to come in?" Steve takes a step back, holding the door open. Tony smiles and steps into the living room, looking out the large windows.
He cups Tony's jaw, pulling the now quite surprised Tony into a tender kiss. He gets over his shock quickly and returns enthusiastically. Steve pulls back, tasing his eyebrow at Tony. "You don't need to apologize, I thought it was cute. Frankly, if you want to keep it up, I'm all ears over here."
Tony let's out a bit of a too uneasy laugh. "Yeah I guess that's what I'm offering you." Bucky's face falls flat. "That's not something I would do for the general public, but I like you, and Steve trusts you, so I'm willing to run with it."
His team tended to make a lot of pop culture references, and Steve was glad to Thor for being in the same boat as his inability to understand.
"Hey kiddo." Steve always felt weird around baby Tony. Howard and Maria loved seeing them together because Steve—in their eyes—was wonderful friends with their very alive and brilliant son in the future. Steve knew though, that he had almost killed Tony. That he was in love with Tony. That on some levels, Steve was responsible for his ultimate undoing. But this Tony wasn't the same as his Tony; this Tony thought of Steve only as a man who wasn't his dad, but was nice. Uncle Steve, maybe one day. Uncle Steve and Aunt Nat, one of whom wasn't born and one of whom was frozen in a block of ice right now. Sure.
Bucky laughs, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "I forgot about that." Tony laughs too and Steve can't help but smile. "But he's an ass too," he adds with a smirk, "when we met, I actually punched him. Like.. hard. It was the first time I'd felt.. well, much of anything since returning from the war." His voice takes on a quiet lilt, like he was longing for those years of his life back. "Mind you, he definitely deserved it. He wouldn't scoot his chair over at the table we were seated around for a vets group. Well, the moderator made me apologize, and he told me he admired me for being able to bruise his jaw with only one arm, so it all turned out fine."
Dinner goes on without a hitch, that is, until Peggy suggests they do this again while she was still in town.
Tony blinks a few times, before nodding. "I'll.. yes." Steve nods silently too. He was honestly surprised that he hadn't been asked to leave yet. Maybe this was a testimony to the fact that Tony's family liked him. Yay.
"You'll have to work a lot harder than that," Steve says with a warm grin. "Besides I'll have to take you out this time."
Tony stiffens and finally pulls away from around Tony to glare at his son. "You don't have to remind me." He sniffles and wipes a fake tear away, squeezing his arm around Steve's waist.
She clicks her pen. "It's really more how can I help you." Tony raises a brow. "The two of you have been seen all around town today, and already the Internet is latching onto that. Would you like to get ahead of it and make an official statement."
"Steve." She gives him a nod, tapping Morgan's back for her to get up so Pepper could rise. "Sorry I didn't text earlier."
"What about now?" He asks, batting his eyelashes. Before Steve can reply, Tony darts around him to open the fridge. "Mm, that cake looks so good. What if I—" Steve grabs his wrist where it is, reaching out towards the cake. Tony looks at him with wide eyes.
As soon as the door closes, he hears Natasha laughing behind him, apparently delighted by his misery. "You're such a disaster Steven. Here have this posch cruptje." She hands him a broken chocolate chip cookie, and it almost makes up for her teasing him.
"Where is Jane?" Thor asks, also relieved that his friend is safe for now. He surely wants to be the first to tell her the good news.
Steve sighs. "I didn't anticipate another rider, so I only have one. I'll be fine, I promise." He pushes the helmet towards Tony with more force. "Just take it, please?" Must be his puppy dog eyes win Tony over because he takes it, despite appearing quite unhappy with the arrangement. He plops behind Steve, plastered firmly against his back, which Steve must say, he quite enjoys. "I'm gonna need you to give me directions," Steve says, running his thumb over one of the hands wrapped tightly around his waist.
"Please. I need you to go back to New York," Tony says, standing next to his car, with Steve's hand in his.
So Tony was going to be an Uncle again, and this time, he would be able to spoil that little kid from the second they're born.
"Happy Birthday," Tony says, pressing a gentle kiss against Steve's lips. As soon as he was finished with the cake, Tony had hurried to Steve's apartment for a full night of sweet kisses and easy touches.
"Four years of culinary school with the Art Institutes in Virginia," he answers readily, pulling out a bag of powdered sugar. "Then I moved up here. It's nice."
"Bubble tea," he answers seriously, closing one hand around Tony's wrist. Tony can't help but laugh, because really, what else was there to do.
"God, no. The closest I've gotten to marriage was kissing." Steve's mind flickers to Sharon and Natasha, the feeling of their lips on his. Neither kiss had meant what it should've to him. With Sharon.. well, she was a great gal, but she kissed him. And they were on the run, so Steve had taken it as a token of good luck and moved on. Nat's kiss had also been on the run, but well, he hadn't not liked that one. It wasn't really a kiss though, not for her and not for him. She was just trying to keep their cover and he... well by that point he was fully aware of his little crush on Tony.
"Agent Romanoff." He greets, nodding civilly, trying to not let his eyes wander from her face. Not even he could deny, she looked amazing. She was amazing.
Hopefully the team would be here soon, and they would be just fine. Until then, they had to proceed as if they would be stuck here for a while. Which meant shelter. Food. Water. Heat. By the time they ran out of food, Steve's healing would definitely have kicked in, and they would be able to go hunting... ew. Until then, heat. The plane could serve as a pretty good rudimentary shelter, but unfortunately, bitter wind was blowing in from the gaping hole in the back, so he would need to cover that up. Then he could worry about a fire, and hopefully start making some of the MREs. "Don't worry your pretty head Cap, I'll take care of it." With that, Tony takes off towards the edge of the crater, and the broken trees. "Ok J, this will be fine. Like Boy Scouts." He could hear Jarvis's comment that Tony had, in fact, never been in Boy Scouts. Irrelevant. He was very smart and sexy. Surely, he could take care of it.
"For him, as long as he needs; for us, five seconds." He liked that notion, it would be as long as he needed. He could stay as long as he needed. He turns and hefts the hammer up into his hands, evening the weight out. "Ready Cap?" Steve nods. "Alright, we'll meet you back here, ok?"
Bucky follows suit, and they sit like that until he looks up at Steve, to wrap his arms around his neck. "Thank you for coming."
Tony's fingers close around the bullet dressing, and he looks up slowly at Steve. "You're gonna be fine Steve. Tell me later." If Steve was trying to
"Don't you care! He killed them Steve. Here maybe you need to watch the video again. He killed them! He choked my mom to death!" He grabs the tablet, brandishing it, before dropping it again.
They do a late lunch at this Greek food truck, that Tony is obsessed with, and he knows that it was the right choice when Steve's eyes light up at the first bite. Again, Tony feels a camera on them, but he has food, and he has Steve. What more could a man ask for?
Steve smiles as he opens the door to find Tony and Peter standing there, both in full suits. A wide smile spreads across Tony's face immediately, and he pulls Steve into a big hug. "It's been too long sweetheart," he says sweetly, and Steve hugs him back just as tightly.
"Captain America." Betty says, with a little bit of awe in her voice. "The article I read said that you had a ring on your metal hand, is that true?" Steve holds up the arm to prove it, and she squeals. "Omg, who is she?"
"The others will be arriving soon, Steve." He nods once, and she squeezes his arm before going back inside. Steve looks through the screen door, and he walks back into the house. He had never felt so small and weak, but somehow, he felt like maybe he wasn't making the wrong choice.
Then Peter lands "Mr. Stark," he gasps. Rhodey smiles and steps back as Peter falls forward towards him. "Hey. Mr. Stark can you hear me? It's Peter."
"Yay," Steve laughs, leaning back just a little, a smile on his face, wider than Tony had ever seen it before. "What do you say we go home?"
"Well, this artery." Tony points to it. "Is miraculously intact given the circumstances. If that one had been torn up like the ones surrounding it, we wouldn't be talking."
"I'm Steve." Steve says easily, smiling up at Ned, from where he had the med kit balanced on Peters knees.
"Any time." Both of their voices were velvety smooth, like dark chocolate. In another life, Stark would've made an amazing spy. "Capsicle. Get up to any grand adventures since last time we met?"
"I'd like to see you try," Steve responds weakly, doing his best to smile up at Tony. It didn't take long to figure out what was wrong with the soldier, but it took a moment for Tony's head to catch up.
Pepper laughs, breaking a tension that maybe wasn't there in the first place. "That certainly sounds like a story."
"It's alright, just a little loud is all. You like AC/DC, right?" He comments, crossing one ankle over the other.
"Peter." Tony says, once only him and Bruce are left standing in the tower, both Bruce and Peter heading for the elevator. Peter turns around and Bruce obviously hesitates before continuing on into the elevator.
The air was crisp against his hot cheeks, and he could practically feel his heart in his chest. This was already so different from any of his other dates. Maybe that was fitting though, because Tony was most certainly different from.. well, anyone Steve had ever met before. He was a forest fire that Steve wouldn't mind getting caught up in. "So Italian," Steve comments, trying to diffuse the hot thoughts in his mind.
But when it comes down to it, isn't it? It gets the point across. "It's beautiful." Really though, he's just looking at Tony, and he knows that Tony knows that, because he's staring right back.
So lots of emotions in this one... In my original draft of this story I had Nat and Steve bring Bucky time traveling Doctor Who style for a while and Nat and Bucky falling in love. Well, I abandoned that idea clearly, but that’s because I wanted to show Steve moving on in a concrete way and the way I want to end this... well, let’s just say that that storyline wouldn’t have worked out. I hope you’re enjoying so far! My posting might get a little splotchy coming up here, I’m nearing the end of the school year, so there’s a lot I need to wrap up, but I do intend on finishing. I love you all!
A shiver goes up Nat's spine, and Steve rubs her back gently. "Right. Well, long story short, we found it. Nat sacrificed herself to it and then I sacrificed the stone to get her back. Apparently, it's okay with overstepping, because it gave her powers. Now there are shadow people. Don't know what that's about."
As he's about to walk away, she lets out a whimper of pain, turning over. "Stark, do you know any Russian songs." Steve asks quietly, rubbing her arm.
"Tony's alive right now," Steve says noncommittally. He would love to go down to earth and.. and what? At this point, him and Tony were just starting to get along, and he had no reason to go to earth. It would be nothing short of self indulgent and reckless. (Although wasn't all of this?).
Steve jr. strides up to him and hugs him tightly. "Thought I lost you," he says, one hand finding the cold metal arm.
Tony raises his head off Steve's chest, looking into his eyes. "I want to be very clear that I would never. Ever."
"That's not very nice... even if it is true," Tony says walking up next to him. He sighs. "I did assume that. I've never made a cake before, but I don't think that's the right texture." It was rather watery.
"You can't cook for shit Tony," Bruce says, patting his back. There's a murmuring if agreement from Pepper and Rhodey.
"Try to get some sleep kid." Then Steve returns to slide right back into the seat next to Tony, their hands spanning the middle area almost immediately.
Except that Steve knew, somewhere in SHIELD's facilities, Zola was working along to instil power through each and every branch of the United States government.
Sure. That's fine. "Ok. Ready?" Tony moves around Steve, then wraps his good hand around the end of the tree branch. "3...2..." He yanks it out, watching Steve practically pass out, not a sound coming out of his lips. Blood gushed out of the renewed hole in his gut, and Tony is very happy that he's not scared of blood. He points his index at the wound, activating his laser finger. That is when Steve starts to groan, his hand raising to clutch at Tony's unoccupied shoulder. "It's ok. It's ok, I got you." The smell of burning flesh reaches his nose before long, but the blood stops.
A month passes before they get a call. Steve answers the phone because he was closer; he doesn't recognize the voice on the other end of the line, but it implores him to meet it at an address he quickly scrawls down along with Natasha. Then the other end of the line is dead, hung up before he could ask a single question. When Nat and Steve leave, Tony is sitting in the front room, his Captain America action figure in his mouth. They take Howard's cheapest car up to the specified location, which turns out to be a Waffle House, the W flickering at them as they pull up. "Well darling, here we go." Steve says, helping her out of the car. They enter the Waffle House, and somehow Natasha instantly identifies the person they are supposed to be meeting with. Must be a spy thing? She slides into the booth across from him, allowing Steve the space to sit next to her. "Anyone sitting here."
Steve shrugs, his eyes flitting to Bucky, who's hands are folded on his lap. He's wearing a shirt without a left arm, the gleaming metal on display for the first time since they've got him. "We don't know how he's gonna react to time travel though."
Tony wrinkles his nose at that, furrowing his eyebrows at Steve. "Call me Tony, please. And what's your name? I can't keep thinking of you as that hunky blond."
Yay, everybody survived! Unfortunately, somebody is still going to snap. Endgame is far from over and there is no certainty  that both of them will make it out alive. Stay tuned for more. Next chapter will be up before the end of the week.
"You can always trust me cap. I hope you know what you're doing, and that whatever it is, I'm behind you."
Steve nods, then walks over to Tony, plastering himself against Tony's back. "Now what were your plans lover boy?"
." He returns to the expanse of snowy skin, biting along Steve's jaw and down to his collarbones, where nobody but Tony would be able to see.
"Of course I do. Bucky, of course I do. Don't ever doubt that. We're family. Forever. And not the shitty kind either." Bucky laughs again. "And I also love Sam. Partially because he's chill, and partially because he makes you happy, and a little because he's gonna be my brother in law now, so I have to, you know. He loves you. I love you. Everybody here wants you two to be happy. And just between you and me, I know you're not going to mess it up."
"Yeah. Really, we were just finishing dessert," Steve says, setting a hand on Bucky's shoulder. "And even if you had called in the middle, I woulda come, you know that, right?"
Tony puts his fork in the frosting and licks the frosting off the metal prongs. Steve can't help but imagine him licking something else. "That's amazing," Tony says after a moment, his sparkling eyes meeting Steve's in a tender way. Suddenly, Steve can't help but feel every inch between them like a burden, few as they were.
"Great." Steve's phone starts ringing right as he's about to take another bite, so he does, savoring it, before pulling out his phone. Steve furrows his brow at Bucky's name on his phone screen. "Hold on, I think I need to take this," Steve says.
"Only 20 times, I think," Tony says with a smile. "To be completely clear though, right back atcha." That's of course when his phone starts ringing in his pocket and Tony's eyes flicker down to it. "You should probably take that," he says, stepping back.
"Well, you see, we actually only procured invites to this event recently. We were undercover working for Howard Stark under the instruction of the late Gideon Malik," she makes a small frown, setting a gentle hand on his arm.
They arrive just after they had left, and Nat stoops over to pick the stone up from where it sat on a rock in a tiny plastic bag. The unconscious form of Peter quill lays in the same position it had been in every other time, his mouth hanging open. Nat's suit dematerializes, revealing the Black Widow under it. "Should I slap him?"
"I'm allergic to strawberries," she corrects, and Steve is very very glad he isn't on the receiving end of her fiery glare. Even James looks increasingly uncomfortable, being in the middle of the face off. He looks up at Steve and shrugs.
Pepper leans into Steve's shoulder, and Wanda and Peter both awww loudly. Tony gives him a look that Steve can only describe as longing. "Have I mentioned how good of a boyfriend you are?"
"Victor's Wanda?" Tony looks over at him with an inquisitive look, even though really he already knew the answer.
"I sent her to my quarters with Lady Natasha." She fixes Natasha with an unimpressed look at that, but Thor pays it no heed, instead nodding and running off, presumably to find Jane. "I was supposed to die then, wasn't I," Frigga says as soon as Thor is gone. Her words hold no emotion and she holds herself regally, but Steve thinks he sees a flicker of pain pass her face.
"It's ok..." Tony rubs at his eyes, curling his legs up towards him. God bless insulated armor. "Feelin better?"
Steve clears his throat. "Um.. well I'm guessing the zebra wasn't real. And probably not Natasha killing the zebra either.." Tony laughs gently, experimentally moving his stiff arm up to his chest. "And obviously the plane crash happened. And so did the.. the tree." He swallows something slowly. Yeah, on a day like this, Tony really hadn't been expecting a stroke of luck to wipe his mind. But.. a guy could hope. "I mean the.. um.. the boba." What a safe way to phrase that little conversation.
"More then I probably should have. You weren't exactly quiet. So long as you can promise that Howard, Maria, and their son will come to no harm from whomever you are searching for by the time 1991 rolls around, I will keep quiet about all of it." He has his hands folded in front of his chest, and his voice is almost unconcerned by the world shaking information he just accidentally received.
Steve's eyes flutter back shut and he lets out a content sigh. "You look so good. Are you my surprise?"
Steve holds up the hammer, and without a second thought, sends a bolt of vibrant lightning straight into his chest. "It's not for you, cocksucker." His voice is monotonous, as if he's reading an excerpt from a particularly boring news article.
Her laugh is quiet like a secret that he longs to hear. "That's not the point, Steve. I know it's been 70 years, but you must understand that you have to fit in at these things."
It had been five months since Steve and Tony's first official date almost exactly, which meant it was also five months since Sam and Bucky were engaged. Peter was coming as Tony's +1, and really it was hardly even weird because Tony had received his own invitation. After all, Tony was the one who fitted Bucky with a brand new prosthetic arm that worked a thousand times better than what he had been using before. Hell, Bucky had even started cooking (the first time had been a disaster, he was picking dough out of the grooves for a week, so now he wore plastic gloves). "Peter, you should be more polite," Tony scolds, not detaching himself from around Steve whatsoever. He had been on a business trip for the past week and a half, so this was the first time they had seen each other in person for a long time.
"No, because." Tony stands up quickly, and Steve sees his body flinch harshly, his hand clenching tightly at his side. "And then... but you. He.." He begins pacing back and forth, face twisting in pain at each step.
"I—yeah." He gets to his feet, and walks after her, sparing a look to Rhodey, who's head is in his hand and who's shoulders are shaking. The screen door closes behind them, and she closes the glass one too. "Pepper I'm—"
"Alas, that means no motorcycle," Tony says, fanning his face with his hand a look of colonial distress on his face as he leans into Steve's chest.
Bucky nods, and Tony gives a little wave of his hand. The scan begins, until Jarvis has a complete holographic model of Bucky from the torso up floating next to him. "Well, that's creepy," Bucky says, grabbing his shirt and tugging it back on.
She looks at him, green eyes crystal clear. "Steve.." It's possible that he's just a moron, but he can't tell at all what that means. What he even wanted it to mean. He feels the common sense leaving his body as he leans forward to kiss her. Their lips meet and sparks fly—literally. From nowhere, gold light rains down on them, each one sending heat rippling through his skin. Her lips were soft.
"Thanks Cap. C'mon Jarvis!" Howard heads up the stairs, lugging his bags of baby stuff. Jarvis nods to Steve and follows in a more dignified manner.
Steve heads back towards the kitchen to grab two more cakes. He brings out all the cakes, two by two, until he finishes. "That's all the cakes, sir. Would you like anything else?"
"You know we could return the rest of the stones, then come back?" She says, knocking her foot against his leg.
"Steve Rogers," Steve says, offering him a hand to shake—the one that meant he wouldn't have to do some maneuvering with the crutch. "I have some explaining to do." Daniel shakes his hand hesitantly, a look of shock on his face.
Rock music begins playing at a surprisingly loud volume and Tony winces. "Sorry, sorry." He turns it down to a more comfortable level and Steve buckled himself into the car. "I don't usually have other people in this car."
Steve doesn't end up in work again until Monday with Wanda, who apparently wants to go to a wedding with Victor on Sunday, and then he's at work all day with Bucky on Tuesday, who is entirely content to chat up customers and Steve alike all day.
"Isn't that the truth," Steve mutters with a smile, as Pietro sets the cup of coffee in front of him.
"You're my best friend Bucky. Now come on, let's go find Sammy, ok?" Bucky nods, and Steve pulls both of them up to their feet. There were certainly plenty of perks to being incredibly strong. Steve waves Tony over, who shuffles closer awkwardly. "Hey Buck, I'd like you to meet Tony, yeah? He drove me."
Jarvis nods. "Very well. Please follow me." He walks crisply towards the grand staircase occupying much of the entryway. Natasha follows him, and Steve follows her. "If you're truly going to be staying for eight years, I believe Howard will be happy to rent you an apartment nearby."
"It gets weirder actually," Nat says, looking over at Bucky who is rising from the chair, nervously waving at him. "You have some catching up to do, cap," Nat says, walking up to him. "Lucky for you, we happen to be great at summaries, would you like to get some lunch." She sets a hand on his arm, smiling kindly.
Tony smiles up at Steve, relived that he would still be alive tomorrow. "My Prince Charming. Ok, you two  can go dance or something. Steve and I are going to go find something to help with, right Steve."
"You know, I'm the best man, but I'm sure I could sneak away to sit with my beautiful date for a minute," Tony says, a very similar look on his face. He was beautiful, like he stepped right out of a painting. Maybe one day he would paint Tony. Hang it up for everyone to see.
She quirks a brow and shrugs. "May as well, right?" She rises, sauntering over to the cell bars. She hangs against them, calling out in a coy voice. "Guard? Guard?"
"Natasha. Fury didn't mention you would be here." His words are quiet and said through a brilliant press smile he had perfected in the 40's.
Dusty rocks crunch under his feet as he walks steadily closer to the top. The nature of her sacrifice could never be recognized by the general population, neither could Tony's. Nobody could ever know that the problem of time travel had been solved. Governments would be vying for the power the second it was announced, and with Tony gone, there was nobody to do damage control and legal work. Nobody who didn't work directly for a government organization. According to public knowledge, Nat and Tony died in the final battle, a heroes death, but not a selfless sacrifice. Not as it was.
Natasha turns, a flicker of shock registering in her eyes. "No, I don't believe I have," she says, taking the blondes outstretched hand in a graceful handshake.
She folds her arms. "Fine, but only because I'm not in the mood to cause a scene like he did." With that she storms off, throwing her bouncing brown curls over her shoulder.
If he were Maria's father, he would be shaking in his boots right now. "I've never met anyone who actually believes in purity of blood."
He shoves her out of the way, slamming the door open with his shoulder and throwing SHIELD guards off of him. He smashes through a glass window and takes off running. Nat comes up next to him, shucking the fake nurses uniform in favor of the black widow suit underneath, tossing the fake bra to the side with the dress and donning her black boots. "He's fast."
Tony heaves our a heavy sigh. "Oh Peter. Come here," Tony says, scooting towards the edge of the bed. Peter obliges, falling into Tony open arms. "Of course I'm not mad. In case you didn't notice, I don't think there's anything wrong with having a boyfriend." Steve smiles. "I just wish you'd told me sooner. When can I meet him?"
"Are you serious? I just wanted to talk to Bucky alone! He's my brother, it's not exactly like I'm overstepping my bounds." Rebecca says adamantly, clearly more than exasperated.
"I know everything Bucky, don't be ridiculous." Steve leans over to plant a kiss on his cheek. Bucky laughs, wrapping his arms around Steve's shoulders. "We have a wedding to put on now, alright?"
Sure enough, the rest of the Avengers gather shortly, including some intergalactic visitors. And.. two teenagers. One of them must be spider man, the other... Steve has no clue. Pepper picks up the wreath of flowers and Tony's first Ark reactor. The people inside follow her out and to the water. Steve stands alone, watching the wreath drift away. Presumably, his mind should be racing, but he can't find a word other then Tony that truly explains his emotions. Tony Tony Tony, his mind chants. But Tony wasn't going to answer. The rest of the day passes by in a blur of faces, hugs, and tears. Until Bruce comes up to him, his eyes red. "Hey Steve. We've still got one more mission left."
Becca blinks at the sudden change in pace. "I'm married," she says, clearly getting over her shock easily.
"We're not naming our—never mind. Yes." Rhodey says, pulling his wife into his arms tightly. "I guess we have an announcement to make you guys." Wanda puts her hands over her heart and both Victor and Peter get the same look in their eyes. Bruce smiles gently, peeking over Tony's shoulder at the pictures. "We're expecting."
"You know very well they're not fake, Tony," he says suggestively, not missing the mischievous smile on Tony's face at that reminder. "I had to take some pretty experimental drugs to get healthy, and then.. well, would you believe me if I said I got muscles because I wanted to be able to knead bread?"
Luckily they had been in one of Tony's quinjets, or they wouldn't have made it to the hospital in time. She had woken up while Clint was still knocked out on anesthesia (her surgery had been performed with precedence). Steve had been out of the room, but Clint later told him that he had woken up to beautiful Russian singing.
"Steve?" Nat asks one night while lounging in a chair in front of a computer she hasn't touched in at least twenty minutes.
Tony winces, a grimacing smile on his face. "That's one that I'm pretty sure I'll remember now. Oh, once I forgot my own birthday, so the surprise party my friends threw me was an actual surprise."
Great job. Excellent. That's exactly how you win a man over. Really, it was a wonder that people weren't falling over themselves to listen to this. Tony clearly feels the same way, given the bewildered and confused look on his face. "I mean.. shit." Another beautiful line. Steve could've been an author in another life, this was perfect word usage. "I thought that the wedding cake was for your wedding, but it's not, actually, which means that um, I probably shouldn't have freaked out when we kissed on Friday."
They pull off the information trade without a hitch. Most of it was outdated or unimportant, but Howard has given them the name of a project—the lighthouse—due to start construction next year. Steve had also thrown in some tidbits of information the weren't particularly helpful to HYDRA, but were helpful to them. Like the idea that Anton Vanko would be working with Howard on a big project from abroad. If they could convince HYDRA to take him out, that was one less problem to be worried about in the future. Steve had seen the footage of Tony fighting his son, Ivan. The fewer threats out there, the better Steve felt about what they were manipulating. Already, there was no telling how much they had changed. There was no threat to the timelines, but the effects of their actions could ripple out to every corner of history.
"Us too," Nat says. Howard and Peggy show up shortly and Steve takes a moment to himself, imagining himself in Steve jrs position. He didn't quite have the life he wanted, but he could live here for the rest of his life. He was never going to fall in love with Tony, but he was going to be happy here.  With Howard and Peggy and Bucky, it was close enough. It was also close enough to 2012 that he would still be ready to face the Chitari when they came.
"Don't even think about it Rogers. I'm a little cold, but my armor is very well insulated, I'll have you know. And you shouldn't be moving. At all." Leave it to Steve to be worried about Tony while he's got a gaping hole in his torso.
To be fair, Steve is pretty proud of the fact that he doesn't fumble with the keys before he gets it open. "Got it. Promise I won't get you cat litter." He pushes the door open and walks backwards over the threshold. "So Sam and Bucky probably aren't going to get married for a few months."
Tony kneels down next to the pile of sticks and logs, and begins arranging them into a teepee. He knew he probably shouldn't start a fire in here, but he was still going to because it was still pretty well ventilated. Tomorrow he could also pile some snow up on his makeshift wall for better insulation, and then they would worry about smoke. Now, it seemed like not a problem. Tony holds his hand up next to the still wet wood, and turns his repulser up to 1% power, a low heat coming out of it.
Tony smiles to himself. "Very, thank you. You?" Tony was pretty sure he didn't move once last night, exhausted as his body was.
"Yeah." It was true. He would fight Tony in that cave again if it came down to it, but he would never have lied. He thought to the two letters tucked safely away with his suit and the Time travel devices. He hadn't planned on leaving this Tony a letter, and he certainly didn't plan on letting the Winter Soldier kill Howard and Maria, but one of those things he would be okay with doing. "You're a good friend, Natasha."
Bucky lets out a choked off laugh that turns more natural. "I don't wanna know about Stevie's sex life." Tony shrugs with a smug look on his face. "But.. I do see the um.. practical applications." His cheeks flush, and Tony grins at him.
They were good for each other, in a way that Steve hadn't really expected. They had clashed a bit at first, but now it was as if there had never been another alternative. It was sweet, how good together they were.
One time, long before the snap, before the takedown of SHIELD even, they had gone to one of Stark's galas together. It was sorta a fun thing, sorta a mission. Fury had gotten intel that some enemy agents would be there to get some SI plans. Steve hadn't wanted to go, and he hadn't been told she would be there, but he did and she was. She had looked stunning, dressed in all red from to the clips holding her hair up and the hoops in her ears down to her pumps. The long dress had shown off her body nicely, with a slit high enough to provide her a full range of motion if the need arose. Perhaps the monochromatic look would've been terrible on anyone else, but she had somehow pulled it off. "Hey there grandpa," she said with her signature smirk on her red lips.
"The government doesn't have this, do they." Bucky's eyes are vulnerable when he looks up at Tony, but it's stated like a fact.
Steve had seemed like he might be different, if only because he hadn't thrown himself at Tony's feet. Now he realized too late that that was because Steve wasn't interested, not because he was interested in a way that was different from the usual.
Where did Howard go wrong? This Howard loved his son so so much, but Tony's brief mentions of his father had revealed all Steve needed to know about his childhood. Howard was distant, busy, downright hurtful, diminishing, angry. Perhaps it would come in time. Maybe it wouldn't. Maybe Tony would be a happier, healthier person in this timeline. Wouldn't that be something. But one thing was for certain, Howard did not set Tony on his path. That was a path that Tony carved himself away from everything Howard had stood for. It didn't hurt to let Howard believe what he wanted to though.
Steve slides closer to Tony almost instantly, clutching his hand. "So, how about I take you to a wedding this time," he mentions, looking away from the private scene unfolding in front of them.
"It wasn't him," Steve pleads, sitting forward, ignoring the strain in his sore muscles and the stitches. "Tony."
Tony looks back at the display, smiling. Right then, a brilliant display shoots up into the sky, with the words, Happy Birthday, etched into the sky. "Happy birthday Steve."
Steve tries not to take that personally, babies just cry. Still, there was a point where if adult Tony saw Steve he might've burst out crying too.
I’d just like to say that bill and teds excellent adventure is actually terrible, but I would watch the new one they’re making. Idc idc.
Sam chuckles wetly, patting his back. "Thanks man. You wouldn't know the name of a good baker, would you?"
Steve takes a moment to pull himself back together, then brings his hands up to Tony's face. "Is this about your dad? We can cancel if you really want."
Then hell opens up behind them as a missile slams into the back of the plane. It explodes loudly, and that's when Tony knows he fucked up. Immediately, he grabs for the seatbelt on the captains seat behind him, wrapping his hand in it so he wouldn't fly out the back end. He spares a glance backwards, not particularly thrilled to see the sky behind him, before focusing back in on the task in front of him. He wasn't going down without a...
The blood rushes to his face, but he can't stop himself from leaning halfway across the table to take the offered dessert. His eyes slip closed and he savors the explosion of strawberry and vanilla across his tongue. Yeah, it wasn't his favorite for nothing. He sinks back into the chair, his eyes opening back up to find Tony starting at him with a look of wonder. Steve feels his throat go dry despite the milky cake still sitting in his mouth. He wants nothing more then to say fuck it and kiss the stunning man across the table. What's wrong with him? There was no way it was ever going to happen. "Thanks," he mutters, looking down at his hands.
Steve goes into work the following morning to find Sam already behind the counter. "Hey, Steve. How was your date."
He smiles with enough brilliance to light up a room. "I've got to call Pepper. She's covered for me in Malibu." Tony stands up, setting his bowl on the table with Steve's since finished tea cup. "I'll probably be in the shop."
Peter begins snoring about halfway through the movie, not that Tony can really blame him with how much he's been studying lately. He's pulled at least two all nighters in the past week to do homework. Worst part is, he wants to do it all himself, not that Tony could really help with English anyway.
Steve drives to the expensive ballroom anyways, careful with the precious cargo in the back of the borrowed Honda. He, after all, was expected to deliver it, and he wasn't going to back out now, even if he wanted to. He pulls around back, 30 minutes before the reception was to start. The window rolls down as a man approaches holding a clipboard. "What do you have?" He asks.
Tony looks up at where Pepper and James are indeed taking their seats with a little huff. "Damnit. I'll catch up with you in a minute, Steve." He retracts his hand from Steve's and Steve lets the hand fall to his side, content with the promise that Tony was going to return. "You two kids behave." He winks at Victor.
"I'm coming with you," Steve says, squeezing his fingers and feeling warmth in his chest at the smile that spreads across Tony's face.
"It is." Jarvis says suddenly from the doorway. Both of them jump, and Steve can feel the near palpable shock radiating off of Natasha at the ability of the butler to sneak up on them. "You may keep it, I don't think she will want it. Please get off the counter."
"Everybody is fully clothed," Tony says with a roll of his eyes that makes Steve smile. At least he was feeling a little better. Steve sits up too, sliding back against the headboard and pillows, letting Tony run the show. "What do you need Pete."
"God no. This is the type of shit they try to wring out of me by hurling money at it. Don't worry, I'm not making superhero's for the government." In fact, Tony was under the impression that super heroes shouldn't exist. They invite challenge, and it's dangerous. "It wouldn't even make you a super hero, let's not get the wrong idea here. You don't need to hurl yourself into danger. It's just an offer." He leans a bit closer, lowering his voice even though nobody else was here. "Steve doesn't have super strength, but god I wish he did," he says with a wink.
"I wouldn't be opposed," Tony finished, almost as if he knew that's what Steve wanted him to do. "He would have to... well, there's a lot of what if's, but I wouldn't be opposed to it. If that's what you're asking."
The water slowly turns cold but Steve doesn't get out until it feels like ice spattering against his back. He turns the water off and steps out, pulling on boxers and a black tee shirt before collapsing into soft sheets. His eyes close to the world but his mind continues replaying the kiss the feeling of Tony's hand on his cheek and the reciprocation of the kiss. It had almost felt like Tony had wanted to be kissing him. Maybe that was just what Steve wanted to have happened, but it had felt so real. It had felt like an actual kiss, and it wasn't Tony who had pulled away, it had been Steve.
Steve goes back to making the frosting, a mix of joy and self loathing swirling in his gut, but nevertheless he finishes the frosting in time for Sam to lean out over the window holding a platter of dark chocolate cupcakes with a smile on his face. "Here ya go," Sam says, as Steve takes the platter, smiling at Sam graciously.
"Hey Steve," Wanda greets. "Vic and I are going to head back to our apartment for the night, I just wanted to check if you needed a ride or anything." She was sweet to think of him. He could also tell that there was a warning to be heard there. She had said our apartment, and since she was still living with Steve, she was probably letting him know that with Pietro gone they were going to spend the night at her place. Which was fine, they can do whatever they want. She does pay rent.
Steve snorts, but his chest gets all fluffy abd warm at the praise. Tony cleans him off gently, then tosses the rag into the laundry and lays right down on top of Steve, curling his hand in Steve's hair. "Thank you for that." His voice takes on a bit more serious of a tone. "There's still a few things we should discuss though."
Natasha follows him towards the elevator first, and Steve would be a damn liar if he didn't enjoy the sight of Howard squirming a bit. They all slide into the elevator, and it goes up two floors, opening into a library. As soon as they're all out, Howard fiddles with a large green book with his hand, and a book case slides closed over the elevator. "There you have it. Jarvis! Can you show our guests to a room!"
"Mhm." He was admittedly very pretty like this, his blonde lashes fluttering softly over his rosy cheeks. "My best friend." Yeah, Tony was way too old for this.
Steve hands over his gift, unable to suppress the grin from that stupid nickname. "Happy birthday." Tony smirks as he pulls away the wrapping, revealing a small box with two matching bracelets. "You mentioned business trips, so I thought these would be a nice way to stay connected. The other one lights up when you tap one."
Tony tosses the paper towels behind him into the trash with a wet thud, and he threads his fingers into Steve's hair, pulling him into a close kiss. Steve's fingers find his hips, holding him close as their mouths work together in tandem, sweet and gentle. Someone pulls on the door to the bathroom outside and they both flinch. "Occupied!" Tony calls back, grabbing Steve again and pulling him back down into his lips.
Tony glares over at the absolutely delicious cake, feeling a coil of emotion in his throat, threatening to spill out. He was never rejected; not because he was hot and rich (even if that had something to do with it), but because he was usually so sure. So certain before he made a move. Besides, it wasn't like he made that many moves anymore, when he could just walk around and get someone to come up the tower.
"Are you fucking kidding? I'm gonna punch that bitch out myself, and I don't even know the story." That was one of his favorite things about Tony, he was fiercely protective of anyone and everyone, especially people he liked.
Steve and Nat make eye contact, and Steve, fiddles with his weapons belt. "That's what we're trying to do sir."
"Well, I found that I actually enjoyed working out, once my lungs weren't on fire," Steve jokes, grabbing his hand out of the air and pulling it up to his lips for a gentle kiss. It was tender, like a scene out of a hallmark movie.
Boom! And we’re back in business baby. Do I think that Marvel will actually bring her back? No, they’re cowards. But, I think that if there is a way, that this makes more sense then anything else. Ok, thank you, have a great day!
Tony is changing when Pepper and Rhodey come in through the elevator, Rhodey holding a small box with a bow on it. "Hey, guys, it's good to see you again," Steve says with a small smile.
Those simple words are nearly enough to bring him to tears. Peter was such a good kid, even if he was a pain in Tony's ass. He wasn't really Tony's kid, but he may as well be. Peter had lost both his parents in a freak accident at the young age of 2, and his aunt and uncle had taken him in for a few years. Then Ben died. Everything changed. Even with the generous salary of an SI employee, May couldn't afford to take care of Peter, pay off all of Ben's secret gambling debts, and fight her reemerging addiction. It was a long battle before she gave up. All her and Ben's debt fell onto the then 8 year old, twice orphaned Peter Parker. Tony had been in a bad place back then too, so if it hadn't been for Pepper who had been a friend of May's he never would've known what was going to happen to Peter. With no family left, he would be sent to foster care, likely slipping into irreversible poverty the second he left the orphanage.
"Ridiculous," Nat says, standing up and grabbing her purse harshly, creasing the leather. "Yelp will be—" she falters, her mouth snapping shut. "Come on Vanya." She turns, her hair fanning around her dramatically, her cup vacated on the table. He grabs both cups, sliding out of the booth and following after her. Once they're in the safety of the car, Nat begins to laugh, taking her cup from Steve, who also laughs. "God, that was the easiest time I've ever had getting away from a bug."
Adam raises a brow at them, an almost smile on his face. "I can organize a showing just for you and your fiancée." And that's how you get bank, hook line and sinker.
"He's creepy," Tony says off handedly, looking back down the cliff. "I guess we have to make a decision."
Tony's eyes snap open and he rubs away the swelling tears, looking at the figure of a nervous Peter Parker. "Nothin to worry about Pete," he says, displaying an award winning press smile.
"When we get outa here, I'm gonna buy you all the bubble tea you want." Tony pries his wrist away, continuing his work.
A sad look takes over her face, which is the exact opposite of what he had been aiming to produce. "I know." There was no point in asking. It wasn't his place, and he didn't even belong here. Soon enough, she could reunite with a Steve who could stay. Who would stay. Who hadn't been through the past 12 years of shit. Who will be reunited with Bucky shortly after emerging from the ice. Who would have a better life. Steve feels his chest tightening with the onset of what was sure to make him look like a lunatic. A panic attack. Because not even Steve Rogers could deal with his problems in a healthy way. No, because his mistakes would always crush down on him. He feels Nat tapping on his arm: Breathe.
Tony looks down at the ground, visibly deflating before Steve's eyes. Sure, the shirt was always big on him, but he had never seen Tony look small. "I think you should just cancel the party," he says quietly.
"Good morning sir," Scott says softly, back to full size when Steve turns back to look at him. He's wearing all black, and there's a small chunk of bagel in his cheek. "Look, I'm sure this is all really hard but—" he rambles quickly.
It was good to see Bucky back on his feet like that. When he started working, he would hardly say a complete sentence to a customer and would only speak to Steve when necessary. Yeah, Steve wouldn't mind going to Bucky's wedding soon. It was written in the stars, as soon as these two assholes got their shit together. He was almost ready to start placing bets on who would propose first with Nat. She said it was going to be Sam, but Steve wouldn't put it past Bucky to grow a pair, not with the way he looks at Sam.
"No, you probably don't need me here. But I can be here anyway, alright. Can you tell me what's wrong, pal?" Steve sits in Clint's recently vacated seat, leaning backwards.
Steve forces his lips up into a smile. "Get to work Wilson," he says teasingly, looking down at the keys dangling from his fingers. "We open in 20."
Steve jr pulls away, keeping a hand on the metal arm. His eyes find it. "That's new. And then.. me with long hair."
Tony's eyebrows shoot up. "Oh, I didn't realize you were the owner. Well, it's nice to meet officially." He holds a gentle hand out to Steve and Steve feels his cheeks flushing at the simple offer of a friendly touch. No—it was casual at best. Steve takes his hand, feeling strong fingers scarred with years of hard work.
"Nat wouldn't quit asking if he was pregnant," Steve adds with a smile, fondly recalling the exact circumstances of that conversation. She was with Steve when Bucky called in sick for Sam so she heard the bit about the cramps. She wouldn't let up the joke for weeks, even Clint got in on it. At one point she even got her ear up on his belly. Sam, ever the sport, did nothing to dissuade the joke and even played into it more than once.
He leans his head against the side of the shower, cold water hitting his back. After that, it's a series of automatic movements that require little to no consideration until the point where he is curled under the thick but scratchy blankets. A few minutes later, Nat slides in next to him, meeting his blue eyes with green ones. She takes his hand, squeezing it in a series of rhythms. You ok?
Steve winces imperceptibly. His last name was reserved for only the most dire of circumstances. "Sam, where are you."
Steve scoops Tony up into his arms, bouncing him against his him. "What do you say we go find your mom."
"Yeah. Um, do you want to go now? Or we could um.. have a drink," Steve offers, putting his hands on the counter shyly. He wouldn't mind either frankly, because Tony was here and this wasn't some elaborate prank on him.
If only that allowance didn't feel like Steve was ready to die. But Tony needed to take it anyways, because he knew in his heart he wouldn't be able to get Steve back any way but flying. "Ok. Hey. We're gonna be ok." He leans into Tony's palm. "I need to carry you. We're going to have to fly." Unfortunately, with only one hand available, he wasn't going to be able to support Steve very well. Come what may, they would be fine.
"I should go. I'll leave this for you." She pats the tablet, before rising, walking out of the hospital room. "All yours Stark."
Tony raises his lips in an uncaring expression. "Doesn't matter if it's true or not. But the night is still young, so we'll just have to wait, huh?"
If you took everything that sometimes ticked him off about Tony and made it into a person, he's pretty fucking sure it would be Howard. "You can't take people's DNA."
"Please, people will be offended no matter what I say." Steve says, leaning his arm against the window. That, he knew, was true. Since the moment he got the serum, he had been expected to say nothing, and if he had to, to make it inspiring and non political. He was Captain America, and if he didn't act a certain way, the world would look down at him and America. If news ever got out that he was bisexual, there would surely be national backlash, even in the 21st century.
"Thank you," Steve says quickly, suddenly feeling the need to get it off his chest. "I know we fight a lot, but you're one of my closest friends, and I really appreciate that you're.. not mad at me."
Peter winces and rolls his eyes. "Mr. Rogers, he's abusing me. You saw that right? Someone call CPS."
It wasn't that he wasn't happy for Tony; the man deserved to be happy more then most. Steve had just never been good at moving on. He hadn't been able to fully move on from Bucky or Peggy... the 40's in general. He had wanted to. He had longed to start something new. Bucky came back to him, but Peggy was gone. Peggy... Peggy was lost to him long before she had died. Tony was lost to him long before he died. Bucky could still move on. Steve had brought him back. Bucky was back to him once more. Except Bucky wasn't his. Bucky shouldn't be his. Steve's biggest regret was knowing that he hadn't moved on, but Bucky still could. There was no place for Steve here any longer; it was time to go. It was time to let Bucky move on. It was time for Steve to get on with his life, but he couldn't do that here.
Tony snorts. "Well, I knew that." He looks at Steve fondly, then it fades back to concern. "I just hope this Wade kid isn't a jackass."
He sinks to his knees, setting both hands on her stomach, that Steve just now noticed was slightly larger than last time he had seen her. Holy shit. "Hi little Tony."
Tony let's out a violent curse as the elevator behind him dings. He turns, positioning himself in front of the bowl—not that he was doing much to hide the mess—with an award winning smile directed towards the person who hopefully wasn't Steve.
Before Steve can say anything, Tony answers easily. "I said it's ok. We were mostly done anyway." Steve smiles gently at Tony, with an understanding that there wasn't another person he would want with him in this moment. The was so calm, so matter of fact. Tony was a man used to handling anything in stride, and Steve couldn't imagine a more useful set of skills right now. Hell, he bets Tony could even handle Peter and Princess Shuri, even if he didn't think so himself.
His body is being pulled apart, his life rewritten and his very coding roped apart until he is no more then a fleeting thought in an endless tunnel of color. All at once, he is thrust back into the real world, a location he's never visited, but one he can recognize well enough. Vormir: 2014. He had missed Clint by no time at all, because he couldn't see any sort of universe altering time implosion. The time suit folds away to the containment device, and he walks forward, each step holding the weight of a thousand suns. By process of elimination, it was easy to tell where he must go; that foreboding mountain jutting into the sky seemed like a good bet. This was where Nat fell to her death. This purple-sky hellscape was where his best friend for the past five years had sacrificed her life and her chance at a happy ending for the fate of the universe.
"That's because they're all fucking stupid and old," Steve grumbles, throwing his jacket over the armchair. "How on earth did you get undressed so quickly."
Steve shakes his head, like that idea distresses him more than anything else. Truth be told, whatever he had to say probably wasn't something he would actually want to tell Tony in his right mind, but there is something to be said for the quantities of adrenaline and endorphins that would be running through his blood right now. Steve produced more than most because it was the only thing like painkillers his body could respond to. Not that Tony could stop even a fucked up Steve from doing whatever the hell he wanted. "I have... a crush on... you. Tony."
Tony was thinking of Steve. It probably wasn't like that, but that didn't stop Steve's knees from going weak. And not to mention, he thought Steve was hunky, which means he was admiring his muscles. "My names Steve. I um.. this is my bakery."
In the end, it didn't matter, because his whole life led him to right here. One mission to expel the six most dangerous objects in the universe from his own reality and save four others. Two dead friends. Ten chances to begin again.
"I'll have to run it by Pepper, but I think that might be the winner," Tony says softly, his voice like velvet against Steve's ears. "Could you do a three layer with this and one double dark chocolate in the middle?"
"Well now that would.. ruin it." Tony pulls him closer for a kiss. "I think you're.." Tony let's out a little fluttering sigh. "You're making good points. What if... we get ready and.. mmh.... continue this conversation tonight."
"You're a good man, Sam, this one is on me though." Sam nods and falls back as he walks up to Bucky, a sad smile on his face. Bucky looks up to meet his eyes, practically glaring. "Don't do anything stupid until I get back."
Steve stands up, kicking the couch. He was suddenly really regretting letting his employees have whatever off time they ask for. Pietro had gone to the last wedding with him, and he had been good at it. But no. Crystal's mom wants to meet him. Damn it.
He had never asked for them back; never even thought to. As far as he cared they were locked in a chest at the bottom of the sea.
The other, worse side of him had wanted Tony to return and.. and do what? What the hell did Steve really expect.
"Exactly.  Now that we have a basic framework, how about we start thinking about what you want it to do. I've been doing some pretty amazing work with Dr. Helen Cho and Dr. Bruce Banner recently, and I believe I could make you a fully functional arm, with pressure detection, heat detection, the whole spiel." Tony displays some of their collaborative work behind him, knowing very well that it was going to go right over his head. It was to much for anyone to understand really, without like, at least three PhDs.
Tony drapes himself backwards, getting the look in his eyes that Steve knows means he's gearing up to undo him completely. "I didn't say we had to publish it Captain," he says, low and breathy, and it goes right to Steve's dick.
Steve considers her and the question. "I love Tony, and I don't know that I ever won't, but... I'm alright. He's gone, but he's right here, and he's going to be great, so I guess I'm fine."
"You're a fucking tease, Rogers," Tony complains, but he's grinning as he grabs a shirt, buttoning it up over his bruised skin.
Lizzie offers her hand to Steve, and he takes it, bringing it to his lips in a smooth move. She blushes red, and smiles up at him with inquisitive blue eyes. "Ivan Pozdnyakov."
"The middle layer is double dark chocolate," Steve supplies, not wanting Pepper to murder his new boyfriend. Or—date. Whatever they were.
Peter lets out a heavy sigh, his hand falling away from his eyes. He wrings his two hands together. "Um.. I guess I'm not exactly sure how to explain. I.. ok, I want you both to um.. promise that you won't freak out." He bites at his lip, his eyes flickering between Steve and Tony.
"Sure you won't get sick of me? I am the one asking you to stay in the 70's for 8 years on a whim while the fate of multiple realities lies in the balance." Steve raises an eyebrow at her. It's not like he would regret the choice, but it was possible she would. This was what he plotted out as his mission to help make several realities become just that much better.
Bucky would know a Russian song. Steve had taken the time to learn a little Russian, but that was a long time ago. Before the Sokovia Accords. Tony had looked at him like he had grown another head when he asked for a Russian teacher, then directed him to a website called Duolingo. He tried, but he had never been able to get through much with the frequency required for him to save the planet.
He jumps back up into the air, flying slowly back towards the wreck he had abandoned. "Steve! Steve!"
"Oh trust me, I know," Tony says with a smirk. "Unfortunately you're not allowed to kiss my friends."
Tony turns the TV off, and Steve can feel his intense eyes searching over his face. "You're not resigning, Rogers. I know you spent a good chunk of time in the freezer, but it's not like than anymore. There are people... a lot of them.. who will probably call for something to that effect, but it's not happening. As far as damage control goes, I don't think there's really much to be done. We can try getting out ahead of this, if you feel comfortable. I know it's not fun to get outed... especially, I assume, by snooty historians. Do you want me to have them fired? I can if you want. Maybe I—"
As he delved deeper into the ways in which society had changed since his fall, with the rise of consumerism and the dawn of a new age of technology, it made sense. Even Stark Tower became beautiful in his eyes, with time. He could appreciate the architectural qualities better once he could understand what it did, what it stood for. He had seen the films. "Peace in our time," Tony said, grinning at a camera. But he knew Tony now. That wasn't really what he wanted, and besides, there was no way. They all knew that. The tower didn't represent peace, it represented the future. In some ways, this still felt like the future, but in others, Steve knew that changes would continue to come. Bigger, better, higher, further, faster.
Bruce and Nat were the best cooks, Steve assumed from the way that both spent so much time in remote places hiding from people. Clint loved ordering takeout so much that it seemed like more than him  not wanting to cook. Steve liked trying new things, but he wasn't as good as the others. Thor insisted on preparing exotic alien dishes with the closest earth substitutes. They often were strange, but pretty good. Tony rarely joined them for a meal, but as far as Steve could tell, he was still eating just fine, so he saw no reason to intervene. When he did cook for the team, he made big pasta dishes from his moms cookbook, or Eastern European dishes from his nanny. Nat liked helping with those.
"For one of you. For the other.." Tony blinks, understanding dawning on him. This was a mission of which only one of them would be returning from. It's ok, they'll figure it out. They always do. "In order to take the stone, you must loose that which you love. An everlasting exchange. A soul for a soul."
He sets a hand on her arm, shaking her slightly. She jolts up at him in a flash, a blade pressed to his throat before he can blink. The scariest thing wasn't where she got the knife so fast, or how quick she had woken, or even the knife pressing into his throat. It was her eyes, glowing an angry orange light out at him. In a flash she is back to normal, slumping against the back of the couch, the knife laying on the couch next to her. "Sorry, sorry."
Wooh! Here we go! Steve FINALLY realizes his mistake, but what’s he going to do about it? Well, probably be a disaster, but that’s obvious, isn’t it.
Tony's weight against his chest is a comfort as they both slip into that pre sleeping phase. The one where a knock on the door can still break you out of it; or a knock does, in fact, break them out of it. Tony sits up almost immediately, his hand reaching for a notch in his headboard that Steve hadn't noticed until now. "Jarvis."
"You going to join me in the showers любимый (darling)?" He nips back, walking next to her and correcting his limp with every step. He doesn't touch her because that would ruin her clothes, but she does clutch his arm with her already bloodied hand.
Tony parks in the garage below the tower, getting out of the car. He takes the cake but leaves the jacket, too drained to care. His feet feel heavy as he trudged into the elevator, not needing to tell JARVIS where they were going before it moves. The doors slide open on the penthouse floor and he steps out, looking down at the cake.
Tony sits a moment after him, pulling out in front of a car that he probably shouldn't've pulled out in front of. It honks behind them, but Tony doesn't bat an eye as he pulls a few sets of dangerous maneuvers to get them to the park in the shortest time possible. Steve stays quiet as not to distract him, instead pulling up his texts to Sam.
Bucky blinks up at Tony in surprise as they all sit on the edge of the fountain. "Well he.. he's very nice. Too nice sometimes." He lets out a laugh and his shoulders ease just a little, which is exactly how Steve knows he's glad he was with Tony instead of anyone else when Bucky called. "He's allergic to pineapple, but once he drank a piña colada with pineapple in it because we saw a woman at another table yelling at our waitress. He was ok, obviously, but he had cramps for days."
Tony holds up the finger of the other gauntlet, grateful for Bucky's idea of a laser finger. He blasts at the bent metal that was still intact, until the gauntlet was in two pieces. He pulls one off, then the other, feeling rather proud of himself for not blacking out. He struggles up to his feet, tapping the reactor. "Jarvis, any idea where we are?"
"The Captain made his own choice. Either way, you will walk away with the soul stone." He turns away and walks back the way they had come, away from Tony and away from Steve.
"Steve I—" she sighs and uses her other hand to wipe under his eyes. "When Clint found me, I was 28. It turned my world upside down. I had to go through years of interrogation and careful observation before anyone there trusted me. By the time it was done, I felt so alienated from the Americans, but I knew I could never go back to the Russians with how much I had given up. I was stranded between two worlds. I took a few months off, disappeared into the American west." her words pause as she reminisces, and her eyes glow orange. For the first time, it doesn't feel malevolent, just as if it's there. "I didn't find what I was looking for until I came back and found Clint with his arms folded, glaring at me. Come on, he said, we have work to do. So I got to work and I never stopped.
"Wonderful." He rambles something about how he always knew that communism would never be able to survive.
Tony looks back at him, a sappy smile on his face. "Well, I thought you'd never ask." He leans forward to press a quick kiss against Steve's lips, his head spinning in the best way. This was his life now. Not too shabby, all things considered. Much better than Tony being married if you asked him. When Steve looks back up, Sam and Bucky are in an embrace, and if Steve has to make a bet, it would be that there was a ring on Bucky's finger. "You're friends are cute," Tony comments, leaning his head against Steve's shoulder.
"Digging for dirt on me hon?" Steve teases. "Fine, um.. the last date I went on that wasn't set up by my friend was five years ago." Bernie Rosenthal. She had gone to high school with Steve way back when, and when they met by chance at a cafe in New York, Steve couldn't help but ask her out at least once. She had always been attractive and smart, and they had gotten along well enough. They had gone on a few dates, and then she left the city without a warning or a trace. He could've tracked her down, but it had only been a few dates, and he didn't exactly feel that much for her. The only reason he had even been able to get her to go out with him though was because there had actually been a conversation to strike up. He usually didn't get that far. Like he said, he wasn't the luckiest or most adept guy when it came to relationships.
Not that he blamed him for that. Nat was rather terrifying. One of Steve's fondest college memories was Nat snapping a dudes finger after he touched her plate presentation of a croissant. Yeah, but somebody had to put Brock in his place, and well.. there was a pretty nurse at the local ER, so maybe he was fine with it.
"Alright Tony," Tony! Tony, Tony, Tony! It was perfect. It fit him like a perfect rhyme, like warm coffee in the morning. "I'll see you on Friday." Already, Steve couldn't wait until Friday. He also felt the need to punch himself in the face.
"Thank you," he mutters against Steve's neck wetly, as if he's going to cry. Not that Steve would blame him if he did, it had been a hell of a night after all.
Tony rises, pulling up the now much shorter Steve Rogers with him. "Sounds good to me Cap." Both their suits fold over their bodies, Steve's actually fitting to his frame that the Captain America uniform had dwarfed. He looked good. Thinner, but good. Who was Tony to question space magic when it had saved Steve's life?
The image shifts so that most of the arm is black, except for some silver detailing. "Ok, so next time you come in, I'll need to implant a mount for the bulk of the arm, and you might need to spend some time with Dr. Cho to regrow some of the nerves in a way that allows me to easily hook up the arm."
"Oh don't sell yourself short baby, I know you got some muscles in there too." Steve pokes him back, earning a grin.
"I have this—" he feels a jolt of electricity pass through his body, and sees Nat convulsing similarly out of the corner of his eye. God damn it.
"We almost died, sir. And I woke up in jail this morning." Peter deadpans, slumping into one of the seats.
Steve, thoroughly confused, takes a first bite of sandwich. God, it's good. Handmade by chef Jemma Simmons, who Steve would've gladly hired if she hadn't wound up working for Fury.
"Not gonna do that." She looks at him then back at the screen. "Say hi yourself dork. He's gonna react just like you did."
Her chest rises and falls as he carries her to the couch in the corner of the room, a coffee table covered with shit in front of it.
"Mr. Stark. You're awake," she says, a smile blooming onto her face. "Once again, I have saved a broken white boy." Tony groans in response, as pain courses into his body—or was that pain killers? "Don't stress yourself. You are safe."
Nat on the other hand, Steve has met in culinary school, a second generation Russian immigrant raised on more Russian then English. She was a whirlwind from the first meeting, after all, both of them shared a love of real red velvet cake. None of that box shit. You make it from scratch the right way, or not at all. She had no interest in dating herself, but she was always the most invested in Steve's love life. They had stuck together after graduation and she moved in with her friend, Maria. She had helped Steve build up the business from the floor up, and if there was a single other person he owed the bakery to, it was her.
"Aww, that's cute," she coos, patting his cheek. "Come on, I wanna drink some of his expensive liquor if we're going to continue this fun story time."
How could he not know that voice. It was a voice that tormented his every sleeping moment and more than it's fair share of walking ones. Well, not just the voice. There was something about that man that Steve couldn't shake off and it was driving him crazy, especially because it was more then his inability to flirt keeping them apart. Hell, he didn't even know if this guy was into men. "Yes, of course. You could come in on Friday." That was three days away. He could wait three days. "We close at 8 on Fridays."
Curse his untimely phone call to Nat. But she was true to her forcing Steve to do it, and he hadn't brought himself to ruin Sam and Bucky's night or tell them exactly why he didn't want to do it.
Tony hurries off, to his room where he tosses off his shirt, grabbing one that he thinks may or may not have been Steve's at some point, and yanking it on before getting a damp rag and wiping at the mess of flour all over his skin and hair. Once he looks semi presentable, he hurries back down to find Bucky staring at his cake batter. "I don't think you did this right."
Bucky brings back about a dozen plates of cake balanced on his arms and Tony just about has a heart attack. Somehow, he doesn't drop any, and they all get their cake safe and sound. It's surprisingly good for something Tony had a hand in cooking, and frosted like the American flag.
"Yeah. It's the only place that reminds me of real Italian food. My moms Italian, and she would cook for me sometimes. God she made the best pasta ai fiori di zucca. It had these zucchini blossoms in it.. I can't really describe it without making it, but I'm afraid I'm not much of a cook. I have the recipes though, so maybe I could get Bruce to make it," Tony muses, getting a wistful took on his face at the mention of his mother. "Oh, Bruce is Victors dad, I don't think I said that." Tony could probably talk for hours, Steve thinks. He was a genius or something, so that brain of his had to be running a mile a minute, even over something like zucchini pasta. "I actually don't like most Italian anymore, but this place is good. Ma might even approve." He blinks once, stopping his train of thought. "I was rambling, sorry," he apologizes with a grimace that Steve wants to kiss right off his face. Oh wait... he could.
Steve rubs circles onto his bare back. "You got a little crush on Bucky?" He teases, bringing the conversation away from things that were annoying to discuss on a lavish bed.
Her hair remains still in the light breeze, and it isn't until then that Steve considers that maybe she isn't quite natural anymore. Sure, he was smart, observational, quick even. It didn't stop him from missing obvious things every now and then. Tony would've thought of it the moment she was back, he would already have a plan of what to do. Steve wasn't dumb, not by any measure, he spent so much time slowing his movements down so he didn't freak people out that sometimes he forgot that he could go faster. He could think faster, move faster. He's been told it's terrifying. Maybe... if there's something wrong with Nat, he can help her become accustomed to slowing down and fitting in. Seems like just yesterday she was teaching him the same thing.
Gideon shrugs. "He was a real character." Which was probably code for: a huge fucking asshole. But of course, none of them would ever say that. Nobody would.
Steve peeks out at him from the bathroom, his skin shiny with water and a smile on his face. "You made me stop, sweetheart."
None of them speak up for a long moment, until Flash finally says something. "Why were Peter and MJ already here?"
He's in a pool of cold water, which he realizes first. Second, the weight of a cool stone pressed into his gauntlet. Third, fingers moving in his other hand. "Steve," he pleads, his eyelids still just too heavy to open.
"Will do." Howard presses his palms together, turning to face them. "Just so you know, you have my full power backing you in whatever you need, so don't hesitate to ask. We're in one of the secret labs under my New York mansion right now, so the government doesn't know you're here, unless they found you out while you were stealing the tesseract, although I think they would've called me in on that. I can get you out of here in secret, or you can walk right out the front doors, or you can stay for a while and get your things together to find Barnes. Now, I have to head upstairs, because Maria might kill me if I'm not with her any longer, but you're welcome to stay down here, or in our quest room. I'm afraid she won't want to see you until after the baby is out, she's a little bloated."
"Duh. Alright best man, go find something last minute to do, I'm going to play angry birds." Steve rolls his eyes, standing up.
Steve rises back to his feet, thoroughly disgusted with himself. Bucky leans through the window, his eyes concerned as they look Steve up and down. "Don't mention it, really. I don't want to talk about it. Also, would you mind doing a wedding for me?"
Before Sam can respond to that in a way that would probably be not so productive in not causing a scene, Tony jumps in, an easy smile on his face that Steve could see right through. "Becca, why don't you and I step outside for a moment. I'd like to talk to you a bit in private."
"The one and only." Natasha says. It's obvious to Steve that she's slipped behind a mask, but nobody else seems to notice.
Curse it all. Curse it fucking all. Clint wasn't technically an employee, so he couldn't do this, and frankly, Steve was pretty sure that Clint would be too chicken to go against what Nat said anyways.
Tony is having a conversation. Or something of the like. Not that he knows what it's about, but it seems to be enough that he periodically nods and makes affirming statements, while the woman who must have told him her name droned on. Usually, he at least tries to pay attention when other people talk, if only as a curtesy. He wasn't that rude and conceited, contrary to popular public belief. When someone decided to talk to him about something, it was at the very least important to them. He knew all that, blah blah blah.
Tony punches his arm. "I had them close it and covered the afternoon of profits. You need to have fun."
"Nice view. Who do you live with?" He asks, most likely noting the music to be heard from behind Pietro's closed door.
"Oh I did. They wouldn't put your name, but turns out you can get almost everything you asked for when you throw money at things."
He kicks his speed up a bit, only to find the still flaming back half of the plane, it's Hydra logo still blazing. Tony lands anyways, holding his injured arm gently. "Steve! Steve!"
He blinks, looking back at Tony, and then to Steve again, nerves obviously taking over. With every second of stretched silence, Steve could feel Tony's panic increasing, and by god Peter better say something soon. "Thanks. I'm.... no, I'm not in trouble." Something sad lurks behind his eyes. "I'll call her and tell her not to wait up." Peter retreats to his room quickly, before Tony can pull himself together to say anything.
Chapter two! Meet the supporting cast, lol. Some of them won’t really appear in this story, but might in later installations if I can’t control myself and keep writing in this universe haha. Enjoy!
After nearly five minutes of silent waiting, Howard's car drives by, stops, and backs up. He rolls the window down, staring at him incredulously over the rims of his glasses. "Rogers?"
Steve lets out a sad single laugh. "Not dead, per se. due to the serum, my body remained frozen for almost 70 years, until I was found in 2011. SHIELD thawed me out, and well.. the rest is classified, I'm afraid."
Clint pretends to gag and Steve scoffs, but he follows up by lifting Tony clean up off the couch, supporting his full weight as Tony readjusts his legs around Steve's waist. "You're lucky I have super strength," Steve absconds, walking towards the elevator that would take them up to their shared floor.
"Sore muscles," he offers as a lame excuse, but she takes it, even though he knows she knows that his muscles wouldn't get sore. She was kind in her own way.
Tony ordered the pasta ai fiori di zucca, which is no surprise to Steve the way he had talked about it. Steve gets a lobster ravioli dish that is absolutely divine, if he says so himself. The date is going good.
She nods, but has a look on her face that makes it very clear that she doesn't understand what he means. Well, he wasn't a hundred percent sure either any more. It had only been a few days between her death and her resurrection, but it had felt like years. Thankfully it's that moment that Tony chooses to wake up, looking up at Steve with huge, inquisitive blue eyes. Then he begins to cry and Maria and Steve both seem to share the thought that Maria should have him.
"I was going to say make a video like you and Stevie did with the journal, but that doesn't sound half bad."
Honestly, he should probably worry about fixing the suit, and his emergency tracker, but that seemed like a very good job for tomorrow. After all, the sun was already dipping below the horizon, and he still needed to eat something.
Steve smiles and leans in, capturing his mouth gently. They hold for a second before separating, both smiling. "I'm okay with all of you."
"Wait, really?" Steve's eyes widen and he feels an open smile on his face. "No way. Do you know the renegade," he teases, pulling his phone out. He unlocks it, downloading TikTok from the App Store.
Steve looks up at the ceiling. He hasn't slept all night, yet the sun rose once more. Yellow light flicked across his vision, and he knows that to go to sleep now would be bad. So he rises, feeling a heaviness to his movements. His hair is dirty, so he walks into the bathroom, pointedly not looking at the broken shield sitting on his table. His reflection looks back at him, 15 years seem to slip away before his eyes. He sighs, turns around, and peels his clothes from his sweaty body. Just because he hadn't slept tonight, didn't mean he hadn't been plagued by nightmares that sent his heart racing. He steps into the shower, turning it up. He can't exactly tell if it is hot or cold water, but it feels nice. With militant precision he hurries through his shower, then steps out, steeling his shoulders for what comes next. On his way to his closet, he passes his discarded suit... the one Tony had made him. His chest collapses in on itself. He pulls on his other suit—the funeral one. The one Tony had bought him for the funeral they had held after the decimation. There had been nothing to bury, but it had needed to be done. Clint hadn't come. Thanos had been dead, and they needed to move on. Tony actually did. Steve never could bring himself to.
"You know, I'm pretty sure I've seen you on a magazine cover once?" Steve jokes, waving Sam and Bucky over.
See, Tony knew that he would be in love, probably before the summer was over. It was a fact for him. It didn't matter how fast it took Steve to get there, because this was going to work. They were good together. Honestly, There wasn't much of a doubt in his mind that he could've easily been in love by now if he wasn't holding back. He trusted Steve, but it had been.. well.. longer than he wanted to count since his last serious relationship had ended with the screamed words that love wasn't enough to make her stay. Sunset was smart, but she was also a manipulative bitch. Logically, he knew that that wasn't Steve, but he couldn't shake the voice that insisted he hadn't thought Sunset wound be like that either.
"Of course. It doesn't hurt anything to speculate. Judging from the context, we can assume that James is the man more commonly known as Bucky Barnes."
"You're such a moron Rogers." She snakes her hand around his neck, pulling him down to press their lips together. He sets his hand on her lower back in a steadying motion even though he feels like he could fall over at any second too. She's warm, he realizes, but it might just be the feeling of overwhelming calm slipping over his body.
"Probably," Tony jokes, graciously cuddling into Steve. "I wanted to tell her I was gay because of your hot ass." Steve laughs.
"Anything for my beloved boss. Even if I find it hard to believe that neither you or Bucky recognized the Tony Stark."
"What about just you, me, and some close friends?" Steve asks gently, running his fingers through Tony's hair.
"The wedding cake. My names Steve Rogers." The mans gaze snaps up to Steve in surprise. His eyes then squint shut in a calculating look. So now Steve's a little uncomfortable. It's fine. "Do you.. have a cart?"
"I know." Steve interrupts him and Bucky disappears for a moment, returning after a short conversation.
Natasha gives them a tight lipped smile, which was a warmer greeting then most people would get to meet her. Not that they would know that. "Hi Maria, lovely to see you again," Peggy says, still blinking at Steve. Luckily though, she had stopped crying, so there was a positive. "You're serious?"
"Only a few minutes. If you want to see me do the renegade that bad, I could just do it for you," he pouts, looking over at Steve with wide brown eyes while they're stopped at a red.
"Gee, was it my birthday today?" Steve teases, looking around at the penthouse, covered with red white and blue decorations. Tony pushes him out of the elevator and towards the crowd, made up of all of his friends and a few of Tony's. "Wait, who's working the bakery?"
Steve finally comes to a halt a few feet away from the object of his more guilty dreams over the past week and the object of his apparently unwarranted self loathing. "This isn't your wedding."
Peter's shaky breath evens out slowly. Steve hardly knew him, but knew nonetheless that Peter was a hell of a kid. And that Tony was completely lost without him, as proven by today. "I don't know. I'll ask."
"Tony, thank god," Happy says, slumping and walking towards him. "No more dying for you. I can't handle the stress."
"Chill pal. Any friend of Steve's is a friend of mine." Tony pats his arm gently. "Besides, I know what it's like to have a panic attack alone, and nobody needs that in their life." Steve smiles, filing that specific information away for a later date. He would have to ask Tony how he handled his panic attacks in order to help him.
He comes to a stop, looking around at the changed landscape. It was far less drastic then Steve's change, but it was enough to give him pause. Steve weighs the shield in his hands, shrugging. Outside, Peggy steps out of a vehicle, an apologetic smile on her face. They exchange a few generally scripted words, then he sweeps her into a hug, burying his face in her neck. They exchange a few more words, then she leads Steve back inside. Steve fiddles with the collar of his uniform as Steve jr's eyes land on them, darting between the two of them. "Okay, I've gotta ask, what the fuck."
