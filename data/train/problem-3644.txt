“Hey,” Dean says. “What’s with the front door routine? Figured you’d just fly in when you were done.” He pauses, and then fills the gap when Jack doesn’t. “How’s your mom?”
He picks a direction and starts walking. All he really has to go on is this ringing in his ears –
“I hope you haven’t suffered,” Cas murmurs, reaching out to cradle Jack’s cheek. It’s an intimate gesture, parental in execution, and when Cas drops his hand Jack rocks on his heels, like he’s already feeling the loss. “They should have told you.”
Billie hums to herself. “Well, that’s the Empty for you. I may have given up a grudge or two, but it isn’t quite so forgiving. Castiel might have wiggled his way out once, but I doubt he’d be able to again. And once those doors slam shut…”
“Well, there you go.”
“Cas,” he manages, and Cas pauses. Dean’s hands feel too unwieldy to do anything other than grip at the bedsheets, but even with shaking fingers he manages to reach for Cas, to grip his bicep, trying to convey everything he needs in that one touch.
With fumbling fingers, Dean pulls down the elastic so Cas’s cock can spring free, smacking up against his stomach. It’s bigger than he expected, not massive but definitely at least average, so
From it clatters metal, and Dean stares at the angel blade. He has no idea when or how it manifested, but it’s there, in the middle of his bedroom floor, and finally he picks it up and sets it on the nightstand on top of the tie. The beige fabric he holds in his lap, bunched up in his fists, and at least this time it isn’t covered in blood or goo or any other sign of Cas’s most recent brush with death.
It’s most of the truth: Dean had actually lingered by Cas’s bedside for over an hour, but when there’d been no sign of him stirring, Dean had finally caved to the nauseated, rumbling demands of an empty stomach. He wouldn’t be any good to Cas passed out from hunger.
“Where to now? Back to heaven? Or…wherever…”
“Anyway, that’s the easy part,” Jack said. “With four of us, it’s a lot easier to balance everything out. We’ve pulled all the…extra bits out of the universe. The story stuff God set up. It just needs a good shake, and then when we step back it’ll be good as new. But not new-new. Just…” Jack beamed. “Like it was. But better. Free will, like you taught me.”
“Yeah.” Dean chokes the word out. He searches Cas’s face. The angel seems distracted, still glancing around, this time towards the sound of bells snuffing out one by own. It’s getting almost too faint to hear. “You, uh. You down for that? Because we’re kind of running out of time.” He hesitates. “I know it’s not a great call, but it’s kind of our only-“
“That was good, right?” he asks, and he doesn’t need to see it to hear Cas’s smile.
Miracle snuffles her nose against his foot, and Dean rewards her with a piece of bacon. He’d bet Sam is a “no table scraps” kind of dog owner but screw it. Whatever makes her happy. She deserves to be happy. He forces himself not to look at the sound of wings. It knots his stomach, the sudden roiling threatening to make the eaten half of his BLT surface again. He swallows hard and puts the other half back on the plate. He waits for two familiar words. Ones he hasn’t heard in a really long time.
“And then what?”
Dean jolts up, both hands tightening on instinct, one around the weapon and the other around Cas’s grace. For a split second, he thinks that this might be another memory, Meg standing across from them, staring, incredulous. “I gave one hands-off warrant,” it says, and oh. So this is the Empty. It sounds exasperated, in the way that Meg’s voice has always captured so well. “That’s all I asked for. One angel who was absolutely, unequivocally mine.”
know that.” Weird potion incident aside, Dean is very much not into that, thank you very much. And it’s
“Yes,” he answers simply, and Dean swallows, because with eyes like that there’s no way Cas is talking about the sex.
“It’s funny, the Empty,” Billie drawls. “Can’t say I’m really a fan, even without cosmic interference. Still. You have to make nice. And Jack really is a good kid. Shame about his father.”
“Just not all-powerful,” Jack finishes. He chews on his pizza thoughtfully, and speaks with his mouth full. “Some of it can be useful. But I still want to be a kid. At least for a while.”
, I don’t want to be that to you.” Cas’s face isn’t playful anymore. It’s drawn and concerned. He picks at his eggs, scraping his fork through the remnants on the plate. “I appreciate you looking out for me, wanting to take care of me, treat me right. It is an attractive quality, and one I will admit I’m drawn to given my…my history.” He pauses, and Dean thinks about Meg in a mental hospital and Daphne with Emmanuel. Cas shakes himself, and finishes, “But I don’t want to be another responsibility for you, Dean. I don’t want to be a burden.”
He barely thinks about it when he dresses again, yanking things from his drawers at random, trying to keep his eyes on the floor instead of the back of his bedroom door, where the jacket still hangs. Cas’s blood has long since dried on it, the handprint dark against the green. Dean can’t bring himself to touch the thing, and not just for fear that his still-damp hands might ruin the mark. It’s stupid, he thinks, but he doesn’t even have a trenchcoat to hold onto this time, doesn’t know where the mixtape wound up. Cas never moved into the bunker, not really, and what little he accumulated on Earth has to be somewhere. Abandoned.
“But you’re still going to try.”
he would die for it and I…”
“Last one,” Sam echoes. “For Cas.”
“Y-yeah.” So much it hurts.
“Good,” Cas repeats. He shakes himself a little, and then looks around. “We made a mess.”
“I know.” Cas’s gaze is unflinching, and Dean takes a breath to steel himself. The cut he makes is careful, as shallow as he dares without risking having to make another pass. Cas shudders when it happens, his eyes fluttering shut, and Dean watches the grace swirl free, slowly at first as it creeps over the edge of the incision, and then faster when Dean brings his fingers to it, coaxing it out. He catches it in his palm, hot and pulsing like a beating heart, white and blue and almost too bright to look at. It’s…beautiful.
“But I think I’ll spend a bit more time on Earth for the moment.” Amara tilts her head thoughtfully, looking off into the distance. “There’s so many places I haven’t seen yet. And with the state of my powers…”
“Yes.”
“Gonna stop you right there,” Dean says, half-laughing. Yeah, still weird. “My point is, you fixed what you could. You did what you thought was right.”
Dean meets her gaze. “Then it sucks. But we chose this. What’s dead should stay dead.”
“Okay, Sherlock,” Dean laughs. “We can have bees.”
Cas and Sam return, and Dean pulls Cas close, tucking him into Dean’s side. Cas leans into him with ease, and Dean doesn’t know what he ever did without that weight. He presses a brief kiss to Cas’s temple, just because he can, and for once, Sam’s expression isn’t teasing, and he wraps an arm around Eileen’s shoulders as they walk away, heading over to chat with Jody while a series of shouts rise up from the library over Miracle trying to walk on the game board.
“I’d like that.”
“Yeah. Me too.” He smooths his hand over the page deliberately, before he accidentally tears the edges of the ancient paper.
“I wanted to say thank you.”
at him like that, like he’s never seen anything more beautiful than Dean in all his centuries of living. Like there’s never been a moment better than this one.
“Whatever you want, Cas,” Dean tells him. “It’s all good.”
He groans at the interruption, not from Miracle this time but from a knock at the bunker door. Dean lets his forehead fall against Cas’s with a light thunk, growling his displeasure, and Cas laughs, kissing him lightly again before stepping away. “Later,” he reminds Dean, and looks curiously towards the door. Even Miracle has perked her head up in interest. “Are we expecting anyone?”
, and Dean’s cock gives another anguished throb against the confines of his jeans. Cas continues, “I don’t particularly care how it happens, because I love you, and I trust you, and it would make me
Dean doesn’t know if he can put it into words. He tries anyway, though. For Cas. “You…I want to give you everything, Cas. You deserve the best. And you’re brand new as a human. Angels feel things differently, right? Food, sex, all of it.” He doesn’t want to assume again, but just because Cas could love him as an angel doesn’t negate the fact that they’re not built quite the same as humans.
“Whoa,” is all he can say when they break apart, his lips still parted, still tingling with the fact that
. Although honestly, good for Mom. He clears his throat. “She, uh. I heard through the grapevine that everyone up there is staying put?”
“You gonna make me tell you how?”
“I know,” Sam says. The corner of his mouth twitches, but Dean can’t guess what expression it wants to be. “He was my friend too.”
Dean’s cock had flagged, but those words jolt right through him, shooting him back to full mast, and he has to clear his throat in order for his words to not come out as a whine of need. “That…that sounds awesome, actually.”
Cas blinks, raising his eyebrows, but there’s nothing teasing in his smile when he murmurs, “We’ll talk about it first. Right now…” And then his hand is on Dean, dropping the belt to the floor in favor of cupping Dean’s crotch, squeezing the bulge, and Dean goes weak in the knees, fumbling backwards for something to hold onto. He manages to find the door handle and his jacket, and neither has the purchase he really needs.
Sam shrugs. “I’m not sure. But I think…maybe not going back out in the field, or at least not a lot, but we’ve got the power here to help a lot of people.” Sam gives a vague gesture towards the library around them. “Lore, magic…someone needs to be here to facilitate it.”
“He’s not an angel,” Dean says automatically, like a punch to the gut.
okay with this?” When Cas looks down at their fingers with a frown, he scrambles to add, “Being human, I mean.” He swallows guiltily, “I mean, I know…I know that your grace was a part of you, Cas, and as far as I can tell you never wanted to be human before. You always talked about it like it was messy and gross and…” He looks down. “I never wanted to be the person who took that away from you. The person who dragged you down to my level.”
“I wanted to be clear that it was me,” he says softly. “I’m still…my mom was a Kline. And I didn’t want to put JW, even though I feel like a Winchester.” He hesitates. “I met John. When we were doing our work. I saw his soul, and I could see he did love you and Sam, but…”
Cas looks hesitant. “Dean?”
“And you’re cool? With everything?”
“The…results do appear to be favorable.”
Billie ignores him. “And it is a little thrilling to break the rules. I can see why you Winchesters enjoy it so much.” She surveys him, almost disinterested. Like he’s finally not worth her notice, and she’s thrilled about it. “Mostly, I just knew that without him, the rest of this? Not really a story worth telling. For any of us. We do seem to owe him free will, after all. And I for one am not big on debts.”
So it hurts. Fuck yeah, it hurts. But Dean doesn’t even care if it takes a fleet of shrinks, he’s not going to let it win this time. He’s going to live this fucking life if it kills him.
Cas returns with the napkins, and they all sit down for the meal. Dean scoots his chair close to Cas’s, enough that he can reach out and touch him every so often, bumping their shoulders together and stealing Cas’s toppings because it’s cute when Cas glares. They’re close to done when Jack seems to register the change, and he frowns, squinting and tilting his head so much like Cas that Dean nearly nudges him again to point it out. Jack looks back and forth between them, brow furrowing deeper. “You’re…different.”
Cas drops to the edge of the bed without hesitation, and Dean sits next to him, pulling one knee up onto the mattress so he can turn towards Cas. “So. Not that that wasn’t hot,” Dean says, “because it was. But, uh. What was that?”
“Relax,” Billie says. Her arms are crossed, her position casual. “I’m not here to reap your boy.”
the benefits.
“I’m starting to get that,” Cas says. “And I need you, want you, too.” He lets his eyes fall shut, and Dean wonders if he’s about to say something profound again and is cut off by a low snore. He laughs, and goes to get Cas that coffee.
Jack nods. “We haven’t sorted everything out yet. It’s going to take time.”
Cas quirks an eyebrow at him. “Are you proposing to me?”
“What he said,” Dean manages. Even that comes out…not quite broken. But probably not whole.
Dean pulls himself into a more dignified seated position and eyes her warily. “Then why are you here?”
“Nuh-uh,” Dean says, shaking his head. “I didn’t do that for or because of you. I did it for me. For Cas.” He’s certain of it in a way he’s never really been before.
“Yeah?”
“Will do.”
Dean opens his mouth, and then closes it again. He nods, and Billie relaxes almost imperceptibly, her posture loosening into something more casual, less posed. She gestures, and Dean takes the steps forward, watching her. “So,” he says. “You’re Death again, huh?”
“Then I don’t see the problem.”
He takes another shaky step forward, towards the barn, because that seems like the thing to do. He tunes the voices out, letting out a watery laugh at a snippet of Cas’s angelic Enochian, that pure screech Dean still remembers finally solidifying into words he can understand, the first words Cas said to him topside. He lets it all fade away into the background, the mostly-empty landscapes echoing with them. He’ll ask about some of them later, but right now…
“You deserve as much,” Cas tells him. It’s sweet.
“Please.”
Dean stutters out the yes, because Cas is still fucking stroking him, still kneading at his cock, swiping his thumb over the head and rubbing roughly underneath it. Cas rumbles approvingly, bracing himself on Dean’s chest as he shifts forward, angling Dean back against him. The head catches, and so does Dean’s breath.
“I can do that.” Cas rocks his hips again, and there’s
“You are aware we have twelves years of sexual tension to make up for, correct?”
“Dean.”
He gets the eggs off the stove safely, and Cas eats them
Dean can’t stop the whine this time, and his voice shakes when he manages, “Yeah, yeah, okay, Cas. Anything you want.” He’s about ready to slide to his knees from Cas’s expression alone, and nearly does when Cas cups his cheek, the gesture so tender that Dean has to close his eyes against the tears pricking in them.
“Cas made his choice,” he says softly. “He was the only one of us writing his own book. He…what he did, he did. No one else.” It doesn’t make it hurt any less. “You’d get him out if you could.”
“Would that be too much for you?” Cas rocks his hips back, presses the head of Dean’s cock more firmly against his hole, circling it in a tease. “I need you to tell me, Dean.”
to occupy himself with. He’s always liked cars, so that’s a place to start.
Cas’s eyes, no less brilliant blue for lack of grace, turn on him. “Everything,” he says softly. “I remember everything.” He groans as he sits upright in bed, and Dean helps him wriggle until he’s scooted back enough to lean against the headboard. He lets his hands linger on Cas’s shoulder, his firm chest, just a moment longer than strictly necessary. He doesn’t want to push his luck. Not until they’ve talked. Cas lets out a grunt of discontent, scrubbing at his face. “Last time I was human, I was not functional this early without coffee.”
He stops. Cas looks deadly serious, and Dean has to ask. “Really?”
“We’re going to work on that. For example, so we’re very clear, I’m going to tell you that I would like to have at least one orgasm tonight, and I’d like to make you come too.” The words should be clinical, but they
Sam seems almost surprised to find him, judging by the “hey!” he lets out when he wanders in. Dean gives a nod of acknowledgement, passing him a burger without hassle and not even pulling a face when Sam goes to the fridge to start loading the thing with veggies. Eileen wanders in a minute after, her expression startled but pleased when she catches sight of Dean. “Morning, sleepyhead,” she signs at him, grin blatantly teasing. He flips her off good-naturedly in return, and she laughs.
Dean flips them over, so Cas is the one against the bed. It’s a heady power – as an angel, Dean couldn’t move Cas unless Cas wanted to be moved, and even as a human he’s clearly strong. Which means Cas is
“Just let me drive,” Dean says. He knows his brother, and anything Sam might be about to say, he can’t hear.
“Shh,” Cas releases his jaw in favor of running the backs of his fingers tenderly over Dean’s cheeks. “It’s alright, Dean. Can you show me?”
“Hey, hey, hey!” Dean surges forward, catching Cas by the shoulder when it looks for a moment like he might topple. He keeps his hand there, holds tight. “Easy there,” he says gently, like he’s soothing a spooked animal. He gives Cas his most winning grin. “You sure know how to make a guy feel welcome.”
there. “I know,” he says, and it’s basically nothing, but it helps.
“Yeah, yeah,” he grumbles, without any heat whatsoever. “Like you and Sam didn’t get all gooey when he got you back.”
A nervous chuckle escapes Dean without his permission. “Ah…you’re going to have to be a bit more specific than that.”
“I know.” Cas’s voice sounds like it’s dropped another octave, so low Dean can feel it in his
“Hello.”
“Yeah,” Dean sighs, a little dreamily, his hips twitching up, humping into the touch. He feels really light, kind of floaty. It’s tempting just to rut against Cas’s foot until he comes, without bothering to even take his cock out, but then the pressure disappears. Dean whines, and Cas shushes him, tugging Dean up onto the bed and laying him down against the pillows. He straddles Dean’s waist, blinking down at him curiously.
He watches them leave, hears the distant clang of the bunker doors. He forces himself to stay sitting, to finish the whole burger and let it settle. When he stands, it’s slow and deliberate, not letting himself bolt. Miracle trots by his side, her collar jingling, and she stops when Dean does, on the threshold of his bedroom. Cas has been tucked onto the left side of Dean’s bed – Cas’s side, he’s thought for a while, even if only subconsciously – and he’s turned over in his sleep, no longer on his back but curled up and facing the wall. Dean takes a careful seat on the other side of the bed, watching. He doesn’t miss the irony of the role reversal. How many times has he been the one in the bed, Cas the one watching over his sleep?
and “oh
” and “good boy,
There’s only a little resistance when he pushes the tip in, dipping it in and out so they both can get a feel for it. Cas is so hot inside, so tight Dean’s almost afraid he’s hurting him, even as his cock begs to be where his finger is. “Feel…feel alright?” he manages.
The corner of Billie’s lips quirk, like Dean’s said something funny. “Well, that depends. Planning on making any stupid, cosmic messes, Dean?”
Dean’s throat sticks. He doesn’t say anything.
It might still be stupid. Dean won’t pretend that people don’t do stupid things for love all the time, regardless of whether or not the universe is pulling the strings. Hell, Cas is a walking manual in the concept. But it’s Dean’s kind of stupid. The kind of stupid that could make him go from suicidal to laughing in a cowboy hat in no time flat, and Dean needs that. He’s gonna cling to that hope for as long as it holds out, and he’ll cross any other bridges when he comes to them.
“Want you,” Dean says without thinking. He shakes his head. “I mean. Can you…I want…” He feels like he can’t suck in enough air, his breathing shallow and loud in his ears. “Fuck yourself on me,” he says, almost too fast. “Please?”
as he’d frantically jacked off in the bathroom for days afterwards – and Dean feels seconds away from coming without even getting inside Cas. For his part, Cas snags another condom, tearing it from the strip and ripping it open with his teeth, and Dean has no idea where he learned that but it’s so fucking hot. Then Cas’s hands are squeezing, gripping him, and Dean has to screw his eyes shut and whimper as Cas turns rolling the condom over him into one of the filthiest handjobs he’s ever received. “
Cas softens, just a little, his smile evening out into something sweeter. “I have you, Dean,” he promises. “Now watch for me, please.”
Yeah, Dean’s pretty sure he’s crimson in the face. He’s definitely never had a conversation with God’s sister like this one. His and Amara’s conversations have rarely been so calm, and never so amiable. He coughs in a weak attempt to cover, but he knows he’s sounds like a sap when he admits, “Even if he didn’t deserve it, I’d probably still pick him. Always.” Add that to the list of things he needs to tell Cas every day for the rest of their lives. “So,” he says, desperate to change the subject. “If that’s all…?”
“Mostly,” Billie acknowledges. She tugs on either side of her coat, adjusting it. “Everything in the Empty is back to sleep, including the Empty itself. The power over that realm has been consolidated, taken care of. Heaven and hell just have a few bugs left to work out, but that’ll be done sooner than later. Amara and Jack will probably be down here soon, and then it’ll mostly be me.”
He cups the back of Cas’s head, tips it back just a little. His voice shakes, and he does his best to steady it, to sound apologetic and reassuring all in one. “This is probably going to hurt.”
Chuck is still on his knees. It would almost be pitiable, how pathetic he looks, but Dean is beyond giving a crap. The devastation on his face turns to hope at Dean’s approaching footfalls, maybe hoping that they won’t just leave him here, or maybe that Dean’s changed his mind about killing him. Dean doesn’t…the thought that he’s a lover, not a fighter, is still rattling in his chest, unable to settle right when it’s meant sincerely, but it’s what Cas believed. It’s what Cas believed so totally, so wholly, that Dean can’t bring himself to contradict it. Not when the anger has melted away into despair.
Jack says what Dean’s thinking. “No, I won’t. This…it’s bigger than you now. Someone has to unravel the rest of the story. Get rid of the narrative. Set it up so it all runs smoothly without one. And that’ll take me, and Amara, and Death, and the Empty. All the big players now.” He seems to settle. “It shouldn’t just be me. Real balance…it should be spread. And then, maybe…”
“God, no,” Dean says, too quickly. He blushes. “Trust me, Cas, when I propose, you’ll know.” When, not if. Because that’s happening. Dean is gonna put a ring on it, just like that song Cas loves (and he secretly does too, because like Swayze, Beyonce always gets a pass), but in the meantime… “You’re still a Winchester, Cas. You’ve more than earned it. Not that you had to earn it,” he adds sharply, “just…”
Dean doesn’t tell him that it’s really not very early at all. Instead, he says, “I can go grab a cup if you want.”
“Well, I’ll be honest,” Billie drawls. She seems very pleased with herself, in a way that only sort of pisses Dean off. “Part of it is just to be a little petty. If you’ve got the angel, the Empty doesn’t.”
And he thinks maybe Sam gets that too, because his brother gives a short nod and stands, his hand brushing briefly over the initials, lingering on Mary’s. “I’ll leave you to it.”
Dean raises his eyebrows. “Oh?” He’s feeling eloquent today, apparently.
“Gotta hear you, Cas,” he says when he pulls off for a moment, looking up at Cas through hooded eyes. “Want to hear how good I am for you, make sure I’m doing this right.”
Amara nods, looking almost regretful. “We discussed it at length. Ultimately…the course of this world was fixed. We might have freed it from that, but so far along the path…it would have been a very difficult adjustment for the souls, and for the fabric of the universe. And choosing who got to come back and who should stay…” She studied Dean, her expression careful. “Are you angry?”
Cas circles his hips, just a little. He groans again. “When I fuck you, I want to tie you down.”
Carefully, because if he’s wrong Dean honestly thinks this might crush him, Dean flips on the radio. The cassette deck cranks to life, and Robert Plant’s voice crashes like thunder around the truck’s cab, crooning, “
She doesn’t stop grinning, and Dean squirms. She takes pity on him, and her expression softens into a more natural smile. “You told him, right?”
Miracle lets out a series of irritated barks, and Dean breaks away from Cas with a groan as the dog dances over to her food bowl pointedly. Right. He does have some responsibilities. “You’re worse than Sam, you know that?” he tells her, but he stands up to oblige. “You better not be conning me,” he warns. “When’s the last time Sam fed you, huh?”
for you. You don’t think-“
“I didn’t expect to see you here,” Sam says when they all sit down to eat. “I kind of figured…”
“Shut up,” Dean mumbles roughly, because his eyes are definitely watering again at that. “Take my pants off.”
“I did get that impression,” Cas says wryly, the assbutt, and god does Dean love him. He takes another gulp of coffee and adds, “I’d like to have intercourse with you as well.” Dean chokes and splutters, and Cas continues, “As well as the other things you mentioned. That sounds agreeable.”
“It was
. Cas’s hand cups the base of Dean’s neck, not even squeezing, but Dean’s ready to drop just from the touch. “You need to get me ready for your cock.”
“You’re so beautiful,” Cas murmurs, and his thumb traces over Dean’s lips, pushing on the lower one until they part for him. “I crafted every inch of this body. Every molecule of you is made with my love. Can you feel it?”
.” Cas hauls him up for another kiss, then shoves him back to his knees. Dean doesn’t waste time; he grips Cas’s thighs and noses into his crotch, his breath puffing hot and wet against the fabric of Cas’s boxers. Cas’s cock is rising steadily, a wet spot forming at the top, and Dean sucks at the spot until Cas’s thighs are quivering against him, tense under his hands. “Good boy,” Cas groans, and Dean moans with the praise. “You feel so good.”
“It’ll come back,” Cas says. Dean glances at him, and Cas shrugs. “Most likely. Nephilim gain power as they grow. He’ll be powerful-“
Sam is the one who breaks the silence, clearing his throat and twisting a little in his seat. “So. Jack. How’re you feeling?”
“I have to.” It’s the Winchester way. “This…this is the last one. But I have to try.”
“Sure you can.”
Slowly, Cas lowers his fist and nods. Dean goes back down, taking Cas back into his mouth, working his way up and down the shaft. He can’t fit as much as he wants, but that doesn’t seem to matter; he has a fist wrapped around the base, pumping the pre-slicked rubber as he bobs his head, working his tongue with as much finesse as he can manage. He’s rewarded with Cas grasping his shoulders, hunching over him and panting out sounds of pleasure, groaning “
reference or not – it could be, he’s had Cas sit through it at least twice for movie night, because Dean fucking loves that film – before Cas is kneading his ass and Dean has to choke down just how much he likes that. Cas makes a production out of it, not showing off but
“I’m not,” Cas says, but he’s definitely grinning. He sets his hands on the table, reaching out for Dean’s. His fingers are rougher than Dean really expected of an angelic vessel, bearing the same kinds of calluses Dean has. Soldier’s hands. “If you’re concerned about having sexual relations with a man-“
Eventually, Jack says, “You can keep the dog.” Dean blinks stupidly at him, and Jack clarifies, “She didn’t belong to anyone, I mean. As far as I can tell, she was only made to…well, as that part of the story. And I thought…I mean, she deserves freedom too, right?”
Still, the words are acerbic, like they’re almost laughable, but not funny. “The first time…the first time it was cute. You were all so…unexpected. And you’d never had an angel on your shoulder before, not like this. I thought it might be exciting. Something new.” The bitterness melts, just a little. Just enough that some twisted fondness manages to seep through. “And then you broke the story. All three of you. And you gave a hell of an ending, Sam’s sacrifice and all. And I thought…I could work with this. Turn it into something even more epic. And the literary parallels…your friend becoming your enemy, trying to become
He put in a call to Rowena, because if anyone outside of the bunker would have the kind of information he needs, it would be her, but she hasn’t answered back. Dean doesn’t know if she’s dead (again?) with the demons throwing coups in hell or if she’s just busy – Jack did say they were reforming everything, after all – but it doesn’t really matter. He just knows he’s running out of time. He’s acutely aware of every hour that slips by, and while he doesn’t know how long exactly it takes four cosmic beings to rewrite the rules of the universe, how long it takes to put every angel and demon who’s ever died back to sleep, to make the Empty quiet again, he does know that odds are on sooner rather than later. He’s tense, braced for the sound of wings, because surely Jack will come back when it’s over. Surely he’ll come back, and he’ll tell Dean that it’s too late.
He’s so out of it that he doesn’t react right away to the figure in the library, doesn’t really register it until he’s halfway up the steps. He freezes, and Billie gives him a slow smile. “Hey, Dean. Long time, no see.” She’s leaning against her scythe, and somehow it looks longer and sharper and meaner than it did when Dean last picked it up and…
He doesn’t say anything else for a long while, doesn’t comment on Dean’s shoulders shaking, on the way he blinks but can’t get that one fucking tear to stay in his eye where it belongs. Finally, Dean rubs a hand over his face, and it’s not perfect, but he feels calm again, if nothing else. “You marry her,” he says, and Sam looks up again. “I’m serious. You…you marry her or don’t and have kids or don’t but whatever you do you don’t let it get away, you hear me? If it makes you happy, you hold onto that shit as tight as you can.” Don’t be like me, he doesn’t say, but he knows Sam can hear it anyway. “Eileen…she’s good people.”
“Hmm.” Dean falls silent. He raps his knuckles against the table. The familiar retort is there on his tongue, but…maybe he really is just getting old.
Sam nods, but he stays thankfully silent, and Dean keeps talking. The words won’t come out fast enough. “He made a deal. His life for Jack’s, and then the Empty could have him. But…it didn’t want him right away, I guess. It wanted to wait until Cas…until he felt ‘true happiness’ or some shit.” Dean sucks in a breath. “He summoned the Empty, Sammy. Billie was gonna kill us, and Cas…he summoned the Empty to stop her, to save me,
He doesn’t offer to help, which is fine by Dean. Something’s shifted between them. They’re not tied together anymore, that codependency they’ve known was toxic but couldn’t seem to shake, because that’s what Chuck was writing. But he’s not writing them anymore, and this is something Dean has to do on his own.
Rowena eventually does answer his call, and their conversation is short. Hell has been sorted, and she’s still on top, without all the fear and subjugation – aside from the God Squad’s helping hand in reform, she alludes to a consort who has helped a great deal with the adoration part, and Dean pointedly does not ask. She probably won’t even become a demon, the way things are now. She’s still allowed to pop topside, stretch her legs, but she admits they’ll be seeing a lot less of her. “Shame,” she says. “But, then, a ruler does need to make sacrifices. I suppose a kingdom of fawning subjects will just have to do.” It’s playful, and Dean laughs. She seems happy, and it’s good that she finally got something awesome for herself. She promises to keep in touch, and when Dean tells her about Cas – because he can, because he
With Cas’s hand on his face and Dean’s eyes closed, he thinks he can. He’s suddenly aware of his body in a way he rarely is, the pounding of his heart and the slight vibrations in his skin. He feels warm all over, and he nods.
Dean grins up at him. “And what a way to go, huh?”
“Does it hurt?” Dean asks.
Cas had seen his soul. And he’d fallen in love. It’s the only conclusion Dean can draw. It’s crazy, but it feels right. Maybe Cas hadn’t known that’s what it was –
“Yeah, absolutely.” Dean is already nodding, reaching out for Cas as he backs away, tugging the former angel to his side. He glances at Cas, “Hold tight.” Inside himself, he wraps a mental hand around the taunt string and yanks. Hard.
“No, I’m serious,” he says, in a tone that is anything but. “With her brains and your freaky moose whatever, she could really get some things done around here. Hunters of America, that kind of thing. You’d enjoy being arm candy, wouldn’t you, Sammy?”
“Of course,” Sam says when Dean can’t. “You’re always welcome with us. We’re family.”
Dean plows over him. “Nothing angelic or demonic can escape the Empty. Even awake, even with a rift open, that essence, grace, whatever, the thing that makes them not human? It can’t leave, not without someone big giving the okay. But a soul? A soul can slip in and out, no problem.”
“What?”
The angel startles, and turns. God, he…he looks just like he did just days ago. The Cas Dean had met in that barn – different trenchcoat, different tie, his hair sticking up all over the place like static – that Cas had been otherworldly. Terrifying, even, his blue eyes too-intense and piercing. But this…Cas’s eyes are still intense, still that beautiful, terrifying blue. But everything else is settled. This isn’t an angel the size of the Chrysler builder crammed into a meatsuit. It’s just Cas, his eyes widening with something that looks like horror, mouth gaping as he says, “No, this isn’t…this isn’t how this memory goes, I don’t…you aren’t supposed to-“
. And he’s
“Not really,” he says. “I mean. You said he…saved you?”
“You, uh, got your angel blade?”
It’s not the kind of life Dean ever pictured for himself, not really. Not even on his best days did he think he could ever have something like this. It doesn’t matter which application he turns in, if he goes to work for the auto shop, or a local diner, or gets the permits in order to build his own roadhouse someday, still tied to the life but not in it. It doesn’t matter, because these people in front of him? They’ve got this. Dean doesn’t have to carry it anymore.
Yeah. It’s about angels. And yeah, it’s about the Empty. The spell it describes doesn’t sound simple, and it’s only half a solution, but hey. Dean’s not one to do things by halves, and he’s not about to let a gift like this one go to waste.
“No demon deals? No…calling the queen of hell asking for a favor? No sending word up to heaven, to your son, looking to make an exception?”
Dean rubs the back of his neck, and then drops his hand to sign with his words. “Yeah, I did. Told him I loved him.”
He stops short, and
“What the hell,” he murmurs to himself. “Let’s see what’s behind door number two.”
Dean pushes him gently off his lap, groaning as he clambers out of bed, grabbing for the first piece of fabric he finds and wetting it in the sink. He cleans himself off and chucks it at Cas. It hits him with a wet thwap, and Cas squints disapprovingly at Dean, who blushes and rubs the back of his neck.
, an angel the Empty
Cas’s hand goes firm, and he grips Dean’s jaw. It doesn’t hurt, but it’s solid, unyielding, like Cas’s voice when he growls, “That’s not what I asked.”
Cas’s hand goes to his throat, gingerly feeling the bandage. He opens his eyes, blinking sleep out of them, and squints at the ceiling. “I feel…fuzzy.”
He nods, looking perfectly, blissfully happy. “Absolutely.”
“It’s heaven,” Amara admits, but she’s one of the few people Dean knows who says it like he would: not an automatic ‘of course,’ but an ‘as much as they can be.’ “Improvements or no, it will never be Earth. But they’re content.”
“Is there anything you’d like me to tell your mother?” Amara asks. “When I see her next, I mean. I’m sure I’ll be revisiting heaven before you.”
“We’re so totally having sex later,” he says. Cas laughs.
Sam doesn’t try to argue with him. He just nods, like he gets it. “And then?”
And louder than anything, ringing out over the rest, in words that are pure Enochian - and yet Dean can understand them anyway -
He rubs his eyes, blinking blearily against the sleep trying to settle into them, and turns another page.
Jack’s eyes light up as he clutches the knife to his chest. He doesn’t question Dean, just bolts for the library, and Dean snorts out a laugh. Cas gives him a look. “What? He’s a kid. I’m not gonna make a production out of it.”
okay with that?” he repeats.
new at this. I don’t have a clue what I’m doing, and I don’t want to overwhelm you…Why are you laughing?”
When he comes down from it, Cas is still on top of him, swaying a little and blinking unevenly as he stares down at the mess between them. Dean’s cock is softening in his ass, and they both wince a little as a shift has Dean slipping out. Dean grips the base of the condom on instinct, removing it and tying it off before he chucks it in the direction of the trash can. Cas’s thighs have got to be aching, but he doesn’t move, apparently frozen apart from the hand that reaches out to hover, like he wants to do more of the rubbing-his-cum-into-Dean thing he did earlier with Dean’s cheek.
He meets his own eyes in the mirror. They’re watery now, but Dean doubts Miracle will judge. He opens his mouth, and then closes it again. He works his jaw a few times, but his throat still gets caught, choking on silence. But he keeps trying, until he can get out the words.
, and Dean can’t afford to look at that because then he’ll lose it too. “I’m so sorry,” Jack says. “There’s…there has to be an order to things now.” He sounds like he’s justifying it to himself too, and badly. “It’ll take time to sort out the Empty. To put everyone back to sleep. And then we’ll erase all the spells, the prayers…everything that could interfere.”
” and “
He doesn’t, although fifty-seven hours feels like it’s probably a personal best, considering he’s not actively dying. He blinks his way slowly to consciousness, joints sore from the awkward position, and then jolts upright when he catches sight of the figure standing at the edge of the couch.
“So you’re, what, the big kahuna now?”
“What did he say?” There’s a softness in Sam’s voice that Dean suddenly understands, because he knows his kid brother like the back of his hand. Better, maybe. Somehow, Sam
“Kind of put in the hours,” he says. “Hell, technically I’ve been doing this, what, four decades, give or take?” Cas makes a soft sound of acknowledgement. “Kind of think I’ve earned a retirement.”
“It was.”
“Right.” The word cracks, and Miracle whines again. Her nose bumps Dean’s leg. He gives her another piece of bacon, because if he pets her, he knows he’ll cling too tight. “Thanks.”
“Yes,” Billie says. “I think he does.” Dean can’t see her face, but he’s pretty sure he can hear her lips twist into a smile. “He’s got a lot to learn. About himself, and about the universe.”
Dean closes his eyes, hard. It takes three seconds to shove everything down enough to open them again. Jack has that stupid fucking hand raised and everything, just like he always does, sitting next to Dean instead of across from him because the kid has his father’s sense of space. The kid has Cas’s everything.
Cas smiles. “I’d like that.”
“Fuck,” he croaks, and Cas makes a hum of agreement. Dean practically tackles him back to the bed, and he can taste Cas’s laughter when he crushes their lips together, rutting his hips down against Cas’s desperately, both slick with precum enough that there’s a gorgeous slide.
“Hey,” Dean says softly, touching Cas’s arm, and oh yeah, there’s going to be a bruise there later. “You still with me?”
Dean’s throat closes, and he has to fight a minute for air. “Jesus, Cas,” he says. “You sure know how to sweet-talk a fella, don’t ya?”
, because Cas just bounces on him harder, slams himself down against Dean, shifting until Dean’s cock hits his prostate against and then pounding into it every time, and Dean strips Cas’s cock frantically, his entire world narrowed down to this, to Cas’s pleasure and the thick throb of him in Dean’s hands, the slick heat of him and the way he feels like a vise around Dean’s cock, wrenching him higher and higher into oblivion. He squeezes Cas’s balls experimentally, and Cas sobs and comes a second time, his ass clamping down hard around Dean’s cock as he paints his chest white, and Dean sees black and
In his periphery, he can see that Cas isn’t looking at the Empty. One hand clutching the slice on his neck, the incision red and angry with the first bubbles of blood, Cas is staring at Dean like those words are benediction.
That…deflates Dean. “Yeah,” he sighs. “That’s the only way I could get you out.”
“Hey,” Dean interrupts him. He shoves his hands in his pockets on habit, then pulls them out again and deliberately squeezes Jack’s shoulder. “You’re right, she does. And you’re going to carry that a long time. Hell,
It’s really fucking cute, actually, and Dean can’t resist. He bends low, and murmurs in Cas’s ear, “I’m the one who gripped you tight and raised you from Perdition.” It’s soft, and in his own voice. Not mocking. Entirely too sappy.
Dean doesn’t linger. His skin still burns from the shower, but he doesn’t feel revived. He still feels drained. He doesn’t bother trying to shave; his hands are shaking badly enough that he’s afraid to pick up the razor. No more drinks, he reminds himself. Not yet. Not until he knows.
Dean shrugs. “Earth is where it’s happening. I’m sure Jack wants to spend time with his mom, but heaven’s gonna be heaven, no matter what he does to it. Here, we’ve got a chance to do something with our lives. And I think the kid just wants to be a part of that.”
It’s a battle he almost wins by the time he’s made it to the kitchen, scrambled eggs going with a mix of seasoning he hopes Cas will like (and PB&J in case he doesn’t, because Sam had left that helpful tip in his texts a couple hours ago). It’s a battle he loses completely the instant Cas walks into the kitchen dressed in one of Dean’s Led Zeppelin t-shirts and a pair of sweatpants, low enough on his hips that Dean can see the waistband of what he’s pretty sure are his Scooby-Doo boxers, not Cas’s white ones. Cas’s hair is sticking up like somebody’s raked their fingers through it, he has a few days’ worth of stubble across his face, and he’s holding the empty coffee mug loosely, smiling down at one of the post-it notes in his hand. Dean’s a total goner even before Cas crowds him, reaching around to put his cup on the counter behind him, patting the sticky note firmly to Dean’s chest as he leans in for a kiss. Dean shudders, his lips parting for Cas when he licks into Dean’s mouth, still tasting like coffee. The stubble doesn’t feel strange anymore, but Dean is also hit with the strongest urge to shave Cas himself, a craving for the intimacy of holding a blade so close to delicate skin, Cas trusting Dean to keep him safe. “I love you too,” Cas murmurs when he breaks the kiss, and Dean nearly whines, weak in the knees in the least dignified of ways.
. His heart is thundering in his ears, beating a thousand miles a minute, and Cas beams like a ray of freakin’ sunshine. His hands have found their way to Dean’s hair, his cheek, holding him close. “We gotta do that again,” Dean manages lamely, grinning dopily himself and blushing when Cas’s smile widens.
A couple days after Cas is up and about, Claire turns up, barging in like she owns the place and socking Dean on the arm for letting Cas die in the first place. She’s got Kaia in tow, and her girlfriend mostly spends her time alternating between making awkward small talk with Dean and giving Jack careful, suspicious looks while Claire appraises Cas in his new form. “It’s weird,” she says eventually. “You’re human now, so you should probably look more like him, but you actually look way less like my dad now.” The way she hugged Cas when she first came in, though, tells Dean that while Cas may not be her father, she’s far from indifferent to him. “I’m really glad you’re okay,” she says, and then gets into a losing battle with Dean over drinking his beer.
could see how he and Cas felt, but he’s not confident Jack has both of those in spades just yet. Not to mention, he’s pretty sure the pining vibes were overwhelming, and that doesn’t exactly translate to ‘relationship.’
And when they get back inside, Cas drops into a seat in the library and pulls out his phone to answer his texts, and while Miracle takes up her increasingly familiar spot under the table, Dean leans over Cas, one hand on his shoulder, his thumb stroking the back of Cas’s neck as he laughs at Claire’s most recent “WHERE WERE YOU, ASSHOLE??!!!?!” – complete with a couple skull and knife emojis for good measure, apparently, because apparently that’s just how Cas and Claire text – and then laughs again when Cas starts typing “dead, briefly” as his opener. “You’re just going to freak her out more,” he points out, squeezing the meat of Cas’s shoulder gently as, proving his point, a series of chimes echo as Claire’s “
“Not wrong,” Dean assures him. “Really,
done with the sacrifices. Cas was the last one. “You think it doesn’t hurt like hell? I’m the one who sent him there. I’m the one…” Fuck, he can’t say it. “I’m the one who made him happy,” he finishes, and it’s true but it sounds lame on his tongue. Miracle whines, and he scratches her behind the ears.
Dean chokes on air. “One,” he says, holding up a finger when the coughing passes, “we’re never going to talk about that. Ever.” Someone is going to have to give Jack the Talk for real eventually, and there’s a lot of parenting things Dean is willing to do, but that one is going to go to Sam or Cas. “Two-“ He doesn’t really have a two, actually, and he fumbles lamely and comes up with, “Finish your pizza. Watch some TV. Do…do kid stuff.”
“As you wish.”
Cas looks surprised, but it’s not a disappointed look. He smiles and uses the hand on Dean to draw him up high on his knees, bending down to kiss him before pulling away. “Is this how you want me?”
someone with a firm hand making him feel good, for a change. He likes feeling desirable, and likes that being a good thing for once.
“I was initiating sexual advances?” Like earlier, Cas sounds suddenly uncertain of it. “Was that wrong?”
“Don’t worry about the Empty,” Dean says. “It got you, it had you, and now it’s going to give you back.”
Dean nods, kisses and sucks at Cas’s finger, pleads with his eyes. Cas smiles.
“Congrats,” is all Dean can think to say.
Is this what Cas saw in him? Maybe. In part, at least. Dean tries to trace the timeline back; Cas hadn’t said, but Dean wonders if he can pinpoint the moment where things changed for them. The terrifying thing is, he really can’t. He thinks about Cas dying in a barn, the “I love you, I love all of you,” looking away because it was too close, too much. The time he almost said it, in Lucifer’s crypt, his face bloody and beaten, his hands still reaching out to Cas, and how he’d swallowed his tongue because it was too intimate and everything had seemed so wrong. The singlemindedness of Purgatory. Cas rebelling for him.
First, Dean sleeps. Not in his own bed; he recovers enough of his sense by the time Cas’s wound is cleaned, stitched, and bandaged to insist on putting his unconscious body there instead. They don’t exactly have angel healing mojo to work with, but Sam reassures him that Cas will be fine. He just needs to sleep it off.
“No!” Dean says hastily. He swallows, takes a gulp of orange juice, sets the glass down a little too hard. “No, you’re fine, it’s just…” He takes a minute, sorting himself out so his words make sense, and then says, “I want that, definitely, yeah. But like you said, you’re new at this.
Sam finishes combining the ingredients, just like the book instructs. The Empty is fucking massive, so in order to get him in the ballpark of Cas, it recommends using something belonging to the angel, like a tether. Dean’s pretty sure Cas still has a hold on his soul, but just in case he carefully scraped a few flakes of blood off the jacket, collecting them in a little Ziplock baggie for Sam, who shakes them into the bowl. He crushes everything to a powder, pours something dark and syrupy into the mix, and lights the candle before looking at Dean. “Ready?”
Cas stretches to set his mostly-empty coffee cup on the nightstand – giving Dean a mouthwatering view of his back and shoulder muscles flexing in the process – and then ambles over to the dresser while Dean tries not to ogle Cas in just white boxers. Oh yeah, he’s gone in
Dean scoffs. “For what?” It wasn’t like he’d done Billie any favors…basically ever.
Diana gives him the application with a grin and a wink, and Dean grins back. He even makes it to the car again before the hollow feeling slams back into his chest. He takes deep breaths, but that’s a good thing, right? Finding little moments that don’t ache? It’s a sign that things will get better. It has to be.
Eventually, he gets off his ass. He gets dressed. They need food, so he does a grocery run. It’s…it’s really fucking good actually, in a bizarre way. It doesn’t fix anything in Dean, but there’s something soothing in the methodical process of throwing shit in the cart, picking out a leash and a couple little doggie bandanas and crap for Miracle because fuck yeah he’s going to spoil her, he’s going to spoil her so damn hard so that she likes him better than Sam because that would just be hysterical. Dean has never claimed to be the dog person, has a complicated history with dogs but honestly? This could be fun.
They make it about two minutes before Sam starts, “Dean-“
“There you go,” he says, straightening up and closing the blade. He stows it back in his pocket and runs his hand over the table. “Yeah.” Looks good. Looks right.
Cas takes a second first to finish kicking off the rest of his clothes. It’s not showy, but it lets Dean stare, drinking in the lean, strong muscles of his thighs, the cut of his hips. He doesn’t have a six-pack or anything, but when Dean sets a hand on his stomach, under the softness he can feel how firm it is, and Cas’s soft cock twitches, trying valiantly to rise again.
Instead, he stops a few feet away, looking down. It feels powerful, or it should, but there’s still that hollow in Dean’s chest, and it’s an empty sort of power. He could hurt Chuck, could make him beg, grovel in the dirt, but there’s no satisfaction in that. They’re free. Whatever scraps of attention Chuck gets now, it’s more than he deserves, and Dean is done torturing. He’s done.
Fingers grip his jaw, turning him back. “Look at me,” Cas instructs, and so Dean has to, has to stare at him, angelic grace and beauty as he rides Dean’s cock like a fucking champ, fucking himself up and down on Dean’s length, clenching around him. Dean’s not going to last long, he knows it, not with how good it feels, not with Cas
“Yeah, I do,” Dean agrees. He’s not disputing that. “But with Sam and Eileen planning on taking over the home front and all, plus the apocalypse world hunters and everyone else, there’s more than enough people fighting the good fight. I’m not…I’m not saying I want to leave the community or anything,” he adds. “I’m just…ready to put down the shotgun, that’s all.” He’s got the mechanic application still, but that’s just one option. He’s been thinking; he’s not actually half bad in the kitchen, and the bunker is nice and all, but it’s no Roadhouse. It’d be a way to stay connected with the people he loves, to still be helping out that community, while not necessarily being a part of it. Doing his own thing. A thing he loves.
“That’s what I want,” Cas says, low and sweet. “You’re still going to have to teach me, Dean. We’ll be learning together.” It’s somewhere between the hard domination and Cas’s soft uncertainty, and it’s perfect. Dean nods without opening his eyes, nods eagerly because
Eventually, he caves, picking up the pile of Cas’s clothes and rooting through the pockets. Dean doesn’t know who stripped him and tucked him in in just his boxers (Dean is guessing, because the shoulder peaking out from under the blanket is just bare skin, and there’s no underwear in the clothing pile), but he’d willingly bet it was Eileen. He leaves the shoes at the foot of the bed, twisting the blue and white striped tie around his hand for a minute before setting that aside too. The dress pants and cheap suit jacket – pockets empty – and white button down get placed gingerly in Dean’s laundry basket, along with Cas’s socks, and then Dean picks up the trenchcoat.
Sam doesn’t look happy, although his eyes do soften whenever he glances back towards Eileen. He folds his arms across his chest, leaning back against the kitchen wall. “I’m not going to tell you not to do it-“
When he wings off, Dean stays staring at the table. His phone buzzes a couple times, but he ignores it. He’s thinking about sacrifices again. Cas’s last one. What he said. And what Jack said about the Empty.
“Yeah, I’ll bet she will,” Dean mutters, but without heat. He likes the witch in spite of himself. Like he liked Crowley in spite of himself. Like…like he liked Cas in spite of himself, all those years ago.
stays on his chest like a claiming. He takes a deep breath and keeps his feet tucked under his seat, even when Cas’s bare foot reaches out to brush against his slipper-covered one.
“Right,” he says, and feels incredibly stupid. “April.”
“Your powers?”
“Do you not like that?”
She’s not talking about Lucifer, and Dean knows it. “Yeah,” he croaks. “It’s a real fucking shame.”
Dean sobs as the head pops in, so tight he thinks he’s going to cry for real, so much better than it had been on his fingers. Cas is wet and he’s warm, and he holds just the head of Dean inside him, rolling his hips like he’s savoring that feeling. His head is tipped back, a guttural sound welling up, and Dean lets his eyes flick up just for a moment, taking in the scarring on Cas’s throat and the beautiful expression on his face before Cas is sliding down a little more and Dean has to look, has to be a good boy for Cas. He feels like he’s going to pass out; Cas is so
“Words, Dean,” Cas admonishes gently.
“That was…” Cas doesn’t finish the sentence, still unmoving.
have at least one on speed dial anymore.
It’s all Dean manages, because Cas’s fingers curl possessively around his belt, tugging him forward by it until there’s scant inches of space between them. Dean’s cock is definitely awake and perking up at the contact, and suddenly breathing is a little difficult, much less forming words. Cas barely has a hand on him, and Dean already feels pinned. He wouldn’t call it a bad thing. “That wouldn’t be appropriate,” Cas rumbles and
He hesitates. “I…thought you already were.”
“Yeah, well, that’s Jack for you.”
Dean’s throat clenches. He grits his teeth. “Maybe.”
Dean doesn’t miss the smacking kiss Donna lays on Jody’s cheek, or the way Jody blushes, and yeah he knew they were close but this is honestly a new one for him. Jody blushes harder and shoots him a mom look from across the room when she see him grinning at her, and Dean just grins wider and drags Cas in by the back of his shirt, letting his arm drape over his shoulder and winking at Jody while Cas gives him a vaguely exasperated look, although he pointedly doesn’t move away. Jody’s expression of surprise is brief, followed immediately by something Dean recognizes as ‘huh. Go figure,’ before Claire chucks chopsticks at him and tells them to get a room, as if she isn’t sitting so close to Kaia they’re practically sharing a chair. In retaliation, Dean makes a show of kissing Cas, PG-13 and playful, and laughs when he gets pelted with straw wrappers for his trouble. He ends up sitting next to Donna, who alternates between gushing over Cas, gushing over Jody and the girls, and chatting with him about job applications and coming out later in life and just generally shooting the shit while Cas nods along very seriously and answers Alex’s slightly inappropriate questions about being an angel and taking over Claire’s dad’s body in a way that’s mostly tactful but also – because it’s Cas – kind of not. Dean snorts into his beer, and Miracle winds her way around under the table, begging for scraps. Garth has sent Dean more than one text saying that, now that they’re done with all the apocalyptic crap, he should definitely swing by so Cas can meet his namesake. Dean’s already planning a trip to Wisconsin; he kind of wants to see Cas in the snow.
“For you.”
Amara turns at the sound of his skidding footsteps, separated from him by the war room table, and smiles. “Sorry to drop in unannounced,” she says. “You haven’t fixed the warding.”
Dean blinks. Then he stares. “Am
“What is it?” Cas sounds wary, but trusting. Always trusting.
Across the table, Cas blinks. He sits back. “I’m being too forward. I apologize. I’m new at this.”
dead bodies, Dean realizes with a jolt – and if he turns it the other way there he is, very much alive, raking leaves.
“What?”
Dean doesn’t have time to question if it’s a
He makes a noise of complaint when Dean pulls out to add more lube, and Dean shushes him by squeezing his thigh. “Gonna give you a second one, okay?”
He shadows Billie, so there’s only the bookshelf between them. He can see her through the blades, their images reflected in the edges. “So,” he hedges, his voice sharp and dangerous. “This is a social call, then?”
“It seems our problem, Dean, has always been miscommunication. I think you can agree with that?”
– he can almost hear her smirk to accompany the affectionate “about bloody time!” she shoots him. He ends the call a lot lighter than he started it.
Sam startles guiltily, and Dean plows on, eyes still down. “Jack stopped by, and it looks like things are going okay up there, but…no. He tried, but no.”
Dean recoils. He actually stumbles the three steps back, and out of the corner of his eye he sees Sam tense, ready to spring. He puts out a hand, half to steady himself and half to still his brother. It does both, and he closes his eyes and takes a breath. When he turns towards Baby again, he doesn’t give Chuck a backwards glance. Maybe Dean Winchester isn’t a killer, isn’t the monster he’s been written as his whole life. But whether Chuck dies here, or if he manages to get picked up somewhere along the road, or whatever else happens now, that’s not Dean’s concern. This is where that story ends.
“Next time,” Dean starts, and has to stop and start over when his voice breaks. “Next time I want you to fuck me but right now I need…I need…”
Dean’s so going to hate himself for this later. He really, really wants that luxury. “We don’t have the juice to pull an angel out of the Empty,” he says. “None of the players who do are going to play ball for you like that, in the name of keeping the peace. But the spell that let me in, it made a gap big enough for souls. An angel couldn’t slip through it.”
Miracle lifts her head when Dean stands, but she doesn’t rise from her place at the foot of his bed. Dean grips his sink, studying his face in the little mirror. He looks…
“See?” Dean grins at him. “It’s gonna be great.” He shoos Jack towards the war room. “Now come on, before the pizza gets cold.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Sam pulls a bitchface, and Dean laughs.
“Oh god,” is what Dean very intelligently says.
He looks so much like Cas. Asking to stay. Always…always asking to stay, and Dean was so stupid not to see it. Or to see it and to still say no. This isn’t Jack’s fault, and Dean isn’t going to blame his son for it again. It’s the easy route, the
Cas tilts his head, smirking a little, and then takes a step back, giving Dean room to breathe again. The confidence is fucking sexy on him, and considering everything they’ve been through in the last couple days, it’s really not fair.
Dean just nods. Fucking figures. He’s got actual freedom now, and the one thing he wants to do with it…
“Yes.” Jacks punctuates it with a nod. He doesn’t brighten all the way, but some of the weight leaves him. “I would like that.”
Sam’s silence is too fucking loud. Out of the corner of his eye, Dean watches his brother’s face fall, his shoulders slumping. “Oh. I thought, maybe…”
He clears his throat. “Speaking of memories…what I saw. In the Empty-“
“You like helping people,” Cas points out, but it’s not argumentative, just curious.
Miracle dances around his feet when he gets back to the bunker, and he promises her he’ll take her out next time, dangling the leash for her to bark excitedly over before he goes to put the groceries away. He makes dinner – enough for him, and enough for leftovers for Sam if he comes home tonight or Dean tomorrow if he doesn’t – and lays on his bed awhile. He even makes it halfway through filling out the application before the sheer overwhelming sense of “what the fuck even is this” hits him and he has to sit up and grip the edge of the mattress, feet planted firmly on the floor to try and ground himself. Dean knows approximately jack shit about living a normal life. He folds up the application and sets it on his dresser, then sends off two texts, one to Sam’s check-in telling him to have fun, Dean wouldn’t wait up, and one to Jody asking her how the hell to fill out a job ap when your legal status is ‘serial killer/terrorist and also dead, probably.’ Even with Lisa, working construction, he hadn’t applied for it. A friend of hers had given him the job. Hell, for all he knows, Sam might have the answer, and Dean tells himself he’ll ask once the Sam-Eileen lovefest calms down a little. It’s going to be fine.
Cas gives him a gorgeous half-smile. “I’m certainly endeavoring to learn.”
The pleasure hardens again, and Chuck glares. “And it worked. For a while. Until something…got through to him. Until he tried to put it all back, tried to
“Hmm?”
Cas shoots him another look. “I suppose we’ll see. But we have decided to communicate with each other.”
“No, I mean.” Cas takes a shuddering breath. He glances back at the barn, then back to Dean. “I want to. I want to more than anything. But the Empty-“
“I would, I swear.”
“Nothing,” Dean says. “But think about it.” He looks back at Cas, gives him a grin, a reassurance he doesn’t really mean, before meeting the Empty’s eyes. “The last time you had him, everything was out of whack, which meant that when he pissed you off, you could spit him back out again.”
Cas nods absently, bracing himself up on the chair as he adjusts his grip on the knife and bends over, one forearm on the wood as he carves into it in precise block letters – three of them, “C-A-S,” right below Sam’s two. He brushes the shavings away and straightens up, surveying the work.
It’s not really the apology Jack deserves. It’s not the “you don’t need to bring Cas back for me to love you” that he should have said a long time ago but was too far drowning in crap to really mean. It’s not the “family is family, useful or not” that Dean thinks they all need to hear. But Jack gets it, he thinks. His son gets it.
Cas had been speaking his truth when he’d said those things about Dean. Dean can’t doubt he meant it, can’t even really deny it fully because he wants so badly for it all to be true. But there is one part of Cas’s confession that Dean cannot accept.
“And…Amara?” Sam asks.
“I will,” Amara promises. She smiles. “I’ve kept you long enough, haven’t I? He’ll be waking soon.”
“You’d be trying to fuck yourself on me, but I wouldn’t let you. I’d make you take whatever I gave you.” He grunts, grinds Dean deep inside him, and Dean whimpers. “Then you’d know how I feel right now. How full, split open. How good it feels to have all of you inside me.”
Cas shakes his head. “Itches a little.”
“Batting a thousand with the memory there, Cas.”
“And you’re not stupid now?”
“And last time I saw you, you and your angel got me sent to the Empty. Not to mention your little fit with this.” Her fingers stroke up and down the weapon in her hands, and she levels a gaze at Dean that’s dark and piecing and sucks all the air out of his lungs. “But I’m willing to let bygones be bygones. We were all pawns here. So I forgive you for trying to kill me. Twice. And in return, you can stop acting like what happened here was my fault.”
The look Cas gives him is briefly unimpressed, and morphs into something smoldering that sends heat into the pit of Dean’s stomach. “I would like to take care of you, Dean. If you’ll let me.”
He keeps the bandage changed and fresh. Cas’s wound is healing pretty well, all things considered. He might have a scar when it’s all over, thin and silvery, proof that he used to be so much more than this fragile human body. Dean kind of wishes he had more scars himself, although not out of some sense of macho vanity like he might have in his younger years. The various healings and resurrections have been awesome in some respects – no permanent nerve damage means no chronic pain that a lot of hunters have by this stage in life – but he doesn’t deserve this fresh body. There’s too much weight to him, too much history.
The car is silent as they pull out onto the road. Or, nearly silent, because Baby is an old girl now and she rattles as much as she purrs, and Dean himself is getting old enough to admit that. But the three of them are silent: Dean with both hands tight on the wheel in a way he only does when he needs something to hold on to, Sam craning his neck every few second like he’s trying to be sneaky about the glances he keeps throwing to the backseat, and Jack. Dean checks the rearview mirror instead, but the angle’s wrong to get more than glimpses. A snatch of the kid’s cheekbone, a displaced lock of his hair. Dean thinks he’s looking at the floorboard, but he can’t really tell, and he can’t bring himself to really look back. Jack is…everything, now. The big G. The big J? Dean…he’s trying real hard not to think about it, because the moment he starts to, his jaw locks up so hard he can almost hear the click over the sound of the one question he needs…the one question he’s desperate to ask. The question he can’t ask, because he’s so damn terrified of the answer.
Jack gives a very serious nod. He’s also definitely sneaking Miracle bits of hamburger off the pizza, which proves he’s just as much Dean’s kid as Cas’s. “Also, before I was born, I know I reached out to Cas, and I could feel how much he loved you.”
Oh god. They’re actually going to do this, aren’t they?
. This is what he wants too.
“I mean-“ Cas shoves himself up on one elbow, gripping Dean’s shoulder and shoving gently. Dean gets the hint, shrugging out of his flannel and then his shirt, shoving them over the side of the bed. He looks down, both of them half naked, in time to watch Cas fit his hand over Dean’s shoulder, where his handprint used to be. His eyes flit to Dean’s face and then catch, and Dean’s breath settles back in his lungs as they watch each other silently. Dean’s had intimate sex before. This is something else entirely.
, and Dean is gone. He flings both hands to the bed just to hang on, because Cas is newer at this than Dean is and yet.
“Beautiful,” Cas says again, and then Dean is nearly sobbing with relief as Cas pulls his boxers down to his knees. Dean takes them the rest of the way, flinging them across the room in his haste to just be naked with Cas, already. He gasps, eyes slamming shut when Cas’s hand curls around him unexpectedly, squeezing both their cocks together, and Dean has to force himself to look down and then force himself not to come at the sight of both their erections, his straining and nearly purple at the head and Cas’s only half-hard but getting harder, pressed together in the former angel’s grip, his callouses rubbing and so,
“Well, I didn’t say that.” Another nervous laugh, and Dean grips the edge of the mattress just to keep himself from fidgeting. Dean’s never exactly had a problem being dominated in bed. It’s the safest place for it to happen, and he
“And you indicated specifically that you wanted sex to be a part of that relationship.”
and for the love of…well, for the love of Jack, actually, didn’t anyone tell the kid about his dad? Dean snorts and claps a hand on Jack’s shoulder as Jack stares down, over the railing, to where Cas is standing below. “About that,” Dean says. “Kinda did it myself. Figured it was about time, right?”
Sam’s face is pinched. Dean wonders which deal he’s thinking about, which stupid call one of them made that twisted them deeper and deeper into this mess before Jack cut the strings for good. But he’s looking at Eileen, who’s playing with Miracle’s tail while she stuffs a forkful of pancake into her mouth and oh yeah, Dean’s calling wedding bells any day now. “Okay,” Sam says. “I’m in.”
Cas nods in agreement and stretches absently, rolling his shoulders and cracking his neck, and Dean becomes all too aware of how dry his mouth is. He coughs. “I, uh, I’m going to head to the kitchen. You’re probably hungry, right? Human and all? Yeah.” He nearly trips over Miracle, walking backwards towards the door. “I put your clothes in the basket, but you can borrow some of mine. You know. Until we can get you…yeah.” He just catches Cas’s raised eyebrows before he makes it out the door. “What?” he says to Miracle’s definitely judging eyes. “He’s been human all of two hours, I’m not jumping him before he’s had a chance to settle in.”
Cas’s expression softens, and his voice is a low rumble when he murmurs, “Tell me what you want, Dean. Tell me what would make you happy.”
Cas’s hands come up, and then hesitate. Dean takes over, presses Cas’s fingers to the center of his chest. “I’m real,” he says. “Not a memory.”
and red and pulsing, drooling at the tip. Deans mouth waters, and he vaguely hears a ripping sound, blinking dumbly as Cas nudges something into his fingers. He looks down at the condom packet and understands what Cas wants him to do, taking a moment to tuck the waistband of the boxers under Cas’s balls before he tears the foil packet open, gripping Cas’s cock at the base and rolling the rubber down over his length, a familiar action in reverse. So far, so good.
.” He takes a deep breath; Dean can hear it, a slow inhale, a soft exhale. His voice gentles again. “I will. If I can. There’s…there’s a lot that needs to be put right. Not just Earth. Heaven, hell, the Empty. It all needs to be set right again, and I don’t know if I can do it on my own.”
“Then what?”
“Our bond,” she says. She spreads her hands. “I don’t really…feel it, anymore. I mean, I can understand why I did. Why I wanted you. You were the best humanity had to offer. The love I could feel at your core…when my brother absorbed me, I could see your whole story through his eyes. You have a way of making the non-human fall in love with you, Dean. And with the world, through you.”
There’s no ground beneath him, no horizon. It makes him think of Indiana Jones, the bridge that you can’t see, like walking on air. He’s pretty sure he’d feel significantly cooler with the hat and the whip, but all he’s got is his boots and his flannel and the sinking feeling with each step that maybe he’s already too late. The Empty is supposed to be made up of dreams, isn’t it? A Memorex replay, like heaven, except not just of greatest hits. Even if he manages to stumble into a set, Cas has lived for millennia. How the hell is Dean supposed to recognize the place?
“I want to,” Cas breathes. “Dean, I want to.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean grunts. “You said that already.”
Sam and Eileen actually look surprised when they get in. The food’s cleaned up, but they’ve still got a fuckton of people in the house, considering it’s usually four, tops, at any given time. The girls have shoved all the tables in the library off to the side; they’re hardly what Dean would consider the sleepover crowd, but they’ve got some old Monopoly board spread out on the floor and an impressive amount of trash talk going on. Donna’s helping Cas clean things up so Miracle doesn’t get into the leftovers, and Jody’s fielding a work call – her real job, Dean thinks, because he hasn’t heard the words ‘ghost,’ ‘vampire,’ or any other shit like that pass her lips. Sam’s first step is to hug Jody and wave a hand towards the kids when Jack looks up and beams at him, and his second step is to double up on Claire’s course of action, shoving Dean gently for not letting him know about Cas as soon as he was awake. “We were busy!” Dean protests, which isn’t a lie, and grins when Sam makes a face and announces that he doesn’t want to know. He hugs Cas tight when the ex-angel steps back into the room, pausing just long enough to give Donna one too before he turns back to Cas. Dean can’t hear what they’re saying from across the room, but he sees Sam check Cas’s wound, then squeeze his shoulder. Eileen gives Dean a shit eating grin when she catches him watching, raising her eyebrows pointedly.
Dean hesitates, and then nods, and it’s so much easier to fold to his knees on the floor in front of Cas. His legs feel awkward under him and he shuffles a little, bracing his hands carefully on Cas’s thighs until they part for him. He looks up at Cas and wets his lips. “This. I…I want this.”
When he gets his bearings, it’s not what he expects. Dean isn’t exactly sure what he’d been picturing – miles and miles of gooey black swamp, maybe? Like the stuff that took Cas? Or maybe some sort of technicolor chaos, with all the angels and demons awake. It’s neither, just flat black empty as far as the eye can see. It’s not dark, Dean realizes abruptly. There’s just…nothing.
“Good, Cas,” Dean breathes. “That’s good.” So good. Dean’s gonna do everything he can to make Cas say it again.
He hears it when Cas’s breathing evens out again, and opens his eyes. Through the white on his lashes, he can see the blue of Cas’s eyes, bright and wide and dumbstruck. His thumb comes up to Dean’s cheek again, and he rubs it against the skin, spreading his seed against it. Dean fights a groan, grinding the heel of his hand down against his cock, licking his lips without thinking and groaning again because he can taste latex and
Cas’s smile is predatory. “You want me to use you? Your cock, your orgasm, all for my pleasure?”
The Empty’s expression sours further. “And what stops me from keeping the whole package and flinging you back out into the cold?”
Cas does, and Dean kisses him, and that finally makes Cas relax, melting into a puddle as Dean loops an arm around his waist. It’s not a heated kiss, but it’s soft and passionate and Cas lets Dean lick into his mouth a little before he breaks it to rest his forehead against Cas’s. “So that’s what sex is like when you ask for what you want, huh?”
Dean’s going to die. He’s going to fucking die. He’s got to be leaving bruises on Cas’s arm but he can’t make himself let go. “Cas, please.”
“Well, for one thing, I figured you’d be a little less…enthusiastic?” At the face Cas pulls, Dean winces. “That came out wrong. Um. I just didn’t have you pegged as the take-charge type in bed, that’s all. It caught me off guard.”
He’s in the kitchen, still in his bathrobe, freshly made BLT in hand when Sam texts to let him know he got there safely, and Dean appreciates it. He’s sure Sam broke more than a few speed limits on the way, and it’d be spectacularly shitty if they survived all this crap just for a car accident to take one of them out. The rebar dream still clings to him. He’s trying not to think about it.
The pressure on his chest lets up, and Dean has to seize the base of his cock, squeezing hard, because this is pretty much the hottest thing he’s ever seen – he tries not to think about Cas, ten or so years ago, pinning Dean to a wall with righteous fury, and the way Dean’s cock had responded, the way he had
Billie shrugs. “Yes and no. I’m the story keeper. There’ll always be a need for Death. Everything ends. But Amara is still God’s sister, and Jack is still Lucifer’s son. They’re both very powerful beings. Just…not all-powerful. Not anymore.”
Cas quirks an eyebrow, head cocked. “Can I what, Dean? If you want something, you have to ask.”
“I still have enough power left to feel it. His dreams are…beautiful.” She doesn’t actually wink at Dean, but the aura of the gesture is still there. She doesn’t disappear like Billie had; instead, she takes the stairs, and Dean watches her until the bunker door clangs shut behind her. He has no idea if he’ll ever see her again, but he thinks he could be cool with it either way. The dynamics are different now. Things change, and that’s okay.
“Did he, now?” Dean is so having words with his little brother when he gets back.
“You- you’re agreeable,” Dean manages, in the least effective comeback ever. Cas smirks against the rim of his coffee, and it’s really not fair that his lips are so pink and tempting. Not to mention the fact that he’s
“I’m happy for you.”
“In your mouth?”
“Oh, just a couple,” Dean tells him, ticking them off his fingers like an asshole. “Billie. The Empty. Amara. You know, the whole God Squad.” He shrugs again. “Maybe they figured you already knew.”
She cocks her head at him, and the wave that crashes over Dean nearly drowns him. He hugs her to him, clinging, and murmurs, “Good girl.” It takes him a long time to stand up again.
Dean shudders a little, and his grip on the sink tightens. He’s spent so long denying it. It’s not just Cas, either. Dean’s known,
And then he feels it. A sort of tug that floors him, makes him grab on hard to the back of his chair for balance. Sam doesn’t stop speaking, his voice ringing with the spell, and Dean feels something sever in him, yanking backwards. He gets one last look at his body, Eileen jumping forward as it goes slack in the chair, making sure he doesn’t fall, and then he’s pulled into darkness.
“How?” is what he finally manages, looking back and forth between them like this is some kind of magic trick Dean’s conjured up for his benefit. Dean shrugs.
“Did I?” Billie chuckles. “Well then. Must be time for me to get back to work.” She shifts the scythe from hand to hand, examining it. Her eyes flick up to Dean. “See you around, Winchester.”
“It’s my fault,” Jack says, and he sounds heartbroken. Dean looks at him.
“We agreed to pursue a relationship.”
good.
“I’ve got a plan,” Dean says. “Trust me, Sammy. I’ve got it worked out.” He does, is the thing. It’s kind of a terrible plan. But it is a plan. “Look,” he says. “If things go sideways. If I can’t get Cas out or if…if he doesn’t…” A lump rises in Dean’s throat. He remembers Purgatory, and Lucifer, and Cas’s boneheaded habit of thinking he doesn’t deserve to be saved. He tries not to think about where the angel learned that from and pushes on. “You pull me back, stick me back in my body and seal the rift back up. No big deal. But if this has even a fraction of a chance of working, I gotta try.”
And Cas’s voice.
Dean swallows. “So this is kind of big, right? And like we said earlier, human bodies are kind of weird and messy and I just…I don’t want to do this and have it be weird for you. I want you to like it. And I barely know how to do that at all, much less for you when you’re…” he waves a hand over Cas again, gesturing to his newly human body.
He turns to do just that, but Cas’s hand darts out, seizing his arm. He certainly doesn’t look bleary-eyed when he stares at Dean. More like he can still see into Dean’s soul and is searching for something. “It was all real, wasn’t it? It wasn’t a dream?”
being in control. I like the thought of pinning you down, making you accept whatever I give you. Making you feel good, because you deserve to feel good, and you powerless to do anything but ask me for more.”
“Love…love you, Cas,” Dean echoes. He doesn’t have the power to do anything else. “So happy.”
He nods. “It’s a very good gift, Dean. I’m sorry it took me so long.”
what would happen,
The bells are still ringing, but they’re fading fast, less every minute, and maybe Dean should have waited to do the confession but honestly, he hadn’t been able to stop himself. He’s not wasting anymore time. “Look. I promise I will give you the full story later, but the CliffsNotes? Chuck’s human, Jack sucked up all his god power, and now the Justice League is working together to put the universe back to rights. That sound out there, that ringing? That’s them, right now, closing up shop in the Empty for good. Now, Jack couldn’t spring you because the Empty wouldn’t deal if he did, and we’ve got just enough time to sneak you out of here before whatever magic works gets shut down. But.” And here Dean swallows hard, ignoring the way Cas is gaping, questions clearly on the tip of his tongue. He presses on. “I think we can get you out, Cas. Alright? It…it’s kind of a longshot, but it’s pretty much the only one, otherwise I wouldn’t suggest it.”
“Yeah, I capiche.” It’s mostly a grumble, but that’s not Billie’s fault. He’s grateful to her, more than she could ever know. Mostly because Dean doesn’t plan on telling her.
“Grand entrance, Cas?”
“You make me so happy,” Cas whispers. His gaze doesn’t waver from Dean’s. “I love you so much.”
“Okay!” Sam holds up his hands in surrender. “So, tell me how it works.”
“Yes.”
Cas is. Cas strokes just two fingers over the tent, like he doesn’t get how obscene that is, like it’s fucking fascinating to watch the fabric stretch tighter as Dean’s cock responses with
Dean is asleep when Sam half-crashes into his room, but for once he really doesn’t mind being woken. He’d stared at the ceiling for a long time when they got back, and when he had managed to get some shuteye, his dreams had been one long, unfunny string of pies in the face and weird vamp-mimes and rebar through the chest. It still hurts a little, a deep ache inside him, caught somewhere between that empty hole of the other side of the mattress, the one he instinctively curls away from, and the thought that maybe this is it. No more hunting. No more blaze of glory. Just…a life. Sam’s face is lit by the glow of his phone, and his eyes are that huge, desperate disbelief of a man in love. His mouth opens, and then closes, and he gestures with the phone helplessly.
route, but Dean is letting go of anger.
“Meaning?”
He closes another dead-end, dry-as-fuck textbook when the words start to blur together, his eyes watering not from any display of emotion this time, but just because he’s been staring for hours and he’s brain dead. He growls to himself, a sound that makes Miracle whine, tail tucked between her legs as she stands with him, slinking after Dean as he skulks down the hall. He gives her an apology pat, ruffling her fur before pointedly leaving her outside the bunker showers, turning the water as hot as he can stand and just scrubbing until his skin is red and raw, letting the steam fill his lungs. The water drips down out of his hair and across his forehead, into his eyes, and Dean squeezes them shut and rubs at them. He can feel the stubble across his cheeks, turning into a proper scruff. When was the last time he shaved? He can’t even remember.
“What about condoms?”
“Honestly?” Dean says. “I don’t really know.”
pressing the digit in deeper, rubbing the pad of it against Dean’s tongue, and Dean closes his eyes and sucks hard for a moment before pulling off with a pop. He shuffles forward a little, taking a moment to grimace and adjust himself in his jeans, giving in enough to pop the button and tug down the zip, relieving some of the pressure before he takes Cas’s cock in hand again, pulling it away from his stomach. The first lick to the rubber has him pulling a face – it’s not nasty, but not great – and then melting when Cas starts petting at his hair and face again. “Whenever you’re ready, Dean. Show me how good you can be for me.”
He looks at Cas, and when he speaks, it’s too quiet for anyone else in the loud room to hear. But Dean’s right next to Cas’s ear, and Cas hears it just fine. “I’m thinking beach vacation. Toes in the sand. What do you say?”
That is. Huh. That is something Dean is not going to examine too closely,
“Well, you won’t be on your own,” Sam says. He’s so earnest too, the big moose. “You have us.”
“No.” Chuck is actually snarling, but on his knees it looks more like a wounded dog than a real threat. “No, he did that. I just…gave my story a push. Kept the Leviathans in it. And I let him stay too, just because, if nothing else, it was nice to see him hurting.” Dean flinches, but Chuck keeps going. “I won’t deny he made an interesting sideplot, but the
and Metatron’s
“Cas.” Dean stops him, because the doubt in Cas’s voice is like a fucking knife. Carefully, deliberately, he says, “I,
They’ve got all the basic ingredients they need, and some of the more exotic ones too. The rest, well. Dean has his sources. Rowena still isn’t answering her phone but he gets a text message for an address and a promise that it isn’t hexed like some of her other caches are. It’s not too long a drive, and Baby could use the exercise. He even lets Miracle ride in the front seat, which she loves, sticking her head out the passenger-side window, mouth open, panting into the wind. Dean feels it catching on his elbow, propped out the driver-side window, and lets it whisk through his hair. In the best way, he thinks this might be pretty damn close to flying.
wants to punish, and it’s just going to go well for you? You just said-“
It’s not sexy and passionate like before. It’s chaste, but so full of love and affection that Dean thinks he might actually break down crying from this one. He doesn’t, but his eyes do feel a little wet when they separate. He blinks fast, just in case.
– but even the trenchcoat pockets are relatively empty. He only finds three things, Cas’s mostly-empty wallet, his cellphone, and a set of car keys. Dean tries to picture the car – a pickup truck, he thinks, because Cas seems to favor them when he has the option, the only exception being that crappy Lincoln Continental Cas loved so much. A flash of retroactive guilt runs through him; he’s pretty sure Cas abandoned it during the Lucifer versus Amara fiasco a couple years back. Should Dean have looked for it, knowing how much it meant to Cas?
It earns Dean a tiny squint of confusion, a wrinkle in Cas’s forehead that he cherishes, before Cas shakes it off, touching his throat and the bandage there again. “I’m human?”
He swears as the kibble, still pouring, spills over the sides of the bowl and onto his foot, scrambling to sweep it up while Miracle takes full advantage of his mistake. Behind him, Cas clarifies, “That’s not what I meant. I just…” He sighs. “You’re a caretaker, Dean. It’s what you do.”
Dean pauses halfway through pouring the kibble to give Cas his best ‘wtf’ look. “Uh, I know that, Cas. Like, I really,
Dean nods.
“Can I take a look?”
“I love him,” Dean says to himself in the mirror. “I love Cas.” And then he shatters.
Well. Ever since. And he’s gotta know.
way on this one. Cas spreads the pictures out, smiling and blushing faintly. He taps his fingers on the mixtape gently, affectionately, and casts a look over his shoulder. “I think I get it now.”
“Meaning, what, exactly?” Eileen is the one who says it, both eyebrows raised significantly.
“Yeah?” he presses. He takes a step forward, uncurling his fist a little, grace still out like an offering. “You really think that’ll keep? The one angel that even God couldn’t keep down, even when he was the only big game in town? Especially now that he knows someone’s waiting for him on the other side?” He flashes his biggest bullshit smile, the one that says ‘I’m adorable and you ain’t got shit.’ “Grace is quiet. Let it sleep. You get the angel; we get the human. Everyone’s happy.”
“Tight,” Dean breathes. “So…so good, Cas, you feel…”
“I love you too.” Cas’s eyelids flutter to half-mast, and Dean chuckles, nudging him.
They make it to the bunker without another word between them. Dean doesn’t touch the radio, and Sam doesn’t dare.
“Hang…hang on,” he pants. His cock lets out a throb of protest as Cas lets go, taking a step back, and Dean fights for breath. He feels completely disheveled, despite the fact that Cas hasn’t even really
Cas smiles at him, and yeah, that’s probably never going to stop making Dean melt. He bends back over the table and scratches in the four lines that make up the “W,” right in the space below his name, and then digs in the point firmly into a period, as if for emphasis. Dean can’t help himself; he leans over Cas, covering the hand with the knife, and when Cas relinquishes it he turns the period into a little, slightly-lopsided heart. Cheesy, but it feels appropriate.
(He does. He hasn’t…he can’t delete Cas’s number. He called it once, but the phone must have been in Cas’s pocket when he got taken, because there’s not so much as a voicemail recording on the other end of the line.)
“Looks good,” Dean says, chucking the used bandages into the garbage. “Just make sure to keep it washed, and it should be fine. Don’t let it soak, though. And don’t pick at it.” The last part comes out a little exasperated, as Cas’s fingers do just that.
“We don’t,” Dean agrees. He still can’t blame Jack. The kid is trying to fix the fucking universe, and for that he needs everyone on his side, Empty included. “But this spell isn’t for yanking an angel out. It’s for getting in.”
The eyes don’t stop. Dean glowers, gritting his teeth a little as he adjusts his pants and wills them to stop feeling so tight.
“Good,” Dean says. For Eileen’s sake, he doesn’t tease Sam by talking with a mouthful of food. “No, that’s great. Definitely, do that.”
“No,” Dean says, and means it.
Dean frowns and turns to face him, leaving Miracle to lick the excess kibble off the floor. “So?”
“Wait,” Dean says, and she stops. He hesitates. “So, that’s it? You’re all done with…whatever?”
Sam accepts the answer, and he doesn’t call Dean on calling it ‘Cas’s room.’ Instead, he says, “Eileen and I were planning on heading out again, soon as you were up. Bobby put out a call to us; apparently, there’s a couple hunters who’re still kind of shaken up about the whole ‘God disappeared the planet’ thing. We figured we’d go, get everyone who needs it back on their feet again. Make sure everyone knows we’re here if they need it. No more big, cosmic events.”
He looks old, he thinks. Older than he really anticipated being. But it also looks good on him; Dean’s always had boyish charm, a face that people called pretty (not all of them kindly, John included), but somehow, without his noticing, that’s shifted. He’s still kind of pretty, he thinks, but there’s a weight to his features. Maturity is maybe the wrong word, but as much as Dean has always resisted the idea of getting old, he’s aged well. He’s not ancient, or anything, but still.
“And you’re…okay with that?” Sam sounds skeptical as he stands, taking a seat opposite Dean. Miracle’s head drops down onto her paws again, her tail still whacking Dean’s leg.
“I know,” Cas soothes him. “I understand.”
feel so much. We grow, we change. And I don’t think I’ve wanted to be an angel for a very long time. I don’t owe anything to heaven, and I wanted to fall. But you needed me.”
“Yeah. He’d have made a halfway decent God, too. Which is probably why he’s giving the whole thing up, more or less.” Billie actually sounds impressed, maybe even a little fond. Jack has a way of doing that to people. For the devil’s son, he grew on you.
There’s a lot left unsaid on the last word, and Dean swallows hard. He doesn’t make Jack say it, and he doesn’t ask if there was enough. If, in spite of everything, his father somehow made it upstairs. It’s not an answer he wants to hear either way. “You did good, kid,” is what he finally says, and claps Jack on the back as he passes, guiding him out with him into the war room. “Now, let’s eat.”
“Let me guess,” Sam says, still infuriatingly soft. “He thought he couldn’t have you? That you didn’t feel the same?”
,” Cas takes another step away, as if evading hands Dean doesn’t dare use to reach for him. “The amount of power it would take to free me-“
He pulls back, enough to see Cas’s face, but he doesn’t let go. He waits until Cas nods, and then says it. “I love you. And yeah I mean that in the family way, but not just like that, I mean it in every way. I want to spend the rest of my life making you happy, and not just because I’m there and you’re there and we both
“Shut up a minute, okay?” He hopes the words don’t sound harsh, and Cas doesn’t recoil from them. Dean covers Cas’s hand with his own and squeezes. “This is something I gotta say.”
Cas shakes his head, rolling his eyes, and addresses Jack. “Well, all that aside, Dean and I were not in a relationship. We were both very, very stupid.” In his deadpan, it’s hilarious, and Dean laughs, even though Jack just tilts his head and cracks a smile.
She wrings her hands together. “I’m sort of…testing a theory. Something my brother told me.”
“So you let your
Miracle had been camped out by the sofa when he woke up, and she refuses to leave Dean’s side when he settles himself in the kitchen, although the latter might have something to do with the ground beef he slips her. He whistles as he makes breakfast burgers, which are really just regular burgers but who cares. He’s in a good mood, relatively speaking, and the vocal cheer covers up the twisting in Dean’s gut, because yeah, there’s always sacrifices with a win like this one. He remembers all his old hopes and fears about Cas being human. He has no idea what Cas is going to say when he wakes up.
“Dean, you don’t-“
. Dean’s hard enough in his jeans to pound nails. The zip digs into his boxer-covered cock until Dean thinks it might break or burst, but he doesn’t dare adjust himself. “I…I want…” His throat tightens, and tears prick in the corner of his eyes again. He’s not good with words. “I…”
She quirked an eyebrow. “Oh, for this and that. Being a good sport and all. Doing something stupid so I didn’t have to.” She examines her nails, a deliberate gesture. “Don’t get me wrong, I’m still all for natural order. But it is somewhat…satisfying to have a score settled, even if you’re not the one who pulls the strings.”
Chuck’s face slips. Disappointment, sharp and edged. He looks like he wants to tell Dean to go screw himself – probably he does – but Chuck is a writer, shitty or not, and if there’s one thing a writer likes to do, it’s to talk about the story. He can’t seem to help himself.
The Empty rocks back on its heels. “Fine.” It snatches the grace from Dean’s hand, presses it to its chest. “Take the shell and go. Before I change my mind.”
Dean gives half a shrug, biting into his burger with a groan. Two days without eating – longer without a proper meal – really is way too long, even if he was sleeping for most of it. He swallows and answers, “I swung by Cas’s room when I got up. He’s still out, but he looks okay. Color’s good. I figured I had time to eat.”
Dean stares at him, floored, as beside him, Cas chokes on a bite of his pizza. “Why, uh-“ Dean coughs himself, thumping Cas’s back to help him a little. He clears his throat. “What makes you say that?” Yeah, he’s pretty sure anyone with common sense and
“I’ve heard.” Amara hesitates. She looks good, Dean thinks absently. Not actually terrifying. Sort of a lady realtor, PTA mom sort of vibe with the pantsuit thing. But he doesn’t feel that pull towards her he used to, that fucked up bond from the Mark of Cain that overwrote his actual feelings with twisted ones he couldn’t control, and that’s nothing but a relief.
life, all of, what, two days later?
“No.” Dean shakes his head frantically. Not with the condom, not if he can’t- “On me. On my face. Want you to mark me up, make me yours.”
Then he
“Right.” Jack lurches over the threshold like a TV vampire who’s been invited in. “I just wasn’t sure, with everything done, and Cas-“
the PB&J, so Dean’s going to call that a win. Even if Cas licking jelly from his fingers and moaning more than strictly necessary for what are really pretty basic breakfast foods is doing things to him that he told himself it wouldn’t. The sticky note with his scrawled
“Is this a test or a threat?”
(It’s been more than two days, probably, but time feels surreal right now and Dean doesn’t have the energy to work out the math.)
“You tell me.”
Cas’s eyes are huge. His lips are parted. He seems surprised, hopeful, a million little emotions that Dean didn’t think he really could feel, and Dean drops his hand, wraps it around the back of Cas’s neck instead, pulls him close, anchors himself there. His thumb can reach Cas’s cheek, so he strokes it. Presses their foreheads together for a beat. “You didn’t give me a chance,” he breathes. “You said you wanted something you couldn’t have, and then you laid all that shit out for me to see. How much I meant to you,
“Good boy.”
Dean would agree with pretty much anything Cas said right now, but through the fog clouding his thoughts with want, he manages to give an honest nod.
The words slot into Dean’s chest, like something he hadn’t known he was missing. His own voice is rough, although not with sleep, when he responds. “’Morning, sunshine. How you feeling?”
. Was. Was an angel.” Dean coughs a little. He covers it with the whiskey. No more, he swears to himself. Last call.
“Kind of figured someone would have told you,” he says. “Aren’t you supposed to be omnipotent?”
“Good,” Jack manages. He bobs his head a little, almost distracted. No. Guilty. “She’s, uh. She’s good. Happy. In heaven. She really likes the changes we made. She said it was nice before, but it’s better now.”
They’re quiet a moment longer, and then: “So what now?”
happy if you decided for us.”
Cas shakes his head, his smile small but fond. Dean smacks a kiss to his cheek and fishes Cas’s phone out of his pocket, just because he can, before dialing the number for pizza.
“I want to get you worked up first,” Dean breathes. “I want you hard, all the way, before I pull out your cock, and when I do, I don’t want to put it in my mouth right away. I want to make you want it, show you I can do it right first.”
as Dean takes him as deep as he can, wincing when the head of Cas’s cock hits the back of his throat and he gags, pulling off for a moment before he dives back in.
Dean rubs his nose against Cas’s cheek, tracing down a series of light kisses along his neck. Cas shivers when Dean kisses his pulse point, and Cas’s fingers tangle in his hair, anchoring him there, so Dean sucks a hickey for good measure, sucking and biting at the skin until it well up nice and dark. “Mine,” he murmurs. “You’re mine, Cas, and everyone’s gonna know about it.”
and Naomi’s
He looks so small, so fragile with the white gauze around his neck, tucked under Dean’s sheets. So painfully human. Dean stares at him a long while, watches Cas’s chest rise and fall with each breath, and then passes out on the sofa in the Dean Cave. He’s exhausted enough from the spell – not to mention running basically on empty in the days leading up to it – that he’s pretty sure he could sleep for a week.
Amara shrugs. “I’m done. Everything’s sorted. Jack is with his mother, but I expect he’ll be back soon. My nephew is an interesting child.” Her voice is fond. “I’ve enjoyed getting to know him.”
it over? Chuck’s gone, but that doesn’t mean the nasty just disappears. He settles for an echo: “it’s okay.” It’s okay. If he says it enough times…
Sam books it, and Dean turns over onto his back again. He hesitates, and then reaches for his own phone. It’s lit up with notifications – Donna and Jody and Garth and the rest reaching out, personal messages and massive group texts, chains of “we’re okay, it’s okay” and “is it over?” He has one from Eileen too, although he’s willing to bet he’s the afterthought, and he doesn’t even mind. The message from Charlie just reads “thank you,” and Dean knows she doesn’t really like them like the old Charlie had, so Stevie must be okay too. He tries to think about what to say to them all.
Dean sits up, and that if nothing else gets Cas to move back a little to accommodate, gaze snapping up to Dean’s. “It was good, right?” Dean asks carefully. It’s really not an exaggeration to say that that was the best sex of his life, but if Cas didn’t like it-
As he sits down, his gaze catches on something, and his hands still halfway through opening the volume he’s picked out. There’s a book in the middle of the aisle Billie had walked down, splayed open on the floor like it had fallen from the shelf spine-down. Dean glances at Miracle. “No. No, that…” Billie doesn’t like him. It can’t be that easy.
Sam and Jack are almost to the car when Dean turns back. It’s not so much a conscious decision as the fact that one moment, his feet are pointed towards Baby, towards the road away from this middle-of-nowhere they’ve landed themselves in, and the next moment they’re faltering, and Dean is turning towards the lake again. He doesn’t look at Sam, who’s shepherding Jack into the car like the helicopter parent he loves to be, or the kid himself, who understandably seems a little dazed. He strides back, fast enough to not lose his nerve, because it’s like everything inside him has been locked up ever since-
“’S good.” He stretches out a hand, and Cas takes the hint, leaning down to kiss Dean, parting his lips so Dean can lick into his mouth. His soft, bare cock rubs against Dean’s still-clothed and very much hard one, and that’s good too, a nice bit of friction on his neglected erection. “Can I fuck you?” he mumbles, and feels Cas smile against his mouth.
“Yours,” Cas agrees easily. His nails scratch lightly against Dean’s scalp, the gesture soft but possessive. “Let me see you, Dean.”
Jack nods. “I have to go now,” he says quietly. “But I’ll be back. If…if you still want me.”
“Right.” Sam doesn’t look entirely convinced. Dean wraps his hand around the glass and lets it sit there.
“I’m sorry,” she says. “I was so…so jealous, so consumed-“
“Good.” Billie nods, apparently satisfied. She turns to go.
” It’s never been this easy. Cas makes it easy. Dean swallows hard. “Can you…”
“Congrats, kid,” Dean teases. “You’ve got about a million parents, and two of them finally got their heads out of their asses and got together.”
Dean meets Cas’s eyes, confused, and Cas is smiling. “Dean, I was
“I was in the Empty. You saved me.”
“I want…” Dean clears his throat. He feels like he’s shaking apart at the seams, that it’s only Cas’s hand holding him together. “I want to suck you.”
Dean grits his teeth. “Last time I saw you, you were hell-bent on killing me.”
“You’re fine.” Dean gets a last look at it just to be sure, not because it lets him cup Cas’s neck, swiping his thumb over the line of Cas’s throat, feeling the way his Adam’s apple bobs when he swallows.
“You’ve got to be kidding me.”
“Why did you bring him back?” is what he asks. It’s quiet. Chuck can hear him, he knows, and his voice is rough like he’s swallowed glass, but he gets the words out soft enough that Sam, standing back by the car, watching him, won’t be able to hear it. “If he really was so…so ‘fuck you’ to your shitty story this whole time, why did you keep bringing him back?”
“Whatever you want, man.”
“He’s not here,” Dean says, finally, just to get Sam to
And then it falls. Dean feels Cas’s hands release him almost in slow motion, the angel taking a step back as his brow pinches together. “Dean,” he says, like an apology. There’s longing in his eyes, achingly familiar, and it makes Dean’s heart stutter and his chest squeeze tight. “I can’t go with you.”
“You’ll tell me about them?”
Dean gets out of bed, yanking on his dead-guy bathrobe and sliding into slippers. The soft, now-familiar fabric molds to his form as he ventures out into the hallway, wrapping him up. Holding him together. He checks his phone again. No other messages, but alerts for news apps are popping up. No one seems to be saying anything about the missing time, but then, they never really do about the supernatural. It’s just weather reports and tabloid shit and a recipe blog Dean follows posting some grilled chicken thing that he’s probably going to put on his list to try, if only because Sam is still on his case about the red meat.
He answers some texts: Jody has some advice on filling out that job application and Donna’s sent some kind of rainbow hug sticker gif thing (without prompting, and Dean is going to have words with Sam if this is about his outing. He’s going to tell people. They know him, they know Cas, and if what he hopes is going to happen now happens, they’re going to find out eventually. And he’ll be damned if Sam beats him to the punch. These are his words, his story to tell). Claire has a question about some obscure branch of shapeshifter lore, with a thinly veiled ‘because Cas isn’t answering his texts’ as an explanation. Garth has sent a picture of the kids with the caption ‘Gertie’s first fang!’ The baby werewolf is beaming at the camera to show off the gap in her smile, holding said tooth out in her palm, little Sam and Cas in the playpen behind her. Dean sends Jody a thank you for the help, shoots an answering gif – some blob thing squeezing a heart – to Donna, tells Claire that Cas is fine and will answer her texts later (although he also answers the shapeshifter question, because there’s no sense waiting when he remembers the lore), and cheekily asks Garth how they handle kids and the tooth fairy in his household. It doesn’t take up nearly as much time as it should, and then Dean is reduced to sitting back against the headboard, scrolling idly through his phone, turning his head to check on Cas every thirty seconds. It’s a little pathetic, but Dean thinks he’s entitled.
weird to him that there are people out there who, having read the
“I think,” Dean interrupts again, “that if there’s even a shot of saving Cas, I need to take it. And I think Cas would get that.” He sighs, pulling the pan off the stove and letting it hiss and cool as the last pancake gets flipped onto a plate. “I get it, okay?” he says, shoving one plate towards Sammy and dropping the other in front of Eileen. “It’s big magic, and that kind of thing usually has a price tag. But I’ve checked it backwards and forwards, and yeah, there’s a risk, but I don’t have to give up my life or my soul or any shit like that on my end.”
Touching Cas is honestly kind of awesome, Dean decides. And he doesn’t even mean that in the sexy way, although he is definitely looking forward to that later. But really, he’s always been pretty tactile in a way that he’s had to tamp down on hard, because that was the kind of Real Man that John Winchester was (which meant that was the kind of Real Man that Dean had to be), and now he can just…indulge himself. After Cas has done the dishes – against Dean’s protests – and Miracle has eaten, they take her out to do her business and get a little exercise, and while she’s running around in the patch of trees behind the bunker Dean just wraps an arm around Cas’s waist and lets it sit there, and Cas leans into his side in return. The sun is starting to set again, casting everything in that orange-blue twilight glow, and it frames Cas like a painting, lighting up his eyes in a way that makes Dean’s breath catch all over again.
.” Dean cards his fingers through Cas’s hair. It’s messy now, sticking up in every direction just like it used to. “And, uh. Just to say it again, not during sex…I love you.”
Dean’s throat tightens a little at that. “Good.”
Dean remembers enough of his dreams to know that they don’t always make sense. Sure, some are straightforward, like watching a movie, but others defy the basic rules of reality. Settings blend together, things appear and disappear. No consistent logic. Which is probably why, memory or not, this dream isn’t just one thing. It’s a barn at night that he recognizes, a park bench in a field of snow that he doesn’t. If he turns his head one way there’s a stretching warehouse floor littered with dead bodies –
and I can’t…”
A jingle starts from down the hallway, and Cas frowns as Dean laughs. “By the way,” he tells the ex-angel, whose narrowed eyes fix on the doorway as Miracle finally decides to make a reappearance from wherever she’s been hiding, “we totally got a dog.”
“Bees?”
“So good,” Cas tells him. “You were so good for me.” He nudges his foot towards Dean’s crotch, brushing his toes over the bulge carefully. “Should we take care of this now?”
He finds the truck without difficulty. There’s a parking ticket on it, but that’s fine. They’ll take care of that later. He climbs in and shuts the door, taking a moment to just breathe. It smells like Cas. Then he starts the engine and brings it home. The bunker’s main garage is packed, but there’s still room in an adjacent lot, and Dean parks it there before he goes through the vehicle, looking for Cas’s stuff. There’s a small hunter’s kit tucked under one of the seats – fake IDs, a couple weapons, some basic magic ingredients, the kind of excess stuff when angel mojo or Cas’s blade weren’t enough to do a job – but it’s what’s in the glove compartment that brings Dean up short. There’s personal items, trinkets he thinks Cas must have picked up from different people and places, but mostly there’s photographs. On top of the stack is a creased one of him and Cas in Dodge City, and it’s enough to make Dean’s breath catch in his throat. There’s more, just a handful, of Cas and Jack and Sam and other friends and family, but Dean’s in more of them than he isn’t, and in most of them he’s looking at Cas like a sunflower towards the sun. Or vice versa. No wonder Sam knew. Hell, no wonder that’s been the go-to joke for every villain (and a couple allies) they’ve ever faced. It was written all over their faces.
“You said they’re almost done sealing up the Empty?” Eileen asks. “This is your only chance to get him back, right?”
“I sure as hell hope not,” Dean says. Not for a long, long time.
Cas confirms it for him. “That is not inaccurate.”
“Hey,” he says, because it seems appropriate, because he wants to hear the response.
“Tell me what you want to do to me, Dean.”
Jacks nods. “All the souls where they belong. I made sure Kevin and the others made it specifically.”
They’re in the bunker kitchen, not just Dean and Sam but Eileen too. Miracle seems taken with her, not as much as she is with Dean, but enough that she’s lying at Eileen’s feet while Dean flips pancakes. Without his hands free to sign – and he’s surprised at how much of it has come back, the little Dean learned to try and communicate in those early years, after Mom died the first time, when speaking aloud had been too hard – Dean makes sure to turn when he talks, so Eileen can get in on this too. Her lips are pursed as she watches him, her gaze flickering to Sam every so often, but she doesn’t say anything, aloud or with her hands, just yet.
The card catalogue’s findings on angels and demons had long since proven pretty robust – nothing, comparatively, to a lot of the resources they have on any other given thing that goes bump in the night, but pretty extensive considering the pretty serious lack of angels and demons on earth prior to that first not-pocalypse. The handful kicking around back then must have been plenty, or maybe Dean’s just been a little spoiled, relatively speaking, for cosmic company. He knows now that was just Chuck’s storytelling in action, but after a decade of open hellgates and fallen angels, it’s almost weird that Dean
. And that’s something worthy of aspiring too.” He sighs, and tilts his head back again, staring at the ceiling. “Yes, humanity is messy and it can be somewhat gross, but it’s also beautiful. You…
“Nope.” Jack shook it. “When all this is over, I think she’ll probably end up like me. On Earth. But we’ve got a ways to go. I want to clean up heaven, fix it for the angels. And the people. Knock down all the doors. Make it more real. It won’t be like life down here, but it’ll be better, at least.”
Jack’s fingers are on Mary’s initials, the “MW” right above where he’s carved his own name. “She deserves better than heaven,” he says softly. “And I-“
The rebar dream is tempting. He used to think he deserved that. It’s not really a blaze of glory or anything, but still a hunter’s death. He wonders if Sammy would really let him go this time. Jack would probably insist. Natural order, and all.
Dean is actually speechless. He opens his mouth and then closes it again, and it takes a few tries before he can get any sort of sound to come out of it. “Uh…”
“Yeah, I’m cool,” Dean says. He turns a page, pointedly trying not to notice the way his brother’s looking around. He fails miserably.
“I’ll put him to sleep,” the Empty grits out, but Dean can see it. The flinch. He’s winning.
going to carry that a long time.” Forgiveness isn’t easy, and Dean has no doubts that he’ll get mad again, that some days it’ll be hard to look at his son. “But eventually you gotta let it go. She’s got Amara up there, right?” At Jack’s surprised look, he shrugs, “She stopped by. Kind of mentioned it.”
“Love you,” Dean breathes. Cas’s cock twitches at the words, through the boxers, the fabric damn and clinging, giving Dean the whole fucking outline of him, giving Cas more friction with every shift. Dean mouths desperately at the base, at Cas’s balls, and manages to gasp out, “Want you so fucking much.”
“He loves me too.”
He’s never done this, but he’s seen porn, and he knows what he likes done to him. “Want to kiss it. Get it wet with my tongue. See if it jumps when I trace the veins, when I tongue under the head.” Cas shivers, his grip tightening. Emboldened, Dean presses, “Then I’d take you in my mouth. Just the tip first, to make sure I can take it. Wanna make it good for you. I don’t know if I can deep throat but we’re gonna try. Work my way down nice and slow, see how much I can take. If any doesn’t fit I’ll use my hand, jack you in time with the way I suck you down, until you’re ready to come because it feels so good.” He can do that. He can absolutely do that.
Cas interrupts that train of thought, “Dean and I are a couple now.”
“Exactly.” Sam settles back in his chair. When Dean looks at him, he thinks it might be the first time, at least in a long time, that he’s seen Sam for who he is. Not his kid brother. Not a responsibility. A leader in his own right, and a confident one at that.
he’s known, that he’s not just into women. And he’s buried it deep, because that was the safest option. And the last few years, he’s started to think
But Billie also doesn’t like the Empty, apparently. And if there’s any time to play games, it’s now, before all the new rules are set in stone. Dean gets up, crossing to the book, and picks it up gingerly, half expecting it to burn. It doesn’t. It’s just a book, one from their own library, but the page it’s open to…
Dean gets it. He can’t remember the last time he got tested for something like that and he doubts Cas ever has. They’re both human now. Better safe than sorry. He fishes a strip out and shuts the nightstand while Cas checks dates, because of course he does, and then drops them next to the lube. When he turns back, he traces the arc of Dean’s cheekbone with his thumb. “And when I’m ready,” he murmurs, “do you want me to come?”
He leans forward, only to be stopped by Cas’s hand in his hair, tugging him back. He tilts his head up, confused, and Cas pets through his hair affectionately. “I need you to tell me, first.”
Miracle nearly ruins the first impression by leaping onto the bed with a force that almost spills Cas’s coffee; he manages to keep the mug upright, thus saving the relationship as she comes nosing over, sniffing him curiously. Cas pets her, and gradually breaks into a smile again. “What’s her name?”
the problem, exactly? That Dean feels out of his element? That this is
“I don’t know,” Dean admits. His fingers curl around the edges of the book.
“I guess that’s all I can really ask for at this point, huh?” It’s weird, not having a say. It’s been years since Dean felt like he wasn’t fighting against cosmic forces, things bigger than him. His family, his friends, they’re something to mourn. But they’re also a reminder about what he has left.
“Gotta get you an anti-possession tattoo.” Dean’s mostly thinking aloud. He brushes his thumb over Cas’s hipbone. “Here, maybe. Let me suck on it when I go down on you.” Because he meant it, he’s going to get so good at sucking cock. He’s always been told he had cock-sucking lips. Cas is going to reap
Dean can’t help the snort, because isn’t that the Winchester curse? He doesn’t check to see if Sam is giving him a dirty look for it. After a moment, Sam says, “So, you’re God now, I guess. Can you…I mean, you can fix everything, right? Put it back the way it was?”
He isn’t sure what happens on the other end. All he sees is the storybook collapsing, Cas’s memories folding in on themselves as suddenly they’re both being pulled, the last lingering bells ringing in Dean’s ears as he gasps and slams back into his body, one arm still wrapped firmly around Cas’s limp form. Sam and Eileen both jump to their feet, but whatever either of them might be about to say is cut off as Cas collapses to the floor, eyes rolling up in his head, blood still bubbling from the slice in his throat. Dean stares down, eyes wide, mouth open, the exhaustion of the spell keeping him rooted, frozen, as shouting and scrambling ensue in a frantic motion to cover the wound. Behind them all, the spell bowl gives one last, lingering crackle, and then sputters out and dies.
. But he knows Dean’s going to say it anyway.
“Miracle,” Dean tells him, and snorts at the eyebrow Cas pulls. “It’s a long story.” One he’s not going to tell right now, thank you very much. He gets out of bed and gestures around. “So, uh, I brought your car back. Figured you’d want your stuff.”
“Is this okay?”
Dean’s in the library when Sam clangs back into the bunker. He’s is practically radiating happiness, even all the way across the room, and it’s…it’s a lot, so Dean keeps his eyes on the lore book spread out in front of him. The knuckles of his free hand press against the table, inches away from the initials carved deep into the wood. He swipes his thumb over the empty space and looks up only when Sam bounds to a stop, a frown furrowing his brother’s brow as he takes in the scene. Dean doesn’t want to guess which part of it has surprised him. Miracle’s tail thumps against the floor, and Sam bends down to pet her almost on instinct.
Personal space has always been an issue for them, first a legitimate issue because Cas didn’t recognize social cues and Dean was a mess of masculine hyper-performance, and then not so much an issue as just a quirk of their dynamic, a tendency to lean too close, to reach out for each other on instinct. Claire had mentioned once, in a text, that angels didn’t just hear directed prayers, but could react to general longing. Maybe that was a part of it; Cas could feel how badly Dean wanted him close, reacting subconsciously, placing himself there, within reach, on the off chance that Dean wanted to take.
“We are,” Cas agrees.
“Oh.”
don’t need an angel, Cas. We just needed you. I needed you. And it doesn’t matter to me if you can’t use your mojo or heal people or whatever. You’re family. You matter. You.”
Jack nods. He doesn’t quite smile, but there is a warmness to his eyes. “I will fix it,” he says, and that’s a promise. “As soon as I can, I’ll put everything right again.”
“It’s all good, Cas,” Dean manages. “We got there in the end.”
There really isn’t that much table between them, anyway, Dean decides. He braces himself up on it, and Cas leans in when he does, letting out a soft, pleased sound when Dean’s fingers curl into the hair at the nape of his neck and-
When he swallows, Sam’s still looking at him. Dean swallows again, with more purpose. “I’m not…not saying it doesn’t suck. I know…I mean, Cas didn’t have a lot of friends but-“
“It’s me.”
“I…don’t know,” Jack says. “I feel…everything. The whole world…it’s like it’s in me. Or…I’m in it.” When Dean caves and sneaks a proper look, Jack is staring at his hands, turning them over in his lap, fingers splayed. He looks up, and Dean fights the urge to jolt his eyes away. Jack’s are intense, but in a way that seems almost distant.
“Right.” Dean takes a couple careful steps forward, setting his haul down on the table. He doesn’t really want it between him and Amara, but he’s completely at a loss and he feels safer with his hands free. “We’ve, uh. Been kind of busy.”
“Leave it,” he says softly, glancing towards Dean. “I’d like to remember. But yes. I’m human now.”
“For me?”
– like hundreds upon thousands of bells, going quiet one by one. It gets a little louder as he goes, so he thinks he might be on the right track. There’s no sign of the tear between worlds, but Dean can still feel his connection to his body, a thin string gradually pulling tighter as he walks. Sam will snap him back out if he tugs on it, so Dean lets it alone. He’s not going to touch it until he’s good and ready.
“Yeah.” It’s an exhale more than a word. It leaves Dean’s lungs and hangs there. “I mean…maybe he knew. But maybe he thought…” Dean shakes his head. “I don’t know what he thought. I know we’ve been…I mean, he’s an
It dawns on Cas before Dean even has to say it. “But a human could.”
“Hmm,” Cas hums. He rubs his fingers against his throat, over the bandage, his forehead pinching.
,” he says again, and it’s a prayer, it’s a plea, he’s begging and he doesn’t even care because Cas will take care of him, Dean knows he will, and he just
“You think I’m being stupid?” he’d asked Eileen on his way out. She’s smiled and shaken her head.
“I wanted to do more,” Jack admitted. “Mary. My mom. But the universe needs to be balanced. That many souls coming back would…”
“If you make a ‘pizza man’ joke I swear to god-“
“So this is it?” Dean asks. “Clean slate?”
not wrong.” A nervous chuckle escapes him, and he runs his fingers back through his hair. “Just…not what I was expecting?”
Dean snorts. “Well…”
But when Dean gets to his bedroom, he finds his door shut rather abruptly behind him, and he definitely doesn’t squeak in surprise at finding himself suddenly boxed in against it. He can feel the jacket with Cas’s handprint at his back, but that’s much less important than the intensity of Cas’s expression, his eyes bright and sly and his lips quirked into a smile as he stares Dean down. “It is an important question,” Cas says, and how the fuck does his voice get even deeper? Seriously, Dean’s heard Jimmy Novak speak, and the man wasn’t exactly a chain-smoker, so what the hell does Cas have going on with those vocal cords? The depth of it hits in primal parts of Dean’s brain as Cas tilts his head, eyebrows raised. “We did say ‘later,’ after all.”
Cas stares at the floor. His tongue darts out, wetting his lips. “Historically I’m…used to following my partner’s lead. I just…earlier, you seemed to respond well to my advances, and I wanted…” He huffs out a breath, sounding frustrated. “When the stakes are high, I’m not comfortable being a leader. But I
Well, Cas had been a little more specific than Dean, but he’s not about to argue that point, because it’s true. “Well, yeah, but-“
After a second, he pulls his pocketknife out and flicks it open, offering it handle first towards Cas. “You should, uh. Put your name on too.”
“What am I, chopped liver?” he asks, projecting gruffness on purpose, and Jack jumps back, mouth gaping like he’s actually speechless.
Cas says, and then, “I’m going to kiss you now,” and he
He glances up at Cas to check how’s he’s doing, and the ex-angel looks a little dazed himself. His hand has fallen onto his thigh but when Dean nuzzles it, he rubs his fingers against Dean’s cheek, and then lets out a startled sound when Dean sucks the thumb into his mouth, wrapping his lips tight around it. Cas lets out a shaky “
When he does, he gives a short whistle, and Miracle trots at his heels without difficulty. Dean doesn’t know if she’s been trained to, or if she’d follow him anyway, but it makes the empty feel a little less hollow.
In his haste to get back to Cas, he nearly trips himself on the steps into the war room, and then nearly trips again when he screeches to a halt, crushing the bundle of Cas’s things to his chest as his mouth falls open. It’s a deer-in-headlights look, but Dean thinks he’s allowed in this instance.
He can’t get Cas in deep enough to swallow properly, to let him feel it, but he makes up for it by adjusting the angle, letting his mouth get sloppy with spit as the head of Cas’s cock rubs against his soft palate, Cas grunting with every stroke. His balls are drawing up tight, and Dean feels it when his cock hardens that slightest bit more, pulling off as Cas pushes at his shoulders, both of them fumbling to get the condom off in time, Cas stripping his cock as Dean babbles, “Gonna practice so hard, Cas, gonna keep trying until I can take the whole fucking thing. You’d like that, right? Fucking my throat until I choke on it, make me gag on your cock, knowing I love it, knowing I’d do anything to make you come,” and Cas chants his name with increasing urgency until he gasps and groans and spills, stripes of white coating Dean’s cheeks, painting over his lips and eyelashes. Dean closes his eyes in time, but he still shivers with pleasure at the feeling, the knowledge that Cas is marking him up in the most primal way possible.
“No,” Cas says softly, and it’s so sweet he’s going to give Dean cavities. “Not for a very long time, at least.”
would make a new choice. And I would have to write around him every damned time. So no,
Dean doesn’t really know what to do with that information, so he leaves it. Instead, he asks, “So she’s not in your head anymore?”
. But not about Cas. He couldn’t let himself think like that about Cas. His best friend. The angel who couldn’t return his feelings because he wasn’t built that way. Except apparently, he could. And he did. Because Dean had reached in and broken him, just a little. Just enough for him to love.
As if he’s reading Dean’s mind, the kid’s face falls. He fidgets with his hands in his lap. “I’m sorry, Dean.”
“So good,” Cas groans. “Keep going.”
“And…?” It’s clearly leading, and she clearly knows the answer. That’s alright. Dean doesn’t mind saying it.
“I love him, Sammy.” Not past tense, not this. Somehow, it comes out easy. Dean’s halfway to crying, like he swore he wouldn’t, but the words still come out easy. “I fucking…I love him so much it fucking
“-I just want you to be sure, I mean really sure, about this. Cas
“’Course,” he says gruffly. “Just ‘cause you can visit your mom in heaven whenever you want doesn’t make you any less of a Winchester, you hear me? You don’t get out of family movie night that easy.”
I didn’t make him like that. That was all
reason he was worth keeping around was because he deserved to feel it for screwing up. Aside from you and Sam,
“In this case, that would be accurate.”
“If you’d like.”
He steps through and blinks.
Nothing except him. When he looks down at his hands, or at least the projection of his hands, they’re lit faintly. It’s not some kind of fairy dust glow or anything, but it’s definitely like he’s been illuminated. He runs his hands down the front of his shirt, over the back of his jeans, checking pockets, making sure he’s all here. It’s just a projection, sure, but he’s not only still dressed, he’s still carrying all the shit he always carries. His fingers linger on the shape of his pocketknife for just a moment. He remembers picking it up off the floor where Cas dropped it, how easily Cas had slipped it from his pocket in order to paint a sigil in his own blood because Dean’s heart was too twisted in his chest to do anything. He hadn’t needed to check, had just grabbed it. Like he knew where it would be. Like he remembered seeing Dean put it there and had filed it away in his list of Cas’s Facts About Dean Winchester: a good man, a being of love, a brother, a son, a self-loathing mess. The man who broke an angel, cherished his car, and kept his pocketknife in the same damn pocket every time. Cas remembers eons of time. How much of his memory is dedicated to Dean?
“And you claimed him,” Dean says. “Fair and square.” He holds up his fist, grace shining through the gaps in his fingers. “Here he is.” He shakes it towards the Empty. An offering. “Everything angel, you get. But the rest? He’s mine.”
It had been some angel – Hester, maybe? After all these years, most of them have blurred together in his mind – who had said it was the touch of Dean in hell that had broken Cas. Fuck, even Chuck had said that saving Dean was supposed to be Cas’s one goal, that after that he was supposed to fall back in line and
“No,” he says, and Jack looks up. Dean shakes his head. “Cas told me about the deal, and that’s not on you, okay? Any one of us would have done the same.” Which was the Winchester problem, but Dean doesn’t say that. He’s done…
Jack blinks. “Oh.”
sure as hell hadn’t, and Dean had been familiar with human emotion from the get-go – but Dean can feel, deep down, that it’s true. And he thinks maybe it’s true for him too. He doesn’t really remember Cas saving him. But when he thinks of hell, amongst all the dark moments, all the pain, there is a flash. A settling. Like his soul, twisted and shredded and broken almost beyond repair, had seen something and said, “Oh. You.”
Dean chokes on his eggs. “Cas-“
He gathers Cas’s stuff back up and heads in the direction of his room. Cas is still asleep, but Dean can sort of see what Amara meant; he’s shifting now, like the pull of sleep is losing its hold on him. Dean carefully arranges the pile of pictures, trinkets, and the mixtape on his dresser, then sits back down on the bed, pulling his legs up so he can move closer to Cas, watching the smoothness of sleep wrinkle as Cas’s eyelids squint open a fraction, a mostly-incoherent “wha?” spilling from his lax lips.
“Okay, great.” Sam shoots a look to Eileen, who nods and stands with him. He claps a hand on Dean’s shoulder. “We’ll see you when we get back, then. Tell Cas hey from us.”
Jack nods. “Are you going to have sex now?”
He swallows hard, and looks so damn ashamed that if Dean wasn’t already white-knuckling it, he might reach out and cuff the kid around the shoulder just to show him it’s not his fault. His eyes fucking
,” Dean breathes, and yeah, his voice breaks a little. Because it figures, doesn’t it? Castiel, the angel who rebelled, who has so many memories, is relieving the last twelve years and nothing else. His time on Earth. His time with Dean.
“Sam Winchester, Man of Letters.”
But Cas still doesn’t wake up.
“I-I…”
“What’s the risk?” Sam asks, which is fair, because in shit like this, there’s always a risk, a catch, some cosmic screw-you that fucks them over because hey, that’s just how Chuck liked it.
He puts his phone in his pocket. His footsteps are too loud on the stone floor. There’s no other sound in the bunker. Why should there be? Sam’s gone, and every room Dean passes is perfectly empty. No one in the war room. No one in the library. He circles past the kitchen twice, even. He has no idea what he’s looking for.
He’s still standing over the table, staring down at it. He’s got one hand in Miracle’s fur, petting her while her tail thumps against his leg. The other hand is on the table, out of sight, and the knife is off to the side. Dean approaches cautiously. “Jack? You good?”
“But we don’t,” Sam confirms.
“But you brought everyone back?”
Dean’s stomach clenches. “Sure,” he manages, almost casual.
