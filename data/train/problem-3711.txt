Alastair nods his head and Dean feels himself being breached. There’s no lube and the spit from the man rimming him isn’t enough. He screams until it peters out into sobs that shake his entire body in its bonds and he’s pretty sure he’s hyperventilating as he cries out, “Cas,” in the most broken-sounding voice he’s heard in his life, but he can’t bring himself to give a damn.
Dean just sits there, silently thinking over everything Castiel’s said as he sips his tea.
“No,” Dean says, pushing up from the cushions, panic rising, “No, get off. Please get off.” The weight lifts off of him immediately and Dean feels like he can breathe again.
Castiel nods. “They have a cupboard behind the bar stocked with snacks and juices and ointments for after scenes. It’s the one saving grace of this place.”
The look on his face tells Dean that Castiel already knows the answer to that. “Feels so good. Please let me come.”
“There are lists online where you can fill out your hard limits, soft limits, and things you’re curious to try.” Castiel pulls up a website and passes the laptop to Dean.
“It’s only ten.” But Dean’s yawning too, trying and failing to stifle it as Castiel rises from the couch.
So instead, he drowns under wave after wave of self-pity for days, barely getting out of bed, eating only when he feels he’s about to pass out, and even then only the few stale snacks he has in the pantry.
Dean shrugs, looking at his feet as they shuffle on the tiled floor of the kitchen instead of at Castiel. He sees Castiel’s socked feet shift closer and then he’s surrounded by the warmth of his arms, pulling him tightly against his chest. He melts when Castiel presses a kiss to his forehead.
“I watched you dance on stage and…” Castiel turns away, blushing.
“Babe, come to bed already.”
When Alastair withdraws Dean coughs and come falls from his lips onto the dark leather of the bench. He groans but puts up no resistance as he’s manhandled and forced to sit up, every muscle in his body protesting, and then Alastair scoops up the come-spit mixture Dean coughed up and uses it to jerk Dean off. He shifts to change the settings of the dildo until it’s on the highest speed, the loud whirring of the machine filling Dean’s ears and drowning out the noise of the club and the crowd.
“You’re shivering. I’ll run you a bath.” Castiel slips off his shoes and rushes to the bathroom.
He’s satisfied when he sees himself in the mirror again, all scars, bruises, and marks completely covered. Out of sight, out of mind.
“I think it’s because I wasn’t in the right mental state. We’ve been less…intimate lately. I was worried it’s because you don’t want to be with me anymore.”
They all laugh and Dean has a sudden wave of sadness wash over him, souring his mood a little. It’s been so long since he’s had a night like this, just hanging out with friends, drinking and having a good time. He misses it.
“You’ll make do.” Dean breathes in the scent of Castiel as he presses a trail of kisses along the back of his neck. He smells like lavender and soap and Dean wants to soak as much of it in while he can.
Dean spends the rest of the day in bed, wrapped in layers of borrowed clothes under borrowed blankets trying to banish Alastair from his mind. But by the time the sun is setting Dean feels worse than he did before.
Castiel shakes his head.
“I think it’s cool.”
“Fine, but the clinic is our first stop tomorrow. Priorities go: clinic, groceries, then clothes.” Dean holds up a finger for each one.
“Fuck.” Screw dinner, Dean thinks, he wants Castiel to tie him up and drive him crazy right now. “Fuck, Cas, if you keep talking like that I’m gonna come in my pants.”
“Can I—plea—Castiel.”
DEAN:
Dean smiles, watching as Castiel seems to get lost in the story, his eyes losing focus as if he’s gone from the restaurant to the bookstore.
“It’s all right,” Alastair whispers, “Good little whores get rewards.”
DEAN:
Even after the shower, Dean is still riding the high of his first scene with Castiel.
“Seriously, though? I can’t jack off unless I get permission from you first?”
“He’s the most important thing in my life,” Dean agrees.
“Yeah,” Dean shrugs, “just the usual assholes who think just because they see me dancing and stripping on stage they can just do whatever they want. It’s no big deal.”
He wipes his hands on his apron and turns a bright smile towards the customer. “Mornin’! What can I get ya?”
He can feel himself slide into Castiel’s throat and he can barely handle the tightness of it as Castiel swallows around him. Dean cries out in pleasure, his orgasm already threateningly close. He’s never been denied release like this. He’s frustrated, but he wants more at the same time. He would let Castiel continue this delicious torture for the rest of his life.
“Sure, but we still need to finish our talk.”
“Of course you do. There is always a choice, Dean.”
CAS: I’m at a conference right now.
Once both cuffs are secured, Castiel clips them together and Dean gives an experimental tug as he brings his hands back to his lap, just to feel the reassurance of the restraints holding him.
It’s doubtful he’s going to be able to sleep, but he’s got nothing better to do, so he carefully lies on his stomach on top of the covers. He grabs his phone from the side table and scrolls through different apps, checks his e-mail, opens all the apps again, then opens Netflix. He flips through the shows he has on his list, unable to settle on what to watch, and ends up falling asleep without picking anything, phone still in his hands.
Dean can’t believe he’s forgotten about the Impala for so long, stranded in the parking lot outside the club for days. Anything could have happened by now. Someone could’ve slashed the tires, or broken all the windows, painted graffiti across the body. Alastair could have taken the car if he had even bothered to pick up Dean’s belongings.
One movie blends into another and soon Dean is waking up hours later on the couch with a kink in his neck from falling asleep in a weird position. He rolls his shoulders as he sits up, his joints popping as he stretches.
“Would you like to get some lunch with me?”
“I already told you to stop spending money on me. The last thing I want is for you to think for even a second that I’m with you for any other reason than that I love you.”
Anger flares through Dean, mostly anger at himself, but he uses it to his advantage and turns it towards Alastair. He just wants to leave with Castiel and never come back to this disgusting place. He waves his hand, shooing Alastair, but a strong hand grasps his wrist and tugs him from Castiel’s hold.
He surveys his naked body in the mirror, inspecting the bruises and finger-shaped marks dug into his hips, hissing in pain when he prods at a particularly tender spot. The bruises have gotten worse, turning from pink and red to a deep purple.
Considering it now, the only thing that’s truly Dean’s is the stacks and stacks of movies, so many that they don’t all fit on his bookcase room divider. There are neat piles on the floor by the shelf and even more stored in the TV console and underneath his coffee table. He has an equal amount of romance and action movies, plenty of horror and a few westerns, all slowly collected throughout the years.
“I hope I’m not being too forward seeing as we’ve just met, but would you like to get a cup of coffee with me? There’s a diner about a block away. It has less-than-average coffee, but it’s open 24 hours.”
Dean opens his mouth to say he was being stupid, apologize, and hang up, but instead he sobs so loud and forceful his entire body shakes with it.
Dean may not have gotten off on the right foot with Meg, but he was starting to see why she should be worried about Castiel. It still doesn’t make him like her.
“Of course. I want to show my new boyfriend off to all my friends.”
“I’m the one who should be sorry,” Castiel says as he shucks off his thin, grey jacket. Dean takes it from him and hangs it in the closet, wondering where the usual trench coat is tonight. “I’m sorry,” Castiel says again, “I should have texted to let you know I was going to be late.”
Dean wants to amend his earlier statement:
And then all movement stops. Castiel pulls his mouth and hands away leaving Dean writhing on the bed, wrinkling the covers as he moves and making the rope rub roughly against him, only adding to the overpowering sensations assaulting him.
“It’s a complicated way of saying I’m in charge of dealing with a lot of insufferable people to make sure the company looks good.”
“Sensitivity to light and noise?”
“What? It takes time to look this good.” He gestures to his body.
“More than once,” Castiel continues, “my mom had to come to the shop to get me for dinner because I’d get so lost in whatever book I was reading.”
They had come to a silent agreement not to discuss the previous night, but Castiel winces when he runs a hand through his hair during lunch and Dean frowns at him. “You sure you don’t need to go to the hospital?”
DEAN: Call me when you get a chance? I just wanna hear your voice.
It annoys Dean a little that Castiel hadn’t been reduced to a puddle of post-orgasm bliss, but that just means he has to try harder to completely wreck Castiel next time. That’s okay; Dean likes a challenge.
Castiel only nods and watches Dean walk away, hoping he’ll hear from him again.
“I know we haven’t discussed collars at all, but I just thought…” Castiel looks so uncertain and Dean frowns, realizing he’s just sat staring at the collar without saying anything.
?” Alastair tugs again and Dean cries out, struggling in the tight grip.
Dean nearly scoffs. Is this really Castiel’s idea of punishment? It certainly isn’t what Dean had in mind.
CAS: I miss you, too. It’s hard to sleep without you next to me.
But Dean had understood the words the first time, just not the implications of them. Does he truly mean Dean can choose whatever he wants? Dean wonders if Castiel would let him fuck him. He can only imagine what it would feel like to be inside Castiel. And nope, Dean has to stop that train of thought at the station or he’s not going to get what he really wants.
Dean’s vision goes white and he’s sure he passes out for a moment. When he comes back to himself he’s choking on his words, trying and failing to beg his Master to stop. It isn’t the first time Dean’s felt no pleasure during a scene, but it usually doesn’t bother him; his Master’s pleasure matters more than his own. It is, however, the first time he’s been afraid.
“No.”
Dean follows and watches as Castiel digs through the cupboard. He grabs a box of rice and takes it over to the corner where he tips the box upside down, dumping a pile of rice on the tiles.
He slides the silky material up his legs and over his ass, running his palm along the cool fabric and taking a moment to admire himself in the mirror before grabbing his phone and snapping a dozen pictures showcasing the panties.
“It would make things a whole lot easier if you did.”
“What?”
The voice that comes from behind Dean is like ice water shocking his system. He goes rigid in Castiel’s grip. He doesn’t want to turn around, isn’t ready to go through with probably the hardest part of this night. But he does turn, glad that Castiel keeps his arms wrapped around him. It feels safe, like maybe he can face Alastair. With Cas. His boyfriend.
Castiel wants to collar him.
“You’re married?!” Dean stares at the ring Charlie flashes him, simple and elegant.
Dean’s breath catches in his throat as tears burn tracks down his cheeks. His torn shirt is cut away from his body and his pants follow, pushed down to his ankles where his shoes and socks are slipped off. He tries kicking out, to at least get a good hit in to the guy’s face, but fingers dig into his skin painfully, holding him still until all his clothes are stripped away.
Alastair is saying something, but Dean’s pretty sure it’s just more derogatory phrases aimed to make him feel like shit, so he tunes everything out and focuses on trying to relax his body instead. He gives in to it, to his Master’s harsh treatment of his body, to the shame washing through him at being so on display. He lets his mind go blank, something that has taken years of practice. It lets him find at least some enjoyment from these scenes with Alastair.
Castiel stifles a yawn. “Is there coffee?”
A flash of red passes the front window, catching Dean’s eye and making his stomach do a flip. The bell above the door jingles and Charlie steps inside, looking around the café until her gaze lands on Dean and she approaches his table with a broad smile.
Would Castiel punish him over such a minor infraction? Dean supposes he did break a rule, so punishment is surely in store for him. But would Castiel do it here, now? They may be alone in the changing rooms, but they’re still in public. His heartbeat thuds wildly against his chest as Castiel leans towards him.
“Impala.”
Dean thinks that Castiel could say literally anything with that voice of his, could fucking read the ingredients off the box of disgusting high-fibre cereal in the cupboard and Dean would still find it incredibly sexy.
Dean keens and throws his head back.
Dean’s already ignored the red flag of Castiel’s possessiveness. He had rationalized that it’s not the same as Alastair, that Castiel would never do the things Alastair did, but Dean begins patching up the cracks in his carefully built walls anyway.
Castiel nods. “Most clubs have a one or two drink allowance and after that you get an ‘x’ on your hand to show you’re not permitted to scene. Some clubs have a zero alcohol tolerance and have a juice bar instead.”
Dean tilts his head, looking up at Castiel as he whispers, “Say it again.”
“Mhmm, well that better be true. I won’t let him be hurt like that again.”
Dean is surprised to find Castiel nodding along as he speaks; listening intently to his every word like what he has to say is immensely interesting, even leaning a bit forward in his seat, resting his arms on the table. Dean isn’t used to this level of conversation, but it’s a pleasant change.
But Dean doesn’t want this gentleness. He clenches around Castiel’s single finger. “More,” he says into the blankets, “Please, more. I can take it.”
“Great, thank you so much, you won’t regret it.”
Castiel checks the tightness periodically as he works, making sure Dean is still comfortable and that the rope doesn’t bite into his skin anywhere. By the time Castiel moves behind him the final time to tie off the rest of the rope Dean is hard and his breathing is shallow.
“What do you need me to do?”
Dean just nods, his cheek rubbing against the soft sheets on the bed. He sighs when the lotion is applied, freezing cold compared to his burning skin, but so welcome as Dean melts into a puddle in Castiel’s lap as he gently rubs in the lotion in slow circles.
After walking around outside in the cold for over an hour both Dean and Castiel are shivering, even with the heat on full blast in the shelter of the car. So on the way home, Castiel stops at a little coffee shop and orders two hot chocolates to go.
“Dean, you have me. I’m not going anywhere, all right? Why would you think any differently?”
He looks up from his book to the laptop Castiel is waving in the air. A laptop that certainly isn’t Castiel’s; that monster requires two hands.
“Wait,” Dean calls, and grabs his wrist. Castiel turns around and Dean uses the movement to push him up against the tiny green hatchback parked next to the Impala. Castiel opens his mouth to say something, but Dean presses his mouth to Castiel’s and swallows his words.
He grunts when Castiel’s full weight collapses on top of him. He rolls until they’re lying down on the couch, tucked close together in the small space.
Castiel strokes him firmly and Dean bucks into the grip. And then Castiel’s grip is gone, instead running his fingertips lightly along the underside of Dean’s throbbing erection.
“Don’t think about it, don’t think about it, don’t think about,” Dean chants to himself, his voice bouncing off the close walls of the shower.
Castiel tows Dean past all the shiny luxury-brand cars of the other tenants to where the Impala is parked, right next to Castiel’s spot. The garbage bag they’d taped over the broken passenger window is gone and in its place is a new pane of glass. Dean whips around and Castiel is holding a key out to him.
“Look what I got today,” Castiel calls, holding up a sleek laptop as he enters the living room where Dean is perched in the armchair reading.
It’s the most intimate position Dean’s ever been in—during a scene or otherwise—but it feels right and it doesn’t take long for both of them to reach their peak.
“Fuck yes!” Castiel wept at the new angle Dean’s dick was pounding his prostate. Dean growled as he continued fucking into the other man as hard as he could. Castiel’s ass was stretching and burning but every time he thought the pain was too much, Dean would slam into that sweet spot, pain and pleasure flooding Castiel’s body with dopamine. Castiel realized they had both been moaning uncontrollably as Dean hammered into him, each thrust more pugnacious than the last.
"Let's say he's straight... what if I could change that?" Cas arched his brow in deep thought waiting for Charlie to consider the possibility.
"What can I get you, sweetie?" Charlie smiled as he sat down at the bar stool.
“Have you ever felt the touch of… anyone besides yourself at all?” Castiel blushed.
Dean looked confused. “Huh?”
“That’s right. Tell me you’re way too hot for me.” Dean looked puzzled but was honestly so aroused that his body just went with it. He said what Castiel wanted him to say, almost as if someone else had taken over.
“Everyone’s long gone now. Why don’t I just come over there…” Castiel straightened quickly.
"Hello?" Cas answered in a casual tone.
“Well then, Father… how would you like it?” Castiel stood stunned which gave Dean the okay to continue.
"Whoa, Cas. If you're wanting me to fuck you you're gonna have to take it easy." Dean cupped Castiel's cheek in his hand.
“Fine, if you won’t show me I’ll just stream my phone to the TV and see for myself!” Castiel sighed and rolled his eyes as Dean stared at his screen intently.
“Fuck yes… please more, Dean.” Castiel sounded so pathetic but he was too aroused to care.
"He's here, I gotta go." Cas almost squealed.
"When we first hung out and you asked me if I wanted some of your pie... was this what you were referring to?" Dean giggled, tracing his fingers over Castiel's nipples. Cas laughed and shook his head.
“I love you.” They coincidentally whispered at the same time which brought their lips together like magnets. They both seemed to forget all of the trouble they managed to cause for both good and evil within a matter of moments, consequences be damned.
Dean stood as Cas approached and stared at him with uncertainty.
Cas slowly dipped his index finger into the filling and brought it to his own lips to taste.
“That’s the thing… I want to act on them and don’t seem to care about the consequences. While I was listening to your sermon today I realized just how badly I want to fuck you.” Castiel’s body went stiff as the words kissed his ears. Silence fell upon the two men and if he could see Dean right now he’d see the cocky smirk on his face, raising his eyebrows suggestively as he waited for a response. Once Castiel snapped back to reality he was speechless.
Dean comes over for some of Castiel's pie.
“You wanted me to pound you like this the moment you saw me?” Dean asked as he brought Castiel’s legs up to rest on his shoulders.
All he could manage to get out was, “Oh.” Dean saw this as a green light to keep going.
Dean stepped forward as heavy silence filled the room. “So this is more appalling than when your kind rapes children? I forget how much homosexuality bothers you humans.” Dean smirked as the pope echoed the word “Humans?” and allowed his eyes to turn jet black to show his true form as a demon. The man’s face shifted in terror as he and the nuns began to back away.
“Don’t tell me you’re not enjoying this, Daddy.” He quietly huffed out breaths of pleasure while Dean aggressively began rubbing the palm of his hand over Castiel’s dick.
“You think you’re good enough for me to fuck? I’m trying to figure out why I should even bother, I mean look at me. Every single person at this school wants to fuck me, but you’re not like them, you’re fueled by my hate and you have a pretty fucking mouth and I’m going to fuck it til you cry.” His tone sinister, his grip around the smaller man’s throat tightened.
“You are no man!” The pope screamed, his tone a mixture of anger and fear.
“What will happen if I disobey?” Castiel sucked Dean’s lower lip into his mouth, his tongue softly brushing against it.
Dean and Castiel have been roommates since college and often joke about how the Universe brought them together, for they shared such a profound bond. They seemed to do everything together and Dean adored Castiel. Little did he know however, Castiel had been in love with Dean for as long as he could remember. He knew Dean wasn’t gay so he always kept that locked away deep inside. Sometimes when they were drunk, Cas could swear Dean wanted him. The look in his eyes, or the way his hand would linger on Castiel’s shoulder a bit longer than normal, or how he would find reasons to fall asleep in Castiel’s bed; but he made sure to keep his urges in check. Despite being in love with Dean, there was just as much lust there, so he had to work double to keep his shit together. He wanted to touch every inch of Dean. Sometimes he would catch a glimpse of Dean going into his room after a shower and couldn’t help but let his eyes wander. He would let Dean have him in any way he saw fit, all Dean had to do was make the move.
Once they were cleaned up they lay on the bed breathing deeply. Dean silently looked over at Cas and began to smile.
"Well, fuck." Castiel grunted as he heard the Chevy Impala roar to life and scurry out of the driveway.
*******************************************************************************************************
“Get your fucking pants down.” Dean demanded as he went for Castiel’s belt without even waiting for consent. Castiel allowed him to tear his pants from his waist and winced when his belt buckle slapped the floor. They both sat in silence to make sure the man on the other side of the wall didn’t notice and the man seemed to be wrapped up in his own story.
Dean stood completely still, his eyes boring into the other man. He parted his lips and leaned slightly forward to allow Castiel's digit brush up against his lips.
Dean let out a heavy sigh and turned back to Castiel.
"Dean," Castiel growled as he bit Dean's neck. "I'm going to cum." He gasped, rubbing his hands down the other man's body.
Castiel couldn’t focus on that because Dean’s orgasm came right after, his cum painting the bottom of the door along with part of the floor of the Lord’s house, throwing his head back as he fucked himself back onto Castiel’s semi-hard dick jerking himself zealously. After several moments Dean rose from his lap, snapped his fingers and they were both cleaned up and clothed in an instant.
He flushes a little, embarrassed about how much he just said. Probably going to scare the guy off with all his ramblings. He watches the three little dots, his friend typing in reply.
Dean hammers into place the final rivets and double checks his alignment. He walks around the item and tugs at the leather straps, running a hand along the smooth wood and across the soft leather. He’d sprung for some memory foam to make it even more comfortable but he hadn’t actually lain across it yet.
Castiel sighs, playing absently with his tie. “You won’t like it.”
He nods shakily as Castiel begins unbuckling everything and gets Dean to stand on shaky feet. He makes sure Dean is steady before he quickly strips the dirty cover sheet off the bed and gets Dean to lie back down. He feels a bit like putty right now, quite sure that Cas could bend and move him however he likes and he would just stay there. He watches lazily as Cas goes to the bathroom, coming back with a cup of water and a warm, wet washcloth. Dean drinks while Castiel wipes him down, peppering his skin with the occasional kiss.
“Sam, get inside and lock the door now!” he hisses, shifting himself to block the hallway.

“That’s him,” Roman calls, straightening his tie and taking a step closer. “You hear that, Winchester? Your alpha just called you a worthless piece of cattle. Maybe you can get on all fours and make him proud?”
“Have you used most of this before?” he asks cautiously, his eyes returning to the Saint Andrew's cross.
“Hmm, oh yes right, that time of day. Of course you may,” Chuck answers her, and Becky bounces up, giving Dean a smile before bolting out of the room. She seemed almost relieved.
“Is this what you call…dancing…slut?” Castiel hadn’t expected his sub to essentially become a power bottom, and even though Cas is still fully clothed, he feels like they’re on the brink of fucking right here in this chair.
He stops to think about it a moment. He thinks about having someone to come home to other than his little brother. Someone who he can talk to and laugh with and watch cheesy action movies with and cook dinner with. But he also wants someone who can fuck him six ways from Sunday and take some control from him, so he can just let himself be. That person doesn’t even exist…an equal partner in life and dom in the sack? He can have either or, but both options would leave him feeling like something was missing. No, he can’t really have a committed a relationship, ‘cause no relationship can give him everything he’d want.
He makes an impatient hand motion, and Castiel grumbles in aggravation, grabbing his glass of Scotch.
He swallows the lump in his throat before he goes into his and Sam’s room. To Dean’s shock the window is wide open, likely from Sam’s hasty exit. He looks at the door and sees the cracking in the wood around the handle and imagines the force put on it when Sam took off. It makes the heat creep up his neck as he feels rage fill him. It’s one thing for John to knock him around, but to come after Sam—to let his friends come after him—is crossing the line.
Love to you all!
His mind very unhelpfully continues to replay the night before—the tight heat of Castiel wrapped around him, the sweat on their skin and the slide of their lips together. It hadn’t felt like a scene. It hadn’t felt like training. It had felt…real. Dean is no blushing virgin, but he can’t ever remember sex feeling like that. Maybe he shouldn’t be surprised that it was amazing, since everything with Castiel is just so much better than anyone he had before.
Castiel arrives a half-hour early, walking the perimeter of the play room. Tonight they’ve been placed in one of the smaller rooms at the B&B, but he doesn’t mind—he arrived ahead of time, as always, placing his toys and props just where he wants them. He requested a single chair in the corner, but incidentally, Billie brought him two instead. He shook his head at her in the doorway, handing the second one back and explaining, “He won’t be sitting…in a
, exactly, he didn’t realize. There are too many things to count. He didn’t realize his father couldn’t be trusted? He didn’t realize love was more important than biology?
“I can do that, though it seems far away,” he admits. Now that he’s made this decision he wants to follow through on it.
Love you all,
Castiel swallows. “Dean…”
It's so fast that Dean almost misses it, but there's a sad, disappointed frown that crosses his alpha’s face before he bends to kiss Dean. “Not if you don’t want one, Dean,” he whispers softly in his mate's ear.
“Dean, Jo and Gabriel are waiting in the car out front with Alfie. Castiel is staying, so I was going to head out if you're okay?” Dean takes a second to process that. Sam is leaving and Castiel plans to stay with him. But Cas doesn’t even know everything—how can he make that call? What if he leaves Dean all alone here once he knows?
Dean holds out his hands, still cuffed, and Castiel quickly takes a sample, putting the drop of blood in a small tube. “We can drop that off with the doctor later this afternoon.”
“Why did they push it?”
He grabs a towel and walks away from the pool, out toward the lawn. He finds a spot in the grass far away from everyone, and lays the towel out, crawling onto his stomach and stretching out. Sun warming his skin, he tries not to think about his scent. He thinks he’s starting to drift off, smiling at the sounds of laughter and splashing in the pool.
“I was. I was around your age, sweet boy. Fresh out of college.” It’s when he first took a position with Purgatory, beginning as a trainer. In the picture, he’s wedged between his brother Gabriel, hand in his pocket and a sucker sticking out of his mouth, and his father Chuck, an easygoing smile on his face.

“No, Cas, look…” Dean tugs at his hair impatiently, as if he’s struggling to explain. “It’s not that I don’t want to one day. But if you can—just give me a little time? ‘Cause I really want to, Alpha, I promise."
TCB: Well, enough chit-chat, I'm sure everyone is dying to know how Cas' rut went…
“Oh? Unhappy with your mouthy little omega already?”
Dean lets out a hoarse chuckle. “I dunno. Maybe you haven’t noticed, but I got shit luck.” He looks around the room again before his eyes settle on Castiel. The incredulous gratitude that had been on his face slips away, replaced by an intense recognition. Cas is wedged between the rolling tray and the heart monitor, looking down at Dean and wanting so badly to reach out, to touch his face. “But, uh, I guess my guardian angel was looking out for me this time.”
Gadreel, at the very least, has the decency to look devastated. “The minute I heard the commotion, I came to help—”
“Well, trash is done. And I gotta say, even in a swanky ass place like this, it’s nice to see that a dumpster is still a dumpster. That thing stunk to high—” He halts in his tracks when spots Castiel, door latching behind him as he swallows, eyes wide, “—heaven.”
“Cas, fuck, right there, right…there…oh…Cas…shit, baby, feels so good…”
“Well, your Norepinephrine was very high…at levels that tell me your mind and body is under a great deal of stress. You also have dangerously low levels of the Subamine hormone, and this is likely the cause of weight loss, low blood pressure, and your low blood sugar. Not to mention the effects on your state of mind, confusion, irritability, and depression.”
“Hmmm, likely story, handsome,” she cooes before her sweet smile suddenly drops to a frown. Her voice has gone cold. “Your dad’s upstairs on the eleventh.” She nods toward the elevator before she returns to her computer screen, ignoring him now. He stands a moment, mouth hanging open before he shakes himself and pulls away from the counter.
Hey folks! I got a chapter done during all the life madness! and yes its been utter madness and its only beginning. I did a quick look and we aren't that far from the end guys so hang in there.
“Maybe!” he snaps back at her.
“Come on, Son. Let's go home.” The Dom reaches out a hand to Dean for him to take.
“You, Master!” he pants out, whining when soft fingertips smooth over the reddened skin.
“I don’t know what happened, Sam, so stop looking at me like that,” Dean grumbles and closes his eyes, willing the pain in his head to ease up a little.
Castiel stops, but not before scattering each cheek with kisses and nips, making Dean shiver. “Are you going to come on my cock, gorgeous?” He asks it as a flirty question, not in the demanding tone of a dom, but something about the wording still feels too familiar.
Castiel stood up, closing the door to the classroom and returning to his seat. "Of course, Sam, you know anything you say to me I will keep in confidence. What is it that you need?" Castiel tried to sound comforting, seeing the obvious distress in the man's face.
“Beautiful,” Dean mutters, kissing him mercilessly through the orgasm. When he does blink back to consciousness, Castiel rolls to the side and falls backwards onto his knees, taking in the sight of Dean with his back against the sleeping bag, stripping his own dick desperately.
, and has a garden on the cover which Dean can’t make sense of. At this point, he’s been through most of the books in the library about true mates that he can find. Most seem fairly well read, pages highlighted and notes taken. He isn’t really surprised that Castiel had researched so thoroughly the circumstances that killed his brother. It's funny, in a way—reading these books and following in his footsteps makes Dean feel closer to the alpha.
“I just wanted to know…how did you assemble the whole Avenger-style rescue?”

They both dig into their dinner in relative quiet, Castiel’s radio in the kitchen set to classic rock station on low. He feels his body soften, being so exposed as he is, his mostly soft cock resting on his thighs. He couldn’t imagine being so comfortable in his own skin even a few weeks ago. Now he happily sits through dinner, mostly naked as if it's any other Tuesday.
Dean looks up at Castiel, his expression unreadable. Castiel feels like a lead balloon has been dropped into his stomach.
“All those bastards are getting dragged to hell,” Ellen mutters in response, “that’s what’s going on.”
“Sorry ‘bout that, but the water heater is pretty big,” he says with a shrug.
“Gordon, can you tell me what training you have done with the sub so far, and what led to this incident?” Castiel asks calmly, hand stroking through Dean’s hair.
It sends a shiver up Castiel’s spine.
“Spit it out already.”
“Come here, Dean.” He stretches out his arms and Dean feels just vulnerable enough to go to him. He ends up sitting sideways on his lap, one arm cradling his back while the other hands him a steaming mug.
“Alrighty, that sounds like a plan, Stan. I’ll go get the discharge paperwork started so you can get outta here.” The doctor goes to leave, but turns and steps up to Dean’s side again. “I know you’ve been through a lot recently, Dean.” The doctor gives him a sympathetic smile that makes him shift uncomfortably in his seat. “Everyone needs a little help now and then, and not just from a partner. Take this and give them a call when you're ready.” She slips a business card into his hand and gives it a squeeze before she leaves the room, and Dean sags a bit in the bed, feeling suddenly exhausted. He glances down at the card and reads the name
“So you will be punished.” Castiel drops his hand, then turns around, clearing a hefty wooden coffee table. A stray issue of
“Come work for me instead,” Castiel says airily, hands rubbing absently on his suit trousers. “I have a large estate in Kansas City. I require an assistant to help me with my affairs, both in business and day-to-day life. Like Mr. Roman suggested, I believe a two-year commitment is fair. You’ll be compensated for the work you do, of course.” Castiel wants to add
“Did he achieve an erection at any time during training?”
The erection pushed against his thigh tells another story, though Castiel figures that could be from any manner of things—the voyeurism, the humiliation, the adrenaline of being properly dominated, perhaps for the first time in his life.
“Just a second Dean,” Chuck interrupts him with a raised hand, “you still have two other Doms to meet with, and normally we like for you and your chosen Dom to take more time, to talk to each other—”
Dean hoists his pack onto his shoulders and begins to fiddle with the straps. Sam had borrowed it recently, so nothing is the right length.
“Trying to talk Dean here into picking some classes to take,” Kevin chimes in.
He feels his heart hammering and the lump in his throat when he remembers the panties he put on today. But there’s no going back now as his jeans are pulled to the floor, and he steps out of them feeling a red flush heat his skin. The man gives a low whistle.
"No I don't hate it, but if you tell anyone I said that, you’re a dead man." Dean gave him a warning glare.
“What’s there to discuss?” Dean says breezily. He drops his voice down low, to a seductive whisper. “You still wanna be my master, don’t you?”
“When I was a child.” Castiel swallows and glares at his brother. “My brother seems to forget that I’m almost thirty, not five.”
“Must have been an oversight,” he mumbles, though he very intentionally did not put this meeting on his calendar. He hadn’t even told Missouri about it.
“Took the morning off. We’re working late tonight on a call with some company in another timezone. What are you up to?” Dean pushes himself to sitting, cracking his neck and giving his shoulders a roll. The tan and freckles help hide the hickey mark on his neck, but if anyone looked hard enough, they’d see it.
As Ellen agrees with that assessment, Castiel has a momentary flash of who he was before he met Dean: a cutthroat businessman with a traumatic past, stubborn and lonely, even cold and unfeeling at times. What a difference it makes, finding your true mate. Dean brings out his best qualities, makes him feel like his life means something.
“Yeah, umm…” Dean scratches the back of his neck, a nervous tick Castiel noticed during their first meeting. Dean’s cheeks flame scarlet, shifting uncomfortably in the leather chair, and Castiel’s interest is officially piqued. “No judgment?”
Castiel crosses and uncrosses his ankles, fingers raking across the denim surface of his jeans. He wants to make a dry comment about how he’s not paying Billie to be his therapist—certainly something his best friend, ‘67, would say—but he realizes that he’s technically not paying her at all. Not directly at least. She’s initiating this conversation for his own wellbeing, and he should try and take the lifeline she’s offering.
Castiel catches a sparkle of mischief in his eye when he sub whispers, “Both, Master.”
“Look, we didn’t want to say anything, not until we were sure there was something real here.” Sam puts his arm around her shoulder, pulling her in.
“Yes sir,” he whispers back and Castiel lets him go with a little squeeze to the back of his neck.
“But I want it,” the sub whines, and under different circumstances, Castiel might point out this little sudden brattiness. But he has a feeling this request goes deeper than wanting a hickey, so he simply pauses, waiting for his pet to continue. “I…I know how that sounded, and I’m sorry, Master, but I want

“I tried to get him out tonight,” Castiel says, feeling pained at the thought of letting his good boy down, “but the administration has the transfer paperwork from his previous Dom, so they’re holding him.”
CB & TCB
“I thought you promised not to ride Cash without Ellie or I there,” Castiel scolds, and if he throws a little dominance in his tone he simply can’t help it.
Castiel tries not to think about how he’s intentionally kept Inias’s existence a secret from Dean, never mentioning him and only scheduling their phone calls for when he’s safely alone in the west wing. He’s not sure why, exactly—it’s not as if he owes Dean an apology or explanation—but deep down, he knows it’s wrong to merely pass the time with Inias when there’s no future for them. Dean has become such a reflection of goodness in his eyes, of honesty and truth, that he’s now ashamed to disappoint his omega.
“Well, why don’t we start with a trial run this week, and if Ellie is happy with your work and you still want to continue on, we can make it official?” The man wipes his hands on his jeans and unhooks the rope to the horses halter.
“Fine… Deal,” he mumbles, standing up with wince of pain, “I get first shower.” With that he leaves his brother on the couch, his mind reeling with what he just agreed to. Of course, Sam doesn’t know just last night he tried to do just that and get his dom’s name. He was a little shaken by the whole thing and if it wasn’t for his dom’s insistence on repeating back all those words, he thinks he may have dropped pretty hard. As it was, he felt better than expected the next day.
“Mine,” Dean growls, before sinking his teeth into the soft flesh. He tastes the coppery tang of blood and hears the muffled cry of his name echo in the room, and he can’t hold back as he begins coming all over his mate below him. His teeth clamp hard, his every instinct to claim and keep his alpha forever singing through him triumphantly, his shivering body milking Castiel through his orgasm as his own cock gives a few valiant aftershocks.
“Come on, already.” Sam rolls his eyes and Dean shares a conspiratorial smile with Cas before they all head around to Ellen’s backyard.
“It’s okay, Cas, I know we’re better as friends. But for the record, no one was interested in you purely for your looks, okay? We’re into you because you’re a great guy. It sounds like Dean knows you really well, and loves everything about you. You could probably be really happy together…if he’ll pull his head out of his ass.”
They all get settled and dig in, Sam and Jo flanking him on either side. He loves moments like this, having his family all together and bickering and eating and just being together. His dad had struggled at being a single father, but if he did one thing right it was bringing these people into their life.
When it comes to Dean, Castiel doesn’t think he’ll ever get his fill.
Medic67 5:57 PM>>
The cake is delivered and the entire restaurant joins them in singing happy birthday, and then Gabriel is digging a fork into his freshly sliced piece of cake looking pleasantly surprised.
“Impala, and no scat or watersports, no blood, condoms are a must, and no permanent damage. Those are the big ones anyway,” he had his answer ready and he is pretty open to trying most things.
Dean nods, getting up and plastering on his best “everything’s fine” face. Castiel and Kevin are hunched over his laptop when he comes in. Cas gives Dean a concerned look, maybe catching on to some of his newfound tension. He just shakes his head at him, as if to say he’s okay, and sits down next to Kevin.
“Holy mother of—” He cuts off when a slick hand wraps around his cock and begins to stroke.
Dean fell to his knees, wincing as the broken glass dug into his skin. The girls quickly did the same, bowing their heads.
"Hey, don't get like that. I bet he won't bother taking him, the hassle of it. I'm sure he won't let himself be lacking for company."
Dean sighs dramatically, mutters incoherently, and begins to strip his shirt, struggling with the collar until it’s lifted up and off his head, and the shirt is tossed away in a wet heap. Castiel’s early suspicions had been right—Dean’s nipples are pert and pink and he swipes a tongue against his lips, fighting the urge to straddle his friend. He suspected that Dean had wanted to kiss him earlier, around the campfire, but the rain had been an interruption. Perhaps now, given the circumstances, the rain is giving them a second chance.
I guess
“And I love you, my sweet boy,” he says, just as quietly, hands touching Dean’s bare skin. He stands back up, shaking himself, trying to regain his focus. He shouldn’t be surprised that Dean has knocked him off-kilter—he’s always had that ability, even when he was just Castiel’s green-eyed sex partner. Castiel broke his rules for his sub all the time, his allure too strong to resist, and now that they’re in love… Well, Castiel is going to have to work hard to keep his dom persona from softening too much.
“Dean,” Castiel says in a low rumble. “Dean, if we don’t slow down, I’m going to—”
“My house?”
He puts down the notes and comes back over to Dean, standing right in between his spread knees. He feels utterly exposed as those cool blue eyes scan over him, then reach down, moving something under his table. Two stirrups pop up on either side of him, and he can’t contain the shiver that runs through him or the low whimper he lets out.
"Uh, you okay, Cas?" Dean was a bit bewildered at the look on Castiel's face. His blue eyes narrowed past Dean and were looking his sculpture up and down.
Dean practically falls to his knees at the deep, lust-filled command. He bends over, pressing his forehead to the ground, and sticks his ass in the air. He reaches back with both hands and spreads his cheeks as wide as he can, fingers digging into his own skin. The footsteps echo in the room as Master moves behind him. The toe of his boot presses into his thigh, lifting his ass a little higher. Holy fuck…if that isn’t so hot. He feels his dick fill out with the press of leather and rubber to his skin. The boot slides up the inside of his thighs and just barely taps at his balls, making him flinch. Fuck, this guy might be the actual death of him.
“Uh that's news to me,” he replies, wondering why all the secrecy.
“Like I said, there’s a lot of research surrounding the subject,” Castiel says evenly. He clears his throat and clasps his hands. “Well, Dean, it seems your time is almost up. Is there anything else I can help you with today?”
Medic67 11:13 PM >>
“Hello, Dean.” He slid into the opposite side and clutched at a menu just to have something to do with his hands. The Killers were singing about Mr. Brightside and Castiel couldn’t begin to make out the fast paced lyrics.
Dean just blinks at him, so Castiel continues.
“That collar did that?” John asks, his gravelly voice rumbling with an anger Dean hadn’t noticed before.
CB & TCB
He suddenly has the image of himself strapped down, naked and open while Castiel sits at the kitchen table having dinner. He shivers at the prospect and moves to follow Castiel toward a staircase.
“I did, Master. Cleaned it everyday.”
“Um no,” he manages to get his first words out.
“You look good enough to eat.” Castiel grins at him. “All of this beautiful body is all mine. I am a very lucky Dom.”
When they pull up to the main movie theater in Kansas City, Inias parks and they strode together up to the call box. The line is long—evidently Inias has decided to take them to an action movie on its premiere weekend—and they’re talking aimlessly about how warm it feels this evening when Castiel spots him.
“S-Sir?”
CB: Always.
“Fuck, Master,” Dean huffs out against Castiel’s neck.
TCB & CB
“Hey Mikey?” he says, and the guy looks at him as Dean injects him in the arm. “Yippee-Ki-Ketamine, mother fucker.” Dean smiles as the guy already starts to slow and slump into the stretcher. Jo stands back up and catches her breath as Dean begins strapping the guy down, getting him secure.
“Anyways,” he mumbles, rising to his feet, “I should—”
“Oh my fucking god, you’re so tight.” Dean whimpered, biting his lip as he continued to thrust harshly into Castiel trying to get himself all the way inside. Castiel was crying out, it felt so good to hurt. It felt so good for Dean to be the one abusing him. From the first time Dean tried to intimidate him he knew he wanted this. He wanted Dean to own him. While the rhythm was kind of slow, Dean’s thrusts were aggressive. Gripping Castiel’s hips Dean began to quicken the rhythm, the sound of skin and moans filling the shower. Castiel cried out as Dean hit his prostate over and over causing him to become a whimpering mess and Dean showed no mercy.
"Luckily I have another set." He smiled, making his bed up so they could lay down.
“Hope I’m on time, Father… I came a bit early just to make sure I was here when you were ready for me.” Oh fuck. That smile… that body. Without saying anything, Cas ushered him into the church trying to be as quiet as possible. They quickly swept the halls until they made a sharp turn to a single door in a nook at the end of a shallow hallway. Once they entered, Castiel checked the lock three times before he faced the other man.
“Feel good, Father?” Dean slightly moaned.
Oh no.
"Fuck." Dean hissed as the hot breath created a deep chill at the base of his neck causing his body to tense up against Castiel's mouth. Cas aggressively grabbed Dean's hips and shoved him back down onto the mattress just before yanking his boxers completely off to expose his throbbing member.
“It looks like Castiel has made his decision. And this ‘God’ you worship isn’t here. God gave up on you vermin a long time ago. You all betray, lie, murder and rape your kind constantly, humans haven’t changed since the beginning of time so do you really believe the being who created all of this is going to give one fuck if a man wants another man?”
Castiel has been working as a kitchen manager at Layla's Diner for a little over five years. He moved to Kansas to start a new life and ended up at the diner for what was only supposed to be a few months. Little did he know he would end up loving it and meeting his best friend Charlie, a quirky thin red headed girl with a light in her that was blinding. She was the first in town to know Cas was gay and she stepped up to the challenge of being the perfect wingman.
"I shouldn't have come here. I'm not gay and I have led you to believe I am." Dean stared at the floor in shame.
Dean didn’t answer, instead he yanked Castiel off the couch and led him to his bedroom. Once inside Dean slammed the door and Castiel shoved him up against it.
Dean laughed as he examined the concerned look on Castiel’s face. “Cas. I’m not drunk.” He shot Castiel a mischievous grin.
"Okay, where do you live?"
Cas grabbed Dean's arm as he turned away, causing their eyes to meet again.
Dean was Captain of his high school’s football team and everyone wanted to fuck him or be him, or both. There wasn’t a girl he couldn’t have, there wasn’t a guy that didn’t all but bow down in his presence. He was a complete and utter asshole because he knew all of these things which was off putting when he met Castiel. Castiel had been attending his school for about a week now and he and his friends were having a blast at their attempt to make his life a living hell. The one thing Dean had noticed however, was the way Castiel’s demeanor would completely change when Dean was the one trying to intimidate him. When his friends would pick on Castiel you could see the frustration in his face but he never spoke a word nor retaliated; yet when Dean would be the one in his face trying to intimidate him his body language became more open. Even though a smile never quite touched his lips, Dean could see it in the corners of those intense blue eyes. It was almost as if he enjoyed being heckled by Dean but it was so subtle he had trouble reading the new boy. Obviously over time this was starting really piss Dean off because he wasn’t getting the reaction he usually demanded from his intimidation tactics. Did this guy think he was a fucking joke? Why wasn’t he submitting to him the way everyone else does whenever he decides to show who has the biggest dick in town? No one was going to try and undermine Dean, especially this odd new Castiel fellow. His style was plain compared to his face he looked like he could be a model. Not that Dean ever paid attention to things like that because he was a straight man, a ladies man. No one like him would ever look at another man in a way that showed attraction. Or so he constantly told himself. He wasn’t gay but Castiel has intrigued him, he was the only person Dean has ever met that wasn’t intimidated by him and it got under his skin, but at the same time it was a huge turn on. Who did Castiel think he was? How dare he not bow down and submit. Dean was always the alpha, except at home. His father was an abusive drunk who lived to condescend Dean and constantly make him feel like less of a man. This was why Dean always had to prove himself to others, no one else was going to let him feel that way about himself. The phrase “daddy issues” didn’t even begin to cover Dean’s projection of emotion.
Above him, Castiel sighs and Dean feels the tension seep out of the muscles in Castiel’s legs. He glances up at Castiel who looks down at him with tired eyes. His usually clean-shaven face is beginning to grow stubble, and he has bags under his eyes. Work must not be getting any better.
. He turns to Castiel with a smile. “Hey, good choice.”
Of course he is, Dean thinks.
“So what was your dream job, then?”
Dean scoffs. “I got a Bachelor of Education, I didn’t win the Nobel Peace Prize. And Sam is Sam; I didn’t do anything to make him who he is.”
people.’
Castiel thinks on it a moment, then reaches back to flick on the lamp beside him.
The fact that Dean’s been researching BDSM for the past hour isn’t exactly helping quell the constant itch. But he wants to know how these relationships are actually supposed to work. He has to wade through a lot of crap, but every once in a while he lands on a useful article or blog post from people who aren’t just spouting bullshit.
Dean stares in horror at the darkened fabric of Castiel’s t-shirt. “Oh, God. I’m so sorry.”
“Do you need me to keep talking?”
“Made me so hard watchin’ you. Just imagining those legs wrapped around me.” The man grabs Dean’s ass, kneading it with a clammy palm.
The apartment is at least three times the size of Dean’s old studio, but it feels somehow smaller. Castiel has so much stuff that it takes up most of the space. Despite it feeling a bit cramped, Dean feels more at home here than he did in his own apartment the past four years. Maybe that has something to do with the fact that Castiel has the taste of an old grandmother.
Dean stays silent as Castiel collects his coat from the closet and leaves, the door sounding like a gunshot as it clicks shut with finality. He collapses on the couch and falls asleep hours later with tear-stained cheeks.
Dean shrugs. “Then you have bad taste.”
“I said I’d be there in a minute.” Castiel doesn’t even look up from his computer screen.
Dean repeats it again and again until Castiel isn’t spanking him anymore, but running a cool hand over his shoulder blades, down his back, his sides, until his palm comes to rest on the curve of Dean’s ass once more and Dean tenses, waiting for Castiel to continue spanking him.
Dean’s ass aches where Alastair hastily prepped him and he shakes his head minutely, still staring in shock at the device.
CAS: Good boy.
“Don’t get behind the wheel if you’re unable to focus on the road.”
He realizes his mistake as Alastair’s grip tightens and he slams Dean’s head against the mattress, pressing him down until he can’t breathe.  He cries apologies into the mattress, pleading with his Master, but his words are muffled.
“I’m good.”
“I love you, too, Cas. And I promise that in the future if I need to use the safeword I will—even if it’s during a punishment.”
His excitement even carries over to the next day all the way through his first shift, which ended up being two hours longer than originally planned. Tessa had needed him to stay late to help with a sudden rush of customers while she dealt with a poorly timed delivery of coffee grounds and cups.
It’s hard to text with only one hand, so he throws the phone down, using his now free hand to play with his sensitive nipples, teasing and pinching the way Castiel does.
Dean stares down at the giant burger in front of him. “What the hell is on this thing?” He can see cheddar cheese, bacon, fried mushrooms, tomato, and some leafy vegetables piled high on top of a thick patty of beef. His mouth is watering just looking at it.
“There’s nothing wrong with that.”
The voice follows him half-way to the address Castiel had given him.
“I live to serve you, Master,” Dean replies, the words literally beaten into him until he could recite them perfectly. They’re a reflex now, coming to Dean naturally. “I am only a hole, nothing more. Worthless.”
She leans in and whispers in his ear, something that makes the young sub shudder.  His eyes open and find Dean’s, but soon he’s throwing his head back as his Mistress tweaks at a nipple and runs her nails down his thighs. The Mistress captures her sub’s mouth and Dean watches only a minute longer as they become more passionate and seem to forget about their audience.
Dean realizes he’s been standing in the kitchen just staring at the set table for some time. Castiel must be caught up at work, so Dean washes the dirty pots and pans from cooking dinner while he waits, but when he’s done Castiel still isn’t home. Dean’s stomach growls impatiently. He hasn’t eaten all day and the pasta smells amazing, but he ignores his stomach and heads to the living room to watch TV while he waits for Castiel.
“The scene’s over, Dean, let me undo the cuffs.”
“Dean.” Castiel’s voice is a notch lower, commanding. His whole demeanour changes in an instant. He stands straighter, his very presence giving off waves of authority. Dean shivers. He’s not even sure Castiel is aware of the slight changes in posture as he switches to Dom Castiel. “Tell me what you want.”
“No.” Dean shakes his head. “I like listening to you talk.”
“Make it go away.” Dean nuzzles into Castiel’s touch, turning to press kisses to his hand. “Please, please, Castiel.”
But Dean doesn’t care for reason, cares only about the broken sound of Castiel’s voice after Dean had said things he didn’t mean, had said specifically to hurt. And now he needs to feel the sting of a whip or the burn of a flogger, needs to feel
“Hush. It’s quiet time now. No talking unless I give you permission. Except to safeword, of course. Though your mouth will be occupied. Show me your non-verbal safeword.”
“I still don’t understand why you need a safeword if you’re the one in control. Can’t you just stop the scene any time?”
By the time Castiel settles back in the space between Dean’s spread legs and sticks his tongue out to lick the tip of his cock Dean is no longer in danger of coming without permission.
Castiel goes in search of a movie, and Dean sets to making the best popcorn he’s ever made. He fills the machine with kernels and a few minutes later he has a giant bowl overflowing with light, fluffy popcorn, smothered in salt and melted butter. He grabs a handful of napkins and meets Castiel in the living room.
Dean searches out Castiel again and his intense stare seems to ground him, gives him something to focus on. Dean smiles softly at him and shoots him a wink. He’s fine and he doesn’t want Castiel to worry. The scowl is gone from his face, but Dean can’t tell what he’s thinking now.
“No, babe. I don’t want you to be like Alastair. I love you exactly the way you are. You’re kind and gentle and even during a scene you treat me like I’m something precious. I just want a little
“Uh…” This was supposed to be an easy one? “I don’t have one.”
Dean nods, still catching his breath. His entire body is on fire, burning with need. Even the lightest touch could send him over the edge now.
Castiel does reach out then and rests his fingers lightly against Dean’s arm. Dean jolts back and away from the touch. He looks away and clears his throat, rubs at the back of his neck and winces.
“Or what?”
He looks up at a harsh grunt from Castiel and sees two men are working on subduing him. Dean recognizes them as Alastair’s henchmen, or that’s always how he always referred to them anyway. Four years Dean has been with Alastair but not once has he ever heard him use either of these men’s names. But they seemed to follow Alastair wherever he went, never straying too far.
“Dean?”
A laugh peals out of Balthazar’s mouth.  “That would be something, wouldn’t it?  Felled by the blade of one of our kin.  Hilarious.”
Dean lets in a long breath.  In through the nose, out through the mouth.
Cas’s eyes prickle with wetness, fixating on him.  His voice is as gruff as ever.  “Dean.”
The phone stays facing the ground.  It buzzes and buzzes, vibrating and dancing, but Dean doesn’t hear it.
Castiel places his opposite hand over Dean’s.  “Sober up,” he insists, “and we’ll talk.”
“Oh,” Jack snaps his fingers, “that reminds me!  I have a surprise for you, Sam.  Let me just,” he makes a motion by circling an index finger, “here we are.”
The bunker door swings open with a creak of heavy metal.  They freeze in their tracks as footsteps descend from the balcony above them.
Sam’s voice travels throughout the bunker.  Dean does not give an indication of where he is inside the maze.  He doesn’t even have the strength to swipe away his streaming tears; what would possibly give him the strength to call out his brother’s name?
“Oh,” Jack holds the blade horizontally, offering it to Dean, “this is for you.  My power should give your swing an extra...oomph.”
His eyes were emerald.  A dazzling green with rings of gold around his pupils.  Even with the blood of his enemies splattered across freckles, kisses from dead angels, his eyes are bright and hopeful.  Soft.  Beseeching.  Beautiful.
Castiel sticks his hands in his hoodie.  Jack teleported him to Dean’s location: a Gas ‘N Sip near the bunker.
And he says, “I want to become human.”
Dean stares at the wall across the room.  The provisional room that sprouted tentacles and snatched Cas away from him.
Dean nods once.  “I want him back too.”
Dean presses the heels of his hands against his eyes.  His joints ache in protest as the wetness is swiped away from his cheeks.
It is the easiest words he’s ever verbalized.  A weight on his mind, on his chest, lifts away and melts as if never there at all.
The group runs, one eye on the oncoming wave, the other on pushing ahead.  The portal is not too far away.
He continues, “I know you said you’re taking a hands-off approach, but...I left some things unsaid.  People died that shouldn’t have died.  So much has been lost that I’m not sure what’s left of this world.”
Exhaling, Castiel rises from the chair.  His trench coat billows as he rounds the desk and walks briskly.  He passes up the reluctant young angel and exits the office.
He strides down hallways until he reaches the bunks for members of his garrison.  A new recruit stutters at his arrival and alerts the others to his approach.
Dean scoots back in a recoil, eyes widened at the machete-like curve of the blade.  Jack held it so precariously, too, that it is cause for alarm.
Jack flicks his hand in an abrupt movement.  The scene that had Castiel smiling is replaced with one that is all too familiar.
Dean exhales slowly.  His hand lowers to Castiel’s.  Warmth registers.  Dean’s fingers curl around Castiel’s wrist.
Once they are beside the telescope, Jack unlatches the curtains.  They are bathed in a layer of dust as they are closed.
Balthazar snickers.  “You would if you went to visit your Righteous Man.  Went to spend more time amongst our counterparts.  It’s not the craziest idea, darling.”
The emotions that Dean had been struggling to keep inside rush out of him.  Dean seems to breathe for the first time in weeks, his heart thumping in answer.
Sam takes the angel blade, and Eileen picks the machete.  They each hold a weapon in their hands.
He buries his head between his knees.  He sniffles into the unforgiving denim, squeezing his watery eyes shut.
“Deal.”  Cas squeezes his hand.
“Cas,” he breathes a third time, “you didn’t let me say it back.”
Castiel frowns.  “What do you mean?”
Eileen is the first to react, the edge of her thrown angel grace dagger piercing into the face of a sludge monster.  It fades into demon-esque dark mist, leaving the dagger.
Castiel releases Balthazar’s shoulder and locks the door behind him.  “Sit.”
What is black becomes white.  The pigment of the floor, the endless shadows, turn white as if flipping a switch.
“Hey, Dean?”  Sam is panicked.
Castiel reads Samandriel as he shrinks under the weight of his gaze.  Ice blue meets chocolate brown.
He doesn’t care about anything right now.
“Fine,” Balthazar pushes himself out of the chair, “can we be done now?”
Jack’s mouth tugs into a smile.  “It’s over, Castiel.  All of it.  Chuck is gone.  I have taken his place.  The world is saved.”
A figure rounds the staircase and becomes visible.
“I haven’t spoken directly to Dean and Sam in the week since...it happened,” Jack says, “but...you know what?  I’ll show you.”
The tip of an angel blade, burning bright silver-blue, sinks into the reaper’s ribcage.  Its hole mouth emits a dying screech, echoing throughout the void.
“Aha!”  Balthazar leans forward, a smile widening on his face.  “There he is.”  He pats on the side of the chair.  “I knew you were still in there.  The sass says it all.”
Dean leans in at the exact second Cas does.  When their lips touch, Dean swears it’s the best feeling that he’s ever felt.
No.  The jacket isn’t beige.  It is white.  His clothes are blue.  He glows in the darkness.
“Stop accosting the young angels and trying to convert them to your way of thinking,” Castiel says, “they are vulnerable and impressionable.”
Castiel leads Balthazar out of the garrison barracks in silence.  Thousands of invisible angel eyes follow their progress until they are back in Castiel’s office.  Thankfully, the new seraphim woman left after his abrupt exit.
Even though his sleep is not peaceful, he curls in on himself.  A tightly-wound rubber band ball ready to snap.  Ready to shed layers and create self-destruction.
Dean didn’t cry much.  His deep-seated fears prevented him from doing a lot of the things that he’s wanted to try throughout his life.  Now that he was at the end, he wished he had defied the odds and done them all.  Why not kiss the guys he met in backwater towns after flirting and tripping over barstools?  Why hadn’t he tried?
Castiel relives every memory he accumulated from his time on Earth.  The hopelessness, the fear, the happiness.  He stares up at the blank void all around him and watches, unmoving as tears slip down his temples.
Echoing footsteps carry and pause upon entering the room.  “Uh...what’s going on?”
Light spears across the floor, the tip of a pyramid resting near his chest.  He sighs at the celestial sign.
Samandriel holds himself and ducks his head.  He mutters, “I-I’m fine.”
“Jack,” his voice is scratchy from an unspecified time of disuse, “why do you look…”
Castiel lifts his eyes from the desk.  The walls, lined with streaks of fluorescent light, the light of joyful souls in their personal Heaven, illuminate a young seraphim woman dressed in a pantsuit and carrying a clipboard.  He does not care to look beyond the surface level, at the omniscience affixed to her hands.  He says nothing, and she takes the prompt.
Dean gulps at that. He has no doubt Castiel means every word.
Dean fights against the post-orgasm haze that threatens to overtake him, so welcoming with the promise of numb oblivion, but there’s no telling what could happen to him if he’s too out of it; some people like to take Dean’s immobile state as invitation to use him on the days Alastair leaves and no one bothers to cut him free. So he doesn’t allow himself to drift, instead trying to quickly claw his way back to full awareness, but his body betrays him as he goes limp, no longer able to stay upright.
“Oh yeah? You like making men blush?” Dean almost regrets the words as they slip past his lips, but with five—or six?—beers in his system he can’t be bothered to give a shit.
Straps tighten around his thighs, securing him to the bench, though he couldn’t have lifted himself off if he wanted to. Strong hands yank at the ropes securing his arms and he moans as the machine prods directly at his prostate. The ropes come undone and Dean flexes his fingers, tingling as blood flows back into them.
Dean stares at Castiel’s socked feet. “Two, Castiel.”
Dean snorts. “Yeah, lack of communication skills is a trait that seems to run in my family. It’s like embedded in our DNA or something.”
Dean glances at Castiel above him and sighs. “It’s just…I was taught that submissives aren’t supposed to look directly at their Master, that it was challenging their dominance. A perfect sub shows his submission in every action: from his stance to the way he behaves.”
But instead of going to the bedroom, Castiel walks into the kitchen.
Castiel offers aftercare to a sub that’s not his own and they both find themselves wanting more.
His surroundings blur in and out of focus, and Dean thinks maybe he’s fading in and out of consciousness because one second he’s suspended by his arms, shoulders aching from the strain, and the next he’s lying against smooth leather.
It feels surprisingly good: Castiel untying him. He praises Dean as he works, telling him how well he did, calling him “perfect” and “good boy.”
Dean barks out a harsh laugh. “You think he cares?”
Castiel huffs into Dean’s mouth and then he’s kissing back with a bruising force, grabbing onto Dean’s jacket and pulling him close. Dean can feel himself grinding down into Castiel and has a split second to be embarrassed before he feels Castiel grind back and moan into Dean’s mouth.
Dean laughs at the way Charlie’s chest puffs out as she speaks. She sounds exactly the same as she did in university when they used to stay up late bashing romance novels in the common room.
“Yeah, I mean after last night…” he trails off.
Dean yelps when Castiel pinches his ass, more in surprise than pain. Though it does hurt, a sharp pain like a bee sting or the prick of a needle that quickly dissipates, unlike the continuous ache Castiel paints over his ass and thighs.
Dean wraps his arms around Castiel, one hand sinking into his hair to pull Castiel into a kiss, both of them panting into each other’s mouths as Dean rocks his hips down and Castiel thrusts up shallowly.
Dean realizes he’d been talking out loud, pleading for Castiel to not leave him alone again, and his face flushes. He feels his head spinning. The sensation is familiar by now, though the drop will be worse this time; it always is when he drinks too much before a scene.
Castiel quickly ducks out of sight, turning his back to the hall, hoping to look like just another patron and escape notice. He waits, shoulders tense, listening for the man’s approach. A minute ticks by and still the man hasn’t passed him, so he slowly peeks around the corner and sees the man halfway down the hall, leaning against the wall with his arms folded across his chest.
The man’s eyes widen a fraction at Dean’s comment but then his expression darkens and he replies, “Immensely.”
Castiel goes still. He pulls back to look Dean in the eye. “You…love me?”
Castiel shuffles back into his room and slips on a t-shirt, then follows Dean to the table where the breakfast feast Dean prepared is waiting for them.
Dean’s heart sings when he hears the affirmation from Castiel and he has trouble placing the emotion as he soars high with it. “I guess we better wave down the waiter for some salads then.”
“Says society. It’s not like this is the kind of shit you can just talk about over family dinner.”
The next blow comes right on the tail end of the first, not giving Dean any time to adjust. He groans, pushing back into it, seeking more. And Castiel doesn’t disappoint.
“Don’t worry, I’m not that cruel. Now get changed so we can go pay for all this.”
“God, you’re so amazing, Dean. I can’t believe how lucky I am to have met you.”
Dean stares at him and Castiel stares right back, both of them silently assessing each other, before Dean decides that Castiel, for whatever reason, is telling the truth.
“And what else?”
“No, Castiel.”
“Stop.” Dean yanks his wrist out of Castiel’s grasp. “Just stop, okay. You’ve got no idea what you’re talking about.”
“But I want to know about you, not your brother, as fine a person I’m sure he is.”
“Hey, easy there, you hit your head pretty hard.” The woman grabs his arm to steady him. Her palm is cool against his sweaty skin and he sighs.
Dean leans forward, wincing as the movement causes more pain to flare in his knees and down his legs. He immediately takes the dildo as far as he can into his throat, backing away when he feels himself about to gag.
“No, not necessarily. He could be doing a fantastic job, but the fact remains that for four years you gave Alastair control over your mental state as well as your physical wellbeing and there are lasting side-effects to that—one of which being that anxiety between scenes.”
“It’s not nothing,” Castiel cuts in, voice firm. The speaker crackles as Castiel lets out a deep breath and says, softer, “If it caused you that much distress it certainly was not nothing and you don’t need to apologize for it.”
The sneer falls from Alastair’s face, his grip on Dean’s jaw turning bruising. He smears the spit on Dean’s cheek and backs away. “Seems like the lesson still needs to be drilled in.”
He whips his head around to find his dad standing across the room from him. He moves quickly to his dad’s side as Edgar shuts the door, blocking the exit.
CB here with another chapter for you guys. This weeks conversation between TCBaby and myself went something like this.
“Good?” Castiel asks, though Dean’s face drops back into a scowl.
“Sounds s’good, Cas, mmmm,” Dean mutters, and the nickname catches Castiel off-guard for a moment, but he keeps working a wet wipe against Dean’s softening cock and abdomen, not wanting to correct him. “Feel high, like I’m…just floating…but you’re here too. Right?”
. He never should have told his little brother that he was trying to get in shape for the Swat Medic boot camp. He settles down at the kitchen table, flipping through the junk mail.
“No, no, no,” he scolds himself aloud. He chuckles darkly, realizing he’s officially reached the “talking to himself” stage in his obsession with Dean. Resigned to getting little sleep tonight, he rolls out of bed and reaches for his robe. Perhaps he’ll visit the library downstairs and find something long and laborious to put him to sleep. The inside of the manor is dark, too dark, and Castiel flicks absently at the light switch for a nearby hallway—nothing. The electricity must be out.
“Sorry 'bout that,” he mutters an apology. He’s never been so happy for blockers keeping his heady scent of arousal in check.
Dean looks at the shop with Garth. It’s actually a really nice location, close to the river. They talk about what kind of food they would offer and Dean checks out the back kitchen to see a decent enough set up for a bakery. He had thought Garth was nuts to open a physical location, but the more they talk through the numbers, the more it sounds like a reasonable business venture. Garth even has an appointment with his bank for a new business loan and he wants Dean to come along.
As luck would have it, though, such drastic measures hadn’t been necessary. The judge had seen that Dean was a first-time offender, issued a five-hundred-dollar fee, and that was that.
“Shit,” he huffs under his breath, taking one last look before going to answer the door.
“More than sex, Dean. There is more to a relationship between a dominant and a submissive than that. I was hoping we could start with you filling out a quick form—it's a simple set of questions that will help us figure out if we are compatible, and have the same likes and dislikes.”
He gets so carried away with his fantasy that he’s half-hard and totally ignoring his phone, and when he looks back down he has a string of unread messages.
“Want to sit down for a bit?” Castiel whispers in his ear, and while Dean wants to say he’s fine, his body begs to differ. He nods, and Castiel gives his shoulder a squeeze. “Sam, we’re heading to the living room. Why don’t we all go sit in there and you can tell us all about your semester?”
“That’s my brother. You know him?”
“Well, that coulda gone better,” Bobby says sarcastically, glaring at John. “He’s only back for a few hours, y’know. Hoped we’d at least make it to cake before all hell broke loose.”
“You been here before, lad?”
“I’m so sorry, Dean, really.” Castiel felt the weight in his chest like a vice.
Love you guys thanks for all the support <3
A few days early posting, which I am so excited about. So there is dialogue in this chapter that I wrote back at the beginning of this fic. I showed my beta readers and told them that this was what I had to get the characters too. I am so happy to finally share this chapter with you guys. See you in the comments!
Dean swallows and nods.
alpha…about the definition of consent and the consequences of hurting my family.” Castiel’s voice sounds downright murderous and the smell of alpha rage fills Dean’s nose for a moment. His body can’t help but react by pulling away from the scent.
“Just getting dressed, were you?” she says dryly. When Castiel doesn’t answer, she adds, “I passed Mister Winchester on the way up.”
Dean thinks about it. He hasn’t missed the fact that neither of them have brought up Dean’s love confession from a few days ago. Though Cas had said he was falling for Dean, maybe that means he isn’t all the way there but wants to find out. The thought is terrifying. This might be the most vulnerable he’d ever been in his life. But he looks up at those hopeful blue eyes and knows then that he still meant every word he’d said in that parking lot. He loves this man, and he’s just going to have to face his fears if he’s going to stand a chance with him.
“You sent him into the playroom?” Castiel’s voice is nearly a growl now, and Alfie cowers a little at the show of dominance. Castiel breathes out, trying to remain calm. This isn’t Alfie’s fault. If anything, it’s
“Knock knock,” Dr. Hanscum calls as she walks into the room. Dean feels his body tense at the sight of the Doctor despite her warm, welcoming smile. He remembers the first time he met her, all those months ago. Seems like so long ago—another lifetime, almost. He has learned so much about himself and what he wants since then. Still, he’s lying in a hospital bed feeling just as broken as the day he met her, so maybe things haven’t changed as much as he would like. “How is our patient feeling?”
Cas nods and follows her down the hill toward the paddocks. It’s a more of a planned dance bringing them in then most people would realize, needing to try and follow the pecking order to avoid any dinner time drama. Cas looks over each horse as he brings them in, checking for any fresh cuts or anyone walking funny. Fly masks get hung up with halters, and soon the barn is filled with the sounds of horses munching down their hay. He loves when the barn is full, all the snuffles and shifting and munching sounds are soothing to him. He and Ellie grab grain buckets and make their way down the aisle.

“Hush, now. You’ve taken your punishment and it's time for my reward. Be a good boy for Daddy.” Cain’s voice still feels far away but Dean wants to be a good boy, he
“Ah! Ah!” he cries out as Castiel thrusts a few times till he’s fully seated within him. Dean is well and truly stuffed, he’s burning from the flogging and it makes Castiel’s skin against his own feel like it's on fire. It's amazing and overwhelming and he shivers all over as Castiel pulls back and thrusts in again, knocking a choked sob of submission out of him.
“Oh, y’know, finally sealing the deal with your online bestie. Never woulda thought he wasn’t a secret creeper, though it’s only your first date, so the jury’s still out.”
“It’s sturdy, too, just like you wanted,” he adds, watching Castiel rise up and stride over to him. He raises a hand to curve around Dean’s neck, thumb against his jaw and he swallows hard the touch, wanting more.
TCB: We really are.
He opens the document to find a multiple choice list with the title “Willing & Able?” at the top. Most of the questions are a bit more straightforward.
“I found time. It was no problem, really, Dean. I'm just glad I found you.”
“Yeah, but look at all you’ve done for Amy, and all you’ve done for me. Just think you could do a lot more kids out there. We can find a way to make it work if you want to do that.”
When their plates are practically licked clean, Dean plants his elbows on the table and looks at Castiel curiously.
When they finally separate, Dean’s eyelids hooded and dark, Castiel says in his ear, “I’m going to take pictures of the falls, because my final grade depends on it. And then we’re leaving a day early, and I’m going to fuck my new boyfriend into the first available mattress we can find.” He kisses Dean’s neck, his chin, before finally kissing the corner of his mouth. “How does that sound?”
“No, of course not. He isn’t my horse, Dean, she owns him, and unless she steps over the line and hurts him I can’t stop her from having access to him.” Castiel sounds weary as he leads the horse toward the barn.
He nods, sitting up in bed a little with Sam’s help and pulling a small throw blanket over his naked shoulders. The material is itchy but it offers him a bit of dignity…if he has any of that left to preserve. He takes a few small sips and the water makes his gut twist. A knock at the cabin door has both brothers flinching.
Dean still can hardly believe he found freedom in being bound, safety in his vulnerability, understanding in the soul of a horse, and a reason to hope for the future. Dean knows things won’t always be easy, but he now knows he can handle what life throws at him, with the man he loves at his side.
happen. Castiel isn’t sure how it happens, but suddenly, he has a lime in his hand and salt on his lips, and he’s swaying in his seat at the bar.
Have you already eaten tonight?
“How does it feel being at my mercy, pet?” Castiel moves the device around slightly in every direction, knowing constant attention to the prostate will make his sub come prematurely.
Dean’s heart sinks right into his stomach. “You're lying.”
“Yes, Master.”
“Perks of being the boss!” Jo calls over her shoulder, stacking the empty plates and passing them off to Dean. So Castiel wanders back down to his office, passing Dean’s empty desk wistfully, though they’ve just parted at dinner. It’s unsettling how quickly the omega always leaves him wanting more. He fishes his cell phone from his pocket and stares at the text from Inias, stomach twisted in knots before finally replying:
“I’m fine, he took a swing at me but I’m alright, see? No worse for wear.” Dean holds out his arms, as if to show his fine health. A wiggle of his eyebrows has his brother rolling his eyes and cracking a smile.
“Would you like to join me?” he asks, tossing a hand out in front of them.
He clicks on it warily, fully expecting to accidentally download some virus and be chastised later by Charlie. Instead a picture downloads slowly, overwhelming his screen as it comes to life inch by inch. The background is a gray wall, and he squints, trying to place the room. In the next few seconds, various elements of the image come to life: a metal table, a pair of handcuffs, a man
Cas can tell—it physically pains the man to restrain himself around a good cock. He’s a true cockslut for his dom, which only makes his compliance twice as hot for Castiel. He reaches his mouth up and licks tentatively, once, twice, and Cas sighs and grips his hair lightly in encouragement. His tongue circles the head of Castiel’s cock, concentrating on the slit, and it’s so delicate and light that it’s driving him wild. When he’s nearly over the edge, he pulls away and pumps his cock a few times before spilling all over his sub’s face. The man laps it up willingly, sucking on his lower lip and whining, and Castiel takes his thumb and rubs the come deeper onto the man’s skin. His cheeks and forehead are streaked with Castiel’s claim and he seems to understand what the dom is implying, sighing and sinking into the pleasure of it.
voice came with
“To have an Omega… in your bed. You sure you're an Alpha?” Dean teased a bit.
. Castiel grins and mouths at his cock, hands on either side of his hips, holding him down. He can’t take his eyes off the man as he licks and kisses up and down his shaft. It feels amazing but not nearly enough. Castiel finally moves his hands, pulling the panties down just enough to free his cock to open air. Castiel looks up at him in the dark of the car, licks his lips and proceeds to swallow him down.
The room seems momentarily stunned into silence…until Lilith chuckles, a nasually, high-pitched sound. Roman shoots her a glare, and she holds her hands up as she continues to laugh.
Dread drops into Castiel’s stomach, and he opens his mouth to fabricate an excuse. But she just raises a hand in silence. “No, it’s okay, you don’t have to tell me if you’re not ready. Just know that everyone in this house will protect him, and protect you, that much I know. But I read your contract with Dick Roman, too, Castiel. I know the stakes are high, honey… And I know for an omega that some fates are worse than death.”
He pours himself a hefty cup of coffee and performs his new favorite activity: obsessively rereading Cain’s registry application. He’s read the file cover to cover, and he can’t fathom how he scored so high with Dean. Cain is an older Dom who appreciates service subs, and his preferred honorifics are “Daddy” and similar age-orientated play. Castiel scoffs while he reads, shaking his head, thinking all these traits would not work for Dean in the long-term. Then again, maybe the registry knows something he didn’t, and Dean was secretly wishing Castiel would call him “Son” and demand he sweep the floor each day. Castiel had trusted the tests he and Pam had run, back when Dean was first admitted into Purgatory and Castiel stepped in out of necessity. But maybe the tests were wrong. Maybe he never knew what Dean needed to begin with.
“Thank god.” Castiel sighs in relief. “I’ll come check on you in a minute, okay? Just stay there.”
“Well yeah, I guess. But I didn’t come here to talk about Sam.” Dean shakes his head. “Sam is the good part of my life, okay?”
Dean gives a watery smile at the protective rumble. “‘Whoop ass’? Really, Bobby?” He shakes his head. “No, this isn’t about him. He’s been amazing, I just can’t stay there anymore. Things have changed.” He takes a deep breath and cringes at the pain in his chest again. “So, can I use the cabin? Is the key still by the wood pile?”
He feels lighter, happier. Free.

Okay we get some time with the boys and lots of healing coming. I think you will like the end, hope you are staying warm it is going to be negative 15 tomorrow during the day and holy hell that is just obscenely cold!!!! maybe I should just stay in and write lol.
“Sounds like Sam might be staying with us awhile?” Castiel asks, and looks between the two Winchesters.
Dean yells through the gag, bashing his head against Cain’s knee and trying to plead with him.
Dean flips over to his back, letting the late August sun warm his skin. It’s been the most peaceful summer he can remember. He’d even managed to convince Castiel to let him shoot off some fireworks for the Fourth of July. He doesn’t know why the alpha was in such a tizzy—he only
Hannah 12:08 PM <<
“Looking for a fight, boy? Well, I had a feeling this was coming. You haven’t submitted to me since the moment you got here.” Cain stalks closer to him.
Feeling properly foolish—but eagerly hoping he isn’t about to find out his imaginings of the whole situation are completely wrong—he’s halfway through a ten-step wiki guide when he hears the floorboards creak. He glances up and sees Dean in a pair of loose sweatpants and a t-shirt, holding a…
“Of course I do, but I can’t take that risk. I can make it through this. I've done it alone for years, this is just another heat. Don’t worry so much.” He manages to pat his brother's arm before he slides back low on the bed, his heat amping up again. As Sam gets up to leave he calls out to him. “Don’t tell him, Sam, about the bite.”
When Dean goes to the kitchen in search of food he notices the pasta bowls and wine glasses are on the drying rack next to the sink, and the table has been cleared. It’s as if last night never happened. He just wanted to do something nice for Castiel but he can’t even do that right.
Hours later, Dean hears the front door open and close and he nearly jumps up, but he forces himself to stay put, remains kneeling at the foot of Castiel’s bed, naked, palms resting open on his thighs.
“You didn’t have a safeword while you were with Alastair.”
Dean wraps himself around Castiel, burrowing into the comfort of his arms. His cock is half hard and he can feel Castiel’s own length poking at him when he shifts, but Dean is content to ignore his arousal and just relax with his boyfriend.
“Go kneel in the corner, facing the wall.”
I promise I am trying my hardest to find time to finish this story, but I kind of forgot about it for a bit and anyway, all of my writing time is taken up by the two book series I’m currently working on.
“Huh?”
Castiel raises an eyebrow at him. “Is it? How is it any different than any other title? ‘Master’ and ‘Sir’ are just titles that indicate respect, authority.”
He doesn’t know what he’ll do if Castiel rejects him now. Probably throw himself on the stage to be at Alastair’s mercy until he beats the life out of him.
Castiel agrees with a laugh and Dean takes the offered condom before pulling Castiel’s soft cock out of his underwear. He looks up at Castiel and licks a wet stripe up his palm before grasping him and stroking gently.
“So, what do you do for a living, Cas?” Dean asks, eyeing the suit Castiel is wearing.
“Cryptic much?” But Dean still shivers at the promise in Castiel’s voice. “Anyway, yeah, I consent to those rules or whatever. No lying and no touchin’ myself.” Though he is kind of tempted to break one of Castiel’s rules just to see how he’d be punished. And to quell the need coursing through him. A good, hard spanking sounds perfect right now.
Castiel grabs a bottle of juice from the fridge and then brings Dean to the living room where they lie on the couch together, Dean wrapped up in a thick blanket and Castiel rubbing his back.
The day after Castiel had texted and told Dean he’d bought a copy and was only a few chapters in but already could tell it was going to be a good one.
“I guess you don’t,” Dean smirks.
Dean pulls his phone from his pocket for the fifth time since he sat down at one of the tables near the door of the café. No new notifications. It’s only a quarter to two, but he’s still worried she won’t show.
Castiel shrugs. “I’ve never been a big movie buff.”
Dean cuddles closer, wrapping an arm around Castiel’s middle and resting his head against his chest. He starts to drift when Castiel’s voice rouses him.
Castiel hums and leans into the touch. “You’re very distracting.”
“Not all Doms do, but I think it’s important. It works the same; a signal that the play is over.”
“Cas, I’m so sorry that happened.”
“You always have the option to create a new family. Keep the people who care about you close and pay no mind to those who don’t. But it sounds to me like things with your family aren’t quite resolved. You might get some peace of mind if you had a conversation with your brother, at least.”
It only fuels Dean’s arousal. His dick twitches as he imagines Castiel here with him, dominating him, punishing him for touching himself without permission. Well, technically, he hasn’t broken any rules yet. He doubts that means he’ll get off scot-free, but he could stop here and feign innocence.
He listens to the ringing, drowned out by his heaving breathing.
He wishes he could withdraw into himself, into that small corner of his mind, as he feels ropes of warm come splatter on his body: his back, running down his side, along his thighs. It seemingly drives the man in his ass over the edge as he’s pumped full. The man pulls out and it drips out of him and mixes with the release running down his thigh.
They turn and stare at each other and Dean’s glad the lights are off because he’s positive he’s blushing the brightest shade of red. He takes a breath and closes the rest of the distance until their legs are pressed together. That simple contact sends a rush through Dean. His fingers tingle with it and he craves more.
“Basically, yes.”
“Don’t you dare!” Alastair’s voice cuts over the chatter of the audience as well as the wet noises and deep grunts Dean doesn’t want to think about. “If you so much as blink I will get my knife. You will watch this, or I will cut him every time I see your eyes closed. Take responsibility for your actions, Castiel.”
They hustle out of the room and down the hall. Castiel doesn’t hesitate, just pushes the door open and they’re embraced by the frigid night air, the alarm sounding loudly behind them, alerting Alastair and everyone else in the club of their escape.  They rush down the alleyway at the side of the building and out to the parking lot, slipping into Castiel’s car and speeding away from the club.
Dean tries. He tries to be good for his Master but his body won’t stop spasming as Alastair pushes the entire ice cube into his ass. “Please!” he gasps, “It’s too cold, please Master get it out, get it out, it hurts, it’s too cold.”
“Yes,” Castiel says, “I do.”
“Believe it or not, I don’t have the libido of a teenager.”
He wishes someone could make these decisions for him. He doesn’t think he’s ready to deal with rejection from Sam a second time if he does reach out to him now, but he can’t stop thinking about all the things he’s missed in his baby brother’s life over the years.
“Thank you,” Dean says when he’s finished eating. He’s both emotionally and physically exhausted and the granola bar sits like a stone in his stomach. All he wants to do is crawl into bed for a few days.
Dean’s eyes flick to the doorway.
“I think it’ll be a little hard to manoeuvre the kitchen with a Dean attached to my back.”
Dean immediately perks up, shuffling forward to get closer to Castiel’s crotch.
“God no. I’d be giving him the deed to my house before the night is through.”
“It was all right. I had a meeting with some new clients today. It went well which means my boss will get off my back for a few days, at least.” Castiel turns the volume of the TV down and shifts his attention from the screen to Dean. “You met with your friend today, right?”
Castiel drives Dean incoherent with pleasure and introduces just a hint of pain: biting or pinching or slapping him. It’s nowhere near enough as much pain as Dean can take, but the ache of having come so close to the edge only to be yanked away from it, again and again, is pain enough.
Castiel texts Dean while he’s cleaning.
“I know, I’m sorry, I just found out today.”
Castiel moves behind him and Dean fights the urge to follow the movement. He maintains his position, showing Castiel that he can follow orders.
“Friend is maybe a bit of an overstatement. She’s an acquaintance at best. I struggled with depression for a time and she was my counsellor.”
They sit in relative silence after that, the sounds of the restaurant washing over them and providing a comfortable ambience as they enjoy their meal.
“We’ll see.”
“Do you think after seeing how easily Charlie accepted you back maybe it’s also time to reach out to your family?”
“Thank you for the tea, but I really do need to get this work done before tomorrow to finalize a deal with a client who could bring in a lot of money for the company.”
“I can give you your powers back, make you my second,” Jack chimes.  “All I know is I’m not letting you stay here.  You did not deserve death.”
Dean tells himself to get to the point, already.  He takes a breath.
He places his hands on the floor.  He struggles to a standing position, stretching from sleeping on the floor.
“Stop,” Castiel frowns, “I don’t know what you’re talking about, Balthazar.”
“Dean,” Sam draws out a sigh in relief as he kneels, filling Dean’s vision, “we thought they had taken you too.”
The voice grows distant for a moment.  Dean exhales out of his mouth, the shakiness coming nowhere close to how he feels inside.
Castiel exhales warily.  “The only one I’m tired of is you.”
Castiel blinks and ignores them.
Whispers growing closer precede the formation of oily shadows.  Liquid forms into a blob of solid humanoid mass.  A hole meant to be a mouth lets out a series of hisses.
Staring at the hand, Castiel hesitates.  He tips his head up.  “I still don’t understand.”
He hates the hope that jumps out of his throat.  The belief that maybe, oh, just maybe-
Coughing and swatting dust away, Jack asks, “has no one really cleaned these?”
A figure wearing squeaky trainers kneels.  Jeans and a beige jacket come into view.
“Bullshit,” Balthazar repeats.
Why did Cas love him, again?  Because he cares about people.  Believes in them.  Never gives up hope.
Cas sees the good in Dean.  It’s too much for Dean to comprehend when he bathes in blood.
Dean looks away from them, messily getting to his feet.  “I can’t,” he gulps air, parched and emotional to his own ears, “I can’t right now.”
As Balthazar exits the office, Castiel is left alone again.  Emerald eyes with specks of gold hang behind his lashes.
The wave eats up the white void.  Cas keeps pace with Dean.  Sam and Eileen lead the way while Jack uses his powers to push the reapers back.
“Always,” Castiel replies, “always.”
A series of screeches reverberate off to the side.  Dean drops Cas’s hand as Cas turns in the same westward direction.
Dean wants to tell Cas everything.  He wants Cas to know the secrets he never told anyone else.  He wants Cas to know about his obsessions and fears and hopes and guilt and anger and love and-
Dean tears his eyes from the scene to give Sam and Eileen a moment of privacy.  Jack’s upbeat behavior, even after all this time, takes Dean aback.  He is glad that it is Jack who absorbed the power of God; no one else deserved it.
“He told me,” Jack murmurs down at Castiel, “he told me in a prayer what happened.”
And then, a wave of cold prickles his skin.  He releases a breath that he didn’t know he was holding.  Pinpricks of ice needle at his stubble.
At Jack’s innocent smile, Castiel sighs.  “I don’t know, Jack,” he says warily, “I don’t know.”
“That may be true,” Castiel says easily, “but we are meant to uphold Father’s philosophy.”
His jovial expression does nothing to indicate that Jack would proceed to whip out a sword glowing blue with angel grace.
Dean smiles easily, crow’s feet surely creeping around his eyes and mouth.  “Whatever you want.”
With a grip on his sword, Dean hops off the war room table.  He joins the gathering in the middle of the room.
Eileen crosses the area to swipe it up, Sam guarding her back.  He beheads a reaper that gets too close.
Jack sweeps his hands across the ceiling as if cleaning a car windshield.  The metal dome plating retracts at the silent command.
Balthazar takes the chair as Castiel rounds his desk.  His trench coat splays across the sides of the chair once he sits.
Dean studies Cas, examining for injuries.  When Cas simply smiles back, he advances.  Based on the way Sam, Eileen, and Jack mumble, they are unhurt as well.
“Balthazar is causing trouble again.”
When Dean glances to Jack for an explanation, he provides none.  The group observes the cloudy blue sky and gnarly tree branches around the edges of the dome.
The air is quiet.  No whistle enters Dean’s ears.
Light slivers pierce their vision, and they squint to accommodate for the sunshine.
Dean has to pause for a breath and uses it as an excuse to chug back what remains of his beer, grateful for the reprieve from talking.
“Dean, it’s all right. Whatever it is it’s going to be all right.”
, Dean chants in his head.
“Yes, Dean, exactly like that.”
“Well, seeing as you’re still able to form sentences I don’t believe my work is quite done yet.”
“Castiel and I have been friends our whole lives,” Meg says unprompted.
“During a scene, you will address me as Castiel. Agreed?”
It surprises Dean that Castiel went to a counsellor, and especially that he seems so open about it, as if it’s not something to be ashamed of.
Enjoy!
The small audience watches as his hips gyrate to the beat of the song. There are some whistles when he starts stripping slowly, teasingly. He knows how to work the crowd, how to touch himself suggestively as he moves his body, stripping down until all he wears is the pair of red panties he bought just for tonight. The feeling of the fabric against his skin and the way it hugs his curves, he knew the patrons would appreciate the way it makes his ass look.
“We’re going to the police station.”
“There, much better.” Alastair shifts behind him on the bed. “Spread your legs.”
When he opens his eyes he finds Castiel watching him intently, mere inches away. Dean jolts, almost falling off the stool.
Dean yanks on the sleeve of Castiel’s jacket to get his attention. “Let’s just leave.” He turns to Alastair, forces himself to look him in the eye and not back down. “In case it wasn’t obvious: I’m through with your shit, okay? We’re done, so you can fuck off now.”
He opens his eyes when he feels a hand grip his wrist lightly. The panicked look on Castiel’s face makes his stomach clench and sends a wave of guilt washing over him. Didn’t he just decide that he wanted to protect Castiel? An hour later and he’s already broken that promise by hurting Castiel himself.
Dean’s brushing his teeth, staring at his blank face in the mirror when a large bruise on his hip catches his attention. His reflection turns and he watches as more dark bruises are revealed. They trail from his hips to his back and reach down past his ass to the backs of his thighs.
“How is that any different from what I have now?”
“That was over an hour ago.”
“I’m sorry,” Dean repeats. That’s all he can say, “Sorry, sorry, sorry,” coming out of his mouth in a constant chant.
“I care about you so much, Dean,” Castiel whispers as he leans in for a kiss.
“No, no, I’ll use it. I will.”
Castiel takes his time with the final spanks. He kneads the burning flesh of Dean’s ass in his palms. It hurts
They come across an elderly man standing in a little clearing off to the side of the path. He raises an open palm and is immediately greeted by a round, yellow bird. It chirps and eats the seed from the man’s hand. A squirrel dashes out from the brush and grabs the seed the bird drops on the ground.
Castiel hums in thought as he looks at Dean. “We’ll see if you feel the same way after we deal with your punishment.”
