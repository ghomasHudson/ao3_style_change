Dean continued, “but he...you forget he was ever chugging the god squad kool-aid, you know?” He snorted airily, though the drunken mist seemed to go right back inside his nose. “Hell, half the time I forget how long he was around before us.”
“Pushy, pushy. Fine, here ya go.”
A waitress comes by at some point, and they all order dinner. Dean thanks her, then turns back to the conversation he’d been having with Cas. “C’mon, seriously?
he was nothing. That deep down, he was exactly what Alaistair always told him he was. A monster. A
Sam almost feels bad for Dean.
I know it’s not.”
Not possible. The basis of Dean’s whole understanding of their relationship is that Cas doesn’t want the same things he does,
With the exception of Cas himself, of course.
At this, Cas twitched, if only slightly.
“Well, uh...sure, Dean,” the younger brother said, pulling out his phone, and pressing record on the camera. “Cas is one of the best friends we’ve ever had.”
Just like, I've imagined
Across the room, Dean looked to his right to find the blue of Cas’s eyes fixed solely on his own, those azure depths so sincere and so full of
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean grumbles, cleaning up the table to avoid the inevitable. “Alright. No one likes a sore winner.”
“Bigger spoon...can hold the most pie?” Dean attempted one last time, and Cas simply smiled, gently shaking his head.
Dean noted the step back and grinned wider, his teeth still stained pink with his own blood. “Look at you, gettin’ all hot and bothered. Don’t worry, I don’t bite.” The smile took on a feral edge. “Not ‘til I get to second base, anyway.”
But the final page of Castiel’s first sketchbook was a depiction of two silver utensils balanced atop one another; an angel’s reflection woven into the spoon that had raised the other one from the ground, only to find a whole new world awaiting him.
“What are you saying, Cas?” Dean whispered, his question a ragged breath, his mind leaking smoke from the cracks that were still racing through it.

“Nah, it’s just wasteful packaging,” Dean told him, working at the last of the tape without looking up at his brother. “Come on, bring one of those over. The stuff’ll fit.”
Cas took a tiny, shuffling step back. He didn’t know what the demon was doing.
to only mildly disgruntled as he turns to look at Dean. “One of the pool tables just opened up. You up for a game or two?”
“Yes,” Cas told him, briefly shivering beneath the woolen weave of his winter cap as he fumbled to zip up the last one of his coats. “The woman at the bus station where I got off was very helpful.”
It's not what, good sons do
“Here you guys go!” Nina called out, handing them two to-go cups with festive lace printed over the lids, likely designed by Nina herself. “The one on the right’s extra peppermint.”
Caleb, Kamala and Nina all howled in delight, and Dean was in shock, unsure if he’d sure heard that correctly.
But all of a sudden, it
Cas inclines his head. “That was impressive. Good game.”
Bonus Ending:
Which. Okay. It could be worse. But Dean goes bright red as soon as he makes eye contact with his brother. “Where— where’d the dickbag go?”
He cut off his thoughts, and made an affronted noise in reply, then glanced over at where Kamala had taken back her device and quickly shuffled across the living room floor to Nina- the two women (as well as Laur) beginning to point and giggle at something hidden from view. The word
“Bi-” he stammered, blinking and leaning in closer. “Big spoon,

Oh, the
Dean met his gaze, and inside him, the smoke
He clears his throat. “Nevermind, then. Bragging rights’ll do, I guess.” He slaps on a winning smirk. “Don’t worry, I promise I won’t hustle you.”
“Traitor,” Dean said. “You knew I wanted to sleep in today.”
Cas stood as he did, holding his ground.
When Cas finally cut off the flow of grace, his breathing was heavy and ragged, and he was slumped against Dean as much as Dean was slumped against him.
I got so brave, drink in hand
And— c’mon. He
So it’s less of a surprise and more of a foregone conclusion when Cas makes a good run of it at the end, pocketing his last three balls and then the eight ball with fluid, self-satisfied ease. Dean puts down his cue. “Dammit.”
Before he’d finally gotten to stop.
Dean waited for Cas to clarify what it was that he
Cas raises an eyebrow. “Currently, yes. She has incredible range and a very strong voice. By all accounts, she is a talented musician.” He inclines his head like he’s telling them a secret.
And then their lips met, at long last…
Yeah, I've denied it for a while
Dean, still holding the phone as his recorded, slurring voice began to stumble over the words
“Idiot. Alright, I’ll let her know. Now scram, get out of here. You’re scaring the tourists, and I’m sure you’re dying to show Castiel around.” She looked at Cas, smiling at his reddened cheeks once again. “You’ve got yourself a good one in him, my friend,” she told him. “I, for one, hope to see you around.”
“And I you,” Cas breathed once they pulled away, his heart somehow spinning as though it were ascending to heights greater than his wings had ever taken him. “Would you...would you go to dinner with me, tonight?”
It turned out he really could enjoy them after all.
The Mark hummed over his forearm as if in testament to his words, and his eyes pressed shut, trying to keep the whispers of the darkness away.
getting it in. Cas is waiting patiently on the other side of the table, a tiny smirk pulling at the corner of his mouth.
It should’ve been enough. The same way whatever this thing they have should’ve been enough, ever since it’d emerged in the heat of a looming Apocalypse. Dean had tried out a couple different labels over the years: “ally” was hilariously short-lived, because he and Cas were both… well, anyone could see they were more intense than that. Casual was never really an option in this situation. They cared too damn much. (But still, still, not enough). “Friend” lasted longer, but Cas wan’t just a friend; they’d become something else over the years, metamorphosing under the push and pull of pain and death and fear. Not quite family the way Sam was, but more than a buddy. And it was… it was fine. It was good, and it
is what he wanted.
badly, Sam sighs. “Fine,” he relents. “You’re right, it’s… it’s getting kind of ridiculous. They’re… I dunno, stuck or something. So. Go ahead, I guess. Do your worst.” But then Sam points a finger at Crowley, his face dark. “But you’re not allowed to hurt him.
after that shitshow of a hunt, so there is no way in
Dean promised to do just that, and then got back in the Impala, heading back to the Bunker with the midday sun beginning to rise over his head.
“I love you, Dean Winchester,” Cas whispered. “I want to spend the rest of my life with you.”
Cas just looked at him, for so long Dean wasn’t sure he was going to say anything at all. But then he blinked, eyes roaming over Dean’s face, and his voice was quiet, soft in all the ways that it had only ever been in Dean’s dreams.
Cas smiles innocently. “I don’t believe so. After all, I understand your appreciation of Taylor Swift just fine.”
Cas smiled. “We would’ve eaten tonight, regardless. But if you say yes, we simply get to do it with more...fun.”
with even more prejudice than he’d levied at the ones from his original stint in Hell. He didn’t want it, he told himself, like he was afraid that if he stopped saying it he’d stop believing it. He didn’t want it.
He already knows this game is gonna be a shitshow before he even makes his first shot. He’s not wrong: his rapidly deteriorating concentration is completely gone five minutes in, after an attempt at distracting both himself and Cas backfires spectacularly. It hadn’t even been that good of a heckle, but he’d said it right before Cas was about to make his shot. Cas had stopped, still bent over the table, and looked up at Dean through his lashes, one eyebrow raised demandingly. He hadn’t even had to
Dean at last fell asleep, and Sam quietly stood to mark the video’s end.
He checked his watch, and looked up to the passerbyers walking down the street, scanning the faces for the one he was really waiting for. When he found the familiar bundle of jackets, the soft smile just beneath the nape of a chill-bitten nose, he stood up, and his grin was ear-to-ear.
Cas didn’t move, and neither did Dean: and the hunter had to question whether what they had had ever
Cas’ hair is even more messed up that usual when they break apart, and Dean’s pulse is through the roof.
Hell. This would do
did this evening get so complicated so fucking fast?
Idly, he shook out his hand, examining the glittery flecks of glass stuck to the torn skin on his knuckles. Then he brought it up to his mouth, running his tongue over the blood and viscera without ever once breaking Cas’ gaze.
Dean had no such qualms.
But this burn, the burn of grace, of
Laur gave Cas’s shoulder a squeeze, and then slipped into the kitchen, leaving the two men alone together.
is your favourite?
he’d forgotten, but Crowley—
And Cas breathed in that confession of a noise, smoothed his thumbs delicately over Dean’s cheeks, and all Dean could do was kiss him back; tears still streaming down his face, his hands fisted helplessly in Cas’ shirt. He could taste the blood he'd drawn, still pooling on the angel's torn lip.
Dean sputtered in spite of himself, his resolve cracking but his frustration only growing. Who the hell was this— this
At this, the Winchester glanced over at Cas, whose delicate movements: just a shift in the rotation of the shoulder here or a contented tap of the foot there, truly were a graceful sight in the midst of their colorful chaos.
“That’s it,” Dean grits out, and propels Cas away from the table as Sam snickers at their retreating backs. “I hope you can foot the bill, asshole!”
You need to— Cas,
I kissed you Cas, and I liked it
"Thank you for coming, Cas. I mean it."
“Our dog. Stray one we adopted a year ago more or less, sleeps in Jack’s room so you’ll see her quite soon.”
“Go on then.”
“Yes, but it’s brief. Though you know, I think Donne had a point.”
The weather too contributes in the creation of a microcosm: if Castiel were at home, then the streets would be found empty and all the houses would have light filtering through the drawn curtains, silence and immobility, the end of the day, people getting ready to go to sleep or taking advantage of the quietness to be alone with their thoughts for another five minutes - sitting in their armchairs with a book, or the day's crosswords, a glass of something as their only company. But he isn't home and there's something about Dean's cottage, away from everything and everyone, if only at night, that makes it feel like a safe space, a different place, a place that likes him as much as he likes it. Warm and welcoming, with its heath fire and ugly tapestry, with the wooden bench that is the only dreg of Dean's job as a glassblower. A time long gone, though Castiel remembers all the many a thousand evenings spent in Dean's company, watching him work - the concentration on Dean's face, his fingers moving skillfully and with care, with infinite patience, to create something new. Hands with a new purpose, creating something rather than destroying it.
"I'm just they all made it, that's all. I'd say she's too old for her first litter, but she simply had to go whoring around at the ripe age of six," Dean jokes.
“Good night, Jack.”
He remains there for a little while longer before picking up Jack’s teddy and putting it back in its place.
“Are you hungry?” asks Dean. “I can cook you something.”
“Alright. I thought so. This way.”
"Busy day tomorrow?" asks Dean.
Daringly, he kisses Dean again, running the tip of his tongue over his lips and the kiss deepens - tenderly, languidly, gently. Kissing as the French do. Wantonly. Wet and slippery muscle against wet and slippery muscle.
One day, Dean will leave. They are friends though in the intricacies of life it always seemed as if there was a different category, perfectly sealed off from everyone else, friends and the two of them, and in his dreams, sometimes, this odd friendship transmutes into something, gaining clarity and he allows himself to
"Cas, I'm here," Dean says plainly.
“Do you think he'll be angry?”
His name sounds foreign on Dean's lips, for the first time in years, altered, with a different meaning. His ears may be deceiving him because of his own wishful thinking, but the first part of that sentence! Castiel swallows. New, different and unfamiliar, what a strange and anticipated unexplored territory. He'd never dare do anything, say anything to ruin it. Impose himself and his desires and profound wishes.
“Feeling better?”
“Leaving this place. But I do feel ready to do so, feel like the best time.”
“Dean, we have time. We have all the time we want to talk about what you did and didn’t do. I don’t care, not now anyway. I’m just happy to be here. The rest will follow. The weight of the world doesn’t rest on your shoulders, you know. I’m not saying that it won’t take time, but it’ll be alright. Eventually.”
“Signs?”
Flesh and bones, both of them. Real. The habit of separation is cumbersome, leaving them at loss with each other, difficult to discard. Love, perhaps, buried beyond their reach.
“About any of this.”
The world outside has been reduced to an infinite expanse of mist that started to ascend the moment he stepped out of his car, veterinary bag in is hand, all but slamming the car door behind him, and started walking on the wet gravel driveway to the main door with his hand already half-raised, ready to knock. Now, darkness has become the universe and the small and uneven country road that meanders itself across a sea of grass, the ground as hard as iron, amidst the naked trees that tower themselves against the sky, is now relatively useless. Vision impaired by the mist that at the beginning of the evening appeared silver and with an exact eye or the eye of an artist, with streaks of warmer colours and delicate reflections of dark shadows, ten-foot-high or more and impenetrable. The dark elms, the small brick walls on the sideway, with their patches of moss and ruined and crumbling mortar, the hedgerows, the ancient place of worship with its distinctive bell tower, and the milestones all hidden, swallowed up, disappearing until morning.
"I should go," says Cas, breathless, his voice panic-stricken, abruptly stepping away as the full realization of his actions settles. "I'm sorry, Dean, I didn't mean to... I like you, Dean, you're decent and this is rotten- I mean, not really, it is my life, not rotten business, but-"
When Dean turns around, walking away once again, Cas removes the stopper and lets the water travel down the drain before taking the showerhead, quickly rinsing his skin from any residual soap and then cleaning the white surface of the tub itself from any dust and mud, leaving it as spotless as he found it.
Dean kisses him again, patiently and yearning, pulling him close. Tentatively at first, a great deal of hesitance painting his movements, and then with more honesty and passion, basking in the feeling of satisfaction and hunger. They had been apart for too long, longer than that excruciating year in the Empty, tracing way back - victims of small talk, both of them, something standing between them preventing them from talking freely and with complete honesty. Wool against cotton. They touch each other with care and no rush at all, each movement gentle and infinite and painted with disbelief, a dilation, anticipation of a future entirely possible, until they settle for Cas’s head is buried in the crook of Dean’s neck and Dean’s arms are around him, holding him close. Comfort, reassurance, protection, love.
"My- dear fellow," Dean replies, stepping forward. He places his glass back on the table, untouched, Castiel mirrors his actions - the amber liquid oscillates slightly at such a sudden movement. "Cas."
“I’m here.”
“Hold me,” Cas whispers. His voice falters as he breathes in slowly and comes out as a muffled sound against Dean’s skin. “And never let me go.”
Trying to drive back would be a nuisance: a perfectly logical explanation for Castiel's desire not to leave, for this evening not to come to an end, for the last moments to stretch themselves towards infinity and beyond, company lasting for the rest of his life.
Shadows dancing, Castiel looks at the spectacle of colours a little while longer. He's about to get up when Dean places his hand on his shoulder, resting it there. It's different, something about it feels different - lingering, calculated, done on purpose, anything but a mistake. Castiel tries to think of something else, tries to ignore it, but Dean's touch is gentle and grounding, all he wants to do is lean into it. Not the first nor the last time for it to happen, but he's been rather clear-headed as of late and the smallest of things turns into something exaggeratedly big.
“Good.”
Back to us. This.
“I want to wake up next to you every morning. I want a life with you and it can be as friends or-”
“Miracle?”
“If you get out of your clothes, I’ll put them through the wash.”
He does as he’s being told. His shoes are definitely dirtier than theirs and he places them next to a pair of rain boots with a bee pattern printed on them. Standing next to each other, they look like a complete picture - three pairs of shoes next to the door. It starts now, he thinks, with three pairs of shoes next to a door and a kiss: They can resume and simply be. History restarting at once with an ending mixed with a beginning.
and didn't care. Life mediated by literature, a means of self-discovery to be taken advantage of from a safe distance without exposing oneself or showing oneself to be vulnerable.
“No, thank you.”
“We tried to make him stop but… Listen, you’ll find out eventually and I might as well tell you myself. When you… Died. When the Empty took you, I wanted to move on for Jack’s sake. Saving you was a stretch and with everything that happened- Hell, even when I did go into the Empty it didn’t feel real. It wasn’t. Not- I don’t know. Like you raising me from perdition or something. I did lose hope, Cas, thought I’d never see you again. Jack didn’t.”
“I...have class, Dean,” he says, and I look at him in confusion.
Dean stared at Castiel, who looked back breathing hard – a slight blush decorating his cheekbones.
“Forfeit?” Cas asked.
“Stop! You incessant, stubborn little,” Cass noticed Dean’s eyes move towards his lips.
Hi. One long chap got ya dudes
“Well?” Cas asked.
Cas laughed, taking the cigarette from me and taking the last drag, throwing the filter to the ground “In his defense, he did find you with your tongue down my throat in the locker room.”
“Dean!” Sam stopped his pacing and turned.
“I’ll give you a clue,” he says, “She has red hair and hates my guts.”
She has no
“Shut up,” Dean groaned, grabbing Castiel’s neck and bringing his lips to his own. He moaned into the kiss when Castiel’s fingers massaged his nipples. Cas moved from Dean’s mouth to his jaw, sucking – kissing – biting in perfect rhythm. Dean eyes were fixed on Castiel – pupil blown and shining as his mouth made involuntary noises in sync with Castiel’s kisses. Cas was storing those sounds somewhere in his brain, to play on loop again and again.
Dean laughed. His fingers typing out a response.
I take pictures of my first class seats. I take pictures of the food and the coffee. Bella takes a picture of her feet near my face. Balthazar takes pictures Bella constantly. Gabe tries to take pictures that end up blurry. We all post what Dean tells us to post.
“Castiel, we shouldn’t,” Dean said, knowing full well that he was in a place where anyone could walk in. the chances were slim – no one even came inside this room. The kids outside were so wasted they’d probably pee on the tables. But still…they could walk in.
“Well, I told you something happened.”
Dean flinched –
“I’m fucked.” He whispered under his breath.
“What? Anna, no. I like
“He isn’t home, Dean. I don’t know where he is.”
“Is a
“And you’re not,” she says, more to herself than to me. I roll my eyes at her and sweep her to me. Kissing her with the taste of Cas still on my tongue. She tries to lift up my shirt but I shake my head slightly. If she does that, she’ll see the mark Cas left on my shoulder. The boy bites there when he comes. She’ll see, and I can’t have that, now can I?
“Really, Feathers?” he asked, the razor-sharp intent behind his words cloaked in a thin veneer of teasing lightness. “You act like you’ve never heard this from your
Dean breathed, slow and deep.
This is Nep comin' at you this week, and Emrys and I are really excited to finish this guy up. We've been sucked into it for the past couple months, so finally sharing it has been a lot of fun! We love a good angry mob. We've been thinking, though, that it might be fun to add a bonus chapter of a bunch of inspiration we used in this fic. Sound off in the comments if you're interested! We've got SO MUCH meta and song lyrics and poetry to shove in there XD
Then, with a slow grin, the demon spread his arms and moved ever so slightly forward. “But me?” he asked. “I’ve been cooped up for way too damn long, watching him choke, watching nothing but failed shots and missed opportunities over and over again. I may think the OG you miss so much has crap taste in lifestyle, but I can agree with him on one thing.” His gaze turned dark and hungry. “I’d be
How was this in, the cards, to-night
he thought, his frustration and weariness leaving him balanced on a hair-trigger. Over half a decade, through literal hellfire and Purgatory and everything in between, he’d kept his shit together.
and then—
They stood there in silence, the shock permeating the air almost palpable. Dean was wound tighter than a spring, tense and coiled, hovering somewhere between fight and flight and the world of emotion neither one could take from him any longer. He watched Cas, and he waited. For a word, an expression,

But for now, at least, Dean was awake and in control. So that comment got summarily stomped down into some dark corner in the back of his brain and

“Shut up,” Sam muttered. “You found jasmine-scented conditioner in the mail one time, and it was because it was a free add-on to some of my regular stuff.” His cheeks briefly reddened. “I mean, yes, I used it, but that was because I didn’t want it to go to waste.”
Dean shook the thoughts from his head. Then, because he’d crushed way too much Jack Daniel’s earlier (and because he was painfully aware that he’d just asked Cas to… hang around? To stay the night?
“Did you mean it?” Cas asked, his voice little more than a whisper.
“Get what, Dean?” Sam asked, having lost track of the winding stream of inebriated thoughts long ago.
Then Dean
“I loved you enough to rebel against Heaven, enough to die. And every time I was forced from your side, every time I was led astray, I loved you enough to come
“Merry Christmas, Dean,” Cas murmured, resting his head on Dean’s shoulder.
Sam’s mouth falls slightly open. “I’m sorry. You wanna do
So if Dean had to push Cas away to make sure that didn’t happen, that the angel who’s saved him more times than he could count didn’t get sucked back into his black hole again, you could bet your ass that was exactly what he was going to do. Because he was the
“So…” Rowena asked, breaking the contemplative silence. “Did you get it on video?”
“Well, well, well. Hello, boys. Fancy meeting you here.”
Like maybe he wasn’t just entertaining a former demon whose weak, emotional, pitiable soul he couldn’t bring himself to deny.
Dean was beyond the point of lashing out, beyond the point of truly asserting himself at all; and Cas was suddenly, fervently glad he’d stayed.
Without a word, Sam holds up his glass. After all, it’s not often a deal with a devil turns out in his favour.

he whispered, his voice a guileless plea. “Come back to me.”
But without further ado, here you go: my original parody, and the baby seedling that inspired the chaos-soaked text wall that you just read to get here.
The corner of Cas’ mouth twitches mischievously. “Yes. I believe I can.”
“Well,” Cas began, looking at his other half with an even gaze. “Dean is slightly taller than I am.”
And the words for

“Damn right it is,” Dean says smugly as Cas starts to set up the next game. “Are we gonna play for more shots this time?”
And god, if Dean was slightly more confident with guys and this wasn’t
dance of repression and hormonal angst for so long.” He leans in, a magnanimous, normally repulsive expression on his face. “In the name of those moronic lovebirds finally doing away with all their melodramatic ridiculousness... you owe me no favours, Sam Winchester. Well,” he amends, “no more than you do already, anyway.”
As far as Caleb was concerned, it was a good place to end a year.
He pulled up his messages, and tapped on the contact for Cas, attaching the recording he’d just made and waiting for it to load.

And what the
The adults made themselves comfortable at the water’s mouth, Cas and Sam having risen to a light debate over whether this fairly inconspicuous body of water qualified in some places as a river or perhaps some other semantic form, when Dean lightly cleared his throat, and Cas looked up toward him.
Sam and Cas look up at Dean’s pronouncement, the former from a book and the latter from his phone.
how the guilt pressed down on him, like the weight of the world he didn’t feel he deserved to be in. Cas kept still and silent, simply trying to be there; he didn’t know what he could do. He wasn’t even sure that Dean wanted him here. But leaving him like this, as vulnerable as he was… that was not an option.
“And while I’m at it,” Dean continued, ignoring the nephilim’s confusion, “I’ll pick up whatever shampoo you’re tryin’ out this week from the post, Sam.” Dean took a swig of his coffee around a smug grin. “Let me guess, uh, lavender-vanilla scented this time? Roses? A nice luxurious peaches-and-cream?”
into his ear.
Cas could almost feel his heartstrings pull.
and he was pouring it all into Dean through the soft press of his mouth.
Bonjour, our poor, abused readers. Behold the second part of this monster! (lmao)
They touched for only a moment.
Finally, after a little luck and some good shots, he’s down to the eight ball. But he stares down at the table, frowning hard, because
Cas raises an eyebrow. “Very well. I’ll hold you to that.”
Dean?” Cas asked, trying to step closer, but Dean flinched, gripping his forearm close to his chest like he didn’t trust what his hands might reach out and start to do.

"Yeah, Cas?" Dean groggily answered, subtly pulling Cas closer to him as if in protest of the notion of getting up. “You wan’ anoth’r blanket, or something?”
Cas grins. “That is a good point.”
Dean fights the urge to let out a despairing, slightly hysterical laugh at that, because
Dean gapes. Cas raises an eyebrow, and Dean closes his mouth. “I— yeah? I was joking, dude.”
“Don’t look at me like that, man. Your buddies over at the pool table bought ‘em for ya.”
But maybe putting a delay on things hadn’t been the best idea.

“Maybe we should be,” Laur teased, from when she and Nina were nestled together on the beanbag they’d dragged next to the sofas. “You really do still have that baby-face look, you know.”

“Bigger spoon’s the shinier one—” Dean tried, but the renewed sight of Cas’s azure eyes glinting as if with the remnants of angel grace shut him right up.
He’s doing a weird kind of shimmy to try and untangle the sleeves, cursing out his stupid shirt under his breath, when Cas’ hand lands on his arm. The bare skin of his arm, below where the sleeve of his t-shirt cuts off. Dean bites back a gasp, his eyes landing on Cas’ face and staying there.
Dean looked at Cas as if surprised, mentally replaying what had come out of his mouth, but he only smiled shyly, a slight grin peeking out from beneath the reddish tone of his cheeks. “Yeah, Cas,” he said. “Ours...if you want it.”
The shadow wearing Dean’s face walked around the angel, never once looking away, and stopped when he reached the chair that Cas had abandoned in his rush to fly to Dean’s side. He dusted it off and spun it around to sit down from the opposite side, letting the back press against the span of his chest.
Across the room, Cas looked up sharply. But Dean wasn’t in any position to notice.
“No,” he repeated, his face on fire and his eyes wide, but unable,
Crowley observes him for a moment through slitted eyes, as if calculating just what to say to prove his trustworthiness in this matter. (Or, more accurately, trying to decide what would best get through the thick, shaggy skull of the moose sitting in front of him.) “You know, that summer your brother was a demon—”
Cas smirks at him, wide and gummy. “I told you I’d win this time.”
“Looking into your eyes before Sam cured you was a shock,” Cas went on, ignoring Dean’s insistences. “I have held your soul in my grace, Dean. I bore you up from the flames of Hell with your battered face pressed into my wings, and I’ve seen every single facet of the light that lies within you. So when you were a demon, I knew every fold of personality that the Mark’s taint had twisted and amplified, every emotion that had been stifled in favor of the things that haunt you. I could see the things that convinced you you were empty until you had no choice but to believe it. But Dean, when I look at you now…” Cas reached out, letting his fingers just brush Dean’s cheek in what amounted to only the barest of touches. And yet, Dean gasped like Cas had taken him in both hands and pulled him close. “I see no demon. No evil.” Cas’ voice had dipped in volume, but his soft, almost achingly honest promise tugged inexorably at the soul in front of him. “Nothing that could ever make me, or Sam, or
Cas, and no matter what it is, it doesn’t end well for you.”
"Huh," he remarked, when it was passed into his hands. "Bigger than I thought it would be."
The angel stared at the black screen in his hands, none of his thoughts able to tell him what to do next.
“No,” Cas rasped, taking a step back. “No, it can’t…”
The rest of the day passed with little activity, overall, so Dean was alone in his room when Cas finally arrived at the bunker that evening.
It was the best way to start a season of growth that he ever could have conceived.
For a moment, it’s great. Cas’ nose is kinda smushed up against his, and despite an uncomfortable moment where their teeth almost clack together Dean’s so hopped up on terror and adrenaline that he just bluescreens right past his hang-ups, because it’s
Dean’s face aimed up toward the ceiling, and while Castiel couldn’t say whether or not he wanted to keep watching, he found that he couldn’t look away.
Whatever his little demon had been angling for, Dean wouldn’t be getting it tonight.
God help him, because Dean… Dean realized he wanted
Jack laughed, the notion of the Dean he’d known in the midst of supernatural war now being undone by something as simple as a draft hitting against his side making him smile in a way he was happy to be getting used to.
It felt so right
like, how the sloping curve of his jaw would fit into the palm of Dean’s hand, the only thing he could think about right now?
"I know Dean." Cas said without moving and holding his gaze.
"Well Cas, that was... uh..." Dean started, finding himself at a loss for words. "Well I think I'm gonna be sitting funny for a couple days"
"Actually" Dean said, grabbing his phone "I think it's time for the cookies to come out of the oven. Why don't you take the expert out in the kitchen and see what he thinks."
Cas slides a hand between Dean's legs wrapping his fingers around his cock, slowly stroking the soft flesh back to attention. Dean's wrist pull against his binds, wanting to flip around and take control. "Too slow Cas... mmmm ... please" Dean begs hitching his hips into Cas' hand before pressing his ass back into his mouth, eager for more.
"So church huh?" Castiel asked.
I just wanna be loved by you"
Castiel pulled his bottom lip in between his teeth and nodded "Ok Dean, I'll stay" Castiel was half way down the hallway when he felt a hand on his shoulder that stopped him and turned him around. Before he could even process what was happening Dean pressed his entire body up against him, their mouths colliding and then moving together gently.
"I don't care about our ages Mr. Novak. I think I am in love with you. I don't want anyone new, I just want you." Dean set the bag down and moved in closer to Castiel, he stood about chest high and he wrapped his arms around Castiel and pulled him into a hug.
"Really Cas? I think its time we listened to something else. You are so hung up on one song, when theres so much more out there." Dean sighs, taking a hold of Cas' wrist and leads him out of the kitchen.
Dean shrugged, "I've rented the room for a month, I figured that would give you enough time to look for an apartment, which you should. You can stay here, but in the long run, an apartment will be cheaper for you Cas. I asked, the Gas and Sip is only a couple blocks away, so you can walk to work. I'm gonna go get washed up before getting back on the road."
How Dean sank to his knees before him, lifting his leg over his shoulder before sucking his cock into his mouth, taking him down in one swallow. Leaving Cas so lost in his desire that he had to grab Dean by the hair just to be sure he didn't fall over. How Dean's dirty little mouth was able to make him feel so much pleasure that he was left speechless above him, moaning incoherently. Dean pulling him out of his mouth, licking lower until his tongue runs over Cas' sensitive opening, teasing only briefly before pushing a long digit into him making Cas gasp, tightening his fingers in Dean's hair. Dean stretching and opening him up until he begged Dean to "fuck me". How Dean looked at him with burning passion as he stood up, slamming their mouths together with a growl. Fingers digging deep into his ass as he rolls their hips together, Cas' sensitive cock rubbing against the course denim of Dean's jeans. "Dean" he moaned into his mouth and Dean pulled back eyes wild with lust, just before...
Dean couldnt help the smile that stretched his lips. "Yea Cas, that would be fine. Here let me set it up so it will continually play the same song. That way you don't have to keep pressing play." Dean put the song on repeat and showed Cas what button to push to get it started. He also got up and changed the buds out for his good head phones. "Here Cas, these are what I wear when I listen to music as I'm going to sleep. They're durable, so don't be afraid to fall asleep with them on." Dean handed them to Cas.
When he reached Dean's room he saw the clothes that he had left laying on the bed.  Castiel sat down on the edge of the bed for a moment. Trying to wrap his head around the events of the last 12 hours. When he had stopped by last night, he hadn't thought that he would be still here in the morning, let alone everything else that had happened,  and most certainly not the promise of what was yet to come this day. He felt his heart swell in his chest, he didn't know that this was what he wanted. Dean, yes, of course he wanted Dean. Those feelings had been developing for awhile, but he thought they were purely physical. Dean was a gorgeous specimen, those green eyes and those perfect lips. The way his tongue rested just behind his slightly parted teeth when he smiled...  Oh and those crinkles around his eyes... Not to mention, the man has an amazing ass... Castiel sighed. But these other feelings revolved around Dean as a dad. The way he was when Darla was around, so open and loving. That little girl was his everything, and now he was sharing that part of his life with Castiel. Waking up this morning and sharing in the joys of Christmas morning with them. That was more than he could have hoped for,  and he would be lying if he said he wasn't hoping for many more years of it.
When it came to his feelings for the angel who called himself Castiel, it was never even a question for Dean Winchester.  It was instantaneous, he didn’t have to think about it, it was just there, those feelings, the emotion, the connection, it just was. What did come into question for Dean was that he didn’t believe he was worthy of Cas’ love, the devotion that the angel seemed to give so willingly, Dean felt he didn’t deserve that. Cas was too perfect, he was too pure, and Dean felt he would just muddy that, and he would never be able to forgive himself if that happened.
"Hmmm? " Castiel moaned, "No Dean, you are the amazing one" he leaned forward and kissed him.
Dean chuckled before grabbing the back of Castiel's head and pulling him into a deep kiss. "I'm going to devour you later. I hope you know that." he sighed
"Ok Cas, we'll stick to Zeppelin, since you obviously already like them." Dean sits up on the bed against the headboard and presses the shuffle button on the remote. Robert Plant's voice comes through the speakers, and Dean can hardly believe it. "And if I say to you tomorrow. Take my hand, child, come with me."
The second half I've it happened, it really wasn't his fault. Sam and Dean had arrived at the scene of a rather gruesome death. After showing the local authorities their identification, they were let through the door to the room where the bloody body was.  Cas was already there, talking with the local sheriff when he noticed them walk in. Sam and Dean walked over to him as the sheriff walked away. After a quick greeting Castiel filled them in on what the sheriff believed was the cause of death, turning with Sam to look at the body, and 'WHOOF' suddenly Dean had a face full of feathers. He reached his hands up to push them away, feeling the small tingles of electricity as he did so.  Mesmerised once again but the magnificence of them, the quick scramble turned into soft petting, letting his fingers run deeply through the plumage down to the arching bone once more, feeling the warmth and vibration as he tightened his fingers. He wondered how this felt to Cas, and also briefly wondered if anyone else could see how amazing his wings were. He couldn't always see them, but every now and then there they were. It suddenly dawned on him that he was talking an awful long time running his fingers through the silver feathers. He looked around the room, but no one even seemed to notice. Dean felt a small shudder run through the wings and he quickly let go, taking a step back. The sounds of the room flooded his ears as Sam and Cas turned around to face him. Curiosity began to bloom as he noticed the pink flush to Castiel's ears again. 'interesting' he thought, a playful notion came to mind as he wondered just how much Cas could take of this.
"Where do your parents think you are at 10:30 on a Wednesday night?" Dean inquired, now he felt really only. Where had his care-free days gone? He was only 27, and here he was being worried about a couple of 17 year olds being out late.
"Hello Dean" Cas said, his voice still rough from sleep"
"uh Cas?"
Cas thrusts hard and deep into Dean as he feels his orgasm coming on. He locks eyes with the beautiful green eyed boy as he feels the pressure building inside him. His breath hitches at the same time as his hips and he thrusts once more deep inside of Dean "nungh.... Ah.. Ah.... Ahhhhhh! Dean! Ohhhh!" he cries out as his orgasm rips through his body. He burries his head into the crook of Dean's biting down on the tender skin as he comes inside him. Dean let's out a deep groan, hitching his own hips up. As Cas catches his breath he looks up into Dean's eyes, seeing the desperation for his own release. He licks his way down his body, his softening cock pulling out of Dean. He pulls off the condom, knotting it and tossing it in the trash before turning his attention to Dean's thick swollen red cock. He runs his tongue teasingly over the head before wrapping his lips around it and taking him into his mouth completely. Dean writhes under him "p.. Please Cas... I.. I gotta.... Ungh....." he begs. Cas wraps his hand tightly around the base of his cock as he pulls the ring off. He looks up at Dean's face. "ready tiger?" he asks flicking his tongue over the slit gathering the precum that had worked it's way out. Dean nods furiously, desperately, his bottom lip caught between his teeth. Cas smirks "give it to me" he says wrapping his lips around his cock, his hand letting go of the base. Dean let's out a primal cry as his orgasm tears through his body, bucking up into Cas' mouth, shoving his cock deep into his throat as hot cum pours out of him. Cas swallows quickly to save himself from choking on the what seems to be gallons of cum shooting down his throat. When Cas has finally milked the last of the cum from Dean's cock, he pulls his mouth off, leaning up to kiss Dean as his body still shakes. "you're fucking perfect" he says kissing him. Dean moans, his eyes fluttering open to look at Cas, green eyes meeting blue. And even though they both just had the most amazing orgasms, they knew this night was far from being over.
I can't wait for the nights with you
"You too Cas." Dean smiled, before turning toward the car. He paused and turned back around. "Hey Cas? Are you sure you wouldn't like to join us? I mean, I know the service isn't really your thing, but Darla is singing and we're going to look at lights after. I'm sure Darla would really like it if you came." He looked up and smiled softly."I'd really like it too."
"Daddy, are we walking?" Darla said hopping around the driveway playfully.
Dean's body fell backward as he raced toward ecstacy, his hands, still bound together caught on the back of Cas' neck pulling him forward. Cas' hand moved from Dean's hips up to his back holding him as he licked and bit Dean's neck and chest, keeping his rhythm. Dean was falling apart beneath him, and The Angel thought he never looked more beautiful.
A sudden wave of pleasure overcame him and this time it was he who moaned. "Fuck Cas, what was that?" Dean asked once he trusted his voice.
Cas moves his hand up to the back of Dean's head and into his hair as he climbs up onto Dean, straddling his lap, blanket falling away as he does. He completely forgets that he had fallen asleep wearing only a towel, until he feels the rough denim rub against him. The sensation is wonderful and he moans against Dean's mouth. Dean still hasn't moved, he hasn't exactly kissed him back, but he hasn't pushed him away either. Cas runs his tongue over Dean's lips one last time before pulling back and opening his eyes.
Cas's eyes fly open and he looks at Dean. Dean voice lowers, "What did I ever do to deserve you? For you to save me? To have you like this?" he sighs heavily "You are so perfect, I am the luckiest man on earth."
"So, do you want to go to church with us tonight?" Dean asked with a smirk.
"No" Castiel interrupted "you don't have to explain. I completely understand, Darla is number one priority." he smiled and touched Dean's hand.
So it took me a little while to get into the groove for this chapter. I thought I was going to change POV's to Castiel, but couldnt find his voice. Once I dedcided to stick with Dean though, the story came much clearer. Of course I had a ton of support and some definite inspiration, and I thank everyone for that!
Dean nuzzled into Cas' neck, laying small kisses over the marks he had left. Cas' hand was on Dean's head, his fingers scrunching softly in his hair, sending small tingles through him. Their breaths steadying as they lay together.
There was only the sound of the engine as they drove, Cas could feel his heart racing. He was torn between wanting to get as far away from Dean as possible and never leaving his side. He watched out the window as they passed houses he didnt recognize, he had no idea which direction they were going in, he doubted that if he had to walk that he would have been able to find his way back to the gas station. He spent most of his time there, and hadn't really wandered far when he wasnt working. But still Nora didnt live that far away, and nothing here looked familiar. Cas glanced at the clock, they had been driving for at least 10 minutes, they should most definitely be there by now.
Dean took him by the hand leading him to the stairs, he paused and looked back at the scattered books and papers, he chuckled softly "Man, Sam's gonna be pissed when he sees this mess."
"That." Dean panted "Will not be a problem" He pulled the covers back off of Cas, tossing them to the foot of the bed. Cas was wearing boxers, "Dude, are you wearing my underwear?" Dean looked up at Cas with a smirk.
Dean's eyes went wide when he heard John calling for him. It meant it was time to go. Castiel quickly cut the rest of the pie and put the pieces in individual containers for the trip. when they reached the door Dean stopped and turned to Castiel. "Mr. Novak?" He said, his pubescent voice cracking. "I need to tell you something" He cast his eyes toward the floor. "I... I'm going to miss you"
Suddenly Castiel felt a rush of anxiety that he hadn't expected. What was it that he had told Dean when he had confessed his adoration for Castiel the day the Winchesters left for California? We'll discuss this again in 6 years? Was that why Dean was here today? Did he still have feelings for him. Castiel shook his head, that was silly. It had been 6 years, Dean had gone through puberty and grown into a man now. surely he wasn't still holding a torch for his geeky neighbor from when he was only 14 years old.
god, anything he could think of, if any words could string themselves together at all - when something caught his eye, and he glanced up, a piece of the lump caught inside his chest utterly softening when he realized what it was.
Cas’ eyebrows rise disbelievingly, but Dean pays him no attention. He lines up, staring down the cue. He breathes in. He breathes out.
Dean stilled in his tracks, and opened his mouth to say something -
The three of them look at each other for a moment.
The corner of Cas’s mouth twitched, and he swept forward to kiss Dean with the force of the grace that once saturated his veins, pulling away with a look that was almost smug when he saw that the Winchester had been rendered speechless. “A man I raised from perdition taught me that,” he said in answer. “See, he saved the world.”
— - —
And then, because he must be some kind of
his other self asked. He leaned in, as if to close the last of the mental space between them, grinning like he already knew the answer.
It’s harder than he’d expected, though. The edge he’d started out with at the beginning of the night has been steadily diminishing with each successive game, and another win is much less of a sure thing than it was before. And not only that, but he can’t help being a little… preoccupied. Okay, a lot preoccupied. Because the more he thinks back over the whole strip pool conversation, the more sure he gets that Cas was flirting back. He was
Sam groaned in impatience, “Do you like him?”
There’s suddenly a bad taste at the back of my throat. The taste of poison. I remember Castiel’s father on the table, praying. The strict Christian man.
“Dean, I have to wear a shirt and sleep.”
“You don’t know?”
I break the kiss and she breathes deeply, her forehead pressed to my shoulder.
“I barely touched you.” Dean said when Cass glared at him. He lowered his hand and the angel took it, using it to prop himself back up. Instinctively, Dean’s other hand went towards Castiel’s back and touched his wing again. Cass bit back a moan. And failed.
Cas sat up, “Dean, it’s alright.”
He thought as Cas turned with a slight satisfied smirk and left.
“Choose?” I repeat incredulously.
“Shut up,” Dean said, a stupid grin plastered on his face, which he wiped off as soon as he realized it was there.
“She found out, Cas. Benny told her,” I say, and he frowns.
I leave the room swearing that I will make this dude resign himself.
“Hmmm.” Jack turns around.
"I'm sorry, Dean," he says, not sure what he's apologizing for.
“Doesn’t make much of a difference, but off, please. You can leave them next to ours.”
Time passes, slowly. Seconds turn into minutes that stretch themselves to infinity and beyond as if they lasted a lifetime. It’s the kind of situation, he believes, that allows second chances to happen: frozen, everything standing still. Even the rain appears distant, easy to forget, no longer of import. Inch by inch, the door opens with a metallic creaking, revealing Dean at last.
“Oh, and there’s no need to apologize, Dean.”
Down the corridor and right, headed to the bathroom. Once they enter, Dean closes the door behind them and says, “Here we are. I doubt anyone’s awake at this ungodly hour, but if you’d rather lock the door, I can knock when I’m back.”
“May I?” asks Dean who, without really waiting for an answer, sits in the free space behind the tub, resting his back against the tiled wall and crossing his legs. Gently, he lifts his hands, starting to wash Castiel’s hair, fingers massaging the scalp. “Wait.”
“Used to be. Used to wonder how you could be so selfish, mulling over your words only to find them stupid. You couldn’t possibly believe them. And you left. You left and I couldn’t… I couldn’t stop you, Cas, alright? Couldn’t do anything about it. Couldn’t consider you dust and ashes. Wish we’d done it sooner. What I did, earlier, it wasn’t-”
"Cas," says Dean, taking his hand.
“Rather.”
“A piece of paper. A note, asking you to wait because we were out at the moment, but we’d be back. From school, work, doing the shopping, whatever. It has stickers on it.”
From the very beginning although messier, an odd detention of the other's presence, capturing the very first moment and making it last infinitely long. Longer than necessary, distorting time itself. Silently creating a moment of exposure and education, revealing something new, influencing views and feelings, making it look different, bigger and of more importance compared to everyday life, inflated to the point that sometimes, at night, before checking on Jack one last time, it feels impossible to wrap his head around such knowledge, around his love, and the possibility that he relearned to care about the world from Dean.
"No use going back in this weather," Dean goes on. "How's she doing?"
Whether Dean is talking about the methodical and precise movements with which he’s combing Cas’s hair or in wider terms, Cas cannot tell. Either way, Dean’s voice sounds as vulnerable and open as it gets, perhaps the epitome of it, and he instinctively believes him.
“What are you talking about, Dean?”
“Yeah.” Dean laughs. “Me too. Got the shopping.”
"Yeah, has a reasonable chance of enjoying his life too. That's what we... my father would have wanted," he replies, removing his hands before Cas stands up. "My father was an obsessed bastard, but it seems Sammy's quite content with his life. Deserves it too."
“No, I don’t think so. I think… I think he’ll merely be happy to see you again.”
“Dean-”
“No, of course not. Right. I’ll just-”
“All’s well that ends well, they say. Least said, soonest mended.”
He follows Dean down the corridor, past the closed doors, and looks himself around, studying the surroundings, looking out for possible changes. He says, “It’s slightly different than how I remember it.”
"Well as are the pups. I'm glad that there were no further complications."
. History in the making. There was no discernible reason why Castiel shouldn’t feel the same way about him. They had always been intimate though neither of them had ever spoken those three syllables out loud. They were friends, someone to last their whole life. A wanted relationship but never defined as if words would inevitably reduce it and diminish its importance or make them realize that they were approaching it wrongly, putting a label on it that hardly fitted. It simply shouldn't have happened like that - oddest timing of all and no time to collect one's thoughts, untangling the mess of feelings and having a chance at expressing the enormity of his own desire.
There’s an intercom now, small, close to the door. It’s stupid when the whole point is anonymity, but useful if they did indeed manage to transform the bunker into a meeting point for hunters: people coming and going and the whole place alive and filled as it was destined to be. Stupid it may be, too shiny and new to look forgotten, but serving the purpose and he presses it without over thinking the simple gesture too much.
or anything like that out loud, softly, whispering it like a prayer again and again and again, his own idolatrous fancy exposed to the world. He had to accept it, not stoically but with some resignation, isn't that the moment they were always travelling to? It had to come. It would come, leaving nothing but memories of the shadows of the real thing behind, substitutions, the best next thing, a replica of something else - distant and unobtainable.
“Do you think I should have woken him up?”
They say that April is the cruellest month: The promise of renewal is looked down on, altered so deeply that disillusionment taints reality and one barren season is supposed to follow another into an endless cycle of desperation and despair, transforming the world into a desolate wasteland lacking all things good. It’s a chaotic universe that hardly ever seems to care about the fate of its inhabitants, indifferent and unbothered, leaving coarse patterns free to be imposed and no retribution to be paid after such prompt catastrophes.
“No.”
“I’m losing my grace,” he whispers just as Dean finishes to tell him something about Miracle. It's the first time he says it out loud, that he admits it plainly to someone other than himself. It feels good, like a weight that's been lifted from his shoulders, the pain no longer insular. “I’m not angry about it. I’m... happy. I really am. But I’m also terrified about what will happen. I don’t know, the deep oblivion. It’ll probably take a while to settle and I have no idea what the consequences will be.”
“Anger and happiness can coexist, Dean.”
And then there’s silence.
“Hardly.” Cas laughed.
“Does Jack still have his powers?” he asks, changing the topic abruptly.
“No, thank you.”
“Shoes off?”
It’s too much to take in. They stand there looking at each other, warily. There has to be something affectionate to say, he thinks, something that could potentially start a conversation about their moment in the bunker right before he was taken. Small talk could do too, serve the purpose, break the ice, reveal that they had yet to reach their limits and exhaust all tension and possibilities. He considers taking Dean’s hand, but doesn’t - the risk of showing himself exaggeratedly vulnerable too high. They’ve been through it once already, years ago, he shan’t expose himself as easily and as quickly. Not this time. Too many memories to forget, even the good ones.
“Lots of poo and vomit. Jack found it hilarious.” Dean pauses. “He missed you. Kept asking about you. This way.”
“Just like that.” He pauses, studying his friend. He looks different, softer, kinder, less tired. Longer hair and a beard. Still beautiful, still Dean. “Good things do happen.”
when the thought of Dean inevitably wriggles in. He loves him consciously now, with none of the evasiveness from the beginning, with more control and purpose, and less of that desperate hunger of the early days of their acquaintance. Mooning around the world, drifting, getting closer, always ending at each other's side and staying there long after the end. Hesitantly, tentatively, yielding. Sometimes he dreams of confessing it all just to lift a weight from off his shoulders.
The words are coming out wrong. It's evasiveness at its best and more powerful as his feelings and thoughts roll and rapid, leaving him jealous of all those people who consider themselves out of touch with their own feelings in so much as to be able to speak with clarity and clear-headedness. Rotten business? He can hardly believe himself, he never called it like that before or thought about calling it such. Shame had never been his to feel: There's too much trust to fear to be reported, too much general incompetence for concrete fears. But their friendship - the most precious thing of all, carefully cultivated so linear and effortless despite the occasional arguments, despite the difficulties of their own personalities that sometimes make him believe that whatever God or fate caused their meeting, it must be having a good laugh at them.
"It took me a long time. Please, stop with me," says Dean, astonishingly bursting in. "Sleep the night with me, Cas."
“I honestly don’t know. I’ve been away for a long time.”
“Me too. That is, I love you,” replies Dean with more emphasis, matter-of-factly, articulating words as if he was the one who spoke them first. He feels Dean’s hand on his naked shoulder and slowly puts his hand on it, not daring to move.
“Tomorrow then.”
“It’s over then,” says Dean, voice deep and broken, syllables that are all edges. “I’ve missed you.”
Barefoot, his socks in his hand, he walks down the stairs following Dean. Wet footprints on the tiled floor and droplets of water still dripping from his coat. He says, “I’m making a mess.”
Dean walked the last couple of steps before opening the door, the metallic handle cold under his skin. The kitchen looked softer than usual, more welcoming, less canteen-like - no better place where to spend their last evening.
Dean tells him everything about Chuck, about Jack deciding to turn back into a toddler at the end of it and they agree that Jack deserves to have a childhood, a happy one. He tells Cas about Sam and Eileen too, about Sam leaving and the first excruciating couple of weeks - for the best, definitely for the best, but still hard. There’s a part-time job as a mechanic, old cars because he wouldn’t know how to touch any of the new ones, but most of the days are spent looking after Jack, taking him to kindergarten and picking him up, therapy, and AA meetings twice a week. The words come out easily, letting him in, each story and anecdote is told with great detail, recalled by memory yet as fresh as on the day they were made. Sometimes, Dean admits, he felt like screaming himself hoarse, yelling apologies until there were no more apologies left in the universe.
"And he's doing well in the city, is he?"
He heads to the sink, turning the water on and washing his hands, getting rid of the mud and looking at the water run down the pipe, leaving brown streaks on the white porcelain. The reflection in the mirror is that of a stranger, dark circles under his eyes and his hair lighter than it used to be, with some grey streaks.
“You can take a bath if you want to. As for the clothes, I’ll find you something to wear.” Dean stops. “Jack started to call people buttheads in your absence. God knows where he picked that one up.”
“I prayed for you,” says Dean. “Every night.”
“He’s fine?”
"Still no change," says Dean as he comes back inside. The door closes behind him and the large and rusty black hinges creak at the sudden movement. The sudden noise, on the verge of being unpleasant, is enough to wake Dean's dog up who looks up only to discover her owner to be the only intruder.
He kicks a pebble that bounces off the pavement and onto the street with all the force he can muster and falls down, slipping, landing on his hands - the skin burns after it scratches against the concrete.
And the beginning of it all too, grabbing Dean and dragging him away just as something went off beside them: the loud explosion and the air leaving his lungs, surrounded by bits of... and later, weeks on, the understanding that perhaps being saved had never been one of Dean's priorities. That late-night confession, darkness hiding their secrets and their own vulnerability, the flat tone and the admission to Castiel or to Dean himself of having been so fucking close. That night, in the freezing cold, in one of the dreadful huts, the whole world shaking, muddy boots and scratching their skin to wash out the blood, irritating it further, opening wounds caused by the freezing air and the frigid winter temperatures, the unsparing cold of January.
“I know. I trust you,” he whispers back.
“I figured.” He pauses. “You saved me, Dean.”
"But I know what it feels like to want something you cannot have."
It had been Castiel’s idea to move out or, rather, Dean himself had toyed with the thought of it, and Castiel had been the first one to bring it up. Of course, he had been, always five steps ahead and Dean always behind trying to catch up. The bunker was hardly a place for a child to grow up in and now that they had stopped hunting it was hardly a place for them too. Trembling lips and broken voices, the lamp on Castiel’s bedside table exposing all their secrets - liars but not cruel to anyone but themselves. A sharp pain at his heart, such a wretched devil of a whole, as Castiel explained his intentions. Later Castiel would say that the thought of Dean not coming had never occurred to him: what they had was good, he had no intention of leaving it behind. But looking at Castiel, realizing that the lack of definition had somehow undermined their time together, making it fragile and ephemeral, although hardly insignificant, had come as a blow. The vulnerable moment with a sense of fatality, of gloom and destruction, preceded by the two of them lying in between the sheets, the cotton-linen stained with emission. Before that, hands skilfully undoing and releasing. A work of art.
“Yeah, I figured.”
“Oh, shut up, Cas.”
want, Cas? If you could have anything in the world, what would you want?" asks Dean as he pours two glasses of whiskey.
“I’m back,” yelled Dean as he dropped the shopping bags, placing them on the floor before taking his coat off. He folded it, the pure cotton Club Check lining on the inside revealed at the sudden movement of the boiled wool fabric. He added, “It’s pouring out there. That’s why I’m late.”
“Dean?”
Castiel nods. “I’m back.”
He lingers, uncertain of what to do and filled with indecisiveness. His heart pounds in his chest and cold water runs down his back, if anything there will be Jack and a hot shower, a clean and dry set of clothes. If things go well, if there is some benevolent force in this chaotic universe, there will be Dean too and they’ll be friends, mature enough to ignore what passed between them, mature enough to move on.
was expecting you. And Jack too.” He sniffles. “Bold to assume this place ain’t warded for these things. You look terrible, Cas.”
Carefully, Castiel opens the ajar door and reveals Jack’s room. There are a couple of pictures hanging on one of the walls, photographs by the look of it, though the dim light that comes from the corridor is hardly sufficient to reveal their content. The room itself is a mess of books and clothes and the small desk on the right is covered with paper and pencils and small animal statues all lined up as if ready to embark on a great journey across land and sea, to the end of the world. And the dog, Miracle, on a pillow and covered with a blank. She opens her eyes lazily and looks at Castiel and Dean before closing them again, such late-night visitors completely uninteresting.
“Much. Jack?”
“I want to see Jack,” he says urgently.
"You're terribly soft, you know that?"
Dean; because he doesn't want to cross boundaries and make things uncomfortable; because he doesn't want to ruin whatever it is they have, whatever exists in this limbo of unacknowledged feelings and repressed desire, manifesting itself in lingering touches and stolen glances, the complete disregard for personal space, all things that fill him with hope.
Cas laughs loudly, his whole body shaking. “Butthead?”
“It is. I was thinking about moving out, but I wanted to… wait… you know? Here we are.”
“Do you think you should have woken him up?”
He walks in quietly, tiptoeing on the pavement and smiles as fondness washes over him. Gently, he presses a kiss on Jack’s hair and fixes the blankets.
“Here I thought that the mud made me look irresistible,” Cas jokes. “Look at you, I’ve ruined your t-shirt.”
Cas laughs. “That sounds more like it.”
"I shouldn't have said that. I don't-"
. What a surprise, how comforting that the Greek
Cas lifts Dean’s hand and kisses his knuckles as he closes his own around them, holding them against his lips, sighing. He says, “It’s going to be alright.”
“Cas. Cas, look at me,” says Dean, his hands cupping Cas’s cheeks once more. “Look at me.”
Still holding Dean's hand, Castiel says, "I've been told to invite you for dinner. On the twenty-fifth. You may bring Sam, we'll be happy to have him. Jack says the more the merrier."
“It doesn’t matter.”
“Poetry is pretty passionate, is it not?”
Rain and silence and none of the familiar landmarks illuminated by the lampposts at both sides of the roads. He simply travels the distance out of instinct - straight on and then left, left, right. Sooner or later he’ll reach his destination and then the hardest part will come later on, soon after, the one that will inevitably leave him out of his depths. Truth is simple, a series of facts pronounced matter-of-factly with feeling and conviction, with trembling voice and heartbreak. It’s partly objective, based on observation and recognition - looking even as the other has their head turned around, looking away. It’s up close and personal, verging on irrelevance. Apologies are different, slippery, difficult when a mere shift of stress can transform entire sentences into a question or an accusation. They have to be acknowledged and accepted, selfishness has to be taken into consideration, and may widen the distance more than they close it.
“About you?”
“It doesn’t.”
“I won’t hurt you,” adds Dean.
"A friend to last my whole life. It gets... lonely." He pauses. "There's Jack, but it used to- Never mind."
“Dad?” Jack mumbles, his voice filled with sleep.
“I know.”
He would have let Castiel go if his friend wanted him to, it would have been the right thing to do and there would have been no blame. Castiel's strange and archaic words had followed him, filled his mind, echoed again and again like a curse. They had gone outside, the acrid smell of sex slowly dissipating, and had gone to have breakfast: Dean had prepared coffee and Jack’s cereal bowl as Castiel went to wake Jack up. His hand had reached for Castiel’s and they had lingered on the doorstep, the dangerous experimentation had long turned into love and the same urgency to be together had momentarily stopped them from resuming everyday life. Two simple sentences, if somehow belated in their articulation
"Not me."
“And you’re looking at me in a very meaningful way right now.”
Dean grabs the poker by the fireside and moves the wood around, paying attention not to extinguish the fire. For a moment it feels as if it won't work, but then, suddenly, the flames start to crackle and blaze again, growing in size and flooding the room with golden light.
“Then I’ll have to tell you now that we gave someone your room. Moved all your stuff into my room so if you’re willing to share.” Dean grins. “I was going to ask you years ago, but… I guess life happened. So will you? Move into my room for the time being?”
“Me too.”
. Burn the fucking house down.
“Cas?” The voice, oozing bewilderment, is unmistakably Dean’s.
He imagines the sound of steps down the corridor or merely up the metal stairs, Dean’s hand on the handrail as he quickly runs up. His hand on the doorknob or perhaps turning the keys in the keyhole first. It’s different, he doesn’t dare think about how much he didn’t witness.
"What's the point of wanting, Cas? What's the point of wanting something if you cannot have it. There is-"
“I do.”
Angrily, he wipes his hair back. Anger at the universe and at himself, for being pathetic and weak and ever so alone - hurriedly walking down the street. It’s useless, now, to cry over spilt milk: what’s done is done and the past is nothing but a foreign country where things are done differently. It’s untouchable and there is no way to go back and re-enter the moment, change its very nature and turn events upside down. It would have happened, one day, one way or the other: too stand so close to the fire for years without getting burned completely impossible. It could never have lasted. If not with Dean, then any moment spent with Jack - too risky, one day he would have let his guard down. Unexpectedly. Without fully realizing it.
A word intruding her thoughts: home. Enclosed, safe, why be anywhere else? Why leave?
Castiel nodded. Dean stretched out his hands, taking Castiel’s. Their fingers brushed against the other's, their skin warm. Curling at the contact, a soft, light and precious touch. A simple welcomed gesture that could just as easily remain unnoticed; And yet, in its privacy, was simple and joyful - a gentle reminder that they were both there: safe, alive, together.
Castiel's about to speak when Dean moves closer and away, he looks at him and smiles softly. Blood is rushing through his veins and his thoughts are going staccato, he cannot sort them out and whatever coherence he may find leads back to the idea of tangent closeness and possibilities. He leans in, slowly, waiting for Dean to step back in shock, giving him enough time to do so. He'd ask but doesn't trust his voice, and then his lips are on Dean's, a gentle touch at the very beginning of a scale of impropriety. Neither of them moves. There are no soft sights, no confidence, no tips of tongues playfully touching in curious exploration as movements start to become more confident.
“No need to.” Castiel laughed, a million noises exploding at once. Head tilted back. “Dean, I was always ready to fall into your mouth like a grape.”People always make such a fuss about these things, but I don’t care. It was like madness, the thought of you always wriggling in.”
“Cas?” he asks, his voice soft. “Is that really you?”
Castiel doesn’t manage to finish the sentence, perhaps doesn’t even have it in him. His thoughts are going staccato and he feels disconnected from his feelings, incapable to neatly sort them out and make sense of them. There are a couple of certainties that don’t seem to make the situation any easier and the moment, imagined for too long, doesn’t quite live up to his expectations. Neither worse nor better, simply different in its complexity. Trickier. Worries of a different kind. They found each other again, for the last time and having Dean at his side once more feels right, slightly inevitable. It’s this version of them, actively choosing each other all over, but the future is dark, a series of interrogatives Dean too must be aware of.
“Cas.” Dean grinned back. “Hi. How are you feeling?”
had come out with a snort. They had looked at each other, smirked, and Cas had looked at him with such fondness and love that Dean had been forced to look away, flustered.
“Are you sure it’s poetry you’re thinking about?”
Cas nods. “Yes.”
“A point?”
"Yes, why not."
“Did you have fun?”
“His room, playing with Marvellous Marvin. Apparently, they’re having a tea party. Sam and Eileen will be here in ten minutes-ish with dinner. Chinese. Jack’s choice.”
"What would
“What?”
One day, Castiel thinks as Dean hands him his glass, he will leave or send him away and then life won't ever be the same again, the whole thing proof enough that real friends merely exist in dreams where friendships are bound to last an entire life. Dean will leave, the three words have a certain inevitability to them as the breaking point has been reached more than once, steering dangerously close to it, always on the verge of destruction. And then? Back to the realm of reality and loneliness, with the thought of Dean wriggling in, knowing that he knew him better than anyone, knowing that he could never say that how much he knows him or knew him, how much he understands or understood. And then? He would have to take it for what it is because he couldn't possibly say
So here he is, sitting on the ground when he could be anywhere else instead - dry clothes, the worst behind him and the future in front of him, at hand’s reach along with happiness, true happiness that may last longer than the last time, and an ending, not necessarily a happy one. Then again, is there such a thing? Will anyone be truly happy? Isn’t the very essence of life void of definite endings and true happiness, the kind one always ends up reading about? Isn’t it enough to aspire for the next best thing and mere contentment for it is impossible for anything else to remain as they are for the rest of time?
“That.” Coughs Dean. “You’re here.”
“Yeah. Yeah. Of course.”
Dean stretches out his hand ever so slightly, their fingers brushing against each other, curling, as they continue to look at each other. His heart soars. History in the making. Feast your eyes. Castiel feels dizzy, his heart pounding in his chest, any of the sounds and doubts that may have usually grounded him ignored.
