He is not paying attention.  And now, neither is John.
Sherlock's phone buzzes three times in a row in John's pocket, making him jump in surprise. He takes it out and throws in the general direction of the couch.  Sherlock manages to catch it despite lying flat on his side, and that little demonstration of agility makes John's skin crawl, as if it's the last drop that makes the glass too full.
“It’s ok.  Do you want to lie down?”
"John, let it go."
"Tea?"
“See, that is the thing,I slept all through the night –not deeply, it was as if I was always on the verge of waking up, with this strange back pain and huh...” Sherlock blushes at that, “also bad cramps, in my lower belly, as if I needed to go hmm... you know... Nevertheless, it wasn’t painful enough to wake me up completely, it’s as if my body had decided I would sleep no matter what.“
"I think I can hear the siren," comes a voice...
Then John's carefully crafted plan comes into action.  He begins by going through Sherlock's emails with him to be sure they haven't dismissed an interesting case by mistake (
.  Why does John feels so ridiculously privileged to hear Mycroft call him by his first name? He even feels a blush rising over his face, a pleased blush, that is.
Three months after Moriarty’s death, John gets kidnapped again.  This time, he isn’t electrocuted and shoved into a car’s trunk.
"And?"
"He's getting some sort of respiratory therapy," Mycroft explains, looking relieved to have an excuse to get out.  "Keep me posted, John.  I am certainly not the person my brother needs or desires by his side right now.  Anthea is going to stay here so if you need anything, do not hesitate to ask."
Thanks for reading!
John settles the rhythm, even slower than before, waiting for a few, languorous seconds when he's deep inside Sherlock, pulling back, then circling his hips, before starting all over again.  Sherlock's moans have wrecked his voice, and it's raw, scratchy, as he keeps praising John.
She had stopped working at the shop eighteen months ago, telling Afton she had health problems and needed to take some time off.  "She never came back.  I told her I would reengage her any time, but she never showed up.  I wonder if her health problems were serious... She actually seemed to have put on a little weight in the last month, which wasn't a bad sign wasn't it?"
And what about his disdain for all music that been composed after 1900, when John has heard him humming an array of songs  in the shower: Bowie and the Beatles, Pink Floyd, the Stones... When Sherlock hears John entering the bathroom, he shuts up immediately, or changes the tune to a Mozart concerto, but John knows that he knows he's not getting away with it.
John nods.  Sherlock has revealed himself very skilled when it comes to feeling their daughter and identifying the different positions she's been adopting ever since she was big enough to allow it.  John figures he finds comfort in it. It's knowledge, after all, and knowledge has always been Sherlock's ultimate weapon against fear and insecurities.  Given that with a pregnancy, so many facts remain unknown, of course Sherlock will try to reduce that list as much as possible.
.  John had forgotten about it.
Sherlock frowns at him. "The second most commonly used definition of the word "hybrid" is, and I quote, a thing made by combining two different elements, a mixture."
"I would do anything for you, John.  You have to know that."
Some of you might have already realise that in my story, sometimes, Mycroft adresses John by his first name, and other times he calls him "Doctor Watson".  It is done on purpose, since that is how also present in the show.  Mycroft adresses John differently, depending on the scene.  I thought it was interesting to keep that.
Sherlock drops his shoes on the floor while John shifts slowly, careful not to put any kind of strain on his leg.  He watches in fascination as Sherlock settles his long, lean body on the side, using a few inches of mattress.  His head goes back on John's chest, where it belongs, and his arm around his waist.  John wraps an arm around his shoulder and over his back and lets the other one rest over Sherlock's on his stomach.
"I do not."
When Sherlock gets downstairs around eight, bleary-eyed, his hair sticking up in all directions, the Christmas turkey is in the oven, a batch of biscuits is cooling down nearby and the kitchen table is covered in pictures and old albums.  John has heard funny and heartbreaking stories, has seen his fair share of Mycroft and Sherlock thorough their youth and, at some point, has become completely enamoured with Louisa Holmes.
Sherlock has remained immobile, breathing heavily into the crook of John’s neck.  He waits for Mycroft to walk away to look up at John, tightening his arms around his waist.  “This is it, this is the worst case scenario,” he says, studying John’s traits with his deducing detective frown.
Sherlock can't go on.  He frees himself from John's grasp and walks straight into his room.  John follows, trying to make sense of what Sherlock is saying, until... oh, Sherlock.  It is always so surprising when he shows how much John really is important to him, how much he loves him.  And god, how vulnerable he really is. It would be so easy to play with his insecurities and innocent love, to manipulate him.  John is glad he is the one Sherlock judged worthy enough to see how uncertain and fragile he is regarding intimacy, friendship, love, sentiment.
"Lied about what?"
Sherlock pulls his penis to the side; John examines his swollen sac, finding it has worsened since the last time he checked.  The skin also seems tighter.
“Sherlock.”
“I wouldn’t.  How did it feel?”
“Wait,” Sherlock cuts him off, swallowing audibly.
Sherlock tries to repress a lopsided smile without success.   John is about to suggest they move the massage to the bedroom when suddenly, Sherlock's feet slip away from his hold.  He looks up to see him standing straighter, one hand resting on his belly.  Sherlock's eyes are open wide and he frowns, seemingly concentrating on something.
Sherlock is quick to twist himself to the side, so he can let his head rest on John’s shoulder.  “Nothing of the sort.  I just feel like having you close.”
“Yes.”
"Good idea."
"Sore but okay."
, and understand, everything that going on. He is grateful, because the next step is most probably being taken to the stabilisation room, a place where Sherlock cannot follow.  Might as well feed off his presence while he still can.  Who knows how this night is going to unravel.
I love you all.
“Alright.”
"Hum, let me think... Let's have very loud sex and break the bed.  Speaking of which, I have to admit I'm a little disappointed.  I was hoping for a stay in your old bedroom, you know, to see your college trophies and some ridiculous poster on the wall, sharing a single bed that creaks each time we breath."
"I hate that."
"It's creepy."
This chapter is the last one about the case Sherlock is working on, The Sussex Vampire.  So, it is case-heavy, I am sorry if it isn't something some of you enjoy.
Mrs. Hudson waits for them in the lobby, the door already opened, waving at them with enthusiasm. To be honest, John is as excited as her.  For once, he's the one out of the cab as soon as it comes to a halt, leaving Sherlock behind to pay the fare.
John gets out of the car and walks around the back, taking a pack of tissues out of his pocket. He crouches near Sherlock and gives him a couple of tissues, waiting patiently while he wipes his face and mouth.
Truly, the first week had been quite boring for him.  That is the thing with painkillers: once you're off them -which John had wanted to do as quickly as possible- you have to rely on your good ol’ self to sleep and to pass time.  Sherlock had been quite brilliant during that first week, always careful to provide John what he needed without overstepping.  He had spent hours doing crosswords and Sudoku with him, watching telly, often making a show of mocking game shows participants or bad series scenarios, only for John's entertainment.  He had even cooked.  Well, he had heated things, defrosted others and made toast.  He had watched out for signs when John was getting restless, or just upset -strict rest means way too much free time to think- and played the violin for him, if he thought it would help; and, understanding John needed space, had gone for long walks on the cliff.
"What do you suggest we should have done differently?" Sherlock asks tentatively, when it is clear John is done with trying to explain himself.
The first three days of Sherlock's bed rest go smoothly.  He sleeps a lot, because he is still fighting his cold, and when he doesn't, he spends his time texting back and forth with Lestrade about the case of the Sussex Vampire, as John has come to call it in his head.  Sherlock does not involve John, and John doesn't ask to be involved.  If the case is worth it, it will happen, eventually. Anyway, John doesn't have difficulties busying himself, despite having decided to take the next two weeks off the surgery.  Sherlock's protest had been more for show than anything else.  John might come off as overprotective, but he really doesn't want Sherlock to be left alone for long periods of time, not when he's stuck in bed doing nothing and thinking.  Mrs.  Hudson had offered to keep him company but John had declined.  Sherlock's pregnancy is something, he feels, that belongs to the both of them.  John's lizard brain urges him to protect his nest; it is as simple as this.
Sherlock gives him wide, innocent eyes.  "I would never."
are good.  John feels as if they've just reached another step in their relationship maturity.  It is almost scary how much they have talked about the real things lately.  Scary but, yes, good.
"I had completely given up on ever having grandchildren.  Now, can you imagine, John, in one year from now, you will show your baby the Christmas lights of the tree? Here, of course. You will spend Christmas here," Louisa decides, and John is immediately sure neither he nor Sherlock will have a say in the matter.
Serious and careful, Sherlock nods solemnly and takes the offering, pressing it to his nose instead of blowing it.  John figures there is only so much he can ask of him, and kisses him again, on the cheek.  "You are adorable."
"But you did nothing," Sherlock cuts him off, his voice cold and his eyes sharp, now staring straight at Beeks who seems to crumble on himself.
John realises that he knows what Sherlock is talking about.  Isn't it evident, after all?  It all comes down to this.
"Of course it's good, you silly sod," John assures him, taking in the charming, shy smile Sherlock gives him.
"Well, I know it can be scary but as for myself, I think those are things you have to settle before taking the decision to have a baby.  That is why I am so confident and well prepared.  There is nothing more natural than birth.  A lot of people want us to believe we women are too weak to go through it without the help of modern medicine, but isn't it more of a question of determination and personal strength?  Yes, there are women who aren't made to have children, because they miss that strength, and maybe they shouldn't.”
Besides, it isn’t like Sherlock hasn’t changed as well.  The closer he gets to his due date, the more vulnerable and overwhelmed he feels.  He’s actively seeking John’s proximity, and for the first time since they have known each other, he seems content to let him take all the decisions, even when it comes to deciding what he should eat, when he should shower, and sleep.  He’s gone quiet lately.  John doesn’t think it is exclusively due to the negative repercussions of spending the past five days at the cottage.  It had already begun before that. Sherlock’s quietness seems to be something necessary, for him, a way to concentrate on himself and what is to come, to be prepared.
Sherlock and John return to London on March 18.  John still has two weeks ahead of him before he can go back to work, and wouldn’t have minded staying longer, but Sherlock has a medical appointment that week.  They could have driven to London in the morning and be back in Sussex late in the afternoon –it is, after all, only a two-hour trip, but a text message from Mycroft discouraged them.  He asked for Sherlock’s help with a case and it is evident, given the way he explains it to John in a nervous, manic voice, that he really wants to take it.  John is relieved to see his detective of a fiancé showing his usual enthusiasm and is prompt to suggest they start packing.  He’s been worried, after Sherlock’s confession, that the more he waited to get back on track, the more difficult it would be.
"No, we cannot work with suppositions, Geoffrey, we need facts," Sherlock shouts at his mobile while his fingers never stop typing.
"Juh-John?"
“Do you want to sit for a little bit?  You must be getting tired.”
"We're not together twenty-four seven," Sherlock protests, looking part embarrassed, part greatly annoyed.
Sherlock glares at John, and his face turns red alarmingly quickly.
“Shut... oh my god John, it burns, it burns so much...”
Sherlock lifts a disbelieving eyebrow.  "The due date.  For the child.  It was conceived on the twenty-third of September.  The pregnancy is of five weeks and two days."
.  Of course...
Or maybe taken off guard, just as John is.  He goes back to his spot near the window to let the pale sun caress his face.  He might as well - if the brothers have decided to ignore him, he could tap dance in a kilt between them without being spared a single look.
"It's okay, lovely, these men are here to speak with me," Beeks says.  For the first time, nervousness appears in his eyes, and his tone changes from resignation to uneasiness. Which is understandable.  He does not want his eldest daughter to be drawn into the drama that is surely about to take place. "This is my daughter Angie," he says reluctantly, as Sherlock has stopped moving.  "From a first marriage."
John does.  "You have become quite reasonable yourself, Sherlock, do you at least realise it?  You have more consideration for your own life, which cannot be seen as something other than an improvement.”
"I said you made it difficult for me to love you."
Chapter 4
"John?"
Luckily, it will only be the two of them and Mycroft -Mrs. Hudson isn't even there. The new laboratory is a big deal, though, and John is almost glad Sherlock already knows about it: at least, the present isn't really a surprise anymore.
I've been wrtting for a long time, and I've always update my wip's  every five or six days, except in the case of serious RL issues.  This one won't be different.
"His mind palace?  Maybe."
"It is the moment I knew I had fallen in love with you.  I do not know when it happened, it probably started building from the beginning.  But.  At the pool, I had to admit it to myself."
"Ok."
He shouldn't worry.  Sherlock is angry.  Plus, he tends to lose all sense of time when he's at the morgue's laboratory.
It came to John's knowledge, when he pushed the issue, that Sherlock had been terrified by a tale Mycroft used to tell him, about tiny aliens hiding inside kid's navels so that they could eat them while they slept.  He had been so scared he would cover his belly button with layers of tape before going to bed.  Sherlock might have admitted it when he'd been drunk on three glass of wine - aah, Sherlock drunk is so mellow and likeable, tipsy, funny, with that light lisp from his childhood worsening gradually.  His arrogance turns paternalistic and indulgent, as it did that one time when the people from the Yard succeeded in dragging Sherlock to the pub.
"Sherlock, let's grab a cab."
After three glasses of wine, he was explaining to Anderson how to differentiate normal footprints from those of people with a limp, and at one point, he had patted his head, an affectionate smile on his face.  "Don't worry, you'll get it someday."  John and Lestrade were watching from a distance, giggling openly, and of course, Lestrade had the camera of his phone turned on.
"Don't be ridiculous," Sherlock replies, scrunching his nose in the most adorable way.  "There is an experiment I have long planned to work on, though it would be impossible to do here.  If anything, I'll be busier than I have been over the past month.  Besides, I can always help Lestrade with cases that do not require my physical presence."
While they watch the corpse of Margaret Grey, (who died seven days ago from a stroke) being dragged out of the water, shivering under a light snow, Sherlock explains the motives to Lestrade.
"Well..." Sherlock gives John an offended look.  "It is much more complex than-"
"Is this alright?" he murmurs, releasing the nipple trapped between his teeth and blowing on it.
"If we must."
Sherlock rearranges his hands on his lap.  "I couldn't stand it; my head was so full it was impossible for me to think rationally."
“I am sorry,but we can’t wait, and I promise I will do everything for us to be left alone as much as possible once we’re at the hospital,” John says, trying to keep his voice low and even.  “We have a new plan, that is all.  We gather our things, I call Amy, and we leave for St Mary’s.”
He shakes his head and takes another look at Sherlock.  It sooths him
"I am pregnant; are you deaf or do you just like it to make me repeat myself? Sherlock snaps.
Three days - that is what it takes to find Sherlock.  John tries alone, at first, scouting his usual hiding paces he knows about (he's not stupid enough to think Sherlock hasn't kept some for himself), then turning to his homeless network.  He finds few -they are, as Sherlock says, anonymous shapes moving all over the city, invisible to most.  It is true, John has trouble remembering faces and names -codenames, for all he knows- and it seems a new one pops up every time Sherlock needs it.  And those whom he talks to only have an obscure answer for him.
"Okay…so, in your head."
"The fun part, " Sherlock answers.  He tilts his head to kiss John's ear shell, delicately, knowing how sensitive that particular spot is.  "I wonder, though, if you'll get through our first medical appointment without going into shock."
"John... has Sherlock been smoking since he’s known about his pregnancy?"
John decides to let it go and leaves Sherlock to dress himself.  He's visibly overwhelmed and needs time to process.  Hell, John himself does. Seeing the living proof of the beginning of a life, rather than just
"I think we're done," Dr. Brown says softly.
It's good.
"What?"
Caught up in his thoughts, John doesn't realise the cab has come to a stop until cold air hits his face.  Sherlock is already out, unlocking the front door, and the cabbie waits impatiently for John to pay the fare.
"Yeah, right.  You just want to make fun of me."
John nods.  "I get it.  It's just... It is unfair for you Sherlock.  I mean, you caught
And here they are.  John had been careful, over the course of the past ten days, not to mention the matters Sherlock had complained about to Amy Brown.  He wanted to give him a chance to do it voluntarily, and maybe being on strict bed rest wouldn't be the best moment to do so anyway.
John finds himself kneeling between Sherlock’s legs, his arms wrapped around his waist.  Sherlock is bending forward, holding John back in a similar fashion, his head shoved in the crook of his neck.  His belly is hot and hard, pressed against John’s.  Sherlock is not only tense, but trembling.
“Oh,” Sherlock says after a few seconds.  “That smell,
: annoying, strong-headed, attention-needy Sherlock.  It makes John realise how much he has missed him, after three weeks of quietness and resignation.  Is that what Sherlock was talking about, when he spoke of how accepting failure wasn't an option?  John is still pondering about it, whether it is a good or a bad thing.  One thing is for sure, he keeps a close watch on his lover, now more than ever.
Even before they became a couple, Sherlock had had to deal with John's nightmares, those particular ones reminiscent of his days in Afghanistan.  He's learned that an ex-soldier dreaming he's in the middle of cross fire is better left alone, if you want to avoid getting punched in the face.  John knows he's sometimes shouting loud enough to wake Mrs Hudson, and that he fights, physically, to free himself.  He was embarrassed the first time it happened, but Sherlock had been quick to dismiss it, stating matter-of-factly the high frequency of those post-war dreams amongst soldiers.
"I never had hay fever."
"... just another mind game you.... What?”
It won't happen now, that is for certain.  Isn't it strange that only because the possibility is there, John lets himself imagine what a kid with Sherlock and him as fathers would be like?  He would need to have Sherlock's hair, of course, and his eyes, and... Well, John would be totally happy if that child was in fact a miniature version of Sherlock.  Brilliant mind included.  But maybe, just maybe, they could teach that kid to welcome his feelings and relationships with others, to make his life to be less difficult.
"Okay?" John asks, because he knows penetration is very intense for Sherlock, sometimes overwhelming.  The first few times, he actually fainted after coming, something John had until then thought only happened in bad porno movies.  He handles it better now, but there is a reason they don't do it every time they have sex.  Afterwards, Sherlock is weak and too close to his emotions for his liking.
Sherlock slides his mobile screen open, his eyes as bright as those of a kid on Christmas morning.  He spends the rest of the afternoon texting Lestrade and researching a huge botanical encyclopaedia, complains he needs to think when it's time to eat, and barely acknowledges John during their shared meal, busy following the different deduction trails into his head.  John isn't offended in the least.  It's been a while since he’s seen Sherlock acting so...
John tries to settle more comfortably, his eyes never leaving Sherlock's face.  He looks miserable.  His hair is flattened on one side, the curls drenched in sweat, his eyelids are swollen, his cheeks a deep red while the rest of his face is of a pasty white.  He snores because of the congestion, his breathing loud and laboured, his mouth opened. His nostrils are red and irritated, crusted with mucus.  A trickle of saliva is sliding from the right corner of his chapped lips, pooling on his chin. Sherlock Holmes.  So bloody human, and imperfect.  Weak, sick, scared. But also, more beautiful than John can ever remember seeing before.
He is ridiculous.  There he is, panting harshly, probably red in the face, if the heat he feels is any indication, throwing a temper tantrum about a piece of furniture.
"Definitely."  The right-hand side of Sherlock's mouth lifts in the uncertain beginning of a smile.
"You are choking her," John states.  "Sherlock."
"I said we wouldn't do that," John states firmly.  Well, he tries.  His words are getting slurry again.  He knows he won't be able to keep his eyes open much longer.
Sherlock is working on his experiment outside, and has to be called in so that he won't skip dinner.  The sun is warm enough to have left a pink tint on his cheeks. He has a soil stain on his chin, and the old jumper he's wearing is covered in dead grass.  This is such a unfamiliar look for him John feels the first tendrils of desire rising from his lower belly, and wonders if he'll ever get used to it, to Sherlock revealing himself without artifices, without armour or mask.  Maybe not, and maybe that is how you feel when you love someone so completely.
"Your bad man."
He sees Sherlock swallowing back an irritated
"Of course we do.  It will also be a tribute to your grandmother."
"Because she had it retrieved last year."
The kick John had given him under the table had left a small bruise.  Mrs. Hudson had let him know
The hell with it.  He should call Molly.  It's past midnight, but if Sherlock is still at Bart's, she will be too.  It's not like it would be the first time Sherlock kept her up until the middle of the night because he needs assistance.  It's also not like she would say no to him.
Afterwards, they lay quietly, spooning, John's hand resting on Sherlock's belly.   It has become difficult for him to fall asleep unless he’s in contact, skin to skin, with Sherlock's stomach, and their daughter inside of him. Sherlock is the first one to fall asleep, no doubt tired by their day, because he might feel great, and full of energy, but he is tiring way faster than he used to.  He has a practically normal sleeping schedule now.  John intends for it to stay that way as long as possible.  Resting while you can is probably the most useful advice you can give parents-to-be.
There it had been.  Disappointment, yes.  And the first tendrils of an invading, sickening wave of hate.  Not for long, but it’s still too much for John.
To his surprise, Sherlock does not seem to hear the discreet, electronic "click" of the mobile.  John takes another chance, and another step.  He now has the perfect view of Sherlock playing, his eyes closed, his features relaxed, except for a little frown of concentration.  As he is trying to hold his violin correctly, he has no choice but to tilt his back slightly backward, exposing his lovely belly, all round and firm and
“The worst case scenario is being unable to reach the hospital, being stuck at the cottage.  Me, giving birth, without medical assistance.”
The three sticks all show a positive result.  Sherlock is buying himself some time for what will probably be the most intense freak out of his personal history.  It can't go otherwise, right?  Sherlock cannot be that mundane about something as serious as finding himself with child.
Oh Jesus.  The enormity of their conversation is hitting John like a punch in the guts.  Mycroft Holmes, the man who is practically the British Government, is playing matchmaker."
::: :::
Now though, if he were to write about himself, and the way his life has changed since he moved in with Sherlock, the timing would be perfect. Here he is, laying on his hospital bed, drifting in and out of the stupefied artificial sleep of morphine.  He has survived the explosion with very few consequences: some bruises and scratches, a couple of cracked ribs and a broken wrist –which explains the strange alien sensation John had been feeling.  The pain came later, during the ambulance ride, to be precise.  At the A & E, John’s wrist had to be set before being immobilized, and the doctor hadn’t been cheap on the morphine dosage.  Not only does John not remember the actual setting of his broken bone, but he’s lost all sense of passing time.  He could be lying in this dark hospital room for hours or weeks, and he wouldn’t be able to tell the difference.  His thoughts are following him in and out of consciousness, and would probably make zero sense if they could be accessed, but to John, they are clear and logical.  He's living through his own very private exposition.
"You made it." she said slightly surprised by this fact. Sherlock nodded, still not saying anything and she took that as her cue to show him what she needed to. "So apparently, this Mary person, is really good at sneaking into places. This mark on her neck..." she pointed to the mark on the back of her neck. "Wasn't their before."
"But it did."
He pulled me with him and we splashed each other, laughing as we did so.
"As do I."
"What?" I asked slightly startled.
"Yesterday, you said that it was a crappy first date that was a little bit too late and you asked me to marry you." He got down on his knee and opened the box I had seen in his drawers a few months ago. I never wanted to open it though.
"That it was." Sherlock said, a smile evident on his features. He's smiled a lot more recently and I fall in love with him every time he does it.
"This isn't..." he started.
"So if you couldn't couldn't get that he was the murderer from everything above, that gave it away. But I did see that way after I said everything."
He took a deep breath before talking. "You aren't going to like this."
"Sherlock. You should go."
"Sorry. I made you miss the past ten minutes of the episode."
"I do too. I was thinking about getting them as a tattoo." He said.
"Sherlock... I have an explanation." he whispered. I turned my head away from him. He grabbed my hand and I hesitated a moment before yanking my hand away from him.
John was curled up in a ball on the floor, blood pooling around him. I screamed, terrified he was dead. I knelt down and felt his pulse, breathing a sigh relief when I found one. It was weak though.
Both boys were a little tipsy as they giggled about John's little hiccup. They watched as the flames licked the logs which melted away to nothing but ash. The warmth washed over the two, leaving them in a peaceful silence, enjoying the other's company.
I opened my eyes just as he leaned down and kissed me. I breathed a sigh of relief when we pulled apart because it was no doubt real. He was really here and really did just kiss me. He hugged me again after noticing that I was shivering. I relaxed back into him, still not quite believing this was happening.
A warm pair of arms wrapped around me and I freaked out. I struggled to get away from the person holding me but in vain. He whispered in my ear, trying to calm me down and once I recognized the voice I froze.
"Everything is wrong with me. You broke me and now... I'm going to break you... and I'm going to enjoy every single second of it. But that's not why I called you here."
"Well there is this nice place. It's in the states but that wouldn't be too bad."
"Oh well... it would have looked so much better if it were you instead of Mike. Perhaps I could put you there myself. It would make the art a masterpiece." I said smiling even bigger now. John stared at me in horror but I didn't care. Let him see this side of me. Let him see what he did.
"It's about time Jo..." she started as the door swung open. I pulled away and turned to her smiling.
"I'm sorry." she would say and then she would wipe a tear from my eye. John is the only person who makes me cry, makes me smile, makes me feel human. Hell he made me laugh in the middle of a crime scene on our first case. I smiled at the memory.
"Yeah. It's good to take a break once in a while."
"I suppose we wouldn't." he said, lowering his voice. "And I wouldn't be able to do this." he chuckled as he pulled me down on top of his as we fell to the couch.  "Or this." he whispered as he stroked my face lovingly. "And I most definitely wouldn't be able to do this." he whispered pulling me down and kissing me.
"That's not nothing. Why have you..."
I grabbed my phone to check the time and it was only 12:30. It was still dark out so John should still be sleeping. The bathroom door was wide open and there was no telly on. I looked over and found his phone gone. He must have left the flat.
A faint rustling made it's way to my ears as I was heading to the door and I froze, slowly turning to face John, lying in the bed. He couldn't be... could he. I walked forward slowly, head slightly tilted, strainging to hear another noise. I watched carefully but nothing happened. I sighed, believing that I had just imagined it but then there was another rustling sound.
Another page turning. "We should do something."
"And leave you... no way." I said shaking my head again.
Slowly starting to drift off, Sherlock noticed a glimmering heart-shaped locket on her neck that wasn't there at the start. Slamming his hand down and startling a sleeping John, he gathered the files and his phone.
"It's not your fault. It's mine. I'm just stupid is all."
Palm trees lined the entrance and I noticed the smoke shop and convenience store were part of the hotel. The building was an ugly tan color but because it was starting to get a bit dark, the lights from the hotel were on.
"Oh and he has a new girlfriend right after he found out his wife died. Yeah he didn't care at all. Alright I'm done now I promise."
"Good." he whispered. When the cab stopped I gave him the notes and climbed out of the car, Sherlock in tow. It was getting dark out and I realized we stayed out a lot longer than we thought.
"What?"
"But Moriarty is dead so you have absolutely nothing to worry abour...right?"
"DON'T MOVE!" She yelled and I froze, terrified of what would happen if I moved an inch. Sirens went off in the background and I silently cursed Sherlock. She chuckled. "You clever little arse. Calling the cops." She smiled and I knew something bad was gonna happen.
"You tease." he smiled, throwing a pillow at me.
Sitting around, day after day, doing nothing was boring. John would come by everyday and break down by the grave. It was devastating. Everyday he got thinner and paler. Darker bags under his eyes.
"You cannot go there... wherever there is." he said quickly, seeing the look in my eyes. I had to though and he knows that I will go. "Please, you can't." he whispered. Seeing the look in his eyes hurt me so badly.
I stood off in the background, watching as Sherlock studied the body. Why would Mary do this? I know she was angry about me choosing Sherlock over her but why is she showing me this way? And why now? It made no sense, she had all that time, but she chose now to get me back.
"Because I was worried sick. I spent half of my time worrying about tracking down the damn hunters so that you wouldn't be killed when I came back. The other half of the time I spent squatting in the graveyard and worrying about you until my head hurt. If it hadn't been for Molly talking sense into me I would have showed myself long ago and you would have gotten killed for it."
His face stoic, mine, no doubt, bright red. "You... You guys are Sherlock Holmes and John Watson?" She asked excitedly. Sherlock sighed.
"Yes." I growled before huffing defeatedly.
All I could think about was that blade. Blood dripping off of it in an outstretched hand, not moving. John wasn't moving and I knew this was because of me. I caused it. This was my fault.
A few thousand dollars? Where exactly were we going?
He was about to leave again but John stumbled over to him. "Let me see the files." he said.
When I woke up the next morning John wasn't there and for a second I thought I was back in Molly's house. I couldn't bear the thought of losing everything I had just dreamed about. I had wanted it for so long and I thought I had it but... none of it was real.
Soft crackling filled the room as the fire lit the area in a soft, warm glow, flickering as the breeze blew in through the slightly cracked window. The coffee table was pushed closer to the fire so the files strewn about it could be seen in the dark night. A bottle of whiskey lay empty on the carpet and two glasses sideways on the table.
At last when the ringing stopped and a voice answered on the other end, he knew where they were headed. Slightly angry, Molly awaited there arrival and showed them into the morgue. Studying the female, Sherlock noticed nothing different aside from the locket.
"I liked the pictures."
"Lauriston Gardens."
"What did you find?"
I was so freakin bored. I have been in this bloody hospital for two days and I was so freakin bored.
"Don't say that. I'm happy I ran into Mike. My life had no meaning and when I met you, I found something. I found a friend, a partner, and a lover and I couldn't be happier and after this is over with, I will have found a husband. So please don't ever say that I should leave because of all of the shitty stuff that's happened. It does suck, I will say that, but if I have to endure the ocassional crap so that I can be married to a beautiful human being, then I will, because it's worth it. Because you... are worth it." he whispered.
"Yeah." Lestrade said, hanging up. I stuffed my phone in my pocket and ran as fast as I could down the streets of London. It was a beautiful night and I thought it wasn't fair that it was so nice when something so horrible might be happening right now.
"Finally. It's about time." I shouted as I quickly ran around the room.
The mark looked like an arrow and Sherlock's eyes narrowed. "Molly take her dress off and flip her over." I said. Both Molly and Sherlock were slightly taken aback by my command. "Please." I added.
"What?"
He challenges and surprises him. He makes him question his life, wonder if he's truly happy where he is. When he was with Molly, it was different, it was pure and will always be good for him but it isn't what he truly wants. He wants someone who can surprise him and make him smile at the worst of times.
There was a quiet knock on the door before it opened, revealing Lestrade. "Hey." John smiled.
Best of three turned into best of five, then best of nine, and so on. Ten games in and the entire congregation of the pub was crowded around their table. The smell was awful. Everyone watched in a tense sort of silence as the merchant made his move.
"It's hard to resist." John gave them a faint smile.
“I’d like to play with your nipples.” John said. “Up to you.”
“Did something happen with him?”
” He winked at his dom over his shoulder. John pulled his clothes up, delighted they were doing this. Sherlock bundled an outfit together. “I’ll change in the loo and then… wait in the sitting room?”
“Mm…anything good?”
This chapter contains lots of schmoop and fluff.
“Mm. Now maybe, but not then. Seb liked my body more than my brains.” Sherlock said bluntly. “We ended up dating on and off for fifteen years. Then he kicked me out.”
John had no idea how a man like Sherlock would choose to decorate his flat, but what he saw was somehow fitting. Eclectic, odd, cluttered, and out there were all in the same neighborhood in Sherlock’s weirdly cozy flat. Papers and clothes and
Sherlock stared at the wall. This was so boring! This was waste of precious time! It was like John didn’t care at all that someone had been dismembered. He rolled his eyes and tried not to sigh too loudly. He fiddled his fingers, snapping them quickly.
Sherlock gulped. John took a few steps and snapped it against the red chair. Sherlock startled at the
“Thank you, John. Try to keep him in line, will you?”
Sherlock blew through the front door to 221B, shoving the black door shut against the howling wind. He took a deep breath of the warm air in the foyer before he began peeling his leather gloves off his fingers. A crash and a muttered cuss word drew his attention to 221C's open door. Curious, he hung up his coat and stepped into the open doorway to listen. The sounds of scraping cardboard and John muttering to himself floated up the stairs. Sherlock went down and found John bent over a plastic tote box labeled 'x-mas stuff' in black marker.
“Since when do you not like Betsy’s cooking?” John asked. He typed back,
This is something of a PWP chapter. There IS an actual case coming up though, I promise ;)
“Hullo.” He said quietly. The floor was all scraped up, like something had been repeatedly dragged back and forth over it. He crouched and touched the marred wood, so old it was like stone. John reached out and dragged a finger over the marks. They were deep. Gouges rather than scrapes. In his village, his family home had a wooden door, rough at the bottom, and a dirt floor. The front door had made similar markings when it was open or closed, scoring the smooth dirt and kicking up bits of soil.
John filled his bucket with cold water from the pump and found a seat on the bench between Molly and Danny. Molly was a genuine ray of sunshine in this hellhole and John had no idea how she kept up such a damned cheerful facade. Some people thought she was happy because she was ignorant or simple. John, on the other hand, marveled at it. More than once her innate light had kept him from going to places too dark. He was lucky, he reasoned. A month after his run in with Buck he’d fought off a new male concubine who tried to attack her in the herana. The guards had killed her attacker for refusing to see guests and follow the rules. John only suffered a black eye, split lip, and bruised kidney for his trouble. Molly had admonished him even as she tended his wounds, telling him not to make a target of himself and not to show weakness by protecting her. He’d vehemently disagreed. He’d pissed blood for ten days because of the kidney but even so, he’d not regretted his actions. Once everyone realized their combined skill in mending bones and making the pain go away, they gave John and Molly a wide, respectful berth.
"And you can't stop thinking about him?"
“Mike Stamford.” The man said to his confused face. “We went to Bart’s together—I know.” He glanced over himself. “I got fat.”
“John—”
Sherlock sighed.
"I don't think so, sire. I get a bit ill after tending to guests sometimes." He waved it off, "it's nothing. I'm fit for service."
Nothing clever came to Sherlock in that moment, which rankled even more than what Seb had said. He gave him a fake smile and turned, going up the steps.
"What? What hurts?" Mike crouched in front of him. "Open your eyes. Look at me."
"Of course." Sherlock sounded alarmed. A warm hand rested on his back and John flinched. Sherlock yanked his hand away. John wiped his mouth and straightened up, grunting as his tight back protested. Sherlock glanced him over again, this time with a more calculating expression. John looked exhausted and grey.
"Have you though?" John put his empty glass on the table and leaned forward to see him in the kitchen. "Really?"
John lifted his head, his expression open. He tried not to laugh. “Yes? Do you have an answer for me?”
He'd pulled on dark chocolate brown breeches, treated to resist water. He wore a forest green tunic and on top of that, a thick leather sleeveless vest that he could wrap on tight and button in place. It was flexible and light and it was similar to what Britannian soldiers wore. It was a sort of armor and it could slow the path of knife stabbing into flesh. He didn't suspect anyone would try to off him, but he preferred to err on the side of caution. He was worth a lot of money and he had no idea who else was going on this hunt. He buckled a pair of brown and black bracers around his forearms.
John grins. The surgeons continues:
I just want to add that my wonderful beta
"Sophisticated make-up: seducer," adds Sherlock without letting his flatmate finish his sentence.
"What?" asked the older man, the grimace of impatience reasserting itself on his pale face.
The detective by-passes the chair where his brother is still sitting and goes downstairs at a crazy speed, into his bedroom where he slams the door with a resounding noise. John shakes his head slightly, still not very aware of what just happened, and turns his head to discover that Mycroft's still smiling at him - and it's incredible that a human being can be this creepy by simply showing his teeth. Maybe the pact with Satan is a true story after all.
Sherlock watched John leave, opening up the kitchen door and thumping down the steps. He blinked and looked back at the steaming mug on the table. An absurd thought popped unbidden out of a window in his palace:
"Ah, er, Betsy," Mike’s face was flushed from the praise. "This is John Watson."
“Yeah, the man I came in here with. Could you direct me to the loo?”
“Mike, pick up your phone. I’m in jail and I need bail money. Don’t roll your eyes,” he said snidely into the recorder, “it was for a case. Call me back. Please.” He hung up. He could just wait. Dimmock wouldn’t leave him in here for all that long, but dammit, he wanted to solve the bleeding case! He hated waiting. He hated being told to wait by sneery little police officers. Mike would bail him and he’d go out and finish what he started.
John stared at the floor. This was insane. He had to be in a nightmare. Three days ago he'd been a free man, working with his team. Everything had been great. Hell, the risk of getting caught was half the fun, but this wasn’t fun at all. He thought of Mot's corpse twitching violently and the life leaving Bill’s eyes. He squeezed his eyes shut. Those images would haunt him for the rest of his life.
Gregory Lestrade, Head of the Royal Guards and Mycroft's personal body guard, stood off in the corner. He was wearing the royal armor, hard red leather embellished with gold. A blade hung at his hip and a pistol beside it. Sherlock tossed him a sloppy salute in greeting and Greg nodded back.
“No.”
“Well, then I dunno how it happened, but suddenly there’s a knife in my hands. And, you know, me old man was a butcher, so I know how to handle knives.”
He rocked on the stool, the pleasure at his front mixing with the pain on his bottom. He took a breath and the pen slipped out of his hand as his cock twitched happily in his hand.
dom. John took a deep breath as his angry protective side roared. Yes, Sherlock had been abused, but he was away from that relationship and he had Mike and Betsy now. He poured a mug and added a splash of milk, stirring. John sincerely hoped the younger man would be alright.
"What hurts, lad?" Mike asked.
Sherlock stared at him and for a horrible moment John thought he’d be upset. He exhaled when Sherlock laughed and said, “good! What time is it?” He turned and looked at the candle clock. “Good God, is that accurate?”
“Yes.”
“Just how I like you.” He squirted some lotion into his palm, rubbed his hands together, and smoothed over his shoulders. Sherlock sighed into mattress, going soft and pliable the moment John touched him. He rubbed the cream into his skin, getting it down his spine and scapula and ribs. He squirted more lotion onto his palm and rubbed it into his bottom, getting it down his thighs and behind his knees. Sherlock spread his legs and John teased at his balls, slipping his fingers up through his crack and getting the lotion
“Wrong.”
"Him" Sherlock nodded to Greg. "Can't put the apricots down first, obviously. They'll burn and stick."
a real man.” Sherlock corrected. Honestly.
“Better. Now come in, Mr. Holmes.” John glanced over Sherlock’s unkempt uniform, the dangling tails of his shirt and his ripped trousers. He hummed in disapproval.
John jumped through the channels, looking for something to take his mind off his sore leg. Calling Ella and making an appointment, or at least talking with her, would probably be smart. He couldn’t be arsed. Maybe later. He settled into the pillows and watched and tried to forget.
“Don’t think so.” He clicked the pins a few times, admiring Sherlock on his knees, then set them on the coffee table. “Up, please.” He tossed the gown aside.
“Get up.” John strode over to him and Sherlock rolled up to his feet, his eyes eager and bright. “Get in the corner.” John pointed. Sherlock obeyed with the merest sigh, walking to the corner and clasping his hands behind.
There was a knock downstairs and suddenly a detective inspector was jumping up the steps.
"It really only makes sense to use it this month." John said. "And when in Rome…" he gestured vaguely at the bathwater.
Lestrade sipped his coffee and glanced sidelong at John. In the years Greg had known him the detective had never brought Seb or any other dom to a crime scene before and here John had not only bailed him out of jail, but was now here at another crime scene. He wondered what John had that Sherlock deemed scene-worthy or even
In no time at all Greg had his own snowball. He lobbed it at John's head. He ducked just in time. Sherlock and Sally were pummeling each other with snow by this point. Sally's scarf was full of snow and Sherlock's curls were dusted white. Sherlock dove behind a bench and John followed. Greg and Sally hid behind a fountain and they all took turns flinging snowballs at each other. They were having such fun that no one noticed the two police officers cutting through the park, heads down and pace brisk as they made their way from one end of the park to the other. John leaped up at exactly the wrong time and lobbed a snowball at what he thought was Greg. He realized his mistake a second too late and gasped as the snowball exploded on the officer's coat.
“I can’t walk!”
“I’m not asking.”
Sherlock found his blue dressing gown. He put it on and flung the striped one at John. Covered, they both went out to the kitchen. Sherlock sipped his coffee and handed John items as requested. “Feed me?” Sherlock asked when it was nearly done.
He hastily looked away and met Sue's eye. She raised a brow at him in amused interest and John, his face as red as the strawberries in Sherlock's signature tart, looked down at his apricots. Unfortunately he looked down too late to not miss the conspiratory elbow nudge Sue gave Mel.
An employee appeared from a back room and spied them giggling over the case. She wandered over. “Do you two need help?” She was short and curvy and her smile was friendly. Her short hair was a warm bright pink. Her gold name tag read ‘Nina.’
“I’m fine.”
"Your Highness?"
“Of course you are.” John pushed the door open with his foot and Sherlock fell out of his arms into the bed. “Mmmm…” He snuggled down in the sheets, his unbuttoned shirt flying open. John watched him curl up, his breaths going slow and deep in moments. He felt himself grinning like an idiot as he stood over the bed and watched him sleep. His cock was heavy in his pants and a sort of pooling tingling sensation was circling in his hips. His inner dom was telling him to
on the other side. Sherlock hissed, hanging his head low as John snapped the crop hard repeatedly down his thighs and across his shoulders. He gingerly folded his arms under his head, resting his face in them as he stuck his butt further back out, silently asking for more. John obliged and changed the angle, whipping the full length of the crop across both cheeks. A tight little squeak burst out of Sherlock’s mouth and he jerked up, arching his back with each snapping blow, stomping one foot hard on the floor. John kept going, smashing the crop over his arse until it was red hot with lines. His breaths were harsh in his mouth and Sherlock was grunting and moaning and squirming delightfully. John finally paused to give them both a moment. He shook out his arm and looked down at the red lines on his bum. The red on pink sure looked painful. Sherlock was trembling and sniffling quietly into his folded arms and his cock looked even harder. Lucky sub.
John made his way into the dark little space and listened.
"It's because you're a switch, isn't it?" Sherlock asked. "You need to sub but you have no outlet."
“You’ve been warned about this.” The Headmaster said, crossing his arms. “You’ve been warned that repeated disobedience will earn you nothing but a trip to my office. I know your parents were called the last time this little incident took place, but it appears whatever discipline they imposed on you had no effect whatsoever.”
He told her the film's title. "It only got so-so reviews, he said, trying to decrease her interest. Might not even be funny. It has that one actor in it, you know, the one who's cheating?"
Now John could never be certain of what she said next, but it sounded
filled most surfaces in the sitting room, and in the kitchen there was—
"Updating."Sherlock said, hopping out of the fireplace. A vial of ash was clutched in his hand and goggled covered his sooty face. "My tobacco ash study is out of date. I want to freshen it up."
“Why can’t I talk to Coel?” Sherlock asked.
“Yeah. Defense is weird.”
Sherlock rose a brow at the label. "Candy Cane bubble bath?"
"That was wild." Greg said from the corridor, remembering them all crashing into the trees. "You two are barmy and I love you for it."
“Mmm.” Sherlock tapped his chin. “Maybe I’ll hide something horrid under his bed. Entrails.”
“I’m sorry, did we bother you?” He asked, adjusting his coat on his shoulders.
"Oh." John swallowed. "I'd like to see you again before you go back to Britannia."
John stared at him. "There's no case on?"
“Sounds good.” Sherlock closed his eyes. “Just a few minutes of sleep first.”
He and Violet rode back in the direction they'd come. His horse was much calmer now that it had gotten that trick out of its system. They each kept a half-hearted eye out for game, but there was nothing around.
He wasn’t sure how much time had passed, five minutes or thirty-five, when a soft knock sounded on the door.
“Address the letter tomorrow with a fresh head or better yet, forget about it completely!”
“I don’t want any of these.” Sherlock said. “I want black.”
“Oh loads.” She said. “Three percent of the sixty-one million UK residents have it.”
“Ask the maestro.” Lestrade nodded at Sherlock. The detective had already slipped on some gloves and was running two fingers over the ragged edge of bloody thigh flesh before examining the shoe. He regarded it for a moment, then focused on the toes. He grunted and moved to the arm, examining the fingernails for what seemed like an inordinately long amount of time. Lestrade stood and stepped back, tapping John on the shoulder and gesturing him to step back as well. John moved back towards the brick wall, giving Sherlock room as he stood up and stepped elegantly over the arm, crouching again and rolling it to its side to examine the elbow.
“I, I, um…”
Sherlock was grinning.
"Does he need x-rays?" Greg asked.
to see his response to that question.” John’s fist clenched, both as a stress response and because he really wanted to punch Mycroft in the face. The older Holmes seemed to sense this, as he stopped pursuing it and wisely chose to shut up instead.
Sherlock looked up at him. He hadn’t been expecting that response at all. Usually John couldn’t wait to get his hands on him after a scene.
It didn't occur to Sherlock to disobey. He scrabbled up as fast as he could.
Just, you don't have to talk about it if you don't want to, you know? We have stuff you can take to make it easier, to relax and help you forget. Do what the guest tells you until they dismiss you. Then come back here. Don't wander the castle." She said. "Just don't. If they catch you anywhere besides where you're supposed to be, they'll beat you. Kill you even. Remember that."
"Yep, this'll be fun." John shut the light off and closed the door behind.
I did not do the math. I lifted it all from this article:
Behind Mike, John rolled his eyes. He partly wanted him to shut up and also was getting more and more curious about this guy. He sounded…interesting.
John heard more noises below. It sounded like a group of guests were pouring into the room. He heard snippets of male voices.
Sherlock grumbled and Mike continued. “What are some things that aren’t boring?”
John looked up. "What do they normally say?"
"They seem to be getting on." He said. "Why?"
“No.” Mycroft said succinctly. “That’s the truth.”
“He was being an arse. He tried to force himself on me. I pushed him away and he was unhappy. He spread silly rumors about me. So I spiked his water bottle one day.”
“Good boy.” John kissed him and patted his backside. “Go stand in the corner for a bit. Your punishment isn’t over yet.”
“Good boy.” John sat across from him and opened his computer. Everything was quiet for a few moments. Sherlock wrote the sentence a couple times, but was soon distracted. His bum was stinging on the hard flat stool and his cock was awake and interested now. Sherlock spread his legs and slipped his left hand down the front of his trousers. He fisted his thick, growing cock and squeezed. It felt sublime. The warmth on his backside and the pleasure in his front was delicious and he closed his eyes, gently jacking himself.
“Ah.” John held up a finger to stop him. “I said no complaining.”
“Just…pick a word.”
"If you wish it."
Mycroft glanced away from the peon speaking to him and hissed from between clenched teeth: “sit down!”
“John.” Sherlock croaked. His voice was tissue paper thin and pathetic. The doctor dropped Logan like a sack of moldy peas and scurried to Sherlock’s side, crouching and lovingly cradling his blood streaked face and looking at him with a soft expression, belied somewhat by Logan’s blood splattered up his cheek. “An ambulance is on the way, love.” He spoke gently and hugged him close to his chest. He yanked off his jacket and draped it over Sherlock’s shoulders and applied pressure to his dripping forearm. “You’ll be okay.” John’s voice was shaky with tears and he gulped, kissing the top of his curly head. “You’ll be okay.”
"Have you guys seen him?" Dimmock asked them, jerking his thumb over his shoulder.
“Why?”
“Good.”
John's heart deflated.
The DI smiled, breaking apart the tension in the room, and rose, beckoning him forward. The doms shook hands and John apologized profusely again. Sherlock rolled his eyes.
“He’s gone.” Logan cupped Sherlock’s face with his bloody gloved hand. “And before tomorrow you will be too.”
"Nothing." He muttered.
"Best of three." Sherlock said. He plonked a small burlap bag on the table, certain to let the merchant see the glittering gold sovereigns inside. His eyes widened greedily.”I accept!”
“I’ll ask her…see if she lets me go.” Mike muttered. His ears went a little pink and John grinned at the insight into their relationship. Betsy really did seem good for him, and Christ knew John had dommed more than a couple subs who requested he set curfews and dictate when and where they could go out and even who they could see (and give out punishment when the rules were broken). It was just one more way for a sub to give a dom control.
“You often are.”
, he reminded himself. It was possible he needed to get more blatant. Doms liked when their subs were needy, and John was certainly no exception.
“I’ll give you two guesses!” John snapped.
Jim stared at Mycroft, anger simmering in his eyes. He glanced at John.
Sherlock scurried over to the corner and stood there facing the wall and edge of the wardrobe door. He fidgeted, wiping his eyes irritably. He clasped his hands behind his head and felt the sweat in his hair. His arse
“Well now.” A man crouched over him, a long silver knife in his hand. Every part of his face, save his eyes, was covered with a black knit mask. “Looks like I didn’t need to dose everyone after all. A hard whack on the head does the job just fine.”
The following morning, John was dragged out of his dark cell and hauled outside. The sun was shining and he closed his eyes in the sudden brightness. He was dragged roughly to a courtyard and up some steps before being slammed down to his knees on a wooden floor. He managed to crack his eyes open. This area was shaded. Beside him, Jim sat on a cushion on a sort of wooden throne, watching the commotion down on the courtyard floor in front. Gulping, John glanced down.
“Why are you still here, John?”
“Maybe you’ll have better luck with him.” Sally muttered to John. She handed him the bag and headed towards the other employee. John gave the evidence bag over to Sherlock and stood beside the door, out of the way. He didn’t want to be here. He was feeling sulky and irritated and not at all willing to help.
"Poor smitten bastards." Greg finished his water.
"My pleasure." Mike said. "I'll be up later to check on you, your Highness." Mike grabbed his bag and headed for the door. Sherlock wanted him to stay and act as witness to Mycroft's imminent committal of fratricide. Mike left and the door shut with a quiet thud. Mycroft stared down at him and Sherlock fidgeted under his blankets, hating the scrutiny.
in that collar.”
“Mycroft, I’m leaving today.” He said.
“I don’t know. What time is it?”
"No you’re not. What happened?" She laid a hand on his back. "You're sweating buckets." She lifted her hand away. "Were you attacked?"
“Do you work tonight?” Sherlock asked the next day. It was lunchtime, and they were at the table with a risotto John had made. Sherlock was perched on the edge of the chair, as his back was sore and welted from the crop and his arse was throbby from being thoroughly fucked the previous night.
“Oh God,
"If you don't feel ill in an hour, chew another leaf the same way. Don't swallow the pulp. The juices  act as a mild poison and should move everything along. If nothing happens, come see me. Be warned though, it'll purge
“Really?” John looked surprised. “I’ll go with you.” He put his napkin on the table and started to stand.
Both men looked down at the basket of delicious things.
“I think you already did.” Sherlock said dryly.
“I want to go home.” Sherlock groused, looking away.
John has a bad night.
Sherlock didn't move and John sank back into the cushions, watching Clark fiddle with the decorations for the house.
John peeled the protective shield of cotton pants down. Sherlock kept talking.
“I don’t mind. And your dom doesn’t need to ever know. We’ll be quick.”
“John Watson!” Lestrade yelled. “Let go!”
“I don’t want anything! Get off!” John rolled onto his back and Jim punched him across the face.
Sherlock stood up and John leaned down, unclipping and unbuckling and pulling the leather away.
Twenty more minutes went by, and when Sherlock was hobbling back from the toilet, he paused in the sitting room. John was on the sofa with his magazine, reading placidly. Sherlock shuffled to the sofa and got on, sitting there and contemplating the chains around his ankles. They were clipped, not locked, and Sherlock could easily unclip himself. He didn’t want to though. John had put the chains there. John should take them off. He glanced up at his dom.
No fingerprints. Gloves and corpse decay were working in the murderer’s favor. The tox screen showed the wild dosages of drug, but no other foul play. If the murderer just needed his victims pliant and willing, Flunitrazepam would do the trick. It was relatively easy to get as well. They still had no description to go on. Jenkins hadn’t seen the killer’s face but had said ‘he’. Likely a dominant, easily able to overpower subs or seduce a sub. Maybe. Not a medical man, given the haphazard sawing at the bones. Not terribly intelligent either, given his miscalculation of the dosages. That there was a unintelligent murderer out there, succeeding, was maddening and also more insulting than Sherlock cared to admit.
John settled back down beside him and spoke in a rumbly voice. “You had a Grade III hemorrhage. You lost almost two pints of blood. After I made Logan wish he’d never been born, the ambulance showed up and I went with you to Norwich hospital. You got fluids and a transfusion and when you were stable, Mycroft’s men showed up and took us to this place.”
“That’s up to you. Stand, please.”
“No.”
Stupid work.
“Not anymore. I made a mistake.”
“What do you care?” Sherlock asked. “Why do you care if I treat them like the idiots they are?”
"I have an assignment after this one." John said. He was surprised to hear that his voice was steady. He was quaking.
John was striding down the sidewalk in the clammy nighttime air. A hot cup of coffee and a cold breeze had cleared his head and he felt a little better. He’d thought about calling Mike or Betsy to vent and ask advice, but realized he didn’t need to. Demanding Sherlock off the case wasn’t his right. Sherlock was an adult and if he wanted to go after the killer, then John could only voice his opinion. He didn’t
“Yes.” John said. He bit his lip. “I just went into it right when I saw him. I saw the look on Sherlock’s face. Seb was holding his leash.” John shrugged. “I went nuts.”
“I’ll help you practice.” John said quickly.
John glanced down at the basket. His stack of clothes was much shorter than the detective’s pile of pressed and folded dark trousers and some of his less expensive, non-dry clean shirts. A couple pairs of his pants were neatly folded at the top and John took a deep breath, clenching his hand around the rim of wicker. He wasn’t exactly thrilled with the idea of Mrs. Hudson seeing and touching his used underwear. She liked to dote on them though, either through tidying their flat or keeping them in food, and she seemed so very pleased that Sherlock had gotten himself a dom. She didn’t see her own sons very much, and John was reluctant to forbid her from rinsing out his socks—even though she
"That's wonderful, John." He murmured.
“I’d like that.” The doctor piled the eggs and sausages onto a big plate and added four pieces of toast with butter and jam. “Let’s eat in there.” John nodded at the sitting room.
"Evil spirits." John said. He shrugged. At Sherlock's skeptical expression he said, "it's not sillier than kissing under a dead plant."
“We both work full time.” Michael added. “Two days before I, well, it happened, we just stayed in and ordered take away. The night after that we went out to eat. I ran some errands after.” Jenkins shrugged. “Bought some odds and ends. Got a coffee.”
John had been out there alone and worried and by himself, not knowing if his sub had been harmed or was bleeding. Damn. John was probably dropping, but how could he help? If a switch dropped, would they flip dynamics? He’d dom John again if he asked, of course he would, to but he didn’t want to do the wrong thing. Again, these were foreign waters. His own sub drop he learned to take care of on his own, but…he’d never experienced any kind of drop with John. He’d never really appreciated that until now. His dom loved aftercare and now he needed some for himself.
“Sherlock?” John’s voice was ragged with anxiety and viciously, Sherlock thought,
"Yes, well. I am a whore. People like a whore."
"Dear, is your brother still at Chilgrave?"
John smiled. “Um, well, it’s like I have this desire to kill and destroy anything that’s making me feel threatened, whether it’s friend or foe or human or animal. Anything that’s a threat to me or my sub can no longer live. My body chemistry changes and I get a rush of adrenaline and a huge burst of testosterone. Suppressants keep those testosterone levels low.” His face turned pink and he chuckled. “It’s a little embarrassing, really.” He shifted on the floor and rubbed his neck. “I really scared the hell out of him last night. Were you frightened?” John asked.
“Eggs?”
“Yep.”
“Something.” John ascended the steps and Sherlock moved aside to let him pass. He followed, asking questions. “Like what?”
Next time. There would be next time, right? He nodded to himself and closed the laptop. The knot of feelings didn’t seem so tight anymore. In fact, nothing hurt at all. He contemplated this for a moment, then went to the kitchen to tend his experiments.
“Just checking.” John said.
"John, how long will you be in London?" She asked. He didn't especially want to talk about his long term plans (seeing as there weren't any) , but it was clear that Sherlock was off-limits so John indulged them, telling them about maybe looking for a flatshare or something and telling amusing stories from his time overseas. He kept his hosts laughing and glossed over many of the grimmer details. The war was still fresh, and he didn't want to dwell too long on the negative aspects and put himself back in that place of helplessness and pain. Sherlock didn't say another word.
Sherlock decided that John should never look sad ever again. He sank back into the pillows and spoke. "Tell me about when you would go out fishing."
He must have been sining and turned around. Water from the shower head getting into his mouth and sliding down his throat. I stopped frowning. a look of revelation on my face.
"That was just plain awesome."
He hung up, telling Donavan that it he was murdered with poison water from the shower by Mary Morstan. He told her to check the DNA on the trophy. Then we headed out of the flat and into the cab, driving off towards the hospital.
I sighed, dropping my head. He chuckled as he walked back into the stall. The woman next to me started laughing as soon as the door shut and I glared at her.
I reached into my pocket and pulled out the tiny black box I had gotten a few days ago. I opened the box and picked up the ring. "I wish I was able to tell you how much I cared about you. You were the most important person in my life. I wish you were here or that I had gathered the courage sooner to tell you that I love you."
I could solve this case but then John would be stuck in a situation where he may lose all of the people he cares about and I can't do that to him. But if I don't do anything and leave it to Scotland Yard it will take forever for them to catch the killer, if they ever do.
He got up and started screaming. "Sherlock! Why did you have to be such an asshole and leave me behind the way you did?! This isn't living! You not only killed yourself, but me too when you took that jump! I... I..."then he fell to the floor and started crying again.
"No one saw who it was though." I frowned at this then thought about everything I had seen before coming to a conclusion.
"Will you be my husband Sherlock Holmes?"
"Yeah sure." I mumbled. I bit back my tears, face turning impassive as I hid my emotions from the one person in the world who I felt I could be myself around. He looked hurt but I decided not to look at him because as much as I want to hate him for hurting me, I couldn't. So instead I focused on Mary.
I was really excited to see where we were going. There were so many amazing places in Laughlin. Lots of resorts and casinos.
(See the end of the chapter for
"When I examined the clothes I found a strand of blonde hair I thought it irrelevant at the time but it appears I was wrong. I would say run the strand but Mary isn't her real name so it'll come up as something completely different. So use the DNA from the trophy. It should come up with a bunch of aliases and one of them should be Mary Morstan or it'll come up with one name. If you searched hard enough you would find that Mary Morstan and the person who showed up on the DNA test are the same person."
I smiled as I pushed myself out of bed. A phone ringing echoed through the flat but Sherlock didn't answer it. I sighed as I walked out of the bedroom. I picked up Sherlock's phone which buzzed in my hand as he got a message.
"No thank you. I don't need fingers in the salad." Mrs. Hudson chuckled. I nodded and Sherlock stumbled slightly.
I smiled slightly when he chuckled. I ran my fingers through his curly locks as his eyes drifted closed. He nestled in closer to me and I chuckled at how adorable he was when he was asleep. When he was awake, he was always thinking. He never seemed to stop but when he was asleep he didn't need to think... he probably still did but it didn't show like it did when he was awake.
He told me to get in and pushed the canoe out into the water and hopped in after me. "Uh... John..."
"Quit being rude." I then turned toward the cashier and smiled. " I'm so sorry. Ignore him. He isn't the friendliest person."
"These are really cool." He said pointing out the pictures as we walked towards the counter.
"I'm sure he'll understand."
"You. You think I'm gonna get mad cause you used the rest of my shampoo. Now come on drama queen." I said leaving my room.
"I'm sorry. I can't be here... I'll just... I'll just go." I mumbled and I left. Sherlock said something to Lestrade but it was drowned out by the roaring in my ears. I sat at the bottom of the stairs, head in my hands, trying to even my breathing.
"We have the autopsy reports. You were right. She did bleed and he was choked." Lestrade paused and I looked over to him. "Sherlock... they were..."
"No. You always have a reason for coming."
This couldn't be happening. They said he was going to live. They said he was going to be just fine.
"Don't ever do that again."he breathed.
"Yes. I'm fine." I said pushing her away slightly. I loved her like she was my mother but I didn't want to hug her all the time.
He was glad he stumbled into Sherlock's mysterious life as a consulting detective. He couldn't imagine where he'd be right now if he hadn't bumped into Mike that day because it wouldn't be here, comfortable, with the man he loved.
So I waited until the front door opened loudly. I then kissed Mary passionately. I had to pretend to enjoy it or they would die. I smiled and groaned and kissed her, imagining she was Sherlock. At least then it would be more bearable. When Sherlock came in Mary hadn't noticed but the look on his face was pure pain. My heart shattered and I groaned again as she rocked her hips.
"Because I'm having so much fun." she whined. She closed her eyes and sighed and I took that moment to stick the needle in her arm, turning up the morphine amount and watching as she dozed off.
"No. I would be six feet under along with Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson."
"I'm sorry." I whispered and he shook his head as he leaned down and kissed my forehead.
"I do mind and I won't move. I was told not to let you out of the flat anyway." I groaned. Of course he was and since John didn't exactly have any henchman I knew it had to be Mycroft.
