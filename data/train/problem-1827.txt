Jawn groaned...but not out of fear, though. No, this time, it was a sound of pure disgust. And maybe a bit of betrayal. “G’eeeeeg!” he whinged.
Sherlock was always a poor sleeper anyway, and although being in headspace made it somewhat easier to get him to go down for the night, it wasn’t always a sure thing that he would
John looked over and smiled at him. “Why you over there by yourself? Do big boys not like a good cuddle either?"
Sherlock sat back, propped his arm up, and set his chin on his hand as he creaked the rocker back and forth, slowly.
“It is well past midnight, child.” While on the subject of nappies, Severus gave Harry’s a sneaky squeeze, finding him dry.
“I, I, I s-still w-wanna watch,” Molly wheezed, out of breath and wiping tears from the end of her nose with the heel of her hand.
A faint smile appeared behind his finger, but it didn’t make Greg feel any better for it. “Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm,” Mycroft hummed, and moved his hand to cup his chin. “You’ve said that. But I’m not the one you should be apologizing to.”
There, sparkling in the velvet lining of the box, was a crystal necklace in the shape of a snowflake. And in the center, there held tiny blue, purple, and pink stones in the shape of symbols from the second movie.
Bucky blinked, and then tentatively reached out to push the handle down. There was a loud, exaggerated flushing sound that startled him and he jerked his hand back, dropping his playdough in the process, and reached for Steve–
“They don’t bother John…?” Mycroft mused, watching as Greg began to light the first of the bottle rockets. John and Molly were on the other side of the yard, thankfully, so he did not call for them to come back.
Jawn didn’t believe him. Well, halfway…he believed that Daddy wasn’t hurt, or G’eg would be a lot more worried. “I’m si’d wi’f you,” Jawn decided, and went to unbuckle himself.
And that, was that. At the very moment the word ‘cuddles’ left John’s lips, he could see the mood shift in Sherlocks’ eyes, as well as the rest of his features growing soft around the edges.
Greg pinched the bridge of his nose, his shoulder still jiggling slightly as he chuckled. “God…alright, who’s ready for fireworks??”
“Aw, that’s lovely,” he said, watching Sherlock gingerly touch the jeweled pendant as he looked at it in the mirror above the fireplace. “You’ll be the bell of the ball.”
Dwalin sneaked a quick look over his own shoulder and grunted as well, much in the same manner. “Again?”
Then, he took one look at Sherlock, who was becoming more concerned by the second…and dissolved. That was it, that was all it took, a single question, a simple glance, and now all he could do was cry like a baby.
He felt Thorin hook his thumb in the waistband of his nappy and hold it out, then give a low whistle.
“Oh my God,” Steve whispered, knowing that the phone would pick it up, and then spoke up for Bucky; “Yea, Blue told you ‘good job’! That’s what she says when you use the potty like a big boy!”
Thorin chuckled to himself; stuffy little shit, always insisting that they had to be somewhere far away and private, even though everyone here’s seen everyone else’s bits from every which way imaginable…and some that you didn’t
At the sound of his voice, Greg and the baby both turned to find John standing in front of them, his hands parked on his hips and glaring daggers, mostly at Greg (okay, all at Greg).
Well, shit. His bluff having been called (because the cheeky little shit was right; Greg didn’t have it in him to carry that out...not right now, anyway), Greg sighed and sat back on his heels. “What’dya want?”
“Yeah.” Jawn sniffed and rubbed his nose with the back of his hand.. “Know’ed i’d was him a’whole time.” As far as anyone else was concerned, at least. No cheap rubber pound-store mask could scare him.
“You’re soaked, baby girl,” he groaned, sliding his finger along her cleft until he reached her clit. “Tiny little baby, can’t keep her panties dry so Mama put her in diapers,” he said, flicking it and dragging the pad of his finger over it in an alternating pattern. “But you can’t keep those dry either, can you?”
He tried to answer, he really did…but the moment he opened his mouth to speak, his throat clenched painfully, and no words came. He froze.
Greg nudged Mycroft’s shoulder; “I’m not sure we should be handing sparklers to a bunch of drunk babies,” he said, and Mycroft hummed in agreement.
“You want…your floaty Opaleye?!”   Ron held up a toy version of the dragon, it’s pearlescent scales glimmering in the light.
“You sneaky little biscuit. C’mere…” Greg stood up with a grunt before taking Sherlock under his arms and heaving him up onto his hip. “Love you, muff’n’stuff,” he said, and gave the babe in arms a kiss on the cheek as he carried him towards the kitchen.
That in turn set everyone else off, her contagious little giggle creating a waterfall effect by spreading to Sherlock, then John, then Greg, and finally, Mycroft, until they were all clutching their bellies and wheezing in pain while wiping tears from their cheeks.
There were days when Steve would literally go down on one knee and thank God…or whoever else was listening or cared up there, because after everything he’d seen over the years, he wouldn’t put it past chance that Earth was just sitting in some sort of massive alien petri dish for some extraterrestrial kids’ science fair project.
John hooked his fingers behind his head and stretched as he looked over the rest of the kitchen, which was an absolute disaster…even the shopping from earlier still sat in its bags on the counter, as he and Sherlock had barely made it back into the flat before all hell had broken loose.
Jesus Christ. John pushed back from the table and hopped out of his seat. He had to move around a bit. He had to think. They’d been at this for more than an hour, and they were both at their limits.
"She said you nee'ah relax.” Nat started grinding her hips as she ran her hands up Clint’s shirt, and he became very aware that yes, she was diapered, yes, she was wet, and yes, she was likely going to make him cum with that alone.
They were old and grafitti-covered, yes, but despite the crudely drawn dicks and slurs that made him roll his eyes and wish it was still socially-acceptable to take his belt to deserving little shits, the table was sturdy and free of both bird shit and splinters (which he discovered after brushing his hand over it). He took the changing pad out of the diaper bag and laid it out over the table; “Hop up, baby,” he said, patting it.
Greg grinned as he went and unbuckled his grumpy little man from his high chair and scooped him up onto one hip. Yeah, he was a sucker, and he knew it.
“Heeey, big boy,” Bucky lifted Steve up and sat him on his hip. “You’re gonna stay here and take care of Thor, okay? It’s your job to keep him from being lonely and playing videogames all night.”
And, when things took their natural course and Gregory was eventually let inside their small, secret, oft misunderstood dynamic, Mycroft was hardly surprised when he took to the role like a fish takes to water (if you’ll pardon the overused expression).
Unfortunately, not even the promise of a treat was able to make the whole miserable situation better. Tony’s little lip wobbled, and he reached for Stephen. “Da'da,” he whimpered as his eyes welled up with tears.
“Can Daddy put it on for you–” John barely had time to finish his sentence before Sherlock was pushing the box into his hands. “P’eash p’eash p’eash!”
Which was adorable. Very much so. And it made Mycroft smile in turn. He softly kissed the back of Jawns’ hair.
Mahal, help him. While he had his back to Bilbo, Thorin rolled his eyes and began to untie the bundle of cloths. “Convincing, truly,” he grumbled. “Lie down.”
“Aw, baby…” Stephen took Tony’s grasping hands, and placed soft kisses along the knuckles. “It’ll be over in a second, sweetheart, I promise!”
“Mm, no.” Sherlock walked over to the rocking chair in the corner of the room, and sat down. “Not until you show me. Once you show me, then you can sleep in the big bed tonight.”
“Alright,” he said, scooping her up once he caught his breath again (and while John lay over on his side, pretending to be someone who could laugh in their sleep), and carried her back to the nursery. As expected the crib was still latched and not a single toy or pillow was out of place, and he carefully lifted her over and set her inside.
“An addendum?” Greg looked over his shoulder, saw the phone, and pulled a face that was both disgusting and, frankly, hilarious. “What kind of addendum?”
"Ah, true,” Thor conceded, and placed a soft kiss on Tony’s clammy forehead. “Is there anything we can do to aid in his healing?”
“Hmmm?” Jawn hummed blinking up at him. He’d heard the murmur of Daddy’s voice, but couldn’t remember a single specific word.
Stephen took one of the packets on the table and tore it open, then wrapped the tiny alcohol wipe and wrapped it around the tip of his gloved finger. “And this?!” He poked the other thigh, and rubbed a sterile patch on Tony’s skin. “Is that…no, is that a
Sherlock fished around in his stocking until he found the small blue jewelry box with the Elsa sticker, just as John said. “O’ben…?” he asked, throwing a glance at John, who nodded back.
!” Stephen tucked the syringe close to his wrist, out of sight, and turned back to Tony with his biggest, brightest smile. “My sweet, precious, oh-so-big brave boy! Can you sit very, very still for Daddy?!”
not going to happen.” Sherlock eyed the piles of wrapping paper and empty boxes. “Not before we leave.”
Loki rolled his eyes…Midgardians could be incredibly slow. “You heard me. Come tell me what’s wrong,” Mama said as she patted her lap, inviting him over.
“Agreed.” Thorin fell into step behind Dwalin to open his pack, and retrieved the small, twined bundle of clean cloths. He had another bundle in his own pack, as well as a small bottle of lightly fragrant oil that the elves had also given them.
John, however, refused to react in the way he knew Sherlock was most likely after. “…Why you over there all by yourself for, though?”
Greg swallowed thickly from a mouth that was suddenly much too dry for such things. He went to stand, sat back down instead and briskly rubbed his sweaty palms along his jeans, and stood up again.
“Aw. Come, now…” Mycroft lightly nudged Jawn's lips with the nipple of the bottle, urging him to latch on. “Not a single thing comes to mind? No story? Or any of those god-awful cartoons you both watch?”
So, Steve would pick him up, pop him on his hip, give him a big ol’ smooch on the cheek, and go on about their day.
Greg watched as Mycroft leaned in and listened to Sherlock intently, nodding along and clucking his tongue every so often. “My, my...no, of course, I think it’s very fitting, not harsh at all...getting off easy if you ask me...but you’re sure? Terribly sure?...Mm-hmm, I see. Very well.” Mycroft sat up, and both Holmes brothers squared their attention directly on Greg. Mycroft was smiling...smirking, actually...and Sherlock, even with his ruddy, tear-stained cheeks, looked very satisfied.
Steve kept his tightfisted grip on the pocket of her jeans as he toddled around after her, dragging his blanket close behind and hoping that he could be cute enough to maybe change her and Papa’s minds about not taking him with them.
“I can, depending on what you’re both harping over.” Sherlock entered the kitchen, also carrying two champagne glasses in one hand, his phone in the other. He eyed the banner, then gave both his brother and his boyfriend the once over; “…Double-fisting already, Mycroft?"
Seems he wasn’t quite in the fire anymore, but he was back in the frying pan. Greg started to sigh--and then didn’t. Instead, he gave the back of Sherlocks’ nappy a pat and nudged him to stand up; “C’mon, muffin, let’s change your bum.”
Thorin knelt on one knee and worked Bilbo’s trousers down to his ankles, and grimaced. “Bilbo,” he said, his tone bordering on sympathetic as he took in the angry red patches on the Hobbit’s inner thighs. “You have to start letting someone know much earlier, tiny Burglar.”
With a now-warm bottle in one hand and a cozy, not-crying tot in the other, Mycroft made his way into the sitting room and plunked down in his brothers’ chair (not that it was the most practical choice regarding seats, but knowing Sherlock’s habits made him think that this is what a tiny Jawn would be most accustomed to). After a bit of shifting both of themselves around, they finally made themselves comfortable with Jawn curled up in Mycrofts’ lap, leaning back against his chest.
Loki pinched the bridge of his nose. “…You have a nice cup of milk–that you asked for, remember–sitting right here,” he said, picking up the small sippy-cup the waitress had brought, along with the rest of their drinks.
Well, that wiped the frown off Bucky’s face in a heartbeat. “We can?” he asked, his eyes wide and hopeful.
Severus raised his eyebrow at him, and then quietly muttered and enchantment that froze the springs in his mattress in place.
It was to the extent that, if he knew he was tired and saw anyone–be it Daddy, Nana, Mycroft, or Greg–approaching him with a dummy, there was no limit to the stomping, crying, howling, or pushing the away. Once, he literally ran from Greg and hid away for an entire, panic-filled afternoon until John showed up to pick him up.
…Okay. She could trust him. She held her arms up and let him lift her off of Delilah (she’d spent the better part of the past twenty minutes thinking of a name, and that one
Stephen smiled at his baby boy as he stripped off a pair of disposable gloves. “Hey, baby boy,” he said, and reached out to tickle the bottom of a bare foot while the Cloak had Tony wrapped up nice and snug as they were serving as a baby swing.
Jawns’ throat clenched, and he swallowed painfully against the lump he felt forming in it. That word kept resonating through his head: alone.
Jawns’ breath hitched and shook as he swallowed back a sob. “N-no’d m-me?” he sniffed, watching Sherlock carefully cleaning his hands.
Because he shouldn’t be laughing! It was a terribly sad thing, and poor little Jawn was so distraught and emotionally wrung out, and so ashamed and embarrassed by the whole thing and
“When we’re drunk? You are,” Sherlock said, smirking as he watched Greg choke and sputter on a mouthful of bubbly and then shoot Mycroft a very dangerous look, his cheeks flushing.
,” Greg replied, his voice overly sweet and just this side of snippish. He wiped at his nose with the back of his hand, smudging  his thin, meticulously penciled-on mustache across his upper lip.
Bilbo’s cheeks bloomed red but, though he looked mad enough to spit, he flopped himself onto the ground and covered his face with his arm. “Fine, get it over with, he hissed through clenched teeth. However, a small part of him was…and he would never,
"Lil sweater made me think of the Weasley Christmas Sweaters soooo 👀 Smol Harry visiting for the holidays?"
“Nooooo, not yours! I’ll get my own and we can have a nuggie-eating contest.” Steve took Bucky’s hands and sat him up. “All done! We just gotta get your pants up, big boy!”
Jawn, naturally, paid Mycroft’s utterings no mind, leaving him to ramble on and hold his bottle as the little one delightedly tapped the brightly-coloured icon for ‘Candy Crush’.
Sherlock peered at the dummy, going a bit cross-eyes, as it was inches from his face. He looked up at John, watching for a reaction.
“And smart. Brilliant, even. And witty, street smart. Fitter’n anyone, with an arse you could bounce a coin off of…!” Greg giggled as Mycroft tucked in the sheets around him. “This is supposed to be a punishment,” the elder Holmes muttered, and kisses Greg on the forehead.
Bilbo was still sputtering for an answer to the ‘change you sooner’ comment, when he processed what the dwarf was saying. “…Pick me up?” he asked.
It was Ori. Sweet, friendly little Ori, smiling at him and offering him a bowl of stew with a sizable chunk of bread with it.
The rest of the dwarves had already made camp for the night by the time Thorin and Bilbo caught up, even though they still had good few hours of traveling time before the sun set. But when he was questioned about it, Dwalin had merely shrugged and gestured to the nearby stream.
A positively radiant grin spread across Harry’s face. “Ye’sh, pea’ssssse!” He scrambled to get out of Ron’s lap and maybe sort of accidentally gave him an elbow in the gut for all of his grumbling.
Ron huffed, but as Hermione was indeed correct (and had overseen his attempts to hide just what kind of bubbles he was adding to Harry’s bath), he turned to the bath and reached in to search out the small dragon instead of arguing further.
Both Greg and Sherlock watched, dumbfounded at the sudden turn of events, as Mycroft marched upstairs and disappeared over the landing.
And none too soon! Not even a full five seconds later, Ron burst into the kitchen, red-faced and out of breath. “Where,” he heaved as he staggered against the door frame; “did he go?!”
Jawn’s fussing stopped just as quickly as it had started as soon as he heard the ‘similar-but-completely-new-wink-wink’ music playing along with the ever-familiar art style. The little character that Mycroft assumed to be a sasquatch popped up to welcome them back to the game, and Jawn smiled.
Mycroft’s foot hit the tile floor and he waited...and still, nothing. Nothing jumped out at them, nothing grabbed at them, nothing shrieked at them, no howling or moaning or groaning or clanking chains--
Sherlocks’ cheeks, ruddy as they were already, took on a fresh shade of pink as he frowned his little heart out at Greg. “You pun’ss me in’na fa’se!” he huffed as he crossed his bony arms over his swelled chest in all the indignation he could muster.
Though, Greg and Mycroft ended up doing most of the ‘lugging’ towards the end of the night, to be honest. “Darling,” Mycroft said, trying to keep the true depth of his weariness out of his voice; “It’s so very late, and you both still need a change, and a bath--” Despite himself, even just listing everything that still needed to be done before bedtime had Mycroft feeling every relentless year of his age.
“There we are, darling…wait, no-no! Sit still for Mama!” Loki grasped Tony’s wrist mere moments before he could he could rub his face and ruin all of her hard, yet carefully-detailed work.
And speaking of leaks, he also noticed that the sippy of apple juice Bucky was holding on to with both hands like it was for dear life, was nearly empty. Again. As in, this had been the fourth time Steve had refilled it, and that had been ten minutes ago. “Hey, Bucky? Baby?”
Greg held it up and gave it a critical look; “Yeah, but I’m pretty sure it was fuller than this when I handed it to you,” he said, making both John and Sherlock snicker.
He stumbled back, his foot sliding on the candy that had fallen and landing him square on his ass. The fist, refusing to lose its grip on him, followed with him and then...and then, Greg was staring up into Jawns’ face as he loomed over him, grinning wickedly.
Mycroft took a deep breath; he was being ridiculous. Gregory wouldn’t be half as stupid as this, trying to scare him and the babies.
Loki gasped and put her hand over her heart, feigning shock. “What, you don’t want to be Mama’s pretty little princess anymore???”
Steve let the door of the bathroom swing shut, much to Bucky’s relief. He wasn’t really all that eager to go in there either, much less try to wrestle a baby who was already grumpy from the car ride.
“It will if you fancy being able to sit comfortably all day.” John got up and headed for the kitchen, patting Sherlock’s shoulder as he passed. “Go ahead and get her up, love. She needs more than her clothes changed.”
“Jawn, don’t make Daddy count,” he said as he made his way to the ‘playroom’, formally John’s bedroom. “One…”
She joined along in Harry mischievous laughing, until she nearly giggled herself right off the toilet.
Sherlock chewed his bottom lip as he looked down at his dress, his fingers playing with the fuzzy cuffs; “Why, um…why I can’d wear my El'sha one?” he asked John, his eyes pleading.
‘Oh, dear,’ Mycroft thought to himself as he continued to rock and pat and rock and pat...and then rock and pat some more, allowing the baby to have a good cry because sometimes, that was all anyone needed.
The second had him gasping, and he tried to stand up from the sheer, agonizing burn that it left, but Mycroft had him firmly held in place against his his hip.
John cocked his head at that. “Oh, yeah? Is that it, is it? So, we need to make your bum match, too?”
“I asked you first,” she said, watching as Steve finally pried himself free of her pocket and patter over to Bucky, squeaking to be picked up. “Deal with that first, then we gotta go,” she said, half-smiling as she gestured to their stage-5 clinger.
Jawn (who was still sitting at the end of the bed, watching and waiting), in no surprising turn of events, gave Mycroft a look that said ‘Okay, and...?’, and let go of his thumb long enough to hold his arms up.
He felt the beginnings of tears starting to prickle his eyes, and he sniffled. “Da’?...” he tried. His own voice sounded deafening after sitting in the silence of their bedroom.
The sound of his shortened name coming from Mycroft’s mouth once had been bad enough, but twice? In one night?
Bilbo turned away from them and clung to Thorin as tight as his little fists could manage, and squeezed his eyes shut.
The door to their bedroom was still cracked, the way he always left it for the little guy when he was napping, and Steve eased it open and stuck his head in. “…Buck?”
,’ he thought. He was never going to live it down if either Jawn or Sherlock had a nightmare because of this feck’in movie. After putting the milk away and double checking the lids on both cups, he picked them up by their respective handles and followed after his boyfriend.
Steve sat up to look at Thor. “A-ah’nuvver?” he asked, with two of his fingers in his mouth in place of his missing pacifier.
It was then that Jawn sat up and blinked his glassy, red-rimmed eyes at him. “Bu’h,” he croaked in a voice still thick with sleep and tears; “Bu’h, n-n’ah me?”
Both John and Greg began to whoop and cheer as the next two rockets whizzed off with another set of loud bangs and sparks in quick succession, and Sherlock shaded his eyes with his hand as he watched. As much as he hated the noise, he still enjoyed the lights…as long as they stayed far way from–
Bilbo felt Dwalin move his arm and tensed up, ready to be forcibly shoved off his lap because of course, he hated Bilbo and his constant nattering and arguing and uselessness and gods,
Harry had to stop and explain each one in his adorably excited, jabbering way while Severus nodded, until they were well towards the end of his bottomless bag and his little babbling brook of a partner was finally starting to slow down.
“You’re lucky you’re cute,’ Severus said, and playfully whumped his hand against the back of Harry’s nappy. “Let’s see, something new…” he mused and slipped the nipple of his little one’s mouth; “Do you know the story of Amaria Merona and the Pesky Pixies?”
Nat bent to tuck a large, serrated knife into the back of her boot, and nearly knocked Steve over in her haste. “Aw, baby!” She clasped his face in her hands and kissed his forehead; “Why don’t you go sit with Thor, baby boy, before Mommy steps on you by accident!”
Thor, whether consciously or unconsciously, shifted Tony to his other shoulder. “…I wanted to do that, though.”
“Fine,” Ron muttered…once he got his breath back, at least. “See how long it is before I change your soggy bum again!”
Steve hitched the strap of the diaper bag high on his shoulder and took Bucky’s hand. “Let’s try over there, big boy,” he said, and led him over to the nearest table.
Loki had been expecting a fight with this one; he had seen firsthand that Steve Rogers was a tough nut to crack, even with people that were considered to be the mans’ friends. Always with the brave, stoic face that let nothing show, never letting the facade slip, never a hair out of place, never a twitch of the lips that betrayed anything felt beneath the surface.
Ah, fine. Sherlock needed a break from staring at his screen, anyway…at least, if he wanted the fuzzy black ring around his vision to fuck off, at least.
A quiet laugh escaped through Bruce’s nose as he smiled. God, his kids were making him soft. “Tell him to close his eyes and count to ten.”
...Greg is so very, very sorry! Please stop crying, sweetheart, before your Daddy comes down and kicks my--!”
Sherlock smirked; “...So this is that ‘afternoon of activities’ you were spouting off about,” he said, shrugging out of his coat.
“Settle.” Bruce worked Dick’s fingers loose, then brought them up and kissed the scarred, calloused knuckles. “I’m not going anywhere just yet.” Bruce switched the bottle from one hand to the other, and nudged his little boy’s lips. “There…there we are, good boy,” he praised when Dick finally latched on.
“That is an ‘I’m hurt’-cry,” Mycroft said, appearing next to John. He leaned over as well and frowned down into the sitting room; “What. Happened.”
He gazed up at his Daddy and shrugged. He didn’t care if Severus read the phone book, for all he cared.
Greg could see his  initials gleaming from it where they were engraved, taunting him. He exhaled loudly and, quickly as he could, fumbled with the fly of his jeans and shucked them down to mid-thigh.
It was obvious that Mycroft was waiting for him to be the first to speak, though. And Greg...well, he just didn’t want to. Because nothing that he could think of sounded smart enough. But, finally, he sighed and settled on a simple, “I’m sorry, Myc.”
“T-try,” Bucky snuffled. Steve could feel him wiping his snotty face all over his t-shirt. “Yeah, you did. Just too little for big boys pants today, that’s all.”
Greg fell right into them without a moment’s hesitation…God, he was just grateful that it was over!…and that it hadn’t been *five*. He shuddered at the thought.
Bucky hiccuped and gave Steve’s waist a squeeze. There was no urgent need to tell him that he waited a little longer than he should have.
“I! Hel'bed! Ma'ge! Fudge!” Harry giggled breathlessly with each jump upon his Daddy’s bed. His bed was the best for jumping, because it was big and wide and extra springy…!
Thor still didn’t know what the hell that meant, but before he could push the argument further, Tony snuffled into his neck and began to cry.
Greg smiled. He enjoyed these soft, intimate bonding moments that a nappy change brought them, so he always took his time whenever he could. He was fluffing up one of the boys’ nappies when he glanced down at Sherlock, who was humming to himself while sucking his thumb (naturally) and twirling one of his curls around his finger.
“Ah-HA!” Ron leapt forward and reached under the table, grabbing a single, wriggling ankle while Harry shrieked in delight, even through a mouthful or cookie crumbs and icing. “C’mere, you little shi–!”
Mycroft stared at him for what felt like ages...okay, it was maybe five, six minutes at the most, but when even thirty seconds of total silence feels like forever, then five or six minutes of intense scrutiny could easily feel like a lifetime.
“I can’t–” Jawn started to protest, already thinking of the dozen calls he was to cover tomorrow, but Sherlock only shushed him. “You can,” he said, and kissed Jawn’s forehead. “I’ll take care of it. And of you. Starting right now,” he added, and lifted Jawn into his arms.
The change itself went smoothly as well, with Mycroft speaking softly to him the entire time to keep any more tearful outbursts at bay. Jawn didn’t exactly keep up his end with the conversation, but that was fine...Mycroft was more than happy to do all the talking, even if it was about nothing of particular importance, as he wiped the tiny doctor clean and took care to make sure his dampened skin was completely dry before coating him in a fine layer of lavender-scented baby powder. “Your Daddy certainly has a knack for finding the best sort of products, doesn’t he?” he admitted as he read the ingredients on the back of the bottle.
"Dear my wonderful amazing mama who I love so much: will you write Bagginshield for day 10? With Bilbo bein all embarrassed that he needs a change? 😊"
Bruce laughed as he pulled Dick int his lap and returned the favor. “You missed me?” he asked, and gave Dick a kiss on the forehead. “I’ve been home all day, big boy.”
Sherlock smiled to himself, and waited until Jawn had disappeared into the bathroom before carrying his armload of laundry to the wash.
But he guess that he could go potty now, now that Blue was over. He didn’t tell Steve that he’d had to go for awhile now, because Steve would make him go and he would miss seeing what Blue was telling Josh with her clues! And if he missed
“Good decision,” Sherlock said, putting the other pair back. “And that is going to be the last one you’ll have to make for the entire weekend.”
It was the bumper...thingy, that Da’ had gotten for their bed, made to keep small children from rolling off as they made the transition from cribs to big beds.
Jawn went in first with no problem, but Sherlock stopped just inside the doorway, blocking both his brother and Greg. “My’coff!” he whinged, with his small, curly baby-bunches bouncing on either side of his head. “Le’d me as’g a que’th’tion!”
“I thumped his nose.” There. That was over with. The hardest part. “...A bit harder than I meant to.”
Thorin slowed his steps until he could hear the distinct shuffling of distracted Hobbit feet coming up behind him, and then he placed his hand out to catch Bilbo and keep him from going forward. “Just wait with me a moment,” he said, feeling the Hobbits’ puzzled look upon him.
“Well, he certainly shouldn’t go unpunished, accident or no. What else would be fitting of such a crime, hm?” Mycroft continued, and rubbed his hand up and down his baby brothers’ bare back.
He felt another twinge and pressed his thighs together. Okay, now he was going to…oh, what? More Blue was comin’ on?! And it was an episode with Stee'b?!?
Greg flicked the light switch on the other side of the room, flooding the kitchen with fluorescence without warning and nearly blinding all of them in the process. “Sorry,” he said, hand at his forehead to shield some of the light. “So...that was a good one, yeah?” He gave them a weak smile, and an even weaker laugh. “Bein’ Halloween and everthin’...you gotta have one little scare, right?? S’all part of the fun!!”
Usually, when Bucky went down for a nap, the little guy woke himself up about thirty minutes (maaaybe forty-five minutes on a good day) into it and would come search Steve out, then park himself in his lap and doze for another ten, fifteen minutes while he got good and awake.
“And you’re supposed to be the adult who suggests ‘Winnie the Pooh’s Heffalump Halloween’, or, or...or even ‘Hocus Pocus’, for Gods ’sake!” Mycroft folded his arms and looked towards the sitting room, frowning. “They’re both going to be up all night now, in
John smiled, and dipped his head at it; “Go on, it’s all yours if you want it…otherwise I’m just gonna take it for myself,” he added, and slowly started moving the dummy back towards his mouth…
Mycroft stared (or squinted, as his eyes hadn’t adjusted quite yet) at him flatly, Jawn glared, and Sherlock…
good care of!), while Mrs. Weasley was busy and buzzing about with trays of various cookies and pastries and other sweeties.
Steve stood up, and squished Bucky’s cheeks in his hands. “Good job, baby!” he said, and landed a big, congratulatory kiss on the forehead.
Sherlocks’ bottom lip wobbled as he shook his head with the enthusiasm of a wet dog, his curls swishing fast enough that Greg actually felt a breeze coming off of them. He tightened his grip on the little detectives’ slender waist to keep him from toppling onto the floor and starting a whole new fuss all over again.
“Silly boy…here, come show Daddy everything you got from the Weasley’s. You clearly made out like a bandit,” Severus said, placing another kiss on Harry’s shoulder as he carried his little one over to his bags. “Like this,” he said, plucking at the cozy, plush onesie he was wearing. “Who thought to give my little fawn his antlers?”
! You know that the legs are the best part…can Daddy have a bite, huh?” Stephen teased with little pinches along Tony’s thigh…not enough to hurt, but to serve as a distraction. “Can I have this piece? Or this piece?? Can I have a nibble here?!”
God, deliver him. John sighed and slumped back in his chair. He needed to get this kid to take a dummy, he thought as he rubbed his hand over his face. Like, right now. After all this screaming, maybe he could get him to take a bottle.  “Do you want your–”
John was handling video appointments in one of the spare rooms. Mycroft, of course, was working in his office. That left Greg to his own devices downstairs...well, ‘his own’ including one very congested and unhappy-about-it Little.
let go, just a little bit--I have to into the kitchen to turn them back on. And I have to check on Uncle Gregory.” He really hoped Greg was out of the shower by now...the man was accident prone on his best days, let alone when he was suddenly cast into darkness while covered in hot water and soap on a slick surface such as the shower.
“Uh, okay…?” Instantly, a dozen thoughts raced through Bilbo’s mind–were they missing something? Was there danger ahead? Did Thorin need him for something? Did–
So, here they were, with Sherlock strapped into his booster seat (to keep from having a repeat case of the Missing Detective) and fighting sleep with every fiber of his cantankerous being while John sat at the kitchen table, defeated, with his elbow propping his chin up and a dummy hooked over one finger.
Bruce winced. Ouch. “I know,” he said, rubbing his hand up and down his little boy’s back. “Daddy got busy. That’s his fault…bad Daddy,” he sighed.
Dwalin tore into a loaf of bread; “Still there,” he mumbled through a mouthful, and nodded towards the thicket. “Nursin’ his wounds.”
“–Before you start, I’m sorry,” Greg blurted. “I know I snapped, and I shouldn’t have, not when he’s Little like that, but I lost my head and I did, and I’m sorry, so can we just get this over with so I can go tell him I’m sorry?”
.” he snapped, and Jawn had the fleeting thought that Mycroft was either the bravest man in the world, or stark-raving mad.
Mycroft dropped his sparkler and both brothers were on her in an instant, looking her over; “What, what happened? What’s wrong? Are you alright?! Did you burn yourself–?!” they fussed in turn, with Mycroft trying to look at her hands for possible burns and Sherlock attempting to get her to look up at him and tell him what was wrong.
Thorin laughed heartily as he took the new cloths and unfolded them. “Seems we’ve rubbed off on you already! Raise y’er little arse then!“
“Hm. Well, we’ll discuss it first, before there’s to be any more ‘thumping’,” Mycroft said, looking down at Sherlock as John left the room. Greg sat back and groaned internally--that sounded incredibly ominous.
So, that night, when Sherlock was awoken at the bright and early hour of 3 am by a certain little Houdini plopping her pampered bottom onto his midsection and driving every particle of air out of his lungs, he was determined to figure this out once and for all.
Harry, clad only in a fresh nappy and his brand new, baby-soft jumper that Mrs. Weasley had given him just that morning, darted down the stairs and into the kitchen. Mr. Weasley was sat at the table, looking over one of Harry’s muggle toys (that he promised to take
“Don’ want to–” Bilbo started to complain, and then squawked when he felt himself being lifted and dragged over. “Thorin, no!” he fussed. “It hurts too much…!”
John narrowed his eyes. Nope. Not buying the ‘poor baby’ act just yet. “You know, this would literally be one thousand times easier if you would just–”
Dick sighed and sagged against his Da’da’s chest, finally content. “Y’ah, bu’d I ha’bn’t see’d you.”
Sherlock sniffled again, and John was quick to catch his arm before he could rub his nose along the delicate fabric (and create a whole new problem). “Ah’pise?”
Harry hopped from one corner of the bed to the other; "Harry!” he grumbled, lowering his voice to imitate the older wizard; “I’b you bra’ge my bed I bra’ge you bum!”
“You’re wet, is that it?” Steve slowly rocked him from side to side and rubbed is back reassuringly. “That’s okay…it’s okay, baby doll, it happens. You were sleepin’ good, that’s all.”
“I know.” Thorin settled Bilbo on his lap, facing him, and made him lay against his chest as he held him and took over rubbing his bum.
He felt the hot flood he’d been holding back finally release, filling his pull-up from front to back in an instant and begin dribbling down his legs.
“You did–?” Steve started to ask, and then stopped when he noticed that, uh, Bucky’s pull-up was more than a little saggy. And yellow, where it used to be white.
“Yeah,” he said with a quiet laugh, and patted his lap. “Come keep me company and have a lie-down at the same time. Kill two birds with one stone."
Finally, a tiny voice drifted from the room; “…No coun’d,” it said, in quite possibly the saddest way that Sherlock had ever heard.
"Struggling lil jawn being comforted after a really rough week leaves him aching and limping even in headspace? For day 8"
Harry pulled his arm free from the plush, hooded dragon towel he was wrapped in, and tapped his lips. “Hmmm…only one?” he asked in a tiny voice, peeking at Hermione over his shoulder.
Now that the shock of being thunked in the nose had worn off, Sherlock was realizing that no, he was
“I was strong-armed,” Greg replied…and dodged another swipe of the pencil. “Okay, no. Nope, uh-uh, I can’t do this,” he said, and scooted Sherlock off from his lap with a speed that left the little tyke speechless, and got up from the chair. “Nope. Can’t.”
I’ve loved every second of this past month, from gaining new followers and interacting with them more (both new and old), and writing new fandoms and characters that I’ve never written before, and not only starting a story but FINISHING it within 24 hours!
“Maaaaamaaaaa!” Tasha wailed as she sank to the floor at Loki’s feet right in the middle of the very crowded cafe they were supposed to be having lunch in.
Molly slowly turned her head and blinked up at him, still in her unicorn-clouded haze, and whimpered as she clung to her toys’ neck.
Mycroft raised an eyebrow at him; “Well, actually I was just going to tell you off and put you down for a nap, considering the amount of ‘peer pressure’ you’ve endured. From an infant,” he added, with a sly smile.
Eh, he thought as he brushed Dick’s hair back from his forehead. That was a problem for future Bruce.
Greg blushed from the tips of his ears to the tips of his toes (probably), and cleared his throat. “Aw’right, be right back.”
Steve gathered up the diaper bag, grinning to himself. He loved being able to put a smile that big on Bucky’s face…especially when all it took was the promise of chicken nuggets.
Mycroft took a big, deep breath, making his chest puff out…and blew a very rude (and wet!) raspberry at him.
with Molly there for the weekend. “And it’s not even that big of a deal, but when I noticed the pile of our training pants disappearing at a rate faster than John or I were wearing, well…” he gestured with his hand; “-
Sure, there was a very real possibility of getting his arse smacked any minute now, but...fuck it. He really did love their off-the-rails dynamic. His little family.
He stepped towards the edge of the bed and patted his chest with both hands. “Here, little fawn, come see Daddy…did you know I missed you very much?”
Harry nodded, smiling from ear to ear even as he rubbed his eyes. “Try sh’ome!” he said, stifling a yawn.
Greg loosed himself from Mycroft’s hug with a sigh and went to pull up his jeans, but…and by God, he doesn’t know what got into him!… he stopped short and wiggled his pants-covered arse at him. "Yes, sir!"
Loki angled himself until he faced Steve, resting his chin on his shoulder as it was propped on the back of the couch, exuding calm. “Oh,
,’ Greg thought with a smile, and started towards the kitchen. He’d only just reached out for the lightswitch when--
Bilbo sniffed, and rubbed his cheek along Thorin’s coat. He wanted to go home. Or at the very least, go to sleep right away and hope they all packed up and left him in the morning.
“Yep, when Bucky sits and goes potty like a big boy,” Steve said again, completely tickled…God, this was cute. “What do you say to Stephen for giving you such a nice present?”
Bilbo took one bite…and then ate ravenously, scooping mouthful after mouthful of surprisingly delicious beef and broth into his mouth, until his spoon was no longer sufficient and he used his bread to sop up the rest instead.
The little one didn’t give an answer, but neither did he scream or fuss when Mycroft took him by the shoulders and gently ‘helped’ him lie back, so he considered that a win.
Jawn, who really hadn’t taken notice of Sherlock’s arrival at all, despite everyones’ expectations (least of all Mycrofts’, who’d witnessed the little ones’ broken heart firsthand!), finally let his attention be taken from the game. He looked up, met Sherlock’s gaze, and…
There was a loud click as the bedside lamp was switched on, and Jawn found himself blinking up at Mycroft.
“Thank God you’re food motivated. Fine, we’ll have pizza tonight, and ice cream at the park tomorrow. That is, if you’re letting your dear ole’ Uncle Greg go?”
“He’s fine, he’s fine,” Greg said quickly. “Nobody’s hurt, monkey; it’s just a silly little mix-up because he forgot what ‘tier four’ means…apparently,” Greg grumbled.
Of course, he wasn’t expecting an answer...not from the little one, at least. Wasn’t even asking him to start with.
The sudden transition from a state of blaringly loud, boisterous chaos to stock-still, deafening silence is always eerie...to go from a pair of overgrown toddlers screaming, struggling, and stumbling over each other in the rush to escape to gripping each other in wide-eyed, chest-heaving terror from a single shout was nothing short of awe-inspiring (and it was one of the many reasons Mycroft was so successful in politics).
Bruce stood still. And silent. Which Dick couldn’t decide made anything better or worse. he blushed furiously, and buried his face in the crook of his Da’da’s neck.
Loki continued to glare at the table beside them, daring the mysteriously (maybe wisely) silent occupants to say something. ”Don’t. Encourage. Her,” he said, slowly.
Greg had his chair reclined back as far as it would go, as you do when you’re havin’ a lazy day, and he and the tyke were giving the new ‘Unsolved Mysteries’ series a go. He was enjoying it so far, but the same couldn’t be said for Sherlock...between the lackluster reaction to the show and the steady hand patting the back of his nappy, Greg suspected he might have dozed off. Which would be a small blessing, considering the little guy hadn’t felt well at all.
“Well, no…” Bilbo began to say that he didn’t really mind, because they’d dry just as fast by the fire, but before he could utter another word Thorin was hauling him up and sitting him on his hip before splashing through the stream.
Bucky’s eyes lit up at the sound of her voice, and he clapped excitedly; “B’yue!” he giggled, and then patted the plastic puppy on the head.  “I’ds B’yue! Hi!!!”
Greg winced...he wasn’t being yelled at, and Mycroft was still smiling, but the implication behind the words was still sharp. “I can come help,” he offered weakly. He’d been planning on it, anyway. “I can get them washed and dressed; you don’t need to--”
stop, nor did he ‘get back here’. He took off like a shot down the hallway, giggling like a fiend, and was halfway down the stairs when Ron came out of the bedroom, waving Harry’s trousers bunched in his fist. “I said COME BACK!”
Which, thinking back, may not have been the most prudent of decisions, for Greg just shrugged back at him; “It’s a special occasion, love,” he said. “Let ‘em squeeze out the last bit of Halloween magic.”
Sherlock mulled this over, and chewed on his fingers until Mycroft gently moved his hand away from his mouth. He tilted his head back and blinked up at his brother. “Hmm?”
Jawn laughed at that…his Daddy could be hilarious at the most unexpected times. He laid his head on Sherlock’s shoulder as he carried him towards their bedroom.  “I mean the calls…”
It was naturally soothing, of course, and with Sherlock having an overwhelming need for oral fixation, it also gave him one central focus for all of the restless, pent up energy that sleepiness nights left him with.
“You do as much as you can, and then some,” Sherlock interrupted. “And that’s all you can do.” He stepped back and took Jawn’s chin in his hand again, and gently made him meet his gaze; “…You need a break,” he said softly.
“Yes, darling, what is it?” she cooed, putting all of her attention back on him, and kissed his cheek.
“Do you need to go potty? You’ve been slugging back that juice like it’s going out of style, punk-face.”
“He does, and it’s perfectly suited for royalty–Tony, that’s not for chewing, dumpling!” Loki snatched the make-up brush from Tony’s little mitts just as he was about to stuff it in his waiting mouth, making him squawk angrily.
Harry giggled to himself…it was always a little funny when on got in trouble, as long as it wasn’t too serious.
Greg was glaring at the mess while wondering if getting the broom from the closet would help, or if that was just a thing they did in cartoons. “Yeah?”
“Noooooooo, it po’ges me!” Harry wiggled, remembering the time he’d sat on the little horned beastie.
“Turn’a ligh’ds ba’g on, My’coff?” Sherlock asked with a trembling voice, grasping the cuff of Mycroft’s pajama bottoms in his clenched fist.
Steve blew a puff of air between his lips…man, his heart was still pounding from hearing Bucky screech like that. “I’m not mad, baby. Don’t ever,
“Um…chi’bs?” Jawn followed every instruction as Sherlock stripped him of his clothes and went about changing him into a nappy, feeling every worry, every fear, every stress slip away until there was…
Steve grinned as he taped a clean diaper nice and smug around the little guy’s hips. “I bet I can eat more than you!”
, no...sh-sh-shhh,” Mycroft shushed him, and pulled him close for a half hug. “It’s alright; there’s nothing--”
“He really didn’t,” Sherlock cut in…as much as he loved getting Greg’s goat, the last thing he wanted to do was start a fight, especially tonight, of all nights.And
Jawn tilted his head back at the touch, breaking the suction he had on his bottles’ nipple with a sucking pop, and beamed up at Mycroft. “My’!” he babbled as he pointed at the level, just in case Mycroft had missed anything on the screen that was directly in front of his face. “My’, my’!”
Steve grinned. God, he had the cutest baby ever. “You wanna play the animal game?” he asked, smiling as he gently laid Bucky back on the changing table and unsnapped his onesie. “You wanna help me fix my island, yeah? You’re better at catching the spiders.”
“M-Ma-ma,” stammered as Loki lifted her into his lap, her face a mess of tears and snot. He brushed back the hair that was plastered to her cheek, and reached for the top buttons of his shirt; “Shhhh, calm down…yes, you’re getting what you were after, you little lamprey.”
“Sh-sh’orry,” Sherlock parroted, and then slipped his thumb in his mouth as his tears began to slow.
It was quiet again. Mostly, at least, save for the soft thumping of Bruce’s hand against Dick’s diaper and the quiet ‘nuk-nuk-nuk’ of his suckling.
Harry could feel the fire start up behind him, the flames creating a lovely, glowing heat at his back.
“Ask it inside, darling,” Mycroft replied in a huff of frozen breath that caught the air. Even under the powder and rouge he wore, his cheeks were chapped raw. “This dress isn’t doing big brother any favours out here.”
“He is! I was only making suggestions–!” Hermione started to protest, but stopped when she felt a series of gentle taps on her arm. “A’mione,” Harry said, patting her with the tips of his fingers to get her attention. “A’mione…!”
Dick’s eyes shot open and the biggest, sweetest smile ever split his face. “DA’DA!” he cried as he sat up and half-crawled out of Alfred’s lap and flopped over onto Bruce, who he wrapped up in the bestest hug! “I MISS’D YOU!”
Mycroft rolled his eyes as he carried Jawn out of the room. “Well, yes...Gregory, of course,” he tutted; “but that’s hardly a fair competition to begin with.”
And he very much was, a Bruce was already scanning the room for a place to sit and take a certain stubborn little boy over his knee…until he heard the distinct, teary sniffle that meant said little boy was being sincere.
“So, it was the shot that caused him to fall ill?” Thor asked, his brow etched with concern as he watched the tiny little man bundled up on his chest, fast asleep. Thor gently laid a broad hand on his back, feeling the steady rise and fall of each raspy breath, as well as the feverish heat radiating off of him. “I thought it was supposed to prevent the sickness…?”
“Wow.” John sounded impressed. He took a sip of his morning coffee before passing the cup to Sherlock; “I don’t think we’re going to get that to fit in the back of a cab.”
“Indeed,” sighed Alfred, and the fact that Bruce could hear the relief in his voice was a testament to how rough of a time his big boy must be having tonight.
He turned forward again, nudged Dwalin to get his attention, then grunted and ticked his head back in Bilbo’s direction.
Mycroft ignored him in favour of the baby. “Chewing your dummy again, you silly thing,” he playfully admonished, leaning in close to nuzzle Sherlock behind the ear with his nose. “You know better, but Gregory should have been nicer than that, shouldn’t he?”
Sherlock had gone stiff at the sight of the dummy, expecting another round, but when he’d seen what John had done instead, he relaxed. He was also increasingly intrigued..
Ahhh, so that was it. John gave a quiet laugh and took Sherlock’s hands in his own; “Because the Elsa dress is a play costume, sweetheart, and this isn’t a costume party.”
“F’an’goo,” Sherlock said, trying to aim the spout of the cup at his mouth without taking his eyes off the screen.
! “Greg is so-so-so-so sorry, you’re okay though! Yes, you’re okay! It was an accident!” He repeated over and over, making a mantra out of it, because as long as he said ‘You’re okay!”  enough times then it really would be okay, out of principle.
“Watch out baby, let Mommy just–wait, hang on, just a second!” Natasha side-stepped around Steve to get into her closet and finish gathering up her knives. Oh, and the grenades. Both the flash ones and blow-shit-up ones. “Do you have enough ammo?!” she called out to Bucky, who was in another part of the house doing the same mad-dash grab over every weapon he could think of.
Mycroft chalked the attitude up to a combination of being wet and more tired than he’d ever admit, even with the extra sugar piled on. “Here, why don’t you come sit with big brother and Jawn?” he asked, patting the cushion beside him. “You can bring some of your sweeties with you.”
Greg rubbed his hands over his face, and finally peeked out at Mycroft from between them. “What, uh. what about…”
Sherlock, who’d been watching the space where his brother had vanished, now looked at Greg and blinked as if he’d forgotten he was still there. “Wha’d?” he asked, his voice still thick and raspy.
Mycroft sighed; he’d hoped both of the boys would be exhausted by now, after trooping through neighborhood after neighborhood and lugging admittedly successful (i.e, unexpectedly
’ me!” the halfling snapped. “You’re not going to…THORIN!” he squawked as he was suddenly grasped by the wrist and pulled off the trail.”NO!”
Thor smiled fondly as he watched his little brother fuss over his little ‘dumpling’, petting and cooing over her now that she was settled. He propped his elbow on the table and rested his cheek against his fist, and thought about how much the look on Loki’s face as he gazed down at Natasha reminded him of the way their Mother would look at them.
Greg forced a cough to counteract the (quite frankly) obnoxious chortling noise that he was still making, and wiped the tears out of his eyes with the heel of his hand. “G-Greg’s s-sorry, muffin-” He stopped to clear his throat and cough again...there, that ought to do it. The last thing he wanted to do was make the baby cry again. “Baby, I’m sorry,” he said again, and meant it. “I really am. I’ve said it a hundred times, and I’ll say it a million more until you believe me.”
Dick, who’d been perfectly comfortable the way he was, whined and clutched at Bruce’s shirt…he couldn’t leave yet, he’d just gotten here!
Sherlocks’ ears perked up. The flat was silent. Very silent. Even the street level noise (what little there was that lockdown had reduced it to) had dissipated to less than a murmur.
"Only one is mine,” Mycroft sniffed, and handed one of them back to Greg as he came down off the footstool.
Mycroft melted right then and there; Tiny Jawn was such a little sweetheart. “Yes, wash your face,” he said, and slid the overgrown babe off of his lap and onto the bed. Which was all well and good, until he stood up and felt Jawn clutch his sleeve with a small whimper.
Hot, stinging tears welled in Steve’s eyes, turning his vision blurry until they spilled over down his cheeks. He took a deep, shaky breath and, letting his pacifier fall out of his mouth, began to wail.
“Hm. What if…” Mycroft paused to think for a moment; usually when either of the boys were tiny, all they needed to be satisfied was a warm lap, a warm blanket, and a warm bottle. Jawn currently had two out of the three, but he was still a forlorn little biscuit. “What if…” Mycroft mused; “What if we went to the park? You like to visit the ducks, don’t you?”
But anyway, he would go down on one knee and thank anyone who was listening, that he had Bucky back. His Little Bucky. Or, his once-big-then-little-then-bigger-again-but-now-mostly-Little Bucky.
"Hello! Anon who made the Steve request here: Can I amend my ask by Adding Mommy Natasha to the scenario too???"
Of course, keeping in mind the fact that she wasn’t a literal baby accounted for a lot of it. She would just unbuckle herself from the highchair, or unlatch the playpen, and then count on being adorable to keep from getting into too much trouble. Which worked, for the most part…save for the time Mycroft caught her picking some not-to-be-picked flowers in his garden when she was meant to be behind the baby gate.
“E’ssa’ckly! I’sh ear’yee!” he said…or, at least that’s how Harry would’ve replied, if he wasn’t interrupted by his own body betraying him with a jaw-cracking yawn.
“Later,” Mycroft interrupted. “I’m tired. The boys are tired. And they still need to be bathed and changed for bed,” he added. “Oh, and they’ll need to be convinced that nothing else is going to jump out and scare them shitless again.”
, there was nothing funny about this poor, sad, mucky pup who, despite being in tears, was still trying to clean himself up.
Molly sat up on her kneed and reached through the bars to lift the mattress up again, and used the coat hanger to hook the patch and lock the panel back in place. Then she sat back on her heels and looked over her shoulder at Sherlock; “Ah-d’ah!” she chirped, holding her tool up proudly.
Sherlock sighed. So much for this robe, he thought. Oh, well…it’s not as if he hadn’t been covered in much, much worse substances than this, especially at the morgue.
He felt a broad hand come to rest on his lower back and begin making slow, comforting circles with its thumb; “Poor monkey,” they cooed. “Waking up wet and alone...what a terrible tragedy.”
“BIG SCA’WY!” both boys cheered, just as Jawn upended his entire bag of candy onto the floor in a shower of bright, shiny wrappers. A popcorn ball wrapped in cellophane dotted with grinning Jack o’ Lanterns bounced out of the pile and rolled across the floor.
“…Never once saw her deny you, though. No matter who was there, what was being said, she’d pick you up and free herself and
Sherlock’s bottom lip poked out, but he obediently stood and let his brother up. “Bu’d, our can’ny,” he said in quite possibly the saddest voice that Greg or Mycroft had heard so far during the entire course of their babysitting career.
And...nope, not even a smile. Just a big pair of big, wet eyes blinking up at him dolefully while making the softest of sounds as he sucked his thumb.
, it won’t just be ‘a little bit’, but before he could Jawn decided to chime in. “P’ease, My’coff?” he asked quietly, as opposed to Sherlock’s near hysterics. He stepped closer, and Mycroft could see the sparkle in his eyes behind the sponged-on dark circles. He took a corner of Mycroft’s sequined sleeve and gave it a small tug; “C’n we? C’n we wa’sh one mo’bie? Jus’ one? An’ then ba’ff?”
, wai’d!” Dick wailed. He struggled against Bruce as he carried him towards the bathroom, trying anything to break his grip; he shoved with his hands and he kicked with his feet until Bruce finally had enough and reached over to give his mostly unprotected backside a sharp swat and that was the worst thing he could do, because then he…he couldn’t…he…
“If we walked as much as you all drank…” Bilbo muttered under his breath–he could be impulsive, but he wasn’t stupid. And his bum still ached enough to not want to chance a repeat performance.
“Let’s go find Daddy, hm?” Mycroft kissed the side of Sherlock’s head as he carried him out of the room. “You and Daddy can play while I make sure our Gregory gets all the rest he needs, yes…!”
Sherlock sat up and reached for Mycroft, and John gladly passed him over to the elder Holmes. “Here, take ‘im,” John said as Sherlock settled quite nicely on Mycrofts’ hip. “I’m gonna bring the nappy bag in here, then I have to get back to the calls.” He started to leave, but paused and turned back; “And then I’m gonna come back and thump Greg. On the nose,” he said, grinning as he gave Sherlock a tiny peck of a kiss on his nose, making him smile. “
The smile slowly left Gregs’ face; whenever Mycroft dropped the latter half of his name and shortened it to ‘Greg’, he knew he was in the shit...like,
Now, there was a fail safe built into the bottom of the crib in case of emergency, in the form of a trapdoor under the mattress…but every single time Sherlock or John were awoken by their tiny escapee climbing into bed with them (or by getting into something she shouldn’t and making an awful lot of noise), that would be the first thing that they checked.
A low moan escaped from Sherlock’s lips; “I jus’ wan’ the ligh’ds back on!” he pleaded, the waver in his voice threatening tears.
“There we are,” Mycroft said, kissing the top of the babys' head as he held the bottle to his lips. “Now, what else are we to do until your Daddy gets home, hm?”
I can’t believe it’s been a month already, and that Christmas is over and in a little less than 24 hours, we’ll be in an entirely new year!
Sherlock reached back and swatted at his brothers’ ankle...or the air around it, at least.  “Sssst’aaahhh’b!” he whinged.
Sherlock stared at him for a moment...then turned his face back into Jawn’s shirt, and began to cry in earnest.
“Aye.” Dwalin took another mouthful and went to wash it down. “Started arguin’ with me again, so I smacked his uppity little arse.” He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. “Settled him right down.”
“Just as I know that you’re not denying the fact that we should have been home nearly two hours ago if you had kept your enormous mouth shut, Gavin.”
“O’gay!” Bucky said happily…he was always happy to be a big helper, and not only that, he was gonna get
One thing was for certain...he would never again question Sherlocks’ judgement when warning of just how very, very tiny Jawn could be.
It seems that he’d been outnumbered. “...Alright,” Mycroft said as he dragged his wig off, eliciting squeals from the little ones’ and a goofy, giant grin from his boyfriend. “ONE movie,” he said, raising his voice over the cheers and holding up one finger with a sense of finality. He then turned to Greg; “Get them settled in the sitting room,” he added. “I
Bucky got up from the kitchen table, the only place he was allowed to play with his playdough since ‘The Bed Incident’, and eventually found Steve in their bedroom, beaming like an idiot and watching Buck expectantly. On the bed, there sat a big-ish cardboard box.
“I bet it can; it’s a good place to keep them safe.” Steve bent down and kissed his belly, making Bucky scrunch and yank his shirt back down. “St’aaaaahb,” he giggled.
“I jus’ wann’a fini’ss a mo’bie, My’coff,” Sherlock whinged...he couldn’t go five minutes without being interrupted, for pete’sakes! “P’ease--!”
Big, fat,  (mostly) crocodile tears rolled down Tony’s cheeks when he realized that no, he was not getting picked up and cuddled. He sank back against the Cloak’s soft folds, and began to cry.
“Aw, oh no,” Sherlock cooed, rocking her. “I know it is, poor thing…do you want to go back inside? Ye-es, we can go back inside,” he said, petting her hair as she nodded her head ‘yes’.
He was nearly asleep. She bent forward and ghosted a soft kiss on his forehead, and smiled when his face crinkled up at the touch.
Mycrofts’ heart seized in a moment of pure panic. “Ah, no,” he said, quickly taking the phone back, garnering himself an indignant squawk from the baby. “You’re not mucking about with my score...here,” he added quickly, flipping through the rest of his apps and tapping on ‘Candy Crush: Jelly Saga’, then giving the phone back to the child before any more tears were had; “Try this one, darling...I didn’t get terribly far into it.”
The tiny doctor, who had been sitting with his eyes closed, hands curled around his bottle (and had been trying to tap out a message in morse code to Mycroft with his fingers, the way he did with Daddy when either of them felt too small to talk, and was getting a bit sad when Mycroft didn’t tap back), sat up and reached for the phone in Mycrofts’ hand, his eyes wide open and gleaming.
Guess he was going to have to change the kid in the grass, because the car wasn’t an option…Bucky was too big to lay on the backseat and Steve’s shoulders were too wide to lean in comfortably to change him. And Bucky would end up leaking and needing a change of clothes if they got back in and tried to find another place to stop along the highway.
“We’ll save it for tomorrow.” Severus tucked the small package in the pocket of his robe and lifted Harry into his arms, thanks to the small weightlessness charm that Severus had cast on all of Harry’s nappies. “It’s bedtime for all tiny witches and wizards.”
God, but she was cute. Sherlock knelt down to retrieve the nappy supplies from their place under the bed. “And a nappy? Does she need a nappy, too?”
“It’s only gone in the closet...for now.” Mycroft followed him, still glowing from the satisfaction of a well-done scare (and from a good scrub in the shower). “What movie did the little darlings pick? Casper? Goosebumps?” he asked again.
Thorin kept his eyes on the company, until they were a suitable distance away. “Bilbo…” he sighed. By the Gods, did it have to be such a battle
John appeared at the top of the stairs, his forehead creased (more than usual) with worry; “ ‘ey, what happened???!” he called again, leaning over the banister.
, Greg’s sorry, muffin!” Greg rattled off as he watched the baby’s eyes begin to water. He pulled the lever on the chair to lower the footrest so he could sit up with Sherlock still bundled in his arms. God, please just don’t let him
The smug look that had taken hold on Sherlocks’ face faltered; he had known that the chance of Jawn being upset upon waking up to find him gone were great, but (and he was loathe to admit this, too) he and Mycroft did have a sweet fondness for each other. If there was anyone other than Sherlock himself that could console the former soldier while (very) deep in his headspace, it would be Mycroft and Greg.
“That’s because you’re so terribly clever,” Mycroft said, drawing his crying little brother into his lap. “We had a bit of a scare though, didn’t we?”
He wasn’t about to let Dick know that, though. “One,” he counted, and was met with the poutiest bottom lip as Dick glared up at him.
"Not the point." Severus folded the jumper and set it back on top of Harry’s bag; “Potter,” he said in the old way he used to scold his former student as he turned towards the bed, hands on his hips.
Most days, though, were right in the middle of those two extremes. Most were better. Some were a little worse. Most had patches of both.
being a Mama. He loved having so many dumplings flocking under his wing now, especially his lovely little fiery-haired (with a temper to match) malyshka, who was his, and only his.
“I don’t fuss that much,” Bilbo grumbled, and begrudgingly climbed off of Thorin’s admittedly cozy lap.
Sherlock scrunched his shoulder and giggled at the sensation, then reached up and gently grabbed Mycrofts’ nose.
Bucky frowned at the very thought. “…O’gay,” he sighed, and held his arms up for Steve to lift him onto the table.
Mycroft rolled his eyes; “Oh, oh of course, the phone! That’s what perks you up.” He made sure to close out his email, and then placed the phone in Jawns’ waiting hand. “Children and their electronics these days...incorrigible,” he muttered.
Bilbo felt a lump of fear rise in his throat and swallowed thickly, and then–completely against his own will, damn it all!–
“Yes, well…” Mycroft drawled, his chin resting nicely on top of Jawns’ head; “You left an extremely maudlin child behind,” he added, and lazily turned his gaze to his brother and gave him a wry smile. “It makes an afternoon of fun and games a bit tricky when one of the players can’t stop crying for ‘Daddy’.”
Dick sat up and peered at him; “…Bubb’as?” he asked timidly, his words muffled by his thumb in his mouth.
Greg moved his hands and sat up; “I didn’t mean to! Not that hard!” he said. “He was chewing his dummy again, like you didn’t want him to, and I was just gonna, y’know, just tap him on the nose, all teasin’ like, and it slippedandhithimharderthanImeanttoandI’msosorrymuffin,” Greg finished in one winded breath, his shoulders slumping as he looked up at everyone pleadingly.
“Yeah, you! It’s all you tonight, big man!” Bucky poked Steve’s tummy, making him scrunch over giggling, and then gave him a big, smacking wet kiss on the cheek. “Love you, baby,” he said, placing Steve on his feet. “Keep Thor safe and make him eat something other than poptarts.”
“Well, the little…bugger ran off on me!” Ron shouted over the squealing as he dragged a kicking, squealing overgrown toddler out from under the table.
perfect) and, just as Molly knew he would, then grabbed the unicorn by her horn and lay her on his other shoulder. “Have you named them yet?” he asked, kissing her on the cheek as he carried them both towards the bedroom.
The expression on that little face! “I, I d-did not ‘punch you in the f-face’!” he wheezed, unable to catch his breath. “I-it was b-barely a, a
Bruce sighed…contrary to the wildly popular beliefs of his children, he didn’t always want to be ‘mean Da’da’. He didn’t like counting to three anymore than they did. “We’re going,” he said, standing back up. He stepped around behind Dick and before the little guy could scurry away, scooped him up under the arms and lifted him onto his hip.
“I’m still not all that fond of them now,” Sherlock frowned, rubbing his hands together from the chill in the air. “Nothing ever needs to be that noisy for any reason.”
“You don’t need them,” Thorin said, pausing by the stream to let the halfling catch up. “It’ll be warm enough by the fire, and we’ll see if you need a change sooner. D'yah want me to pick you up?”
Mycroft tilted his head, listening expectantly, but remained quiet while he let Greg work it out for himself.
Sherlock was glad that he had his mouth covered…not just for the obvious reason, but so that Jawn couldn’t see him grinning like an idiot while stifling his laughter.
“C’n ha’b a sh’tory, Da’yee?” he asked, gently playing with a lock of Severus’s hair by twirling it around his finger. “Jus’ one? P’yea’sh?”
“Aw, I can’t? Wait, what about this super tasty little bite right here?” Stephen pinched up a little piece of flesh and lowered his face to take a ‘bite’…and in one fluid motion, (and blocked from Tony’s view by the top of his head), he poked the needle in and depressed the plunger.
Greg took a deep, *deep* breath that made his lungs ache, and did as he was told. When he felt Mycroft’s arm wrap around his waist to hold him flush at his side, he squeezed his eyes shut.
“Young Steve!” he said jovially, clapping his hands together in excitement. “What shall we partake in first this evening?! A race with the Karts of Mario? A hunt for eight-legged beasts at the Animal’s Crossing? Or–”
Every time they would put Molly in something that was supposed to keep her in place…it wouldn’t. Be it the high chair, the playpen, the booster seat, the baby harness (that they’d gotten
Though he barely felt it ( and he was hardly going to encourage a stronger one), Greg yelped as if he’d been kicked and jerked his hand back. “OUCH! Oh, ouch, ouchie, owwie, ow!” He shook the ‘sting’ out of his hand, even blowing on it, and then pouted at Sherlock; “We even now, muffin?”
“You just don’t remember drinking it,” Mycroft snapped. “And what about you?” he asked, gesturing to the two that Sherlock still held.
Jawn took the cup without a word, his eyes wide as he watched the vampire on screen pulling up the gas lines to the main characters house...and then setting them on fire.
Stephen felt his heart break. Even the Cloak seemed to feel badly, as they gently swung Tony back and forth and brushed his cheeks with their soft fabric ‘hands’.
Yet, it was cuter than anything ever ought to be, even if it did make Greg a little sad that his muffin was still upset with him. “Aw, why not?” he asked, turning on his own pout and batting his lashes at the baby.
Severus didn’t know exactly what ‘water guns’ were, but if the word ‘water’ and the larges nozzles were anything to go by…
A gloved hand reached through, and placed a bottle of children’s chewable Tylenol into Bruce’s waiting hand. It disappeared, and then reappeared with Tony’s favorite Cookie Monster bottle, already full of what Thor assumed to be warm milk. Bruce took it, and then the hand reached further until it gently booped Tony on the nose, making him smile and gurgle.
“Just a little accident!” Greg called back over Sherlock’s cries. “It’s all right!” He rubbed what he hoped was a comforting hand up and down the little one’s heaving back, hoping that John would take that at face value and let Greg handle it, at least before--
"It'd be a shame is Gregs shiny new paddle in Not so silent night only got used once ;) ;) can we see it be put to good use again for day 15?"
little brother who insisted.” Greg finally found the conveniently hard-to-find milk and turned around to face Mycroft, using his foot to close the refrigerator door behind him. “They wanted somethin’ scary, so I put on somethin’ scary!”
“Hey, Tones,” Bruce cooed as he tucked Tony into the crook of his arm. “Yeah, I know, you don’t feel good at all, huh.” He leaned over and snagged one of the blankets draped over the couch and wrapped it around the little guy. “Well, we’re gonna fix that, yeah? Just as soon as Thor brings us a bottle, yes!”
He stumbled over tree roots and sticks, making quite the ruckus as he approached the thicket. “…Bilbo?”
He went to reach for Thorin again, but the other dwarf had already moved past, and was going over to sit between Gloin and Oin.
Doubly so when he reopened his eyes and dared to peek up again, only to be met with a big, whiskery kiss to his forehead.
She had sat down on the couch with him that day, and smiled at the startled look on his face when he noticed who it was, even though as far as Steve knew
“You told me you wanted to be a big boy today,” Bruce said as he knelt down to Grayson’s level…which was floor level, while playing with his Legos. Which also made Bruce cautious about where he was kneeling. “And big boys use the potty.”
Jawn dropped the clump of soiled, sticky baby wipes and fell against him, hiding his face in the crook of Sherlocks’ neck and wrapping his arms around him while babbling and crying.
Now, though? Now, he’d woken up in the dark, in a bed (with cold sheets, at that!), by himself. Alone.
“Staaaaahp!” she said, swatting back at his hand even as she did as she was told, and followed Greg outside. Sherlock and John were next, with Sherlock putting his arm around John’s waist and putting his hand in his back pocket.
Sherlock, to Gregs’ surprise (and unsurprise, at the same time), tilted his head back and blinked up at Greg with bleary, watery eyes. He snuffled through an equally red, sore-looking nose while he chewed on his dummy.It wasn’t helped by the fact that the way he was laying on Greg’s chest smushed his cheek up on one side, further blocking that nostril.
Well. They had to go through the kitchen to get to the fuse box, anyway. And by now, Mycroft Holmes was fairly certain (and by ‘fairly certain’, he meant one hundred percent sure) that he knew exactly what was going on. He stared into the pitch black kitchen, narrowing his eyes; “Gregory,” he hissed through clenched teeth. “This is
Harry may have been put off when his fun was spoiled, but he could never resist Daddy-cuddles! He toddled over on his knees and fell against Severus with a small ‘oof’ from the man. “You mi’sh me?” he asked, propping his chin on Severus’s sternum as he blinked up at him.
“No, no no no, sweetheart, don’t!” Sherlock lifted the collar of his shirt over his nose and quickly grabbed Jawns’ wrist before he could reach back and smear more mess all over himself. “Here, we’ll get you cleaned up and sit you in a nice bath, yes? Does that sound good?”
Hermione had him bundled in her lap while they waited for the tub to fill. “You say it like you don’t have two other toys waiting for you, you silly little bean!”
Mycroft put the powder back in the nappy bin and finally taped the front of Jawns’ nappy up. “You,” he said, giving it a small pat; “are usually quite the little chatterbox. Are you still trying to wake up, hm? Here, sit up for Mycroft...there we go!” The elder Holmes brother took Jawns’ hands, and helped him sit up before going to click off the bedroom lamp, as well as the baby monitor (and it’s small, blinking red light) sitting beside it.
Sherlock sat up and slowly turned to peer at Greg over his shoulder, his thumb in his mouth, and contemplated him for a moment.
“P’ease?!?” Sherlock was at his feet, batting his eyelashes again and tugging at his sleeve.. “P’eeeeeeaaaaase, G’eg???”
Thorin sat up and looked around to see if Bilbo had stopped the stream for a moment’s reflection, or was getting something to eat out of his pack, or if he was just begin his usual grumpy little self and  legging behind.
will. You and Sherlock are going up for a bath. Here,” he added, and gave Sherlock a nudge in Jawn’s direction; “Go ahead and go upstairs; I need a moment with our Greg.”
,’ Greg thought...before emitting a blood-curdling scream as a hand burst through in a shower of candy and grabbed his shirt, balling it into a fist.
to remember to tell Stephen about that. That was too damn cute. “Look, Tony’s daddy sent it for you!” Steve gushed as he set the brand-spanking-new Blue’s Clues training potty on the floor. “Come look at it!” he said, and pulled out his phone.
admit this out loud!…relieved that he would soon have the sagging mound of wet fabric ‘round his waist replaced with dry, fresher ones. Part of the reason he’d been lagging behind was that his thighs were starting to chafe terribly.
And that was how Sherlock and Greg found them; stretched out on the sofa, snuggled up under a cozy blanket with Jawn reclining against Mycroft’s chest, his dummy lazily fluttering in his mouth as his eyes danced back and forth across the screen.
“We’re gonna text Tony’s Daddy and see if he’ll do one of his portal things so we can borrows some diapers.”
Mycroft’s eyes went wide; “I didn’t tell him!” he said, holding up empty hand up to protest his innocence.
The combination of such impotent baby-rage dressed up in sweet curls and a wet nappy was too much, and Greg couldn’t stop the short, sharp laugh that barked out of him, which only made Sherlock more irate. “You y’augh a’d me?! You pun’ss me in’na fa’se an’ you y’augh abou’d i’d?!!” he shouted, throwing his hands up in exasperation.
The look on John’s face curled into an offended sneer while Mycrofts' fell into utter disappointment...and he couldn’t decide which reaction was worse. The scales did tip in John’s favor, though, with the “You WOT,” that followed. Mycroft put a hand on his other shoulder to calm him down; “Easy, darling,” he said, then turned back to Greg.
“Y-y’ah, ba’g on,” Jawn said, barely above a whisper. His grip on Mycroft’s arm hadn’t loosened in the slightest.
“I, I’m s-sorry, baby, I r-really am, it’s  jus-it’s just...!” Greg could hardly finish before dissolving into giggles that left him breathless. God, his belly was starting to hurt.
Jawn had crawled onto the couch next to Mycroft and was tucked at his side, munching away on something from his pile of treats with Mycroft’s arm around his waist. Sherlock was still on the floor, sprawled on his belly with his chin in his hands and watching the movie with wide-eyed glee. His little dress had ridden up over his backside, and even under his tights Greg could see that Myc had been right...that nappy was in desperate need of a change.
‘...Daddy!’ The tears dribbling down his cheeks turned to ones of relief as Jawn sat up on his knees and reached for him. “Da’!” he babbled excitedly, fingers grasping in the air.
“I know, I know,” Thor sympathised as he draped Steve’s blanket over his shuddering body and thumped his hand against his back, firmly but gently. “I too hate missing out on a good fight, but you know what? There’s always another!”
horse, and twirled her fingers in its glittery white mane while lazily sucking on her dummy. She didn’t even acknowledge when John spoke.
Oh, and here was Stee'b! And Mr. Salt and Mrs. Pepper, but they don’t even have babies yet! And Stee'b is trying to find out what Blue needs with bubbles and soap and–!
Harry scrunched his nose and shook his head. No, not that one…he’d heard that one waaaaay too many times over the past few days from Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. And Hermione. “Some’fin new, p’yea’sh?”
Sherlock slowly sat up, still looking a little shaky and crestfallen with his wet lashes and tear-stained cheeks, but…John had a plan. “So, we can’t wear the Elsa dress tonight, BUT-” he held a finger up as Sherlock’s bottom lip began to quiver; “-there
get into it. “You’re lucky I have to go get that,” he warned, pointing at Mycroft. “Curmudgeonly little snot.”
Grass it was, then. Steve scanned the scant few yards of grass before the parking lot began, his gaze skimming over the brown patches and the picnic tables drowning in knee-high weeds, and–
Mycroft sucked in a quick breath; “Ooo, don’t do that, darling...ouchy!” Mycroft took Jawns’ hand and kissed it, just as he had earlier. “We’ll wash your face and you’ll feel so, so, so, much better,” he said, adding another kiss with each ‘so’. “But first, we need to change that bum of yours.”
he didn’t want to. He didn’t have to go. He’d show Da’da he wasn’t right all the time! And he wasn’t fighting the urge to squeeze his legs together! Or wiggle! Or…!
The bedroom door opened unexpectedly, and Jawns’ cry was cut off as he blinked at the sudden flood of light hitting him directly in the face. He pulled his fingers out of his mouth to cover his eyes with his hand, and peeked out from between them at the tall, slender figure who was silhouetted in the doorway.
Jawn only shrugged again, and Mycroft couldn’t help but feel a bit disappointed...he happened to enjoy feeding the ducks as well, if anyone cared to know. So much for his winning streak.
“Y-yeah,” Greg repeated, wiping away the tears rolling down his cheeks.. His face was red, and he was wheezy from laughing, and maybe a little hoarse from trying to get the right amount of mucusy-maliciouness in his snarls. “L-look, baby,” he stammered, and held up the rubber werewolf mask. “It’s j-just, it’s j-just a m-mask!”
” Bilbo drew in a sharp breath as Thorin started to rub the oil into the sore places along the creases of his thighs, and the thighs themselves.
The Bucky-shaped lump laying in their bed didn’t move, so Steve turned on the light and entered the room. “Hey, it’s time to get up, baby,” he said, reaching down to gently brush the hair back from Bucky’s forehead (and to check for a fever, just in case…and thankfully, there wasn’t). “You been sleepin’ real good, huh?”
Even Thorin was enjoying himself as he sat by the fire and listened with earnest to everyone’s stories and throwing in some of his own that he knew he’d told at least a dozen times, but everyone still listened and reacted as if it were the first time hearing them, and Thorin appreciated it.
...this had gone over about as well as a root canal. “Didn’t think it was that bad,” he muttered--they’d been asking for a scare, in fact...quite literally! That’s the main reason Sherlock loved Halloween so much! ‘
“I–” There was only a moments pause, but that moment was enough for Bruce to finally to catch the frantic babblings of “D-da’, Da’da, Da’d-da, Da’da!” broken up with bouts of the most heartbreaking cries he’d ever heard.
“No! Noooo, Da’da! Mines!” Sherlock grasped John’s wrist and without a moment’s hesitation, pulled it back and directed it into his open mouth.
Steve folded the changing mat and packed it back in the diaper bag, along with the wipes and powder, and handed Bucky the plastic bag with his wet diaper. “Can you be a big helper and throw this away in that trash can right over there, see?” he asked, pointing to the one nearest to the car.
“Ah, well, maybe next time,” Stephen said as he set the empty syringe aside, making sure that Tony saw it, and stripped off his gloves. “All done, big boy. Now you get to choose a bandaid and a sucker.”
Jawn sat up and rubbed his eyes. It was dark. Much too dark for his liking. He didn’t even know where he was, it was so dark! He stretched his arm out and groped along the sheets blindly, until his fingers eventually bumped into smooth, cold plastic.
Well, that, as well as Jawns’ nappy...that had been changed. Twice. And Mycroft had been unable to wrangle the phone from him either time.
Thorin sighed. As much as Bilbo had likely earned exactly what he’d gotten, it was hard not to feel for the little one. He sat down next to the halfling, and patted his lap. “C’mere, tiny burglar.”
“Who’s getting buggered raw? Can I watch?” Molly said, smiling brightly as she finally joined them in the kitchen, smoothing down her skirt as she returned from the bathroom. God, champagne always made her have to wee more than anything else!
” Mrs. Weasley had taken painstaking measures to get the lovely baby blue and cream-striped jumper made, with it’s little bunny face on the front that would twitch it’s nose and whiskers when the wearer was extremely happy…and she was
“Good job, baby! C’mon, let’s get back in your booster seat and get this show on the road…next stop, Nuggies!”
Thor gave Steve a bounce in his arms; “Of course. A ‘playdate’, he said. Does the idea appeal to you?”
“Oh good, I haven’t missed any of the fun stuff, then?” John said, returning with the nappy bag in tow. “You gonna smack him? Y’know, how he did me last month, when I was minding my own business like the angel I am?”
Jawns’ face brightened in an instant, with a smile on match. He happily toddled off to the bathroom, tickled pink at the idea that he would get to dump the entire basket of toys straight into the tub and play to his heart’s content.
Hermione was suddenly pulled from her sentimental musings by one of Ron’s loud squawkings, and looked up just in time to see the little dragon sitting in Harry’s hand, blowing a stream of water directly into Ron’s face.
And since they did have a fair bit of sunshine left, they made the most of it; each of the men took a place along the bank and set about washing their things: shirts, socks (Mahal, there were
Harry covered his mouth and continued to jump…silly Daddy! Had he forgotten that that didn’t scare him anymore?!
He turned to where Sherlock could see him, but didn’t look up to meet his gaze. no, John stood there, and in full view of the baby, opened the box and took out the small, white paper pouch inside.
“We’re not going to be ale to get her off of it,” John said. “And we’ve got to get ready to go to your brother’s before we’re late and he sends in Greg and the whole Yard.”
was a hard bargain. Molly plopped down on her bum and pressed her forehead against the bars like a little convict; “Sha’-sha’,” she pleaded one more time, sounding sadder than ever and close to tears.
“Help yourself.” Mycroft sat back and laid his cheek on top of Jawns' head. “Go on, go get comfy. We’re not going anywhere.”
Thorin breezed right past him, and Bilbo stood there, bare-legged and in shock, before he gathered his wits and trotted after the dwarf. “Thorin, wait!” he hissed. “Give me my pants back!”
Tony’s chunky little baby thighs were right there, uncovered, and more firmly held in place than his biceps were.
“Gregory,” he snapped. He was getting angry now, and the fact that his little brother and Jawn--yes, even
A faint smile peeked out from the corner of the Cloak that Tony was chewing on, making his teary little eyes crinkle at the corners.
Jawn, the poor thing, had another handful clutched fretfully in tightened fist as he desperately tried to clean up the remains of what must have been a terribly upset tummy.
“Forgive me if the idea of a baby with a pencil right next to my very vulnerable eyeball makes me twitchy.”
…That, was the last straw on the already fragile camel’s back. Bucky’s vision went blurry as tears welled up in his eyes and dripped down his cheeks as he took a deep, shaky breath and opened his mouth to wail–
It only took a few short (but they felt very long, indeed) minutes until Jawn stopped crying, and only another minute more before Jawn sat up once again, cheeks ruddy and eyes looking ever so sore and scratchy.
Harry watched Severus go about preparing his bottle without any further protest…one, because he knew it would be a fruitless effort, and two, he was of the same mindset as his Daddy (without even realizing it) and a warm bottle while bundled in Severus’s lap sound like a dream come true. He couldn’t ask for anything more.
Greg looked back down at his hands while he took a moment to think to himself; it felt…easy? Too easy? Don’t get him wrong, a telling off from Mycroft could be blistering and leave one in tears all on it’s own because the man knew exactly what buttons to push, but a nap sounded downright pleasant, and that didn’t feel…enough?
Severus smiled; “Now, how could I say ‘no’ to a please that pretty?” he said fondly, and kissed Harry’s forehead. “One story,” he reiterated and, with bottle in hand and babe in arms, carried them into the sitting room and settled them all nicely into the big, cozy armchair by the fireplace.
Dicks room was up the stairs and at the other end of the manor, but Bruce still came to a stop right outside the door just as he heard Alfred count to “…Seven…”, followed by a softer, tearful “…S-se'ben…”
…They still had no idea where he’d holed up in all that time. Not even a spanking for running from Greg and scaring all of them for hours had loosened those stubborn lips.
” he exclaimed again, only louder, and more genuine; now that was no fair! He’d been looking forward to taking the boys to the park for some sunshine and fresh air...not to mention that they weren’t the only ones going a little stir crazy. “C’mon, Myc...what if I just take the spanking instead?!”
“ ‘bout time! Yes, Greg loves his cheeky little muffin bunches and bunches!” Greg pressed the tapes snugly into place, and patted Sherlocks’ thigh, signaling that they were done. “Especially a muffin who lets me go to the park.”
“Spoilsport,” Ron snorted. He then picked up the modestly-sized basket of bath toys, both magical and non, and held it up for Harry to see. “One more, little man…player’s choice!”
“I said NO,” Greg snapped…it was harsher than he meant it to be, but he was ready to move on to something else. “Pick another game, muffin, or Greg’s not playing anymore.”
He heard the harsh scrape of a chair on the floor as Sherlock got up and hurried over to him. “What, what’s happened?! Are you okay?!” he asked as he took John’s chin in his hand and raised his face to look him over.
as a nice game of dress-up, until Sherlock had decide that Mycrofts’ make-up stash should also be part of the game, and had begged and pleaded, and then begged, and then pleaded some more until he’d worn Greg down and gotten a ‘yes’…albeit a reluctant one.
“Maybe I’ll just use all your fancy soaps, then,” Greg huffed, sounding more put out than he actually was.
. And, he was sure that there were still marks all over the back of his thighs. There really was no good way to explain off a handprint the size of your entire arsecheek.
“I see that the Weasley’s have sent you back packed full of sugar, as always ” Severus drawled, watching Harry in the corner of his eye as he unpacked his little one's bags from his weekend trip.
Harry grinned a sneaky grin at him over his shoulder as he stood next to Molly, and waggled his bum.
“It is.” Sherlock slipped the soft, stretchy onesie over Jawn’s head. “Because for the next two days, you’re only going to be Daddy’s small, teeny-tiny baby.”
One bloke had called him because he had a broken, possibly (probably) infected tooth and was in so much pain he could hardly speak, but his dentist (or any dentist) said it was a non-emergency and the man was fucking desperate to find anyone, dentist or not, to just cut the fucking thing out and be done with it.
Mycroft had relaxed once he realised that Molly was physically fine, if just a bit frightened, and watched as his little brother carried her back into the house, fussing and petting over her in a way that was eerily similar to how their father had done with him that time he’d burned his foot.
The smell hit him first, making him draw back and taking his breath in a short gasp. Heavy, Pungent.
Mycroft feigned surprise; “No?” he asked, an eyebrow going up in shock. “You don’t think so? A lesser sentence, then…yes, yes, I suppose you’re right; it was an accident, after all. Such a magnanimous little thing you are!”
” she cried, covering her ears with her hands when the next firework started it’s shrill whistle before taking off.
Alfred was perched at the head of Dick’s bed with the man cuddled up at his side, and even from across the room Bruce could see the half smile on his face when he entered the room. “Eight…” he said, petting Dick’s hair lovingly.
Sherlock wilted against John as he had a good cry…he’d only wanted to wear his Elsa dress because it was pretty, and Mycroft’s party was going to be fancy, and he had nothing fancier than his Queen Elsa dress! And he wanted everyone to see it! And it was perfect, because it was blue, and snowflakes were supposed to be blue, a’cause Frozen, and Elsa could make snow, and–!
Mycroft sighed, and--using that thing he and his brother do that Greg still isn’t entirely convinced isn’t actual mindreading--met Greg’s gaze. “What did you do,” he asked.
,’ Greg thought. He didn’t think Mycroft was done...oh no, he would be a fool, with the jingly-belled hat and everything, if he thought it was over. No, this was a ‘to-be-continued’ argument, and those are the ones that he hates the most. He rubbed his face with his hands, held them there for a moment, and then sighed before walking into the sitting room and turning on the light.
So many people calling in because the hospitals stay full, worried and scared and tired and stretched to their limits, because they were having chest pains or back pains or throat pains, belly pains, or they had a fever and they were terrified because they’d been
” Jawn wailed, and Sherlock once again caught his wrist before he could cover his face with his dirty hands.
Harry snuggled in deeper–this was his favorite way to lie, tucked in close enough to feel the rumbling of Severus’s voice against his cheek when he spoke, letting it roll over him in a warm, baritone wave.
Mycroft rubbed a soothing hand up and down Greg’s back. "You took that very well, darling,” he said. “I’m proud of you."
He was robe-clad and settled in his big, overstuffed, squishy armchair, with its faded seat and threadbare edges (one of the few things he’d brought along when he’d moved in, much to Mycroft’s dismay...although Greg had caught the lanky bastard napping in it almost as much as he did, the disingenuous tit), with Sherlock tucked all nice and cozy at his side in nothing but his nappy and one of their many, many,
Mycroft looked up. Ah...it was the scene where the main antagonists’ friend-turned-vampire was smashing up a room full of relics. “Are you sure you don’t want to--”
“Hel’b, Ar’fur! Hel’b!” Harry cried as he grasped at Arthur's trouser leg, much to the man's cackling delight.
That left Mycroft. He held his glass up, regarding the last mouthful sitting in the bottom; “…Drunken babies,” he sighed, and set the glass down, unfinished, before trailing after everyone else.
Mycroft took the opportunity to catch Gregs’ attention over the mass of dark curls in his face, and winked.
That was all the invitation that Sherlock needed, as the next thing John knew, the little detective was scrabbling off the couch (and nearly tumbling head over heels in the process, but before John could leap of his chair to catch him, he’d already righted himself) and crawling into John’s lap. "Killin’ bir’s i'sh ba'h,” he said matter-of-factly, and squirmed around until he was situated in the perfect position…tucked in the crook of his Daddy’s arm.
There was the sound of snuffling behind a conveniently-sized Hobbit-shaped stump and, as Thorin rounded it, he found the source of the snuffling; “Bilbo.”
“Pretty sure Daddy’s busy, love.” If the look on Mycroft’s face as he ascended the stairs was anything to go by, at least.
Natasha only wrinkled her nose at it. “I DON’ WAN’ THA’D!” she whinged, almost as screaming level. “YOUR’S I’SH BE’DDER!”
“Sherlock. Sweetheart. Muffin. You have to understand how upsetting it is to have a pencil point slowly approaching your eyeball.”
to it,” Bruce repeated. He held the small baby thermometer in Tony’s ear until it beeped, then read the results on the little screen…99.8. Low grade, as he’d expected. “It means his immune system’s working hard and doing what it should, that’s all.”
Thor barked out a single laugh. “Ah, you were too young to remember the Feast of the Einherjar! Barely walking you were, but that didn’t stop you from toddling right through the middle of the hall and straight for Mother’s lap-!”
You know what, no. He loved the potty, and he’d been comfortable enough to not only sit on it (which Steve had been fully expecting a fight for), but
“Uhhh...why not just go in?” Greg ventured, and was shushed again as Sherlock frowned and tried to press his ear even closer...almost into the wood, if he could manage. “I can’t hear anything,” he said eventually.
Sherlock, who’d long ago hidden his face in the fold of Jawns’ striped shirt, now peered out with one glassy-looking eye; “G-g’eg?” he asked, trembling.
Alfred quietly stood and, without a word, handed Bruce the lukewarm bedtime bottle he’d been trying to get Dick to take before his meltdown.
Harry gave him a sweet smile before becoming overwhelmed by the warm, fluttery tummy butterflies he got whenever Severus called him ‘fawn’, and bashfully buried his face in the crook of his Daddy’s neck.
Mycroft used the paddle to point to a spot on the floor in front of him, and Greg timidly shuffled over, his face already burning hot with shame and anticipation.
There were also days when Steve would question whether or not that he was enough for Bucky…if he was what Bucky needed to heal.
Bucky peeked around Steve and wrinkled his nose at the interior of the men’s restroom. The whole place smelled like stale pee, mildew, vomit, and alarmingly, the coppery smell of old blood. And a lot of the questionable puddles and streaks and smears on the wall likely took part in that.
Bilbo looked up at Thorin from where he was crouched on the ground, rubbing his nappied backside with both hands…even through the encroaching darkness, Thorin could see his ruddy, tear-stained cheeks. “Go’way!” he snapped, reaching down to gather his pants from around his ankles.
It wasn’t ideal, but it was better than nothing. Better than trying to inoculate a squirrelly infant, at least. Just gotta distract him for about three seconds.
Sherlock, with tears still streaking down his cheeks and a bottom lip that poked out further than his brother’s nose when they were having a row, reached for John. “D-da’y-yee,” he stammered in that soft, sweet voice of his that only happens when he’s deep in headspace.
Loki sighed, and then reached into the open make-up kit sitting next to her and began to dig around. “Wait, here…!” she said, fishing out an older (but clean) brush that had never been her favorite, even when it was new. She handed it to Tony; “Have that one, Bambi.”
“You need a bath, little boy.” Steve lifted his soggy little one onto his hip, ignoring the unpleasant squishing sound; “And then you know what we’re gonna do?”
Bucky was right. Everything was g'woss. Leave it to Steve to pick the one rest stop that , from the looks of it, hadn’t been maintained since the early 90′s.
And yet another win! when he opened the refrigerator to find several pre-made bottles awaiting him. Six seemed a bit excessive for someone leaving their ‘infant’ for an hour and a half (two hours TOPS, he’d said), but oh well...who was he to complain?
there was a chance he could clean up before Steve came and found him, but the moment he went to move his foot, the carpet squished and all he felt was pee squirting up between his toes.
“Right-o, I’ll take care of it,” Greg said, and added a quick kiss to Mycroft’s cheek. “We’ll trade off when you come back, Morticia.”
with playing videogames all night,” Thor muttered. Of course, he’d known what they were doing, trying to give the Little One a sense of pride and purpose to ease the sense of being left behind…but still, they didn’t have to aim so far below the belt.
Greg turned back, newly-warmed baby bottle in hand. “You’re lucky that you’re cute,” he said, giving the bottle a good shake to make sure to disperse any hot spots. “You still want this, Mister Moo-croft?”
Sherlock chuckled. “Froggies or duckies tonight, little love,” he asked again, holding up two pairs of pajamas for Jawn to pick from.
Sherlock continued to watch her, dumbstruck, as she unlatched the panel and slithered her way out, making sure to close it behind her, and crawled out from under the crib with…
His face crumbled as the first tears rolled down his cheeks and a thin, watery cry squeezed past that awful lump in his throat; “Daaaaa’...!”
“M’ no’d scared,” Sherlock whispered back...just as the sound of a chair scraping the floor came from the kitchen, making him gasp.
But when he reached the doorway, Mycroft stopped and looked over his shoulder; “Oh, and bring their sippy cups up with you when you’re done,” he said, and then left.
Mycroft gave Greg the Supreme Ultimate Form of his ‘I-Told-You-So’ Look, and then gently tugged on Jawn’s ear. “What do you say, darling?”
“Aw…aw, Bucky, baby, what’s wrong?!” Steve scooped him right back up and held him to his chest, nevermind the state of his clothes. “What happened, big boy??“
He knew what those quiet nights meant, when there was nothing to do and no one to talk to except your own thoughts. He’d had plenty of those himself.
The third (and he *knew* this one would be bad, Mycroft always made the last swat the worst!) and final swat had him crying out and jumping up again, and this time Mycroft allowed it. Greg immediately reached back and rubbed his arse furiously, trying in vain to ease the terrible burn.
Stephen Strange hated this time of year. No, it wasn’t because of the holidays; he wasn’t a Scrooge, for Christ'sakes. But that didn’t stop all the little ones at the compound from looking at him like a monster.
"Miss Sadie I saw this giant unicorn and thought Molly would love a unicorn like this from Sherlock and Uncle John! "
Sherlock narrowed his eyes and peered at him for a beat longer...then popped his thumb out of his mouth, whirled back around, and began to whisper in his brothers’ ear.
Sherlock frowned. That’s not what he’d been expecting. “Jawn, monkey, what’s the matter–?” he began as he stepped through the doorway…
Sherlock flinched as the first rocket went whistling into the air and went off with a loud bang, sending showers of colorful sparks flying above their heads.
“I said no, I don’t need to,” Sherlock intoned again, his voice slightly muffled from the pillow that he had his face buried in.
It started out pretty smooth. Bucky’d had a good morning, and had let Steve get him through their morning routine of waking up, getting his diaper changed, then getting dressed and making breakfast…hell, Bucky had been in a good enough mood that he wanted to help with the cooking. And Steve, being the soft touch that he is (when it comes to babies, always), let him whip up the scrambled eggs. It had gone really well, actually.
After some more gentle urging, Mycroft had Jawn clinging to one side and Sherlock on the other, hugging his arm just as tightly as Jawn had...tight enough that the elder brother could feel his heartbeat pulsing through his fingertips. They slowly shuffled their way to the bottom of the staircase, where Mycroft could only just make out the fuzzy outline of the banister in the dark. “Gregory?!” he shouted up the stairs. When there was no immediate answer, he tried again; “GREGORY, are you alright?!?!”
Sherlock chuckled; “You should have thought of that when you bought it,” he said warmly. Between that, and the expression on his face as he watched Molly with her newest (and best, apparently) present, John figured that he wasn’t all that worried about the logistics.
“Little man,” Greg sighed, and kissed the baby’s forehead; “Fightin’ it like always. Have a snooze already...and stop chewing those, you know Mycroft will have you bum for that,” he added, and playfully thumped Sherlock’s nose, as he and Mycroft always did when they caught the little bean chewing on his dummies. It was a new habit and, being such a destructive one, they were keen to nip it in the bud, so to speak.
