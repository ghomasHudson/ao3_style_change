School became unbearable for the alpha without Cas being there. He kept looking for the messy hair, the blue eyes, the adorable laugh echoing through the halls, but instead he was greeted with everything but. Nothing was said to him about the claiming in the locker room, not that Dean would be in much trouble about it, maybe a fine at the worse. If Dean wanted, he could have had Chuck arrested for kidnapping his own son. Dean was now Castiel’s alpha. That thought alone made Dean smile, until he remembered that Cas didn't want him as his alpha and had disappeared to stay safe from Dean. Dean left school three weeks after the claiming. He was a month from graduating.
“Mkay,” Dean grunted, “now leave me ‘lone,” Cas smiled but stood and moved toward the door, “Cas,” he stopped at the door and looked back in the bed to see Dean roll over and face him, “C’mere,” Cas couldn’t disobey Dean if he wanted to, so he moved back to the bed and looked down at him, “closer,” Cas bent down beside the bed. “Thank you,” Dean said softly, before leaning toward Cas and kissing him on the cheek, “Now go to school.”
“I live here now,” Gabe said before pausing, “well not here in the graveyard that would be creepy, but in town, with him. We had been thinking about it for a while. When he saw her that day and you calling for him but not chasing after him. That showed him something, he never really could explain to me what that was, but it all changed for him. He had seen her before on the videos but he said that in real life she was so much more. He cried for the next week watching that video. He does need you, both of you, he just can’t face it yet.”
He covered Cas and made sure he was warm before he walked over the door and quietly opened it. He glanced back at the sleeping form lying alone on the bed, wiping a single tear that fell down his check. "I'm sorry" he whispers into the darkness of the room. "I am so sorry" he said closing the door soundlessly behind him.
“He’s in heat,” Dean said running a hand through his hair, “and there’s a fucking pack of alphas down the block. I know they smelled him. Fuck, when are you gonna be home? I can smell him through the door and it's just started.”
Cas sat in english, at the front of the class, not looking at anywhere in particular, when he heard a laugh, Dean’s deeps chuckle, he looked at the door just in time to see Dean and Gordon walk in. Gordon started laughing and pointed at Cas. Cas could just hear him say, “Told you he’s always watching you. He wants you, man.” Cas looked at Dean, and for the first time in at least a week and a half the two brothers made eye contact.
“Is that best for Cassie or for you?” The alpha questioned him again.
Dean unbuttons his pants and slid the down and tosses them on the floor. He got up and walked over to get a small plastic bottle out of the pocket his leather jacket. He stands at the foot of the bed looking at the angel, his angel, spread out before him.
“Yea,” Gabe said, “ about five years after the omega died, the alpha got sick and died a slow horrible death. Their children thought it was karma. While they were going through his things, they found a book. In it was the story of the night the stillborn child was born. It told a different story of that night. The child was born and a test was done to determine if it was alpha, beta or omega. He was an omega. The alpha paid someone to take the baby to the omegas family, he was taken in by the omega’s older brother. The baby was taken to New York where he lived until he was 16.”
Dean and Cas walked up the door in silence, “Thank you for spending time with Emmy today and for being there with her. She needed you today,” Dean finally said after a few minutes of standing at the door.
Dean pulled up to the hospital, parked the impala and walked into the hospital. He made his way up to the desk in the ER room, “I’m looking for Emily Lynn Winchester, she was brought in by ambulance from Clayton Elementary School. She had hurt her wrist. I’m her father.” Dean felt like he was rambling but he needed to see her. He needed to know that she was ok.
They rode to the best pizza place in town, well Emmy swears it's the best. It’s just a small little joint with an all you can eat buffet and a small arcade. They ate and played then ate dessert. Cas and Emmy tagging up against Dean in just about everything and Dean letting them win, most of the time. Cas is extremely good at skee ball. there was no letting Cas win there, he honestly beat the socks off of Dean.  Emmy walked away with about 5000 tickets between the two of them and ended up getting a giant fluffy unicorn. She even got the waiter to sign her cast. They left after a few hours.
“Ok,” Cas said stepping away from the crib and walking back to the living room. He sat back on the couch with Dean. “Whats up?”
“Hello Sam,” Cas said in a small, meek, little voice. He knew that Sam didn't like him, maybe that's why he was hiding. Sam had always been nice before but when he and Dean were speaking before Cas could just tell that the Alpha held a lot of resentment for him. He could understand why to, if Dean had been sick because Cas had asked him to release him, to break their bond. It was Cas’s fault that Sam had almost lost his brother. Cas could understand that, but Cas needed to do what he had done.
“Yeah, not to long ago.”
“Yeah,” Dean sighed.
“Just let me finish this episode then you can have the remote and watch what you want.”
Hey everyone! sorry it been so long. i'm also sorry for any mistakes in this I tried reading over it a few time but i have an insane headache and i really just wanted to get this posted. let me know what yall think. thank everyone for all the support on this. the comments and kudos make my day. love yall!!!!!
Standing on his front porch Cas watched for the black 67 Impala, that his boyfriend kept in perfect condition. His mother stepped out of the house as it came flying down the road throwing up dust. "Baby, just don’t go. I know you think you love him but, Cas, don’t leave like this."
“Please what, baby?” Cas asked in a completely under control, teasing voice.
Dean slowly made his way to the door, damn, he was tired. The snow and cold always made him sleepy. He passed Sam, sitting in the living room watching cartoons, Batman. Dean smiled and walked to the door.
Dean looked over at Cas, who was still looking at him, “You okay?” he seemed to be lost in thought or something.
“Bye, Cas,” Dean was smiling, a dopey, first true smile in entirely too long smile, as he watched Cas climb into Anna car.
“What’s the point in telling me that?” Dean asked.
“Sure,” Dean said, looking up at Cas. It had been a long time since they had gotten along this well and he was enjoying it. He had almost forgotten how easy it was with Cas, how good it felt.
“Wow,” Dean said looking at Cas, “that's amazing.”
He knew what he had to do, not because he wanted to but because he had to. He eased his arm out from under Cas's head, placed a kiss on his prefect forehead and got off the bed. He grabbed his clothes off the floor and slipped them back on.
With Cas’ teeth still buried in Dean’s neck and the gentle pull of blood, from the wound, leaking  down Cas’ throat and the hot puddle of come between them, Dean felt his knot catch on Cas’ rim locking him inside the omega, as he spilled his seed.
Cas was talking mainly to Dean’s hair but Dean still heard him, “I’m not saying we should jump into bed together,” Dean said lightly, lifting his head and looking at Cas, “but I’ve slept better here than I have in days.”
Cas might not be his omega, but Dean knows that Cas will be his one and only omega. No one else will ever bare his mark other than this beautiful man laying in on the bed holding their daughter. Dean never thought he see Cas holding Emmy like this. He had hoped and prayed but never thought it would happen. Dean loved them both so very much. He only hoped that Cas could one day love him back. Dean was so lost in thought that he barely realized the doctor coming in.
Cas handed Dean his phone, “So that white coat covers up alot, huh?” Dean laughed as he handed the phone back “I don't think I will ever be able to watch this show the same way again.”
Hey guys! first, sorry its been so long. Second, 108 comments, 299 kudos, and 47 bookmarks. Y'all are fabulous. The amount of support on this story is just mind blowing and more than I ever expected. Y'all are great and I love each and every one of y'all. Every comment and kudo means the world to me. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH!!!
It was a short ride to school; Cas pulled in and parked, grabbed his bag out the front seat beside him and left the car locking it before walking away. He had done his best to avoid people since ‘Drea left and he moved away from his dad. It occurred to him that his so called friends were all kids of people who worked for his father, none were his actual friends. He pulled away from them and tried to make new friends.
Inside the office, Barnes took her seat at the desk and pointed to a chair on the opposite of the desk. Castiel sat down and look at the principle. “I’m sorry,” Cas started, “his mouth, talking about Dean like he did. I lost it.”
His eyes dropped down to scar on his neck. It was a bright pink, almost like it was a brand new scar, not something that he has had for years.  He lifted his hand to the scar and ran a finger over the raised surface.
“I don’t that song, why not something I know?” Dean grumbled.
“I don’t expect anything from you but I wanted a place for her here and for you.”
“No sir,” Cas began, “I’m sorry, Crowley surprised me and bashed my head against the sink before I could do much…”
“Sit, eat,” Dean said. Cas stood there looking between the plate and Dean. He was sweating a little more and every fiber in his being wanted to sit down and eat just like his alpha said. He fault with himself for a moment before he sat down and picked up a sandwich.
Cas was looking at him sorta like a deer staring into headlights. Dean wasn’t even sure what he was doing as he started leaning toward Cas. He moved slowly, his mind in a fog. He wasn’t sure if he wanted Cas to stop him of not. But Cas didn’stop him, he just looked at Dean.
Mary sighed, “Because I know you. I knew that you would get pissed and when Cas just left I couldn't let you hurt Dean too. I knew you would treat him different. You were always so sure he was gonna be alpha. He should be,” she paused, “but submitting isn’t in alpha biology. I didn’t want to upset you until he presented. We would deal with it then, when it became an issue.”
“Even when you saw me puking my guts out in the bathroom, you still said nothing. You looked at me and walked away, like I never meant anything to you, like you didn’t care. That is why I’m mad not because of Grace, in all this Grace is the one thing that I gotta say in. I make the decisions that affect her, only me.”
“There’s more to the story isn’t there?” Dean asked thinking about the cruel alpha. He couldn’t be like that man, not to Cas, not to anyone.
Cas paused the movie and turned to Dean, “I’m hungry. What do you want to order?”
“Hey Momma,” Sam said as he walked into the kitchen behind her.
Bobby began pressing around Dean’s stomach, the lower on Dean’s abdomen he pressed the more Dean winced until he cried out in pain. Bobby pulled his hands away and covered him back up, “You still feeling sick?”
They climbed out of the car and stretched out their limbs, “Dean, you wanna grab the coolers out the back and Sammy go open up the door let it air out some before we march in there”
I'm glad you have been my friend
Cas let the song end and everyone around Dean clapped. More than a few of his fellow classmates had tears running down their faces. “I need some air,” Dean said, moving away from Ash, grabbing another free beer and walking outside.
John was pissed. That little bastard. Rationally he knew that Dean was at fault too but Castiel laid his claim on Dean, knocked him up and dropped him all in one fucking day. John was seriously considering killing him. He could get away with it. He was a cop. He knew how to cover his tracks. John hadn’t realised that he had balled his fists so tight that his nails were digging into his palms and blood was dripping on the table.
“I got it, Dad,” Dean said walking by with the cooler, sitting it down on the porch. He open the door and looked back out at the impala. He wouldn’t mind staying out here, he thought to himself, away from everything, just him and Gracie. He could see fixing it up and sitting on the front porch in rocking chair with Gracie, looking out into the trees, just listening to sounds around him.
A movie projector had been set up in the gym and Becky had spent what seemed to be months arranging the pictures that she had collected of everyone to the songs that were playing.
"Well then come to bed." Dean said patting the bed beside him.
“I said go,” not all alpha’s had to growl and raise their voice to let their alpha seep in the voice.
Cas watched as Dean took his first bite, he could always tell if Dean liked food by the first bite and the pancakes were no different. Dean almost moaned around the bite, smiling as he finished chewing.
Cas didn't say anything for a moment just sat beside Dean, “I should probably go, Anna will be looking for me soon.” Dean looked at Cas to question why Anna was here, and Cas seemed to be able to read that thought, “She’s my plus one today.”
She opened her eyes and looked up at Dean. She was beautiful, absolutely beautiful. She had Cas’s bright blue eyes and bit of hair she did have was dark. She looked just like Cas. “Hey Gracey,” he said softly looking down into those sweet blue eyes. “I’m gonna love you forever,” he kissed her sweetly on her forehead and just held the baby close.
“Alright, well, I got some pills down stairs that’ll help with that, I’ll bring it up in a few minutes. Try to go back to sleep.”
“Knot me, Alpha,” Dean moaned as he began to feel the Cas’s knot catch against his rim, “I want you to fill me full, stretch me, baby.” That was all Cas needed to hear, still pumping on Dean’s cock, Cas could tell he was close, so close.
Cas slipped both hands under Dean's shirt and raised it over his head. Dean followed Cas's action with his own shirt. Cas placed his hand on the back of Dean's neck and pulled him in for another passionate kiss, their hands exploring each other's body.
Cas watched the sky in awe as three meteors shot through the sky, “thank you,” Cas smiled, looking over at Dean, “it’s beautiful.”
Dean had been rough on some of the people in his class. He thought about a few of them often and hoped that this man wasn't one of the people he and Benny shoved in lockers when they wandered the halls.
Cas was moaning under Dean, needing more than Dean was giving but knowing better than to ask for it. Dean had worked down to his hips. He was nervous and scared, maybe even a little terrified. He needed this to go right. He had sorta just gotten Cas back, he couldn't lose him again.
“The picture, who’s the guy?”
“You know, Cassie,” Bart spoke loud enough for the entire lunchroom, “If your little brother, Dean, over there wont take of you, I can. I can take real good care of you, baby boy.” Bart lifted his hand to Cas’ cheek and patted it gently.
He moved slightly to get off the bed and felt the proof that Dean had been there with a slight ache in his backside. He ignored it and pulled himself up looking for any sign that Dean would be coming back. There was nothing.
“Yes, Alpha,” stilling his hips automatically. Dean’s mouth followed the path of his hands, pausing briefly for a moment over each nipple before moving farther down his body.
Again Dean asked, “What do you mean what do I want to do?”
I'm so sorry for the long break guys. I forgot how time consuming school was. But I am on break right now so I'm gonna try to get some chapters cranked out over the next few weeks. I will not  stop writing this story, so for those of you who are on the journey with me please don't give up this. We will get there, I promise. thank you all for reading this and telling me what you think. s always comment and kudos make my day.
“Thanks Cas, I’ll be up there as soon as I can, hopefully not to long after y’all get there.
“Bout a day and a half.” Benny said, following Dean’s line of sight. “It was scary, but you both are okay,” he drawled out affection leaking out with his words.
"Mama, I  gotta go, he's waiting in the car," Cas said opening the passenger side door and sliding in by the man he loved. He looked to his left to see a picture of perfection sitting beside him. "Hey Dean," he said to his green eyed boyfriend.
“Sorry, I was just walking the halls and heard you through the door.” Dean had made it almost to the side of the stage where the piano sat. “That was beautiful,” He added, taking a deep breath and making quick work of the few steps to get on the stage.
“Gabes out of town. I was thinking I’d just walk, it's not to far from here,” Cas said looking at the door. He’d love to be in baby again but maybe being alone with Dean wasn't a good thing. He didn't trust himself that much. He wants to be with Dean, to stay right here, safe, wrapped in Dean’s scent. He had missed Dean so much and never knew how much he could love one little girl but he does love Emmy. Dean has done such a great job with her.
“Fuck you, Crowley,” Dean snapped.
“Well you go get ready for bed call me if you need help ok baby,” Dean said sending Emmy to her room to change into night clothes. After she went to her room he turned to Cas, “You don’t have to stay,” he looked down at his feet, almost like a shy teenager.
“Hey Cas?” Dean whispered.
what happenes next
“Pizza’s good,” Dean said pulling Gracie’s diaper bag out to check the amount of formula he had left for her. The can was half full so that would last for while they were over here. Dean sighed watching as Cas order a few pizzas for them. Dean knew that he and Cas had to talk, that they had to figure out something with Grace. She needed Cas just as much as she needed Dean and he knew that he couldn’t continue to keep them apart.
“I have some toys in her room. I can go get her some.” Dean smiled up at Cas as he got up from the couch. Cas walked into Gracies room and pulled out a few toys that he had bought thinking that Grace would like them. He grabbed a stuffed elephant and a few toys that light up and make sounds.
They had a baby. A baby that he was itching to see.He walked out of the room and threw a set of double door and passed through the waiting room. It was almost empty, actually is was except for a short guy with shaggy brown hair. He was laying on the couch with a magazine over his face.
Cas once again found himself running his hands along baby. She was still just as beautiful as she was in highschool. Dean took such great care of her and Emmy and his house and yard. He put effort and care into everything around him. Cas could easily see it. He climbed into the passenger seat and waited for Dean.
Dean chuckled, “Jo still scare that boy?” he asked looking up at Ellen.
Everything stopped around Cas, he was now secured inside a unpresented male, who was asking to be claimed, to bear the new alpha’s mark. Cas ran his teeth over the skin again. This time Dean shuddered, placing a hand on the back of Cas’s head, keeping him in place. Cas sank his teeth deep into Dean’s shoulder low enough that it would be covered by a shirt.
Cas smiled at the beautiful baby, who started reaching for him and whining.
“Wow,” it was beautiful, hardwood cabinets and counters, dark countertops and wood backsplash behind the sinks, red plaid curtains hung in front a window looking out onto a dark, deserted street. The applinences were nice and shiny. This kitchen was nicer than his, and he was the rich one.
Sammy threw the pillow at his brother’s head and sat back down to his pizza, still smiling at his brother. They finished dinner, with light conversation. It was Dean’s turn to clean the kitchen, but Sam took pity on him, cleaning the kitchen and letting Dean return to his bed, to wallow probably.
They had made it halfway through the pie when Dean couldn’t stand Cas’ quiet moans. He wondered if he could make Cas make those noises. When that thought flashed through his brain, Dean pushed the pie off his lap and moved to the edge of Cas’ bed, both feet touching the floor. He laid his head in his hands, “Fuck,” he said lowly as Cas continued to moan around bites of pie.
“Oh, um, no I’ll go down with y’all. I didn’t mean to fall asleep up here,” Cas got up and stretched.
Kate was the farthest thing from John’s mind right now, “Why didn’t you tell me about the claim, Mary?”
Cas began to sway his hips as Dean claimed his throat, gently biting and kissing anywhere his mouth landed. It was Cas’ turn to moan as Dean moved his affections down Cas clavicle and chest before flicking his tongue over one of Cas’ nipples. Cas’ hips stuttered slightly, as Dean closed his lips over the bud and sucked gently.
“Bout the baby.” Bobby clarified.
The drive to the hospital was long to say the very least. It was a day’s drive stopping twice for food, and a break from driving once. He arrived at the hospital around five am the next morning. He was tired and scared. Well scared maybe wasn’t the right word. He was a horrible mix between nervous and terrified. He stomach was doing flips and hadn’t even seen Cas yet.
“It is, which is great. Emmy loves it when Grandma is able to be around us. I was scared that today would be a bad day and she’d be too sick to get out of bed. Well if you’re here that means Sammy should be here soon. I better get this party started.” He place a hand on Lisa’s knee and gently squeezed, before getting up and walking over to the grill.
“Dean has more of the alpha attitude and he would have probably present as an alpha if not for Cas. When he submitted like he did, to another alpha and the claim was made, Dean knocked his body out of whack. He probably felt it when it happened, something just changed. What was actually happening was his body released a ton of hormones and everything else that is released when an omega goes into heat but it was only for a short period of time. He was extremely fertile when they were together,” Bobby paused drinking down half his beer, “God this is awkward.”
“I know,” John told him patting his shoulder before walking to the living and pulling on his boots, getting ready to leave.
“Now, Sam,” John said.
“Language,” She interrupters
Cas maneuvered to get under the blankets, it was May, but there was a slight chill in the air, he guessed that’s why Dean had brought out the blankets. The last time they did it they just had sheets. “What’s that?” Cas asked, holding the blanket open for Dean to join him.
Hey folks! so so sorry for the very very short chapter and the long wait. please forgive me!!!
Cas scooped up his daughter, “I love you too, sweetie.”
Dean and Sam left. Mary continued her tasks in the kitchen. Cas looked around the living room and decided to straighten up some. He folded his blanket and placed it, along with his pillow on the floor beside the end of the couch. He picked up the few glasses that he, Sam and Dean had left on the coffee table. He walked into the kitchen and slipped them into the dishwasher.
Cas stood up out of the fridge and walked over to the table where Dean had just flopped down in a chair. He pulled out the chair across from Dean and sat down too.
It was difficult for two grown men and a five year old to squeeze onto a twin size bed but they managed long enough for Emmy to fall back asleep listening to Dean read Alice in Wonderland, but if truth be told Cas might have fallen asleep before Emmy did.
“Thank you,” Cas said before turning to walk away, “ma’am,” he turned back to the desk, “could you tell me who has to have surgery?”
Cas was standing outside the lunchroom leaned back against the red bricks. On the outside he looked like he did everyday, but inside he was dying slowly and painfully. Maggie, a pretty omega freshman, had plastered herself by his side today. He wasn’t sure why the omegas in school still wanted anything to do with him. He has a horrible rep since he presented. He used them to get what he needed and he’s only felt bad about it once. That was with Sammy, the sad look on those light green eyes as he left the bathroom stall, Dean being there didn’t help any. He’ll never forget that look, either of those looks.
When the soup was done she took a small bowl up to Dean and once again Dean could not keep the food down. She left him lying in Sam’s bed completely covered from head to toe in Sam’s blue blanket. Once downstairs she pulled out her phone and decided to call John.
Cas listened as Dean talked to him. “You’ll always be it for me.” Cas shivered at Dean’s words. He wanted to say something, anything, but he couldn’t figure out what. So much was running through his mind. He wanted to make Dean happy and to make him suffer at the same time.
Of course Cas knew the smell, it was the same sickly sweet smell that followed every other girl in their grade. Cas said nothing to Dean. They never spoke to each other, not since that morning.
From the best of days
They used to yell
Sam nodded, “You know where the emergency stash is, use what you need. I shouldn’t be gone too long.” Dean ruffled Sam’s hair, causing the boy to grumble, and stood up.
Dean added, “And no fun.”
He had married Lisa, just like everyone thought he would and they had son, or well she had son. He had just recently found out that the boy he had raise since the day he was born wasn't his biological son. Lisa had taken Ben and moved to her mother's. They were in the middle of a divorce.
Cas's mother sat on the front porch waiting for her husband to get home. She saw the dust being kicked up again and thought back to earlier today when she watched her son drive off. Her husband car pulled in and parked. "You ok, honey?" he asked as he got to the steps and saw his wife sitting in a rocker.
“Mr. Di’Angalo,” Cas look over to the voice, to see Ms. Barnes looking at the scene around him, “please let go of Mr. Wisdom and follow me, both of you,” She didn’t look back at them, just started walking back to her office.
“Miss Mosley,” Lisa said getting the nurse’s attention, “can I talk to you in the hallway, please?” The nurse nodded and followed the teacher out in the hallway, “I wanted to tell you he isn’t some random guy, he is her omega father. She just doesn’t know yet.”
“I’d always protect you,” Dean sighed, “I seem to have failed you a lot, though haven't I?”
“Are you sure you don’t mind coming today?” Dean asked shyly.
Sam moved over to the lazy boy chair, leaving only the couch open for Dean.
“Yeah, go talk to the teacher and I’ll call the school. Thank you.”
Getting dressed for school every morning had become sorta a game of chance on whether he would be matching when he walked out of his closet. There wasn’t a light in the closest, and he couldn’t turn on the bedroom light, so he got dressed in the dark, pulling a shirt of the hanger and grabbing a pair of jeans from a cubby. He got dressed then pulled a pair of shoes off the floor and walk out the closet and the room.
But She'll just keep reaching on
There was a dusty, moldy couch facing an open fireplace, a built in bookshelf was on the inside wall and a large window was on the other looking out he could see the impala, in all her gloriousness, and behind the car stretched on miles of woods.
In the time of our lives
John smiled, almost laughing at his son, “Sammy boy, why don’t you go get Dean a pillow off the couch. Lord knows we can’t have him whimpering around here forever.” Dean almost rolled his eyes at his dad but kept himself in check, besides he was too sad, hurt, maybe a tad bit afraid, just everything, to be getting into with the old man for disrespect.
“I got tired of retelling old stories because no one really wants to know what I’ve been doing for the past ten years,” Dean told him, sitting down on the edge of the stage, feet hanging off the edge, looking out at the empty seats,  “I really didn’t mean to interrupt you; I was just walking around and heard you. I was just gonna sneak back out once you were finished.”
Dean wanted to punch Cas in the face, “If you don’t put something in me right now, I swear to god, I’m going to flip you over and fuck you, Alpha,” There Dean was submitting again.
"Alone in the silence she wakes up too soon
Cas nodded his head shoved tightly under Dean’s chin.
The room was quiet for a few minutes after Emmy left, it was sorta an awkward quiet after how close Dean was to Cas earlier, but it was Cas that broke the silence first, “Thank you for letting me be here,” Cas started, “I know that you didn’t have to let me stay after you got here, or let me hold her, so thank you.” Cas smiled slightly and Dean.
Dean embraced the hug and let his face drift into the crook of Cas’s neck, “Are you feeling ok Cas? You scent it's off, it's different than it was this morning.”
Dean laid in bed staring up at the dark ceiling. Cas is pregnant, well was pregnant. He… fuck this is… Shit… He pulled himself out of bed and started packing a bag.
“I can’t leave you, Cas,” He almost sounded concerned, “it’s dangerous.”
“Yes ma’am,” all three said, roughly around the same time. Mary handed over Gracie and gave the boys a hug.
“Sam bitched at me the entire time you and Jo were together. Kept telling me that I was acting like someone stole my puppy.” Dean huffed out a small laugh.
“That day,” Dean felt Cas tense for just a moment, “I can't say I regret it, now that I know what came from it, but I am beyond sorry for it. When I realised that you were an omega, everytime my alpha had chanted mine when you were around me started echoing in my head. I snapped and the alpha took over. I know it not an excuse and I know that I will never be able to change it or make it any better.”
Michael stormed out the room mumbling as he left.
Dean's eyes flicked over to him only momentarily, only to see to Cas flirting with ‘Drea. Cas liked her and all, not enough to mate her but enough to convince his father, and her’s for that matter that, he was serious about this. He didn’t like her father anymore than his own and he was sure that she didn't either, but neither was in a place to do much about it, so they dealt. Cas had his devices, most of which consisted of drugs and ‘Drea worked at the dinner as much as Ellen would let her.
Dean looked down at Grace, already asleep in his arms and smiled, her and Cas must of had fun this morning, “I’m gonna go lay her down, then I’ll get it.”
Naomi left about thirty minutes after the movie began, calling bye to both boys who merely waved back at her. “Order something for supper and do not burn down my house,”
Cas snorted as Dean took another deep breath, “You’re dangerous,” Cas said opening the stall door and looking into the eyes of his friend. The green was now a thin circle, his pupils completely blown. “You became dangerous the moment you smelt it. The moment you smelt me. There is a reason no one knew what I am. Why everyone thought I was an alpha,” he was almost screaming now. His voice was hard and steely. He was mad, mad at Dean for not leaving, mad at his suppressants for failing, and for the first time he was mad at his body for being an omega. His voice was shaking when he added, “Bad things happen to male omegas here.”
Cas pressed the snooze button on his phone, before pushing back his blanket and getting out of bed. He quietly got a new pair of boxers out of the top drawer of his dresser. He looked up at the sleeping figure on the top bunk, sighed, and walked out the bedroom door.
He walked down the hall and  pushed open doors as he went the bathroom door first, then a small bedroom,only housing a twin bed and a small dresser. The next door led to a larger bedroom. He pushed open the door and stood in the doorway for a moment looking around the room. He had spent a few nights in here with Mary, in the queen bed that took up a good portion of the room. The bed was pushed against the wall in the corner and against the opposite wall was a long dresser.
“Where the water meets the land
Cas grabbed a wooden spoon of napkin on the counter and stirred the pot. There was one more pan on the stove, a large pan of fresh green beans sauteed with mushrooms, baby potatoes and onions. Everything smelt so amazing. Cas put the spoon back on the napkin and stepped back as Mary pulled open the oven and stuck the pie in.
“It was good, family came down. How about yours? Did you decide to join our family, yet?” She said gesturing to the classes behind her.
It was also Sam’s weekend to go to their mom’s. Dean didn’t go anymore. It used to be the best part of the month, then Dean got older, and he realised that main reason he liked going over was for the pie. Then she started dating a guy named Michael and Dean just really didn’t like going over there with him there so he stopped going.
“Bobby,” Benny hollered for the older man. “Something's wrong with Dean,” he said as the beta bust thru the door. Benny threw back the covers to reveal the blood.
“Awesome,” Dean said grabbing the pie and sitting back on the porch, leaning against the house.
“Course,” Dean said, he hopped on the trampoline and moved up beside Cas. “do you remember the last time we camped out here?”
Dean handed his daughter to his mother and took her place between the two alphas. “You heard her guys. Come on, Cas, I’ll walk you out.” Cas followed Dean out of his room, down the stairs and out the front door. Dean stopped them on the porch, “Listen Cas,” he began, “first, you don’t get to on all alpha on someone over me. You lost that right. Second, and take this to heart, don’t fuck with Benny. He will rip your throat out. He is bigger, older, tougher and better than you. I’ve seen him tear apart an alpha with his bare hands. If he thinks me or Gracie are in danger, he will hurt you. And last, if  want to see you I will, if not then leave us alone.”
“Dean Winchester, I got a call yesterday that he was here and y’all needed me, so here I am.”
Dean tried to wake up more but he was so tired, just so tired. Sam was still standing close to Dean, he could smell the aroma of the pizza and wanted to eat it so badly. He forced himself to unravel from the blankets and sit up, still half asleep and groggy but the pizza smelled good. So he took the pizza off the plate and started eating it. It was so good, great even, for about four bites. The nausea feeling hit again and before he could put the pizza back on the plate, it had tripled. He tried to get out from under the covers and off the bed, he really did, but trying to move so fast made it all worse and he leaned off the bed enough, so that he managed to throw up on the floor and Sam a little.
John smiled up at Dean, “It's not your fault. None of it is. It would have happened if I had been driving too.” John handed Gracie to Mary and pulled Dean into a hug.
“He needs an alpha, Castiel preferably, but well can't help that. He trust you. Can you come back or talk to him, at least, maybe that’ll be help, but I really think he needs you. You're the only alpha he knows and trust right now.”
“Kay,” Cas said muffled through pizza. Cas found the Hangover on and turned the tv to it. They both ate about half their pizzas before Dean disappeared into the laundry room for a few moments.
She let go of Cas and ran over to Sam, “Bye-bye Uncle Sammie.” Sam picked her up and she kissed his cheek.
Cas grasped Dean face again and lifted it up to face him. He brushed the tears of Dean’s freckled cheeks. He hadn’t thought about all the problems that presenting caused. “This isn’t over,” he said kissing the tip of Dean’s nose, “I will not lose you yet. You are mine.” Cas smiled and dove for Dean’s lips knocking him flat on his bed. “Let me have you. I want to have you as my first, as an alpha,” he whispered raspily into Dean’s ear, nibbling on it, causing the boy below him moan. “Please,” he flicked his tongue over the shell of Dean’s ear. “Let me top this time.”
Dean usually tried not to think about it, but it was amazing how far he had fallen since high school, or maybe he hadn't fallen, maybe he had shed everything that wasn't important and grown up.
John looked down at his plate, “It's only been a week, what have I missed?”
“He claimed him?” John gritted out through clenched teeth. He knew letting those boys be together would end badly but he didn't think it would be like this.
“It's a debit card there is a five thousand dollar limit on it each month. That should be enough to find you a place to live, if you want, and get you and the baby, or Dean, anything y'all need, but please stay in school. You're so close to graduating.”
Benny agreed right away, he had heard Dean talk about the dinner’s burgers and pie entirely to long. He walked in, carrying an empty infant carrier, behind Dean, who held Grace snuggly in his arms. The place smelled amazing, like any good eating place should, greasy and meaty. There was something under all of that though, something light and floral. He cracked his neck and breathed deeply, taking it all in.
Cas started, “Truth or dare?”
Cas was Dean’s step brother. They were six months apart, Cas being older. Dean’s dad married Cas’s mom when they were seven. They were super close when they were younger, but then something happened. They grew apart. Now the only thing they share is a room and every once in a blue moon a joint, but that wasn’t very often.
“Hey Cher,” Dean smiled as the older alpha enter the room, “do you need any help with her, I was about to go to bed when I heard her. I can watch her while you and Castiel talk.” Benny stepped into the room and up to Dean. He looked down and the baby in his friend's arms. She was still whimpering and reaching for Dean’s face. Benny tickled her toes to get her attention and she smiled, looking at him.
She smiled at Cas, the first real smile that she had given Cas in almost a year, “Thanks, Cas.” The group left the dinner, as Cas walked up to the counter to talk to Ellen about Mary’s check.
Mary sighed on the other end the phone, “ I’m stuck at work. Can you take him home, Fergus? I know its alot to ask but John is still out of town for another few days. I would usually ask Cas but well I'm sure everyone knows by now that ain't gonna happen. Please”
“Well,” Dean sighed, shifting Gracie in his arms, as the walked into the house, “So the couch sleeps well. Mom won't say anything for now. I’ll bring you some blankets after I lay Gracie down.”
Cas was kinda taken back by how thin the man holding the baby was. He couldn't see much of the baby, other than a blue blanket.
Cas sat up, looked over at Dean, and he let his eyes fall to the mark on his neck. It was already almost healed, just faint teeth marks left.
Cas didn’t say anything for a moment just sat there and embraced Dean willing being so close to him.  “Who’s that?” Dean asked.
Cas had gotten better without the bond. It hurt everyday without Dean, being pregnant and alone was the worst hell he’d ever been through, that day included. It was only a little easier for him after the baby and bond were gone, but the love for Dean that Cas felt didn't fade and the want that the omega yearned for from the alpha never went away. Cas has been in therapy for four years, at first he refused to talked about it. He did everything he was meant to make sure that Dean’s baby was healthy, because no matter how hard he tried he couldn’t think of this child as his baby also, but she could be Dean’s. He would carry Dean’s baby and make sure she was perfect for him and when the time came give her to him.
Cas watched as ‘Drea went to get their orders, the guys didn’t notice Dean and Sam and as always thought he was watching her walk away. He wouldn’t deny it was a nice view, but today his focus drifted past the amazing ass in tight jeans to the person he didn’t think he’d see again. His beautiful Dean.
That never die
“Wait… What baby? Are you sure we are talking about the right person. I haven’t seen Cas in months.” Dean had to be hearing this wrong, something was wrong with all of this. He hadn’t seen Cas since before graduation, since March. wait… April, May… he counted out the month's, fuck the locker room.
Cas couldn’t remember the last time he had slept so well. He woke up slowly wrapped tightly in someone’s arms, Dean’s arms, he remembered after a moment. He remembered what happened, disobeying his alpha. No matter how he tried to put it, Dean was his alpha. The claim never went away, even after Dean had released him. He still felt it, a constant pull to be with Dean. Nothing ever made it better. Nothing other than being with Dean and Emmy made it better, they made everything better.
“I won’t hurt you,” Dean started trying to steady his voice, “why didn’t you tell me?” Cas could see the battle raging inside of Dean. “How did you hide it so well	. There has never even been omega scent around you.” Dean chuckled, “Guess Jo makes sense now. She’s usually too much for an alpha.” Dean was smiling now. A predatory grin.
“Love you too, Mom,” Dean said back.
“Fuck you, Dean,” Cas growled back at Dean, “Just leave me alone.” He just wanted Dean to go, to leave him alone. It’s times like this when he really hates alphas.
He flopped on to his bed and pulled a pillow up to his chest. He cried into until his body was shaking and sleep finally claimed him once again. The last thing he thought of was never seeing Dean's emerald green eyes again.
“There isn’t much here but we could order pizza or you could let me take you out. Wherever you want to go.”
Cas dropped his hand as soon as he noticed Dean was staring at him, “Sorry,” he mumbled dropping his hand from his neck and into his lap.
Emmy begged for Cas to come back home with them and, God how did Cas want to, but he had made a deal with Gabe to cook tonight, so instead he invited them for supper. Emmy agreed before Dean could even blink.
Dean lifted his head and looked at Cas, how could he offer not to see them anymore, Dean could understand his reasoning but Dean knew that choosing that option would be long and painful for all three of them. “We can’t do that,” Dean said a small smile dancing on his lips, “the other two ideas are a good place to start.”
“No, sir,” Sam grumbled, dropping his book with a small thud on the floorboard and climbed out the car. Really all he wanted to do was to climb back in the seat and pick up his book. He was really enjoying it, more than he would fishing with Dean and the old man, but he would do his best. So he stretched out and walked over to where Dean was standing on the porch looking out at the woods.
Dean pulled the flask out of his back pocket and took a good swallow when she called out Benny’s name. Becky continued in a more somber tone, as she started talking about the remembrance, “We have our very own, Castiel Roche, singing one of his hits as we pay tribute to those that couldn't be here.”
So so sorry about the wait on this. I wasn't sure how this chapter was gonna happen until about a week ago. I've looked it, deleted and retyped what i didn't like and I'm still not completely sure I'm happy with this but I can't make y'all wait any longer. so as all ways tell me what you think I love your feed back and think about what all of yall say when writing new chapters so please let me know.
“OK baby hold on,” he pulled out his keys, popped one threw the tape and ran it down the length of the tape, then handed back to Emmy for her to finish opening.
“Ordered the pizza,” Sam said, almost bouncing in his shoes. He was unusually happy right now. “Should be here in a few minutes.”
He answered after three rings, “Hello love,” he said greeting his wife.
“Do you know how much your son just cost me? Castiel was set to marry into one of the best families in the country, until your so called boy showed up with a baby.” Michael threw a disgusted look at Dean.
Dean knocked an elbow into Benny bringing him back to here and now. Benny smiled and followed Dean over to the booth where Mary and Sam was already sitting on one side, leaving the other side open for Dean, Benny and Gracie. Dean slid in first, cradling Gracie above the table, leaving room for Benny on the outside.
“Do you know what it means?” he asked softly; his nose buried in the crock of  Dean's neck.
“She won't be tested,” Dean snapped.
Mary had set the food on the table while they were getting John and Grace seated. Everything looked great. He kinda wished that Cas was here with them. There seemed like a part of his family was missing.
Cas brought the pizza into the living room and sat the boxes on the table, “I’m gonna go get a coke, you want one?”
Dean grabbed his plate of the table and walked into the kitchen. He dumped what was left on his plate in the trash and put his plate in the dishwasher. He opened a cabinet and pulled out a clean plate and filled it with some of the chicken, green beans and mac and cheese. He wrapped it tinfoil and sat it on the counter.
The piano finished out softly and Dean felt unreasonably sad. He had no right to be sad because of a song he shouldn’t have heard in the first place was over. He sniffed quietly, before standing up.
“Yes, we do,” was Dean’s response, “he doesn’t dictate where I go.” Dean and Sam walked over to a booth and both slid in on opposite sides of each other.
He smiled as a hand started running through his hair. “Good morning, beautiful.”
“You were family,” John spat him, punching the young alpha in the stomach. “He loves you and you are killing him. He’s dying and it’s all your fault. You no good waste of space.”
Cas reacted by punching him square on the jaw. Bart’s face snapped to the side. “Don’t fucking touch me,” Cas growled and walked proudly out of the lunch room. Cas went home after that. Thank god it was Friday.
“‘Member that old, brown, two story on Main?” Dean asked, stretched out on the passenger's seat, his head laid back against the seat.
Cas smiled up at Dean, “I’ll always want you Dean,” Cas grabbed Dean by the front of the t-shirt that he had on and pulled him down closer to him.  The kiss was different than they had been before. The previous kisses had been rushed and needy, not this one. This one was slow and sweet, something special that neither one has had before.
One last ding and Cas stepped out from the elevator. This hall looked just like the rest, blindingly white and the smell of chemicals surrounded him and messed with his nose. He steadied himself and walked across the hall to the room lined with tall glass windows. Mary was sitting in a blue soft looking chair. Her long blond curls pulled back into a messy bun, she was wearing a big baggy grey t-shirt and black yoga pants. Her eyes were red and she had tear tracks still on her face. This was not the Mary that Cas was used to seeing. She was always so well put together but not today.
Tessa left the room quietly after dropping off Emmy and return about twenty minutes later with discharge papers and a prescription for her pain medication. After the paperwork was finished Tessa and Cas wheeled Emmy out of the ER, while Dean pulled the impala into the pick up drop off area. Tessa was gone before Dean got back with the car but he couldn’t help the smile that spread across his face as he looked up at them waiting for him.
Dean rolled them over to their side's and held Cas as close as possible. He wasn't sure what was gonna happen when Cas woke back up but the stinging in his neck might cause a few problems.
Dean was almost caught off guard as a soft pair of lips landed on his cheek. “Hey Sweetie,” a sweet voice said, softly, almost whispering.
Andrea brought out their food, smiling at Benny whenever he would look at her. Dean smiled and flirted with her while she was standing there, earning some nasty glares from Benny. Dean would snigger and keep talking. They all ate, Dean and Benny moaning as they ate their burgers.
Sam walked in while Dean was pouring himself a glass of tea. “Hey Sammy,” he called over his shoulder, “when’s Mom coming to get you today.
“Your welcome,” Cas hugged Dean back. It had been so long since he hand someone in his arms that weren't family, well Anna or his older brother, Gabe, were the only family that he had left. The others disowned him when he came out. “High school was a long time ago, we have both grown past that person we were then. It seemed like we both faced some demons tonight, and no one should go through that alone.”
“Yeah,” Dean yawned.
Tonight I'm no bronze I'm no silver
Dean thought up a lie and he thought it up quick, “Yeah, Dad,” he began slowly giving himself more time, “I, um, well I slipped on the ice in the driveway this morning, fell flat on my butt, think I might have bruised it. Hurts like hell.”
“No, I’ll be ok. Thanks though.” Dean said leaning back into his soft pillows and kicking off his shoes before pulling up his blanket and snuggled into it.
Dean walked up to the nurse’s desk on the first floor, “Can I get some help?” he mumbled.
Crowley wasn’t sure if Dean would be in school today or not, but he prayed, well if he prayed he would have, that Dean stayed out of school today. He had plans for today and sweet Dean would just get in the way. He was standing at his locker just a few away from Dean’s and down the hall from Castiel. That little bastard, but it’s ok, he’ll get what he deserves. How dare he treat Dean like that.
“There's a meteor shower tonight,” Dean pointed out, as lights started shooting across the sky, “it's part of the Lyrid meteor shower. Halley’s Comet passed by causing the showers, there were some before and after the comet.”
I'm glad you have been my friend
Dean broke away first, with a sweet dopey smile on his face, “I love you Cas,” he moved his mouth down Cas’s sharp jawline and down his neck, stopping to nibble on Cas’s clavicle.
Hey everyone again. I know, I know... so soon but yes, so soon. As I was writing this I was thinking i'm gonna hold on to this, post it next week but I'm weak and wanted to give y'all this. A very special thanks goes out to otaku916, rechin0_0, Gewels, and angels_dvd64. Thank y'all for the comments. This chapter is for y'all. Well its for all of you but mainly those four, 'cause they awesome.
“And what happens in mine,” John said from the bed, “is none of yours.”
The heat was fading and Cas knew it was almost over. Dean would be going home in a little while. Cas didn't want to let him go again. Dean had been a comfort over a very short time period. Cas no longer saw flashbacks of that day when he sat with Dean. The scent of his alpha no longer made him want to barf.
“Alright, I’ll talk to him. Hand him the phone.” Bobby did just that and passed the phone to Dean. Benny talked to, told him that he was gonna come back, that he would be there in just a hour or so and then he just talked. He talked and tried to sooth the whimpering omega. Soon the contractions eased. They stopped completely when the alpha arrived at Bobby's and climbed into bed behind the omega.
Michael turned to Cas and smiled. Cas wouldn’t deny that he flinched a little at that sight.  MIchael huffed a little and started talking again. “We had plans to run away after we graduated, but your grandfather found out before we could and I was sent to a boarding school in Europe.”
“Castiel? Yeah, your friend that left right before y’all graduated. What about him?” Sam asked thinking it was way too early for his brothers shit.
Cas held on to what little control Dean hadn’t taken back yet and decided to keep his mouth to busy to focus much on anything else. He leaned down over Dean and kissed him with everything he had, continuing to rock his hips, keeping Dean secure in him.
It was pitch black when Dean pulled into a roadside motel for the night. Cas followed Dean into room 13. It was a small dingy motel room. Dean lead Cas in and Cas sat down in a small chair.
Bobby hooked Dean up to an IV and gave him medicine to calm the contractions and hopefully stop them. Dean was still just seconds away from a full on panic attack. Bobby had to do something to calm the omega down so he called Benny.
Dean chuckled, “yeah, mom’s a stickler about how sweet tea should be made.” Dean smiled over at Cas, “Thanks, I’d love some.”
Dean just knew that everything this man sang in this song he meant wholeheartedly. There wasn't a lot of people that Dean picked on relentlessly and he couldn't think that any of them could sound like this man.
“I know,” Dean smiled, “it’ll have to stay here in this room, but I promise I won't turn my back on you again.”
They used to yell
He looked up as dark messy hair filled his vision, “I’m sorry to hear about Benny, I didn’t know.”
I'm glad you have been my friend
“No, I’m not,” Dean saig giggling.
Dean watched as Cas got out, walked around the car, opened his door and helped him out, “I’m not completely helpless,” Dean grumbled but still accepted the outstretched hand. He walked up the door, “You’re coming in to wait on her, right?”
Mary and John had been upset when Dean told them that he wanted to go back to Sioux Falls with Bobby. Sam had cried and screamed at him when he was told about everything, the baby and Dean moving. Dean asked his family to say nothing about the baby or where he was going, to anyone but mainly Cas. They agreed and the next day he was packed waiting for Bobby to say when he was going back home.
“What are you doing here, Michael?” John asked.
Cas watched as Dean walked back into the waiting room and shifted the baby from the alpha into his arms, calming her before walking back out to where Cas still stood. Dean looked down at the baby’s face as he came to stop in front of Cas, seeing the baby up was nothing like looking at her through the glass. Her hat slid down as Dean shifted her and showed off a patch of dark brown baby soft hair. She looked at Cas again with these big bright blue and he felt something in him snap.
So Happy New Years Eve guys!! 2016 is coming and 2015 was a pretty good year for me. I'm thankful for all that's happen to me this year and for all of yall.  I may have started this started this story for me but it's being finished for y'all every comment and kudo is motivation. The ending is close. There is a big time jump from the last chapter. 5 years. I hope yall enjoy this chapter, please let me know what y'all think. I think there's only going to be a chapter or two left. As the rest of the story this chapter is un-betaed, please let me know if there are any mistakes that are to bad.
“I’m going to school tomorrow,” Dean said, looking at his mom, “I’m gonna tell Cas. We can be together now. No one can stop us. His dad will have to be ok with us ‘cause of the baby. Michael’s all about family, well his family. This baby is Cas’s so she’s a Di’Angalo. She solves the problem.”
“We’ll do it together,” Dean said softly before standing to lift Gracie up off the floor. He gave her a kiss on her forehead and handed her to Cas. Together they walked her room and layed her down in the crib.
“I love you little one,” Cas kissed her forehead and continued to hum. Cas drifted off to sleep holding her on his chest.
Cas rolled over and wrapped his arms around Dean's waist and pushed his head underneath his chin.
Castiel knew that he had no right to care about the boy anymore but he wanted so bad to walk over to the house and go to his Dean. the omegas at school were nothing. He only wanted Dean, only his Dean, but he knew he couldn’t, not anymore. Never again. It was times like this that Cas hated his family. His fucking family and all the shit that came along with being a Di’Angalo. He hated all of this. He was so wrapped up in his thoughts that he didn’t notice John move from his porch until the alpha was standing a few feet infront of him, baring his teeth, eyes glowing red and anger rolling off the man.
“It sure is.” He said.
“This is where the chapter ends
Dean knew that there was something wrong with Cas and yeah, maybe Dean wasn’t so good with words but he did know how much Cas loved Mary's apple pie. It had been a while since he had shared any with Cas, so he knew that Cas would enjoy it.
Dean gasped as Cas’s knot expanded in his ass. God it was bliss, being so full. Dean clenched his ass tight around Cas, milking him. He wrapped his arms around Cas, “Do it” he whispered, “I submit to you, my Alpha.”
Cas was on the porch following Dean as he jogged, following and recording him. Dean, completely unaware of the camera following him, only stumbled a few times as he made his way back to the front of the house. He jogged up the steps finishing the song, looking straight in Cas’ brilliantly blue eyes, “Baby you're a firework, come on and let your colors burst, make ‘em go oh oh oh as you shoot across the sky-y-y,” Dean ended up saying the last bit instead of singing it but Cas didn’t say anything.
Cas slid into his seat and began forking pancakes onto Deans plate, “Tell me when.”
In the time of our lives”
Cas pulled his hand back and began playing with the knee of his jeans. They sat in silence for a moment, “Are you going back to the party?” Cas asked still messing with his knee.
Gracie snuggled into Cas as he walked over to Dean’s bed and sat down on it holding her close. He had been here for a week, and this is the first time he’s been alone with his daughter, their daughter.
“You turned your back on me when I needed you the most. I went through hell because you claimed me and then rejected me. I gave you everything and you almost killed me, literally. I can’t do this right now.”
“That’s fine, you coming Cas?” Dean asked Cas.
Tonight I'm no bronze I'm no silver
“You know school starts today, in about 45 minutes actually, you are going dear. I know this has been about Cas and we have given you all break to deal with it in your own way but now it's time to pull yourself together and move on,” she said as she walked over to the bed and sat down beside him.
Dean looked around for a moment before remembering that he had sat it down on the half wall. He got up and walked over to it, picking up the remote and walking back to the couch. He sat down and pressed play.
Cas yawned and made himself get out of bed, he had school today and it was time for him to get up and get ready. It didn't take him long, it never does, but he wanted to check on Gracie and Dean. He knew that Dean had been up with her at least twice during the night, but refused Cas’ help, telling him to go back to be so that he would be rested for class, Cas didn't like it but he listened.
Cas was lost in his phone, still searching for apartments when Dean flopped down beside him.
If Cas had been paying less attention to her then he was, he might have missed the small question Emmy just asked, “Anything,” he said looking at his beautiful little girl studing the movie case.
Dean dropped his arms and stepped back, “But, I was your demon”
Dean chuckled from the bed watching Cas cross the room to the door. He was almost certain that Cas hadn't realised that he wasn't wearing any clothes.
Dean thought about it for a moment, before asking, “Is it true?”
He took one last picture, bending down and getting both Cas and Gracie’s face in it. The light lite up their faces perfectly. He locked his phone, suck it in his back pocket, before gently laying a hand on Cas’ shoulder. “Hey,” whispered. It wasn’t a loud whisper, but it still was enough to stir Cas.
Thing were okay between them right now. They didn't hang out much, but Cas had started getting dressed with the light on again, and they stopped avoiding each other like the plague.
They rode in silence before Crowley spoke, “She’s a 1969 Shelby GT 350e.” He knew Dean appreciated the older muscle cars and she was one of his favorites so he drove her to school every day in hopes of getting Dean to see him.
“What's up, love?” Dean asked setting the movie in the front of the cart.
But if it has to end
That boy was a walkway Joe.
They talked about nothing for a few minutes until their waitress, the same Cas had been flirting with minutes ago, came over to them, “Hey guys, what can I get you?”
“That's what Michael doesn’t understand, he may have came to my father with this arrangement but I choose it, and I can break it, if I wish,” she said rearranging into a sitting position. She patted the seat beside, and Cas moved from his seat in front of her to beside her. “I choose you because you were different from the rest of your family. You’re sweet and loving, but I could also tell that you belonged to someone else and that worked for me because,” she stopped and looked down at her hands that lay folded in her lap.
Hey guys sorry it took so long but here is the next chapter. All mistakes are my own, let me know if any are to bad love you guys.
We have had the time of our lives
“My name’s Andrea and I’ll be your server today. What can I getcha to drink?” Andrea asked the group but never taking her eyes off Benny. Mary said a sweet tea. Sam and Dean both said coke and Benny, well Benny said nothing, just kept looking at her. He had both hands gripping the bench so tight you could see the white in each knuckle. Andrea chuckled at the alpha’s lack of response and asked him again what she could get for him to drink, still not getting an answer.
Now the page is turned
“They said about ten minutes,” Mosley said.
Dean hated seeing the smug ass look on Cas’s face like that, “Did she smell kinda sweet to you, kinda like melon?” Dean asked Sam looking at the waitress trying to brush off Cas’s grabby hands.
“Thanks,” Lisa said to Sarah as she began to led the way to the nurse’s office.
Cas turned back to Uriel, moving faster than he ever has before, his hand around Uriel’s throat, nails digging into the flesh, “Touch him, and so help me God, I will rip your fucking throat out.” He kept a grip on Uriel's throat, pushing up, so that the tip of the boy’s shoes just were touching the ground, and looked around at the small group of alphas that belong to his father crew,  “That goes for all of you, even look in Dean’s direction and I will rip you apart.”
Cas laid silently, still tucked tight up next to Dean.
“These are good,” Dean said quickly before piling in more food.
Sorry about the wait y'all. It's short and I'm not thrilled with it but I wanted to give y'all something . I hope yall enjoy it at least a little. Let me know what you think. love you guys! All mistakes are my own if there is anything major please point it out.
I'm horrible, I know. I will not give up on this story and I hope that y'all don't give up on me. I'm thinking maybe six more chapters to wrap up things, settle out things, make everyone happyish hopefully. Read. Enjoy. Let me know what you think, maybe what you would like to see happen.
Everything seemed to freeze. Nobody seemed to know what to say. Emmy had asked before but Dean had always dodge the question. However, this time her omega was sitting on the other side of her. How does someone answer that question.
The movement was slow and Cas wasn't sure if he closed the small distance or if it was Dean, but the moment their lips touched it was all that mattered and Cas never wanted to move. The small friction as their lips brushed against the others. Cas never thought he would forget the feeling from the first time they kissed but he guessed that the memory had deemed because this was so much more intense. Intense and loving and sloppy and ending to soon as he slowly moved away.
“We have had the time of our lives
"Idjit," Bobby said. Cas chuckled a little at the gruffness behind the word. "Well I got a call from my nephew telling me that he'd been arrested for knocking over a Texaco. So I get to go deal with that dumb ass."
Mary handed him a plate of food, bacon and scrambled eggs, but he shook his head walking into the living room and plopping down on the couch. A few minutes later Mary called them, “Come on boys let's go.” Dean and Sam followed Mary out to the car and Dean let Sam climb up front by Mary.
“Guess he's got a point there but you don't have to be in a rush to leave.” Dean looked down at his knees.
“Humm, oh yes,” he stumbled around with his words, reaching out to take the bottle, “it’s beautiful in here.”
She smiled and cooed as she looked at Cas.
So I know that his chapter is super short but I wanted to give y'all a little something for Thanksgiving. Hope y'all had a safe and fun holiday. Happy Thanksgiving folks.
Most of the brief conversation was muffled but Cas heard his name. “I want to see Castiel,” the voice said louder.
We have had the time of our lives
“That's not being still, Omega,” Dean said, trying not to smile at Cas.
Cas looked at him with an odd expression and a small tilt of his head.
“They’re bullies, Dean, that's what they do.” Cas took a bite of the pie, and Dean watched Cas’ face as he took that first bite. Cas moaned as the soft apples exploded in his mouth. Dean quickly looked away and down at the pie, taking his first bite. Damn, it was good.
Cas watched as Dean walked into the class. He looked happy today, maybe he had found a way to be happy without Cas. Cas knew, however, that he would never be happy without Dean. Dean was everything to him. He just wanted to run away from this whole town, everyone but Dean. He would take Dean with him. They could disappear together, away from everyone.
“I know what happened, what you did. I confronted Gabe when you got real bad, about why Cas wouldn't come back to you if he knew that you were dying and Gabe told me. Went full on Alpha, threw me up against a wall, had his hand wrapped around my throat and told me that he was the last person I need to complain to about the health of a brother and then he told me. All of it. Everything he knew from you and Cas. I didn't speak to you for like a month then you ended up in the hospital and what happened with Cas was horrible what you did was unspeakable but I couldn't stand by and watch you die. So I tried to help, and I never said anything about knowing.”
All of these years
“No, he’s fine here,” Dean wasn’t really eating anymore just pushing the green beans around his plate, “but you can’t expect it to be like it was. He may still be family but it’s different now.”
You thought I was coal
“Fine,” Ion said before walking away from the father and son.
“So you do remember me?” Cas said, “Why isn't the great Winchester out mingling amongst his people?”
The faces left behind
"Fuc,k Cas," Dean growls almost animalistic. "So fucking perfect," Dean felt himself building faster than he wanted but he was determined to make this amazing for Cas so he wraps his hand around his member and begins pumping it quickly, making Cas moan from sheer pleasure.
Cas was still laying on his bed, still facing the wall, but at least his shoulder were still. Dean thought momentarily that Cas was asleep, But as he closed the door Cas rolled over and looked at him. Dean almost dropped the pie dish. Cas’ eyes were red and his face was splotchy. Something had really upset him and Dean didn’t like it.
Dean moaned as Cas’ kisses stole his breath. He knew that this should not be happening but he couldn't find it in himself to stop the omega. Cas was so wet and impossibly tight around him.
Cas tensed under Dean’s hands but didn't push him away, couldn't push him away, “She fell because I was there. I wanted to see her and I distracted her and she fell. Lisa said that I could come in and see her and I want to see her. I want to know her. I’m so sorry Dean.”
“Stop apologizing,” Cas said lightly. He placed his hand on top of Dean’s that was still laying on his cheek.
“Let me help you in,” Dean moved from his laid back position and looked at Cas. He couldn’t understand how Cas could be so nice. Dean wondered if Cas was this nice in high school and how different things could have been had he not been an ass. “I’ll call Anna to come get me after your settled in.”
“John’s is April 22, 19...” Cas stopped for a moment to think Mary was always real big on birthdays but the year always gave him some problem, “54 or 5,  I think,” he added, “ but Dean’s is January 24-”
They passed the bottle back and forth until the bottle is half empty. Then Dean suggest truth or dare. That's when things got interesting. Cas suggest that they take a swig when they start each truth or dare and after the finish it.
But if it has to end
Michael never spoke about Naomi, but then again Michael also never said anything about his omega son. A little bit of rage burned in Cas’ veins every time he thought about that. He had an older brother that he would have never known of if John hadn't have said something.
“We had talked about finding the people we were so mean to in high school. We were kids that didn’t realise that what we said and did could affect someone for years down the road. He picked on you because I thought you were cute and I bullied you to show him that he was all I wanted.” Cas hadn't said anything, he just sat still leaned against the wall watching Dean as he talked. Dean pulled out his flask and finished it, “I am so sorry, Cas,” Dean was crying again, he hated talking about Benny.
He sat down on the couch and laid his head back against the back, enjoying the silence for a little while until a low broken moan echoed from upstairs. He growled and placed a hand over his mouth and nose, Cas’s heat was beginning to overrun every smell in the house. He could feel his alpha pushing to surface. He was keeping it pushed down all he could, minus a few small growls and his eyes glowing. He was winning until he heard the omega, his omega, just upstairs, let out a low whiney moan and whimper out,  “Dean.” Dean was up the stairs and on the outside of Cas’s door before he even knew he had moved.
Sometimes when he’s alone and it’s late he’ll wonder about Cas. If he’ll ever find out about her. If he’ll ever love her, or them. If they will ever be together again. When things get bad and he needs someone to cry to or just a friend he calls Benny. He loves Benny, he really does.
“Little,” Dean said, “it's time to get up. School time, Sammy.”
Dean huffed, “Not sure,” he said turning to lean against the glass window, “he’s in surgery right now, there's internal bleeding and some bleeding on his brain.” He slid down the glass and sat on the floor, “It’s my fault.” Dean pulled his knees up to his chest and laid his head down on them, “I was driving. I didn’t even see the semi, nobody’s quite sure what happened or how it happened but we should all be glad we aren’t dead, at least that’s what the doctor in the ER said. Dad was almost thrown from the car. Me and Sammy got lucky. I have a concussion and Sammy got a broken rib or two. Dad’s been back…” he paused as a loud cry came from the other side of the glass, “I’ll be right back,” he pushed off the floor and walked back into the room.
Dean had just walked past the trophies when a soft tune sounded through the doors of the drama room. He wasn't sure but it sounded like a piano.  It was beautiful, and not something he was used to hearing in this school. Dean pushed open the room’s door quietly and moved into the shadows of the dark school theater.
I, I am golden
Dean was stumbling a little down the steps but he made it down and started to jog around the porch. “Baby, you’re a firework, come on and show them what you’re worth,” Dean sings, horribly off key, with his phone.
Cas looked at Dean, head cocked to the side, but he did as Dean said, turned his back to the trampoline and hopped on to springs before sliding onto the blankets that Dean had set up, “Are you coming too?” Cas asked, uncertainty.
“So are you,” Dean said, looking into the beautiful blue eyes of the boy beside him.
A nurse and Emmy came into the room a few minutes later. Dean sat on the bed and pulled Emmy in his, being mindful of her arm. She wasn’t crying anymore. The nurse smiled at Dean, “You must be the father,” she said, shaking Dean’s hand, “I’m Tessa, and just a little update, she was given some pain medicine in the ambulance. The x-ray will be looked at to see where it's broke. It’ll be set and a cast will be put on it. She’ll probably fall asleep before the doctor gets in here but if she does it's the medicine, let her sleep.” Dean looked down at Emmy who was already half asleep. Dean smiled. “I’ll see you guys later,” Tessa said easing out of the room.
Dean stepped closer to Cas, “Damn Cas,” he said towering over the smaller boy, pressed against the locker room wall. Everything Castiel had made people believe until that day was wiped away with a single action. Dean pressed his body against Cas and lowered his head to the crock of Castiel’s neck.
Cas stepped out of his pants, removed his shirt and moved back to the bed, reclaiming his previous position over Dean. Dean pushed himself up on his elbows and claimed Cas’ lips, while falling back to the bed.
Dean sighed and melted into the kiss, but only for a moment before pulling away and looking back at the carpet, pushing his toes between the plush carpet. “ I love you too, Cassie, but it doesn’t change this. The only reason we were allowed to be together to begin with was because we were both unpresented. It’s not just frowned upon, it's almost illegal. And one day you’ll want a family. You’ll want things that I won't be able to give. Male omega’s aren’t common, and that’s the only way we can be together now. And you know how badly Male Omegas can be treated. Even if by some miracle I presented as an omega, it could two years from now, and I’m not sure that I want to.” Dean sighed again. He felt the water break past his eye and a tear ran down his cheek followed closely by quite a few more.
So hey everyone. I need to know something I have the next to chapter wrote but the next one is super sad and either John or Mary dies I won't say which. I can rewrite them where they don't die or I can leave it as it is. It is up to you, my people. Comment and let me know. love you all!!! Comment tell me I need to know!!!!!  oh and if any one can tell me how to load pictures that are saved on my computer on here please let me I want to do like a college thing with baby pics of Gracie but I can't figure out how to do any help would be great!!!
He pulled out his phone again and called Sam explain what was going on with Cas and asking him to stay with Emmy til Gabe got home. He sat quietly while Sam explained why Dean staying was a horrible idea,
Naomi chuckled, “Exactly.” She got up and moved the chair back, “I’m gonna get ready.” She left them alone in the room again, stopping at the door, “Put that in a container for me, please.”
Cas groaned, “Please, Dean, no Dr. Sexy.”
“Not sure,” he said over another honk, “but I’ll find you. Bye Dean.”
The nurse barely looked up, “I need to see some ID,” she snapped. Dean dug in his back pocket for his wallet, damn it he didn’t have time for this. He needed to see her. He handed his licence to the nurse. She typed something on her computer and a snapped a picture of him before printing him off a badge and telling him how to get to the room that Emmy’s in. The only thing keeping him calm during this was a single thought that Cas is with Emmy.
Dean just sat for a moment before leaning over on Cas. He laid his head on Cas’ shoulder and closed his eyes, even after his nap earlier he was still tired, and his bed didn’t seem to as confortable as Cas’ couch. Grace was already sleeping so soundly that it didn't seem right to move the baby. “We could stay,” he said, not moving from how he was sitting, almost scared that Cas would reject him again.
“Because you loved someone else, someone you couldn’t be with,” Cas finished for her placing a hand over hers and the other on the side of her face, gently turning it so that she was looking at Cas.
Sam walked into the living room and followed behind John; he was still a little unsteady on his feet. They slowly made their way into the dining room.
Dean looked so happy, resolved. The pain of losing of Cas seemed to faded some at the news of the baby, “You have to tell Sam too.”
Cas was standing in the doorway to Gracie's room just looking at it, picturing the future he hoped would happen in this house, with the people he loved, when the doorbell rang. He closed the door and walked toward the front of the house.
“I’m gonna do my best not to,” he said before walking out of the room and back to his car. The drive home was short, and he hoped that Dean was still there.
Cas smiled at his sisters over protectiveness, “A friend needed a ride home, and, ummm, I need you to come get me.”
“I have a brother?” asked Cas. Nobody had notice that he had walked in and was standing close to the door.
She shook her head slowly, “Someone I didn’t know. It’s complicated. I was about ten when I was on a yacht with a family my father worked with at the time. It was captured by pirates, they ramshacked everything. I hid, while they tied up the family that I was with. I was terrified and then I heard someone walking toward me. I can remember the sound of his boots hitting the boat’s floor, I thought he was coming to kill me or to take me out with the others, but he didn't he handed me a life jacket and snuck me off the boat. The heat from the when the boat exploded burned my face. There was a small boat closer to shore that called in the explosion. It felt like I was in the water for hours and I think I was before the Coast Guard pulled me out.”
I was Sam that saved the moment. He walked in from the kitchen having missed the question, “Now that Daddy’s here, bug, you wanna watch the movie?”
“You don’t know what I did to him, so nothing that I went through was nearly enough. I deserved to go through that, all of that and so much more.”
Dean stayed where he was, an arm around Gracie holding her tight to him. He had his other hand on her head, praying that she stayed asleep and kept her eyes close.
He watched as Dean took another deep breath, this time through his nose, and watched as the black pushed out the last remaining green in his eyes. He watched as the primal side of Dean began to grow and take over. “Please leave,” Castiel begged.
“All of it,” Cas answered, looking ashamed. “None of which you asked for.”
Dean once again elbowed Benny trying to draw him out of whatever internal alpha thing was happening here, “ Benny,” he said elbowing his friend a little harder when he still just kept looking at their waitress. “Sorry about him,” Dean began after the second elbow, “bring him a sweet tea please.” She wrote it all down, smiling, before turning and walking away to get their drinks.
“I was,” Dean spoke up before Mary could continue. He had been nice to Cas, well nicer, but it wasn’t his fault that Cas left today.
“Oh god, Cas,” Dean whimpered, throwing his head back into Cas’ pillow. There was more sliding and less rocking as both boys began reaching their climax. Cas sealed his lips on Dean’s, stealing every breathy moan, groan, whimper and praise that Dean released, as he came in his boxers, pressed tightly against Cas, hands grabbing Cas’ hips, digging his nails deep into the tanned skin there. Cas followed Dean a few more rocks, slides, grinds, whatever he was doing now, hand clenching his sheets on either side of Dean’s body.
The knob twisting is what brought Dean back to himself. He shoved his alpha back down, released the handle and slammed himself back against the wall. He wouldn’t do this again. Not to Cas. Cas deserved better than this. He slid down the wall landing on his ass with a thud. He was panting hard with his head buried in his hand, listening to the whimpering on the other side of the door.
John added on, “If you hurt Dean again, I’ll rip your throat out.”
Ash and Dean had been talking for a good thirty minutes or so when Becky stepped up to the mic that was set up in one corner of the room alone with a keyboard. Becky had called Dean about six months ago, asking for some pictures of Benny for the memorial that she wanted to do for the classmates that had passed away before the ten year reunion. Dean would never admit to anyone that he cried as he looked for pictures that he knew Benny would be proud of.
Dean stumbled around in the dark for a few moments before stopping in front of the bunk beds. He just stood there looking down at Cas’ still figure before gently climbing in the bed beside him.
“Yeah,” Cas answered smiling softly and pulling his gaze away from the man beside him and to the scene outside the window.
“Yeah, Baby,” Dean smiled down at his daughter, as she ripped open the present. Dean looked up to see Gabe recording the little girl. He had to be doing that for Cas. Dean leaned down next to his daughter and smiled as she tore the paper off the box. She was so excited. Dean loved seeing Emmy this way, hopefully, Cas would too.
A few minutes later Andrea walked over to the table and Dean felt Benny shift beside him, something changed in him. Dean had known Benny for almost a year now and not once had he truly seen his alpha surface until now. His nostrils flared enough to know that he like what he smelled a lot. He was blinking trying to control the shift in his eyes.
“No,” he was tired and confused. It was like four in the morning and he had to work in a few hours.
“Isn’t that the kid-” Ash began to ask but Dean cut him off, “Yeah, but just listen to him.”
“Alright” Dean tossed his hands up in the air and walked over to the swing beside her. “Try this” he said, “kick both feet at the same time in the same direction. Kick out, pull in.” She did as Dean said. “Now repeat it.” She continued to kick her feet in and out, going a little higher each time, “There you go baby.” Dean watched as his babygirl got higher and higher, smiling and laughing.
“We need to get her to the nurse, Cas, can you carry her?” Lisa asked looking at her student. Her arm was bleeding, Lisa had never seen Emmy cry like this before. She watched as Cas swopped Emmy up in his arms, trying to calm his daughter.
“It's not in every culture that omegas are treated badly,” ‘Drea said, sitting on a beautiful white lounge, well more lying than sitting. She had her head propped up on one arm and she was sorta on one side, facing Castiel. Her long dark hair, french braided and pulled to one side. Her small body curved perfectly with the couch. “American’s are a strange group,” the Greek heiress said, “In Greece, Omegas are cherished. The head of the family may be an alpha, as it is here, but omegas stand beside him not underneath him. Father listens to me above all the others, including Sorento, his first born Alpha.”
“Its getting late,” Cas sighed. Dean didn't say anything just looked at Cas, “If you want I can take y’all home”
“I’ll race you!” She screamed and they took off toward the house. Dean started to jogged but Emmy reached the house long before he did. She started jumping up and down singing, “I beat you! I beat you!”
Cas ran to the two story house a few blocks away from his house. He needed to see Dean, to tell him. It was a snowy day, school had just let out for christmas. Sophomore year was already halfway done. Cas came to a stop and looked up at the large white house in front of him, Dean’s. He smiled as he walked up to the bright red door and knocked. “Hold on,” he heard Dean yell from the other side of the door. Cas couldn't stop smiling.
Cas walked home at a slow pace not really wanting to face his parents now knowing that they had been right about Dean. He walked up to the house about thirty minutes later, seeing his mother sitting out in her rocking chair. "Oh thank God," she sighed as she rushed out to meet her very tired son. "I didn't think I'd see you again,"  she wrapped her arms around Cas. "Come on in. I'll make you a sandwich. You don't have to talk if you don't want but if you do I'm right here, baby, as always." She tugged Cas's arm until he followed her inside and to the kitchen.
Dean sat in algebra, head propped up on his hand, elbow resting on his desk, trying his best to stay awake. He tried to listen as Mr. Copeland talked about polynomial functions. His head was hurting and he was starting to get hot. He swayed in his chair a little before his hand shot up.
He was pulled out of his thoughts as a hand landed on his shoulder, “Hey man,” Sam said his voice rumbling low behind Dean, “look who I found outside.” For a split second his mind betrayed him and he could see himself turning around a seeing Cas standing beside Sam, but he knew better than to hope for that. Before he could turn around he heard Emmy calling out, “Uncle Gabe!”
“She looks like you,” Dean said watching Cas playing with Grace.
After setting the timer, Mary stirred everything and took up the last pieces of chicken. “He wasn’t upset when he found you, was he?” She asked quietly.
Hey everyone! So back with a new chapter. And alot of comments have been about the major douchebaggery of Cas, well think of him how he was when he wanted to open purgegotory and steal all the souls and when he was "God". He was bad and hurt people but he believed what he was doing was for the best. that's kinda how this Cas is. He has his reasons, you just don't know them yet. But you will, maybe soon, maybe not. we'll see. Thanks everyone for the comments and kudos, they make my day.
Great, Castiel thought, just what I need to be stuck in a fucking locker room with Dean fucking Winchester. “Shit. Shit. Fuck,” Castiel whispered to himself, “come on calm down. Calm down or Dean is gonna smell you.” Castiel was nervous and almost shaking trying to calm himself down.
“I don’t know,” Mary admitted.
“That should work,” Dean said still smiling softly.
He started working for Bobby full time in the small garage slash scrap yard the old man had. Dean was good at fixing cars always had been. Thanks to John, Dean’s father that passed away when Dean was fifteen. John had taught Dean all about cars and had left the boy his most prized possession, his baby, a sleek black beauty, a 1967 chevy impala. Dean passed his GED test while working full time at Bobby’s, keeping Sam on the straight and narrow and taking care of his ailing mother. Dean thrived when he was busy. He couldn’t think about any stray thoughts if his mind was always busy. It was late at night when the house was dark and silent that Dean let him mind wander to where his beautiful omega was and how he was doing.
The stories we will write
It's hard to walk away
“You didn't eat,” Dean’s voice was flat, but Cas could hear something like irritation in it.
Cas snuck over the side wall, where Michael’s security was the weakest, the trees were the thickest here and he could sneak into his room from here, avoiding Michael completely until he was able to take a shower. Stepping out of the shower, he wrapped a soft white towel around him. He hated washing their scent of him. He hadn’t truly realised how much he missed the family. His family. He had a baby. She was beautiful, absolutely beautiful. He could still see those big blue eyes staring at him.
I want to try to explain Cas's thinking. I know IRL that this would never happen. What happened to Cas is not something that can just be gotten over, and he may never be over it but at the same time He and Dean have a bond that cant be broken, a true bond now that Dean also has a claim from Cas. There's conflict inside of Cas. Fear and longing, its not something that can be dealt with easy and I don't feel like I have given Cas time to work throw things. It took entirely to long to figure out how i wanted it to happen and there will be more until I feel like the ending I have wrote fits the story.
"Be good," Bobby said as he pulled off.
Emmy walked in between them as they walked into the doctor office. The appointment took about a hour and a half, and afterwards Emmy had talked Dean into stopping by Dairy queen for ice cream. They sat outside on the warm day, laughing and talking while eating their cones.
Emmy was talking excitedly to Cas about how she was gonna get the cast off today.
“All mine, one of many actually. Daddy likes to buy my affection,” Crowley said with grin. The rest of the short ride to the Winchester home was silent.
Dean watched as Cas came back into the room holding the toys for Gracie. Cas placed the toys in front of Gracie, close enough so that she could reach them if she wanted them. He then moved back to the couch and sat beside Dean.
They finished the movie right before the doorbell rang, “I got it,” Cas said getting up off the couch and walked over to the door, opening it to the delivery man. He handed Cas the pizzas and the receipt before leaving.
Dean noticed, looking slightly down to see the angry red mess left on Castiel’s neck. The animal side took over again, leaning in to Cas and began cleaning the wound. He licked at the wound until the noise died down and the last of the boys had left the room. The bell rang signaling the next class and Dean and Cas were still locked together sitting in the stall. Cas winced every time more cum was shot into him, silent tears still running down his face.
Dean didn’t want to think about what or who Cas was doing. He was on the verge of tears. His stomach was cramping from the abuse it just took and he was still gagging every few seconds. He slid down the stall wall and sat on the hard cold floor as Cas growled from his spot in the room.
Michael stood up and dig into his pockets again, “Also I’ve signed the car over to you. I'll have Ion bring it over later today.”
“Do you think Cassie will want to watch the movie with us and eat pizza?” her voice was small and unsure, almost like she was scared to ask.
Cas slid as close behind Dean as he could, pressing himself against Dean’s back. He pressed his lips to the crook of Dean’s neck breathing deeply, like Dean did earlier. Cas’s senses has sharpened a great deal of the last few weeks. He loved the way Dean smelled. He was all leather and spice with a touch of motor oil, but right now Cas could smell the sorrow, the sadness and lose that engulfed the boy. “I love you,” he whispered again kissing the spot on his neck.
“Not when it was truly important,” Cas closed the small distance between them and kissed Dean.
“Where to?” Cas asked, turning the key. A low rumble filled the air as he waited for Dean’s answer.
She seemed to forget about the other question,”Yeah, yeah, put it on Uncle Sammy.” Emmy jumped out of Dean's lap and grabbed his hand pulling him up with her, “Daddy let's sit closer to Cassie so Uncle Sammy can sit on the couch too.”
“I don't want to regret it.”
Cas sat back on the porch and looked at the picture, it looked like it had been taken from a distance. Michael probably had a private detective following the guy. He wondered what his brother would be like. If Cas would ever get to meet him.
Emmy soon curled into Cas’s side and drifted off to sleep. Cas wrapped an arm around Emmy and pulled her close. He soon felt his eyes drooping to,it had been a long day. He laid his head back and felt not the couch but Dean’s arm. Both men jumped and startled Emmy. Dean covered it well, “You ready for bed, Muffin?” Dean asked.
enjoy my lovelies and let me know what you think. i need to know. love you guys.
“Hmmm?” he asked still not really paying attention and absent mindedly rubbing a hand across his nose.
“Nothing, “ Dean chuckled and that was true. “She came over to the house after Lisa left me and tried to get in bed with me again, and I turned her down again. Not only is she Bobby’s stepdaughter, but Ellen’s treated me like a son since we meet freshman year. I tried telling her that, but you know your sister, she can be crazy at times.”
“When,” Dean said after two pancakes.
She laid the box next to the others and pulled out the card. She didn't open it, just handed it to Dean so he could read it later. Emmy picked up the doll and started rocking her. Dean took the chance to look at the phone in Gabe’s hand, he was still recording. “Thank you,” Dean mouthed looking at the phone and smiling slightly.
“A few weeks later, he had arranged for me to marry your mother and Luke and Gabe weren't spoken about again.”
Cas spent two days with Dean. Two days lost in a heat with brief moments of clarity locked inside of them. Dean was everything Cas ever thought he was before that day had happened. He was sweet and loving. He took care Cas. He filled Cas in way possible.
“Cuttin through to D-wing, it's cold out there and warm in here,” he chuckled as more students began to file in.
He walked out to the highway and started walking back to Kansas. As cars passed he held his thumb out hope that one would stop. An hour later six cars had passed, not bothering to look back. The seventh car passed and slowed. The driver leaned his arm out the window and motioned for the boy to come here. Cas ran up to the car's passenger window. It was old mixed matched color car, that was in serious need of a paint job. "Where you headed, boy?" asked an older man with a short cut beard and a dirty ball cap.
Hearing Cas beg, broke Dean. His will faded away slowly as Cas pulled Dean on top of him, laying back as they moved. Cas claimed Dean’s lips, his tongue running along Dean’s soft plump lips, causing Dean to moan into Cas’ mouth, “I can’t,” Dean said into Cas’ mouth, giving Cas the chance he needed to slip his tongue into Dean’s mouth.
Dean leaned in closer and kissed the tip of Cas’s nose, “Don’t, Dean,” Cas tried to keep his voice even, it didn't work.
“A little,” Dean admitted.
“I wouldn’t dream of it, baby” he spoke softly and nuzzled at Dean shoulder inhaling the scent around it. It was so different than anything he had smelled before, so much better than anything he had smelled before. Dean slowly drifted back to sleep and Cas followed.
He winked at the lady as she batted his shoulder, grinning, “You are too much boy, what are you doing in here so early, I think you're the first student I’ve seen today.”
But I'll always remember”
“I never said I don't want you here,” Dean muttered so low that Cas wasn't sure he had said anything at all.
Great, Dean scolded himself. He should have known that things would be back to being stressed between them as soon as Cas was in his right mind again.
While Benny’s attention was on Andrea, Dean’s shifted to the door that was now being opened. In walked Cas, just Cas, no pose of alpha assholes following after him, just Cas in beautiful form fitting blue jeans that hugged his ass in the best way possible, and damn that shirt could not fit any better. The top two buttons undone, showing just enough of the tanned skin on his chest, the sleeves on both arms rolled up to the bend in his elbow, damn he looked good. And that smile when his eyes landed on Dean, it lit up the room.
The nurse opened the door and Dean followed her directions on how to get to Emmy. He found her room in a few minutes and slowly opened the door, Cas was sitting alone in the room, “Where’s Emmy?” Dean asked.
A sandwich, he could put together a sandwich, something light and easy, that won't hurt Cas’ or make him uncomfortable or sick. He slapped together the sandwich and grabbed the bottle of water before heading upstairs. He knocked on the door twice before slowly turning the knob, preparing himself for whatever he was about to walk in on.
“He knows,” Dean said looking back at Cas and then at Gracie.
Cas was unsure but walked over to the bed anyway. He and Dean had only been together for a few months, and while he was anything but innocent he was still very much a virgin and was scared that sharing a bed with Dean would mean that tonight was the night he gave Dean everything he had left.
Michael's grip was firm as he held Cas’ hand. “I will regret how I treated you for the rest of my life.” Michael turned Cas’ hand just enough so that he could see the scars, that are usually hidden beneath long sleeves. “I am so sorry.”
Dean saw the muscles in Cas’ back tense when Dean walked in. He heard the sliding stop.
Mary noticed the panicked looked on her son’s face, “We got some things that she needed while you were asleep. Would you like for me to show you how to feed her?”
“No, I’m not and you truly don't want me to. Gabe said that you have what you need and I’ll be here to protect you, if needed.” Dean smiled as Cas almost pouted as he marched up the stairs to his room, much like Emmy does when she's in trouble.
Sam came thundering down the stairs pulling a red shirt over his head, almost tripping on the last stair, “I’m coming,” he called, “Wait, Dean,” Sam stumbled over his untied shoes and landed face first behind the couch. “Dammit,” the thirteen year old cursed. “I’m ready, Dean, lets go get Dad.”
“I told him the same thing, that he was still family. He said not anymore and left.” Mary sighed.
Dean huffed and turned back around walking past the old gym and the band room. He chuckled to himself as he walked past the front office remembering when Benny had walked into one of the concrete columns outside of the doors. He missed Benny and wished the son of bitch was he with him now, but no Benny had to go be a hero.
Dean sighed as she walked away, he thought it would be different by now. Everyday he feels like he’s missing something, of course he knows what that is, or better yet who that is. He loves Emmy, with all his heart, but sometimes it hurts to look at her. She is so much like Cas. She smart and loves books. She has his smile and her eyes light up the same way his did.
Ion was the only one that still felt like family. “Hello, Cassie,” he smiled and tossed an arm on his shoulder. “How are you?”
Bobby had a few guys working for him. An Omega, Garth, who Dean thought wasn’t the brightest crayon in the box but after a few later Dean would admit that the omega had grown on him. A beta, Ash, Bobby had him working on most of the new cars that came in that needed work done that involved the computer. Bobby would work on new cars at all if he didn't need the money, he hated that damn thing. And an alpha, Benny, Dean didn't trust him at first but now Dean adored the big the bear.
Dean looked over at Cas, “I’m sorry for who I was in high school. We, me and Benny, had talked about you, Garth and Kevin a few times since graduation, believe it or not we did grow up and realise what colossal assholes we were. Benny treated you how he did, because he was afraid of you, afraid that I would leave him. Its funny, he noticed long before I did, after that I would watch you at lunch and when we saw you in the hallway. He was scared that I would try to replace him.”  Dean huffed again, at how ridiculous Benny had been, “Like that could ever happen. He's gone and still holds most of me.”
treated him like shit.  When he told Dean that he had forgiven him and Benny a long time ago; he meant it, but that didn't mean he had just let go of all of the feeling. They would rush in every time he thought about high school; however sitting out here watching the silent tears trailing down his tormentor's face, he finally released it, all the pain, the anger, the hate, all of it washed away by the silent tears that he was never meant to see.
“Can I see him, please?”
Dean huffed out a laugh, grabbed his not clean boxers of the floor and slipped them on before following Cas’ orders to go take a shower.
“Cause I'm not weak, I'm not broken I am bold
“John, calm down,” Bobby said pushing his chair back, away from the table and stood up, “I need to go talk to Dean. Stay here I’ll be back in a minute.”
Grace had calmed back down, and wormed herself closer to Cas. he laid back on Dean’s bed and wrapped Gracie tightly in his arms. He knew that Dean liked to sing ‘Hey Jude’ softly to Gracie, so Cas started to hum it to her. SHe blinked slowly a few time before closing her eyes.
“No ma’am” Cas smiled easily at her, “he was unusually nice.” Cas fully believed that Mary was the reason for that. Cas leaned against the counter, “I think I’m gonna go into town or something while y’all have dinner. Y’all have already been so great to me, the least I can do is not intrude on a moment like this.”
“What best for me, is best for my omega,” Dean simply stated.
Crowley moved over to the side of Dean’s bed and sat on the edge, “Because Castiel isn't the only guy that loves you.” He looked down to see Dean’s eyes closed and his breath even, he slowly leaned down and place a small kiss on Dean’s forehead before getting up and leaving the house.
“William. He said that only girls and omegas can have babies.” Emmy was quiet for a moment. She just looked at Dean, like she was trying to see into his soul. “Where is my mommy or omega?”
Dean was eating some soup when Bobby returned with a bag from a pharmacy. When bobby walked in the room, Dean handed the almost empty bowl to Mary and she exited the room. “Do you think you can make it to the bathroom? I need you to take this,” he handed Dean a small box.
“I have not,” Cas said looking up at Emmy, hoping he knew the next question that she was gonna ask.
Laying down she wrapped her arms around herself. The bed felt to big, to cold. Everything she loved about her bed was laying in a different bed. Alone. In a cold hospital bed.
Sure enough, when he opened the front door, Mary was standing on the porch, and she was smirking. “You know she’s asleep don’t you,” Dean laughed as he pulled his mom into a hug.
Don't get it twisted”
She pulled a big brown leather book out of its place, sitting back down and flipping through some pages, “I think he’s a Carrier,” she said stopping on a page and passing the book over to Cas, “They are mostly legends. Mostly the stories talk about an unpresented submitting to an alpha and getting pregnant. There's usually a claim in most of them. They are super rare. They don't really have a status, some choose to become their alpha’s omega others don’t. It’s all there in that book. I thought they were just stories my father used to tell me and read. He says that my omega was a carrier, that he was absolutely beautiful. They’re special. Dean’s special.”
“Are you sure you don’t mind me coming today?” Cas countered.
Castiel sniffled and wiped his face, “Shut the fuck up, Dean. I hate you. This is why, Dean, why I never told you what I am, because down under that best friend bullshit your just another fucking entitled Alpha, who thinks he can own any omega that comes near him. You fucking bastard.” Castiel covered his face and sobbed quietly until Dean’s knot went down.
Cas looked around the room until his eyes landed on Dean, who was standing in the corner with his back to the glass talking to, from the looks of him, an alpha. A new alpha. Cas had been replaced, but Dean could have anyone why would he chose to be with another alpha, maybe he just had a type. Cas was staring at the back of Dean, well Cas wouldn’t call it staring but Dean would and actually had a few times. It was just one of the things that Dean picked on him about.
Why, Dean thought, and he wanted to ask, but before he could Cas gently lead him down the stairs.
Sam was at the house in fifteen minutes barging in the door, without even knocking, “Are you fucking insane, Dean. You can’t be around him like this. The only reason you didn’t die after the bond was broken was because of Emmy. Your alpha isn't mourning him anymore, Dean, don't do this to yourself. You're not sick anymore. It took you years to be here. Don't give all that work up.” Sam sounded like he was begging, “I almost lost you, Dean, Emmy almost lost you.”
I, I am golden”
Outside Dean sat on the top step and pulled out his phone, after a few rings, he got an answer, “I thought he was on suppressants, dammit, Gabe.”
“Umm,” Cas cleared his throat, “are you thirsty. I have tea in the fridge. Mary taught me how to make it right before I moved in over here.”
Cas pushed himself off the bed just enough to reach over Dean and find his phone on the laying on the other side of Dean. Turning on the screen, he saw that it was only nine thirty. Maybe Dean was telling the truth.
“What then?” John asks.
Can't you tell?”
Cas smiled and buried his hands into Dean’s hair, it was soft from his shower earlier, and pulled him back to him making their lips meet again.
“Ok, Mom,” Cas called out, watching the movie.
“Never,” Cas told him, letting go of his hand and securing his face softly in both hand, making the other boy look up at him. “I love you, Dean. I loved you before I presented and I’ll continue to love you after.” Cas leaned in a softly pressed his lips against Dean’s.
“I met Luke in highschool, he had already presented as an omega and was never ashamed of what he was. He flaunted it. And he had me wrapped around his finger the moment he spoke to me. I never brought him around your grandfather. His saying was “male Omegas breed male Omegas and our line has no male omegas.” I knew it would be a complete shit storm if he found out about Luke.”
Mary answered her first, wanting a chicken caesar salad; Sam ordered the same thing. Dean wanted a double bacon cheeseburger with cheese fries and a slice of apple pie. Benny sat quietly, just watching Andrea, “I’ll have the same,” he said watching as Andrea wrote out their order. Their eyes would meet every few second, a small smile spreading across her lips.
Dean just smiled more fondly at Cas. It was nice seeing him setting beside him again, maybe they could do this more often, “We have to stop by Wal-Mart to get her medicine, hope that's ok.”
She suddenly wasn’t hungry anymore. She walked into the kitchen, turned off the soup and put the two, almost whole, pizzas in the fridge.
“Yes sir.” Castiel knew that Michael having this information would be bad for Crowley but lying to his father was never a good thing.
“Of course,” Dean was staggering slightly as he made his way next to Cas. “She's my baby. The only thing that I know won't ever let me down.”
Dean's shower a little longer than Cas’, soaking in the hot water, letting it wash away the strain in his muscles.
She fell into a restless sleep.
It only took a moment for him to answer the omega back, “I’m looking the Winchester’s, John and Dean, father and son, brought in about an hour ago, they were in a bad car wreck.”
“Really?” Cas asked feeling more like a third wheel the part of the unit? Group? Family? His family? Cas took Dean’s place pushing the buggy around the store.
Cas doesn't move just lays there looking completely fucked out. His senses are faded and his eyes are heavy. This is a new kinda high that he has never been able to reach before.
“Have you watched this yet?”
Cas stood back up and washed off his body before stepping out and grabbing a towel. He dried himself off rather well and pulled on his boxers, before heading back to his room.
“What do you mean?” Dean asked his mom. He hadn’t really been paying attention to them all that much while they talked. His mom and Bobby had been babbling about the science behind what was going on with Dean, like science could actually explain the animalist side of each person, or how they presented. It wasn’t science it was nature.
Dean was stiff by the time his knot went down, turns out that a toilet should not be sat on for 30 minutes straight with someone in you lap. “ Cas, I think you can get up now,” Dean tired to keep his voice indifferent, to pretend that hearing his omega claim that he hated him didn’t bother him at all. Castiel didn’t respond, just sat on Dean’s lap crying into his hands. Dean bounced his legs attempting to get Cas to respond.
Fucking Amara, his brain supplied again.
Cas started laughing so hard he was doubled over the bed. “Harty har har,” Dean laughed at the two of them.
Benny was the first to notice that Dean was awake, “Hey there Sleeping Beauty,” the alpha chuckled glad to see that Dean was finally awake.
You thought I was coal
Dean turned his head to the side and buried his face in Cas’s dark brown hair, and he placed a hand over Cas’s on the dark mat, “Comfortable?” Dean asked.
Dean is as he was told and Cas smelt a little off too.
“I’m sorry sir, did you say no that you are not Castiel Novak’s mate. We have you down as his mate. Your Dean Ross Winchester right?” the voice asked, trying to figure this out.
The doctors said that John was gonna make a full recovery and would be coming home soon.
Cas left the house before the sun rose all the way. He had his own car but he like the thirty minute trek to and from school. School, he enjoyed less. Dean was in two of his four classes and in lunch. There was no way to get out of seeing him.
His hands shook as he watched himself caress the mark. Dean would have a scar just like this in a few months. He had claimed Dean, without his consent. What a pair they were.
Dean wondered what happened to Scott, Sophie, and Tessa as their pictures slipped on and off the screen.
Dean dropped his hand but stayed where he was, “It doesn’t matter why you did it,” Dean sighed.
“Language, Sam,” Mary said, stabbing a potato.
Dean laid his new angle back in her bed and crawled back into his bed. Blue eyes and sad words haunted his dreams again.
It took about two weeks but Cas found a nice little three bedroom house a few blocks from the Winchesters. Mary helped him with the lease and getting it furnished.
Dean's eyes were open and looking at Cas. Cas loved Dean’s eyes, the way the tiny specks of gold shone so bright against the green, but hated how they looked at this moment, they were glassed over and bloodshot. Cas could smell the bitter tang of alcohol on Deans breath. "You’re drunk,” Cas stated.
Gabe sat down beside Dean on the bench, “Wondering what I’m doing here?” he mused looking at Dean.
He walked straight to his car and climbed in. He locked the doors and started it up. If Castiel was asked how he got home that day he would say by a miracle because he doesn’t even remember walking out of the stall.
“Daddy,” Emmy screamed, running up to Dean and wrapping herself around his legs, however, she was only momentarily happy to see her daddy, “Where has you been, Daddy?” she demanded to know as soon as she let go of Dean’s legs.
Dean huffed softly, not really knowing what to say so he settled with, “It was a beautiful song,” he said it softly, not sounding like himself at all, he sounded broken, deflated and unmistakably sad.
“Sure, love,” Mary said kissing her alpha on the cheek before moving to the kitchen to do just that.
After tossing both books in his locker Crowley led Dean to the front office, where they checked out, and then to his car.  Dean smiled as they approached the candy apple red mustang, “She’s beautiful,” he whispered.
So enjoy another chapter!!!! let me know what yall think! comments make me work faster and faster!!! so the more comments the faster I type. so how fast do yall want the next chapter??? comments!!! I need them. tell me how yall feel.
Dean kept his composure until he was safe in his room. Gracie was asleep in her bed, so he flopped down on his bed, thankful for the wall that kept his tears safe from anyone to see. Later he called Benny and they talked for hours, Dean fell asleep listening to the alpha talk.
But it was Dean that answered, “No, Cas, how about you stop being a needy bitch and move on. Come on, Sammy,” Dean wrapped an arm around Sam’s shoulder protectively and all but pulled him along.
Like the tide that ebbs and flows
“The omega became withdrawn, by the time he had their second alpha son, the omega was demanding his own room. Which the alpha gave him. He had started to resent his alpha. He wouldn’t even get out of bed while he was pregnant with his their third child. He loved his children but pushed them away because they reminded him of his alpha. He pushed them all away.”
“We have had the time of our lives
They were almost done when Mary’s phone started ringing, she hurriedly answered it. She didn’t say much just a few okays, we will be there in a minute and thank you, as she hung up. She looked at the boys, “John’s showing signs of waking up soon, we should get going. I’ll go get the check from Ellen,” she said sliding out of the booth and stood up.
Dean smiled, “Hey Lisa,” he patted the step beside, “Where’s Ben?” he asked looking around.
“What do you mean your daughter, Cas? The baby at the dinner, the one that Dean was holding, she kept playing with your hair. She’s your daughter? I thought Dean was the father but if she’s your baby,” she stopped talking and walked over to the bookshelves lining one wall, “Has Dean presented?” she asked changing the subject looking at the names of the thick leather books.
“Better now,” Cas briefly tightened his hold on Dean before rolling away and stretching, “but I know I’ll feel even better after a shower. You can get one next.”
“Oh, your fine,” Cas said still rubbing his nose, “I mean you can. It’s fine,” Cas covered quickly.
Dean thought he saw Cas move toward him, but he wasn’t sure. What he was sure of is how soft and pliable Cas’ lips seemed under him. Cas’ seemed to melt under him, as Dean eased him back on the couch. He took every thing that Cas was giving him. Dean gently flicked his tongue over Cas’ bottom lip, begging for entrance. Cas slowly parted his lips for his stepbrother. Dean smiled as he slipped his tongue in Cas’ mouth.
Guess what, Yes I can”
Cas took the stairs a lot more slower than he needed but his body was heating up and Dean was waiting for him in the kitchen, where there were sandwiches made. Sandwiches that Dean had made.
He felt Cas move beside him, but he didn’t move. “We need to straighten up some,” Cas said breathlessly. Dean chanced a glance at Cas, and he was smiling, looking at Dean like he hung the moon. Dean blushed furiously and helped Cas clean off the coffee table. Cas put what was left of the pizzas in the fridge and locked the front door, while Dean put the whisky bottle back in the laundry room.
Hey y'all, so thanks to y'all all asking for more here is a little bit about how Dean is after the locker room. Its super short but I hope y'all like it. I think a lot of this will be in Dean's pov but there will be some Cas pov thrown in later. if this chapter gets praise then I will keep moving this forward. thank y'all for the comments and kudos they make my day. Love y'all.
“I’m sorry,” Dean said softly. “I’m sorry that I hurt you, that the guys still pick on you. I’m sorry that I can't be honest with you without any help. You are the best person I know.” Dean gently cupped the side of Cas’ face, “You are the most beautiful person i’ve ever seen.” He could feel the muscles in Cas’ cheek move slightly and he knew that Cas had a least a small smile on his face. “You are,” he chuckled, “and you deserve so much more than me. So much more than the shit you deal with at school and I’m sorry for my part,”
Cas stood hidden in the shadows listening to the two brothers talk. He hadn’t known that Dean had been sick. He’d ask Gabe every time he came back from seeing the alpha and their daughter but Gabe always told him that they were both fine. Listening to Sam talk, Cas could almost hear the hatred that the younger alpha had for him. Cas quickly walked back toward Emmy’s door as Dean began walking toward the hallway. He didn't want Dean to think he had been eavesdropping, even though he had.
Dean looked up and Cas, his bright green eyes almost glowed with rage, maybe he was meant to be an alpha, Cas thought, “What?” he asked.
“Please, Cas,” Dean gasped, as Cas rocked his hips and sucked harder on his neck.
Dean smiled, “You be good, bitch.”
It wasn’t until Dean shifted something that he was holding in his arms that Cas’s focused moved from Dean’s back to his shoulder, where a little face lay looking at him with blue eyes. Cas just looked back at the baby. The baby was wearing a soft blue hat, a boy maybe. Why was Dean holding a baby, was the first thing that popped into Cas’s head. Maybe it’s the alpha’s, he thought still looking at the child, Dean had always wanted kids, so maybe he found a way to get an alpha and a baby.
“Pick him up and bring him downstairs to the room lay him on the bed so we can get everything hooked up.” The next twenty minutes seemed to pass by in blur, but everything stopped as soon as the monitor picked up that sweet heart beat. Then it fluttered, just slightly but enough that everyone heard. “We need to get her out, Dean. She’ll be fine but we don’t have time for this to go naturally between the blood and all, she needs out. We are gonna have to do a c-section.”
Tammy tried to get Cas interested in her but often found himself looking in the rearview mirror at  Dean, “Oh,” Tammy whispered, “You like to watch huh?” Cas felt something snap inside him. He wasn’t watching them, he was watching Dean. Why was this random beta more than he was. Why wouldn't Dean hold him like that, wrap his arms around Cas and pull him close to him and suck marks on his neck or gently push him down against the leather seats and press his lips against Cas’s. Cas groaned as Tammy kissed his neck, Dean’s eyes opened and looked in the mirror catching Cas’s eyes on him. They looked at each other for a few minutes before Dean looks back at Suzy. It was at that moment when their eyes meet that he knew that he wanted something from Dean that he couldn’t have.
Dean looked at Cas with a fond expression, “She likes you. I think she knows that your family. You can always see her and I will never stop you from seeing her. I was talking to Gabe about that earlier. Since mom died she needs an omega in her life and Gabe suggested that maybe she could come over after school or on the weekends or something since y’all live here now. I get it if you don’t want anything to do with me. I don't deserve you. I never did, even before everything, you were always to good for me, hell you were even too good to be my friend. I know how bad I fucked up with everything, all of it.” Dean stopped talking and looked down at the white tiled floor.
“Okay, Pops, well I’m gonna go lay down til Bobby wakes up,” he paused and sat his cup of orange juice down. “I know you're mad at Cas and I know that a lot of all this is on him but this is both of our faults not just his.”
John sat in the dark living room, in his chair, looking at his wife sitting at the table, looking so incredibly sad. It was his fault. He could feel the stiffness in his knuckles from where he punched a kid. A boy. How could he do that? He was stronger than that. It wasn’t just Castiel that he was mad at. He was mad at himself and Kate and Mary and Dean and Sam. He was just mad.
“Juice,” Dean said smiling at a sleepy Grace, “‘The sun came up? How long have y’all been up?”
"I’m heading that way. Get in."
Upstair Bobby rolled over Sam’s desk chair over to the bed and gently woke up Dean. Dean groaned and looked up at him, “Hey old man,” he mumbled up at him, “If Ma called you then I’m really sick huh?”
The man looked at Dean and his eyes turned cold, “So the great Dean Winchester likes my music?” Dean could almost feel the bite in his voice, “I should feel honoured.”
It was hard for Dean, in school. It seemed like every week Cas was throwing a new omega in his face. April Kelly lasted a week. Hannah Martin lasted for a week and a half, until she found Cas in the janitor's closet with Tessa Evans, who was replaced a few days later by Anna Milton. Anna was gone after two days.
I'm not done, I'm no loser
Emmy went after the box first opening it to reveal a charm bracelet, with a single silver heart charm on it, on it was a EmmyLin in a cursive print, “Isn’t it pretty, Daddy?” She asked showing Dean the bracelet.
The sun began to set behind them before they closed up the house and pack everything back into the impala. They had the fish they caught in an extra cooler in the trunk. They had done good enough for a nice dinner one day. “Wanna drive?” John asked tossing Dean the keys, knowing that Dean would not say no.
“I’m gonna go change for bed too,” Cas said, “your room is that door,” Cas pointed to the first door and turned around to walk back to him room. He wanted nothing more than to push Dean against the wall and bury his face in Dean’s neck. He closed the door to his room as he walked in and flopped down on the bed. Dean was here in his house, was going to spend the night in his house. Cas could smell Dean’s scent through the walls.
