kissed somebody? Ever?”
“I was terrified. Utterly paralyzed. I just...I stood there. Didn't call the police. I just watched my brother stare at the body and drop the knife onto the floor beside her. He was breathing heavily...and that was it, you know? His breathing...my breathing...neither of us moved or said a single word. But the fight must have been loud because our father came out of his study and saw what happened. And then he tied Lucifer to a chair and began performing an exorcism. Funny enough...Lucifer wasn’t possessed by a demon. He was just frightened and angry. And I just...stood there. And I watched. But that exorcism ritual? It wasn’t written for expelling demons. I don’t know where my father found it. But it summoned
Castiel blinks his eyes open as his vision swims into focus. He feels dizzy, disoriented, and like he can’t quite focus on what’s in front of him. His computer sits open on some website on apocalypse lore amongst at least twenty other tabs. On the rickety table, a puddle of drool had formed where he’d fallen asleep.
“I could tell you were really upset. Dean — where are you going?”
“There’s a small cave just underneath there. You’ll have to squeeze through, but that should take you out and towards Dean.” A sudden urgency seems to grip Garth at once. “You have to go
“Whaddya looking at me like that for? Why, you’ve never —
“It was very good,” Castiel murmurs. “You...you’re very good. I mean that, Dean. You’re good to me. You’ve done more for me these past few months than I ever could have asked for. You...you’re funny, you’re kind. You’re brave and you’re easily the strongest man or angel I’ve ever met.”
Balthazar breathes a sigh. “He just left. He insisted on burning your body, but I...I couldn’t. Call me a softie, but there was some part of me that believed we could still drag your bloody ass back out. But after you became that hell hound’s chew toy, I didn’t hear from your brother again. He got quiet. Real quiet. Like he was...thinking about all this stuff. I tried to reach out to him, but…no luck. Not on my end.”
“I want this,” Castiel assures him. “Believe me. I just need to take it slow. I trust you, Dean. I promise. You won’t hurt me - and I’ll tell you if you need to stop or slow down.”

Dean almost laughs.

Her voice is firm but gentle, and impossible to say ‘no’ to. Truthfully, Dean doesn’t know how he’d have made it home otherwise; the biting, winter wind only amplifies the searing pain in his face. Quickly, the two boys follow her up the path and into her house. She leads them into the kitchen, gesturing for them both to sit down as she grabs peroxide, bandages, and a wet cloth from underneath her sink.
“The payment will be keeping this house,” Dean points out. “It’s not like all this is free. Dad got lucky with being able to set up shop here, and there are no other big dealerships in town to run us out. He’s already got customers lined up for the next few months, but he needs to be able to keep up with everything. And I’ve gotta help.”
But there’s no answer. No promise. No gentle, guiding hand he’d been promised would come in his time of need. Maybe he hasn’t been faithful enough. Maybe he’s done this all
This is a smut chapter. And one that isn't meant to be taken
They sit in silence for a long moment. Castiel looks at his glass, grateful for the presence of something to hold in his hands. His other hand trembles as he speaks again.
That brightens Gabriel’s face. Castiel laughs, placing a gentle hand on his little brother’s shoulder as his smile lingers over towards Dean. They share a knowing grin before Dean grows embarrassed and has to duck his face.
Inside, the empty floor is large and streaked with mud. In the dim light, Castiel has to squint to see anything, but he quickly realizes he doesn’t need to.
"Dad, you have no way of knowing if he's a queer or not," Sam points out. Dean flinches, already knowing where this is going to end up.
“I can’t,” he breathes. The simple truth cuts through him razor-shop. “I’ve got my brother to look out for, remember? My dad...he’s...he needs me. That car shop is all we have. Without it, we’d be back on the road again.”
“Who is killing the angels? How are they doing it?” he asks her quietly. Her red, swollen eyes blink at him curiously. Studying him.
“You shot an innocent man. I

he thinks to himself. The thought makes him feel silly, even though it is, technically, rational. He’s an angel - an angel of the Lord. A soldier of heaven. That’s what prayer is all about, isn’t it? Asking for help from a higher power. A higher power you have
“Cas,” he breathes. “Your face —”
“And there he goes," Michael growls. "This kid rages through the damn house, turning over cushions, screaming at me and Gabriel about his missing necklace before hiding away to bang on that old thing. Castiel!”
Kneeling beside him, Dean traces his finger through the soil, smiling when he sees a little sprout stretching its leaves toward the sun.
“I’ll make sure you finish school. I know that’s important to you. You’ll finish. And we can come back...but not while we’re still dependent on Dad.”
Baffled, he freezes when he and Castiel meet each other’s eyes. Castiel, with so much to worry about, with so much hurt and pain in his life...worries about Dean? Suddenly, Dean feels terribly small.
Very seriously, Castiel nods, before turning and hurrying back towards his house. Dean watches him go, shaking his head in disbelief.
A soft, gentle fondness that makes Castiel feel strange and vulnerable; that feeling he had in his dream where he swore Dean was staring straight into the light of his soul.
“I know you are, kiddo,” he whispers. There’s so much pride in his eyes, it rubs off on Castiel, too. He had come to see Jo as a friend and not just a trusted ally.
Dean sighs, tossing his ball up into the air and catching it with a groan. He doesn’t know what to say. He should be grateful. He knows that. And there are certainly a lot of things that Dean doesn’t miss about being on the road. He didn’t like being homeless, not knowing when they would eat next, not knowing when he could feed Sam. But it’s hard to make Sam understand that this home feels too small for Dean’s skin. Dean is pretty sure he won’t even be finishing his last few years of high school. School weighs him down. He can barely get through it most days, and when they were spending all their time on the road, Dean had been more preoccupied with helping his father with odd jobs or keeping food on the table for Sam. He wishes he knew how to put into words how he feels about this place; the way Dean can’t seem to wear it on his skin the way everybody else can. The way that he’s relieved he has stability, but craves the freedom all the same.
“Okay,” he says finally. “I trust you.”
“Was, um, ‘sexual adventures’ perhaps not the right word?”
“Dude,” Dean groans quietly. “C’mon.”
“Dean,” Castiel sputters. “You’re not making any sense. You’re telling me that to hide from
"I never told you about the day we ran away, did I?”
Castiel lifts a shaking hand, placing it over Dean’s wrist holding the blade to his throat. He gently pushes Dean’s hand towards his shoulder where Dean’s handprint marks his skin. Carefully, Dean presses his closed fist over the print before he drops the blade onto the floor, spreading his fingers to match the pattern. A shiver runs up Castiel’s body as the connection makes his skin sing to life. All at once, he can feel everything that is

Dean shrugs, biting the tip of his pencil absently.
Soon, the man steps back down from the stage and lowers himself onto Dean, bracing his slender arms onto the chair. Dean tilts his head back and Castiel can swear he sees him
“Hey, man, you alright?” Dean asks, gently poking Castiel’s side. Castiel jumps, blinking frantically as though just realizing Dean was sitting beside him. His food goes almost entirely untouched.
“Because I’m looking to see if my dad is home or not.”
Jodi sighs. She kneels in front of Dean, gently dabbing the wet cloth over his bloody face as Castiel watches. His hand twitches, but he says nothing more. Dean hisses in pain but forces himself to stay still as she gently cleans his face.
That strikes Dean. He’s silent for a moment, trying not to gag on his food. Dean knows that word; queer. It's a whispered, deadly word. One shouted across school playgrounds and with rolled eyes when regarding the two men living together in a flat downtown. It's a sneer and a label; a word to avoid. Dean has to swallow his food with a thick gulp before he finds the words to respond.
“I will say,” Alastair sighs lazily, “I was getting sick of Michael’s little human charade, too. Nearly all of heaven was planning on overthrowing him before he decided to cut out the abomination growing in his brain. Exactly why I lobbied to keep angels from spending too much time on earth. Samuel...Joanne...and now Michael. You, humans, make angels
,” the other says quietly. “I’m not the one who laid down the towel and tried to make the end of the world somebody else’s problem. This is where that got you, Castiel. The world is ugly...
“It was nice to meet you, Castiel,” Garth says with a grin. “I’ve heard so much about you and your importance to heaven.”
He nods behind them. Turning over his shoulder, Castiel spots several angels standing in the distance. They turn, spotting them both before they charge forward at a terrifying speed, ducking underneath low branches and stepping over rocks with ease.
screwing you when you can barely string a freaking sentence together. Another night.”
“You tell me, Dean,” John says lowly. “But you’re right. I don’t trust you anymore. Not since you started hanging around with that Castiel kid. Not since you started getting a smart mouth with me. You and Sam are staying right here where I can keep an eye on you both. End of story.”
strong. But no man is strong enough to save the world by himself.”
When he finally wakes, hours later, he feels unrested and shaky. Despite being shielded from the nightmares (Had that really been Dean? Or did he just imagine it?) Castiel had only slept for a couple of hours. The clock on the dresser reads 6:21 a.m. He gropes for his phone, his chest leaping to life when he sees a text message notification.
friend of Balthazar’s, Castiel would feel guilty saying ‘no.’ Balthazar had nothing outside of Castiel - nothing but endless bottles of whiskey and terrible daytime television.
Since I'm very, very nearly done with editing and revising this entire fic, I decided to post this chapter early. Yay! Thank you to everyone who's been following along so far - I've had so much fun writing this and I can't believe it's nearly over. As always, I will continue to update on Tuesdays.
“Place your fingers here,” Castiel says quietly. “Would you like to play that song you showed me? ‘Goodbye Stranger?”
isn’t in the tiny town disappearing into the rearview mirror behind them. Home is wherever they can make their own, surrounded by those who love them and accept them for who they are.
Dean suddenly appears very, very small. Castiel can only watch him in disbelief, wishing he knew what to say.
“Well...why wouldn’t she?” Dean laughs bitterly. The longing in his voice is unmistakable. “She gets to experience love. Joy. Anger. Sex. All the
“Dad’s gonna pay you?”
The other Castiel laughs. “Dean is right where he needs to be,” he says hoarsely.
“You’re sick.”
“You aren’t from this time,” he says hoarsely. “Are you?”
Castiel gapes at him. “Isn’t it obvious?” he whispers. How could Dean not know? After all the people he’s let down and failed to save? Not to mention that he’s slept with other men.
“Well,” he says. “Paint me crazy, but you might just be right, lady.”
“I may be getting a job,” he says slowly. Dean blinks at him in confusion.

Balthazar pokes his head into the kitchen. “Um, yeah, what

Behind him, Jo stands with her arms folded across her chest. Her bright, blonde hair is pulled back into a ponytail away from her eyes as she gives him a suspicious glare.
“You have to use your fingers first,” Castiel explains hesitantly as Dean fumbles to flip off the cap. “So that I won’t tear.
“S’that good?” Dean slurs. Castiel laughs weakly, playfully shoving him off his chest - it’s getting hard to breathe with his weight on top of his body, warm and pleasant as he is to have so close. Grumpy at the sudden loss of contact, Dean curls up beside him and pulls him close, nuzzling against the back of Castiel’s neck.
Dean nods. “Yeah, you and me both, buddy,” he says under his breath. “I’m sorry I can’t give you those answers.” His apology sounds entirely genuine, which surprises Castiel. “But truth is, God isn’t here. He skipped out and left all of us to clean up his messes. I’m one of the few who hung out around earth for a long, long time. Got to know the scene. Got to know...people. And I liked it. Maybe a little too much.” He glances at Castiel, quickly ducking his head. “But that doesn’t matter,” he adds quickly.
“N-never did that before,” Dean babbles. “Sorry.” Castiel sucks in a quick breath, feeling hot and tight against his jeans. Above him, Dean is a mess - his hair is standing up as sweat drips down his temples. Somehow, he’d managed to undo a few buttons of his own shirt. One of his suspenders is halfway down his arm. It makes Castiel want him in ways he’s almost afraid of. He wants to shove him against the inside of the car door and fuck him senseless - but he doesn’t. He hesitantly pulls his hand out of Dean’s boxers and wipes it against the seat.
He catches movement to his left. But his eyes never leave his brother’s wicked smile. The gun shakes in his hands and he can’t bring himself to shoot - not that regular bullets would do anything to a demon, anyway. But even if they could…
“I know you aren’t. What I’m telling you - “
Castiel nods. He gives Dean a miserable look as he climbs into the ambulance with the EMTs, leaving Dean alone outside. Finally, the EMTs slam the door and the ambulance screams down the street with Michael in close pursuit. Dean watches them go, feeling dizzy. He doesn’t understand what just happened, but something tells him that making the police call was the right move. He feels dizzy and disoriented. Everything had happened so fast, he didn’t get a look at Gabriel, and couldn’t tell what had happened to him as a result.
“Mmh sorry,” Castiel mumbles.
“He was a good man,” Dean murmurs. “I know he and I kinda...bickered. I wish we hadn’t.”
“Yeah, well, I ain’t perfect. And you still have a job to do. Your brother - “
“Fun night?” Baltazar asks with a quirk of his eyebrow. Castiel sighs.
Dean nods carefully. But before he can press further, Castiel changes the subject. Like he always does just when Dean is beginning to
“I understand it,” Dean says quietly. His green eyes are distant, miles away as they turn to look at Castiel with sorrow that surprises Castiel. “Trust me. All angels are my siblings...my brothers and sisters...but I had a brother who I was closest to. Samuel. He...he rebelled. Fell. And I have not seen him in many eons.”
This chapter is dark. There is nothing graphic, but be mindful of the tags, please - all of them. Endless thank yous to everyone who's been keeping up with this so far. <3
It’s a need. It’s a challenge and a distraction and a way to feel good and not have to think about Seals or other angels or his brother.
Castiel mumbles something about being tired when they walk home from school that day. With Sam at one of his after-school clubs, the two walk back alone. Dean grunts a quick hello to his father as the two of them climb the stairs. He’s aware of his father’s eyes watching them before Dean shuts the bedroom door behind them.
Castiel knows this all-too-well. He’d died nearly two years ago and Castiel had
Castiel feels a trickle of sweat drip down his temple. “Whiskey,” he croaks out. “Please.”
“Yeah,” he says finally. “You look it. How did, um, your job go last night?”
Castiel understands pain. He understands waiting. He understands its burning, hellish purpose. He understands what it is to be twisted and prodded and eaten and scorched.
“I, uh...I liked talking with you too,” he spits out. He feels his cheeks grow red. Castiel peers at him curiously.
Over time, Dean begins to learn more about his elusive friend. He knows that Castiel and his younger brother Gabriel are close. Gabriel, who could sometimes be seen with his tiny face pressed against the window, waiting for Castiel to come home after school. Castiel tells Dean that, sometimes, Gabriel will sit in Castiel’s bedroom and listen to him play the piano at night and fall asleep right on the floor.
Guns raised, the steely focus of the two hunters sets upon not a monster, but a man. Standing tall with narrow eyes and a leather jacket hanging loosely from a gray t-shirt, he walks with slow, steady purpose. Sharp cheekbones cut across his face. Wide, green eyes stare into Castiel’s own. As Castiel takes in his presence, he notices the man wearing ripped jeans and black, lace-up boots - possibly a demon. But the guns do little to phase him -- even with them raised in warning, he smirks and continues his slow tread across the dirt. Thunder crashes around them, the lights raving and thrashing in the dark as though in an attempt to flee from the man’s commanding presence. Castiel knows power when he sees it -- and though this person, this thing could easily just be another man in the wind, a hunter, even -- the power he exudes is raw and unfaltering.
well, but it doesn’t mean this still isn’t
“Lucifer,” he says quietly. “It’s me...it’s Castiel. I...look...there have been some...troubling things happening lately. But I’m alive. And I swear it’s really me, you can even ask Balthazar. I think...I think we might be in trouble. It’s big, Lucifer. It’s...bigger than anything we’ve ever faced before. Angels are walking the earth...real, Biblical angels. And...I fear that the coming of the end of days may be close. Our father...I think our father was right, Lucifer. Please...I know we’ve...had our differences in the past. But I need to know that you’re okay and I swear I’ll explain everything then. I need you — “
to forget about him...and even if he did, Dean isn’t so sure that he could. Castiel isn’t “queer” - and even if he was, what does it matter…? It can’t be that big of a deal, can it?
Castiel appears to choose his next words carefully.
He finally drags himself out of bed when it’s time to go to work. Like a ghost, Dean doesn’t feel present. He does what he’s supposed to do, fixing up the cars in the shop, listening obediently when his father explains a more difficult repair. He spends hours staring at cars, grateful for the distraction the job provides; the smell of the oil, the pleasant burn in his muscles, his father murmuring directions. And when he comes home with his father, covered in grease and dirt, he hates himself for wishing he could hear Castiel’s piano playing. A sign that Castiel is home from the hospital, that Gabriel is okay, that everything would be okay. That Dean made the right call. That he’d made the call in time.
Her eyes shine. Tortured laughter falls past her lips. He can’t tell if she’s breaking or simply enjoying this. But if that’s true, then —
A voice behind him makes Castiel jump. He turns, his stomach sinking at the sight before him. Behind Castiel is Dean — Michael. His appearance is vastly different from before - a brown suit covers his vessel where he’d once worn a leather jacket and ripped jeans. His hair is combed over neatly, and he stands stiff to attention with a blade in his fist.
“Nothing you would care to know,” he says under his breath. He brushes his fingers over the instruments on the table, settling for the medium-sized knife. He grips it tightly, watching his reflection glint across the blade. The flash of his own, pale face inside the metal sends a jolt down his spine. He forces himself to look, to keep eye contact with himself for a long, agonizing moment as he presses his lips tightly together.
as he can be, sometimes, I care about Dean, too. He never let heaven pressure him into doing what he didn’t think was right...at least, not for as long as I’ve been around. He raised me. He taught me everything I know. He made me strong. But now, he’s weak. He needs to be reminded how strong he is - just like you needed that reminder, too.”
His wings. The spell burned away his wings - and every other angel’s wings in heaven.
Dean blinks in surprise. "It's, uh...5:21?"
“I don’t care, Sam.”
“Dude, I don’t think you understand how I’m seeing you right now,” Dean breathes. “You uh, you know how you were supposed to be my vessel and everything? It’s like...I’m looking at you and that hasn’t changed, except I’m
“Tonight, you’re going to come with me,” he says after a moment. He unsheathes his knife from his belt and absently begins cleaning it off. “Now that the second trial is complete, I think I know where I can find the Devil. And my brother. We’re going to find him tonight and take his grace and end this once and for all. If I have to kill him and take it myself, I will.”
It gets him out of the house. It lets him breathe. It makes him feel stronger and more in control of his own body and mind. Dean joins him on the hunts, and he makes for an excellent partner. Even without his angel grace, Dean is an excellent fighter, and someone Castiel can trust to watch his back.
Somehow, Dean suspects Castiel wouldn’t be at school the next day after his late return home the night before. He doesn’t want to think about how he knows. But he knows. He doesn’t even bother to wait for him outside his house, much to Sam’s protest. The bruises, the way Castiel seems so
Dean feels his stomach twist into a knot. Castiel really doesn’t miss anything.
As Dean deepens the kiss between them, Castiel can feel the familiar stir of
“We don’t have much time,” he croaks. “Come on.”
“I need to go over there,” Dean breathes. Sam grabs his shoulder.
“I want you to stay. Forever, if you want.”
Be wary of the tags - you might recognize the episode "On the Head of a Pin" in this chapter.
Dean laughs softly, shaking his head. “You bastards can’t even let me enjoy my final moments of this, can you? I get it, okay? This is my happy place. This is my...retreat as you drill into my mind. And it’s all going away. I know - so get out of my head and do what you’re going to do already. Don’t make this harder than it has to be. I don’t want to imagine Cas seeing me like this.”
“I chose to live, Dean,” he says tiredly. “She gave me a choice...I could have honored it. I could have died, and trust me...I thought about it. But I came back.”
“I dunno. I was gonna go walk up to the school. See what it looks like.”
Castiel frowns but doesn’t say anything more. He pockets the newspaper and gets ready to leave.
“What is this?!” he demands. “What did you do? Where
gave that poor Lucifer a whole lifetime of anger issues and trauma. But no, he’s in heaven. Or, at least, that’s what I’ve heard, anyway. Kind of...funny how all that turns out, isn’t it?”
“Benny, I know, I swear I didn’t mean it — “
“It matters,” the other rasps. “It matters a lot.” Before Castiel can react, the other brings up the butt of the rifle and brings it down over his skull. A roaring pain erupts through the side of his head, and his legs immediately give out from underneath him. The last thing he sees is the tilt of the earth before his head hits the ground.
“I’m sorry,” Castiel huffs, still laughing under his breath. He hastily pulls his hand away, feeling ridiculous. “I think I drank too much. This is all...new to me.”
“You just shot an innocent man,” he rasps. The older Castiel gives him a low, knowing glare before looking around at the rest of the camp.
"I guess so. You gonna start more fights with dad that I'll have to break up?"
Castiel wants to look away. Rising guilt he hasn’t felt in years (
That’s what he keeps telling himself.
“He means
The Devil shakes his head, finally turning his head to look at the younger Castiel. On the floor, the older Castiel’s body finally stills, his eyes wide open and staring lifelessly at the barn ceiling.
He sleeps for almost five hours. Relief comes when nightmares don’t plague his sleep, allowing him to feel rested when he wakes. In the morning, he gets up, showers, and feeds himself a quick breakfast of yogurt and a granola bar from the bottom of his bag. And then, Castiel gets to work.
Dean and Castiel look at one another.
“What do you think?” Balthazar asks slowly.
Castiel’s face pales at the mention of the apocalypse. His fist clenches at his side as he tries to fight off a wave of nausea curling up through his stomach. “What sorts of things would she say?” he asks slowly.
feel about it.”
“Cas’,” he breathes. “The hell are you worrying about me for? You…”
I will try to update every Tuesday.
“Dean, I don’t understand.”
The woman sighs. She’s a stocky woman, her pinched face pulled into a tired, impatient grimace as she places her hands on her hips. A white lab coat hangs over her shoulders.
They’re no longer in the bathroom. A split second passes and Castiel is suddenly thrust onto a stool at an empty bar he’s never seen. White lights hang around the perimeter of the rustic room, lined with wooden tables and the smell of cheap whiskey. Similar to the Roadhouse where Ellen and Anna work, the place has seen better days with its faded, wooden walls and dusty lights. Nobody else is here - it’s only the two of them.
“If you expect me to believe that you aren’t anything more than a blind, thoughtless soldier carrying out cruel orders on a whim...you need to start acting like it. You would have still let that town burn had I given the ‘okay.’ You can think for yourself...so act like it. Otherwise, we cannot be allies.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah, yeah...see you tomorrow.”
Castiel groans quietly, but he manages a nod. Dean places a gentle hand on Castiel’s shoulder. All at once, the pain in his head fades, sucked away as quickly as he’d woken up to it. His thoughts feel sharper, more alert, and he’s able to push himself upright in bed with minimal pain. “Thank you,” he says quietly. “Um...in the future, you don’t need my consent to heal me. I appreciate the gesture, however.” They meet eyes and Castiel shivers. Dean always looks at him so
“No, Dean. I have not.”
After finding a hex bag behind the sofa in the man’s living room, Castiel was able to determine the cause of death as witchcraft. She’d been making her rounds across the town, killing another person in an equally gruesome way - another girl was boiled alive in a pool bobbing for apples. Hours later, Castiel stumbles back into his hotel room, sitting back against the bed and grabbing his laptop to look into the ritual, and for possible ways to stop the witch from killing again. Castiel glances over at the empty hotel bed beside his own, wishing again that his brother were here. He could pull up lore from sources Castiel had never heard of. This would take him more time than it would his younger brother, and he knows that more time meant more people could get hurt.
I think they make fun of me. And, as you’ve said before, Meg is scary. I don’t want to kiss her.”
“Then we need to make sure he doesn’t go free, Dean,” Castiel whispers. “But I can’t do it without you.”
Castiel nods solemnly, turning to watch his brother pluck a small dandelion from the wet grass. “You are as unhappy here as I am, Dean. Your happiness is important, too. Don’t you know that?”
“What, you’re telling me Death just let you live? No strings attached?”
“It’s too late for me.”
Castiel doesn’t know. But he does know that organizing the notes and research that Balthazar left behind would make him happy.
“You were going to kill this entire town
, and the decisions I make keep my people alive.”
But Lucifer stays utterly still. Refusing to leave without his brother, Castiel goes to grab his wrist as pieces of the ceiling begin to break away and fall only feet from them. Just as his hand closes over his brother’s arm, Lucifer raises his hand and flicks his fingers apart. An invisible blast hits Castiel square in the chest that seems to come right from Lucifer’s hand. He flies back with a loud yell of pain, sliding across the floor. Stars blink across his vision as he tries to understand what just
“Where’s your boyfriend, Dean-o?” he taunts. Arry kicks at Dean’s shins, ushering a pained growl from Dean’s throat. This may have been, no,
“Go make yourself useful and get the hell outside. I can’t stand hearing that out-of-tune piece of crap anymore than dad can.”
He turns to look at her again, taking a long, careful step closer to where she’s bound to the gate. Her eyes are set on his, shining and anticipating.
and that’s why I will not let you down, now. I won’t let you do this, Dean.”
Five minutes after that, a second car arrives. Then a third. Dean watches from the window as an argument ensues between the Novaks’ father and the older brother, Michael. A police officer has to force the two of them apart. Dean watches in disbelief as the father is handcuffed and pulled into the back of the police car. Castiel and Gabriel are nowhere to be seen.
“Right.”
Castiel shakes his head slowly. “You’re broken. This world broke you. We would never reduce ourselves down to what we - you - are doing now.”
And when Castiel sleeps, fitful and restless, he dreams he has a heart attack.
Benny nods quietly. Outside, the two can hear the buzz of the summer crickets in the grass. Dean swats away a few gnats, wiping a small bead of sweat from the side of his head as he folds his arms.
Dean doesn’t want to talk. He only wants to sleep. He shoves off his father’s questions, even when he grows angry, and shuffles off to his room. It’s still early in the day — not even five o’clock. But all he wants to do is sleep. He sleeps for hours in his clothes, only having the sense to take off his shoes before collapsing into bed. Eventually, when his alarm rings for school the next day, he ignores it and even ignores Sam’s pleas to get up and walk with him to school. He sleeps, wolfs down a bowl of cereal hours later, and when he can’t fall back asleep, Dean lays in bed. He stares at the ceiling numbly, aching for something that could never be put into words. When he closes his eyes, he sees Castiel’s haunted face; he sees Gabriel’s tiny body on the stretcher. He sees the empty, sunken eyes of their father and the bruises on Castiel’s face.
It’s something Dean would laugh at if it were anybody else doing it. But watching Castiel make music out of nothing but air transfixes him. He almost forgets to walk quietly as he sets his gaze on Castiel’s invisible performance. Dean can hear the soft, quiet noises of the night; the chirp of the crickets. An owl overhead. The occasional car in the distance. But here, now, Dean is sure he can hear the vivid color of music Castiel is painting in his mind.
Dean recognizes that tremor in Castiel’s voice. That test of bravery. The uncertainty in standing up for himself, as though this is the first time he ever dared to speak up against his own father. As their father draws closer, Dean can smell the alcohol radiating from his breath and skin - he was drunk behind the wheel and
Balthazar shakes his head. “Nope. I slept like a baby. What about you? You looked trashed. I’m a little pissed that your angel boy let you drive home like that. ‘Specially alone.”
He’d recently shaved, and no scars mark his face from where they’d been etched into his skin for as long as he can remember. If this “Dean” had truly raised him from hell, he had put Castiel back together, molecule by molecule. He had made him
The two stand in silence for a long moment.
Dean swallows. His first instinct is to look around the room for any unfriendly eyes, as though the touch of his friend is some sin to be reprimanded. But here, in Castiel’s bedroom, they’re entirely alone.
“Caring certainly hasn’t gotten me anywhere good.”
And then, at once, he remembers why he’s here.
“That could be...cool,” Sam says. “What do you think Dad would say about it?”
It makes Castiel feel a little bit more alive.
“Don’t thank me yet. I’m worried we might be too late.”
“It’s cool,” Dean assures him hesitantly. Really, he’s not offended - just concerned. He goes to place a hand on Castiel’s shoulder but quickly decides against it. “I just...you just seemed kinda off. That’s all.”
Breath on the back of his neck makes him whirl around, and suddenly, Naomi is less than a foot from him outside of the trap. His eyes catch a knick in the chalk. A droplet of water trickles to the floor, eroding a small spot of chalk away
Castiel has no idea. He doesn’t understand Dean or Dean’s motivations. He knows that he’s an angel - a high-commanding soldier in heaven. He knows that he has...odd mannerisms for an angel and enjoys drinking at bars. He knows that he’s powerful. Castiel drives on, chewing on his lower lip until he breaks the skin. With a thin trail of blood trickling into his mouth, he begins to pray.
"I'm fine. Are you?"
“That tone of voice
When Jo disappears, Castiel feels gentle hands clasp over his arms.
He tosses the newspaper to Castiel, letting him skim over the article before continuing.
“And you…?”
“Sure,” Dean grunts. He sits on his bed, pulling on a t-shirt.
surging through him, making his body feel weak and warm. He tries to twist his beaten face into a weak smile up at Dean - surely, he felt that, too.
Large chunks of asphalt are missing from the parking lot. What’s left is cracked, faded, and nearly unrecognizable. The cars in the lot are rusted away, most of them with windows so dirty Castiel can’t see through them. The break of dawn above him provides a low, hazy light, enough to allow him to see out beyond the lot and into the empty street.
Dean lowers his hand. Castiel misses the touch as soon as it leaves. He wants to grab him and kiss him
Instinctively, Castiel clutches at the pendant hanging dutifully around his throat. It’s a source of endless bullying for Castiel; he’s teased about it constantly, though the threats seemed to have died down when word got out that he’d drawn a knife on the three biggest bullies in school. The teasing never once seemed to prompt him to take it off. Dean doesn’t think he’s ever seen him without it on.
“Dean. This isn’t you,” he whispers, his voice raspy and dry with the pain ringing through his head. “You...you know me. You
“Yeah, well, if she bites your lips off when you try to make out with her, don’t say I didn’t warn you,” Dean huffs.
“Thank you.”
“Lucifer is alive,” Dean says slowly. Castiel whips his head around, baring his teeth at the angel in a white-hot fury. He clamors out of bed, stalking over to him before swinging his fist back and punching Dean square in the jaw.
It must have something to do with the Seals. With raising the Devil from his cage. Castiel shifts uncomfortably on the bed at the thought, wishing he could put it out of his mind. If Dean really had been telling the truth - and he can’t imagine why the angel would lie to him, now - then he has far, far bigger problems than a simple witch on a hunt.
“Garth. What are you doing here?” he says quietly, looking around hesitantly for any sign of other angels. As Castiel draws closer, he realizes Garth’s face is streaked with blood, his eyes as swollen as his lower lip. He’d been beaten - badly.
“So what, I’m supposed to just let him treat me like crap?” Sam demands. “That’s stupid, Dean, and you know it.”
They scramble to their feet and bolt for the road. Dean is faster than Castiel is and quickly pulls ahead of him, his long legs pumping furiously across the grass. He’s too slow, too slow, he wouldn’t make it. Oblivious, Gabriel wanders onto the sidewalk, headed straight for the path of the oncoming car.
Castiel stares at him. He can tell Balthazar has questions - but he’d explain later.
Castiel doesn’t dream clearly. In his loss of consciousness, he swims between strange, blurry colors and bursts of noise that make little sense even to him. He thinks he sees Lucifer’s face mingled with Dean’s. It isn’t until some time passes, the colors fading and blurring and swirling together. He hears a scream, one he’d never forget - the scream of one of his father’s wives dying as Lucifer drove the blade of a knife straight through her stomach, killing both her and her unborn child. But then the dream ends, like it’s being shoved back by hands Castiel can’t see.
“What’s so funny?”
if this is okay - that he isn’t messing
hot. We kissed a few times. And there was another girl when I was in seventh grade…”
Castiel doesn’t know when he and Dean decided that Dean would be living with him - sleeping on Balthazar’s bed, mostly. Researching hunts, helping Castiel organize Balthazar’s numerous books and notes. Throwing away old liquor bottles, little by little. Fixing the leak in the bathroom faucet upstairs. Sometimes, he’ll leave to investigate a hunt and come back with another creature’s blood on his hands. Castiel will help him wash it off and then go to bed.
“I love you, Jo,” Castiel hears Dean say quietly. He still doesn’t look at them. He lifts his head and watches the trees in the distance, sturdy and solid and unmoving. Unaffected by the loss Castiel would feel for the rest of his life.
But Lucifer still wouldn’t answer his call. And anyway, Castiel doesn’t want to sleep again. He doubts that Dean would come into his head again to pull him away from another, horrifying nightmare like he had the night before. Cryptic and strange as Dean is, Castiel finds himself fascinated by him and what he’s able to do. An angel of the Lord. Meeting an angel seems like a fate reserved for those living in Biblical times. Then again, Castiel thinks, that might just be his reality now.
Castiel wipes a hand down his face, already exasperated. This isn’t how he wanted to spend his night. At all.
” Castiel begs him. “I know you. I
“Dean --”
“I...question things. I have doubts. I am not the obedient soldier I once was… Sometimes I think that heaven’s plan is...well, that it’s shit,” he says bluntly. Castiel snorts, shaking his head with quiet, bitter laughter, amazed he’s able to laugh at all. Dean shoots him a look with a raised eyebrow.
but no part of Dean is trying to
“S’it okay if I stay at the house for a bit?” Dean asks hesitantly. “I’ll go as soon as I get this whole human thing figured out and —”
“The whims of heaven are my own. But it doesn't mean I am not bound by them.”
Dean tilts his head. For a second, Castiel swears he looks
Dean stares at his brother in disbelief. "Sam, c’mon…"
Mortified, Castiel groans as he slowly comes back to his senses. He forces his aching limbs to move and scrambles to his feet like a startled cat. In his haste to get up, he slips on the wet grass, nearly losing his balance for the second time. A hand catches his arm. He blinks as he finds himself staring into the wide eyes of the older boy; Dean. A ways back, his younger brother and father watch curiously.
Give it a rest,” Dean snaps. “I did what I did. We’re all alive. End of freaking story.”
Castiel doesn’t ask him what he means. And he doesn’t think he wants to find out. Without another word, he pulls the thin blankets up over himself and kicks off his shoes as the other settles on the couch across the room. Hours later, just when he’s sure he can hear the birds chattering amidst the trees, he falls into a fitful sleep.
I will try to update every Tuesday!
“You shouldn’t,” she agrees. “You’re human, now. Let me take care of this - you and Castiel need to...well, I’ll let you decide that, yeah?”
“What made you decide to come back?”
His stomach rolls as he shoves the image aside, trying to ground himself in the work of the present. Castiel lowers a steady hand to close her eyes, fighting the urge to clear the matted blood from her dark hair. Behind him, Balthazar scours for EMF, hearing the machine whirr and whine before fading into a soft treble of noise.
“That seems like a gross job.”
, Castiel,” Benny laughs darkly. He kicks him down, and Castiel is sure he hears a rib snap. He looks up at him helplessly, wide eyes pleading with him as he tries to reach for him. Benny knocks his hand away carelessly.
like he’s trying to stare straight through him.
“No, it’s fine.” Dean turns to Castiel. “We can trust him,” he says. “He’s a friend. He’s helping me hide Jo.”
“Hey, assholes,” Dean snarls. He grabs Az and drags him away from Benny in a display of strength that surprises even himself. “Leave the guy alone.”
that day. I saw it. The billowing, black cloud of smoke...the laughter...and it burned our entire house down to the ground. Everything...everyone...up in smoke. And then we came to you, walked along the road for hours. And you got us away from that place.”
“Cas’, wait!” he calls out hoarsely. “Cas’ — “
He holds out his hand. With wide, disbelieving eyes, Dean takes it. Before them, the water is swelling, rising into a massive, black tidal wave that would quickly and easily consume them both. It rises and crests and Castiel can smell the brine as it rises to swallow them both.
“What are you gonna do all day?”
Castiel doesn’t say anything. He stares up at the ceiling, feeling numb. He wants to go back to sleep, to let the gentle embrace of the dark and the senseless colors of his unconsciousness.
Shaking off the thought, Castiel climbs out of the water, looking at them both sadly as they continue to laugh. Smiling, his mother walks over to him and takes his face between her gentle hands.
Castiel sighs. “I’m sorry.”
Jerking back, Castiel covers his mouth with his hand as he watches James’ body collapse lifelessly to the ground. Abandoning caution, he surges from his hiding place, hearing a series of gasps erupt from the rest of the camp as they catch sight of the nearly-identical men.
“I’ll see you tomorrow, Dean,” Castiel says seriously. Dean nods. He usually leaves later than this, but Dean doesn’t press.
“Angel,” Castiel breathes. He shakes his head quickly as memories of the day before flood through his mind all at once. “
He prays to Dean with no answer - not that Castiel expects one, anyway. If Jo is to be believed, Dean’s mind is set on what he thinks he has to do: return to his factory settings. Wipe away every part of him that is too human to be a proper soldier, all so that he can end the world in a crazed quest to find the Devil - if the Devil gets out of his Cage in the first place, which is looking more and more likely now that Lucifer is out of Castiel’s reach.
“I think the queer boy’s bluffing,” one of them taunts. Dean jerks forward, every nerve in his body surging to protect Castiel, but Benny pulls him back with strong hands on his arms.
Dean brushes his hand down the bandage with a quiet sigh.
“Hey, no, they’ll kill you,” Benny warns. Dean shakes his head as the boy’s close in on Castiel.
“Your bed is quite comfortable,” he remarks. But he doesn’t lay down. He sits on the edge, his eyes watching Dean curiously. Dean looks away and shrugs. He’s suddenly worried Castiel could read his mind and figure out that Dean had followed him last night.
Dean raises his eyebrows, giving Castiel a wide smile. Honestly, if that’s all that’s been on his mind, Dean is relieved.
The two lay back on the bed in silence, listening to the sound of the piano until it comes to a quiet close. It’s a song Dean doesn’t recognize; dips in the chords he doesn’t recognize, a melody lost to his ears. He drifts off to sleep quickly that night, and in his dreams, he sees himself watching a stranger play the piano; a stranger he knows better than the back of his hand. Guilt still rests heavy in his stomach from his argument with Sam. He doesn’t like his father’s behavior any more than Sam does -- but the difference between them is that Dean knows how to deal with it.
When Dean looks at him again, Castiel is laying down with his head on the pillow, his eyes shut as he adjusts his body to a comfortable position. Idly, Castiel pulls the covers up to his shoulders. Curled up on the bed, Dean can’t help but smile. His friend looks peaceful like this. Almost childlike. It’s barely a few minutes before he hears the sounds of his friend’s gentle, easy breathing, signaling he’d fallen asleep. When he’s sure Castiel won’t wake up again, Dean lounges against the side of the bed, close enough to feel the boy’s light breathing dust across his hair. Dean feels at peace. Content, even. His own, confusing thoughts nothing but a lingering trickle in his mind
“Okay.”
“What was that back there?” Castiel demands. “Why did I see — see
Peering behind them, Garth pauses to look around, before pointing towards a large clearing of large boulders about twenty yards away.
But he doesn’t dare be so selfish. Not now. God, he
“No,” Dean says lowly. “Garth.” The bartender’s eyes flash a brilliant white before fading back into their old brown. Castiel feels a lump gather in his stomach as Garth gives Castiel a soft smile. “Your cloaking worked well,” Dean says. “Didn’t even catch you behind that bar.”
“Heaven is in chaos,” she gasps. “A whole battalion of angels is just...is gone. I was able to escape when the angels started going haywire upstairs. Did Samuel…?”
Sam looks up from his homework unexpectedly. With a blink of surprise, his face splits into a wide grin. Forgetting his work, Sam shoves his notebook aside on his bed.
Their movements are coordinated, quick, and learned. A job well-practiced. Castiel is transfixed as he watches them, a lonely, perverted onlooker in the night. He feels ashamed like he’s spying on something he has no right to be looking upon. Slowly, the man moves his hands to box Castiel’s ribs, his lips pressing firmly against the base of his throat, down his chest, down to his stomach, past his hip bones. With Castiel’s legs propped upright, his thigh conceals the man’s face as he dips his head between his legs, bobbing up and down as Castiel grabs the other’s hair, his free hand fisting through the sheets in the low lamplight. This man looks like Dean. Dean, the angel who isn’t
Castiel shudders, briefly remembering his other self swallowing a handful of pills he’d pulled from his pocket. Surely he wouldn’t steal from the camp’s supplies…
It feels so scary.
to be brought up now. “What...so I’m just supposed to be some kid forever?” he asks quietly. “You don’t trust me, so I just stay here until you decide that you can?”
But now it’s cold. It’s cold all the time. It bites into Dean’s skin when he’s working at his father’s car garage, his fingers quickly growing numb when not directly preoccupied with work. Even still, the long, chilly hours are a blissful distraction for Dean, even if it means he spends less time with Castiel. He likes working with his hands. He’s
Castiel feels a weak noise escape his throat. The other is stoic, his expression completely unreadable as he stares out the window with his hand wrapped around the handle of his gun.
“The mess that I caused,” Dean says bitterly.
There’s a moment before Dean speaks again. A tense, taut silence hangs suspended between them like a rubber band pulled just before its breaking point. Despite them coming from his own mouth, the words hurt Castiel as much as he
“You have to be the sword,” Dean says at last. “The weapon heaven can use to stop the apocalypse in its tracks. You have to stop your brother from raising the Devil at any cost. You have to be a vessel for the devil’s closest brother.”
Laughter from behind him is the only warning he has before a pair of hands push him into the water, sending a cold rush through his body. The pond isn’t deep - at its deepest point, it only goes up to his hips. But it’s enough to soak him straight through his clothes. He gasps, sputtering as Lucifer grins above him, laughing too hard to even keep himself standing upright. Castiel gapes at him until he finds that he’s laughing, too.
. What exactly do you think you can threaten me with? My life? My sanity? Another eternity in hell? What could you
“We can’t afford to bring someone in to tune it,” Castiel murmurs. “But it still makes beautiful music, even when slightly run down. Most people do not appreciate a musical instrument that doesn’t perform its job exactly as it should...but it’s still capable of creating something beautiful.”
“Benny,” Castiel groans. A trickle of blood pours down his chin where his teeth split his tongue. The pain makes him dizzy, but he hardly registers it now. “Benny,
Castiel glares at the man -- the creature. Whatever he is. Something far, far more unearthly, far more powerful than anything Castiel has ever seen. He shoves past him, dropping to Balthazar’s side to place his ear against his chest. The slow beat of life pushes in Balthazar’s chest;
Castiel shakes his head. “He’s the Devil. He wouldn’t just...give up his grace. He wouldn’t
when Dean got a little bit too close. She was only discharged from the hospital a couple of days ago.
You're the wayward angel that stormed down to hell. You uprooted my plans."
"Just leave me alone," Sam whispers hoarsely. "I'm going to bed."
He gestures for Robert to follow him. As Robert shoulders past Castiel, he gives him a dirty look. “Don’t screw this up,” he snaps. Castiel shivers as they leave the room. He wants to snidely ask Dean if he wants to stay and watch - maybe he could learn a thing or two. But he doesn’t. It feels cruel, and Castiel finds it horrendously funny that he’s afraid now, of all times, of being cruel.
if you’ll mind the near-blasphemous comparison I just made between my home and your weird, ground-up cows.”
Where those words may have made Dean numb long ago, he smiles at them now. It doesn’t have to make sense, does it? And since when has anything about Castiel ever made sense? Dean has never wanted Castiel to be predictable - God knows he’s never been before. Even still, the words echo soft and still in Dean’s ears, flooding him with a tirade of warmth.
“Yup. Yeah. Okay. Quick problem with that.”
“I just worry about you, y’know? Ever since your mom died and we lost our old house, things have been hard. For you, for Sammy, for me...I just don’t want to see you get hurt, Dean. Not like this. That’s all. You can find better friends than that kid. Just ‘cause he’s next door don’t mean you need to hang around him all the time.”
“Because he’s getting hurt as we speak. His dad — his dad’s some freaking psychopath. I’ve known it for so long, but...I never did a damn thing, Sam. He keeps getting hurt because I won’t do anything.”
leading the charge. He doesn’t care about the world anymore and he doesn’t care about
“I’ll come,” Castiel murmurs. These hunters are the only friends Balthazar has left. Castiel is in no mood to hunt, but he owes Balthazar that much. Touching the pendant of the cross around his neck, Castiel hurries to grab his things.
“Thank you,” he breathes. “You saved me. I...I almost killed you.”
at working with his hands. In John’s rare moments of letting his gruff exterior come down a notch, Dean’s father even remarks that he might be better than his old man, someday. With the steady business of the garage providing a small but comfortable income for the family of three, John has no qualms talking to Dean like he would be taking over the garage when John is too old to work it himself anymore.
“But I’m not talking to Dad about it, Dean. He’d just lose his shit on me like he always does.”
Castiel laughs weakly, feeling happier than he ever has in his life. This was a
“You killed me,” Benny rasps. “You killed me. You killed me, you killed me, and maybe if you’d have kept it in your goddamn
Unable to believe what he’s seeing, Castiel watches as the dancer steps up onto the stage and begins circling his hips to the rhythm of the music. The song from before ended, shifting into something lower and more sensual that Castiel doesn’t recognize. The beat is fast enough for the man to hook a leg around the pole and spin with a grace that startles Castiel - and Dean, by the looks of it. Dean’s grin is wide and if Castiel didn’t know any better,
“I see you had fun,” Castiel murmurs. The corner of his mouth twitches into a smile. Dean laughs and Castiel can’t help but laugh along with him.
Freedom, so I can give
But, the giddy, nervous jitter in his limbs fades as quickly as it had come. Dean can hear the noise before he even reaches his own yard; yelling, the sounds of an inconsolable fight, coming from the house -
Castiel presses his lips together. “I’m sorry.”
Castiel presses his lips together in a tight line before he answers. “I met him on a hunt. Vampires were chasing me, and I had a chance to get the jump on them. I had stopped at a bar after driving for hours and he asked me where I’d come from. We got talking…”
“Well, it’s nice to meet you too, Castiel. You know, I usually don’t do this but...I just wanted to say that it isn’t bad to have fun here. When I used to dance, a lot of clients felt guilty about what they saw and what they wanted. Mostly the men. You aren’t hurting anybody by letting yourself have fun. And the guys here are super nice...they like making people feel good. Just remember that, okay?” Castiel looks at him with a weak nod. His words seem to settle under Castiel’s skin, making him feel antsy and on-edge. Maybe he’s right. Maybe he isn’t. Castiel doesn’t know, but he does know that he’s sick of being afraid.
“Dunno. You should go find out.”
“Really rough,” Balthazar emphasizes with a huff. “But...hell, I’m glad you’re home.”
“Over the years, my father married multiple women and they would sometimes take care of Lucifer and me. Or, they would try to. As Lucifer got older, he quickly decided that he wasn’t having any of it. He didn’t like the way they spoke down to him or the way that they seemed to be a replacement for our real mother. He would hit them, fight back when they tried to hit him. He drew blood. Over time, they refused to touch him or feed him and that job fell onto me. We were close for a little while as my father grew more and more...insane. He would spend hours writing and writing these strange stories, convinced that demons were living inside his head, whispering to him. Knowing what I know now about actual demons...I don’t think what he was hearing was real. But I’m not sure. I tried to make sense of his writing, but most of it was entirely illegible. Much like our mother, he grew more and more closed off, and some days we would not see him at all. My father would lock himself away in his study...wouldn’t eat...wouldn’t answer the door for days on end.”
True to Castiel’s suspicion, Lucifer doesn’t want to be found. Castiel can’t trace his phone, nor can he trace any bank statement activity in the past month. He’s always been good at covering his tracks. A quiet prowler, a lone wolf in the night; if Lucifer does not want to be found, he simply will not be found.
When Castiel looks up at Balthazar again, his face is completely pale. He’s silent for a long, long moment as Castiel swallows the rest of his drink in two heavy gulps.
Castiel thinks deliriously.
Dean shakes his head. At once, Castiel understands. Everything he wants to say can’t be said here. Not now.
“I want to talk to him.”
Castiel thinks dryly to himself
to my Father that you would find a way to neutralize your brother without needing to kill him. You made the same damn choice I would have made if it was one of my own brothers out there.”
him all of this, angel or not. “If this is a Seal as you say, then he fits that pattern. Why did you need to know all of that?”
Castiel finally looks away, draining the last few drops of whiskey from the glass. It tingles on his tongue. For a long, long moment, he stares into the empty glass, trying to reign in the responses of his body without making too much of a fool of himself.
Balthazar shakes his head. “You know how he gets. These past five months have been rough, Castiel. For both of us.”
Dean kicks him, sending Jo into a fit of laughter.
Benny disappears in a puff of smoke as quickly as he’d come before he can finish what he was going to say. Dazed, Castiel tries to stand, but a stabbing pain shoots through his ribs, sending him staggering back down onto the bathroom floor all over again. Before he can utter a sound, a blurry figure approaches him, and Castiel prepares for another onslaught. Maybe one that would kill him for good, this time. But instead, a hand reaches down and gently touches his face. His pain fades in a matter of seconds, and all at once, he feels brand new. His vision swarms into focus as a familiar face appears above him, looking at him with a pinched curiosity.
Dean strikes him across the face with the handle of the blade, causing Castiel to bite down on his lower lip. He coughs and sputters and blood spurts from the wound. Pain rocks through him, making his vision blur. But he hardly feels it.
“He will,” Dean says quietly. He shifts his weight between his feet on the grass, shoving his hands into his jean pockets as they watch Gabriel gather more flowers.
Castiel winces. “I’m sorry.”
“And we’ll find Castiel?”
“That’s good,” she says with a huff. “Because I’m going to have to kill you.”
Together, the three sit in a circle, warm candles lit before each of them. The room is dark save for the small flames, and Castiel shivers in the low light. Pamela rests a warm hand on the handprint scar on Castiel’s shoulder and the touch makes those live wires tingle underneath his skin all over again. The burn-not-burn. He shivers involuntarily, and Balthazar opens one eye to look at him.
The fire had taken everything from them; their home. Most of their possessions. Their mother. Jumping from apartment to apartment, from hotel to hotel when their father couldn't hold down a job. And now they've ended up here: Lawrence, Kansas. The single most boring town on Planet Earth. Dean tries to relax as he pulls the covers up to his chin.
“I don’t care why you were sent here.” Dean shakes his head, glancing at the Angel Tablet on the ground. He picks up the older Castiel’s still body and pushes past the other and outside the barn doors, kneeling in the tall grass as he casts his head towards the sky. His shoulders shake as he holds Castiel close.
“I wasn’t planning on making out with her, Dean. Can we play your Supertramp album again?”
Dean recoils, as though struck. He feels his mouth hang open as the jarring memory of Gabriel Novak on the large, hospital stretcher floods his vision. His chest feels tight, his lungs unresponsive as his whole body trembles. When Dean goes to speak again, his voice is a raspy whisper.
“I’m sorry, Castiel.”
Even now, he can’t say it. He can’t bring light to the suffering he knows that Castiel endures. He can’t acknowledge it, no matter how desperately he wants to. How desperately he has to. Castile deserves that much, he deserves to know that Dean sees his pain so clearly. That he can endure Castiel’s pain with him if he must.
and dragging him to someplace that’s so sexually charged that most angels wouldn’t dare walk inside, isn’t turning Castiel’s brain into a useless pile of half-formed thoughts.
. Dean lets his arms hang stiffly at his sides.
“What if we do leave?” Dean asks again, softer this time. John stops, still not looking at him. For a long moment, he doesn’t speak at all.
“I believe there is a God,” Castiel says slowly. “Angels are a story.”
all of Dean, and he knows he’ll never want anybody or anything else but him.
Movement in his rearview mirror nearly makes him crash the car. He curses under his breath as he swerves involuntarily, cringing at the blare of the horns from the incoming traffic he very nearly drove into. Dean is suddenly sitting in the backseat - at the very spot they had been the night before with Castiel’s lips pressed against his throat and his hand around his dick - chewing casually on a burger from some joint across town.
him to hit him, even though he’d have nothing to defend himself with.
He snaps his head up to meet her eyes, gray and steely as the suit around her body. Her expression is calm, a hint of a smirk dusting her lips. Castiel has to catch himself before he sways on his feet.
She said that he needs perspective. Whatever that means, Castiel has no intention of finding out. Giving the room another, uneasy glance, he grabs his bag and hurries out of the room, eager to put as much distance between himself and this place as possible.
“Oh, sweet. Where’s the place?”
Dean sighs, glancing at Castiel. Still silent.
” his father would rasp, eyes hollow and bloodshot from days with little to no sleep.
Jodi’s voice jolts the three boys to attention; Dean hadn’t realized they were passing her house. She stands at the edge of her yard, her mail in-hand, giving her a full eyeful of Dean’s bloody face. Her kind eyes are wide with worry. They look at once another without speaking before Jodi shakes her head.
“Freedom,
“Anyway,” Dean says quickly. “I didn’t plop into your car to talk about food. I need your help.”
Sam shakes his head. “Dean...I don’t think there’s anything you can do.”
Bending down, Dean draws his tongue slowly over the head of Castiel’s cock, and Castiel grabs Dean’s hair instinctively to keep him going.
He will be a new prince of hell. Forever he will reign, on earth and in heaven above, and all it took — “
Dean gapes as he watches the boy run.
Or so content.
“Um...I don’t know, Dean. Do as you wish.”
Castiel nods. He seems to understand where Dean is coming from, though the puzzled expression never leaves his face.
Castiel watches him in disbelief. “My
“Me too.” They grin at each other for a long moment. Maybe it’s the whiskey, or maybe it’s just Alfie’s words of reassurance, but Castiel already feels better. Lighter, somehow. Less tense. He watches as the knot in his stomach begins to unwind, drinking in the sight of him with slightly ruffled clothes, flushed cheeks, and a noticeable bulge in his pants that Castiel quickly looks away from.
Castiel grabs the notebook, pockets it in his bag, and hurries back outside and into his car.
He can’t cry out. Can’t make a single sound, no matter how badly he tries. Down, down, down he falls into the deep, drowning, reaching for something that isn’t there.
Castiel bares his teeth. Pure, white hatred bubbles in his stomach as Naomi chokes out a laugh. He doesn’t want to
“You can stop talking,” Castiel says lowly. “Unless it’s to tell me what I want.”
“I tried to keep your nightmares out,” a voice says. Castiel’s head hurts. He tries to push himself upright, but a pair of hands gently lower him back onto the bed.
“Bloody hell, Cas,” Balthazar murmurs. He doesn’t say anything else as he gingerly wipes the trickle of blood trailing down his lip. Castiel kicks aside a piece of broken glass, rubbing his head as his vision slowly begins to focus again.
A sense of urgency floods his veins. He’s done hiding. He can’t do this anymore, and he doesn't want to. He won’t.
