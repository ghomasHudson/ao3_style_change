Gabriel shot Sam a grin. It was as if they could read each other’s minds.
I think I won today. If you decide that you want to surrender the seat to me, Sunshine, I would do it now.
Castiel sighed. He knew they were going to ask...
Dean looked in his direction, his shamrock green eyes staring blankly. “You obviously can’t get back to your apartment yourself. Can I take you home?”
“I haven't ‘seen’ anything in fifteen years!”
Castiel shrugged. “My brother works here, remember? I can come in as early as I want to.”
Cas whipped around, eyes wide. “Sam?”
“First, I wanna apologize.”
He sighed, rolling his eyes. “Fine.”
Dean couldnt help but wonder how blue they were. As blue as the sea? Sky? Or were they pale, like ice? Were they dark, like a midnight blue?
Today, he would be waiting in the restaurant... With Dean.
“What are you doing, Cassie?”
He shrugged. “Not a lot of people on the plane. Taking a red-eye is NOT fun.”
Hopefully, Castiel already knew how to lead a blind person.
“Perfect. Stay like that.”
Hey! I hope you are all having an incredible Tuesday (Sam isn’t. He just wants it to be Wednesday already)!
Wait—why is Castiel standing?
“How are you, Dean?”
But he wasn’t happy. Not anymore.
Castiel shifted uncomfortably. “Dean... you don’t want to be seen with me.”
The hours slipped away, but neither seemed to notice. They were focused on the task at hand. Castiel would ask about the story behind every photo, and Dean would happily oblige in telling him.
But what if something else happens?
Dean laughed. “No, Cas. It’s just an expression! Are you okay, ‘chill’, with going to the family brunch?”
“No. Eleven forty-three.”
“Thank you for.... everything, Cas.”
Dean came back out from the kitchen, placing down two coffee mugs in front of Sam and Gabriel. He offered them a quick smile before disappearing again. About ten seconds later and he comes back with another mug. Castiel smiled, knowing what drink was inside.
Ever since he had yelled at Cas, Dean struggled sleeping. Without the drug, it would take hours for him to get tired. When he (eventually) dozed off, he would have nightmares.
“Oooohhhhhh!!! Cute”
“Come on, we’ll be late to the airport.”
The last words rung in Castiel’s ears. “Today is the anniversary of when he lost his sight.”
At first the man ignored him, either staring out the window or typing away on his computer. About ten minutes later and the man turns around. “Will you STOP staring at me???” He snapped, eyes glowering at him. Dean smirked, not allowing the man the satisfaction of peace.
The model faces the camera. Okay... everything’s fine. This will be good!
It was obvious they liked each other.
He’s screwed.
“Look, I know you told me to go chase my dream and pursue modeling, and I tried. I really tried, but I can’t do it... not without telling you something first.”
Sam’s ears turned a violent red and he adverted his gaze from the coffee shop owner. Dean smiled at his brother’s distress, taking a sip from his coffee. He would never let him live this down!
“Go get em’, tigger!”
Dean gave him a half smile, trying to ignore his cheeks burning. “Okay, cool.”
Castiel tilted his head. “Talk about what?”
So there they sat, in a very crowded jacuzzi.
Dean rose an eyebrow, frowning at the Gabriel. He loved the guy, but often had to fight the urge to strangle him. Instead of killing his friend, he offered a tiny smile. “Can I get my usual? Maybe add a slice of pie into the mix?”
I promise that the next one is longer! It will be the chapter that Dean and Castiel fly to Sioux Falls!
Castiel grabbed a pair of headphones the second he entered his apartment. The world caved in around him as he listened to the playlist.
Castiel was silent for a moment, but he didn’t seem to take notice in Dean’s strange choice in words. “I was wondering if you needed company on your walk to the bar? I have a photo shoot later tonight, so I’m free this morning.”
Fifteen minutes of walking and lighter conversation passed by when the model caught eye of the library.
There was a groan to the side of him, groggy and deep. “Dean?”
The bartender felt a sweltering heat moving through his body. He wanted to sit down with Castiel and talk with him. The man seemed so... hurt. Dean hesitated, contemplating what he should do. Dean was also pretty drunk, and he feared of what could happen if he were to stay. He could easily imagine pressing Castiel’s lips with his own, cupping his jaw and moving his calloused thumb over his cheek. Castiel would then bite Dean’s bottom lip. He would part his mouth, allowing Castiel to slip his tongue inside.
“This is magnificent, Cassie! When did you learn how to do this?”
A low, deep voice responded, winded. “Both?”
No response.
The man smiled warmly at him. “Just call me Bobby. It’s obvious that Dean considers you important. Anyone who’s a... friend... of Dean is a friend of mine.”
Dean chuckled, shoving his brother’s suitcase into the trunk. “You tired?”
He bent over to pull out a tiny pot out from under the stove. Castiel got a great view of Dean’s ass.
Gabriel giggled. “It does!”
The model stood in the backyard, mingling with Dean’s family.
Rowena rolled her eyes, choosing to ignore Meg’s outburst.
Cas felt his entire being freeze up.
Until now.
Castiel’s heart thumped against his ribcage, as if it were trying to escape his body.
Castiel balled it in the taxi. Never before had he remembered crying this much. He buried his face in Rowena’s neck, sobbing uncontrollably.
He jumped back into the conversation, looking down at the pictures of clothing that he could wear.
A low voice, like the rumbling of a thunderstorm. It was firm and insistent, but not directed towards him.
The bartender’s heart still raced.
The moment Castiel left the bar, Sam and Gabriel cheered.
Castiel chuckled, unaware of Dean’s unease. “Then there’s a boy, around four. He has a lopsided grin on his face, and he has really bright green eyes—like yours. That’s you.”
“Holy shit!”
Dean could feel a light brush against his lips, barely there.
And that’s all Dean could ask for his younger brother.
He slipped back under the covers, muscles loosening. Castiel did the same.
His eyes then drifted to the sofa. It was terrifyingly minuscule, and would be too cramped for someone to sleep on.
Dean bowed his head. “Sorry. Guess I never thought my little brother would get married... well, like, you know. I thought I would be prepared for it—
“Dark brown. His hair is a messy short... I don't know how to describe it”
Castiel hummed.
“How did you lose your sight?”
Dean barley contained his scream of frustration. “I don’t have anyone to bring!”
The man had a tiny smile on his face, and his eyebrow was slightly raised. He wore a tight black T-shirt and green jacket. His hiking boots gave him a couple more inches of height.
He. Was. Going. To. Be. Slow. Dancing. With. Cas!!!!!
“Oh.... hey, boy. Did anyone tell you about.... you know?”
(Three hours later)
Meg cackled like a witch, throwing her head back with a wicked force. It was like she was being possessed by a demon.
He then spotted a restaurant at the corner of the street. perfect! He could escape the fan girls AND eat.
He had memorized Bobby’s place last time he was there. He knew that he wouldn’t want someone leading him everywhere...
He moved in with Dean the same day he saw him. The hunter asked him to stay for dinner, and he couldn’t refuse.
But there was no way... right?
“Yeah, the really handsome man in the corner. Woah, he’s gorgeous! His jaw line looks hard enough to cut glass...”
Mental stability?
Sam and Gabriel arrived while Bobby was showing Cas the backyard.
The man chuckled. “With that pretty face? No cost.”
Does anyone else remember that episode?
Sam blinked slowly, trying to process his brother’s words. “Excuse me, what???”
This was going to be a long night...
Castiel nodded, looking at Dean with a critic’s eye. He could easily pass up as a model.
Sam groaned, giving his fiancé his infamous bitch face. “This is why you ran all the way here??? You’re pathetic!”
“Oh God, I— I am so sorry”
“Benny! Uh— remember Sam and Gabe’s wedding? It’s coming up in six weeks?”
“The show is hosted in Paris, and the I could be gone for... a long time.”
“Hello, Dean. Do you want to come in?”
“Hey, brother! How’s it hanging?”
Over the summer, Dean had learned to let go. He, for the first time, was able to forget about his fucked up world.
Castiel knew he should have been panicked. He should wake Dean, or at least try and escape the situation.
The model sighed, his voice low. “I don't think I should go.”
“I’m bored! Let’s dance before I go stir crazy!!!”
Dean nodded, fidgeting with his hands. “Look, I’m no stranger to drinking. Hell, I’m a bartender! I deal with it every day. But I also used to know a person who had an... addiction to the stuff.”
“Cassie?”
A man entered the bar around ten at night, strutting around like he owned the place.
The woman continued. “He’s in New York City, working a job.”
The jacket was warm, the inside lined with fleece and outside with cotton. It was the perfect size, as if it had been custom made for him. The faint aroma of honey and mint lingered on it.
To his surprise, Jo, Charlie, and her girlfriend, Gilda, we’re already there.
Meg rolled her eyes. “I’ll drop by the bar and check on him while you’re gone.”
Dean felt his chest tighten. He forced himself to look away, rubbing the back of his neck in embarrassment. What the hell was he thinking?
“No. And John is a forbidden subject all together— he didn't tell you about him, did he???”
Before Dean could defend himself, Bobby and Castiel barged in.
The other dancers took notice of the charming pair. Everyone slowed to a stop and watched. There was no sound of chatter or conversation. It was as if time had stopped for them.
The bartender moved to the side, giving Castiel room to enter.
Castiel refrained from rushing over. He walked slowly, preparing himself for rejection.
“How come?”
So, way off topic but I LOVED when you all answered my weather question! In order to continue that, I wanted to ask another fun question. Don’t feel too pressured to respond, it’s just fun thing to think about! :)
Sam watched in disbelief as Castiel walked up to Dean and spoke. His brother’s face went a deep shade of red, and he held out his hand for the other man to take.
Sam rushed over, stopping inches from his brother. “Dean!!!”
Like this is what he should what been doing his whole life. Spending each morning with Cas, talking together, walking to work, binge watching ‘NotNatural’ together—
“So you’re Claire, huh?”
“Uh—would you... you like to dance?”
“How about you?”
Castiel chuckled. “Aren’t you supposed to buy me a drink before taking me home? That’s usually how these things work...”
Dean moved to the left side of the bed, patting the spot next to him.
What if Castiel just sees Dean as a friend?
“Hung himself a few years after Dean’s accident. On the day of. He couldn't handle all the loss.”
Charlie rolled her eyes. “Let’s get you home. You look like hell—er—no offense.”
Kevin continued. “Castiel has been on trending for the whole week. In my opinion, the model isn’t going anywhere any time soon. I believe that he will be continuing his modeling career in the United States, with the exception of a few international photo shoots. Crowley, a fashion designer in New York City, announced on Twitter that he would be offering Castiel Novak many opportunities, all of which he can do in the proximity of home.”
Dean’s cheeks flushed. “Well—I—uh.”
Sam spoke before Dean could ask who had entered. “Hey, Castiel! Why are you here? I thought you had a photoshoot today...”
It was now around ten, the sun had set a long time ago and the place was packed with people. Castiel had not been recognized by anyone yet.
“Really, Cas, how much did you drink?”
He then turned around and left.
“Of course, Dean.”
It was just another boring Thursday afternoon for Dean. He was in the back of his restaurant, listening to Sam and his fiancé, Gabriel, argue over the house special.
Chuck, he would wait forever for the bartender. “Of course, Dean”
Castiel’s entire body felt like it was on fire.
Castiel walked out of the bathroom and to the clock.
Castiel shuffled inside, standing awkwardly in the middle of the living room.
Charlie rose an eyebrow at Dean, who was shaking his head. “That man” he jerked a thumb in the accused’s direction “is the enemy. I can’t leave, or he’d have won!”
The song slowed, the song slowly fading out. Castiel came to a stop, causing Dean to step closer to him.
Dean sat down next to Bobby, preparing himself for the ‘bad news’. “Yes, sir”
“Yesterday.”
Dean hoped it did.
Sam’s face lit up, and he grinned down at the man.
Castiel let out a relieved sigh.
It was now or never.
Then man then laughed. “Ohhh, I see!”
Dean’s breath hitched, and he looked up at an annoyed Gabriel. How long had he been looking at Cas?
A woman’s voice... very familiar. Castiel couldn’t quiet put a name it.
He grinned like a child, holding the novel up in the air.
“Come on and have a drink with me. It’s on the house!”
“I don’t know.”
The man sighed, taking another sip of his water. “I have, but I am finally becoming successful in it. It would be wise to continue...”
Castiel felt his stomach churning. “And how long will I be there?”
Gabriel nodded frantically, turning around to work.
Castiel’s face burned, and he held back a choking noise. “I...”
This chapter contains descriptions of violence. This update also has a lot of information that is relevant to the plot. It is really important that you read the last part of it!!!
“Me either”
Bobby had mentioned that the model’s eyes were blue...
“Watch your step.”
“What do you mean?”
“Move your damn leg!”
He was just trying to right his wrong. That’s all...
“Hey, Deano! Did you just go swimming, or something? You’re soaked!”
“Cassie!”
Where were they sleeping?
Castiel felt Dean’s thumb tracing circles on his bicep. He almost melted into the touch.
Dean wrapped the fluffy towel around himself, holding the quickly cooling mug in his hands.
Dean swallowed down his wave of nostalgia.
Castiel felt a wave of disappointment wash over him, dragging him under water like a riptide. “Oh, okay.”
—Damn, why was he even thinking about this right now!?!
Castiel’s cheeks burned, and he looked away from the phone.
The model grinned. “That would be nice.”
In the Empty, Castiel didn’t have to worry about monsters, or hunting, or Dean’s safety anymore.
“What books do your students have to read? Shakespeare or some shit?”
Lucifer shook it and led him over to a camera crew. Twenty minutes left until the interview...
Five of his six remaining brain cells were officially gone. The last one kept screaming ‘just kiss him already!!!’
“How...?”
Castiel pushed it to the back of his mind, slowly standing up. His eyes stung from unshed tears.
Dean rushed in, standing in the middle of the living room. His head was bowed down, facing the hardwood floor. He was silent a minute, biting his lip.
Sam stepped outside the restaurant, calling up the extroverted redhead.
He thanked her profusely for her help, a giddy smile on his face.
Gilda giggled. “That sounds SO romantic. No wonder you two are together!”
Castiel felt his face flush, and he smiled. “Thanks, Dean. For everything”
Dean, who had changed his life, made every day something to look forward to.
“No way! He’s just a friend.”
“Sorry, sir, but we have run out of room.”
Cas wouldn’t let that happen.
That’s when Castiel realized that Dean was lying. He wanted Cas home. He wanted....
The first time he met Castiel, he was hiding from a mob of teens. And.... oh my god. Castiel is a model!
Gabriel screamed in the bartender’s ear, causing him to wince. “DEAN! You have a boyfriend!!!”
“No one that he’s told me about”
Dean thought back to the man from earlier. Castiel was polite, kind, and careful, all at the same time as treating him like a normal person.
EDIT: I wanted to shout out my Beta Reader. They didn’t have an account until now, but they finally got one! :)
“We need to get this done TODAY!!! YOU GOT THAT?!?”
Dean smiled at that. Cas had always said that he believes in taking less than five minute showers, in order to conserve the environment.
So they decided to scrap the photo. Back to square one. Again
Castiel was silent for a moment. “Do you need any company on your walk? I don’t have any meetings until later this afternoon”
Cas offered him a gummy smile. “Well, that’s very kind of you.”
Cas took a step backward, his mouth hanging open. “Dean?”
Day Two: The Battle Of The Sugar Packets
Sam sat down next to his brother. “Dean, it’s okay to be upset.”
A strong sense of accomplishment overwhelmed Castiel. He was able to get Dean to laugh! On an airplane!!!
Dean would make sure of that.
“Dean left early. He’s teaching Castiel Braille!”
Castiel erupted in an uncontrollable laughter. Dean gave him a half smile.
Castiel froze. The kid had a very similar smile to Dean. It made something in the model’s chest ache.
He gulped, looking down at Dean’s slightly parted mouth. He wondered what would happen if he were to lock lips with him, and how he would react if Cas were to bite his plump lower lip and tug at it—
“How long?”
“Can you both stop arguing for one moment? The poor guy has to listen to you bickering like an old married couple”
Dean’s POV:
He was wearing Cas’ jacket!!!
He rose an eyebrow, a smile tugging at the corner of his lips. “Yes?”
Dean trailed off, a bitter expression on his face. Castiel’s cheeks burned.
Gabriel grimaced, his eyes darting between Dean and the chair. “Okay, but don’t blame me when Cassie decides to murder you...”
Dean nestled closer, hand moving up to Castiel’s right shoulder. His calloused hand rested on bare skin. The model could feel hot breath against his neck, causing chills to run up his spine.
“Uhhh.... it’s a family”
Meg grinned, resting her hand on his forearm. “Awe... is my unicorn have a crush????”
A woman spoke up. “Time to go, sweetheart”
Lucifer frowned, looking over at the distraught model. “I guess you’re right... I should have gone easier on him”
Castiel sighed. “Ready for your first fangirl encounter?”
He lowered his head, flushed by the model’s compliment. “Thanks, Cas. I try to be...”
Dean then does the most childish thing he's ever done. He, no joke, gets into the Impala and takes off.
What if he learned Braille? Maybe he and Dean could read something together!
He wouldn’t see Cas in Heaven either. The angel would be still be stuck in the Empty, alone. Not even Dean’s death would be an escape.
Sam gasped mid-sentence, falling out of his stool. The room became eerily silent, everyone looking at the disheveled person who had entered.
Castiel’s entire face burned. “No?”
Castiel’s mouth hung open. “No! She did???”
Right?
Karen’s friend took a sip of her soda. “Well, Lucifer asked the man whether he was gay. Oh, the look on that poor face! He was pretty shaken up by it all, and he looked far away for the rest of the interview. Lucifer is a total dick”
Shit!!!!!!
It could only be one person at this point.
“What is it like? Everyone getting in your business?”
“I have to go. Call me again soon, okay?”
What do you like about the fic? Let me know in the comments, and I’ll try to put more of that element in the upcoming chapters!
Sam lightly punched Gabriel’s arm in retaliation, but there was a boyish grin on his face.
“Awe, miss Cassie already?”
busy drinking his coffee. “I didn’t have any shoots this morning, so I had time on his hands...”
So Dean waited, his fingers still entertained with Castiel’s. It took about ten minutes for the drunk man to fall asleep, his head back leaning against the back of the couch. His breathing became shallow, and his grip on Dean’s hand loosened.
“Heya, Cas.”
Dean walked out of the bar, entering into cool night air. He traveled through the streets, eventually making it back to his apartment complex. He had a lopsided smile on his face the whole way.
Charlie giggled. “And he looks at you like you’re a GOD!!! The pining going on between you two is ridiculous. Can. You. Stop. Pining. And. Just. Kiss!?!
Ughhhhhh
Dean walked over and grabbed his brother’s ass. “See ya tomorrow, Sammy.”
Castiel couldn't bring himself to wake Dean.
The bartender’s facade was crumbling. His voice betrayed him, cracking slightly. “M’fine”
Castiel chuckled. “You’re doing great. We’re half of the way there.”
Sam stifled a laugh. “Are you okay, Gabe?”
Dean offered him a nervous smile. “Cas, will you be my boyfriend?”
So he began talking.
“I would love that, Cas. I would have to teach you, and the pay is—
Dean couldn't control a sly smile from forming on his lips. Castiel, a man he has only met only a few times, wants to spend his morning with him...
But, somehow, Dean always managed to find another date.
“It’s kinda important that everything is in the correct place. If it isn’t, I’ll have problems cooking later.”
It was quick, but it felt like an eternity. All kisses he had with Dean he been like that.
Fuck, why did he have to say it like that??? Now he sounds like a creep—
Castiel’s face burned, and he held back a choking noise. “I...”
Hell, they have been fucking awesome!
There were photos of Dean and Castiel walking together.... and one of them talking right outside Dean’s bar.
The model sighed, sounding defeated.
He brung Cas with him today!!!
“Whatever.”
He only wanted Cas to go because he thought that it was his big chance... he wanted him to succeed.
Before he could react, Dean sighed, nuzzling deeper into the covers. His mumble was barely audible. “Five minutes....”
Gabriel’s POV:
“In about a week, give or take.”
Castiel nodded. “We should finish that horror novel we got from the library.”
The model frowned. “It’s very strange...”
Castiel spoke softly, trying not to scare his friend. “Dean...”
Dean was unloading the dishwasher. It was one in the afternoon, so he was alone in the restaurant.
Dean frowned, fiddling with his hands. His confusion must have been apparent by the look on his face.
Hey, everyone! Happy pride month!!!
That felt good.
“Awesome. I’m sure you can find someone to talk to while I’m out.”
The model shuffled in, taking his rightful spot at the kitchen table.
Castiel would have taken the latter option.
Before, Castiel decided to blame the cause of Dean’s blindness to a disease or condition of some sort. He never was able to imagine that Dean had been....
What the hell is a ‘playboy smirk’????
One chapter left!
The model was beyond confused. Why didn't Dean flinch away? Why was he just lying here, on TOP of him???
Then the fourth night arrived.
Cas winked before looking back at his computer. He. Fucking. Winked.
He knew he was going to regret this.
“Awwwww! Dean has a crush?!? What’s his name?”
Castiel laughed. “I think I am okay with that.”
He reluctantly nodded, holding out his hand.
Dean’s breath hitched, and his free hand moved instinctively to the model’s shoulder
Dean let go quickly, facing ahead. Now that Castiel’s saw him better... Dean’s eyes were beautiful. The shamrock green irises were looking ahead blankly. His lips were impeccable. his Cupid’s bow and bottom lip were the perfect shape.
This was too good to be true.
“Yup. I was such a dork”
His voice was barely audible, almost lost in the wind of the oncoming storm. “Yes.”
Lucifer nodded. “SO... a few people have spotted pictures of you with a man...”
Oh. My. Chuck.
Castiel rushed down the stairs, racing to Dean’s room.
He thought about it. Getting ordered around by a photographer, being dressed up by others, wearing a thick layer of stage makeup, being judged solely on what he looked like... and he wouldn’t be as good looking forever. Everyone gets old...
“Sorry, Dean, but could we stop by the library? I’ve been looking for a good book to read...”
Castiel huffed. “Fine. What should we play?”
Meg squeaked. “And you need to bring a gift for the couple!”
Gabriel was constantly flirting with Sam, who ignored him completely. Dean always loved their chemistry. Gabriel was loud and extroverted, not afraid of taking initiative. Sam was the exact opposite. Somehow, they fell in love.
“I—uh—That would be great, Cas.”
Everything was going great....
I hope you enjoy this chapter.
Castiel’s throat went dry. This was not the time to panic. He can freak out after the interview, not now.
He creeped back to the bed, getting under the covers without hesitation. He had no energy to freak out about sleeping with Cas tonight.
“Oh cool! What did you guys do?”
He felt like a zombie by the time the sun rose. He was roused by the sound off his alarm going off. He rolled over and turned on his phone. There was a tiny icon that had appeared, reminding Castiel of his task for the day.
And so Cas accepted his death. He was at peace.
Castiel’s eyes darted across the man’s body, observing the toned and defined muscles.
They often joked and laughed together, just like before. But there was an element that wasn't previously there.
The hunter cried until his throat was sore. Tears fell from his face until he had nothing left inside. Dean ended up sitting against a wall, knees tucked to his chest. All he could feel was cold. Hollow, empty, abandoned.
Dean walked blindly into his closet, pulling a T-shirt over his head. He put on a pair of worn jeans. He brushed his teeth, not in the mood to eat. Dean went through the motions, his mind blank.
“Are you Castiel Novak?”
Dean had no idea what to do. Stay like this? Jump away?
The room was supposed to be for him.
The man stood from the stool, pausing for a second
“I would have survived. I’m an angel.”
The photographer downed some more scotch, rubbing his forehead.
Castiel rolled his eyes. “Just take the compliment, before I take it back”
Dean shrugged. “No, I don’t think so. Is it good?”
Castiel got his pose down almost as fast as Anna. All he had to do was think of Dean. He would probably be making fun of him right now if he knew what he was doing.
However, he couldn't help but overhear the conversation between Dean and the other guests.
The music started playing.
Dean’s heart was now racing for a different reason.
Dean chuckled, remembering last night as if it were some happy memory. “Well, you talked about bees and pine trees a couple times.”
“The truck should arrive in about five minutes...”
Hope you all liked it! <3
Castiel felt a sharp pang of guilt in his stomach. He would do anything to make Dean feel better.
Sam shrugged, flipping the golden brown pancake. “No occasion?”
The redhead rolled her eyes, shooing him inside. “It’ll go great!... I hope”
“I wanted to stop by and apologize again... I know you don’t want to see me, but I couldn’t stay away. Not without apologizing again...”
Castiel was anxious to meet them. From what he could tell in the photo, the family was close.
However, Sam had a feeling he knew exactly who Dean was talking about.
He ignored how his heart raced. He leaned back against the wall, hand still intertwined with Castiel’s.
Castiel hesitantly took Dean’s hand. It was warm to the touch, and he could feel callouses on the palm. Castiel rested Dean’s index finger on the middle of the page. His hand hovered over Dean’s a second too long. Okay, maybe five seconds too long...
Dean stammered, his face burning. “Of course! It wouldn’t be romantic, but you’re the only person I know who can take me without it being weird...”
... Something was off.
“You are. You have a wonderful speech and you look more handsome than anyone there will. Everyone will think you look hot—er—handsome.”
Dean offered him a sad smile. “Hey, kid? How’s playing God going?”
Dean needed to find a way to apologize.
Garth, sitting with his legs propped up, nodded to him in greeting.
He shrugged. “I’ll have the usual. Pie too...”
Woah, Dean. Focus on the task
The man smiled.
But it was so much more than that. Sam had witnessed every heartbroken expression on Dean’s face whenever Cas left, whether it was to find God or go to the grocery store. Whenever he was away, Dean wasn’t himself.
The model tilted his head. “What?”
Dean frowned, taking a tiny sip of his drink. No way was he leaving Castiel like this...
As the hour rolled on, a massive crowd had gathered. Castiel was approached by almost every person. They all asked how he met Dean, and were curious to where their relationship stood.
Here is the LAST chapter of the story. I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I did writing it!
The contact surprised him, and Dean couldn't control the tiny sound that escaped his lips. He took Castiel’s arm, slinging it over his shoulder.
“Very smart, but also stubborn. She always disagrees with me in class. If I told her the sky was blue, she would try and convince me that it was actually grey. And she’s kind... despite her rough exterior, she is extremely caring.”
~The End~
Sam winced. “That can’t be good.”
Dean smiled fondly down at him. “It’s been great to know you, Cas. I...”
He fought the strong urge to go back. Castiel needed him...
“I love you, okay?!? I loved you and you fuckin’ left me! How can I just keep living like this? Am I just supposed to—what—move on??? Hell no!”
He cleared his throat, suddenly very aware that everyone he ever knew was watching him. “Yeah. Jack’s right, Cas.”
Dean smiled, and he heard Castiel drumming his fingers against the glass.
Dean finished his shower in a temperature equivalent to Antarctica. He shivered as he got into his black t-shirt and worn jeans. Hopefully his day improves from here.
Haha, my own fear of flying helped out a lot when writing this, as you can probably imagine!
Castiel shook his head. “No, Dean—”
Karen huffed. “One of the models in town has just been outed by the host on ‘Love, Lucifer’.”
Dean. Was. Shirtless.
He turned around to ask Dean if he could use the bathroom when—
Before Castiel could regain his bearings and question Bobby, the older man started up another conversation. He tried to keep up, but his brain was still malfunctioning.
After about another moment of adjustments, Castiel found himself pleased with the overall result.
Castiel continued. “There’s a woman with light blonde hair and blue eyes. Next to her is a man. Black hair, pale blue eyes. In his arms is a baby... it’s really tiny.”
“Oh?”
Gabriel sighed. “That’s not all, Dean.”
The shorter man, Gabriel, called to the back of the restaurant.
Benny sighed quietly. “Five in the morning. Sorry I woke you so early, but Sam is already freaking out. He wants to look perfect for Gabriel, and he wanted you to help.”
Dean grinned. “Huh, I didn’t you were capable of laughing that hard.”
Castiel shushed her, his face a violent shade of red.
The plane began turning, and Dean’s breathing became more rapid. He could feel himself getting light headed, but he didn't care.
His heart skipped a beat. Was this happening, or has he finally snapped?
“I—why did you do it? Why, out of all people in the world you could love—why me?”
Gabriel grumbled from behind the door. “Nine thirteen. Now get up and ready!”
Castiel’s stomach did a flip. “I’m (very) glad to be back...”
Sam made his way over to help, but then paused. He turned to look at Castiel, a devilish smile forming on his lips.
Dean often found himself staring at Cas and wondering what it would be like to hold his hand, or watch movies and read books together.
Castiel finished his tea and set the cup in the sink. He then turned, facing a distraught Dean.
He got up and opened the door.
The climax has finally arrived! :)
Castiel, much to Dean’s surprise, smiled. “Yes, I guess it does... I have always meant to ask you, what is so important about this seat?”
His brother yelped. “JeRk”
Bobby chuckled. “He sounds like Prince Charming! What’s his full name? I want to look him up.”
No one had ever told him what death was. It was never relevant... until now.
The bartender felt the tension leave his body, and he grabbed his own beer, which was still resting on the counter.
But now wasn’t the time to think about his very attractive neighbor—
Ruby, Lisa, and many more had attempted to slow dance with him, and he was getting very sick of it.
“See???”
How do you think it’s going to go?
After intruding on Dean and Castiel’s conversation, The married couple continued to dance.
Sam spluttered. “Wait—when did you learn?”
Wait—why was he putting so much effort into looking good? It wasn't like he was going on a date or anything...
Cas rose an eyebrow. “A couple books in the curriculum are Shakespeare, but I enjoy teaching Mary Shelly and Dante Alighieri more than him.”
Dean chuckled, his suave voice echoing in the hall. “I’m not surprised, you were pretty wasted last night.”
Sam sighed, standing up and stretching. “I guess Gabe and I should turn in. We’ll see all off you tomorrow!”
“We need to get ready!!!”
Sam huffed. “It’s my last day as a free man, Dean. Why don't you just be honest with me?”
Dean rolled his eyes. “Okay... how about this; Sammy is at a table nearby. He can bring us home. I’ll bring you up to your apartment and you’ll go to sleep”
Sam reacted by cocking his gun, eyes welling up. “Then tell me what I said. Prove to me that you’re Castiel.”
That was the boy Castiel had met in the New York City airport.
“Ready to go?”
A familiar voice roused him from his thoughts.
The model’s breath hitched.
Gabriel stared down at the water, eyes unfocused. “No. It’s just that... Dean never talks about Mary with anyone. Not even Sam...”
Charlie put a hand over Dean’s mouth, using the other to flick his forehead. “You’re the stupidest sap I have ever had to console!”
The man poured the hot coffee into the mugs. “A couple times... I don't usually though. Just for important events and holidays”
Dean gaped. “Did you...?”
the bartender twisted, reaching over to the backseat. After a couple moments, his hand found a heap of fabric. He grabbed it, bringing the jacket to the front. He slipped it on.
Oh thank Chuck! No contact.
2. He moved out of his previous home after losing his sight.
The bartender yawned. “You haven't seen him yet. No spoilers, but he shows up in season four. Who’s your favorite so far?”
Shit!
He found himself sitting in the Cemetery’s parking lot, nervous. The sky was a dark grey, the clouds rolling quickly in his direction. He had about eight minutes before it started raining again.
He and Castiel would be sitting in the Impala together, talking. Sometimes they would be arguing over a case that they were working on. Other times it would be random banter.
Balthazar nodded. “Yeah, that would be great on you.”
So he put on the shirt.
Dean gasped when he knocked his coffee cup over. Luke-warm coffee stained his jeans. He groaned, looking down at his thigh. “Dammit.”
Dean huffed. He faced Castiel, his eyes a remarkable shade of green. He wrung his hands, and he went back to biting his lip.
Castiel glared at him as he dragged a chair over. He sat across from Dean, taking a stack of papers from his book bag.
“Okay.”
Anna immediately knew what to do. It was almost annoying how good she was at this!
Castiel was going to deny it at first, but then he hesitated.
Gabriel chirped, interrupting the intimate moment between the two. “How’d you learn to dance like that, Cassie, and where can I get lessons???”
Dean stammered, his face burning. A very drunk Castiel had just flirted with him. Okay, this is fine. Dean definitely didnt care...
Dean rolled his eyes. “Again???”
He gets out of line, winking at Dean as he walks out of the cafe.
Gabriel nodded, disappearing to the back of the cafe. Dean sat at a table about five feet from Castiel’s. He got out his phone and skimmed over his emails.
The bartender took a bite of the banana muffin. It was incredible! The texture was light and airy (without being dry), and was packed with flavor. He also got a chocolate chip in his bite.
Castiel’s interrupted him, voice shaking. “It’s Castiel.”
Castiel nodded, just now noticing the cameras. Shit... this could go viral.
Well, he’s fucked.
Castiel ran in the opposite direction, weaving through the crowds of people. He turned a lot, trying to lose the teens.
He got out of bed and unlocked the door. It was a familiar voice, but not who he expected.
He ran over and hugged a couple of them, leaving Sam, Dean, and Castiel behind. They walked towards the group of people.
The model shuffled over, suddenly feeling self conscious. He sunk into the water, reluctantly swimming over to them.
“You can’t take Dean to the wedding!!!”
Someone.
“SONOFABITCH! We gotta go now.”
Dean couldn’t breathe. The dull bunker walls became blurred around him, fading away into darkness.
Dean burst through the doors sometime around one, still wearing his pajamas.
Dean laughed again. His voice shook slightly. “Uh—the couple will throw a bouquet of flowers at a crowd. Whoever catches it will be the next to marry.”
Bobby exhaled through his nose, walking over and sitting on Dean’s unmade bed.
Gabriel, before Sam could stop him, made a run for it. The moose followed.
Amara, Cain, Jo, Anna, Lisa, Gordon.
Castiel loved Dean’s speech, lasting a short and sweet seven minutes.
“Because I’m trying to—ughhhh. Okay, so Dean has a potential crush on someone, even though he doesn't know it. Gabe and I have been trying to make him bring the guy, but he is being stubborn.”
“I know.....”
“They found him in your old home... hanging over the stairs.”
The woman spoke before Dean could run out. “Hey, look who I found!”
After about eight minutes, Dean returned with drinks in hand. He put his on the coffee table. He held out Castiel’s drink, offering it.
Ughhhhhhh
What was the point of him taking the bed when he wasnt even sleeping???
Oh, Chuck, he didn’t think this through.
Or so he thought...
Dean downed the rest of his drink. He’s too sober for this
“But can’t we visit her?”
He crept to Castiel’s side as quietly as he could, picking up the note pad and pen. He wrote, taking extra care to perfect his handwriting.
After he set her drink down, She began to speak.
They started off in an awkward silence. Castiel began to worry. Was Dean still angry with him?
About two hours into her marathon and she hears a frantic knock at the door. She gets up to open it, thinking that her mom had forgotten something.
Castiel hoped that Dean liked him back. He did not know what he would do if he didn't.
The bartender rolled his eyes, a smirk forming across his face. “What time is it?”
Dean was a mess when Castiel left the first time, and that had been for only TWO WEEKS!!!
Fuck! What was he saying?!? He barely made it out of Dean’s apartment alive the other night!!! Why was he willingly letting this happen???
The bartender wish that he was numb. That way his heart would stop aching and he could actually sleep.
“Where is he?”
Sam nodded. “Yesh. I just told Dean why he loves Cassie!”
Castiel squinted at Lucifer, his head tilting slightly. “It has been quiet. I have not been seeing anyone”
Well, yeah, he did.
Castiel’s POV:
Dean felt tears well up in his eyes.
He almost had a heart attack.
He checked the time. Who would be at his door at three in the morning?
Castiel was silent.
“Do you like me being here?”
“Hell yeah. His eyes are crazy blue... I’m not even sure that they are real. Maybe he wears contacts or something...”
Phone plug? Check.
Sammy was married!
Gabriel first nodded. “Oh, well—
“What are they talking about?”
He thought he was happy, and that everything was okay.
Sam finally shows up too. He moved into a cabin down the road, often went on morning runs with his dog, and hung out with Dean every afternoon. Although it wasn’t quite home, the hunter was becoming content with the fact that he was trapped here.
Okay, and it was definitely NOT hot.
Sam sighed, scrolling through the photos. “Do you.... do you like Cas?”
Cas rested a hand on his. “Okay. I want you to take a deep breath in.”
The next hour flew by, no pun intended, as they got their bags and rented cars.
But Dean wanted him to go... wanted Castiel to leave.
Castiel opened his mouth to continue, but Dean’s phone rang. He smiled apologetically before looking down at his notifications.
The bartender rolled his eyes, turning around and grabbing a couple glasses out from a cabinet.
“Dude, are you kidding me??? You can’t ignore what’s going on anymore! Everyone thinks you’re dating the man, and he doesnt even know you’re a model!”
In all honesty, he did not want to go.
“Look, I’m just not in the mood. I want to go home and sleep”
He needed to distract himself for the killer hangover he had. Meg had stuck around the bar until closing time, and even convinced Dean to take shots with her.
Castiel tried to rest a hand on his slumped shoulder, but Dean shrugged it off.
Castiel could picture the hideous grin that Lucifer wore on the other end of the phone. “You get more publicity, more job opportunities, and you make money.”
He heard the man shifting, and he gasped. “Oh shit!”
Dean rested his cheek oh his forearm, closing his eyes. “Where do you want to go?”
Sam’s prayer was the boiling point.
Everything Cas had been doing for him: Being his plus one to the wedding and skipping out on work, helping Dean through his panic attacks and nightmares, dancing with him, and now he was offering to work shifts for him WHILE balancing his job as a model?
“What?”
Castiel felt his adrenaline kick in, and his whole body shook. Jo gave him a tiny smile.
“Well, don't be afraid to start up a conversation with Dean. I’m sure he will be very pleased by your skills. Off of the dance floor, I would give him a little space to be with Sam. It is his baby brother’s big day, after all. You can hang out with me until Dean is alone. Then I would swoop in and be Prince Charming. Also, don't pretend with him. He always appreciated when people were open around him. Dean is a relatively closed off man, so encourage him with your body language to relax. He’ll follow suit.”
Dean wondered what it would be like it he were the one to bite Castiel’s lip—
Dean frowned up at him, raising an eyebrow in question.
Castiel’s mouth hung open, his brain completely shutting down. Freckles were littered across the broad shoulder, trailing down underneath the fabric...
Dean had never been this close to Cas before. They were sharing a table only meant for one person. If he moved himself any closer, their knees would collide.
“I couldn't sleep. Are you okay?”
Castiel took another sip. The tea soothed the back of his throat. His hands warmed against the mug, and a strange tickling in his chest made Castiel shift uncomfortably. Dean fidgeted with his hands.
After a couple minutes of silence, Dean spoke. “He was not always a bad father, you know....”
He definitely didn't just think that. No Way.
About twenty minutes later and a couple entered the bar. Dean brought Castiel over to them, walking him through the steps in waiting.
The people left quickly, slamming the door behind them.
He felt like he was going to have a heart attack. “Is this about Dean???”
“What else?”
The nervous man knocked. He felt like bolting back to the elevator, but Dean stood his (shaky) ground. He then heard a muffled shout from inside about five seconds later. “I’ll be there in a moment!”
There was a pause, and the man’s head swiveled in his direction.
She grinned. “Oh yeah, I was just on my way there! I can show you how to get there, if you want.”
Dean made no movement to go over to anyone.
He pulled out his phone, grimacing when he saw a long list of missed calls in his notifications. Dean brought the device to his ear, lips pursed together. It was going to be a long day...
Dean’s stomach lurched. He turned around, grabbing a glass out of the cabinet pouring water into it.
Cas interrupted his thought process. “I’m going to play some music.... do you want to listen with me?”
“Yes, you can, Dean. I’ll be fine.”
No reply.
Dean followed Gabriel into the cafe, turning his head to see his empty seat—
Castiel’s voice sounded hollow. “Yeah.... me too.”
“I’m not even mad about the fact you’re a model, or that people think that we are.....”
Silence lasted about five minutes. Then Dean started screaming at the TV.
“Anyway... just know that drinking only makes things worse. It also hurts the people that care about you.”
It was Dean.
Castiel sighed, looking down at his phone one last time. He took a quick screenshot of the picture and shut off his phone.
“You don’t want to know, trust me.”
“Uh-huh”
Dean arrived early to the cafe again. He walked in, sitting down in his (very empty) seat. It was almost depressing how great he felt when beating his rival.
Every night Dean dreamt of his angel.
Castiel waited for Dean to elaborate, but he never did.
And his hair was brown, almost black.
Cas had fun walking with him?
This was his fault. If he had just been there for his father, none of this would have happened. He could have saved John!
“Have. You. Found. A. Plus. One. Yet. Or. Do. I. Have. To. Kill. You?!?”
The bathroom door opened, Dean trudging over with a tired expression on his face. He flopped onto the bed with no hesitance, groaning.
“No, not really”
“Are you sure you still can’t be my plus one?”
“I think... I have grown quite fond of someone.”
Dean opened his mouth to defend himself, but he closed it again. Cas was right, he should be sleeping.
But why would he be so upset about a drink? It was a bit dramatic, even for Dean.
Gabriel clasped him on the back. “Have a nice night”
Blue meet green. “That was you, wasn't it?”
“Wait until Dean get’s off the floor and another song pops on. That way he can catch a break.”
Dean nodded. The man’s voice was deep and low, reminding Dean of a thunder storm. The way Castiel spoke sent chills up his spine. He coughed uncomfortably, fidgeting with his hands.
The man rolled his eyes. “You really are oblivious, aren’t ya? It’s like you two were made for each other— you’re both equally thick-headed, pining idiots.”
Cas let out a tiny huff. “I need help.”
“—paper”
About an hour later and there’s another knock. Castiel felt a slight flutter in his stomach.
Maybe Cas didn't do anything. Sure, the chances that he would spare Dean were slim, but a person could dream, right?
Castiel just realized something.
“Two”
The pilot’s voice rang from the speakers.
The man was silent for a few moments, as if contemplating what to say. “It is work. I do it and then I go home.”
The photo was blurry, most likely taken from someone inside the bar. It was of Castiel in Dean’s arms.
“C-Cas???”
But now curiosity was threatening to kill him. He walked over to the two women, leaning over the counter.
Sam squeezed his shoulder. “Are you okay?”
Maybe he just should have pissed himself..... it would have been better than letting Cas win.
“Yes.”
Castiel’s mouth hung open. “I.... when? Where?”
The two arguing men went to the kitchen, yelling at each other the whole way. The bartender groaned, feeling his way around the counter. He sat down next to the model.
Castiel sat down at the counter, and Dean followed. There was a moment of silence.
It must have been his imagination...
Castiel had no idea what the other was thinking.
Sam nodded, wrapping his arm around the shorter man’s waist.
The boy slowly walked up to his father, standing only three feet away.
Castiel’s shoulder’s slumped, as if he was carrying the world on them. “You should go.”
“Can you at least wait until you’re not shit-faced?”
Dean sighed. “Cas.... I’m sorry to ask this of you—I know your busy a lot with modeling and all that other shit—and don't feel pressured to say yes... Can you be my plus one? I really need someone to go with me, and I have no idea who to take....”
Garth looked back down at his phone to play another round of candy crush. “Can’t say. I just know that on this date every year, Dean leaves for a bit.”
The hunter was silent for a long time, breath caught in the back of his throat. “Prove to me that you’re Cas... What were the last words you said to me?”
This meant nothing.... absolutely nothing.
Castiel yawned. “Sorry that I stayed so long... I should have let you sleep”
And the interview continued.
Dean felt his face burning. “Uh, he really likes bees, honey mint tea, and reading. He is a wonderful listener and story teller. We used to hang out in the mornings. I would make him the tea and he would walk me to the restaurant. He is extremely smart and kind.”
Castiel put a hesitant hand around the cup. Dean let go.
Castiel’s POV:
That’s when he realized.
It took a second for the Dean’s voice to work.
On his chest was... well, Dean. The man was practically sprawled on top of him, his left leg tangled between Castiel’s. His arm rested on the model’s chest, fist clutching his shirt.
“... I can maybe have Crowley make you one, if you’d like. He has too much spare time, anyways.”
Dean chuckled, rolling off his back to face Castiel.
“No, Cas. Let’s go home...”
FUCK, that sounded awful! Nonono—
The man next to him turned the radio down. Castiel snuck a glance of him in his review mirror.
“Heya, Cas. Sorry, I wouldn’t usually bother you, but I just got back from work. I don’t think I’ll be able to fall asleep for a while... do you mind if I chill with you a bit?”
Why is he coming over—
The bartender sighed. “It’s okay, Sammy, I got Cas. Just go home and get some rest.”
Jo had very well noticed what was going on now. She had a hand on his wrist, and was saying something that Dean couldn't understand.
Castiel stood, walking over to the door and opening it.
Garth smiled up at the model from his phone. He saluted him, a sad smirk plastered on his face. “See ya in a few years, my man.”
“Do you want any coffee, Cas? It’s on the house”
Dean gasped, his eyes wide.
This was very confusing to him. Something was being kept from Castiel, wasn't there?
Dean rose an eyebrow. “Yeah?”
But he would do it forever, if that meant looking good for Dean’s family.
He heard his giant of a brother rush in. A second of silence.
Castiel sighed. “Very long. My employer had me working extremely late hours.”
Dean’s couldn't stop himself from grinning. He chuckled lightly. “You’re amazing, you know that?”
Which meant that they would be flying on a plane together (which he had a serious fear of). They would then be spending eight days straight together; eating, drinking, talking.
Castiel felt his stomach do a flip. “Really?”
No. When Cas comes back (and he will), all of this damned fighting will be over. Team Free Will would be a family again.
He was going out with Cas.
“Sometimes, but most of the time it is fine.”
Castiel nodded, staring up at Sam with squinted eyes.
Sam muttered something under his breath. He then placed a large hand on Dean’s shoulder. “Why wouldn’t he?”
He often wondered what it would be like to date someone. To hold by someone who actually cared, and wanted to return his affection. Someone to spend his life with, hand in his. And the more he thought about it, the more he wanted to experience this with Dean.
How did they get down here so fast?
His face went red from embarrassment. “Shush!”
Castiel stood from the couch, setting the glass of water on the coffee table. “Thank you. I will see you again soon, Dean”
Sam grimaced. “Hello? Dean???”
Dean knew he had to make a move.
“Dean.”
Lucifer smiled. “And have you gone to college yet?”
Castiel felt a tiny smile slipping over his face, surprised.
Rowena rolled her eyes. “Don’t forget your stuff!”
Heheheheh
He knew his question was loaded. There was more behind it than just what he said.
Castiel’s face was burning, and his hands shook.
Dean stood in shock, drenched by a bucket of ice water. It had fallen from the cieling, as if it had been propped on top of the door. He spun around and locked eyes with Cas. There was a thin smile on his face.
Castiel knew what that was supposed to mean. Sam was saying their were acting like a married couple...
Castiel paused, turning to face the receptionist. “Garth.... did you see Dean leave today?”
He’s seen how happy Castiel makes Dean, and vice versa. You would have to be insane not to notice it.
They both spoke at the same time “Rock!”
Dean stood there, looking surprised. He opened his mouth to respond, but he just shut it again.
Castiel definitely didn't miss Dean’s touch. Not at all.
Before Castiel could react, the bartender had turned around and rushed for the bathroom, slamming the door behind him and starting the shower.
He sighed loudly, downing the last of his coffee. He glanced over at Castiel, who was still in his spot.
Sam hummed as he observed the Cafe. “I can see why you like this place so much, Dean. It’s very cozy!”
“Nope!”
(Day later)
How did Lucifer find out???
His body shook from exhaustion and shame.
“I have been trying to think of a gift to get Sam and Gabriel, but I have no idea what. I know they are polar opposites, and that when one likes something the other doesn't. Like—I could maybe get them something for the restaurant, but what???”
Sam froze. “What the hell are you—
So the model slipped underneath the covers, trying to keep as much distance between him and Dean as possible.
Dean’s hand instinctively fell to Castiel’s hip for balance. His body may have stabilized, but his heart raced in panic. He gripped onto his neighbor’s hip tightly, and his face burned.
Dean walked back over with Castiel’s mug. He reached over, offering it to him. Dean felt the man’s hand brush against his, and Dean almost dropped the mug.
Dean Winchester had been blind for years. He was eleven when he lost his sight, to... the accident. He was now twenty six, co-owning a restaurant with his brother.
“Likewise! How have you been?”
His car pulled up to the studio, and Castiel slipped out of the backseat. Rowena was waiting there for him, a big smile on her face. Today he would be having a live interview on ‘Love, Lucifer’.
“Hey, ya’ll! A lot of you have been asking for me to do a video on this... so I shall deliver! I made a PowerPoint with videos and photos taken the day the model, Castiel Novak, ditched his plane to Paris.”
Rowena smiled. “That would be great! It is not the usual ‘leather and chains’ outfit that you wear, and it looks fashionable!”
The man did what he was told, slowly moving his chin up.
“Uh— I have to open the restaurant... Sammy and Gabriel are coming in late today”
Dean felt a wave of disappointment wash over him. Castiel seemed to notice this, because he immediately back tracked. “My apartment number is 314. I might not always be there, but you are always welcome”
Castiel sighed, his entire body shaking. He got out of his car, closing the door behind him and walking across the abandoned lot. He found the gate to the massive cemetery creaked slightly open, and he slipped in.
Immediatley he races to a car, breaking a window and opening the door. He hot-wired it, driving to the closest gas station. After some questioning, he discovers that he was in Maine, hours away from the bunker. The Empty, not to his surprise, made things as difficult for him as it could.
Every night, he dreamed of hooded eyes and a gravelly voice.
Dean grumbled, nuzzling his head back into the crook of Castiel’s neck. “You up?”
Castiel grabbed his duffle bag and walked out the apartment. Dean set the pace, walking (very) slowly down the hall. He was trying to take as much time as he could, and Castiel was grateful for it.
The next time Castiel heard it, Dean was talking to someone else.
The moose jerked a thumb in Gabriel’s direction, talking to the model. “This loser, here, decided that taunting the deer was a GOOD idea. Ugh, now we have a dent in our car door...”
He never forgave himself for what had happened to John, and he never will.
Cas continued, a smirk on his face. “I suppose I would be willing to sacrifice an evening to win the Coffee War.”
He stared up at the ceiling, rubbing at his eyes.
Castiel felt like he was betraying Dean when he left. He sat in his own seat, his own hands shaking.
The teen was smiling behind her hair. “Can I have a picture with you both?”
He stood up and left the hot tub. He found the railing to the pool and dove in. He was underwater for a moment or two, holding his breath
He walked over, sitting down next to the hunter. “It’s okay... I’m not here to talk about that though.”
The customer left them standing there to contemplate.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Three, two, one—
Cas’ eyes were already locked with his own. “Dean?”
He never needed to know how! He tried hip hop club with Meg back in High school, but he sucked. It would be more than accurate to say that he had two left feet.
Castiel looked up from his book. “I am reading ‘Pride and Prejudice’. Have you heard of it?”
Dean paused for a long while, looking like he had a sour taste in his mouth.
It had been three weeks since Castiel had come back from New York. The man would come into the bar almost every morning with Dean. They would talk for about an hour and then part ways.
Cas was picking up some more momentum. Not too much, but enough to match the tempo of the music.
“Heya, Cas. It’s one in the morning! Shouldn’t you be asleep?”
“I need to go back.”
The events of last night rushed back to him.
But the man just chuckled. “You wouldn’t believe me if I told you”
Shitshitshitshit
Castiel laughed lightheartedly. “They are good people. It’s nice witness such a real relationship...”
— Dean
Dean rose an eyebrow, noticing the hint of sadness in Castiel’s voice. “Don’t worry, I’ll come back soon. You can always drop by my apartment too, if you want”
He rose an eyebrow. “Well, I was planning on bringing you home, considering you can barely stand.”
Cas, being the self-sacrificing maniac he was, got in between the unaware hunter and witch.
He then walked down to indoor pool.
“Oh... that sounds nice.”
“And tell me, did Castiel ever date in high school? Or has he ever dated anyone???”
But the man eventually had to leave for work. He stood up and thanked Dean for the coffee. He promised that he would drop by his apartment again sometime.
He recalled the look of excitement on toddler Dean’s face. The resemblance between him as a child and as an adult was uncanny. The lopsided grin only seemed to have brightened with age.
Suddenly he stands. “I have to go.”
Rowena put a hand on his shoulder. “Time to go, sweetheart”
Dean groaned.
Castiel laughed nervously. “I meant to drink or eat.”
Sam and Charlie rolled their eyes simultaneously. “YES!”
The man turned to look at Dean again, who went back to slurping from his coffee cup obnoxiously.
Castiel walked back into the bar, needing a drink.
Dean rolled his eyes. “You’re fine! Just come on in.”
And finally, Dean got everything he ever wanted.
His heart skips a beat when Castiel offers him a gummy grin in response.
It just didn't feel... right.
“Your FACE is STUPID!!!”
Dean was exited to see Cas tomorrow... more exited than he should be.
So he took a deep breath, entering the crowded shop. He found Meg at a table in the corner, wearing a sundress and floppy hat. She grinned, beckoning him over with her hand. Castiel sat, giving his friend a tiny smile. They made small talk for about twenty minutes, talking about work and whether
Castiel nodded at the receptionist before leaving the complex.
“I’m sorry.”
Castiel continued going to the restaurant, forcing Dean to teach him how to bartend. He modeled in the late mornings and helped wait tables between eight and twelve. He would walk then back home with Dean, where they would sometimes watch movies.
Dean’s POV:
Dean’s mouth hung open.
It was early Thursday morning, three days after the fight. Castiel had just arrived in New York City.
Castiel rubbed his eyes and slipped out of bed, calling out. “One moment!”
“We are landing in twenty minutes.”
The second he finished brutally massacring the witches, Dean rushes to join him by Castiel’s side.
The Empty rolled it’s eyes. “I hate you. You have no place here... I’ll make one last deal. I kick your sorry self out of here, and you never come back.”
Rowena sighed. “Fine. But we are having lunch together. We need to talk about all of this in extreme detail”
What did this mean???
She walked over to him.“Cassie! Are you okay?”
The model appreciated all the support from people online, and his embarrassment from the interview slowly left him. Meg hung out with Castiel whenever she was open, watching movies and playing video games with him.
Gabriel nodded, turning around to work.
The man nodded. “What did he say?”
Sam and Gabriel exchanged a tiny look before continuing on their ridiculous Honeymoon story.
Castiel brought a shaking hand to Dean’s shoulder. “What do you mean?”
The bartender finished making the tea, handing Castiel his mug.
“Dean said it would help out with the hangover.”
And he hoped that Dean would be there to catch him.
Dean’s throat closed up.
At the beginning, he would stumble and step on Jo’s feet. He was always looking down, his attention on his next move rather than her.
He got ready for work, eventually walking out from his apartment. Dean got into the elevator. He hesitated, his index finger hovered over the various buttons.s
An endless list of thoughts and questions fired off in his brain.
Dean could hear about five sets of footsteps.
In the day, Dean walked with his chin up. His posture was almost perfect, to the point where Castiel wondered if it was painful. The amount of effort he put into seeming normal was admirable.
Dean stammered, and his cheeks had gone a bright red.
Sam seemed to get the message, a slow smile forming on his face. The next half an hour composed of Gabriel and Sam arguing over chores while Dean made Castiel breakfast.
Now he wasn’t so sure.
“Cas?”
He, hesitantly, left Cas’ company. The moment he stepped out of the cafe and he misses him.
Castiel sighed, pulling out his phone.
She waved him over. “Hey, Clarence!”
The photographer showed the photo to the others. They pointed out his flaws.
“I would like that”
What was the worst of it? Dean CARED! He actually cared about his father, despite all that had happened.
Cassie had a tiny smile on his face, his eyes glued on the Impala as it sped from the parking lot.
“Rock, paper scissors? We’ll just say what we are thinking out loud”
Castiel shrugged. “I was able to take a few online classes in Languages, English, and writing.”
Jack’s head swiveled between a tired Sam and Dean. “What just happened? Did I miss something last hunt???”
The hunter sighed, hesitantly let his brother drag him down the street.
After the last song finished up, the slow song began.
The man drew the bartender into a tight hug. “I missed you, boy.”
How could he face the world without him? How could Dean look up at the sky without thinking about how his angel had fallen for him? Sacrificed himself for him?
Dean gave her one last smile as she left. He then waded it up the paper and dropped it into a trash can.
The bartender walked back to his room. Castiel sat down on the couch, using the little alone time he had to calm himself down. Well, it was not working. The vivid image of Dean flooded Castiel’s vision.
Castiel tried to fake a smile. He’s gotten pretty good at it by now.
Their lips met.
The man had tan skin and high cheek bones, giving him a solemn look. He looked like he should have been on the cover of a magazine, not sitting in a coffee shop in some small town!
The model rolled over to Dean’s spot on the bed, warmth still radiating from where he had slept.
Castiel closed the paperback, setting it down on the table. “It’s about two people who are at odds, due to a bad first impression. As time moves on, they open up and fall in love.”
“No.”
There was a moment last night when he was going to pull Dean into an embrace. He refrained, not wanting to make him feel awkward or uncomfortable.
Jo grinned childishly. “Heeeeyyyyyy, Castiel!”
Honestly, Dean more surprised than he should have been.
“Don’t be too modest! I learned all I know from you.”
He was grateful when Dean stepped in.
Dean nodded. “Cool. Do you have long work hours?”
Dean was in back in his home in Kansas, walking downstairs. He heard his dad yelling, and he came down to see what was the matter..
Dean was the only person who had treated Castiel like a regular human. If he found out, there would be a great chance that the man would no longer see him the same way.
Wait—would that be weird? Would Dean not want to?
Sam laughed bitterly. “No you’re not. Cas is leaving on Monday.”
No answer.
“Relax, Cas. We can figure this out together”
He put on his sneakers and left the building. The model walked through the streets, keeping his head down.
He spoke through gritted teeth. “Really??? Cooooool!!”
But Dean—
She ruffled his hair. “be honest with me though... do you like him?”
“I’ll stop by and see you tomorrow, Cas”
Castiel looked away from Dean, his whole body trembling.
“WaiiITTTT!!!”
Castiel pulled out the Walkman from his backpack, slipped on his headphones.
Eventually, he could make out words from the mumbles. It was like listening to someone on a phone with bad connection. It sounded far away, breaking up at random points.
If he wasn't still mad at him, that is...
“Guys, even if I did... ‘love Cassie’, which I most certainly don’t, he would never like me back.”
“GUYS!!!”
“You told me that Dean needed my help. That I was the only one who could save him...”
He rushed over to the door and opened it.
“How are you doing?”
“It’s not that big of a deal, Bobby!”
“Cas!!!”
He buried face into the crook of Castiel’s neck, his tears landing on the bare skin.
“What is he like?”
He HAD to impress Dean’s parents.
Castiel didn't deny it anymore. He COULDN'T deny it anymore.
Castiel laughed. “I’m sorry, but we have to go. Don’t you want to see your brother get married?”
Bobby laughed, his eyes shining. “Hey, Castiel. We haven't really gotten the chance to talk alone, huh?”
“Are you shitting me?”
“If you don’t tell Dean about you being a model, he’s going to find out himself.”
Dean’s eyes widened with surprise, a tiny smile growing on his face.
The two models stepped in front of the cameras, standing next to each other.
Yeah, Dean was probably just being a wuss.
She rose an eyebrow. “Did you have a one night stand or something? That’s not like you...”
They lurched forward, the plane speeding up.
Dean rolled his eyes, moving past them and to the back of the kitchen.
There was a moment of silence. “Me too. I’ll see you again soon”
Dean’s POV:
Let me know how y’all are doing in the comments! I would love to hear from you :)
“But what?”
Oh fuck. Green eyes, accompanied by freckles. Dirty blonde hair and a lopsided grin.
Chuck—what if he had to dance with Dean?!?
What was he going to do?
The moose entered the restaurant with his fiancé. They were greeted by a cheerful Dean, who was busy wiping the tables down.
“Well, you made the right choice. This thing is great!”
Sam couldn’t stand the thought of his brother being rejected. Dean had been through so much. What if this is what finally breaks him?
He was at his neighbor’s door within the next twenty minutes, knocking. Still no reply...
So, who’s ready for strange question #3? Here it is: What is a fun hobby of yours?
But what if Cas concluded that Dean was broken? Too complicated and weak to hang around?
So he did what any rational person would do when facing death: drink his coffee louder.
Dean’s interest was peaked. “What is your line of work?”
Gabriel clutched Sam’s tux, smiling ear to ear. “Yes! Yes! Yes!”
“Not really. It’s the same everywhere for me”
Dean steps inside the bar and finds a table, Cas close behind.
Maybe they were in for lunch?
But this was getting silly. How could he still be sitting there???
But now? Cas was leaving.
Castiel’s POV:
The bartender’s eyes softened. “Whatever you need, Cas”
His entire body felt warm, and he cranked up the air conditioning. It was July after all... but was that really why?
Castiel sat in a booth. The model smiled, watching as Sam and Gabriel argued over the details of their tragic Honeymoon.
Castiel did something he never imagined doing. He began to massage Dean’s shoulder. His fingers worked out a knot that had formed. His hands moved to the back of his neck.
Dean felt a pang of guilt in his stomach.
“Cas, why are you here? Why are you drinking so much?”
Dean turned his head in the customer’s direction.
“Uh-huh. Charlie said that she could take me”
He put his hand out, and Castiel brushed up against it. Dean tried not to shiver from the contact. His hand was moved back to Castiel’s arm.
“Dean—I.... your mother isn't—
Dean was so used to people stepping on his feet and being awkward, but Castiel was... perfect.
Castiel nodded, looking back over at the teenager. “It was nice meeting you.”
Castiel slipped into the apartment, following Dean into kitchen. He tried to ignore his excitement when remembering how good Dean’s tea was.
“Have you seen a man walk in here??? Blue eyes, dark hair, super hot???”
His hand was buried in the inside of Castiel’s hoodie, gripping at his shoulder. His other arm had somehow managed to slip around Castiel’s waist. His leg was on top of Castiel’s.
“Dean. May I come in?”
“This is Cas.”
He just lost Dean, just when things were looking good for once. They were friends...
Sam covers Dean’s mouth before he could continue.
The bar doors swung open, revealing the idiot. Shuffling behind him was a blue-eyed shadow.
Sorry for the delay. I was going to post it last night, but life had to go and get in the way.
Castiel’s hand moved down to the small of Dean’s back, sending a chill running up his spine. “Do you think you can fall back asleep, or do you want to stay up?”
It hurt.
“So was having an interview with Lucifer. Now my phone is blowing up and the whole country knows that I find men ‘pleasing’. Oh right, let’s not forget that my neighbor is now going to be stalked now too!!!”
Dean grinned, and he bowed down chivalrously in his direction. “This is the famous Castiel Novak, king of bees and random facts. Oh yeah, and he also happens to work as a model.”
Dean rose an eyebrow. “I look like the dude’s boyfriend?... that’s kinda weird.”
What he found on the door surprised him. It was a note, words messily sliding down the page. It was all jumbled together.
He banged his head against a restaurant table in frustration. He had no idea what to do.
“I need you to leave me alone... just give me some space”
Before Castiel could get up and leave, the bartender walked over to him.
(See the end of the chapter for
He was one block from the grocery store. He heard a loud and long gasp. A teenage girl was standing there, a huge smile forming on her lips.
Sam whacked Gabriel over the head, giving Castiel a reassuring smile. “So are you planning on staying for the day?”
Castiel rolled his eyes, taking the phone away from the redhead.
The model felt his stomach lurch, and a shiver went down his spine.
He looked up at the bartender, a sense of longing in the pit of his stomach.
Dean replied, ignoring how butterflies fluttered in his stomach. “Castiel Novak.”
He walked hurriedly across the street, opening the door and entering the shop.
Sam’s heart freezes when he sees a familiar angel. Castiel had merely crossed between rooms through the hall, disappearing within a second.
Cas was offering to wait for him? Without ANY skills?
Castiel thought about green eyes, and the lopsided grin that still haunted him at night. The deep laughter that echoed in his ears, like a song on repeat.
Relief washed over him when seeing a flannel lying on the bed.
(See the end of the chapter for
Basically, Gabriel and Sam are struggling to get Castiel and Dean together. This chapter is on crack. Have you ever watched parent trap??? Well, there’s serious Parent Trap vibes going on...
And Castiel was VERY confused.
“Okay.”
Castiel was silent for a long moment. “Okay. I’ll accept...”
Castiel smiled bitterly. “Yeah.”
Castiel tilted his head. “But how does that work? From my knowledge, people can get married whenever they want.”
Cas rambles about his family, going into detail about his experience as the youngest of four children. Dean laughs when Cas tells him about the prank wars he had gotten into. It is evident by the end of his story that he was going easy on Dean in their Coffee War.
“Now we’re even.”
Fuck! Why did he do that??? He was overstepping so many boundaries—
“Uh—it’s hard sometimes. We always have to restock and not all the customers are nice, but the effort is worth it.”
Castiel rubbed the back of his neck. “I hung out with Jo.”
“Surreeee. What are you going to wear?”
After about a day of nonstop driving, Castiel was standing in front of the bunker door. He didn’t bother knocking or hesitating, bursting through it.
Cas’ frowned. “You are letting me win? Just like that???”
The man shuffled over to the counter, sitting on a stool. “How was work while I was gone?”
“You will.”
“Okay. So do you mind if we dive deeper into the topic?”
Dean bit his lip, concealing his shaking hands in the jacket pocket. “That would be really nice of you, Cas.”
Castiel would KILL to wipe that smug expression off of Dean’s perfect fucking face!
Wait, why was he just thinking that?
Next thing Sam knows, he's hot wiring an ugly mini van and dropping Cas off at the bunker. The angel gives him the ‘find your stupid brother’ look before sighing loudly and disappearing from view.
This man was TRYING to annoy him!
‘Gabriel’s Cafe’ was the best local coffee shop in town. It was always stocked with delicious pastries and, of course, a wide array of drinks. Dean would usually spend many of his mornings there. Hell, he even had his own spot! It was by the window, overlooking a clearing across the road.
His head now rested between Castiel’s chest and shoulder.
But when Castiel looked back in the review mirror as they left, he saw Dean wipe at his eyes.
Dean’s POV:
“Okay. This whole place is open. I have a rug, which is located right in front of you.”
He must have looked awful.
Castiel groaned, burying his face in his hands.
“They both are pretty sentimental—”
Castiel seemed equally as worried as Sam, sitting at the table and staring at the glass of water in front of him. Jack, completely oblivious to last night, was busy reading a book.
And then there was Dean.
The man cheered, and the model grimaced.
Castiel walked over to the pacing man, hands resting on his shoulders. “Calm down, Dean. You’ll be great. Sam will appreciate you, even if were to show up in jeans and a T-shirt.”
“Not until you let me take you home. No way I’m going to leave you here like this”
Dean was asleep before Castiel had even put his phone down.
Thanks for reading! I hope you have a wonderful weekend.
Sam cleared his throat. “Sorry—I just—I can’t help him. Honestly, I think he’s beyond help... I’m scared that the only person who can really help him is you.”
The bartender laughed.
Castiel, while Dean was in the restroom, had swapped tables. He was now sitting by the window, a smug smile on his face.
Castiel spared a glance in the mirror, feeling weird talking to without seeing anyone.
Lucifer smiled widely at the cameras. “Welcome back to ‘Love, Lucifer’, everyone! I am joined right now by the rising model, Castiel Novak! I can tell you, the man is just as good looking in real life as in the magazines! Tell us Castiel, how do you feel about being here today?”
He shot out of bed, racing to the bathroom to take a shower.
Dean waved his brother off, signaling the bartender for another drink. She just shakes her head, looking back down at her phone. “I’m done waitin’! I wanna marry him now.”
Dean sighed. “Well, I’m going to cool off in the pool.”
(See the end of the chapter for
After he finished making Karen’s drink, he walked over to the new customer.
“You should. I wanted to go swimming anyways, so you’ll have the room to yourself.”
He let a grin slide onto his face, heart skipping a beat when his rival returned the gesture. Dean suddenly realized that he liked getting Cas to smile. He liked it more than making Cas upset, at least...
“Dean? What are you doing up?” If the model’s voice was deep at day, night was an entirely different story. The gravelly voice actually shook him.
The model cough uncomfortably, rubbing the back of his neck. “I mean—I can go talk to him...”
Gabriel screeched, running out of the room. “AWwwwwwwwww!”
Nope.
“Are you okay? What’s wrong?”
Crowley took a bunch of photos.
“CUT!!!”
Dean walked over to the door, unlocking and opening it.
Castiel slowly got out of bed, sparing his friend a last look before getting ready.
“No, Dean, this is your room. I’m not going to steal your bed from you”
In either case, it would destroy Dean. Cas was leaving in less than four days, most likely forever.
Dean immediately thought of his neighbor.
“I said no”
Castiel huffed, but a tiny smile tugged any the corners of his lips. Dean started making Castiel tea, and him coffee.
“Okay.”
The bartender spoke, jolting Castiel from his doubt. “It’s good to have you back, buddy.”
The man left Dean, closing the door softly behind him. The bartender let out a long sigh. He already felt as if he was missing something.
He knew Dean would kill him for it when he sobered up, but he would hate himself if he didn’t ask.
The model glanced over at Dean, who was now
Dean had decided to ignore Gabriel’s brother after the whole staring thing. Maybe he could get some work done on his phone before Charlie came. The man was getting his own work done, typing feverishly on his computer.
The peace didn’t last long.
Hey, everyone! I’m sorry that this update isn't as long as most. I felt like I needed to dedicate one last chapter to their temporary ‘apple pie life’.
“Sorry, what?”
Dean rolled his eyes playfully. “Fine.”
He turned off his phone and placed it on the nightstand. The drama could wait.
Jack continued. “That’s it, isn’t it? You miss him.”
“Are you sure? I haven't even—
Dean held back the tears. He hated crying because it would show that he was weak and scared, which he wasn’t. He didn’t need sympathy or help.
Dean huffed. “Oh, Is that why you’re here? I’m fine.”
“No.”
If not something else...
About ten minutes later and another slow song pops up.
Don’t get him wrong, Sam knew that Dean would kill him if he let him go through with this, but...
Dean smirked. “I guess you’re not so bad yourself.”
Dean frowned, sitting on the other end of the couch.
Cas hadn’t let go of his hand yet.
“I’m sorry to ask this of you, but can I hide behind the counter?”
Sam stood up from the booth, putting his mug in the sink. Dean finished his coffee, and helped unload the dishwasher with Sam. Out of nowhere, Gabriel burst through the back door. He doubled over, panting.
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel frowned. “I haven’t shaved yet”
He could still feel Jack’s eyes on him. “Is... are you sad because Cas isn’t here?”
The model hummed in reply, grabbing something out from his backpack.
Until now, he didn't know how dark his world was. How depressing his ground hog’s day of a life had become.
“I know I shouldn’t be asking something of you, especially since you’re gone. But I don’t know what to do anymore... there’s something very wrong with Dean.”
Dean’s POV:
Castiel smiled. “I would like that. What are we going to make?”
Hope you enjoy this chapter!
Could Dean fix it?
They were just friends.
Shitshitshitshitshit
The bartender took his clothes and walked into the bathroom. He didn't close the door in order to maintain conversation with the model. What Dean didn't know was that there was a mirror reflecting off the wall, revealing the inside.
Dean placed it down in front of Castiel before sitting in the booth next to him.
Not that Castiel minded.
Castiel once again, looked like a total douchebag. But everyone on set liked it.
It didn't take him long to figure out why.
In the center of the crowd was an angel wearing a trench coat.
There the model was, sitting on a mahogany chair. His dark hair neatly set up to look messy. His hooded blue eyes looking into the camera seductively. He had a tiny smirk on his face. His legs were slightly spread, and one his arms were leaning against the window sill. The model looked as if he was either about to get into someone’s pants or jump out of the window.
Sam sighed. “Maybe he won’t go... who knows? Hey, maybe you can go with him...”
Dean sighed, taking another sip of his drink. “I...ugh.”
“Why?”
The woman continued, rambling on about how attractive he was.
“Trade seats with me.”
Dean walked into his kitchen, grabbing a glass with a shaky hand.
Castiel hummed, taking another long drink of the tea. “It is very helpful.”
Yup, definitely not.
Castiel glared at Meg from across the room. “You have no idea....”
Castiel tensed up under his grasp.
Dean’s POV:
So there he was, standing behind the counter and numbly cleaning shot glasses. Sam and Gabriel were trying  to console him, but the bartender could barely hear them.
And, as if on cue, his eyes start stinging.
Woah... okay.
Castiel shifted, sounding more comfortable with the turn their conversation took. “Yes, the apartment is nice. I still need to get some of my possessions out of the moving boxes, and I need to go shopping for some furniture.”
Castiel stoped. “My apartment has the same architecture as yours, but I have all my furniture in different places.”
Dean stiffened, his smirk faltering.
“I wish I was. He wants to see you in a couple weeks”
Dean roused himself from his thoughts, helping Castiel into the apartment building. Castiel murmured something under his breath, his warm hand pressed into Dean’s trapezius muscle. The bartender could feel his heart racing.
Meg gave him a reassuring smile. “It’s almost over, Cassie. Then we can leave”
Dean rose an eyebrow. “What?”
“I guess... It wouldn’t hurt to do the job. But what about Dean?”
Sam’s POV:
“What are you going to do while Gabriel and Sam are on honeymoon?”
Time passed by, and everyone was sitting at their exclusive tables.
“Castiel, I want you to meet Charlie and Gilda, Ellen, Jo, and Benny and Andrea.”
Dean rolled his eyes, Showing off his lopsided grin. “Try me”
Dean opened the door. He was just as handsome as the first day Castiel had met his, his emerald eyes and dirty blonde hair reminding him of summer.
Dean had to make the choice between going in Cas’ car, suffering via Sam and Gabriel’s yelling at each other, or being sandwiched between Jo (who was STILL talking about ‘Ghostfacers’) and Benny (who kept saying ‘brother’ every six seconds).
Castiel ran back over to her, half heartedly grabbing his backpack from her hands.
“Yeah! Grilled cheese sandwiches sounds easy to make, but it’s actually difficult. I always mess it up.”
The man next to Dean chuckled. “Really? What happened?”
Definitely not.
Dean froze, processing Gabriel’s words. He then doubled over and laughed. “Nice one. You really had me going for a moment there!”
“In the Empty... I could hear things. I could hear you praying to me.”
“Yeah.”
‘Focus on the road’, he chided himself, ‘you don’t want to get into an accident.’
“The craziest place I have been is inside a drag queen’s closet.”
Why would someone as special as Cas want him?
Once in a while when Castiel was alive, Dean would unintentionally pray to him. This only happened when he needed something so much that he would unknowingly pray for it... and in specific, pray to Cas.
The taxi was already there. Rowena was in the back, a grim expression on her face. The taxi driver got out and began to put Castiel’s things in the trunk.
Dean chocked on nothing, and his voice cracked. “WhAt? No way! Castiel is just my neighbor...”
Castiel smiled down at his cup. “You are really good with food”
And eventually, it gave in.
He needed to go back to Dean.
Castiel groaned.
“Hey, Cassie, you’re trending again!!!”
Every day, Dean would come into the bar with another plus one
Dean paused, recollecting the past couple weeks in his mind. It was awful... every moment without Castiel was felt like a dull and dark dream— no, a nightmare.
Meg rolled her eyes and frowned. She looked worried. “Castiel is just... being grumpy. He just lost someone important to him.”
Shitshitshitshit—
Sam walked back from the bathroom, double taking when seeing them.
They sat down next to each other on the carpet, and Dean began taking out the photos.
Dean faced away from the model, bowing his head to the floor. Castiel couldn’t see that the man’s face was red. “You’re different than a lot of people I’ve met.”
“Hey, Cas. This is a weird question, but where is the craziest place you have been?”
He let go, hand drifting down to hold his angel’s. “I love you... I never got to say it back. God, Cas, I love you so much.”
Reality came rushing back to them.
“What’s your name?”
“Sammy! Get your ass over here and do your job!!!”
Sam was walking around, waiting on people. Gabriel, along with a few others, were cooking in the back. The chaos of the evening was in full swing.
Dean scowled at his father. “Why not? Sam has been working really hard, and he deserves a reward”
“Well, she earned about $50 before the cops showed up. I’m just glad that I couldn’t see anything! Sam and Gabriel said that they are ‘scarred for life’”
“You are a good brother, Dean.”
Dean stepped out of the car, feeling his way to the trunk and getting out his suitcase.
“I wanted you to know me for who I was.... not for what people say I am. Not for how people think I act.... and how I look”
A comfortable silence falls over them for a few minutes, and Dean listens to the music on the radio. They get to a bar shortly after. Cas holds the door open for Dean, a tiny smile on his face.
He may or may not have fallen off the roof when realizing that.
Castiel had been acting weird when he left. He had no idea why.
Dean did all he could to move on. He out with family and friends, drove baby daily, drank a lot.
Wait...
He leaned back over the counter, facing the man. “Do you want fries with your burger?”
—Dean W.
“You’ll thank us later, trust me”
“Uhh—Is there anything I can get you?”
Heat creeped up to the back of Dean’s neck, and his heart raced.
Castiel’s eyes shot open
~~~~~
Castiel shifted uncomfortably. “Yes.”
The man smiled. “Well someone needs to win the ‘Coffee War’, right?”
His ass was pressed up against Dean’s crotch. Just when Castiel thought things couldn’t get worse, Dean put his hand on Castiel’s hip, in order to keep balanced. His large hand gripped him tightly, almost dragging a groan from Castiel’s lips. He somehow refrained by clenching his jaw. Dean paused for a second, getting his bearings. Then he seemed to realize what was happening. Dean hitched a breath.
Crowley put his fingers on his chin, looking over Castiel.
It was as if Castiel had been made for Dean, and Dean for him, the two fitting together like puzzle pieces
The model nodded, creeping over to an anxious Dean and pressing up against his side. His stomach fluttered when he felt a calloused hand wrap around his upper arm. Dean traced circles on Castiel’s bicep.
He was lying on his back, left arm wrapped tightly around Dean, who was using his shoulder as a pillow.
“How’d you think of Bobby?”
Gabriel, who previously had been making coffee, rushed over and climbed in the booth with Sam. He hugged him tightly. He spoke softly into his husband’s ear. “It’s not your fault, baby. You were just too young to understand.”
