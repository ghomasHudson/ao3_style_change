The ex-soldier rushed to him, threw away the blanket from Sherlock's feet and wrapped his ankles in the cool cloth.
Sherlock shifted his weight to his right foot nervously and tried to escape the horrible daggers which glared out of John's usually calm ocean-blue eyes. If the look could kill, he would be lying there in the puddle of blood, torn to the small pieces...
Donovan ran her hand with red manicured nails through her curly hair and shook her head. " Don't get used to it... I've never liked you and I never will, because you're an arrogant arsehole. But I can't stand the people who makes fun of the way someone looks like..." She told him, completely honest. Sally wasn't saint and she knew that, but she would never go that far to humiliate someone for their appearance. Not even if that 'someone' was Sherlock Holmes.
The detective shook his head, looking down at his knees. " No, John, I'm the one who should be sorry... I let you grief for me for two years. But I had to do it... I-I had to protect you..." He whispered softly.
I don't even know why I am writing this, especially when I'm suffering from anorexia, but it feels like a therapy to me. Actually, I quite enjoy writing chubby Sherly, I hope you don't mind.
'If Sherlock wakes me up just for some stupid experiment, I'll probably choke him out!', John thought as he slowly pulled himself up and ruffled his hair.
His right hand dropped to his raven hair. His curls were incredibly soft and pleasant, though he would never admit it, he often wondered what they would be like on the touch. He gently laid him down and put his curly head onto his lap. Sherlock opened his eyes and looked above in John's round face.
He said in a pleading voice, the detective was giving him worries - the doctor knew that he won't sleep well if he doesn't make sure that Sherlock has no internal problems.
" Oh... Are you okay?" He asked. She used to be John's girlfriend, he must have felt something towards her. The fact that she wasn't a woman he thought she was must have been quite a shocking thing to find out...
He threw the jumper on his bed, rose up on his feet with some effort and started to look for something he could wear. Taking his loosest pyjama bottoms from underneath his pillow and a pair of black underpants from the chest of drawers, he walked out of his bedroom and made his way to the bathroom.
The words echoed in his mind. 'No wonder nobody likes you! You insufferable selfish machine! Try to act like a human!'
The doctor brought him closer to himself and pressed him on his firm chest, so Sherlock's left cheek rested on his breasts. He didn't care about what would people say, it seemed like an only right thing to do. He began to rock them back and forth as if he was carrying a baby.
Reconciled with the fact that he will have to walk around the flat just in the sheet, Sherlock wrapped the towel around his waist and opened the door.
It was late evening, something about half past eight when Sherlock Holmes ran down the stairs while buttoning his tight white shirt. He felt full of life, finally something fun to do! He was so happy he almost didn't mind wearing the skinny jeans - well, which didn't mean that he did not complain about it - John has put all Sherlock's black trousers in the laundry...
At first, he was a bit surprised before he remembered last night's events. He recalled the look Sherlock's face had when he woke up from the terror he experienced in his nightmare. He still heard his sobs in his ears as the detective clung to him and cried into his jumper. He felt the unnatural warmth that radiated from Sherlock's skin when he was falling asleep in his arms, feeling safe enough to dare sleep again...
His breath was erratic and unsteady from the distress he went through in the nightmare and tears rolled down his cheeks.
" That's good... Cause I feel the same way, I think..." John's cute round face turned scarlet right after he declared the way he felt about his crazy flatmate. The blood rushed into his soft cheeks and to very tips of his ears. God, he couldn't believe that he had said it out loud...
" Shut up - I don't want to know... I really don't want to fucking know what you gave in it!" John yelled and then his stomach turned once more.
" John, you came..." It was rising from the back of the living room, right beside the couch. It sounded surprised and a bit desperate, none of the baritone he was used to.
The ex-soldier shrugged his shoulders. " Sure... But if you have some work, I don't want to bother you..." His words fade away slightly.
Fortunately, there was a pause in Sherlock's messages and it grew longer, the detective didn't contact him from for ten minutes. The couple didn't know that it was only the calm before the storm...
Sherlock couldn't himself but smile but it came out as a grimace - his stiff cheeks complicated all facial expressions. Now he knew that John wasn't the only one who was worried about him. His brother often seemed like an emotionless reptile and he almost never opened up his heart. All the more precious these moments of truce were.
" Thank you, I'll be right back..." He gave her a smile, which was quite tight because of the nervousness and got up and headed towards Gents.
" Sherlock, I AM happy. I'm the happiest man in the world..." John whispered into his ear and stoked Sherlock's curls.
" Oh, and John? Maybe I should say that I didn't delete to take my sleeping bag, 'cause yours is much better..."
Sherlock nodded. He seemed a little better than before, but he definitely wasn't alright. He was still white as a sheet, and when John took a better look at his face, he saw a thin line over his fallen cheek. He was making an impression of discomfort, as if he wanted to be anywhere else than here.
John's throat tightened with anxiety and guilt. He bowed his head and fixed his gaze on his toes. " Sherlock I'm sorry... I've never been in a relationship with man, I never wanted to be...until I met you..." He confessed.
" I guess so... But what would you say if we'll have this conversation in the morning? When you'll recover?" Sherlock suggested, he needed to prepare for that talk about them two.
Sherlock felt the blood rush to his cheeks and his face turned red like a beetroot. He knew that his nightmares were always a bit wild and now John saw!
He almost cringed when he saw the tired man in duvets, he wasn't easy to eyes. The detective seemed so small and vulnerable. His skin highly contrasted with his raven-black messy hair, he was white like a sheet. His every-time prominent cheekbones were even more protruded, his pale skin tightened over them it seemed it will rip from the pressure of sharp bones.
Amused, Mary watched the detective cry silently and clutch his belly, and her joy multiplied when the thing she needed fell out of his pocket. There was nothing to stop her from hiding her earring into her handbag and cover her tracks.
His brother was sitting on the floor. He rested his chin on his knees, which were pressed to his chest. He looked so young and tiny, suddenly he was a little boy again. Memories about comforting his crying little brother when he was called such horrible nicknames in school never left his mind.
" Sherlock, it's just me, don't panic..." He whispered and started drawing comforting circles on his pliable bare skin, frowning at finding out that Sherlock's epidermis was stone cold.
" Sorry, I didn't mean to..." John's cheeks blushed and he felt like a teenager who had just been caught snogging with a girl...
" Sorry, what?" John has been used to Sherlock's fast monologues and deductions, but this time he couldn't catch it.
Sherlock sneered, but deep inside his heart was overflowing with joy. " As you say, Captain Watson..." He said as he laid down on his side beside his flatmate. He frowned when he spotted that John was curled in himself again, his face crumpled in unpleasantness. The raven-haired man simply couldn't stand the look in his face.
" You can sleep now, ..." John murmured, as he to stroked his hair. " Don't worry, I won't let anybody to hurt you ... " He reached out for a blanket and threw it around Sherlock who already fell asleep. John smiled at him, he looked so young. He pressed a light kiss on Sherlock's forehead and fell asleep with detective's head on his thighs.
After some other several minutes Sherlock rose up from the ground and also helped his friend on his feet. " Well... I'll leave you there so you can take a shower if you want..."
At this realisation, his enthusiasm faded away like steam and the flat suddenly seemed empty and cold.
There was absolute chaos in his brain, the poor detective was completely confused and distressed. His hands squeezed John's forearms firmly and he stared at him with wide, shocked, bloodshot eyes.
" Thanks." Holmes said abruptly and to his own surprise he really meant it. He would never expect Sally Donovan to defend him from bullies when about two years ago she was one of them.
" Fine... I'm sorry, Sherlock, but I'm calling Mycroft... You have to be examined, and since you won't let me, you will be checked by a professional..."
" You only have goosebumps and you're shivering... No, you absolutely aren't cold..." John sneered. He had to admit that detective looked quite comical and... adorable? It was too short for him, sleeves ended somewhere in the middle of his forearms. Jumper was baggy on him, he seemed so tiny.
An unknown strong feeling gathered in his heart as he stared down on the man in his embrace whose curly-haired head laid on his left shoulder.
"Sherlock, Sherlock, wake up, it's just a nightmare!" He could no longer listen to his screams filled with pain. He grasped Sherlock's shoulders and shook him gently.
Two days have passed, but there was no improvement - if anything, it seemed it was getting worse. The detective didn't leave his room except for the bathroom, concealing himself in the safety of green walls and science posters.
The life at Baker Street started to settle down, but it was... strange. The detective took no cases nor clients and his disgusting experiments were nowhere to be seen. Not that John would complain, it was a nice surprise to open the fridge without facing a severed head...
The doctor didn't wait for anything and immediately stripped his cuddly stripped jumper. Before the detective had a chance to look at him with a questioning face, he pulled the collar over his head and helped him into the warm clothing.
" Guys from forensic said they had seen a whale on a crime scene..." Said that voice mockingly and a burst of laughter echoed through the gloomy room.
Bowing his head down, he took a sad look at the overhanging belly he had developed under the strict uncompromising supervision of his tormentor.
To a certain extent, it was because of his vanity and pride, but he knew it could be a good weapon against him. And he knew plenty of of people who would enjoy to see him in pain... But Greg wasn't like that, was he?
His hands gripped the blue silk fabric of his dark blue dressing gown and he clenched it in his fists so tightly his knuckles went white.
John slowly opened his eyes, confused, he really didn't expect he would be woken up at two o'clock in the morning. " Wha- what?" he mumbled, sleepy.
The clock showed something around four in the afternoon, and John was still in the clinic which meant that he still had time to do a few repeats of crunches. Not that it would help but at least he didn't feel bad for doing nothing.
John froze. He never thought that Sherlock would be able of this emotion, but as it seemed, he was. And the worst of all was that it was his fault. He flinched and turned around to take a look at the detective. The gasp escaped his mouth. " Sherlock... " He whispered, more to himself than towards him. The guilt stung his heart, he shouldn't say those things to him.
John moaned slightly when he moved from his secure position, curled into a tight ball. " Stay... Please..." He muttered and stretched his arm to grab Sherlock's long pale fingers. Their skins met and it felt like an electric current has passed through them.
A very unusual sound, really uncharacteristic for the self-proclaimed High-functioning Sociopath, reached John's ears and cut the stream of his memories. It sounded like a...
Mary assured him that he's okay, but Jonn didn't believe that, she didn't know him the way he did, how could she know how Sherlock felt?
Sherlock didn't seem very convinced but nodded. John has never lied to him, why would he say these things if they weren't true? Perhaps he was just being polite and nice.
Sherlock raised his head from the page he was just reading to face his flatmate. " Hm? Oh, fine, thanks..."
John nodded but his head remained buried in between his knees. " Yeah, go on..." He replied, his voice vigilant.
" Is that a stutter? I've never thought I would hear the great Sherlock Holmes lack his words." John teased him a little bit.
Sherlock really didn't want to fight with him, but he felt a strange urge to defend himself. He would never regret what he had done, no matter how John will blame him for it. He saved John's life and he wouldn't have been successful if John had known about that plan...
" I chased him to the Regent's Park... I almost had him and then..." His narrow face with his marvellous cheekbones lost all of its fair colour, his piercing blue-green eyes widened, blinking rapidly as if he was trying to drive away tears.
" What?! Why you're not going? Do you have a date again? Do you remember the last one, don't you? I think you should take a break from that, slow down a bit..." Sherlock said in his 'know-it-all' voice which always drew John insane.
" Great... Now, since we cleared this up, can you set the table? The dinner will be in twenty minutes..." Then John took a look at detective's head and disapprovingly clicked his tongue. " And then we have to do something about your hair, you look like an unkempt poodle..." He chuckled and he could swear that he saw detective's lips twitch a bit, but the gesture didn't reach his eyes.
John looking into his marvellous eyes filled with anxiety and tears. " Oh, Sherlock, I'm so glad you're alright... There's no reason to be scared. I'm okay, you're okay, we're okay..." Mumbled John as he tucked him in a hug. " Which doesn't change the fact that I'm still angry about your words... But I think that I couldn't live without you... " He spoke softly and began to wadle them back and forth.
The doctor didn't hear a word. He kept staring on the thing in his hands. Oh God did Sherlock..." Oh Sherlock, is it your work? Did you knit this on your own?"
" Oh come here..." The doctor grabbed the black sweatshirt Sherlock wore, pulled him to himself and smashed his mouth against detective's. His right hand ran into his soft curls and he continued to stroke his cheek with the other one.
John couldn't help but he had to embrace him again, he felt Sherlock needed to comfort. " I don't mind, you little idiot..." He mumbled and cradled them back and forth, like a small kid. " Will you tell me what's going on with you?" John asked he didn't want to force him to do something he didn't want to.
John smiled, it seemed that Sherlock felt a bit more like himself. " A few, yes... But they can wait, you can tell me when you feel up to it, okay? You can sleep now, I will keep an eye on you..." He whispered and watched his friend's eyelids getting heavier and heavier until he fell asleep again.
" Do you think it has been holidays for me?! That destroying Moriarty's web all alone in foreign countries was a piece of cake? Or these two months in- " The detective immediately cooled down and fell silent when he realised that he almost let the cat out of the bag. He's been just one step away from blabbing out everything he tried to hide!
John knew very well that he was faking, but he was afraid that he would upset him even more. " You're not okay..." John noted plainly. " Can I clear your wounds? Some of them are inflamed. But if you don't want to be touched, it's fine by me. You can visit some doctor."
John's cheeks flushed pink. " Well... It's a jumper I wore the first day we met... That's why I loved this clothes so much... It reminded me of you." He admitted.
" And I should probably warn you that it won't be perfect, I'm not a hairdresser. But I'll do my best..."
John just stared at him with wide eyes and he wasn't able to speak. He knew it was a metaphor, but something in Sherlock's voice and body language made his hair stand on end.
The man let out a sigh and his back hunched, his shoulders leaned forward and his spine arched in the unhealthy angle. The change of position helped to ease the painful pressure inside his stomach, but the excess mass attached to his middle warped into rolls and spilt over his tight waistband like a big muffin.
An uncomfortable feeling settled down in his guts, was he really so incapable to keep a girlfriend? As it seemed, he was - his relationship usually lasted one date. But strange as it was, he didn't mind too much, maybe it just hurt his ego a bit...
He grinned as he could properly imagine Sherlock's sour expression and then he fell asleep with the detective by his side.
The only other reason Sherlock could think of was a Hippocratic Oath - John was a doctor and his pride didn't allow him to treat his patient badly.
It was his belly what first caught his attention - with its size reminiscent of the pillow stuffed underneath the big jumper it couldn't be missed. But it wasn't a pillow, under a closer look John could see a sliver of pale bulged skin peeking between the hem of the snug black top and elastic waistband of the gray sweatpants.
Sherlock jerked when the cold towel met his hot skin, he felt cold even despite the heat his body produced. For the first time in his life, he didn't complain when John handed him the pill and the glass of water and obediently swallowed it.
" Simply happened? Sherlock, are you mad?" John's voice was beginning to rise again, but he didn't mean to shout or scare him.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes when he realised that his brother was lying. " Yo-you're ly-lying... I-I-I h-h-have t-to see hi-him..."
The detective folded his arms on his thin chest as if he was shielding himself from his companion. " 'We're not a couple, I'm not gay' ..." He imitated John's voice in the mocking tone. " You made yourself really clear about that..." He spat, venomously.
Sherlock was looking at him with a sad face. He was so angry at himself, that he did this to that perfect strong man. It was his fault, John was having hallucinations because he left him there alone...
" You can sleep, John... I won't go anywhere..." Sherlock whispered in his deep honey baritone right into John's shell-shaped ear. He couldn't help himself but feeling the heat radiating from John's body was so tempting... Unable to stop himself he pressed a little kiss oh John's temple.
Sherlock tore away his gaze from the dancing fire and propped on both armrests to scramble out of the armchair, feeling achy all over from corporeal punishments Magnussen has been giving him and the physical effort his body wasn't used to.
" Yeah... I was just at groceries..." Sherlock said in the tone as if this situation was happening every day and there was nothing strange with that...
John was getting into the rage. " Why didn't you tell me? Do you have any idea how guilty I am feeling right now? Because I'm a bad best friend! I should have noticed that something bad happened to you! But no, you're the great Sherlock Holmes, 'I know best, I don't need friends, alone protects me' -" John suddenly stopped his tirade.
It looked so organised, empty. Pillows were nicely folded on the couch, instead of laying on the carpet. The coffee table was covered with a red spread, all the mess (like papers, pencils and human parts) from it was away. The books which were always situated all over the place were ordered in a bookcase. There wasn't even one thing on the floor which wouldn't belong there, somebody had to hoover the carpet. somebody wiped the dust and hoovered a carpet.
" Sherlock... Sherlock looks at me..." He whispered, softly. The man showed no signs of obeying, he held his head down stubbornly, avoiding John's eyes.
Sherlock was so annoyed with that bloody woman, he didn't like the fact that John spent so much time with her instead of him! Or was it jealousy? To be honest, he didn't care what feeling it was, he just wanted John for himself! But he knew very well that he had no chance, not compared to Mary.
John wasn't gay (he had said that loads of times) and even if he was, he would hardly be interested in somebody like Sherlock!
A bitter, unhappy chuckle bubbled through Sherlock's lips and the look in his eyes hardened. " You don't have to bother. I don't need your help and especially not your pity!" Sherlock spat out and clenched his plump fingers into fists as he tried to suppress his feelings.
John gave him a pointed look, did that stubborn creature really think that he will buy this? " No, you're not! You're feverish! I have to bring your temperature down." He said, his voice not allowing any excuses, and vanished from the room.
But John seemed happy with her, and even though the detective could be really selfish sometimes, he was glad that John had found someone who was there for him when he couldn't.
Then they just sat on the checked blanket, chatted, listened to the sounds of nature and drank the beer from cans. Even Sherlock did, even though he was against  drinking alcohol (it kills brain cells, John!), he adapted himself to the rest of the group. It couldn't hurt, for once...
"Just like most people..." he corrected himself quickly as John rolled over and shot him with a glare.
" I-I-I'm a-al... a-alive, Jo-John... " Sherlock said, his chin was even more cramping than before. He closed his eyes and hunched his back as he waited for the stream of insults and curses.
The detective drew a shaking breath and honestly, he looked quite surprised - as if he had forgotten about his soaked clothing. " I was chasing the criminal..." He said, his voice weird. As if he was praying that John won't ask further.
She burst into cruel laughter. " You know very well that you can't beat me, that's beyond you! So give it back! "
His breathing quivered and hitched in his chest, making his hefty tummy jump against Greg's stomach like a water balloon, and weepy sniffs echoed through the living room into the whole flat.
He's left-handed, do you see his fingers? His index and middle fingers are calloused, from holding a pen and a gun.  He was shot in the left shoulder, definitely on purpose, the murderer wanted to point out the similarity of John. He has just come back from the mission, he looks exhausted and much older than he is... He's quite -"
John froze in shock, his body stiffened.  " Sherlock, you're not a freak! What gave you that stupid idea?"
" I have no idea what you're talking about!" Sherlock protested and struggled with her thievish hands which dug its nails into his skin and demanded the precious and very useful piece of evidence.  He wanted to pull her away from himself, but she was very strong for a woman her height.
" Sherlock, that's not what I said and I didn't mean it in that way! Look at me, please..." John said softly and waited for his friend to turn around.
" Well, it's unsightly a little bit, but you made it with your own hands which it makes so beautiful... Thank you." John wrapped his arms around Sherlock's waist and pressed a kiss on his cheek.
It was almost a miracle that his legs were able to carry him, even though the majority of his weight laid on the wall. The detective was leaning heavily on the wall, grasping onto it with his dear life, his fingers pressed to the plastering like suckers.
John watched the scene in front of him with wide eyes, this wasn't just a nightmare, typical for fever. This was something Sherlock had experienced and John doubted this was his first bad dream like that...
That's why John insisted on staying at Baker Street, he didn't feel like letting Sherlock alone under these circumstances, and the detective didn't complain - after all, he was so glad to be near John again! However, things got tense between them when John started to go back to work and on dates with Mary.
" Thanks, Sherlock... That's... nice of you...", John said, little dumbfounded. He couldn't recognise his best friend, the cold High Functioning Sociopath... What happened to him?
Standing there like that, pouring at himself almost the whole boiler, felt like being himself again, the warm shower worked wonders. The only thing that was missing was his best friend who always knocked on the door and complained about the bill of water consumption.
" They found me in the morning... Nothing happened to me, I wasn't injured at all... But since then I don't like forests..." He remained in the position with his head covered, his cheeks burned with shame.
Sherlock sprang up in the sitting position and pulled away from John, his face crumpled with hurt. " Is this... s-some kind of joke?" He hated the stutter, but he could not help himself.
They were getting closer and closer, his lips just a few inches away from her, she could feel his warm breath on her skin, only a few centimetres separated them from the kiss...
By a happy accident, he got found when Greg and Mycroft headed to the Scotland Yard to continue in the surveillance of their lost friend and sibling.
John jumped in surprise at the deep baritone somewhere behind him and he was glad that he hadn't cut off his hand together with the tomato.
" Thanks..." Sherlock whispered as he drew the jumper closer to himself and inhaled John's nice smell of aftershave water and his shampoo, but only inconspicuously.
Sherlock loosened the grip of the provisional cold compress and the package hit the floor with a loud rattle, but the detective didn't pay attention to it anymore.
The DI Lestrade listened to the gut-wrenching noises with sad face, it sounded so WRONG! Sherlock wasn't supposed to be crying, he should be working on some disgusting experiment, solving a murder or doing the other typical things Sherlock Holmes would do two years ago!
" I wanted to play the hide and seek. We didn't know it there and I got lost. Mycroft ran home and told our parents what happened. They were looking for me the whole night. I was terrified - that night came a huge storm and gale, the trees were falling down around me, I was so scared!
John's constant attempts to make him eat weren't successful, he left the plate on the doorstep, but the detective never touched it. And the hunger pain was the result.
John had never seen him so vulnerable before. And why was he apologising, for God's sake? For losing his control? For being sick? For having a nightmare?
The doctor ruffled his hair in frustration. He had to fix it somehow..." Susan, I know it was catastrophic, but I will try hard to make it up to you..."
He wished to be at home already, he was so looking forward to John, hot tea and sitting in their armchairs while watching the crap telly. Sherlock didn't understand why some people voluntarily watch such movies. But if anything, it was good training for deductions and remarks, very useful things... And it usually made John laugh, which always seemed to be a good bonus.
He leaned on both sides of the toilet seat and gripped the plastic so firmly his knuckles turned white. He curled over the bowl, his body trembled as he began emptying his stomach.
He only left his bedroom when he needed a shower or use the toilet, grateful for a spare door to the bathroom right next to his bed.
The army doctor almost rolled his eyes. " Waking you up. Did you really think that I would leave you unsupervised? You had a nightmare and pretty bad one, so..." He scratched the back of his neck.
Sherlock drank down the whole glass, he didn't realise how thirsty he was until now. His head was full of the nightmare he just had, Magnussen's cracked voice still cut him in his ears, he still felt the leather belt whip his full round belly-
They just laid there, the tall detective kept rubbing the soldier's stomach until it was in its normal state. When he glided his fingers cross John's torso now, the skin was becoming pliable under his touch. Sherlock didn't mind, vica versa in fact. The small pudge on doctor's middle felt strangely comforting and warming.
John raised his head from the toilet. " Sherlock, eating three to five meals a day isn't overeating, I'm not the one with an eating disorder..." He snapped venomously.
When the water was almost seething, Sherlock reached up for two mugs from the cupboard and was about to put them on the kitchen unit and when -
" Thank you, John..." Sherlock said, gratefully took the mug and raised it to his lips to take a sip. Then he took a look at the doctor from head to toes.
Whatever had caused that, the last two months must have been very hard for Sherlock. And John wouldn't allow him to be sad. He wasn't going to lose him, not again...
His lips twisted in a smile when he heard John's erratic breath when he brushed his soft midsection.
On the other side, why was he surprised? It was quite understandable that John didn't want to be seen with him, after all, what use was he?
" John, as usual, you see but you don't observe... You're living with me almost a year now, you should have noti- uhm-" The detective's usual tirade was stopped by something warm and soft. It tasted like tea and biscuits and beer.
Slowly but surely, the water started to grow cold and it was time to wash the lather out of his hair and climb out.
Sherlock sighed and rolled his eyes majestically. " As usual, John, you see, but you don't observe..." And he began to explain.
He's been under a lot of pressure and stress, there are dark circles under his eyes, he's sleep deprived from the fear of nightmares about the battlefield, I dare say.
He thought and was about to knock on the wood when his phone beeped and announced an incoming text. Digging his hand in the pocket of his jeans, he took out his phone and frowned at the screen.
John flew through the room and bent down, well more likely he slide down next to him. " I'm right here..."
John's eyes grew wide at hearing the always emotion-less detective sound so tiny and insecure. " What? What do you mean? Why would I be joking?" He didn't believe that, did he?
Sherlock lowered his eyes, suddenly interested in wiping up some invisible speck from his black trousers. " The only thing that kept me sane... were you..." He closed his eyes and his face was burning. " Because I... I... Because I love you..." He whispered so softly that his voice almost faded.
" Well, it's still the same - although they're not 'little'... They're brats..." Susan said, her voice hardened a bit at the end of the sentence.
" Forget I said anything... It wasn't important... " Sherlock tried to back out of this conversation.
He sat down on the edge of the couch, grabbing his friend on both sides of his face and leaning toward him.
" Don't you mind?" Sherlock whispered, pointing towards his hand on John's warm body. John didn't seem to mind very much, but the small soldier never stopped surprising him.
The detective's shoulders broadened significantly, the arms and legs thickened and the once jutting hipbones hid under a layer of fat.
Without a warning, the young genius threw himself forward, leaned on the surprised woman whose slim frame had no chance of staying on her feet at such lunge and knocked her down.
Unable to resist an urge to return the embrace, Sherlock wrapped his doughy arms around his best friend and snuggled up to him, resting his head in the crook of John's neck.
Sherlock chuckled unhappily, this was it... Why would John ever care about him? Why would he waste his time with annoying, insufferable and rude git who did nothing but showed off with his intelligence? With a man who could be easily replaced - like so many times before...
The room got illuminated by the bright light of the lightning bolt and John worriedly watched his friend. In the white flashing light he seemed to be almost deadly pale, so vulnerable and fragile. His eyes were big as plates, terrified and weepy as if he was expecting something bad to happen, like the end of the world...
The black-haired man just sat on the chair and glared daggers on his vegetable salad, this was the exact thing he wanted to avoid. Eating itself didn't sound appealing to him, but eating in front of John? Maybe he should have stayed in his room, what was he thinking?
In a shock and surprise, the detective turned around and both cups fell out of his hand, shattering on the kitchen tiles.
John sat on the edge of Sherlock's bed and read some book he found on the bedside table, but his thoughts were somewhere else. He couldn't stop thinking about what Sherlock told him.
But his doctor saw that face." Those puppy eyes don't work on me... " he remarked. It was a lie and he knew Sherlock knew that. 'You think that you're going to fix up your green-blue-grey eyes on me and I'm going to do everything you want? ' he thought, realising that he wasn't going to win. Not with this stubborn, ridiculous man he loved so much.
John looked so startled as he reached his fingers to his temples. " Shut your mouth! You know nothing!"
The doctor gave him a small comforting smile and made his way to the bathroom. " Don't worry, I'll be right back." He swore him and disappeared behind the door.
Sergeant Sally Donovan was standing in the doorframe, her arms folded on her hips. She's been watching the scene in front of her for a while - she had heard some voices so she came to check what was going on.
" You were there..." Sherlock whispered in a hollow voice and cursed himself for letting his voice waver. Emotions weren't an advantage!
" Just stay here, please. I'll be home soon, I promise... And then we can just sit in our armchairs, drink tea or watch some crap telly, we can even play Cluedo if you want..."
Sherlock sighed heavily and rubbed his eyes. " No, I didn't... He ran away..." His voice sounded so tiny yet so disgusted, disappointed with himself.
" There's nothing wrong with you, Sherlock... It happens to lots of people, gaining weight is a completely natural and usual thing, so don't bother yourself with it. Furthermore, I know you will lose it quickly, I've never met someone so stubborn as you..." John murmured and gave his friend a boosting smile to calm him down. He was pleased with himself when h managed to make his friend smile a bit.
John's corners of his lips lifted in a small smile when he felt Sherlock's gentle mouth on his face. " Did you just - "
Sherlock's breath hitched, the feeling of John's warm palms pressed on his sides felt so comfortable, it didn't warm him up just from the outside, but even from inside. His heart pounded at least two times faster than normal, something strong swelled in his chest and filled his insides with the warmth of being wanted and cared about.
As soon as he said that, another bolt with thunder emphasised his words and the detective gritted his teeth to prevent the scream which threatened to come.
One of Sherlock's curly black strands tickled John's cheek as the man beside him nodded slightly and John almost took it in his fingers and tucked it behind his ear. He could almost feel the warmth of the blush which spread across Sherlock's cheekbones.
For a while, they remained in silent, both of them hide in their Mind Palaces. Mycroft kept cleaning his wounds. Sometimes Sherlock let out a little hiss when his scratches stang.
Hearing that beautiful, gentle voice calling his name woke Sherlock up immediately, he would recognise it even in the death. He opened his eyes quickly and widely. A huge wave of relief filled every cell in his body, he came back! He didn't leave me! Even though I was such a disgusting fool!
As Sherlock talked, he saw it all again. All those horrible memories attacked his mind. " They caught me, imprisoned me and kept interrogating me for so long two months! I refused to talk to them. When they lost their patience, they became... violent. They wanted to know about... They knew about my pressure point... And they used it. "
The pale man widened his eyes at him, it was serious. He had to speak with him like that and thought that he was still with him. " E-e-every day?" He was so upset about his friend that he wasn't even embarrassed about his voice.
Sherlock finally stopped in his march and bit his lower lip when realised that he was acting like a lunatic.
With the warm drink in his hand, he made upstairs and grabbed a handle of the door. He opened the door slowly, thinking about what is he going to do. His life was so empty, he never felt like this in his life, not even in Afghanistan... Maybe he could sit down into his armchair, cover himself with his blanket and take a book...
John blushed too when he realised what was Sherlock saying. " No... I'm grateful to you. You saved my life. I already said it at your... grave." He choked at this word, he hated it. " But I'll do that again. You are the best man and the most human being... I was so alone, after Afghanistan and your fall, and I owe you so much." He whispered.
When Mycroft was done, Sherlock took a deep breath and forced a toothy smile on his cupid lips. " I-I-I'm ha-ha.... ha-happy for h-him..."
The man cried out on the sofa and began to twitch as if he had an epileptic seizure, and then an almost inhuman scream of pain broke out of his lips.
Something hefty and warm was pressed against his body, entangled around his trunk like an octopus with its tentacles, and something soft and fluffy tickled his cheek.
John dashed into the loos and accepted the call. He didn't wait for anything and let the anger which raised inside him the whole evening, out of his body.
Sherlock jumped out of his boyfriend's bed and grabbed his arm. He looked scared. " You're leaving me... You came here to take your stuff...didn't you?"
The doctor took the detective's chin and drew him closer, squeezing him slightly. " I know, Lock... I love you too, you precious git." John mumbled before he leaned over and closed the gap between their lips.
He pressed the back of his hand on his lips, horrified that he was about to burst into tears right in front of John!
He moved a bit closer to corpse's face. " He can't be older than forty, he's in very good condition, but he's been suffering from PTSD. From the war - his tan, short hair and build indicates it's a soldier."
Sherlock took care of the car, you would be surprised, but he knew how to drive. Although the passengers were a bit nervous about it, after all, the detective was an unpredictable man, you never knew what he was about to do...
His bony knees pressed against his flat chest, and on his left one - was it Billy? John's feeling of guilt even deepened, Sherlock didn't expect him to come then, that's why he replaced his skull friend instead of his real one.
But John didn't let him. " No please, tell me... I'm not going to laugh at you, I swear..." He fixed on him his big puppy eyes.
" Shush... Don't talk like that, don't upset yourself even more... He really cares about you we all do... We're not leaving you alone in this mess..." He promised and gave both Sherlock's shoulders a light squeeze, meaning every word he said.
I really hope that you're not angry with me, but I felt completely stuck with the story and it just didn't feel right to me.
John frowned and his eyebrows furrowed in worry. " What happened? Why are you wet as a drowned rat?"
Mary stroked detective's cheekbone and brushed away a few little tears with her thumb. " Oh, darling, he won't find out... Because you won't tell him..." Her voice hardened - at the end of the sentence she was almost growling - and her fingers pinched his face.
It didn't seem credible to him, he knew the man well - Sherlock dealt with stress with much more creative methods - shooting the wall or playing wild compositions on his beloved violin were ones of his favourite...
The ex-soldier slid his hand upwards, took the tip of the blanket and tugged it carefully under Sherlock's chin.
John always admired their relationship, one could say that it was just a landlady, but for Sherlock (and himself of course) it was a part of the family.
The skin under John's squared chin wobbled as his throat tried to get rid of the sour unpleasant taste which reminded him of meals he had eaten today. His hands, glued on his lips, prevented him from making the mess in the on the floor.
Every few hours John knocked on the door of Sherlock's bedroom to check on him and ask if everything is alright, only to receive a quick text from the man inside that
Sherlock sighed and began to unbutton his purple tight shirt, which clung to his lean torso even more than usual. He wasn't very successful, his hands trembled so much he wasn't able to unfasten his top.
Sherlock rolled over on the other side and sat up, his eyes scrutinising John's face to tell whether he lied or not.
Boys had spent a nice evening with a little walk around the surrounding area, admiring the peaceful landscape of Oxfordshire, but it took a bit longer than they expected. When they arrived at the place with their tents, the sun had already gone down.
" You could have broken his nose, you fat sh*t!" Growled the first one while the second one raised his hand to strike to revenge his injured friend.
John pulled away, unwillingly, and examined the flushed face of his friend? (boyfriend?) , whose mouth turned ruby and contrast with his pale skin, except his cheeks which were red like two apples.
With satisfaction, he laid down next to his partner and put his head on his muscular shoulder, inhaling the familiar scent of John's cologne and aftershave water. Suddenly, Sherlock's brain calmed down, the voices were gone and he could relax.
" Look at me..." John whispered gently and when the detective didn't obey, he put his index finger under his soft chin and made him look him in the face.
John smiled slightly, how could such a magnificent bright man not understand this?  " Do you really think that I would stop loving you because of some stupid fight and even more stupid jumper?"
The doctor ruffled his blonde hair. " It bore down on me, I began to have little doubts... But now... It doesn't matter. Because of this. " John pointed on the knitted cloth and took it on. It was too big for him, he would fit in two times at least.
It seems that our boys are finally understanding their feelings for each other! And of course I had to mention Mrs Hudson, because she loves Sherlock and she really cares about him. Do you like Mrs H? :)
" Stay... Please..." Sherlock mumbled, words slurred together with the exhaustion, but the doctor understood what his friend was saying.
He gritted his teeth. " A-at le-least I-I-I di-didn't g-ge-get m-mad! A-a-and b-by t-the way, th-that st-stupid ga-game as y-you s-say, sa-saved your bl-bloody li-life!" His voice didn't sound as dangerous as he wanted.
He clicked on the 'received' folder and frowned when he found two unread messages from his flatmate.
Her cruel laughter stung in his ears and took away the rest of the self-esteem he had left. How come he didn't see that?! He was the only Consulting Detective in the world, he could tell everything about
Sherlock's tacitness was making Mycroft really worried, Sherlock had never been so quiet... " Sherlock... I know it's uncomfortable and hard for you. But I'm your brother, I'm not going to laugh at you..." He swore him. He never felt an urge to mock his brother to hurt him. Especially not in this situation...
As it seemed, the Yarders were right, weren't they? John was ashamed of him and didn't want to be associated with him!
" Sherlock, this is ridiculous... Open the door, please..." He knew that there was an even chance that Sherlock would let him in that quickly, but he had to try everything.
' He internally scolded himself for letting that monster influence him this way, shoved the imaginary man into the 'Forbidden Room' in his Mind Palace and slammed the door behind him.
John stroked Sherlock's tightened chin to help him relax a bit. " And now, speaking about your little problem, don't worry about it."
" I meant BOTH of you... Can't you just once behave like grownups? It's just afternoon and I already have a headache from your squabbling!" He rubbed his temples and ran his head through his blonde hair.
He had last seen him two months ago, when the detective sneaked back in his life and interrupted his date just at moment he was about to propose to his girlfriend, ruining one of the most important days of John's life.
The noise made John's hair stand on the back of his neck. He leaned closer to him, alarmed by the heat and negative energy Sherlock's body radiated, he wondered if he has a fever. As an experienced doctor, he put the back of his hand on Sherlock's sweaty forehead and froze when he realised how hot it was. This wasn't just a temperature, his friend was feverish.
Sherlock's brows furrowed, there was nothing wrong with the ham, he himself had a few slices, he would recognise if the meat smelled spoiled.
One of his hands ran across Sherlock's shaking back and gently squeezed the nape of his neck, while the other one still remained wrapped around his wide waist.
" Jesus, do you sleep with your phone as well? Or should I say with your creepy flatmate?!" Susan growled, her throat tightened in loathe.
" Me? What are you talking about? I'm such a hothead and you know that. I'm sorry that I'm grumpy and I kick off at you sometimes... But don't be afraid, you're not going to lose me. Even the most stupid thing that will ever leave your insulting mouth will never make me to leave. You won't be able to get rid of me so easily... " John grinned as he threw up his arms around Sherlock's slender torso and tilted his head on a side.
A muffled whimper returned the soldier to reality. He turned his head in the direction of the source and his heart clenched at the sight of his flatmate in duvets.
From pieces of sentences she had registered she could tell what was the cause of this fuss. However, that haven't decreased her surprise when she first laid her eyes on Sherlock.
He felt like a coward, especially in front of his friend who used to be a soldier... His face burned with shame, and he didn't dare to take a look at the doctor's reaction.
The last three chapters didn't come out as I wanted, so I decided to change it a bit. I hope that you're not too annoyed with me and that you will like it this way.
" I hope you haven't contaminated the crime scene. I don't want to have all clues stained with grease..." He used the same tone as the detective and chuckled at his own joke, together with the two forensics.
For a few minutes, they just sat like that, the silence got interrupted only by John's comforting whispers when Sherlock jerked occasionally at the sound of the storm.
The doctor paused in thought as he tried to remember what he consumed today. " I don't know... Bread with ham, I think..."
" Would you mind if I'd keep that? Just this one thing, please... I just want to imagine that you're still here. That you still love me... " Sherlock asked in a little voice. He had dark bags under his eyes, he looked thinner than he was before he left, his cheekbones protruding in his white face.
He expected John to fight with him about the importance of cases, but nothing came. Well, something did, but it was far from a reply. He let out something like a groan and jumped out of the armchair so fast you would see him blur. He pressed his hands to his mouth and rushed to the bathroom.
Sherlock turned around to look the man sitting next to him in the face. He took a deep breath. And again. And once more before answering." I-I-I'm sp-speak.... s-speaking w-wor-worse t-than f-four year-old!" He managed to say between the stutters. With every single syllable, his chin tightened and flexed, as if he had cramps. His fallen cheeks flushed pink.
" So... Tell me again what are we doing here?" Asked Sherlock as he was sitting on the big boulder, even though he was absolutely aware of where they were and with WHO...
" John..." He whispered, his voice sounded exhausted but relieved. It was just a dream, he was on Baker Street, with John, safe...
Sherlock sighed in relief when his hungry stomach calmed down again and he ran his hand through his black well-cultivated hair, glad that at least his dark curls were spared the damage. Quite the opposite in fact, the quality of them got maybe even better with the new diet he was forced to follow during his time in Appledore.
His tummy looked like a small barrel as it bulged out of his torso and crammed inside his very snug trousers, and the way his hips and bottom squeezed between armrests of the black armchair made him feel like a sardine.
But the detective didn't listen, he rose up from the armchair and started to pace around the living room like a man man. " My dear brother must be enjoying this! Because he's finally the thinner one, am I right?
The crime-solving consultant turned towards the unit, took out the two-litre bottle of the Coca Cola and the empty glass from the cupboard and filled it with the sparkling drink.
John turned around in the armchair to shot his friend with a death glare. " Are you trying to tell me that I'm too old for that? Unlovable?!" He snarled.
The bedside lamp met the glossy surface with a loud crack and the satisfying sound of shattering glass filled the room. The lamp hit the floor, soon accompanied by the big mirror which tumbled from the frame on Sherlock's wardrobe and smashed into sharp fragments.
" Someone's jealous... Don't give yourself false hopes! You know, John told me that he can't wait to move out... You're boring, he said..." Mary said in a sweet voice and her words affected the detective more than any of her grips and smashes. It was enough for him to lose attention.
John smiled unhappily and ruffled his blond-grey hair. " Not in the mood? That's two of us..." He said as he leaned over the doorframe. " Guess what? Mary found out... She found out about you."
He took out his old phone he got from Harry and opened it with a password ( which offended Sherlock with its banality. First three times John changed it - into another banal password according to the detective, but now he gave up his attempts to think out a password Sherlock wouldn't figure out.).
John rushed to him and pressed him against his chest, wrapping his muscular arms around his thin ducked figure.  " How could such a stupid nonsense come on your brilliant mind, Sherlock? Do you really think that I'm going away from you? " John's little smile faded.
And speaking about his flatmate - he was worried about what could that clodpole damage this time... He looked very disgruntled when realising John had a date. John hoped that he won't ruin his date, for once...
Fortunately, the doctor was fast enough to bend down his head just in time and dodge out of the reach of Sherlock's clenched fist that would certainly hit him in the jaw if he hadn't moved away.
" This is a quite amusing way to stop your garrulous mouth..." The ex-soldier whispered, caught the black strand of curly hair in his short fingers and swept it away from Sherlock's eyes.
" Why did you c-come?" The detective asked when he finally sat in the car and Mycroft fastened the seat belt across him.
He had no idea what he had ever done to deserve such a great and kind human being as John Watson was. The good doctor somehow managed to stay even though Sherlock still 'sulked' in his room, refusing to poke out his head from his shelter.
The detective knew he was defeated, he didn't want John to feel bad. " N-no, I-I-I-I'm n-not a-angry wi-with y-you... Do-do-don't wa-want y-you t-to he-hear m-me li-like th-this..." He whispered in a weepy voice, it was embarrassing for him to speak like that.
" I just needed some time to process everything, Sherlock! Because when the man, who died in front of my very eyes suddenly appears in London as if nothing has happened is really bit not good! Do you have any idea how horrible those two years have been for me?! What I went through?! How miserable I felt? I guess you don't!" He growled through gritted teeth. Just saying these words sent him back to times when he felt like an utter mess, to days filled with much bigger loneliness and shock than he had ever witnessed - and he thought he was in bad state when he returned from Afghanistan.
To John's bad luck, his phone vibrated again and there was no doubt the woman heard it. Her face curled in annoyance and disgust. John knew this kind of face, and it didn't seem good for him. Not at all...
John rushed into the living room, red in his face. He looked a bit angry. " What is that?" He stuck the thing in front of flatmate's face.
" Morning! How are you feeling?" John greeted him and approached the bed where his friend rested, leaned against the headboard with a book in his lap.
The doctor did his best to get control over his face and opened his mouth to say something, but before he had time to utter a word, the detective continued.
Sherlock flinched wildly and tried to pull away from him with such savagery he almost fell down. " I-I-I'm fine!" He growled and did his best to straighten up.
Sherlock was watching his friend with heavy, tired eyes, though his brain worked on the top gear, considering his options.
" Apologies..." He said and reached out his hand to put it on the top of Susan's, which rested on the snow white lace tablecloth. Their skins were millimetres away from each other, they felt the heat radiating from each other body. They felt like a magnet, their fingers almost brushed, the bolts outside lighted the interior and emphasised the atmosphere... they were so close... And then...
The detective still gaped at him with a surprised face, he couldn't understand why John wasn't panicking? Or screaming? Or cursing? John would do something like that...
"You're back early..." He panted when he realised that there's nothing left to throw up, sat down next to the toilet and leaned his head on the cold wall of the bathroom. He let out a sigh when the cool wall tiles chilled his back covered in unpleasant, sticky sweat.
Detective entered the flat and immediately understood what Lestrade meant when he said that John could be in danger.
" Surprised, yeah, I know..." Greg finished, knowing very well what was John talking about. It was hard to believe that Sherlock Holmes was just a human after all...
" It will be okay, I promise..." John cooed, rested his chin on the top of Sherlock's head and wrapped his arms tightly around Sherlock's wide waist, just holding him in a tight embrace.
But John didn't want to let Sherlock get his way, not today. Fortunately, he has lived with Sherlock Holmes long enough to be familiar with Sherlock's convincing techniques, he already knew what to expect from him.
He couldn't stand the sight of his hands with fingers similar to tiny sausages which used to be thin, delicate and elegant.
Sherlock let out the breath he didn't even know he was holding and collapsed on his big comfy bed, laying back on the soft mattress. He covered his face with his hands and closed his eyes as he let out a quiet groan of frustration.
Sherlock took out the phone, took a look at the display, frowning at the name of the caller and accepted the call.
When the darkness fell completely, they were offered to see the night sky filled with stars so bright they could count them.
" Well, that's... it was supposed to be a jumper... I... I wanted to throw it away...I tried so hard, I did my best to make this... To compensate a little bit you that yours which I've damaged... I hoped it would look good but... I failed..." Sherlock's voice faded as he admitted his failure.
Okay, maybe the part where he came to the restaurant and ruined John's romantic dinner wasn't a thing he would be proud of, (za rámeček by si to nedal) not to mention that teasing about his horrible mustache... He just wanted to see his friend smile after such a long time of separation.
John blinked a few times as he understood what Sherlock just told him. " What? What?!" He raised his voice.
" Oh, Sherlock... You have no idea how much you mean to me, do you? It's such a shame you can't see yourself the way I see you... You're such a special person, one of the most important humans in my life... You saved me so many times in so many ways, and I let you think that I have abandoned you... How can I deserve someone like you?"
He felt so pathetic for losing control over himself, but the nightmare felt so real! For a while, he really thought that he was back in Appledore, that everything was just a nice dream and he was still stuck with that psychopath!
The uncertainty of what was going on with that lunatic genius preyed on his mind and created the most horrible scenarios, one worse than the other.
The rhythm of the detective's runaway heart started to return into its natural rate as he finally began to calm down and finally got his runaway breath in the control.
John folded his hands on his hips and his normally calm voice raised in irritation at Sherlock's behaviour.
The familiar smell of the expensive shampoo, tea and smoke felt soothing and comforting and John's heart swelled with a strange feeling he could not identify. Knowing that he wasn't alone in this, even though he yelled on his friend to go away gave him such courage as if he could do anything, with Sherlock by his side.
He still saw hoards of food on the big wooden table that waited for him to eat it up, he still heard the cruel laughter and nasty insults of his tormentors, he still felt the mixed food pour through the big tube right down his gullet and cumulate inside his stomach, making it bloat nearly to the point of bursting!
Unfortunately for him, John wasn't prepared to give up. " Look, you should eat regularly, otherwise it can cause more harm than good..."
" I'm sorry, John... That milk wasn't put-up on you, I swear... Trust me that I did not arrange it..." Sherlock blurted suddenly, unable to hold back his guilt.
Sherlock wanted to say that he's not hungry, but that was a very transparent lie, even for John... But maybe if he ignored him, the soldier would let him be...
Sherlock struggled to make a nasty grin. He didn't want to hurt him, but he was so scared... " Really? Did you get it from a tooth fairy?"
" If you're naughty, then your little secret won't be a secret anymore. You don't want these photos to end in John's phone, do you?"
The detective was numb with cold so it took him a few seconds to realise that somebody was slapping his cheek gently and frantically calling his name.
" Shush, you silly. I couldn't be bored of you even if I wanted to... Furthermore, I'm a doctor, I know the best... We can do it, you'll see..." The short man swore him.
Because the brilliant Sherlock Holmes is fat like a pig for slaughter, you can tell him that he got what he wanted!" He was almost screaming now, his hands were shaking and the period between inhales and exhales were significantly shorter than it was considered as normal.
John woke up, feeling incredibly hot and sweaty, his black-and-white striped jumper stuck to his skin and clung to his torso like a magnet.
" What?" The detective asked without much interest when he heard an unpleasant voice behind him, followed by two other set of footsteps, and he didn't need to be the world's first Consulting Detective to tell what was going to follow. This wasn't going to be a nice conversation...
John Watson was sitting at the furthest table in the restaurant, right beside the window. He took the glance outside to the street. The pavement shone like silver, because of the heavy rain which kept falling from the dark sky. His watches told him that it was quarter past eight, it was quite early for the darkness to fall, but it was logical - the dark clouds accumulated the thick layer which didn't allow the sun to penetrate through it.
Slapping her hand away, he glared daggers at her, fed up with her self-confident tone. He had to tell him! John had to know that he's in danger, for God's sake! He couldn't risk his wellbeing, he would never forgive himself if something had happened to his best friend.
The ex-soldier was cachectic and almost lifeless, he seemed to be ten years older at least... His blond hair was embroidered with greying one, his round cuddly face looked fallen, there were dark violet bags under his tired ocean-blue eyes from the lack of sleep. He definitely had to drop some weight, about seven pounds. It didn't feel right, it wasn't his John anymore. The worst of all was a cane in his right hand, he was heavily leaning over it to keep his balance. His limping was back...
Sherlock sat in his armchair in the flat in 221B Baker Street and stared sadly into the fire, the shock and exhaustion completely transformed his face and made him look much older and vulnerable.
But who would want to hurt him? John Watson was the kindest, bravest and most loyal man he has ever met, he tried to get on with everybody.
That git! That cheeky apparition afforded himself to sit in his armchair... But it looked quite down today, he was curled into the ball, he seemed much skinnier and smaller than yesterday. He decided to let him be.
Sherlock's hair stood up on end and he knew that he had to get out of here, but before he could take a step, he felt himself being slammed into the block of flats so strongly his head bumped into the wall.
His violet lips were ajar, he breathed through them rapidly. His breath shook wildly, it sounded too fast and too shallow for normal respiration. It didn't show any signs of calming down, it grew even faster if possible...
Mrs Hudson's weeping grew louder, which made the doctor run down the stairs, nearly tumbling from the staircase.
Sherlock took off his favourite Belstaff coat and hanged it over the backrest of the kitchen chair. He cocked his ear to hear some noise out of the bathroom, but there no sound came... He wasn't sure if it was a good sign or the bad one.
John's eyes widened, and if it wasn't such a serious situation, it would be quite funny... That idiot couldn't be serious, could he?
The drive took almost an hour and a half to get to the destination they wanted to but it was worth it. The change in the environment was dramatic. As if they had visited some kind of new, unknown world. It was so calm, so peaceful, so free...
John couldn't help himself but think how paternal Greg looked right now, he would never have thought how much the DI cared about their Consulting Detective. " I know..." He nodded and they both paused in their thoughts.
The look of pure terror ran across his face and his heart almost stopped beating as he realised what it meant.
Actually, the jumper was more than unsightly. It was shapeless, irregular and holey, but John was absolutely stunned. Sherlock gave up his precious time and instead of a solving crime, he knitted him a jumper in exactly the same colour as the previous one.
Then there was a shocked expression of Mrs Hudson when he had stumbled into the flat, leaning heavily onto his brother and Greg, not being able to stand still. His senses betrayed him completely, making him feel numb, unable to think, speak or even move. His thick legs shook like trunks in the windstorm and his knees refused to obey as they tried to send him to the floor.
The psychosomatic limp started to come back in his right leg and made his already bad days even more gloomy. He had lost all his interests, there was no fun without the crazy but good detective. Everything he did, everywhere he went, reminded him of his friend so much! John had to move out from Baker Street, he wasn't capable of living in the empty flat, where everything in there screamed 'Sherlock is dead' at him.
" Susan, I'm sorry for such a miserable evening... The next date won't be like this..." He swore in a panting voice.
Sherlock's fingertips kept sliding all across his stomach, and when he was sure that John doesn't mind, his palm slipped under the white top.
But what mattered the most, he was his FRIEND. He cared about the crazy detective like nobody else, he would do almost anything for him (he had killed for him to save his life, how many people can say that?) and he would never judge him for the way he looked like.
When they pulled out of each other, Sherlock wrapped his arms around John and snuggled closer to him. He was quite soft and warm, Sherlock could stay like this all day...
" You've got to be kidding me! Are you trying to tell me that I have drunk a glass of milk mixed up with some bloody bodily fluids?!" He boomed, immediately feeling sick again.
Sherlock's eyes, encircled with a row of long dense lashes and decorated with dark violet bags, sparkled unhappily when his mind decided to throw him to the herd of painful and humiliating memories he had experienced in the Appledore.
" If you're feeling up to tell me, I'm here for you... But first, let's get you out of those wet clothes, you'll catch a cold..."
Sherlock froze as the flash of memory ran in front of his eyes, triggered by the order. He knew that John didn't mean to say it harshly, he just did his best to concentrate. He was used to those changes, he had been treated by John many times - during their cases, he inflicted himself lots of injuries. But the latest events left him nervous and cautious about everything, there were so many triggers causing flashbacks of the worst moments in his life.
Very slowly he reached out his arm and put it on the curve of Sherlock's stomach, which was bulging under the duvet. He spread his fingers and gently rubbed his palm against the quilt cover.
In a few fast strides, the grey-haired policeman blocked Sherlock's way and tried to think of the fastest way to calm down his stressed friend before he'll collapse.
The doctor could see that Sherlock tried to do as he said, but it was no use. " Can't..." He let out a loud breathless groan. His teeth chattered, he was hypothermic without doubt, and he pressed his thighs to his torso as close as possible.
" Oh my goodness! Who did this to you?! You look horrible, darling!" He heard a shocked, teary voice belonging to Mrs Hudson. There was so much love in it, he was like a son for her.
So what do you think? I have my own experience with food anxiety so I understand how horribly Sherlock feels. Thank you for your previous comments and kudos, I love you!
" I don't have an eating disorder, eating is boring..." The detective immediately defended himself. He felt no desire in eating, the digestion slowed him down.
The monotone voice said and John quickly tore off his eyes from the detective's fuller figure, looking up into Sherlock's face. For a fragment of second he spotted insecurity in those expressive eyes, but it could be just an imagination - because Sherlock's eyes immediately narrowed into a controlled and reserved expression and his lips pressed into a tight line, draining of blood.
" Sleep well, my stubborn detective... I'll protect you..." The doctor spoke softly when he was sure that the man was sleeping. In the complete silence, he watched his peaceful features, his calm, smooth eyelids, relaxed facial muscles, his cheeks so soft as the baby's bottom, slightly smiling lips. He listened to his steady breath, gazed at his rising and falling chest, he could easily count every inhales and exhales.
" How are you feeling?" John's head rose up as he registered the deep baritone coming out of Sherlock's room.
" I'm going with you..." He said instead and put the book aside so he could get up from the bed. There was a sparkle in detective's heterochromic eyes in hope of getting the traitor who pretended to be John's nice girlfriend in the jail.
Sherlock stared on his phone at least five minutes, his head completely empty. John didn't want him anymore... How could he ever think that somebody could love him? Or care about him at least? A huge wave of self-loathing almost suffocated him. They were right about me, they always were. After all, I'm an only sociopath, freak, emotionless machine...
Then he remembered the glass resting on the bed table, took it in his fingers and reached out his arm towards his friend.
" Nobody knows that, not even doctors. You have to be patient, it won't heal from the day-to-day..." Mycroft told him the not-easy-to-ears truth.
But John paid no attention to the shattered dish, he was busy with staring at his best friend with wide, astounded eyes.
John hurried towards his flatmate and landlady, his face crumpled with worries. " Jesus! What happened?! You look like a mess!" He exclaimed and reached out his arm to touch Sherlock's shoulder.
After a few unsuccessful attempts to calm down, he finally gave his emotions a free hand and released the bitter sobs from his tight throat.
Sherlock would be lying if he said that he didn't want to be something more than John's friend, but he had no right to push John into something he didn't want to.
He was shaking again, this time not only because of the fear, the goosebumps told John that he was also cold.
Turning around, he found his friend standing in the doorframe, leaning against it nonchalantly, wearing black sweatpants and grey short-sleeved t-shirt. The doctor didn't have to be genius to see what a pretence it was and how much effort it had to cost him to leave his room.
The bubble of laughter escaped John's lips as he watched the man beside him, his pale face glowing in the dark. " Don't be so self-satisfied, not everything turns around you..." He paid him back in his own, his mouth widening in the smile.
The detective complained, he needed some distraction from horrible images of memories in his head! He wanted to feel like himself again, to solve crimes and chase criminals with his companion!
John rubbed the bridge of his nose. It was as if he was talking to a child, how could this man be so stubborn?!
" Sherlock, for once - please, stop acting like a child and let me finish. You've got it absolutely wrong... No one is going to make fun of you, your brother is simply concerned about your health and safety..."
John gave his friend a patient look, the look designated especially to him. The good doctor would deserve a halo, he must have been a saint when living with the High-Functioning Sociopath and not strangling him yet. God knows that sometimes he wanted to... " We're in the campsite, we decided to camp out with Lestrade and your brother..."
John sighed and let his thoughts run freely in his head. After a few moments of associations, they stopped at the topic they always did. At Sherlock, of course...
The detective shook his head and did his best to get a grip of himself, there was no point in self-pity, he better should do something about it." John, I really appreciate your offer, but I would like to go now..."
And then Mary appeared. She was just an ordinary woman who didn't remind him of his late flatmate. She was kind, understanding and quite funny, she was always there for him when he needed support.
The detective didn't even bother with switching on the light, (the last thing he wanted to see was his naked, swollen body) and started to strip off the restrictive clothes he was wearing.
As it seemed, he won't be given the answer - Sherlock continued to shake like an aspen in the wind and closed his eyes shut as he tried to sent the anxiety away. " John..." He whined when he failed.
John really didn't want to include Mycroft, but as it seemed, it was inevitable. He knew that he couldn't force his friend to do something he didn't want to, but something HAD to be done.
Sherlock groaned again and his arms wrapped tightly around his round belly and squeezed it with a pained whimper.
John shoved his hands into pockets of his jeans, feeling bad for his first reaction. " I didn't mean to stare and make him uncomfortable... I was just so-"
He raised his head when both hands cupped his belly in a completely different way than during the examination.
When John returned to Sherlock's room with a cup of coffee and some breakfast, he found his friend sitting on the bed, freshly showered and changed into another pair of sweatpants, white t-shirt and his old blue dressing gown.
Something in his face must have caught John's attention, because he slid his hand behind his back, enfolded him in his strong arms and leaned on the headboard of the bed. " Sherlock? Hey, it's okay, come here..."
" I understand what you're going through, but unlike me, you have so many people who care about you, no matter what! Don't shoo them away if you don't want to lose them..."
As it seemed, he really thought so. Greg knew that the Consulting Detective never had many friends, but he really didn't expect him to think so little about himself and the people around him. What had they done to him?
But why did John listen to him? He didn't have to be there, Mycroft would be stupid if he held the soldier somewhere against his will - after all, everyone has an instinct of self-preservation...
The British Government sat down beside him and put his hand lightly on his bony shoulder. " Let me take a look, will you?" He asked he didn't want his brother to feel worse than he already was.
Mycroft's eyes widened in a shock. He hated this word, Sherlock suffered badly in the past, wasn't it enough? " What are you talking about? You're not a freak, Sherlock... Did John call you like that?"
John turned around to look at his friend and his heart clenched as he saw the desperate detective. The fear of being alone mirrored in his beautiful eyes and John simply couldn't say no to this puppy face.
John turned his head and was a bit surprised to hear his friend beg. But on the other hand, the detective needed support in these days and the fact he pleaded for it made that need even bigger.
Detective's eyes watered, blood ran down from his nose and he felt a nasty metallic taste in his mouth, but he refused to give up. He squeezed her wrists, ignoring her nails that dug into his skin. There had to be some way to get out of this mess!
The detective rolled his eyes in his usual expression. " What? I'm not completely incapable, John. I know how to shop..."
John smiled, confused. Throw Sherlock, Baker Street and all their adventures away? Never! " You silly... Why would I do that? "
Lestrade put his hands on Sherlock's broadened shoulders and waited for him to raise his head and look him in the face.
Without his friend John felt like nothing, things returned to its old way, maybe even worse than before.
The detective raised his eyebrow and looked him up and down with a critical and a bit surprised face. " John, you were a soldier, you should know how to build a tent, you were in Afghanistan!"
The quiet comforting bubbling of Thames stroked their ears and filled them with peace and calmness, as it flowed through the spacious green meadow, just sparsely populated with the few tents. The campsite was filled with trees, which were spread randomly around the whole area.
John's hands wandered across Sherlock's abdomen, giving some places a light press, some spots just a caress. He told him to take deep breaths, asked if he doesn't feel any sting in the area of the ribcage and just to be sure he palpated his ribs that hid under the thick layer of the fat.
John Watson was more precious than his dignity. So whatever she had prepared for them, he would swallow that to keep his doctor safe.
He needed his blogger, he'd be lost without him. Somehow, he managed to get a bit addicted to his flatmate, the thought of going to the crime scene made him feel insecure. He didn't like that, he was Sherlock Holmes, emotion-free man, the High Functioning Sociopath...
" But if you'll keep your mouth shut, then you'll have nothing to worry about..." The blonde said, rose up on her feet and dusted her trousers. " Well, that's all for now... It was great to see you again, Sherly!"
Mary will never let him go, not when he possessed the thing she needed so much. She tripped his knees up so the detective ended on the ground, face-first to the pavement. Bending next to him, she dug her fingers into the back of his neck and pressed his head to the cold concrete.
He was about to search the kitchen and other parts of the flat when the silent whisper alerted him he wasn't alone in the room.
He put Sherlock's favourite mug back and made himself a really strong coffee. He desperately needed it today.
John stood there, not able to say a word, he simply gazed at redhead's disappearing figure He didn't know what was worse - if she left him, standing there like a fool or the fact she might have a truth.
Ostentatiously, Sherlock turned his head to the left and stared at the wet pavement from the window, obstinately avoiding Mycroft's gaze. " Are you mocking me or you're just trying to say something?" He snapped and wrapped his arms around himself to keep at least the rest of his dignity.
It was the only piece of his former clothing he managed to fit in, relatively... The blue fabric clung to his engorged torso and made him look like an overgrown snake whose skin was about to slough off.
Sherlock yelped and his face went white like chalk when something hard hit him in his belly. It was Mary's knee.
John didn't understand that, he was a doctor - he has seen a lot of injuries and the excess weight was nothing compared to them.
He could understand that Sherlock might give the impression that he didn't care about what people think, but that wasn't quite a truth. Sherlock's self-esteem has deflated significantly during two years he has been away and his insecurity even strengthened by the rapid and large weight gain.
John realised that his last message was quite cruel, reminding Sherlock that he was single and the only person who managed to live with him, was John himself. But on his defence - he found the interrupting really annoying.
Sherlock gasped, he didn't expect that. Well, he didn't even dare hope for this and there he was, laying inside the sleeping bag with the man who used to be in the military, declared himself as a straight and managed to live with him for longer than a week. In short, he was kissing the man he has fallen in love with since the first day they met.
As he continued caress John, he noticed that his tanned skin was tightened and his belly felt bit bloated, it had to be from that stupid experiment. The wave of self-anger swelled inside him again.
" Of course I came..." The soldier took a few steps closer to the source of the voice and then he spotted him.
John leaned over the doorframe and looked at his friend who sat on his big bed. " It's better, thanks..." He said and then a small yawn escaped his mouth.
He was exhausted, broken and depressed. Everything went well until stupid Serbia! He was runaway all the time, but he was so dumb that he let himself to get imprisoned! They kept him captured for almost two months! Those months filled with torture and loneliness were the worst ones in his life.
" And what are you doing here? No, don't answer that, I know exactly why you're here... This is Mycroft's work, isn't it? Why can't he just let me be, I'm adult, not an invalid, I'm well capable of taking care of myself! I don't need him to poke his big nose into my business and make decisions for me! I don't need all of you fuss over me, I'm not made from porcelain! So turn around, both of you, and leave me alone!"
Sherlock's slowly fading voice turned into a whisper. " They wanted to know where to find you, but I haven't told them. I would never ever betray you, I had to keep you safe... "
A shuddery breath escaped his lips when he opened the door and saw his room for the first time after those long agony-filled months.
The water dripped from his black hair, his dark curls were completely soaked, the wetness made them straighten and fall alongside his face, framing a huge graze on his right cheek. He barely kept his eyes open, his eyelids were closing against his will, he seemed to be able to fall asleep while standing.
How could he do that to him?! He knew that his brother could be a pain in the butt, but he never expected him to be THAT cruel. Mycroft knew very well that Sherlock doesn't want John to see him like this (because his stupid big brother always knows everything!) and yet he still sent John to 'check if he's alright'! Sherlock grimaced at the irony of that statement, damn Mycroft and his stupid power complex!
He would lay there the whole day if he could, but his bladder began to demand a visit to the bathroom.
" I don't want to be a burden..." Sherlock whispered and dropped the stone mask he wore the whole time, revealing how broken, shaken and exhausted he was.
" I wasn't there the whole time, John would suspect me... I have to admit that Mr Magnussen did a fantastic job, what was he feeding you with? I've never considered being possible to gain so much weight in just a few weeks, but you're Sherlock Holmes, after all. Normal rules don't apply to you, do they?" Her lips bared her teeth in a wide smile and she better hid her phone back to the handbag, safe from furious detective's hands.
But today he didn't share his joy, he sat in his armchair, his back hunched, turned on the detective. He was sunk in the comfortable chair, but he felt everything but comfort.
Sherlock's eyes finally snapped open, a loud gasp escaped his throat and he sprang up into a sitting position so wildly he almost bumped his head against John's.
" I see... And that's why you have blood all over your face and you can't stand still, right?" Mycroft remarked sarcastically and wrapped brother's arm around his neck to give him some stability. He saw how much energy and effort it has cost him to hold his body upright, he won't let him fall just because of his stubbornness!
Some medication could cause a weight gain, but the detective didn't seem to have any symptoms of diseases which required that type of pills.
John couldn't stand seeing his friend like that. He began to get up and ran his hand through Sherlock's wet hair. " Hold on..." He told him and rose up on his feet.
Sherlock's crippled back was a mess! It was covered with an uncountable amount of scratches, welts, wounds and dark violet. There almost wasn't a spot without any injuries. Some of them were inflamed and some even infected.
John heard him like this only in very rare moments, so it was quite surprising to see the detective hesitate. Then he understood and the corners of John's lips curled upwards and soon he felt himself smiling like an idiot. He knew exactly what Sherlock wanted. That git...
The man in the sitting room was absolutely huge, his weight seemed to be the most striking thing in the room, sticking out like a sore thumb.
The weary detective felt heavy and solid against John's chest and his body radiated such a warmth the ex-soldier could feel it even through three layers of clothing. Sweat and tears started to leak through the soldier's striped jumper and John just watched the poor man tremble in chills, pain and embarrassment.
But John continued. " Very good at shooting - but not as good as me - it would hurt my ego... A bit dotty, I suppose... But actually, there's a little detail - it wouldn't be a woman... And her name would be Sherlock..." He almost whispered and dared to look in Sherlock's face.
It was surprising that there wasn't a steam coming out of John's ears. " I see it's a jumper, I'm not blind... But THIS!" He pointed on the huge hole in the middle part.
John read the last message and decided to ignore him. He locked his phone, putting it down on the table.
As Sherlock stared at the mess he has done, the sick feeling and the exhaustion after almost three days lack of sleep took hold of him. With a last disgusted glance at the pile on the ground, he collapsed into his bed and curled into a tight ball, finally falling into a restless slumber.
Sherlock dried himself and attempted to put on his sweatpants, but they didn't even reach his waist. The legs of the bottoms hardly reached the midway of his thighs and refused to be dragged higher.
The woman sneered and put her hand in her handbag. " You'll change your mind as soon as you see what you're risking, trust me..." She took out her phone and shoved it under Sherlock's nose.
" Take off your clothes, will you? It's not good for you to sit in those wet ones... I'll bring you something dry..." John said and immediately started to look for something the plump detective could wear. The room was very spacious, he never noticed that before. Could it be that Sherlock has moved some things to make more room? But for what?
The fury still raged inside him and showed no signs of stopping soon. Sherlock knew that he had to do something before he goes mad. Throwing his legs against the edge of the bed, he got up on his feet and started to pace around the room.
" Of course..." John smirked. What a cheeky git..." What I want to say is that you have some characteristics which aren't very nice, but come on - everybody has! Remember that nobody's perfect... "
Sherlock seemed to be in such a shock he didn't even protest and let his flatmate take off his shirt.
" Keep your shitty nose out of my fucking business! " John snapped venomously and turned on his heel.
" Do you mean it?" Sherlock asked, his voice sounded young and uncertain, the nervousness changed his baritone from the 'I'm the best know-it-all' tone to the 'I'm not sure if I'm welcomed'...
John let out a tired sigh and rolled his eyes, as he made a few steps towards two brothers. " God, you can be a pain in the butt sometimes..." He commented and hoped they will stop so they could relax and enjoy the weekend.
One lonely tear escaped Sherlock's eye. " Th-Thank y-you Jo-John..." He whispered. He was so grateful to his blogger. He grabbed his hands into his and looked into the ex-soldier's face.
She raised her eyes and gave him a smile as well. But she was careful not to show her teeth, because of her braces, she was very sensitive about her slightly crooked incisors and canines. But John didn't mind, it was completely normal - nobody's perfect.
The tall man thought for a while before closing his eyes. " I'm sorry about it, you liked her a lot..." He mumbled quietly and he really meant it. He wanted John to be happy, even though he was jealous. He deserved it, after all, he got through...
Sherlock nodded slightly and closed his eyes when he felt nauseous from the movement. " She's after you..."
But it was completely understandable that he didn't want to give up on it, it was the only piece of clothing which made him feel like himself. And God knew how much John wanted Sherlock to be himself again!
Suddenly, Sherlock's vision turned red. He couldn't take it anymore. " Where would you be without me? You would do nothing but sitting on your butt in a little room of yours, limping and whining about the tremor of your left hand! "  Sherlock pressed his hand to his mouth, horrified. He immediately wanted to take his words back, he knew that he had gone too far. " John... I'm sorry... I didn't - "
John took out his keys and opened the door. They walked in, took off their shoes and coats and went inside.
I'm so sorry for the beginning, I know it was quite cruel from me and Sherlock. I hope that I've compensated it a little bit with the second part.
In order not to interrupt the detective's well-deserved sleep, he carefully untangled himself from Sherlock's grip and released his legs from the jumble of their limbs which reminded him of headphones cable.
Sherlock's torso looked incredibly thin and pale as if nobody cared of him. Unfortunately, that was a truth, the detective refused to eat and also sleep during the cases. Which was often... John swore himself that he'll take better care about this ridiculous man.
Sherlock tried to protest, but this time he gave up quickly. He let himself be led through the flat, trusting John with all his heart. He felt so safe with John's strong, muscular arm around him, he knew that he would cover his back no matter what. Sure, he felt really self-conscious about his figure, especially when the soldier stood so close, not to mention held him... But he was too exhausted to do something about it right now.
Anderson perfectly succeeded this time and he had gotten what he deserved. Sherlock felt a deep satisfaction when he watched him curse and press his hands to his bleeding face.
John cupped his face into his hands. " We'll make an agreement - we won't go to the speech therapist, BUT you will do everything I say, do you agree?" He asked, his tone was saying that he won't permit any exceptions. Sherlock couldn't do anything else but nod slightly.
The truth was, that in some way, Sherlock WAS jealous of his brother. Not only because he was the smarter one, but also he was in a happy relationship, which was getting visible on his waistline again (more than usual, Sherlock thought). He envied that Mycroft could sleep beside the man he loved, feel the warmth coming out of his lover's body...
Detective's mouth tightened into the thin line until his lips turned white. He knew exactly what was his brother talking about and it wasn't about the wounds covering his back. He shook his head resultantly, decided to not say a word.
" I'm flattered... I made the straight Three-Continent-Watson gay..." Said the detective, feeling like himself again. Although, John recognised the relief and joy in the teasing sentence.
He closed the door wildly, too resultantly they slammed with a loud bang. He tried to stop them as soon as he realised what he was doing, but it was too late to stop them from making the wham.
The army doctor opened his mouth to say something, but before he was able to produce a sentence, Sherlock was already fast asleep.
Sherlock felt his face curl with shock when he realised what was John saying. " Y-you me-mean t-to ki-ki... kill yo-yourself?"
A sudden contact startled him and only really firm nerves stopped his military reflexes from punching the person in the face. Turning around, he found the DI Lestrade standing next to him, holding his shoulder to calm him down.
Sherlock backed off from him, he stumbled backwards with raised hands as if he was giving up. " I-I th-thought y-you tru-trusted m-me... "
The soldier said in a firm voice and watched the tension melting from Sherlock's frame. He paused, giving him some time to digest everything he said before he continued.
Sherlock took a deep breath before answering. It was there, he had to say it. His heart began to pound faster. " 'Ca-cause I-I-I'm n-not an i-illu...il-llusion..."
I know that you'll probably hate me, but I got a bit stuck with my story and when I read it again and again, I realised that I'm not happy with the development of the story.
But yesterday, when he stood at the crime scene again, he forgot about everything that happened to him... For a few moments, there was no Magnussen, no doubts about himself or fears.
" I love you too, you annoying stubborn git..." mumbled John and grinned at the detective. He bowed down his head to press his forehead onto Sherlock's. " You need to rest now. Don't move. "
Greg Lestrade rolled his eyes at the plump detective who waddled towards his armchair and sat down, doing his best to avoid staring.
His mind started to fill with theories and logical links and he could feel the adrenaline spread into his body, circulating in his veins, filling him with excitement and encouragement. He was finally in his element, his Work was like a breathing to him, he couldn't function without it, no matter how much he tried to tell himself otherwise.
" I must have deleted that..." Sherlock shrugged his shoulders disinterestedly and rubbed the back of his head, thin fingers brushing the black soft curls of his raven hair.
Sherlock brought the soft cloth closer to his body, secretly inhaling John's scent. It smelled so nice. " Thank you..."
The kitchen looked alike - at that time it was a pigsty room, it was rather a laboratory than a room for preparing a food. When John came in, he couldn't believe his eyes. Tiles were swept and mopped, the trash was emptied. There were no test tubes and flasks filled with chemicals on their kitchen table or any dirty dishes in the sink. Kitchen unit used to be smudged, now it was shining with clearness. John took a sharp breath and rushed to the fridge, took the handle and opened it sharply. The disappointment almost knocked him down.
