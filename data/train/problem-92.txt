Sherlock carefully observed the assistants and Anthea as they laid down the equipment on the tables in the living room, his eyes flicking from place to place, but when Mycroft sauntered in, Sherlock focused on him.  If these two men weren't brothers, there was certainly a similarity about the mouth as they met each other's eyes.
Sherlock still hadn't managed to find himself a human with the flesh still on who had plowed a field without the aid of animals, but he was always hopeful.
"I've made a friendly little workplace bet with my boss. Perhaps you've heard of him? Bossy bastard, thinks the world of himself. Anyway, we made a bet, and I get to pick one of you to send back to Earth for five years to gather up a few stray demons for me. And if you collect them all, you get another chance at life. Which one of you should I pick? It's not much of a risk letting your soul out of my grasp. It was mine when you got here; it will be mine again soon enough. But I think if I send you, I'll get more souls that way. Mr Moriarty is always backing people into corners with nowhere else to turn. The wailing and gnashing of teeth, I like, but the amount of praying he causes is absolutely disgusting.  I can hear it from here."
Now this was even more confusing.  She didn't appear to be making a pass at him- he had seen that flicker of the eyes that generally meant the other party had decided he was gay.  But, if it got him out of paying for the candle, why not?  He put on a smile and said, "Why, thank you," and followed her.
Well, he knew chicken coops burned very hot.  Maybe pigpens also did.  He really should start carrying a lighter.  Sherlock opened the nearest closed storage shed and looked inside.  There were some half-used rags, and hanging from a set of welding tanks was a flint striker.  He sniffed the rags, and they seemed oily enough, so he squeezed the striker a few times, dropping sparks onto the rags.  He kept an eye on the pigpen as he sheltered the sparks.
He looked back to the main entrance of the office building.  Now there were four people filming him, and another two filming the gold drool pouring out of the broken window.  His foot was free.  Shoeless, but free.  Sherlock tilted himself backwards over his remaining trapped leg, but that only flexed the roof of the car, and made more shards of glass pop out of the windshield.
He hadn't felt any of the marks burn off him, so he checked.  They were all still there.  The right leg, and the ones on his chest.
Sherlock saluted her with the can, and had a sip.  It was extremely sweet, with an aftertaste he supposed would be more difficult to detect had it been cold.
Sherlock walked through the open door of room 116.  It was only a bedroom, not even an en suite bathroom, but looked as though it had been occupied for years.  A woman lay on the bed, unmoving.  She was very thin, and looked as though she had last updated her fashion sense in the mid-90's.  She wore a black t-shirt with the sleeves cut off, and worn black jeans that looked as though they had once been skin-tight, but now hung off her.  Her hair was all ratted up, so that it was hard to tell if her haircut was modern or far out of fashion.  She wore black fingerless gloves, and half a dozen necklaces.  Sherlock lifted a large cross and looked under it, then dropped it again, worrying he would melt it.  He waited a moment and nothing happened, so he poked at it, then set his hand on it.  Apparently this wasn't the same type of object as a saint candle or a church floor.
Sherlock considered that.  Presumably the demon hadn't done itself in, although there were certainly human murderers who would have done that sort of thing.  The pile seemed still now.  The shed wasn't exactly well-lit to start with, and the sun was getting lower.
They struggled, and Sherlock pushed the demon around so he was walking backwards towards Sherlock's coat.  The demon stepped backwards onto the coat, and wobbled, and Sherlock shoved him as hard as he could.  The demon stumbled backwards and fell onto his back, but he was up again in a moment.  But now Sherlock had a non-skid footing underneath himself, and he knew where to avoid stepping on the coat so as not to turn his ankle on the squash ball in the pocket.
"There's only the one big one.  There used to be more, but all the little ones went out of business.  There's only Kennedy Brown farms left."
The man in white and gold--Bennie apparently--said, "Father Philip.  I have an event to attend, but this gentleman would like to ask about demons."
The man walked towards him, and even though he hadn't been holding anything just a minute before, he held out a clipboard to Sherlock.
Sherlock walked back along the creek in the dark, just in case his phone decided to ring as he walked past, but it was no use.  The shiny black phone was lying somewhere amongst the shiny black river rocks, and he wouldn't find it in the dark, and he wasn't about to stay until daylight.  It would probably come back to him, anyway, like everything else from his pockets.  Sherlock went back to the car and drove away from the burning pig farm back towards Vancouver.
Moriarty stood and stuck his hand out to Sherlock. Moriarty's hand was warm and dry and felt like any other living human’s hand. Moriarty grinned at him in that mouthless way, and looked him right in the eyes. Moriarty winked.  Sherlock flinched away, somehow expecting Moriarty to shoot himself in the head again.
Sherlock undid his shirt to look at the area underneath where his shirt had been cut.  It had been cut, he had seen it.  Shirts didn't just sew themselves back together at night!  Well, while he had his shirt partway off, he might as well look at the tattoos, which clearly were still there.  Clearly.  Not a figment of his imagination.  Well, he was getting some looks from the people driving onto the freeway.  He had better move off and start looking for these "demons".
As they walked out of the grounds of the airport, the woman said, "I'm going to rent a room and take a shower.  See you when I run out of money."  She ambled off down the street, holding a plastic shopping bag.
He eventually managed to find a sword letter opener in one of the fancy corner offices.  He took a moment to look down through the floor-to-ceiling windows at the ferries and sailboats in the surrounding water.  There was even an old-fashioned sailing ship.
Don't do drugs, kids.  Some might use entheogens as spiritual seekers, but there are many reasons not try them.
Sherlock dashed out from behind the last concrete barrier towards the side of the tank, holding his coat strips in his hands.  The demon must have seen him, as the tank immediately turned its front towards him.  Sherlock was able to get to the side of the wheels and start feeding the coat rope in around the drive sprocket.  The tank suddenly turned back the other way, and the tank tread struck Sherlock in the forehead as he leaned in.  He stumbled backwards but kept his footing, and through the blood and tears he observed he could still see out of both eyes.  He wasn't defeated yet.
Sherlock jumped over one of the little metal fences in front of the niche of some dead person who had apparently once had money, so that he wouldn't be immediately visible.  He reached into his pockets.  There were still all the same things as usual.  One hand fell on the bump keys and one hand on the squash ball, and then an idea presented itself.  Sherlock took the keys off their ring as quickly as possible--his hands weren't shaking, that would definitely never happen to him--and then stuck them into the squash ball so that they stuck point out, as equally spaced around the surface of the ball as possible.
He went on in the same vein for quite some time, alpha males, femoids, women only want rich men, etc.  Sherlock laughed to himself to think that anyone could be so unobservant as to suppose that any woman had ever broken Sherlock's heart.  Sherlock mentally enumerated the differences between himself and the demon.  Sherlock didn't care about relationships, and if he had cared about relationships at all, he certainly wouldn't have cared about controlling the behavior of his partner.  No one had any obligation to him.  Every man in the world could walk past without giving him a second look.  This was getting tedious, but clearly the man was getting angrier and angrier and closer to making a mistake.
is written across his face in capital letters. Ironically, although this Mycroft doesn’t scare him either, John finds that for all his resemblance to a rather large penguin and his polite, slightly indifferent demeanour the man across from him makes him feel like a schoolboy who needs to watch his act.
John swallows. He may have thought of Sherlock’s looks at some level but he’s never thought of them out loud, as it were. He feels himself nodding his dazed agreement.
The third phenomenon engulfs the other two. Silence. Silence of the kind John hasn’t experienced since the desert. Only when you hear it in London, it’s not something that inspires contemplation like it used to, back in Afghanistan. It’s ghostly, unnerving.
Holmes takes his cigarette out of his mouth. “If you could translate ‘oh kay’ for me, I shall be much obliged to you.”
Intimate. That’s how calling John by his first name feels to Holmes—too intimate. Part of Holmes relishes it, but another feels very awkward about it. He keeps referring to the other John as ‘Watson’, not as ‘John’. They were so repressed in this era, it’s legendary. John would die if he had to lounge about at home dressed in a bloody three-piece suit. There were certainly no tracksuit bottoms in the wardrobe upstairs. Oh yes, Victorian manners and all that—Holmes must call the other man ‘John’ very, very rarely, probably in some very private situa—
Yet he is also completely unattainable, the way people are for those who will never, ever be their equals. It makes John feels terribly alone sometimes, but for Sherlock, it means separation on a whole new level, a deeper one. John knows only two people who are Sherlock’s equals and Sherlock considers them both enemies. The feeling of how isolated from the rest of humanity he must feel always ends up tugging at John’s heart more than his own pangs of loneliness.
Mycroft Holmes looks at him, deadpan, then turns to his brother. “He has the same propensity for action, I see, but a rather more unceremonious approach.”
This is what is happening with his thoughts when he sees the void in the fireplace. Uncontrollable thoughts, scattered, some of them never to be captured just like some of the sneaky pearls were never found. John is barely aware of jumping to his feet, gaping at the darkness that gapes back, then at Holmes, whose face seems to be made of lighting.
“I know you’ll forget,” Sherlock says, “but that’s not—No, I am not saying…It’s not because you’ll forget it.” He’s beginning to slur.
John brings Mycroft his cup, then returns to the table for his own. He stirs it carefully, the rare delicate clunk of the teaspoon touching the walls of the cup strangely soothing in how material it sounds. He then comes back to his place on the sofa.
“I took the liberty of asking Mrs. Hudson to prepare some breakfast,” Holmes continues. “Will you partake? I trust you have a Mrs. Hudson?”
He can’t expect to be faring any better under the circumstances. No one wakes up one morning and on the way to the tube thinks,
John gapes. He is about to protest that he wouldn’t go as far as calling Sherlock downright gorgeous, then he finds he actually would. Call him that. Sherlock gorgeous. Thankfully, Holmes continues, sparing John the humiliation of sitting there with his mouth open like a hungry chick. "You needn’t worry about me," Holmes says. "I can assure you that attractiveness is not even remotely a matter of concern for me—especially my own.”
“Mycroft,” the latter now says politely, yet warningly—the equivalent of Sherlock’s ‘Either tells us what happened or piss off!’
John knows these are very deep waters bridged over by unprecedented confidence, but can’t help the lopsided turn of his mouth.
“What?” John frowns. “How do you mean? Oh! No!” he exclaims. “She’s not…that. Most women in London wear make-up in the twenty-first century. It’s the norm.”
“Watson’s appearance is…to his advantage.” The nonchalant tone matches the features; a second longer and the man might look at his nails in a bored fashion.
Holmes gets up from the chair and leans back on the fireplace’s mantel, facing John. There is tension in his pose that mirrors what’s happening in John’s chest.
Holmes cocks his infernal eyebrow at him. “I can see your natural eloquence will find itself terribly restricted.”
Only to find himself choking again, this time on a mixture of fumes he can’t even begin to identify but none of them pleasant enough to really make him try. Somehow, unfathomably, they click well together with the curtains, the smoke, the sodding rearranged furniture, even the quiet.
at the exact same time as Holmes murmurs, “Incurably romantic!” under his nose. John tuts. “I don’t care what you think. I reckon chances are some sort of subconscious link takes place that makes you contact your brother each time.”
The weak autumnal rays of sunshine make dust seem to float serenely in the air, like something out of an old black and white photograph. John’s been watching it drowsily for about ten minutes. It’s fairly hypnotic. It’s also completely unproductive but that’s fine—it’s not supposed to be productive. John is supposed to avoid any mental strain and this feels good, a part of the healing process.
John, who must have nodded unconsciously, finds himself in the spotlight. “Yeah, um. No,” he says with devastating consistency. “I mean, I’ve seen it in films and I’ve read about it, but it’s more like fiction where I come from.”
“It is all very well for you to make such remarks, Mycroft, when you obviously have the advantage of me. You are in possession of some facts that I am not, so perhaps you will choose to enlighten me instead of questioning my mental faculties.”
The man himself looks different, too. Upstairs, in the somewhat dingy room, he still resembled the previous night’s apparition straight out a Victorian play. Here, he seems fleshier. He is younger than John’s first impression, but definitely older than Sherlock. His pallor is still unenviable; however, now the effect is largely dispelled by the hypnotic, shining eyes that follow John everywhere as John wanders about the room, peering at things or carefully touching them. Holmes’s fringe flops over his forehead and is occasionally combed back with a quick, sweeping gesture of his long fingers. His thin but expressive lips curl around vowels and cigarettes in an almost mesmerising fashion. His nose looks more patrician than beaky.
Amazingly, raising your voice at people works even better in this era. Holmes starts speaking straight away, but not before he’s given John a lopsided grin that John would have missed if he’d blinked.
“It’s a nuisance, of course, and it bothers Watson a great deal which makes it an issue for me as well. He is constantly worried about indiscretions. I’m afraid he is more concerned about my reputation and well-being than about his own. But when you’re known as an eccentric with no romantic affiliations and when the other party is an ex-military surgeon, adorned by a masculine bearing and his war wound, suspicion hardly ever visits, let alone lingers.”
The sole of Sherlock’s bare foot brushes along John’s ankle in a silent prompt. John sees stars at its wake; they arrange into letters, the letters into words.
John’s mum always used to say that his dad was a different person when he put some food in his belly. John is much the same. Full with Mrs. Hudson’s delicious offerings and having washed them down with a nice cup of coffee, he now wanders about the room again, feeling quite uplifted. The sound of horse hooves hits him and he heads towards the window, realizing he has actually avoided it so far.
It’s odd to hear his name said by Holmes. John isn’t a great detective himself, but he can sense that Holmes finds it odd, having to call him John. Odd, and somehow…
. In this case, that John is looking at a big, purposefully built TV studio set, or that the street has been transformed to serve as a filming location for a period drama.
“Sorry,” John mumbles his apology but privately protests. It’s not like it’s his fault that the first Sherlock Holmes decided to shack it up with the first John Watson. Then he thinks about facing the same dilemma: meeting Sherlock, then having to leave him and go back to his previous life, never to see him again. Fierce understanding of that first Sherlock rises in him, effervescent and grateful.
Sherlock. The second is the complete makeover their sitting room has undergone. There is some meagre light, weak and yellow, and under it, scarcely any pointers indicate that this is their sitting room at all. Even the fireplace seems sort of different, out of place.
John smiles, nostalgia sweeping through him once again. Odd, considering that less than twenty-four hours have passed since...
He feels a wave of nausea as sudden pressure booms inside his head, then terrific weariness replaces it. That same symphony of tiredness he felt when he was coming here, that same ode to the bone-deep need to sleep. The door seems to move closer once again. John blinks and sways back on his feet, hand instinctively reaching, reaching…
Mycroft’s breath is getting laboured. He leans back in his chair and his hand seems to clear an invisible spider’s web in front of his face. “So for the reason I mentioned earlier, you decided to stay,” he says, more calmly. “For its potential consequences
Mycroft turns to Holmes. “Apparently you did cross from one world into another, brother mine,” he says, waving a finger at him. “Well, you understand how I use the personal pronoun ‘you’ here for convenience, for it was indeed a version of you. And you did meet Doctor Watson, resulting in your refusal to leave the do—I mean, to return. Your crossing was a serious offence in the world you were coming from. I imagine it would be in any! Think of the chaos, think of the effects on causality! But it was never in your character to consider such matters. You’ve always been so wayward, Sherlock, not to mention criminally blithe about the bigger picture. Naturally, these would be qualities all your versions would have.”
John felt himself go scarlet and fixed Sherlock with a glare. Sherlock’s answering curly grin was positively Grinch-like in its smug satisfaction.
very fond of her. And it’s early days, but if she should get another job offer, taking her abroad, there is a chance she’ll say no. Or even that he’ll go with her.”
He supposed that he spent a good portion of that first, halting conversation simply staring at Sherlock, still wrapped in his coat and folded up on the sofa. Sherlock seemed just as unable to look away, and so for long stretches, the two of them would simply leave off speaking and kind of peer at the other.
“I know. I know why you did it. And I know you didn’t really have time to second guess yourself. And at least you didn’t stay away long. Jesus, imagine it. If you’d stayed—
of criminal intent. But for what purpose I could hardly determine without reconnaissance, and so I selected Jabez for the task.  He’s red as carrots.”
The room was humid and close; his black shirt clung uncomfortably under his arms, and was liberally covered in pale lint that reeked of the feverish gleam of new cars and showroom floors. Sherlock lifted his chin to eye the spaces where the walls joined into a slumping cavern of decay and inhaled the must and the soupy heat of a damp, enclosed space with high, broad, filmy windows. There was a roaring in his ears, but aside from the rush of his own blood, he could discern no other sounds. Closing his eyes, he tried to train his admittedly limited hearing outside the building, but whatever they’d given him made his lips numb—his scalp seemed oddly tender, too—and his hearing was… compromised, apparently.
Sherlock appealed to a very willing Ms. Merryweather for shelter for the eight beleaguered, and hugely pregnant, women; six were from the Ukraine and two had been brought from the Czech Republic. He spoke enough to translate their immediate needs to Jones, and explained to them that John was a doctor, asking them to allow him a brief examination in order to treat any injuries they might have incurred during their captivity.
“Well, shit,” Merryweather said, clearly dismayed. It was unusual to hear a woman in her sixties with pearls round her neck say such a thing, but Sherlock plowed on.
“I’m Paolo,” he burst out. “And. And this is Tabitha. We. We owe him some money, yeah, and so. Could you see he gets it?”
. At the end of which, they reviewed my handwriting, gave me a firm congratulatory handshake and ushered me into a little room and left me there with a cup and a magazine. Does any of this sound familiar?”
An undersized 16-year-old girl in jeans and a hoodie, Pakistani parentage, probably born in Romford, accompanied by a boy of 19 or 20, Italian, immigrated in his early teens, tall, heavily bearded, gay—
Although he considered himself quite worldly, somehow he’d never actually gotten off in a strange room by himself before. In his home, yes, of course, and when he’d lived by himself, his own settee had done very well for a toss, thanks, and hotels and basically any shower with a shred of privacy since his twelfth birthday, but as far as actual furnished rooms without beds or another person to make it interesting… Never.
Casting his mind back, Sherlock found that his last coherent memory involved flossing his teeth before climbing into bed after a tiresome evening spent feinting with Mycroft over several matters beneath his attention. John was at his new position for The Howard Foundation (and what, precisely, had that position
“I was drugged, I assume. Some new variant of Clonazepam. And kidnapping is generally ill thought of by policemen, last I knew.”
Morris, an older, owl-eyed gent, did see him, and seemed just as pleased to make his acquaintance as Spaulding.
“Your little Tabitha and her friend Paolo. He drives a van. Carpet delivery and installation. A clever way to smuggle a body. Is he in on the trafficking, then? Yes, obviously,” he decided. “But under duress.”
“With the help of coveted new fashion prodigy and designer Tabi Qureshi, Tom Hiddleston, Ewan McGregor and Jude Law have launched ‘Rory’, a line of leather goods for men of discerning taste and suave style…”
“Indeed,” Sherlock responded distantly, eyes already vague with calculation. Sherlock, at Baker Street, cat-eyed and lolling like a leopard on the settee. John grinned and flipped open his laptop, content with the world.
"Not your area," John finished for him. There was a flicker of hurt in his eyes, but he set his expression into something resembling cheer and clapped Sherlock's shoulder. "I don't doubt it.  Well, I'll ride back with them, then. I'm sure it's not a bad idea to have a medic on hand, just in case."
“Because of the five people I’ve yet discovered to be involved in this plot, not one of them read engineering at school.”
Mycroft sent a car upon Sherlock's request, and they settled in for a two hour ride to a seaside town outside of Brighton proper. Ringing off his call with Lestrade, Sherlock plugged his phone in to charge, and John asked, "So Vincent Spaulding is really this John Clay fellow?"
“Had you.” Sherlock found that he needed to clear his throat before he could continue. “Had you considered going with her?”
“It was a distinct possibility. These people have an unhealthy interest in eugenics, and any number of unsavory practices.” Sherlock’s lip curled. “My brother informs me that The Howard Foundation is a suspected clearing house for a particular kind of human trafficking. It looks like they’re branching out into some brand of breeding program as well.”
“Oh, a mere whimsy,” Holmes says. “I was trying to decide whether a lack of moustache on Watson’s face would make it easier to decipher him. On one hand, you, my dear fellow, might as well have handed me your thoughts on paper. On the other, Watson’s moustache has the most singular ways of expressing his feelings. There are innumerable little ways in which it shows when he’s angry or amused or concerned. Indignation is a particular favourite of mine.”
“But what if something’s gone wrong at their end,” John insists, panicky. “What if they can’t open it or—”
Holmes takes a drag from the pipe he was filling up while he spoke. He inhales and blows out the smoke in quite a exaggerated fashion.
“Sherlock is not considerate, trust me. You are so much more…” He pauses and lifts his head to wave a loose hand in Holmes’s general direction. “I can’t get over how you just are. The way you talk, you’re so polite. You sound like Mycroft, only like you really mean it.”
It takes him the time necessary to go to the table and pour himself a glass of water to identify what he is feeling.
Or would that be his foresight? He groans quietly and lifts the brandy to his right temple, pressing it there and relishing the cool, unyielding feel of the glass.
Holmes’s eyes are staking a claim to about a third of his face. “Am I…Is my counterpart the criminal?”
to. He…has to.” His outburst had sent John up on his feet, but he now drops back on the sofa, knees weak.
“It feels almost inappropriate to tell you to make yourself at home,” Holmes finishes. “But I shall ask for your permission to smoke.”
Prostrate on the floor in the landing, on top of each other, limbs and torsos contorted and tangled up in such a complicated fashion it was a surprise there were no actual fractures at separation. John’s memories from those first moments are extremely scarce and surreal. He remembers disorientation of epic proportions, the kind a toddler must experience after falling asleep in their mother’s arms in the bright afternoon, only to wake up in a changed world where the shadows have grown very long. John remembers the hardness of the wood floor beneath him. He remembers feeling the weight of his every cell.
Holmes eyes him for a long while and chooses to leave the last word to him. He does start moving aimlessly about the room, until he arrives next to John by the ill-drawered desk. He lifts some papers away to reveal his violin underneath.
the eyes are, what with the scant light and with his own eyes watering. There is still uncertainty in the man’s gaze but also amusement as well as keen interest. John shuffles from foot to foot. Seconds tick in his ear, chiming in the quiet, stretching this wretched day even longer.
“Not to mention,” Mycroft speaks from his chair, “that we can place some hope in the presence of my own counterpart there, too. Isn’t that so, Doctor Watson?”
Ever since they were found in their symbiotic state of bodily existence, they seem to have done nothing but recover and redefine the boundaries of their personal space. This situation here, for instance. Sherlock was slouching on the sofa, feet up on the coffee table. John wandered around the room, then chose to sit down next to him, so close that he made Sherlock sway into the dip John’s drop produced. Their shoulders bumped, then settled on merely brushing. John, too, put his feet up on the table. In a minute, he slid lower. In another, Sherlock followed, doing the same.
thinking about Sherlock—a difficult feat, additionally complicated by the person across from him who is both so like and unlike Sherlock.
“What about evidence? Have you collected any?” Holmes asks briskly and John thinks of his own clothes upstairs.
Sunlight is streaming into the room, but it’s a cold London autumn outside. Earlier by the window, when he was looking down at the unrecognizable slush that is Baker Street in the nineteenth century, John noticed the steamy breaths of some loiterers. Thousands of images have registered in his brain, he is sure. Images that will grow into reality; develop slowly in the darkened room of John’s mind like old-fashioned photographs in a tray.
Before John has the chance to offer any response, Holmes gives words to his shambled thoughts. “I am not sure I should treat you entirely as I would a visitor.” He spreads his arms and looks about. “You are Doctor John Watson and these are the premises you inhabit, only at a different point of time.” Thinner lips than Sherlock’s—whose aren’t?—quirk as they prepare to close around the mouthpiece of a pipe.
“My brother Mycroft, on the other hand, is someone who pieces together the whole from the smallest, most inconclusive parts. He abhors exertion and has learnt to look at seemingly random details and arrive at conclusions about their effects from the comfort of his chair. Between him and myself, I have some confidence we can advance towards finding some answers.” Holmes pauses. “You are allowed to speak, John.”
John knows he should object, vociferously. Discourage Sherlock once and for all, or at least tell him off for thinking of using John as an extension of his own body. But he is caught in the sound of
“One only has to look through history to see that the true artists of crime are very few and far in-between anyway. By all means, what you describe is most beneficial for society and for the sound sleep of ordinary man. But I’m afraid that for the only consulting detective in the world the twenty-first century must be a bleak, monotonous place of boredom.”
John is about to tell the man to just bloody well sod off, when suddenly he finds that he can’t. Grey eyes are watching him carefully, excitement still there as backlight, but there is now intense, dark seriousness dominating. That look John also knows. Once more, everything clicks together: the dim light indoors, the heavy fumes, the new furniture, the eerie London silence, and the man in front of him. But this time John doesn’t feel like bellowing. He feels like sitting down.
The other remains silent, while he draws on his pipe. “No,” he says at last. A moment ago, the match’s flame illuminated his narrow face and high brow—orange imprints of those are still dancing in front of John’s eyes.
bored, you’re right about that. But I get the feeling you are, too.” John throws a not too discreet look at the drawer. “You both are, when there are no cases, no chase. He’s actually quite busy, despite all his moaning. Lestrade alone is popping in with a new case often enough.”
They look at each other for a few more seconds and John experiences the return of that feeling of unease, almost physically tingling up his limbs. His mind is marshalling all its powers to produce an explanation for all these oddities put together. For some reason, the very air outside, the way the city vibrates, or rather
What John sees is this: sleek black hair with too much hair gel on. A long face with cheekbones that could rival Sherlock’s, but here, they are more pronounced yet less striking—the face is thinner. The paleness is the same, but unlike Sherlock’s, there are no signs that it ever abates to give way to a healthier skin tone. Someone should have a word with the man’s doctor, is what John thinks. At least the cigarette smoke has an explanation, because that there is a heavy smoker if there ever was one. Privately John feels a weight lift off his shoulders—thank God Sherlock didn’t slip into some horrible nicotine binge.
John stops listening and licks his lips for courage. His fingers catch Sherlock’s chin, smooth from this afternoon’s shave—
“It’s all right,” he mumbles, rubbing his eyes. “I’m not used to hearing my surname while I’m sleeping. Makes me automatically go into army mode.”
John looks down at his clothes, then looks behind himself. No one’s there. “Do you mean…You mean yours,” he says, nodding to himself. His frontal lobe tingles. “I’m sorry, who are you?”
It seems that in 1895 brandy is just as restorative as it is in the early twenty-first century. John wonders about which tense he should use here, while he’s sipping through a fog. A quarter of an hour ago, he was in the early twenty-first century, so that is technically the past, but he can’t quite bring himself to formulate the sentence: ‘It seems that in 1895 brandy is just as restorative as it
Mrs. Hudson enters with an air of efficiency. “Another telegram for you, Mr. Holmes. Are you finished with your breakfast?” The question is directed both at Holmes and John. John nods and thanks Mrs. Hudson as politely as he can. She smiles appreciatively and starts clearing up. Holmes hasn’t replied, of course, leaving petty things like communication to the lesser lot. He’s read the telegram and now waits for Mrs. Hudson to finish, humming softly an recognizable tune. John notes the pleasant baritone and remembers how many times he has heard Sherlock hum in the bathroom. He’s always wondered if Sherlock’s even aware he’s doing it.
In all the years he’s known Sherlock John has muttered to himself a begrudging remark or two. He can’t help it. It pains him to see it all wasted on Sherlock: the nice scent, the fastidious self-grooming, the immaculate sense of style. The rich mop of curls and the lean legs, the exotic eyes that have the colour of a sodding lagoon, for crying out loud. Never forget Sherlock’s ridiculous lips, of course, which every mediocre writer would call ‘made for kissing’. Sherlock’s mouth is rivalled only by his stupid cheekbones. Even Irene Adler commented on those and she has got to have seen it all.
Mycroft lifts his chin and his eyes, the colour of steel, glint. “Naturally, I knew I was of perfectly sound mind. What I had experienced—what we had all experienced—was inexplicable as a whole and in some particular aspects, but real without a shadow of a doubt.”
He tries not to shuffle. His left thigh is perfectly aligned to Sherlock’s right thigh, like a drawing in a Geometry textbook.
The other Sherlock purses his lips and nods. He’s rarely blinking. John suddenly has a powerful wish to look at him better.
It’s been three days since he and Sherlock both collapsed from nervous exhaustion. At least that’s the official diagnosis of the prominent medical specialists conjured up by Mycroft. No doctor, however— including John—has been able to offer a plausible explanation as to how two grown men with no previous symptoms to indicate mounting stress or fatigue, two men in fairly good general health to boot, managed not only to have an unexpected nervous collapse each, but synchronize them to the minute. John reckons he might need to read up a bit on some anthropological studies, or at least check out those articles about the morphic field.
Sherlock suddenly moves, arm coming out of the burrow. He reaches across from John, crowds over him, his throat, its line, smell, damp, white, pulse beating—
“What? Oh.” John has to pause. He lifts his eyes, trying for an earnest eye contact to soften the blow—no one likes to be compared to someone unfavourably.
“People just don’t need to be that inscrutable where I come from,” John tells him softly. “Everything and everyone is quite free, compared to how it used to be.”
Taller than Sherlock, and as far as John can tell bonier, the man’s attire lends the biggest justification to John’s reaction. A long, formal jacket, like a conductor’s; a white, old-fashioned shirt with a high, uncomfortable-looking collar; and something like a short, thin black string instead of a tie, with a fancy knot to boot. An actor hired by Sherlock, no doubt. In costume or not, he seems to fit in the transformed interior of their sitting room more than Sherlock would right now.
John hesitates. Not because he feels any actual hesitation over this but because an epiphany that binds reason and feeling, past and present and future, two people for good, is not easy to articulate simply.
“The replicas,” Holmes murmurs. His eyes are incredibly intense. In his peripheral vision, John has caught him casting slanted looks at him, but now all his attention is on Mycroft. “Professor Moriarty was my invention. How fitting!”
John realized his psyche would have to work overtime on suspending disbelief, so he abandoned his attempts to comprehend an entirely different reality and just got on with it. He dresses promptly, taking care of his morning needs to the best of his abilities, and he turns up by the breakfast table at a reasonable hour.
“Because Sherlock is there!” John shouts. “He’s figured it out! He wouldn’t have left him leave the flat. Sherlock—He’s figured it out. He
John can’t quite tell how long it takes for him to process this, but when his brain considerately prods him to breathe, the oxygen stirs him into action. His neck cracks alarmingly as John turns to stare at Holmes. Just in time to see his glazed eyes animate—he’s looking at Mycroft with an expression John can only call ‘flabbergasted’. For the first time John sees this Sherlock Holmes utterly lost for words.
The facts are these: It is 1895, this is Baker Street, and the man is Sherlock Holmes. The thought that there is more than one Sherlock in existence, that there are a number of them scattered through the centuries is a rather enormous one to be defined with plain adjectives such as ‘scary’, ‘intriguing’, or ‘bonkers’. At least they don’t appear at the same point of time in droves. He perks up a little at that thought.
“I assume they vary the times of day they bring them in – there may not be anything to discover. It would be a waste of the Met’s manpower and time. Besides, it’s only an off chance. It’s far more likely we’ll intercept them in Brighton, which would be out of Lestrade’s jurisdiction anyway.”
Although he wasn’t quite smiling, John’s eyes were soft when he said, “That’s really. Overwhelmingly kind of you, Sherlock. I don’t suppose I could suggest a local establishment instead? I mean, I can hardly introduce you as a ‘real person’ when the first thing you do is fly her off to another nation for a bite and sup. Mycroft is forever building up The Fat Duck. Doesn’t anyone
“At the mo it’s only me and Morris, on behalf of the Howard Foundation. I’m sure he’d be amenable to another partner. Are children a particular concern of yours, Mr. Holmes?” She dimpled at him suddenly, her round, brown little face alight with good humor. “I imagine that with all your dodging about you don’t have much time for a family of your own.”
“And why not tell him yourself? You’re so fond of plucking him from the street into that car of yours. It is
“The first one? Very plain, not over large, no recent paint, one desk, one PC, very new, top of the line. An inscription over the door, though. ‘Omne ignotum pro magnifico est’. My Latin’s only so-so, but, I think it’s ‘We have great notions of everything unknown’.”
Sherlock had Patel take a circuit of the site, and some measurements just within the tunnel, and the two of them conferred for some time.
Sherlock did so, and the woman smiled widely, showing a generous gap in her front teeth. She reached to squeeze John's hand and said something in Czech.
“John isn’t in. You might try him at the surgery, but he’s likely on his way back.” For a moment, he considered suggesting that they wait. The girl didn’t look pregnant, and her friend was Catholic and a virgin besides, so an STD panic seemed improbable at least. But whatever it was seemed likely to be tedious.
The knock at the door was fast and light, but persistent. The bell remained broken because Sherlock had found that Mrs. Hudson was efficient at screening callers in her own way – the more tearful they were, the more tea she gave them, and her sympathetic interest was often the visitor’s true goal: a simple wish to tell their tale of woe. The knocking continued, and Mrs. Hudson being out, Sherlock roused himself to answer it.
“Between them, they’ve commissioned a refitted warehouse space. It’s all very modern and ergonomic. Flexible shifts, as there is little machine line work. I believe they have an on-site masseuse. And yoga or somesuch. There will be proper work visas provided for any of the displaced women who may wish to stay in the country. The leather and furs will be rendered from overpopulous nutria, imported from America, where it’s an invasive species currently busying itself with destroying the Louisiana bayou, thereby providing a valuable income for those still in the throes of Katrina.”
The boy seemed anxious and the girl sullen, so Sherlock began to close the door.  As he did, the girl jabbed the boy with her elbow.
“Pupils seem to be reacting normally. Did they hit you?” He ran his fingers through Sherlock’s hair and prodded gently at the back of his neck. Sherlock's skin was damp with sweat, but John had never been squeamish. "Well, no blood, no contusions that I can see. Did they just tuck a bag over your head and stow you in a boot, then?”
"They've been fed, at least," John informed him, stripping off his last pair of nitrile gloves. "You say they've been in the country about two weeks?"
“Dr. Watson?” The boy’s hair was mashed flat from the rain, but he wore a slicker, and driving gloves.
He noted with some regret that the wear of her heels proved her to be merely a duped philanthropist. Beyond that, the line of her smart jacket dissuaded him from even a cursory review of her tax records. Depressing.
“Vaguely.” Sherlock enhanced the magnification on the sample he’d gotten from Jabez; fiber treated to resist stains. Not from a garment – carpet, industrial. There were a thousand buildings with carpet like this, nubby neutral taupe. New enough not to show any signs of wear, nothing suitably damning or specific spilled on it…
Sherlock found it very satisfying to text John at just about the time he would have arrived at Mary's flat, and John replied with pleasing alacrity.
“Mycroft was… concerned.” At John’s look of furious incomprehension, Sherlock continued quietly, “I am told that you didn’t take my death… well.”
“This is you trying your hand at actual flattery, then.” John frowned at him. “Maybe you’ll get better with practice.”
For a moment, John’s chest had hurt like someone had lodged a fish hook the size of a carving knife in his ribs and given the line a good yank—and then he’d collected himself and dragged Sherlock in for tea.
“I spoke with Mycroft when I saw the advertisement. It may be connected to a small matter he’s has been asking me to look into. When Jabez returned with his intelligence, such as it was, I knew I’d need an inside man.”
“Well, they gave me a biro and a steno pad and had me copy fair about a thousand articles from Wikipedia. For four
“I have come into some money, just recently, and I have some business there. Surely you’ve reached the minibreak stage of your relationship? A man with a rather fine little hotel there owes me a favor.”
Sherlock held out a wig. From a distance it looked like half a skinned cat, but up close John could see the quality: it was genuine human hair, un-dyed, red as a Donegal sunset and fine work, but he automatically shook his head.
"And it may be that they'll enter from this end," noted Jones wearily. John figured him to be pushing sixty, and not very well-suited for an all-night stake out, if the swollen joints in his fingers and his unhealthy skin tone said anything at all.
“You proceeded, did you?” Sherlock raised one eyebrow in amusement, and John’s ears reddened obligingly.
He tensed, ready to press up on his toes and rock the chair to one side in anticipation of attack, and the door clanged open to reveal John and Lestrade crouched in the hall. Seeing the room empty, John stood up and threw a hand out to bar Lestrade from crossing the threshold.
.” And then he kissed the skin he’d tweaked, and around the skin he’d tweaked, and did some licking, too, and before long, Sherlock’s eyes had once more fluttered shut.
After a moment’s gritting of the teeth at the unexpected sting of Sherlock’s assessment, John took the wig with a sigh. His hair was long enough now that he’d need to mash it down beneath one of those nasty little caps before he could tuck this monstrosity over his head.
As reported, the Fleet street offices were thronged with gingers. A spotty fellow in his late twenties, his hair every bit as red as John’s wig, was dismissing the sandies and the strawberry blonds outright. When he spied John, he crossed the room grinning. “That’s the thing,” he said, approaching to clap John’s shoulder and shake his hand. “You go to the head of the line. Morris will see you. Tell him Spaulding’s sent you.” He checked his watch and waved his hands at the rest of the crowd. “It’s on two now, so please come back next Monday, if you’ve a mind to.”
“Pardon?” Sherlock had that faintly scandalized expression that said that he found it offensive that you’d managed to surprise him. John was rather fond of it.
Sherlock fixed him with a glare and said smoothly, “It was a necklace, but that’s not who I had in mind.”
“She does exquisite work,” Sherlock allowed, peering closely at the wallet he’d nicked from John’s hip. “There is the small matter of my kidnap.”
"As horrible as it is, I suppose it could have been worse." John offered an ice pack to a young woman with the start of a very black eye. "You were great, by the way," he told her. "Sherlock, can you tell her I'm impressed?"
“It is more likely that he arranged a contact of his to offer her a job that would suit her abilities and ambitions.” When John continued to look puzzled, Sherlock continued. “Much as he did when he brought her to Barts.”
"Of course there's danger of tunnel collapse," said John, sounding resigned. "If we're going to be up all night, I think I'll drop off for a bit. Wake me when we're in Brighton."
“I think. I need a hug, Sherlock. My girlfriend’s broken up with me and you’re back from the dead. That definitely.
“Yes, but. I didn’t know anything about Moriarty, the bloody ‘Napoleon of crime’, or kidnapping, or faked deaths or arranged fucking
“We haven’t yet collected enough evidence to arrest anyone, which is why I’d like your help.  Could you arrange for a tour of the grounds to be made?”
“It’s gene sequencing,” John said, leaning over Sherlock’s shoulder to stamp a finger on the page. “They’re mapping them, Sherlock, for best
I recognized her. She’s barely any taller. I promised I’d bring her a pony if she’d stop crying,” John admitted.
“Aside from an oddly specific, and I’d say eminently justifiable, brand of ginger racism and some knock-off designer handbags they weren’t even trying to pass off as genuine, I confess, I don’t really see the crime of the century here.”
In the end, it was easiest to just knock on the door. Mycroft had given him a new key, but after almost eight months gone, it seemed… presumptive, to merely stride in as if he’d only just run to the market for mounting pins.
“So I did.” And he gave Sherlock a pinch to the hip that made his eyes fly wide. “You skulking, sneaky, lying, spying
Sighing, Sherlock drew his coat around himself and closed his own eyes as well, drawing what comfort he could from John's steady breathing.
Sherlock swallowed, his throat strangely tight, the sound of muscles working sounding hugely echoing and obscene to his own ears.
John curled his fingers around his gun and rolled his eyes. Of course they'd be armed. At least his gun was "legal" now, thanks to Mycroft.
“Nothing like it. I’m going to introduce her to some investors. She has a fine eye for design and her stitchwork could make
Sherlock surged to his feet and half dragged him into his bedroom, voice low and dark as thunderclouds, murmuring apologies and John’s name and confessing all his miseries and sins in a hot tangle of confused passion and overdrawn longing and odd, fierce joy.
“Would the tea service be a wedding present? She does seem fond of silver. I haven’t actually seen her yet, but he met her while I was… away, and I thought I could see your hand in it.”
“Perhaps. As one brother to another. One who knows the inherent difficulty in dealing with a self-destructive sibling.”
And John realized, at the other side of the city and a month too late, that if he’d opened the door and Sherlock had spoken first, if Sherlock had said his name in that low voice that rubbed across your cheek like a posh scarf, John would have dragged him in the flat and… and.
For some reason, an image of Sherlock first come back home and stark in the doorway at Baker Street sprang to mind. Face gaunt and pale against his great black coat, his eyes somehow bleak and starving in his head. He looked like he scarcely knew what to do with himself upon seeing John open the door, which was funny, because John had very nearly pushed him down the stairs pounding the man’s shoulder trying to convince himself that Sherlock was actually alive and on the landing.
“Notoriety,” Sherlock responded dismissively. “I’ve been in the papers far too recently, but you, your face is quite…” There was an unusual pause and Sherlock seemed unable to settle on a proper term. “Forgettable,” he pronounced at last. “Average coloring, average build, a pleasant bloke you’d have a pint with and think nothing of.”
“So there is a whiff of actual science to their casting, after all - in humans most hair types are the result of mixed melanogenesis, where different levels of both types of pigment are produced. The highest levels of pheomelanins in humans are present in Caucasian so-called “fiery” red heads... and an uncommon ‘mosaic’ form of melanosome which exhibits features of both eumelanosomes and pheomelanosomes.
Sherlock looked annoyed. John counted it as victory enough, saluted with his wig and headed for the loo to don it properly.
John answered and stood staring, with all the shock and gladness Sherlock could have wanted from that moment shining all around his face.
“Describe the room to me. Oh, and I’ll need your shoes. Just the one will do.” Rolling his eyes, John toed off one shoe and handed it to Sherlock, who prodded the sole with tweezers and prepared a new slide as John detailed his visit.
, Sherlock wondered?). Mycroft had promised Sherlock that he would offer one Harriet Watson a three month stay in a rather well thought of Swedish clinic should John merely say the word. An interesting proposition, and one that Mycroft had assured him had no strings attached.
“It’s the corresponding gene for red hair.” He narrowed his eyes at John. “It’s unlikely you’re a carrier, and they’ll know you’re a fake. We’ll have another day, at least, before they get your results.”
Sherlock crept out of his chair and wrapped his arms around John with uncertain caution, tucking John under his chin and then holding very still. John’s hair was tickling his nose, unimaginably soft, smelling of the same bar soap he used in the shower – what use did a man without noticeable vanity have for a posh shampoo? Johns arms were locked warmly around his back, squeezing him close. He smelled of salt and sweat and marvelous impossibly intricate simplicity, and Sherlock felt him heave a few gusty breaths against his shoulder before making some awkward gulping sounds and releasing Sherlock with a firm and final pat.
"I agree that he's not exactly sprightly, but I would remind you that he is the only one of us technically qualified to make an arrest, should it come to that."
“It’s likely that they’re holding the women on the premises at some point during transit. That would explain why they’re so particular about you staying put in the rooms.”
“I was undercover! I didn’t want to tip my hand, so I just… lay back and thought of England. But I wouldn’t have if you’d told me they were going to try and, I don’t know, invent a race of ginger sex-slaves!”
“Jesus, really?” Merryweather dropped into her desk chair and covered her mouth. “Like stockpiling weapons, that sort of thing? I like to think we’d have found out about this somehow—my lawyers are a pack of bulldogs, the lot of them—but if you hadn’t... You’re saying I might have inadvertently helped finance it?”
The tunnel in Brighton had been dug at least in part with a backhoe that was still on the premises, wrapped in a vast flapping blue tarp. The site itself was littered with lumber and girders, but the only section of the building that had been completed was a vast finished basement. Directly beneath it was the tunnel itself.
“I know some people who’ve been looking for a project along this line,” he said at last. “With a decent stake to start and a good business manager—I imagine Paolo will be looking for new work, and he read for accounting at least two years before he dropped out—she could have a smart shop on Saville Row booked out with bespoke work a good year in advance, I should think.”
His life had taken so many jogs to the left since his association with Sherlock Holmes that it was a wonder he hadn’t yet run right off the edge of the world.
Tucking up his hair, John wondered just how horrified Mary would be if he met her next still wearing the thing. He himself had always been partial to gingers; his first real girlfriend’s hair had been red as a stove filament’s glow. And she’d had freckles. Everywhere.
“It appears that. In good conscience. I must speak up.” Sherlock inhaled through his nose before speaking again. “I strongly suspect that the job offer came from my brother.”
“It’s not him,” the girl muttered, folding her arms. The boy swallowed hard, and glanced around the street as if expecting John to materialize behind him.
As Theresa Merryweather had both a reputable fortune and a storied wit, Sherlock had allowed himself the small hope that she would not only prove to be of a criminal bent, but a worthy adversary.
“We need more data before I can draw reasonable conclusions, John.” He peered closely at the tread of John’s shoe. “Sand. Yes, definitely Brighton.” He held out the shoe and squinted at John’s wig a moment. “You really don’t have to keep that on, you know.”
“The chief sommelier was once accused of serving a perfectly serviceable Beaujolais Nouveau from a doctored bottle that had been presented as a 1978 Montrachet... Perhaps you’re right. Consider it done.”
The initial interview had been cursory, followed by a “trifling test of your skills, nothing demanding of anything other than your time” and a reminder that said time would be lavishly compensated. He was led to a room, given a brief set of instructions, and left to himself. At the end of it, Morris and Spaulding both reviewed his work and conferred briefly in an excited, buoyant way, before making him an offer.
“She’s 16! She’s just a kid. What’s a little kidnapping to the world’s only consulting detective? Shall I remind you that she only did it to save your life? I’ll tell you what, I won’t even write this one up. No one will have to know.”
"I told her that she'd thrown an elegant punch at precisely the right time, and she said that you have the devil's aim for a doctor."
"It's not really necessary, but she may be useful if the tunnel under the orphanage begins to collapse."
"I'm sure we will cross paths at some point, but I don't believe I'll be needed on the premises myself. Pregnancy is really--"

It hadn’t been the dental floss, after all.  The rain-damp banknote, of course – not rain at all, but painted with clear, scentless liquid, absorbed through the skin.
Mary was freckled, now that he thought of it. Along the lines of her shoulders, the bridge of her nose, under her light makeup. All that time in the sun, the two of them very used to the dappled light of a medical tent.
“Yep, I’m due back tomorrow at 10. For. Um. A deposit.” John blinked a moment. “Hang on, you don’t think they had cameras in that other room, do you?”
"Jones already considers this a fool's errand, and at any rate, I don't think there should be more than two men, three at the most. They'll be armed, though."
Head injury? Possible, but not likely. His vision was fine, but he had no memory of being brought here. In fact, he had no idea how he’d been drugged. Perhaps he’d fainted from low blood sugar and been happened upon by some random citizen with an unmarked van and a bit of warehouse space.
"In this type of tunnel, stand-up time -- how long the ground will safely stand by itself at the point of excavation -- is paramount. Because stand-up time is generally short when tunneling through soft ground, cave-ins are a constant threat. It looks like they've at least attempted to set up shields," Patel said, using the light of her torch to indicate a steel cylinder pushed into the sand. "It carves a perfectly round hole and supports the surrounding area while workers remove the dirt.  Unfortunately, it doesn't look like they've got anything like the number of shields they'd need to really prevent a cave-in, and they haven't done anything to install a permanent lining."
"Worst case scenario, it trembles apart when the truck comes, and the truck and everyone in it is trapped," Patel said in a plaintive tone.
He hadn’t been awake ten minutes before he heard someone scuff along a hallway outside the rusted door he happened to be facing.
Sherlock curled his lip minutely and continued, “--brought me some news. I’d directed Jabez to attend a job interview.”
Peering into the tunnel's maw with a torch that seemed far from equal to the task, John could hear Sherlock quizzing Anjuli Patel about stability and load-bearing structures. She sounded dubious, and John's own time in Afghanistan had taught him that sand was notoriously dodgy under the best circumstances.
,” he’d beamed, hardly able to make his words known, he was breathing so hard, grinning so wide. “All right, then?”
“You did make an appointment with my man,” Merryweather said dryly. “How may I help you, Mr… Von Kramm, was it?”
There was something horribly close to pity in Mycroft’s expression, but Sherlock only closed his eyes to it and recited the periodic table to himself until Mycroft wearied of Sherlock’s pointed silence, and saw himself out.
Three weeks later, John tramped up the steps after a friendly lunch with Mike, who, like Greg, had been appropriately baffled and sympathetic after the whole sorry mess with Mary. To be fair, John hadn’t had much time to pine for her with Sherlock home again, and Greg happy to release any number of cases, hot and cold, to a man whose return had not only resulted in lavish and celebratory press coverage but a knighthood. As he hung up his jacket, he saw that Sherlock was paying a surprising amount of attention to some kind of fashion week program.
“No, John. Perhaps it would be best if. You kept us apart, some little while longer. After all, I’m hardly a real person at all to her – only stories you’ve told her, overlain with the tat the papers spread. Let us settle this case, and at the end of it, I will treat you both to a meal at Noma and I can meet her properly.” On neutral ground, Sherlock decided.
In the ensuing quiet, there was little for Sherlock to do but fiddle with his phone and surreptitiously watch John sleep, slumped against the window with his jacket balled up against his cheek. Sherlock had had surprisingly few opportunities to study John in repose. Unlike Sherlock, he wasn't given to napping in the sitting room. But then, perhaps that was due to Sherlock rather monopolizing the sofa.
“Oh, yes. I think they’ll require you at least through…” Sherlock considered. “Thursday.  And it’s a tidy supplement to your income, after all.”
“So much intermarriage has, naturally, diluted lines,” Morris added, blinking behind his outsized glasses. Although Morris was gray as a goat himself, John realized that at some point he must have been as red as Spaulding.
Desolate, Sherlock could only watch John pace the floor, arms swinging but rigidly controlled. Visible restraint, a refutation of his impulse to violence.
"Isn't it?" Sherlock sounded patently sincere, and John was honest enough to admit that he was enjoying himself on some level. His nerves sparked and his senses were high. Sherlock was a warm presence in the close, blinding dark of the tunnel, and John heard himself saying, "There's nowhere else I'd rather be," and meaning it.
“And the motion sensors and the ridiculously elaborate alarm system…” John sighed. “Why not call the police in?”
“It was one of those awful, manky crushed velveteen rentals, and I was going to a party for my friend Bill’s kids and it was all mothy and the beard kept sticking to my mouth and the knees were shiny and smelled faintly of wee and I stopped to buy a present for my sister on the way, and when you’re at a big bloody shopping center and you’re six and you can’t find a bobby, you will run roaring to Father Christmas, and you will cling to his leg blubbering because your bloody sister, who’s supposed to be watching you, has probably flitted right off to snog a boy and your mum is working 12 hour shifts at a factory and you are
If there were cameras, and Sherlock supposed there could be, they would be trained upon a man in a simple, sturdy dining chair, each wrist secured to each chair-arm with three zip ties tight enough to press into the flesh just under his shirt-cuffs, but not designed to cut off circulation. He could flex his fingers easily, but the ties were secure. With a tensile strength of 8 kg a piece and no leverage to speak of, he was effectively shackled, even with sweat-slick skin and sufficient motivation to pull free. His legs had not been bound, and that was something.
John’s throat had colored quite probably down to his shoulders, and he shrugged a little and muttered, “Write it up in a book for mums to flip through? Who the hell knows.”
“Not as such. He provided you with an opportunity. He said he’d had two candidates in mind and that he decided on Mary.”
you obtained these for me?” He indicated the contents of the envelope, now spread upon the table: birth cert, photoshopped passport, credit cards. He wondered what Dr. Wilson’s credit limit was.
“Hardly. But some highly visible people do owe me favors. People whose patronage could make a new designer.”
“You could meet her. You could come to dinner. She’s… she’s lovely, Sherlock. I honestly think that you, even
“I knew her, Sherlock,” John sighed finally. “When she was a just a nipper. It was, must be ten years ago? I was dressed as St. Nick.”
John found it rather difficult to see Sherlock steering his ragged army into traditional careers, but perhaps he was trying to balance a karmic debt of some kind. Jabez seemed a likely lad – underfed, could use a wash, but he was sharp and reliable.
. Come here, you.” And John bounded forward and grabbed his jacket, mashing a cheerful kiss square on Sherlock’s preposterous mouth. He pulled back grinning, chest heaving with laughter, and Sherlock merely stared at him, eyes huge and strangely blue.
"Hm. In the morning, you might put a call in to your good Dr. Morstan. We will have a coach here to take them back to Ms. Merryweather's estate in Ashridge, and I imagine that her expertise will be in some demand."
“Oh for god’s sakes, you’ll be exactly who you are, look,” said Sherlock, brandishing a fat manila envelope. “Mycroft has provided you papers: Hamish Wilson, ex-army doctor, if it even comes up. My informant tells me there was barely an interview, let alone a need for a CV.”
Sherlock held out his hand, and the boy proffered two damp £20 notes, laying them across Sherlock’s palm like they might burst into flames at any moment. Noting an unusual scent, almost familiar, Sherlock held the notes to his nose and sniffed deeply, nostrils flaring.
Eventually, Sherlock folded himself into the mouth of the tunnel, and John settled beside him; Patel had been sent home, and John had convinced Jones to wait for them in the car, parked well out of sight. The evening was overcast, and they turned their torches off. The weather had become unseasonably cool, and the breeze off the water made it colder still. The sand was damp against his trousers, and he brushed Sherlock's elbow with his arm.
“I can assure you that it’s quite normal. The theatres are full of gay people and no one persecutes them.”
Then there was the darkness outside, different to any darkness produced by a power cut. John is familiar it from Afghanistan. It’s complete lack of light pollution. The smell out there alone was enough evidence these are the actual bloody Victorian times. Unless there was a big horse parade near-by and the river Thames was flooding the entire Marylebone area, there is no way to have that combination of smells permeate the air. The kind of depth in the scent, too, that air has only when the ingredients have mixed in it for a long time, penetrated the bricks and mortar, infused into the trees’ bark.
“No,” he manages to say. He tries to clear his head and grasps at straws. “Why do you need it anyway? You’re not supposed to work for at least another few days. You’re weak as a kitten. How do you plan to run around London exactly?”
The briefest hesitation, then a nod. John is about to ask another question about ‘Watson’ when a thought strikes him, draining the colour from his face.
The windows were open; a chill swept into the room, but no one wanted to get up and close them. A gust of wind made them shiver—no one wanted to get up and fetch a second blanket, either. Sherlock had been using the one they already had as a cushion. He pulled it out and threw it over both of them, tucking himself in, while avoiding John’s eyes. For the purpose of acquiring more than three square inches of the precious cover John shuffled even closer to the warm body next to his and tucked himself in as well.
“About that,” John mumbles and lifts his head. Sherlock’s face swims in his vision, but he catches it between his hands. For a moment, his face is in high-definition and it makes John’s mouth go dry. “You…I must…Won’t ever do it probably but I know you’ll forget so…”
John is utterly swept away in Mycroft’s tale. He throws Holmes a couple of curious glances, frowning, and a stab of longing snaps him right out of the extraordinary narrative unfolding in their presence. Sherlock, Sherlock, always Sherlock. Sherlock would have erupted three times by now, demanding to know why Mycroft was telling a tale where he was one of the chief protagonist but he couldn’t remember it. Holmes, however, is quiet as a mountain. John rests his gaze on him for a beat longer and mentally amends—a mountain that is still an active volcano.
Mrs. Hudson is nothing like Mrs. Hudson—only her friendly, slightly unperturbed manner is the same. The woman who nods at John with a smile as he jumps to his feet during introductions is elderly, and it shows. Her hair is dishwater grey and kept in a dull bun; her dress leaves no trace in the memory, the crisp, white crocheted collar the one thing to refresh it. John tries to keep his eyes on her for only as long as he thinks is appropriate. He doesn’t want to embarrass the kind woman, nor himself. He doesn’t want to reveal himself as the anomaly that he is, either. It’s bad enough that one look at him and probably anyone can see he is an impostor.
Mrs. Hudson serves breakfast and coffee, making polite enquiries about the length of John’s stay and his business in America. All are very skilfully answered by Holmes. John discovers that after all, he is a medic, too, like his ‘distant cousin’, travelling long distances to visit his patients. Apparently he will be staying for a few days, waiting for Watson who was ‘urgently called away just last night’ to attend to an old friend’s sick wife in Lancashire. He missed John by half an hour, ‘how unfortunate’. John suddenly wonders where Mrs. Hudson was the previous night but decides that Holmes knows what he’s doing.
end—but considering the interesting affair that bathroom time turned out to be and his curiosity about Victorian John Watson’s wardrobe and personal belongings, John reckons he’s down in record time.
“Well, women can vote, for one thing. Also, I don’t know...Divorce doesn’t leave you marked as damaged goods for life? People marry whoever they choose, mostly.” John crosses his legs, motions unobtrusive. “Being gay is fine, too.”
The first is a very thick curtain of cigarette smoke. That one doesn’t require much thinking: John is going to
He turns his attention to Mycroft to whom Holmes has just thrown his half-commanding remark to elaborate on the rest of what he knows about their situation.
Holmes has folded himself up in his chair, knees to his chest, resembling a big, quite beautiful insect. His eyelids are half-closed, but John makes no mistake in thinking him drowsy or indifferent. He waits for him to say something as well. Eventually, when no one speaks John shuffles in his seat.
Mycroft Holmes raises an eyebrow, blinding John with the flash of momentary resemblance between him and his brother.
“I thought...How is it now? Is it not illegal? I thought people were persecuted for that sort of thing.”
Mycroft leans forward, eyebrows wriggling almost playfully. Clearly, the ability to compartmentalize is an inherent shared trait in the Holmes family far and wide—the elder brother seems just as temporarily oblivious to the practical repercussions of their wretched lives as is his younger sibling.
The other man fidgets, his fingers briefly dawdling invisible symbols on the mantel. His voice is quiet next.
—murmurs. “Over here, there’s a good fellow.” He helps John into a comfortable chair quite in time to prevent John from fainting for the second time in his life.
Sherlock rolls his eyes and turns to face John fully. At this proximity, it’s as if John bought a 48-inch TV for a twenty-square-foot room. He draws his head back to see Sherlock better. He expects a pout but the bigger picture reveals an insult in the making.
Sherlock pulls his head back as well and regards John’s face with scrutiny that’s worrying for how feeble it is. John tries to school his features into something firm, exuding less of the utter contentment he’s feeling in his current situation. He doesn’t think he’s very successful. Sherlock’s eyelids begin to droop and his mouth slackens.
The TV is on but it’s more of a quiet background hum. Outside, there is surprisingly little noise, too, especially as far as car engines are concerned. What’s more surprising is that John isn’t that surprised. It makes him feel almost nostalgic. He would say it reminded him of how it used to be in his childhood if that wasn’t a complete lie. At least the sound of horse hooves he seemed to be hearing in the first couple of days has dwindled to the point of extinction.
What does Sherlock always say? When you’ve eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how mad it might seem…
John pinches his nose between his eyes. “Right, listen. We’ll have to work around the language a bit.”
John knows a diversion when he sees one, but he can also respect what he doesn’t understand. He nods, then sniffs and squares his shoulders. “Well, if you could find me some clean sheets and a second blanket…”
“Yeah,” John says, reaching back in search for stability. “I can feel it too.” To say that the floor has started the cha-cha would be a gross understatement, and it’s as if someone’s slowly filling John’s headspace with the softest white flour.
He upturns his face, silently giving permission for it to be roamed by that discerning gaze. Their eye contact stretches to several seconds, then Holmes sighs.
Holmes’s impatient voice butts in. “Can we leave the pleasantries for later? John is right, Mycroft. What is going on?”
“Watson,” Holmes whispers, his voice the kind to send poets scribbling about velvet rose petals on an early morn. “Watson!” he exclaims and laughs, all poetry allusions dispelled by his rich, masculine timbre. He lets himself be pulled tight against Watson’s body, eyes closing. Watson is saying things, too, quite loudly, but it has all become background noise to John.
“I saw some vast wilderness beyond, but right at the door’s threshold there was something akin to the opening of a stone hut. In front of it was a man, tall and gaunt, looking similarly wild and hairy like our savage, who had thrown himself at this man with cries of joy. The man himself appeared sufficiently animated at the sight of the other, but his eyes locked with mine in shrewdness that surpassed anything we’d seen in his companion. This man was fearless, and very much aware of himself and everything around him, including me. That was all I managed to perceive before the door closed. When I opened it again, the familiar sight of your hallway greeted me.”
“He isn’t, although I suspect it was touch and go. No, no one’s a criminal.” John sighs. “Try not to look too disappointed. What was I saying? Oh yeah. Mycroft, kidnapping me. It’s practically how he communicates. He’s very powerful, fancies a bit of drama, too, like—”
“Greg is fine,” he hurries to say. “Had a bit of trouble at work some time ago around the whole Moriarty business, but—”
He remembers his nose and open mouth being pressed against the skin on Sherlock’s throat, remembers the heat and the damp and that scent…
Holmes is watching him with his most unguarded face yet, but John doesn’t have the chance to make anything out of it. There’s a knock on the door.
John ponders the florid turn of phrase, then hums his agreement. “He’s a decent bloke. Considering the shit—Excuse me. Considering how Sherlock behaves sometimes and how he pisses off—I mean, how he…aggravates everyone else at the force, he’s lucky Lestrade’s stuck by him through thick and thin.”
“I had another one,” he informs Sherlock with soft laziness. They’ve been sharing all such irrational experiences, comparing notes as it were. John believes Sherlock is storing everything somewhere in that big brain of his, to ponder and seek the most tenuous connections.
John concludes that while fate is a touch unfair in how it seems to have distributed the good looks between the John Watsons out there, it is nothing but egalitarian when it comes to the Sherlock Holmeses, making each of them impossible to miss from a mile.
But Mycroft shakes his head. “No evidence is left behind, Sherlock. It disappears as soon as the reverse process takes place. It is a safety mechanism put in place from the first Mycroft, I am happy to say. The man must have been exhausted.” Mycroft shakes his head in sad sympathy. “He put these measures in place because any remnants, the slightest trace of another world’s presence makes the spot weaker still. It will be an entirely different matter, of course, should Doctor Watson here find it impossible to return. I am not quite sure of the protocol then, but I was given to understand unequivocally that there is a procedure as well and one which—”
John storms ahead to where Mycroft is pointing. He has the swiftest fantasy that the door will open like an embrace ready to swallow him mid-flight. It stays closed, though. John stops abruptly in front of it, stares at the wood for what seems like an eternity, the high-pitched noise in his ears growing unbearably loud. He swallows a few times and swears under his breath.
“I guess we better go in,” he says, indicating with his head. “We’re about to go a bit mad, I’m told. No one would notice with you but I’d like to keep it private.”
The space looks different in broad daylight. Outside it’s a clear, beautiful autumn day and the air in the room seems almost fresh. John wonders briefly whether it’s the routine of the house to have the windows open first thing or it’s a sign of consideration on Holmes’s part.
“I know your impulse to act is powerful, John.” Holmes is the one to reply to him, voice just a hint unsteady. “But you mustn’t do anything. You can open this ‘portal’ only from the outside. Am I right, Mycroft?”
The musician’s fingers raise the cigarette again. The prolonged glow of the tip speaks of a long drag; more smoke fills the space before Holmes’s face, as if left by a train departing from a station.
He can feel his eyes widen as he leans forward. Holmes has frozen and is watching John like the horse on which he’s put all his cash.
“Yes!” John chirps, unable to help himself. It earns him a swift berating look. Mycroft suddenly seems a bit cross.
“This is a most remarkable business, Sherlock. It’s rather a relief for me to be able to discuss it with you—a short-lived one, sadly, as you will find out in a moment.”
“Well,” Holmes says to John’s bowed head, giving him a start. “What an unfortunate time to be alive,” he pauses, then finishes, “for my counterpart.”
“Thank you,” he says pointedly. He nods at Mrs. Hudson and shuts the door in her face, then turns and sighs deeply, eyes lifting up to the invisible skies in a theatrical display of exasperation.
John shuffles in his seat. “I’m sorry,” he says. “That it ever was. Not fine.” He feels stupid for saying it, but he’d feel infinitely worse if he didn’t.
“Yes. I’m sure it does,” he says. “I’m sure such tolerance—We sometimes take it for granted, but to you it must seem…” John doesn’t have the words to finish.
“Let me guess,” John says, hands on his hips. “You sometimes wonder what it must be like in our tiny little brains.”
about the taste of it too. It’s been on his mind a lot. Fascination with Sherlock is nothing new, it’s more like this particular branch of John’s fascination...
“Yeah,” John says. He sees Sherlock’s eyes flicker to his lips, back to his eyes, back to the lips, bolder this time.
“Believe it to be real, dear sir,” Mycroft announces solemnly. “Believe it to be real. I have it from a trusted authority after all. He told me that it was imperative the person who crossed from his native world into another did not leave the area of the ‘portal’.”
“Right, listen,” he begins. “I’m Sherlock’s flatmate, John. John Watson? I don’t know what you’re both up to and to be honest, I don’t really care. I’m going upstairs in a minute. I’ll give him a call about the state of the flat, but I’ll ask you right now to stop smoking and air the place properly, all right?” John even manages to produce a perfunctory smile.
John steps away, letting the man’s impressive form move past him on the way to the inner space of the room. He leaves the two brothers to take the armchairs on either side of the fireplace and sits on the small sofa that faces it.
A third isn’t necessary; John can hear the sound of feet up the steps, then the door behind him opens.
“Wait, no, wait,” John cuts, uncaring about his bleeding manners. “Hold on. What do you mean if I find it impossible to return? Has everyone swapped places back so far?”
A pair of extremely intelligent eyes is fixed on him with the kind of curiosity John suddenly finds unsettling. The eyes aren’t dark. Their exact colour is unclear but at this point John is glad to be able to distinguish
John’s ‘er’ goes unnoticed just like the awkward cut of the sentence’s end. Holmes has gobbled up John’s every word and is evidently waiting for him to continue. John scratches his stubble, then decides to give him the whole picture. “He and Sherlock don’t get on,” he says.
“You can relax,” he said. “I’ve never had such an abomination on my face and never will.” His newfound irrational resentment of moustaches settled in his heart with surprising ease.
genius. Who, to make matters even more overwhelming on a different level, is also very human. Intimately close. Sherlock is pyjama bottoms at odd hours and orange peel preserve at breakfast and stomach cramps after he stuffs himself with reheated Asian takeaway. He is John’s flatmate and his best friend.
It’s not the face that draws John’s eyes though. He gulps quietly, averting his eyes from Sherlock’s throat and remembers how they woke up from their collapse.
John would like to look around to see how on earth such a transformation could have taken place within the twelve hours he was absent. His brain, however, refuses to let go of the stranger. John takes him in, job made harder by the fact that his own eyes are seriously beginning to itch. He finds relief by randomly stretching his facial muscles on all sides, pulling odd faces as is his habit when tired. For some reason, his goggling provokes a slight start and a step back in the other.
John gulps whatever water is left, then closes the cap on the empty bottle and rolls it across the sofa. It plummets over the edge to the floor, an empty vessel down a dry waterfall.
Three! There was an allusion of another pair a moment ago. Maybe even four, five—who knows how many? An indefinite number of Sherlock Holmeses who all somehow exist together but in different places. An indefinite number of—
John’s shoulders relax and with that, a head rush accosts him, making him sit back on the edge of the bed.
Sherlock is looking at John as if he were the only man in the world. Which, seeing that he isn’t even the only John in the room, is a pretty great feeling. Everything seems to happen in slow motion, each millisecond crammed to the brim with content. Sherlock’s lips part and start forming a monosyllabic, the one word John realizes he has bitterly missed hearing in Sherlock’s voice.
That’s all to say, John sincerely hopes someone at this end is appreciating the refinement and the classy looks of the man in the chair across from him.
John’s smile of assent is half-hearted, more in appreciation of the humour and the goodwill than in real delight. He hasn’t missed the trembling of the fingers as they picked up the pipe or as they stuffed it with tobacco from the slipper.
Mycroft Holmes takes out a handkerchief and wipes his face, then returns it to his pocket, carefully folded. He rests his large, bun-like hands on his legs, looks from John to Holmes—who is watching him, the very picture of barely contained mental force—and shakes his head.
“Is this okay?” he asks, unnecessarily. It’d be nice to hear a compliment from a Sherlock, no matter which one.
Although Mycroft has declared his intentions to keep it short, the writhing of his backside on the cushion suggests settling in for the day.
“That isn’t so, my dear fellow. You are too kind trying to save me the embarrassment. Yesterday you introduced yourself by your first name, when you still thought I was an acquaintance of your friend. Before that, upon entering the premises, you were calling my first name. It’s something Watson doesn’t do even—” Holmes cuts himself off abruptly. “He does it extremely rarely,” he amends. “From everything I’ve gathered about your relationship with my counterpart I should have concluded this was not over-familiarity on your part. Therefore it must be the custom of the era.”
“I intend to think,” he says. “I shall need silence for that and, I’m afraid, at least three pipes. My suggestion is that you retreat to Watson’s—”
“Yes,” Mycroft replies, but John doesn’t miss the sideway swift glance he exchanges with his brother.
“Over the next twenty-four hours you had locked the door to the flat and thrown yourself into solving the puzzle with your customary dedication, but with no success. It was then that you decided to call on my assistance, but when you attempted to leave the house, the man had suffered some sort of a fit—possibly at the prospect of leaving the house, possibly, as you reluctantly admitted, at the prospect of letting you out of his sight into what he perceived to be an extremely strange, dangerous world outside. So you found yourself unable to visit me. While our conversation was taking place, the man was sleeping, exhausted, in Doctor Watson’s room.”
“What I encouraged you to do,” he tells John, “is apply your own knowledge—in this case indubitably superior to my own—on the laws of nature and physics, then see what you can deduce about our situation. I am blind, John. My single excuse is the fact that I simply do not care enough for these aspects of science to keep them cluttering up my mind. Yet my brother’s venerable presence has had its typical stimulating effect on me.”
“The fellow was a savage. He spoke some peculiar, unheard of language that consisted predominantly of grunts and loud exclamations, but few of the latter did appear to be some sort of words. He wore clothes roughly made of animal skin and fur, and his hair and beard were indeed reminiscent of the fur of a wild animal. I was surprised that you hadn’t resorted to drugging him—from your account of the events, communication with him had been most difficult. He had fainted upon seeing the room which I understood to have been lit exceptionally well at the moment of his appearance. You had gathered a lot of your data while he was unconscious and then had gone on to raise him back to consciousness and to interact with him.”
John swims out of his reverie to look closely at Mycroft and notices an air of strain around him as if recollecting the whole episode represented an almost physical effort. His eyes are piercing and vibrant, though; the only thing at odds with his body and his demeanour. They aren’t leaving his brother’s face.
Holmes lowers his head as if he is trying to take a better look at John, eyes almost silver. Silver, like the clasp of a pearl necklace.
John had had enough at a much earlier point in the proceedings, but he regains command of his vocal apparatus only now.
Holmes stabs his cigarette in the ashtray and shakes his head slowly. “I must confess I was never drawn to the study of society but your comments interest me a great deal.” His eyes lose focus for a moment before he shakes himself off. “To more practical matters. Indeed, my brother will be here soon. I received his reply while you were still upstairs. He asks that I stay indoors and wait for him. Well, well! Between your turning up here and him deciding to grace me with his presence at my home, the world is certainly taking a most peculiar turn. But let us enjoy our breakfast. Have your coffee, my—John. I hope it’s to your satisfaction.”
“I can predict with some certainty,” he says musingly, still perched on the table by the window, “that in your time criminals can be caught by the simple location of their fingerprints, coupled with producing a match for them from some sort of special archive for fingerprints.” The light hits Holmes’s back now and gives him a glowing, platinum outline of dust. John gazes at him and swallows his disappointment that once again he is not going to shock Sherlock Holmes. He lets his admiration take over; Holmes reads it on his face and gratifies him with a smile that starts from his eyes.
There is a lot John would like to say, but he doesn’t. He just nods curtly, straightens, and stands to attention. He keeps his eyes trained on Holmes’s face as does the other on his, and for those last few seconds the rest of the sights and sounds disappear.
“Naturally. Can I trouble you for a hot beverage? And perhaps a plate of biscuits? I had the most loathsome—”
The man gazes at him, utterly transfixed, then suddenly throws his head back and lets out a single exclamation that sounds like
Sherlock squinted at him. “No,” he dragged. “You’re right. It wouldn’t suit you. You’ll look like someone out of a gay porn film from the seventies. Oh, for God’s sake, John, don’t gape! Still… A moustache would make for some very informative reading of your moods.”
They look at each other. Holmes nods, his eyes big and incredibly clear under the abundant light from the window.
Sherlock raises one eyebrow and John’s vision swims, the pieces of Sherlock’s face re-arranging for a split second into something with a completely different synergetic effect, one that jolts him alive like nothing before. For a split second only, a new face appears over the familiar features, too.
“Thank you,” he says. His hand shoots out for a handshake, but he puts it behind his back, mindful of the damage he could do. “I—I’m sorry I rushed out like that. I should have said goodbye properly. It was really amazing to—”
in Sherlock’s plea, in the seductive parabola of his suspended eyelashes. He is trapped in the crease right in the middle of Sherlock’s bottom lip, stranded on that light-brown speck in the iris of Sherlock’s right eye, the one that looks like a tiny island in the waters of a sodding lagoon.
Mycroft’s voice is quite triumphant. “I was extremely lucky to have a confirmation that my theories were right very soon after I’d formed them.”
John gulps his water like a truth serum and knows that deep down he might be harbouring some resentment, too, together with the fascination, the admiration, the readiness to practically die for the man. Sherlock doesn’t let John belong to himself, nor belong to his own life. It makes John furious on some level, but on another, profoundly grateful.
John barks a laugh. “No such luck. Drugs are illegal where I come from. He can’t just have them lying about the house like you do, thank God. And he’s been clean for some time. At least I hope he has and he’s not lying to me.” Fear rears its ugly head. The ever-present, ever-suppressed fear that one day he will come back to find Sherlock drugged to his eyeballs, in spite of John and Mycroft’s combined best efforts. “And just so you know,” he adds with surprising spite, “I don’t preach.”
“No,” Sherlock conceded, then sighed again. “I am talking about the possibility that you did grow a moustache at some point in the past and shaved it recently—both of which I somehow managed to miss.”
John opens his mouth but is saved the need to figure out what to say by the door being closed softly behind Holmes’s back.
This morning he explored a little around the room in daylight—an old medical bag was impossible to resist—but everything he saw evoked so much the feeling that he was on the set of a costume drama that he found he was unable to really connect to his surroundings. The things that were material and real were the scents. They were everywhere in the room, unfamiliar scents, impossible to define as good or bad. John felt the way he did when he was little and his family visited a Bed and Breakfast, decorated in an old-fashioned style, or some older relatives’ homes.
"Don't you touch my dog! Aus, Bobby. Bobby, aus!" John was unwilling to get close enough to the other man to get hold of Bobby's collar. Why would someone do this? What would be the point of impersonating Sherlock now, four years after he had killed himself?
It was still quite early, a little after ten in the morning, so Sherlock set off in the direction of the sea.  It was less than an hour's walk until he reached the water.  There was a maritime museum, and a statue out front, rather out of the ordinary.  Instead of just a sailor standing on the ground, the statue was of a rope ladder, cast in bronze, twisting up into the air.  A bronze sailor climbed up it, free from the earth, and another sailor stood at the bottom, holding the ladder, and coincidentally also serving as a support to the rest of the bronze structure.
The man who had answered the door smiled in a very tight-lipped manner, and said, "Why, certainly, Father Bennie."  Father Bennie said, "Thank you," and immediately decamped at that.
Sherlock walked along the beach.  The trees came down very close to the shore, and it wasn't a sand beach, but gray gravel and rocks.  There were huge, twisted, bleached-out trees that had been washed up at the top of the beach during some previous storm.
"You're either with me or against me.  Everyone is against me!  You're weird and ugly-looking like me.  You're a traitor against other men!"
There was indeed an escape hatch under there, but he just could not get to it.  He had hopes of using Lestrade's ID to unscrew it as the money clip was too thick for that purpose, but the tank just would not hold still.
Another idea came to him.  After all, who hadn't heard of tornados driving 2x4 lumber through metal?  Maybe a tooth could be thrown through metal if it moved fast enough.  Sherlock had sadly neglected to see if he could throw things quickly, as well as run quickly.  He had not quite got around to it--many experiments to run and not enough time.  He tried to wind up like a cricket bowler and throw it as hard as he could.  This had no result.  He couldn't even see where the tooth went after he let go of it, and it definitely made no noticeable impact on the side of the tank.  Sherlock knew there was a reason he disdained sport.
John could do this.  He would do this, and then soon enough it would be over, and he could go back to his life.  He wrapped the tourniquet around the man's arm.  The man clenched his hand into a fist without being asked.  John wiped the site with alcohol, and waited for the vein to stand out.  There were a fair few scars from previous injections standing out now.  He took another breath and forged ahead.
Sherlock wasn't sure what was happening here, what any of this was, but if he had to choose between letting Moriarty walk the same Earth as John, or Sherlock walking the same Earth as John, Sherlock knew he would do anything in his power to make sure it was himself.  He was decided.
"Sherlock Holmes, I've been thinking.  Now that you only have one demon left, do you think you can get him before the five years are up?  It's been months.  Months!  I really ought to send Moriarty to Earth to look for my escapee.  I think they might make good enemies.  Or perhaps Moriarty and that last demon are too similar?  Since you beat Moriarty, you should be able to beat the final demon, right?  Really get inside his guard.  What would be the ideal demon to defeat you, I wonder?  What if you came all this way and fought all those 112 demons, only to be put out of your misery by the very last one?"
The ships visible in the water seemed to be converging on an area away from the number four pier where the tugboat in question was said to be moored.  Sherlock turned down the coast and stayed as near as he could to the water, although some of the streets forced him away from it and into various dead ends.
The woman put her hands over her face for a moment; she looked rather panicked.  He thought he looked like a typical human.  No one else had made mention of any devil horns or anything.  Yes, dozens of people today had passed him by with little note, at least after he had put his shirt back on.  Something else must be going on here.  The woman's breathing slowed somewhat, but she still didn't take her eyes off him.  "Don't worry about that.  Please, have some rum."  She gestured grandly towards the cash register area.
It happened so fast.  Something came at his face, and grabbed him, and he smashed his shoulder against the edge of the tank, and then he was in the dark, underwater.  The water went up his nose as he tried to breathe, and he could feel it filling his sinuses.  He started choking, and flailed around as he tried to get loose from whatever had him.
Los Angeles was certainly a widely-spread town, with rather poor public transportation.  The map on his phone had suggested he could take a series of five buses to his destination, over the course of twelve hours, if he so desired.
The inside of the tugboat was unpleasant.  It wasn't a smell or the temperature, but it felt very off.  Maybe it was the shape of the place.  The floor slanted, and the ceiling slanted, too.   And the low, slanting ceiling was made even more impassable by all the pipes and things running along the hallway above his head.  He definitely had to hunch over not to knock his head.  When he was on the dock, he would have said that the boat was dead still, but he could feel it rock now that he was aboard.
He took her up on the offer.  Out back in the alley, he set his pocket items on top of an electrical box of some sort.  She made him hold up the coat so she could spray it, and the alley floor was disgusting, so he had to be sure not to let the coat sag too low.  There was a lot of side spray that got him, too.  After it had been rinsed and wrung out several times, he tasted it.  It didn't taste salty anymore, so he supposed that was as good as it would get.  The lady rolled up the hose.  "I'll get you a plastic bag to put your things in."
