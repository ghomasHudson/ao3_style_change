“Okay,” Jack agreed. He seemed to be back to his normal self and slid out of Cas’s arms onto the floor. It was pretty clear he was no longer upset when he turned to his dad and asked, “Daddy, did you know Dean has a penis like us?”
“‘S okay.” Dean peered at his friend, trying to figure out his reaction. It wasn’t like Cas to be jumpy, but then again, usually when they touched, it was a pat on the shoulder or the back. Not skin on skin contact... and why did that thought excite Dean so much?
Was Dean even allowed to suggest these things? He wasn’t their parent. He wasn’t even Cas’s partner. He was just a family friend.
Their emotions were all out of whack tonight. What were they thinking allowing just a few compliments to set their heart all aflutter? They’d been complimented by Dean a thousand times in their friendship, so why now would it be any different?
Dean can’t say he was the perfect friend when Cas explained being nonbinary to him but he knew how important it was to Cas that Dean take the time to understand. So he’d asked a lot of questions, clarified what was correct for him to say, and worked out the part of himself that hadn’t known much about gender fluidity and gender non-conformance before. He by no means was perfect with it still, sometimes out of habit calling Cas ‘dude’ or ‘man’ despite knowing Cas had asked for Dean to use ‘pal’ or ‘friend’ instead.
“I thought I’d already made that clear.” Cas sighed, and suddenly Dean felt like the biggest idiot in the world.
Sam had rebelled against it from the moment he could talk back but not Dean. Instead where Sam hated the regimented daily life in their household, Dean felt as if he thrived off the predictability, knowing everything had a place, and knowing he could be efficient at whatever he put his mind to. And that mindset followed him into adulthood. He figured it’s why he gained an eye for carpentry and could churn out new designs with minimal mistakes in the creative process. When Dean Winchester saw an end goal, he accomplished it.
The conversation between Sam and Cas that Dean had overheard a few days ago hadn’t helped matters either. Neither of them were aware that he’d heard anything, but it had stung, and he was kind of unhappy with both of them.
Cas arched his back off the bed and thrust into Dean’s mouth, and there was a feeling of static in the air.
The following morning, Castiel was glad to see that he had woken before Dean. He’d decided that today would be the day he became fully human, and he didn’t want Dean to try talking him out of it. Being neither a fully powered up angel nor completely human, made him feel like he was in a kind of limbo, and he was determined to do something about it, one way or the other.
Castiel had tried to handle it themself every morning, but after day three they finally broke down and threatened to call Kelly. Claire changed her tune pretty quickly after that. Claire and Kelly had a way of understanding each other that Castiel sometimes envied, but it also meant that Kelly knew exactly what to say to get their daughter to change her attitude.
Castiel had avoided looking at Dean while he spoke, but as he turned his head, he found Dean staring at him with a soft smile on his face. Castiel had no idea how sincere Dean was about what he’d just said, and not knowing was almost too much to take. He had to resist the urge to drag Dean away until he found somewhere they could be alone, and just ask him. Or kiss him… Dean’s reaction would surely give him his answer.
He’d tried apologising to Cas… he really had, but while Cas hadn’t outright rejected his apology, it was obvious that he was still holding onto some deep hurt. If he would just say what it was that Dean had done, he could fix it and they could move on. But that wasn’t how they operated, was it? They were both seemingly better at miscommunication than speaking plainly.
“Thank you,” Castiel interrupted, his jaw clenching as he battled against his warring emotions. “Although I don’t really know why you’re saying sorry to me. You did nothing that warrants an apology.”
Dean also didn’t seem to mind in the slightest that she had left them, and although Castiel had expected Dean to let go of his hand once she’d walked away, he didn’t. In fact, he began rubbing his thumb back and forth over Castiel’s knuckles, in a soothing gesture.
With a plan to use up the last of his grace, he carefully climbed out of bed, quietly pulled on one of Dean’s old shirts and some pajama pants, then crept downstairs and out through the French doors. There was something he wanted to do with his roses, and he believed that he had just enough grace left in him to do it. He knew it wasn’t the most productive thing he could do to remove what made him an angel, but it felt fitting somehow, especially considering the house’s history.
Halfway through the movie Cas turned to look at Dean, a strange look on their face. Dean squinted his eyes at his friend, knowing Castiel was about to say something silly.
“I think it worked out this way though,” Dean replied softly. “Claire didn’t want to upset you so she might’ve kept quiet on the whole thing and had to be suspended tomorrow.”
“Or something,” Dean laughed, nudging against Castiel’s shoulder once more before excusing himself to make the phone call to the restaurant.
Looking at Cas’s few sweaters and remembering that feeling from that day, Dean hoped Cas could get back to that soon. Dean wanted to see that kind of happiness on them again.
The temperature dropped even further, and Dean felt that clenching pain in his chest again as William loomed over him menacingly.
Claire and Jack came out to give hugs and then Castiel was on their way back to Dean’s, nervously anticipating how it would pan out.
Dean stomped away, muttering about meeting them by the car in fifteen minutes, leaving Sam and Castiel staring after him.
“What if I hadn’t healed you and you’d died? That’s something I don’t even want to think about.” Just the idea of it had Castiel’s chest tightening in anguish.
” Dean tried to argue unconvincingly though he knew better. He was a product of his upbringing. Though he loved his parents and would do anything just to spend one more day with them, they weren’t without their flaws when they were alive. John Winchester, Dean and Sam’s father, was a retired marine and brought his military expectations into their home. Both boys knew to make their bed and turn up their rooms each morning, their bathrooms always had to be spotless and if they ever skipped out on their chores their groundings were harsh.
Cas followed him, but he went back to his flowerbed. Dean failed to see what was so fascinating about a patch of bare soil, but he left him to it and went to search the shed.
In the centre would be a telescope - of course - and around the sides a sofa, some cushions, maybe even a small fridge to keep some beers in. It wasn’t much, he knew that, but Dean had never lived anywhere before with an empty space like that. A space that he could design, even if it was in his imagination. He had the Dean cave in the bunker, sure, but even that room had furniture in it when Dean took it over, (which he’d managed to utilise pretty well).
Dean leaned forward and kissed Cas again, a little harder and longer this time. Cas sighed into it, and when Dean pulled back, Cas was smiling dopily at him.
“See if I ever say something nice again.” They both knew Cas was lying through their teeth but both of them wound up beaming at each other.
Wearing the clothes Castiel felt were the most beautiful was something that still scared them. It didn’t matter to them if an outfit was marketed towards a specific gender, if Castiel liked it, they just wanted to wear it. Some people hadn’t understood, had said things to them that had etched deep into Cas’s heart. It hadn’t happened often, but it had happened enough for it to leave an impression.
Castiel could practically hear Dean’s unease over the line. Their best friend hated problems he couldn’t immediately solve. “Okay. I’m all ears. What do you need?” Dean asked, sounding as if he was still contemplating heading over to Castiel’s apartment.
Claire for all her back talk and her eye rolls was still Castiel’s biggest protector. When they’d sat down and explained to her about being nonbinary she had accepted the fact immediately. It took awhile for her to understand that not everyone knew her dad in the same way nor did they always call Castiel by the proper pronouns. She’d gotten into many arguments with strangers at stores, restaurants, parks, you name it, over the fact that she didn’t understand why it would be so hard to call people what they were meant to be called.
Dean knew that Sam was right, but he still didn’t like the thought of them talking about him like that. He’d slunk off back to his room and licked his wounds, and left them to talk about feelings and shit.
They were still staring at each other, and Dean knew he had to look away before things got weird between them. Clutching the pack of ground beef tightly as he looked down at it, he said, “Well, y’know… we might as well do things that make us happy while we… while we’re here.”
The following week with the kids went much smoother than the first week. Claire still didn’t seem to want to go to school but she wasn’t actively arguing with Cas each morning either. Dean didn’t quite know how he could best help them each morning and since the three of them were running late basically every day, making breakfast for them all was pointless. So most often he stood around off to the side, drinking his coffee and eating his cereal until one of them asked him to help find a jacket, backpack, or homework folder.
“Come here kiddo,” Dean said, extending his arms out until Jack slumped against his chest, still upset from Claire’s words. “What movie would you like to watch? Any movie you want. I think you pick the best movies.”
Dean looked from his best friend, to the screen, and back. “Like who? Richard Gere?” Cas looked almost like they were blushing now.
“You don’t like it, huh.” Dean couldn’t help but grin when the frown on Cas’ face deepened and he looked at him with guilt.
“Dean is good at fixing cars,” Jack asserted just as Dean slammed the trunk shut after grabbing his jumper cables. How the man looked so attractive at all moments of everyday, but even more so with tools in hand, Castiel couldn’t understand.
“Okay, then,” Dean muttered quietly when Cas was out of sight. He pulled the half eaten omelette closer to him and began chewing on it absentmindedly. It was gross and he hated Sam for storing his stupid vegetables in the freezer which basically makes it Sam’s fault for Dean making a stupid remark that somehow hurt Cas’ feelings.
She pointed up the road and giggled, then held out her hand to both of them in turn, shaking their hands firmly, while looking at them expectantly.
Dean wasn’t sure if he should keep going until Cas found the release he was hurtling toward, but Cas made that decision for him. He pulled roughly at Dean’s hair until he got the message and pulled off as Cas groaned.
Dean couldn’t quite tell if Castiel was angry or just listening intently, and since Cas hadn’t completely stopped Dean in his tracks, he explained further. “He’s been struggling with moving everything digital to keep up with competition and said he could use the help for a few months. You could work on your own schedule, be close to home, and if you find something else while you’re helping him out, you know he’d understand.
“That’s the plan,” Dean lied, then got to his feet and gestured with his head for Castiel to do the same.
Dean would swear that he had no bad habits of his own, but apparently, loudly declaring, “Hey honey, I’m home,” every time he walked through the front door had become extremely irritating. Unfortunately for Cas, telling Dean that had encouraged him to do it all the more. Still… the make up sex after any argument was always spectacular, so neither of them got too hung up about it.
By the time they made it to the weekend, Castiel swore the week had felt like a month long. They were exhausted and so were the kids. They’d finally managed to unpack all of the kids’ belongings and had decided to shove the last few boxes of their own things into the closet in their room–they could tackle that on a different day. For the meantime, at least their boxes were no longer lining the halls, even though the kids toys were pretty much everywhere.
Dean followed him with the cart as he then made a beeline (hehe) for something called blue borage, and finally some lavender.
A few months after they’d freed William’s ghost, Cas had managed to make contact with one of the few remaining angels, who informed him that William was in Heaven and was reunited with Richard. Dean and Cas were delighted that the two men were together again, although it would have been even better if it had happened while they were both still alive. Still, it was nice to know that their tragic story had kind of a happy ending.
“She’s just a kid. She shouldn’t have to be worried about whether or not we have enough money to afford a class trip. She shouldn’t have to worry about money, period. What kind of parent am I if I can’t give her peace of mind that she’s going to be taken care of?”
Dean felt like he was in college all over again, and he thought back to the one day he had thought he could be brave. It had been a Thursday after a football game. They’d been sitting in the front seat of his car and Dean had spent all night wondering what would happen if he just said
“I… thank you, Dean. I know you regret what happened, but I was worried that if I became human again…” Cas’s voice was hesitant and full of concern, and Dean felt even worse, if that was possible.
“Let’s go make sure our kids aren’t destroying the kitchen,” Dean said, pressing a firm kiss to Cas’s lips before exiting the bed.
Dean watched, mesmerised as Cas opened his mouth and wrapped it around Dean’s cock. His eyes never left Dean’s as he started to bob his head and tease that bundle of nerves with his tongue, all while adding a third finger and working him open.
Well… not actually Heaven, because the way Cas was treated there sucked. Maybe heaven with a small h.
“Come on, let’s go feed you some waffles,” Dean said cheerily, trying to mask the twinge of hurt he’d just felt.
Castiel’s fingers were running through their hair, making it more wild than usual. Dean could sense that his best friend was only moments away from tears. He could feel the waves of frustration, and sadness rolling off of Cas and wanted more than anything to be a comfort. He placed his hand on Cas’s shoulder and ran it down the length of their arm, pulling their fingers free.
Castiel gave themself just a few moments to drop their composure. They didn’t resist the angry tears nor the crushing feeling of guilt as a parent who wasn’t able to provide for their children. Just a few moments to breathe before accepting that there was no time for a breakdown. Two weeks. Just fourteen days to find somewhere to go, some way to pay for it, and some strength to break the news to the kids.
He knew that Dean wasn’t particularly interested in the wonders of nature, but he hoped that some of his enthusiasm for the subject might trickle through.
Despite all of the worry, and the weirdness with Dean, Sam was the same as he’d always been with Castiel. He treated him with kindness and warmth, and regularly asked how he was feeling. It was obvious he was aware that something wasn’t quite right between Dean and Castiel, but he never once brought it up, preferring instead to discuss other things with him, like lore, or Jack and Eileen. Castiel really missed Jack, and so did Sam, and they’d had a very emotional talk about him one evening which had ended in a hug and them both promising that they would always be there if the other one ever wanted to talk.
It wasn’t that he didn’t care about the oppressed - of course he did - but what with all of the monsters and apocalypses he’d had to deal with in his life, he’d left worrying about that to others.
He let himself wallow that night and made himself scarce that weekend but he knew by Sunday night the kids would be back with their mom and it would just be him and Cas in the house. He couldn’t go another full week walking on eggshells.
Kelly’s apartment building was nicer than Castiel’s old one had been, in a way that made Castiel jealous yet proud of Kelly for achieving her goals with her job. Still, Castiel felt out of place as they walked through the front of the lobby, past the security who politely nodded in their direction, and over to the second set of elevators that led to the apartments.
“But what about your allergy? Won’t it make you sick?” Castiel suddenly wished he’d saved some grace, and used it to cure Dean’s allergic reaction.
shouldn’t be a dick right now. He cooked in relative silence. Cas had a few comments, but it was mostly weird stuff about how humans first learned to eat eggs or what the various types of vegetable looked like before they were cultivated, and Dean wasn’t exactly interested, since he was mostly tired and under caffeinated, but he listened and nodded and smiled and eventually put a plate with a perfect looking omelette into Cas’ hands.
As a special treat, with the kids up slightly earlier than usual, Dean decided to make some waffles for everyone for breakfast. Jack helped with stirring the batter and carefully cutting up some strawberries and bananas for everyone to use before Dean had to send him off to go get ready for school. By the time Claire and Jack were dressed, breakfast was ready to be served. Both Claire and Jack yelled out for Cas to join them but after a few minutes, Cas still hadn’t shown up for breakfast. Dean made sure both of the kids had plates of food and were eating before going to search for his friend.
Dean’s words gave Castiel the courage to reach for their makeup brushes too. It wasn’t a lot, just a slightly deeper shade in the crease and some lightly smoked out eyeliner. They decided against the blush but did dab on just the tiniest bit of clear lip gloss because they liked the way it tasted.
“Is everyone ready for their first day of school?” Dean asked, sounding disgustingly chipper for seven in the morning.
It was going to suck. Castiel could already hear the way her voice would pitch up in frustration, telling them how unfair her life was. Castiel’s nerves were shot. It didn’t help that they only had one day to mentally prepare to deliver the news of the move to the kids.
Dean knew that was Cas’s sincere voice and it caused the annoyance in him to simmer just a little. Dean had never been good at using his words. He basically never asked for help either, so despite knowing it was in his best interest to tell Castiel that he didn’t like how messy the house got every morning, the words remained bottled up inside of him.
She hadn’t packed any of her belongings no matter how many times Castiel had asked her to get started on it. They knew that she must’ve hoped that by not packing the move wasn’t going to happen. The moment Dean pulled up to the house with a rented U-Haul, Claire’s mood had instantly turned sour.
Cas stared at Dean thoughtfully for a moment, then looked down at the coat. Obviously coming to a decision, he folded it up and simply said, “Okay.”
Dean stared at his brother, trying to get his head around exactly what Sam was saying. There was something he wasn’t quite getting, and he was waiting for the other shoe to drop. “So then, how do we…?”
He was extremely grateful that Eileen had called him to say that Sam was on the phone with Dean, and that Dean was rambling pretty incoherently about some letters and a photograph. Castiel had done his best to explain the story behind the letters, and Sam had promised to search for William, while for his part, Castiel had promised to look after Dean.
Sweet, innocent four year olds and their lack of filters. The room was silent as both Dean and Cas tried to process that question. Dean’s eyes were wide, his mouth fully agape. He looked at Cas and saw that their cheeks were flush but Castiel maintained their composure, surely used to Jack’s blunt questions.
Though Cas remained civil in front of the kids during breakfast time, Dean could tell that his best friend wanted little to do with the conversations Dean tried to strike up each morning. Dean tried to be helpful still but in stark comparison to the beginning of the week, he had nothing to help out with. He was almost certain Castiel was staying up all hours of the night cleaning, packing lunches, and making to-go breakfasts for the kids all to ensure that they had as little contact with Dean as possible.
Dean clapped him on the shoulder and squeezed, in what he hoped was a friendly manner. “Great job, buddy. And sure, I’d love to.” He’d already seen much of Cas’s work when he was watching him in secret, but he hadn’t seen the finishing touches yet, and he was looking forward to it.
“Her dad just got to work and her mom is in D.C. right now,” he responded, already grabbing his keys. “I can be there in ten?”
As they set off for the barbecue, Dean resolved that by the end of the day, he and Cas would be back on an even footing. It was time for a Dean Winchester charm offensive.
So of course on a day that had already started off on the wrong foot, with two of the three places they interviewed with saying they’d chosen someone else for the position, it was a happy surprise to be cut from their shift after only one hour on the job. It sucked for the upcoming paycheck that would be merely pennies but it meant Castiel got to be home for the night and that was enough to lift their spirits.
Cas was outside, poking an empty flower bed with the toe of his shoe, like he was assessing the soil or something. Dean watched him, wistfully thinking about how even though they were together on this case, they’d rarely been so far apart.
And like the asshole Cas was, Dean was shot with the mother of all puppy dog eyes and he couldn’t even be bothered to pretend to be put out.
He had foolishly allowed himself to believe that Dean’s behaviour towards him since they’d arrived at the house might mean he had more than brotherly feelings for him. But no, it was very apparent now that Castiel’s love for Dean was one sided, and he needed to accept that before it became even more painful for him.
Dean had a moment of realisation that if he hadn’t cleaned the windows he wouldn't be able to see Cas so clearly, and he mentally patted himself on the back for doing such a good job.
“I got in a road accident… was unconscious for weeks, and when I finally woke up and opened my eyes, the first thing I saw was this angel.” David reached out and touched Patricia’s cheek, and they smiled sweetly at each other.
Moving day didn’t go quite how Castiel had expected it to. In hindsight, they should have thought about how Claire and Jack would feel being told they were packing up their entire apartment in just a few
On the drive home Castiel flipped through their phone, making sure they hadn’t missed any important messages while at work and noticed one from Claire’s teacher.
The barbecue was at three p.m., so at a little after two, Dean went up to the bedroom to change into something a bit dressier. He had a nice blue shirt that would be perfect and some almost new jeans. They’d go great together.
“I have to go in a little earlier today so I am going to finish the application I’m working on then head out, I’ll say bye before I go.”
The two of them had spent most of their time the day prior drawing pictures and writing letters saying how much they loved their dad and all the reasons they were grateful to Cas. They even wrangled Dean into printing out some of their favorite pictures with Cas and made Dean promise to fill up Cas’s entire door with all the pictures they made while Cas was sleeping.
Castiel had begun to notice something strange about Dean. Every time Sam mentioned a case, Dean would either dismiss it as ‘not our thing’, or call up another hunter to deal with it.
“I could always use the help with my shop you know, and I’ve been thinking about hiring someone soon anyway to do the customer service side of things or at the very least helping me with finishing each project and shipping it out. I’d love for that person to be you but I know you and I know you’d feel like you’d be freeloading if you were living with me and being paid by me so I talked to Bobby.”
to move, yet again, to a new place. Having only lived in this apartment for five months, Castiel felt awful for not thinking about how their kids would feel after just barely putting down some roots.
With Claire purposefully trying to make them late, Castiel being woken up by Dean before dawn, and mornings just not being Castiel’s thing, their first week at Dean’s was kind of a train wreck. To top it all off, the house was quite literally a wreck as well.
Dean shook his head. “Nope, it’s all good. But I think we could do with a shower.” He was starting to feel pretty gross; plus, he liked the thought of showering with Cas.
As for Dean and Cas’s friendship…the only word to describe it was awkward. The following day, the two of them had found themselves alone in the kitchen for the first time since Cas came back, and Dean could sense that Cas had something on his mind.
Without stopping what he was doing, Cas looked up at him, and the sight of him… an angel of the freaking lord worshipping Dean’s body with his mouth was kind of surreal. Dean didn’t know what he’d done to deserve such treatment, but he wasn’t about to question it. Cas quirked his eyebrow, and Dean realised he was waiting for him to continue.
“Good. I mean… okay. I mean, it would’ve been okay if you were, too. Y’know.” Dean seemed flustered, and he grabbed his piece of chicken again and took a big bite from it, looking anywhere but at Castiel as he chewed.
Cas stared at the screen as the end credits started, then he turned to Dean with an expression of sadness. “I really don’t understand this problem so many humans have with sexuality. Jack and Ennis deserved to be together and live a life free of shame and fear. Love is love, after all.”
Cas straightened up and stepped away from the flower bed, his smile gone and replaced by a pained look.
Castiel turned to stare at Dean, and he couldn’t help the smile that broke out on his face. Since their walk to Mimi’s house a few days earlier, he’d been aware that Dean knew more about bees than he would have expected, but it was still surprising to hear. Dean’s usual topics of conversation were pop culture references or food.
He answered the call and put it on speaker, saying, “Hi, Sammy,” as he gestured for Cas to follow him outside and away from the house.
Cas tilted his head, and for a moment he looked like back when he had first come into their lives, utterly perplexed by humans in general and Dean in particular.
“I enjoy eating it,” Castiel replied, and suddenly, the chasm between them didn’t feel so wide; he even felt a renewed spark of hope that they would still have a friendship when the case was over. He wasn’t going to fool himself that it would ever be anything more, but if they could be comfortable with each other again, he would settle for that.
Castiel and Kelly had heard many times that their approach to parenting was the wrong way. That if their children were ever disrespectful, it was up to both Kelly and Castiel to ‘show the child who is the boss,’ but that method of parenting had never felt right to either of them. Kelly was outspoken, confident, and never let another person walk all over her, and Castiel was told they were thoughtful, patient, and always strove to be sensible in every situation. It was a dynamic that had meshed well while they were together. They both wanted their children to speak up for themselves but be kind, to fight for what they wanted but never assume they were entitled to anything, and to be confident enough to share their feelings but never allowed emotions to control them.
Of course Claire took her sweet time shuffling over to Dean’s car and climbing in. He cringed a little as the door was slammed shut.
Cas smiled even wider - if that was possible - and led Dean out into the garden. Gesturing with his hand to indicate the flowers, he waited for Dean’s reaction.
Lifting the hem of Dean’s shirt as far as his armpits, before realising he would have to break off the kiss and reaching for Dean’s zipper instead, Cas was obviously done with any thoughts of taking it slow, and Dean was totally on board with that. However, he really wanted to get Cas on the bed, but he couldn’t do anything about that for the moment because Cas’s hands were roaming over his newly exposed skin; skimming down his spine, tracing the outline of his ribs, rubbing his thumbs over Dean’s nipples.
“It’s hard to keep them in the metaphysical plane right now,” he admitted. “It takes more energy than usual, hence the need for sleep.”
Dean stood and watched Cas for a minute or two, but Cas either didn’t realise, or he knew Dean was there and was deliberately avoiding acknowledging him. Either way, Dean begrudgingly accepted that Cas wanted to be left alone, so he went back into the house and began preparing dinner. Hopefully Cas would eat some when he eventually stopped work in the garden for the day.
“I’m sorry about that. I didn’t realize I made you all think you had to stay in your rooms but I talked to your daddy and we decided it’s okay to play where you want to as long as we help clean up.”
Dean looked over to Castiel, who still chose to not meet his eyes, but he could see a rather sad and lost look forming on his face.
Mimi sat down with them and began eating her own slice of pie. "You fellas are adorable, y'know that?"
“I thought of a way we could get it to appear. Two of us...” Sam gestured between the three of them, “fake at being a couple.”
“You’re really gonna give up the hunting life?” Sam looked between them again, but Dean knew it was mostly aimed at him.
“...so we can go get some plants for those bare flower beds from the garden center.” Dean had been staring down at his hands, but he raised his gaze just in time to see the look of happiness that spread across Cas’s face.
“I’m trying here but I don’t know how much more I can deal with this,” he gestured around to the kitchen where the sink was full of pots, pans, and other dishes. The counter had bread crumbs all over it from the loaf of bread Cas must’ve brought home for dinner. There was pasta sauce covering the stovetop, some of it charred on. He didn’t want to even think about how long it would take him to clean up.
Dean’s heart skipped a beat. There was still a ridiculous part of him that held out hope that someday Cas may have feelings for him in return, but it was a part of himself he could squash down easier these days. Of course Cas called him when they were bored, they didn’t have another best friend.
Castiel opened his mouth to apologise, but an announcement from Brian that there was a ton of chicken that needed eating distracted everyone. Letting go of Castiel’s hand with what seemed like extreme regret, Dean went and got in line for the chicken, along with almost everyone else.
“You might have to though,” Castiel interrupted again.  “If we’re living here, you should have a role in handling discipline to some extent. I can’t be with them twenty four seven and I think you should at least know how me and Kelly like to approach it.”
Cas rolled his sleeves back down - much to Dean’s disappointment - then picked up his coat and went to put it back on. Stopping him with a hand on his arm, Dean said,
“Your little friend came back, huh? She’s pretty cute… for a cat.” Dean held out Castiel’s cup of coffee to him, and Castiel put the cat down on the ground before taking it.
As expected, there was only one bed, and Castiel wondered how awkward it was going to be later, with the two of them sleeping in it… or in Castiel’s case, pretending to sleep. Hopefully, this arrangement would only be for a couple of days at the most.
They spent the next hour or so reading through all the letters, and putting them in order from oldest to newest. They were evidence of a passionate, but all too brief love story between William and Ruth, and although it didn’t explain why they ultimately couldn’t be together, it was obvious that Ruth wasn’t exactly delighted about the situation, but had resigned herself to it.
“Sam?” Dean questioned in confusion, before recognition crossed his face. “Oh crap, I called him, didn’t I?” He shook his head, then groaned again. “Man, my head…”
“Well… we could still catch it, couldn’t we? It isn’t gonna be any different from any other ghost just because it’s a bigoted piece of shit, is it?” Dean was getting riled up now, at the thought of this prejudiced asshole murdering people from beyond the grave, just because of who they chose to love.
No one was in the living room when he made it to the bottom of the stairs and he could see that a mild attempt had been made at clearing up. His desk was at least mostly put back in order though he knew he’d have to spend the next morning reorganizing the papers. He didn’t want to feel as annoyed as he was, and he was fairly certain the lack of food was keeping him in a negative headspace, but he was over the mess. It had been so much easier when it was only him living there.
“Don’t worry about it,” Dean said and Castiel could hear the way he waved them off. “The house is paid off. Just pitch in for groceries and we’ll call it even.”
“I thought it would be a good way of using up my grace,” Castiel explained, hoping Dean would understand his motivation.
Dean loved how Cas was reacting to just a bit of stroking, and he wondered what Cas would do if Dean got his mouth around that cock. Withdrawing his hand - much to Cas’s obvious disappointment - Dean pulled at Cas’s jeans and boxers, sliding them down Cas’s legs until they were pooled at his ankles. Thankfully, Cas had already slipped off his shoes, so the jeans and boxers were disposed of easily, along with his socks.
He decided to go to bed early, grateful that the kids would be back the following night, but definitely nervous for the change to their usual routine. He hoped Claire would be okay with having to spend even more time with him, though he doubted she’d be very thrilled.
Just then they heard a car pull up out front, and moments later a voice rang out after the car’s door opened and closed.
Dean looked at Castiel in question, replying with a “yes” when Castiel gave him a nod. While Dean had been shaking Mimi’s hand with a silver spoon held in his palm, Castiel had quickly put some holy water on his thumb from a small bottle in his pocket. He copied Dean and shook Mimi’s hand, making sure to swipe his thumb across her hand.
“Okay,” Castiel said, as he reached for his phone and pulled up Sam’s number. “I just hope he won’t be too upset.”
After last night, Castiel was starting to feel more comfortable around Dean. They had spent a nice evening together watching the movie Dean had chosen -
Castiel had meant to be more helpful. It was always at the top of their to-do list for the day but when they’d come home and things would already be taken care of, cleaning up more was pushed lower on the list. It wasn’t fair of them. They could admit that. “Dean’s patience with us ran out on Monday so instead of talking to him, I made the kids and I hide out in our rooms and avoid making any semblance of a mess.”
tell Claire that. Her birthday is coming up and I swear she’s hinted at wanting one every day for the past month,” Dean said with a bright laugh. It made Cas smile to think that Claire wasn’t just pushing her kitten narrative with Kelly and Cas but with Dean as well.
A few seconds later a furry little face appeared, followed by a body, four legs and a tail. It was a cat, and it looked very young and lost. Castiel crouched down and held out his hand to it, and it approached him tentatively. As he gently stroked the top of its head, it slowly inched closer until it could rub itself against Castiel’s leg.
Dean nodded and slid back up Cas’s body to find his mouth, as his hand closed around Cas’s cock again and stroked it lazily.
“I know that, but it’s too late now. She’s gone.” Castiel tried - but mostly failed - to keep the bitterness out of his voice as he looked over to where the cat had disappeared from sight. He sent a silent wish after her that she’d be okay and find some shelter for the night, before turning back to Dean. “What did you want me for?”
“I like seeing you like this,” Dean said suddenly, almost like he didn’t mean for the words to come out.
A month had passed since Cas and the kids had moved in and Claire and Jack were now back for their third official week of living there. Just like last time the silence of the week without them was a stark contrast to the livelihood they brought to their week there.
His attempt at not crying was about to fail, and he angrily wiped the tears away from his eyes before they could spill down his cheeks. How had things deteriorated this badly in less than twenty four hours? It was clearly his fault, and he was determined to fix it in whatever way he could.
“This house doesn’t feel too haunted,” Dean observed, going over to one of the windows to peer through it, before tracing what looked like a random pattern with his fingertip through the thick layer of dirt. “The scariest thing here is how badly the windows need washing.”
As he’d grown resentfully accustomed too, he waited until he heard Jack and Cas yell a goodbye to him as they walked out the front door before Dean decided to get to cleaning.
The angel's hands were elegant and skilful, and Dean couldn't take his eyes off them. The way Cas handled the plants was so delicate and loving, it was hard not to feel a little jealous of them.
Claire didn’t say anything in the car and Dean allowed her the silence until they were in the house and she’d gone about throwing her backpack onto the ground and angrily tossing herself onto the couch. He’d learned to read her a little better these days and since she hadn’t stormed off to her room, he knew it meant she wanted to talk about what happened.
Dean opened the fridge and peered into it. They were gone for almost a week, so there wasn’t much going on in there, but he pulled out a carton of eggs and even found some of Sam’s emergency vegetables in the freezer. “Guess this counts as an emergency,” he muttered more to himself, ignoring Cas’ confused look.
How loud had their worries been that they had projected them onto the kids? How many other circumstances had there been that Claire hadn’t asked for something because she knew of Castiel’s financial struggles? What was this going to do to her when she grew up?
“I’d like to see her moved by tomorrow, so if they agree, please ask whoever is bringing her to school to come by the office so we can make sure everything is good to go.”
“I mean it Dean. You’ve worked so hard for this. And to know that something you love to do is also something you get to make a living from, it just makes me so proud to know you.”
As soon as Dean’s phone call with Sam had come to an end, Castiel had turned back to his plants. There was nothing he needed to do, and he was well aware of Dean standing watching him for a while afterwards, but he resolutely refused to acknowledge him.
Castiel had studied the picture for a while before asking, “Did you make that?” Dean confirmed that he did and just like that, Castiel became Dean’s biggest cheerleader. They’d asked Dean to show them anything else Dean had made, which were quite a few things at that point, pieces of furniture here or there that his parents had asked him to make for them. Cas had been so impressed that they’d begged Dean to make something for their parents for Christmas (back when Castiel had been relatively close with their parents still), and that validation in his work had sparked Dean’s passion.
Most likely it was both of those things, but Dean hoped that they would get past it once they were living together, just the two of them. Otherwise, things would get pretty miserable for both of them.
When he withdrew his hand he was holding what looked like a folded piece of paper, but as Cas opened it out and laid it on the table, they could see it was a photograph of two young men. They were looking at each other with soft smiles, and something about the way they were framed made Dean think that one of them was holding the camera.
“Yeah, yeah, you’re hilarious. Did you call just to give me shit? Because I can do that all on my own.” Dean was pissed at Sam for the interruption, even though there was no way he could’ve known that Dean was trying to apologise to Cas at that exact moment.
Walking into the bar, Castiel started to doubt their clothing choices, worried they’d get unkind looks from strangers and ruin the mood but their doubts started to wash away when Dean’s hand rested on their lower back, protectively, as they walked through the tables. That small gesture brought back the confidence they had been feeling before they left. If Castiel liked the way they looked that night and Dean did as well, then they weren’t going to dwell on anyone else’s potential opinions.
A crash came from downstairs and they both closed their eyes and groaned, their sweet moment now officially interrupted.
Dean realised that he had been staring at Cas like some kind of sex starved creeper, so he shook his head and attempted a nonchalant smile. “No…
“I found a box of letters, and me’n Cas read ‘em. Love letters, we thought they were from a woman, but there was a photo at the bottom, and it was two men. He had to hide ‘em, ‘cause it was illegal, and William… that was his name, I thought you might wanna see if you could find anything about him. He might’ve been one of the victims.”
“I think my favorite one is the pink one but I like that one too,” Dean said nonchalantly, as if hearing that Dean thought Castiel looked nice wasn’t completely making their day.
Damn, their conversation had gotten depressing, and Dean didn’t want to talk about that anymore. Changing the subject ever so slightly, he asked, “Hey, do you think William’s in Heaven now?”
Cas went quiet again but Dean could hear the sounds of videos playing from the tiny speakers in their phone. He smiled and let himself look over at his best friend, just for a moment. He couldn’t deny the part of him that was thrilled Cas was now under his roof. Hell, he couldn’t deny the part of him that was thrilled whenever Cas was in his presence.
Even though Castiel feared that that day might eventually come, he wanted to stay in the bunker for as long as possible. It was still his home, and even though he knew he couldn’t have what he wanted most, he still wanted to be near Dean, in whatever capacity the hunter would allow.
Dean went into the kitchen to raid the fridge for something to eat to keep his mind off things for a moment. It was late already and he just wanted to go to sleep, but he couldn’t really sleep on an empty stomach, so he made a sandwich out of what he found. He ate slowly. Although he felt like he was able to pass out within a moment or two, he was pretty sure he wouldn’t be able to fall asleep anyway, so there was no reason to rush. He had a lot on his mind, and none of it was something he wanted to spend much time on thinking about, so he cleaned the kitchen, poured himself another glass of whiskey and played Candy Crush until he was positive he would fall asleep before his head hit the pillow. Only then did he finally allow himself to lay down.
Looking around, Castiel realized they were indeed already in the parking garage of Kelly’s apartment complex. Apparently their thoughts had preoccupied their mind a little too much.
Something about Cas seemed off, and Dean got the feeling he wasn’t getting the full story. Cas said no more, however, and instead took a long sip of his coffee.
Cas gave Dean a look of pure misery as he shook his head. “I’m so sorry, Dean. My grace… it’s still fading, and he-he was stronger than me.”
“He’s the best man I know, although…” Castiel said, before repeating Dean’s words from earlier, “...it’s not all been sunshine and rainbows. We’ve had some difficult times too.” Even as he said it, Castiel wondered if he should, despite Dean telling the group they were chatting with previously the exact same thing. This felt different, somehow.
He will deny it until his dying breath that nearly fell on his ass after jumping out of his skin, shouting, “Jesus Christ! Jack, what the hell?”
They had white, black, and navy already in their hands when Dean held the same button up but in purple.
It would only make the morning worse if Castiel tried to force their help. They knew their daughter well enough that once she did calm down, she would ask for help if she realized she truly needed it.
A ring of the door, the crunch of ice falling in a cup, the slam of the refrigerator door closing, the beeping of the barcodes… those sounds had engraved themselves into Castiel’s mind until they were nothing but white noise each and every day. They tried to stay mentally present, they tried to engage with the customers, but the more they did this, the more they couldn’t stomach trying to smile at yet another unpleasant human. Between broken slushy machines, disgusting bathrooms, and broken card readers, this job wasn’t worth the stress and worry Castiel put towards it.
“I swear that boy’s stomach is a bottomless pit,” Mandi said, smiling as she watched Oliver accept a burger and immediately take a huge bite.
“Oh, right, I was meant to fix that,” Castiel confessed. They couldn’t contain their sigh as they shuffled over towards the machine, praying that it would be an easy fix this time.
There had been so many reunions between them over the years, and so many hugs, but Dean had suddenly found himself unable to do it. He hadn’t known what it might mean, to him or Cas, so he’d kept his arms by his sides and smiled at his friend instead.
He hung out with his brother for about an hour but since they were both old men now, they couldn’t hang out all hours of the night like they used to.
The more time passed, the easier it became for Dean to not mention it; hell, he hadn’t even brought up Cas making a deal and keeping it from him and Sam. Cas hadn’t shown any signs of repeating what he’d said, or wanting to discuss it further, and there was no change in his behaviour towards Dean, so it quietly faded into the background. They were always friendly enough to each other, but a lot of the time they kept out of each other’s way, mostly interacting only when absolutely necessary.
Cas frowned from their spot on the couch. They had the TV playing in the background but both of them were preoccupied with the phones. Dean knew he could be working on a few projects but it was rare for Cas to have a day off and Dean didn’t want to waste the chance to spend the day with his best friend.
Castiel knew better than to argue and made sure to signal to Dean to leave her be. Instead of making a fuss, Castiel grabbed the kid’s lunch boxes out of the refrigerator and grabbed an extra granola bar to slip into Claire’s. They weren’t sure if there was snack time at this new school but the gesture still made Castiel feel better.
Dean frowned. He wanted to tell Cas about the thoughts he’d had while he was painting, but not here where the ghost might discover their ruse. “Could you help me get something outta the car? I can’t carry it on my own.”
The real revelation, however, was that apart from the hand holding, their behaviour around each other was not so different from their regular behaviour. Furthermore, Dean’s comment about them staring longingly at each other was surprisingly accurate.
feel unwanted. He was a family man. Sure, he probably would never have one of his own but the family that he did have, the family he had gained over the years through his friendships were the people he cared the most about.
“Okay, okay,” she ensured. “It’s only a suggestion. You’re wearing yourself thin. I just want you to be okay.”
Dean dragged his thoughts back to the present, and took a step back, because whatever was happening between him and Cas was too confusing. Plus, this really wasn’t the place to be thinking about such things.
Dean ushered them over to the kitchen island and motioned for Castiel to take a seat, refusing any help in heating up the dinner. He even insisted on eating a second helping himself so that Castiel wouldn’t have to eat alone.
But here was Dean, making Cas question if those people’s words mattered. Because if Dean saw Castiel as beautiful, why did they care what someone they’d never speak to again thought?
The wages they got per hour were decent but the price of childcare was extortionate–and that didn’t include groceries, gas, school supplies, and new clothes. Yes, they had Kelly’s child support check coming in every month, but by the time the kids got everything needed, Castiel was still left with a mound of bills.
“I told her that daddy goes by ‘they’ and she told me that it wasn’t the correct way to write it. I told her that it’s how we call them but she told me to fix it or I’d lose points. And she always says it wrong when I get in trouble. She says, “I’m going to call your father and let him know,” but she won’t listen when I say daddy is just my
“Okay, your principal didn’t say much besides the fact that you yelled at your teacher in the middle of class. She doesn’t seem to think you’d do it for no reason but she can’t seem to get you to explain why. Could you tell me what happened?”
There was only one way it had gotten where it was, and that was Cas very deliberately putting it there. Yesterday Cas had been treating it like a piece of fucking treasure, and today he didn’t even want to touch it.
Dean’s arm had stayed steadily around Cas’s shoulders and they couldn’t pretend they weren’t loving the simple comfort it brought them. Every so often Dean’s thumb would rub softly against the fabric on Cas’s shoulders and each time it happened butterflies would swirl in their stomach.
Cas had lain next to him all night, stiff as a board, and as a result Dean hadn’t gotten much sleep. Still… it wasn’t like he slept much most nights anyway, so a couple more cups of this strong coffee should see him ready to start the day. To do…
Cas lifted his gaze from the ground and stared at Dean with a look of irritation. "I don't care what she thinks of me, Dean. And anyway, I don't have any other clothes."
“Just listen, please?” Dean begged, not wanting Cas to shut this down before Dean even had a chance to explain. He waited for Cas to nod in agreement before continuing.
When Lee offered to drive Charlie home, Dean, being the chivalrous man he was, opted to sit in the back with Cas. And maybe he used it as an excuse to slide his hand across the middle of the seat, hoping that maybe Cas would want to hold his.
For a few seconds, neither of them moved, and Castiel’s own breathing became ragged. He was really going to do it; he was going to kiss Dean… taste those lips, touch him, feel him. Just the thought of it had Castiel trembling with want, as Dean swallowed nervously.
“I’m sorry that I didn’t talk to you about this better,” they explained sincerely. “I can’t imagine how upset this move makes you. It wasn’t fair of me to ask you to move again without hearing how you felt about this. I’m
They’d barely gotten started and Dean already couldn’t form sentences. He would never have guessed that Cas would be so talented at finding Dean’s erogenous zones though. It was almost as if he could hear Dean’s thoughts, or maybe it was the noises Dean made every time Cas found one of those spots that drove him crazy.
idea to get a kitten. Claire was a responsible kid and there was an ample amount of people home to care for it.
“I can’t pretend to understand what it’s like to be a parent but I know you’ve kept them fed, clothed, and sheltered all of their life,” Dean explained, his voice stern but sincere. He was looking at Castiel with the most intense eyes and Castiel couldn’t help but melt a little under that look. “Field trips are a luxury, not a necessity, and because you and Kelly have raised such kind and compassionate little humans, Claire understands that. Did you hear what she said in the car? She said she knew Jack needed new shoes. She didn’t once say she was upset about not being able to go or feeling hurt that she was missing out. She knew her brother needed something more than she wanted to go on a field trip. Because
“Be back real quick. Oliver and I are going to grab him something to eat,” she announced, as they headed over towards Brian.
Dean looked genuinely happy when he smiled back at him. “That’s the spirit. Who knows, you might even enjoy yourself.”
“A movie night sounds most agreeable,” Cas said, with a small smile, and thank fuck. Dean resolutely put all thoughts of sex with Cas to the back of his mind, and instead focused on what movie they would watch.
“Well, not that you need it, but you have my blessing,” Dean said, before stuffing his mouth with food.
It killed him to watch Castiel continue to struggle. To watch those bright blue eyes start to dim and their smile start to fade. Now, hearing Cas’s laugh was such a rare occurrence and it made Dean unbearably sad. He wanted to do anything in his power to be there for Cas and make sure his friend knew that he would always be there for them, including Claire and Jack. Dean loved those two kids more than words could explain. He wanted more than anything to be able to help all three of them get back on their feet. To make them all laugh and smile again.
“Look, I’m sorry to do this, I really am kid, but you’ve been late on rent the past five months. I’ve got bills to pay too, I can’t keep letting this slide.”
Castiel had spent so many years of their life by Kelly’s side that they knew she could tell by just the look on their face that they weren’t doing great. She got up from the spot she’d originally sat and flopped down next to Castiel, reaching for their hand.
Cas had thanked him so many times for everything Dean had done for them but Dean didn’t think Cas understood just how much they had done for Dean. The three of them, Claire, Jack, and Cas had given Dean something that he hadn’t known he needed. It had been so long since he felt life inside the walls of his home. He’d always been proud of the home he grew up in but after losing his parents it became a home filled with memories but no longer filled with people. Having the three of them come live with him had been exactly what Dean needed. He’d felt his own spirits lift. Even if things hadn't been perfectly smooth sailing, he’d loved every minute of getting to be with the three people he loved most. The three of them, they’d given Dean a family, one he couldn’t ever imagine letting go.
“Well, of course you can.” There was a pause on the other end and a muffled sound, before he heard Sammy’s voice again. “Dean, you sound a bit… are you drunk?”
Cas did as he was told and started to pour the salt in a ring around them, as Dean placed the box on the floor and reached into his pocket for the lighter he always kept for situations like this. He had hoped William wouldn’t reappear before they got this over with, but of course they couldn’t be that lucky.
Once Castiel had revealed his fear that Dean might kick him out of the bunker if he became human again, Dean had apologised profusely, and promised that it would never happen again. The sincerity of Dean’s apology made Castiel feel safer and more cared for than he had in a very long time, and he smiled at the memory.
They’d agreed from the start that Sam would keep in contact by text rather than calls, so that they didn’t say anything they shouldn’t within earshot of the ghost, and Castiel was extremely grateful for that decision in that moment. Sam would surely know that Castiel had forgotten about him if they had an actual conversation, even if it was on the phone.
Alright, maybe Castiel just wasn’t a morning person. Night time had always been more to Castiel’s liking. Something about the moon in the night sky, the way the world calmed down once the sun went down, and the way energy surged through Castiel as if the stars themself were telling them it was their time to shine.
Dean thrust into Cas’s hand, wondering if Cas was going to answer, or if they would get each other off like that. As long as they both came, Dean didn’t care how they did it, and as he felt Cas’s hand speed up, he thought it was going to be over all too soon.
“I guess if your grace is low, it kinda follows that you’d get more human cravings,” he said, displaying a genuine sensitivity that was too often lacking when Dean spoke to Castiel.
They had to wait in the lobby for a little but soon they were both back in the principal’s office. Mrs. Hanscum seemed wary but Dean jumped right into the conversation.
“I also realise that I don’t fear the prospect of becoming human again, if I’m with you.” Castiel watched Dean’s reaction closely, and was dismayed to see that he didn’t look happy. Worried that he’d put too much pressure on Dean, he was about to try fixing it, when Dean’s eyes filled with tears as he said,
“Should I take offence to you thinking I can’t help an eight year old with her homework?” Cas scoffed but Dean could see the slight smirk at the corner of their lips. “Hey, I know how to take care of them. I’ve watched them more than a few times. I know what they like to eat for dinner, I’ve had their bedtime routine memorized since they were in diapers, and now that you and I made a plan for chores, it’ll be easy. Why worry about finding someone to watch them when I’m right here?”
He went back into the house, and Castiel was about to return to his plants when his phone pinged. Pulling it out of his pocket, he could see that it was a text from Sam…
Feeling the need to prove himself useful to Sam, at least, but fully expecting an objection from Dean, Castiel turned to Sam anyway, informing him, “Yes, I’d like to come with you.”
Thankfully nothing quite that dramatic happened. In fact, Jack’s preschool teacher had the kids waiting outside on their little playground to be picked up, with Jack excitedly pointing to the Impala the moment Dean parked. It might’ve, just a tiny bit, brightened Dean’s day beyond words to see Jack run towards him with a huge smile on his face.
Castiel bit into his, and Dean was right; it did taste good. But not as good as the ones Dean made. “Yours are better,” he said, matter-of-factly.
A couple of hours later he was all finished, and he had an idea. He went back downstairs briefly to grab a sheet of paper and a pencil (and a fresh cup of coffee), then started sketching out the space and what he imagined it could look like if properly furnished.
By the time they left the barbecue and headed back to their house, they had spoken to everyone at least once - although they’d both avoided Bob after that first encounter - and Castiel had concluded that they were generally a nice group of people. It had turned out to be a pleasant way to spend a few hours, despite none of the guests indicating that they knew anything about Dean and Castiel’s ghost; something Dean lamented as he drove the short distance home.
He’d been pondering a possible solution for a while and figured now was his chance to give it a try.
“It’s fine. I’ll speak to her in a moment.” There was going to be a lot of talking that night, between Castiel and Claire, between Castiel and Dean, and they took a moment to gather their thoughts before attempting to handle it. “She probably wouldn’t have stopped if you wouldn’t have said anything, so I appreciate you trying.”
Cas raised himself up enough to lean on his elbows, then raked his gaze over Dean in a way that somehow made him feel exposed and adored at the same time. There was a raw hunger in Cas’s eyes, and a thrill went through Dean in anticipation of where he hoped things were heading.
He knew not everyone who was struggling would have the same opportunities and knew that would be something Cas wouldn’t be comfortable with but Dean also knew that sometimes it took every last person in someone's life to help get things back in order and they were lucky enough to have people in their lives who wanted to stick their neck out for each other.
Dean’s whole being hurt. Is that truly what Claire believed? That he didn’t love those two as if they were his own?
Dean watched Cas flee into the garden, and tried not to cry. He felt like shit, and not just physically.
“Hey, hey, hey, come here,” Dean called, reaching his arms out to pull her into a hug now that she was close to the couch. “I’ll help you.”
“Will you let me finish asshole? I was going to say I have two extra rooms, three if we clear out my office. You’ll stay with me.”
So despite the instinct to yell at their daughter for her anger (they were human after all), Castiel chose to sit crisscrossed on her carpet, at eye level, and calmly speak their mind.
They were actually excited as they got ready. The button up they changed into wasn’t nearly as soft as the sweater they’d been wearing earlier in the day but it was a habit now to switch clothes before going out. As much as Castiel loved the different patterns and styles of all the sweaters and flowy tops they had started to accumulate in their closet, it was still easier to go out wearing basic neutral clothing. Jeans and a loose button up. Today’s color was light blue. Their nails were painted the rainbow sparkles that Claire had decided were the best color out of her set of nailpolish, and Castiel’s mascara was still looking fresh. They wanted to possibly add a little bit of eye shadow and liner, maybe some blush and a gloss, but knowing they were getting together with friends at a bar made them hesitate.
“I’m your landlord, Castiel, not your friend. Figure it out. I told you this two weeks ago. You now only have two more weeks to figure it out.”
“I can’t believe Dean doesn’t want to put a ring on it, to protect you from anyone who might be on the prowl.” Bob made a kind of purring sound and winked at him, and Castiel started to get a bad feeling about where their conversation was going.
Rubbing the sore spot as his eyes adjusted to the light, he took his seat and muttered under his breath. He had no idea what was going on, but he could see Dean over by the stove, dishing up the food onto the plates, before bringing them over to the table.
“This is embarrassing,” Castiel muttered between grit teeth to no one in particular and Dean handed him another glass of whiskey. He wasn’t sure if the angel could feel its effects but he nevertheless seemed to accept it gratefully and downed it immediately.
It didn’t mean that all of the bad feeling was suddenly forgotten, however, and as they pulled up outside the house where the barbecue was being held, Castiel felt a burning urge to flee.
“Enough,” they scolded, looking from Claire and then to Jack. That was a mistake, as the moment Castiel turned away from their daughter, they heard her mumble under her breath.
He sighed, as he took a sip of his coffee that was cold by now and grimaced when he pulled out a small feather that had somehow landed in it.
Reflecting back on a time when Dean had told Cas ‘don’t ever change’, Dean realised that in those ways that made him unique, Cas hadn’t. He still didn’t get many of Dean’s references, and was often endearingly (hilariously) literal. Until recently, there had been flashes of that powerful celestial being who had burned Pamela’s eyes out and terrified every demon he encountered. But nowadays, that crackle of electricity had been mostly reduced to Cas raising a disapproving eyebrow; an action that had just as much of an effect on Dean as the smiting, if he was being honest with himself.
Dean stood in the kitchen, holding his head in his hands. What the fuck did he just do? Cas had made an innocent remark about the cleaning and painting Dean had done, and Dean went and turned it into an innuendo.
“Maybe we can get a nightlight for the hallway so you can see better when it’s dark,” Cas suggested softly, still rocking Jack back and forth. “Would that help, love?”
“I don’t know how that’s possible, Sam. There’s not much more we could do to-” Even as he was saying those words, the answer presented itself to Castiel, but he couldn’t even consider it as an option.
At this age, he knew it wasn’t impossible to think he could find someone to share his life with but he didn’t think it’d be fair to try, not when he’d probably always put Cas, Claire, and Jack above almost anyone. He didn’t think any future partner would understand.
They both looked up when they heard Dean announce that everything was packed up in the truck, aside from the random bits and bobs that didn’t make their way into a box. Castiel stood up to do one final sweep around the house, checking cabinets and drawers, and making sure that everything was indeed good to go. Sam was going around the apartment with a laundry basket, tossing in all the random things that were on the counters and floor like their water bottles, a few toys, and whatnot.
It sat alone surrounded by a variety of trees and bushes, and there was a lush, green lawn out front. The building itself was at least a hundred years old, and had a kind of weathered feel to it, as evidenced by the chipped paint on some of the windowsills, and the windows being in need of a good wash. But the blue paint that had been applied as a way of contrasting with the red brick while emphasising the exterior features was in excellent condition, and Castiel would guess that it had been painted fairly recently.
“Kiddo, come here,” He cooed, pulling her into a hug as she let her tears out. “I’m sorry. You were right. Your teacher was kinda a bitch, but we’ll make this right.”
Jack got up off the ground to get a closer look, running his hands on the fabric of Cas’s sweater and complimenting how soft it was. When he turned up to look at Cas he smiled wide and asked, “You did your makeups?”
“The picture,” Dean croaked out as he tried to get his breath back. “That’s what’s holding him here. It’s in the kitchen, we’ve gotta burn it.”
He’d told Cas when they moved in that he’d move his office set up to another part of the house to give Cas their own space, but Dean kinda… forgot. There had been so much going on with the three of them moving in that Dean didn’t realize he’d put this off.
“Hey, Cas. And Dean did what? He must be feeling guilty.” Sam couldn’t keep the amusement out of his voice.
Laying his knife and fork down, and shooting Cas a look that said ‘I got this’, Dean said, “We got the ghost to show by kissing. He really didn’t like that.”
A wave of sadness washed over Castiel and stayed with them on their drive over to Dean’s house, as they ate burgers at the kitchen table, as they placed boxes into their respective rooms, as they set up Jack and Claire’s beds, and as they tucked the kids in for the night in their new home.
Breaking off the kiss, Dean pulled back slightly to watch Cas’s reaction as he slipped his hand inside Cas’s jeans and boxers and took hold of his cock. Cas’s eyes widened, and he let out an obscene sound.
“He doesn’t look old here,” Cas replied petulantly, not realizing Dean was just teasing them. Dean didn’t expect Cas to say much more but they stuck out their chin while declaring, “And I think he’s handsome.”
“No… no.” Castiel shook his head. The few angels left didn’t seem to use angel radio anymore, and if they did, it was no longer reaching him. It had been many months since he had heard anything from his celestial brothers and sisters; not that he lamented that fact. “I was thinking about how nice it would look if there were roses planted here.”
If Dean knew anything about four-year-olds he knew the things that they said were almost always unfiltered so he braced himself for Jack’s answer.
“Poor William,” Cas said sadly, before adding, “and all his victims. The people who denied his chance of happiness have a lot to answer for.”
The pit in their stomach that had been a steady ache only grew darker. The weight of failure dragging them further down.
she was just trying to help me out. I know she doesn’t think ill of me for not being able to afford anything and needing her to handle most of the kids’ expenses but…” The next words were the hardest for Castiel to admit but they knew if they didn’t say them now, they probably wouldn’t say them again to someone. “I don’t know if I even deserve them at this point. I can’t give them anything right now. I feel like I’m barely their parent. Honestly, I barely feel like I’m human. I just want to crawl in bed and sleep for a year. I keep thinking that things are getting better and then something happens and it just feels so overwhelming.”
The letter was signed by Ruth, and Dean passed it to Cas, who read it silently while Dean opened another one. This one was dated 16th July of the same year, and the loving tone of the previous one was gone. Instead, Ruth was pleading for William to leave her alone and let her marry in peace. Despite her assertions that she couldn’t be with William, it was desperately sad, and Dean got the strong impression that she still loved him.
“That’s great. I’ll tell Brian and Rebecca to expect two extra guests.” Mimi looked between them with a hopeful look. “So, you settling in okay?”
“Claire explained to me what happened when we got home and I felt like it was too important to not address. Claire, can you give her the essay?”
“Hey, Sammy, you’re on speaker. The barbecue was great, and it’s going fine,” Dean answered before Castiel could.
“Well, you were right. Thanks for the information, Dean. I’ll look into it, and I’ll let you know what I find out, okay?”
He’d anticipated that their friendship wouldn’t go past that first day’s discussion, but by the next class Castiel was already asking about days and times they could watch movies together. And that was the start of a nearly two decade long friendship.
All of the friends they saw regularly were accepting and encouraging but it was the other patrons that were worrying. People were difficult to predict and even if very few ever questioned Castiel’s clothing choices, Cas didn’t enjoy feeling people staring at them. It was sometimes easier to not bother with it.
The strangest thing happened then; Dean could practically see as the weight lifted from Cas’s shoulders at his words, and he was hit by the realisation that he’d never properly apologised to Cas before for kicking him out.
He didn’t want to say anything yet, especially since it was technically only their second week of getting used to their new morning routine. In the meantime, Dean waited until they left to clean up. He knew he wouldn’t be able to start his workday knowing on the other side of the garage door was that kind of mess.
Dean laughed and held his hands to the side with his palms facing outwards. “Dammit, you caught me.” He watched as the cat snuggled against Castiel, then reached his hand out and booped her lightly on the nose. “You wanna keep her?”
“Hey, uhm, battery’s low. I gotta charge my phone, talk to you later, okay?” he lied without really waiting for a response and hung up.
Cas almost recoiled at the sudden grip on the back of their neck but realized they’d been screwing their eyes shut for the better part of their meltdown. Dean kept the pressure on his grip and it took Cas a few moments to calm themself down enough to open their eyes.
“Don’t try and argue. You need somewhere to go, you literally just said so, and I just happen to have the space.”
Dean figured that his only option was to show Cas through his own actions how sorry he was. He would be extra nice to him, starting from now.
Jack had only just turned four when Castiel moved their little family to this apartment but Jack had the tendency to make himself at home wherever he went. Castiel knew it was probably sad for him to have to leave a place he considered home. They snuggled Jack just a little closer.
It’s not like he could blame them, if the situations were reversed he’d probably avoid himself as well but he and Cas were best friends. This had to be something they could work out.
Sitting at the table in the library with Sam one quiet afternoon, flipping through a book detailing the history of the Men of Letters, Castiel found himself asking about two cases he’d mentioned the previous day. Both cases involved possible hauntings, and Sam was certain they would be nothing more than simple salt and burns.
Dean was a pretty tidy guy. It was a byproduct of growing up with his dad. John Winchester had been a bit of a perfectionist. Everything had its place and it was most logical to put things away as you used them to limit the need to spend a full day cleaning. Dean could admit his dad had a lot of flaws but his preference for cleanliness was something Dean actually understood. Keeping his space clean made Dean feel less bogged down, like he could take off with the rest of his day and accomplish everything on his to-do list. He was proud of his home and how organized he kept it.
Dean wasn’t good at this. He didn’t know how to talk about these sorts of things without sounding like a complete asshole.
“I am sorry I misled you, though. I was under the impression that this was a cowboy movie. But there were no cows in it… only sheep. I believe that they were actually shepherds.”
Castiel nodded in agreement. “I never know what to say in those situations. It makes me feel uncomfortable.”
It was pretty early in the morning, before the sun had even come up and Dean had just hopped out of the shower in order to get ready for the morning. As usual, his bathroom door was wide open because he’d never needed to close it prior to that day. He also hadn’t brought a change of clothes to the bathroom to change immediately into because he’d always just air dried for a while as he brushed and flossed and ran some product through his hair.
So many of their friends were there that it took nearly ten minutes for everyone to greet one another.
“You should probably eat something before you take any painkillers,” Castiel advised, before taking a sip of his coffee.
It was lucky Dean wasn’t eating or drinking anything at that moment, because he would have choked on it. For a few moments he didn’t know how to react, and he stared at the floor, trying to find the right words.
They didn’t know what the future held. They didn’t know how long they’d continue working for Bobby or if they’d switch to working for Dean like their partner had been subtly hinting at. They didn’t know if they wanted to try to get back into their old field. Castiel had no clue if someday down the line they would decide to bring another child into their family with Dean. They couldn’t predict if they’d even get a dog one day. But what Castiel did know was that they’d gotten lucky with the people in their life and that as long as they had all the loves of their life, everything was going to be okay. It just took some time to get there.
The movie hadn’t been quite what he was expecting though, and he suspected that Dean would have preferred something with less romance. But he hadn’t complained, which made Castiel happy.
“I know, I’m sorry about that,” Cas replied. They were worried they’d be asked a million questions about what they had been up to and how the job search was going but Charlie waved them off.
Castiel probably shouldn’t have run off into the garden like that, but Dean’s reaction had caused him pain, and he hadn’t known that Dean was going to drink himself into unconsciousness. If Castiel had had any idea that Dean would do that, he would have stayed and tried to stop him, or slow him down at least, but it was too late to think about that now.
Walking into the kitchen, Cas messed with their shirt, hating how stiff it was compared to what they’d been wearing. They weren’t looking up when they walked into the kitchen but heard Dean ask, “Why’d you change out of the sweater?”
Castiel loved how domestic that sounded, and he glanced down at the bundle of fur in his arms. “Would you like to live here with us?”
The woman was about Dean’s age, and was standing on the front path, waiting patiently for them to appear. “Hi, I’m Mimi, your nearest neighbor… though it’s not exactly close.”
The obvious solution was for him and Dean to kiss - or even have sex - and under different circumstances he would have wanted nothing more. But, quite apart from the inevitable fallout that would come after Dean was forced to do something that was clearly disgusting to him, the thought of experiencing what he craved more than anything with the man he loved only for it to be make-believe, and the possibility of it destroying their friendship forever was unbearable.
But it wasn’t just fear of a failed living situation or needing to start over. It was fear of rejection. Fear of Dean’s rejection specifically, that made it hard for Cas to even try and talk.
Castiel slid down the living room wall until they were sitting at Jack’s side. Jack wiggled into Cas’s arms and leaned contently against their side, putting the phone in between them so Castiel could see. Castiel kissed the top of their son’s head before asking, “Do they know who the villain is yet?”
It was obviously the right place, because Cas nodded and gave Dean a shy smile before making his way over there, with Dean following behind.
Claire was still smiling to herself when Dean made his way back to the lobby and asked if she was ready to go. The mixture of her happiness and the fact that he was proud of her for sticking up for Cas, Dean decided to treat them both to some ice cream cones on the way home. Claire decided she wanted to eat inside so they both ordered double scoops before finding a booth to hang out at.
The feeling of Dean’s hand in his was both comforting and suffocating at the same time, but Castiel didn’t want to pull his hand away and risk spoiling the mood. He could maybe find a reason for Dean to let go of him, though. “I’m hungry. Do you think they have burgers?”
No one seemed surprised when Cas and Dean revealed that they were finally together, and even the kids had been excited when they’d found out about the two of them but, of course, Claire and Jack made it their mission to pretend to be grossed out every time they caught Cas and Dean kissing, which to be fair was a lot.
Dean rounded the corner just as the cat ran back into the bushes, but he obviously caught a glimpse of her, despite the gathering gloom of dusk that wasn’t making it easy to see clearly. “What was that?” he asked, looking suspiciously at her retreating form.
They could feel the weight of the stress bearing down on them each and every day. It didn’t help that they were back to working mostly evenings and nights and were missing out on spending that time with Claire and Jack… and Dean. So those rare opportunities when Castiel’s shift was cut and they got to head home before it was even dark out, those were the moments they were living for right now.
So Castiel knew deep within that Kelly wouldn’t change up their agreement and ask to have Jack and Claire full time, but the feeling of being the least successful parent at the moment still didn’t sit well in Castiel’s heart, neither did the worry for how Claire would react to the news of the move.
He let her get her emotions out and clean up a bit before the two of them drove back to the school together. Dean refused to let the situation wait until the following day and with Claire’s permission to speak with Mrs. Hanscum again, they made their way back into the office.
Deciding that the contents of the box were too painful a reminder of his unreciprocated feelings, Castiel picked it up and brought it upstairs. He considered hiding it back under the floorboards in the attic, but realising that Dean had already been left alone for too long, he settled on putting it at the back of the bedroom closet for the time being.
Dean grabbed two mugs - Cas’s special bee one being one of them, of course - and filled them both with coffee, before heading out to the garden to tell Cas the news. Dean waved at him to come over, and while he waited, he took a moment to admire the flowers. Because sometimes you just have to stop and smell the roses.
Stepping back into the house, Castiel was greeted by the delicious smell of bacon, and Dean with a strange expression on his face, as if he was up to something. Castiel took his seat and picked up his knife and fork ready to start eating, when he noticed the full mug of coffee next to his plate. It had pictures of bees and flowers, and the words ‘My Green Thumb Brings All The Bees To The Yard’ written on it, but he didn’t remember seeing it in the cupboard.
Thankfully, Bob finally seemed to accept that his attentions were unwanted, and he took a few steps back as he gave a shrug. “Can’t blame a boy for trying. It’s been too long since I saw anyone quite so delicious as Cas.”
Dean suddenly understood, and he couldn’t help feeling sorry for the poor bastard. Being stuck on Earth for years - decades in William’s case - twisted ghosts until they were fuelled by nothing but vengeance. Hell, it had even happened to Bobby. Whatever the circumstances of William’s death, what remained of his mind had obviously become fixated on the one thing that had caused him so much pain in life. Releasing him from that anguish would surely come as a relief.
Not being a parent himself, Dean couldn’t speak to the feelings swirling through his friend but he could empathize with being away from his family. Castiel was a great parent, Dean wholeheartedly believed that, and this change on top of everything else must’ve hurt.
As Dean got his breathing under control and tried to get the feeling back into his fingers, he looked over at Cas, who was staring intensely back at him.
Cas looked thoughtful for a second, before nodding then walking further along the aisle and stopping at a stunning array of orange roses. After placing a plant of that colour next to the purple one, he chose one each of red, pink, yellow, and white.
The thought plagued them all the way home and throughout dinner. They tried to engage in Jack’s endless questions but most of the meal was spent with Dean keeping Jack entertained and Claire shrugging off most questions directed towards her.
Dean felt he did a pretty decent job keeping his cool while on the inside he was fuming over this teacher. He didn’t understand how someone who chose to work with children could lack the ability to be open minded.
Castiel watched as Dean rambled nervously, before putting his mug to one side and taking the blanket from Dean. It was soft, and decorated with pictures of bees, and the socks that were rolled up inside it were similarly patterned. It was such a sweet gesture, and his eyes prickled slightly with tears as he laid his gift down and pulled Dean into a hug. “Thank you, Dean. This is so thoughtful.”
It all suddenly hit differently now he knew the reality behind the letters, and the utter tragedy of these two men who just wanted to be together was fucking heartbreaking.
“Right,” the woman said with an annoyed huff. “Claire Novak-Kline,” she yelled in the direction of the kids waiting along the front wall of the school.
Dean looked startled and a little scared, and Castiel had a flash of memory from many years ago, when he’d done something similar to Dean in an alleyway before viciously attacking him. This time he had a different goal in mind, and although he hated the idea of forcing himself on Dean, he would keep the kiss as brief as possible. It only needed to be long enough for the ghost to show itself, and then they could hopefully return to some kind of normality. Back to the life where Castiel knew where he stood with Dean, and wasn’t being constantly tormented by glimpses of a life he could never have.
Dean placed his chicken back on the plate and stared at Castiel. There was something in his eyes… something Castiel hadn’t seen before, but if he wasn’t mistaken, it looked very much like jealousy. “Oh, so um… you weren’t ever interested?”
Castiel certainly couldn’t argue with that. Despite his loyalty to Dean over the years, there had been many times that he’d questioned whether Dean cared about him at all, even as a friend. In fact, it wasn’t so long ago that Castiel had finally had enough of Dean’s abusive behaviour towards him, and had walked away.
Dean yanked Cas in for a frantic kiss as Cas slammed into him again, setting a punishing pace as he fucked him into oblivion.
Castiel had always loved nature in all its magnificent glory, and he stayed outside until dusk began to fall, happily exploring the garden and imagining what he might grow if they weren’t leaving in a couple of days.
“Yep, one day I wanna-” Dean started, but then seemed to think better of it, and quickly changed the subject. “Well, we should probably unpack.”
The last thing Dean saw before landing at the bottom of the stairs with a thump and smacking his head on the uncarpeted hallway floor, was Cas charging furiously at William with the bar.
“I’m not sure?” Dean took a seat at the foot of the bed, and Castiel set aside their rickety old laptop and gave Dean their full attention. Dean took a deep breath before speaking. “So, I know you’ve been trying like hell to find a job. And I know you’re more than capable of doing it on your own so I don’t want you to think that I don’t believe you can. But I hate seeing how down you’ve gotten over not finding anything and I think I can help.”
Usually Dean tried to figure things out on his own but since this had to do with Cas and the kids he decided it was time to try and be a grown up for a moment and actually ask his brother for some advice. He told Sam in vivid detail what had been happening since the three of them had moved in. He threw himself under the bus and confessed to not having brought it up with Cas and being too stubborn to do anything more than let it stew.
Dean however seemed to be on a mission and dragged Cas along towards the clothes, looking through racks and pulling out options for Cas to agree or veto. They had to admit how surprised they were by some of the options Dean pulled. Not that Dean wasn’t fashionable but Castiel had mostly assumed Dean would pick out more masculine clothing options being that those were what Dean was used to wearing himself, but for Castiel it appeared that Dean thought sweaters, cardigans, and flowy tops were the way to go. Castiel kind of loved all of them though they knew they’d never be able to wear them, especially not to work.
So, it was as he was standing stark naked in front of his mirror, scrubbing the towel through his still wet hair that he heard a tiny little voice announce:
The movie was beautifully shot and the acting was outstanding, but it got sadder and sadder, and the ending was just heartbreaking. Dean had never really thought too closely about how much suffering non-heterosexual people had had to endure in the past, or for a lot of them, in the present.
“I’m not!” Jack sobbed against Castiel’s chest. So much for a relaxing night of pizza and movies. Castiel pinched the bridge of their nose before looking at their daughter again. They didn’t know what they were going to do about her, but they knew getting her and Jack separated was the first step.
“Mimi seems… very friendly,” said Cas, in a skeptical tone that spoke of meeting too many people who actually turned out to be monsters.
Thankfully, it sounded like Dean was starting to wake up, and when Castiel opened his eyes again, Dean was blinking slowly as he brought his hand up to his head.
Dean chuckled at Castiel's bemusement. "Yeah yeah, I know… you don't understand that reference. Just… I made those meatballs myself, so eat up, and enjoy.”
But when Castiel walked into their empty apartment and stepped into the bathroom to take a shower, they locked eyes with themself in the mirror. In it, they saw the flakes of their cheap mascara on their face, the purple of the bags beneath their lashes, and the emptiness of their eyes.
“So, the other case… not quite as simple as I first thought.” Sam had been clicking on his laptop for what felt like hours, as Dean idly flipped through the TV channels and Cas read the
If their conversation hadn’t already been sad enough, hearing Claire declare, “I don’t like living here,” hurt more than Dean cared to admit.
“I know you are immensely capable of doing this yourself, I have never doubted that for a second. I only thought this would go much faster for you if you had some help.”
“No, Dean won’t get mad,” Cas tried to soothe though to Dean’s ears it wasn’t very convincing, “but this is his house and he likes it to stay clean.”
“So… you caught the ghost. That’s great, but how? I mean, what did you have to do to get it to show? What was keeping it in the house? Did-”
He turned to face Dean when he’d finished speaking, but what he saw on Dean’s face was not the reaction he’d hoped for. Dean didn’t look happy; in fact, he looked horrified by the suggestion. “No, I don’t think… there has to be another way.”
“What happened?” They asked immediately, looking like they were ready to wake Claire up just to have her explain.
He had limited knowledge of trains but Jack’s enthusiasm was contagious. For the entire hour the two of them played, Dean could only chime in a few times before Jack told him a new train fact or reminded Dean of the rules for whatever game they seemed to be playing. It was when Jack seemed temporarily out of train facts that Dean decided to ask the kid some questions.
Dean often chose to stay oblivious when it came to Cas. He knew the angel looked at him for way too long sometimes (okay, pretty often), he knew even after all those years he still only had a very loose concept of personal space and he knew that there was definitely something between them that didn’t quite feel like friendship. Cas was family and as far as Dean was concerned, he was like a brother to him, but then again, he wasn’t. Not quite. And Dean honestly didn’t know what to think of it, so for the most part, he just didn’t think about it.
“Cas… what?” Dean managed to croak out before Castiel quickly stopped him by clamping his hand firmly over Dean’s mouth.
“Eileen? Dean… I got a text from Eileen! She’s alive.” Sam’s face had been one of sheer happiness, and the moment they’d reached the bottom of the stairs, Dean had hugged him in congratulations.
Another compliment to add to the list. Castiel almost couldn’t breathe. It took every ounce of effort to manage a tinny, “Thank you.”
As Cas swallowed the last bit of his food, he stared at Dean, as if he’d just said the most amazing thing in the history of ever. And… were those tears in his eyes?
First, Cas might seem more human these days, but he was still an angel, and Dean reminded himself that they didn’t experience emotions the way humans did. There was no way he would want to have sex with Dean, and even suggesting it would feel like coercion. Cas would surely be disgusted at the idea, but say yes because of the case. And second, if for some reason he asked and Cas said yes, it wouldn’t help Dean and the oh so confused feelings he had for the guy. Things were awkward enough as it was, without adding one-sided feelings into the mix.
He tried to quickly wrap a towel around himself and stave off Jack’s oncoming sobs, feeling completely out of his depths at the moment.
“You let me and the kids move in with you without a second thought,” Cas started listing. “You’ve dealt with the mess me and the kids have thrown into your life. You’ve been taking care of my children for weeks just because I needed someone to do it. You handled the situation with Claire’s school. And now you’re telling me you’ve found me somewhere I can work that will allow me the flexibility I need, after I’ve spent months looking with no luck?”
“I woked up and it was dark on the stairs and I couldn’t find the lights. So I comed in here for help.”
“That sounds great actually.” It warmed something in them to see Dean’s smile light up across his face, but Castiel pushed that feeling down, unwilling to acknowledge it.
Mimi peered at Castiel, and her smile faltered a little. “You’re feeling anxious, aren’t you? I know these gatherings can be daunting, but try not to worry. No one’s gonna make you mingle if you don’t want to.”
“Food was great,” she replied, walking towards the living room. Castiel shut the door behind them and followed along. They both usually chatted for a bit on the days Castiel dropped the kids off. They could hear their children off in the bedrooms giggling over something. “How’re you doing?” Kelly asked once they were both sitting on the couch.
“You’re never too old to learn new stuff though, right? Like how sex feels as a human. And yeah, we’re not counting that April bitch, ‘cause from now on it’s gonna be with someone who loves you.”
Sam shook his head, before taking another mouthful of beer. He seemed a little nervous, which was now beginning to make Dean feel nervous too. “Yeah… no. See, it looks like this ghost only attacks people who are LGBT. The house was bought most recently by a gay couple, and they had to move out after it tried to kill them. A pair of hunters were brought in to try to catch it, but it didn’t come back.
To be fair, Dean had never looked at them in quite the same way he was looking at them now. It was the same way he’d looked at Castiel a few weeks ago on the front porch, when Castiel had almost thought Dean was about to kiss him.
Cas was taking his beekeeping very seriously; reading everything he could on the subject, and watching every documentary he could find. His enthusiasm was so infectious, even Brittany, who’d shuddered at the thought of bees at Dean and Cas’s first neighbourhood barbecue, had started dropping by occasionally to help Cas out.
“What if I am?” Dean was instantly on the defensive, and he considered ending the call, but Sam would just call Cas if he did, wouldn’t he?
Dean looked relieved, as he took something from his shoulder that Castiel hadn’t noticed. “Well, that’s great. And to celebrate your rebirth, here’s a gift. It’s a pair of socks and a blanket. I got ‘em at the same time as the mug, and I was gonna give them to you one day at a time, but then things went to shit… And I forgot all about them, and anyway, now it kinda feels like the perfect timing.”
Yeah he’d been an ass about the mess but that didn’t mean Dean wanted them to hide away and act like they didn’t even live there. They were kids for god's sake. They needed to play and know that they could set down some roots. Dean never wanted them to feel this way.
“No, don’t be! You’ve had a lot going on, we’ve all been there. But tell me about the kiddies. I haven’t seen them in so long!”
“Thanks, Cas, you too. I mean, good luck with Dean. You’ll need it.” Sam said with a smirk, as he took Eileen’s hand and squeezed it.
“Awesome,” he declared as he scrolled through them, before handing the phone back to Castiel. “I’ll get the coffee, while you choose which picture we’re gonna print out.”
Thankfully, Cas eventually seemed to accept that he should do as Dean asked and started unbuttoning his shirt.
many dead animals into the house, and she and Dean had a mutual understanding. She didn’t make Dean sneeze too much, and he would occasionally stroke her under the chin while no one was looking. It was the perfect arrangement.
Arriving back at the house, Castiel stopped to admire Dean's handiwork from the previous day. The clean windows and newly painted sills looked really good… professional, even.
The fact of the matter was, when all was said and done here, Dean knew he was probably going to get hurt.
Castiel nodded, and reached out to stroke his thumb over Dean’s cheek. “My grace is almost gone. I’m practically human now.”
Cas’s shirt was finally off and had joined Dean’s clothes, and as Cas’s hands reached for the zipper of his jeans, Dean decided to be bold. He bucked Cas off his legs and, with more awkward manoeuvring than he would have liked, he managed to get Cas lying on his back, staring up at Dean in surprise.
He’d sat down opposite Dean at the table, and after avoiding looking at him for the longest time, he’d put down the coffee mug he’d been staring at and cleared his throat. “Dean. I. So, when the Empty came to take me-”
At the look on Dean’s face, Sam immediately started to backtrack. “I mean, I just thought you might want to stay here. Of course if you don’t want to, it would be great to have you back at the bunker.”
Perhaps that was why Castiel had called Dean in the first place. Dean was a problem solver and a protector at heart. If there was a problem he couldn’t solve, he did anything in his power to find someone who could solve it. Dean offering Castiel a place in his home wasn’t necessarily out of left field, now that Castiel thought about it, it was just the way their friend was hardwired. Taking care of people was Dean’s thing.
Sam stared at Cas for a moment as if something was registering, before remarking, “Cas, you… you’re eating.”
With their talk finally out of the way, the two of them spent the night talking through household responsibilities and discussing what they felt would be fair. Castiel made a list of expectations they felt the kids would agree to, thinking it would be more than fair to ask them to put away any of their belongings if they took them out into the main living spaces.
“Nora can’t schedule me for the daytime shifts anymore so I’m going to go back to working evenings and I don’t know what I’m supposed to do. I won’t be able to get the kids from school and over to the sitter that I used to use since she lives at the apartments and it’s thirty minutes from the kids’ school to the apartment, twenty minutes from there to work but I only have twenty minutes from the time school ends to get to work. Fuck!”
Keeping mostly out of Dean’s way had an added benefit; that of Castiel being able to conceal from him just how much his grace was fading. It was still there, thrumming under his skin, but it was no longer the force it had once been, and if it continued fading at this rate, it was entirely possible that Castiel might eventually become human again. He couldn’t help worrying that Dean might decide that Castiel was no longer useful to them and kick him out of the bunker. Logically, he knew that was unlikely to happen, but the memory of being left to fend for himself when he was at his most vulnerable was an ever constant painful reminder of that possibility.
He was still wiping sweat from the back of his neck as he walked into the house and heard the sound of Cas’s frustrated voice from the living room.
Cas was signing for Eileen, and she signed something back and giggled as Cas grinned at her. Sam made a bitchface, and Dean realised that Sam wasn’t sure how to navigate the subject of his brother and his best friend kissing. Dean knew he should handle it sensitively, but he couldn’t resist messing with Sam a little bit.
Cas tangled his fingers in Dean's hair, and Dean got his hands underneath Cas's shirt as they made out like a couple of teenagers, which was pretty funny considering Dean was the wrong side of forty and Cas was as old as existence.
Yet again, Castiel found himself speechless. Not only was Dean unbothered by these people thinking they were a couple, he seemed to be actively encouraging compliments on how good they apparently were together. Obviously it was necessary to keep up the pretence, but what Dean was doing seemed to be above and beyond the call of duty.
“Oops,” Claire said, knowing she wasn’t supposed to let the kitten into Cas and Dean’s room since it messed with Dean’s allergies, but everyone knew Dean was the biggest sucker for that kitten out of all of them.
Brian was standing behind an expensive-looking grill, holding a pair of tongs, and wearing an apron which bore the words ‘The Grillfather’. It looked like he was greatly enjoying himself, and Castiel watched as he chatted amicably with Dean while he placed burgers on the plates Dean was holding out. Once that transaction was completed, Dean stopped by a table laden with other food items, and by the time he returned to Castiel, the plates were full.
It appeared to be a paragraph written about the most important people in Claire’s life. It was sweetly written, talking about Kelly, Cas and Jack and how much her parents meant to her and how even though they didn’t all live together anymore they were still a family. There were a few markings here and there for misspelled words or missing punctuation but what Dean noticed glaring up at him were a few “they’s” circled in red ink and a note in the margins that read,
To say Castiel had had enough of Dean’s mixed messages was an understatement. “Dean Winchester, you are the most infuriating human I have ever met,” he growled, then before he could continue - and say something he would regret forever - he stormed off down the path and up to the front door. Internally kicking himself for misreading Dean’s feelings yet again, he pulled out his key and unlocked the door as Dean caught up with him and put his hand on his shoulder.
Sam and Dean explained everything that had happened since Cas had been sucked into the Empty. Cas had expressed both pride and heartbreak over Jack’s fate, before Sam had disappeared to have a private conversation with Eileen.
kick you out for something like this,” she assured. “You three are probably his favorite people in the entire universe.”
I'm really proud of myself that I managed to finish this fic and I hope you enjoyed reading as much as I enjoyed writing it.
Castiel was relieved that Mimi then proceeded to reel off information about James and Heather, and how much she worried for their marriage, and that she didn’t like Mark living all on his own because he was such a sweetheart, because it stopped Castiel from daring to tell her the truth. That he was more relaxed the last time they had met, not because they hadn’t had the pressure of a social gathering, but because since then the friendship - and any hope of a deeper relationship - between Dean and him had completely fallen apart.
Castiel had heard that stroking a cat could be therapeutic, but he hadn’t realised just how true that was until now. Every time he rubbed her head, she purred, and the sound increased in volume until he could feel the vibrations rumbling through him. It was very pleasant, and he felt a sense of contentment as he closed his eyes and rested his head on the wall.
“Okay, so that doesn’t sound like it’s gonna be a problem.” Dean put his now empty bottle down and shrugged. “Vengeful ghost… been around for years… we go in and catch the bastard, and relieve its suffering.”
Castiel didn’t have the words to express how much this one thing meant to them. They were glad they hadn’t been stubborn enough to decline the help and had readily accepted the position at Bobby’s repair shop. The job wasn’t anywhere near what Castiel’s old job had been but they were starting to realize that they didn’t mind.
Dean came over his hand, and as he got his breathing back under control, he rinsed away the evidence of his arousal. He wasn’t even going to worry about what he’d just done making things even more awkward between him and Cas, because at this point that probably wasn’t even possible.
“Can we take the bed?” He asked, still standing in the doorway unwilling to risk Claire yelling at him again.
After they all said hellos to each other, everyone started paring off into seats around the long table they’d been given. Castiel grabbed one of the available seats near the end, sitting next to Charlie and Benny, two of Dean and Cas’s friends from college. Dean was still mingling with some other friends but the seat next to Castiel was open just in case.
wanted to see Cas naked; touch him all over, get his hands on what was creating that bulge in his pants.
“Or...” Dean said, winking at Castiel. “Why don’t you come here, and we’ll show you the house, and tell you everything.”
“Can I get a hug?” Dean asked, hoping the air was officially cleared between him and Jack. Thankfully the four year old jumped up and threw his arms around Dean’s neck, all forgiven.
Luckily, Castiel had spent enough time around Sam and Dean to understand that humans often pretended to dislike people they cared about. It was baffling, but then so much of their behaviour was.
“How’s Cas?” his brother tried, a bit hesitant (rightly so, Dean thought) and Dean groaned in frustration.
wouldn’t have a problem with it. But Dean couldn’t pretend to be gay… with Cas; not when he had all of these inappropriate feelings for the angel. And Cas, he’d sacrificed his life for Dean after telling him he loved him, but not in that way, obviously, and things were awkward enough between them already. What if them living together and pretending to be a couple, made their already strained friendship even worse?
Hence the begging, here on the front step to the rickety apartment they’d had to move into. Here, standing in the clothes that hadn’t been washed in two cycles since there hadn’t been enough change to wash both the kids’ clothes and Castiel’s at the laundromat. Despite the crap that had been ripe in their life the past few months, this was the first time Castiel had outright asked for someone to give them a break. If only it had mattered to their landlord.
“See, Cas, the neighbors are talking about us already,” Dean said with a chuckle, all charm and friendliness.
Cas was digging in one of the flowerbeds - of course he was - and he startled when Dean flung the door open and called, “Hey, Cas. Look what I found.”
Castiel’s chest tightened at Dean’s words, and he wasn’t sure if it was because he didn’t like that they were being dishonest with Mimi, or because he was already becoming attached to the house. Or maybe it was a little bit of both.
By the time Dean got back the house was back to the way he liked it. Had this happened hours ago, Dean may have been thrilled, but seeing it now all he felt was a pit in his stomach. It was close to midnight. How long had Cas stayed up cleaning? How much unnecessary stress had Dean just put on his friend’s shoulders? He needed to fix this. He promised himself he’d talk to Cas first thing tomorrow.
They felt the open communication suited their family well. It didn’t always mean a four year old and an eight year old truly understood, but it helped in situations like this.
“Cas! I’m sorry! He just popped up in the bathroom when I got out of the shower and spooked me and I think I scared him.”
“Hey, Cas. What’re you looking for?” Dean put his hand on Cas’s shoulder as he spoke, and Cas whirled around so fast, his face almost collided with Dean’s.
Castiel was extremely puzzled by Bob’s question. He wasn’t interested in anyone but Dean, and he thought Bob knew that. “I don’t,” he answered, eventually.
As he’d hoped, there were a number of cans of paint, and Dean decided that if he mixed the colours from a couple of tins he would get the shade he wanted. Once he’d got it mixed sufficiently, he grabbed a brush and a ladder, and got to work.
“I’m sorry he was playing at your desk,” Cas said. They sounded sincere, truly, and on a better day, Dean may have been able to bite his tongue and accept it and move on. But today was not one of his better days.
“Don’t worry, she’s been warned if she tries to talk about you past asking how you are, the kids will be hauled out of there faster than she can blink. Besides, I don’t want to see the fight she and Claire would get into if she even tried.”
By midday, they were dressed and respectable, and Dean had prepared some food for everyone, with lots of extra green crap for Sam. He was looking forward to seeing his brother, and a little nervous too. He knew it was time for them to stop the co-dependence and have healthy grown up relationships, but it still felt strange acknowledging that to himself.
“Fine.” He turned to Cas then, and his tone had softened. “Cas, you and I will work together as fake boyfriends, if that’s okay with you.”
Then they were in bed together in a sleazy motel room, but after that, there were mercifully few scenes of an intimate nature.
In all the time Castiel had known Dean, they could probably count on one hand the amount of times Dean had outright shared his thoughts and feelings. Knowing how rare it was to hear Dean speak frankly like this, Castiel softened. In the past few years, they had been worried about Dean being lonely in such a big house but their friend had always smiled and told Castiel he was fine.
A moment of doubt crept in, and Castiel wondered if he should let Dean go. But no… he had to get this over with. Gazing deeply into those green eyes he loved so much, Castiel saw fear and uncertainty, and Castiel knew he had to do it now, before he changed his mind.
It was harder than they expected it to be, but once the words were out, it felt like one hurdle crossed. They needed help and Dean was willing to be their person. Always Dean Winchester.
By the time they made it into bed, Dean had managed to change the bedcovers, and Cas looked like he could sleep for a week.
The two of them had cleared out some space in Cas’s closet, finally throwing out the shirts that were no longer salvageable. But because Dean was Dean and knew how to do practically everything, there were a few shirts Dean was able to sew the buttons back onto for Cas to keep. As if Castiel didn’t need another reason to think Dean was absolutely perfect.
“I’m such a dumbass,” Dean said, reaching out to take Cas’s hands in his. “I’m so sorry, Cas. I shot you down because I didn’t wanna hear you say you didn’t mean it in a romantic way. I,
They moved away, and this time they joined with a larger group of people - Patricia, David, Shelley and Mandi - who all smiled warmly as Dean introduced himself and Castiel again. Before the conversation went any further, a small boy ran over and looked up at them shyly before tugging on Shelley’s hand. She leaned down to speak to him, then nodded.
