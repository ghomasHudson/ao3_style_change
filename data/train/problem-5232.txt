P.P.S It is pretty hard to make no comment when you are being asked the same thing A MILLION TIMES! In the end I just started saying 'it's complicated' and then moving away as fast as I could.
P.S. I've been modding the guest suite a bit. If you're moving in long-term it needs to be more personal to you. Any requests?
It was why I created that Thor clone. I mean how many times has he been the factor that changed things to our favour? What if without him...we are just waiting for the next big threat to come and wipe us out? I have too much to lose now...the idea of James being killed or inslaves...I can't deal with it. It makes me feel sick. But...I realise the clone probably wasn't the right way to go....i just...i don't know what else to do...
A Vine? Seriously? Are you going to be dressed up like Darth Vadar? You won't actually cut off my arm right?
I told you Osbourne was up to something :D I know I said I’d stop saying that, but hey, after finding some definitely-dodgy villain-esque equipment hidden away, I get to gloat. I’m done now, probably.
Oh yeah, that is a thing that is happening. Natasha has convinced Steve to catch up on Disney movies. Actually, he was surprisingly okay with it. Then again, this is a guy that saw Snow White at the movies and thought of it as cutting edge because it was animated and in colour. Hell, he saw The Three Caballeros and thought it was quote, ‘pretty good’, even though it makes precisely zero sense. We’re up to the 2000s now, and if he doesn’t watch Enchanted soon I swear I will not be responsible for what happens to Clint.
(Also he was not born on 4th July. That was a lie made up by the USO tours as part of the Captain America brand. His birthday is in, like, November. I was crushed.)
I try to ignore the papers, but it is hard when you are on the front page every day being called a menace.
When we finished the campaign and everyone voted with you... it kind of felt like the end of the world. I still don't see how people could side with it, and even you have to admit Sin's smear campaign against me probably had a lot to do with it. She just wanted to destroy me from every angle, to make me lose everything that mattered. I don't want her to succeed. I'm not Cap any more, I don't represent the people any more, but I don't want to lose you. But I can't compromise my beliefs, either. This act is wrong, and sooner or later people will see that. In the meantime, I want to get my people out of that prison. A life sentence for non-registration is heavy handed, disproportionate and unjust. Any sentence at all is unfair. I guess I can't be an Avenger any more, but there are still people I can help; and I'll do it by protesting against this act and against the imprisonment of people whose only crime is non-registration.
Also, I meant you and your Aunt could go back if she wanted to, not that you could go back on your own! I’m not saying you can’t handle it, but seriously, this reeks of you trying to be sneaky. What do you think is going to happen that you don’t want May to know about?
Thank you for your recent letter. However, due to the high volume of inquiries of this nature Mr Stark receives, he is unable to respond to each in person. If you wish to further pursue your enquiry, you must ask your legal advisor to arrange for a court-sanctioned paternity test. As a minor, it is acceptable to have your parent/guardian undertake this action on your behalf. If successful in your application, Mr Stark will be happy to submit to the procedure.
We don’t really do the whole couples-invite thing. Especially not if your Aunt is going to make a fuss. Why did you tell her we were dating? It’s kind of just between us and our friends. I mean, I don’t mind, I’m sure she won’t tell anyone, but you could have checked…
And I’m pretty sure Loki was involved. He shows up at the Tower for reasons unknown, apparently does nothing when you’re busy inhaling hallucinogenic gas, and then disappears the same time as Osbourne? Come on, kid. And let me see this so called ‘birthday present’. I bet you $10 it’s a nice hallucinogenic gas bomb, pre-used.
An hour in make up is nothing for a lady, kid. (Even though it’s kind of hard to see how they found so much to do with such short hair). And you needed a nice outfit in case any behind-the-scenes shots get leaked. Half a dozen papers are already leading the story with how I ‘abandoned’ you, if they see you in comfy jeans and a sweater they’ll probably start crying neglect.
She is already freaked out over the whole Osborn thing, I didn't want to stress her out any more! Anyway now she thinks I have a potential boyfriend, and gets to fuss, which will take her mind off things.
You're going to be okay. Really. I've found someone to help, I just need to get them inside. You'll be home soon, okay?
Well, our agreements finally outnumber the disagreements, so that's good, right? Maybe we can start by working on some of those things we agree about.
Loki has been a perfect gentleman, so you can stop worrying. I know you weren't that keen on leaving him with me after the party, but he told me Thor had words with him about being on his best behaviour or Mew-near? (Seriously how the hell do you spell the hammer's name?) wouldn't be happy.
Lucy isn't exactly the wall flower type, she is getting plenty of attention all herself. I'll tell her to watch out for bad guys anyway, though what could Harry really do? He barely passed Gym, he isn't exactly a match for Spiderman.
We’ll get Loki either way. I don’t mind if it takes a bit longer if it means we can keep you safe. Look, I haven’t been a dad to you and I’m not asking to be, but I at least have to make sure you’re okay.
That guy deserved it! There were kids in that Bank he was trying to hold hostage! Okay maybe I was a little hard on him, but maybe a couple broken ribs will teach him a lesson! Anyway the car I threw him into came off much worse, you might need to pay for that.
about twenty litres of cookie dough and/or Phish Food and then passes out on the nearest available flat surface. Seriously. He was once asleep on the floor in the lounge for three days. Three. Days. That’s basically a coma. And he woke up fresh as a daisy, didn’t even have a crick in his neck.
You got him to say it?! How on earth did you get him to let you record him saying that? You know if you put that on the internet it would probably go viral in hours right? Did you ever explain the dick thing? It is kind of adorable he didn't realise XD. Thank you, I enjoyed that.
Apparently he has some sort of invisibility bracelet and he decided to hide in your house because he, quote, ‘didn’t want to go back to Asgard where everyone hates him’. And then Thor was all like ‘I know, young one, but Midgard cannot forget about your past self’s crimes’, complete with passive aggressive glances at me. Anyway, Thor starts lecturing him about it being no reason to hide in people’s houses and snoop at their letters, and Loki argues back and sulks and generally acts very much like a teenager, and Cap and I are just standing there totally confused because Thor definitely referred to ‘the time when you lived as a girl’ and Loki didn’t question it, and then they got into a lengthy argument about who smelt most like a bilgesnipe. And then Thor actually made him apologise to me for the whole hiding-in-my-kid’s-house-reading-our-letters thing. Which, needless to say, is so not accepted. Anyway, long story short, Thor’s taken him back to Asgard and your house is Loki-free. I want to get in there with Bruce before you go back though, make sure the little snake hasn’t hidden anything nasty. If he’s gone back to Asgard, he probably wanted to go back to Asgard.
He gave me an ipod, but admitted he didn't know much about modern music so it has mainly just got Disney songs on it.
I don't really remember too much about my Mother. I sort of remember the big things, like that she used to read me a bedtime story and would never let me sit in the front seat of the car (she thought the back was safer in an accident), but I couldn't tell you her favourite colour or what food she liked or anything like that. I guess we got on well, but I was only a little kid, I'm pretty sure all little girls adore their Mom at that age. Maybe it would had changed if she hadn't left me with my Aunt and Uncle and gotten killed.
I stepped in because what you were doing was wrong. And you were too putting other students in danger. When I pulled Loki out of the way you put a hole in one of our walls! You know you are probably going to get sued now right?
Are you upset about me spending time with Cap? I told you I won't tell him I'm your kid. He is just being friendly. Anyway you are the one who suggested I train with him. You can't really complain if I say yes..
I don't think Aunt May would be too happy if I suggested dropping out of school, even to work for Stark Industries. She has her heart set on me going to college. I was thinking of applying to MIT, isn't that where you went? Did you enjoy it?
EDIT: As of July 2017, Photobucket will no longer allow images to be embedded into 3rd party websites without paying a large subscription fee. As such, we are doing our best to replace all text message chapters with normal text as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience, and just pretend the text below is a nice picture of Penny's Starkphone screen.
The only reason I’m not home right now is because Cap is being an asshole and saying we have to take out this one last base first. And don’t think I don’t know you’re deliberately avoiding my calls! You think you can just casually drop in ‘Oh, Loki showed up and he knows I’m Spiderman lol’?! I knew he was up to something! The second Thor takes his eyes off him he slithers back. Do you know where Loki is now? Does he know where you are?
It might be the serum, but I'll wait till he is a little bigger before I run the tests I think... then again maybe I should find out now...we'll have to up security if he has inherited your serum. I mean you need permission from the president to give a blood sample, I don't want people targeting him for his.
You're right about the PR though. Look, next time one of my guys calls for back-up I'll let you know. We can have a team up, right? Show we're all on the side of good, even if we disagree about exactly what form it should take. Just like you and me. Maybe they'll even believe I haven't left you then.
I still think you are being hard on him though. He seems like a nice guy, even if he isn't the best father around.
Well, now I feel like I’m just trashing Cap’s image. But whatever, I’ll carry on. Maybe shy isn’t quite the right word? He gets stage fright and he’s pretty introverted, he’s nowhere near as friendly as he pretends he is in public. The truth is he’s a total dork who snorts when he laughs too hard. And I’m like 99% sure he snores.
After months of silence you can contact me however you like, about whatever you like. Maybe we can finally work something out. This fighting is distracting from what we're supposed to be doing, which is protecting people.
It was really sweet of Cap to offer to pay for my treatment, even if I don't need it. Does he get a lot of money from people licensing his likeness or something? The hospital bills would have probably been a lot...
Look, I’ve said it a hundred times, I’m not really your dad. I’m not saying that to be mean or to escape responsibility; honestly, if I did have a daughter like you I’d be like, super proud. I say it because I know I can’t take any credit for you (except for excellent genetics) and, given that I wasn’t around to raise you, I don’t have any authority over you. I have no right to call you my daughter when I was never there for you. Don’t worry, I know I have no right to tell you what to do either. I can’t even say that if I had known about you I would have been involved sooner, because I was kind of a jerk that way. But hey, if I had raised you, you probably wouldn’t have turned out so well. So maybe you should count yourself lucky.
P.S. Sorry, but with banter that lame you’re capped at an 8. You were too busy trying to do a ‘man voice’ to think of any actually witty responses, weren’t you?
As for working this out... I'm sorry, but I don't see how we can without settling this debate about the act once and for all; or at least, not without having it out properly and privately. I'm not talking about whether the act is law or whether the public support us, or even about the two of us agreeing because it doesn't look like we will. But I think maybe we do need to talk about it, talk about everything that's happened, or the poison is just going to build up again.
STEVE: Will it take long for him to heal? I was reading on the internet, they said children that premature... sometimes they can't breathe, or their heart doesn't work right, or...
I didn’t hear anything about you until the test came back. It was kind of a shock, I’ll be honest. I’m not a father. I don’t mind writing for a while, but don’t expect anything to come of it, okay? And I’d appreciate it if you didn’t say anything to Harry or his father about it. I guarantee we’d both end up in the papers.
You DARE to threaten to take my son away! You don't know him! You don't know how to get him to sleep, or when he needs to be fed! You don't know which books he likes or what toy he wants when he wakes up!You don't know anything because YOU AREN'T HERE!!!!
Even if she was considering it, though, why Atkins? Why would she choose someone who had gone out of their way to destroy my reputation? Do you think she was already being influenced?
Okay, re-read that little speech of yours and honestly tell me that doesn't sound like you are about to start making Cybermen.
At least your Aunt likes Steve. She keeps calling him ‘a nice young man’. If she finds out I’m dating him she’ll probably think I’m a corruptive influence. Which I totally am, but that’s between me and Steve.
Anyway maybe it is a good thing if someone steps in and tells him to stop. I mean he is only a kid, and this is a dangerous job. He should be worried about homework and girls, not whether a guy with metal arms it gonna snap his neck next time he rescues someone from a fire.
Maybe we could do something small for my Birthday closer to the time, like go get dinner or something.
You can't call because I don't want any smart-ass journalist hacking your voicemail for gossip! Stark email is un-hackable, as long as you've changed your password from Freedom123 that is >:P
I know you won't approve, but how many times has Thor saved our asses?! How many times would we have lost the fight if Thor hadn't been there to help? We need him! And he is gone...so we made the next best thing...
of you. Don't you think that skirt was a little short for national television? Or was that the plan? Blind them with your amazing thighs so that they ignore the flaws in your argument? :P
But see, I don't think there's much that is actually impossible. If one way doesn't work, you just have to try another. So humanity is going to keep beating the crap out of itself, that's human nature and it doesn't seem to be changing any time soon. So we do what humankind always does, we make a tool. Other animals evolve, the giraffe can't reach the leaves so it evolves a long neck; the first fish that crawl out on land can't fly so eventually they evolve wings. Humanity can't fly so they build the aeroplane. We've never waited on our better nature to come out. We still need something, some push in the right direction. We can learn from Ultron, get it right next time.
Have you ever heard of a self-fulfilling prophecy? If you keep treating Loki like he is going to turn into a murderous psycho then he is probably going to turn into a murderous psycho!
I didn't choose the colour. Turns out I haven't quite worked out all my powers yet and the ability to make my own suit is among them. I'm still working it out but it is pretty cool, and a lot easier then wearing my suit under my clothes in this stupid weather.
We are not going to have sex! We are just friends! You know what we've done since you guys have been gone? Watch Tv and build a fort. Real sexy. And for the record I didn't invite him, and I don't think Thor did either, he said he just wanted to give me my Birthday present.
Right. I guess sometimes I forget not everyone has my record-tracing prowess. Seriously though, Pepper opens anything addressed to me so maybe put a mark on the envelopes or something.
'The Star Spangled Flan with a Plan' is of course a reference to the wonderful 1796 Broadway, which you should all go read if you haven't already :)
There isn’t an intern application. Pepper and I hand pick all interns ourselves, you have to be head hunted. I don’t usually even meet them and I probably won’t see you, but I do see the work they’ve done before, including yours. ‘I only won the science fair because the competition was so low’, my ass. Bug cameras- cameras on actual bugs- that’s adorable. I want you to work on them this summer, see if you can improve the resolution. See, I’ve been looking into the Ultron project again, and one thing I’m considering is having them measure heart rates so they can sedate when people get out of hand. But imagine implanting it biologically into someone so they know they shut down if they try anything- bye bye jail breaks. I swear 90% of heroing is recapturing the same like five guys. Anyway, I’m interested in your whole body-heat-power thing, so basically come work for us for the summer, experiment, fool around with your ideas, and see what you have to give me in the fall.
Remind me to buy Dum-e a present. Jarvis, on the other hand, could have asked where James was, and let me know if you refused to answer or were acting strange. You could have trusted me to do the right thing, not something I said in anger because I was frightened you were going to self-destruct! Because you'd cloned one friend, got another accidentally killed, and were drinking to deal with it! And then you ran off to who-knows-where and tell me you aren't going to let me see him!
So Pepper just came and threw the cheques in my face, which I guess is pretty much what you did.  I’m sending them back to you, because you shouldn’t be an idiot about money that could change your life. Use it for college, give it to charity, I don’t care. It’s probably less than you would have got if I’d been in your life from the start and it sounds like you probably could use the money given that you apparently don’t know enough about billionaires to realise they don’t read their own mail. Especially not if you send it to their office. From now on, if you want to write me, write me at home. Or better yet, send me an e-mail. (Almost like this is the 21st century! I hope you know I’m dictating this to a piece of software. Who still uses a pen? I don’t think I even own a pen.)
I do believe I'm right about the registration thing though. Nor everyone is you Steve, not every can be trusted to just run around with their powers un checked... I know i've said this before, but what if it was James' school? We can't just carry on the same as before.
Can I ask? What made you decide to go public? I mean, I would have thought it would have been pretty easy to cover that you were Ironman, like said he was your body guard or something. But you choose to let people know it was you...isn't that really dangerous? Don't you worry about people coming after you or your loved ones?
Yeah I was planning on watching the documentary. I probably still will, but i'll take it with a pinch of salt. Did you two not get on very well? That must have been hard.
I know you are mad, but what were we supposed to do?! You can't pick and choose which laws you follow Cap, that is why we don't kill villains even when they deserve it! If we let un registered heroes just run around doing what they want, then what would have been the point in setting up the act in the first place?!
Hope you are safe. Hope they didn't get in your head and make you do this, because could really use a rescue. Kind of bleeding a lot.
Just a few short weeks ago, the nation was shocked when Captain America, previously thought to be a paragon of traditional values and the rule of law, took an opposing position to the proposed SRA and walked out on his wife. Now we find photographic evidence of the golden boy's dark side- covered up for over seventy years.
If you don't want to talk about the act. Fine. We'll talk about the baby. But since you aren't here, I hope you know i'll be making all the decisions. Which means super high tech crib and pushchair, not whatever you were planning to make out of wood :P
Not that any of the other participants got to say much. Stark and Rogers did not hold back as they gave their opening statements, slamming each other's opinion without mercy. Stark delivered a technical breakdown of exactly how registration would work and why it was a good idea, packed, of course, with her usual wit and one-liners. Cap, on the other hand, delivered an impassioned and rousing plea for the American people to trust in the good of the people that chose to protect them, not because any government told them to do so, but because they wanted to. Both strongly implied that picking the other side would be Bad for America. Unfortunately for Stark, this was always going to be a more convincing statement from a soldier and a patriot who literally wears the flag for a living than it is from an ex-weapons manufacturer. However, the battle was far from over.
Turns out it doesn't like loud noises. Kind of wish I'd realised that before it trashed my first suit, but.....
I've lived with Aunt May since I was 7. She knows about the letters, she is fine with them, but I think she worries a little.
I'm sure what ever Pepper got out of you, it was less than what was deserved :P and there is a lot more to female relationships than just gossiping!
There’s a reason I didn’t want Harry to know about us. You know that means his dad knows, right? Which means this will hit the papers sooner or later, and the fact it hasn’t yet means Osbourne is up to something. Which is probably also why he’s disappeared. So yeah, better invest in some sun glasses and a hoodie, kid, there’s a media storm blowing in.
Look, why don't you list exactly what your issues are with the act and I'll try and work out a compromise for them. Okay?
Do I need to remind you again that I have super strength? If I wanted Flash beaten up, I would do it myself. But I don't, because that is the wrong thing to do. You don't need to worry about me, I can handle Flash, I've been doing it for years.
So does 'encouraging' registration include rounding up our friends and putting them in a prison you and Pym were designing for criminals? Or is there some reason that's
I still think Xavier’s school would be good for you. From what I gather, they’re big on the whole ‘accepting-who-you-are’ thing.
So seeing as Spidey keeps running away from me, Cap’s going to give it a go. We think the guy might just be a teenager, so we want to keep an eye on him. Put in a good word, okay? And now back to making my ‘Suck What/Who’s Dick?’ mixtape ringtone!
Do you want a summer internship or something? I’m not around the SI offices much but I’m sure I could swing it for you. Or anywhere you wanted to go, really.
then I wouldn’t have had to tell you we were going and you wouldn’t have to say you want to come and we wouldn’t have to say no etc. etc. etc. Let’s just skip to the end of the conversation to the part where you give us the key and stay here, okay? Loki was targeting you for a reason and we don’t know how much he knows.
Don't waste too much time on trying to clear my name. I'm bringing my A-game to the debate tomorrow and I plan on winning. If we still need to prove my innocence after that we can, but we're on a time limit with the vote. You did remember to register for a polling card, right? :P
It is as of yet unclear what effect this will have on the consequences of the SHRA. Despite Rogers' call for peace, many believe it is likely that his anti-registration forces will continue to resist, particularly now some are calling Rogers a 'martyr'. Natasha Stark, Rogers' estranged wife and figurehead of the pro-registration movement, could not be reached for comment.
If what you are saying about Steve is right, then why was it peace in his vision? Why was it that which scared him and not something like losing the fight? Deep down I don't think Steve wants the fight to end because it is too much a part of him now.
an excuse for violence against women. That's why we are starting our campaign, calling on Captain America to confess to and face justice for his crimes. That is what a real hero would do.
I don't know where Loki is either, he was here before I got knocked out. I hope Osbourne didn't do anything to him.
Mary Jane told Harry where I was staying remember? It isn't like he is spying on me. I don't need to go to a safe house! Super Strength remember?
A Revenge trip makes it sound like Spiderman is planning to hurt the guy when she finds him. That isn't right, she just wants him brought to justice. That guy killed an innocent man, it isn't fair that he gets to stay free, and Spiderman is the only one doing anything to try and catch him! If she does nothing then he could end up hurting someone else.
P.S 'He is an asshole' is not a reason. Unless you give me a real one I'm not avoiding him. You know I'm meant to be the teenage girl here not you :P
As to the house, we'd put your lab out in the shed, obviously. Never known you to chicken out of a bet. But then I guess you know you're wrong this time, right?
Oh don't worry about me sweetheart, I know how to put a disguise together. You do like red heads right? <3
As for James, you know stopping him from being cute is physically impossible, right? He just is cute. Or, he is cute at least 80% of the time when he isn't screaming. And he's fine with a bottle, you know he's fine with a bottle, he uses a bottle every day while you're at work. He's also displaying the 'Three Signs Your Baby is Ready to Start Solid Foods', so we might try that later.
Maybe it's safer that you go to Florida. I'm going to try and bring Jarvis back online this weekend- or some version of him anyway- so I'm going to be on lock down. I'll call you after.
a mass murderer! Apparently Asgard doesn’t value human life very much or they would have locked him up and thrown away the key, not just given him a slap on the wrist and said ‘well, he
Special notice- Regular reader Emusam has just begun a wonderful fic featuring Loki, Wanda, Penny and Vision and y'all should go read it :D It's called Chaos Magic and the link can be found at the end of the story :)
And I know you say the list is safe, but these things have a habit of getting into the wrong hands. For example, you say only one list, but what about the government workers taking down the details when the Superhumans come in? All it takes is for them to have a little too much in a bar one day and it's going to be 'Hey, did you know Daredevil is a
Anyway, it seems like we have more of a plan of what to do. Let's deal with the clone first, and then the sentencing. Any idea how long this house arrest will last? I didn't exactly pay attention.
No-one said anything about you manipulating him, I'm sure he wanted to do it, I just think it was irresponsible to let him. Still, you're ahead in the polls again now, so at least it's worth him getting his head kicked in, right? Seriously, I hope you've got some extra security sorted for the school until this dies down; I'd sleep better. Poor kid is caught right in the middle of all this- and you're right, he's not even old enough to vote in the referendum when the time comes.
b) we have trained them up a little, at least. We just want to make sure you’re all properly educated about hero-ing so you can make an informed decision and, if you decide to be heroically active, can keep yourself safe. We’re all about giving back these days.
Anyway, Pepper was fantastic, but sooner or later she realised that it was more a best-friends-with-benefits set up than anything else and dumped my sorry ass. Then in the process of the dumping she realised I knew and had known exactly what it was from the start, and then… well, you know how she runs Stark Industries now? THAT HAPPENED.
P.S. When you get better, we're going to have a talk about you hanging out with Loki. Even if he is a girl now.
Sin is also your therapist, but I guess you got that. What is this century's obsession with spilling all their personal business to strangers?! You could have talked to me.
Alright, but if you and Osbourne end up fighting over the skies of New York, don't say I didn't warn you.
P.S. I’m still not convinced Loki didn’t cast some creepy voodoo on your house, so you’re going to have to wait until Strange can go take a look. Sorry.
P.S Whether or not the surprise will keep will depend on how long you are gone. It might be spoilt for you by the time you get back.
The following chapter is presented in the format of a script/transcript. It's something we tried hard to avoid as we wanted to keep with letter format, but we felt this would be a scene people would like to see on-page. So, direct from Blackthorn and I roleplaying it over an instant messenger...
We really need to work on the P.R of the heroes. If they can't do their jobs then what is the point of the vote?
The security there isn't as good as my other places, it doesn't even have Jarvis installed! Look i'll head down there tonight, see what happened.
If I do that then Aunt May will get suspicious. Look I'll just avoid him like the plague. It won't be too hard, that school is pretty big after all.
Loki is my friend, and yeah he has done some stupid and creepy things but those were mainly down to him either having to hide from you, or not being able to trust you to help. Except the spiking the Punch thing, but I hit him pretty hard for that!
How are you doing on your own anyway? I know you look after him all day, but it is harder when you don't get a break. How is he doing with the bottle? He seemed a little fussy with it before I left...maybe we should go back to breast feeding when I'm back. My breasts would certainly prefer it..they are aching like hell... Not sure how I'd have coped without the breast pump.
Well after the first teacher quit, I told Aunt May I didn't want to do any more. I think she wanted me to try again, but Uncle Ben told her they shouldn't force me. He started showing me how to fix things after that, which was useful, since our appliances broke a lot and we couldn't always afford to replace them.
Cap has teenage fangirls, huh? Well, lucky him. Maybe someone should point out that for someone famous for fighting Nazis he looks an awful lot like their ideal master race. And that’s only because of what my dad did to him. Did you watch that documentary in the end?
I'll be fine! I have Dum-ee and Jarvis, plus now I can stay in the lab as long as I want without a certain someone nagging me to go to sleep.
Okay, I admit it, you're right. It does feel weird e-mailing you when you're in the next room. But I'm right too; this will be easier than talking. If we can't interrupt each other, and if we can check what we're writing, it's much harder to fight. And I am so tired of fighting. If we can both just lay out at the same time where we're at right now, it'll help.
Oh. Well I guess I can come if you were doing it anyway, just ignore the birthday thing. Am I allowed alcohol though? I mean I'll only be 17...
I didn't find anything at her office. It was totally empty, no furniture or anything. I checked manually and with a scan for secret or concealed entrances, but nothing. Sam went to see the realtor Atkins hired the office from and they said she'd only taken out a month's let, signed the papers last week. For the address, she put mine. My address from 1943, before I shipped out. The block doesn't even exist any more. But whoever she really is, she knows a lot about me.
I want us to be able to move past this. I want us to be a proper family! One that argues about stupid stuff like if James goes to private or public school (he is going private by the way, but no boarding schools!) but I know it isn't going to be that simple to put everything behind us.
Well done on winning. You ran a good campaign and the people obviously support you. I bet you won't believe this, but I'm proud of you.
I’m having Jarvis put the Tower in lock down until we get back. STAY WHERE YOU ARE. And answer your phone!
They want to put me in charge of registering the super heroes. They think that maybe if people can see that it isn't just some Government guys in suits keeping tabs on them, but rather long serving experienced heroes, they'll feel more comfortable. They want to work with us on this Steve, us and SHIELD.
I told you, I'm not going to a school that far away. I'm fine training with Cap, he is a good teacher. I bet I could totally kick you ass now, suit or no :P
Jen also brought up the clone...she thinks she might be able to get an injunction against its use if knowledge of its existence were to be leaked to the public... she thinks she can argue that as long as that thing exists, registered heroes have no guarantee that they won't be also have clones of themselves made into weapons.
Fine, i'll be nice to the assholes taking kids hostage. Don't want to upset the press. Not like they've ever needed an excuse to bad mouth me before.
None of their opinions matter, Penny. They'll print inflammatory stuff just to sell papers. Just let them get on with it, seriously.
I admit, I didn’t take it into account that he would try to find you, or freak out when it turned out you weren’t in hospital like you were meant to be. I didn’t expect him to apparently offer to pay for your care either, but I probably should have done. Anyway, I’ll come clean with Steve too (about you not being sick, not about the rest) and they should leave you alone. So, okay, my bad. It was mostly Steve’s fault for going overboard though!
P.S Steve was frozen for 70 years so he still looks like he is in his late 20s, thats all girls really care about.
'You can see it in the way he cuts questions off before the speaker is finished,' Laura confided, referring to the Captain's open Q&A at New York University yesterday. 'Particularly when the speaker is a woman. You can also see it in the way he squares up to his wife in the debates- this is a show of dominance. Remember this is a man who started his career as nothing more than military propaganda but who seized control and insisted on having things his own way. He was also raised in a time that sadly believed women ought to 'know their place', in a very traditional background. There have been tensions in the relationship ever since they got married, and now we see them coming to a head.'
Cap is on Wanda duty. Funnily enough, she’s still not keen on me; and if Cho can’t get Speedy Gonzales back from the edge it’s probably only going to get worse. Besides which, Cap’s got that whole human-experiment deal to bond over with them.
Sooo anyway, Steve is really competitive huh? I guess that is what makes him a good Avengers. He didn't try to trick me while we were playing, but he did nudge me off the sofa a few times when I was about to win. He said It was accident, but now i'm not so sure.
Steve says we’ll come to dinner. So thanks, I guess. Do you need us to play straight bff or will she survive the shock of us being a couple? (Although, Cap is depressingly strict on PDA. Even if we don’t she probably won’t notice.)
P.S I may not have given the plans for my suit to the Government, but I have always been accountable for my actions! And even if the act passes, they are still Stark Company property. All that will change is that I have a licence to fly the suit, one that can be taken if i ever go too far.
We’re on our way back now. As far as we can tell, Hydra is gone, and we have Loki’s pixie stick. You know, the one your little psychopathic best buddy used to MIND CONTROL people. As if we haven’t had enough of that lately. Anyway, I’m gonna run some tests with Bruce, see what we can find out.
'There's almost nothing to suggest Ms Stark actually believes in what she says,' Skyers explains. 'She is always very concious of how she holds herself, wanting to appear open, relaxed and sincere; as we'd expect from someone who has lived their whole life in the limelight. The question then becomes- what is she trying to hide by behaving this way? And if she isn't truly in favour of the act, what is she trying to achieve?'
Cap thinks Spiderman's a Girl? Really? It doesn't seem that way to me. I mean I guess his voice is a little high but there doesn't really seem to be enough in the chest area for it to be a girl. Maybe his voice just hasn't broken or something yet?
Gonna be shut up working for the next few days, probably won’t remember to message. We’ll get dinner or something after?
I just want to forget all about this, pretend it never happened, come home and take care of you and the kid. But I can't. Because when people start putting their own loved ones ahead of everyone else's, that's how wars start.
The thing is, your father knows much better how to help you than I ever will. I will always be here for you, but the press and super-villains and alien creatures... what do I know about things like that? I know you want to use your powers for good. I wish you didn't, because I want you safe, but I also know we raised you better than to sit by and do nothing if people need your help. Your Uncle Ben would have been just the same. And I can't help thinking that by bringing you out to Florida, I only helped that monster to take over. I'm so sorry.
For a genius you are kind of an idiot! You know he'll be wondering not only why you wanted the tape, but also why you lied about me right?
Your aunt is back from Florida and wants you to go home as soon as you’re well. I tried telling her it wouldn’t be safe, but she’s pretty adamant you’ve only been in danger since you came here. Anyway, she’s your legal guardian so there’s not much any of us can do about it.
We reached out to Steve Stark, formerly Steve Rogers, aka Captain America, for comment. Stark, who now lives with his wife in a modest house in the suburbs, re-iterated his continuing opposition to enforced registration, but said he did not feel he could offer personal comment on Nomad as he no longer 'keeps up with superhuman affairs' and is instead 'focusing on his personal and family life'. He listed his interests as cooking, gardening and watching
Oh yeah I ran into Loki the other day, or rather he ran into me. He was getting chased by some weird monsters and I had to stop him falling off a roof. He seems nice..though I'm pretty sure he hit on me..which was weird. Anyway I'm guessing Hawkeye jr is that female archer in purple I've seen around. We've not officially met yet, but I've seen her gang around. I notice no one tells them to stop superheroing :P
I know that is bad, but what was I meant to do? I was like being peer pressured into being his friend! Anyway isn't there some saying about keeping your friends close and you enemies closer? Well it was like that.
P.S. You weren’t going to go to prom? But everyone goes to prom. Just buy a dress and put it on my tab or something.
to do, they were protecting civilians! And instead of helping them, your side shows up, beats them up, arrests them, and takes them to some prison in the Negative Zone that I
Just invite some friends along, okay? It doesn’t have to be a big deal. Although it doesn’t sound like those girls are being particularly good friends right now. I thought you said Gwen was smart? Listen to me, kid, this Flash asshole? He can’t abuse you for years and then act like it’s all romantic because he likes you. If he likes you he should have, you know, been decent to you. I would tell him to get lost, preferably violently. And tell Gwen to stop romanticising dickheads before she gets hurt.
In a way this should come as no surprise after Cap campaigned so fiercely against the act. However, this stubborn refusal only serves as another blow on the reputation of a man that has already come under heavy fire when it was revealed he routinely beats women as part of his capers. Now Rogers is going against the clear will of the American people- the very will he, as Captain America, usually claims to serve and protect.
As for Atkins, she would probably sue you for assault just to bring down your reputation too. Or say it was because you were frightened of me and lashing out. You know, I've been trying to look into all that. I guess I wanted to know whether it was just someone looking to make a quick buck or someone who actually has it out for me, but whoever she is she's well hidden. I prefer a face-to-face confrontation, all this subterfuge wears me out. But just to check... you don't think there's anything in what she was saying, right? I know the way things have worked out right now but I never meant to pressure you into being a housewife or anything, it's not your style. Don't worry, I have resigned myself to being the one to stay home with the kid once I'm back with you both. We'll just have to get a sitter when we're out fighting the bad guys :P
The press are ridiculous, I swear. Heaven forbid a woman not have a baby, it isn't like I have one of the biggest companies in America or anything!
Did you ever watch the Wizard of Oz? Look for that. Except my boots and a mine shaft instead of a house and red sparkly pumps.
I don't think I ever really said it before, but I know i've done wrong. I don't want to start making excuses but the truth is...the reasons i've done so many stupid things was...I was terrified.
I can't take Steve to the prom! He'd get mobbed, and anyway I still don't want to go. I told you parties aren't my sort of thing. They are just an excuse for people to act like idiots, and from the way Liz Allen has been glaring at me lately, I wouldn't put it past her to set up some major prank to embarrass me...
I don't want to go to Florida, but I can't leave Aunt May...I'm not sure how she'd cope on her own. Plus it would break her heart....
I thought about dying my hair or something, but there is no time before school and it'll be pretty pointless once they've seen me once.
We must also inform you that we were made aware of your situation by a high profile donor who wishes to remain anonymous. They would, however, like you to know that they are willing to pay the entire cost of your treatment if necessary and urge you to contact your hospital immediately. We would like to join them in urging you to follow this advice and get the help you need. Childline are available 24/7 on Freephone number 0800 1111 and have specially trained advisors to support you even when things are at their most difficult.
You want an honest answer? Fine. I'd do exactly what i'm doing now, stop being Ironwoman! If it was going to put our family in danger, then i'd stop. It is as simple as that.
How was Loki meant to predict what was going to happen? And even if he stayed he would have just been knocked out as well! I'm sick of arguing about this, you aren't being fair!
The problem is, though, how you're going to get in and out without being recognised. Most people miss me if I stick on a hat and some glasses, but you're pretty recognisable whatever you wear. The hotel isn't one of your regular haunts, right?
FINALLY. The ‘Penny’ has dropped :P I was starting to think I could make out with him in your kitchen and you wouldn’t get it. Steve is mine, so back off.
How does it feel, Captain, to be the one defeated? To have let your family down so dramatically? To have your nation despise you? I wonder, what will you do when you're desperate? What will you become?
That aside, I hear he’s going to do some training with Spidey. It’ll be a little while before you can do it at the Tower though, I need to reprogram the training room. I’ll do it when I get chance, okay? Soon, for sure; I just have my hands full with the Ultron project right now. Your mom didn’t leave any of her notes round the house, did she? Anyway, in the meantime I guess you can do it on rooftops or whatever, right? It’ll be ready for you soon.
It isn't simply a case of changing my name, people know my face now because I'm your daughter. The moment it comes out i'm Spiderman there is no going back.
As for the Captain America thing...well that was part of the deal. You'll be on house arrest for the foreseeable future, and you are banned from wearing the Captain America costume ever again. The Government are looking for someone to take your place.
It would really help if you felt you could support the reforms to the act too. Think about it, okay?
Apologies for the late update, Blackthorn and I have been at a wedding. (No, not to each other :P) I am also going away on holiday next week, which means updates and/or replies to comments may be delayed. Hopefully not, but we'll see :P
The fact is, you need something to tip the scales here. The public is already against the Captain, but most of the superhuman community is backing him. You may have the government behind you, but ultimately if the superhumans no longer respect the government that isn't going to do you any good. You may have persuaded Spiderman over to your side, but you are going to need to turn more of them if you want to win. You need to break Captain America's reputation. Clearly he isn't law abiding any more, but you need to make people believe he is a bad person. Make him someone no-one would ever want to follow. Cap can say all he likes about the girl he beat up on the USO tour being a Nazi, but he couldn't say that about you. If you tell people he abused you, the heroes confidence in him will disappear overnight. Especially if we claim you told me in therapy.
But don't lose heart! Blackthorn and I finished writing this one several months ago, which means we've had time to get started on our next project. It's not a sequel, it's not the same universe, but it /is/ letters. This time, Stony will be taking more of a central role... but with a twist, of course :) That story will be starting in November, so please join us there!
If you want to come see me, come see me. But your aunt won't like it. She told me never to come near you again, etc. Was she like this with Loki? She realises he's way, way more dangerous than I'll ever be, right? At least to you.
It isn't a giant rabbit! I do remember our 'no giant stuffed animals' rule you know. It is something you'll like, trust me.
I'm sorry I won't be there when you wake up, but I can't sit still while James is still out there...even if you are hurt.
There are arguments in every marriage, but rarely so public as this. Yesterday evening, in front of 200 leaders of the public and private sector as well as the assembled press, Captain America and Natasha Stark led the arguments 'For' and 'Against' the introduction of a Superhero register. Stark was being supported by a whole army of top-level politicians from every party whilst Cap only managed to produce Sam 'The Falcon' Wilson, and our friendly neighbourhood masked vigilante Spiderman, surely the poster child of the whole 'secret identity' argument.
I want to see you but you know I can't. We have to be careful... If I'm caught again I can't help you look. The papers won't shut up about how if I go back, I'm going down for a long time. I need to make sure James is safe first.
I've had Jarvis do a scan for places the coal could have come from, there is a place just outside of town that looks most likely. I'll meet you there.
I don't know anything about the cabinet, it just looked like a weird black metal cupboard with a lock and some black out glass. I only even looked at it because Flash and his neanderthal friends were trying to crack it open. Harry probably let them try so they wouldn't think to go searching for a wine cellar.
'It's ridiculous in this day and age to suggest a woman's behaviour is due to her decision whether or not to have a child,' Doctor Laura Atkins tells us. 'It's the sort of attitude we'd expect a man of the Captain's era to have- and that I'm fairly convinced he does.'
I've sent the police on a goose chase down to Jersey, so we can have a little family time before you hand yourself in.
As for the alcohol, come on, you must have tried it before. You don’t need to play innocent with me, I was stealing sips by the age of ten. Anyway, I’d rather if you’re going to get deliberately and/or accidentally drunk, you do it around a bunch of adults too old and boring to do anything other than laugh and get you sobered up then a bunch of moronic high school frat boys trying to persuade you to take off your clothes. Basically, you will be there, booze will be there, I’m not stopping you. Just go easy on it if you aren’t used to it. And don’t accept anything from Thor. I don’t think he’d risk giving you any, but I never know with that guy. You almost beat him arm wrestling so he probably thinks of you as Xena, Warrior Princess now or something.
I’m not sure Spiderman does have it all under control. If she’s just out for revenge, she’s doing it for the wrong reasons. Understandable, maybe, but if the police catch her there will be trouble. I don’t think she’s going to get Cap to back down.
Mary Jane uses 'don't be jelly' sometimes, it sounds better coming from her though. I'm not sure i'm cool enough to use it.
I know you don't agree with Fury's decision to take your Daughter in, but threatening to blow up one of his Helicarriers is just going to land you in a cell down the hall.
I've been re-reading Sin's note. She wants me to suffer from this, that sounds like her main motive. Chances are, that means James is still alive because she'll want to pull some big stunt where I'll see it.
It's okay about the tower, Cap says he knows of an old gym we can use. Apparently the owner gave him a key or something, so he can go in whenever he wants. As long as he replaces the punches bag, Cap told me he buys in bulk because he goes through like 3 a week. I guess he finds his strength a little hard to control when he gets into it.
P.S. Not you too. I buy Steve a Wii and all he wants to do is collect fossils. (I guess he identifies with them :P) Anyway, he just completed the collection last week. He’s very proud.
You really think I'd be a good Mom? I'm not even sure I could give up Alcohol for 9 months, let alone take care of another human for 18 years.
What do you think the plan was?! The plan was to keep you safe! I told you to leave and you wouldn’t. I asked Thor to intervene, and he wouldn’t. I had to do something, and, FYI, I was trying to capture him. Not kill, capture. Because even if everyone else has forgotten, he is
I'll see what I can dig up on the trial, it might not be my Dad who buried everything. The Government probably didn't want it out that a Nazi spy got onto American soil either. There is bound to be something somewhere.
I'll take the pin, but only if you promise not to have someone spy on us! I'll call someone if I need help, but I don't want anyone hiding behind a bush watching us.
I can't help feeling like encouraging you to regularly play with your hair is sort of unleashing a monster... but I'm kind of looking forward to seeing what you come up with.
Perhaps, with this in mind, Captain America could be excused. Perhaps not all the problems with the serum had been ironed out. Perhaps Rogers suffers the same rage and insanity as his German counterpart. But this newspaper says there is
Don’t try playing the ‘teenager’ card with me, it’s not going to fly. You know exactly what you’re doing. And sorry, but one huge lizard man does not an Avenger make. You’re locked down until we’re back. (Although, I did watch the footage. I give you an 8/10 for bad-assery.)
DO NOT TRUST OSBOURNE. What can I say to make you believe he’s bad news? Pretend I said it, and then believe it. He has the Bugle in his pocket. He’s trying to discredit Spiderman and you can bet it’s not just because of intellectual property. Please be careful.
Speaking of, I hear the trials of those you imprisoned in the Negative Zone have been put on hold while I'm tried. I don't want that, you have to get them to start up again. You can't just keep people in jail without a conviction, and I still think life is heavy handed for not-registering. The punishment needs to fit the crime, and you can't think a life sentence is fair. If it's not fair for me, it's not fair for anyone else.
Of course, the more likely is explanation is that, hearkening back to her single days, Ms Stark has been out partying and mingling with any and every single young man on the block. But as long as she continues to remain resolutely silent on her personal life, all we can do is speculate!
play the piano. What he does is painfully hen peck out Three Blind Mice and something he insists is called ‘Dashing Away with the Smoothing Iron’. Apparently he used to trade his cigarette ration for lessons during the USO tours. I think he was conned, to be honest. Anyway, I demand that you have a rematch on the arm wrestling and video it, so I can remind him of it when he is being insufferable with the whole ‘Leadership is a burden but I’m going to boss you all around anyway’ act. That guy drives me nuts.
P.S. Spiderman showing up that fast? Real subtle. Now every kid at that school will realise Spiderman goes there, Loki included. Good luck.
Steve's decided Vision should come out to Florida with you. He says it's to keep you safe if you really can't risk Spiderman-ing any more. I think the real reason is probably because he thinks I can't handle having him around.
Great, I'll let Aunt May know you'll come. You shouldn't have to worry about her, she is pretty accepting of everyone :)
Are you sure Wanda can read minds? Because I'm pretty sure as soon as they worked out she could, Osbourne would have been there trying to work out how to weaponise it. The asshole doesn't even have any loyalty to Hydra, he was just in it for the money and the easy access to illegal materials; not to mention as a way to carry on with his human-enhancement stuff. He's trying to strike up a plea bargain with Shield, saying he'll work for them if they let him go. Pretty sure Steve, Nat and Clint are going to tell him where to shove it, but you never know what Fury will do. So tread carefully.
I haven't told Mr Osborn anything. I haven't even told Harry about the powers and he is my oldest friend. Mr Osborn does seem interested in Spiderman though, he has asked me a few times about the pictures and if I know him. He knows my money situation isn't great (or wasn't since you sent us the cheque. Thanks again for that) so he is completely willing to believe I'll camp out on roof tops all night waiting for a chance to get a picture of Spiderman to sell.
Finally, please find enclosed details of a 2% stake in Stark Industries shares (an equivalent stake to members of the board). At the time of writing, shares are valued at $2,003. On your eighteenth birthday, your stake will automatically increase to 25% if you have not previously sold your shares.
Bruce is Bruce Banner right? I've read his research, it is amazing! It was a shame what happened to him. Do you know if he is going to start doing research again? I think he had some really great insight before the...incident.
I know Mr Osbourne has been working on sentient A.I, but it isn't that great. He showed it me once. Honestly it was kind of creepy....it had this weird female voice and couldn't do much other than follow basic commands.
Anyway, the notebook pages would be great. Your mom was a smart lady. And don’t think I didn’t notice the annotations you put on the copy. Let me guess, you wrote them on the first copy and then made a second to make it look like your work was part of it to begin with? You have a good brain in that head of yours. You know if you feel like quitting school SI would take you, just saying. You need a little polish, but your potential is incredible. I think if you’d had the same money and opportunities I did as a kid, you’d almost be level pegging where I was at your age. Stronger though. I couldn’t have beaten Cap, then or now. Please please film it. Thor getting beaten isn’t nearly so satisfying. And remember, he’s not a god. He just visited earth before we knew what aliens were and that’s what folk assumed. My money is on you, given that Steve gives him a run for his money.
Get in touch with Murdock. Maybe Jen too. She might have been on your side in the war but I bet she thinks the sentences are too harsh as well.
I take it from your silence you have decided not to take me up on the therapy offer. I can't say I'm altogether surprised- after all, you are a genius. I'm sure you've worked out that the newspapers would pay good money for anything you chose to tell me, and, well, if you aren't confident that I would keep your business private I suppose I can understand. So instead of trying to reassure you of my discretion in the full knowledge that you'll never believe me however honest I am, let me paint a different picture.
I promise I'll visit as soon as they let me. I can't believe they've bared you from having visitors until after the trial! You didn't need anyone's help to break out last time, so why do they think you'll need someone now. Idiots!
What? It’s on? Oh, uh, okay. So Tony’s asked me to record a special message and, uh, here it is. [pause] Hey Hitle- wait, is this a message to Hitler?
Those plans weren't meant to be used that way, but Pym is part of the team the Government set up and when he suggested it...I didn't put up a fight.
Please find enclosed a cheque of $507,440, payable to your legal guardian, intended to include the following:
P.S Well now he knows that Spiderman isn't a terminally ill, maybe he'll leave her be and you guys can get back to your Disney movies.
Natasha has managed to send me a message. It's too risky to reply but she's pretending to be possessed in the hope Sin will let her near James. Please tell me you managed to plant the tracker.
I know you've rejected me in every sense, but I just wanted you to know my door is always open, under whatever terms you want. If you want a confidential session, that's what we'll do. I just want to help you cope with your situation.
Did you have to tell Aunt May about Loki though? She is freaking out and is talking about picking me up from school. I love her, but even with my lack of popularity I can't take the hit of my Aunt showing up to walk me home from highschool....
Osbourne knows you are living here? Now I am definitely going in to get a scan of that cabinet. If it’s just shoes, we’ll soon know. But this whole thing stinks of a scheme to me. We might have to pull you out to a safe house. I’m heading out now, hope school was okay.
It isn't just you. If I saw Sin now I'd snap her neck just as quickly. She took our Son Steve, you can't feel guilty about wanting to kill her. She is lucky I didn't burn her alive.
Urrgh, and I have to tell you something else too because Steve is insisting and given how pissy he's been lately I don't want to make it worse. He hasn't been right since Ultron. And he won't tell me what Mildred Hubble showed him, either, which I'm pretty sure means it's that that's bothering him. You're tight with the Witch, right? Can you ask her what she showed him? And while you're at it, how about convincing Pietro to calm down and stop trying to kill people? I keep having to stop him going after Osbourne and it makes me feel dirty.
I had Jarvis wait 24 hours, so that he wasn't panicking every time I left James with a baby sitter and forgot to mention it! It wasn't about me not trusting you! If I didn't trust you I wouldn't have let you know at all!
And yes I'm talking to the school about uping security. I've been talking to the head of education anyway about getting some protection installed in schools, you know since...the incident. Midtown will be our pilot school before we roll it out across the country.
You’ve never heard of me being with a guy before because this is my first time having a relationship with an adult. Remember I said Osbourne, King of the Dicks, outed a thirteen-year-old kid to try and distract him? Yeah, surprise! That was me. I still kicked his ass in the contest that year and for like the next five years, so you know.
I can't let this happen, Nattie. I'm sorry. I have to fight this. I don't know how or what I'm going to do, but I don't think I can come home yet. I'm sorry.
Second, if you just want to hand the guy over to the police, why not let us help? The more people that are looking, the easier it will be, right?
Like Flash Thompson who apparently has been making my life hell since I started high school because he apparently has a crush on me, but doesn't know any other way of showing it other than acting like a child who pulls the hair of the girl he likes. Also he it isn't like he could ask me out since I'm such 'a huge nerd'. You know if I hadn't had to deal with Loki I think I might have head butted him.
I doubt Cap will let me film me beating him in an arm wrestle. Maybe I can film the match agaisnt Thor, but i'm pretty sure that guy is going to win. I don't think Relative strength of a Spider is going to match up against the power of a God somehow...
P.S. Latest opinion polls are putting the 'No' vote at 52.5%. :P I hope you have something good to pull out at your little press conference tomorrow or you are going down. (And not in the usual way I mean when I say that. I'm saving that for the next secret liaison....)
Steve was just worried that I had a problem with him dating you. It sounded like he was worried about coming between us, it seems important to him that we have a good relationship. He is always talking you up and defending you you know :P
I told you I don't like them talk about you like that! You aren't a bad guy Steve, in fact you are better than most. They don't get to talk bad about you.
I know you hate it, but me being at school with him is probably best for now. I can keep an eye on him and call you if he starts to do anything dodgy. If you go after him full throttle you are just going to push him underground. If he really is evil, let him think we trust him so he lets his guard down.
I asked Harry about his Dad, he says he's been ill the past couple days, but with what I don't know. Harry didn't really go into detail, and I know it is best not to push when it comes to his Dad. Oh, Mary Jane kind of let slip about you being my Dad to him aswell by the way. Sorry, I know you didn't really want him to know. I asked him to keep it quiet for now.
You are right about me having not been in the lab lately, but i'll admit I had a hand in this. It wasn't meant to be used against other heroes, it was only meant to be used in world ending situations...
I'm glad Johnny's okay. Really though, Sue would be better off just remaining neutral if she's that worried about staying safe. Still, just so you know, anyone who wants to come on my team has to swear off violence related to the debate. We can't do much about that 'mob mentality' you think exists, but we can at least stop supers fighting amongst themselves. This needs to be a proper discussion done in a mature way, otherwise what's the point of me being here and you being there, probably not eating or sleeping nearly enough? :P
I guess you really don't open any of your own mail. I mentioned it in the first letter, my Mom died when I was a kid, my Step Dad too.  There was a plane crash when I was Seven. My parents left me with my Aunt and Uncle and just...never came back. I've lived with my Aunt May and Uncle Ben since then...but it is just me and Aunt May now. Uncle Ben was murdered about a year ago...
I will fight this. I'll fight you if I have to. I'm not letting you lock up good people for no reason without even a trial!
But just in case I can't e-mail you again, I just want to say that you're going to be a good mom, so don't worry. You'll be much more like Peter and his aunt than Howard and you, because you know what not to do. You'll be great :)
Okay, what? You are not seriously blaming me for Loki being creepy? Why won't you listen to me when I say he's not your friend, he is up to something! He is climbing a pile of corpses to try and get to the top and if you keep this up the next one is going to be yours. Remember, I gave him the benefit of the doubt when I left him alone in the Tower with you, and how did that turn out? You and the twins kidnapped and Loki trying to trade Harry for you, which meant Harry found out who you are, which meant we have to illegally detain him until your aunt gets you out. Your identity is about to be uncovered because of him, and you're sitting there blaming me? Don't buy into this reincarnation bullshit, kid. So Thor says he died, so what? Clearly not a big deal to Asgardians. And don't tell me Loki couldn't predict Thor would find a way to bring him back, even I would have seen that one coming. So how do you know this isn't all some scheme to try and get stupid, gullible people to trust him again? Seriously, WAKE UP.
I knew you wouldn't give up completely, thats just not your style. I'd rather we both left it all behind, but I guess I can put up with it. Just make sure it really is only campaigning and nothing else! James needs his Dad.
We're just arguing in circles here. The problem is, this whole 'war' is getting out of hand. Our teams clashed again last night, and I can't tell my guys not to fight people that are trying to drag them off to jail for not following a law we don't believe is right.
I guess I have to congratulate you. Getting Spiderman to unmask like that on television? That's a pretty powerful image. Especially as when this thing started he was supporting me. You know, some warning would have been nice. I'm surprised you didn't come gloating that you were about to pull that particular rabbit out of the hat.
It sounds like you've worked out a lot of the things I had issues with already, or at least improved them. Thank you.
During the trial, Rogers gave no indication of planning a break out, instead sitting quietly and stoically as the evidence mounted against him until he was called upon to speak, at which point he gave a plain account of his political beliefs and his objections to the act, but refused to comment on individuals or their actions. The only crack in the sentinel's armour was when he was asked why he decided to turn himself in. Rogers repeated the information he had given in his press statement, claiming he wished to avoid further bloodshed, but not before glancing up to the public gallery where keen-eyed journalists spotted his estranged wife, Natasha Stark.
How come you’re such a Spider-fan? I tried talking to him the other night and he was kind of rude. Just ran a mile when I got near. I think he might be up to something, so tread carefully okay? And that goes double for the Osbournes. They are always up to something, fact.
I love you, I love you, I love you. I don't know what will happen now... hopefully they'll just continue with the trial. But they will probably add escaping onto my list of charges. Would they accept it as exonerating circumstances if I prove that I was just trying to rescue my son? Although, no-one believes he is my son, do they? They think I'm your abusive husband and that when I left you decided to father a child with a teenager. A teenager who we now owe about 5,000 favours, by the way.
Natasha Stark was taken into hospital late last night for what is believed to be pregnancy complications and the early onset of labour. She was accompanied by May Parker, who has been living with her for several months since her nephew and ward Peter revealed his identity as Spiderman.
Okay, honestly, I don't like the idea of psychologists or therapy or any of it. I feel like we should be able to sort ourselves out. But I don't know, you seem to rate therapy in general (recent events aside) and Sam seems to think it'll help and I just want things to be right between us, no matter what we have to do.
I'm sure your life has changed a lot since your husband left, and I know being in the limelight it can be difficult to find someone to talk to those changes about. You are an amazingly strong woman, but you don't have to be strong alone. Many women suffer at the hands of men who, publicly, seem like charming and decent citizens.
He seemed a little upset that he wasn't able to help in the end, but cheered up a bit when I told him I appreciated the effort. Then Aunt May invited him to stay for dinner. I think she likes him.
Although... we seem to be past that now, at least. Maybe it's time I sent this and came in there. I'm gonna prove to you that one of me is all you need.
P.S Oh before I forget, you know how I promised to stay away from Loki? That might be a little more difficult than I thought. He sort of goes to my school now, and is in my class. It is weird, he aged like 4 years. At first I didn't recognise him, but then he got introduced and there aren't that many people called Loki around after all. Don't worry though, I'm pretty sure he doesn't realise I'm Spiderman. He thinks I'm just a normal girl in class.
Well if you are sure, I won't say anything until after the vote. I hate that people are thinking about you like some kind of wife beater though. You are the sweetest guy in the world, I know you'd never hurt someone without good reason.
I also believe that Mrs Stark's current state of unconsciousness may caused by a form of hypnosis. It would also explain why she did not seem to register James' absence for so long.
So did Mr Totally-sincere tell you what he did with Harry after the deal fell through? Or did he conveniently omit that part?
What, you’re yelling at me in all caps but you won’t actually speak to me? Stop being such a child. You know until I saw your e-mail, I was worried you were mad at me for dating a man.
Peter and her seem pretty close, from what I can gather she basically raised him after his parents disappeared. It is nice to see a family that actually get on...
I appreciate that you were trying to look out for me, I really do. But I'm not helpless! I have some experience dealing with bad guys and even more dealing with teenagers. You need to trust I can handle things sometimes okay?
Sorry, but no can do on the friends front. This place is enough of a target as it is, being Avengers HQ and all, without letting people know we actually stay here long-term or telling people ‘what it is like inside the tower’. All of us maintain other addresses and we tend to flit in and out a bit. I’m sure your friends are great, but they don’t exactly have security clearance. I can offer you a beach house party or something?
I asked her about what she showed him, she said it was fear given form. It could be something subconscious or something from the past. Like with you it was a fear of failure, and with Steve it was the war ending, because why would the world need with a Super Solider if there is no war?
Also be on the watch for Loki, who is apparently a twelve year old now and super trustworthy (not). My life is nuts. Anyway, word is he’s goofing off with Hawkeye Jr and her band of ragtags. Anyway, you can bet it’s a scheme, so be on the guard against Asgardians bearing gifts. Given the whole teen-hero thing, he might try to recruit you into whatever he’s forcing on them.
I talked to Thor again. He’s going to take Loki back to Asgard and stay with him there. I know it means we’ll be an Avenger down, but on balance I think we’re all going to be a lot safer. Anyway, the Ultron project is getting off the ground and that will help plug any gaps.
P.S I'm not sure what kind of business rivalry you have with his Dad, but Harry is my friend and I trust him.
PLEASE NOTE, from this point on the fic will be making heavy references to the Age of Ultron Movie! If you haven't seen it yet, beware of potential spoilers from now on!
Anyway you are forgiven or whatever, and Aunt May wants me to invite you and Steve down to dinner to say thanks for having us. Please note that this invitation is not optional.
To be honest, Pen-Pen, we were planning on some ‘revels’ anyway. So you can either come and have cake and presents or you can come and pretend it isn’t (almost) your birthday. You can still do the happy families stuff with May when she gets back.
You are right about things getting out of hand. I've been out of the lab a while because of James, but we are heading in today because Hank has something to show me. I think he might have some idea about some kind of enforcing unit to start taking you guys in, rather than other heroes. I'll make sure they aren't too dangerous.
I'm not trying to upset you. I'm just telling you what Wanda told me and trying to make sense of it...maybe I was completely wrong.
Do you need me to do anything to help set up for the party? Or should I just stay out the way and let your staff set up?
I'm not trying to be sneaky, I just want Aunt May to have a nice vacation. She hasn't had a proper break in...well probably years! Anyway she never gets to see her sister now they live so far apart, it'll be good for her to catch up.
Blackthorn and I are, as always, going to be attending Alcon this year! Unfortunately, as great a con as it is, there isn't any wifi. This means that Thursday's update will be pushed forward to tomorrow, and Saturday's will be pushed back to Sunday. Next week will return to normal :)
He hasn't taken over my mind! Is that why you hit me on the head earlier? Steve said that was how Clint was snapped out of it.
P.S. Have you seen Harry lately? I’m hearing rumours the King of the Dicks hasn’t been seen round the office for a while.
I'm sorry I let Osbourne get away...I guess you were right about me not having what it takes to make an Avenger...
The Media really can't accept that we just have different opinions on this issue can they? I kept my name because it is part of me, and you know, everything I make is branded with it. I'm not spending millions changing everything to Rogers Enterprises. Sorry darling :P
I guess it would make sense that he was after Harry, after all we were in his house, however the guy did make a grab for me first which is weird....Maybe he just figured I'd be weaker and he could use me as a hostage to get Harry or something...
The whole thing is ridiculous. I mean, the whole premise is ludicrous- she looks sincere and therefore can't be sincere? She's a woman and therefore it must be because she hasn't had babies? It's a joke, Nattie, really. People won't take it seriously.
...No, only kidding. But from the next chapter we will be jumping forward in time by several months, but more on that next time. Merry Christmas everyone!
I did have to sell the mansion though, which is why I'm not with you right now. I've got to move all our stuff out. Don't worry though, I've already bought us a new place. I think you'll like it, it is on a quiet suburban street down in Queens, it even has a white picket fence for goodness sake!
What was my answer to what? I just told them I wasn't there to discuss my personal life and asked them not to distract from the issues. The write up should be in the papers tomorrow, could be interesting.
America has voted- and it has said that it is high time that those with superhuman abilities were forced to make their powers known to the government.
Call me when you're done playing God- and when you're sober. Maybe we can work out a way to stop this turning into a blood bath.
What's more, it seems that several weeks before the difficulties reached a climax, Rogers changed his name via deed poll and is now, legally, known as Steven Stark. Some are now suggesting that this escape was motivated by his desire to return to his wife. It is understood that the police are now attempting to locate and contact Ms Stark for routine questioning.
I'm eating and sleeping fine! Have you been talking to Jarvis? He is filling your space of making a big deal out of nothing when it comes to my health.
Anyway, isn't it the job of heroes to protect people? If there really was that big of a war, would it really hurt to send a few heroes to take out the major threats? I mean that is why you became Captain America in the first place...
I backed off because I didn’t want to hurt you, but side with Loki again and I may not have a choice. Don’t put me in that position. Spiderman should be with the Avengers, not against.
Well, at least you made a friend. Just be careful she's not another fan in disguise. Or, in fact, a super villain in disguise, because it's not like this is even going to stay in your school. Pretty soon everyone is going to know that Spiderman is out in Florida, miles away from anyone that could actually help if someone was gunning for her, which, you know, is soooooooo unlikely now the world knows you are a) Spiderman and b) one of the richest heiresses in the world. So things are strained with May right now? Is that because by taking you away she's basically painted a huge target on your back and isolated you from any support? Because that's why I'm pissed at her.
