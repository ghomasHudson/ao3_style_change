Cas didn’t know how much longer he would be able to take. The eternal darkness that surrounded him never seemed to end. He was sure he had been walking for days now. No idea if he was heading in the right direction, or just aimlessly walking around in circles.
“By you not being an angel anymore” Jack interrupted, his voice hushed, like he was afraid he had spoken out of turn. Cas’s eyes fell to the floor as his gaze darkened, he didn’t speak, only nodded in agreement. He was grieving a part of himself, just as much as Dean had grieved him. Only that part of himself was truly gone, he was going to be human for the rest of his now numbered days.
“I would love that Dean,” Cas muttered into his boyfriend’s ear, “I-” he hesitated, before snuffing out his butterflies and jumping all in, “I love you.”
Before that one grounding moment, Castiel's life went by in flashes. His purpose throughout all creation seemed simple. He was an angel of the lord, he followed and gave orders without question, trusting the authority of his superiors as every other angel did. Yet, he never quite fit in. He had spent many millennia carrying out the missions assigned to him, rarely finding time to spend in leisure. Continuous work was actually considered essential to his role as a soldier.
Jack nodded slowly, his gaze drifting back down to where Cas had been standing. “I wasn’t supposed to come back. The Empty didn’t want me to come back,” a chill went down the nephilim’s spine as he thought of the horrible entity. The cold chill reminded him of the darkness that had enveloped him for months in the Empty. All of the months he had spent standing in place, unsure of what to do, and waiting for Billie to come back for him. He never wanted to go back, but now….
Cas found Dean lying on the ground in front of the Impala, bloody and in tremendous amounts of pain. Not all of it entirely physical. He had just watched his brother throw himself into the Cage in order to put an stop to Lucifer.
“Thank you, that won’t be a problem, Mrs. Sanabria. We will take this at whatever pace she wants to set.” Cas replies as they both stand to follow her to Maria’s room.
“And if you can’t?” Dean asks, leaning closer into the angel’s space. The hand on his cheek is warm and grounding. He craves more of it.
Dean would deny anyone who said his knees nearly buckled. The other man's voice was as smooth as honey.
After Becky left, Chuck took the Dean figurine and placed him further down the tree. The real Cas and Dean of this world had become virtually inseparable. Still, that didn’t mean that every version of them had to be. In fact, maybe this world was slowly slipping away from his grasp, but Chuck still had the power to fuck with these small figurines. Perhaps that is why, after Becky left him to his own devices with the tree, Chuck decided to enact his revenge. Before he went to bed that Christmas Eve, he whispered a single incantation towards the tree.
And then Dean moved. The soft love and longing quickly turned into pure lust with that first thrust. All of their poetic thoughts thrown out the window and replaced by a grueling need to just get impossibly closer. A guttural need for Dean to feel every inch of Cas inside him. A need for Cas to do everything in his power to worship Dean. The sound of skin hitting skin flooded the entire room as Dean bounced harder and harder on top of Cas, the angel gripping his hips tightly. He pushed up into every one of Dean’s thrusts, relishing the moans he managed to rip out of his lover’s throat. He catalogued every whimper, moan and scream and committed them to memory, for future reference.
” This time they all heard it. A heart-shattering plea for help from what sounded like a frightened little girl. They were close. Dean and Sam turned off their lights, in order to get a better grip on their knives. Using the light from the angel’s flashlight they walked in front of Jack and Cas, trying to locate the exact origin of the plea. Suddenly, Jack stopped moving and pointed his flashlight directly in front of him. He stood frozen as he stared at what was on the other end. There was a small child, trembling on the cave floor, holding up a hand to shield her eyes from Jack’s light. Sam quickly stowed his weapon away and rushed to the little girl’s side. He tried his best to soothe her. It was hard to make out her features in the dark, but judging by her clothes and the missing posters with her picture, Sam confirmed that they had found Ella, one of the last kids to be taken. Even from where he was standing, Jack could see the brand on the girl’s shoulder. Two bloody circles and a line cutting through them. They had finally found
"Of course you have a place here Cas! You have us! Unless... that's not what you want." Sam's voice got lower as he spoke, almost afraid of the answer.
directed at him before. Not like this. Dean moves without thinking and finds himself slowly inching closer to Cas. His gaze roams from impossibly blue eyes to reddened lips. A warmth brewed inside him making him want to get closer to the angel. Almost as if he was magnetic. He is interrupted by one of the couple’s children standing and moving away from the family table while his parents weren’t looking.
A tense silence overcomes the room. Edgar cuts through the silence as he clears his throat and shifts towards his computer. “The batteries are for the nanny cam that was installed inside. The bear belonged to the third victim. His parents set up a couple of them around their house to keep an eye on the kids.” He pulled up a video and turned the laptop to face the hunters.
mean Dean?” He was looking at a poster on the store’s window next to the register. The poster had a picture of a smiling child, and the all too familiar text describing their features. Dean’s stomach dropped.
The angel met Dean’s gaze once more, seemingly transfixed by what he found there. His gaze seemed puzzled, yet intrigued. He also had a total disregard of the limits of Dean’s personal space. Dean shifted from one leg to another under the angel’s intense gaze.
By the end of the meeting they got up and as Jimmy shook Dean's hand he had to hold back a gasp at how soft his hands were. But not too soft and WHAT THE HELL WINCHESTER. WAKE UP. You are thinking about a man's hands? That's a bit too far. Dean managed to mutter a goodbye and watched as Jimmy left out the door.
Cas came up behind them holding their picnic blanket and some of the snacks they had bought. He was currently wrestling against the wind to try and flatten their blanket out over the grass. Dean doubled over laughing at the sight.
“Because I saw you sleeping on top of Cas this morning.” Dean nearly crashes after jerking the wheel violently at Jack’s words. A warm blush spread rapidly from his cheeks to his neck.
He shook his head to clear his thoughts. He was half unconscious and apparently delirious, but as he watched the night sky from the ceiling to floor window that covered one of his bedroom walls, he caught a small glimpse of a shooting star. Half gone as he was, he noticed that the star seemed to be falling instead of flying but he wished anyway. He wished that something would change. He had always heard "be careful what you wish for" but he was willing to take his chances. He thought about his mother's words to him as a child. So he closed his eyes and wished to his falling star: "Find me my angel" and he drifted off to a profound sleep
Before Dean could open the door to their room, Sam stopped him. “Maybe we should all meet up in my room and talk about… you know.” Sam questioned, and one glance at Jack told him he wasn’t the only one thinking it.
, Castiel thought, but something within him recoiled at the idea of lying to Dean. With one last look to ensure that they were as alone as they could get, Castiel spoke.
Maria stops drawing to reach for the red crayon. She colors the tip of the object bright red, as well as on the left side of her chest. She stares at Cas for a while, before moving her shirt to show him the mark that the woman had left on her. Two circles with a line crossing them, just like the other victim. Maria drops the crayons and hugs her knees to her chest once more.
Gabriel, seemingly unaware of the other angel's inner struggle, took the lollipop he was eating out of his mouth long enough to say: ''Love" The word confused Castiel, he wasn't sure what the angel meant by that. Gabriel sighed almost annoyed at having to explain it so thoroughly. "Love is yr mission little bro. You gotta get your little trench-coated wings and work as a cupid. They are a bit short on staff and well the big man thinks you would be a great fit. You see, cupids can be a bit too lenient sometimes and not really achieved their goals in the more troublesome cases. That's where you and your new angel mojo come in, help the cupids with some cases and then you are home-free."
Jack smiled knowingly, “He was also knocked out. We are not entirely sure what happened, do you remember anything?” the nephilim asked, as he pointed to where Sam was watching Dean intently, trying to jostle him awake.
The rest of their day went by rather uneventfully. The family of four decided to stay home and binge watch a couple of movies they had wanted to see for a while. Which is how they had ended up in Dean’s man cave, with blankets and pillows thrown across the floor and chairs. Sam had sprawled himself across one of the recliners, while Jack had made himself a decent nest on the floor with 2 blankets and 3 pillows. That left Dean and Cas sharing a blanket on the small couch they had dragged into the man cave once they all started staying together.
She leads them both to the back room. There are two other detectives talking hurriedly to each other. It’s all Spanish, and Dean can’t follow a thing they are saying. There’s a huge board in front of them with pictures of the missing kids and the locations they were last seen. Their conversation comes to a halt once Dean and Jack walked into the room.
Cas was about to ask what was wrong when Jack beat him to it, “you need to go see Dean,” he explained as he led him through the labyrinth of the bunker’s hallways and made straight for Dean’s room.
“Are you getting anything from angel radio?” Dean whispered as he neared Cas, trying to keep the noises they made to a minimum. Considering they were dealing with a vengeful spirit, they wanted to try and maintain some form of the element of surprise.
She charged at Dean with fiery anger in her eyes, her white dress glimmering as it became soaked in her strange blood. The hunter met her halfway and stabbed her straight through the heart. He held and slightly twisted the knife, just to make sure she was truly dead. In her last moments, she stared directly into Dean’s eyes and whispered strange words with a grin.
“Heh, you could hope to loosen up a little bit kid.” Dean chuckled as he gave him a pat on his tensed shoulders. Jack sighed and chuckled slightly at the feeling, as if he was finally aware of how stressed he was.
The angel rolled his eyes again and burrowed further into his side of the bed. “We have a long day ahead, sleeping on the couch won’t do you any good and you don’t have keys to Sam’s room. It's just sleep, Dean.”
Dean and Cas were bickering over who got to carry what out of the car. Sam simply rolled his eyes and started looking for a spot in the grass that they could claim as their own. He patted Jack on the shoulder and led him down the green slope, towards a patch of grass near the middle that was far enough away from the rest of the families. Jack had never seen the ocean so close before. The ancient walls of the Spanish fort had slowly eroded away and created a makeshift horizon that separated the sky from the sea. The boy could smell the sea salt in the air, and he took a deep breath. He hoped that it would stay in his lungs forever.
Her slightly raised eyebrow reminded him of Missouri. God, he missed her like crazy. He was past due for a visit. Perhaps they’d visit her for their next vacation. He scoffed at that thought. Their first vacation ain't over yet, and here he is planning another.
His room was like a mirror image of himself. It was ransacked from his last rage-fueled destruction spree, littered with broken glass and toppled furniture he had not bothered to clean up.  A single, shattered piece of glass lay close to his left foot. Absentmindedly, he reached out to touch it with his toes and brought it closer to him. It had a jagged edge from where it had shattered from the rest of the glass it came from. He placed his foot over that edge and eased down into it. There was an initial, sharp burn from where it cut his skin, but Dean didn’t flinch. That burn seemed no different than the pointless rage that had burned inside him for the past 13 days. He kicked the shard aside forcefully, not bothering to check where it landed. He let his head hang and slumped his shoulders, as if gravity could do the favor of getting him out of bed for him.
It was easier not to care. His toothpaste had run out three days ago, but he didn’t bother replacing it. His last shower had been 2 days ago, and he hadn’t bothered to wash or brush his hair since
The entity stared at him for what felt like eons. There was an intense hatred burning in its eyes, yet there was something else there too. It almost seemed like it wanted to take him up on his offer. The air between them was tense, Cas could practically feel It thinking. The entity rolled its eyes and set Cas back down on the floor.
Dean’s cheeks reddened. “Family vacation actually,” he muttered while rubbing his hand across the back of his neck.
He smiled fondly and reached for the hunter’s hand underneath the table and gave it a gentle squeeze. Dean glanced at the angel again and took the opportunity to place his arm around Cas’s shoulders. He relished the warm, fuzzy feeling it gave him in his heart.
Cas had always been intrigued by the Human Heavens, and just humanity in general. However, the thought to 'hug' a human being had never even crossed his mind. Not until Sam. It felt like the right thing to do, though he would later be told it was just awkward, much like the rest of his attempts at humanity.
“You-” Dean started, his voice rough and hesitant, as Cas turned to face him again, “You’re grounded now? No more wings or power-ups?” He couldn’t meet Cas’s gaze, his eyes seemingly fixed to the floor.
And for the first time ever, Dean understands. This moment wasn’t what Fate had dealt them so many years ago, this moment had been carved by their years of fighting. Cas and him, they had brought themselves here and now they had the rest of their lives to figure it out. Yet, as Cas settled on top of him on the bed and kissed him like he was a deity to be worshipped, they both had the same thought.
“No.” The moment the word left the hunter’s mouth, Dean could see the fear and doubt come into Castiel’s eyes.
“Wow, the temperature dropped a solid 5 degrees!” Sam exclaimed, turning his phone towards his brother’s face.
To this day, that has been Castiel's easiest order to follow. He knew that was the moment he had begun to see Dean in a whole new light. It was a while before he could say the same for Sam, but he did have some fond recollections from that earlier time.
“You’re right, this shit didn’t used to bother me so much before…” Dean’s gaze fell on their son, sleeping soundly on the bed next to them. Cas followed his gaze and nodded in understanding.
Dean stared dumbfounded at the sight before him for a few precious minutes before springing to action. He didn’t know what had gone wrong, but he did know one thing: Castiel was in trouble. That was enough to spur him into action. He rushed down the tree haphazardly towards the fallen angel and tried hopelessly to stay out of sight from the other ornaments. He wasn’t quite sure why he didn’t ask for help. Surely, Castiel would need it. But Dean also assumed that whatever had just happened could send their entire world order toppling over. The angel at the top was never supposed to
Dean smiled as they came to a stop in front of Ronny’s, taking one of the few parking spots left near the entrance. The hunter turned in his boyfriend’s warm embrace and wrapped his arms around him in turn. Tears made his vision blurry as he buried his face in the crook of Cas’s neck before placing a small kiss to the skin he found there.
Jack’s brow furrowed at the strange question from his dad. Dean had never been much of a talker when it came to how he felt. Jack figured he should be proud that he seemed to be making an effort.
They were standing less than a foot apart, their distance a mere formality. Dean could have done a couple things at that moment; he could have moved away, or tried another joke to alleviate the rising tension. Yet, for the first time in a long time, he found that he really did not want to. His heart ached to just take the final leap and cross that unknown horizon. It was dangerous. If he crossed that abyss, there may be no coming back. Then again, John hadn't raised a quitter.
“Look, Jack, we don’t always control what we do when we are asleep. Some people sleepwalk, but I, well I guess I huddle for warmth.” His voice trails off into a petulant grumble near the end of his sentence. The hunter does try to remain serious, but a small grin manages to push through his facade. Even he has to admit that sleeping next to Cas was the best sleep he’s had in years.
Sam and Jack tried to approach him slowly, like one would approach a wild tiger. Dean simply slid closer to the floor, resting his forehead on that damned black stain. “Get out,” he muttered, almost too low for the others to hear.
"Woah, okay I'm guessing Garth had you in another party last night?" She, however, did not wait for an answer as she kept talking, excited about the news she had to bring Dean. "Whatever, so yeah okay Dean. Do you remember that weird guy Lucifer that owned basically a private stadium for car races??"
They come to a stop in front of a small wooden fishing shack. It’s a small one-room store, filled with freshly caught fish. It’s right in front of the coast, where people tended to buy their food and enjoy it with their feet in the sand. Dean discovered this place the first day they arrived and had been longing to come back. He removes the keys from the ignition and gets out of the car. His friend follows.
Jack turns to smile at his father. “I rather like it, it feels like we are driving in a trampoline.”
“I'm sure Dean is going to be happy to see me Jack, but there’s surely no need to act like the building is on fire” Cas tried to joke, but he hesitated when he saw the pained expression on his son’s face.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He didn’t need to see the signature on the card to know it was Cas. He cried that night, but hadn’t taken it off since.
She grabs hold of another paper that Sam provides and keeps drawing. The picture she draws now is different. She can hear a voice, like music coming from deeper in the cave. She got closer to it and saw… a woman? The drawing looks vaguely like a woman, which she draws wearing all white. The girl draws what looks like tears in the woman’s face. The sound is coming from her, but now Cas isn’t sure if the sound was music or crying. The woman gets closer to Maria. She’s holding something in her left hand, something long and sharp.
“We should get out of here Dean” Cas whispers in the hunter’s ear, moving to place his hand on the small of the hunter’s back. “We are starting to arouse suspicion.” Shivers ran down Dean’s spine, and his hand clenched to keep himself from just reaching out for the angel. He should be focusing on the case, but there’s just something about Cas…
Zachariah had warned him, he had gone on and on about the intensity of the Righteous man's soul, but his mere words fell short of the actually experience. Castiel was frozen in place, completely enraptured by the soul's power, which emanated so strongly around him, even under all the years of torture it had endured.
“Cas, look! This one has bees!” Before the boy had finished his sentence, Cas was already hovering next to him, eager to catch a glimpse of his long-lost friends. The bees were frolicking from one petal to the next, shaking off the pollen they had picked up along the way. They seemed utterly unbothered by the presence of humans, perfectly content in their own little paradise.
Dean and Sam both still believe he did not hear them that night. While he might have been immensely inebriated, his grace was still present in the room, he could still hear the murmurs and whispers of what Dean fondly calls 'angel radio', as well as his favorite brothers talking over his comatose body.
The cave was dark, barely any light made it through the waterfall. It was nearly impossible to see more than a few yards ahead of themselves. However, the soft scratches and wing flaps that resonated through the rock walls let them know that they weren’t alone. Jack turned on his flashlight and aimed it towards the deeper end of the cave, which startled a small nest of bats. They flew away, going over their heads to hide in another nook somewhere behind them. With the flashlight on, they could see the moisture accumulating on the cave walls, which made the entire space feel damp and sticky.
An uncomfortable silence permeated the Impala, only the soft purr of the engine remained. Until it didn’t. Dean looked up and saw they had finally gotten back to the bunker. He cleared his throat and practically jumped out of the car the moment they stopped. “Uh, thanks for helping me get the food, Jack. Let’s go in before the pizza gets cold.”
. It kind of reminded him of the smell of the pies his mother used to heat up for him. His stomach growled, demanding his attention. He got out of the car and made his way out to his room. As he rummaged through his pocket to get his room key out, the door opened in front of him. He was greeted by blue eyes, and frazzled, dark hair on a familiar trench coat-clad frame.
Once they changed back to their regular clothes, Sam and Jack stayed behind in their hotel room to look into the lore and try to figure out who they were dealing with. Dean and Cas made their way out to their car and sat there with the keys in the ignition unsure of where to go.
Cas follows the hunter’s gaze and hums in agreement. “We should keep an eye on them, the rest of the children in this parlor are not the right age.”
. It's an old Spanish fort in San Juan. By the looks of it, you can go fly kites and have picnics there.”
His train of thought is interrupted by the lively old lady behind the counter. She is wearing round black-rimmed glasses and has soft chestnut hair that is lightly plastered to her head due to sweat. He read some great reviews online about this bakery. Looking around, he can sense there’s a home-like vibe to the place. There are pictures of beaches and smiling children plastered all over the walls. There are different sized pictures in all kinds of colored frames, some with other loose photographs haphazardly placed on top of them. The bakery has dark wooden floors and paneling, giving the entire place a warm and cozy feel. Some pictures right next to the register even have the lady behind the counter in them, and Dean figures this bakery must be family-run. He smiles, the troubles of the parking lot forgotten in favor of charming this sweet, old woman in front of him.
The restaurant is themed with pictures of beaches, palm trees, and tropical birds. Each table is laminated with pictures and quotes from Puerto Rican writers. Cas runs his hand under the quote that is on their table, a small smile on his face. “
“Oh, but you would my dear,” the entity inexplicably managed to smile without a mouth and it sent a shiver down Cas’s spine, “you are an angel, and one day you will die again, permanently, and where do you think you’ll go?”
The ride from their hotel to Old San Juan was like taking a scenic ride on the surface of the moon. There were so many potholes in the road that a part of Dean felt like he was a cowboy from one of his beloved westerns. One look at Sam’s face while he was sitting in the passenger seat told him he wasn’t the only one that felt that way. The way he held himself against the car’s ceiling was almost comical. Dean tried his best to keep the car steady, but for the life of him, he could not fathom how locals drove on these roads every day.
“Get something that at least has some vegetables on it please.” the long-haired hunter begged as he started to pick up the playing cards they had left thrown across the table.
Against the odds, against God’s will, they had found a way towards each other again. That kiss, evidence of their profound bond made metaphysical, was the final piece in the puzzle. Unbeknownst to them, Chuck had issued them a challenge which they had braved and overcome; just as they had done before in the real world. With one kiss, they undid Chuck’s curse and returned all the ornaments back to their original, plaster-filled, unanimated selves.
After their brief stint in the forest, they had driven back into town and dropped the children off at the central police station. They had managed to convince the officers that they had managed to track the children down to that specific cave “on a hunch.” The boys weren’t sure if the cops bought the story because they were convincing enough, or if the cops were just desperate enough to bring the children home. None of that mattered. What mattered was the fact that the children were standing in the station now, being hugged by their loved ones because they had saved them.
“May I help you?” the angel asked as he reached for a towel and started drying the dishes. Dean stared at him dumbfounded, but shrugged it off and went back to his dishes. They worked in silence for a while, only the sound of clinking dishes between them.
“How was your ride?” Cas asked as he relieved Dean of the pastry box and coffee and moved towards the small table in the back of the room. Dean’s eyes wandered slightly towards the tidy beds, the fresh clothes set out on the bed for him, and grinned. Cas was a lot like Lucy sometimes.
Edgar and Carlos share a strange look. “No, nothing like that. Hell, we really are grasping at straws here. We don’t have DNA, fingerprints or anything.” Edgar responds eventually.
Castiel tilted his head in confusion and opened his mouth to speak before Balthazar continued once again. "Here is your mission. You find him, charm him and make the connection." He handed Castiel an envelope. " Open it when I leave or I'll get curious and steal it." He winked at Castiel which made him finally speak up.
Dean’s brow furrowed at his brother’s hurried response but shrugged and closed the room’s door. He couldn’t see his brother walking back to his room. But if he had, he would have seen him fist pump into the air silently, looking exactly like a man that had won a $50 bet with their adoptive mother Jody.
“Jesus, that’s bad. Did they find anything weird at the scene or on the bodies?” Dean said with a grimace.
“What the hell Sammy? It’s barely morning.” Dean gruffs out, annoyance practically pouring from his tone.
“In 400 meters turn right.” the screeching voice of the GPS cut through the car’s silence. It felt like a sign if Dean had ever seen one. For the first time in his life, he did as the universe told him to do, and turned right. They all stared in wonder as the hot asphalt road turned into gravel paths that ground against the wheels. A canopy of giant trees slowly enveloped the sky above them until their bright sunny day turned cloudy and full of fog. Cas lowered his car window and felt the fresh breeze hit his face.
There are sparks, lights, fireworks and every other cheesy thing that Dean could ever associate with a kiss like this. But most importantly, there is Cas. They were new to this, new to the world and new to this life. Yet, they felt ancient with each other. They had known this kiss for eons and its name would linger on their tongues until the end of time itself.
That was what he, wasn’t he? He was a problem to the Empty. He was a problem to Heaven and Hell. There was only one place in the universe Cas didn’t feel like an issue in. Unsurprisingly, that place seemed to be Winchester-shaped. He would always choose them because they were the first to have ever truly chosen him back. The hope that blossomed in his chest was dangerous, but he needed to succeed. He needed to go back, there was still so much he wanted to do.
Jack stood quickly and made his way around the table to hug his father ,“Goodnight Cas, see you in the morning”. He then turned to Dean and -to the hunter’s surprise- he hugged him as well.
It was dark, he could see nothing around him yet he felt as if he was.. Rising. It was with a slow dreaded feeling that he realized he was dying. He was rising to heaven, his regretably new home. A rush of panic flooded through him, his mind filling with the same thoughts: "I'm not ready yet... It's not my time... I'm not ready..."
“It is nice to see him enjoying himself,” Cas muttered as he stared at their son, smiling as Jack struggled to keep his grip on the kite against the strength of the wind. The kid snapped his fingers and the string became firmly attached to the plastic holder, which made it easier to fly. Jack grinned, pleased with himself. Sometimes it paid off to have some power-ups.
After precisely 6 minutes and 47 seconds, Dean came out of the bathroom covered only by a towel around his waist, and water droplets that dripped slowly down his chest. He came out to find a sight that made all the blood in his body rush immediately south. There on their shared bed, Cas laid entirely naked, his body completely on display for Dean to see. The hunter’s gaze roamed slowly down the angel’s form, from his tousled black hair to his gorgeous blue eyes with pupils blown wide, down the side of his neck, his broad shoulders, the tanned skin of his toned chest, and further down to his navel that Dean could practically taste. An intense hunger glowed in Dean’s eyes and for a brief moment, Dean realized the angel had stolen his breath away for the second time that night.
Today, as he had many times before, Castiel found himself patrolling through the corridors, wishing with all his grace to take a glimpse inside the mysterious and alluring doors.
He was surprised at his new voice, it sounded much deeper than his old one. For a moment he contemplated he actually might be slightly attractive now. It must have shown on his face because the man in front of him handed him a mirror which Castiel had not seen on him before. He took in the sight in the mirror with a very audible gasp. Castiel had never been a vain man, but when he looked in the mirror at his new body he couldnt help the shock. He had dark hair messed up in a seemingly perfect mess, his jawline strong, a bit of stubble dusting his face his lips a pale pink. However, the most impressive feature was his eyes. His eyes were two shining orbs of a heavenly sky blue and for a couple moments  he didnt care he was basically composing poetry about them in his head. Reluctantly he set the mirror down. Facing the man once again.
Sam is about to agree when Jack intervenes. “Actually, maybe you should stay out and find another place with children. You stopped it once, but maybe it still wants to try again.”
How could Dean forget? Just the name sent an unwanted shiver down his spine. "yeah" he said trying to control the disgust in his voice.
This new idea being shut down, angels continued to murmur, no one else daring to speak up. Tension was thick in the room. If no one stood up as volunteer soon, then the mission would be randomly assigned, as was customary. Castiel could hear the whispers in his head, as angels begged and prodded at their fellow brothers and sisters to do something. Castiel stared ahead, directly at the dark image of Hell. Something in his grace stirred alive, a feeling akin to interest. Something inside him screamed, silencing all the the other voices and making itself known. He knew what he had to do. It felt right.
It was as he stood there, within his favorite Human Heaven, watching the waving of the autistic man's kite on a sunny Thursday afternoon, that Cas realized just how much he needed to sacrifice in order to save his family. Dean and Sam were everything that he needed to protect, vessels that could mean the end or the safety of the entire universe. No, more than that - they were his brothers in arms. His leaders in the endless fight for the safety and protection of his one true love: Humanity.
He still remembers the feeling of Dean’s lips against his own. The small, electrifying touch that made all of his synapses fire at once. An implosion of warmth and love that he had never felt before, and could do little against. It wasn’t like he wanted to resist anyway. He remembers giving as good as he got. The feeling of Dean’s hitched breaths against his vessel’s skin as they parted. Heaven could rarely grant him such peace, even during the good days.
Once they are in their own room, Dean and Cas make their way towards their beds. They sit opposite each other in complete silence. The day had been a long and confusing one. Dean was worrying over the blade his brother had handed him, moving it back and forth between his hands. “We don’t have to do this Cas,” Dean grumbled out.
With a sigh, Dean uncaps the glass bottle they had found in Sam’s room and sets it next to his feet. He makes sure that it is within easy reach of his friend’s soon to be injured arm. He places the knife across Cas’s forearm and hesitates. He lets his eyes roam towards his friend’s face and meets his eyes. A silent question, permission, brewing behind his gaze. The angel nods and takes a deep breath as Dean pushes the blade against his skin. He curses and reaches quickly for the bottle to avoid making too much of a mess. He supposes they should have done this over a sink, not on his bed. He wishes they didn’t have to bleed Cas. He hated causing his friend pain. Yet, he knew they had a case to solve.
He goes over to his notebook to scratch Djinn off the list. They need a new lead. He decides to try and find his phone and check if Cas and Dean made it back. They hadn’t reported in yet which was strange for them. As he is walking past the television, something on the screen catches his eye.
“Yes…” Cas adds hesitantly. “I did enjoy kite flying in my favorite Heaven. I can’t believe you remember that Dean.” Cas adds breathlessly and smiles softly at the hunter. Dean can’t meet his eyes, a warm blush spreading through his face.
That was all the permission Cas needed. He sucked the head of the hunter’s cock tightly into his mouth and moaned as he tasted him properly for the first time. Dean grabbed tightly onto the hair near the base of the angel’s neck as a single moan escaped him. The angel’s mouth was wet and warm as he worked him, and Dean knew that this had to be what heaven felt like. Or at the very least, what heaven should feel like. He felt the warmth of his whole body start to pool at his gut, a familiar kind of electricity starting to build. Cas was moaning as he bobbed his head on Dean’s cock in earnest, taking his own cock in hand and stroking it to match his rhythm.
He remembers thinking about it, while he waited for Dean on that cold, dark road. As the hours passed, wondering if something had maybe gone wrong. He can recall the nagging itch that went down to his very core, that insistent itch that made him suspect Dean wasn't safe.
Jack held on to his passenger side door, temporarily moving his attention to the road before turning back to his now very flustered father. “You looked very peaceful.” the boy adds.
“Don’t worry yourself too much kid, we already survived the trip to the pizza place.” Dean pointed at the warm stack of pies that sat in the backseat, forcing both hunters to take in their tantalizing smell.
Cas and Dean watched as Sam and Jack disappeared towards their respective rooms, a tense silence blooming between them. They were alone now. Sure, they had been alone in the car, but somehow this felt different. It felt almost intimate, sitting next to each other at the war room table, only the low grumble of the bunker’s air conditioning between them.
At the angel’s words, Dean was instantly reminded of that moment nearly seven years ago when he had asked a very similar question to a previously brainwashed Cas.
Dean decided to pull into a gas station that Google Maps recommended as the closest stop. “Alright kid, come with me.” He started walking towards the door. “Cas, are you coming? Sammy can fill up the car.”
“Night Dean,” Jack said sweetly, which made Dean smile and hug his son back before his teary-eyed gaze could give him away. He cleared his throat and gave Jack a pat on the back “Night, kid,” he answered.
He gestured to the brothers and silently asked them to follow him. The angel used his grace to sense further down their path, trying to pinpoint the source of the cry.
As if Dean could ever forget any of the times he had lost his son. He wanted to voice that thought, but he couldn't bring himself to. He needed to let Jack talk now; he needed to know what happened to Cas. “Yeah, we brought you back thanks to Lily’s soul magic”  So, he kept it at that.
Castiel looked down and played with the buttons of his trench-coat as he listened. he had never been an expert in this particular area, but by 'the big man' Castiel assumed Gabriel meant, well God. He had never been a fierce believer but he couldn't possibly be wrong... Working with cupids, how hard could it be? He needed to learn how to love eventually.. he shook his head to clear the memories he could feel rising to the surface.
Cas turned to look at the hunter. Dean was staring off into the distance in Jack’s vague direction. His green eyes shining slightly as the light reflected against them, but his expression was guarded. For a moment, Cas seems to notice the hunter’s freckles for what seems to be the very first time. Or at least the first time in a very long time. They flutter across the bridge of his nose and cheeks, which only makes his features more prominent.
“...You. I was staring at you.” A sudden silence came over them, Dean stunned at the angel’s blunt admission. His cheeks began to warm and he couldn’t meet Castiel’s gaze.
The room went silent. Cas and Sam looked eagerly towards Dean who had been effectively stunned. The only time he had let the kid drive was when he was dying. All of them knew this, and it was why the following words came as a shock even to Dean.
“Sanabria. My name is Crystal Sanabria.” She extends a hand towards them and they shake it. “Can I get you anything?”
As they parted, Cas tried to turn towards Dean and pull him into a hug too. His arms reached up, but were solidly batted away by the green-eyed hunter, disbelief and grief fighting over his features. He took slightly limped steps back into his room, his head shaking. “Stay away from me,” he muttered, “I don’t know what the hell you are, but you are not… you can’t be him. You need to go away”.
Time worked differently in the Empty, he had no way of knowing how long he had been gone on Earth. It could be seconds, days, months, years or eons. So, Cas did the only thing he could to keep himself sane. He thought about that night. Replayed it entirely in his head, using his grace to make sure time in his memory passed just as it had on Earth. It wasn’t perfect, but it allowed him to at least grasp the passage of hours among the dark, bleeding walls of nothing that surrounded him. The mere thought of Jack’s laughter, Dean’s smile or Sam’s brotherly teasing was enough to keep him sane. Enough for now.
Sam’s frown deepened, and he placed the bowl on the left nightstand next to the bed. He turned to sit next to his brother when he noticed a stain of what seemed like…
“Hell no, we are not sharing. This ain’t summer camp.” Dean shifted nervously from one foot to another.
“Others? How long has this been going on?” Cas interrogated as he came up to join them at the register.
“Uh, well maybe? It depends on how you feel about the person I guess… why the hell are you asking?” Dean counters, confused.
Sam hums. “Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. Those are the ‘Cuevas de Arenales’ they are normally a tourist spot, but there’s some areas that have been closed off for safety reasons.”
“Morning, sunshine.” Dean chuckled. There was something funny about having an angel welcome him home like an
“I appreciate the concern Sam, but I assure you I am fine.” he gave the hunter’s hand a gentle squeeze before removing it from his shoulder. He walked towards the bunker’s bedrooms, leaving a befuddled hunter in his wake.
we were kinda in the middle of something” he took his eyes off the road briefly to try and meet the former angel’s eyes before turning away again as he tried to fight the nerves that were growing within him. A quick glance towards the passenger seat confirmed Cas was still listening and had now turned to fully face the hunter.
However, the day his father's last hunt had gone South, Dean and Sam both swore off hunting for good. It had consumed their childhood, it would not take their lives too. They still trained and kept themselves in shape, Sam went off to Stanford like he had so wanted. Dean, on the other hand, always prefered a more adrenaline infused line of work, which is why he became one of the most famous NASCAR drivers at only the age of 20.
So he decided to do something he had never dared to do before. He decided to take some time for himself. He walked out towards the longest branch near his spot on the tree and sat with his legs dangling over the edge. He took a deep breath and reminisced on the brief life he had led. He looked out towards the rest of the living room and took in the small changes he could see had been made over the past year. A new recliner, a couple empty beer bottles on a table and a wastebasket full of crumpled pages which was fuller than usual. There had to be more to this life.
When they finally broke apart for some much needed air, their foreheads remained pressed together as they struggled to catch their breath. A small chuckle erupted from the hunter’s chest as a curious thought came to his mind.
“It was freaking incredible, actually.” Dean smiled to himself as he leaned against the table with his arms crossed in front of his chest. Cas turned to look at him, personal space apparently forgotten. “I went down by the beach again. There’s nothing like smelling the ocean first thing in the morning.” Dean’s eyes made their way up from Cas’s lips to his ocean blue eyes. They stayed there for what seemed like years.
“Oh, SPARE ME” the entity screamed, its voice crackling like static in Cas’s ears. “I don’t care about that, I care about getting rid of you so I can enjoy my peaceful sleep,” It added as It began to rise from the throne, coming to stand right in front of the angel.
He turned to face Sam nervously, but he just found the faces of his very accepting brother and son looking back at him. His nerves subsided and he relaxed back into his seat as he ruffled the former angel’s hair. “Yeah, Cas, that is still the term buddy,” he answered with a chuckle that practically screamed
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cas wasn’t certain how much time had passed since he collapsed in front of the entity. He was laying on an uneven surface, trying to open his heavy-lidded eyes. He slowly propped himself up to a seated position and tried to force some sensation back to his weary face. Once he managed to open his eyes, all he saw was darkness. A cold shiver of fear ran through him as he realized the entity must have thrown him into the depths of the Empty again. His heart hammered in his chest as tears streamed down his face.
A smell that was currently overwhelming, enveloping the air around him. That was enough to snap Cas out of his thoughts and realize his daydream had resulted in said hunter hurling a t-shirt at his face. He smiled to himself, it seemed like their own kind of an inside joke. Cas held the shirt against his chest and looked at Dean questioningly.
Cas moves to stand and kneels in front of the hunter, his left hand reaching out to hold Dean’s again. The touch seems to soothe the hunter, the tension in his shoulders melting away. “We need to save the children, Dean. This sacrifice is worth it.” The angel’s voice is firm, leaving no room for argument. He moves to sit next to his friend, pulling his shirt sleeves slightly higher. He extends his arm out for Dean to reach and waits.
''You can live wherever you like, do whatever you like and meet whoever you like but you must never reveal yourself as an angel.You cannot use your powers in public, no flying, the whole she-bang. Got it?'
Jack’s head tilted slightly to the right in a way that was extremely reminiscent of his father. “Misses what, Dean?”
He looked around himself once more. Trees seemed greener, grass softer under him, leaves flowed slower in the wind which rasped an amazing chill down his spine. He was alive. He was given his second chance. As he stood to bask in the mid-morning sun, a figure appeared in front of him as if from thin air, he had heard a strange ruffle before almost like the sound a bird makes when it lands.
“Okay, well Cas and I are in the car now. We can meet you back at the hotel and figure this shit out?” Dean asks.
Cas met the hunter’s eyes and shook his head. “The quote that is decorating our table, I feel that it is very fitting.”
This chapter begins with some suicide ideation and self-harm in the first part of the chapter. Continue after the first break if you want to skip that.
As he stood in the endless abyss, he hoped (not for the first time) that everything would be right again someday; that he would return to that embrace he so desperately longed for. For now, all he could do was fight.
"That's great Charlie but is that why you called?" Dean quickly cut in, he didn't want to think about his relief at knowing he would never see that horrible man again. The scumbag deserved to be behind bars...
They had tried sleeping apart, but halfway through the night, Cas couldn’t take it anymore. He had not left his heart on his sleeve just for Dean to turn around and try to pretend nothing happened. So, the angel stood up and made his bed hastily, resolute on sleeping in the hunter’s bed. When he reached Dean’s bed, he hesitated. What if he didn’t want him? What if Dean turned him away? Just as Cas was about to turn back, he heard the rustling of bedsheets below him. Dean smiled and raised the bedsheets, inviting the angel in. “What did I tell you about acting like a creep in the dark?” Cas chuckled and bent to join the hunter under the covers. He took in the warmth that suddenly enveloped him, and the comforting smell that was unequivocally
“You are so dumb sometimes, Winchester,” Cas added with a smile. Dean let out a short laugh, with a smile that reached his eyes. Then the angel leaned in to whisper in the hunter’s ear “You have exactly 7 minutes to shower before I go pull you out of there myself.” His words punctuated by a small slap to Dean’s ass which made the hunter gasp. He nodded profusely before practically running towards the bathroom.
As he neared the familiar, concrete structure that marked the entrance to his home, Cas hesitated. He wasn’t sure how much time he had spent in the Empty, and a part of him feared that maybe it had been too long. The closer he got to the threshold of his home, the more he feared he might find there was nothing left for him there.
Dean runs his hand through his hair. “Okay, so creepy crying woman that lives in a cave and is obsessed with Matilda. Sounds peachy.”
“I know”, he replies “it's against the rules.” Cas reaches for Dean’s hand and meets his eyes, effectively pinning him down with his intense gaze. “But, what if we broke those rules?”
The hunter leads them closer to the coast. Families and couples are laying in the sand, basking in the warm sun and waiting for the sunset. The waves are crashing on the shore, slowly dragging the bits of sand away. Erasing the evidence that it was ever there to begin with. Suddenly, Dean turns away from the shore and starts heading towards some trees. Confused, Cas follows the hunter, ever loyal to the human. They come up to the thick bushes and trees, and Cas expects the hunter to stop, but he doesn’t.
“I typically don’t enjoy food as I used to when I was human,” his foot stilled, and he forced himself to meet the hunter’s eyes. He wanted to watch his reaction, and needed to know that he wasn’t delusional. “Yet, sharing a slice of pizza tonight with you… it felt like a revelation.”
The overwhelming relief and joy he felt at seeing the familiar, crescent moon above him was nearly indescribable. He had done it, he really had done it. He placed his hands more firmly on the ground and used them to push himself up to stand. He stood there for a moment, taking everything in as if it was the first time he set foot on Earth. The cold, night breeze nipped at his trench-coat covered skin, a little more presently than usual. As he breathed, he could see his breath puff out in front of him from the cold.
“You got...distracted. Alright, what was so distracting?” Dean probed. He wasn’t sure what answer he was expecting, but it certainly wasn’t the words that came out of Castiel’s mouth.
“Well, yeah three times by my count. That I know of at least. Why?” Sam sits down on the bed facing his son.
Dean’s thought processes stopped the moment he felt Cas’s arms wrap around his waist as he pressed a kiss to his cheek. The former angel had shifted to sit right next to Dean, thighs almost touching, which made Dean bless the Impala’s booth-style seats even more than usual.
Cas’s gaze fell to his feet, which were half-covered by slithering, black goo. The Empty was right. No matter what he did, he would always end up here. Much like Lucifer had promised Dean all those years ago. Everything would always lead him here. Unless…
“Why would this place serve such dangerous soft serve?” The angel questions, his voice deep and conspiratory.
Dean considers in awe. The realization leaving him a little breathless. The hunter hears the soft shuffle of the angel moving towards him. The strong footsteps come to a halt behind him and Dean turns to face the angel. The blade forgotten in the sink.
They dressed as quickly as they could. Both stealing the occasional glance in the other’s direction. As they grabbed their keys and gear, Dean hesitated by the door with his hand still on the handle. He turned to look at Cas, his mouth open like he was about to say something, but the words never came. He shook his head and headed down the hall towards breakfast with their son and his brother, who had an incredible habit of prying into his business. There were words left unsaid, but they could wait for the opportune moment.
“What the hell has blood of pure devotion?” Dean asks, exasperation making his voice slightly louder. “Why can’t these lore books say stuff like normal people do?”
Yet, that is exactly what he did. As kept going deeper into the dark realm, he felt his grace start to burn within him. It wasn't a painful burn, more like it was sensing something around him, something powerful. The more his grace burned, the easier it was to fight off that creatures that came to him like moths attracted to light.
Except Jack. The boy stared at the mess on the floor, muttered a soft “Oh no” as his eyes widened in fear.
“Cas” the hunter muttered breathlessly before he leaned in to steal a chaste kiss. The moment their lips touched, they became a black hole at the center of the universe. There was only them, and for a brief moment no other sound or feeling existed outside of them. They were everything and nothing at the same time.
“Here,” Dean said as he held the slice between them, “I’ll even take a bite out of it too, as an act of solidarity.” His brow wiggled suggestively in his most ridiculous attempt to make the angel try the pizza.
Small crinkles creased next to the angel’s eyes as he smiled at the hunter. “I suppose that I could consider writing as a retirement plan.”
Suddenly, the images behind Zachariah changed, revealing a terrifying darkness that could only be one place: Hell. Castiel took a moment to consider the little he knew about Dean Winchester. Hunter, detrimentally loyal, willing to sacrifice everything, which made Castiel wonder just how much was considered sacrificing everything. Though, staring at the image of Hell, the angel felt he already had an idea of exactly what Dean had sacrificed. Zachariah only confirmed his suspicions as he spoke.
Castiel had known none of his new abilities would come without a price, however he didn't expect it to be so soon. He wondered what would he be tasked. He realized he knew very little about angels even though he studied them throughout his whole life. As a museum curator he was always especially interested in angelic exhibits without really knowing why. The cherub paintings and halos were nothing like what stood before him. Gabriel was a normal-looking man, a vessel, his mind supplied. His golden eyes and apparently permanent smirk gave him an almost sinister look, nothing like what he imagined the servants of God to be.
Dean nods and sifts through the boxes. Mostly there were clothes and other things that belonged to the kids. Nothing was necessarily screaming supernatural.
“Well, yes. You see she goes by different names depending on the country she inhabits. Here in Puerto Rico, she’s ‘
“You may be onto something here, feathers” the entity spoke with his voice, yet something seemed off about it, slightly sinister, “if you were human, you would have no claim on this realm of mine. Hmm”.
“Sure, we can stop by the store before leaving for the airport” the hunter murmured, trying to keep his voice steady. He sat up in his bed, stretching his arms above his head. He turned to set his feet on the ground, taking in the cold hardwood. His nightshirt stuck slightly to his chest, possibly from all of his tossing and turning the night before. He glanced briefly at the clock, 6:15 am it read. They were still a little early, but he decided to call his brother’s room anyways. Cas wasn’t exactly a morning person, so it would take them some time to get ready. He grabbed the phone on the nightstand next to his bed and waited. Six, seven, eight rings later there was still no answer.
Cas meets the hunter’s eyes briefly before trailing slowly down his body. Taking him in for the last time. His gaze stays fixed towards the ground between them. The silence between them is charged, making the tension almost palpable. “I thought I made myself clear months ago in that barn when I thought I was dying.” His voice is barely above a murmur.
Thank you to the DCBB mods for arranging such a wonderful event for 10 years! It is truly a great feat.
The one thing, in all of his time as the angel of the tree, the only thing he ever wished for was to be able to hear Dean’s voice. It was the one thing he could not appreciate from his perch. He dreamed about it, tried to guess what Dean would sound like as he said his name. What he would sound like as he laughed. There had been one year, where he considered asking his angel friend Hannah to bring Dean to him so that they could meet. Yet, he stopped himself. Castiel might think Dean the worthiest being in the universe, but the hierarchy of their tree was simple. Middle ornaments could not mingle with upper ornaments nor lower ones. Everybody has their place in the tree and nothing can go against that. Not even the angel at the top.
“We should go over our plan for today. I want to make sure I get it right.” Jack asks sheepishly, almost as if he was ashamed of having to ask.
He took Cas into his mouth and couldn’t help but moan at the taste. Cas didn’t taste like a human. He tasted like the air right before it rains, like the electricity in a thunderstorm, like a million waves crashing on the nearby sand. Dean couldn’t get enough of it. He bobbed his head up and down, encouraged by the angel’s small moans and whimpers. Cas’s head was thrown back on the pillow, just enjoying the sensations. Just as Dean was starting to gather a good rhythm, Cas’s hips buckled underneath him and pushed his cock a little further down his throat. Dean choked a bit, but even as he pulled back, he felt a shot of electricity run down his spine.
with him.” Sam adds, breathless at the angel’s confession. He keeps an eye on his brother’s reaction, expecting an overcompensating explosion of toxic masculinity. Yet, there was nothing? Dean’s eyes widened and moved down to stare at their hands clasped together. His heartbeat rising steadily, causing a small hum to go through his ears.
Castiel stared at him for a few moments longer before looking away with a mumbled “No.” He looked up towards the tree, its height imposing from their current vantage point. “I need to get back.”
Castiel seemed startled by the sudden interruption of their silence and he hesitated. Looking around, he couldn’t see any other ornaments hanging around them. He leaned against the wall and a nearby branch before sighing in defeat. He knew that he had to satitatie Dean’s curiosity if he wanted his help getting back.
Jack turned to face the hunter with a toothy smile. “It’s just so much sweeter than the coffee we get at the bunker. Can we take some of this home?” His voice squeaked, and it was details like that which made Sam forget he was talking to anything other than an innocent child. Just a child, not an angel that killed his… A small, sharp pain struck his heart at the thought. It was best not to think of her at times like this.
Dean’s gaze dropped to the floor, the stark reminder of everything Cas had lost suddenly forcing its way to the forefront of his mind. “I'm sorry you had to give that up Cas,” he whispered earnestly.
“Why have you been acting weird around me lately?” Even as he asks, Dean can’t quite meet his friend’s eyes.
“Wait, wait, wait. I need a minute here. I mean, Cas, I’m glad that you finally said it. I’ve known for years, but YOU!” Sam points at Dean now, righteous fury in his eyes. “Cas finally mans up and admits his feelings and you just say ‘okay’?”
"To be able to convince Dean to say Yes, we must first get to him. Thanks to an incredibly stupid year-long deal this man made with Lilith – a groupie demon or so our intel suggests – Dean is now serving a sentence in Hell. He has currently endured what we calculate is about 38-40 years in his human time."
He scanned his surroundings looking for a sign as to why he was here. Gabriel had said he was a Cupid, was his first "mission" inside this bar? Gabriel had said he would help deal with the more.. Troublesome cases. A bar seemed like as good place as any to find cold hearts that were content to just be alone forever. He should know since he was one of them.
Since he was young he spent his nights hopping from bed to bed, never staying till the sunrise, just in and out. Quite literally, though even when the chance had presented itself numerous times, he had never been with a guy. Well not sex-wise at least, but common rushed hand jobs and makeout sessions in wrestling camp hardly count.
“Cas, we can’t-” Dean starts, but the words fall flat in the space between them. He knows there are reasons why they shouldn’t, but somehow none of them come to mind.
“Think of it as unwrapping a present, I certainly am,” Cas smirked as he bit slightly harder against the hunter’s neck, eliciting a surprised moan from Dean. The hunter’s hands found their way under Cas’s thighs and used the leverage to prop the former angel up onto the kitchen counter, earning a hungry look from Cas as he linked his ankles behind Dean’s back and brought the hunter’s body closer to him.
“YOU SHOULD NOT BE HERE” the entity snapped as it expanded, tripled its size, and loomed over the angel.
about you. Something wrong”, the entity swung its arms out dramatically, looking every bit like a Dorian Gray dipped in tar.
The moment Dean entered the club he knew he was in for a long night. Garth had apparently rented the entire place out just for them and their associates. And as Dean maneuvered through the drunken crowd he was beginning to feel more upbeat again. The music was loud, lights were flashing and everyone was dancing just a bit too close. After the 4th shot he was ecstatic.
A single ray of sunlight peered through the window, landing on Dean’s face. He stirred and a small grumble erupted from his chest. He felt warm. Perhaps a little too warm. Weird, he didn’t remember the bed being this soft…. He certainly didn’t remember the bed
“It’s been like two weeks I think, but he has been acting strange since he found out about the deal,” Jack replied as he came to a stop in front of the hunter’s closed door. He looked at Cas, his eyes twinkling with a familiar warmth he reserved for his father, and knocked softly. “Dean?” the boy asked hesitantly, he had learned his lesson against barging in ever since that night they stayed at the Western-themed motel.
“So, Cas, what are you gonna eat?” Sam asked him over his menu. He was confused by the question, but right as he was about to answer, he felt it. A strong rumbling in his stomach that made him feel hollow and weak.
“Yes, but they turned up with strange markings on their chests. Two circles with a line cutting through them.” Sam showed him the drawing he had made on a piece of paper.
” Cas says in a gentle voice that surprises Sam. He prompts Sam to flash his badge. The woman hesitates before she nods and steps aside to welcome them inside.
As Castiel looked at his sister, attentive and charming as she always was, he made a mental note to make it up to her some time soon. Turning his attention back to Zachariah and his seemingly endless speech, he let the words run over him, trying his very best to actually pay attention.
"Why don't we just kill them both?" Balthazar, a long time friend of Castiel, suggested. It made sense he would make this suggestion, he was known for being a good, yet carefree fighter. Many angels held some respect for him. For this reason, some angels nodded in agreement, with murmurs being heard around the room.
. This memory was a subtle ache that intensified with every step he tried to take. Once Jack had lost his grace, his body had decayed slowly too. It had gone from a mild ache to an incurable illness that not even Rowena could stop. Losing Jack to something he had no control over, that felt like drowning. The more he struggled to rise, the deeper he sank.
Dean and Sam continued to writhe in pain next to him. Cas ached to be able to help them and frantically searched for a way to stop her. In a second, the angel knew he had to find a way to stop the source of the water, just like he had done before. The river flowed into the cavern from an opening on the far right side. He scanned the floor around him, looking for anything that might help him. He found a solution that weighed approximately 234 lbs: a small, stone boulder. As the angel made his way towards the rock, the spirit followed his movements and started shrieking louder. She raised one of her hands and quickly dropped it to her side, which caused a large stalagmite to fall from the ceiling a few inches away from the angel. Cas evaded the sudden rainstorm of rocks she sent in his direction by zig-zagging across the cavern floor. Quickly, he picked up the stone with ease and used it to block the river’s flow. The water slowly stopped trickling down the cavernous space, and the screeching stopped.
In the background, visual aides had been raised to help with the mission assignments. Even though that in itself was standard procedure, what Castiel found odd was the images they had chosen. There were two pictures of two human males. They seemed ordinary enough, and Castiel did not understand how they could possibly be as important as Zachariah stated.
“No! I am taking back the children that were taken from me.” She screamed before lowering her grating voice to barely a whisper.
how Chuck had designed the story to go. Those were not the actions of an angel under his control. An angel with its own mission could prove to be his downfall one day if he wasn’t careful. Chuck knew this. This world had gone rogue and nearly slipped past his fingertips. He was no longer its sole writer.
“Look, um how about you go get yourself whatever you want and we can get this show on the road.” Dean slides money across the table and the angel retrieves it. For a second his face lights up like a child on Christmas morning. Dean watched as his friend walked to the countertop, and cheerfully ordered for what seemed to be both of them. He took a moment to scan the rest of the tables, no one seemed to be acting suspiciously. A couple with two small children joined the table next to them.
That was all it took. With just those words, Cas knew he had gained so much more than a friend. So much more than a life and a family. He had always had brothers and sisters, but now he knew, he had a home.
"Yes, you heard me. Sam and Dean Winchester are from now on to be considered one of Heaven's assets. Why? Well, my fellow brothers and sisters, here behind me lie the pictures of the true vessels for our friendly archangel brothers: Michael and Lucifer."
They all made their way through the small store, grabbing snacks and drinks for the road. Dean went straight for the cheap beer, and Cas was thoughtfully regarding some honey-flavored candy in the back. Jack followed Dean around the store like a small puppy, grabbing all the nougat candy bars he could find.
The angel ignored him and pushed aside some branches that were obstructing the path ahead of them. The branches parted to reveal a glimmering waterfall that fell into a tranquil river that flowed further into the forest. There were some lizards sunbathing on the rocks near the shore, keeping a wary eye on the birds that flew above them.
She wipes the small tears away using her sleeve. She takes the crayons from the angel and starts to draw on a piece of paper in front of her. After a while, the shapes and colors start to take shape. She is by water, but then she isn’t. She wakes up in a dark, wet place alone save for the toy she tried to save from the water. Everything around her is rough, mossy stone and water.
Sam was always a little more distant than Dean. Ironically, the demon-blood addict had been the one with the most faith in the angels and Heaven. In what they stood for, what they fought so hard for. From the very beginning, Sam showed faith in his power, in his mission. Yet, it almost felt like he had a hard time believing in Cas as an individual, instead of as an aspect of a more abstract concept of Heaven. Still, Sam was grateful for Cas saving his brother from Hell, a debt Sam felt he would never be able to repay.
Sam roared with amusement as he won yet another round. Jack tried to comfort Dean who had yet again been bested by his damn political nerd of a brother.  However, there was only so much fun a hunter could take before the hunger striked.
Cas kissed back with every bit of ferocity that he had stored within himself for all the years that he had been in existence. Dean couldn’t help but smile into their kiss, his hands roaming across the former angel’s back, moving downwards slowly, but deliberately. The uncut tension radiated from both of them, fueled by the soft whimpers that Cas was letting out as Dean bit his lip softly.
Just as Dean was about to ask him about it, there was a knock at the door. Cas got up to answer it, and let Sam and Jack walk inside with a small nod. Sam had a warm, post-workout glow, and Jack was still rubbing the sleep from his eyes. Dean smiled and waved at both of them. Sam nodded at both of them and made his way to the table, following the delicious smell.
Dean never told him about his time over there. He didn't need to. As soon as Dean reappeared in front of him, Castiel saw everything he would ever need to right there in that cold and dark street, Dean's soul reading just like an open book.
Then everything went dark, like the moment your eyes adjust to the darkness of your room when you go to bed, but when opened his eyes once more everything shone and sparkled and intensified. He looked around, he seemed to be on Earth but it was brighter, clearer. He tried to adjust his glasses out of habit and realized he didnt have any. Confused he looked down to himself but found something entirely different. Instead of his lanky, pale self he was now shorter, sporting a more fit figure, his hands slightly calloused but not like a farm worker's hands, just proof enough of having worked. Proof of a life actually lived, unlike his old hands which were smooth only slightly chapped from flipping through pages of books for too long.
There was nothing like the warm purr of the Impala’s engine to soothe Dean’s lingering nerves of letting their son drive. The kid looked like he had a stick up his ass as he held onto the wheel with a vice grip.
“I am sure it’s hilarious.” Castiel deadpanned. “Come and help me already.” The angel tried to sound spiteful, but everyone could see the slightly upturned smile he tried to hide. Sam was staring at his brother in disbelief. He hadn’t seen Dean act this happy in a really long time. He hadn’t seen his brother laugh in years. Sam decided to leave them to their devices and grabbed the red bundle that was sitting next to their bags.
“My name is Malinche.” The ghost’s voice was grating to their ears, almost like nails scratching a blackboard. She turned to face Cas, who was slowly trying to make his way towards the children. “Get away from my children.” She hissed, her eyes filled with seething rage.
Dean placed a hand on Cas’s shoulder, which made the angel’s gaze flick immediately to him. “Cas, buddy, this is not some ordinary pizza. It’s from Ronny’s! You can’t say no to Ronny’s.” he pleaded, his smooth voice enveloping Cas as he spoke. Dean grabbed the last slice from the box and slowly pushed it towards the angel’s mouth. There was a warmth behind the hunter’s gaze that Cas had still not gotten used to after all these years.
Sam and Jack didn’t move, so he tried again. “GET OUT” he howled, his voice breaking into a sob. The hunter and nephilim flinched, but granted Dean’s wish. They slowly padded out of the bunker’s kitchen, grief evident on their features.
?” He added with a smirk. Sam snickered and moved past them towards the water. Dean rolled his eyes and tried to pretend he didn’t hear the angel sass him, but the warmth in his cheeks betrayed him.
“The ones that Cortez took from me.” Her voice broke as soon as she uttered Cortez’s name, as if the mere mention of the Spanish conquistador’s name brought her back to her living days. “These children may not be
. It didn’t make sense. He wasn’t all that great to look at up close, even less from all the way at the top. Did Cas have some strange hyper vision powers that he didn’t know about?
Dean’s gaze drops to the floor, before slowly rising up to meet Cas’s eyes once again, a small grin on his face. “Well, what can I say Sammy? Cas and I have been over this already. You’re the one who needs to catch up.” he adds a wink for good measure. Cas returns his gaze, looking at the hunter like he had hung the moon for him.
When Dean reached the very bottom of the tree he noticed that the branches surrounding him were empty.  He hesitated as he stood on the last branch. He had never left their tree before. The distance between the branch and the floor was barely more than his height, yet it daunted him like a cliff to the abyss. In the distance, he could see Castiel’s rumpled form on the ground who seemed to be laying eerily still. A chill of fear ran down Dean’s spine and without a second thought he jumped down towards the floor and made his way to the fallen angel.
“Alright, look it's not... That wasn’t what it looked like.” Dean sputters, trying to keep his eyes on the road.
“We’re pretty much under the tree. You, uh, fell?” Dean answered hesitantly, terrified that he might anger Castiel.
"What's your name, bro?" the man had materialized a lolipop and was now enjoying as if nothing was strange about this conversation. Castiel hesitated but spoke: "My.. My name is Castiel"
Angels believe in order. They were the force against chaos in the world. It would be 'unseemly' for one of his kind to be caught fraternizing with the human souls, unless strictly necessary.
The boy nodded at her, and made his way to what Dean presumed was the kitchen, disappearing completely from his view.
The days  had not been kind to Dean. As he lay tangled in his bedsheets, looking up at the ceiling of his room in the bunker, he felt numb. Cas was gone. He had been for the past 13 days. A cruel part inside of him, the part that still had hope, was keeping track of the days as if they mattered. The rest of himself knew the truth; Cas was never coming back.
“Maybe I could join you?” the angel asked, his voice rough with obvious arousal, but still with a hint of hesitation. The suggestion made Dean’s thoughts stop in their tracks. His mouth was suddenly suspiciously dry, and the warmth he had felt in his heart was starting to spread… elsewhere. There were about a million words he would have loved to say in that moment, but the first one that came out of his mouth was certainly the last one he thought he would say.
He smiled at his memories of his mother, always so fond in his heart. John had not taken her death lightly, consuming his time by hunting and teaching him and Sam how to hunt. Whether it be rabbits or demons, he could kill them all.
“What if I wasn’t an angel?” Cas questioned, his voice drenched with renowned hope, “if I wasn’t an angel, I would go somewhere else for sure”. He had no delusions that Heaven would take him, but anything beat having to come to this empty wasteland.
“So, um do you have large coffees?” He tried using his hands to mime a huge cup. He really needed the caffeine boost.
Dean grabbed Cas’ hand and made their way to Sam and Jack’s door. They knocked and waited for an answer.. Cas had once had the ability to fly, yet he had never felt as free as he did in this moment. Jack answered the door and looked down at his father's clasped hands. A bright grin lit up his entire face and he jumped to hug both of them.
That last thought clears his head entirely of sleep and his eyes open like a deer stuck in headlights. His eyes meet a familiar chin and lips. His gaze trails over the rest of Cas’s sleeping face which is currently a little too close for comfort. The ‘warm bed’ turns out to be none other than the angel’s chest. Just as Dean is about to panic, the aforementioned angel starts to rouse. Hooded, blue eyes meet frantic green ones.
Deep down Dean knew he had a good point. They were about to embark on a hunt in a place far from their usual playing field. He needed to make sure he was well-rested. Reluctantly, he reached for the bedside lamp. After he turned off the light, he made his way slowly closer towards the bed and pulled away the covers to slide in next to the angel. As close as he could manage without actually touching him. He felt Cas laugh next to him.
The hotel room is quiet. It has been a while since Sam heard anyone pass by their room. The television is on at a low volume since Jack claims it helps him sleep. The hunter glances at the room’s digital clock: 2:35 am. Sam is currently burning the midnight oil trying to find anything in the lore that could lead them to the monster they have been looking for. He stands and paces around the room to stretch his legs and go over what they already know.
Dean used the hair was holding onto to get Cas to stop. The angel pulled off his dick with an obscene ‘pop’, his lips shining and slightly red with exertion. The hunter looked down at his lover who was flushed red, panting slightly and looking up at him with that same adorable head tilt he always did. Dean felt his heart clench with the pure love and adoration he had for this gorgeous man sent from heaven. A lame pick-up line flashed through his head briefly, but he quickly dismissed it to focus on much more important matters: Cas’s cock. He pushed the angel back onto the bed, and let him settle in the middle of it. The hunter then straddled Cas’s legs, leaving his head close to the angel’s dick. He was practically salivating as he grabbed it with his left hand before mirroring Cas’s teasing lick from base to tip. He smirked at the angel’s slight indignation as he realized what he was doing.
Dean was jarred from his thoughts by Sam again, this time his ton eof voice was bit more serious. ''A co-worker of mine died this morning, i just got the email. A car accident.... Are you racing today?''
. You are very brave.” Cas’s eyes soften as he fights to keep the tears at bay. He can feel the girl’s fear and pain as clear as a prayer. It smothers the entire room. He turns to face her mother. “We will find whoever did this, I promise.”
For one brief moment, Dean finally understood what true happiness felt like. As he stood holding his angel in his arms, feeling his warmth radiating against his body, he doubted there could ever be anything better than this feeling. That kiss, their first, had felt like a missing puzzle piece finally clicking into place. Like those 10+ years of waiting had been worth it. They had paused for a moment, Dean’s arms around Cas, simply staring into each other’s eyes.
Gabriel nodded while he ate the candy bar he had materialized. "You didn't think this angel mojo was for free right?'' He said around a mouthful of candy.
“Well, now that Chuck is gone we can finally get back to basics.” Sam proposed as he placed one hand on the angel’s shoulder. Sam’s warm smile faltered when he felt Cas’s tense shoulders. “Are you sure nothing else is bothering you Cas?” Sam asked through a worried frown.
Sam looked between them with a pained smile. He hadn’t seen Dean act this chipper in a couple months. Not since… Well, one glance at Cas let him know that he wasn’t the only one that could see the change in Dean.
Dean saw the words on the angel’s arm and quickly pulled up his own sleeve. There was an identical set of words underneath his skin. Their eyes met, and silence fell over them. Sam was the first to break it. “Uh, Cas any idea of what that means?” He asked pointing at the words.
Dean calls to check in with Cas and Sam. They agree to meet at a diner close to their hotel to compare case notes. A quick Google Maps check lets him know that they are only 20 minutes out.
“I don’t think he misses Heaven... I think he found something worth staying on Earth for. He made his home,” Jack assured him, his voice soothing enough that he hoped his father would get his message.
The former angel had taken off his trenchcoat earlier, complaining that it was too warm. Which meant that he was walking around with a partially unbuttoned, white, dress shirt that was a size too small for him, and black slacks to match. Neither left any room for Dean’s imagination, and soon the sight of his boyfriend walking in front of him had him blushing like a teenager at the prom.
Dean grinned at him, giving him a pointed look towards his stomach, “By the sound of it, Cas is gonna need a trucker’s breakfast!”
The strange angel winked at Castiel one last time before leaving with a sashay of hips with both a woman and a man in his arms.
Before Dean could pose his theory, Jack interjected: “Dean’s love for Cas, and Cas’s blood on the blade broke it.” The hunters all turned to look at their son then, surprised by his intuition. “She tried to cast the bonding spell to finish building her army, but Dean and Cas’s devotion to each other got in the way and turned it into a romantic bond instead.”
There was really nothing left for him now. Sure, there was Sam and Jack, but they could take care of each other. Bobby, Charlie, Rowena, Jo, Ellen, Mary, John and now
Sam is thrown by the question. He was expecting the typical teenager stuff. Hell, he even thought maybe Jack wanted to know what being queer was. But this?
to know. Within a few more steps, he found himself at the doorstep he never thought he would see again. Against his better judgement, he knocked. There was no answer, and a panicked fear went through him, settling loudly in his heart. He reached up and knocked again, hard enough to make the metal door rattle. The next few seconds were filled with slowly mounting dread, the blood rushing in his ears and a heavy pit settling in his stomach. The former angel rested his forehead against the cool metal, fighting the tears that threatened to spill out of him.
The angel hesitated, unsure which question his son was truly asking and which he preferred to answer. Did he like staring into a certain hunter’s earth-green eyes as they shared warm food in the comfort of their home? Of course. Did he even bother to pay attention to said food? No, not really.
“Did you have problems with the shower?” Jack asked, his brow furrowed. Sam gave a side-glance in Dean’s direction, trying to keep his composure. He had wanted to pretend he didn’t notice the strangely familiar bed head his brother was sporting when they walked in. Yet, the hand-holding had also given them away.
Hey guys! sorry i dont update regularly but i promise im trying. Work is difficult to deal with. Anyway, enjoy!
“Oh, well then yes, of course he is,” Jack answered with unwavering conviction that made Dean almost believe it. They remained quiet for a while as the hunter mulled over Jack’s response.
“Okay, maybe you’re right. I should get some rest. My vision is getting blurry.” The boy grabs his bag from under the bed and gets his pajamas out. They’re the fluffy cowboy pajamas that Dean picked out for him. He smiles. “But first, I have a question!”
"We will find a way Dean, but I believe Sam would appreciate it if you were around to see it." The angel said as he took the hunter's drink away from him. He had tried to stop him, Dean had been acting like this for weeks, but he refused to listen to reason. Grief was a powerful paralyzer.
He arrived at Charlie's office a little after 5pm. It was a nice building in town with lots of 'nerd stuff' as decoration in the lobby. He smiled and thought how much this was fitting for Charlie. He arrived at the door to Charlie's office after being led by a very hot young woman. When Charlie came to greet him he raised his brow at how Charlie looked at the woman. She blushed and muttered something about 'a new assistant from upstairs.'
“I just wanted to know that I wasn't the only one that could see it. I think they could make each other very happy.” Jack’s eyes were hopeful, and with a snap of his fingers, he changed into his pajamas.
Cas’s brow furrowed, his head tilting as he tried to recall the moment Jack had woken him up in the Empty for the first time. Jack had used his power to pull at his connection with him until he had removed him from this black goo and forced him towards the surface. Maybe that was how he could get out of this fluid prison. All he had to figure out was how. The walls called to him again, and he dared to step closer. He was less than a foot away from the nearest one, and he placed his hands delicately on the surface again. His grace seemed to react to the goo, repelling it. Or was the goo repelling his grace?
He has been down this road before. The potholes and small fishing shacks seem familiar as they roll into view. He’s found himself driving down by the coast every morning, drawn by the sheer energy he found there. There was something liberating about being able to feel the thrum of the engine on his fingertips while listening to waves crash below. It was addicting. It was time to go home though. He didn’t want Sammy to kill him for taking too long getting breakfast. With one look in the rear-view mirror, he turned on his blinker and made a U-turn back into town. He sped down the road and glanced at the green road sign as it flew by. “
Sam sputters, looking between them until he finally sighs in defeat. He rubs his temple, already sensing a headache forming. “Uh, okay. Okay. Fine, we can deal with this later. Let’s get the gear ready, and we can go hit her lair in Luquillo tomorrow?” Sam proposes.
“Okay, Cas,” Dean whispered, still holding on to the angel’s hand. Sam stares wide-eyed, moving back and forth between his brother and his friend.
"Let me finish Cas. Look, you pulled me out of Hell, you saved Sammy from the Cage. You have died for us countless times and truth is, we need you." Dean stepped closer to Cas, trying to catch his gaze, just like he had done now close to a year ago in that horrible room in Heaven.
Still, Cas could clearly remember looking over at his forlorn friend and deciding then and there that he would not allow the hunter to grieve forever. In theory, Castiel could have pulled Sam from Hell immediately but something in his very core knew it wouldn’t work. Not completely, not right now. Something told him to wait. To find the right spell, the right way. After months of research, he found it.
“You sure have gotten into the local coffee.” Sam chuckled, slightly startling the nephilim who had not noticed the hunter had woken up.
The bunker door shut loudly behind them, startling Cas as he bent to pick up a card that had fallen under the war room table. Sam noticed the angel flinch with some amusement “Still not used to being home?” he asked.
Cas stood his ground, trying to meet the entity’s absent gaze with an impassive one of his own. “I have to agree with you there,” the angel replied.
As the angel was about to pull out, Dean grasped his lover’s shoulder and composed himself enough to whisper: “Castiel, you stop only when you cum. You got that?” Cas’s heart raced and thumped wildly against his chest as he nodded, and he barely managed a grunt before he started fucking into Dean in earnest once more. With every thrust, Cas could hear the hunter’s breath hitch next to his ear, making a shiver run down his spine. It didn’t take long before the angel pushed deeply into Dean as he came, a sighed moan escaping his lips. They sat there for what felt like ages. Content to lie in each other’s warmth, a tangled mess of limbs on the sheets.
Even now, as he was being worshipped at the altar of his literary representation of the Winchester's lives, everything around him felt hollow. Chuck only ever craved one thing: control. That had disappeared the day that Castiel, angel of the lord, waltzed into his living room and uttered the words “We are making it up as we go.” That was
Jimmy Novak was all tan and muscle. Not too tall by surely strong with disheveled dark hair, black as night, and his eyes. Piercing,blue eyes that Dean felt could see right through him. Dean realized Jimmy was talking so he gulped and tried to listen.
“Well,” Dean clears his throat and turns on the ignition. “Let’s go gank a bitch and eat some ice cream.”
Leaning back into the booth with a nonchalant expression, the stranger began: "My name is Balthazar love. It's nice to see you at last. Heard all sorts of talk about you, Castiel."
“Yeah well, uh no biggie.” Dean stands quickly, rubbing the back of his neck. He seems to need some distance between himself and Cas suddenly. Sam rolls his eyes and chuckles.
Sam grabbed the gun he kept under his pillow and stuffed it into his sweatpants. “Gonna check on Dean” he manages to grumble as he stumbles out of their room, trying not to panic. What if something went horribly wrong last night? He shouldn’t have left them alone to gather the blood. Especially not after Cas’s confession. He wants to send a small prayer that Dean has not done anything stupid, but stops himself. No one is truly listening anymore.
Dean looked into the blue eyes and saw a glimmer of something there. Something that helped him push through his next words.
Sam is about to question why he hadn’t answered the phone, since they had agreed to leave by 6:30 am at the latest. However, he stops when he sees a figure turn slightly in Dean’s bed. A masculine figure, with black tousled hair and stubble: Cas. Sam glanced at the other bed in the room and noticed it was still made. It took all of Sam’s willpower to suppress his grin as he answered his brother.
He was interrupted from his thoughts by a new set of double doors appearing seemingly out of thin air. They were big, tall brown wooden doors and Gabriel was inviting him through them. As he stepped through he was greeted by the warm sunlight and breeze hitting his face. He felt a hint of nostalgia ghost around in the back of his mind but he pushed it away he was still alive, just in a different way. He looked around, they seemed to be in a park of some kind, right in the middle of the sandbox. The trees looked nice and green and the force of the truth hit him once more. He was alive.
They parked at the far end, which left them closer to the beaten dirt path they would take up to the waterfalls. Jack practically jumped from his seat, eager to get closer to the flowers that could be seen growing on the side of the road. “These are all so amazing!” The boy whispered as he drew nearer to the flowers in question. They were beautiful, typical yellow Heliconias that were drenched in the morning dew. The grooves between the flower’s petals served as water basins for bees, which inevitably drew Jack’s attention.
Cas rolled his eyes and shifted to the left under the sheets. He left enough room for Dean to lay down next to him and gestured for the hunter to join him.
Dean turned to his boyfriend and held out his hand as an invitation for him to join him on the food run. It was a simple gesture, yet it still made butterflies settle in Cas’s chest at the thought of spending some time alone with the hunter. Cas smiled and took his hand and refused to let go until they had made their way to the Impala waiting in the garage.
“Were the kids in the water when they vanished?” Jack asks, turning his attention towards the boxes of evidence on the other side of the room.
Two symbols that Cas would later recognize as the Enochian word for “Us.” But for that brief moment, Cas and Dean shared a single breath, a single body, and a single mind. The symbols somehow a tribute to their profound bond.
Castiel memorised both images, searching to find a resemblance between the two brothers, as was typical with humans, yet he found none. It made a strange feeling blossom inside him, one that he usually reserved for those white doors he was always so tempted by: Curiosity. Before he could get too lost in thought, Zachariah continued.
Castiel had always been aware of his preference. He had never acted upon it in life and was therefore out of touch with his "romantic" side. However, now he somehow walked on the side of the road aimlessly holding on to the picture of a man he found to be gorgeous and an envelope telling him exactly who he had to make sure the man ended up with. He sighed and put the picture back and closed the envelope. He knew it would not be easy to do this but it was well worth coming back to life for.
.” Dean adds around air quotes, unsure if he was saying the word correctly. “I have it on good authority that they are really good.” Dean gestured to the white box that Jack was eyeing curiously.
The angel had no time to sigh in relief, since the moment his feet touched the floor a searing pain burned from the tip of his wings to the base of his spine. Cas howled in pain as he felt like he was burning from the inside out. Darkness faded into the edges of his vision, the pain making him teeter closer towards unconsciousness. Through the flashes of pain and his incoherent screaming, Cas heard two words that settled like balms in his heart.
A tentative knock against his door startled him from his thoughts. He turned silently to face it, waiting to hear who was on the other side. A dangerous part of him, that one that held out hope, wished it was a certain miraculously resurrected angel.
The loud clanging of the bunker doors alerted Sam and Cas that the food had arrived, along with the rest of their makeshift family. Sam put down the book he had picked up and helped his brother carry the pizzas to the war room table. Dean looked around and noticed Cas didn’t seem to be around.
"Excuse me, I was told I was to help being a Cupid. Why do I have to charm someone? Don't cupid's have arrows and such for that?"
Cas opened the bottle and poured some of the lube on his fingers, rubbing them against each other to warm the sticky liquid. Dean rose up to straddle the angel’s hips and bent down to kiss him again. This time the kiss was deeper, hungrier. As they kissed, Cas reached down to Dean’s ass and started to spread him open. The hunter flinched at the first finger, surprised at the sudden intrusion. Cas started rubbing slow circles on his lover’s back to soothe him. Their kiss went from hungry to soothing, their mouths just close enough to each other to bring comfort. Sharing the same breath. Their skin burned everywhere that they touched, a strong warmth coursing through their veins. They stayed that way until Cas managed to go all the way up to three fingers, Dean starting to moan at the pleasant burn.
“Hi there, my name is Dean Thompson,” Dean said with his typical charming smile. “This is my partner Jack Page.” He gestured to the kid, who flashed his badge with an identical charming smile. Just like his father taught him.
night. His efforts to get out of bed this time were somewhat fruitful, he was able to place his feet against the floor as he sat at the edge of his mattress.
“They’ll figure it out someday, don’t worry. Now get some rest” Sam turns off the bedside lamp next to Jack’s bed.
“Do you want some hel-'' Sam began but was interrupted by Dean rushing out of the room. A pregnant pause permeated in the air. “Guess not,” he muttered, mirroring Cas’s confusion. The three hunters sat confused by the war room table, each with the same thought in mind.
Castiel pondered for a moment. He finally spoke a bit stronger this time. "Alright. What was the price?"
“But we don’t have much to go on and we can’t keep sitting on our asses,” Carlos says as he reaches out to shake Jack’s hand as well.
“Kites? Well, I am sure that is right up your father’s alley. Ain't it Cas?” Dean gives the angel a cheeky grin. Cas’s brow furrows for a second, but then his eyes widen slightly in recognition.
Cas turned to stare at the hunter as he lay on the ground next to him. They were all outside now, Sam and Jack having dragged them out of the cave once they collapsed. The kids were settled underneath a nearby tree, all huddled together for comfort. Cas opened his mouth to speak again, but the words wouldn’t come. He had no idea what had happened, only that he was here now, and that the burning in his arm was getting worse.
It took all of Dean’s strength to reach up and cradle the angel’s face in his hands without shaking. Dean paused and searched Cas’s eyes for approval, he needed to know he wasn’t the only one feeling this. He knew he wouldn’t be able to come back from this. The angel’s reply came in a breathless whisper of the word that always came so easily to him:
Dean rolls his eyes. “I know Cas, I didn’t bring you here for that.” He takes a moment to grab their picnic blanket from the car’s trunk before locking it. “Just- come with me.”
” Cas hung up the phone and turned to face his hunters. “The local cops don’t have much to go on right now. Said that the FBI could come down and take a look.”
Dean steals the occasional glance at the angel, hesitant. He has a question he wants to ask, but he’s not sure if he wants to hear the answer. Yet, he doesn’t know when they will get the chance to be alone like this again. It might be his only chance. The sun keeps descending in the sky and the wind is slightly rustling the leaves above them.
Dean barged into the kitchen and set the empty pizza box down next to the trash can and haphazardly threw the empty beer bottles in without bothering to look if they had gone in or not. They crashed against the metal, but not even their racket could snap Dean out of his downward spiral. He set a frantic pace around the kitchen island, nervously running his hands through his hair.
But that was precisely the problem. Every year, the ornaments all did as they had been told at some point in time by some unknown entity, just so they could come alive again next year. Why would someone create them to only live for 24 hours a year? From his spot, Dean could see the house they inhabited. He could see where the decorations changed year after year. He could see the mess of papers and trash that never seemed to be in the same place when he woke. They had even caught glimpses of the “human” that inhabited the tree’s house. The human was rarely around on Christmas Day, which meant that the ornaments could roam freely across the tree for the majority of the day.
Maybe not exactly the one he had been tasked with in the beginning, but the one he was destined to do regardless. He brought the Winchesters together again. He gave them something no other creature had ever done before, life without a price. A time where they could start over new. They had saved the world, now they just needed to save themselves.
Cas smiled as he helped serve the others, before settling in his usual spot right next to Dean. They were all a couple slices in, before the true shenanigans began. As they had eased into easy conversation about some cowboy movie that Dean was insisting Cas should see, Sam devised a plan. One that might just make two oblivious idiots realize they were perfect for each other. He knew it was wishful thinking, but hey, even card games got old after a while.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cas hesitates, as if carefully considering his answer. “Then we could always just fall together” he states, that determined look on his face again. There was something magnetic about his certainty, the warmth and comfort of his gaze.
He was in the middle of getting dressed for his 9th party in 2 months. He looked in the mirror, big green orbs staring at him back from a sea of freckles lightly dusted all over his body. He had lost some of his tan he noted. 'Gotta get back to the beach soon, too much work not enough play'
“It was certainly a very different set of molecules than peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.” Cas answered wistfully remembering the days when he had a sense of taste.
him feel this, punishing him for his indiscretions. So, what would happen if he tried to push back against It?
Walking into his bare bedroom, complete with a queen sized bed and even bigger TV, he stripped off his clothes and threw himself onto the bed. He couldn't help but note how big the bed felt to him that night, the uneasy feeling of something being missing was calling out to him even more. He suddenly found himself thinking of the listless amount of women he had slept with over the years, while they gave him momentary pleasure he just couldn't find it in himself to feel happy about it. He was older now and he even considered the thought of trying to find someone stable.
On the other side of the river stood a ghastly woman dressed in white. Her eyes were sunken, framed by ghostly pale skin that was tinged with what looked to be glimmering tears. Her mouth was wide open as she screamed, and she had her arms outstretched around the four remaining children. The children stood perfectly still with their eyes glossed over, seemingly taken over by a trance.
Because that is what the parties were. Work opportunities set up by his ridiculous manager Garth. "A chance to meet up with sponsors" he says and Dean wishes he could just go along with it. The problem was that Dean has always been popular... Which came at the price of drunk men and women throwing themselves at him the first chance they got. And he was tired.
“SAAAAM! They’re holding HANDS!” the boy screamed with pure glee in his voice. They could hear Sam chuckling the background.
Their eyes met briefly and they could each see the effect they had on each other. Dean was flushed a brilliant pink from the tip of his nose, all the way down his chest. His freckles traced a beautiful path down to his crotch that Cas wanted to trace with his tongue. He slowly moved one of his hands and grabbed onto the hunter’s cock, feeling the weight of it in his hands for the first time and giving it a tentative pull. “Is this alright?” the angel asked, watching as his lover threw his head back slightly before nodding his approval.  Cas teased along the side of his member, licking his way from base to tip with his tongue before pulling back and smirking at the hunter’s whimper. “I need to hear you say it Dean.” he teased.
The words spun around too fast in Castiel's head he suddenly felt dizzy. He stammered a weak "What...?"
Still, Castiel often found himself walking aimlessly through the long, winding corridors of personal heavens, wondering if he would ever have a room of his own. Each white door he encountered made him wonder about what it held inside. He wished he could allow himself the indulgence of taking a peek, but he knew it was strictly forbidden to do so.
“Damn Cas, not for nothing but Ronny’s isn’t necessarily a revelation” Dean teased through a nervous chuckle.
“Yeah, there’s some monsters that aren’t ours to hunt, sadly. Some of these bastards are still deep-down human.” Dean added as he came to a stop in the red light ahead of them.
The more he dwelled on it the more the words rang true to him. He had so much left to do, left to see, left to experience. He hadnt fallen in love, hadnt traveled far and wide as he had dreamed. He had studied and worked but nothing more. The taste of alcohol was foreign to his lips, his virginity evident to any who attempted to flirt with him. He truly was not ready, not yet.
Cas grinned, thinking fondly of Dean as he chose his next words carefully, “Then finish this. Make me human, keep my grace here and send everything else back. Send my soul back and be done with me, forever.” He paused, making sure he could meet the entity’s eyes, “Make me someone else’s problem”.
After an eternity, Dean sighed and a small smile decorated his features. Cas angled his head to look at him and felt his heart stop. The hunter was flushed, his hair messed up every which way and his eyes were barely open. He was the most gorgeous man Cas had ever seen.
Cas and Dean shared a worried, but knowing look. It seemed that this trip was going to be a little more than just kite flying. With a sigh, Dean picked up his phone and dialed Sam.
The detective stared at their badges and nodded. She was a beautiful, dark-skinned woman with curly dark hair. The old Dean would have been all over her with his charms. But now? He feels the ring on his left hand and smiles to himself. An inside joke of sorts.
"Great, so this is it. One ex-blood junkie, one drop-out with 6 bucks to his name and Mr. Comatose over there. Team Free Will."
“Dean? Are you still awake?” Sam’s voice came through the wooden door, destroying the frail hope Dean had held in his heart.
The station was crowded, different criminals being herded in for booking. Cops walking around discussing cases and even a jovial mail woman making the rounds around the office. Her metal cart filled to the brim with letters and packages with a radio precariously balanced on top. It was playing a salsa station they couldn’t really recognize, but she seemed to enjoy it as she sang the words under her breath. Dean and Jack made their way to the closest detective and flashed their FBI badges.
“Don’t you dare leave me again” Dean muttered into his best friend’s shoulder, his body trembling in their embrace.
Dean smiled, he did miss Charlie and he had some free time after training so "Yeah sure I would love that Charlie! See you after training."
Dean thought to himself as he threw the keys at his son. Cas’s eyes went wide at the exchange, but he still managed to break into a goofy smile that Dean could not quite look at without a sudden warmth rising in his cheeks. Sam smiled knowingly at his brother, and gave him their hacked credit card. Dean decided to ignore his brother’s smartass grin.
. A single look at the pure hunger in Dean’s face told him that he wasn’t the only one that felt that way.
Still, Castiel was a dreamer. He longed for something different, something more. He longed to spend time with Dean. To truly know him, not just the Dean he had come to observe from afar. Castiel waited for the upper ornaments to leave him alone to perform their duties, as he usually did, before moving to the far end of his perch. This was his routine every year. Take care of the ornament’s troubles, look after the tree’s health, give some orders and then just sit and wait until he could catch another glimpse of Dean again. Maybe that is why, when he saw Dean hesitate by his branch instead of leaving to visit family, Castiel made the first mistake of his whole existence. He leaned too close to the edge.
Cas took the paper and regarded the symbol. His brow furrowed and his head tilted slightly. “Yes, this is from a bonding ritual.”
Sam huffs “Yeah buddy, I am sure you can. But you don’t have to. Come on.” Sam stood and closed Jack’s laptop. The kid relents and let himself be led over to his bed.
“Don’t” his brother snapped, his voice breaking slightly and making it come out less intimidating than he had hoped.
They sit together, closer than they had been nearly all day. The silence between them was companionable, like this had always been their routine. Dean turned to stare at the angel, savoring what he suspected may be his last moments close to his side. Cas looks holy in the daylight, the sun falls delicately over his cheeks and shines in his eyes, making them reflect a brilliant blue.
Cas stood and made his way to the window. The sky was a beautiful, yet clouded blue outside. The view from their room was limited, but it did have one feature that the angel liked. A huge
Dean had woken up again a few minutes ago and he already could hear the rest of the tree bustling with activity. His brother, Sam, had come to say hi before leaving to hang out with Eileen, another middle ornament that he could tell his brother was quite fond of. It was nice, to see Sam live out some semblance of happiness, even if it was only for a brief period of time each year. Dean himself was getting ready to head out on his yearly rounds. He would probably visit his mother, Ellen, Jo and Bobby. If he had some time to spare, he might go find his dad over with the lower ornaments. It had been a couple years since he saw him. He knew he should go, yet he couldn’t bring himself to move. He always had the same routine, every single year. Dean was bored.
“Well, yes I knew he loved him. But Dean loves you and me too. I didn’t realize it was a different kind of love at first. Not until yesterday.” Jack added with a small smile.
Dean smiled at her and thanked her for the food before replying. “Yeah, well I made a promise to come back before we left. I couldn’t break a sacred promise with such a beautiful woman” he added, the smooth flirtation coming easily to the hunter. She tapped him lightly on his shoulder, with a blush.
“Uh, by here do you mean Earth or the bunker?” the boy asked hoping to further clarify his Dean’s intent.
The angel forced himself to snap out of it. Shaking his head, he dove straight for the middle of the light that was Dean's soul, stretching out his arms as far as he could reach. Trying, furiously, to reach him until…
After trying and failing, yet again, at communicating with Dean Winchester from the other plane he was in, he decided to search for a vessel. By some mix of extensive research and pure luck, he found a man by the name of Jimmy Novak, the man that would later give him his body, his life, his everything. Something Castiel would forever be grateful for.
“Dean?” he asked hesitantly to the nothing in front of him. It responded by giving his hand a firm tug and squeeze. The warmth began making its way up his arm, pleasantly nostalgic and inviting, like seeing an old friend after a long time apart. In a way, he guessed that is what was happening now.
Dean knew why Sam was bringing this up. He unconsciously rubbed at his arm, feeling a ghost pain of the scars he had there. he had an accident practincing for a race once, it had ended badly. The doctors had told Sam he may not make it out but somehow he did. Dean looked around his room and out the view of his room, the sun was dawning in the horizon. '' No, Sammy i dont have a race for a while, I'm on break but I am more careful now , you know that.... Bitch.'' Dean could hear the smile on Sam's face and after they said their goodbyes, he hanged up.
“I am here because of Cas.” Jack stated, and closed his eyes as he braced himself for the screaming he knew was sure to come. “Cas made a deal with the Empty: his life, for mine”.
Dean nodded and reached for the lore books that Cas had temporarily stolen from the local library. “Well, okay we can do that in the morning. For now, who or what the hell bonds children into an army?”
Dean wrapped his right arm around the angel’s waist and pulled him closer until their foreheads touched and they were staring into each other’s eyes. Cas’s eyes were wide, his pupils overcoming the brilliant blue as a small gasp escaped him.
The lock on the door clicked into place, and Dean looked up towards the sound. Their eyes met and Dean felt the air shifting again. Just like it had in the middle of that damn forest. And just like it had that day in Purgatory so many years ago. He felt exactly the same way he had so many years ago, but this time he understood it.
He decided to channel his nervous energy into something productive and walked towards the sink and started to wash anything in sight. Just as Dean had started to anxiously wash the few dishes that had been left in the sink, he heard footsteps come up behind him. The soft clack of dress shoes against the bunker floor had become a characteristic sound for the hunter. It could only mean one thing.
. That memory came along with a ragged emptiness in his stomach, “guilt” as he had learned to name it.
be alone again.” The light framed her face and shone on her frantic eyes as she laughed maniacally, her gaze focusing on Dean’s blade.
tree that was in full bloom. Its bright red flowers seemed like something taken straight from Heaven.
A small smile cracked on Dean’s face at the thought. Taking a deep breath, he sat on the edge of the bed and pushed Cas slightly with his right hand.
“You are overthinking things. I can practically hear the gears grinding in your head” Cas smirked as he reached for the next branch and pulled himself up.
Cas takes a moment to take the other man in. Dean’s face is framed by his tousled, blonde hair and stubble. His freckles stand out like stars on a clear night sky and Cas finds himself lost in them again. The weight of his feelings have been lifted off his shoulders. He is fondly reminded of Dean singing like he was “walking on air” when he thought no one else could hear him. That is exactly how Castiel feels at this moment. Angel of the Lord, fallen from Heaven, feeling like he was flying for the very first time. Dean has yet to move away from him, and a part of Cas hopes that it means he can feel this too. The raw energy between them. He was willing to do anything for the Winchesters. He would do anything for Dean.
After another swig, Dean turns to Jack and looks at him expectantly. The kid smiles and takes a moment to think. His hazel eyes brighten after a moment’s consideration. “I know! I saw a commercial for a place where we can fly kites. We could go there?”
The foliage in front of them was dense, making it harder to walk through. Cas’s shortcut had saved them nearly an hour of walking, but it hadn’t made the trip any easier. A fact that Dean made sure was not lost on his friend.
“The person you are talking about,” he says tentatively and doesn’t meet the hunter’s eyes, still unsure if he should voice his thoughts, “Its Cas, isn’t it?” Jack does look at Sam this time, almost like he already knows the answer, but wants someone else to confirm it.
“Well, Jack there’s many reasons for why someone would do it. It’s our job to find the monsters that do.” Sam offered as an explanation and a hopeful escape to the actual scarier answers.
Slowly but surely, they made their way back towards the base of the tree. They wordlessly agreed that getting back up through the back of the tree was their best bet if they wanted to avoid being seen. This also meant that they would need to stay close to the wall that was adjacent to the tree itself. At the stump, Dean gave Castiel a boost up to the nearest branch and then the angel leaned down and returned the favor. They walked silently for a while, each of the ornaments lost in their thoughts. Neither of them brave enough to address the subject at hand - why Castiel had fallen in the first place. They simply walked in tandem as best as the tree allowed.
“I’m sorry, he’s uh still in training.” Dean intervenes and everyone seems to settle down, but not without reluctance.
“Cas can be really handy sometimes, right Dean?” Sam teased, his joyful eyes shining mischievously. Cas nodded and cleared his throat as he rubbed the back of his neck to hide the blush spreading across it.
Zachariah, the representative leader of the Great Council, finished greeting everyone and welcoming them to the meeting. He stated their agenda for the day’s meeting: as usual, mission distribution, a few announcements and nothing much more. Castiel observed his superior. Zachariah stood tall and spoke with more arrogance and confidence that an angel with zero battlefield experience had any right to. No one particularly liked  him, but questioning his authority was not a thought that could ever go through their minds.
“So, she’s the Brazilian boogeyman?” Dean quips and earns a smack to the back of the head from Cas. The hunter stares at him with mock offense, and Cas rolls his eyes, a small grin on his face.
The girl’s smile widened as she looked between Cas and Dean knowingly (almost approvingly?) and left to place their orders in the kitchen. Once Cas turned back to the table, he found the shocked faces of two hunters and his son staring at him like he had grown a third head. His brow furrowed and his head tilted as he asked, “What? I believe ‘boyfriend’ is still the correct term for two male romantic partners, correct?”
"Thank you, Cas. For everything" The hunter murmured against his friend's coat. Small tears started to pool on Cas's shoulder as Dean's face pressed closer to it. Sam came forward, a huge smile on his teary-eyed face and he hugged them as well. Stuck between his favorite brothers in the world, Cas couldn't help but feel liberated.
Dean handed Cas a gear bag, his brow raised questioningly. “Didn’t know you still cared so much about bees.” The hunter teased, grinning with amusement. Cas simply shrugged and mumbled something akin to “They’re cute” through the blush forming on his cheeks. To anyone else their conversation would have seemed benign, but Cas knew better. He remembered the last time Dean had seen him with bees quite vividly. His cheeks flushed even further.
Dean and Cas drove away from the ice cream parlor parking lot with no clear destination in mind. They rolled the windows down and decided to drive down by the coast. The air smelled of sea salt and sand. Hopefully, they could find families enjoying the warm summer sun, . Secretly, they both wanted to lose themselves within each other. Enjoy another stolen moment, just like it had been for years. Dean smiled as they drove for what seemed like a thousand miles. They made occasional small talk, mostly just content to be in each other’s company.
They finally pull into the diner’s parking lot with a bright neon sign that reads ‘Bebo’s Cafe’. Sam and Cas were already there, getting out of the car once they saw Dean park. They made their way inside and sat in a booth not far from the restaurant’s entrance.
But even with all the success his life had turned into, Dean couldn't help but want something more. It wasn't tangible to him what exactly he wanted but especially when he looked up at the stars he felt something was missing.
Dean turns the keys in the ignition of his rental car and parks it. He takes a moment to check his phone: 7:15 am and still nothing. If he can get their damn breakfast before Sammy gets back from his run he should be in the clear. Grabbing his wallet, he steps out of the car and flinches at the loud sound the alarm makes. This is why he hates new cars, he would take his Baby over this pile of-
Once they reached the wall, Dean decided to throw caution to the wind and asked the question that had been running through his mind, “So, are we going to talk about how you ended up like a floor pancake?”
Sam is a recent graduate from Stanford working a job at a firm right out of college. He is married to Jess (yes the married early) and she is pregnant.
“That will be $45.67, handsome.” The young man at the cash register said with a wink. Dean felt his face warm slightly as the blush spread through it. The hunter developed a sudden interest on the floor and cleared his throat. The cashier smirked and proceeded to pack up their items in a paper bag. The flirtation was not lost on Cas’s ears. Even if he was currently near the back of the store flipping through a magazine, perhaps a little too forcefully.
Jimmy arrived an hour later. Charlie went out to say hi and introduce herself. When they came back into the office Dean jumped up from his chair and gasped.
“It’s fine Dean, I don’t have your qualms regarding personal space” The angel places his hand on the hunter’s, smiling. “Remember?”
"Nice isnt it?" the man in front of him asked. He was short, had slightly blonde auburn hair, his face seemingly plastered with a permanent smirk. His eyes were the most impressive thing about him though, they were a deep gold that shone as bright as... As the feathers he thought he saw as he fell. He took a step back, cautious.
The blood is drawn without so much as a peep from the angel. Once they had enough, Cas used his grace to heal his wound. A blinding white light shone from the cut on his forearm and then there was no trace of what Dean had done. They both sighed in relief. Dean set the closed bottle aside and went over to the sink to wash the remaining blood off the blade. The room was silent, the air around them felt thin as glass. They refused to speak as if one word would shatter everything around them. Everything they had built.
Dean was able to reach the child in time and saw the boy’s eyes go from glossed over to normal. Dean turned towards the bathroom and saw Cas standing in the doorway. He gave Dean a thumbs up. The child’s parents finally noticed that he was gone and they ran towards the hunter with panic in their eyes. Dean raised his hands defensively. “He’s okay, my uh” He paused to look at Cas who came up to join him. “My partner and I noticed your kid was running off without you. Thought we should tell him to come back.”
"The one on the left" said Zachariah, pointing to the pictures behind him. "That one is Samuel Winchester. Sufficiently smart, trained as a hunter, blindly faithful in Heaven’s work, plus disgustingly, yet conveniently loyal to his brother, which is the one on the right, Dean." As he reached the end of the stage, the angel lingered in his spot, his vision to the floor, almost like he was considering his next words carefully. "Dean Winchester is a difficult sort of human. Our intel suggests that he is not quick to trust, he is suspicious by nature, and a very powerful hunter, just like his brother. Unlike his brother, however, he is detrimentally loyal. He is capable of killing himself, just to save another, and though that quality should be useful to us, for reasons I am about to disclose, it could also jeopardise our entire operation."
''Hello?" Dean said grogily to his brother but frowned when he heard his brother crying. ''Sammy what happened?'' The silence made him tense and a number of things passed through his mind. His father, had he finally drowned himself alchohol? Or had Jess... His brother interrupted him with a laugh.
Dean had tried to help, occasionally helping him eye through a book or two, but as the days passed he found it impossible to keep still.So, he left Cas, went on hunt after hunt, killing every monster that he possibly could while hunting alone. Of course, Cas only knew because he could feel Dean's longing, constantly pulling at him like an anchor. He went through his days, feeling his grace tugging him this way and that. Until the day he found a way to rescue Sam, soul and all.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dean glanced in the rear-view mirror. Cas and Jack were both sitting in peaceful silence. The constant rocking didn’t seem to bother either of them.
Castiel nodded and made his best effort to seem expectant. The man nodded and suddenly they were sitting in a lavish room, full of expensive furniture unlike he had ever seen, it all seemed almost.. Angelic.
“I can definitely feel it.” Cas rasped, enjoying the sweet scent of flowers tickling his face as they drove by mountain after mountain. “Shut the AC off, we don’t need it here.” He spoke in Dean’s direction, and the hunter obliged. They drove for 15 more minutes, content to enjoy the sweet-scented breeze and the cool temperature that felt like a respite from the harsh, hot temperatures of the city. They came up to what could be loosely referred to as a parking lot but was, in reality, a small plot of land that people left their cars in. Since it was a Tuesday morning, the plot was empty save for them.
Dean’s eyes widen, an electric pulse coming from where the angel was touching him. The hunter tries to lie to himself. “Yeah, uh good cover.” He fails.
The paint on the ceiling of his room was chipped, and a single flake fell on top of his chest. He picked it up and held it between his thumb and index as he examined it. The front was white, once a pristine piece of a glossy whole. Yet, now it had fallen from its initial purpose, exposing the dark edges that had never seen the light of day before.
Dean scoffed. “A museum? No way, Sammy. Vacations aren’t for learning.” He takes a swig of his coffee, taking a moment to savor the bitterness. He was pleasantly surprised by the richness of the coffee and decides it's probably the best he has ever had.
Gabriel sighed, visibly sagging in an obvious growing annoyance. "Basically, Im a very strong angel, when you died I heard you screaming how you were not ready blah, blah, blah... And decided to give you that second chance with a price."
Sam reached for the pizza box closest to him, grabbing a slice for himself before pointing it towards Cas and asking: “Cas, do you want some of this?” And just like that, his plan was set into motion. Now he just needed to wait and see if his brother would take the bait.
“What the hell are you talking about Cas?” Dean demands, getting closer to the angel. Their eyes meet in an impromptu staring contest. Cas breaks their silence first by reaching out to grab the hunter’s hand. He tries to communicate what he means without words, unable to utter them again out loud. Sam is the first to understand.
“Cas- maybe” Sam tried to intervene, but Cas shot him a stern look that practically screamed ‘back off’. He needed to get this off his chest.
Look, I have so many feelings about this angel... I had to man, HE DESERVES IT. Stay tuned for the last chapter (and some sexy reunions) coming soon 0.0
“No,” Cas began, “I am not leaving. I didn’t crawl myself out of that empty wasteland just so you could push me away”. The former angel crept closer to the hunter, forcing him to step backwards until he was pinned against the edge of his bed. “I didn’t give up my grace,
“We’re here!” he exclaimed, before shutting the engine off and making his way out of the car. This time he kept an eye out for any running children, but none came. He shoved his keys into his pocket and walked towards the door. He held it open as Cas came up behind him, and made a show of letting him in first, a grin on his face. Cas rolled his eyes, but couldn’t stop the stupid smile from spreading on his face. Dean committed it to memory. Sam coughed something akin to ‘dumbasses’ under his breath, which made Jack giggle and earned him a fond “Bitch” from his brother. “Jerk” Sam answered, as was customary.
"You see, as they are now, humans are of no harm to us, at least not traditionally. However, we have been made aware of two humans in particular, who could possibly represent a threat or an advantage to us." Zachariah said, as he paced in front of the stage, his hands clutched tightly behind his back, which only made his vessel's large stomach more evident. Castiel snickered as he saw the buttons of the angel's shirt clinging for dear life. Hannah shot him a deadly look, and just like that he was concentrating once again.
Jack takes a moment to consider the hunter’s words before slowly moving back towards the window. He stops and adds “Or maybe you did what you don’t let yourself do when you are awake. You said it yourself, you don’t have control when you’re asleep.”
Sam brings his laptop over to them and shows them the trailer he saw. “I saw this movie trailer for ‘
Garth was sitting next to him at the bar, trying to explain a possible business deal but Dean was only half-listening, as dense as he was , Garth had proven quite competent at picking out his races so he trusted his decisions more than his own. Especially after what were now 6 shots. Dean turned around and glanced at his watch. 3:45am seemed to him a decent time to excuse himself from the party and leave, the club was close to his apartment building so he decided to just walk back home.
There was a loud thud followed by a muted curse and rustling before the door swung violently from its hinges, and a frantic Dean emerged to hold a gun up to the former angel’s face. “Who the hell do you think you are? Cas is-” his voice trembled, even after two weeks he still couldn’t voice it out loud, “Cas is gone.”
“Sounds like we are getting some pizza then.” Dean added as he nudged against his son on the way up the stairs. Jack trailed behind him with an excited smile on his face. They were temporarily left to their own devices, Sam and Cas could only hope that those two made it back in one piece.
“Well, do you recognize this symbol, Cas?” Sam said as he turned over the drawing he made. “It showed up on the chests of two of the children they have found so far.”
“Does the honeybee doubt its favorite flower, just because it's in a new field?” Cas replies, his voice soft and reverent as he clutches Dean’s hand.
Dean is shocked into silence. He remembers Cas confessing months ago, but he couldn’t bring himself to think that it was anything other than familial… Yet, now he’s here, saying everything Dean never thought he would hear. He doesn’t know what to do, he feels lost. Someone just pulled the rug out from under him, and he can’t quite get back on his feet. The silence drags on for so long, the sun has already set and night has slowly draped over them.
The bar had been cozy, warm and had just the right kind of beer and pies. Yet, Cas had agreed with Dean, it had all felt wrong. Though in Cas’s eyes, Dean wasn’t the one that had failed, it was him. Cas was the one that deserved the punishment.
Charlie noticed the change but didn't press any further knowing the news would make Dean happy anyway. "So get this, word around work this morning is that he's in prison!! Got caught being inappropriate with one of his party guests and they sued. More victims came up and he's going to be locked up for a long t-"
“Woah, Cas! What was-,``''Are you okay?” Sam and Jack each questioned. Sam’s brow furrowed as he stared between the angel and his brother.
Sam turned around to meet Jack’s eyes. “If you want, I can keep looking into this and if I come up with anything, I will let you know.” Jack hesitated for a moment but then nodded. Sam gave him a small smile. “So, how about you do some kite-flying while you wait?”
Jack wasn’t the person he wanted to ask this to, but considering they weren’t home yet, he guessed there was no harm in trying. “Hey kid.” Jack hummed to indicate he was listening. Dean decided not to let his nerves stop him, like they had before. “Do you think your father is happy here?”
“Cas, is that really you?” his voice cracked and his eyes widened with hope. Cas couldn’t help the smile that broke through his face and he quickly wrapped his arms around his son again. He felt Jack sag in relief against him as he wound his arms around his father as tightly as he could.
In turn, Dean stared at the angel. His dark hair was shining brightly in the summer sun, which only made his eyes look more impossibly blue. His trenchcoat was flapping slightly in the breeze, and for a second it gave Cas the illusion of wings. Dean forced his gaze away from Cas and towards their son. A small smile crept up on him.
As they kissed, the buttons on Cas’s shirt found themselves undone and the shirt was frantically discarded in its entirety, along with the offensive undershirt.
He moves away from the hunter, clearing his throat as he lets his gaze fall to the floor. “I hope that it was enough,” Cas adds, his voice rough. His true meaning hiding behind his rough words.
“Alright kid, you gonna let us in or what?” Dean chuckled as his cheeks tinged a lovely light pink. If Cas held his lover’s hand a little tighter at that, no one could really fault him for it. They made their way into the room, and sat on the bed opposite to Sam. Jack turned off the TV and came up to join them, taking a place next to Sam.
Somehow, he felt lighter than he ever had in his life. No. That wasn’t true. He had felt this way before, a long time ago.  Back when he was… human. He reached one hand towards his back, and felt a burning pain between his shoulder blades as he tried to touch where his wings had once been. He understood the pain now. The horrible burning he had felt in the Empty had been the entity burning his grace away from him, taking his wings and his angelic power. Yet, as promised, It had left a single soul. His soul.
The angel reached out to touch Dean, intent on using his weakened grace to check him for injuries. Sam and Jack shared a look, but otherwise, let the angel try to help. They both knew how much Dean meant to him. To all of them. The moment Cas’s fingers came into contact with the hunter’s arm, he felt an electric shock come from the hunter and go straight to the burning in his arm. He flinched and his face contorted in pain.
Once he heard Sam and Jack leave, Dean finally released the breath he was holding. A single, painful sigh that racked his body before it turned into a heaving sob. The tears were flowing freely from him now, joining the black stain left behind by It. Where there had once been a beautiful, bright, angelic soul, now there was just a hollow pond of nothing.
Dean moaned softly before whispering “Please, Cas.” His voice broke on the last syllable, obviously desperate for more. The angel clicked his tongue and shook his head slightly. “You can do better than that,” he stated, and at that moment he discovered how much he loved making Dean squirm like this. The hunter sighed before meeting the angel’s eyes, hunger burning brightly within both of them.
As he sped through the dark road, a call came through his phone. Taking his eyes of the road, he never saw the round head lights of the truck approach him. He never saw the impact, only snapping his head up at the sound of a loud crash, shock, pain and then... Silence.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cas nodded and answered without breaking eye contact with Dean. “Together until death” he whispered. The moment the words left the angel’s mouth, Dean felt the same words bubble up inside him. They escaped his mouth without him being able to stop it. An intense warmth went through both of them once they uttered the words, which made both hearts race and thump rapidly against their chest. The air around them shifted, making the air seem cooler and the trees an almost impossibly vibrant green. At once the words disappeared and gave way to another marking:
Dean, on the other hand, was uncharacteristically quiet. He was sitting next to Cas, looking at the argument unfold between his brother and his son with a small smile. He seemed to be lost in thought, but there was a twinkle in his eyes that made his smile stand out even more. Cas couldn’t help staring at him, not only because he was beautiful, but because it was rare that he ever got to see this side of Dean. Judging by the state he had been when he arrived back at the bunker, Cas assumed that it had been a while since he had smiled at all.
Cas hesitated, playing with the frayed end of his trench coat. The brothers did not know about the deal he had made, not entirely. He didn’t want to worry his family, especially not after they had just gotten their son back with ‘no strings attached’. It was best if they continued to see it that way. The angel took a deep breath  and met the hunter’s eyes as he reached for his hand.
“No, they were close but never in the water. All of the parents say that they saw them one moment and the next they were just gone. No sign of them anywhere.” Carlos added, taking a swig from the cup of coffee he had left on the table.
A black, oozing goo that was slowly enveloping the ground underneath Cas’s form. The hunter tried to reach for his angel’s arm when Cas turned into nothing right at his fingertips. Leaving behind nothing, but goo and two confused hunters in his wake.
“Yeah okay, I thought about that, so I looked a little deeper into it. There’s a Brazilian version that sounds more like ours. Over there it’s referred to as an “
“Thank you for bringing me here, Dean. I appreciate the gesture.” Cas leans back, holding himself up with his hands and stretches his legs out on the blanket. Content to at least share what he suspects is his last moments by Dean’s side. The sun is setting for them...in more ways than one.
She stares at both men for what feels like a long time. She meets Cas’s eyes and the tension in her shoulders melts. There’s something about him that she knows she can trust. “Okay, but you will have to translate.” She points at Cas. “She doesn’t know how to speak in English yet, but she does understand it. I would translate but I… can’t bear hearing her go through everything again.”
Sam opened the door and hesitated as he took in the state of the room. His brow furrowed and a frown settled on his face. He was holding a bowl of something steaming in his hand and he held it out to Dean as he stepped further into the room.
“Damn Cas, next time pick a shortcut with a little less thorns, babe” the hunter teased, pushing aside a branch.
Their line of work required sacrifice. Every morning, hunters knew what they had signed up for. A life full of pain, death, and suffering. Yet, it was days like this that helped Sam and Dean remember why they had decided to live life on the road.
There were a thousand questions in each of the hunter's minds, but a small sneeze snapped them out of their racing thoughts. The five children were still sitting by the nearby tree, looking at the men intently. There were words left unsaid, and feeling left unchecked. But for now, they had children to bring back home. Saving people, hunting things, the family business.
He took another step forward, forcing himself to stop dwelling on his fears. If he was back too late, he still wanted,
The angel turns to look at his friend, laying the leaf down between them. “Of course, Dean. Anything.”
They all settled at a table near one of the windows, right underneath some lovely pictures of Mirna and her family. The moment Cas laid eyes on the picture, she walked through the kitchen doors and up to the counter to start cleaning it. A waitress came from the kitchen as well, holding some mugs and a pot of coffee. She was wearing a worn, pink dress that said
Jack smiled warmly at his father. “That is good enough for me!” He reached for the second box of pizza decidedly ignoring Sam’s judgemental gaze.
“You are not allowed to take these out of the bags. Are you insane?” Carlos yells at Jack, ripping the bear out of his hands. Dean steps between them, his hands held up in order to placate the raging investigator.
Dean set the map in the clearing between them and walked them through their strategy. “Based on where we are right now, we are only a couple yards away from the nearest cave entrance.” He points a little higher on the map from their current location, tapping the map lightly with his index finger. “It should be behind a waterfall, which makes sense considering the bitch seems to need water.”
“Jack made a new beef stew recipe, it's pretty good so I brought you some” he gestured to the bowl and waited for his brother to take it.
Cas smiled softly, savoring the feel of Dean’s arm around his shoulders as they walked down the new branch. “I am inclined to believe that being an angel is not as glamorous as it may seem.”
Many ornaments believed that they each needed to return to their specific spot before Christmas ended so that their spell continued to work. But that was just a folktale. An old legend that had telephoned its way down the tree until it was so twisted that it involved everyone’s complete obedience. The truth was that the only person that truly needed to be at his place was Castiel. For years, he had done his duty. He had protected their tree and looked after the ornaments as they cheered or fought. He had not minded that he couldn’t leave his spot. Sure, his view and power were nice, but that wasn’t the reason he didn’t mind staying. His reason was much more selfish. From his perch at the top of the tree, Castiel could see Dean, one of the middle ornaments, who he had fallen for the first time he laid eyes on him.
Right next to Castiel, she had placed the figurine that looked suspiciously like Dean dressed in some festive clothing. “Why did you put Dean there?” Chuck asked, the first words he had uttered to Becky since the tree had been set up. She smiled as she looked at the tree and shrugged nonchalantly. “I don’t know, it just seems like that is where he belongs, don’t you think?” No, he did not think that at all. Dean was supposed to be his perfect, all-American, red-blooded male protagonist. No one was ever supposed to share a spot by his side. Chuck soured at the thought that his own creations plotted against him, even if it was subconsciously.
His grace layered over him, like an ethereal shield against the pain the Empty tried to inflict. He was stronger than his suffering now. He was stronger because he had something that could make even the sharpest, cutting words shatter. Cas had love. He had love for his son, for Dean and for Sam. Something worth fighting for, and a family worth returning to. His grace was interwoven with every single positive memory Cas had in his possession. A small smile escaped him as he realized that they significantly outweighed the bad ones. Which is why the Empty had tried so hard to make him forget. But, you can never truly forget the good, not if it was the only times you ever felt truly alive. The Empty wouldn’t be able to touch him anymore. At least, hopefully, long enough for him to escape.
She smiled, and Dean nodded along praying she hadn’t asked a question. She started pouring the coffee into the cups in front of her and screamed without missing a beat: “Julio!”
Castiel blinked, he seemed shocked for some reason that Dean couldn’t quite place. He cleared his throat, “Yes,” He jumped up and started dusting off his coat, his hands shaking “-I am alright… I think. Where are we?” he asked, looking up towards the tree.
It took Cas about 5 hours to reach the Winchester’s bunker. Once he woke up on Earth, his only prayer had been that he wasn’t too far from Lebanon, Kansas. Thankfully, his wish had been granted. The Sun was starting to rise slowly in the horizon, lighting the sky ahead in a wonderful flame. He was finally going home. He would be able to hold his son again, and this time he wasn’t sure if he would ever let go.
Later that same day, Castiel found himself staring at a park full of children. A park full of life that Heaven would have eradicated without a doubt, but the Winchesters had managed to save. As he sat there, on the park bench next to the Righteous man, Castiel found himself sinning for the first time. He confessed his doubts, trusted them with Dean. He finally allowed himself to question those orders that had always bothered him, deep down within his grace. The disputable actions he had seen some of his brothers and sisters take in the name of the 'greater good.' Looking back on it, Castiel would agree that was the day everything in him started to change. That was the day the Winchesters started to chip away at his angelic armor, so they could build him back up with their humanity.
Dean, on the other hand, had refused to accept Sammy's death that way. At least, that’s what Cas found out years later. The hunter had confessed he had several thoughts run through his mind that night, as he had taken what had felt like his millionth shot. "There's a way to get him out, there has to be", “This is all wrong”, and “It should have been me” were just some of the very thoughts that Cas had found mostly heartbreaking.
“Alright, I’m thinking we can say that I am FBI here to look into the disappearances, and you are the child psychologist. Maybe that way they feel a bit better about letting us talk to her?” Sam says looking through his backpack for his badge.
Dean assured Edgar he would stay in touch and faced Jack as he tilted his head towards the exit indicating it was time to go. Jack left with a small salute to the detectives, which they returned hesitantly.
Dean flinched at the nickname Garth insisted on calling him. Garth was a nice enough guy, Dean just has never gotten along with rays of sunshine.
Thank you to everyone for finishing this fic with me! This story meant the world to me, and got me through some dark times.
There was a slight buzzing coming from the wall now, Dean’s voice trying to reach him, but seemingly getting lost in the vast abyss. He was only able to make out one word, along with a sense of urgency: “Cas”.
Both Dean and Castiel quickly learned that getting back up the tree was ten times harder than coming down. It was also taking five times longer. With each branch they climbed they knew, logically, that they were closer to the top. Yet, stuck between the endless white wall and the deep green of the tree, both ornaments felt there would be no end to their climbing.
“It could be a mermaid! They like attracting their victims with song and live in water.” Jack adds on a hopeful note.
Sam smiled. “I think that’s a great idea, Jack.” He turned to Dean. “Take Cas for a ride close to water and keep a lookout for Ms. Trunchbull.”
As they paused to catch their breath, the couple stared into each other’s eyes. Cas tried to count the freckles he loved so much, and Dean just wanted to dive into the ocean of the angel’s eyes. The hunter let the warmth that coursed through his veins take over and whispered the words he had kept buried for eleven years.
“Alright, let’s go fly some kites.” Dean finished the rest of his breakfast and grabbed his keys to go.
Sam took out some gauze, cotton balls and alcohol and started to tend to his brother’s wound. He worked in silence for a while, only the occasional hiss from Dean between them. As he was wrapping the gauze around Dean’s foot, Sam paused. “Look, I know that with Cas gon-”
Castiel's eyes snapped open, fear evident within them. Turning, he ran as fast as he could. He cursed at the halls and  their seemingly infinite length. Though beautiful, they made it extremely difficult for him to rush to the Grand Hall.
"SILENCE!" Zachariah's voice boomed, urging into quiet the entire room. He cleared his throat, running a hand through his hair, trying his best to compose himself. "I know this topic makes us all restless, but please allow me to finish, for the elders have come up with a wise plan."
They walked into Dean's motel room a week later. Dean tensed, before finally running to his brother. As Castiel watched Dean embrace him in a bone-crushing hug, Cas felt something he had never felt before. He felt...happy. More than that, he felt at peace with the world. He knew he had completed his mission.
Cas turns to meet Dean’s gaze, a determined expression to his eyes. “You can come with me” a pause, “to the top”, he clarifies.
Dean and Cas managed to wrestle the blanket onto the ground, and Sam joined them soon after. The long-haired hunter continued his search for the missing children just as he had promised Jack. So far the case didn’t seem to turn up anything they recognized as signs of the supernatural. Maybe this was just a sad coincidence. Dean watched as Jack flew his red kite in the distance with nothing but pure glee on his face.
-lievable.” Cas whispered conspiratorially to his son, quite proud of his pun. Jack snorted,  trying to hold back his laughter, but a cheesy grin still managed to make its way through.
son. After all, bringing everyone together was the entire purpose of this family vacation. Speaking of which, judging by the time, Sam suspected that Cas and Dean might have gone back to vacation mode. The sun had already set, yet still no word from them. He decided to shoot them a follow-up text just to make sure they were okay. With a frown forming on his face, Jack closed yet another lore book that was fruitless in their search. He rubbed his eyes and tried to hold back a yawn.
"We had an appointment" Cas replies, the hint of a smile on his lips. Dean smiles back, his soul seemingly glowing in front of Cas. He feels Dean reach out to grasp his shoulder, a tender squeeze to emphasize his words.
They sit in comfortable silence for a while. They were both seemingly content with each other’s company. Jack breaks the silence by turning to face Dean completely. “Can I ask you a question, Dean?”
Dean spotted an empty table by the corner and placed a hand on the small of Cas’s back to lead him to it. The angel tensed in his grasp before moving to sit on the chair opposite Dean. He couldn’t quite meet the hunter’s eyes.
“Think about it” Cas pleaded, “with me gone, you could have your peace again. I would never come back here”.
Dean’s hands roamed up his boyfriend’s sides as he reached up to capture his lips into another kiss. Drastically different from their kisses just moments before, this one was softer, more exploratory than the others. He had just wanted Cas to feel good, to feel appreciated. Part of Dean wanted to make up for lost time, but the rest of him just wanted to see how many of those blissful noises he could coax from his very own fallen angel.
Tears ran down the sides of his face, his anger slowly leaking out of him along with them. “What have you done, Cas?” he muttered, “what have you fucking done…”
What Cas didn't see was how he fit into that picture. As he saw the tears run down Dean's face, he knew that his job here was done. Dean could continue to find his 'apple pie life' as he so fondly called it. Sam could go back to college and be the lawyer he always wanted. And Cas? He could return to Heaven, fight to have peace there as well. To find a new purpose for his kind.
Dean was beautiful. Every year, the moment that Castiel opened his eyes, he would search out Dean. His heart would thump violently against his chest as he watched Dean wake and greet his brother. He always smiled when he saw him, a bright and shining sight which was getting more alluring every year. Thanks to his angelic powers, Cas could observe Dean in much detail. He could see his light blondish hair shine against the christmas lights and his perfectly fitted  clothes wrap around him gracefully as he moved. Castiel was the angel, but Dean was truly holy to him.
Murmurs erupted around the room. Heaven did not have many 'assets' as Zachariah called them, and whenever actively using said assets was being considered, it indicated that something dangerous was about to happen. Before his audience could become restless, Zachariah continued.
And now, all he would have to do is sit back and watch as they suffered. Perhaps seeing if this Dean and Cas found a way back to each other could serve as an experiment for him. Maybe if he saw it happen up close, he could try to understand where he had gone wrong in the real world. If anything, it would be entertaining to see them struggle uselessly against a pointless existence. One of the other Dean Winchester’s of his parallel worlds had once told him that existence was a prison, but death was much worse. Dean hadn’t known how right he had been at the time. Existence could indeed be a prison, and death a tragic fate, but Chuck could make sure they never forgot that every prison has its solitary.
“My wings aren’t...functional?” Castiel responded slowly. He was dumbfounded at why Dean would assume such a thing. The ornament’s eyes went wide in response.
“My favorite toy Hummu was taken by the waves, so I went to grab her but-” Maria stops and curls into herself, hugging her knees to her chest. Tears start to stream down her face.
They stopped for food on the way back to their hotel, all of them eager to eat and finally get some sleep. As they made their way to their room, Cas and Dean kept stealing the occasional glance at each other. Right. They had saved the day, but there was still a lot left unsaid. Dean’s hand itched to reach out to the angel, to hold him like he had just a couple days earlier. Maybe they needed another sunset.
“I'm not hungry” Dean refused, not bothering to even look at the food. He could smell it as it slowly took over the room.
His head snapped back to Dean when he felt the hunter grab hold of his hand. The angel looked from their joined hands to Dean's face and saw what he had seen in Hell so many years ago. The blinding soul that shined so bright with hope and love, something that could never be dimmed.
“Well, we know it can be any kind of water source. So as long as where we go has indoor plumbing, we should be fine.” Cas supposes. “Actually- well nevermind.”
At a distance, Dean can see Sam with Eileen, Ellen, and Bobby sitting near his favorite perch. They are looking up at him, their brows furrowed and their arms flailing as they try to get his attention. He waves back at them using the hand that Castiel has officially taken as hostage on his own. Below them, he can hear the rustling of the other angel ornaments frantically trying to make their way up to them. Dean knows that there will be hell to pay for their transgression and that they were running out of time before the Human returned.
“Yes, a bonding ritual.” Cas agreed, before continuing “I presume that the monster was trying to finish her spell on the children before you killed her, but it backfired somehow.”
“What do you mean ‘Empty’?” Dean grounded out towards Jack, trying his best to keep himself from imploding. He knew exactly what his son meant, but he didn’t want to believe it was true.
The smell of strong coffee flooded Sam’s senses as he slowly stirred in his bed. As the hunter opened his eyes, he found Jack standing by the room’s tiny sink fumbling with the coffee maker. He looked almost frantic, like a junkie waiting for his fix.
Cas grabs hold of his friend’s hand, a seemingly permanent smile decorating his face. They walk up the remaining branches, their hands clasped for as long as they possibly can. It's only a couple branches before they make it to Cas’s usual spot. The angel was right, he could see everything from up here. Smiling, Cas leads Dean to his favorite spot, the one he could see Dean’s perch from. They are in plain view of the other ornaments now and there is no hiding where they had come from nor Dean’s presence exactly where he shouldn’t be.
“She’s right, can’t let this one get away.” Dean winked before he leaned in to give Cas a chaste kiss and turned to start ravaging his food.
With all the effort he could muster, he put some distance between them. “Cas, I need to stop man, I really fucking need a shower,” Dean grumbled, as he tried to ignore the angel’s soft whimper in protest. His heart clenched, but he still managed to grab the clothes he had been looking for and headed towards the bathroom. It wasn’t until he almost reached the bathroom door that he realized there were steps following him. He turned to find Cas staring at him, his pupils blown wide. There was an adorable blush delicately frosting his cheeks and nose. He looked like he was mulling over a specific question in his head. Dean wanted to kiss him again.
Sam snorted. “More like their ‘profound bond’ broke her spell.” That comment earned him a smack from the pillow closest to Dean. His mock violence trying to hide the warm blush he felt spread on his cheeks at the mention of his bond with Cas.
Cas stood and started to remove his shoes and dress shirt as well. Dean turned around under the guise of modesty. In reality, he didn’t trust himself around a semi-naked Cas. Which is why he had bitched and moaned when Jack had called dibs on bunking with Sam. But, everyone knows you can’t mess with dibs, so he ended up having to room with his (not that he would admit it outloud, but devastatingly handsome) friend. When the hunter finished changing into his sleep clothes, he turned to find the angel already laying down on the bed.
As the nephilim took the girl to relative safety, the hunters followed the girl’s instructions. The dark tunnel was smaller than the rest of the cave, which forced them to walk in almost in a single file. There was a soft rustle that echoed all around them in the tunnel until the walls finally gave way to a cavern. The cavern floor split in half by an underground river that fed spots of moss on nearby rocks. Even though the river was flowing, they could barely hear the sploshing. The moment they stepped into the cavern an incessant screeching shattered against their eardrums.
“I know that my lack of powers will be inconvenient when we are hunting, but I can train and get bett-” Cas had rushedly tried to assure the hunters he wouldn’t be a deadweight, but stopped when he felt Dean’s arms wrap around his body, pulling him in for the first time since he arrived. His breath caught in his chest, a small gasp leaving him before he embraced the hunter back.
As the man sat across from him, Castiel stared as if he could see straight to the man's soul and figure out why he was drawn to him. Once again ripped from his thoughts when the stranger snapped his fingers in front of his face.
Before he knew what he was doing, he was slowly leaning towards Dean, their faces a breath’s width away until Dean closed the distance between them. He felt the hunter’s soft lips against his own for a moment, making the warmth in his heart spread further down until those lips left as quickly as they arrived. It was a chaste kiss that lighted the hope within his newly human soul and left him desperate for more. Sam teased them immensely for it during the rest of their breakfast, but Cas felt so alive that he was practically vibrating in his seat.
Cas shook his head gently. “No, thank you Sam. I'm alright.” he grinned as he pushed the box closer to his son. “Share it with Jack instead, I am sure he doesn’t mind,” he added with a wink in his son’s direction who looked at his father with pure adoration in his eyes before grabbing another slice for himself. That kid certainly took after Dean when it came to food.
Dean’s hands tightened around Baby’s wheel, his knuckles turning white from the force.  “Look Cas, I know that when you...
After walking further inland for a while, they stop to rest at a small clearing. The grass is short and flattened in this area making them think this was a common resting spot for other travelers. Sam rummages through his bag and pulls out several snack bars that he shares with his family. They all sit in a tidy circle on the grass, the sound of cellophane crinkling in the soothing silence of the forest.
Cas also noticed that Jack was gone. He must have woken up earlier and left to find Sam. He had left the angel’s trench coat neatly folded on the bed. Cas decided to get up and check for himself. Just as he finished getting dressed, Dean came out of the bathroom. There was no sign of his previous panic, which the angel was grateful for. He nodded once in Cas’s general direction without meeting his eyes and left the room. Presumably to meet up with his brother and son. Cas followed soon after.
Castiel, Angel of Thursday, who only a couple days earlier had waltzed into his life and challenged everything that Chuck had ever known. This rebel angel, the one that came with a crack in his chassis, unwittingly stared straight into the eyes of his creator and said: “Well, we are making it up as we go.” That was the day that Chuck had lost for the first time in his very long life, and now he had a Christmas tree with his insubordinate creation smiling benevolently at him from the place of honor.
Cas pulled up his sleeve to reveal the Enochian markings. He smiled fondly, “Yes, they are Enochian for ‘Us’” Dean mirrored the angel’s movements and looked at his own markings. As he traced the outline with his fingers, he shivered as a small burst of electricity tickled at his skin. They were connected by the markings somehow and judging by the look on Cas’s face, there was something else the angel was not saying.
Castiel took the blade in his hand. Twirling it around almost naturally, though he had never handled a sword before in his life. He suddenly felt a power rush through him, like he could do anything. He swung at the air close to Gabriel's face. He smiled at the archangel's surprise.
The voice was a smooth sound with a thick British accent straight out of the 1800s. He stood back from the man in front of him in shock. Castiel had never been... Flirted with before. He wasn't sure if to fight or run in horror.
The cashier took one cursory glance at the paper on the window and sighed. “It’s been there for nearly a month now. There’s other kids too. This whole place has really turned into a craphole lately.”
That was his breaking point. When God had burned his son’s soul away to the Empty, he had burned every shred of hope left within Cas. That pain had seared into his vessel and had left a permanent scar. The same scar that had made Cas wake up to check on Jack as he slept at night, and the one that made him wrap a hundred scarves around Jack’s neck if it was chilly outside. This memory seared off what was left of his body, igniting the pitch black walls of the Empty around him. The Empty was an oil drum and he was the match.
They left that day with a sour victory. Lucifer was sent back to his cage, but at the cost of both their brothers’ lives. For Cas, this was something he was accustomed to. All the garrisons that went on special missions knew the risk, and they rarely returned just how they had left. Angels died. "Collateral damage", as Zachariah would say.
For the first time, in what seemed like an eternity, the Winchesters were a family again. Two salty hunters, one half-angel kid and a dude who recently came back from the dead.
“There’s also the bonding ritual. Why would they bind these children to them and simply let some go?” Sam ponders.
. Many rigorous hours, several beers and one snoring nephilim later, Sam believes he finally might have caught a break. He scrambled to find his phone so he could call his brother.
, don’t want to make your husband there mad at me.” She pointed at Cas when she said that, setting down his plate in front of him. Cas perked up at the comment and quickly studied Dean’s reaction. The hunter took a moment to look at everyone that surrounded him, his gaze stopping at Cas. His mother’s ring on his left hand seemed to burn as he replied.
“What about yesterday?” Sam questioned as he made his way to get his beer that had been left on the table. He takes a swig.
He slowly drew some of his grace back from his hand, bracing himself for the pain of the sparks, yet it never came. His hand went softly through the goo, the sparks feeling like soft prickles against his skin. Suddenly, something held his hand in a vice grip. It surrounded him, a gleaming warmth that didn’t hurt, but didn’t recede either. He gasped and tried to pull his hand back when he heard a sound.
The ghost turned to stare at Dean, her head tilted as she regarded him quizzically. Her eyes fell on the blade in his hand and she hissed at it.
He knew he should leave, but he couldn't bring himself to. At least not without saying goodbye. As he wriggled himself free from their embrace, he gazed at the hunters. A small smile flickered across his face as all the good memories they had together came flooding in. The fights, the banter, the drives, everything they had shared, seemed so precious compared to the rest of his long life.
” With a smile, he stepped on the gas and felt the wind rustle his hair. This vacation was going to be great.
Life as an ornament had never been easy for Dean. He knew he was privileged. He had a relatively high spot on the tree which meant that- for one night a year- he got to come alive with one of the best views in the house. His spot on the tree had many branches that were perfect for sitting in without slipping to the floor. Thanks to a particularly strong and long branch, he also had a prime view of the angel at the top of the tree. The same angel who sat at the place of honor which so many other ornaments wished they could even glimpse at. Dean had a full view of  him every single year. It was one of the few perks of being a middle ornament.
