At this, Sherlock manages a nod before giggling and looking to the ground. This time he’s sure he’s blushing.  John starts walking forward and Sherlock follows him.
“It sounds like an interesting place for a murder. Perfect for the world’s only consulting detective,” says John with a fond smile. He pauses a second before continuing. “Just think about it. You don’t need to decide now.” He takes a drink from his mug. “The Chief Inspector sounded pretty desperate. It’s going to hit the papers tomorrow and they are a bit lost. I think they’ll continue to be lost without you.”
Robson gives Sherlock a knowing look and returns his smile. “You are under no obligation to stay, but I will not be minimizing your role in helping to catch Kyle Fletcher.” She reaches out and the two shake hands. “Goodbye, Sherlock. I wish you a safe and easy journey back to London. Thank you. Believe it or not, it’s been a pleasure.” Sherlock nods and makes his way out of the station, not bothering to say goodbye to anyone else.
Lestrade sighs. “Nothing concrete. Obviously, they are worried about terrorism or a kidnapping gone bad or the like. But there has been no claims of responsibility or ransom demands. Plus, CCTV makes it clear that the vic entered the passageways willingly. Nothing in the vic’s background to suggest a motive either. And not enough physical evidence at the scene to provide any clues.”
Uncle John observed waspishly. Clouded by his partisanship of the Princess as it was, his resulting description cast a startling light on tensions at the very heart of Gaaldine.
? He will have every village for ten miles around flattened and the crops burned. I cannot do that to our people.”
For one fleeting moment, Elizabeth saw something flicker in Molly’s eyes; a tightening around her lips which gave an entirely different cast to her gentle features. However disarming her manner, there was steel at Miss Hooper’s core, and woe betide anyone who provoked her to unsheathe it. Her nerves prickled.
Elizabeth’s brow creased in puzzlement. “Had Queen Felicia sought the throne in her own right, a generation ago, you mean?”
The district was too small to be exclusive. A father in trade would not have been a great handicap to Miss King’s social success. A mother engaged likewise was an eccentricity too great to be borne. Save with a handful of families of the second rank, she and her mother did not dine out and Elizabeth knew Miss King principally from the public balls of Meryton and her Aunt Phillips’s larger and less select gatherings.
A treacherous little eddy sent one of the sheets flapping close to her. She captured it beneath her sole on the very edge of the quayside, stooped and picked it up. It was closely written on both sides in a neat, precise hand.
“I can offer you no proof.” This time he made no effort to whisper. “Furthermore, the sources of my information will doubtless confirm your suspicions that I am indeed – that you suspect. Let that be so. But it would be wrong of you to ask you to hear my confession if I did not first warn you that it may not be safe for you.”
So, Julian thought with a small twist of pain, might he himself have sounded three months ago. He put the slightest shading of that thought into his voice. “Even for you. What I may confess – that, I daresay, is something the King’s intelligencers would be agog to learn.”
marriage. After all, what marriage could be considered clandestine if blessed by the bride’s mother and uncle?”
“The late Queen’s grace told me a strange story once, of a hunting party and an attempt on the life of King Ambrosine.” She paused. “The man her grace referred to in connection with that affair is an intimate of my brother’s and, by repute, the finest marksman in Gondal.”
That thought haunted him through all the corridors and ante-rooms of the palace, until at last the footmen threw wide the doors into the smaller of the two Royal writing rooms, the one preferred by the King for his most intimate audiences.
“We live amid a network of spies, both voluntary and paid. Our every move is witnessed. Spies permeate the highest levels of our councils.
one hears? When in this particular case I am doing nothing more dangerous than visiting one of my wife’s relations?”
) scenes to his wife was too incongruous. Then reality, and the recollection of Charlotte gossiping with the fishmonger, obtruded themselves. Whatever intelligence entered the Hunsford household, it was overwhelmingly likely it came there by way of the tradesman’s entrance.
“In these parts, ma’am, we have learnt to shift for ourselves. Lizzie! Come here. Hill, bring brandy, the strongest we have, and compresses. Light more candles. Many more candles. Mr – Bingley, is it not? Sir, you have a dislocated shoulder and every moment makes the resetting of it more awkward. Have command of yourself, sir, for the next moments will be unpleasant.”
There had been no Council convened to discuss this important intelligence. There had been no orders to remove Traquair from his position at the War Office. Instead, the whole matter swayed in limbo, put off to a more convenient season, while the seamstresses of Gondal strove against time to contrive the finery of forty years ago to grace the State Ball of the new King of Gondal and Captain Lennox raged, a caged beast, within the Earl’s house, until the time the King might deign to give him audience again.
It was impossible to tell which of them blushed the deeper; her cheeks felt on fire, and Mr Darcy’s looked so. But the greatest surprise was to have him greet her with civility. He was not at ease, no-one could have accused him of that. His words stumbled out without any order, and he repeated his enquiries after her family several times, without apparently heeding her responses. But he was certainly civil; more than civil. After a few minutes awkward conversation, from which her aunt and uncle stood politely detached, he seemed to recollect himself, gave a nod to the gardener as if to say, “Carry on” and took his leave.
Harriet felt several of the company of saints would have admired the fortitude with which she choked back what she would
“Do you think I should have devoted my time to more courtly music? The polyphonic motets of Lassus, perhaps? I assure you, there are more similarities between the two than you might think.”
These matters being settled, the quality of Gondal retired to their country estates or, at least, any to which they could, by hook or by crook procure an invitation, for the start of the shooting season.
Recklessly, the guards broke formation and ran towards the shout. Two more went down to arrows shot out of the dark.
Still, how had the deserters, even having incapacitated the sergeant, made their escape? Why did the house dogs not bark at their passing? Peter groped, as if through thick mud, at answers, but the sheer magnitude of the disaster at last overwhelmed him. This was, above anything else, a disaster of epic proportions. His career – perhaps even his life – was forfeit as a result. That was one truth shining out above the murk.
Mrs Gardiner nodded, before Elizabeth could finish the sentence. “Harriet always chatters when she’s upset. I know it relieves her feelings, and Jane is not the kind of girl to let her mother know how deeply it wounds her. It will be better for them to be apart until time has healed matters somewhat. But I trust, Lizzie, that no consideration with respect to this young man will affect Jane’s decision as to whether she travels back with us or not. We live in such a different part of town, and move in such very different circles that there is no likelihood that their paths will cross, unless the young man himself wishes it.”
If only that commanding officer still walked the earth, rather than being represented only by his relict: a hollowed shell, a walking ghost.
“I recall, now, there was a priest in Egremont, just a short, round-faced parish priest, like a thousand others up and down the land. He came up as we were setting out, and asked my blessing and then, when I had given it, looked up at me and said, ‘But you are more in need of God’s blessing than I, for I labour among friends, whereas your path encompasses the Paradise of Thieves.’ And when I asked him what he meant, and whether he had fears for my wagon train going through the gorge (for you should know, my dear boy, that rumours of bandits have been running rife for weeks) he shook his head, and said, ‘No; the real Paradise of Thieves lies at your journey’s end. The other is just a distraction on the way. But don’t be too hard on the boy when you meet him. If a man knows his father foully murdered and is too impatient to wait for the judgment seat, he may turn his feet to strange paths, and at least we can be thankful he’s not chosen the broad, broad road.’ He said it quite quietly, but I wondered if he were not a little touched, all the same, and made my leave quite abrupt. But perhaps his simplicity sees more into these matters than those of us who have grown sophisticated. I shall have him sent for; my secretary will have noted his name. I heard it but have forgot – something quite commonplace, Smith or Brown, or something of that sort.”
John is smiling at the camera. Both his mouth and eyes. He looks happy and…playful? The smile isn’t erotic or predatory or filthy. If someone just saw John’s face, they might assume the photo was innocent. But it’s not. John has put himself on display. There is no way it could be a mistake. The picture is perfectly framed, and Sherlock suspects John had to take a few to get it right. He certainly looked at the photo before sending it. John wanted Sherlock to see this.
By chance, Kyle Fletcher had been at the passages the day the temporary wall was installed. His sister had forgotten an important file and Kyle had offered to bring it to her. While he was there Fletcher decided to look at the construction and was allowed to roam unattended. He say the wall being put up and realized how easily it would be to take it down. It also happened to be the day the construction crew broke the lock on the emergency exit. The combination of a door that didn’t lock and a wall that could be easily removed gave Fletcher the idea to use the passages as
By the time the train pulls into King’s Cross, Sherlock has reread this morning’s texts dozens of times and is no closer to clarity. He forces himself to tamp down his angst as he pockets his phone and disembarks from the train. He finds John in the crowd immediately, at the far end of the platform, smiling broadly at Sherlock. It
John tilts his head towards the exit and starts walking. Sherlock follows, making quick work of the croissant. He was hungrier than he thought. John is leading them towards the Euston Road exit where there is both a taxi rank and an entrance to the tube. Sherlock already knows that John’s frugal nature (aka being cheap) will steer them towards the latter.
“But you still went to the emergency exits to avoid the cameras,” Robson says. It’s a statement, not a question. Fletcher nods. “What happened in the passages, Kyle?”
Sherlock is pleased with how invested John is in this case. He certainly trusts John far more than the police. Even though John still types with two fingers, he has become quite skilled at online research.  “Thanks, John. Talk later.”
Beyond the risk of missing work, technically the case was open-ended, and John wouldn’t risk a prolonged absence away from Rosie. John and Sherlock had both agreed that they would never
“Without a doubt. She’s one of the best coppers I have ever worked with,” Lestrade responds without hesitation. Sherlock thinks that’s relatively faint praise given the quality of the DI’s colleagues over the years. But he can tell that Lestrade is telling the truth.
Sherlock smiles. “Let me tell you about Exeter and its impressive underground aqueducts, Watson. They were built in medieval times to bring water to the church and, eventually, the citizens of the town.” Rosie furrows her brows in thought, and she snuggles into Sherlock to hear more. Sherlock knows that all children are fascinated with new knowledge, but he believes that Rosie is
clandestine meeting spot. Once Madison Rice agreed to meet, Fletcher dropped in on his sister again and managed to remove the screws undetected.
It helps that John has kept in amazing shape. Yes, he’s a little bit softer around the middle but he’s still strong and quick. Sherlock’s eyes rest on his shoulders and chest for a moment. Sherlock would still pick John to win in any fight regardless of the age and fitness level of his opponent.
shifted slightly in the past five years, however. Expanded. Now home was not a person, but people – John
place. In his youth, home was the books he read voraciously to escape the torment and tedium of his peers. As a young adult home was the entire city of London. Anywhere would do – be it the building where he slept, a drug hollow, or walking along the Thames – the city itself gave Sherlock at least a fleeting sense of home. Once he moved into 221B Baker Street, however, home got a lot smaller. It also grew in importance. Even in the years he was away, Sherlock’s sense that his home was a flat in Marelybone never wavered. At the time he was sure that it was the physical place itself that was home. Now he knows better. The flat was nice, cozy and comfortable, but it wasn’t home. It still isn’t. For more than a decade home has been a person – John Watson. John is Sherlock’s anchor and has been for the duration of their friendship, even through the time the doctor didn’t live within the confines of Baker Street. Home
“Yes, that would be good John. There must be some clue about his identity I’m missing.” Sometimes just saying things out loud to John helps Sherlock see connections he didn’t before. And for some reason, it only works if it’s John.
“Err, right,” replies John. He’s confused but knows not to bother asking for an explanation. “Well, Madison Rice was a shy and nerdy teacher. Quiet. Pretty. On the shorter side and…average build? Yeah, I’d say average build. Didn’t seem that interested in fashion. In almost all the pictures I found she was wearing a t-shirt, jeans, and sneakers. Never any jewellery or makeup. Didn’t get much sun either, she always has pale pink skin no matter what time of year. Her hair was a nice colour, like a golden brown, and seemed pretty long. But she always wore it in a ponytail. So always casual, I guess. I suspect she didn’t go to many clubs.” John chuckles. “How’d I do?”
Next update will be Monday and I promise there will be lots more Sherlock-John interactions moving forward.
“She tripped!” Sherlock yells at TS, stopping and looking at the earth at his feet. “Here,” he points to a piece of bumpy, uneven ground once TS reaches him. “She must have been running back to the entrance. She was short enough that she could stand at full height in here, so was able to run at full speed.”
Sherlock looks back at Slater and cringes inwardly. “You go back to the station. I’ll head back in a cab in a bit. I might be able to jog Richard’s memory.”
Sherlock is still looking at the photo and thinking about how he’ll reply when John’s next message comes in.
“It makes me sad too, my sweet. I always miss you and your Daddy when I’m away,” Sherlock explains to the little girl who is avoiding his eyes.
Madison Rice came off as a young woman who was shy, but not isolated. Julie Fast was one connection, but she must have had other relationships. Given her interests, she must have had friends online. Sherlock suspects she was part of more than one large, active online community, but she seemed to want to keep her digital and non-digital lives separate. But on Monday, she was set to meeting someone from her online world in-person. Sherlock picks up his phone again and sees he has several messages from John.
Sherlock turns his attention to the staff member. “I need any photos or videos you have that might include pictures of this wall. Particularly the other side. I need to know when those screws were removed. We may have the perpetrator entering the tunnel on CCTV after all.”
Sherlock realizes he’s biting his lip again as he stares at his screen impatiently waiting for John’s reply.
Now, starstruck 1 is asking the manager some pointless questions and Sherlock is incredibly grateful to John for giving him a distraction. He pulls out his phone and sees several messages.
I have been to the Exeter underground passages...once...seven years ago. I did some research but for the most part the actual setup of the passages come entirely from my imagination. Apologies if my descriptions are incredibly far off reality.
The mobile buzzes with several incoming messages. Sherlock forces himself to wait a minute before picking it up. He can make John wait too.
John is right, of course. But it is just a terrible coincidence. Right? Had to be. Madison Rice going to the main (legal) entrance is predictable, but no one could have known that Lechance would be sleeping in the loo. Sherlock closes his eyes and puts down his phone. Considers getting some more of the korma. He should have saved some of the naan – it could have been breakfast. Breakfast! He opens his eyes and grabs his phone. Madison Rice was always supposed to enter through the official entrance at a time Riley Lechance would be absent.
John makes some surprised sounds before clearing his throat. “Umm. Okay. I can let you go if you want to…..go.”
“Right, ummm….Robson was saying you had eight no shows or cancellations on Monday? You’re the one who keeps track of that stuff then?” Sherlock asks, as he awkwardly plays with one of his cuffs.
Sherlock ends the call, sighs, and navigates to his texts. John has replied but he didn’t end up sending his instructions. Sherlock has pang of regret but is then grateful. Calming his arousal would have been made much more challenging if he’d seen a detailed description of exactly
I was nervous about posting this fic (particularly Chapter 6) but am happy with how it turned out. Thank you for seeing it through to the end. I really appreciate that there are people out there that take the time to read what I write :).
Holy hell. Sherlock jumps up from the chair and practically runs the few steps to the full-length mirror. He musses up his hair a bit more and takes a deep breath. There’s really only one thing he can do. Push things a bit further. Just a bit. And he doesn’t want to make John wait.
was not in the right place. I’ll tell you one thing, he certainly wasn’t thinking with his heart and he wasn’t just looking to share a damn bottle of wine! Fuck. Why were you so…not yourself to him? He deserved to be told off.  Pretty boy tall git with his stupid perfect hair.” Sherlock can’t help but smile. John has googled Slater.
. A frankly sentimental idea hits him. “John, I can tell you haven’t eaten lunch. We can go somewhere before going home. Maybe the Chinese on Baker Street.” He realizes the red on his cheeks is likely deepening. “You know the one we went to after Jeffrey Hope,” he adds quietly.
John will be waiting for a reply. Sherlock decides for partial honest and then deflection. He certainly can’t reveal that he spent the last few minutes pouring over every inch of the photo.
Sherlock finds himself smiling despite his initial anger at the interruption. He does love to solve a case. “Are you on your way?”
He looks in the peephole. Not Rich. “It looks like takeaway,” he explains. “Must be the wrong room.”
Silence fills the room again. This time it’s John who breaks it. “Sherlock, you don’t have to leave first thing tomorrow. We could both take Rosie to school and then cab over to King’s Cross together. There is a train at 9:15 that would get you in before noon. You’d get to see Rosie in the morning and still have most of the day to solve this.” John has obviously decided that Rosie is the only reason Sherlock doesn’t want to leave London right now. Silly, oblivious John. But then John has always underestimated himself and his importance.
Colonel Fitzwilliam’s expression was grim. “No trace of either man. But, of course, if either or both of them survived the fall, we cannot rule out their having crossed the border. But it leaves Princess Charis in the most equivocal position. King James will surely have a mind to his niece’s protection. But come. They will be sending out companies of soldiers to search for
She returned to the parlour, to find that Bingley, with the greatest good nature in the world, had proposed a round game, and all her daughters were in boisterous spirits about it.
“I don’t care. When I received your message I had to come.” Miss Hooper’s lips were tight and Harriet sensed she was very close to tears. Automatically, she reached into the recesses of her own cloak and pulled out her flask, holding it out to the younger woman.
An expression of distress crossed those doughy features. “My child; forgive me. I did not see you there.”
For the first time in her life, Elizabeth found herself equally unhappy with both parents. Bound by ties of honour to reveal nothing of what Mr Darcy had vouchsafed concerning his sister Georgiana, she could only point to Lydia’s general boisterousness and the shame it reflected on the family, as reasons to prevent the Lake Elderno expedition. She marshalled her best arguments to this effect and her father laughed at all of them.
That recollection did her good. It allowed her to say, with tolerable composure, “I had not thought you would have met the Princess.”
"Uncle, please. Don’t even try to pretend gossip is strictly for women. If you need to control that Council session, gossip is your friend.
Julian recovers. “Indeed. And for ‘I desire a covert assignation’, what better than Love-in-a-mist?”
Of course she knew the advantages and defects of every house of credit in the district, from the badness of the attics at Purvis Lodge to the inconvenient way the chimneys at Haye-Park smoked when there was anything of west in the winter wind. What else was there to discuss over the tea-cups or the madeira glasses? (More often madeira these days, or even brandy: there really was
Dammit. Wickham was the brazen seducer of Clarence Duplessis’ youngest daughter. Admittedly, it was far from the hardest seduction he had brought off in his disreputable career but that was
The more they were forced into company, the more the warnings she had received weighed on Elizabeth’s mind. Every time Wickham addressed a conventional gallantry to her, she wondered if it was one he had used to Georgiana Darcy. When, with flattering deference to his host, he invited her father to opine upon the chances of peace or war with Gaaldine, she imagined crabbed reports in cipher travelling up to some spymaster in Gondal Town. Each enquiry as to how she had found her sojourn with her cousin Collins, she suspected a sally to elicit intelligence about the doings of Miss Hooper or of her formidable guardian.
So much she had to tell, and so much to conceal, and so little time for her to sort out in her own mind which was which, and to order her thoughts accordingly.
“Truly, it was those memories that resolved me that I should require none of the girls to torment themselves – or others – with music, unless they truly had a taste for it.”
Darcy raised his eyebrows. “You’ve been away on the north-western marches too long. Did news of Sir Ronald Traquair’s marriage to Lady Agnes Campbell not reach you there?”
“You speak the purest infamy. A man who would countenance such an act would not be God’s anointed. The whole of Christendom would set their face against the realm he ruled. But that makes spreading such a lie of the greatest advantage to Gaaldine. Either way, one has a gross falsehood, a
“I lived in Gaaldine for a year and a half, some time ago. A magical experience. I think of it daily, especially of late. I grieve that, as nations, we are edging closer to catastrophe.”
. Distant, at that. And in any event –” She sighed. ”Surely you, of all men, know that the greatest dangers can come from within one’s own family?"
said it must be ready, and so it will. He does not brook delay, if it can be avoided. In anything. Do you think it would be most terribly improper were we to wander off together when we land, into the shade of these delightful coppices I see along the riverbanks? It has been an age since I have had a chance to have a proper talk with you.”
“Let us indeed talk of ransom. But I am afraid that you have mistaken the direction of the transaction. It is I who must be redeemed, and in a coin which does not tarnish, and, while infinitely precious, is also infinitely renewable. In short, I desire that you will hear my confession.”
“People commonly seek the company of their family at times such as these.” Colonel Fitzwilliam did not quite make it a question.
Darcy himself, of course. And Georgiana, eleven years old and goggling at her former playmate Julian as if at a stranger.
He and his half-troop, diminished to a scant dozen by defections, had been trying to clear the landslip on the East Road. That part he recalled clearly. Out of nowhere, it seemed, a screaming onslaught of bandits had risen up from the undergrowth. Most of his men had been stripped to their undershirts, holding spades and shovels rather than muskets. What could they have done? What could any of them have done?
Sherlock looks down at his phone deciding who to contact first. He knows that John would tell him to call Robson so her whole team can use this new intel ASAP. Sherlock smiles when he instead opens his texts and starts typing. If he were here, John would be the first to hear Sherlock had gotten a name. In person or not, John comes first.
Sherlock smiles down at his screen but schools his feature back into a scowl when he realises the sergeant is watching him. He types out his replies,
He talks to Robson for over 20 minutes although not much information of use is exchanged. Julie Fast has confirmed what they already knew. Madison Rice had a pen pal that she met at an in-person meet up of her ghost stories message board. She was quite taken with him but kept details to herself. Apparently, she didn’t want to “jinx it.” That didn’t work out so well. She referred to him as “K” and she was the one to suggest writing old-fashioned letters in lieu of email or text. Other than a few posts on the message board (Julie Fast didn’t know his username), the pen pals had only ever communicated by letter. The communication between Julie Fast and her friend had been limited while Julie was in Australia, and she didn’t know that Madison was meeting K in person. The only new piece of information gleaned from Robson’s interview was that that K didn’t grow up in Exeter but has lived in the city for “several years.”
be open and shut, in which case he could make it back the same day. But if that were the case, it was hardly worth the train trip. If the case was actually interesting, he’d be gone for at least one night.
Sherlock’s phone starts vibrating. John isn’t bothering to text and has just gone ahead and facetimed. Brilliant John.
“Right. Thank you, Sherlock. Good luck in Exeter.” Lestrade turns to John and nods. “Thanks for the tea, John.”
Sherlock is vibrating with nervous energy on the train back to London. Both legs are bouncing, and he is tapping the fingers of his left hand on the arm rest. The woman across from him (widow, two cats, boring) is glaring at him, annoyed at the constant motion.
Having vanquished the imaginary Mycroft, Sherlock pulls out his phone and types a quick message to John. They’ve been in text contact all evening (updates about the case) and John should be expecting the message.
Sherlock doesn’t care if people understand how he reaches his conclusions and he only bothers explaining if they doubt him. Except when it’s John. He needs John to understand how he put the pieces together. How clever he is. But right now, he also needs to call Robson to tell her where the police need to look. Only one solution. Sherlock opens his voice memo and quickly explains his deductions and the conclusions he’s reached. He sends the memo to John and then adds a couple of texts.
tonight. It would mean no talking to Rosie at all today. And maybe no talking to John. And Sherlock needed to talk to both before he exploded. Sherlock can almost hear Mycroft scoffing and reminding him that sentiment is a weakness.
John looks at Sherlock sheepishly from the doorway. “I told Rosie you’d be away tonight and maybe tomorrow morning. Even if you come back tonight, it’ll be after her bedtime.” John pauses before his expression changes to one of annoyance. “You slept on the sofa? Sherlock, your neck is going to be sore all day. And the train won’t help.”
at the Christmas party. “You’ve been bored. I thought you’d be itching to get on a train and check it out.” John continues as he pulls down the mugs and tea bags.
Sherlock audibly scoffs and John doesn’t supress his growing smile. Damn it, John! He knows exactly the right questions to ask to get Sherlock invested.
“We might as well take the tube home,” John says, as if on cue. “At this time of day it won’t be packed and should only take us an extra 15 minutes or so.”
The phone call with the chief inspector is mercifully brief and it takes all Sherlock’s energy not to look at any of the texts that arrive while he’s talking. Sherlock doesn’t bother explaining his reasoning to Robson, he just tells her where to look. The police need to look at the siblings of the temporary underground passage staff, children of any of the permanent staff, and any of the non-staff who have attended the weekly parties. Sherlock is to be informed of anyone who is between the ages of 18-30 and named Kyle.
Kyle Fletcher cries all the way to the station and doesn’t calm until he is in the interrogation room. He confesses everything shortly thereafter. His sister has called a lawyer, but Fletcher doesn’t want to wait to clear his conscience.
the taste of something gamy on my tongue.” He then shoots his eyes up to meet Slater’s gaze briefly before looking away demurely. God that was terrible.
Sherlock is frozen as he tries to process what he just heard. The look of confusion on his face has been replaced by one more akin to uncertainty. John takes pity on him and switches direction, walking back with a shy smile. Once he’s close enough, John reaches out and takes Sherlock’s right hand in his left, intertwining their fingers and gently running his thumb over Sherlock’s index finger. He then gently pulls him forward.
“Madison Rice is the Mayor’s daughter. Good chance it’s a coincidence, but security has been increased in the city. The police have managed to keep the story out of the media, but they are going to make a statement tonight and then it’ll be bananas. Mayor’s daughter stabbed to death in the city’s underground passages by a ghost assailant. They need to get this wrapped up soon before all hell breaks loose.”
“Goodnight, Watson,” replies Sherlock before he disconnects the call. He holds his phone to his chest for a moment, letting the sentimentality wash over him. He then gets up with a sigh and moves to the small table to get back to work.
The manager had also immediately handed over a list of all passage staff that had access to the passages in the past month. It’s includes fourteen names. Eight of them, including Riley Lechance, are marked with a “T”, indicating they are temporary summer staff. Unfortunately, the construction supervisor did not have a list. When pressed, he admitted that between construction workers, suppliers, and delivery people there had likely been several dozen people in the passages in the last month. And the only names he has recorded are the construction workers. Robson had sighed and asked him to send over the list as soon as possible.
Sherlock claps his hands together. The pieces that previously troubled him are starting to make sense. Madison Rice on the CCTV was a small risk. If the date had gone as planned, no one would have ever seen the footage. But even if they did, no one who might see the footage would recognize the victim. But Kyle, whoever he was, couldn’t walk through the front door. He didn’t want to be risk being on the CCTV. Because he would be recognized.
Unlike yesterday, today John is smiling broadly. His eyes are sparkling and bright. His hair is tousled. He looks exhausted but happy. He’s radiant and Sherlock finds himself smiling at the screen as he zooms in on different features.
Fletcher stares at the table as he continues. “I thought it was going okay. God it was supposed to perfect. I was so chuffed she agreed to meet me. It was going to be a perfect day. Ghost stories and fooling around in the passages and then lunch and then who knows. I was excited. I have had a couple girlfriends before but nothing in a while and I thought me and Maddy already really knew each other, you know? But I guess she didn’t think so. We talked for a bit and I thought it was going well and maybe I got a bit…aggressive. Maybe a bit more than I should have. She looked really good. Like she dressed up to meet me, I could tell. I thought she was just playing coy, you know? Like girls do.”
It’s also apparent the team is under enormous pressure. It looks like no one has slept and Sherlock has been at HQ for just under half an hour and the CI has already gotten a call from the mayor’s team asking for an update. Of which she had none to give.
It had taken Sherlock all of five minutes to establish that the victim being the Mayor’s daughter was entirely coincidental. Of course, that means it would take the media approximately five months to come to the same conclusion. After reviewing the summary of what the police found on the vic’s phone again, Sherlock types his replies,
“Madison Rice and her murderer met here for a date to go ghost hunting. You lot,” Sherlock points to the sergeants, “should look for any local groups with an interest in ghost stories. See if there is any overlap with the passage staff or construction crew.” It’s unlikely, but Sherlock would rather question Madison Rice’s roommate (his next stop this morning) with only Robson in tow.
Sherlock stares. That could be good. Very good. It’s probably good? Or it could be bad. John could be concerned he’s led Sherlock on and is worried he has to have an awkward conversation. Sherlock needs more data. Once again, he doesn’t need to wait long. His phone vibrates three times.
There is a moment of silence before Sherlock speaks. “Lestrade, you trust this Robson? You believe her that they have their sites set on the right suspect?”
“Sherlock, your neck is still sore, isn’t it?” John doesn’t wait for an answering before standing up and moving the coffee table. “Alright, to the floor with both of you. Back against the sofa, Sherlock. Rosie you can stay in Sherlock’s lap.” John pushes Sherlock gently, encouraging him forward.
John’s look of admiration morphs into confusion as he notices the relaxing of Sherlock’s hand.  But he doesn’t pull away. Sherlock subtly tilts his head towards the women and John’s eyes go soft, a look of sadness now schooling his features. He then grips Sherlock’s hand tighter. “Is this still okay, Sherlock?”
“I do like interacting with customers. Greeting them, seating them time permitting. I really enjoy taking control of the phone – taking reservations and answering questions. I obviously can’t do it all the time, but I try. It’s a personal touch you don’t get most places. I like to maintain a relationship with my customers. It’s cliché, but without them I wouldn’t be a success.” Slater pauses and his gaze sweeps up and down Sherlock’s torso before he adds, “But talking to tall, dark and handsome strangers at the bar
After a glorious ten minutes, John stops the massage and removes his hands from Sherlock’s shoulders. In the process he gently runs the fingers of his left hand through the hair on Sherlock’s nape. The feeling is incredible and, this time, Sherlock can’t fully suppress the shiver – he definitely felt that in his toes (among other places). He wants nothing more than to melt into a puddle on the floor.
“Charlie…errr…Chief Inspector Robson called me to say she still hadn’t heard from you or John. I thought this case would be right up your alley, Sherlock. Why not go take a look? Robson is a good cop…course you probably won’t like her, but I don’t think she’ll drive you up the wall. And she’ll let you do your thing. No ego there, just wants to solve cases.” Lestrade lets out a tiny chuckle. “I know it’s the Exeter police, but Robson is good. Good person and a good copper. Was on her way up through the ranks here in London before she moved. She and her husband both have ageing parents in Exeter who were starting to need a bit of care, so they moved west. We’ve kept in touch.”
John is lying on the sofa, head on the arm nearest the door. The angle of the photo tells Sherlock that John is holding his mobile above his head with this left hand, and he’s managed to capture his whole torso and head in the frame. Once again, he is looking directly at the camera and his hair is even messier than before. As delightful as that is, it’s not what grabs Sherlock’s attention. John’s white t-shirt is too short and lying on the couch would certainly cause it to ride up. With the position John is in, Sherlock would expect the shirt to rest partway up the navel. But, in this photo, it’s much higher. John’s right hand – which rests halfway up his sternum – is holding his shirt up. John’s full stomach and part of his chest (including a small portion of his scar) is visible. His chest and stomach are free of hair except for a trail from his navel down into his trousers. It’s a gorgeous shot.
. He knew there was something he’d have forgotten, something a proper officer would have thought of. "I suppose I was unconscious when they’d normally have asked and then it got overlooked –”
accept on Lizzie’s behalf: to do otherwise would be to put ourselves in open enmity. He may be waiting for such a thing.”
The chambermaid managed, with a great deal of dumb show, and a few essays into very slow, very loud Gondalian, to bring Frances hot water and towels and unlace her bodice. Frances, using gesture and excitable exclamations in French and Italian, managed in turn to explain that she required no further attention for now and that after she had washed away the dust of her non-existent journey, she proposed to lie on the bed with slices of cucumber over her eyes, awaiting her lover’s return.
The Crown Prince extended his hand. “For the moment, then, I should take that.” He gestured, and Molly realised she was still holding the belt buckle.
Confronted by this overt emotion, Charlotte seemed frozen into her seat. Elizabeth reached out across the carriage and caught Miss Hooper’s wrist, feeling the racing pulse beneath her fingers like a trapped bird.
“Enough. I must take that convoy, if it contains the entire college of cardinals and his Holiness the Pope at their head.”
With her last gulp of wine, she swallowed any desire to ask those questions. Any answers Jonathan might give would be ones for which she was by no means prepared.
"Miss Hooper started to win; not spectacularly, but steadily. When we broke for supper, I think she must have won back half of what she had lost on the previous occasion –”
Altogether, the walk was so agreeable that they were on the final descent to the port, the water sparkling in the bay below them, almost before Charlotte realised it.
Darcy was famously reticent about private matters. Charles nodded, wordlessly. Then, feeling more was required, he extended his hand and gripped Darcy’s wrist.
But what of Charlotte herself? She had neither pride nor inbuilt virtue protecting her honour, just the cold pragmatism of knowing that it would not answer. Not for a plain woman well past her first flush of youth with an ineffectual father and no connections of credit. One only had to recall what happened to Miss Bates with her “merchant sea captain” who turned out to be merely a master’s mate, and married already, to boot.
“As a true son of the Borders, the Pretender seeks to use John’s kin against him. Not wittingly: the Watson family are loyal to a fault. No doubt that is why they function so much better when separated each from the other. So much high-mindedness is bound to cause friction at close quarters. You need not tell him I said as much.”
had been the official justification for granting the privilege of private execution to the nobility and gentry. Darcy felt momentarily ashamed that the first time he truly feared the rule might have personal application was also the first time it had occurred to him that it prevented the world at large from knowing whether the condemned went to their deaths able to walk or not.
tradition. We sent out messages to your father, you know, when we learnt the Pretender was moving against him, information we had courtesy of a merchant who is far shrewder than the common run, by way of his niece, who sees, recounts, but does not observe: of all creatures, the most valued to an intelligencer. We offered him Gaaldine’s support, but he refused. Are you going to make the same choice and let your line be extinguished? Or are you going to avenge your father and brother?”
of aunts. The sister in question, Lady Elaine, was the Pretender’s mother.” After a moment, he added, “Another sister, Lady Anne, was the mother of the second girl. I do not readily believe in coincidences.”
Peter Brenzaida gritted his teeth and, taking a rough steer by the sun, headed south-westwards across the high moors.
Internally, Darcy dismissed as preposterous the notion that the envelope had lain tucked among those cushions for weeks. So many successive dew-drenched mornings would have caused the ink to run; besides, there had been at least two violent thunderstorms that he could recall. Insects, birds, snails should have –
That brought a glimmer of a smile to Lady Agnes’ lips. “I daren’t comment. Yes, your grace, Miss Hooper lost heavily on the first night. She lost all the ready money she had on her, continued playing in an effort to win it back, continued losing and then gave Lady Abruzzi her promissory note for the remainder of her debt. Given – given who she is, your grace. Lady Abruzzi had no hesitation in accepting.”
“And so they are. Rogues and plunderers to a man. But if rumour says true, we’ve got the greatest thief all in the next room. So if you want to learn a few tricks to beat their shenanigans, after you, Quarter-Mistress, ma’am.”
They ambled along the main street, their horses on a loose rein. Charles felt his heart lurch within him and a second later identified the cause. The fair-haired girl standing amid a group of women talking to one of the officers was indeed his own angel, not merely someone bearing an uncanny resemblance. He spurred his horse forward, hoping that something could be contrived from the formalities of neighbourly civility: perhaps an invitation to the ladies to take tea at Netherfield, if Caroline could be cajoled into doing the honours.
There was something in Mycroft’s expression that she had come to recognise. Bodyguards. And so, one or more potential spies within earshot. She suffered herself to be led indoors.
His sister made an airy gesture. “No-one expects men to have any taste when it comes to composing interiors. That is why, when one has the pleasure of seeing somewhere like this – so neat, so complete, so exquisite – surprise makes one’s pleasure all the greater.”
Toiling up the steep slopes of Belmont took it out of one: it always had, even when she’d been younger than Lizzie and at least as much in the habit of exercise.
She returned a wobbly smile and, once the signal was given, headed upstairs two paces behind the Countess to the dressing chambers.
“Quite so.” Darcy inclined his head slightly. “Charles is too open in temperament, too willing to see the good in everyone, too slow to look for meanings under words ever to make a courtier, even in ordinary times. But love is blind, even sisterly love. Doubtless she will force him to find an estate within easy distance of the capital and there they will entertain. Like leaving a baby unattended in the mountains, hoping to will wolves out of existence.”
He had expected Caroline’s flash of anger at the epithet, but not his hostess’s sly, half-hidden grin at marking it. Mr Perry drew closer to the bedside, fussily rolling up his sleeves.
Four generations of Darcy brides had included bog asphodel in their bouquets. The Malham arms had featured a pomegranate since the first Duke returned from crusading in the Iberian Peninsula, a passionate, dark-eyed daughter of Granada on his arm.
The giant let out an impressed whistle. “My friend was right, milady. You are, indeed, so much more than I could have expected. Well, girl, are you going to obey your mistress?”
With shaking hands, he calls John, who answers after one ring. John respects Sherlock’s request and stays silent, but his breathing is still heavy, and Sherlock can feel his arousal returning. He will have to be very quick.
Sherlock’s phone stays silent. He sighs and sets down his mobile and opens the background notes on Madison Rice. After a few minutes, however, the phone vibrates on the table.
Luckily, she is now rambling about all things she is going to do when the three of them (John, Sherlock, and Rosie) go on vacation to Exeter. No need to actively listen. It seems she has decided they’ll need to go for at least a long weekend and that the summer would be ideal. John seems to be agreeing with her.
Sherlock replies quickly and moves to the loo. He needs a cold shower, even if it’s only for a couple of minutes.
Mrs Gardiner pursed her lips. “Hush, Lizzie. However true that observation may be, it is one better not made aloud. Not when it concerns the King’s cousin. In any event, it is not entirely that loss which lies against Mr Wickham when one considers him as a husband. His current profession, dashing as it may seem, is not one I would like to see any young friend marry into, especially not at the present time. It is almost a certainty we shall have war during the coming year, perhaps before summer is out.”
falsehood and between the King and the Prince of Gaaldine but so much of truth as to make one honest man. But with which of them does it lie?”
Both men were gone, and the firefighters only just now turning away from the blaze to take in what had happened.
He grinned. “That’s high politics for you, ma’am. But I’ll not dwell on it, ma’am, if it offends you. Still, what I think, so might others.”
“Forgive me, my dear: I should not have snapped. It has been an uneasy time in Gondal Town since the old King’s death. Each day that passes brings fresh rumours, none of them good. The old guard at Court are in rout. Those who have replaced them test the limits of their new powers and find (at least, while they enjoy the King’s favour) that for them limits do not exist.”
With enormous effort, Frances and Jonathan avoided looking at each other. Neither of them doubted that the Crown Prince could do anything he set his mind to and he was no doubt making his way through the Borders with the loot, even now. But they would each have preferred certainty on the point.
Once inside the villa’s extensive gardens, Jonathan pulled Frances off the path into the shade of a cedar tree.
So the King had been forced by the loss of his chosen men to look to the preceding generation. Prince Gerald’s late adherents, those used to covering up dirty business – for a price – could not have been cheap to purchase. Those payments would have been demanded not just in money but in position.
Sherlock continues to ignore whatever the sergeant is saying and holds his phone in his hands willing for it to vibrate. He doesn’t have to wait long.
“I walked over and looked at her. She was just laying there on the ground not moving. At all. I could see her breathing but knew she needed help. But then I got thinking about what would happen if I called for help. Like if they found me down there with her. I was trespassing and she got hurt. When she woke up, Maddy might say I tried to…do things to her and she didn’t want to.” Sherlock wants to point out that that is, in fact, exactly what happened. “I am almost done school. In my last year. Then I planned on moving to London. I just. It’d all be over.”
The public lecture would not have been such a dead-end had there been any sort of registration system. Or pictures posted. But the lecture had been free, and registration wasn’t required. The digital team had searched for pictures of attendees but had come up empty handed. They had found several tweets and had tracked down the account holders, but none knew Madison Rice (or a Kyle) or remembered seeing her there (although a few recognized the username). Dead end.
“I know,” says Rosie, resigned, kicking the bag one last time. “The police couldn’t find their own reflection in a mirror.” John sighs audibly and Sherlock does his best to stifle a laugh. He really must be a bit more careful about what he says in front of the clever little girl.
The messages provide no clues as to John’s line of thinking. As a result, Sherlock doesn’t know what to expect when he and John are reunited. How does John view their exchange last night? Is he pleased? Embarrassed? Thrilled? Confused?
Of course! Sherlock looks through the file and is pleased to note that a semi-competent officer included the browser history. It is all innocuous, exactly the type of things John would search. The weather forecast, the hours of the local tesco, a bus schedule. But on Sunday there is also a search for The Botanist Exeter. Sherlock types it into his browser and the website for a poncy restaurant is the first hit.
Sherlock uses all his strength to suppress a shudder. His shoulders and neck are on fire in the best possible way. John’s touch has always had a profound effect on him, and this is sensory overload. Contrary to John’s decree, Sherlock thinks he might start sleeping on the sofa more often if this is the result. He closes his eyes and focuses on the touch, cataloguing both the feeling and his body’s reaction (why can he feel this in his toes?). After a minute he realises that Rosie is still talking, and he probably should be listening.
Slater is already hooked. He smiles broadly at Sherlock. “I have no doubt I have something you’ll enjoy, Mr. Holmes. What can I get you?”
Suddenly, the momentous nature of what just happened hits and Sherlock finds himself grinning broadly. He wants to shout from the rooftops. He wants to
. Sherlock is still pacing when the photo arrives a couple minutes later. He stops to open it and immediately drops into the nearest seat, which happens to be the armchair. He stares, mouth agape at the image before him.
John obviously didn’t spend much time re-styling his hair after his post-workout shower (a run, Sherlock decides). He did use hair product (the one that makes his hair smell like citrus and vanilla) but didn’t take the time to make sure every hair was in place. It’s just a little disheveled and looks fantastic. Sherlock takes the time to look at all the different shades atop John’s head. There are stands of gold, brown, blond, and, of course, white.
“Wait, Sherlock,” yells John. Sherlock stops and turns to see John walking over to meet him while shaking his head and smiling. “You dressed quickly this morning.”
“That’s enough Mr. Lechance.” Sherlock turns his attention to Robson who looks back at him, confused. “Are you kidding me with this?” Sherlock says, waving his arm at the suspect. He puts his head in his hands for a moment before speaking again. “I’ll be back in a moment.” With that, he exits the tiny room, leaving four perplexed people in his wake.
Sherlock swirls it in the glass and licks his lips as he stares at the colour. “What can I expect to taste?”
at any time of day, but alone is preferential to anyone else. “If it’s solved as quickly as everyone thinks, I will call Rosie from the train.”
No response after one minute. Then two minutes. Sherlock begins pacing again. Should he send something else? Three minutes. Four. Damn it, he went to far. He needs to give John another out.
“Her intense privacy is proving to be an issue. As is her social anxiety. Madison Rice didn’t open up easily and kept her hobbies, which she perceived as abnormal, under wraps. Her cellphone was paid for by her parents and I suspect they felt a certain entitlement to view it. Which explains why there is almost nothing on it. Certainly nothing about a meeting with a potential beau in either her texts or email. There are few photos on the phone but nothing that provide any insight. Almost all the texts and outgoing calls are to her family or her best friend, Julie Fast. There is an occasional note to colleagues at work or her roommate, but the tone makes it clear that Ms. Rice wasn’t close with them.” Sherlock is on a roll now. “If anyone knew about Ms. Rice’s date, it would be Ms. Fast. Unfortunately, they have had limited contact lately, so it is unlikely. Ms. Fast has been on an extended vacation in Australia. She was camping this weekend and her parents only got a hold of her late today. She’s on a flight home now.” Sherlock stops to take a breath. “Based on the knife, Ms. Rice met her murderer through something considered nerdy, confirmed by the interests you’ve identified so far. I am almost certain she met him online. You can stop looking at dating sites. You said she used to be interested in Dungeons and Dragons. Did you find any other interests?”
“Duty call.” He downs the rest of the wine (it really is lovely) and goes for his wallet, knowing full well he won’t need it. “How much do I owe you?”
Sherlock’s focus moves to John’s eyes. Beyond the smile lines on the sides, the eyes themselves are clearly smiling. Bright and open. John’s eye colour is different depending on angle and lighting, and in this photo they look like deep pools of dark blue water. Breathtaking.
“Is that so?’ asks John with a mischievous grin that Sherlock can’t read.  After a pause, the grin fades. “Hmm, right,” he adds with a huff, almost to himself. “Right,” he says again, more loudly, looking directly at Sherlock. The grin returns. “Right. Not today.”
John sounds like he’s gritting his teeth. “No, Sherlock. You weren’t foolish, he’s bang out of order. Telling him your hotel in no way gives him permission to invite himself over. And that clerk could be fired for giving him your room number. You shouldn’t open that door.” John’s anger is apparent and grows with each word.
“You have to eat everyday, Sherlock. Here.” John hands over a small paper bag covered in familiar blue cursive. “They were just out of the oven when I got there. I got you the biggest one.”
A minute later the door opens to reveal Kyle Fletcher, looking like a wreck. He makes eye contact with his sister and breaks down in tears.
Sherlock’s breath hitches and he shakily types of a response. Before he finishes, however, another message comes in.
Both men have stopped and standing almost side by side. Sherlock furrows his brow looking towards John. “I admit you have now confused me, John, if that was your goal.”
Sherlock’s hand strokes his phone in his pocket. He’s itching to text John to tell him about the upcoming interrogation and the general incompetence in the room. But John would simply reply that Sherlock should be focusing on the case. And he’d be right. Best get away from these fools and get to work.
Sherlock takes this as an invitation to call (he does prefer to text but longs to hear John’s voice again). A voice call this time as Sherlock is sure that John will be busy cleaning up the kitchen. John picks up after the second ring.
“Well, apparently there is only one man who could have done it. Name’s Riley Lechance, 22. Like I said, there is no way in except the front entrance to the passages. He was the one staff member working that morning. There are two close circuit camera setups at the passageways, one on the front door and one inside at the entrance of the passageways themselves. The CCTV on the front door confirms that only Lechance and the vic entered the store front. No one else was there. Lechance claims he didn’t see or hear the vic or heard her – says she must have broken in when he was in the loo. It’s true that he doesn’t appear on the CCTV of the entrance to the passageways themselves, but I suppose he might know how to avoid being seen.”  Lestrade runs his fingers through his hair. “And apparently Lechance was real shifty during their interviews so far. He’s keeping his story consistent, but it’s full of holes. Doesn’t remember when he got into work or if he saw anyone else there that morning. Robson says they’d suspect him even if he wasn’t the only one who had access and opportunity. But they don’t have anything they can use to arrest him or even get a warrant to search his place. And so far they haven’t found a connection between Rice and Lechance, but they are looking. Oh and the kid has had some trouble with the law in the past, has a couple of CBOs.”
Sherlock sighs as he waits. The review of the photos and video has only added to the sinking feeling he’s had since he first entered the station. Sherlock is becoming increasingly certain that Robson’s belief that Riley Lechance is the murderer has more to do with hope than actual evidence or police intuition.
Sherlock doesn’t care about credit and says as much. “I know the media are aware I am here, but I’d prefer if my role in the resolution of this case is minimized. You and your team are free to take credit. I won’t be answering any questions.” He pauses before adding, “John may choose to put this on the blog, but that is entirely up to him. For now, I just want to go home.” Although John had not been with him in Exeter, Sherlock suspects this case will end up being written up and posted on the blog. Quickly. Partially because it is an interesting case and partially because John will want to make it very clear to a certain restaurant owner that any perceived flirtation was a ruse to get information. Against his best effort, Sherlock smiles at the thought.
John washes the dishes (quite loudly in Sherlock’s opinion) as Sherlock walks through everything that happened since he first entered the Devon and Cornwall police station. For the first 10 minutes there is a lot of complaining about the local police which leads to a lot of sighing by John. Eventually they get through Sherlock’s review of the CCTV, the interview with Riley Lechance, his walk through the crime scene, removal of the wall, and discovery of the murder weapon.
The phone rings again. John is still typing. God, it is probably going to be incredibly detailed and filthy and incredible. Sherlock sighs and quickly types a message to send to John before answering the phone.
Sherlock chuckles. He knew that his flirtation with the evidence clerk was obvious. He did not know that John had picked up on his fashion choices.
Over the course of his life, home has not been a constant for Sherlock. Moreover, home hasn’t always been a
Sherlock has always been more of a homebody than most people suspect. He longs for the comfort of home and, if he is away too long, he grows untethered and lost. Sherlock had only narrowly survived two years underground after the Fall, but it had been that prolonged distance from home, not the beatings and torture, that had almost broken him. And, maddeningly, as he ages, the importance of home only grows.
murder weapon. That is definitely the knife that killed Madison Rice,” explains Sherlock, trying to suppress a smile. He much prefers working with Robson when she is annoyed. “But that’s not a knife you’d pick if you were intending to kill someone. That’s a knife you’d bring to
It worked, however, as Slater inhales audibly, leans forward, and breaks out in a slightly predatory grin. Sherlock takes a small drink, making sure to exaggerate his swallow. “That’s wonderful. It seems you know exactly what I need, Rich.”
He puts down the phone and stands up. Two nights in a row is too much. But the picture from yesterday had been like a balm and he wants that feeling again.  He doesn’t need to wait long to get his fix as a picture comes through (along with a message) about a minute later.
Madison Rice’s room is exactly how Sherlock pictured it. Bright, organized, and clean (she even made her bed before leaving) with lots of books. Mostly novels but some non-fiction as well, including many on pedagogy, early childhood education, and child psychology. Sherlock thinks of Rosie and feels a pang of regret that Exeter has lost someone who cared deeply about her vocation.
Robson quietly and professionally prompts Fletcher with questions to reveal the whole story. It’s exactly as Sherlock had thought. Kyle Fletcher met Madison Rice online on the ghost stories message board and then, by chance, in person at the lecture in London. Before that, they had no idea they both lived in Exeter. It had been Madison Rice’s idea to write letters and, over the last three months, they’d each mailed dozens of them. It was Kyle who suggested they meet in person again. After some apprehension, Madison Rice had agreed.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “She wasn’t pushed into the wall. She tripped and fell. It explains the height of the impact and why she didn’t have any bruising on her the back of her head. She fell and hit her head…hard. That part was an accident.”
“As much as I loathe repeating myself, I feel I should pre-empt you. I am not going to Exeter. I have commitments here.” Sherlock picks up the mug of tea John has left for him and moves to his chair.
“It doesn’t matter,” replies Sherlock, confused at the level of John’s anger. “Richard Slater, owner of The Botanist. He’s gone, John.”
“Oh yeah, I remembered his name because…well, my most recent ex is named Kyle. But let’s not talk about exes here,” Slater says with a wink.
“Yup, Richard Slater. Says he likes to know his customers. In the down time, like now, he tends the bar,” Robson explains as she opens the door.
Sherlock scoffs at the emoji and his fingers ghost over the keys. What to send now? This is an incredibly unsatisfying ending for both him and John. It can’t end like this. Sherlock must calm down, but John is in his bed and that’s not an opportunity to be missed. He types out a quick message and builds up his courage.
“The loo. I was sleeping the whole morning in the loo. Even missed dropping in on the breakfast. It’s always at the diner round the block,” Lechance says quietly. “I really didn’t see that woman come in. I didn’t hear anything…well nothing woke me up until my alarm at the end of shift. I went out front just before Olli came for the next shift. Cat, Robbie, and Fitz came to say hi too and I left with them.” The kid is slouching lower and lower in his chair and won’t look anyone in the eye.
“I hope that helps, even if I didn’t use lotion” John says quietly. Sherlock stays silent but gives a tiny nod. He’s not sure if John notices.
Thank you all so much for reading. I wasn't sure where to end this one, but thought I'd allow the imagination of the readers decide what happens when the boys got home ;).
Sherlock starts laughing. Despite the absence of a sultry look or anything below the belt, this photo is one of the most arousing things he’s ever seen. As if he could ignore it. Sherlock finds himself distracted looking at ever inch of John’s exposed skin and considering how he would explore it. Fingers first. Then lips. Then tongue. How would John react to stubble rubbing against that skin? Sherlock shakes his head. He needs to focus on the task at hand. Which is…what? Respond in a way that continues to push this forward without scaring John.  For all Sherlock knows, John is just testing limits. Having a bit of fun. If Sherlock comes on too strong, he could ruin it.
“No. He finished his shift and went home. It was the kid on the next shift who found her. Poor girl had been dead about between one and two hours. Not that there is anything anyone could have done. She was knocked out and then stabbed right in the heart.” Lestrade shakes his head.
“And most of the sightings take place in the first section of the passages, correct? The section closest to the entrance?” asks Sherlock, growing antsy.
Sherlock starts walking to the door, annoyed. It’s likely a member of Robson’s team, despite the fact he was clear they should text him if they needed to make contact. “John, I’ll just be a moment,” he says into the phone. Too loudly he realizes. He’s now given away that he’s in the room. Damn it! He could have just ignored whoever was on the other side.
