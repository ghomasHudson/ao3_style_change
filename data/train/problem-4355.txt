Sam stopped, straightening up with a frown. “That poor girl knocked a filling loose.” He rubbed his cheek as if a phantom pain flared.
“Drink up, Cas!” Dean plunked the bottom of his bottle on the lip of Castiel’s beer firmly, making it slowly but surely foam up.
When the goodbyes were done and said, Dean mouthed ‘Samuel’? to Sam and got a light punch to the arm.
Dropping his arm casually, Dean turned to face a tall man in his sixties He wasn’t stooped at all, bearing mostly grey hair and keen brown eyes. At least he didn’t look hostile.
He hadn’t realized how repetitive this all had become. Not to mention the number of people coming into confession had dwindled significantly from when he attended church as a boy. He wasn’t the only Father that had noticed there were no longer lines outside the booths.
Dean didn’t even look at the menu, he didn’t need no stinkin’ menu. “I’ll have a Pepsi and that huge ass burger for free.” He grinned cockily, they’d never seen anyone destroy meat the way he was about to.
Dean spent the rest of the morning changing out wires for Edith, though his questions about new people moving into town wasn’t successful. Of course Dean came along and everyone knew his business, but not a dad and a little boy.
He wove through the other teams, Team Casters and Magdalene and Sisters to get to the flock of white. But he stopped when he got within sight, looking at all the faces. Cas was easy enough to spot, but he was busy, wasn’t he? Maybe he didn’t want Dean there or at all.
“Oh! Well, I’ve been running things, building up our little community, but I’m not a leader. What we need is a leader.” Charlie looked up at him with bright eyes filled with hope and he felt like shit.
“Naw.” He just had two monster burgers with fried eggs on each in concession to it technically being breakfast. He would’ve paid more attention but they were sitting with two of the frat brothers. And the conversation was boring. Something about a competition. If it wasn’t volleyball with some sisters in shorty shorts, he wasn’t interested.
He did end up leaving with caffeine running through his veins and a few extra tools along with the flyers. It was still pretty early, which was perfect. He drove up to the side of town of the furniture store. Sam had sent an address already, cause that man was a genius. Or had easy access to store listings, whatever.
She gasped, turning bright cherry red. She looked at her boyfriend in a panic. “No, no, he’s just an ex, crazy ex..”
It was amazing to think their mother had managed to unstarch her bloomers long enough to get pregnant four times. Thinking about her mother having sex made Charlie want to drink bleach, so she tried to think of literally anything else.
Both made noises of polite assent, and Charlie's shoulder burned after with the imprint of being squeezed by her blood-red talons before they were alone again.
Bella shook her head, opening up her purse and digging through it. “Honey, that boy is everyone’s type. Broad shoulders, stunning green eyes, whew. If I weren't so happily married, I might’ve swooned.”
“This is Castiel. It’s pretty rare I see him anywhere but the library, so.” Sam grinned at his friend.
Dean really hadn’t thought of a reason, it usually worked to get people to start drinking every other time. “Um. How about to courage?” He looked pointedly at Sam, who looked confused. Dean took a swig and shook his head. What, did Sam need it spelled out in letters across the sky?
“Kay. You sound crazy. Maybe you should get out while I remember I’m a man of peace,” Dean said gruffly. He knew he was made, but if his dad taught him anything it was
“Hey, I’m going to bed. You gonna stay up?” Sam was stretching and yawning, even though it was early as shit.
He pulled up to a neat tiny real estate office sandwiched between a kitschy Ann’s Collectibles and a greasy Main Street Nook. When he climbed out of his car a redheaded woman burst out of the office waving at him. She had eyes as light green as his own and a radiant smile.
“I’m here for the monster burger.” Dean tells her as she goes, winking when she looks back over her shoulder.
Dean nearly jumped when that deep voice spoke so close to his ear. “I find myself concerned people are not pleased to see me.” Of course someone had brought Cas a seat and placed it right on his other side.
But he never stopped staring at Dean, even when one brave soul darted forward to slash at its cheek.
Her bottom lip buttoned up as she looked uncertain. Finally she looked down and away, mumbling, “This must be what the devil sounds like.”
Dean cleared his throat, realizing he was standing there daydreaming. “I just wanted to let him get sleep.”
He took a seat on the only sofa in the place, stretching out his legs and taking the bottle when Cas offered it to him.
he wanted to discuss further. Castiel frowned at him, but it didn’t seem to make much of an impression.
“You know.” Bradford said, a lot closer than he was a moment ago. Dean turned and eyed the three feet between them.
And as much as he racked his brain, Castiel could not place a face to this man with his husky voice.
“Okaaay.” He kept typing away though, clicking a couple of times on his mouse. “Cassie has an account on here.”
A quick phone call with Charlie confirmed theirs happened at ten. Dean walked back into his new living space with two receipts stuffed in his pocket and his trunk filled with boxes. He had to pick up certain items that didn’t exist twenty years ago though. He wasn't sure why he was so distracted by the priest. Maybe it was all that priest and nun porn. Some of those guys were pretty built under their cheap polyester robes.
“Get out or you’ll be sweet-talking my boots, Mayor McCheese.” Dean jiggled his work boot by the heel and jerked his thumb toward the door.
Okay, that was most definitely not tomato sauce. The strong taste of red chili peppers filled his mouth, potent and somehow inescapable as he took several gulps of his now empty glass. Some saint refilled it while he jotted down some numbers while Crowley and Conner wrote a goddamn essay. 7, 6, 4, 4, 8; 29.
Sam tried, and failed, to snag Gabe’s sleeve before he left. “Wait no, I don’t think--!” The door closed.
“I know. I invited my friend though, when I saw him at the library. He really liked the show, so I wanted to show you off. For once.” Sam was holding a glass of clear fizzy liquid and looking much too perky.
“Sorry,” Dean muttered to Benny as he tried to concentrate on practicing their first song of the night. It was
Father Novak tilted his head while observing him, long lashes framing his blue eyes that girls would kill for.
Rubbing against Cas’s hip again, he whispered. “Be glad I don’t dig a new hole in you to fuck.” He pushed a third finger in, but it didn’t get a reaction this time. Dean waited too long, he had to practically thrust all the way to the knuckles to get a shudder.
Cas nodded at her solemnly and picked up the fork and knife to carefully cut into the quadruple layered burger oozing with cheese.
He magnanimously offered to be one of the Judges for exposure so long as there were two other well-known people alongside him. She promised to drop off a stack for him if he wouldn’t mind helping to pass them out. Of course he didn’t and he knew the first place he was going to take the flyers.
“Wanna walk with me?” Words he couldn’t stop came tumbling out. “We can talk about more outings for you.”
“Yes. My dad used to do so as well, I learned at a very young age. Once I was older, I was helping my siblings whenever their car broke down or needed maintenance.”
Sam didn’t even look intrigued. Dean wasn’t into guys, but if he was, between that voice and that hair that looked like he just got rode hard and put up wet…
Edith gazed skyward with her lips pursed, see, old schoolmarm. “No. We just changed the lightbulbs.”
“A diocesan priest receives a salary. I am an Franciscan, so as parochial vicar in a ministry my intended salary is paid but not received by me.”
Castiel pinched the bridge of his nose, figuring that he should have known and this extended conversation was his fault. “I’m afraid I can’t give you Absolution.”
It was like an addiction, staring at the serious set of Cas’s mouth. But it was a very, very bad one, because if he looked so long he’d start imagining them doing a variety of other things.
The other man packed the food in two brown bags and took the crumpled twenty from Dean. He handed him back two dollars and change and said nothing when Dean picked up his bags and his beer.
Despite the muggy air outside, she was glad to be out of the house where nobody had been allowed to truly live.
As the song wound down Sam and the guy were standing next to each other, Blue Eyes stuck his hand on Sam’s arm and looked up to him.
Not that they were dating. Yeah she was far more attractive at this point than any other time with their clothes were on, but she
Sam stuck his head in the room as Dean came out while rubbing his head with a towel. “Hey, let’s go out to lunch.”
The rush of cool air blowing through the house felt great. It was way better than the crap air conditioning in her apartment. That tiny place was like the maw of a hellhound; terrifyingly hot and most likely dangerous.
As he was clicking around on her page he saw a new notification pop up. She was going to the Roadhouse tomorrow at 9 to see Purgatory. A huge grin split his mouth, she missed him!
“Now, the Judges will have final word on who wins the grand prize, but there will be also be winner for Spiciest, Most Colorful, Flavor, and more, so make sure you vote for your favorite! Each scorecard has five categories, please give each a score between 1 and 10.”
Cas nodded. “Very much so. I’ll still have more schooling, but that is fine. My family is coming up for graduation, at least my parents will.”
But isn’t that what he had been asking for in prayer? Someone who has turned to God outside of obedience, for this was definitely a grown man, and was searching for answers.
Dean made a sound in the back of his throat, vibrating through his lips. “I didn’t expect to see anyone else like me when we came here. And it’s okay if you don’t forgive me yet. You will.”
Bella smiled again, all gentle understanding. “Yes. You know, I was just asking Jo if she had met your brother. I think they would make such a cute couple.”
“You are the Righteous Man.” Castiel spoke seriously, his chin dipping low to stare directly at Dean.
A jingle greeted him as he pushed open the door and cool air rushed over him. The sun was nearly over the horizon but the mugginess lingered thickly in the air.
Yeah they talked on the phone every day, about stupid stuff and important stuff alike. Dean knew about cars and Cas knew friggin’ everything under the sun, so time flew when they were talking.
Even though he should’ve been expecting it, the warm brush of fingers against his sent a shock up his arm. As said though, nothing more was done than pet the back of his hand slowly.
. Look, what do you think I do when you’re not around? I get drunk after gigs, Sam. Grow up.” He looked away from the hurt look, feeling like he kicked a goddamn puppy. Sam came all the way down to watch him play, like a good brother, and Dean was just...just the worst.
I know it's holiday time and everyone is super busy, but don't forget to take a break and take care of yourself!
“He was helping me with the tools.” Dean pointed at the pile next to them like he was caught making out by his mom.
Cas nodded thoughtfully as he took a much longer drink of his bottle. “I think I’ll order us another round.”
Okay, it’d be a lie to say that it was kinda arousing watching Cas’s throat move as he took a gulp. He did cough shortly, blinking several times at the burn.
“Yes.” Dean reached out to grab the discarded clothing from other...victims, holding up the trenchcoat. It wasn’t much, but it would protect his blackened, rotting soul from the hottest flames hell had to offer.
The Wagon Bar was his type of joint. It had a jukebox and sawdust scattered along the floor. No peanuts, but it has a good Western feel to it. The music playing when they came in was on point, and Sam had stopped sending him weird looks.
Dean could only imagine a bald bureaucrat for God with a forty-year paunch and an eye for the pretty teenagers. A disgusted shudder ran through him. “I’ll pay you back for this. I promise you that with every fiber of my being.”
“Not for you, Edith.” Dean grinned, glancing again at Novak. Instead of looking perturbed though, the other man continued to simply exude acceptance.
Cas turned his head to look narrowly at him, the light above glinting off his eyes. “I know not to throw water on it."
“And some of us, like, I mean, not all of them are like that. You need to be careful who you get involved with, cause you never know who you’re overlooking!”
Dean turned slowly, as if seeing something just not understanding what it was. “Hey...hey man, is there like a pamphlet for this event? A, uhh, list, a schedule?”
People were acting like God had just come down and placed a hand on their head. Excited smiles and relief everywhere, people breaking off from the crowd to go to tables and spread what just happened. He wasn’t sure what they’d say, but it had to come off in his favor didn’t it?
“Oh yeah he does,” Dean ground out. How could Sam not notice the way the guy was scamming on him? He knew what it looked like, damnit. “Guys like that only want one thing. You need to go for someone who is quiet and nice and respects you.” He tried so hard not to glance at Cas.
“I am absolutely not worried.” Dean shook his head with an amused eye roll. He set up a time to meet at their, well, her church that evening to see what could be done about the plumbing.
“Yes. Normally you would tell me the last time you have confessed, but that will be done next time. But you can tell me what your sin was and how often it has happened. If you can’t remember the exact number, say several or many times over the number of years it happened. But in the future, be exact.”
“It was good seeing you, Cas. Hoping to see more of you later.” He winked, again making it as obvious as possible that he accepted the guy. That was important, the support of family.
“Naw, just, uh, I’m going to get changed. Hey man.” He lifted a hand to acknowledge Sam’s friend and stalked to the back. Pfft, he didn’t put himself on display when he was on the scam. His skill out there spoke for itself, drew all the honeys. Some of them, anyway.
“Father, why don’t you be an unofficial Judge?” One woman lingered near him, a huge old cross resting on her collarbone. “Of the chili, of course. I can bring you a bowl of each.” Her smile was a bit extra friendly, but subtle enough.
Lisa reached out for help after the police did their usual bang-up job and the case got passed around until Sammy got ahold of it. Sam never refused a mom. Dean never refused a hot mom.
“I am. I’m also here about a fun event going on this Saturday in Middlepoint Park. It’ll have stuff for kids. Have you lived here long?” He used his best patient voice he reserved for children.
What. Dean was going to find Sam and throttle him. He’ll do worse than throttle him, he’ll pick his giant body up, find a bridge, throw him off that bridge, fish him out and run him over. He belatedly smiled. “I mean, you said you’ve been open for a year?”
Dean meets a few more of the townsfolk and heads down to St. Michael the Archangel's Catholic Church.
On the drive to the event center, the very same one he went with Cas and Sam to, he thought about seeing Cassie again. Bet her dumb boyfriend was the only reason she was on that stupid team.
Percy or whatever was making big overblown gestures with his hands. “Then the claw flipped the other machine over, held it down, and violated it. It was a massacre, I thought Team No Loopholes was going to cry.”
Their little brother hadn’t cared either way. He never had to worry about family drama, he was the baby of the family. Stella’s second chance at a son.
He rounded the corner of the street and halted so fast he nearly pitched himself ass over feet. Two boys were yelling as they ran around a driveway, one younger and lagging behind. No end to his enthusiasm, though, as he tried to catch up with his ‘army buddy’.
“Have a seat if you want. A cup for you?” Gus didn’t sound awake yet, but he poured water into the clunky brewer and filled the top cup with ground beans without missing a beat.
Benny didn’t get there until after Dean was working on Sam to have a few beers. “It’s still early! You could stop around eight and be just fine. Plus, pizza.”
“Oh, I’ll definitely be needing one.” Dean felt pretty good about that. Whoever tagged an overnight guest first got dibs on privacy. Whoever was left had to hope the chick was up to taking a member of the band home, and they weren’t quite big enough to always pull that off. One day.
But Sam was shaking his head, still chuckling. “I don’t know if you’re going to remember this tomorrow, but you’re hilarious.”
He knew the important stuff though, like what made her squeal. Maybe he’d tell his little brother that next time it was brought up.
Dean held up a hand when Cas tried to hand it back. “Nope, the first person has to drink below the label. See, the neck is short, you’ll be fine.”
It was hard to tell in the lack of light, but Blue Eyes was watching him. Him, specifically, unwaveringly so. It sent a funny set of chills down his already tense arms.
“That’s up to you entirely. You may continue to be anonymous.” In fact, Castiel would prefer that right now. He didn’t want to know, he’d prefer to let his eye pass over whoever was in there.
The priest seemed to grow aware of the stares, gaze going from the crowd to Dean and the bottle. He set down his spoon of his barely touched chili and nodded. “Actually, the church does not condemn all imbibing of wine or other strong libations. Moderation is key, but I believe one or two bottles is acceptable.”
Sam looked like he didn’t want to hear another word, so Dean took a seat on the bed and continued. “I don’t want him to be exhausted the day of, you know?”
He was afraid to wipe his eyes in case a drop of food got on the back of his hands while he coughed. “To drink! I can’t feel my mouth move. Am I even talking? Can anyone hear me?”
Not that Dean expected him to. Cas was an actual holy man, one of the ones that weren’t even allowed to touch themselves, he was sure. But Cas showed no signs of embarrassment and won fair and square because Dean sat back first.
Castiel felt himself color up. Worse still, his fingers twitched when the cool air hit them, as if he were beckoning.
Father Raphael raised his eye to him again. “The people around here are very traditional. I’m afraid you won’t get very far here. Kansas City might be a more amenable location to different types of Ministry.” He spoke very matter-of-factly and plainly.
Cas pressed into him again, the feeling of the hot and silky skin over his cock making Dean gasp into his mouth. He quickly wrapped his fist around both of them, rubbing their cocks together. Never had Dean been so glad to be wrong, because when Cas tilted his head back and hoarsely groaned without holding back, Dean lost it and spurted hotly after one more thrust.
Charlie been puked, peed on, and even shit on one memorable occasion, she couldn’t imagine why nobody had broken out in song around her a la Miss America,
Dean completely ignored his phone the next day. He was busy piecing over what the hell happened the last few days. First he arrived. Sam talks to a strange guy. Guy arrives at show, Sam says he invited him. They go to lunch the next day, Cas shows up in an obvious not-coincidence.
Dean left one copy on the counter and sauntered to the board, grabbing an extra tack in the corner. He pinned it next to horseback riding lessons and a teenager by the name of Nicholas offering babysitting services.
“It’s a community event. You did say we wouldn’t be putting people on the spot or feeling like they had to be in attendance of our church to show up, remember?”
Even from half a mile out the town looked like a mix between modern and crumbling. He could see a chapel from all the way out, a pointy white proclamation to Jesus or whatever, and also a gas station that looked as if it had been laid to waste by the Vikings.
Sam only looked puzzled, reminding him that he hadn’t gotten to attend last year’s event because of the Principle thing.
The waitress came back with her pen and pad poised cutely, smiling at all three of them appreciatively. “So what’ll you be having to drink today?” Her southern tang was also cute, but Dean was busy scoping if the two lovebirds were holding hands under the table.
“Yeah, Thursdays and Mondays. Do you want to join? The more the merrier.” Sam said, the big oblivious giant.
“Didn’t think I’d catch you?” He pointed at her, swaying a little. “All those flirty texts you’ve been sending me saying you’d meet me on Friday and Saturday, and you’re fucking some other guy?”
“That’s good!” Dean slapped the mess of blood, the mush making a squelching sound beneath his palm. It kinda bothered him that this holy upstart had no reaction. Maybe his ministrations lacked finesse, but it never failed to get a reaction out of a normal soul.
Rebecca looked puzzled and Charles started to frown, but Dean only gestured them impatiently and walked confidently through the crowd until he reached Cas.
“I’ve never been more proud of myself than at this moment.” He whispered, licking a long line down Castiel’s neck. He manipulated the cock deftly, rubbing his palm down the top and adjusting him so it bobbed out between them.
Exactly at eight Sam began to openly check his watch. “I should get going soon.” Damnit, he was going to ruin all of Dean’s plans. Plan-ruiner! Obviously moving his egg’s from Sam-being-bold to Cas-making-a-move was great, but not if Sam just up and left.
It was impossible to imagine him biting into food larger than his mouth, sauce spilling over his chin and hands. Heck, he couldn't imagine Cas lying on a bed panting in abandon. But then he'd have to picture Sam in there and nope nope nope.
The rest of the morning was spent at the church, avoiding the whole pipe matter because it would take longer than a day. He didn’t want to leave any more unfinished projects than he already was, if need be.
Charlie squeaked and ran off without another word. There were titters and laughter around, and she returned immediately and plunked down three bottles. “I wasn’t sure what kind you might like, or any, are you okay?”
Charlie had a portable microphone and stood before the Judge’s table when the park was getting full. “Welcome to our first Lebanon Chili Cook-Off!”
“You’re in a kitchen, cooking bacon. You guys eat bacon, right? Okay, anyway, the heat is up, the pan is filling as the bacon curls and crisps. Smells great. You pop outside for a chat or a phone call, maybe have to run to the bathroom. You come back and flames are licking the inside of the pan. The bacon smell is replaced with black smoke pouring into the air, you’re choking on it. What do you do?”
“I think so.” Cas was giving him all his attention again, that sort of intensity that gave him goosebumps down his arms. “If I’m not to write a clue on my chest, how should I go about this?”
It was a large parish for a relatively middling-sized town on the outskirts of the city. It was just as much community as worship that kept the seats filled.
“Yeah.” The man sounded close, as if he were pressing his cheek against the barrier. He was not whispering though. “I didn’t know. So I should do that first?”
“Why? It is a biological function in response to friction.” Castiel sounded as puzzled as if Dean was squeezing his heart and admiring the beat. Which Dean had done to others before.
“Right on, you're a champ at swallowing.” Dean winked and gently clicked the bottom of his bottle against the bottom of Cas’s in a toast.
He didn’t get to add anything before the All-Seeing Eyes of Sam fixed on him like friggin’ lasers. “Just checking the time.” Dean lied smoothly. “Hey look, Castiel is back.”
Now Sam pulled out his bitchface, crossing his arms and settling back against the sofa with an air of determination.
“Oh I’m sorry, Reverend Jerk. Just wait till Saturday then and pray.” This time Sam hung up, sounding quite smug with his own cleverness.
“Fuck you, Sam. I’ve been drowning in the weeds down here trying to not blow my cover while you’re getting your rocks off jerking me around.”
Dean helped them carry the bags they wouldn’t need that night up to the elevators and the rooms. They weren’t bad. He nodded his approval.
“So it’s probably not hers.” She probably plowed the whole team. Uncharitable thought, but Sam was already clicking through the rest. She had pictures of old classic cars, from old and dented to shiny and remodeled. “Her dad messes with old cars..” Dean muttered. It was how they met. She didn’t know a battery from an engine herself.
Pulling into the parking lot across from the hospital, she climbed out and breathed the fresh air as she walked toward On The Corner.
“Hey,” Dean laughed, “what can I say? I know what I want. I let people know right away so if they want to throw themselves at me, they know it’s safe. If they don’t want to…” He shrugged with a negligent air.
Cas’ dorm wasn’t as large as the ones at the House, but it had a sitting area with the bed scooted off almost out of sight and a tiny kitchenette. Everything was in its place, and that white hoodie was stretched along the foot of the bed, the design on the back folded inside so he still didn’t get a good look.
He felt a bit guilty considering he forgot about her for most of the night, but it was a pretty slick line. No girl really wanted to hear a guy was having such a great time with his friends that he kinda forgot he was dating anyone.
Dean checked his phone again once the conversation moved on to whether proper attire would be khakis or charcoal grey trousers for live music. Not Sammy, he wasn’t some country club prep. Admittedly though, he was dressed nicer than Dean, who wore scuffed jeans and his green flannel shirt.
It was just some guy. He was a few steps above Sam, so hard to gauge his height. The most notable two things from the side were his messy black hair and very straight posture. He was wearing snug faded grey jeans and an oversized white hoodie with some tribal design on the back he couldn't quite make out.
Basements were not his friend. He'd had more ambushes there than anywhere else. As he reached for the handle the light flickered above.
“No. I’m here for you.” The angel spoke for the first time, voice gritty and low. Between that hair and the gravelly voice, maybe he just woke up. Do angels sleep?
A few were heading the opposite direction, guzzling their drinks and beers like their throats were on fire before they even had chili.
“It’s not the first time,” Cas paused to suck in a breath at the intrusion of two, “that I’ve been tortured.”
Dean jogged up the stairs and knocked twice confidently. A young boy answers the door and Dean’s hopes soar.
“Did I hand you the right wrench? I could not measure out the inches, but it was smaller than this one.” Cas turned his head away slightly, touching the eight inch wrench. His mouth moved like he was embarrassed, but did priests get embarrassed?
“Then why didn’t you say anything?” Dean knew he shouldn’t be exasperated at Cas, but there were a lot of things that shouldn’t be directed at him, so there you go.
“Thanks.” She looked at the card and rubbed her fingers across it. “You know, I just wanted to say thank you again. It’s been really rough without guidance here. I know people need this, but widespread acceptance isn’t coming easy.” She looked up at him with the strain showing around her eyes and mouth. “I’m so glad you accepted. We had some good offers, but none who spoke to me the way you do. You understand the struggle of being different.”
Dean wrapped his hands around the sides and lifted, biting into the end before it could sag too much under the weight of all that delicious charbroiled meat. Unlike some places with food challenges, this tasted fucking fantastic. He moaned around it, sliding his tongue against the ridged patty even as he chewed.
Lisa, the mother, had no pictures because the man who took her child also took time to rob her. And worse, he was a stalker that claimed was the father of her child which she vehemently denies. Normally he'd wonder if that was true, but parental kidnapping was still kidnapping and the police could and did drop the ball.
He leaned over to get a better look at the red-haired lady next to him. Similar lips to Castiel, but fuller.
The closer it got to nine o’clock the less frequent Benny took smoke breaks and Dean slowed down on beer. He rarely overdid it, just enough to relax and be the growly vocal backup to Benny’s surprisingly rugged baritone.
But after three days of talking to Cas on the phone regularly, he was starting to think maybe it was time for another road trip.
Castiel licked his very dry lips, heart pounding with fear and other darker things. “Why did you commit murder?”
“Not if you're going to blaspheme like that. Just keep your nose clean, shake a few hands, preach a few sermons, you'll be fine.
“Oh my goodness,” the one with long darker hair sucked in a breath, “you must be Celeste’s new Pastor. I hadn’t though…”
Charlie pretended to listen to her talk about the trauma of losing both her parents at the same time. It went on until the food was all gone and the ice cubes were melting.
He was leaking freely all over his thigh and smearing hotly against Dean’s shirt, and Dean wanted to pop the throbbing cock in his mouth. But that would be too kind. He’d already been too easy on this angel, no wonder it kept mistaking him for a person.
“I’m sorry about Sam.” Dean slid into the chair across from Cas and tried to figure out a good way to console the guy. Maybe he did or didn’t make a move, but wasn’t Sam interested? Why else did he keep inviting the other guy out? No, Sam admitted he liked him.
Charlie waved a hand. “Don’t worry about it. You’ve been stuck at more of my family events than any person non-blood related should have to without getting paid.”
Dean flipped off his phone and shoved it back in his pocket as he walked back to the frat house. The air was too warm to calm him down and he surreptitiously adjusted himself.
After the other winners were announced and Dean had to stop staring at the curve of Cas’s jaws every few minutes to chat with another person passing by, Dovie approached him nervously.
Dean rarely had his space invaded by another man who wasn’t looking for a fight, so he scanned the other man’s expression closely. No, those eyes were guileless and his mouth soft and relaxed. Whew, okay, well. “I’m Dean Paxton. Good to meet you.” He almost said Father, but that felt as strange on his tongue as calling him Daddy.
“I'm glad you're having a great time and all, but you invited dude then left him alone. You said yourself that he never goes anywhere but the library. That's crummy. And that's coming from me.”
“Yes. I finished a 1970 Pontiac GTO convertible by myself in high school. I redid the paint in its original code, 78 Burgundy, and replaced the white power top convertible. I rebuilt the original engine and added a Ram Air III Cam to really add power. That was my first and only lone project, but I’ve helped with others.”
He made with the loading his plate, figuring he needed all the energy he could get before Sam started to treat him like an emotional basketcase. He was just checking his phone. Can’t a man check his phone?
Dean tried not to smile at the rather pointed tone Cas was throwing his way. He was a little sensitive, wasn’t he? It was good to see him act human. “Ah. Grease fire?”
Even though they had used up their time, she dawdled longer so they could get some chatting and laughing in.
And what was worse, Benny had no idea who the guy was that came into the shop he worked part-time at. And Dean couldn’t ask the guy to maybe look at some receipts for him.
“Samuel,” he barked once his brother picked up. He opened the car door and slid in, depositing his bag on the passenger's seat. “Are you out of your friggin gourd? I can't pose as a goddamn Minister.”
Cas traced a finger along the top of his empty shot glass, the movement light and somewhat hypnotic. “I have a bottle back at my place.”
There was literally a throng of nerds, hot chicks, and some frankly flirty guys too hanging around him all night. Buying him mocktails and the occasional beer. By the end of the night he walked Cas to his dorm, but went home cause Sam.
In fact, he’d make sure Sam knew for sure that Dean accepted and liked Castiel. He kept throwing his arm around the guy, making sure Castiel was included no matter how many groupies came up and cast eyes at Dean.
Dean generously waved it off. “I’m just sorry I couldn’t appreciate it the way everyone else did, seems like it’s the best chili in town.” He flashed her one of his waitress-special smiles.
A large group of people were walking on the other side of the street and he took a chance in following them. Within about two blocks it was clear they were not, in fact, headed to the...shit, what was the name of the place they were playing at?
He pulled out his laptop and typed in the wifi password, heddy1, so he could watch Netflix or porn. After half the food’s worth of searching, he gave up on shows and pulled up a new browser. He should do research, but scantily clad honeys beckoned.
Dean was definitely not pleased with this turn of events. Didn’t Sam know what he did to encourage the nice guy to go for him? And he was going to throw it all away for some pervy little prick. Fuck!
After a second the boy dashed to pull open the door for her, waited till she was inside, and walked hesitantly back to Dean.
Dean noted that wasn’t quite an answer, but he did pull back the reins a bit. He didn’t want to alienate both priests, despite his earlier actions. “That’s cool. I think it’s good to see what the kids are watching. You know, see what they’re exposed to.”
He held up two fingers to the bartender again, looking back at Castiel. His upper body under the thin cotton shirt matched his legs, deceptively strong and clearly toned.
The other man had a strange expression, one he usually didn’t see directed at him. “That does make sense. That makes total sense. I mean I liked your sermon, I really did. But that was real in a different way, you know?”
Dean waved once to her and walked back to around the corner. He wasn’t dumb enough to think he just changed their whole lives, but maybe it’d come up again in their kid brains sometimes between candy and video games. Everyone needed a reminder that the people around them needed help.
“Yeah.” Dean stared at the pie harder. What was to stop Cas from taking up with someone else? There was still half a semester before graduation, if it followed the same timeline as high school.
After ensuring she wasn’t going to pitch the boxes like tea in a harbor, he made the short drive to the pretty little house of his favorite new constituent. Edith was tiny but she was sassy,. Besides, she promised up and down that in addition to supplying the prize for the chili winner, she would bake at least three pies to be sliced up and handed out.
Dean wetted his own lips before turning his head away to drain the last of his beer. “This has been a real gas, but I’ll do you a favor and try again to get Sam to leave.” He pulled away from Cas’s side and closed the distance with a few steps. He smacked Sam on the arm to get his attention away from his fellow principled nerds.
She paused, but her smile came back full force as she peeked in his car. “I think it’s amazing you were working down in Las Vegas, I think I mentioned that. Did you bring much? I’ll show you where you’ll be staying.”
A lot of laughter from the lookie-loos seemed to startle Cas, so at least he probably didn’t mean it badly.
Dean groaned at the soft contact, the first bit of kindness he’d been shown in decades. “Shut up.” But he didn’t punish with his body, continuing the steady thrusting until Cas threw his head back. The filthily wet sounds between them were loud as Cas sucked him in deeper.
“That’s deep. Okay, I take the Lord’s name in vain several times a week. Is that a good start?” The words rolled so easily off his tongue, as if this was a simple recitation the rules of a game.
Since he didn’t see any streets without yellow flyers the next stop was his car to transport the tools. “I’m heading up to the church now. I was gonna ask though, what’s up with that big brick house of Fifth Street. Um, had a boy about eleven…”
Dean colored up a bit, casting a look at Sam then Cas. The other man was a bit pink around the cheeks; Dean bet those two were playing footsie.
Then he prompts Sam to invite Cas out again and Sam admits he likes the guy. Pause! There, that. So it’s confirmed on Sam’s side. Then Dean goes with Cas to his dorms and there things got fuzzy. Lots of alcohol and he starts giving advice on how to snag a guy. By being bold.
“Of course it does! You know,” she gave Dean a big eyed look. “I attend Mass too. Do you think six-thirty would be fine?”
Eventually he found his way back to the place and crawled in the van, shivering with cold and faintly nauseous. He almost made himself puke just to get rid of some of those beers, but he knew by now that only helped a little. Instead he just pulled a stinky blanket over him, shut the van door, and sunk into blessed unconsciousness.
They only talked for a moment longer before other guy went on his way and Sam beckoned him to continue the tour.
He was sweating hard after the guitar solo, but the crowd ate it up. They were young and drunk, rocking out after a hard week of exams and homework and the like. He was pretty proud of this one, he helped write it. It was about a guy who had to decide between watching his youngest die or make a deal. It ended tragically, the ones he planned always did.
Dean took a swig when he had the bottle and held it back out. “Right. You can’t just sit back and hope they’ll notice. Some people wouldn’t get a clue if you wrote it on your chest and rubbed their face in it.” He leaned closer, propping his weight against the back of the couch with one arm. “You know what I mean?”
He stood up, catching his balance before he went right back on the couch. “Hey, only family and friends back here man.”
It was minutes of soft slurps and continual glimpses of his tongue curling against his upper lip or swiping the bottom of the burger. Maybe Sam was covertly watching and Dean didn’t notice. Cause he was wrong wrong wrong about Cas being so prim he couldn't get lost in pleasure. Holy fuck.
A man stood there, clad entirely in black from the round hem around his ankles to the long sleeves that folded at his wrists. Messy black hair and intense blue eyes filled Dean’s vision.
And when it was all over he grinned at Cas’s parents, in such a good mood he was just happy they were here. And Cas would be happy too.
Castiel allowed an amused twitch at the corner of his mouth on the unseen side of his face. “Standard practice is to begin with the ones you have the most difficulty speaking of. You can cover the mortal sins, and decide for yourself if you must speak on the venial sins as well.”
The dorms were further than the frat, but it was a good walk. Dean grilled Cas on his choice of music and was satisfied that, with a few exceptions, his taste didn’t completely suck. That was pretty important. For Sam.
Dean cracked his knuckles, thinking of her round butt in those tight pants she wore. Nicest ass he'd ever seen.
The hardware owner, Gus, was much nicer than the other store owner Dean had the misfortune to have seen twice. Not only did Gus already have a flyer up, he helped Dean get everything he needed in short order. Apparently he had been Charlie’s teacher once in elementary and never stopped being fond of her, according to his constant barrage of words.
Dean’s back hit the wall with force as a forearm pressed against his chest and thighs against his. Cas was literally pinning him to the wall, blue eyes poring over his face again with one eyebrow raised.
“You don’t need this for protection. That’s why you have me.” He reached around and draped one arm around Dean’s chest, palm pressing firmly against his shoulder.
“Hi Pastor!” Charlie’s happy beam could be practically heard through the phone. “I’ve got a wonderful lady by the name of Edith who has lots of tools and is offering us them. Can you pick ‘em up?”
“You are welcome either way. Edith, have a wonderful day.” Castiel turned, showing that what Dean thought was a skirt actually split at his waist and revealed black trousers.
“Yes,” Dean groaned out, unable to believe that he was balls deep inside of an angel, “I am.” Defiling something pure while looking into the bluest eyes he’d ever seen, he nearly finished right then and there. But he took his time, pulling back and rolling his hips to get a nice even rhythm. It was the first time he’d ever fucked someone when they weren’t crying, that he could
Gabe looked really excited, the disgusting pervert. If he were a cartoon wolf, his eyes would have popped out his skull and tongue lolled on the ground.
Dean leaned over to murmur, “Drink up, Sammy, I think someone’s getting lucky tonight.” He grinned at Cas’ retreating back. The guy clearly was dressed for it too with soft blue jeans that tightened along his thighs and ass when he moved.
But nobody never touched his sweet virgin ass? Alastair obviously didn’t teach them. By now Dean’s wires were so crossed that he was hard enough to slice glass, still pressing against Cas’s bare hip every so often to relieve the pressure.
“Great!” Dovie said, despite looking as if she thought nothing of the kind, and inched away with a wave. “See you two then.”
The man chuckled dryly, his voice a bit slow and old country like molasses. “I don’t have no problem with my daughter, Minister. I’ll defend queers as the day is long, but don’t disrespect me in my shop.”
Uneasy with how long he stared down at the Father, he hopped off the stool and went to investigate the box. Satisfied that they weren't all just poisoned, he trapped the side of the box. “Most houses built before a certain time,” like the 1900’s, “can't take this high wattage without redoing the wiring.”
When Dean lifted his head, he saw Cas’s solemn face and said nothing. He slid out of Cas when straightening up, refastening his jeans and placing one hand over the shackle. It opened and clinked as it swung and hit the wall behind them.
That was like two weeks after they broke up. Dean simmered and stewed, foot bouncing as he crossed his ankle over his thigh.
The pews looked old but sturdy, the square windows on each side let in plenty of light. At the front was an old podium tucked into a full length bay window. Everything was painted white except the wood furniture. He had to admit, he feared worse from the jungle outside.
Dean leaned in until their chests were flush, licking his lips as he hovered an inch from Castiel’s cheek. “Being this close to you makes me hot. What do you think of that, soldier-boy?”
His brother laughed increduously, a bit bewildered too. “So? Gabe’s just a flirt, he doesn’t mean anything by it.”
Dean thinks he's talking to Charlie, but it is definitely not Charlie. Castiel learns a little about how size matters.
His fingers brushed something too smooth and round to be a tool. It took him shamefully long to figure out it was a shoe. “Oh man, Charlie I’m glad you’re here. Excuse the language, but someone replaced the old pipes with copper and I’m trying to figure out if they just replaced these ones or if it goes into the wall. Can you hand me the six inch wrench?
The one with short hair was dressed rough, jeans and a plaid shirt. When he wasn’t speaking to his brothers he sat with crossed arms and the clear look of someone who did not want to be there.
“Benny’s driving the van up tomorrow.” Dean had two reasons for coming up early. One, he got to spend some time with his brother before the kid disappeared into some big city and only visited this podunk place every few years. Second, the van smelled like unwashed socks and sweaty balls. The air conditioning had went out during the last half of summer and nobody had enough scratch to fix it, even with Dean working in a garage.
don’t think John needs it. So what do you think about the ceiling? We painted it, but is it fine for Casino Night?” She was bad at changing the subject. Probably made a horrible liar too.
“Thanks.” Dean kinda wished Cas’d stop saying his name with that sex-on-tape voice, it was crossing Dean’s signals all up. Or mixing them. He didn’t know. He blamed this long-ass dry spell.
“Drink up then, this’ll knock your collar in the dirt.” He just wanted tos ee if Cas would do it. Ceremonial wine schwine, he wanted to see a Servant of the Lord drink whiskey because if God was real, he was already going to hell.
“I’m not into Sam.” His expression dropped back into those stoic lines, his voice utterly serious. An impressive feat with swollen, wet lips and a ragged timbre.
Dean smirked at the bitchface thrown his way, but otherwise his brother ignored that too and went back to clicking around on his computer. The plate was halfway empty before It began.
On the downside, Sam was staring at him like he was a freak. “How drunk are you? You’re all flushed.”
Dean was torn between inviting himself over to her dorms after the show for sex or pie? He couldn’t remember the last time he had burnt sugar pie. He wiped his chin just in case all his overactive saliva glands were pushing out too much to handle.
Cas was the first to break the silence, his eyes as deep and blue as an endless sky. “Is that bold enough?”
Stately on the outside, resplendent on the inside. Handwoven rugs in every room, each costing more than the last. Not one item out of place, as the children who once grew up there were still too afraid to touch anything.
“Did I?” The voice on the other side was most definitely male, a bit jagged and mostly amused. “This is my first time.”
“Is the feeling not mutual?” He sneered, letting his parted lips brush the angel’s jaw. Unsnapping the front of the pants, he slid his hand down to cup the soft, loose skin. “Hmm, thought it’d be smooth. Not a Ken doll, what d’ya know.”
“I apologize for my rudeness. I am Father Castiel Novak.” He took a step closer as if to offer his hand, but it never rose.
“C’mon. I just want to feel someone else who’s real. I promise, no clothes will be taken off and I have no weapons. Your hand is as safe as whore in a convent.”
“Fine, bitch, you can sit in the back. But I’m Cas’s family.” Dean ignored Sam’s hurt face, kinda annoyed that he wasn’t going to chair-crash with him. Dean even made sure to thank his frat brother, Terrence, for holding the seat he could, but it wouldn’t be necessary anymore.
The messy hair caught his eye, even though it was lined with grey. And when the older guy turned, he didn’t the bold blue eyes of Cas, but they were blue enough.
Cas’s gaze travelled over the crowd and to the tables. More than one person hid their bottle behind their back and stared hard at the ground. His attention crawled back to Dean and he remained serious-faced. “I might have to do that.”
He raised an eyebrow. “Have you seriously been in love with her since high school? That’s dedication.”
“Mm hmm.” Dean tried to inconspicuously peer past him to see if there were any hints or proof that a young boy might live here.
“Oh no, of course not. I usually make meatloaf on Sunday. Not spicy meatloaf. Is that, is that okay?”
“My name’s Dean. Charlie hired me to preach at Roseview.” Did all the priests around here have angel names? He googled Castiel, who apparently was the Angel of Thursday. Kinda funny, actually.
But she wasn’t in her mother’s house to enjoy herself. She had to look for the will, as fruitless as it seemed. Grace and Lisa were tearing each other apart.
Bela, or Abbie, knocked her elbow into Ruby’s arm to make her let go of Dean. “And what is that?” She pointed at the papers, the ones he nearly forgot about.
Dean couldn’t bring himself to be sarcastic or say he knew Cas’s was going well. Instead he just grinned dopey and wrote back.
“What a shocker.” Dean kept his hands at his side and just watched Cas out of the corner of his eye. It might be pushing it a little far, but that was just who he was. He manfully kept his mouth firmly shut as Cas finally tipped the bottle back and drank several times, gasping after each gulp, to carefully check where the liquid fell.
“If they’re not grabbing at you yet, you got to close the distance.” This time he was marginally prepared for how Cas took everything so damn literally and was leaning forward to stop just a centimeter from his mouth, head tilted. It was so close Dean couldn’t lick his own lips without inadvertently touching Cas’ mouth, so he kept his tongue in his mouth despite the urge to wet his dry lips.
“Sorry about that. Julia and Jim are very vocal about their bigotry. She used to be my babysitter, actually. She hasn’t spoken to me in years and she won’t step foot in my dad’s shop. I guess because it’s his fault she was exposed to my kind.”
“Son of a bitch,” Dean muttered as he went through the tiny rented rooms to pick up. He did tend to lay waste to any place he was staying longer than a night, but rarely did he have someone break-in. Crowley had unnerved him more than he let on, who knows how long he had been there?
Good god. The door opened and at first he saw no one. Then his eyes traveled down to see a tiny, blue-haired lady peering up at him. She had a wood cane handle clenched in both hands and bright eyes in an immensely wrinkled face.
“What is this? Your boyfriend?” Dean could take ‘em. Dude was tall, but didn’t have the hard-won muscles Dean had from being ass-deep in engines and moving heavy crap around.
“Well, I guess there is the Bowling League. We’ve got two teams of young women, the Sassafras’s and Three-Finger Salute’s.”
After another unwitting glance at the mouth belonging to Cas, no, belonging to God, Dean carefully leaned back and pushed off with one leg to get further under the sink.
Sam did not say ‘I told you so’, though his eyes hinted at it, before clicking. “Oh, that’s from JJ Burgers!” He pointed at the burger filling up a white plate. “It’s a four pound burger, if you eat it all, it’s free. The football team goes there after games and wrecks the place.”
While he did a few more curious neighbors to open their door, they usually fell into two categories. Some asked him questions about himself and the Sunday service, and others asked him about himself and the contest. It was easy to tell which were being polite and which had an interest.
Cas was still sitting in the chair, his expression barely changed. He didn’t look disgusted or anything.
“Would you like my continued assistance?” came the bone-penetratingly deep voice. It didn’t verberate like a bass deep voice, but it was just this close to groggy-rough and it just got under his skin.
“Hate you,” he whispered as he thrust one last time and all the anger and lust and hate poured deep into Cas, rushing out like poison sucked into a willing body. When it stopped he slumped against the bound body., breathing hard.
Oh, what an excuse! Early class, early meeting, early work, it was all the same brush off. “No, I feel like this is my fault.” He shook his head at the whole situation. He was supposed to be making sure his brother had someone solid around when Dean had to go back home.
Dean didn’t want to be that guy tonight, but when Scott returned with several beers Dean took two and began to double fist them.
“He’s gone, brother.” Benny snickered and slapped a hand on his shoulder. “I’m out too. Good luck with that.” And his own bandmate, the man he slept in smelly-sock van with, and helped write songs left him standed there.
“And,” Gus said decidedly, “if you decide you like it here, it’s not a bad home to have. And, oh, if you’re looking for a little companionship, I know a few people.”
Okay, something was wrong and he was not sober enough to figure any of this out. It was like he was missing something and without it nothing made sense.
He screamed at the light, it burned him through the imaginary clothes he wore and seared at his brain. Gradually the pain stopped and he lowered his arm.
Dean belatedly realized there was no way whatsoever to get ahold of the guy, if he had any other questions, said quickly, “I’ll be here most of the week, fixing things.”
Dean had to stop standing there acting like he was just as struck by the man’s presence as everyone else. He wasn’t, at all. “I’ll show you the table...Cas.”
But of course he was winning her over, Dean could charm any lady. And he was working extra hard to win her over. The dad didn’t look upset either, rather mildly amused at his wife’s laughter at Dean.
While Dean loved his beer, he preferred certain brands over all the new trendy flavors and mixtures coming out. However, if it got people there he was all for old men bringing their moonshine.
He crouched down, pointing at the ground in front of him. “Poor stance, you two. And poor manners. A real soldier always helps someone in distress.” Keeping the distinct snap in his voice they’d have heard many a time on tv from a drill sergeant, he pointed behind them.
Dean ignored Sam’s phone calls into the next day, knowing Sam thought he was mad about Gabe still and he was fine with letting Sam think that. It was better than the alternative. He ignored all and any texts that buzzed in too.
He had to switch forearms nightly just so one wasn’t as big as Popeye after snorting spinach. He was fucking
“Maybe when you move?” her friend said encouragingly. She hadn’t like the idea of her bestie moving so far, but admitted that if it made Charlie happy, she’d be happy.
Dean buttoned up his flannel shirt mutinously, taking a heavy seat by Sam on the sofa. Blue Eyes was still there, sitting on the single chair perpendicular to them.
“I can’t.” Castiel rasped out, wondering why he was just sitting there and not jerking his hand away. But a part of him knew why as his eyes closed, the swipe of tongue leaving a tingling line to his second knuckle.
Castiel stood up and carried his plate to the sink. “Thank you for lunch. I do have to go now,” he said politely, neutrally. He rinsed the plate and turned around.
“At-TEN-tion!” Dean barked, catching exactly that. Two boys’ arrested face and the shocked face of one mother.
“Dean, are you going to be able to finish that?” Sam snorted as he eyed the burger he still had left.
“Ah.” Dean wanted to turn right around and drive his Baby right out of this mess, but a religious person wouldn’t do that, right? He wouldn’t bail, he’d be excited to, uh, give people a place to worship. “So who’s the head person around these parts?”
A decent amount of college kids showed up just before seven, saving them from playing to two drunks and a bartender. He’d rocked out nights on like that, but it wasn’t as good as having a little participation.
Not Dean. He was more like his father, only wiping enough grease off his hands to grab an ice cold beer on an average day. Yeah. He worked at Bobby’s with his dad, though Dean was the more reliable worker.
Bradford took his seat and greeted Crowley and John like old friends. Charlie brought three bowls for him, explaining which number each belonged to. The festivities continued on while Dean hung by the table just to avoid talk, not to be near Cas, and finished off his bottles.
His blue eyes held his before dropping just a few inches then back up. His lips were parted in hesitation. “How bold do you think I should be?”
The man was smart, charming, and he’d built their surroundings with his two hands. Dean was no stranger to hard work, with his rough hands and casual mention of raising two boys when he was a child himself.
He chuckled against the wet skin. “You’re so damn responsive. Do you like being tied up? I bet you do, you kinky bastard. Need me to slap you around like a bored housewife?”
Castiel felt his own blood rushing loudly in his head, taking short breaths quietly as possible. He had always considered the possibility he may hear such a confession, but not quite like this.
He swallowed the bite, taking a big noisy slurp of his iced tea. He didn’t like tea as a rule, but it seemed very Minister-ly.
A smile twitched at the corner of Cas’ mouth as he watched the children, eyes softening. “I want to help people become whole. I want to help them heal.”
“You too, Priest.” He even gave a jaunty wave before turning around and leaving yet another establishment that wasn’t exactly welcoming.
“Do some legwork then.” Sam did start to sound exasperated. “We’ve had all of two cases where the missing person just plops in our lap. Stop acting like such an amateur.”
Couldn’t blame him, Dean would be pretty put out if he were in the guy’s position. “Two more Thighslappers!” He held up two fingers to the non-owner bartender and wiggled the bottle in case she couldn’t hear him. He threw down a five once they were placed in front of him and held out one to Castiel.
Maybe Sam hadn’t worked up the nerve to actually ask him out yet. Yeah, his geeky brother was probably just as hopeless with boys as girls as it turned out. Maybe inviting him to the show was Sam’s way of feeling out the waters.
“You need that extra hotel room?” Benny asked with a knowing air. He was still sharp-eyed for a guy that had two beers and four shots, but then he always could hold his liquor well.
Dean crossed his arms and turned his chair away, refusing to look. Why should he? Every year she came home from college for the summer, looking to hook up and be taken out to dinners and bars. Dean’s always done it, because Cassie is hot. Like, smokin’ hot in a way that tiny two-bar towns in Kansas shouldn’t have.
Perhaps that’s why he missed the oddity of the words. He looked at the clover-cross lattice between the confessor and himself, but all he could see were slats.
Everybody Charlie knew had worked there at some point. It was the hub of economy in the town, hundreds of people would be out of a job if anything happened to the cluster of buildings.
The dove white Welcome sign hung by two wooden posts with no civilization in sight yet, reading Welcome to Lebanon! Center of the United States!
Cas finally took a seat, fingers wrapping around the base of the beer but not lifting it. Dean introduced him to Benny and waited for all the greetings to go around the table. Neither Sam nor Cas were drinking.
“It is Castiel. If it makes you comfortable…” That wasn’t the first thing he’d remember in hindsight, but it wasn’t the last either.
“Does he?” She shared a knowing look with Abbie. “Don’t worry, Pastor, we’ll get the word out.” The way her mascara thick lashes coursed over him, he was sure they’d be talking about a lot more than the event.
It was a part of sacrament, and that made it part of his duties. “I understand. Did you cross yourself beginning?”
Then his vision cleared and the angel was wearing a meatsuit, or at least appeared to. It had messy dark hair that looked finger-fucked, vivid blue eyes that focused straight on him.
“Let’s see if you cry or come then, pretty angel.” He bit the long muscle of Cas’s neck until his teeth left indents, swiping his tongue along the salty skin with pinpricks of blood dotting it. He ran his hand over the flagging erection, pumping until it was red-flushed and straining against his palm before he scissored two fingers inside.
Dean glowered at Gabe. And what kind of trashy bastards slipped a guy their number who was liplocking publicly with another person?
Dean moved the top of his middle finger into his mouth, scalding the skin with a hard suck. “I’ve taken several lives in the past year.”
Dean chuckled at the sarcasm and took the top of the stack, maybe thirty papers total. “I’m going to go canvas on the north side of town. I did the west last time.”
Cas rocked forward and stood up in one smooth motion. That took practice. “I should go as well. Thank you, Pastor, for discussing matters with me.” He nodded to Charlie respectfully on the way out.
“Ohh,” Gabe breathed, placing a hand on his chest. “I think Sam is capable of saying where his interest lies. You’re not jealous, are you?”
“I’ll be out here. See ya Wings, Goliath.” The door shut behind him and that was better for him, cause Dean totally could have taken him.
“If you would ever like to come by Mass, we began at eight in the morning on weekdays.” Castiel had a formal way of speaking, as if he never heard of slang. It had to be an affectation to keep up his holy presence.
He turned, keeping one arm around Cas’s waist firmly, his waist now, and saw Sam grinning happily at him.
Castiel slowly took a seat, looking from side to side as if contemplating this. He did take a swig though and that was a clear sign all was well.
Yes, his last assignment was in Las Vegas, and yes, he was looking forward to settling down in Lebanon. Nobody asked about his orientation or dating life, but he could also tell which people found it objectionable. He talked up the contest to everyone regardless.
“Your daughter,” Dean said as he laid down a paper on the counter, “is hosting an event this Saturday. Should I sign you up now, or?”
Dean tore down the side steps, making his way down the tiny hall through two doors looking everywhere in the crowd for Sam. Sam, Sam could explain this. All Dean could think was what the fuck had he even texted ‘Cassie’ over the last week? He told him he wanted to see him shirtless, that his mouth was...oh shit, he said he wanted to bend him over.
Grace lived as close as possible by choice, and Lisa had to live reasonably close since their mother paid for her place.
He stuck to his fake childhood for the case, he was born in Morrison, Colorado and travelled with his father who was a travelling Minister. Dean took up the mantle when his father passed away.
“I’m going to take you out of this place.” Cas said quietly, his voice a rumble in the din of screams and other disgusting sounds that Dean knew too well. “Through the flames.”
Besides, she already met most of the lesbians in the general vicinity through her ex-girlfriend. And most of them had dated each other at some point and she wasn’t sure if she could handle that. She couldn’t be mad at a girlfriend for having a life before her, but she hated hanging around all her girlfriend’s exes. There, she said it, even if just to herself.
Pressing in and out against the thick ring of muscle, he listened to Cas groan quietly. “How come you react to this and not stabbing? Or is that not a pain sound?” He was partially curious, but that didn’t stop him from working a finger in until he could work in two.
On the plus side, apparently Crowley had came armed with information on who Dean actually was, so it wasn’t as if he was going to find anything other than that.
“Sure, Father.” He just remembered he pulled out all the wrenches to make dirty inferences. “Can you hand me the six inch again?” It was set in his hand and he went to work. “Thanks. Do you care if I just call you Cas though? I feel weird saying Father, cause mine’s dead. Same goes for being called my son.” It was so condescending too, especially from a man who literally could not be his father.
He ducked under the silky looking rope cutting the audience from the family, boldly sitting in a fairly populated area.
“It’s just new to them. Soon you’ll be part of the background.” Dean picked up a glass of water next to his stack of spoons and took a big long drink. There was a whole pitcher of ice water in the middle of the table, at least it would give him something to do with his hands. He could almost feel Cas lean back and the air felt less stifled.
Cas also had a score of siblings, most older. He was used to doing things on his own. Seriously, Cas very rarely shared any stories of his past that involved his parents.
And this marks the end of the prompt originated mistaken-identity stalking, though it turned rather interactive, didn't it? ;) Hope it was enjoyed by all, don't forget to tip your waitress! (Me, which is me, leave a review because I love them!)
“Dean certainly never has a problem showing interest.” Sam interjected dryly. “He just throws a wink and a grin their way and it’s done. I’ve never seen anyone love attention the way he does.”
Dean stroked his jaw slowly. Competitive, were they? “What’s a food the town is known for? Anything?”
“Good thing we're having meatloaf and not soup,” Dean said with raised eyebrows. To his great surprise, he heard a collection of sounds that could be a chuckle. But that couldn’t be right.
“You know what, maybe I should walk you home.” Dean considered as they turned down another barely lit street.
Dean shifted while sitting on the lip of the tub, elbows resting on his knees as he typed away. Had to admit, he was getting turned on. He was already turned on earlier at various points of the night, the effects of alcohol and his abstinence of course.
Charlie swallowed down a big bite of the sandwich, shaking a finger at her. “At least you have two someones to go home to.” It was a playful tone though, because she was really happy for her. She wasn’t the type to make everyone around her shush up about their happiness just because her love life was crap.
“Hey bro, how many numbers did you score yesterday?” Gabe asked Cas, but his smirk was all for Dean.
The many pillars were white but the wall panels with a warm beige, and it was not inundated with crosses. The backlights on the wall behind the stage were yellow flanked by orange, and all of the stained glass windows were predominantly an intense blue that reminded him of their priest’s eyes.
The first time Dean saw the Angel of the Lord, he was as bright as the sun and his voice vibrated down to his very bones.
Clearing his throat, Dean tried his best to divert his thoughts back to the topic at hand. He was going to need more alcohol. He grabbed the abandoned bottle in the corner and took a damn long drink. He tried to sound matter of fact once he shoved the bottle at Cas. “Shoulders, chest, whatever. I don’t think it matters at this point.”
He’d tell Cas where to put his hands, right here that’s where. He’d drag him close and whisper in his ear exactly how to move, and Cas’d do it, he’d do it while squirming because he was just as turned on. But Dean would make Cas wait, until he begged for it like a good boy. Then Dean would teach him anything he wanted…
What the hell, he’d drink with the guy for a bit. Dean hadn’t gotten a text and he didn’t want to do all the chasing. He couldn’t be too available, especially when he gave her all these opportunities to jump him.
“Thanks.” Dean grabbed one and poured himself a glass. He’d found himself in some pretty fucked up situations because of alcohol, but this was a category all its own. Didn’t he break a serious bro code? It was even worse because it was his actual brother. Did it count if the person was drunk and practicing? Shit.
Dean had both his hands twisted in the other man’s shirt, keeping his close as his head turned to the other side to get deeper. To suck his tongue in until Cas was groaning too. If this continued, he was going to spill in his jeans like a teen grinding in the backseat of his father’s car.
Dean waved off the reaction and waited for Castiel to stand up, the jeans molding to the strong thighs, and leave. Molded to his ass too. Dean tore his eyes away a little late for Sam to not have noticed. Fuck.
Sam smiled instead of frowned and that was too much for Dean. He turned up the music and jammed in his head the rest of the car ride home.
Sliding into the driver’s seat, he checked his phone again. Should he? Well, he was actually into girls. And pretty much only girls. Alcohol and being sexually frustrated was his problem. Hell yeah, he was doing this.
Sam looked up with raised eyebrows. “I guess? You know that just because I said you act weird around him doesn’t mean you have to bend over backwards to show you like him.” He placed his phone on one knee as if he wasn’t just about to text the guy.
“You’re the best.” She took the seat across from her, pausing at the sight of a bright green purse next to the food. “Who’d you invite, Rita Skeeter?”
Dean was beginning to think it wasn’t because the memories were unhappy, but rather that Cas’s parents just weren’t even around to make memories with.
Dean laughed, a low throaty sound, leaning back. "The point is, making food is like making love. If you’re doin’ it with someone, you want to hear some feedback."
As the house came in sight though, the Impala did as well. Dean checked the keys in his pocket, raising one eyebrow. Well, it wouldn’t be the first time for that either.
Sam was barely able to hide his smile, looking at Dean as if he hung the moon and the stars. “What should we do?”
Castiel nods his head towards his dresser, and Dean walks to it. “Alright, while I’m doing this, you get naked.” And then, for as loud as the room had just been with their noises and voices, it’s suddenly quiet again.
They look at each other for a beat before breaking into slightly manic giggles, like the events of what just occurred are finally catching up with them. Castiel thinks it might be New Year’s before his brain is up and wired correctly again.
Sam scoffs a little bit, jostling Eillen where she’s practically in his lap. “Yeah, but this is Dean we’re talking about. The man doesn't even cry when he’s shot.”
“Uh-huh…” he says, sounding strained. Before Castiel can panic, which is pretty much exactly what he wants to do right now, Dean continues, “So what I’m hearing is that you wanna do dirty things to me while I sleep.”
noise. Dean can almost imagine Cas’s- or Cas’s vessel, at least- eyebrows drawn in thought. “It’s as close to my real voice as I can project without causing you harm.”
Cas’s tone is controlled, a command. It makes Dean’s shoulders tighten and his jaw clench. He keeps walking.
“Just like this?” And, God, the pads of Cas’s fingers are still grazing Dean’s nipples, back and forth, over and over until Dean is having problems concentrating.
It’s more stripped, a bitter thing that croons on. Dean can already imagine it playing in the background of his morning routine. It’s about a breakup, he realizes, a proposal gone wrong. He listens to the story unfold with closed eyes so he doesn’t miss any of the words.
Cas’s back is to Dean, his broad shoulders pulling the fabric of his shirt taut, and he’s humming a song that Dean doesn’t recognize in that deep voice of his. At this moment, Castiel is miraculous. Dean feels like he could cry again over a different sort of big emotion.
He hears Cas walk into the room, hears the rustling of his trench coat, and the scrape of the wooden feet of his desk chair being pulled out for Cas to sit on. “Would you like to talk about it?”
“What Dean means is thank you, Sam,” Castiel interrupts with a warm tone. “Also, pie sounds like a fantastic idea.”
It is the first time he has said the words aloud, or even really acknowledged them head-on. They’re not as scary as he thought they would be. A gentle breeze picking up to carry his voice away is the only acknowledgment he gets from the clearing.
Beside them, Dean is moving again as he plates the eggs from the skillet. “You- Is everything okay, Cas? Not that I don’t enjoy hearing about how great I am, but you’re kinda freakin’ me out.” Dean sets the plate of eggs on the table and then turns to Castiel with a raised eyebrow.
“Oh, that’s how it is, huh? Fine, let’s just settle this right now then. One round, no redos, winner gets bragging rights and loser has to pay for drinks.”
Castiel thinks they have passed the stand Mrs. Pogany sells flowers out of for the third time. They still have not gotten to his honey stall. There are children running around in loose and short summer clothing, offering plumes of free giggles into the air.
“Jesus,” Finley scoffs humorously. “Well, I wouldn’t want to dash your dreams on that. Drawing lessons sound nice.” She sighs. “Besides, I could use someone to get on my case to practice more.”
The jovial expression on Dean’s face has disappeared, replaced by a vulnerable openness that raises his eyebrows in surprise. He blinks again. He is beautiful. Unarguably.
Dean is a stranger, that much Castiel is sure of. But he is made up of familiars, of the unnatural red of the mesh bag and the natural orange of the fruit inside of it, his green eyes leaves of a Floridian tree in the sunlight.
Sam doesn’t say anything as he passes behind Dean to get to the other side of him, where he sinks to the floor a few feet away to sit with his back leaning up against the half-wall Dean is shooting over.
It becomes a categorization of all of Dean’s softness, of every scar, where Dean is somehow, impossibly, still whole. And he remains unmoving, even under Castiel’s ministrations. He just breathes on evenly and blinks every few seconds. But Dean’s soul is melted without a trace of its usual scaliness, so Castiel continues his task.
It’s cold at first, but good. So good where Dean doesn’t have to hide the way his head tilts back at the sensation, the way he closes his eyes and soaks it up like a flower in the sun. “Fuck yeah.”
“I know I joke about how good-lookin’ you are. You’ve been in bed with me, it’s not exactly a secret how hot I find you. At least not these days, huh? But you- you’re beautiful.” The word almost gets stuck in Dean’s throat, but he forces it out anyway. He swallows. “A real looker, Cas. It makes me want- this is weird, now that I say it out loud. Uh, but sometimes when I look at you, it’s like my brain goes all slow and fuzzy like it’s hibernating. Like a rabbit. I don’t think rabbits hibernate, but that’s not the point. Just something about you that makes me feel really good and safe. Even on days where shit’s still hard, and I get paranoid and I burn breakfast and I feel like holing up in my room for the next week, just lookin’ at you makes things better. ‘Cause you’re Cas. You’re just- you make things easier. Like a blanket.”
Cas’s chest is heaving as he pulls away so he can look down at Dean, intense eyes flitting around like he’s trying to soak up every detail before landing on Dean’s face and groaning at whatever he sees.
He doesn’t tell Sam about Cas. He doesn’t want to. When Sam asks the next morning what has him all chipper, he just responds that he got laid real nice and hard- until Sam practically begs him to shut up. But Sam seems happy that he’s more hopeful, smiling easier. And maybe in moments like these, he really believes that Cas wasn’t lying about Sam staying.
But Castiel can’t find it in himself to hide his own smile at their interaction, and says, “You’re always welcome to stop by, for honey or for bee trivia from a supposed cup of chamomile tea.”
It takes a minute to register the fact that he’s just staring up at Cas and not saying anything. Castiel’s infinite gaze is still at full force, securing him inside of his body and making him feel achingly small, achingly new like a baby bird that still can’t fly, and Cas is the nest that’s holding him up in the tree.
Dean reaches to pause his music. Breathes. Runs a hand through his hair. Because it’s too good. It’s literally too good, and he feels like his skin is crawling with the bell of Taylor’s voice. Because Zeppelin has its place, always, but man is Dean glad he got over whichever one of his father’s many apparent complexes that made Dean feel like he couldn’t listen to music like this. This is a goddamn masterpiece.
Yes, yes, fuck, I love you,” Castiel sobs. His head slams back into the bone of Dean’s shoulder as he comes. It’s blinding. He’s numb and floating on it while he stripes his stomach with his orgasm.
Dean sighs with relief like this is the best news he’s ever heard. “Oh, good. ‘Cause- uh- it was pretty awesome on my end, too.”
Dean had told him that evening that Castiel used to enjoy watching documentaries (which he discovered he still did) and insisted they watch one together. One had turned into two had turned into Sam calling it quits for the night and heading to bed. Dean had started snoring halfway through the third movie, the one about the birds of paradise.
The swelling murmurs of the crowd in the marketplace are no longer an ominous queasy thing, but a familiar signal of someone equally familiar approaching. Castiel and Anna share a look, and then Castiel is smiling before he even sees Dean through the window. Sure enough, Dean appears in all of his glory, in all of his tan skin that is just the right size for his body, in all of his generosity and gentle nature.
“It can and it is. Feels fucking good, sweetheart.” This, Dean is good at. The dirty talk, the teasing in his voice. He’s too fucked out to even try to be self-conscious about it, not after Cas was all up in his business and canoodling with his soul. “You’re so deep in me, Cas. Wanna feel more. Mmm, love the way you feel inside me.”
Her eyebrows raise slowly in surprise even as her mouth twitches into a playful sort of smile. “That I am.” She’s got a nice voice, too, Dean can’t help but think. Must run in the family. “You wouldn’t happen to be Dean, would you?”
That honey butter sounds extremely enticing. Castiel remembers the comfort of honey butter very well now.
They both gape at her. Cas sips at the Moscow Mule he can’t taste to unsuccessfully hide his amused grin.
The answer appears to be not, because he can tell that Dean is stiffening too, just against the top of his thigh. That is- it’s Dean’s- A part of him that no one else gets to see or touch. A physical manifestation of his enjoyment of their closeness. It is a sensation that Castiel will not forget anytime soon. Even if he and Dean were to never do this again, Cas thinks that he could reach orgasm every day for the rest of his life just from the memory of Dean’s hardness against him.
Dean rolls his eyes because he doesn’t know what else to do when his stomach feels like this, when his cheeks are turning rosy. “Yeah, alright. Just- promise me you’ll at least give it a shot?” He’s too tired to stop himself from adding, “I worry about you, man.”
And maybe it’s about more than protecting Dean and Charlie’s privacy, though that is a motivator. Maybe Castiel just wants to be selfish. Just with this one thing.
“Alright,” Dean murmurs in his ear, through the rush of blood pulsing there, “alright, sunshine, let’s bring you back.” Dean’s stroking slows to a petting of the slippery skin, then travels up soothingly across Castiel’s stomach. With the arms wrapped around Castiel, Dean rocks them both gently side to side.
“We’re still having dinner together, aren’t we? You, Gabriel, and I? I wonder if Dean would want to come. Maybe even Charlie… Sam and Eileen. That sounds wonderful. The holidays get so lonely.”
“Let’s get you to bed, then,” Cas’s low voice holds no suggestiveness, if anything it’s tender, but Dean can’t help but flush, and what is he, thirteen?
Dean is positive he never told Cas his last name. He hasn’t told anyone his real last name in probably a decade. Cas knows him, inexplicably, somehow. What a messy metaphor for it all, for what Dean hides versus what he pretends to be versus what he is. Dean sobs. The high collar of Cas’s dress shirt is there to catch his tears.
“I can’t say I don’t get it, man. I only made it to track eleven before I crumbled. But in my defense, it was about cowboys.” He and Cas share a soft look.
Still, he is awake against all odds. There’s no going back to sleep now. And it’s dark out, which means it must be so late that it’s early again for the long summer days. When he manages to read his clock with his exhausted wet eyes, the hands tell him it's fifteen minutes until five.
“This joint was particularly tricky to recreate. The angle of your leg is quite specific, and a good center of gravity can be the difference between life and death when hunting. I had to make sure it was perfect.” Cas’s voice is gruff now, a fondness seemingly marred by simmering arousal and possessiveness that makes Dean shiver. The looming heat in his gut is steadily growing with Cas’s words, and he holds his breath, waits to hear more.
The muscles in Castiel’s legs tense. He gasps against Dean’s mouth. His eyes are clenched shut and his cheeks are hot.
Understanding seems to dawn on Cas. He looks at Dean so softly it reminds him of his mom in a way, and that makes Dean feel like crying all over again. He swallows around the lump in his throat.
Dean kind of wants to puke. Words like beautiful and divine absolutely do not apply to him. His hands are filthy with blood and his soul is covered in scar tissue, his whole being a scab that never seems to heal. Certainly not ringing like a bell, certainly not righteous.
Dean had already nervously changed into a t-shirt and boxers, after some deliberation of whether that was weird to wear around Cas or not, and then landing on the fact that that is simply what he slept in and he worried too much. So, he’s under his warm covers, fighting the way his eyelids droop, hoping that Cas will hurry up and also that Cas never shows up and they can both pretend Dean’s groggy ass had never opened his mouth.
All of the peace that fills Dean’s expression when he sleeps is present on his face now. All of that laxness that makes Castiel feel like he can’t get close enough, that makes him hungry in a way he’s never felt before. Castiel’s jaw clenches and his own eyes flutter shut for a moment with how overwhelmed he feels. He’s dazed even further when he pulls his hips back cautiously, just to push in at the same sluggish pace. It feels indulgent and thick, like molasses. He gulps.
“To be honest with you, Cas, I’m pretty beat.” As Dean says it, it’s like he finally gives himself permission to show his own tiredness where it finally comes to the surface, out of hiding. His shoulders droop further. “Nothing too crazy, just- I’ve been walking a lot and it’s so goddamn hot out. Need to start carrying a canteen on me or something.”
The chaos grows louder when the crowd realizes who they are. People call out to Dean and Charlie in greeting, some faces Dean recognizes and some he doesn’t. It’s something that hasn’t bothered Dean in a very long time, but that he’s suddenly extremely conscious of with Cas joining them. He almost wants to tell everyone to shut up, to be careful not to scare Cas away.
Dean can’t find words.  He’s never been good with words, and now, especially… he finds none.  He isn’t worth of this, he thinks.  He isn’t worthy of an angel’s love, let alone
He leans in and kisses Cas.  It’s slow and tentative at first, but Cas relaxes into him, his hands gripping at the back of Dean’s shirt.  Dean’s tongue glides along Cas’s bottom lip, begging entrance, and he groans when Cas allows it.  One hand shifts to the back of his head, gripping at Cas’s hair as he deepens the kiss, holding Cas as close and tight as possible.  His fears from earlier had yet to dissipate; the last thing he could possibly handle is Cas disappearing again.
When they part, they rest their foreheads together, and Dean takes a deep breath. “I love you, Cas. And I’m a fucking idiot for not wanting to show everyone. I’m sorry. I was a dumbass.”
Cas lifts his hands, pushing Dean’s open flannel from his shoulders.  He smirks as it falls to the floor and slips his hands under Dean’s t-shirt.  “I have never been more sure of anything, Dean, as I am of this.  Of
With a huff of exasperation, Dean whirls around on his heel to look at Cas directly.  “I’m sorry,” he sais, more forceful than intended.  Cas looks taken aback, and Dean’s face softens.  “I-- The kid…”  He heaves a breath, pushing his hands in the pockets of his FBI windbreaker as he looks down at his feet.  He toes at a scuff mark and tries to collect his thoughts; tries his best to rearrange the Scrabble pieces in his mind into a coherent statement.  “I know,” he starts slowly, his gaze still fixed on his shoes.  Why are apologies so goddamn hard?  “I know you’re havin’ a rough time with the kid.  ‘N’ I’m sorry.”
“Alright.”  Sam shakes his hair away from his face and nods, like he’s made a decision.  Dean tries not to hear the smirk in his voice.  They’ll have a conversation about this later, he knows, and he’s not entirely interested in it.  But, for the moment, he’s glad that Sam is leaving it be.  “We’re heading to bed.  I’m beat.”
The corner of Dean’s mouth turns up.  “Yeah.  Hoped.  Not mucha that goin’ around these days, but, I dunno.”  Cas’s hands shifts to the base of Dean’s neck.  “This is all so fucked, Cas.  I mean, the end, y’know?  I told Sammy I liked the odds -- him ‘n’ me against Hell, but I gotta be honest with you, I’m not seein’ a way outta this.”
Sam squares his shoulders, taking offense to Dean’s comment. “What’s that supposed to mean? Cas is my friend, too.”
“You are a good man, Dean. But being a good man isn’t what wins a war. It’s the difficult choices that have to be made in the heat of it. The stomach-turning ones that seem horrendous no matter how you skew it.”
Dean shifts, reaching up to cradle the back of Cas’s head. His hair is soft against Dean’s fingers, and he finds himself excited at the prospect of running them through it whenever he wants. “Cas, look. I… I ain’t one for feeling’, but I gotta say, man, I… Hang on.” He fishes his phone out of his pocket and swipes at it.
Sam doesn’t make him repeat himself, and Dean’s thankful for that. “A vow?” Dean doesn’t even have to be looking at him to know the face he’s making. “What kind of vow?” Sam scoffs. “A vow of silence? Chastity?” Dean can hear the smirk in his voice. “Marriage?”
Cas bucks up into Dean’s hand and Dean honest-to-god whimpers.  He strokes them hard and fast, and Cas’s fingers dig into his skin.  They slip down his back, gripping Dean’s ass to pull him closer.  The movement provides more delicious friction.  Cas moans, and Dean wants to hear it again.  Dean loves that it’s all for him.  That
“Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms. Barefoot on the grass, listening to my favorite song.
The confession settles around them, and Cas is quiet for a moment.  Bracing his weight on one hand, he presses the other to Dean’s chest.  Settled above his heart.  “I’m stronger than I’ve been in a long time.  I have to do what needs to be done, but you don’t need to worry about me.”  He sighs, dropping his forehead against Dean’s.  “Dean… I’m here.  I just need you to let me all the way in.”
need you.  I’ve been too fucking scared to say it.  To say it out loud.  But I can’t do any of this without you.  And I--”  Those fucking tears are back, and he turns his head away to compose himself.  “I remember the downward spiral when I had the Mark of Cain.  That darkness I felt every time I hurt someone.  Killed someone.  And I saw what you did to him, and--and--and I got scared, Cas.  Scared I was gonna lose you.  Like I lost myself.”
“Yeah,” Dean says, his eyes still fixed on Cas.  “Night, Sammy.  Eileen.”  Sam waits a beat, then takes Eileen’s hand and finally leaves, and Dean drags in a breath.  His heart is racing, and he wonders if Cas can hear it.  Suddenly, the panic room makes him feel too vulnerable, remembering what happened here.  “Can we--”  He stops and clears his throat.  “Can we talk in my room?”
But Dean isn’t angry. Just minutes ago, he was the shadow of a ghost of a person. Now, Castiel sits on the floor beside him, and the angels in Heaven have finally gotten a break from his relentless invocation. Because on the sixth day, Jack saw what he had done, and it was good, so morning came. Morning came at two o’clock on a Thursday afternoon when Castiel brought the first sunrise into the Bunker.
“Nice place you got here, Cas,” Dean says after he realizes he’s been silently investigating for more than a few seconds now.
It prompts Castiel into action. He moves his cupped hand from the crown down to hold Dean’s erection at its base, to steady it upright as he puts his lips against the slit. He parts them just enough to let his tongue pass through, and he laps softly at the precome gathering in the divot.
Dean shakes his head and keeps walking. That’s how you get out of shit like this. Look forward, look busy, keep walking. “That’s real nice of you, but I gotta be on my way. Have some pretty important errands to run.” He can’t remember what kind of honey the pink one was. He needs to know what the pink kind was.
It makes Castiel want to reach out and hold him. It is a shining little urge that wakes under his skin, has slept there for years with the knowledge that he wasn’t allowed to act on it. The idea of touching like that is born from a place of absolute desperation and nothing less. At least, it has been. But Castiel thinks about the hug he shared with Sam and Dean last night, the way Dean had pulled him in simply to comfort him. He thinks he is tired of reserving hugs for the moments before death and the moments right after.
He can feel the disbelief radiating off of Cas at his response, and is almost impressed when all Castiel has to say is, “Dean,” in that soft tone he has. That soft tone he only uses on Dean.
Dean could probably tell Sam, and Sam probably wouldn’t laugh at him. At least not until he was stable enough to handle it. But this is all too much, too close, and so unsure that it feels like even saying the words into the air would bring the whole thing crumbling down. Because Cas is- Cas is something special, something that you don’t just stumble on every other day. Smart and so genuine it hurts until there’s nothing to Cas but honesty. Until Cas’s honesty makes Dean’s entire existence look like a sham of a performance for the masses.
Dean slows Baby to a trot as they approach the turn off from the trail that he knows will loop him back to Jody’s. He pets down Baby’s mane. “Thanks for your help, sweetheart. Don’t tell anyone, but I think you give better advice than most human beings.”
“Obviously that worked out well,” he sneers. “Fucking four years old and raising a baby ‘cause my dad was too drunk to stand up straight. And trying-” Dean’s voice catches over the words again with emotion that he’s gotten too far ahead of himself to regulate- “trying so damn hard for Sam, so that he could be okay. Keeping those fuckers in town away from him. Making sure he ate his stupid vegetables even when he didn’t want to. I-”
Castiel looks around, and tries to understand why he deserved to live somewhere as wonderful as this.
Unthinkingly, he raises his hand to the spot on his cheek that Finley had kissed and the corner of his mouth ticks up. He looks down at the sketchbook in his lap and the drawing of Cas and Charlie looks back at him. Dean wishes he were as brave as Finley seemed to think he is, but the idea of handing the drawing to Cas knots his stomach. No, this was for Dean. This was so that Dean wouldn’t forget the way two of his favorite people looked together.
Dean can hear the breath that catches in Cas’s throat, feels the way that Cas’s fingertips pet fragile along the hollow of his cheek. “This body- I know that it’s not-”
“You should get back to them.” Finley bumps their shoulders together. “You wouldn’t want to waste your whole night teaching nosey teenage girls how to draw.”
“Dean, angels don’t have genders. I don’t produce testosterone or estrogen the way humans do. I’m not even truly a man, though I’ve come to like the identity of this vessel through the years. I am as similar to Eileen as I am to you. And besides, testosterone isn’t to blame for the fact that you and Sam are emotionally inept. It’s the reason you have facial hair, not the reason you mock each other.”
Sam’s response earns him a soft smile from Cas, seemingly satisfied. “That’s very nice, Sam. It’s a good feeling. I’m glad that you get to experience it again.”
Nudging his chin in Dean’s direction, the farmer adds, “I’m assuming that light from down here was you?”
“It- It says here that swans spend the majority of their time preening themselves with a wing oil that helps their feathers remain waterproof, so that they can take off to fly at a moment’s notice. Apparently, this waterproofing is extremely important for a swan’s survival.”
But Castiel’s name isn’t. Castiel isn’t limited to anything, where the memory of him naps in Dean’s stomach.
But Cas’s words about there being more to this ASMR thing ignite that dangerous spark of curiosity in Dean once again, and he rotates Cas’s phone to look through the suggested videos. Many of them have thumbnails of similar setups to the video he’s watching, even if there’re different people featured in them. He looks at the titles, frowns when the same word keeps reappearing in them.
And then Cas is peeling away back out into the open. He takes all of the soft calm with him, all of that sturdy home, leaving Dean emptier for it. A hole in a hole is just a bigger hole. Dean is held together by unforgiving threads of himself that feel a lot lousier now that Cas isn’t a part of them. He looks at the moon a few feet in front of him. Clears his throat and pretends he’s not experiencing internal collapse. He’s gotten really good at it.
Cas’s mouth is still right there against Dean’s neck, and he kisses it tenderly again before he continues speaking. “In my dream, you had built a nest for us here, in my living room. It was very big. It took up the entire room and it was constructed from twigs that were many feet long and made of solid gold. But it was soft when you laid down on it. The dream rather implied that that’s where we had sex.”
He stops. Suddenly, Castiel is so tired, exhausted in a way that sleep can't fix. Bone deep when he thinks about the things that The Swans endure daily at the hands of an insatiable population, and how they are not people the same way that Castiel is a person. Until they are untouchable. Not only can Castiel not touch but the Swans cannot be touched in return.
Oh my god. It’s a song about cowboys. Literally right there in the title. Maybe this won’t be all that bad at all.
Just when it almost feels too good, and the rough slide of Cas’s callouses have him on the brink of telling Cas to get a move on or they’re not gonna get to the final event, Cas’s hand stills. It grips almost painfully tight around the base of his cock, staving off the way Dean’s body was working itself up, and Dean outright moans. It’s loud and desperate where it echoes off of the concrete walls. He throws his head back into the resistance of the pillow under his head.
That actually makes Castiel pause. Does he want to act on it? Is there even anything to act on? Certainly, the separate components of why Castiel wants, as confusing as they are, are there. But maybe they are just that: components. Maybe they are puzzle pieces to an idea that never becomes assembled. Maybe they sit in their box and collect dust.
Dean huffs a humorless laugh and slumps forward on himself. “You really believe that?” Underneath the bitterness of his words, there’s a soft sort of hope.
tinny acoustics seem to be a new permanent fixture, like the map table or the telescope that no one ever uses.
“Yes,” Castiel repeats, lets his lips touch the shell of Dean’s ear, “you are so good. In every way, you are worth worshipping. I’ll keep telling you, now that I can, and I won’t stop. So good, Dean. I can feel how hard you are, how you ache when I say it. Would you like me to say it again?”
This time, Castiel catches the nipple between his thumb and index finger to pluck at it gently. He massages the area with fingertips before holding the nipple again with just enough pressure to pull it upwards. Castiel lets go in favor of running soothing fingers across it. Dean’s growing erection twitches.
She puffs an amused laugh from his back. “No,” she confirms quietly, happily, “Anna doesn’t mind at all.”
A gentle breeze starts through the trees and rustles their leaves in quiet song. It’s a whisper of a thing. Cas could be that wind, Dean thinks. He doesn’t feel like crying but his eyebrows pull up like he’s going to anyway, his bottom lip shaking. Because here he’s been so worried, so caught up in distancing himself from- from whatever this thing between him and Cas is because Cas is a dude and Dean is a dude and he’s never- he shouldn’t- even though he wants- and he never even realized that somehow he started feeling things about a warm light on the inside of that male body that Dean maybe likes a little bit too much in the first place. A warm light that can give hugs goodbye, a moon that uses emoticons in texts. Dean’s best friend.
It doesn’t take Dean long to figure out what Cas is talking about, the memory of that terrible week ringing out clear as day. “You mean a few years ago when Sammy had the stomach flu?”
“There,” Castiel murmurs reassuringly. “It’s done. I’m right here, Dean.” He removes his fingers from Dean’s forehead and passes his hand through Dean’s hair.
There’s a long silent moment as though Cas is thinking. Dean watches him pick at the rinds of his already-eaten clementine the way he does when he’s displeased.
He presses his lips to the very corner of Cas’s mouth. The kiss is dry and hesitant. Cas is stock-still underneath him, but he’s got a hand clinging onto the bend of Dean’s elbow. Dean pulls back and kisses his cheek, pulls back and kisses the skin just below his eye, a quiet noise with each one, and then moves to the other side to repeat the process. Every time his lips meet Cas’s skin, the angel’s breath catches.
So Castiel leans in to capture Dean’s lips gently as his hand moves to cradle the back of Dean’s neck for just a brief moment before he pulls away again. Still, he can’t resist leaving one more kiss on the corner of Dean’s mouth.
For a second they just look at each other, upside down in the other’s eyes from the angle. They share matching shy smiles. Dean’s still not used to how much he’s been smiling these days. Smiling because he means it.
Dean lowers his body until his chest is just inches over Castiel’s. He leans down to catch lips again and Castiel’s body relaxes into the soft grass. This is better, he thinks, because I don’t have to focus on anything as mundane as sitting upright. And Dean’s body is so warm and he smells like the clean air of a barbershop. Castiel wants to feel him everywhere.
Dean isn’t sure for how long exactly, but it’s long enough for his muscles to relax, for his fear to settle out of him. He never wants to forget the way that Cas smells.
Not this. Not that look that’s burned its way into Dean’s brain. His gut lurches, but Cas is already talking again.
The chorus repeats and then Taylor is on about making rich people fall in love with her even though she’ll never love them back. It’s almost like the lyrics are so relatable to Dean that they’re not again, like they’re no longer something to project onto, but a mirror held to his face. Just stating facts.
He clears his throat and it does laughably little to help his situation. “Um-” his voice breaks over the syllable. “I get ‘em every once in a while, ya know? They’re sorta like flashbacks, I guess, to when I was a kid. It’s not even like they’re bad dreams- ‘cause they’re memories, how could just memories be a bad dream? But they’re so real, I just-” His voice breaks again and he swallows. After a pause, he speaks again more steadily, “When I wake up, it’s like I forget that she’s gone. It’s the remembering that’s- that’s the bad part.”
And then Cas is walking closer, reaching up so that his fingers graze the stubble on Dean’s cheek. Dean’s eyes flutter shut and he swallows hard.
Cas looks at him like he’s ten kinds of crazy, but there’s a delight there that Dean has never seen before, like Cas is glowing from the inside.
, how-?” Dean’s voice is as whiny as Castiel has ever heard it, weak and rough. He knows what a privilege it is to experience it.
Because it’s not sad but it’s so… real. It’s dragging claws on sunburnt skin. He knows it’s true, and maybe that’s why it feels so awful.
“Right,” Dean nods, keeps walking. This is about to go very badly. He should’ve thought about this a little bit more. “Not right,” he decides and digs his heels into the dirt.
Cas, on the other hand, lights up in realization, and he seems relieved that Dean isn’t in distress. “Of course,” Cas says confidently, fondly, “I should have realized being the only one naked may be strange.”
Dean can just tell, can feel Cas watching him, and if he weren’t so used to the stares and so familiar with the shaving process, he’d probably nick himself with shaking hands. As it stands, he keeps with the tempo of shave, rinse, repeat, and pretends he doesn’t know Cas is looking at him. Because Cas is allowed to look at him. Because they’re together.
“Hello,” Cas repeats. The angel leans in over him and presses his lips to Dean’s forehead like a mother kisses her baby, then to either upside down cheek the way that the French greet each other, and then, finally, to Dean’s lips the way that a person kisses their lover.
The tears flow even faster now, and Dean knows better than to try to fight them like he did before. It just makes his throat and eyes burn more with useless tension that feels out of place now that Cas has cleaned up shop.
It’s like the whole world narrows down. Dean finds himself nodding before he even knows he’s doing it, like he’s in a trance. When he realizes he’s just staring and nodding and not saying anything, he fumbles out, “Yeah- yeah, ‘course, Cas. Just thought, ya know, you said it’s been a while since you’ve been to one of these things. Maybe you should take another swing at it with us.”
So there’s a slick, cool finger that circles Dean’s hole. It doesn’t push in yet, just sorta pets the area as Cas kisses his thigh again. “Relax for me, please,” Cas says all politely.
,” Dean draws the word out in obvious question. “I mean, that’s good, right? That they help you. Am I missing something?”
Finally, “Cas, I’m terrified, man,” Dean admits. He is turned away as he says it, but the line of his shoulders is tense. All of the events of the past, the memories that had been taken from Castiel, are now painfully evident in the way Dean holds himself. Castiel feels his heart break, if only slightly
That lump in Dean’s throat makes a reappearance and he takes a deep inhale of Cas’s Heaven smell like a reminder. That Cas is close and his. After all this time, Cas is finally his. As if sensing Dean's squirming emotions, Cas runs a flat palm down against Dean’s hair all the way to the back of his neck. He keeps up an easy rhythm as the song continues. Dean wonders how something so small could be so soothing, how a hand in his hair would feel like a miracle. He doesn’t come to a conclusion, but he lets himself drift on the touch, on Taylor’s voice.
They don’t hit the hard stuff anymore, they don’t need to, but when Dean started his exploration in baking, Eileen started her own in mixology. She was getting almost too good, Dean thought, reminding himself that he should be sipping on the drink and not downing it because he can barely taste the alcohol.
“Right, right, I mean, so do I. But- uh- Sam, I’m gonna be honest with you man. I already know it’s gonna lay me on my ass, like, Eat Me! Alice crying a sea full of crustaceans.”
“And I- if whatever small fragment of emotion I still hold onto is anything to go by,” Castiel pauses, steels himself, and makes himself meet Dean’s weighted gaze, “I’m sure that I loved you very much.”
Dean continues to watch and finds himself absorbed in her gentle movements, the sound of her soft hair pulling through the bristles. It makes everything in him take pause, like his whole body is stopping to absorb the moment. He feels a smile tug onto his lips.
“Yes,” Cas agrees from behind him, “I’m rather fond of it myself.” Then his voice is closer when he adds, “You should sit, Dean,” with very little wiggle room in his tone. Jesus, Dean must be looking even more banged up than he thought.
Dean huffs out a laugh when the last stroke of the razor leaves his neck clean. Only Cas. And once again, Dean feels struck down by the openness. “Yeah? How come?”
“I double”- here, Dean draws a two- “everything to make sure I have enough pancakes to feed everyone, so keep that in mind. Keep in mind that all of the measurements I tell you are double”- another two- “the original recipe, R-E-C-I-P-E.
There’s nothing lazy to their movements at all, not anymore, when Dean is set on bringing Cas over the edge, on bringing this strong body under him to the pleasure that it very rightly deserves. Now, Cas meets Dean just as enthusiastically, like his hips have a mind of their own and won’t take Castiel’s unnecessary worry for an answer.
Dean doesn’t even have it in himself to downplay it. “It was fucking awesome, Cas. God, best sleep I’ve had in, hell, in decades! A whole ten hours,” he lets out a whistle. “I think that may be a world record for me. Whatever miracle juice you injected into my brain, dude, you gotta give some to Sammy. Lord knows the kid could use it.”
“Then why am I talking to you two knuckleheads?” she cries. “Hand the phone to the angel, if you would, Samuel.”
The laughing turns to crying before Dean can even track the shift. Little tears running down his cheeks and not enough air in his lungs. He watches Cas’s smile fall while Cas slowly sits up straighter.
Finley fidgets. “I mean, I’m working on getting better at portraits and stuff but… This is gonna sound bad.”
, “you will have to trust me when I say that your father most likely did far worse things to both of your psyches than simply giving you complexes, but he certainly did that, too. Starting with the inability to express emotion without being shamed for it. So, while perhaps you imagine yourself to be emotionally competent, you still went out of your way to both point out and belittle Dean’s need to cry.”
“Well,” Dean grins. Then he’s pulling away from Castiel’s atmosphere to grab at his own shirt and remove it with little fanfare. The process takes approximately one-fourth the time that Castiel’s shirt removal did. “I realized that it might actually be weirder for both of us to mutually have our dicks out while our shirts are still on.”
It’s peaceful here, in the middle of nowhere, where one of the many forests on the outskirts of the kingdom dampens the noise of its population and leaves only the sound of chirping birds. The apiary sits in a broad clearing among the basswood trees that fill the air with the sweet aroma of their flowers. The grass underfoot is nitrogen-rich, so soft that you could nap in it. Sometimes, Castiel is tempted.
And it turns out that Dean had gotten through all the hard parts of the song, anyway, because the chorus just repeats as a twanging guitar and harmonica play out Taylor repeating,
“Dude!” Dean exclaims before his brain catches up with his mouth. There’s no use trying to be covert now, so he turns and stares at the guy. “Who drinks whiskey like that?”
It’s actually not about crying in front of people in a bad way at all… but that maybe, sometimes, crying can feel so good that he wants to do it alone.
But before she can move to step away, Dean finds himself saying, “You can always say hi. If you see me around, I mean.”
“Right,” Dean says. He nods to himself and tries to believe that Cas means it when he says he’s going to stay. “Right, and Jack, he brought you back?”
“But I’m ailing,” Charlie emphasizes before coughing pitifully into her elbow. It’s a fake cough that grows into a real one that has Dean’s face softening even as he pretends to roll his eyes.
“Your hard cock,” there’s an overwhelmed, reverent note in his tone that he can’t stomp out, “knowing it’s for me. It’s so pretty, Dean. Yes, pretty.” Castiel nuzzles his nose right up against the side of Dean’s erection. “Your hot… hard… pretty cock.”
Castiel wants to wrap himself around him. Dean’s freckles stand out across his nose. He is so warm, warmer still now that Castiel remembers everything the man has gone through to get to this exact moment.
“Good morning, Dean,” Cas says like he feels lucky he gets to say it at all. Dean understands the sentiment.
Sure enough, Sam’s giant frame enters the room. Dean doesn’t bother looking up at him, but he doesn’t reload the gun either, just starts to dismantle it like a nervous habit to avoid eye contact.
, hips swaying back and forth because he can, because sometimes he gets tired of pretending anything these days. It’s still hard, but he’s trying to leave the pretending behind with the lost, lonely version of him that stopped existing after Jack became God and brought Cas back. Home.
The walk is familiar now. Past familiar, the wheat and wildflower view that leads into a blue forest is just as welcoming as his own home. And the songbirds have been perfecting their finale, each note and melody they whistle ringing out in harmony and perfect dissonance so that the air itself is the stage.
The headphones are connected to Cas’s actual phone, which is turned horizontally in his hands like he’s watching a video. Does Cas even know how to watch videos on his phone? Whatever he’s looking at has him absorbed because he doesn’t even acknowledge Dean’s presence until Dean sits down across from him.
“Absolutely.” But Dean doesn’t stop the slow movement of his hand. The reaching out to touch isn’t so scary now that he’s done it. When Cas is like this, too, it doesn’t feel so unattainable. Easy enough to reach out to a light, much harder to reach out to a person with facial expressions that can give away annoyance, disgust. Eyes that can meet Dean’s and can see every pathetic wanting written so plainly in them.
Dean brings his wing back towards his body and Ella stares at it. She looks at the wing, then at Dean, then at his wing again like she’s trying to figure out exactly what’s happening. Dean waits patiently for the question he can sense building in her mouth.
The words come out mean. They’re coated in guilt and confusion, and make Dean fracture right down the middle. When he opens his mouth to respond, nothing comes out. Cas watches his mouth open and close like a fish, and deflates, looks away again as he relaxes back into the chair.
There’s a small gaggle of girls in front of the stall overflowing with fresh flowers to Dean’s left, and they watch him while he walks by.
When Cas hits the lights, they illuminate the white tile floor and blue walls of the room. On the far wall is a shower, and to the right, a sink and toilet. They approach the shower together and step in already naked. Cas turns on the tap so that water falls down over them.
“I want it to be him, Linden,” Castiel finally confesses wetly as looks out to the empty water and imagines a swan there. “I want it to be Dean that holds my hand. He is- he is my favorite.” Some of that ripping sadness leaves Castiel with dredges of bittersweet softness. “I suppose that’s the most important part. Somehow I could not enjoy his company more even at the same time that I want to-” he shakes his head.
The flowers choke him. “I don’t really know about that, Cas.” It’s supposed to be sort of joking, so Dean doesn’t understand why it sounds like he’s about to cry.
Sam smiles. He does that a lot. Dean doesn’t. “Alright, Cas. You want one of your clementines while I’m over here? You usually eat them when Dean makes pancakes. Something about the citrus and the cinnamon, I don’t know, you talk about it a lot.”
. He was just laying there on the ground, and then he looked up at me and told me it’d be so poetic if I killed him. Told me I was the ultimate killer.”
The worst part is, Dean can’t even really find it in himself to be mad about it. Well, he could, he knows he could, but what a fucking joke it would be to pretend that he was actually angry when it’s just that anger happens to be easy. But he’s not angry. And nothing about existing right now is easy.
“He’s been through things, things that pain me to even think about. Burdens that he never deserved to bear. But he bore them so resiliently that-that I wonder how he ever did it. How he came out the other side still being able to love strangers more intensely than some love their own kin. But he has hardened, too. It would be impossible not to be hardened, with the things that he has witnessed.”
“You know,” he says, and is surprised when his voice comes out rusty. He clears his throat. “practice makes perfect. I didn’t even get to do the hair stuff.”
As Castiel continues to speak, he notices Charlie’s eyes drooping, getting heavier with every blink. A minute later she yawns.
He bets they look like idiots. Two naked grown men, dicks swinging, one of them clinging to the other. Dean doesn’t really care though because Cas’s big hands are riding just below his bare ass. He rests his head on Cas’s shoulder again.
“Look at those clowns,” Eileen says through an amused laugh of her own. “Worse than two kids on a playground.”
Finally, Cas says, “They weren’t a very good family, but they were my family nonetheless. My brothers and sisters.”
Anna laughs. “Then I guess we’re not having Christmas dinner at your place.” She holds Castiel’s hand. “I’m glad you and Dean have each other. The holidays can get a little lonely.”
“Hmm, right,” Dean says sarcastically and purses his lips, “then maybe it’s about the fact that you actually got your memories back this morning and didn’t tell us, then just pretended to get them back again later when you faked a Wipe Out in the kitchen.”
“This mouth is so lovely, Dean. Pink and inviting.” His gut tugs. “Hot… and damp.” His breath shakes. “You can’t close it. You can’t keep me out. You wouldn’t wish to keep me out, even if you could. It becomes irresistible.” Castiel grows harder and he hasn’t done anything yet, but even the thought of what he will do next-
Cas seems to sense some of his distress, because his chiming tone is oddly comforting when he replies, “They’re just stars, Dean.” And when Dean barks a watery, disbelieving, manic sort of laugh, Cas repeats all steady in vibrations like rain falling, “They’re only stars. Big burning masses of hydrogen and helium. That’s all they are.”
“Yeah, that sounds about right,” he finally answers. When Dean doesn’t get a response after a second, he sighs. “You can come in, ya know.”
“You stupid, stupid son of a bitch!” And he cries in violence. He cries like something’s wrenching out of him and maybe it is.
Around them, the bedroom shudders from some invisible force. Dean can feel the whole mattress shaking, hear the items on the shelf behind him rattling around and clanking together. He ignores it.
He skips the come of Dean’s chest in favor of shuffling down the bed to Dean’s ankles. He starts with the left leg first, works all the way up to the edge of his hip, before starting on the other hip and working his way back towards the right ankle.
But Dean is saved from having to reply by Cas’s hand trailing down over his ribs to the waistband of his boxers and petting the skin just above them. “I would like to remove these if you are comfortable with that.”
“Yeah,” he finds himself saying, “I think I know what you mean.” More silence, but it’s the settling kind instead of the tense kind. “So this guy- I mean, I hope it’s a guy- I, uh, look like him?”
“Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold your horses, pal. It sorta feels like we’re having two different conversations here. What are- Cas, look at me.” Dean shoves at Castiel’s shoulder and the sudden force actually startles him enough to follow Dean’s order. His face is all tight confusion and he’s frowning. “What are you talking about?”
