Minutes passed and the seemingly possessed hunters began advancing slowly toward them, ducking behind cover to cover.  They attempted to communicate, but whatever took over them pulled their voices from under them, leaving them with only grunts and shrill surreal growls to communicate amongst themselves.  The hunters were outnumbered and Dean just used their last move, whatever the hell it was.  Sam batted at his brother’s shoulder and mouthed the two syllable solution largely at him.  Dean shook his head hesitantly at first, but his eyes were pulled back up to his brother’s pools of brown logic and he gritted his teeth.  With a clenched jaw, he looked up at the ceiling and let the first syllable fly, “Ca-“
“A couple of him,” he joked timidly.
Dean had to tamp down his excitement in every motion, the overjoyed strut, the ecstatic flick of guiding hands, and the delighted hum threatening to burst from his throat.  Back in his manically cleaned domain, the water bubbled as the kettle filled and was set on the stove on medium high heat.  Cas sat cautiously quiet stroking one thumb against the other.  The urge to round up behind him and hug him tightly from behind would have been a welcomed sign of affection only a couple of months before.  The thought chafed him as Cas sat distant and unbothered mere inches from him.  Instead of fixating on it, he gathered honey from the fridge.  He placed it in the company of a teabag and the brown handmade mug they picked up in Tulsa courtesy a Mom and Mom knickknack shop they discovered while a large lunch settled in their stomachs.
“Not that this isn’t fascinating and all, but why are you telling us this now?” Dean’s arms fully crossed bolstering his alcohol thinned patience.
They looked at each other, then him.  Sam’s eyebrow leapt up and his neck craned forward a fraction.  “Cool?”
The minutes remaining in the day were diminishing almost as quickly as his bottle.  He had to go for broke.  “Let’s just say we get someone who not only believes in the business’s future but wants to help build it.  Theoretically if we found someone like that, wouldn’t that mean making it on time to pick up Claire right after school like the other parents?  Wouldn’t that mean a chance to cook dinner more often instead of grabbing take out?  Wouldn’t you have more time to just
“Because of the break in?”  He stepped forward, nearly crowding into Cas’s space but backed away when he lifted his arms defensively.
The pair communicated in micro winces and quarter smiles.  “There are a few factors to take into consideration.  Comet is more finicky, more expensive.  Columbus is basically a guaranteed win come harvest season.  We’ll have to get back to you.”
He shrugged his shoulders and scratched his calf with his other foot.
“With you?” he asked, unsure if the invitation was sincere.  After all, this was the only time he had shown any substantially interest.  Sure they had flirted on a handful of occasions, but there was a big difference between chirping and wooing.  This formal request felt distinctly more like courting.

First things first, he started the paltry coffee maker in the breakroom and checked his e-mails from the weekend.  They added and subtracted tasks from his never empty workload, but he had the lot sorted by lunchtime so he joined Benny and Starr on the first floor.  Sometime in the afternoon, his phone buzzed in his pocket, but he obstinately ignored it.  If Cas had pulled his head out of his ass to finally message, he would make him wait as long as he wanted before paying it any mind.
Sniffing out any more items out of place, he spotted the digital clock trundling time forward into the next hour.  Surely Cas was done showering but then.  Doomsdays scenarios projected against the inside of his skull sent him jogging back towards the bathroom to reassure himself.  The rigid soles of his boots squeaked against the laminate flooring outside, but a lower octave yip snuck out from under the door.  As soundlessly as he could manage, he crouched low and opened the door.  The bathroom was large enough that the variance in air pressure didn’t change that much when the door was ferreted open, but Cas still had extraordinary perception.  He closed the door behind him and strained his hearing.  A sniff, hiccup, sigh, and the smallest bleat echoed across the shower stalls. His heart wracked against his ribcage; its slow strong pulse raced into a frantic palpitation.  His fingers stretched out to collect the mournful angel several stalls away but halted when a delicate muttering sounded off of the tiled walls.  It wasn’t English or Spanish or Enochian or Latin or Greek or any other language he remembered Cas speaking.  For a reason he couldn’t nail down, it disturbed him even more.  While he tried to transcribe the consonants and vowels into a configuration he could remember, Cas shut off the water and stepped out from under it.
The look Sam gave Dean called his irritation to heel.
If he knew the sentiment would be understood, he could have given him a thumbs up and solved the mystery for him, but it wouldn’t be exactly right.  It wouldn’t amount to the hard won truth they both deserved.
A familiar and very welcome stiffness pressed against his abs ratcheting the spring of his own arousal tighter.  He sat up as tall as he could and lifted them him up briefly to match his every protrusion to his recesses.  Cas’s moist hot breath bounced off of his lips as his unbroken gaze coiled his very essence around his center protectively.  Cas had him in his web and there was nowhere else he would rather be.
The last straw was his beloved laptop he just upgraded to the year before.  That insufferably buggy tablet style computer was handed off to Cas who just borrowed whatever device wasn’t in use by the hunters beforehand.  Not a single key marker was worn or clunky from overuse on the relatively new computer.  With it closed under his arm, he passed by the room shared by the pair now.  Their efforts to keep each other’s passion laden noises to a minimum were appreciated, but not nearly as thorough as Sam would have expected.  His pace sped up as he passed their room, but he felt a painful zap on the center of his palm and he nearly dropped the laptop in surprise.  Once at his desk, he opened the lid to find it was just as dead as the phone in the kitchen the week before.  A pained mien beset him all at once calling back that same tertiary irritation.  They were bricking his electronics with their co-authored attempts at Sam’s nightmare fuel.  This was Sam’s punishment for getting in the middle.  Well to be fair there wouldn’t be a “them” without his prodding, but was this any way to repay him?
“Not at all, just…” He swigged his lager pivoting between his choices of words.  “They probably just don’t know how to treat me.  I’m not an employee per se and won’t be there every day after the two of you decide I have firm grasp on things.”
He canted his head in question but no guesses as to what any of that could have meant came to him.
Envelope one was from a woman he once regarded with measured affection.  If it were a proposal to return to the fold under certain stipulations – or under any stipulations he would enjoy lighting the wretched insult on fire.  Its heft made it seem unlikely.  The pages inside were folded more than twice, so a legal document was more likely.  He chuckled to himself entertaining the idea that it might be a restraining order.  It would do them both a favor.  On the other hand, if he couldn’t come within one hundred feet of a ‘family’ member, he couldn’t see Balthazar again.  Imagining such a fate tugged at his heart firmly enough that he pushed at his sternum to verify it hadn’t left his body entirely.  The second envelope scared him.
“How did you find that out?” Sam asked.
“Of course, rhetorically speaking, I could find our friend in any universe my father has his fingers in.  There’s a slight problem with using a fantastic tool with a fantastic tool such as myself as a bloodhound, though,” he said reclining onto his elbows, stretching his body out long for further examination.
By his downcast stare, the pointed absence of who he was referring to wasn’t lost on Dean.  “The work doesn’t scare me, Sam.”
“Witness accounts describe the Men of Letters as the titular Men in Black, right?  Well clearly they had a lot more than one uniform,” he explained smugly.
“Not with his words so much.  A few times now, he’s shared his thoughts with me.  The first time was yesterday.  He grabbed my hand and told me his name and where he comes from.  It felt like I was in twilight sleep and someone I’d known forever, trusted with my life talked to me.  I can feel things more clearly now, even talk to him back without moving my mouth.  We have a deep bond somehow.”
His gaze crawled up his body, leaving Dean chilled by its distant traversal.  “What’s that?”
An impressive line of overdressed couples and throuples peppered the manicured walkway in front of the meticulously lit restaurant façade.  Towering arbor vitae trees trimmed within an inch of their lives stood every five feet on either side of the door.  Once at the end of the queue, Dean stepped a few feet to Sam’s left and searched down the row of nipped and tucked socialites for their dining partner.  A handful of lone gentlemen stood adrift; mainly glaring at their phones in progressively more distress the closer they were to the end of the line.  One striking dark brunet man at the dead center of the line one hand wedged firmly in his front pocket while he squinted slightly at the phone in his other, the bright screen bleaching his eyeballs as if he answered a call well into the night.  The knitted brow appeared to be a resident feature, if Dean had to guess.  In his experience, such a stern expression was usually accompanied by a nicotine habit.  His blush pink full lips were accentuated by a brisk five o’clock shadow cast on his cheeks.  A light grey diagonal striped tie complimented his light blue button down and navy suit in a traditionally pleasing aesthetic.  Dean traced the light lines of his perplexed expression fondly, instantly curious about what such a classically handsome guy could be trudging through a mental marathon over.  Despite the fancy establishment, he appeared strangely out of place, maybe even a smidge uncomfortable.
His brother smirked for a brief second then returned to sit at the edge of the bed pensively.
“No, I happened across this,” he pointed at the pendant nestled under Dean’s shirt.  “You see, the agent had it, too.  Somehow it housed enough Grace to send me back.  I was astonished that I was oblivious to an artifact containing that much power in my immediate vicinity for so long.”
Maybe it was the relaxing swirl of lager or the seductive draw of sleep, but his mind wandered right past the intense incursion that hammered the final nail into his case’s coffin and to the brilliant blue of the stranger’s eyes.  He looked unmistakably calmer when Dean approached him.  As if being far from him was more disturbing than the bruised ribs.  Dean almost laughed at himself.  He knew virtually nothing about the guy, aside from his piercing blues swallowed his attention in a way that was entirely alien to him.  His tan skin was smooth under his touch as he helped him out of the hole, but not soft like the endless pencil pushers he shook hands with over the years.  His bottom teeth pinned his upper lip down as he recalled the foreign words branded across his ribs. He caught a glimpse of their black sharp edges while buttoning up his thin shirt in the cool early evening wind.  Maybe he was a tourist of some sort.  A firm grasp pulled his mind to rest once he buried the side of his face into his fluffy pillow.  Between the presenting his findings, following up with IT, and finding time to catch up with Sam on Silent-but-Sleepy’s situation, tomorrow’s Dean had his work cut out for him.
Sam tossed his head back and forth then squinted one eye pondering.  “It’s unlikely.  On top of the extra surveillance equipment that we had installed, one of us is on the property more often than not.  Bobby,” he stumbled with all the fear of a deer under the bright cone of oncoming high beams.  “Bobby knew!  He knew about the Men of Letters!”
Dean took the food containers out of their bags and motioned to the utensil drawer.  Cas nodded and trotted towards him.  Since their kiss a few nights before he stopped pretending a territorial bubble existed a couple feet from their bodies that repelled them from each other.  His feet brought him right up to his side.  He leaned over the prepared meal to inspect the quarry.  An exaggerated sniff pulled the scent of spiced meats and warm rice into his nostrils and Dean’s heartrate down from the excruciatingly long workday.  An intrigued eyebrow quirk drew a chuckle from the tired agent.  “What?  You don’t like Mexican?”
Sam stood up and made his way towards the lower level storage rooms.  A thought kept him planted in place a few steps away.  “If… when this works we are gonna have to start figuring out how to build more bridges, Dean.  One day, one of our knocks on an old enemy’s door is gonna bite us in the ass.”
Dean loosened his tight embrace enough to feel at the still irritating bites of emptiness in his belly.  Cas turned his gaze down to where his hands fled to.  A puzzled expression painted down his face, which Dean took to mean he thought he had removed all of his pain.  Dean shook his head and replied, “I just need some rest.  You did great, Cas.  A two man power nap certainly would fix what ails me faster, though.”  A nipping kiss met his lips and the same delighted hum propelled him in deeper.  Weaving affections played between their welcoming mouths, churning a joyful bliss within them neither could every remember feeling before.  Cas was the first to pull away, but not before finishing their kiss with the last peck.
“I don’t know if I can trust you with that kind of power yet,” he smiled.  “So how long does one book take you to write now?”
After the week of sitting in a lone chair before several evaluation committees full of OPR and departmental liaisons, his bespectacled boss floored him with the results.  Experience with Counter Terror and Criminal Investigation units gave him a skill set they were scouring every layer of the Bureau for.  A staggering number of cases fell in their laps over the years that required a dexterous hand and agile mind to solve that didn’t fit neatly into any one department.  They necessitated a strong background in their processes, clear communication, and a keen ability to think on one’s feet alone out in the field.  Another agent could be tapped to help with a case or two, but they offered him the job of a lifetime: follow whatever cases he wanted in this misfit pile as long as he towed the Bureau line.  These batches of oddball files were locked up in a file cabinet in the basement level of the building available only on printed hard copy.  They needed to be deniable yet incredibly difficult to uncover.  The higher ups didn’t want their contents to see a digital transcription until the case was solved - accompanied by a scientifically sound explanation.  His only goal was to lift the resolution rate from zero percent.  He would still report to Pileggi along with a handful of other advisors as his talents were requested or a new urgent case reared its head.
His eyes ran down the lines of Castiel’s face and up to the open doorway at the mouth of the kitchen.  “There may be more than one beer, maybe even a movie afterwards.  Pity I haven’t converted one of the rooms downstairs into a rec room yet.  A bit of an escape hatch from reality would be good for everyone.  I’d love to have a wet bar and a massive entertainment center down there.”
“Now then, gentlemen and Dean,” he jabbed savoring the annoyed eye roll from his partner.
Dean’s back stiffened.  His palms ventured to his knees and braced his shoulders back like unintentional scaffolding.  Regrets piled onto each other even before he spoke, testing its durability immediately.
He hung his head and replied, “That other Dean didn’t help out fast enough.  He couldn’t shelter you when you needed it the most.”
He nodded, weary satisfaction laced below his bangs.  “Didn’t make it past the dinosaur on the school playground.”
=====================
One final e-mail remained come late that afternoon.  Since clearing a major case most agents found a reason or two to head home early for the day or find a bar to celebrate at with coworkers and supervisory approval.  Dean however was only lucky enough to finish clearing his inbox when a call came in from Sam.  Surprised as Sam had resorted to communicating strictly through images of the stranger in varying states or unconsciousness, Dean answered the call quickly.  “Sam, what’s going on?”
“Just human.  Our link became stronger even though I was frightened of its capabilities in my weakened state.  Who knows what he could have found rummaging around in my consciousness if I wasn’t constantly vigilant.  He could have damaged himself, so I tried to shut him out for a while.  When I wouldn’t allow it, he respected the decision.  He would patiently wait me out,” he smiled staring off into the echoing harmonics.  “In the meantime, we grew closer, physically.”
Once parked in his driveway, he found himself pinned down in his musings.  What if he escaped during the day?  Where would he even go?  Would he return to a picturesque white picket fenced home with Novak scrolled across the mailbox?  If this James person was so unwell, how would he not have picked up on the symptoms at any point since they met?  Oh, right.  Being mute really cuts down on the likelihood of saying something suspicious, he almost laughed at himself.
Ketch’s eyes glanced over the food spread over the kitchen surfaces, lingering on the double sets of plates and napkins.  He looked around openly searching for another person.
Jostled out of his reverie by a buzzing buried under three reports, he lifted and shifted until he found his work phone.  It rested in a battle hardened brown synthetic leather case with a stretch of duct tape across the back that read “NOT CIA”.  It appeared that the other Winchester needed something bad enough to call.  Either that or he didn’t feel like coding their texts with something innocuous like getting together for drinks or just late night jogging practice or whatever.
“What is it?”
Twisted to a quarter of the way, Jo broke the pantomimed silence.  “I’m a big girl, Dean.”
“For fuck’s sake,” he whined.  “Fucking fuck me, Cas!”

Cas flinched at the venomous response, more bewildered than ever.  Strong arms wound around his shoulders and pulled his whole body close.  Bated breath cooled after a moment.  The grave misunderstanding they trudged under for so long wouldn’t crumple under on its’ own weight.  Stupefied at the Angel impossibly captured in his embrace, he inhaled his breezy scent borrowing his unwavering resilience one more time.  Dean curled an arm around his side and pulled their foreheads together, their immutable physical connection fueling his resolve.  “No more feeling around in the dark, Cas.  I’m here with you, right here right now,” he breathed out heavily and rolled his forehead slightly with heavy eyelids.  “I won’t wait any longer.  I can’t take another day seeing you here but feeling you far off.”  The hand about his neck drifted down to his cheek and thumbed the corner of the angels chapped lower lip.  His jack rabbiting heart permeated warm tension in the limited space between them.  The thumbing of his soft lip didn’t drive him off so he closed his eyes completely and took his chance to demonstrate to his angel how he indeed glowed the way Cas wanted him to.  The inches separating them diminished sweetly among the delicious mix of mounting tension.  His guiding hand pulled sideways to brush against his perpetual 5 o’clock shadow making him Cheshire grin.  The warm pink lips under his pushed forward to end the sweet torment.  A decadent hum quaked against his chest curbing his forceful heartbeat.  His arm about the angel’s waist pulled the angel flush against him abjuring the last notion of second thoughts and warring indecision from either of their minds.  The angel’s hands flew to the hunter’s shoulder and palmed the hand upon his face.  An undeniable need flushed their cheeks and tongues split open lips to slide against the other.  The soul’s glow spread over the angel’s diminished Grace like a lighthouse mounted in a squall raging from the ocean’s lost depths.  Every crest it touched filled the angel with jubilation, coaxing the Grace to burn along his irises.  Sensing power somewhere around him, Dean pulled away just enough to see a clearest sky’s blue shining before him.  He withdrew his tongue and placed a chaste kiss on Cas’s lips.  Unabashedly showing Cas his version of impossible truth made his soul swell with pride in his efforts.  “Can I have you, Cas?”
His brisk pace towards the door remained unimpeded.  He called back from a distance, “That’s a problem for tomorrow’s Dean.  Gotta pick up dinner for Claire.”
Ketch pulled at his shoulder to turn him around to stare heatedly into his snarky face.  “If you weren’t so distracted by that man, you could have acted like my partner, not some obsessed rookie!  There was no case there!  I needed your help and you abandoned me!”
The lean core wrapped up in his grasp expanded and contracted in a humble chuckle.  “I know.”
“Can I tell Dean where you are?  I’m sure he’s gonna blow a gasket if you make him wait any longer,” he asked and tossed a thumb back towards the bunker door.
“It wasn’t an alien, Dean,” he said crushing any sense of joviality between his gritted teeth.  “Like that nurse said, maybe he’s part of a military experiment.”
“Oh, and cher?” Benny called upwards.
“Oh, come on,” he wrapped him up in a loose embrace.  “How about I hang around for a while after you read it and if you wanna talk about it we can, or if you want me to fuck off, I can do that, too.  However you want to handle it I got your back, okay?”
“When what started?”
, even when handling the delicate remains of their beloved dead, so anything would appear to be possible.”  She caught his eye roll, studying him with what looked reminiscent of affection.  “Thank you for bringing him back to us.  The family deserves the opportunity to put him to rest among his kin.”
A tongue swiped over the stranger’s bottom lip and he stared blankly.
“Plausible.  Anything else?” he rolled one hand or the other, propelling his partner to conclude with this charade to snoop around his house.
Castiel squinted at him, the door to his bewildered mind left ajar.  “Then this whole date was a pretext for… what?  Unearthing my abhorrent taste in B- horror movies?”
, he carded a hand through his hair and sighed.
Leisurely strides paraded them into Sam’s office long before he could milk any info out of him.  Dean sat in the chair opposite his desk and shrugged.  “I wouldn’t put it past the higher ups to try something unorthodox to get you desk mites to pump out reports faster.  Hell, it may not even hurt after some of those verbose 9 a.m. meetings we get stuck in.  I hardly subject myself to that sugary junk coffee anymore.  Think last time I had some they still had that fruity creamer.  Gawd, it was awful.”
’s later and he tripped into euphoria so bright it threatened to burn him from the inside out.  Cas gripped Dean’s meaty cheeks fully as he drank him down.  If Dean collapsed in the wake of such an orgasm’s draining body high, Cas surely would have caught him once again.
, he greeted welcomingly.
“Oh,” Cas thought out loud.
“I’ll be going then,” he turned back to the door.
The brothers looked up from the words in front of them to ask the same question.  Three fragmented nods later, Sam served it up, “Not too sure why we would need the secrecy of an office inside our own building.  Should we be having this conversation downstairs instead?”
Dean closed his eyes and inhaled the deep ozone scent anchored close before his nose and in reaction he snaked his body slightly around him.  It was the closest he had been to cuddling his friend, but he would take every inch he was given, especially if he didn’t have to drudge through a conversation about it later.  “Night, Cas,” Dean whispered into the back of his soft shirt.  Rhythmic slow breathes were the only response he heard before sleep pulled him firmly back into darkness.
“Kids are quicker to forgive.  The stakes of a kid’s friendship going sour are nil.  I bet you can’t even remember your best friend’s name when you were that age.”
The elbows fell away with an encumbered inhale.  “What’s that, Sammy?”
(See the end of the chapter for
The hunter stood ramrod straight with his hand in his jacket’s inner pocket as if to check for an out of sight secret.  His hair was styled cleanly, parted to the side like how he wore his own hair while in more formal disguise.  Freshly shaven, his demeanor carried notes of unwavering professionalism.  His dark blue jacket seemed to wear him, running a size too large over high-waist matching pants.  The starch collared white button up shirt also appeared to be a struggle, chocking him even with the top button undone behind his plain jane tie.  Looking down he spotted the source of the peculiar footfalls: a pair of black monk buckle shoes strapped to his feet.  As if shipwrecked on a timeless shore, he pivoted his weight from one foot to another and cleared his throat.  “May I come in, Castiel?”
With his soft cotton clothes slung over his shoulder, he exhaled deeply to calm himself before opening the door.   His friend leaned on one foot in front of him with eyes wide complemented by an almost undetectable flush atop his ears.  A car crashing into his living room couldn’t have pulled his eyes away from his slack jawed visage.  Blue eyes trailed down his torso momentarily before he cleared his throat.  Dean pulled the clothes from off his shoulder to grip them at his side if only to have something to do with his hands.
The cocksure expression was replaced by a cautious half smile.  “It literally just happened.  I really hope that’s the case, Sam.  If things go well enough, once we have the opportunity we’ll go take a gig far away for a while, give you a little peace. I don’t want it to get awkward for any of us.”
“I… I’m not sure.”  The struggle to keep his eyes off of his distressed love pulled more of his attention than Dean had anticipated.  Fuck, he must have had it bad.  Probably followed a half step behind him like a bezoar behind closed doors.
“I wouldn’t lie to you or Dean, but I need more than a handful of minutes to figure it out.  I didn’t know how to explain it to you, and I certainly have no idea how to explain it to Dean.”
“Daniel Loflin.”
“See ya round,” he called back with a slight blush sprinkled under his freckles.
He scowled at himself, but all at once he felt like his world was slowly tumbling upside down.  His perception wasn’t affected but his stomach dropped and his concentration petered out.  “What’s with the rollercoaster action?”
His silent companion resituated himself on his belly and rubbed his thumb absently on the edge of the navy suit jacket still in his grasp.  Relieving him of it only seemed to frustrate him further though, so the nurses let him keep it.  The sedative they forced upon him worked slower than expected and only seemed to draw him into an unfocused state while they checked him over.  A few bruised or fractured ribs and one hell of a concussion from what the doctor could tell.  The thumb continued to sway back an forth across an inch of his fine wool jacket. Was he trying to calm someone else or himself?  His cheek pushed into his nose and forced his mouth slightly open in his direction.  The smooshed features forced an exhausted smile out of the agent’s exhausted melancholy.  Poor guy must have just been caught at the wrong place at the wrong time, probably.  His battery appeared to be as depleted as the agent’s.
His head bobbed from side to side as if weighing each instance against each other.  “They each had their merits.  I must say the biggest positive in each column is that you, Dean Winchester, came to my aid.”
Sam reveled at making the fifth bottle crash and clang into the center of the recycling bin.  “Just a place I found the next town over.  They had a bunch of craft beers from out of state.  This one’s from Texas.  Austin, I think.  Good thing I didn’t have to take the... Oh shit,” Sam nearly belched up part of his festive salad.  His mouth twisted into a disgusted glower and he brought his right hand up to fist his solar plexus.
Castiel leaned back to rub his forefingers across his hairline as if to sooth an incoming migraine.  “It’s not appropriate first date conversation…”
Timorous concern slid from her cheeks when she faced her father head on with the crinkled page in her outstretched hands.  “This is our house,” she explained bursting with pride.
“Did you get some super potent blend at home then?  I saw that fancy grinder sitting out a while back.  You getting good use out of it?”
“A healer named Chrissa. The agent happened across evidence of a spell and tracked her down by who had access to all the components of it, or its native equivalent.  Not many people had it in abundant supply and the shop owner had loose lips.  The agent said she cast a spell to duplicate her infernal familiar and sent it loose after the parents to exact her revenge – standard done-me-wrong fanfare.  After he caught up with her, she said she had lost her “gifts” with the spell.  Her familiar couldn’t be recuperated.  She died shortly after being brought into custody.”
He shook his head and corralled his thoughts into something mimicking casual conversation.  “He has been very helpful thus far.  Unexpectedly friendly.”
Logically, his quest would benefit from sifting through his possessions for more clues as to where this newly seeded angel might go.  Jimmy didn’t appear to own much by way of hobbies other than photography equipment and his books, not many personal trinkets or any photos of familiars.  Guessing what this version of Cas was thinking was an endless loop of maybe’s and some how’s, so he chose the less invasive task of finding implements to leave his contact info.  The urge to gather intel dug into his gut again when he discovered a bookmarked journal or sketchbook propped up against the base of the lamp, but he forced himself to find a scrap of paper and pen on the workplace desk and finish his task.  Maybe if he was very lucky, this Cas would be weaker to the gravitational pull of curiosity than he was in that single moment.
“I choose projects based on community reach as well as depth of impact.  Both of my previous projects in Lebanon provided moderate depth of impact but had limited reach.  Only students can take advantage of tutors and only adults unable to find work can use a job counselor.  As stated by our friend Charlie, you two are looking to break out into the regional market: increase production volume, range of product distribution, and product variety.  This is a business looking to make a broader impact.  Byproducts of those dreams would be more gainful employment for local citizens and location based product recognition.”
He opened the door giving Cas one last twitterpated look before he closed himself out of his temperature controlled haven into the chill wind of a clear skied November afternoon.  The refuel certainly put a pep in his step, but he couldn’t decipher the glad song in his belly as anything other than active affection for the strange man.  As if he switched between channels, he caught an image flash across their link, the view out of the back patio door with the side table lamp and record player in view.  Cas must have tuned him into his current view out into his modest back yard.  From the small patio to the retaining wall, there was only about ten feet of grass to manage.  Part of him hoped Cas would help him with it come summer, possibly even plant some variety of indestructible tree that could live without the constant care of an overworked federal employee.  But hey, if he was still around to soak up all that sunshine, he could help it thrive in turns with Dean as well.  A warm pulse fed across their link as he visualized them getting their hands dirty in the backyard.
Cloudburst pounded the roof of his steel framed behemoth at the end of the parked precession.  Every car parked in the half circle driveway of the loathsome frivolous iron gated estate cost more than his home half a state away.   To the left, he looked down at the pitch black pavement just outside his window sure it wouldn’t melt his shoes at his first step, but the closer one got to the mouth of hell, the hotter then stones underfoot became.  The sentiment made him roll his eyes.  Being overdramatic would only make the interaction more stressful, keep him off his game.  The people inside knew him as stoic, previously loyal to a fault, not sarcastic and conniving.  He knew better, he
“There were measures put into place to roll each part of his estate into a singular account except one.  The finalized will contained all of his business properties, everything he collected income from.  The loan was taken out on the one asset he had that didn’t.”
Their fingers intertwined filled with giddy waves of energy.  “Putting all that aside, you know how difficult it is for me to unload all that on you.  Suppose keeping it in comes with the territory, stiff upper lip and such.”
“He’s been gone for like nine hours.”
“It’s… complicated, but I’m used to that though.  I never had the chance to meet Bobby Singer, but I think I would have liked him.”
“Ketch knows and he hasn’t even seen you two in a room together,” he peeled the label off of his beer bottle.
“No burgers with fries, huh?” he mused.  The stranger’s shoulders dropped like he had mentioned his favorite forbidden past time.
Uneven footfalls pattered to the door and it opened quickly.  Mick stood primarily behind the door unshod, noticeable thinner with a high fade.  He smirked at the brown bagged offering and waved him in with a meek smile.  Sam’s eyes darted to the floor as he crossed the threshold but right back up to the false bravado Mick attempted to exude.  He took the food from Sam so he could take off his shoes, careful to cushion the space between them awkwardly.  He denuded the food and drink from their vestiges, but left them sealed on the countertop.  The silence between them percolated anxiously, but neither one was eager to ask the first question, to strike the first blow.
“Like telepathy?  An actual mind-to-mind non-verbal exchange?”  He sat up a little straighter.
The light dimmed behind him as he opened his eyes.  The angel walked confidently through the doorway and into Dean’s space.  The timid nature of his smile foisted his surreal company into the forefront.  This casually dressed version of his love hid his hands in his jean pockets and observed him distantly.
He tapped away at his phone while performing his best impression of the pedantic little brother.  “But just outside the door or in a bouncing car parked at the curb was a whole other story.”
“Once I found the right words with Bobby, I let Claire’s big blue eyes do the rest of the talking.  She had them wrapped around her little finger inside a week.  As she grew, Bobby visited us in Kansas City as often as he could, but it was really Sammy that stepped up to the plate to help me raise her. Sam said it was only fair since I helped raise him, but I didn’t have the luxury of fighting him on it.  In a few short months I went from a small town mechanic to a single father in a big city with very little to smile about other than family.  It was the hardest thing I’d ever done, raising my little girl without Lisa, and I thank god everyday Claire doesn’t feel her absence, doesn’t see her family as incomplete.  But like Bobby always said, ‘family don’t end in blood’ and she is surrounded by so many people I consider family.”  The impulse to call Cas out as part of their family was there, but as first date conversations go, it would have been premature and presumptive.  Instead, he shot him a warm grin, hoping the sentiment was received.
Tan hands searched for solace in each other but retreated deep into his holey pockets.  “Family is a good approximation, but in our futures we both see each other, forgoing the companionship of anyone except each other.  That makes our bond beyond that of brothers in arms, beyond confidants, past best friends, past eternal allies.  When you lie in my arms at night, I want to surround you in my affections, bathe you in the same glow you make me feel.  I want to kiss your woes away and give you anything in my power even before you ask.  I have always been yours Dean, but I never could have imagined you would want to be mine.”
“Did you see a break in the sky like a jet plane breaking the sound barrier?”
“I’m sure the others have regaled you with one of many tales of my ineptitude when it comes to machinery.  You looked so pleased at your fine handiwork.  I’d love to contribute to a solid endeavor, touch the fruits of our labor in such a way.”
“Sounds a little lonely,” he said, his rambling fingers taking they duties back up in earnest.
“After my brother and I ran away, the police refused to help find us.  We were adults and thus had autonomy to go wherever we pleased.  Since then, the Family has been disinclined to put any faith in the justice system, unless of course it concerns silencing outsiders from hindering their true mission.  From the legal trail I could uncover, lawsuits usually remedy incursion from the outside world long before anyone ignorant of their existence could sniff them out.  They have excellent legal representation.
Sam eyes popped open and the last puzzle piece snapped into place.  “That compound in Wichita.  This cult leader took out insurance policies on his members then offed them.  Abused a lot of people under his influence.  They caught him once there was a traceable body trail if memory serves.”
The small kind gesture seemed to quell his annoyance by at least a half measure.
“I’d ask how you found my home, but I’ve only ever entertained one person here.”  His cleared his throat when the H’s rang it dry.
She peered up at the barn ceiling with palms perched at her hips for a moment before she spoke.  “Yeah, sure.  While we were dating she kept some stuff from me for all the reasons newly minted couples do.  You’re still getting to know each other or you just don’t know how much the other person can handle.”
“Of course it was, Dean.  Wait, ‘we’?”
His best impression of his Sam’s bitch face broke the mounting tension they were trying to overlook like a poorly disguised mole.  Their hyena cackles drew a much needed laugh from the pent up papa.  Charlie always had a way of drowning out nervous tension by pointing out a situation’s absurdity or deflecting the pointed joke on herself.
I wrote chunks of this chapter while wading through the first half of 'The A Side'.  I knew Cas would return home to a very messy Dean  and all that fallout needed it's own venue.  Switching perspectives that late in the other story would have dragged it on and become very messy amongst the final chapters in the AU.  Since this chapter has seen the editing cleaver more times than I care to count, I hope it was easy to follow.
They exchanged farewells as Dean took the stairs down two at a time as well.  He grinned as he jogged toward Castiel and eyed the broom with an open hand.  “Let’s put a pin in Benny’s honey-do list,” he said pulling it out of his grasp.  “We got a delivery to the Roadhouse before the bluehairs’ supper time.”
“You’re saying he was just unwell then.  Why’s that moot?” he asked rubbing his pointer finger across his bottom lip.
Wonder permeated every cell in his body as his bright cerulean irises channeled the sunlight around him.  It took a concerted effort to restart his breathing in the presence of such a beautiful creature: the being who claimed to be an angel, spoke like an alien, and loved like a man.  A Cheshire smile curled up his face and he nodded Cas on, letting him loose back into the universe.
First was the problem of the entity that stalked them out of Easton.  Surely they or the Men of Letters had run into something like this before at some point. Since he didn’t initially accompany the brothers into White Creek, he had only a rough secondhand remembrance to go off of.  The similarities between Easton and White Creek might have been overlooked by the hunters altogether, but it was undeniable that they were linked.
That night, his ritual took an unexpected turn. In place of a face adorned with only dark haze, he imagined Castiel’s twisting lips and penetrating gaze ushering him towards release.  A pulpy version of his evening played out behind his eyelids, monumentally curious to try even his facsimile on for size.  The scenario all began with Sam unwittingly leaving out Castiel’s number on a scratch piece of paper in clear view, begging to be ferreted away.  Any resolve he could summon sprang to his fingertips, dialing the out of state number slowly enough to verify every digit before hitting send.  Three excruciating rings later, his striking conquest picked up with a notably ragged voice.  Some pithy teasing eased them into heated conversation. The pit in his throat shrunk as that rough voice described how pleased he was to hear from him so soon.  Quietly he asked if he could confess something weighing heavy on his mind.  Dean obliged, his interest piqued to the nth degree.  When Castiel departed the restaurant, he found himself lust burdened and the only cure for his longings was Dean’s willing submission.  Touched at his brazen honesty, he had to return the favor, to prove how good he could be for him.  Not bothering to shy away from his echoed desire, he shared incredibly intimate details about himself, even if the confession only smashed to dust at Castiel’s feet.  Delighted at his obedience, he broke the sound barrier racing his 70’s Cadillac over to the bunker, his feet slamming down the stairs and right to his door, as if their mutual sensitivity to each other pulled them together like opposing magnets.   His hammering heart was the siren song inviting Castiel past his locked door and into his lonely bed.  As if their connection was already driven into each other’s skin, he crowded into his space, folding loose arms around him from behind at the head of the bed.  Back to chest, they breathed each other in, absorbed each other’s heat until they became one unit.  Mirroring what the dom had done in that first video, Castiel whispered little demands into his ear as his arousal made itself known along Dean’s curved spine.  Detailed instructions on when and how he wanted him to touch himself were puffed out with heady whispers against the back of his lobe.  Each vibration sent a bone deep satisfying moan unfurling into their little universe. Familiar heat licked down every nerve even though Castiel remained immobile, a rigid throne at his back.  Towering sentry over his mounting pleasure filled his visitor with desire to worship his every inch of skin, to lave its most sensitive stretches with a hungry tongue, all the while expounding on each thought delicately into the conch of Dean’s ear.  As was rote in his masturbatory repertoire by then, he followed each of his instructions, lapping up his praise like a man possessed.  Tingling fireworks shot from his center, spiraling out towards his toes as he fell into that deep well of completion.  This new favorite fantasy inspired spunk to shoot all the way up to his chin.  His flesh parched of intimate affections retaliated at having gone so long without release.  The tender aftercare the dom showered on his sub playing in his headphones instantly reminded him that the other side of his bed was indeed empty.  No human touch encircled him.  No moist exhales dissipated against his ear.
Disappointment radiated off of him as he backed away, but he nudged past it.  He was still having difficulty wrapping his mind around this place, this vivid but tenuous connection.  Previously his mind melds were like an oversaturated memory reel forcibly flashed into his cranium.  It wasn’t smooth or painless to have a hundred percent of an experience shoved through a ten percent filter, but he endured.  The answer sat heavy in Cas’s expression.  “The times before were painful and disorienting because I resisted, weren’t they?”
The overpriced coffee was long forgotten by the time Sam came up for air.  The morning was chalk full of distressed scowls and determined grimaces, but after a lightning fast lunch they took up their uncomfortable thrones at the table to compare notes.  Dean was struck with firsthand accounts of the MoL interactions with the group, but most resulted in near misses with a lot of guess work.  Sam seemed to fair a lot better.
“How much time, Charlie!”
A brotherly conversation.
“While you were weeding out modern cult writers from your list of suspects, you likely saw how prevalent cult member memoirs were, showcases of human depravity in first person designed to shock and dismay,” he explained with a pinch of aversion.
Dean was more than eager to oblige, but he pushed Cas down instead and ventured hurriedly into his nightstand in search of everything they would need.  He scooted Cas over further and laid out each tool beside them.  When his focus returned to Cas’s face, it matched a whiff of anxiety he felt clawing up the sides of their link.  It was indeed a marvelous gift Cas was giving him and he would receive all the patient instruction he needed even though all he wanted to do at that point was the short, dirty, and incredible hot version.  His dark lightly sweaty mop laid as still and attentive as Dean climbed over to straddle him once again.  The admirable sized erection trapped against Dean’s
He squinted and tilted his head.  “So close.”
Link after link he pinballed closer to the type of voice that would settle his fried mind easily.  A masculine voice, asking him to – no telling him he knew what was best for him.  He would instruct him how to drown out all the worthless chatter between his ears, the voice so close he could feel his hot breath on his earlobe.  Then the rabbit hole opened, dragging him from one page to the next until he found an entire site dedicated to quelling his submissive side into contentment.  Whether he finished a video or audio file sexually sated or not depended on the dom’s whim.  Each week or so this dom would release an alluring entry focusing on one exercise in restraint or indulgent task, hushing Dean’s burdened psyche.  Just to keep his tease bubbling underneath his skin hours after, he never showed his full face, just his full majestic lips and strong chin.  The first posts weren’t edited, dedicating long stretches of time to his calming inhales and exhales, inviting his listeners to be cleansed by his mere presence.  As the site matured, gaining a modest following along the way, so did his posts.  Once Dean had heard enough of his voice that could conjure his light east coast accent in muted moments, a video of just his jawline appeared on the site.  Tall stretches of his lips and curled sneers unexpectedly captivated him.  Until that video played on his laptop hours past midnight, the idea that watching another man’s mouth command him to attention seemed preposterous.  It graduated earlier that year to the apex of Dean’s whisper fantasies: this mysterious whisper sergeant bringing a blindfolded sub to release with intimate muted instruction.  Upon initial viewing, his focused on the effect his voice had on the mesmerized sub, his rapt obedience through orgasm denial opened his eyes to a form of well earned praise he would have begged for given the opportunity.  Ultimately, Dean closed his eyes completely and put himself in the place of that sub, following his every instruction to the letter, never erring where the man on film had.  Instead over a handful of attempts listening to the video he obeyed his far off dom’s every desire perfectly.   For a mile long list of reasons, he couldn’t try this kink out in person, so he focused on the dom’s lips puffing and stretching over his white teeth right by the sub’s ear to bring himself to climax.  After that revelatory display, the creator went back to audio only posts, frustrating more than just Dean by the looks of the comments under each of his subsequent posts.  The whisperer apologized later, citing difficulties finding an appropriate sub as the reason there was only one coupled video of that nature.  Like clockwork, many of his users offered themselves up, but he politely declined.  As more formal compensation, his next video offering was of him naked from the chin down struggling to stay below a vocal threshold as he jerked off, bringing himself to the edge many times, taunting his follower’s with his urgent need only to back off again.  Flashes of this video and imagining himself being dominated by him flooded Dean’s erotic inner workings.
A heavy door clanked shut behind him and the daydream evaporated.  A half dozen unfamiliar heads swiveled in his direction except for one set of squinting green eyes searching him up and down for a piece he clearly lacked.  Dean leaned up from his place hunched over a half empty box of bottles and bellowed out, “What the hell are you wearing?”
His smile fluctuated from being sincere, to professionally false, to rest somewhere in the middle.  As Dean looked up at Benny’s open thoughtful gaze, he imagined Benny offering him a robust shoulder to whine on and some sensual comforts they had both alluded to on several occasions but never acted on.  If he was honest with himself and had downed a few beers, he would have loved the feel of his silky lips on his, the sensation pulling him out of his own head for just a few minutes.  With a shaking head he cast the thought aside and patted him on the bicep fondly.  “Not a thing, Benny.  It’s just a spat with the work husband.  I appreciate you checking up on me though.”
His heart split at his deliberate, calculated words.  He wasn’t a brother to him?  But they were a family.  “Cas…” he unconsciously hugged his torso, seeking reassurance even if it was only something he could give himself.
Dean and Cas finally get that steak.  Rough beginnings divulged.
“Of course.  If you need anything…”
“Not even Charlie?  Figured you and the lady wizard would have swapped a few war stories.  Her parents were real treasures in the acceptance department.”
“It was kind of a blur for a while there.  Getting caught up in that Mexican kitchen standoff, bright light, searing pain all over, then waking up in the dark.  Sammy told me about you healing him right away.  Seemed like he didn’t miss a beat though.  Thanks again for rescuing him… us.”
Right that moment, Dean playfully pushed him onto his side and helped him out of his offending garments in record time.  Castiel laid with his head at the foot of the bed his lungs pumping the recycled bunker air faster than he anticipated.  Dean crawled down his torso and stationed his shoulders near his exposed navel.  His exhales warmed the cooling flesh just before the inhales viciously stripped it away again.  With the same focus as reverent prayer, he traced every line and curve of his pink tipped manhood bobbing up and down against his stomach.  Castiel took slow, deliberate breaths and twitched in anticipation of the perfect mouth he’d stared at hundreds of times in the cramped office for way longer than was polite drawing nearer.  Soon his gaze was replaced with the lightest touch of his fingers.  That sinful wine tinged tongue darted out leisurely over his plush bottom lip.  Castiel wished to the forces on high that Dean’s crafty mouth and the object of his meticulous study would meet.  Instead his moist breaths swirled over the bottom side of his undeniably enraptured cock.  His right hand established a sensuously, exploratory pace around him as Dean returned his focus to his face, gauging the effectiveness of his underhand and overhand and thumb swivels by the reactions on his face.  Once a jackhammering pulse set the pace for his deep throated laments, Dean repeated his tugs with a moderately snug grip slowing just below the head.  His eyelids slid closed and he pulled Dean up to trace the insides of his mouth with a very appreciative tongue.  Every few strokes, he made long deliberate treks from the flared ridge of his dark head all the way down to massage his balls.  The journey propelled Castiel to lick deeper into his mouth.  As he sped up, baritone groans slipped from his now dry throat.  A simple grip and grind hadn’t ever felt so right, like his body was made to fit every curves of Dean’s.  The pace picked up and the ventures further south accumulated into concerted tugs.  “So good, Dean.  Fuck… Gonna come….”
The mop of messy dark hair turned under his gaze, but his eyes refused to turn skyward
The dearth of subject matter covered in these books hardly matched what he had lead him to believe the Men of Letters would regard as paramount for their dastardly work.  It wasn’t until he nearly stumbled on an entire row of children’s books that he found the nerve to face his companion.  “So this is the kids section?  I thought I would have found a Luna Girl and the Demon Dino or two in here.”
Sam leaned forward with his beer sloshing in circles in his cup a knowing smile decorating his flushed face.  The Mills held hands excitedly as well, apparently clinging to the same triumph as Sam.  He craned his neck to get a good look at to his right where Dean stared down at him, but a robust affection radiated off of his whole body.  “What is it Cas?”
“There’s a supplier meeting me just outside of town soon.  She was on her way south when Sam reached out to her.  He’s preparing the plant matter we already have access to while I make the exchange for the rest of the ingredients,” he turned towards the door again as if in a hurry.
“Won’t Uncle Bobby be mad we are in his house?”
“Stop!” he shouted curtly.
“Why don’t these files have last accessed date and time stamps?” he asked with his face entirely too close to the screen for a split second.
“I’d ask him.  Just thought I’d fill you in so you know to submit your final report, too.  Pileggi will be happy to have this matter settled,” he said tapping away at far off keys in the background.
“So patience isn’t his forte,” he summed up.
“Okay, crinkle cut chili fries, then,” he acquiesced to the merciful semblance of an affirmative nod.  “I know this is gonna sound bonkers, but just humor me,” he pleaded and intertwined his fingers between his bowed knees.  “Are you from another planet?”
“Your welcome, agent,” she waved him away and returned to glare at her monitor.  “I’ll keep whichever agent is here abreast of any developments.”
He brought a forefinger to his lips, elongating his breaths to minimize noises to weed through.  His slow swerving about the rows of shelves only served to amuse his befuddled brother.  No matter which direction his ventured in the room, the noise didn’t clarify or increase in volume so he made larger sweeps: kitchen, bedroom hallway, back down the stairs.  Only when he considered it as an external noise did he make any headway.  The moment his foot landed in the map room the constant vibration solidified.  Small steps around the illuminated map brought him closer to identifying the sonorous detail: the flapping of very tiny wings.  He couldn’t help but smile which morphed Sam’s confusion into deeper concern.  On the eastern end of the table he grabbed a coaster to mark where the hum was loudest.  The coaster slid in every cardinal direction on the map.  Sam followed its path intently with mix of hopeful grins and apprehensive frowns as Dean gauged the right location.  He grinned remembering Cas’s fondness for the tiny winged creatures as his final shuffle led his coaster over the northeastern United States.  Fingers pulled the coaster away, but the louder buzzing only returned when he hovered over a finger’s width and an inch south of DC and like a devoutly possessed planchette.
The brothers meet the tenant farmers.  Dean lets Sam in on his discovery.
“I’m not sure I have ever enjoyed a steak as moist as this.  You will have to show me how you prepared it sometime.”
“Really?  You like stomping around in beer scented rubber boots and getting barked at by a surly asshole in your off time?” he shrugged basking in self-deprecation.
house.  Maybe he couldn’t get delta, but he could try for another safe house further out.  Dean must have been desperate to pull an unstable asset from a secure facility and out from under his partner’s nose no less.  He must have had a good reason for such rash actions, right?
He clamored away from his seat, but didn’t follow him.  “Yeah, good.  I’ll just uh…”
Indulging in the inexact science of their one sided conversations blanketed him in a natural calm he equated with picking up where he left off with an old but far flung friend.  Reading meaning out of the minute pinches and waving fine lines at the corners his eyes tested him the first weeks when his language skills were the weakest.  Their tether by contrast filled him with soft closeness like whispers from a time rooted love from under the covers.  The rubber banding effect propelled him back to his front stoop laden with two six packs and a dump truck of unanswered queries.  The fact that more than half of them piled up on his end of scale flummoxed him further.  If their wager held up, was there one question he could draw out of the bunch that would give him the satisfaction he craved?  No perfect all-encompassing question existed, he mused.
“Why would that be a big issue? The shelves are stocked with enough ‘Lager-Wheelie’ and ‘Boxcar Opus’ to keep a county fair in high spirits for a week.”
“I know better than to ask if they contacted you, but I have seen them parading some Counter Terror agents into their offices for ‘private chats’.  Let’s say they already put the screws to Davies.  He’s a seasoned agent; no way he’s gonna squirm for them.  Who would they tap next?  Friends?  Lovers? Let me do some more digging.”
“Pear and Elderflower,” Dean spouted into the clear windshield.
“I know I’m gonna regret asking, but why corn powder?” Sam had to know.  He didn’t want to, he had to.
He eyed him skeptically, but he didn’t push.  “No big car chases or bank heists, huh?  Didn’t run into any monsters on the other side, either?”
“This is Counter Intel we’re talking about.  Why are they hampering a Counter Terror case at all?  Makes you think Krycek wasn’t the target.  Sure, hand Counter Terror the win, but who is Counter Intel truly after then?” She stared off into the center of her screen like a lone pixel held the solution.
His staid tone stiffened.  “I don’t write erotica.  Honestly it would be a lot simpler if I did.”
“Morning, Hanscum,” he asked through an unexpectedly constricted throat.
“On the handful of occasions I Infiltrated cults before, I picked up methods to cover my tracks that worked well enough: develop uncomplicated back stories, fake documentation, have quick change garments in case I was spotted, and so on.  Before I crossed a toe onto the Wasco County compound, I ditched any money and ID’s I had in a storage locker in Maupin, the only town in walking distance.  The group was shifting all their belongings and operations to a newly erected primary compound so I slipped in with the moving crew.”
“I’m not a kiss and tell type of guy,” he said, smarm dripping from his words.
There was no choice, not really.  The only options were to vacate now without an explanation, leaving the agent to wonder what offense he had committed against his angel until his dying day or hazard his wavering nerves and say whatever he needed to hear when he came home regardless of how true it was.  There was no way to preemptively console his absence other than wiping the agent’s memory.  The evidence of that method’s effectiveness on a Winchester was previously made clear.  They always ferreted out a way to bypass the least hurtful process.  The agent would find a way somehow and would never forgive him for it.  That left the truth, and the truth was an unwieldy as a blanket that refused to fold correctly in his arms.  Its worn bits and feathered edges made it unsightly but the solace it could give him was the best he could offer.
Only a familiar whine sounded out, so he dropped his bouncing pen on the notepad beneath his callused right hand in favor of grabbing for his coat.  His forefinger wrapped around his keyring at the edge of the desk, all but giving up on the strained conversation.
“Be ready in an hour.  Together we will show Dean there’s nothing to be nervous about,” he trailed off with less regard for Sam’s discontent.  Nothing he could say would fix the problem.  He had to show them.
“Oh, older patrons would be prone to eating earlier in the day.  I don’t get the term though,” he said hefting two full boxes in at a time.
Cas’s feeble nod pushed Dean drift in his own body.  A disassociated sensation lifted him from his corporeal form like his head was slowing unscrewing itself from his shoulders and his feet grew numb vanishing down into the floorboards.
Briefly, Jody’s solemn declaration flashed through his mind.  In its current state, the brewery wasn’t even worth enough to bargain for Bobby’s house, even if it were the last thing Bobby would have wanted them to do.  The livelihood of all of their employees was more important than an old house, its walls housing only lonesome ghosts.  His heart stalled recalling the night Claire finally came to call its warm confines home.  Right now, their family would have to persevere like they had a hundred times before.  If anything they should be experts at the proverbial tuck and roll.
She relaxed by a half measure, but obediently headed out of the room.  At the top of the stairs she looked back at him with a cagey posture.
“Local police wouldn’t cooperate on a search for him since he was not being held on formal charges.  The bureau is just lucky he hasn’t gone to the press with his story of how we kept him cuffed to a bed for days on end on a weak handed trespassing misdemeanor.”
“Why were your clothes on the floor?” Sam followed the thread of thought to a dissatisfactory conclusion.  “Oh…. OH.”
In the months he had been gone he pulled at that string, positive there was no evidence of angels to be found.  Beginning his inquiry was daunting all the same.  Every initial question sounded preposterous.  Are there other angels?  Is unexplainable phenomenon proof of angels, God, or science as of yet undiscovered?  How do you even detect the presence of angels?
“Yes, sir,” he smiled, curiosity beating out irritation completely.  Comfortably pushed all the way back onto the couch, he splayed his palms on the dark fabric beside his thighs.
He grunted in the affirmative, knowing Benny’s intention was for him to share the lot with Cas.  At the rate he was going, they might not speak again until the Baldcypress trees hunkered outside were bare.  A strangled huff passed his lips as he collapsed onto the office chair.  His standard operating procedure dictated that he push all the distractions off the proverbial cliff just as he had with relative success every hour since Cas left.  The margin of failure tugged at his core all the while.  Because Ellen would undoubtedly sniff out his uneven tone like a hunting dog on a rabbit’s trail, he first dove into marketing and logistics for the next beer fest at the Sedgewick county fairgrounds.  Once the booth space was paid for, supplies gathered, and requisition for an allotment of their two most popular brews were made, he willed himself to call over to the Roadhouse.  Of course she answered and as expected she knew something was off the moment he greeted her.  Unlike his brother or the nosey brewmaster, she knew when to back off and let him breathe.  The offer for consult was always on the table without the fanfare, but it was her knowing silence that calmed him the most.  Like the libations she served, her deep voice and measured tones soothed even the most wayward of patrons.  Even though the conversation only lasted a couple of minutes, he found himself carrying less tension in his shoulders by the end.  Bobby was lucky to have a companion like her during his last battles.
“Dean…” he said and reached for his hand.
Like a lightning bug lit up her path forward, her eyes widened.  A self-congratulatory grin slid across her face.  “Who is it, Dean?”
Sam tugged at his bottom lip then lit up.  “Remember when we met Cas on top of the bunker to let the raijyuu out for Raijin to reclaim?  Cas said he got a charge from the containers they were in.  Maybe that compromised his power somehow.”
The usual fair was dug out piece by piece front the non-descript gym bag and laid out one by one on the hideous floral printed quilt.  The phone charger, extra clothes, running shoes, first aid box, and small roll of cash clashed with the bed spread, but a solitary pouch concealing his real-adjacent IDs blended right into the pattern hiding all the expected stains from your commonplace stubborn bodily fluid stains.  Once his eyes rested on the pouch, his mind poured over the rolodex of identities in that pouch, cursing at the one with his compromised alias stamped on it.  Thankfully, the stranger found what he was looking for while cataloging Dean’s belongings: thick blue athletic socks.  He clutched them victoriously and eyed Dean in appreciation.  He sat at the edge of the bed to pull the offensively thin white socks off when Dean stopped him with a grunt of disapproval.  “Hey, how about we eat first? Then you take a shower and put on the only clean pair of socks between the two of us, yeah?”
“Can’t trespass on a public park, even when it’s an unofficial non-crime scene,” he gruffly confirmed.  “How does Ketch factor into this?”
She unlocked and closed the door behind her leaving him with the unenviable task of sorting through hard copies of missing needle vs haystack cases until he could bolt out the door.
, he smiled meekly.
he commanded like the general of a thousand man army: immovable, absolute.
The blood flushed from his features down to his extremities.  His body told him to turn, but his mind was too stubborn to leave without sating its sadistic curiosity.
The variety of concerns this morning took the 7-layer cake, though.  Was his boss really in on setting him in the sights of a terrorist militia group?  Did Ketch have anything to do with killing their own people in the raid of that same militia group?  Oh, yeah and was he catching feelings for an extraterrestrial?  His hand raked down his face at the thought.  Well, caffeine might dissolve the fog over any number of points along that line of inquiry.
“You sure that clumsy new bartender wouldn’t miss your ‘top off’?” he jabbed.
Sam mirrored Dean’s movement to feel on his belly at the thought of the raijyu slithering out of him with an acidic grimace.  “I know right, like something tried to pull my spine out of my bellybutton with a cattle prod.  I’m surprised you are up and moving this quickly.  It took me more than an hour to just breath normally again.”
“Yeah, I know, I know,” he cut him off.  “Let’s just search to see if there are any anomalies in that area.  As an aside, you may want to put that archangel warding back up.”
Charlie painted the Winchesters as towering righteous figures of the community.  Sam, an Ivy League educated professional, left private practice to help everyday people less often represented in the legal system with a substantial pay cut.  Dean helped Bobby raise him from an early age, forgoing a traditional continuing education in favor of being the best provider he could be under the circumstances.  When Sam left for Stanford, curtesy of a full ride scholarship, the opportunity finally presented itself to think beyond their immediate needs.  After obtaining his GED, he immediately tackled a handful of automotive certifications.  In a larger city he could make use of his specialty so Kansas City welcomed him.  Upon graduating with honors, Sam found a big city flat a few blocks from his kin and a prestigious firm that put him on track to a bright future.  Both established and content in their lives among the bustle, they spoke of each other as proud adults finally on equal footing.  On their own, they gathered enough experience to eventually handle their biggest challenge to date: Bobby’s death. Though it presented unfamiliar hardships, they carried each other forward with the newest Winchester on their shoulders.  Back together again in their hometown, that old hat sibling shorthand helped them lead the brewery into the future.  The redhead added more detail than necessary about their personal trials along the way, but by the time she was done, he couldn’t help but want to aid them as he had assisted the shelter and skate park.
“Ex-partner, Charlie,” he corrected her even though she very well knew.
“No, Dean, it’s not on you.  Blaming yourself won’t do any good.  I mean come on; you guys blew up my phone and laptop while you were macking on each other.  You can’t say his mojo was in perfect sync.”
“So he might be suspicious something is going on but he’s too polite to ask.”
He could bluff his way out of this one.  “It was totally Cas.  You see that guy can’t take his hands off of me,” his head bobbed joyously as he crossed his arms.
“Correct me if I’m wrong,” he said hesitantly.  “Don’t you have a better grasp on these matters than him?”
“About two years ago Bobby told me about a small batch Benny thought up while on vacation visiting his sweetie in Louisiana.  They’ve long split, but the concoction they thought up that weekend was the sweetest thing Benny had ever conjured up.  Very begrudgingly, Bobby gave it the green light saying it would bring in a wider variety of strange brew enthusiasts.  It was slow to sell the first night, but forty-eight hours in, it was gone from every tap in town.”
He snickered, “I will bring home cheesecake for just me but, I‘ll bring you something better – only if you behave.  No tracking dirt into their house again.”
“Listen, we’re gonna circle for a bit while we find out where to land.  Once we figure that out, we’ll get you some real food like I promised, alright?”  Backing out of his parking spot, he spotted a genuine smile in his rear view mirror.  “A’right then.”
Castiel nodded and scooted forward in his chair as if to stand up.
She studied him for a moment, piecing together his words into an image that fit her recollection.  She nodded happily.  A sonorous gurgle brought her attention back to her needy stomach.  “Can we have chicken nuggets for dinner?”
Piercing through the atmosphere faster than his wings could control, his imminent earthbound collision reminded him of how he fell to earth years before.  Most of the angels who were volleyed to the fertile ground below were too stunned at their predicament to push, grab or pull at the wind gusts around them to slow their plummet.  By then Cas was too accustomed to the petrifying cold of streaming air currents to let himself be cast down indiscriminately.  With his Grace hobbled, he felt the paralyzing chill of the wind against his skin, the adrenaline pumping frigid fear through his every vein.  This time though, he knew what it meant to fall, what he would have left and what he would go without.  The only question that struck him as he tumbled was how long it would take to get back to the bunker.  Would he end up stuck states away again without a penny to his name?
“Uh… yeah.  I could go get you something else…” he offered but Mick shook his head.
He shook his head, adamantly dismissing her offer.  “No one needs to know I was here.”
Even though he was sure he wouldn’t forget such a name, he made sure to bookmark his commercial website for later perusal.  “You don’t sound thrilled that I know now.”
“Dean,” Sam said in a tone reminiscent of the one he used to explain Bobby’s medical bills in laymen’s terms.  “This is not our fault.  It’s not your fault.  This is not Charlie’s fault.”
“This can’t be good,” he murmured.  He braced himself against the back of his chair for whatever bright idea spittled out of his maniacally desperate brother.
A door knob turned and the heavy door scraped the floor as it opened behind him.  A taller fed with long hair peeked his head through the crack in the door.  An apologetic nod coaxed him out of his seat and his back cracked unpleasantly as he made his way to the door.  His relief opened the door to let him out, but kept it slightly open to monitor the unconscious man.  “Sorry, my flight just landed when I got the call.  So who’s Sleeping Beauty?”
“You think the familiars are still there trying to get back to their witch.”
“Not for any practical purposes.  I have experience reprogramming myself out of cult mentality, but others leave with far more than emotional burdens.  I’ve met countless people who left their communities with little more than the shoes on their feet; people that had to rebuild their lives from the ground up.  Either their leaders convinced them to give up their entire estates or family members or future earnings or they burned the bridges back to their biological or logical families.  Some leave only to end up in rehab, suffering from an addiction forced on them.  Empathy only works so much when you have no firsthand experience with such conditions.”
He regarded their love affair with a struck grin.  “Way to go, Donna.”
Even the way Cas let his confession fall from his lips so brazenly made Dean’s heart skip.  “Your Grace is different… because of me?”
, he half smirked.
Fingers finally pulled out of his hoodie cuffs and reached out to find Dean’s, pulling him sideways.  The hunter turned to stand in front of him at a less awkward angle.  Cas nodded.  “I would like that.”
“It’s not just the sink,” he stood up and gestured towards the bunker’s bowels as he spoke.  “There are patches with more modern building materials all over the bottom two floors.  I haven’t spent much time down there because of the creepy factor, but these point to The Men of Letters operating down there and in here in some capacity.”
Frustration and bewilderment competed for supremacy on his face.  “There’s footage of you copying a file from Dean’s laptop onto a USB drive and Counter Intel’s electronic signatures are all over those changed reports.”
A small warmth poked holes in his quickly starching walls.  “I am not sure, but Jack was there.”
His fingers grazed his chin for a moment and they locked eyes.  “Those are all well and good, but hardly grounding.  The lovely evening I spent being pinned down to a dark couch worshipped head to toe by a gorgeous kind hearted man was much more fulfilling to relive in the dark.”
Castiel loaded up the next stack of boxes and asked Garth, “Is he always like that when he’s angry?”
“You zapped us halfway over a ravine, Cas!” he concentrated on turning the wheel ninety degrees to the left nearing the fast approaching intersection.  While speeding over fifty, he stood firm on his point.  Almost completing the turn and jamming his foot into the accelerator, out of nowhere every hair on their bodies seemed to float in midair and their eyes grew large at the tingling sensation sliding up and down their limbs.
The distance Cas placed himself from responsibility for the decisions chafed at Dean.  Even during the week before the business needs were an end they all worked to meet, something all three of them took to heart.  All of the “you”’s sent the jagged anxious ball in his gut tumbling downhill to gather more and more momentum.  He accepted the folder from Sam when he was done reading it, but examining another one of Cas’s meticulously notated reports wouldn’t give him the clarity he was searching for.  Ever the eagle-eyed onlooker, Cas noticed his disregard and leaned back looking mildly defeated.
Sam’s gall netted an incredulous eye roll from the older Winchester.  Using his finger as bookmark, he slapped his currently lengthy tomb down into Sam’s view on the table with a loud thud and flopped the marked page open.  “This passage talks about a ‘winged messenger of the Lord’ restoring his heavenly harmonic when he found a ‘Molt of the Divine’.  If it means when I think it does, then angel wavelengths can be recalibrated instantly if they find a ground for their divine power.”
Her eyes sunk, tears emerging at their corners.  “Are you mad at me?”
He pulled away from Cas and walked to the hood of the Impala for emphasis.  A firm assertive pat on her hood sounded as he spoke brimming with hope.  “Yeah, I mean who else is going to install the new tires on her after we get back from Tulsa?” He gestured again at the spot of the hood for Cas to sit beside where he was standing.
“Cas,” Dean attempted to placate his anxiety with a calming tone.  “We’ve missed you… I’ve missed you so bad, man.  We’ve been tearing the lore apart trying to get you back from that rift.  What triggered that thing?”
“When I landed at the only bed and breakfast with an open room in town, I almost asked for a queen bed.  A hundred other minor missteps were made that trip.  Any one of them could have landed me in serious trouble.  I turned my back to a troubled witness but barely caught the reflection of his knife held over me in a mirror with enough time to stop him.  The gallery owner waxed poetic about a beloved spouse, but I never asked for cause of their passing.  Spoiler alert: botched murder suicide.  I was so wrapped up in getting there quickly, I didn’t clean my shotgun the night I landed and it jammed at the worst time.  I mean, even on autopilot I almost got ganked twice in a scuffle with the man posing as the ghost of the gallery owner’s spouse.  Anyway, when I came home to tell Sam about the sloppiest episode of a canine human detective super group tv show ever, he practically grounded me.  And you know what.  I deserved it… deserved worse.  I was careless and distracted and… fuck.  I kept imagining you walking back through that portal or whatever with me states away.  Sam and I looked through every book we had on angels and ripples in time space we had, but I wasn’t doing enough.  I wasn’t…”
They both turned to scrutinize his ad hoc statement.
“Like ASL or something?” he signed the word for ‘hello’ Sam had taught him.
He balked then wrapped his palm over his chin in thought.  “Of course I do.  It’s not like I need his expertise or approval, but we’re partners.  The left hand’s gotta let the right hand know what’s going on.”
“You cocky son of a… never mind.  I’m just glad we’re together again, even if it’s in some kind of mind palace.”  His right foot brushed against the dry grass just to solicit the expected crunching sound.  Everything felt real, but in a completely foreign way his mind kept slipping on whenever he thought he had a proper foothold.  “Is this what you and the other one could do?”
“Yes,” he continued. “Raijin made an attempt to summon them back but missed.  Raijyu remain dormant inside their hosts, but activate the hosts’ imperative to protect to them from Raijin’s reach. Usually the master’s whistle takes the form of freak weather like sudden thunderstorms.  If Raijin strikes the raijyu and wakes it up, the host will be electrocuted by the lightning bolt.  It is ultimately always fatal for the unfortunate host, unless something of equal celestial power intervenes.”
The only honest selfish peace he earned each day was the smooth ride speeding away from the three story brick building with long ominous yellow stained windows, down the battered road that winded back towards town.  The first fifteen minutes were a competition between his chaotic headspace and the open road’s lulling daughter under the Chevy’s tires.  On red letter days, winding down those unproductive thoughts were kicked roadside three miles down the road.  On black letter days, they would trail behind him until his foot found the brake just in time to stop outside of Claire’s daycare center, the closest one to her elementary school and their new-to-them two-story home.  With all the hats he had to wear, there was no chance for him to pick her up right after school like most of the other kids and the brewery was just plain dangerous for a kid that young to wander on their own.  Just like the previous afternoon, his phone went off just as he shifted into park.
Passing back out of the kitchen, he surveyed the library out of habit.  One or all of them could be found in varying states of agitation, eyes locked on one of the millions of pages found within its walls at virtually any point in time.  In the back corner resting on the brown leather reading chair’s overstuffed seat, he spotted a solitary large tome hanging off the edge narrowly escaping the effects of gravity.  Sam’s bright green spell notebook was wedged between its pages.  Minding the perpetual lack of coasters he had yet to rectify, he sat the bottles on the floor and lifted the book by its spine. It was a Greek treatise on the more radical rituals practiced by the followers of Horae.  He wiped the condensation from his free hand and leafed through the pages stopping on the pages detailing ingredients and steps for one of the rituals.  Regarding their misunderstandings of the primarily principles of how time - and by extrapolation - heavenly bodies worked as a nearly immortal angel prickled at his scalp.  Having lived as a mortal, he could empathize with their misguided conclusions.  Merely placing a handful of small mammal innards in a bowl and setting them ablaze created a spectacle, but was hardly impactful to the space around it beyond the often unpleasant smell.  He flipped through several more spells dealing in crop growth rate augmentation, slowing worshipper’s experience of time, and others primarily resulting in the ingestion of toxic or hallucinogenic concoctions with diminishing interest.  The last spell of the book required twice the ingredients and incantations length many times longer than the prior entries.  Loosely translated it aimed to pull a godly entity from their home shrine to a place they were most needed, absent of their fruitful influence.  He speculated the impromptu pilgrimages for their goddesses had some other significance he overlooked.  Having been a god-like entity before, he imagined it wouldn’t have pleased them to find themselves in an unknown land sent by inebriated worshippers.  It would explain why after a certain point the goddesses just disappeared from the lore, never to be worshipped again while other gods had simply fallen out of fashion and were left by the wayside of often studied but widely ridiculed ancient human religion.
Monday through Thursday Cas woke from his afternoon nap only to rearrange himself into a nest of bedding on the side of the couch closest to the front door.  Despite being healthier and stronger with each passing day, watching tv or trying to read taxed his faculties.  Being alone most of the day failed to irritated him like it did in his world even with how subdued he was into resting his eyes every few hours.  Limited to purely human dangers of this world, this Dean was under far less risk of being thrown across a room into a wall by a seven horned creature or particularly surly witch.  Any situation he got himself into, he could think or bluff or shoot his way out of as far as he could tell.
===============
They laid in post coital glow for a minute or two, enjoying the breathless tingling of their skin across their tether.  The explosive orgasm let alone the over sensitive tingle afterwards were a new, very nearly overwhelming sensation.  Even the most enthusiastic, limber, avid partners he’d had weren’t as enthralling to watch come undone as Cas.  Dean propped himself up on an elbow and kissed his overworked pink lips between inextricable smiles.  Cas returned them as enthusiastically, but was visibly still overmastered.  His eyes were puffy and small tears slid from their wrinkled corners.  Concern crawled across Dean’s gut until Cas waved it way with a gummy grin
As natural as having Cas waiting for him at home felt, returning home well after dinner again put an unfamiliar weight in his gut.  For the first couple dinners that week, he opened the door to a home cooked meal chilling in the refrigerator.  That afternoon, he texted Cas ahead of time to let him know he was picking something up for them, a pale gesture to repay him for cooking so often.  Although they hadn’t spoken in their way for a while, he learned far more about his silent companion than he expected amidst their one sided conversations.  One of the things they hadn’t conversed on was his taste in cuisine.  The pasta, burgers, from scratch casseroles, and pancakes he made were far more than just edible.  The sparse spices used and sometimes inconsistent textures seemed unpracticed.  Did he not get the chance to cook often in his home?  Did he grab fast food or quick diner meals on the road often?  He seemed to pay special attention to his reaction when he took the first bite of onion infused worcestershire sauce drizzled burger.  At first he assumed they were his favorite dish but he paid far more attention to the sauce that dripped off of his chin than his own burger.  Hopefully his stab at a professionally cooked feast he might enjoy was worth the effort.  Something told him he wouldn’t mind what he brought home, either way it would teach him something new about his preferences.  Sure, the doctor would prefer he was on a healthier kick until his body fully healed, but if anyone deserved a special treat it was the man who crash landed in a new universe where he couldn’t form words with his own mouth.  Every so often he would still flinch when leaning or stretching, but his copious naps seemed to speed his healing.  Maybe he would get a chance to check if those bruises lighten into pale yellows and browns opposed to the bright purples and blacks from his initial fall.
His fingers found purchase on a black leather strap almost under the bed and he ungracefully pulled himself back topside with both heirloom and wipes in hand.  As his ass hit the comforter again, he landed right on the lube.  In an effort to keep it more of a bed and less of slip and slide, he returned it to its rightful, easily accessible place in the other bedside table.  As he pulled the top off the wipes container, a flash of brightly illuminated blue caught his eye.  A queer shiver wriggled through his body, but upon inspection, the window was closed.  The leather necklace with a horned small brass pendant swung in his partner’s grip.  Instead of using the link to ask about it, he tilted his head at it.
A meandering feeling cast over Dean’s consciousness he likened to trying to remember a word on the tip of his tongue.
He cleared his throat and paused.  “Dean, I didn’t think I could ever feel that way again.  It tore at me, but I responded to his affection.”
Once inside the ultra-dark entryway, Dean pulled him in further in order to close the door and cast out the summer wind’s dry heat. His campfire and char scent thickened as he leaned into his space.  His also being nervous about the situation calmed him to a small degree.  The thick clunk of an ancient light switch echoed down the small mudroom.  The noisy buzz of electricity carried over copper tubing rang out a full three seconds before yellow tinted illumination followed suit.  On the left side of them, a coat rack was lined with winter coats, including a small puffy white one he remembered Claire wearing on the most intemperate of winter days.  Beneath it rested a shoe rack organized by size.  Several pairs of Claire sandals, small striped tennis shoes, and faux leather mary janes decorated the top rack while Dean’s worn in dirty sneakers, toe scuffed boots, and pristine loafers lined the bottom row.
He flagged the nurse walking by to supplement his understanding of the patient’s condition.  “Hello, Cynthia,” he read her name tag back at her with the least run down attempt at charm he could muster.  “Can we ask you a couple of questions about your patient here?”
“I’m at what I think is your front door.  It appears to be locked.”  The hollow clunk of the side door handle could be heard in the background.
Vestiges of sleep tore from Sam as the ghost of coffee past called him awake.  The near total dark of the bunker put him right out once again, but the urge to pee pushed him right towards the sliver of light from under the door of the still alight hallway.   He rubbed the crusted gunk out of his eyes and felt for the door handle.  Pulling the door open, he was greeted with the brunt of ancient bulbs guiding him to the bathroom a few doors down the hall.  Cas was very persistent about leaving all the lights leading from the map room to the boy’s bank of bedrooms on until they were both home safe, despite the power inefficiency.   While he was human, he could not depend on having powers to heal them if they hurt themselves in the dark, so they compromised on this one of many things.  Dean came back piss drunk often enough but hadn’t yet permanently harmed himself on hallway corners or light fixtures, so he fought Cas on it several times.  Eventually, the fight wasn’t worth the effort with the stubborn ex-angel and the brothers acquiesced.  The fact that the hallway lights were still on wasn’t surprising if Dean was not back yet, he figured.  Between heavy laden footfalls, Sam tore his eyes open to see Dean’s door swung open as he undoubtedly left it before his graceless exit.  None of his lights were on but the bedside lamplight, undoubtedly flipped on by the patient angel.  They had been up late researching and Sam guessed it was a fraction before dawn.  As a human, Cas had taken to sleeping like a champ and needed all he could get recently for some reason he kept tight to his chest.  He liked to think he was spending nights catching up on all the shows they made references to that weren’t in his literary download from a few years before.  Sam smirked as he imagines him huddled under the covers, taking mental notes on things to ask the boys about the modern relevance of like LED lined bidet seats or cat food jingles.
