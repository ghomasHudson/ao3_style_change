Sorry if this is kind of late, finals are coming up and I've been really busy- also, I didn't have wifi for five days, so that made this a tad more tricky.
"Girls," the teacher scolded. "I hardly think this is the appropriate time to discuss your own relationships. You can save personal examples for tonight's homework."
Castiel shook his head, avoiding her gaze as he sharpened the nose of his raccoon. He frowned, tilting his head to bring himself closer to his sketchbook. He would like to draw a raccoon with colored eyes but that would destroy the black and white theme of his drawing.
"Right, she kept forcing you to share her lunch and stalking you and got really mad that you didn't like her back- everybody thought she was weird."
If he would just answer his damn phone! Dean sighed, he'd tried calling Cas last night, and how today, but he wouldn't answer. Cas probably didn't trust him.
It was not that Castiel did not trust Meg, in fact the only negative feelings he had towards her was that she would leave him. One day, Castiel feared he would lose one of the few friends he had left, or betray him to Crowley, after all, they ran in similar circles. He knew this was ridiculous, and that Meg and he were acquaintances at the very least- therefore he had no need to worry.
!" Castiel screamed, "Please- please don't leave me! I- I had to- I had to! You don't understand!" He sobbed, body shaking as he pleaded with his brother, "Please don't leave me!"
His eyes quickly widened and he slapped a hand over his mouth, realizing what he had just said. Charlie sat up in her green chair, folding her arms as she smirked at the teenager she shared the large desk with. Dean's big eyes fell to the floor, and he out an arm up, resting his face on it as he turned away from Charlie.
Dean shook his head, "Tell me about it. The kid's having nightmares and gettin' angry, I don't know what to do."
Dean wanted to say. I'm sorry that I'm a mess and probably can't stick around to make up for it. I'm sorry I can't be the kind of guy you deserve.
The weight of his nightmares scared him, and left him to think about them in the darkness. Perhaps if he was a good person he would deserve to wake one of his siblings to speak with. But he was bad, and therefore should have to face the nightmares alone. His only hope was that speaking with Gabriel would calm his subconscious.
Sam rolled his eyes, "Alright, Dean. See you two later; I have to go ask my math teacher a question."
Castiel sighed happily as Dean relaxed against the couch, smiling at him. He burrowed in next to Dean's side, a cotton sheet beneath his folded knees. Dean was warmer than his single bed would ever be. He rested his head against Dean's shoulder as a hundred voices yelled for him to stop.
"Please, Castiel has never fit in with this family. He felt too much, he was too positive, and his constant fear of failure is annoying. Castiel is nothing but a nuisance," she said coldly. "Honestly, I think he came off the line with a crack in his chassis. He has never done what he was told. Not completely."
"Well you just drove us to the pet store and back, I trust you. But I also don't want an unlicensed driver alone in my car when in trying to become a nurse." She smiled, "You drive, and I'll disappear when we get there."
There were many trivial facts Castiel knew in regards to Dean Winchester, he loved cheeseburgers, as well as Led Zeppelin, he knew his favorite song, and favorite color, why he wore a necklace, what he wanted to be when he grew up- but which of these would be helpful? He wanted to be helpful.
Cas rolled his dark blue eyes, "I thought little brothers were supposed to annoy their older siblings only."
"I just-" Naomi sighed as she ran her hands over her face, resting her elbows on the kitchen counter. “How I'm supposed to manage a bunch of fifth graders for two months is beyond me."
"I'm familiar with a few of your brothers, if you must know. I familiarize myself with quite the interesting bunch, what with the homicidal brother and the suicidal brothe-"
Azazel's eyes widened once more as the body hit the ground, and Castiel remained silent from his position.
His sister rolled her eyes, "No dumbass, it's just a- never mind, you never get them anyways." "Besides," Naomi said smugly, "we both know Anna would get you anyways. Everybody knows she's the only one who'd be willing to fight for you."
Despite Dean’s lack of interest or care in school, he hurried off to his class as well- hoping maybe he’d see that brunette from home room.
- but if he takes me to see Pamela, then I'll see Pamela. I'm not hiding or leaving when he visits. Sorry."
Castiel's pensive expression softened, it was comforting for him to know Dean was such an easygoing person. It was another thing Castiel liked about the young man, he wasn't very serious or demanding, and Cas was well aware of the fact he needed more of those people in his life. He knew Dean would eventually bore of his serious views, and his awkwardness. Castiel didn't know why women entertained being socially inept, it was neither a fun nor interesting quality to have, and made having friends quite difficult. Not that Castiel had many examples of past made friendships to show, but he had plenty of failed attempts.
"Is something else bothering you, Dean?" His eyes narrowed. "Or am I not allowed to ask about that now either?"
Dean smiled, looking at how happy Cas was- and just from making him happy! Dean decided right then and there, he wasn't gonna screw this up, and he wasn't going to back away from any possible feelings this time.
"Okay, I just thought it might help," Sam said with a shrug. "If you change your mind, we share a room."
," Dean said softly, looking at him desperately, "man, ya gotta know- someone's got tell ya- it's just... Well, frankly, you're awesome."
The boys had a small number of classes together; English was always the same. It was taken over by drama and unenthusiastic students. Sam had already been assigned hours of homework, he'd done the math (he held back a laugh at the unintentional joke).
Dean nodded, tucking his head into his chin and hurrying up the stairs, slamming he and Sam's bedroom door behind him.
Naomi whipped around, her temper was something Castiel should have known not to mess with it, "And what will you do if I do? Sing to me about how loving God is and how I should forgive those who do me wrong?"
She had wagged the marker in front of his face, similar to the way Gabriel Novak held a bone in out to the neighbor’s dog. Castiel remembered frowning, turning away from the boring marker.
Sam rolled his eyes, "Don't worry, I'd fight my way in with The Styx playing as I sent the goons back to prison."
Anna lifted his chin, looking him in the eye, "Castiel, I have always been on your side. Always. No matter what. Don't worry; I'm not mad at you for going with Dean instead of coming home. Really, it's okay."
"You have always been taken care of, Castiel- Anna and Gabriel have taken care of you for so many years, you never saw our father's anger the way I did."
"You've barely gotten me any useful information, Castiel," Crowley said unhappily, leaning against the locker.
Dean nodded, shaking his head with a fond smile- really smiles shouldn't be adorable, but Cas just made them that way. Of course, he made everything adorable, not hat Dean would tell anyone that.
"Putting aside from the fact that I am white and therefore will never have to live in fear of racial profiling, paranormal or not, yes."
Surely he would not appreciate Castiel accusing him of being disloyal and cruel. Castiel did not want Dean to be angry with him. He certainly did not want to lose him.
He looked at the small rectangle, and carefully, softly, slowly unfolded the green paper- Dean rolling his eyes at Cas' attempts to always appease to those around him, would he just open the damn box?
And that, that was where Dean was unsure. He had no problem moving, he'd gotten used to it. And yet he felt guilty for not minding having to leave Cas, but they'd only each other for a few weeks- he had no reason to feel guilty.
things so much as he had needed them. Anna regretted the days when Castiel had been seen as a nuisance. When Castiel was younger he’d insisted on sleeping beside their mother. The family was uncertain what to do.
"I have never been so willingly vulnerable with another person. I understand I can shut you out and you can do the same. We should be toxic to one another, not attracted. And yet we are together." He smiled softly, "I enjoy being with you Dean. I do not mean to push you away and I apologize for when I do. I care a great deal for you. I want to be honest with you; I want to share things with you."
As long as he still had some time to himself he thought he could withstand the public high school he attended. Fortunately for Castiel, he lived in a small town, only 600 students attended his school. There were larger  schools within driving distance. He could go out of his way to attend a bigger school, with a bigger budget- but he would not have Anna drive farther so Castiel could attended a larger school.
He shrugged, "Thanks- the way I see it thought it's been 18 years now. There's not much anyone can say or do to change it. Believe me I watched people try, my dad was really religious before but if he didn't go crazy with it after she died- everything had to be perfect, we all had to be examples and show what a great mother she'd been by being the best we could, making her proud."
Dean frowned, running to Meg who- for once- didn't wear the same calm expression she usually did, "Meg! Where'd Cas go? Why'd he run off?"
Gabriel didn't plead with anyone. Gabriel sang and danced and shouted and made his presence known. He was not quiet.
"It does make me wonder though, where are the rest of the marks? I'm sure there were countless others." Crowley sighed, "Did they fade away?" He clicked his tongue, "Shame. I would have liked to see them."
Dean raised his eyebrows with a frown after he turned the radio off, "Thought you liked The Beatles, Cas?"
"I stand by my opinion, Finding Nemo is a cinematographic masterpiece. The animation of the sea and the color animals is beautiful and the plot line is comical and heartfelt."
'Don't worry, it's a party- it's crowded,' he though in annoyance, tired of his constant social ineptitude.
Dean hated to bother her with this, she seemed a nice lady. It wasn't her fault Dean was shit at relationships. He knew Cas was holding back an apology to her. She seemed kind, patient, pleasant. She was tall and dark, sturdy.
Gabriel whistled, "That's a lot of need for a puppy. Sounds like what those two really need is you."
“Well, actually, Anna almost gave me a literal push but I find the guinea pigs’ effective, logical arguing skills and big eyes were the final argument leading me to my conclusion.”
"May I borrow your car?" Castiel asked as they drove home. "I would never normally ask such a thing by it is of the utmost importance."
"While I didn't tell anyone about you, I knew Dean would want to help find you- Sam as well- and quite frankly I didn't mind having two extra shooters on my side." Crowley shrugged, "but, they're here- thought I'd give you a few minutes to get your bearings together first."
Gabriel open and closed his mouth, unsure what to say, other than a joke about coffee of course. Castiel shook his head and whatever anger had consumed him left just as quickly. He quietly walked back to his stool, carefully bringing his cup back to his lips. His hand patted its hardened green clay.
He dropped the man to the floor, the bell ringing (thank goodness) which proved helpful as the teacher was still calling for Castiel. He looked over to Dean whose face appeared to be an old combination of anger, surprise, and pride.
When the two got in the car Anna groaned, “Naomi forgot to fill the car up again! Ugh, why do I bother? She says her work is so important, 'she helps kids.'"
As Castiel noticed Dean winking at the brunette girl two rows behind him, he realized Dean probably didn’t have time for him either. As if he would he want to have time for Castiel anyways. He wasn’t special.
Crowley's man spoke up, "I think he's been coming here for a few weeks now, Lucifer. Angel boy said something about Lilith's loyalties, some shit you and Azazel were talking about, I think."
Castiel frowned, if he had waited and stopped playing the good Samaritan for five seconds, he would know that
She sighed, turning away from the window, "I know that, but I want to know where he is, Gabriel. After Dean called me I asked all of our siblings, and I drove around and I couldn't find him anywhere. I'm glad Dean said he's okay, but do you know how many years I've been watching Castiel?"
Castiel remembered climbing onto Gabriel's lap as they watched video after video of professional surfers.
Dean's eyes widened at the last statement (both from the cursing and the use of God's name in vain, neither of which Cas made a habit of doing), "Cas, look, I'm sorry I pressured you- we don't have to-"
Her pale hand quickly tapped Castiel’s door before he invited her into his room. Anna smiled and approached the teenager’s bed. She eyed Castiel’s desk before cautiously rolling the grey chair towards her.
"I... I do, I just- I don't know how. This is..." Cas scoffed, "you know, I've thought of how to tell you a million times, and I'm still not sure if I'm doing it right."
"Honestly, the thing is Cas... I'm just not- I don't really know how to accept gifts. Sorry if I made a big deal out of it, I didn't mean to."
The man soon stood atop the wave like a king. Whoever had been filming had stood near the man's family. His sons and daughters shouted with joy at their father's proud stance.
"Well it was not...” he frowned, biting his lip and leaning back against the purple chair. “It was not... th-there was a purpose behind it, of-of some- of some sort. There was a
"Yeah well, I think you're doing alright Cas. Honestly I think coming out here was a really good idea. Bobby and Gabe are gettin' along, and you found your pimp car-"
"You want to help," she said gently, "I know. That's why I let you help pay for my gas, and I try to keep my objections to a minimum- but this," she held up a few bills, "this is my way of helping you. Please, let me help pay."
He shook his head, "Well, there are other places you can call- maybe she went on a walk, she probably went on a walk you could be worrying over nothing- she probably just needed to get some air, no offense but sometimes our household contains rather stentorian individuals so Don't worry it's nothing it's nothing but we must look I'm not saying don't look because we
Luckily Sam had never told anything to Brady he’d regret. He was too smart for that, but he did try and befriend Brady. He let him copy off his homework (“Well he forgot to do it, Dean”) a few times, and he was always helping him out of trouble. Dean knew Sam, he knew he was a smart kid and that he was going places.
WARNINGS: Language (I realized I've never warned this before, whoops) family members being douche bags, brief nonconsensual flashbacks
Dean raised his head, was someone talking to him? He looked around the room, noting charts, graphs, and a bunch of boring students. But not a single student was looking at Dean.
"As a child I studied various religions, they are extremely interesting, and learning of them helped me to repress my ignorance and censorious views to a minimal. Ignorance can be a crucial tool in society's rejection of uniqueness among others."
Sam shook his head, chuckling, "Yeah, yeah that was made pretty obvious when you kissed at New Years."
Her smile brightened, revealing white teeth wrapped in blue wires. "Jason and I tell each other everything. So... I guess we're like an upgraded, modern Romero and Juliet."
"Of course. What better way to talk about yourself comfortably?" Her closed smile parted to show happy, white teeth.
Cas nodded, looking at the floor. Now that he had began speaking to Dean he has this overwhelming urge to tell him everyone, to be rid of everything- but he also wished to lock himself up, scared of what his admittance would bring. It wasn't as if Dean would ever accept him after this, he was disgusting, Dean would hate him. Cas didn't deserve to be with Dean, he didn't belong with him- Dean wasn't a fuck up like he was. He couldn't tell him any more.
Some people believed he took it too far, going after cases that weren't even his when he found new evidence instead of alerting the commissioner. But that was how John Winchester worked; he didn't listen to authority- even when he worked for the authorities. If he wasn't such a workaholic maybe he'd get in trouble for that, but John went out of state- traveled across the country for criminals, and he'd probably been given one free pass too many because of that.
WARNING: This chapter depicts a meltdown. If strong sensory descriptions make you uncomfortable this chapter can serve as a stand alone and will be briefly explained in the future.
Dean laughed softly, getting up from his chair, the brown saggy material trying to cling to him as he got up. He shook himself, feeling the material still clung to him as he walked to the stove. Dean looked back at Sam, opening the dusty cabinets- man; he really needed to clean this place.
"I mean I definitely spend a hell of a lot more time in there now." His eyes widened, "Not that I didn't shower before! I just- well I-" Dean laughed awkwardly, his smile a painful cry for help. "God I- I don't know when to stop, do I?"
Meg Masters. Castiel sighed, he had always liked Meg- but sometimes she could be overwhelming. She tried to act as if things hadn't changed. She certainly had. Castiel wouldn't lie- Meg had grown into quite the lovely young woman. Her dark curly hair was no longer in ringlets as it had been when she was a child, though it was still dark and wavy.
When Sam came downstairs that morning to a soaking wet kitchen, and a laughing soaking wet Cas and Dean, he only shook his head- knowing one of them would clean it up later, before grabbing a toaster, and going into the living room for breakfast.
He glared at her, hissing once more, "I'm serious- stop talking and listen for once, hear the engines and the laughter?"
It sounded like something Dean would say, though he wouldn't just raise his eyebrows as his classmates did- Dean usually smirked, but it was a kind smirk. Well, actually no, that wasn't possible- well, it was for Dean. Dean could make the same joke as his classmates and Castiel would not glare at him, or perhaps he would, but in a teasing manner.
Screams echoed off the next cell, a woman begging for mercy as something was ripped out of her. He couldn't do a thing to help her. He couldn't do anything.
"Might've been Crowley," The pierced man- Crowley's worker- said, "maybe the kid had some form of vengeance against you, sir."
"Jo!" Dean called, she looked at him, and he waved her over, ignoring the occasional look he got from others.
"N-no! You don't understand- you don't understand Anna! I-I-I-h-h-h-hit-it- it was re-he-heal! It's gonna happen again! Because I'm bad!"
To leave work would to be to act out of order, and Heaven forbid a Novak should do anything arbitrary.
He nodded, considering this, as Charlie said, “Of course, there’s the setback that he might kill his students if they don’t do their homework.”
The blonde sighed, pulling out a gun with a straight arm as he turned around, "You're so... unoriginal."
Castiel swallowed, attempting to keep the glare present on his face, "Crowley, I would not condone this."
“And remember,” she droned on, her flat voice boring students to sleep. “Remember that this report is 10% of your final grade.”
They were fading like old photos in the living room. Pressed clothes and sewn smiles. Anna had smiled. Father had not.
Cas shoved Crowley's chair backwards, watching the man and his chair fall backwards before grabbing the edge of the chair, stopping it just before Crowley fell to the ground. Cas glared at the man, and slowly brought the chair up, leaning in towards the chair, glaring at the short man before him.
Naomi walked in with a smirk, looking down at her little brother and leaning down, whispering, "Mommy and daddy are fighting again. Wonder which one will get the baby."
"Oh, okay, just asking," Sam said, turning his head to avoid seeing Dean's mocking face for checking on him.
It was also mentioned how odd it was that he didn't have a partner, his most regular being Bobby Singer. Bobby was an older man, and while John was a workaholic- Bobby was just a plan alcoholic. His wife was killed in a break in ten years earlier, and having no children he quickly set to work to bring her justice.
"The Beatles would never have given themselves such a confusing name. They had been The Beatles, The Silver Beetles, and The Quarrymen- but never would someone think 'The Beatles' to be a name."
The teenager's boring math teacher continued to point at the whiteboard, oblivious to their humor. Charlie and Dean both thought it hilarious that their teacher had yelled at them the first time they had started talking- when it was only about Star Wars- but had never caught them when they talked about girls that they thought were hot.
Sam frowned, looking at him with caution, "Well, no Cas, of course not- no one deserves to be punished so cruelly, people don't deserve to be punished over religion. It just doesn't make any sense."
He grinned, "Oh, I'll be more than happy to. You see, when little Lucy was a boy his momma died, and then his daddy was the only one around, so little Lucy got into some habits- started hanging out with the wrong crowd, dealing and doing drugs, pushed his daddy every chance he got 'till one day Daddy Novak snapped, and left. This made Lucy feel even more upset, so he became the worst he could be, at 18 he'd been arrested for shoplifting, drinking under the age, drinking and driving, possession of illegal substances, and domestic abuse."
Castiel’s shoulders slump as he sighs. He runs a finger over Dean’s thumb and wonders if Dean knows just how much Cas loves him. He isn’t sure how to say that but leaning against him is a sufficient substitute for now. Then he rests his head on Dean’s shoulder just because he can, and he wants to, and because he loves the boy sitting next to him.
Everyone inhaled around him, carbon dioxide mixing with oxygen before returning to hundreds of bodies. Bells were ringing in his ear, Sam's voice a gargled wind round his head. His head ached with something fuzzy and hot.
"We're not gonna do this," Dean said as he stepped aside, allowing Castiel inside, "we're not gonna pretend anymore that you're okay when we both know you're not."
And oh he was- Castiel was disgusted with himself for lying to his sister. He didn't deserve her love, and she gave it freely nonetheless- she should be revolted by him. In fact, that would be the only appropriate response to his response.
He chuckled humorlessly, "Jake ran off, didn't look back- any other neighbors were scared shitless, course there were two other dogs running up too so scared or not, the neighbors didn't stand a chance, and we were right by the forest so it only took a few minutes to separate me from the motel neighbors."
"Dean, I do not think I was speaking rationally when I wished to learn to drive- let's go back this isn't a good idea," Cas said as he gripped the steering wheel, biting his lip nervously.
He ran back and forth to the mirror like a wind up toy, as if one red bump was the end of his life. Who would memorize the meteor patterns of the 1980s when Sam was gone? Who could Sam trust to stay home every weekend and clean his magic kit?
Castiel groaned, further burying his face in his pillow. If not for his dark bed head poking and his feet, Anna wouldn't know her brother was
And Castiel- boring, pessimistic, ignorant to all social norms Castiel, was not one of those people.
So I'm going to try and make this short because it's almost 2 in the morning and I'm really tired, the only editing I have done at all in this chapter is italicize a few words, flashbacks, and the song lyrics. I'll come back and fix this later.
"I don't know man- er, dog," Sam said with a sigh, "I'm worried 'bout my brother and Cas too. Y'see Dean nearly went nuts trying to find him. Course, I bet you've seen them- you've been here for over a month."
"I will not argue with that statement, but at the moment I do not believe sitting would do me well. I believe it would be best to do perform a task which would distract me from my current anguish."
Gabriel whistled once more, "Seventeen huh? Don't you think it's a bit soon in your life to be going for the younger ones? Cradle robber."
"Come on in Cas, I've already set everything up for the present- Dean really does love these, this was a great idea, Cas," he said, walking across their musty carpet happily.
This never failed to amuse Dean, as he spent most of his math classes talking to the redhead besides him. Honestly, he was lucky that the girl he goofed off with was a genius, or else he'd probably be failing the class.
"Like a-" he sighed, biting his lip. "Like a stain on your window shield or a smudge on a glass vase.... like I am... dirt under the sun." He met her eyes, "Like I am unclean."
Now they honestly hadn't meant for Mrs. Winchester to be killed, from what the police had gathered they had broken into Sam's room to steal from the family. One of them had a flame thrower, and Mary had tried to get it away from them- considering that she thought they were trying to kidnap her son, which they very well could have planned to, but most police doubted that. Mary and the men fought with the flamethrower, but of course the men were okay.
Anna shook her head softly, knowing there was more to the story, "It's alright, Castiel. I believe you."
" Cas cried, all thoughts of discontentment with Lucifer vanished, not this, anything but this," "I'm
“Castiel, I understand how schoolwork gets to you- don’t work yourself up so much, and don’t worry about the food, I can handle this.”
"But we can't really relate to them, can we?" Eric continued in his bored, monotone voice. "I'm not gonna get married after three days."
"Pl-" Cas' voice cut off, quiet cries escaping his mouth, he brought his knees up from the floor and wrapped his arms around his legs, trying to muffle his crying in his legs.
Cas' lips rose and fell as Sam helped him to his feet. The two walked down the hall, and began walking down the small set of stairs before Cas turned to Sam.
"Lucifer is frightening, but the scariest part of him is that you would never believe me if you met him."
Dean laughed at Castiel's pleased expression as he slowed the car down, explaining to Castiel he'd be back in a moment. The blue eyed teen nodded, watching Dean as he slipped out of the vehicle and approached the bar they parked in front of. Dean opened the door to The Roadhouse with a grin, walking up to the bar with a skip.
"You know, your continued commentary on my dorsal side continuously leaves me confused as to the terms of our relationship."
Honestly, he just needed someone who wouldn't look at him with pitying looks- what the fuck was so bad about his life that Jo and Jess would give him that look?
Sam screamed of something horrid and unspoken. He knew too much of darkness to fear what it held. What was bothering his little brother, and why wouldn't he tell him? Whatever it was, Sam had no trouble telling Zeppie.
The grey room was small and Castiel's cries consumed it entirely, painting the walls blue and black. His coat fell around him like a stress blanket, crumpled and comforting. His fingers gripped the coats sleeves as he pulled his arms into himself.
"So dad left after you pushed yourself to be in all those precious clubs and sports and receive all those academic awards and
Cas' frown grew, the puppy jumped against his knees and he pet his head, not paying attention to him as he tilted his head at Dean, "They asperse me?"
Her hands tightened around her purse as she decided her and Amelia's plans would to have wait. A quiet, shut off Castiel was never a good sign.
"Well," Castiel said as they entered the study hall. "Gabriel tries; he always tries, as my brother is quite fond of sweets. Unfortunately, Michael does not approve- nor Naomi. Lucifer enjoys it, he thinks it wonderful, but only so he can terrorize children."
"Whether this is a lengthy conversation or not, I appreciate you offering your knowledge of presents and relationships," Cas said in his stern way.
"You just told me your boyfriend loves you,” she said with confusion. “That seems a pretty good place to stand. Did he seem uncertain when he said this?"
Castiel felt Anna’s eyes on him as he was reminded of a Beatles song. Not wanting to draw any more attention to himself, he did not hum. Anna gave him looks often enough and he didn’t want to cause her any extra stress.
"I'm sorry but I am not having sex with you, so I will not be fucking any idiots," Charlie said, "besides if I was to have sex with anyone, we all know it would not be a dude."
"My workers have order, loyalties. This," he pointed at Castiel, who looked down at the floor, "that was not orderly, and the only thing it was loyal to was your happy maker down there."
Her blue eyes flickered to the new student, “Dean, after announcements you’ll have to go to class, where are your books?”
Cas' eyes snapped to him, and he quickly covered his phone with his hand, "I assure you Dean, I am not observing promiscuous women."
, a part of him answers, rushing to fill any silence in his head. He isn’t feeling… poorly per say, but Dean asked if he was alright and Castiel isn’t sure if
The older brother shoved his hand in his book bag, searching for a pencil, “You worship a man in diapers, what’s your defense?”
"Dean, Jess says she doesn't know- and Jo, Charlie, and Ash haven't seen him either," Sam said, looking at his brother.
Dean said nothing about the exchange as he walked back to Cas, down the faded blue halls and into the small bathroom. When Dean walked into the room Cas had already stepped into the shower, and was attempting to find the bar of soap. Dean laughed as Cas muttered to himself about the incompetence of slippery bars of soap, and deciding to use shampoo in its stead.
"Yeah, yeah, whatever- nobody can afford to care about every lie they tell anyways. Now, you don't have to if you don't want to, but we'd really like it if you would come back Clarence- don't let some weirdo ruin you having a good time."
"But today he did that, kind of backed away from me and left. He’s closing in on himself again, Charlie. He was like that all the time when we first met, and he’s going back to it. He’s being quieter and he’s always stressed beyond belief about homework, honestly, I don't care if he helps me with homework; it's not that I care about him based on if he helps cause I don’t-"
He wrinkled his nose, "Oh, gross Dean! I know it's okay but I'm not sticking anything in anyone!" He rolled his eyes, “It’s not a du-"
Dean stepped slightly closer to the door, eyes softening further, "Oh, oh no- no Cas, no we'd never- we'd never make you do anything you didn't want to."
"I...I just have to wait," Castiel said, sniffling, his sobs having somewhat queted,"I-I have to w-wait, because I'm going to be f-f-found. I just have to wait for it to happen, because I know it will. Because I'm bad."
He frowned, walking over to the criminal, "We're here because at 25 years old you're a drug lord and assembled one of the largest gangs in the state."
He sighed, "No Cas, just shove it in. Come on Cas, we're gonna be here forever if you don't. I know you're nervous, and you don't have a lot of experience- but don't be nervous, it'll be fine."
Castiel frowned, tilting his head at his older brother, Gabriel thinking the puzzled expression looked odd on his young face, “No, I do not have anything against contractions Gabriel.”
"Uh... you're okay with doing something illegal?" Anna raised her eyebrows as they drove closer to their house. "I'm not mad, I'm
Castiel chuckled, "Well, that's reassuring to hear, if a little ridiculous. My apologies Gabriel, I believe I have made a... friend. He is quite a jokester, and I have had to adjust to making retorts."
Cas shook his head, walking to the living room, "Dean, you are allowed to be recognized for doing something nice."
'Yes, yes I have. Hours alone, with an older man. I've had a lot of time to think about it.' "No, not really. Driving is a dangerous task, Dean- besides, I could always have someone drive me."
Dean nodded, smiling at his nervous... well, at this point they were only friends. Really Dean wished they could be together more often, hell, the guy had only spent the night once. On accident of course, and he remembered Cas had woken up in a panic when it had happened a week ago.
Dean smiled, "No, no, I didn't- he doesn't really say 'holy this' 'holy that' it was just an example.
Gabriel scoffed, "Please, Cassie. It'd take more than a little sibling rivalry to buff up this armor, lucky for you I'm covered in a thick layering of muscle."
“True, but on the other hand, it might whip some kids into shape. I mean, everyone’s going to respect Darth Vader- or they won’t, and he’ll make an example of him.”
He felt sick to his stomach when he saw the smirking old man greet Gabriel, holding back the bile in his throat as his uncle waved to him with fake cheerfulness.
“I mean, seems pretty self explanatory,” Dean said with a frown. “Obviously I wasn’t where I was supposed to be. It’s pretty obvious, Gordon.”
"That's not true, “Sam argued. “I have to listen to obnoxious volumes all the time. After all, I have to hear you sing along don't I?"
Dean released him and Sam attempted to fix his hair, glaring at him. "Sounds like you're just jealous, you jerk."
"No!" Cas shouted, hands now clenched at his sides, tears streaming down his cheeks as he yelled, "No no no no
Cas looked down at him, and plopped to the ground. He began to open his notebook, and quickly pulled out a highlighter- swiftly flipping through the pages. Dean looked at him, and back to his folded hands.
Garth raised his eyebrows, staring at the tall boy as he spoke. Castiel continued to shuffle through his bag, pulling out pads of paper and books as he spoke. Castiel Novak wasn’t a bad guy, he was just... different. Something Garth had never been able to put a finger on. Maybe it was his intense eye contact (if he acknowledged you) or maybe his height?
He sighed, "I can see you've been knocked off your rocker so I'll backtrack. The name's Crowley, your brother- not the depressed one and not the crazy partier- is an arrogant asshole, though I suppose that could be confused with Michael. Anyways, my point is your family's not too far from being mommy dearest and I'm here to help you get the hell out of here."
She smiled, watching her brother calmly move his graphite pencil across his beloved sketchbook. Castiel’s room was small but it was perfect for him. A single, rectangular window lay behind Castiel’s back, flooding light over his white bedspread.
Dean nodded, and they walked off to the bathroom, ignoring Sam's look of confusion- he'd have to wait for now. Sam and Jess looked at them from the bar with concern, and both started to stand before Dean shook his head, and they unsurely sat down again. Dean opened the door to the bathroom quietly, hoping not to further upset Cas.
I'd just like to give a huge thank you for all the support I've been receiving from everyone for this story! Thank you so much to anyone who's given comments, kudos, bookmarks- it doesn't go unnoticed and I really appreciate it:)
A bullet smashed into the wall beside him, breaking furniture around him. The bang bounced around in his head, the sound of shattering glass resounding in his ringing ears. It was certainly a powerful weapon.
He can see Cas lifting the headphones on and off his ears now, as Dean stands in the door way smiling at his friend. Cas had been drawing before he came in. The faded green sketchbook Dean gave him for his birthday lay beneath his sweater covered wrist. The sweater was dark blue like Cas’ eyes and frayed around the edges from all of the times Cas rubbed the sleeves against his face.
The siblings have somehow found themselves all playing different parts in this sing-along-kitchen-dance. Gabriel shouts what he can over the music. Anna made sure to check that the volume wasn’t too much on Castiel’s ears. It was a small gesture, and it went the world to Cas. He wishes he could tell her just how much he cares for her, how much he cares for Gabriel. He wants to tell them that he loves them, he wants to hug them and speak sweetly to them whilst keeping their friendly banter. But for once he doesn’t disrupt the cheerful moment with large declarations or dark conversations. He lets himself feel this happiness even if he has to grit his teeth against his anxieties.
It was as if a red hot rage suddenly possessed Dean, he stepped far past Naomi's personal boundaries and quite frankly he didn't give a shit. He was too pissed to care about something as unimportant as personal space right now. God no wonder Cas was so scared he lived with an emotionally retarded psychopath!
Sam grinned as they walked out to the car, looking at him as he got into the car and said, "Course you do, always best to show that to your... friends, as you put it the other day."
“I want this with you, and I need you to believe me because I want however much of you you’ll let me have for as long as you’ll entertain it,” Dean says.
She laughed, "That's your takeaway? And if you'd paid attention when we watched it you would know he was a
Lucifer was not as talented with acting as Castiel was, or perhaps Castiel simply paid too much attention to detail. Or maybe Lucifer hadn't been trying to act. Perhaps he wasn't ashamed of leading a path astray from the family, perhaps he wasn't ashamed of who he was.
They were peeling off his fingers like black ink. How could he be human without them? His family made his prints. They built the floor beneath his feet and set the sun above his head.
"Really? I mean, don't get me wrong I'm always happy to see you be the life of the party but you've been pretty chill the last few days, and kinda... Well, not yourself."
"Well gee, Cas, thanks. Honestly though, I don't get why the guy didn't have us draw what we wanted to make first like normal art teachers," Dean grumbled, glaring down at his small gray attempt of pottery.
Dean looked up at Cas, smiling softly- god he was so lucky, "Yeah Cas," he wiped his eyes, "yeah I really do."
It seemed ludicrous to question the length of Dean's stay in his life (and with him all of Castiel's new friends and happiness). Yet his worries continued to whisper fears into the corners of his darkest thoughts. Castiel knew that a relationship of any kind required trust, but he found himself unable to trust Dean with these concerns.
"Well what can we learn from them, anyways?" Charlotte exclaimed, not even bothering to raise her hand.
"Y'know, you're happiest when you're with him," Sam said softly. "I've seen it; you laugh more and smile more. All of the jokes I've heard a million times? You save 'em all for Cas."
"Mind?" He laughed, and raised his eyebrows, "Mind?! You say it like it's some bad thing I have to put up with. Cas, man, I'm happy you want to kiss me- I'm freakin thrilled."
It wasn't fair, what right did their dad have to push them around? What excuse did he have to treat them like children? It didn't matter how often he barked out orders, he still wasn't a real dad. He'd never be a real dad.
"Would you like to attend the lesson as well, Gabriel? Not as a student of course, but simply to watch?"
His long, tan fingers flipped through a faded textbook before slamming it shut. Castiel frowned, walking up to his boyfriend.
"Wow, how do you know all of those religions?" Sam said, the teenager looking at him with his big, brown eyes.
Dean laughed as he heard the door closed, he turned to Cas, who was sitting next to him on the old blue couch, "Haha, of all the perks I've considered of having a dog, that one has never come up."
Eh, what was the use? No point in Dean standing around like a virgin on prom night. It’s not like Cas was wrong.
"Sorry, I'm not trying to be some clingy girl Cas, I just- well I thought you might want to see me. And... and I wanted to see you too," Dean said looking at the school's tiled floor with embarrassment.
The impala approached the older man slowly, Queen playing softly (stupid Sam, making him turn his music down) and Dean gladly raised the volume. The old man teetered on the large blue bike, looking side to side- not having noticed the music was coming from behind him, damn age really did mess with your hearing.
Cas only smirked at the teenager, who was intent on not looking at him as his tan skin turned pink. He had to admit, he had missed being in Dean's car- it was nice to speak together, just the two of them. No Crowley to ruin anything, no siblings to pull them away, no school work for him to stress over.
Cas sighed, stuffing his hands into the pockets of his trench coat as he followed Lucifer. The crowd hid Castiel from his brother, who had no reason to thunk Castiel would follow him- which lead him to think Lucifer would not suspect him. Something positive was happening to him, for once.
"He had the perfect alibi to come see me. He planned it rather well, I suppose- it only ever happened twice a year at most, certainly not regular enough to raise suspicion. So no one was suspicious."
His smile grew, "I bet you thought you were so clever, so high up, untouchable no one could ever get you. But here I am, and with me, the consequences."
“Honors bio, he’s really smart. Says he wants to be a lawyer, actually. So he went in to ask Ringo there a question.”
Dean frowned, "No, but if you weren't such a nerd we could head for school at 7:30 like normal people. Or 7:40- maybe 7:45 if we pushed our luck."
. He laughed and laughed, and all the while I was crying and screaming underneath him and he- he didn't care- he never cared."
about what you think of our mom, but that's what she was! Our mom! Not yours, not mine, not Cassie', not Anna's!
"You know, when you said you were a talented dancer- I thought you were lying, but now I see you're actually quite confident on the dance floor."
Dean talks to Sam. Castiel learns more about Lucifer. Castiel remembers. He decides to talk to Dean.
Castiel's brow furrowed into his cute frown, "No matter how many times you have informed me of this line, I have never found it to be reasonable. Why would humans be informed of when an angel receives their wings? If it truly takes time to receive them, as you say this movie claims."
Dean was curious as to Cas' reasoning, but he didn't ask. As he saw the raven haired teenager's blue eyes dart eagerly around the table, taking everyone in, always coming back to rest on Dean- he didn't really care why Cas hadn't come to lunch before, he was just glad he had started.
Not that Dean would have asked anyways, after all, it was none of his business where his father had been these past few days.
Castiel plucked a scrap of paper from the desk, his now steady hand curving and looping until the lines and scratches formed an unspoken label. Before Castiel spoke, his mother had insisted he carry a white board everywhere he went. Naomi Novak had bought a clean, professional black erase marker for Castiel to use.
Crowley looked down at his shaky hands disappointedly, peeling them off his coat, "Calm down Leo, don't get so worked up over a few words."
They had aggressively pulled his screaming body forward, throwing him against the old floor with dirty grins that made Castiel sick to his stomach.
"Sam," he said with a raise of his eyebrows, "if you go upstairs, you can have the puppy all to yourself."
Dean practically jumped out of the kitchen chair, grabbing his jacket and slipping it on a quick, easy movement, opening the garage door and pulling his keys out of his pocket.
It was only the beginning of February, and Castiel was glad he had not taken off his suit or coat for the walk, as it was lightly snowing. Dean, always in his leather jacket, was also warm, thankfully, as it was also windy and slushy out. They reached the bottom of the steps, and Zeppie barked happily, not having left the building for a few days- only walking back and forth along the outdoor apartments halls.
The large room was lonely and dark without the other Novak's whispers. Michael hardly left a sign of his presence but a stray coat on his bed, but it was a reminder. Gabriel's bed was in stark contrast to the twins’ empty beds, covered in thick quilts and wrappers he claimed he was too busy to throw away.
Cas sighed, shoulders sagging, "I just... There's... Th-there's so much I haven't told you, so much I haven't told anyone. I just..." He looked up at the other male, "Dean, have you ever told a lie for so long that telling the truth no longer seems imperative? That the lie just becomes the truth, in a way?"
"Right? It was such a creative way to continue conversations on racism and mistreatment." He rolled his eyes, "It's insane how we still have to discuss why racism is wrong. The other day Ruby and I were talking about society and just how screwed up it is. Do y'know this kid was messing with her the other day before I'd started talking to her?"
"Yeah, actually, I'm gonna paint it in black and yellow and then put a little black bat on the top. It's gonna be like the Batman logo," Dean said.
Sam smiled, eyeing Castiel before walking ahead. Castiel hurried to match his friend's pace. The freshman frowned, looking back at the hallway.
Aliyah shone a light in Castiel's eyes but in that light he became more and more aware of the darkness which had enveloped him. How was he to accomplish anything on his own?
Cas frowned, "I am sorry, I cannot. My uncle will be arriving tonight, and I have no doubts he will insist I stay at his side- but perhaps the day after tomorrow?"
Not that Dean’d be staying long enough to keep friends, he really shouldn’t be making them- but whatever, besides Dean liked this guy.
As their silver car pulled up to the large high school, Anna turned to her brother. “You know Cas, if you want… I don’t have to drive you to school f it makes you uncomfortable.”
Dean turned sharply on Sam, "Don't say that. She'll be fine, she's mine and I take care of her- her getting older isn't something I have to worry about, 'sides we'll grow old together."
There was that sheepish look again. Castiel shook himself of those uncertainties. He had wanted to give Zeppie to Dean and so he has.
Castiel felt his cheeks heat up, and looked down once more. Wonderful, now he had most certainly hurt Dean's feelings, the only person he had met who had ever actually shown any margin of interest in him.That's what he got, trying to make friends; didn't he know he always screwed everything up?
yes, focus on Pamela. He heard her easy voice “Breathe Castiel, just breathe”. He closed his eyes, sat down, not caring if someone were to see him. It would be okay, nothing had to happen- Dean and he didn’t
"You know they're social creatures?" She stared through the glass as she spoke, "They actually love to be together. Guinea pigs are supposed to be in herds. He used to have a buddy but the little guy was just too small, he couldn't make it. Now this little guy's all alone."
'Not again not again not again not again- please, please not again!' Cas thought. 'Anything but this! Anything!'
Cas tilted his head, thinking with a frown, brow furrowed once more, "It is not any Beatles song, I know that."
Castiel's head whipped to the downstairs, surprised that his siblings and father were home early. He paused from his playing, running over to pause "Hallelujah Chorus", praying his father had not heard the noise.
Dean shrugged, looking at Gabe. "Yeah, well, the apartment's not that far a drive, besides I wanted to talk to you," Dean turned to face his boyfriend.
"You know how to take care of a family, I've seen you do your own work- you are smart, and you're kind, caring, and strong. You're extremely resilient, you always try so hard to make others happy- even when you're thrown into new situations you do not understand, you help those around you."
"Well, technically you wouldn't see me say it again- you would hear me say it again, because I never drew or wrote it out, so you never really saw it to begin with."
Anna watched the scene unfold before her, not speaking. She could already hear what Castiel would say, 'Unless you mean he would behave for Lucifer or act in a kindhearted manner, Crowley cannot possibly be good.' Or something like that, Anna grimaced as she thought of her brother's involvement with Crowley, god she hoped he hadn't been too mixed up in this.
He wretched into the bowl, acid burning his throat as he choked on foul water and the food in his stomach. Now he would get in trouble. Now he would pay.
He rolled his eyes, "Okay, no time for you being an asshole, he'll be here soon- have you noticed anything off about him lately? He was being kind of weird in art."
Occasionally he would pull himself from his studies to whisper something he considered humorous to the elder Winchester.
"I can't believe I managed to get a spot in the garage last night, normally Naomi and Michael's car is there, and Gabriel's- guess we beat them for once, huh?"
Cas smiles. He wants to rest his head on Dean again, but this is an important conversation and Cas doesn’t want to repeat past mistakes. He turns towards Dean instead, their sneakers touching from their proximity. Dean clears his throat and Cas suspects he is in for some Dean Winchester advice, so he waits, and he listens.
Castiel briefly lifted his lips in that awful attempt of a smile he had, deciding not to mention that’s why he was here as well. He’d made Dean uncomfortable enough as it was, and saw no reason to continue this unintentional awkwardness. Knowing Castiel, he would screw things up again whether or not he made a conscious effort to be courteous.
Anna scoffed, “It’s a game my dear Castiel. You can’t just give up and let me win, then there’s no point. Besides, I don’t need to try for bravado- it’s a natural gift, especially when it comes to games.”
His small fingers fumbled for the stop button. His breath hitched as he heard his father screaming. Castiel knew his father's anger. It was terrifying, and he wasn't sure what Lucifer had done- but he prayed he would be forgiven.
"You know, if you would like, I could get us out of here for a while- I mean, it's not a big deal to me," Lucifer said with a shrug, waving for them to follow him into his bedroom.
Dea fell silent before speaking once more, ignoring the sting in his chest. "Cas, look man, I didn't mean it that way. I just meant-"
While Castiel was calm and fluid, Dean seemed curdled and agitated. Castiel noticed Dean's rigid posture from across the room. His mouth was twisted into something sour.
But Dean was worried about Cas, hell, part of him was actually scared. He knew it was stupid, but with the anniversary coming up, well, he was concerned about his friend- Dean was terrified another friend of his would be hurt. He really shouldn't be affected by this, after all, he'd seen more people die than he could count- and that's not counting the original murder victims.
The man fell back, knocking into others. He felt the people staring at him- and his pulse quickened. Oh no, what had he done? What had he done?! He shoved someone, he hurt people- he did something bad, he did something
As Castiel and Anna silently followed their older brother down the stairs, Castiel noticed Anna's hands were shaking, and he wordlessly wrapped his own hand around hers, smiling at her softly. She smiled wearily at him, thankful as she briefly squeezed his pale hand.
reason- Dean wasn't disappointed in him.  Castiel stared at him, before his gaze dropped to the floor. He wiped his nose, sniffling- this was ridiculous, he needed to pull himself together.
“You know what’s unfortunate about this game?” Anna said, struggling to keep from falling flat on her rear.
Suddenly someone was against Castiel, a bald taller man, pushing against him- he felt his spine pinch.
Castiel looked behind Dean, noticing he still had his book bag slung over one shoulder. He frowned, his eyebrows furrowing in a way Dean noticed they did quite often. Dean nodded walking over to his locker, Castiel following him silently.
"If this troubles you both, perhaps something else?" Cas said with the hint of a smile, his eyes lit up, "Why don't you two drive in your impala, Dean? That always seems to cheer you up."
"Or are you going to silently watch me as you think about how much you hate yourself? Neither is going to change things Castiel so why don't you just get-"
Her heart ached at seeing Castiel in such distress. His shoulders shook with high pitched, short cries that wretched from his mouth as if his tongue was being pulled out. His blue irises mixed the sea with sorrow as salt water fell from his eyes.
"Yeah well," Dean paused and sighed, wishing he had a beer to calm down, "I'm not going to graduate anyways."
"Hey yeah, why would we care? 'Sides, doesn't Heaven have better things to do than to clanging around with people's instruments? I mean, it's not like it affects us," Dean said with a confused expression.
He frowned, still whispering, "Do what? Hide? I'm sorry, I was scared. Something broke, and father wouldn't stop screaming. I thought he was going to- going to... throw something at me."
Albeit was mostly due to his lack of studying. Still, Castiel always began class with one of Dean's beautiful, blinding smiles. He felt a weight building in his stomach with the knowledge that today would not be the same.
Naomi's face momentarily lit up with realization, and she turned around to face her brother, "Ah, Castiel. You, I could ask."
He stepped closer, "Look Cas I... Shit man I- I'm the first to throw on a fake smile and I know I'm being pretty damn annoying, but I just..."
"Won't work love, Cas did more than fulfill his job and I refuse to remain in someone's debt even if it's unaddressed. We both know I owe him a favor so I'm doing what he always asked me, watching out for you-"
Dean raised his eyebrows, "I took you out for a burger," he smiled resignedly, "but fine, I'll stop fighting a big celebration if that'll make you happy, Cas."
His eyes returned to her tired, worm face. Was she making a threat, or a joke? Deciding not to take his chances, Dean quickly excused himself and headed towards the lunchroom. He cursed Sarah Woodland and her gorgeous blue eyes- wasn’t she supposed to keep him awake?
"It's talk like that, that either gets you sex or ruins your chance of ever having it. Seriously man, you're either gonna freak girls out, or charm them into taking their clothes off for you."
"Well that's great, Gabriel," she said softly, forcing the present calm in her voice as she got out a rag. "Did you have any other groundbreaking news, because right now I'm really busy.”
Castiel said nothing, eyes resting on his brother's face. Gabriel returned the stare, grassy eyes meeting his ocean stare.
Honestly, Castiel would like- more than anything- to be small again, and run around, without a care in the world. Now he had things to worry about, and people who wanted to help him. This was still something Cas was apprehensive about- asking for help, telling others when something happened to him.
"Wait a minute," Sam stepped back, bending down to open his locker. "I have something that could help!"
Dean scoffed, smiling at Cas' stoic expression. Cas merely shook his head as he began driving through and around many stacks of crushed cars. Dean smiled as he saw his boyfriend concentrating, bright blue eyes staring down the faded grass as he turned in between piles of old vehicles.
And, hell, not that Dean wanted Cas to pour out a sob story about every damn thing in his life! But Dean was worried for Cas, Dean was so scared something was going to happen to him.
He planned additional labels throughout the house as he took a step backwards. He sat at his desk, headphones pulled over his ears as he worked. He was unsure how much time had passed before the knocking of
Dean slowly turned around to face Sam, a glare present in his face, "Sam I swear to god if you don't shut your damn mouth I'll kill you."
Sam couldn't find Dean. He was powerless. But he'd be damned if he'd let their dad fall into blame and drinking. He'd be damned if someone else became powerless.
"What? Not good enough? Look, I'll even have you call them 'daddy', finally get some love from old John? What you always wanted, right? Because if it's attention you want mate, I'll let you spread your legs and I'll give you all the attention you dese-"
Castiel smirked, ignoring his immense discomfort with the situation, "A whore? And yet I still won't have sex with you."
"He has grown a little over the past few months, I believe he is 6'1 now- wait a minute, what are you trying to suggest? I am not infatuated with Dean Winchester."
Castiel placed a hand on his arm, speaking softly. "I will not leave you. If you feel safer at my home, you and your brother are welcome to bide there."
Glassy blue eyes looked up at him, tears running down his cheeks. Cas stared at Dean, offering a forced, watery smile. Dean was here, and for that he was thankful. At least Dean wouldn't leave, at least- for
Why did Cas hide from Dean and Meg? Why was he always so by the books? Why did his older siblings scare him? Where the hell was his dad?!
"Which, personally, I don't understand- we all understand we're going to die, why does it become such a big deal when someone voices that opinion?" He frowned, and turned in his heels to face Azazel once more. "Do you think you're invincible?"
Castiel made a soft noise as Dean pressed his lips against his own. Cas' tongue slowly poked out, asking for permission. Dean greeted him and they deepened the kiss, long, and slow, full of compassion and ease.
She smiled at him, and shook her head, whispering,”No Castiel, the cross won’t fall. The wires may seem weak because they’re clear, but they’re very strong.”
There were so many questions Dean still had, so many things he didn't know about Cas. Cas knew everything about Dean. Cas knew about the fire, about his dad drinking, about his dad leaving Dean to watch Sam since he was eight, about Dean's desire to be a police officer, about the hound, hell- about Alastair!
"I don't know if that was supposed to be an insult to me, or gross me out- either way, I don't want to hear anymore."
The young blonde girl who disappeared without a trace, Bobby had gone off about her case so many times- how they never found her, she was a nice girl, looked for her for months and never found her. Bobby was not to be counted out of experienced men, he had seen his fair share of blood.
Castiel winced, raising a hand to his temple. Dean frowned at the movement before inviting an uncomfortable Castiel inside.
Cas could no longer hide his amusement at his friend's irritation, his mouth slipping from its harsh line and into a smirk.
"Do you mean Castiel's brother? My friend who went missing the other day? Which I called you about, but you said you were busy- that Lucifer?"
Really, Dean hadn't known what to get Cas. What he'd known is that Cas could be pretty uptight, and needed to relax once in a while, be happy- how could he do that? How could Dean change his constant schedule of work, pray, sleep?
"Well, here we are," Dean said, stopping front of a lab. "Freshman honors biology." He wrapped Sam up in an unexpected tight hug, sniffling. "I’m so proud of you."
He chuckled as he stood before his brother, "The cute girl with the curly dark hair? She was... what, 13? Yes, she would have made a lovely child, she would have fit in so
Sam was gangly and nerdy and had to study for hours to do well in anything. He was angry with John and angry he could never fit into the family. Sam was always the freak. Dean didn't need pets, Dean didn't need
His mouth quirks to the side when he looks at Castiel and there is a sadness in those green eyes that Castiel can’t hold in his hands, but he feels the weight of it against his chest. Cas is prepared to ask a question when he hears a sharp hitch in Dean’s breath. Blue eyes are instantly on Dean, scanning his face for a bruise or a hurtful truth. No, there’s nothing to hurt him here. Dean is just expressing his emotions, Cas reminds himself, and when people express emotions it means they have to actually emote.
Sam nodded, sitting up on the couch, inviting Castiel to sit with him as well, "It really is ridiculous," he said with a frown.
"Hey it's-it's just a nickname, " Dean chuckled, "Come on you guys, don't have to fight over everything."
Dean walked up behind him, keeping a certain amount of space between them for Cas' sake- he knew Cas had a personal space problem, something more if Dean's suspicions said anything, so he tried to keep those in mind.
The younger boy nodded, "And I understand that, wanting to do well in school, Cas. But aren't you hungry? Can't you take a break for a few minutes? Please?"
Dean was a fan of gorgeous people, he liked to keep as many around him as possible. And Sarah Woodland, with her thick, curly dark hair, and her plump, pink mouth and those big blue eyes? Sarah was more than gorgeous; Dean wouldn’t mind keeping Sarah around him.
He hummed happily at the recognizable tune. Castiel endured many unanswered questions in his life, but he knew without any doubt that
Despite Sam's- Cas knew- kind intentions, Cas could only roll his eyes at the commenting that ensued after his question. Dean didn't want a big celebration- Dean probably wouldn't want a present either, but that's why Castiel hadn't asked him.
They both had softer chins, and similar mouth shapes- they both had softer voices, and where the others were emotionless, they were simply calm. Really, Anna felt she had more in common with Castiel on the inside than she would ever have with Naomi.
Sam put the puppy down, allowing him to walk around once more, Cas going from smiling at Dean to the puppy as the German shepherd scampered around.
He nodded, and she hurried back to her plate to finish her pancake as he stood by the garage door patiently. She grabbed her green jacket, slipping it over her pale arms and shouting out a goodbye to whatever siblings remained at the house. Castiel opened the garage door for her, waiting for her to pull the car out, and then closing it once more before getting in the car.
Several aspects of this story are personal for me, though not all, and I had intended to further some of these subplots for my own sense of mind and processing. Castile going to therapy in order to learn to be kind to himself? Me. Internalized homophobia from Dean and/or Cas at points? Me. Older sibling born out of wedlock which causes Family Drama and people being Assholes? Can relate. Emotionally abusive relationships with parents, nightmares about not being able to save your family, depression, bullying, anxiety, Castiel’s #TerribleSelfImage? All based on experiences of mine. Not to alarm anyone! Because I am certainly doing better than I was at 15. And I appreciate everyone supporting “Break Me Out.”
Castiel’s face relaxed, and he looked at Dean with gaping eyes. Dean scoffed, “You’re wrong, about not being right Cas, you belong here as much as anyone else.”
"Are you sure you don't want me to tell him to come back later, Cas? I can tell him you're not feeling well right now."
Their small two bedroom apartment had one bathroom, a kitchen, and a very, very small attempt of a living room. There was a small, square, black and white tv, a shower with mostly cold water, and a heater that would shut itself off- this was the apartment's best electrical and plumbing features, and it was sad that they had suffered worse.
When he was still met with silence, Castiel frowned and pulled out a chair. The chair's legs screeched against the floor. They both cringed.
She did make everything sound easy, of course. But maybe that's because it was, at least in theory. His sneakers slapped the concrete as he awaited his ride.
Every time Cas came over, Sam was there. Which, whatever- Sam wasn't a bad kid or anything, and he spent a lot of time working on homework. But Dean wanted to spend some time alone with Cas, even if part of that time was spent staring- appreciating- no, that really wasn't much better... um,
“Already there, we need to move off yellow,” Anna said, struggling not to knock her hand and foot on yellow against each other. “Castiel, I’m sure you’d do fine- don’t be so negative.”
"Well, I have quite a prodigious family as you know, not even counting the mass number of cousins I have- though simply having a large family may appear facile it is actually quite difficult, the belief that they are distinguished compared to the rest of the citizens does not help."
Sam shook his head, "You'll be fine. Look, you're wearing a sweater- and that's not how you would normally dress, so take the sweater off."
Being with Cas was... well... kind of awesome, to put it simply. Course it'd only been for two days, yesterday and today. Tomorrow was January first, and The Roadhouse was having a party- which Dean and Sam planned on going to, and Dean had invited Cas to come with them, which hopefully he did.
"I'm Jo," said the older blonde, reaching out her hand to shake. She smiled, "Think I'm not pretty huh?"
"Oh, no, this won't be useful at all. Times have changed, but may I ask you one more question Castiel?"
Another reason Dean would not tell Castiel his desire to share more hours with him, is that if Dean insulted himself Cas would stare at him. Sometimes he'd glare at him and say he was wrong, but most times... he'd just stare. His friend would stop whatever he was doing and turn to look at Dean, looking at him until Dean began to feel awkward.
He didn’t like it here. His shaking fingers suddenly remembered what he’d intended to do as he pulled his headphones over his ears. The headphones pressed against his face, the remaining juice of the orange running down his cheek.
His red eyes moved lazily around the room, too tired and too embarrassed to meet Aliyah's kind face. Life was wrung from him like water from a rag. He felt the fabric twisting and tightening around his body until his energy squelched and squirted to the floor. He seeped through the carpet like piss over new clothes, disgusting.
Lucifer looked at his siblings, raising his eyebrows before scoffing, sticking his leg out the window, "Your sense of loyalty is ill placed, and stupid." He stuck his other leg out the window, "These people don't care about you, they don't care about any of us."
Crowley stumbled back slightly, quickly regaining his poise as he smirked, adjusting his black overcoat calmly with his hands he looked back at his posse, "You see ladies and gentlemen, Castiel here is under the impression that he is better than us."
Castiel deals with the repercussions of making a deal with Crowley. Dean grows suspicious and talks to Meg. Crowley and Cas have a meeting. Cas and Dean take the dog for a walk.
”That’s not being a nerd, that’s being an avid movie watcher- which is perfectly normal, and sorry if I enjoy impersonating the most badass guy ever. I watch movies from my generation, and I like Batman. What’s so weird about that?”
Dean laughed, and turned on his music. As he began flipping through his Queen tape he noticed an older man in a blue exercising suit, biking by their car. Dean paused; grinning as he turned up his music.
"Hell yeah you did," Dean said with a small as Cas turned around a corner of Bobby's garage, "you're doing awesome man."
The wood of the wall next to him shattered, the force throwing him back. The casing of the wall was weak and dirty, dusty and old, the bullets causing parts of the wall to fall. Castiel covered his mouth, paying no one would see him.
What do you think of Cas’ siblings so far? Are you feeling the second hand embarrassment from Dean yet? I know am...
Dean's body trembled as he went limp against Alastair's touch, knowing obedience would help him, silent as he waited.
Dean smiled, shaking his head and rolling his eyes, "Of course you know the answer. What kind of a guy knows that?"
Castiel chuckled and slowly shook his head. He exhaled shakily, breath rattling as it fell from his mouth. He looked away from his brother.
"Cas I'm just- I really can't take any more positive reinforcement right now," Dean said, sighing as he rubbed his face.
"It's about time you came to visit me, ya idjit," Bobby said when he saw Dean, rising forms his chair.
The rest of the day progressed similar to art class- Dean kept thinking back to his dad and having his attempts at conversation messed up. Cas tried to make him feel better in homeroom, and he tried in study hall- and to a certain extent he did make things better, actually, Cas did pretty well for himself.
"What will you be discussing, sir?" Azazel said, yellow eyes staring into blue, "If... I am allowed to ask, of course."
He scanned the parking lot, looking for Anna or Gabriel. He still had a lot to explain to them, a lot to tell. Like why he was even attending therapy.
"Sam I know said it'd be fine that I'm locked in here, but I appreciate if 'it being fine' happened sooner than later," she said as the bell rang.
"Although..." she eyed a large chunk of her blonde hair. “The sooner we get my hair out, the finer it will be."
Dean smiled, chuckling as he rubbed his neck, taken back by Cas' sincerity, "Yeah, well... you're welcome."
Castiel knew it was there, whatever the conflict was. Whether Castiel would learn the name of this demon was uncertain. But this didn't stop him from consulting Sam on his demons.
He pushed Cas' hands off, running to the sink and running his cup under freezing water, "At least I used warm water! But you brought in cold water, obviously I brought a knife to a gun fight!"
"So you didn't think it was a big deal that he was missing?" Naomi hissed at her sister, "god you're not at all responsible, are you?"
"Hm," Cas frowned, "what a peculiar creature." Cas' frown deepened as he stared at the puppy, his head tilting further as he stared at the puppy, "Dean, I believe he requires libation."
"Kay, little bro. Much as I'd like to stay up and talk about your model friend, I really do have work tomorrow. G'night, Cassie."
Sam's confusion disappeared and he nodded,leaning against the couch casually, "It's true. We're kicking you out Dean, Cas and I've decided we don't like you anymore."
Cas isn’t sure when movie sessions became theirs. But then again, hasn’t that always been the case with him and Dean? Their routines and soft words, their jokes, and teasing grins, they’re all routines. So why does Castiel look forward to them every day?  He’s spoken with his therapist about Dean and the things they do together, the way Dean’s hand is steady without being overbearing. Yes, routines are good. Castiel laments a time when he only thought of routines as a reassuring structure in the hell hole that has been his life. Because, yes, there is a comfort in routine, but Dean Winchester is so much more than… routine. It’s not that Castiel pushes through this relationship like a cup of coffee after a bad night. No, this routine is… more like a tradition.
It was silent. Dean frowned, why did Cas have to be difficult? Ugh, damn Cas and his need for Dean to love his stupid self. Though if Dean was being honest, Cas’ intense staring did make him a little uncomfortable.
Castiel slid into the front seat, Dean slipping his hand from Cas' before closing the door. His blush only darkened when he saw Jessica, Sam, and Meg looking at him smugly from the backseat. Meg smirked and raised her eyebrows, her gaze never leaving Castiel as Dean slid into his seat and started the car.
The stiff blank expression on Castiel's face softened for a moment and he shook his head, some of the tension seemingly having vanished from him, "Naomi did not pique me, no. Rest assured I was not vexed by my sister, I simply did not sleep well."
"The last time we were together I spoke cruelly to you." His blue eyes shone with sincerity as he placed a hand on Dean's cheek. "I am very sorry Dean."
"Shouldn't they play a harp or some angelic shit? Maybe you could randomly hear a chorus of angels singing or some shit like that. I mean, bells go with church bells I guess- but I feel like that's kind of a random instrument- and it's not even that cool. If getting your wings is so important, how come you just get the jolt of a little bell? I mean, come on, I'd want an electric guitar to start belting out Led Zeppelin or something cool if I got my wings- not the wimpy jingle of a little bell."
"I treat him in no such way, it's simply that someone needs to keep order among everyone," Naomi said calmly.
"The last one," Anna glared, "There is a lot I will allow you to say, but you will not call Castiel bad, he is not. He is good, and I will not hear otherwise from anyone."
She stared at Castiel's blackened eye and partially split lip, before hugging him. Cas flinched slightly (he wished he could stop, but he just couldn't help himself) at the unexpected contact, before hugging her back.
He touched the edge of his headphones, a lifesaver in this horrible sea of waste and sugar and heat.
A tear had run down his cheek as his voice shook, "No, no you do-on't. You don't do anything! You just run around trying to find the same guys we've been looking for- for eleven years and making everything about them! You give them more attention than you ever have me! You drink and obsess and yell but you don't do anything for m-he! Don't tell me you do, cause you do-hon't!"
Cas' lips lifted briefly in that awful forced smile that Dean knew so well, and he nodded. Dean bit his lip, stepping closer to Cas, ignoring Naomi's eye. Apparently she was not naive to the woman's distaste directed towards her.
"How do you even know all those words? I know the way I speak, and I don't have a small vocabulary- but half the words you say don't even sound like they exist. Aurora, I got- but kvetch? Is that German or something? How is that even a word?" Dean asked incredulously.
Gabriel chuckled, saying Castiel was the only six year old boy he knew that would say 'lovely'. Anna punched him. Castiel giggled and covered his mouth, hoping his father hadn't heard. Together the siblings quietly walked down the stairs, Anna holding his hand with a finger to her lips, their father was busy with a seemingly intense conversation with Michael.
Dean exhaled harshly, shaking his head at his brother's questions. Just cause somebody died didn't mean he had to be upset for god's sake! He was fine without Sam pestering him, if his brother was really so concerned for his sake he'd leave him alone.
Jo was interesting; he did have some weird feelings for her, her big brown eyes always drawing him in. Oh god- now it sounded like he was talking about Sam and just… no, Dean shook his head, he and Jo were more of friends anyways.
The group of friends began using their lunch, as often was the case, as a time to complain about their classes. Thankfully, with it being near the end of the year, school was almost over. Bringing graduation for most at the table, and senior year for the others.
"I..." he frowned, tilting his head at her. “I am not sure what I thought. I-I did not think a-anything of him."
Somewhere in the night (probably when they started to fall asleep) Cas had begun to take off his under suit, so all he wore now was his white shirt.
Castiel exhaled, another long, nerve racking, but slightly more compelling day. He’d met someone, which was nice- but at the same time, he’d met someone, which was awful. A potential acquaintance was interesting, since Castiel hadn’t screwed everything up yet and scared Dean off.
Dean frowned as Cas turned the water on next to him and pulled out a small dish sponge and dropping the soap onto it.
"Yeah, yeah, Ackbar," Dean grumbled, raising his eyebrows when he saw Cas grinning with Sam and Jess, saying something that caused the other two to laugh.
"Not that I am not glad to see you, but... why are you here, Dean? I thought you wanted to work on your car," Cas said with a frown.
"Yeah, well I'm through giving a crap about what'll 'bode well for me' I'm not backtracking- you do whatever they want, Cas! But you lie to me all the time! You never tell me anything, but you bend over backwards for them even when it makes you miserable! I get loyalties, but you need to stand on your own two feet, grow a pair, and stand up to them! They call, you come- they jump, you say how high!"
"I... Honestly, I do not wish to have to drive with someone I don't know," Cas said with a sigh, not sure how to make s answer appear any less suspicious than that.
Dean glared as he spoke, "And yet you're on the case a day later, what's so important about it now? Alleged kidnappings not enough for you?"
The only sounds Castiel had made in those days were cries as he hit hands over his ears before shouting incoherently. Eventually Castiel would cry himself to sleep without finding a solution, only to face the same problem the next day. Anna felt horrible when she failed Castiel. What kind of sister was she if she couldn’t help her brother?
to attend a larger school. No, he much preferred a smaller school that resulted in as little interaction and as short a drive as possible. Castiel took a deep breath, revelling in the temporary quiet. His brothers were not yet home, though Lucifer was home as little as possible nowadays. The house was only accompanied by Anna and him.
She worried far too often for Castiel’s sake, and it was kind of her, really it was- but it only made him feel worse when he saw the disheartened look in her eyes as if his unhappiness was somehow her fault. When he went up to his room to be alone, she was worried and thought she had upset him- but he was only trying to keep her from being unhappy with his presence.
"I have no idea if this is your reasoning for being upset, but this is what I perceive to be the reasoning behind your troubles. I am sorry if I have made you uncomfortable by bringing this up, but I- I wanted you to know you're not alone."
Naomi shook her head, walking back to her bed and sitting down clasping her hands she spoke, "You should to stay here. What purpose do you have here? Don't you understand, Anna? Your presence only brings back
His eyes had lit up, and Cas assumed he had never had a pet before- let alone a puppy. Really it had been incredibly sweet to watch but Cas never mentioned this part of Dean, just as he didn't mention his approaching birthday, but his efforts had now been made useless by Sam's current statement.
Apparently Dean liked conversing with his peers as much as Castiel did. Castiel glanced at him cautiously, and when Dean looked up from the plain sketchbook each student had received, he saw Castiel and smiled. Castiel didn’t know how to honestly smile, so he bit his lip and nodded.
"Well, this just kind of... became a lie. I grew so accustomed to never telling anyone what the preacher would do that- that it just... telling someone didn't seem to be much of an option anymore. I- I tried, I tried to tell my uncle but he- he said he knew, he would tell me that I deserved it, that it was-" he sniffed, wiping his nose, "th-th-that it was G-G-God's way of k-keeping me in line."
Dean groaned, "Sam wouldn't stop whining yesterday about some project so I drove him here so he could ask some questions, ugh, I can't believe I'm going to be at school an hour longer than necessary."
"Anna, thank you, I appreciate your offer- but I am capable of paying for this," Castiel said, not wanting to ask for something he knew he could do without burdening his sister.
The press of jeans against Cas' leg seemed to have been warning enough. His blue eyes flickered up to Dean who rubbed the back of his heated neck. Great, he had ruined everything.
"Both, he's been preaching about it's power all morning. It's a black tie covered in ballerinas." She scoffed, "A bunch of women wearing tutus on his tie."
Dean and Cas speak of presents, we learn more of what happened when Castiel went to visit Dean, the tension between Anna and Naomi continues to grow.
One thing Dean often spoke of was being like his father, but Castiel did not want to encourage losing your identity in order to please others- he had seen the results of that, and it was not something he wished to encourage Dean to try, though he probably had already. Dean wanted to be a police officer when he grew up, he wanted to save people as his father did.
Dean jammed his hand down on the seat belt and laid himself against Cas' body, pressing his dark, red lips against the pale pink.
There were stacked shelves of contained fruits, vegetables, sparkly drinks- they were all shining brightly under the store’s harsh lights. Anna promised him they would buy an orange, but he wanted to hold one now. The store was too noisy and he wanted something sweet and bumpy like the skin of an orange- his favorite.
He pulled away, raising a hand as he stared at Castiel. Dean shook his head before the words could leave his mouth.
a problem, tries to sabotage Dean and Castiel’s honesty. Cas sees that fear, knows it is an insecurity he has lived with for far too long and, though he is learning not to blame himself, he can’t help but feel he has wasted too many years letting that nagging voice control him. He never wants to let anyone control him again. Cas wants to be strong like his siblings and like Dean. He wants to smile more and talk about what bothers him, but he also wants to laugh with his boyfriend and play boardgames with his family.
He lowered their hands while Dean stared at him. The grip slowly loosened; Cas’ dress shirt brushed his wrist. His calloused fingers brushed Dean’s a final time, then Dean was alone again.
He frowned, looking over his anatomy syllabus once more. Students were convinced they did not have homework on the first day. On the contrary they were given handouts containing guidelines for the rest of the year. Castiel did not see why Anna would think she could offer help while looking over a syllabus. Then again, he spent so much time on schoolwork perhaps she had forgotten to even bother asking what it was anymore.
He nodded, watching the fluffy creatures shuffle back and forth, bumping their noses against the glass to be near one another.
Castiel looked up at his sister, and he saw the pain in her eyes, he nodded, “Yes, I believe that would be wise and prove beneficial for the both of us.”
"Well, family's are tough, boys. I could tell ya a bunch of stories 'bout my parents but- well, wouldn't change much."
"No, I understand that- what I do not understand is the need everyone feels to jibe me for my speaking mannerisms. Often, after people make their presence known to me, typically by ejaculation, they asperse me directly after because of the way I speak."
Hell Dean still managed to drive over here after this morning’s serving of chaos. Sam and Dad had been at each other’s throats. Dean had practically pulled the two apart after he made breakfast. He’d felt like a pack leader, a mother ripping apart two wolves taking a game too far.
Cas rolled his eyes, "Dean, ejaculation means to voice your opinions quickly- what on earth are you thinking of that makes it so humorous?"
, they're supposed to care about you and treat you like an equal and ask if something's wrong they're supposed to
Charlie smiled, pointing at him, "You did, you liked it! Dean Winchester watched a Disney movie and he loved it! Hell, you just quoted it! Oh, this is it- that's the sign, you liked it."
And that is how the two youngest Novaks ended up playing Twister, sprawled out in the kitchen, dishes forgotten in the sink. Apparently the two siblings had also forgotten they would need someone to spin the game board for them, so Castiel moved it around with him and spun it while playing. He looked rather silly, Anna thought, and it was nice to see him doing something other than praying or homework. Even if he did this with his ever constant serious expression, sometimes Anna thought it was the only expression he had.
Dean's eyes switched to Castiel, "Then when? When is she gonna quit screwing with your head? When is she gonna quit treating you like shit, huh?"
The room's soft, purple curtains moved gently with the approaching summer's breeze. An empty corner was the only thing behind Castiel. He was alone.
The only good thing about this class was Dean, anyways. Was he really going to abandon her here?! In the boredom?! With the boring students?! And the boring teacher?! Alone?! Oh no, Charlie wasn't having it. If she was going to suffer, Dean Winchester had better be suffering beside her!
All because he couldn't be good. He needed to try harder, pray more- do, do something better. Anything, anything to be better. He would be good, not bad. He would be-
Dean had smiled, before biting his lip- maybe Cas wasn't amused, maybe he was annoyed and just didn't want to hurt Dean's feelings. Maybe he was pitying him! Well screw that! Dean Winchester didn't take pity from anybody, not even Cas!
Dean's eyes widened again, "Wow, nice job Will Hunting- and here I thought you made half those names up."
Cas said nothing, and Crowley sighed, "Yes, well, I suppose only one man would know for certain. Shame, I would have liked to see them."
“Babe I have to trust that you will tell me if you need help,” Dean says, and his hands still temporarily before returning to their soft rhythm. “We can’t afford to not trust one another with our burdens anymore. I trust you to tell me if you’re hurting, but I can’t force you, Cas. I need you to believe me when I tell you that you’re not a burden. I have to trust you’ll tell me if you need help, and you have to trust I’ll tell you if it’s too much.”
"So Dean, the 24th is coming up- do you wanna do anything?" Sam asked with a smile, it dropped as quickly as it had come, "Unless you don't wanna do anything- which we don't have to, by the way. I just... I just thought I'd ask."
The voices continued from the kitchen, rising and lowering like water over sand or a messy figure eight. He wanted to tell his family to be quiet but the thought of social interaction was exhausting. Instead, he slipped his freshly cleaned headphones over his ears. He felt his body loosen, relaxing as the material pressed against his skin. He removed the headphones again and again, admiring the change in volume and the press of padding against his body.
Castiel frowned, his brow furrowing, “If you didn't want to be here, why didn't you simply deny Sam's request?"
Father's head had mixed with the beams of joy from the sun. He was the sun. He gave them life and cared not how they lived it.
Cas felt his stomach clench, no, no, no it was okay- he wasn't alone this time. He was older, stronger, this man couldn't hurt him. He shoved at the man, his shaky hands causing he man to stumble slightly before advancing upon Cas once more, leaning his body against Cas.
He smiled speaking fondly, "Dean recognizes dogs for the beautiful creatures they are but also had a bad experience as a child so he is quite cautious around them."
Castiel looked up fearfully, silently nodding with a nervous tremor in his hands. He did not look at Anna, who was seated next to him, despite his wish to do so. Perhaps if he did not direct his attention to his sister, his uncle would not either- for once Castiel hoped Naomi would speak, surely she would receive positive attention from Zachariah.
