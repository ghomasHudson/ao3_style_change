Sherlock looked evenly over at John, face serious for a moment.  “We really are.”  John smiled at that, and leaned back again with his eyes closed, enjoying the warm sun on his skin.
The two watched Rosie drop the sloth unceremoniously to the floor as she made a bid to grab Chopin from Sherlock.  Sherlock made the bear dance a little again, before gently placing him in her hands.  John looked back up to Sherlock’s face and saw him watching John closely; a tentative, enquiring look.  It had been a long time since John had seen Sherlock so vulnerable, and he felt a twinge in his chest.
Sherlock considered this, still running his sun creamy hands over John, moving now to his collarbone, and sweeping his hands down John’s chest.  “Is that what you want?”
Hours later, Sherlock stood up again.  He strode into the kitchen, hitting the kettle’s switch on for tea before realising there wasn’t enough water in it.  With a melodramatic sigh – really, why did these things always happen to him – Sherlock lifted up the kettle and pressed the button for its lid to fly up, as he turned around to fill it at the sink.   As the water rushed in from the tap, he made a decision.  He shut off the tap and snapped the kettle’s lid closed, shoving it haphazardly back into its mount, and hitting the switch again to get it to boil.
“OK then Sherlock – let’s get you strapped in, then.  Come back here… yes, that’s right.  Let go of her hand…”  Rosie gave a yell at this – clearly she didn’t approve.  With practiced hands, John pressed Rosie lightly to his chest as he unclipped the straps around his waist and lifted the carrier up and over his head as he lowered Rosie to the ground.
They each moved at the same time, with John pulling his legs up from under the covers just as Sherlock said, “Can I sit?” and gestured at the bed.  When John nodded and drew his knees up to sit cross-legged, with his back upright against the headboard, Sherlock moved to sit down on the opposite side of the bed, facing John.  While he sort of expected John to begin, he realised John had really said his piece, and it was probably Sherlock’s turn to speak up.
John looked around the play corner again, taking everything in this time.  He could see the care that had gone into every choice.  His heart warmed as he realised he could see hints of Sherlock in every item – the subjects he cared about, the lessons he wanted to teach Rosie, the world he wanted to open up for her.  John didn’t think Sherlock knew anything at all about babies, and yet… this was perfect.  It must have taken Sherlock weeks to find these things, and to arrange them so thoughtfully.
Sherlock looked nervous at mention of “breaking”, and John rolled his eyes.  “Honestly, Sherlock.  You’ll be fine.  I was just going to hand her to you, but if you’d prefer I can strap her into the carrier on you instead, then you’ll know she’s safe and you can’t drop her.”
“Yep,” said Tim cheerfully.  “My uncle sometimes takes me.  We go on the train from Guildford and spend Sundays sometimes.”
Sherlock just nodded.  He lifted the swim shorts up and did a quick check of what else John had packed for him.  Shirts, trousers, sun cream, Sherlock’s favourite cap, toothbrush, toothpaste, pants.  Pants!  Sherlock shivered at the thought of John in his drawers.  It felt oddly intimate, but… in a nice way.  Lestrade smirked when he saw what Sherlock was looking at.
John was making his way down the stairs from his room with a few bumps and some muffled swear words.  Sherlock, laying on his back on the sofa with his hands steepled and eyes on the ceiling, deduced that John was struggling with something heavy.  He was making slower progress than usual, and yet not so slow as to indicate moving furniture.  Something under 15kg, then.  And an awkward shape, or John wouldn’t be bumping the walls.  He squinted a little as he considered what it might be.  John wouldn’t have that amount of rubbish in his room, and wasn’t really the Salvation Army-donation sort.  If anything, he was the wearer of those clothes, not the giver.  Sherlock snorted to himself at the appalled look any of the homeless might sport, receiving John’s knobbly jumpers as an act of charity.
Sherlock didn’t acknowledge the question, seeming not to hear it.  John gave their joined hands a bit of a jiggle to get his attention.  Sherlock blinked and looked over at John.
“Alright, let’s go out then.  I’d like to sit on the restaurant balcony and consider a different view, and you can deduce all the other hotel guests while I try to convince you to eat a waffle.”
Sherlock ducked back into the bathroom to spit as John exited, smelling minty too.  Sherlock grinned at John – they often did this at home, and it was calming to bring their Baker Street routine into the holiday.  Sherlock stared at himself in the mirror as he put his toothbrush next to John’s in the glass.  He smoothed his hair down a bit – he was amused at the volume the humidity was giving him – and made dramatic eyes at himself as he considered the significant moment ahead.
John smiled to himself as he wriggled down into the bed, matching his posture to Sherlock’s.  He’d been worried about moving too fast, making sure he wasn’t pushing Sherlock, making sure that Sherlock could take his own time for everything, and yet here Sherlock was, within an hour of arriving, disappointed at the very idea of his own bed.  “Ok if I turn the light off?”
“Valletta City Gate, please.”  Sherlock instructed the cab driver.  On the 15 minute ride between St Julian’s and the city, Sherlock peppered John with fun facts about Valletta’s history.  John let it all wash over him, content that they were together and he’d soon have a coffee in hand.
Ten minutes later, a clean and pyjama-ed Sherlock appeared at the end of John’s bed, looking expectant.  John had tucked himself back into the position he’d been in when Sherlock arrived.  “So…”
Feeling the need to tell Sherlock how much this all meant to him, he looked back.  Sherlock was still gazing at John, and John flushed at the scrutiny.
seats on the plane, and intended to give Mycroft a piece of his mind as soon as they got home.  John had just snorted, rolling his eyes and leaving them to it.  In his book, Mycroft was a bit creepy but broadly a good bloke.
Sherlock looked intensely relieved at this, and said immediately, “Yes, please.  I can work up to holding her, but for now a safety harness feels like our best bet.”
John snorted.  For a brilliant man who never hesitated to call others ‘idiots’ it was quite pleasing to see him so captivated by such a simple thing.  He filed it away to tell Lestrade – he’d enjoy that too.
Sherlock nodded, aware that he was himself rather flustered and also needed a minute.  He turned for the bathroom and washed his hands carefully, noting with mild annoyance how hard it was to get the sun cream off with soap and water.  He dried his hands intensely with a flannel, using it to scrape the last of the sun cream off his hands.  When he came back out, John was standing exactly where he’d left him, eyes closed, and a big smile on his face.  He must have sensed Sherlock’s return, as he opened his eyes when Sherlock came to stand before him again, and they crinkled in that way that made Sherlock’s chest clench.
Sherlock looked expectantly at John, clearly requiring his verbal agreement.  John chuckled at how serious Sherlock was.  Sherlock doubled down on his ‘damn well listen to me’ face. “I’m serious, John.  I’m a grown man, and I think you know me well enough to know that I won’t do anything I’m not comfortable with.  So what I’d really like is for you to trust me enough to tell me what it is that you want.  And then I can be the one to decide how I want to respond.  Otherwise I’m afraid these moments will all pass me by, and frankly we might not get anywhere.”
Sherlock squeezed John’s hand reassuringly. “No, I knew that.  I didn’t really show him.  I did read one of the answers out to him, and I showed him briefly to prove that you’d told me where you were.  He didn’t believe me.”
important to experience, or to have, or to do.  Honestly, that’s what prompted me telling you how I feel in the first place.  And I know we’re having some of these conversations out of order, but when have we ever done anything like other people?”
“Grazie molto!”  Sherlock said cheerfully, before launching into a flood of Italian that John couldn’t follow.  The girl and her family giggled, listening to Sherlock and sneaking glances at John, before giving cheerful waves and continuing back towards the hotel.
“No, you don’t.  You like Molly and Lestrade well enough, but not well enough to spend a week with them full time.  The conversation would be awkward.  And inviting Molly might make her think you were interested in her romantically, which you would never encourage.  Also Lestrade has already taken a holiday this summer and he’s not the sort to take two holidays within a few months’ time.  Much more likely to take a single, longer holiday, and maximise his time away from work.  Too hard to hand over his cases twice within a few months.  So that means you’re going alone.  But the question is, why?  You’ve never taken a holiday in the entire time I’ve known you.  I’m not even sure you’ve taken a long weekend somewhere.  Even on Bank Holidays, we stay here and explore London while everyone else racks off to wherever they’re going.”
“John.”  John was flat on his back in bed, just about to fall over the precipice into sleep, when Sherlock’s soft voice cut into the darkness later that night.
Two hours later, as the plane sat on the tarmac waiting for take-off, Sherlock breathed out slowly.  Really happening, then.  He looked down again at the FAQ, reading it from top to bottom once more.  He’d essentially memorised it at this point, but having the physical paper in his hand made this all feel real somehow.   Breathing a sigh of relief, he reached for his phone and sent the same text to two numbers.
“Yeah, I know.  It’s incredible.  Also these chairs are surprisingly comfortable.  I think we’ll enjoy this balcony a lot.”
They both looked at a snoozy Rosie, now in a terry towel onesie, and smiled.  John laid her carefully down on her back in the middle of Sherlock’s fortress.  She snuffled a little, slipping her thumb into her mouth.  Sherlock watched John watching Rosie, feeling his chest stretch with the emotions of the day.  The tenderness on John’s face, his soft touch on her skin, the way he carefully smoothed down the bedspread below her, all spoke of a love Sherlock had never seen before.  John had changed.  John was a father, really a father.
“I’m serious, John, don’t worry.  If I wanted to cause myself irreparable harm, there are more fun ways to achieve it than hurtling off those rocks.”
“And so, to the matter at hand…” Lestrade started, gesturing at John’s empty chair, and catching Sherlock’s eye.  “Shall we sit?”
Sherlock slowly pulled back, releasing the hug but still lightly touching John’s side as he examined his face.  John looked back at him steadily, knowing that Sherlock was reading him.  Checking what had changed.  Sherlock’s scan revealed almost exactly what he expected – John looked sad around the eyes, face rather slack with the months of stress, and definitely older, with his now silver hair in really a very nice cut.  Longer on the top, Sherlock thought admiringly, and smiled.
There was a pause, just for a moment, then Sherlock lunged at John, overwhelmed by the need to be physically near him, to touch him, to be enveloped by him.  John looked startled for a moment, then pleased as Sherlock came at him from the side, folding himself around the left side of John’s body, with his right arm thrown across John’s back, and his face wedged tightly in the gap between John’s neck and his right shoulder.  Sherlock’s left arm softly cradled Rosie in her carrier.  Sherlock clung to John, tense and breathing deeply, and John thought carefully before slowly lifting his left arm to hug Sherlock back.
“Indeed, though to be fair to her, her parents just found out that she’s sexually active and it’s been a rough day.”
Sherlock mused on this for a moment, then nodded decisively.  “I think I’d like that.  But first, I want to tell you something.”  Sherlock leant forward and made serious eyes at John, frowning a little.  It was what John privately thought of as Sherlock’s ‘Will you damn well listen to me’ face.  “I want you to tell me exactly what you’re thinking this week, John.  I think what we learned today is that I can’t read you as well as I thought I could, and if we want to make this work, then I’m going to need you to spell things out for me, at least until I get the hang of things.”
“Oh, that.  Yes.  I’m trying out pet names for you.  I feel like I should have something more affectionate than ‘John’ up my sleeve, now that we’re… you know.”
When John woke up in the morning, it was to a still-dark room, with blinding lines of light around the edges of the curtains.  He gave a little wiggle, enjoying the feeling of Sherlock’s chest pressed against his back, and then reached behind him to find Sherlock’s arm, pulling it comfortingly around himself, and weaving their fingers together over his bare chest.
“But why, is the question.  I wouldn’t begrudge you a holiday.  You know that.  You haven’t taken one since you got back from Afghanistan, and I’ll bet it was a long time before then that you actually relaxed.  And I myself like holidays, so you could just have invited me if you didn’t want to go alone.  But you didn’t. Hmmm.”
Seeing Sherlock start to spiral, John stood up quickly, striding across the room to where Sherlock stood by the closet.  Sherlock stopped talking, surprised by the movement.  John looked up into his face, read the worry and the planning and the overwhelming desire to please John and make it all better, and put his hand lightly on Sherlock’s cheek, thumb stroking gently across Sherlock’s cheekbone.
John was unconcerned that Sherlock had already told him this.  If Sherlock wanted to pepper him with facts before he’d had breakfast, that was Sherlock’s prerogative.  He knew John was useless until he’d had a good sit, some tasty carbs, and nursed a coffee.  “Huh, that’s cool.”
John doesn’t send others to fight his battles.  John is brave and noble and full of morals.  He wouldn’t send Molly out to end it unless it were really over.  Unless battling Sherlock, screaming at Sherlock, venting at Sherlock, just wasn’t worth it any more.  Unless John were in too much pain to even foist it on Sherlock.  Unless John had given up.
“Will you tell me what you’re thinking about?  You don’t have to.  You just look like you’re a million miles away.”
“No, honestly... I was pleasantly, deliciously,” here he pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s temple, “surprised that we went as far as we did.  I wasn’t expecting anything to happen this week… I wasn’t sure if you’d want that at all, even if you were open to a romantic relationship.  So I considered everything that we did do together a real gift.”  He paused, not wanting to avoid what he felt Sherlock was really getting at.  “That being said… I think what you’re really asking me is if I
“No, I know.  I don’t feel pressured by what you said.  And I don’t think you necessarily mean any time soon… I get that you just meant it was on your mind.  I had personally stopped thinking about it, but that doesn’t mean I’m averse to the idea, it would just… you know… reframe things a bit.  All I’m saying is that if it’s really something that’s important to you, and it sounds like it is, then it merits further discussion.  We only get one life, Sherlock, and we owe it to ourselves to do everything we can to secure those things that feel
Taking the suitcase back off Lestrade, Sherlock dumped it unceremoniously on the bed, and reached around the back to find the zip.  As he pulled it neatly around, and tipped the suitcase’s back, he gave a small gasp.  There, on top, were his favourite swim shorts.  And resting lightly on top of them was a note, in John’s handwriting.
“Excuse me!”  Sherlock called out, launching towards the main route most people were using to cross the rocks.  He switched to his politest ‘Let me flirt my way into getting what I want from a passerby’ voice, as he intersected with an older family drifting past, heading back to the hotel. “Would you mind taking a photo of me and my boyfriend?”
John laughed, picturing two small boys cowering on the edge of some English garden pool, which would likely have been genuinely freezing even in the height of summer.  “Did you guys have a pool at home?”
Sherlock grinned.  “Well, I’m glad you don’t do that.  And I’m sorry for saying you harangue me.  It’s more of a low-level pestering…”
John gave a shy smile, enjoying that Sherlock had clearly thought about this.  Sherlock’s face clouded a little and when he spoke next, his tone was serious.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Come on, John.  We haven’t got all day.  Pick one, and you can choose the other tomorrow if it doesn’t take your fancy.”
“Um.. I don’t really know what to say to that.  But, you know there’s nothing you can’t tell me, and I don’t put that much stock in social rules.”
Lestrade looked back at Sherlock, surprised.  He’d been steeling himself for terrible questions, words he never wanted to hear out of Sherlock’s mouth.  Instead, Sherlock was getting to his feet decisively, and striding down the hall into his bedroom.  Startled, Lestrade stood up too, and followed him.
One sunny Thursday afternoon around 3pm, Sherlock was curled up sideways in his chair when he heard a tread on the stairs.  A familiar tread – an authoritative one; one that said “I’m home”.  Though he’d previously been staring into space thinking about a case, he screwed his eyes shut as his heart leapt in his chest.  Could it be?
Alessia laughed and said, “That is not what I said… I said the shade is more pleasant for the English, generally.”
“Sherlock, you’re my whole world, you know that?  Even at my absolute lowest, I missed you even as I railed against you.  I.. I told Molly at one point how I was feeling, and you know what she said?”  Sherlock gave a minute shake of the head.  “She’s so wise.  She said, ‘You know why it feels like this, don’t you?  It’s because this is the second time in 5 years that you’ve been widowed.  First Sherlock, now Mary.  Your heart just can’t take it again.’”
Sherlock deliberated.  He really preferred to work things out for himself, and yet John was rocking back and forth on the balls of his feet, eager to share with Sherlock.
“I’m glad you like it,” Sherlock whispered in John’s ear.  John shuddered and leaned back into Sherlock’s hands.  Sherlock dropped a second, less tentative kiss on the side of John’s neck and ran his hands back up John’s sides and down the back of his arms in a sweeping movement.  John’s skin felt amazing under his hands, and Sherlock enjoyed the goose bumps that rose in the path his hands had taken.  As John sighed with pleasure, Sherlock felt relieved.  He snuck a look over John’s shoulder and straight down, hoping to see that this was affecting John just as much as it was affecting Sherlock.  He groaned softly when he saw it was.  He stepped forward so his front touched John’s back, dropped his forehead to rest on the crook between John’s neck and shoulder, and thrust forward a little so John could feel just how much Sherlock was enjoying this.
Sherlock looked startled at this, and John rushed on. “Not… not that that’s important.  You might never want that… and that would be ok with me.  But… I realised a while ago that I couldn’t keep this to myself.  I don’t want to do anything to change our relationship… to change us… but not telling you is killing me.  Every time you did something remarkable… solved a case, cooked an incredible meal, just looked at me in that way you have, I was scared it would burst out and I’d freak you out.  Imagine if I told you I loved you in the lab at Bart’s, in front of Molly.  Or forgot myself and took your hand at Angelo’s. Or…”  John drifted off, shuddering as he thought of the many and varied ways his feelings for Sherlock might have spilled out.
“Anyway, this isn’t about me.  Tell me what you’re thinking.  Do you think maybe you feel the same way as John?”
Sherlock reached an arm down to pull John up, pleased he understood.  Pulling him close, he kissed him again and reached a hand down between them to cup John through his shorts.
John’s heart swelled in his chest, tears pricked his eyes, and he felt overcome by love for this wonderful man.  He wasn’t sure if Sherlock would want him kissing him in public, particularly given this was so new, but he couldn’t let the moment pass.
Back in the lobby, John had planned to ask the concierge what the breakfast options were, but as he slowed near the desk, Sherlock kept right on marching.  “This way, John!”
John shook himself.  No point embarrassing himself further.  He stood, and pulled the paper out from his document wallet, and handed it to Sherlock, who took it silently.
“I… I don’t think I’ve ever… ever been loved like this before.  I don’t think anyone has wanted to show how much they care before…”  John stopped and took a deep breath.  “Even Mary… wouldn’t have done this.  She wouldn’t have known…” John stopped and gestured around the room. “She wouldn’t have known what I wanted it to look like.  She wouldn’t have spent months thinking about how to make us a home, how to make me happy… like you did.”
“Enough reading.  It’s time to pack.  Also I’ll need a flight, as you say.  I assume there are more flights to Malta tonight.  Otherwise I’ll have to wait until tomorrow, which isn’t ideal.”
“Hurrah!  Let’s go ring this up, then.  And you can face the other way while this nice young man scans my labels, so you don’t judge me for how much
“Sherlock, you know I didn’t really need you to change… I know I said some awful things.  When I was angry about Mary, it wasn’t really about you.  I mean… it was about you in that you were there, and she was dead, and my world fell apart, AGAIN.”
John chuckled to himself, idly noting that with the time difference, Lestrade was up particularly early.  He debated what to respond, typing and re-typing his answer.
“Well, come in then,” said Sherlock, gesturing to the room behind them.  Neither of them had really moved past the threshold – John was inside, but only just.  He laughed a little as he realised he now merited an invitation to step into the main room of the flat that had been his for so long.  He looked around, surprised to notice that a lot had changed.
Sherlock nodded once, eyes scanning John’s face to check that John was telling the truth.  Aware of this scrutiny, John focussed on schooling his face, ensuring everything Sherlock could read about him was consistent with his words.  After a moment, Sherlock looked away, satisfied.
Sherlock closes his eyes and leans back in his chair, musing on what to do.  He could run after John, ask him to stay, ask him to talk.  But what would Sherlock say?  What could he say?  Sherlock has no idea what just happened.  He didn’t see this coming at all – any of it.  The suitcase, the holiday, the declaration of love.  From John!  His John!  Who had never indicated he had any of these feelings.  Who hadn’t been acting oddly at all these last few months.
When Sherlock finally made it chest deep into the water, they had quite a nice time moving steadily up and down the length of the pool, half-swimming, half-walking, and chatting easily the whole time.  John enjoyed learning more about Sherlock’s childhood and teen years.  Somehow it was easier to talk about these things when they were a long way from Baker Street.
Sherlock sniffed a bit, feeling silly for his reaction, then took the note from Lestrade.  “He knows me.  Maybe better than I know myself.”
Sherlock clearly picked up on John’s thoughts, and rolled his own eyes.  “Not like that, you idiot.  Just, you know, John-and-Sherlock again.  Watson-and-Holmes on the case.  All that.  I miss that.”
“I mean, there’s a fully qualified captain on board and I will have zero responsibility for keeping us alive and the boat upright.”
“I’m so sorry, mister,” a small voice came from behind John, with startling sincerity.  John turned to see a skinny kid with pale skin and medium brown hair standing in the slightly shallower water, looking mortified.  His shoulders were hunched in and he was clearly preparing for John to tell him off.  A worn rugby ball was tucked in the crook of one elbow, and John immediately identified what had caused the ungainly end to his floating.
“You’ll be fine, Sherlock.  She’s just a baby.  Plus now she’s big enough that you won’t break her.”
Sherlock read sympathy and genuine concern on Lestrade’s face, and wondered about it.  Did Lestrade think Sherlock was a bit pathetic, needing a buddy to discuss his feelings?  From what Lestrade said before, it wasn’t news at all to him that John was in love with Sherlock.  Maybe best to start there, then.
Lestrade’s eyebrows shot up and he sat back in his chair to absorb John’s words.  Quite a sentiment.  He huffed out a breath and looked back at Sherlock, “Wow, mate.  That’s really something.”
“Yes!” Sherlock tucked his book into their bag, and sprung up nimbly, as if in an advanced yoga move or some sort of lithe burpee.  He reached over to pull John up, enjoying the warmth of his hands and the ease of his smile.  As he stood, movement caught his eye.
John chuckled.  “That I do.  Ok… how about this.  I’ll do my best to tell you what I’m thinking, and I promise to try and tell you if you ask me.  But I have two conditions.” Sherlock frowned lightly at this, but then caught John's eye and gestured for him to continue.  “First, I reserve the right not to tell you if I’m genuinely worried that I’ll jeopardise this completely.  But I promise I’ll employ a pretty high bar for that, and I won’t use it as a crutch.”  Sherlock nodded at this.  “And second, I want you to try and do the same thing.  I know yours will probably be quite different, but I’d also like you to be honest with me if I ask you.  And you get the benefit of the first condition too, of course.”  John raised his eyebrows in question to Sherlock.  “Deal?”
John laughed, “Yes, of course.  Just a question of whether you want a little cuddle or you want her to see what you’re seeing.  She won’t mind either way – she clearly adores you.”
Sherlock still seemed to be sleeping, peaceful on his left side, dark curls in high contrast against the white sheets, with his right arm thrown across the bed as though reaching for John to come back.  John smiled fondly, knowing he’d never forget this moment, or tire of watching Sherlock as he slept.  He ran his eye down Sherlock’s beautiful face, those striking cheekbones and strong jaw, down his collarbone to his shoulder and lightly muscled arm, and ending with his hands, those remarkable fingers.  He really was perfect, John thought.
Absorbing Molly’s words, Sherlock is too devastated to be angry.  What more could he have done to save Mary?  To protect John?  From the day he interrupted John’s proposal until the night Mary died, he’d done nothing, nothing except support them.  Love them.  Try to prove to John that Sherlock was worthy of his friendship, his protection, his love.
John gave Sherlock a light swat, but chuckled.  There was the Sherlock Holmes confidence, back again.
“Oh, no reason.  I am just struggling a bit with this conversation and I’m a bit afraid of what John’s written answer might be.  Ignore me.  I’ll just sit over here quietly dying of embarrassment while you read it.”
your experimentation list.  I think you’d be fascinated by what you find out.”  John knew Sherlock would be itching to get started – he should have known this would be too tantalising.  “And no, you’re not getting out of bed to find your laptop.  You’re staying right here with me.”
Sherlock’s eyes crinkled beautifully as a grin split his face.  John’s heart gave a lurch.  “Splendid, John!  Heave ho, and all that.”  After an appraising glance at John’s body once more, seeming to assess the physics of what was to happen next, Sherlock stuck one arm behind John’s knees and one behind his back and tipped John sideways with an ungainly “oof!”.  Even with the warning, John was surprised to be on his back, aloft in Sherlock’s arms.  As Sherlock took a few unsteady steps up and through the front door, John felt pure joy, surprised that this did in fact feel fun and romantic, if a bit precarious.  He laughed aloud and threw his arms around Sherlock’s neck, sure that this would round out the image Sherlock had in his head.  He turned his head into Sherlock’s chest and whispered: “You’re my favourite person in the world, you know that?”
“When I think about my life, John is there.  Any future I see for myself – whether it’s here at home, or working, or travelling, or Christmas with my parents – John is right by my side.  Anything less than that would be devastating.”
“Good then – also, you can probably see, but I’m already in my swim shorts.  You do you, obviously, but no need for real clothing unless you want to.  I figured we’d just hang around the hotel today.”
Moments later, John indeed appeared, with a small suitcase behind him.  Not a nice one – those wheelie ones now were so clever, with four spinning wheels and lightweight materials – but some relic from *Sherlock squinted at it* maybe the early 1990s?  When John was in university?  His eyes lifted from the suitcase to John, taking in his rumpled linen shirt (a gift from Sherlock-via-Mycroft a few Christmases ago) and casual trousers, and… were they boat shoes? What was going on?  He’d known John for years, and he didn’t even know John owned boat shoes.  His eyes continued scanning, noting a document wallet in John’s left hand, a piece of paper haphazardly folded in it and enough weight to the wallet that there was clearly a passport inside.  International travel, then?  But not a very big suitcase, so he couldn’t be going too far or for too long.  John wasn’t a particularly efficient person, so he was unlikely to pack multiple weeks’ worth of clothing into a bag that small.  So one week, then.  Somewhere with water, based on the boat shoes, and warmer than London, based on the shirt.  Sherlock squinted again, and turned to look out the window at the steady London rain.  Not heavy, but rather a drag given it was August.
Sherlock didn’t move an inch at first.  It felt like kissing a statue.  John chuckled a little against Sherlock’s mouth.  “You can kiss me back, you know?”
to John that Sherlock would want children.  When John thought of their lives together, with or without a romantic component, children hadn’t factored in at all.  John shook himself a little and felt guilty at that; in some ways John had fed right into what Sherlock already thought about himself.  He determined to do better to be more understanding.  Sherlock wouldn’t have said it unless he truly felt it – he wasn’t a sharer at the best of times – and he’d clearly been aware this may not receive a welcome reaction even before he’d volunteered it.
John’s expression lifted at this – almost a compliment, coming from Sherlock.  He started again, “No, I meant, this is about me having met someone but it’s not new and I suspect it’s not what you think.  And I do know.  Quite concretely.  That’s what I wanted to talk to you about.”
John bit his tongue, immediately sorry both that he’d sworn, and that his tone had been so angry.  He wasn’t good at guessing kids’ ages, but this boy looked like he was still in primary school.  John squinted… maybe 8? 10?  Either way, too young to be sworn at by a man in his 40s.
With that thought, and a few slow rubs on John’s back, Sherlock found himself drifting off to sleep.
“So, you’re going on a holiday.  One week or less.  Somewhere warmer than here.  Can’t be more than a few hours away as you clearly plan to arrive at your destination today wearing that outfit.  You have your passport, so it’s not in the UK.  You’re flying, not taking the train, or you would just have relied on your e-ticket on your phone.  Silly, because most airlines are fine with an e-ticket now too, but you’re conservative that way.  It’s August, and you’re pretty poor, so it’ll have to be somewhere the budget airlines have a direct flight.  You haven’t told me about it… not sure why yet, but I’m sure you will in a minute.  Though actually now I think about it maybe you’re clutching a paper ticket because you know I read your emails, and you wanted to keep this a secret.  You’re going alone, because I’m not going and you would never risk a holiday with Harry.”
With that, John rolled over to give Sherlock an extremely dirty kiss, then rolled right back over the other way, to curl against Sherlock so his back was flush against Sherlock’s front.  He pulled Sherlock’s arm around himself, kissed Sherlock’s fingers, and snuggled into his pillow.  “I love you, brilliant man.”
“Is that… new wallpaper?” he said, as he looked around the fireplace, the bookshelves and the chairs, sweeping back around to take in the familiar windows.  He sniffed the air.  “It smells different in here, too.  Almost… fresh?”  Sherlock just smiled enigmatically, watching as John did a slow spin.
“Oh, Sherlock.”  He spoke softly, “Of course not.  This week was everything to me – not one second of it was a disappointment.”
Having nothing to offer in response to this, Lestrade shrugged and continued to watch Sherlock’s jerky movements.
Sherlock smiled and said conspiratorially to Rosie, “Of course you do, you clever wee thing.  Who would look inwards when the world awaits?”
. I’ll show you frisky.”  With this, Sherlock launched forward off his chair, pouncing on John and intending to snog him senseless.  With arms propped straight on the wicker chair’s arms, Sherlock bent down to kiss John wetly, deeply, working out how to get his knees on either side of John’s thighs.
“Well, the feeling’s mutual then, Miss Rosie.  What do you say you face out, then?  You can see the world! Lots of time for cuddles later, I should think.”  And with this, he shot John a hopeful look, and John nodded back.  “Lots of time for that.  I think she really does prefer looking out – she likes to point things out and chat away at birds and buses and things.”
“Come here.  No crying.” Sherlock pulled John close to him this time, putting his hands on either side of John’s face and kissing his cheeks gently, tasting salt as John’s tears fell.  “Oh you duffer, John.  No more tears.  Of course I love you.  On some level I’ve always loved you… I just needed you to kickstart this chapter of “us”.  And you did… you did such a wonderful job.”
“Not really,” John said frankly, and Sherlock looked back at him quickly, concerned.  “Oh no, don’t worry – I don’t mean I had a bad day, exactly.  The hotel is great and I had a lovely walk around all the pools.  There are loads to choose from!  And I had a nice walk down to the little village next door, St Julian.  Had dinner down there, sitting and looking out at the bay.  Very pleasant.  Just… I didn’t know where I stood with you, and I spent a lot of the day worrying about that.  Worrying I’d messed us up.”
John gave a shiver, closing his eyes for a moment at the tone of Sherlock’s voice.  It felt all too much, and yet just enough, at the same time.  He stood still and let it wash over him.
“What would I know?” said Sherlock with a one shouldered shrug, but then gestured again at the walls. “I wanted them to be fresh and clean, but I also didn’t want the room to change too much.  This was the compromise.”
“Pip-pip, indeed,” said John to himself, shaking his head as he followed Sherlock out and pulling the door closed.
“And you know what – with the sex stuff – we’ll work that out too.  Dare I say, you might enjoy doing some research, and we could experiment a bit!”
John took this seriously, aware of the faith Sherlock was placing in him, and determined to respond appropriately no matter what it was.  He wanted to stop moving while Sherlock said his piece, and slowed as he looked around for somewhere to pause.  “Let’s sit over there?”  he said, and pointed at a stone bench looking out over some yachts, moored in a small bay in front of an expensive looking apartment complex.  Sherlock nodded.
“Well then, good on me, I suppose.”  Sherlock gave an unexpectedly heavy sigh and looked rather resigned.  “Will you tell me why you kept it a secret, then?  I can’t deduce that.”
“Yes, you are.  You don’t need to lie to me, you know.  Just spit it out, and then we’ll both know whatever it is.”
He looked back, “Goodbye, then.  I’ll be back next Saturday.  And… if you want me to move out then, I will.”
“No, Sherlock, hear me out.  I know we have lots left to discuss, and I certainly had no plans to move back to Baker Street, but this is… this is incredible.  This is by far and away the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me.  In my whole life.”  John’s voice broke a little as he looked around the room, and then back to Sherlock’s eyes.
He pulled out a navy-blue t-shirt with a single pocket, enjoying the way the fabric felt against his skin.  For the first time in a long time, he considered not only how he would look in it, but whether Sherlock would like it on him.  It wasn’t a thought he had allowed himself to indulge in recently, what with the strong intention to suppress his feelings in the last few months, but now he considered this deeply relevant to his choices.  Meandering along the row, he saw a clutch of the same sunshine yellow shorts from the window and rifled through them until he found his size.  Normally he wouldn’t go for a yellow – he was firmly in the blues / greens / greys spectrum – but with his nascent tan starting to emerge, he thought he might be able to pull it off.  Plus, perhaps ridiculously, the colour matched the bubbly feeling that had consumed his chest these last few days – it was the colour of happiness and Sherlock, intertwined.
Sherlock pressed his lips together and looked like he might cry.  Lestrade put his hand on Sherlock’s back, noting that he was quite overcome with emotion, and reached around to pick up the note.
“Sherlock, I’m not saying this to start anything.  I just need you to understand what this has been like for me.  Why I maybe went off the deep end a bit.  Molly was right.  This was the second time in just a few years I was grieving the loss of the most important person in my life.  And sure, you weren’t my spouse and we weren’t, you know, doing anything together.  But you were undoubtedly the most important person in my life and then suddenly you were gone.  And I lost everything that day you jumped.  My best friend, my home, my job.  I know I could have stayed here, know I could have kept working with Lestrade, but that wasn’t what I wanted.  I wanted you.”
“Look, I don’t want to spoil your fun if you want to keep going, but as it happens I do have a plane to catch, so we are somewhat on the clock.”
“No, really Sherlock, you’re fully clothed and we’re both on top of the covers.  How about you get into your pyjamas, at least?”
Sherlock smiled and, taking one of Rosie’s little legs in each hand, gave them a jiggle.  John’s heart skipped a beat as he watched this funny little dance.  Rosie giggled as she kicked and Sherlock said cheerfully, “Off we go then!” and marched down the hall.  John smiled and drifted after them.
Sherlock would have laughed at John using the word ‘cuddle’, but he found that that was exactly what he wanted to happen, and he didn’t think laughing was going to get him there.  He rolled onto his back, centring his head precisely on his pillow, and reached his arm out for John, who he found was already on his way.  John settled in along Sherlock’s side, resting his head in the dip between Sherlock’s shoulder and chest, and lightly resting his arm over Sherlock’s torso.  Their legs tangled together lightly.  “Close but not too close,” Sherlock thought with a smile.  “Trust John to know exactly what I’d like.”
“Well, you know, judging by your reaction this isn’t welcome news at all, so I just wanted to let you know that I don’t have to stay.  I know that would be uncomfortable.  Obviously my preference is for things just to stay as they are if you don’t feel the same way, but I don’t want to force that on you.  I want it to be your choice.  You found the flat, after all.”
He gave it another few moments, just to be sure he was ok, and then stood up to join Sherlock.  He tucked his phone carefully under his towel so it wouldn’t be visible, and deliberated taking his sunglasses with him.  With considerably less grace than Sherlock had shown, John meandered up to the pool.
“Sherlock, it’s not what you think.  It’s not… a woman.  It’s not, you know, the usual….”  John took a deep breath and steeled himself.  No point having done all this preparation, hidden his holiday for months, just to lose his nerve at the pivotal moment.  He pushed on, “It’s you, Sherlock.  It’s always been you.  I – I just took a while to realise it, that’s all.”
Sherlock laughed at the thought.  “Well, that’s ridiculous.  But I am glad that you’re on board with the sailing idea.”
Sherlock looked up at John at these words, earnestness flooding his expression.  “John... I care.  Of course I care.”
John chuckled a little at this – no matter how unlikely it was to eventuate, mistakenly dropping his daughter didn’t really compare to having his wife shot before his eyes, but he could see how for Sherlock they were so closely connected.
Sherlock grinned down at John.  “I knew you’d come around.  We’ll have you in Armani before you know it.”
“I’m sure she’s got it, Sherlock.  We’re the only two people out here and I don’t think it was that complex.”
By the time John reappeared in Sherlock’s room, Sherlock had built an intense obstacle course of towels, pillows, and what looked like a few philosophy text books.
They both breathed out with relief, settling in.  Sherlock dropped his head, tucking it into the crook between John’s neck and collarbone, and John rested his head against Sherlock’s shoulder.  Sherlock breathed, “Mmmm,” contentedly, and tightened his grip on John.   This was perfect.
“You’re amazing,” smiled Sherlock.  “Now, how about we get this dinner on before we get too distracted?”  Sherlock gave John one last, chaste kiss, and turned around to the fridge, pulling out minced beef and some fresh pasta, and dumping them on the counter before reaching into the pantry for onions, carrots, garlic, tomato paste and olive oil.
Sherlock sat with this information for a second, marvelling that both John knew him so well.  Knew that he’d text Lestrade and not Molly or Mycroft, or head downstairs to find Mrs Hudson.  He filed that information away to examine more closely later.
Skin-to-skin, Sherlock ran his hands down John’s sides and around to cup John’s bum.  He hadn’t done this before and it still felt like he was invading John’s space.  John’s groan and accompanying clenching quickly put his mind at ease, and he edged his hands under his waistband and gave a squeeze.  John responded by mouthing wet kisses along Sherlock’s collarbone and rubbing his wrist against the hardening outline in Sherlock’s own shorts.
Back in the hotel room, the air conditioning was a bit of a shock after the balmy air outside.  Sherlock shivered as they entered then he headed straight for the bathroom as John paused to turn the air conditioning down.   Sherlock came out again with his toothbrush in his mouth, and gestured that John should head in if he wanted to.  He strode off to the end of the room, and slid the balcony door open to warm the room up a bit, pulling the gauzy curtain across for a bit of privacy.
“So, did you have a nice day?” Sherlock said after a pause, looking around the room and hoping to lighten things up a bit.
When they got to the lower pool, John was pleased to see that it was considerably less crowded than the main pool.  Three or four small groups were scattered around the pool itself, and there was a second row of loungers even lower, almost on the rocks themselves.  “Where do you reckon we sit?” said John, musing.
Sherlock decided to check that John had really gone.  He stood up quickly, and strode across to the door, whipping it open and leaning forward to check John wasn’t waiting at the bottom of the stairs either.  That ascertained, instead of going down to the street, he whipped back around and made for the windows overlooking Baker Street.   He couldn’t see John, but then the angle wasn’t really right.  He struggled with the catch on the window for a second before throwing it wide and shoving his face directly downwards in the gap.  There was John, collapsing the long handle back into the suitcase and grabbing the short handle on top to heave it into the black cab that had pulled up.
John caught that, smiling a little to himself and noting how nice the expensive cotton of Sherlock’s shirt felt against his skin, and how he could feel the warmth and firmness of Sherlock’s lower back under his hands.  It was an oddly intimate moment, for just getting Rosie sorted.  He gave Sherlock a sort of double-tap on the strap and said “All good,” and Sherlock straightened up again.  John looked up at him, noting quietly to himself how comfortable his head was at this angle.  Almost like a remembered position – his height to Sherlock’s.  He gave himself a little shake for being sentimental, and then looked down at Rosie, who was happily playing with Sherlock’s shoelaces, with one disappearing straight into her mouth.  He picked her up easily, scooping his hands under her as he removed the lace from her mouth, and raising her back to chest height, facing Sherlock.
Sherlock humphed a bit at this, though probably he shouldn’t have been surprised.  Of course Mycroft would have tabs on John having left the country.
John forced himself to engage, though he kept his eyes closed and his voice low.  “No, I don’t think so – though the next time we come I’d be happy to stay in a different part of the island and explore that area.  Maybe Mdina?”
“Let me just check her nappy before we put her down.  I’ll be back in a moment.”  John stepped out of the room and down the hall to where he’d left his bag by the door.  As he leant down to get it, careful to keep Rosie upright, he looked into the kitchen.  Unrecognisable without a trove of experiments on the table, he laughed quietly when he realised what all the weird shapes on the cabinetry were.  It looked like there were white growths on all the lower doors, and John wondered for a moment just what Sherlock had been up to.  But then he squinted and took a few steps in… Babyproofing!  Sherlock had baby-proofed the kitchen drawers!  For a baby who couldn’t walk, a child he hadn’t seen in months, the daughter of a man he didn’t know would ever forgive him.
Sherlock gulped a bit at this, aware for the hundredth time how John had shaped his life around Sherlock.  How he complemented him, rounded him out, made it easier for Sherlock to be in the world.  He paused, then spoke.
Sherlock nodded thoughtfully.  “That’s just as well.  The seahorse ones are quite expensive, and if I got the elephants I could
John collapsed in the middle with an undignified “Oof” as something hard slapped him on the stomach.  He felt a bit winded and struggled to get his feet under him in the pool as he caught his breath.  Even as he kicked upwards, he was aware of Sherlock laughing loudly to his right, where he’d last been basking in the sun as he rested against the pool’s edge.  Once John finally got to shallower water and could stand, he shot a glare to Sherlock, who clearly got the message despite John’s sunglasses, and didn’t care.
Down on the ground floor, the pool options abounded.  They started at the main pool that they could see from their balcony, and found that this was where most of the young families seemed to have settled in for the day.  Sherlock wrinkled his nose, and John was inclined to agree.
Sherlock’s expression had moved back to a calculated neutral, and John knew Sherlock was deliberately masking himself.  That was probably to be expected.  Sherlock was probably horrified by this development.  Wished John had just shut up and kept this to himself until he got over it.  Wished their lives, their little flat, could just keep going as it always had.  John decided to continue on.  May as well get the rest out while he was here, and then he could escape Baker Street and cower alone.  He would get a cab, he decided.  Who had he been kidding, that he’d have the most important conversation of his life and then just stroll on down to the Tube?
John considered this.  Better to be honest with Sherlock about his thoughts, or would even sharing them be too much?
Sherlock’s forehead crinkled.  “But that can’t be right, I’m reasonably sure you’ve chosen the two least expensive items in the entire shop.  Your frugal instincts do you proud!”
Sherlock blushed lightly and gave Rosie’s hand a little bounce.  She giggled again and clutched his finger more firmly.
John stared at Sherlock.  “You… you… you have never said that in your entire life.  Not once, in all the years I’ve known you, have you said – or even thought – ‘better safe than sorry’.”
Even as John decided he in fact liked the third option the best, he shuddered at Sherlock’s words, wondering what constituted “quite expensive” to Sherlock’s mind.  He decided not to engage… it was Sherlock’s money after all, and if he decided he needed two new pairs of swim shorts, who was John to complain?
Downstairs, John looked at Rosie’s face and noted her eyes starting to flutter shut.  She was clearly deeply contented, resting there against Sherlock’s chest.  He wondered if she could feel his heartbeat, and felt momentarily jealous of his baby daughter.  “Bit much excitement for one afternoon, I think.  I’ll take her off you… and do you mind if I put her down on your bed for a bit?  That way you and I can talk in the kitchen and she won’t be too far.”
Sherlock sucked in a breath.  Clearly the thought hadn’t occurred to him.  Experiments!  With John! In bed!  The mind boggled.
Sherlock’s head lifted sharply and his eyes widened as they made contact with John’s.  “Move out? Why would you move out?”
There stood John, his familiar outline in the doorway more comforting to Sherlock than any sight in the world.  The shape of his shoulders, the way he stood stiffly, slightly crooked even after all these years without a limp.  And on his front, strapped into her carrier, was a chubbier Rosie than he remembered, facing Sherlock with a small fist waving in the air and bright eyes focused on him.  Sherlock drank them in, overwhelmed by the sight.  He breathed out slowly as relief flooded his body, and just as quickly, wariness set in.  Should he be gearing up for a fist fight, verbal attack, or a cup of tea in their old chairs?
John’s eyes were closed and he was clearly kidding, just enjoying the feel of Sherlock’s hand on him and shifting his face so he could kiss rhythmically up Sherlock’s neck.  He didn’t notice that Sherlock’s eyes had blown wide at this comment.  It hadn’t been his intention, and yet…
“You know… it’s a newlywed custom.  First time into the house, and all that.  Pretty sure the Romans started it.”
It was pitch black and well after midnight when the car pulled into the hotel’s grand entrance.  Sherlock stepped nimbly out into the balmy air, smoothing his shirt over his stomach and pulling a hand through his hair self-consciously.  As he closed the door behind him, the driver handed him his bag, and Sherlock looked up at the illuminated Hilton sign above him.
Wanting to ease Sherlock’s apprehension further – he clearly still felt like the other shoe was still about to drop – John broke eye contact and looked around the rest of the room again.
John smiled as he thought of Lestrade doing his best to protect both of them.  He found he couldn’t really picture what had happened at Baker Street that day after he’d left.  The idea of Sherlock and Lestrade sitting around and talking about their feelings seemed rather unlikely, and yet Sherlock was here before him, so it can’t have gone terribly.  He’d give Lestrade a call in the morning to check in and thank him properly.
“Of us!  Together!  You’re in your snazzy new gear and I’m in mine, and I told you we’d need to send Mycroft a photo.  That’s how we’ll secure those flight upgrades.”
Closing his eyes seemed easier than acknowledging the hope he felt, the rush of adrenalin, the craving.
John chuckled, then said, “It’s not about fixing things, though Sherlock.  Really – not a criticism.  All I mean is that I think we’ll both find that there are things in a relationship that are important to us, either in the bedroom or otherwise, and it’s sometimes hard to say them aloud.  And I want us to be the kind of couple that says them aloud, even when it’s awkward.  Sound good?”
John groaned with delight.  He loved it when Sherlock ordered for both of them.  He acknowledged that it should feel patronising, and yet it didn’t.  It was pleasant to have his decisions made for him, on occasion.  “Yes, please,” he directed Alessia, who smiled and nodded as she headed off.
Sherlock breathed out a laugh, chuffed that John kept checking in even with overwhelming evidence that Sherlock was fine.  “Yes, that was more than ok.  I liked it enormously, in fact.”  Even in the dark room, John could see the outline of a grin consuming Sherlock’s face.  His voice was gravelly and amazing, imbued with excitement and still slightly puffed.
When John made his way out of the cab, stuffing his wallet back in his pocket and wondering why he ever bothered getting receipts, he was startled to see that Sherlock remained out front of 221, though the door was open and the suitcases appeared to have been deposited inside.  He had an odd expression on his face.
“Huh,” said John to himself, as he wondered why this store in particular had taken Sherlock’s fancy.  Sherlock had swim shorts – that much had been clear yesterday, and given John had done Sherlock’s packing – and yet the shop clearly interested him.  “Once more unto the breach…” John muttered to himself as he followed Sherlock inside.
“Do you think we can rent a sailboat?” Sherlock mused, staring out at the horizon.  John followed his gaze to see a white-sailed boat moseying along in high contrast against the intense blue of the sea.
John cracked one eye open, squinted at Sherlock.  “Sure,” he said, then closed it again, relaxing his face.
“God, I am a terrible napper.  I always think I’ll just rest for an hour, and then suddenly it’s 6pm and I feel like I’ve been hit by a truck.”
John chuckled to himself as Sherlock’s pleasure washed over him.  He was truly in his element here – marching about confidently and delighting in knowing more than the informational plaques.  John had always considered himself interested in history, and had enjoyed the lessons both at school and as part of his military training.  But Sherlock’s fascination with it was really something else.  History was alive to him in a way that it had never been alive to John.  He cared deeply about the tools used, the ingenuity taken, and who’d known what and whom at the time of the various developments.  If he’d had a pen, John felt sure Sherlock would have marked up the signs, correcting dates or adding context in that the signs’ authors had apparently glossed over.
get the lovely little turtles, and those two pairs would still be cheaper than the seahorses.”  Sherlock dove back into the change room, re-appearing with a third pair of shorts that must have been hanging inside.  These were magenta and had tiny grey blue markings on them.  They looked like stars to John, but when he looked more closely (Sherlock looked very pleased at this level of engagement), he saw that they were indeed tiny, delicate turtles.
“Oh yes – they’re for Rosie.  Toys for her bath time!  I’ve put in all famous explorers.  Jacques Cousteau, Edmund Hillary, Shackleton, Francis Drake.  The gang’s all there!”
Sherlock pulled back further, and wiggled his thumb up and down in Rosie’s hand as he made eye contact with her.  She giggled as she clung to it; her little arm moving with Sherlock’s as he engaged her in this smallest of games.  He took her in as he held her gaze – he couldn’t really see much of either Mary or John in this little creature.  He knew it was polite to tell parents their baby looked like them, but didn’t think John would mind if he stayed silent now.
That got John’s attention.  He opened his eyes in the darkness, and rolled onto his side, facing Sherlock.
Lestrade got up, walking over to take the suitcase from Sherlock, noting its heft as Sherlock stepped nimbly off the chair.  Cor, but the man was graceful.  Even Lestrade could acknowledge that.
Sherlock did so, stepping up and out of the pool, scooping the glasses up and looking as though he might peg them at John.  John reached out a hand and looked meaningfully at Sherlock, daring him to throw them. Sherlock caught the look and changed his mind, slowly descending the stairs once more and handing the sunglasses deftly to John, who promptly put them back on.  “That was unexpectedly mature of you, Sherlock.”  Sherlock just smirked, not denying his train of thought.
“No wait –“ Sherlock interrupted, holding out a hand like a traffic cop.  “Before you tell me… you should know that the elephants glow in the dark.”
“Well, cheers to that, then!  A Sunday in the park with Tim at some point, and potentially helping some kid out after that.”  John tipped his beer bottle in Sherlock’s direction and was pleased with the returning *clink*.  It was reassuring to John that they were developing a bit of a model to have the big, scary conversations – he hadn’t been in a relationship in years that was serious enough to merit these sorts of discussions, and he knew Sherlock never had.  One down, X to go, thought John calmly.
“Well then, I think I should be quite clear.  I feel remarkably less inclined to snog you when you call me a sock or a bean.”
“I don’t want to go to the airport.  I did already consider chasing after him but I dismissed that because I don’t know what I’d say.  And I think if you’re going to chase down a man who’s just been that honest with you, you need to know what you’re going to say, one way or the other.”
“Ok – options for you.  We can inspect the Stock Exchange and some gardens that apparently have amazing water views, or we could line up for the cathedral, or we could just potter through the streets for a bit?  Or… there’s this 5D film experience which is startlingly highly rated as an activity.  Though I’d suggest we wait til later in the day to do that, as it’s only 21’C now and it’ll be 28’C by lunchtime.  We may want the air conditioning by then!”
