"Goodnight Rosebud," Atlas whispered into her ear with a smile.
"You know it?"
"Hello sweetheart, what's wrong?" John asked urgently into the phone.
"I have a headache." Sherlock said quietly, looking at John and Rosie and then over to this girl who was supposedly Atlas. The Atlas.
"Of course, that's what I'm here for," John smiled back at her, pushing his glasses back up his nose and smoothing over his beard. He itched the patch underneath his eye before smiling at her. "I know I'm not your real dad and I know I can never be as important to you as Sherlock is. But I'm thankful to you too. Atlas, you have changed the way I look at everything in my life and I wouldn't trade all this for the world."
"Wot?" Rosie asked grinning at him with John's blue eyes.
"I think I'm going to go back to sleep." Atlas said before she lay back down on the bed, her head tilted slightly to one side.
"Did they say anything John?" Sherlock asked as he got to his partner who was still wearing his black rim plastic square glasses - the arrival of the so called "celebrities" not going unnoticed by some school children changing between classes. Sammy saw them through the heads of students and made a beeline for them.
"No. I chose Ida." Sherlock said as he continued what he was doing, ignoring John's slight snigger of laughter. That earned him a whack off of Mrs Hudson as she resumed her standing position next to where John was sitting in his chair.
"Yes, she's having a fit. Tissue." Sherlock ordered, John standing watching on in painful realisation that you can be a doctor, but nothing will ever prepare you for seeing your own child going through something. "John, tissue." John still didn't move as the remaining family members began to make their way down the stairs. He felt frozen as he watched on helplessly, ignorant to his doctors initiative that couldn't break through his fatherly skin. "John, standing there isn't going to help. I need a tissue, she's bitten her tongue and her mouth is bleeding. There's blood in her saliva. I need a tissue."
"I've sent it to papa," Sherlock smiled before sitting back down on the log and pulled the picnic blanket it back. She rested her head on his shoulder as she ate some crisps, grinning as the dog occupied himself with zoomies.
"Just after," He flicked on his phone. "One AM."
So Mycroft followed his heart and stood opposite Sherlock.
"Hey."
"Gut bacteria. A reserve incase of illness." Atlas said quietly before the teacher gave her another look.
"I thought about you a lot." Sherlock said, his elbows resting on his thighs as he looked out across the sea. "I wondered everyday when I first got up. I suppose that's part of the reason my drug use spiked, why I needed cases." He began to say something else again but forced himself to stop himself. "Anyway, it was you who wanted to speak with me."
"John," Sherlock said again looking at him. "I'm happy."
Or rather she was sick. She thought. Couldn't really tell but before long she had a bucket bouncing against her front as she dry heaved. Then, soon after, she was being wrestled into a wheelchair and carted off to the shower block. Couldn't really tell but she had someone strip off her clothing and help her shower and change. She can only remember staying seated. Her legs too weak.
Feels.
"Okay." Atlas said quietly.
"Anyway, I best be getting back." John sighed getting to his feet, whilst the woman scribbled a number onto a piece of paper.
"John Hamish Watson," Isla said, standing and placing her hands either side of his face. "Don't you dare apologise for loving someone. Ever. Okay?"
It rised from her stomach like fire and before long she was emptying the contents of her stomach into the toilet. She let out a whimper as her head pounded and she wished that one of her parents would wake up. The smell from the toilet made her dry heave and she let a tear fall. Soon, she found the bathroom light to be too bright and she was sick again into the toilet.
"No." John replied quickly. "If it's alright with you. We want them here." He slung an arm around Sammy's shoulder. "With us."
"Oh," Harry said surprised before Atlas then hugged Peter.
"What did he say?" Sherlock asked as he stood by the sink, looking at John over his shoulder. John shook his head, refusing to give an answer.
"Papa?" Atlas whispered.
"You'll learn what's wrong with her tonight in time." John smiled, Atlas smiling too. However, when the five year old looked at him like it was the most stupidest thing he had ever said, he changed what he was saying. "She's got a headache and it's making her feel sick."
This actually had a load of editing so it was better.
"Well, I best be off." Lestrade smiled as he collected his belongings. He had a family he ought to get back to and a wife who requested his help putting his toddler twins to bed.
"PAPA, papa, papa!" Rosie screeched running into his and Sherlock's bedroom, jumping up onto the bed. John woke quickly and looked at her concerned.
"What happened?" Atlas sobbed against Sherlock.
"It is," Morag smiled.
"Thank you, love," John smiled back, looking over at Sherlock. The younger man's nose came to rest near John's neck, his curls tickling John's ear. He sighed, his breath tickling as John pulled off his glasses and looked down at his man. "I love you too." He said as he kissed the younger man's forehead. Sherlock hummed in response before rubbing his cheek against John's shoulder gently. "You know, I read an article the other day."
"I'm sorry." Sherlock frowned.
"Ok," Atlas whispered before resting her forehead against his chest, looking down to her lap.
And then what he felt stab him hardest was thinking of the future she would never have. How beautiful she would look at her wedding. How proud himself and her father would be of her. How pretty her children would be. How much of an amazing musician and writer she would be. How much of an amazing wife, a daughter, a mother, a sister. He rested his forehead against hers in desperation.
And then he came back. His eyes darting around him to find that he was alone. He was confused, very confused.
"Alright," Ruth smiled. "Let's finish the tour and then it'll be time for me to go pick him up from his dad's."
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
"Okay." Atlas said warily, baring in mind she knew who this woman was. She'd been putting up with her as a way of hopefully finally catching her and locking her up for good. But so far her meticulous plan was folding in on itself. Mrs Pertwee was winning and putting Atlas into a cage and keeping her there, trapping her inside.
"Dad?" Atlas asked coming around to where he was putting it in. He looked up at her.
"I'm coming," Sherlock said catching them up and lifting her in a whirlwind onto his hip as she giggled.
"Wednesday." Sherlock offered before adding. "We're taking the instruments and stuff for up here over on Wednesday."
"Yeah?" She asked looking at Sherlock now.
"Why?" Atlas asked quietly. "He might not take it well, you know."
Forty two minutes after the class began she was running down the hallway her bag on her back.
"William Sherlock Scott Watson-Holmes!" Wanda exclaimed. "You should have told me you liked a beard, I'd have known who to hook you up with all those years!"
"I don't...I don't actually know."
"Rob The Vault. The real one." The man replied, there was a thoughtful pause. "Although, not you." He said looking through the glass at Atlas. "I believe we have some unfinished business. Don't we?" Atlas gave a tentative nod before a door opened to her left. She went towards it before stopping in the doorway.
JOHN had his book open infront of him while Rosie lay against his chest with her legs either side of his thighs. She was tucked in neatly, with her ear resting over his heart, her eyes shut. "War & Peace", John was discovering, was a very good book and he scolded himself for not having tried it earlier. Rosie gave a snore and he gave a quiet giggle as she shifted on his lap to move Jeff closer to herself.
"So what's your sister's name?" Atlas asked, looking at him from the side. She gave a little smile.
"Yep," Sherlock frowned before he looked at John. "Your thinking about Atlas again."
"Alright," John said nodding at her before Atlas left and shut the door.
She handed over the certificate just as Sherlock and Rosie came into the room and Atlas hugged John tightly, her body resting against his.
"Dad," Atlas whispered, looking up at him with terror filled eyes.
"Yeah," Sherlock coughed before getting to his feet, John following.
"Atlas, listen to me, they never went home," Dr Aduba smiled. "They are sitting in the family room."
"Your papa was," Jo said with a small smile, glancing at him.
"I know Redbeard," Atlas whispered under her breath. "I know." She looked around the room. "I'm thinking I need to go upstairs and I can be comfortable in the room. Away from people."
"Oh, little Atlas." He said putting his lips to her forehead, his nose bumping her forehead and giving a little sniff. "Your my little Atlas."
"Ill?" Rosie asked. "Why couldn't the doctor's fix her?"
"Sort of. Here and there." John said, looking over to Sammy and Sherlock over his shoulder. "I don't suppose you guys could but your chairs over there. Then I can look at you."
"If we fail - note the
"My, my husband?" She swallowed, John throwing Sherlock a warning look.
"Your aunt and uncle on your mothers side." Sherlock said before he reached into his pocket and pulled out a bag of ashes. Atlas inaudibly gasped.
"Yeah?" John asked, before looking down at Sherlock.
At 80 I will force myself to stop and start the next book. However, it remains to be seen.
"Alright," Mycroft soothed, as she sobbed, Sammy giving her a sideways hug. "I'm going to ask you something and I need you to answer me honestly." Atlas nodded. "Were you scared?"
"Rosie." Sherlock said to the little girl who was trying to strain her eyes away from the projection. "Rosie look at me." She looked at him with innocent blue eyes. "Keep looking at me." There was a wail from the projection speaker and Sherlock jist held Rosie to his chest in desperation to protect her from the noise. "Alright." He whispered before finally the projection shut down.
"You want to be a musician when your older, sweetheart. You need a cello." John smiled before rubbing her hand. "When your better we'll go to
Atlas' room too, was nearly finished on Monday, but Sherlock had stopped himself. He wanted to surprise Atlas with her room, so, when she arrived in through the door directly from school - Sammy had given her a lift - he explicitly told her she wasn't to go in. He'd put up curtains and found the double bed that he was planning to give her - it had arrived earlier in the week - the bookcase from the storage unit and arranged her window seat with bright coloured cushions. Assembled a desk with Greg and opened a window to air the room from the smell of fresh paint. He still waited for the mattresses to arrive.
"Uhmm," Sammy mumbled. "Put Mou in the car and then I'll meet you in the living room?"
"When?" Atlas asked.
Mrs Hudson followed her up the stairs and knocked on the door of what the girl assumed to be the flat.
"Well, I spent a lot of time in Scotland." John laughed. "Northumberland was home but really Scotland was always my true home. The place I was always hankering to be."
They began to play the piece, Atlas' mind becoming preoccupied by the melody which had to be complicated in order to sound effective. She looked over to Sherlock who just nodded in response. She looked out across the grass over to the river at the bottom of the garden as she played before the song ended and she put down her violin. Maybe it would all get better.
"Hey," Sherlock whispered as he stood in the door and he looked upset too. He just stood in the door and Atlas looked back into the mirror and picked up the hairbrush. She pulled it through her hair and frowned when it tugged a little hard. But she did it again and again and again and again. "Atlas." He moved a little closer. "Atlas, sweetheart, stop." He came over and put his hands on the hand pulling a brush through her hair. She tried to pull it again before Sherlock gripped her hand, took the hairbrush and brushed it.
"Yeah." John laughed as he handed Rosie another block to add to her building blocks.
"You have the talent, love." Sherlock smiled, rubbing her back gently.
"No, no, no, let me go! Let me go!" She screamed.
"We have no use for our appendix." He smiled, John giving a small curt nod.
"Because I'm ashamed I did it." Sherlock said, still holding a crying Atlas but he opened his arm and welcomed John into the hug. He kissed him chastely before smiling sadly at him.
"Because it was too much risk! You would go with him." Atlas replied, looking at him fiercely.
"You woke me up!" Rosie said teasingly, looking so like John as she prodded Atlas.
Featuring Sherlock getting mad like a dad. Oooh that rhymed.
"Well, there is something that would make it all easier," John smirked. "And I've spoken to Sherlock about this."
"No." Atlas blubbered.
"Atlas is in the hospital again," Eurus said into the phone.
"You," Atlas replied simply before opening her eyes. "I really hope I didn't break it. I didn't mean to."
"ATLAS." John said before ripping off the lid of the coffin. "Atlas." And then he stopped. A blue body that looked like Atlas was peacefully sleeping. He pulled her out with a heave, a cry escaping from his throat. He ran his hand over the sides of her face, slapping them quietly.
"Your welcome, I'll be back in a mo," Isla smiled.
"You also don't care for mango either," Sherlock smiled.
"We're about to register him. Give him a bit more specific training but he already alerts Atlas to seizures, if she's going to faint and he's good when she's stressed," John smiled.
But she knew she was crying. The hot tears streamed down her face, her vision becoming blurry.
"Oh I don't know. Maybe because your not my dad!" She shouted back, her eyes going wide in realisation of what she had said. Her legs carried her backwards before she pulled on her jacket and darted down the stairs. Her phone left behind on her bedside table.
"Gee." Atlas said as they arrived the emotion suddenly catching them all off guard. Xerxes laid out the pencils that he repeatedly pinched off Abayomi and always
"What?" Atlas asked, but she mustn't have said anything because the nurse just looked at her sadly. "Quick." She tried again, and this time she must have made a lot of noise because the nurse looked at her. Instead of looking at him, the teenager looked out the window to see the first rays of morning dancing over the city.
"And you make me...so happy, John Watson-Holmes. And you make me brave, and so, wonderfully, wonderfully happy." Sherlock smiled. "And I need go tell you that, I could never - can never live without you."
"This." Sherlock gestured to his daughter, who stared at him wide eyed.
"Mmm." Mycroft hummed as he sat himself at the small two person table. They would eat their meal at the big table situated into the conservatory later.
"Language." John warned, a hand still resting on her shoulder. His head caught up in shock moments later when what Atlas had said finally came to rest. "Wait, wh-what?"
"Yes I'm bloody sure," John snapped before frowning and looking at Sammy. "Sorry, that was uncalled for."
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
"Sherlock," John said roughly. "Do you trust me?"
THE following morning, Atlas was standing beside an open window, letting the fresh, Edinburgh morning breeze wash over her. The dog was lying beside her feet and there was a little but of a few over the city. Without warning, a presence appeared at her shoulder, momentarily startling before relaxing.
"They'll always smile on you." Sherlock said looking up.
"What do you mean?" Atlas asked.
"Let me help you up," Sherlock said before leading John outside the room and down down where they could get some help, Sammy and Rosie found them there.
"Of course I'm upset." Sherlock hissed at Mycroft. "But I don't suppose you'd understand that. You've never cared about anyone."
"Because I can't understand why they would be." She whispered, choked up on threatening tears. "I hate not being able to understand."
Conversations were never that long with Mycroft, particularly not between Mycroft and John. They got on, but it always felt awkward or alien to them when they spoke. But John was grateful for this offer. It meant that himself and Sherlock - if he could pull him out his sulk - could set it up upstairs ready for Atlas' return and as an early birthday present.
"But it takes a family to make it a home." Josephine added as she rose from looking at some tissue paper roses that Rosie had made at nursery a few weeks earlier.
"Yes." Rosie replied, pouting as she looked at Sherlock. Sherlock looked up at John for guidance who just nodded his head once. The adoption papers for Rosie were in the bedside table drawer, awaiting signature and sending. They were going to speak with her about it, but it seems it had already been decided.
"I'm sorry, Ro," Atlas said. "It's just, something really bad happened and I'm not coping as well with it as I thought I would be able to."
DRIVING home, Atlas looked into the backseat where Rosie had fallen asleep before looking again out the window. Redbeard had also lain down, as much as he could on his harness, and gone to sleep.
"BYE John." Atlas putting down her phone as she made herself a cup of tea. She hadn't been to see Sherlock in a few hours, it was as if it was too much of a painful undertaking.
There was a delay in replying, Atlas looking up to flash a smile at Sammy.
"Well, Atlas?" Mrs Hudson grinned.
He decided to get up, swinging his covers off and leaving John peacefully sleeping in his side of the bed. He went through into the living room. Then it occured to him. Why? There was nothing he was going to be able to do when he was in there. Nonetheless he continued onwards and entered the room. He had yet to read his fathers book and there were plenty of copies lying around the flat, waiting to go to local bookshops. Slowly he picked it up, tossing it in his hands.
It was then she understood why Sherlock and Mrs Hudson were quite as close as they were. Now as they mentioned something about what Sherlock had done for her and what she had done for him. From what Atlas could gather Sherlock used to move around a lot and that prompted the two children to never really make any friends. This was all sparked by what she already knew about Eurus and how they had to leave after she was sent to an asylum of sorts. However Mrs Hudson was the kind lady situated in the house next door to the family on one of their many moves. One day a young Sherlock knocked on her door and asked to come inside during one of his parents many fights. She let him in, let him read the books she had on many shelfs and let him stay and drink tea. Slowly this became a common state of affairs, Sherlock going everytime he didn't feel welcome in his house.
"Billy's real, isn't he?" Rosie asked looking up at him.
ATLAS woke early, earlier than everyone else. For once Sherlock was sleeping so she slid off the bed and out the door, grabbing a glass of water from the kitchen. She stood infront of the sink.
The seizure eventually stopped, not long after the crowds of school children were shuttled out of the section of canteen. Her eyes flickered open and Atlas' assessed the room her eyes locking on Sammy.
Seventeen minutes after the class began and she watched as the pieces were sprinkled onto the floor.
Then the music came to it's conclusion and she stopped playing feeling that playing anymore would be to drag it on too long.
"Alright, sweetheart," John whispered. "That's it." John paused before looking at her with a little smile. "Oh, love," John said as he watched Atlas' eyes glaze over and her body goes rigid. "Don't move, Sherlock."
"Sherlock!" The man exclaimed wide eyed and beaming. "I don't believe it, look at you!" There was a hug before he caught sight of Atlas. "Oh, Atlas! Look at you aswell, my goodness! Look how you've grown!" He bustled past the rest of the family and hugged her tightly, then with hands either side of her face he smiled. "Still got those eyes. Still playing fifty different instruments?"
The sound of a gun being loaded echoed through the room as her eyesight slowly came back into better vision. Let's not forget, the girl already wore glasses for reading and she secretly thanked the lord she left them at home like she normally did.
"Yeah?" Atlas asked, looking up at him expectantly.
"How was your appointment Ida?" Mycroft asked, looking to his other niece who jumped off the counter and walked over.
She was just a mess of heaving sobs now and Sherlock, grabbing a firm hold of her shoulders, swivelled her around to look at him.
"Papa!" Rosie screeched, carefully making her way off the stool. "Your not allowed to be in here." She took his mug off him. "Out." She warned, her eyes narrowing. Then she playfully pushed him out causing him to laugh at how serious she was.
Sherlock looked momentarily over to his eldest daughter, sure that he had heard her say something. She was still peacefully sleeping, curled up in a ball on her side.
"Oh," Sammy said. "Thank you."
"I thought I'd sit with you a bit," He smiled.
"Absolutely," John smiled. "You know, me and your dad watched them in Lufoten."
"No." Sherlock squeaked. "I loved you then. Always have. Since Barts." There was a light chuckle before it died.
"I'll be back in a moment, Duck," Sherlock smiled before he disappeared.
"I was poisoned." Atlas whispered before looking up at her dad, who still had a hand stroking through her hair.
"Is she alright?" John asked the paramedic.
"You remember?" He asked, Atlas only giving a little nod. Her eyes filled with unshed tears and she shuffled to lean against John.
"Yes." John said before Sherlock lay with his cheek over John's chest.
name." The older lady said, somewhat not sure what to think of the name. "Mrs Hudson." She said introducing herself, before motioning for her to go up the stairs. So much of her life already had been building up to this moment, the moment she would meet her father. Normally you would assume that a girl would search her mother, but when your said mother is in a psych hospital somewhere in the middle of the ocean, there is very little to go on. In her mind, she didn't want her mother in her life, she just wanted someone,
"Papa?" Atlas whispered to him.
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
"Sorry, she's our landlady." Sherlock smiled, whilst the tired looking woman began her ascent again.
"Comfortable," John mumbled.
SHERLOCK sat, his heading his hands in the waiting room as he waited. Waiting to be able to go and see John, waiting to see if he was going to be alright.
"Dad," Atlas smiled. "I have a strong bond with you because mum was a bitch."
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
old." She joked with a smile.
Atlas began to type: I'm not so sure of that. But quickly erased it sending the following instead:
"An incident with a teacher. We are not sure what yet, but something has happened and we are waiting for our key eye witnesses."
"John?" Sherlock asked, putting a reassuring hand to his back and rubbing with his thumb. "It's okay."
"How are you two managing parents evening on Thursday?" Lucy asked with a grin, signing as she went.
"Wake up. Wake up." He said lying her down on part of the cement. "Come on. " He put his ear down to her mouth and heard there was no breath. He checked the pulse. Nothing. Nothing at all. "No. No. No." He sobbed before pulling her into his arms and crying over her body. He clutched her to his chest, his mind running through all those memories with her. She was as much his as Rosie and he was trying as hard as possible to fight the tears. He couldn't tell how long he was sat there it could have been hours or minutes he couldn't tell. His daughter was dead. Dead as the murder victims he'd uncovered. Dead. D. E. A. D.
"It's fine." Atlas gurgled as she awoke from her sleep but stayed fixed to John and his shoulder.
"And eat, love." John said looking at Sherlock fondly before leaning in to kiss him softly, and rest a small, but strong hand against his cheek.
"Let's do this dad." Atlas said before together they carefully spread the contents of the bag onto the wet grass, the ashes seeping away into the soil. Atlas was surprised when she gave an uncontrollable sad sigh and that was when Sherlock began to cry. His chest heaved and his eyes stung as he cried quietly, Atlas hugging him close. One arm round his front and an arm round his back. "It hurts rather a lot more than I thought it would." Atlas admitted to her dad, tears fighting their way out.
"Yeah?" Sherlock asked as he took her hand.
"Seems like they have more to do. Would you like some tea?" John offered, Mrs Hudson looked him up and down as if to say
"My lovely husband, I'm not having a go. I'm sad too," John whispered as Sherlock nodded before clutching his partner closer.
"I don't want to," Atlas whimpered before putting her head against John's shoulder. "I don't want to."
to tell. And could only be told by him.
She shook her head.
"Two hours. Two and a half hours." The nurse said in reply. "Atlas, we have questions we need to ask. In a while, when you feel better."
"Thank you, Sam," Atlas nodded back. "You are too."
"As long as you don't scream, singing is still permitted." It rang. "I like it when the dying sing." Atlas gave a sigh before desiring to continue.
"The beard. It's nice." Atlas smiled as she shuffled to move a little closer to John, Sherlock following so she still had her forehead against his lips.
"Yup." John accented.
"Warning, Sherlock, Atlas, Sam, Sophie is handful and a homophobe," Harry said.
Silence descended before Atlas reached out a tremoring hand to touch Sherlock's face. Her fingers ran over the creases and lines of deep thought. Of deep worry and pain. Sherlock watched her facial expressions keenly as she ran her fingers over his nose and forehead. They ran up to his hairline as he crinkled his nose and Atlas then put her fingers back down and laughed as they went over the rumples of skin.
"And I'm not coming back." Abayomi sighed, falling defeated onto an old classroom chair. They were in the room that the quintet and claimed as theirs just last week as for it was at the top of the stairs and forgotten about. Atlas had picked the lock and when Mr Fraggerty had found them their two days earlier had said they could stay. It was an unused social studies room after all - the room being far too small to be a classroom but too big to be a storage room. The quintet had coined it The Box because it was shaped, remarkably like a cardboard box.
"Oh love." John said as Atlas only cried when he spoke, Sammy moving away. John took his place and Atlas leaned her temple against John's stomach. Sherlock came over to stand aswell. It didn't last long as after another few moments she was dry heaving again to a sob or five.
Sammy pulled up ten minutes later with a smile and a curt wave. Getting out he went straight for Atlas and gave her the tightest hug imaginable.
"I'm sorry, papa," Atlas said so quietly.
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
"No, uh....yeah no." Atlas managed to say, still no tears threatening yet. She lay her head against his shoulder.
"Atlas," Rosie said quietly, unbuckling her seat belt and hopping onto Sammy's lap. "Breathe."
anyone. But did she need to tell John and Sherlock that it hurt? No. They already knew.
"I'm sorry. Look. I shouldn't have said what I said." Atlas said. "I had no right to call you out like that."
SHERLOCK and his mother had been walking in thoughtful silence for quarter of an hour now. Moonlit ground paved a pathway for absent torches. Trees smiled gayly at the once common trespasser through the woods upon his return.
"Mum, dad. This is Atlas." John said motioning towards the girl who stood.
ROSIE looked around the room wide eyed. This wasn't where she was when she had last opened her eyes. They landed upon a table with puzzle pieces and pictures of people and knives and countries all across the world. Tentatively her little legs wobbled their way over to the table and she looked at them. A hand clasped over her chin, she frowned, elbow on table. She didn't cry, she didn't scream. Much to their dismay, Sherlock and John had decided to teach her what to do in similar situations.
"What are they testing for?" Sherlock asked quietly, looking up at John.
"Sometimes I wish I had." Sherlock shouted back before reeling at what he'd just said. Atlas' eyes going wide at what he'd just said before she just looked at him, cold.
"She's only been in a few days," Sherlock smiled.
"What?" Atlas said blinking, Sammy looking at her with a furrowed brow.
"Lovely." Wanda smiled as Rosie handed her a slip of paper with a colouring of Redbeard on it.
"Nope. I refuse to believe it." Sherlock exclaimed before darting into the kitchen.
"Better. I'm still not feeling great. Probably need to sleep it all off." Atlas said quietly before she got to her feet, rinsed out her mouth. She wobbled through to her room and sat on her bed, the covers drawn over her lap. John sat down opposite her and looked at her kindly as she sent a quick text to Sammy saying she was ill. Not to her surprise he replied quickly.
"Fine." John said. "But we have to find a way to help her make friends." Sherlock nodded in appreciation to what he had said before resting back against his shoulder. Sherlock sighed before wrapping an arm around John's torso and hugging him, creating another level of surprise. Of course they'd hugged before, but it was hardly ever Sherlock who initiated it. It was more common for the younger man to hug their children than his partner, that was the way it's always been.
"Okay." Doctor Aduba smiled. Atlas began to take off her mask and the Doctor put up his hands. "Atlas, don't. No, no...you need to stay in bed."
"It's nicer than it was yesterday, however it is 56.78% cooler due to the wind. The temperature is 17 degrees, not unusual for this time of year, particularly not for the seasons we're going through. The chance of rain is 47%, less than yesterday, but still enough to merit you wrangling our five year old into a jacket she didn't want to wear and boots. In addition to this, we can expect a cold night with overhanging fog, not much in the city though." Sherlock babbled half in-audibly, looking skyward. His dark curls showing hints of lighter brown throughout before he looked back to his gloves, shook them and replaced them in his pocket.
"Sherlock?" John said to the man who was sitting with a cup of tea in his hand. He looked up. "I was wondering why you had Rosie calling Mary mother. I'd always planned on it being Mama or Mum or Mummy."
"You can't." Sherlock announced, John giving him a sideways look of somewhat disapproval.
Rosie nodded eagerly as she took Mycroft's hand. "And papa." She exclaimed pointing at John and hauling
"I'm ok." Atlas said before sniffing. "Slip in behind Rosie, it'll be more comfortable."
"Agreed. I'm in."
"It'll be alright," Sherlock soothed as she began to convulse and he just sat there helpless. Watching as John put a hand to her back and just let it there.
"And I love you too."
"I was wondering if you and Sam would like to be homeschooled," John said after a bit of time. "We could homeschool Ro too."
"How's Atlas?" Wanda asked, her mouth turning upwards slightly at the thought. Herself and Timothy knew Sherlock had a kid, but through much discussion they knew it was best to not tell Mycroft. They'd met Atlas the day she was born and seen her until the age of seven before Sherlock gave her up for adoption. There were no photos of them with her. Then all ties were severed. It was a pure stroke of luck that Atlas had run away from her foster placement in search for Sherlock. In some ways they were indebted to their oldest son for his quick discussion with the adoption agencies to allow Atlas to stay. It wasn't easy but something obviously gave her the motivation to achieve it.
"Are you okay?" John asked quietly, Sherlock sitting up abruptly to offer him a look before leaning against him again.
"What's that supposed to mean?" Sherlock asked quietly, looking at him with a saddness in his eyes.
"Come on Rosebud," Atlas said to her, leading her to the quiet, unoccupied living room where all instruments were waiting.
"John." Sherlock cried.
"John." He smiled, taking the piece of paper. He flicked it over in his hand, the name written on the back of a business card. Sighing he thought of the last time he had been given a phone number in a romantic way. By Eurus. And then his mind went to Sherlock. That brilliant man, who'd he'd promised to marry, to love. The man he was so in love with that it ached. The children he had with him that made their house a home.
ONCE meals had been eaten, the family departed leaving the Society, Rosie, John, Sherlock and Redbeard to enjoy an evening in.
"I came back." Sherlock smirked. "I came back for you, just as much as papa and Rosie." He pulled away and put his hands either side of her face. "I don't know where I would be today if you weren't in my life."
"Oh?" Dr Aduba asked looking at her. "Sit forward a moment." He put a stethoscope to her back.
"What are names anyway? You're my conductor of light," Sherlock said as he looked at John. "Doesn't matter what your name is."
"Everyone's going to come down to watch them from here," John said, wrapping an arm around her shoulder. "The northern lights are here so we might as well catch them while we can. If you feel okay?"
"It was nice to meet you." John smiled before showing her out as Sammy packed up his guitar, leaving the room.
"If she ever has any speech problems, I'll be happy to take her on, if I can." Lucy said with a light in her blue eyes.
"Thank you," They all signed before they left.
"Nope," he smiled. "Nowhere else is much more important."
"No I'm not. They're going to hate me because no-one ever likes me and they'll probably say things and they'll probably say something about papa not being my papa but he is and-"
"Right. We should give Redbeard a wander." Sammy smiled.
A set of red baubles immediately attracted Rosie who made a beeline for them, moving faster than any of them could keep up with her.
"I'm sorry Sam." Atlas frowned, as he looked at her.
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
"Your dad's going to bring your phone th-" John started.
"John," Sherlock said again, John looking down at him fondly.
"Tranqs." Eurus replied before looking at his neck, putting a hand to it and removing a snapped piece of needle. "That's how fat your neck is." Mycroft shot her a look before they both glanced over the small grey concrete room. This was not good.
"Risky," Atlas whispered.
And now, she was standing, looking down at her father whom was still asleep. She desperately wanted to reach out and touch him but she feared that he would react to it. He was a soldier after all.
"Papi?" Rosie asked gently.
"Thanks," Atlas smiled as Sherlock moved away and stood up. Atlas slowly stood up and gripped onto John's hand as he got up aswell.
"I know," John said. "God, Sherlock, I know." He kissed Sherlock's hair like he was a child too and he didn't care, the younger man didn't even glance in John's direction.
"Eu EU," Rosie said looking up at Eurus. "Is that Papi and daddy?"
Once they had finished the two men returned to the apartment quietly choosing to walk their way home. By this point the light had dwindled and they had since moved over to Scotland Yard to check over some details. Because the light was low, the two men linked fingers and continued walking along the pavement. Their shadows grew and shrunk as they walked along beneath the lampposts.
"I want to," Sherlock rumbled before untangling himself from John to sit next to him instead. They disconnected the call and hit the button for video call and Sammy picked up. He looked a mess and was seemingly in a hotel room, huddled up in a sofa chair.
"If I stay here and your dad and papa help you up." Doctor Aduba smiled before Sherlock hooked an arm under her armpit, John mirroring the position on the other side.
"But your still awesome, Mycroft," Atlas smiled. "Good luck with your case, I love you."
"I'm sure we can fit you in," Gordon grinned. "This is?"
"Is it obvious?" John admitted as Atlas looked at him as if he was an idiot.
"Would you like to stay for tea?" John asked after some time, the question directed at Wanda.
"But you're my dad too." She said quietly. "I want to be a Holmes."
"Oh," Atlas said quietly looking at him. "Okay, I'll give you lots of hugs."
"Your neither of those things," Sacha said, crouching down infront of her. "Even covered in blood. Now, I think you and all of your family deserve to go home, have a shower and get some sleep."
"Me and your papa, are going to Lufoten, for five days," Sherlock said with a smile and Atlas smiled back.
"I like Watson-Holmes with a hyphen better." John smiled. "But, Mr Chatterjee's establishment?"
The first case to come in were two morris dancers who claimed to have had fraud committed against them. They were separate cases but they came together because they thought that they were linked. Infact they had been stealing from each other and so therefore both parties had committed fraud.
That made John smile a little and chuckle which warmed Sherlock as he just sat with him.
"Okay," Atlas whispered. "I love you."
"Do you want to talk?" Sherlock asked gently, holding Sammy's face between his hands.
"High functioning sociopath." Atlas quipped before smirking at her uncle, who immediately picked up her reference. They thanked him for the books before leaving the house and trekking the streets. Mycroft had tried to offer them lunch, but Atlas had declined. They would both rather have something simple.
"That I'm an outsider."
"Shit, no," Atlas said before scrabbling up to get her sorted tub that was due to be re-done.
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
exciting job. Then there were Timothy and Wanda who adored her and she adored them equally as much. Mycroft who was partial to letting her bake with him and Eurus who was happy enough to play, read and paint with her.
"I did it - ish." Atlas smiled. "I sorta did it. But I still did it."
"When's it ever going to be the right time?" Sherlock retorted making Mycroft stand up straight, his stern expression diminishing. Meanwhile Atlas remained stood at the side of the room, John making his way over to her.
Sherlock looked bemused, aware that he wasn't normally subject to this question he frowned in thought. "I just shot the woman I fell in love with." He paused momentarily. "But I only loved her for a while."
"Yes, dad," Atlas smiled, rolling her eyes before looking out the front window.
"Yes finally, that's what your dad was saying all of last night." John huffed before Atlas slowly walked over and slipped her arms around his waist.
"No, Xerxes is the only one whose deaf," His mother smiled. "Lucy."
"Hello Redbeard." Timothy said as the dog bounded over to say hello to him.
"Me?"
"Well here's your violin." Sammy said. "Message me yeah? Or maybe we could face time tonight, I need to get that girl's face out my mind."
Yes, Sherlock's not super true to character in any of this but it's his own daughter.
"No," Atlas squeaked. "Can I stay down here with Redbeard and drink tea?"
"Why are you so cool?" Sammy asked as he followed Rosie up the folding ladder. It resembled a loft ladder as an oppose to a rope ladder, for it to be more sturdy.
Hope you enjoyed!
"I'm sorry," Atlas said as Sherlock sat up and also looped an arm around her.
"Good," Harry smiled.
"Yes and also because I think I'll look pretty awesome with a good dose of scars," Atlas said.
"Your getting a bit old for this Rosie, love," John smiled before she looked at him then shook her head. "Alright then."
"Yes. I have heard from your dads that you have a very good picture memory and not such a good audio. Thank you Miss Watson-Holmes. I'll be by in the next few days to see you with your results."
Totes emotes.
"Sorry, I-" Atlas started. "Nevermind, brain fog, the thoughts gone. Nice to meet you, Miss Stewart." Before she darted back off to play with Redbeard.
ATLAS and Sammy were sat opposite each other in a little secluded booth at the side of the coffee come book shop.
"Atlas?" Sherlock asked, crouching down.
"Ok."
"Atlas?" Mycroft asked before he took her wrist and checked for her pulse and his eyes went wide. "Mother."
"It's not though is it?!" She screamed at him. "Dad, it's important because I was six and it was my fault you did it!" She screamed at him through sobs, John looking at Sherlock pointedly.
"Okay," Damien said quietly, removing his jumper and fashioning it into a pillow for her, the dog walking away and lying down, watching her over the tops of his paws.
"End of tourist season," John said, looking at him softly. "I really am sorry, Sam."
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
"I'll go get you some water." Sherlock said, disappearing into the bathroom and collecting the glass that was beside the sink. He came back in and handed the glass over, Atlas taking a few small, initial sips. Carefully, Sherlock took it from her and placed it on the table.
"Of course she does." Timothy smiled. "As much as Sherlock loves Rosie, as much as you love Sherlock, as much as I love Wanda."
"If it-"
John put the book he was reading to Rosie down, as Atlas allowed Sammy to sit on the chair - herself standing to his right. Sherlock sat down on the sofa, not close enough to John as normal. Ever since that woman, ever since John had
SHERLOCK and John didn't speak until that evening when they were in their room. The younger man was sat sorting the bookcase into alphabetical order after pulling them all out - even though they already
"It's not her first." Sherlock replied, refusing to look at his siblings or parents. Only looking at John, who placed a reassuring hand on his shoulder. "Atlas experiences Non Epileptic Seizures. Difficult to diagnose as many people with NES will be diagnosed with straight up epilepsy. NES occurs when people get exceptionally anxious or stressed or any number of things. When she was little, it primarily happened when she was overwhelmed or..." Sherlock dropped his head and his voice. "when she had a sensory overload."
"Atlas has been to a party and Sammy came back here with her." Eurus explained. "She won't stop crying, John."
"Atlas." Sherlock pleaded as his daughter looked off into the distance. She had to have been drugged at some point and now she was feeling the after effects. It was almost like experiencing dissociation and not coming back for prolonged periods of time. Her breathing was fast as Sherlock gently his hands either side of her face to make her face him. "Hey. Hey."
"You don't have to look at the body." Atlas said quietly to her best friend, she pulled on her gloves.
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
"Atlas left a note. She took the dog for a walk with Rosie." John said after placing the mugs of tea down.
"But why?" Jo queried.
John gave a chuckle. "Yes. And it's the best feeling ever."
"Did you sleep alright, dad?" Atlas asked, looking at him softly.
MYCROFT sat quietly on one of the chairs on the top floor at the top of the stairs. There he could be sure to catch one of the girls if they went off looking for their parents. His phone rang quite abruptly, stirring him from his paperwork for the government.
"All the kings horses and all the kings men, couldn't put Dumpty together again." Rosie returned, Atlas giving a sad smile. Rosie's face dropped. "They couldn't fix her like my mother."
ATLAS HOLMES:
"No. No it's alright, Sherlock." John said, widening his arms for Sherlock to come back. He did so slowly, hugging in closely to John. He took a deep breath, breathing in the scent of John.
"You tried to seriously tried to keep it a secret from Mycroft and Eurus?" Wanda laughed before she looked over at Timothy smiling.
"Oh," Ruth said. "So you really don't mind if I bring him by?"
The grip on her was tight and she was carried down the hallway and out the door.
"Sammy," Atlas said quietly. "I think I'm going to have a fit...but I don't want them to make a fuss."
"Now you don't happen to be related to the detective are you?" His mother asked, Atlas being filled with an air of uncertainess as she contemplated an appropriate answer. Her father had made enough enemies to kill her several times over. "Only, my late husband went to school with him. That's all."
"Hey, Ro, sweetheart," John said looking up.
I know it seems all over the place.
"I'm very excited to meet them," Isla grinned.
"Alright?" He asked with a smile and Atlas nodded. She then went back to Rosie and hugged her and Jeff before Jo.
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
"But I'm better." Atlas whispered.
"They're smart children, Atlas and Rosie." Wanda smiled. "Your lucky to have them."
"Alright. Shall we go make the bases so they have time to rise?" John asked as he put a hand to Rosie's hair, causing her to look up. She gave a nod and Sammy rose to his feet. Once downstairs, they began to pull out the ingredients required to make their pizza bases.
"Oh sorry," John said, giggling.
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
Sherlock kneeled infront of her and put his hands on her knees, rubbing with his thumbs.
Atlas nodded. Staring into the distance shortly after.
"Georgia." He replied quickly, as he ran a finger down the spine of 'The Illiad'. Atlas spotted the boxes of new books over to the side, she could smell them.
"PETER!?" Atlas exclaimed before Sherlock ran into the darkness to see the man dragged into the hallway by Atlas.
"Ok." Rosie said quietly. "What about those thingy's where she looks into the distance?"
"I get seizures," Atlas answered. "I can feel them coming on. I don't have an aura right now."
"I finished the violin section for my music." Atlas said as she handed Sherlock the piece of music. He studied it before nodding and placing it next to him. "We're playing it on New Years Day when everyone is around."
I know it's bad.
"Morning." Wanda smiled as Sherlock sat yawning with Rosie and began to brush through her hair. Jeff was in her hand still and she smiled at Sherlock who smiled in return.
"I love you," Sherlock said again through his sobs, still desperately clutching at John's t-shirt.
THE breeze flowing through the room confused Atlas and suddenly she found herself sitting up abruptly. Gripping at the sheets and blinking her eyes repeatedly.
"If it's any justification Mr Holmes." The man from behind the desk said. "I believe you are, for you just handed me a photo of a very cute child with blonde hair and not your driver's license."
"Thank you," John said as they were served their panini's and Rosie her tuna sandwich. He tucked into his chicken sandwich and made the childrenswear not to tell Sherlock about it. "Alright?"
"Me and...people...don't exactly get along." Atlas explained, hoping to persuade them another way but it clearly wasn't going to work.
"Oh, um, Sherlock?" Sammy said. "The solicitor wants to see me again tommorow and I need you to come. It's in the morning."
"What shopping?" Sherlock asked bluntly, hanging up his coat on the coat rack.
Rosie's crying had marginally subsided and now she just snuffled into Sherlock's jacket. She was cold in here, the room was cold, everything felt cold. Atlas glanced over at John again. She hated that she couldn't figure out what was going on, she was sure Sherlock was feeling it too.
"Hello again dear." The man said before she scowled at him.
"That psycho mother of mine." Atlas said before collecting her stuff and leaving with Sammy. She would have picked a fight but the air was already thick with growing tension.
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
"Can we play a game while we bake?" Atlas asked curiously as she had a few burning questions she desired to ask Mycroft.
"Mycroft," Atlas said quietly. "Mycroft. Uncle-Uncle Mycroft."
"Till she's out?" Wanda asked looking at him apprehensively.
"Yes. She needs to know your coming home." John said as he brushed a curl off Sherlock's forehead.
"She is pretty amazing." Sherlock said, giving a little laugh.
Alcohol. Drugs in the corner. The smell.
"Okay, I need-need to go back-back to sleep." Atlas chattered as she pulled away and looked at Sammy. She was just about to lie down when she felt Wanda's hand go to her forehead.
"Oh really? Pray tell, do enlighten me," John said raising an eyebrow in mockery.
"Thank you." Rosie squeaked again before finding that her position on top of the covers was too cold and deciding to go underneath them. Cold feet making John giggle, before she laughed too. He looked at the clock. 8:32am. That was okay. They were going to be here a while.
"They were probably up late last night," John said, smiling into his rear view mirror. "Thank god, we have a moments peace."
"Right Ro." Sherlock said as he held her and smiled his goofy smile. "Let's go change your tights, shall we?" Rosie nodded as Sherlock took her upstairs.
"You've done such a good job dad." Atlas said smiling at him as she looked over the banister, down to what was about to be their kitchen area.
"Why?" She asked hoarsely.
Without sheet music Atlas began the accompaniment on the piano, Sherlock paused in momentum.
"Fair enough." John smiled before coming into the kitchen properly. He collected a glass and filled it with water before looking over to her. "I haven't asked any questions about...you know." He said quietly. "But I just have one. Why did you shoot her?"
"Yes, you did." John said as he looked at the ground. "I'm sorry Sherlock. I never meant to do what I did."
"I care about my person more too." Atlas laughed before she moved from giving a John a hug to giving Sammy hug.
John thought,
She looked over to where she was keeping all the books she had borrowed from Sherlock. They were all based on different things such as drugs and how they affect a person's mental capacity. Then she had another one on Iraq and Afghanistan, one on the "Hidden War", another based on the Freemasons. The list was endless and Atlas was thankful that Sherlock was akin to her reading styles. Then again there were also some books she'd borrowed off of John such as the Lord Of The Rings and Hobbit series. There were some more good fictional reads borrowed from him aswell.
"Atlas," Sammy whispered looking at her gently before pulling her to his chest. "I'll kick their asses."
"Alright," John said getting to his feet before Atlas stretched out some fingers to him. Oustretched and urgent. "I'll be back in a moment." John smiled as he moved to the door.
"I think she has represented you perfectly." Atlas said clapping her dad on the shoulder as he gave her a look. She just shrugged her shoulders (🤷🏻) before going to help John make some toast.
"I know. But your nearly there." Dr Aduba smiled, Atlas nodded. "I'll be by this afternoon." And then he left.
"No, she ne-" Sherlock started.
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
"Yes. And I am Alexander Mycroft Chad Holmes. Hate the Chad. And Eurus was Jessica Eurus Tiffany Holmes." Mycroft replied smoothly as the chocolate chips were finally added the he main batter.
"You sick bastard." He said under his breath, before collecting he shovel and digging. Digging until his hands hurt, the skin on his palms peeled, digging until he couldn't take big enough breaths, till he was too warm, digging until he hit something hard. Scraping round the edges he found the lid for the coffin and tried to clear out the name. It read her name and he began to work faster and faster.
"Yeah." John breathed before he looked at Sherlock. "I'm so lucky to have you."
"Oh," Mrs Hudson smiled as she clapped her hands together and got to her feet. "Boys, my boys!"
"We need this." John said, brandishing a multi coloured soft ball from the bag on a table nearby. "Do not mess around. First, your going to throw the ball around the room, saying each others names, before saying a random fact you know about the human body."
"Hello Bee." Sherlock said, squatting down to her height so that he could meet her with eager, awaiting arms.
"Yeah." Atlas said quietly before lying down on Sherlock's legs and curling up. They stayed like that for a while until more of Rosie's questions arose.
"No," She squealed. "Papa?"
"I love you too," Sammy sniffed.
"Where's Ro and Sam?" Atlas asked again.
"I'm trying." Atlas hiccuped.
"Yep," Atlas smiled. "I can't believe we're doing it at 3am but it's the best time."
"Yup," Atlas smiled. "Sammy had a cat called Mou so she's living with us and Aunty Eurus is looking after her while we're away."
"I could take you out to see them one night." Dr Aduba offered, only to be met with Atlas shaking her head.
The light flicked on harshly, and she covered her eyes with her hands, which were, at this point, uncontrollably tremoring like luggage on a freight train. Removing her hands after her eyes adjusted, she looked at the backs of her hands, remaining lying down, and tilted her head. She could see the sweat even on the backs of her hands and she looked up to meet the eyes of the nurse.
"I'll sit on the floor too," Atlas smiled as Sherlock nodded.
"Why would someone do this to a kid?" Lestrade muttered from the sidelines as he watched two brilliant minds save another brilliant mind. And then he saw John and observed how he had changed Sherlock's life. How if Sherlock didn't have a best friend he'd be a different man, he wouldn't even be human.
"Go on, I'm waiting," Sherlock said.
"I love you," Rosie said. "A lot."
"But-"
"Sit back down!" Kirsty screamed and Atlas did so before emptying the cardboard box.
"If they're back so soon it must be good news, mustn't it? And your pa is here..."
"Hmm," Rosie said turning around to look at Harry and her papa who was sat next to her drinking tea. "Is it a Jeff!?" Harry looked at her with a smiled. "It's a dipcus."
"I would love to," Eurus smiled as she looked at her. "Thank you."
"I'm cuddly? I'm soft?" John asked with a deep rumble on his chest.
Then a few moments later, there was mumbled speech as Atlas 'came back'.
They deposited their shoes in the lobby before John helped Sherlock remove his coat around Rosie who was sleeping in his arms.
"Do you feel alright?" John asked quietly, his profession of a doctor proving to be rather handy. It was the only way he managed to persuade them to let Atlas come home, through promises from John to look after her.
"SHERLOCK Holmes." Atlas heard through the door that was slightly ajar and she felt tears threatening again in relief. The familiar squeak of his posh shoes before the flounce of him into the room. Sammy had already left along with everyone else and now she was sitting with Mr Fraggerty in his office.
"It's-"
"How are you Rosie?" Sammy asked as he looked at her as she sucked her bottom lip.
"How are you Jo?" Atlas asked as she sipped some of her lemonade that had just been put on the table.
"She had a tremor start up, sometimes called a shaking attack." John informed with a frown. "Her limbs were shaking."
"She hasn't been yet," John smiled.
"Sherlock." John said, coming in and standing by his friend. He put a hand in his shoulder as he put his mug into the sink then stayed when Sherlock didn't speak. "Are you alright?"
"Go away," Atlas said a little louder.
"If your obliging?" Lucy asked, exchanging a smile with Ruth.
John looked over to Sherlock with a small smile. He recognised the music but when Sherlock was singing it it sounded less like the original jumpy rhythm and instead sounded, raw, gentle and kind.
Sherlock took a seat next to Rosie and opened the paper and began reading. He often didn't find the paper useful, just amusing. Especially when someone thinks that they have solved a case but in reality they haven't and he'll probably get called to the scene. There were endless reports of births, deaths, cars and sports - none of which Sherlock found interesting. He sighed flicking through the rest of the pages before handing John the paper. He too couldn't find anything of interest and so the broadsheet was quickly disregarded and placed to one side.
"Found what?"
"Yeah, lovebug?" John asked looking at Atlas.
"I can hear." Leanne smiled before she made her way up and into the living room. She was faced with a little girl of no more than five, prancing about the room. A dog lying by Atlas' feet, her son playing the guitar and a gone grey haired man sitting on the sofa.
"I do?"
"Dad."
"Tick tock tick tock."
"Just stop making problems where they're aren't any." Sherlock said, about to leave the bathroom. However, a gentle hand on his wrist pulled him back to opposite John who was frowning.
"Sorry about that, she has a medical thing, she appears well but she's actually not. That's why I'm here. She needed to forget it all," Sherlock smiled.
"Right then miss." John said coming into the kitchen and squatting down infront of her. "What's this drawing?" He gestured to the piece of paper in her hand with a smile. But then Rosie's little facade began to break and her light blue jacket arm - which was so like Atlas and Sherlock's - was drawn up to hide her eyes. Her lips parted in a young child cry and she found herself crying into her arm, Jeff falling to the floor. John collected Jeff and placed him on the kitchen cabinet before going back down to her, wrapping his arms around her, being careful not to crinkle the picture. Lifting her off the ground, she begin to cry child like sobs, shrieking into John's shoulder.
"What did they die of? If you don't mind me asking of course?" Zoe asked gently.
"Peter," He smiled, taking her hand before he caught sight of Sammy with make up and nail polish.
"I think you however Dr John Watson is the perfect team for Miss Ida." The voice said.
"Then this won't hurt a bit." Mary-Anne said pulling a gun to her own head making Atlas and Sherlock jump.
"She's visiting." Sherlock announced to Lestrade who looked at him disbelieving anything Sherlock says.
"I'm sorry who?" Sherlock asked abruptly.
"Yeah. Of course we can." John said, he got off the bed and shuffled next to Sherlock. Atlas swaddled in her blanket and looked at her parents. She hugged her middle and looked at them. There was a long pause before Atlas said.
"Yup." Atlas replied before they exchanged a smirk and set off for the sounds. Atlas handed her violin over to Sammy who held back by a bench beyond the police tape. She looked around the police cars before making her way over to the tape.
"Papa." Atlas cried, snot coming out of her nose and joining her tears on his shirt.
Around ten minutes after their arrival, Atlas and Timothy could be heard entering the building. Their footsteps approached the steps before the door opened and in stepped Atlas and Timothy. They hung their jackets on the rack before stopping as they saw their new guests.
"It wasn't real, it wasn't real," Atlas chanted. "I want to say I want my dads but that's selfish, let them sleep, let them sleep." She paused and looked up at Mycroft who shared the same look. "Did I...?" She asked. "I said that aloud didn't I?"
"Your alright," John said as he saw Atlas sitting opposite her dad, Isla on a stool as they poured over case file after case file. "Well, not alright but awake. That's good."
Next Atlas saw that John was moved, she began the build up melody for the pre-chorus - hitting a few wrong notes on the small device but John didn't seem to notice.
"The wedding." Sherlock finished as he shared a look with John. They had now passed down a few alleys and reached a neighbouring park, entering the dim lit area.
"It is," Atlas said indignantly before looking at Sammy with a frown. "I'm suddenly feeling a little iffy."
"How can you know that?" Faye asked, her blue eyes wide from the other side of the room.
"Do you want a muffin?" Atlas asked Rosie who nodded as she handed one to her.
"Thank you, Mrs Hudson." Sherlock said politely causing herself and John to share a look with each other.
"I'm tired." Rosie said, clambering onto his knee.
"She had a nightmare," Mycroft smiled, sitting back down in the chair pulled do the bed.
"John," Sherlock said again, looking at him.
"Sure." Sammy smiled, feeling at home in the older man's prescence. Sherlock and John had been like the dad's he didn't have.
"Okay." Sherlock said. "I'll help you up." His voice was plain, simple and practiced, like he knew what he was going to say, the meter was measured. Gentle hands slid around her back and pulled her to him in the darkness. Her whole body physically sighed in relief as she sagged against him.
"This must be your devil spawn. So you can't be a virgin. Thought you were gay though, must be an accident." He joked gesturing to Atlas, who smirked at him, like she knew what do to next. "Just like your father eh?"
ONCE everyone had settled down in the living room in preparation for the queen's speech, Atlas pulled Mrs Hudson to the side.
Yes, we're excited.
"Very well," Atlas grinned.
"Stupid. Stupid. I told her not to go." John said into the phone before he hung up and got to his feet, slung on his shoes and hopped into the fabia. Making his way down the road he was begining to boil. Atlas had gone against his word and had gone and done something so stupid. He warned her, he told her she shouldn't go. He was so mad. How stupid? He was going to tell her off, make his point incredibly clear. Why had she gone against his word? Was it not good enough for her?
"Rosie..." Sherlock began but stopped himself, before looking over to the other side of the room. "Rosie claims she doesn't like them."
"No-one knows," Atlas explained, jumping in as she saw her dad and John faltering on how to answer. "Maybe it's a coping system. When your young it's things your afraid are going to happen. When your older, it's things that have happened, or what may happen as a consequence." Atlas explained, Rosie smiling through her tear stained face at Atlas.
"I need your help with something," He informed.
"This is what I mean, Sherlock, you can deduce a body but you can't tell what the hell I'm trying to tell you!" John shouted at Sherlock.
"You should get the flour, legs." Atlas said to Sammy, who smirked before he walked over to a cupboard, pointed before opening when Atlas gave a nod.
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
"Atlas, I'm not going to lie to you. I'm scared too. But I'm scared
"Sherlock." John said, through his own tears, coming over to him. Sherlock's breathing began to speed up and spiral out of control. The older man's fingers snuck around Sherlock's wrist and closed to take his pulse. Speedy. Just like his breathing. "Sherlock."
"You did. And I'm proud of you." Sherlock smiled before engulfing her in a hug.
"Up here," They heard Eurus say from downstairs as two ambulance men came up.
"I just keep seeing her lying there, her neck broken and twisted. And I'm there reading everything that happened to her." Atlas said. "And I don't want to know. I sometimes hate being able to read people."
"I know," Harry smiled. "But she's a fighter. She'll be okay. Bad memories huh?"
nice. "Aside from the pain, are you ok?"
"Is the dog from me aswell?" Rosie asked before her large blue eyes stared up Atlas' own. Atlas nodded in reply before furrowing her brows in response. She wondered how Rosie had figured out before dropping the thought, she was always knowing of things.
"Does she still have the other ones?" Eddie asked quietly.
"Oh papa." Atlas said quietly. "Your not a wuss. No one can do what you've done and be a wuss."
"Afraid so," John sighed as he looked at Sammy, wrapped an arm around his tall shoulders and pulled him into his side. "We can't wake her up but I do think we should wait and see if she wakes up, cause if she does she'll need us. Okay?"
"She said not to ring you but I had to. Sherlock, Atlas is going into surgery." Eurus said quietly.
But I'm weird. ✌
"I should probably stay," John insisted.
"The wind." Atlas said gravelly.
"You like those ones?" John asked, Rosie nodding once as Sherlock gave a little chuckle. The christmas tree would be delivered tomorrow, therefore they would need to make sure they had something to decorate it with. The bauble stall held all sorts of colour that at any other time of the year would create an eye sore.
"Get away from me!" She screeched, tears streaming down her face as she looked around the darkened room. The lightbulb flickered and she could smell mould...the type that grows in underground windows. She winced as she stepped on the pain of a broken ankle that never did heal properly. "You...it's...stop, don't hurt them! Your killing them! Your killing them you bastards! Fuck off! Leave me alone!" She was manic now, distraught by whatever was going on and John could only watch as doctors tried to wrestle her into bed. "You fucking bastards!"
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
"I can't sit up."
"Yeah!" She exclaimed before she wriggled and ran over, sitting on the floor as the dog came and sat next to her. Eventually lying down.
"Can I-Will you?" Atlas asked and although it wasn't an actual question he knew what she was asking and got to his feet, toed off his shoes and hopped under the covers. She put her head against his shoulder and an arm over his stomach. "Dad?"
"I know." Sherlock said looking over to John again. "But I know one thing, I'm happier for it."
"No," Atlas said latching back onto him.
"Thank you." Mrs Pertwee said harshly, standing. Atlas glanced around the room again before coming to the realisation that Mrs Pertwee was infact one of the head of years for Lower Sixth. Oh, that explains the office. "Are you a Holmes?"
"Yeah." Atlas sighed as Sherlock continued to plait her hair, tugging gently as he tucked the strands over, round and down.
"Sort of. That and I didn't want to end up with dad all day." Atlas laughed, John joining her as he pulled a packet of just-add-water porridge from the cupboard. Her face screwed up as he poured hot water from the kettle into the porridge.
And also quick disclaimer! I'm aware that most foster homes and adoption placements are not like this!
"MUM, stay on the phone to me." John said into the phone as Sherlock tapped his fingers anxiously on the steering wheel. Pride overwhelmed John as he looked over to Sherlock who had gotten out of bed and come with him without a berating word and who, was now placing a hand on his knee and rubbing with his thumb.
"Yep," Sherlock frowned before kissing her temple before cuddling her. "So does CPTSD. But we love you and everyone is here. Look, look at your army. Anyone will speak to you. Pick your person, they'll listen."
"Occasional psychopath." Eurus said quietly, still content with the chess game she was playing with herself.
"Hello dear." Mrs Hudson smiled, the cat still hugged to her chest. "I'm coming up."
"Yeah." Atlas smiled.
It was a while before anyone spoke again, Rosie dozing in Isla's lap.
"I know, duck," Sherlock said, rubbing her knee.
"Oh, Harry?" Atlas asked with a gentle smile.
"I did." Sherlock laughed as he flipped the tea towel over his shoulder.
Meanwhile, the laughter in the kitchen had masked the crash for all except Sherlock who's decision to live at high tension meant he heard her. He heard a thump and slowly excused himself.
He thought of her playing duets with Sherlock, the songs she wrote becoming the melody's of her heart. The way she waltzed round the room with Rosie at christmas, the lights in the background. How funny she was and how much of a brilliant mind she had. How quick she was to pick things up, to love. And oh how she loved people. Another sob came out his throat as he just clutched at her cheek, a tear falling onto her blue face. "I'm sorry. I'm sorry." He choked, thinking of all the times again and more. Books & Beans.
Atlas stuttered a nod before leaning against John, sticky with blood. "And I feel gross and disgusting."
"SO we're here to give you a little update on your treatment." Dr Young said, coming in with Dr Aduba in tow who effectively countered Dr Young's terseness. Atlas wriggled to a seated position. "So, while FND has people who recover and there are some success stories, we think that for you, we are best to approach your diagnosis from the view of management. As we believe you are at an increased chance of going through a relapse more than just a few times. We also do not want to rush." She paused. "We want to continue to put you though some strengthening therapy for your leg muscles. And we want you to have regular sessions with a mental therapist."
"Better. Getting better." Sammy said quietly, looking over Timothy.
On another note, I can't find a place to end this book. Its a while until it can easily conclude and at least ten chapters until I can pull it all together.
"I can't do it," Atlas frowned as John just sat there before he spotted Redbeard walking around.
"I'm just thinking," Sammy mumbled as he watched the bubbles rise from the base of the glass. "I have to clear out the house, sell it as it's mine, figure out the money, I just, there's a lot I have to do and I don't know how to do any of it." He swallowed and looked at the glass.
John gave a small laugh to that. "But this is Atlas. I don't know...if Sherlock's dead...I don't know if I can handle her."
Sherlock shook his head before lying back against the pillow, John leaning on his elbow, rubbing his chest with gentle fingers.
"Th-thank you." Atlas stuttered looking at Dr Young.
"I did," Harry smiled gently.
"It's not important." Sherlock said, brushing it off.
"It's yours." Atlas laughed from her position leaning against the desk. Sherlock gave her a blank stare, almost as if he had re-written his memory. "You gave it to me when I was little." Momentarily she paused, anxiety building in her stomach as she thought about adding the next bit. "Before you left." However she didn't seem to frown, she seemed to smile in some sort of gratifying understanding. Sherlock glanced back at her returning the smile before he put the instrument back down. John watched the interaction along with Mrs Hudson, not daring to say a word for fear of interrupting.
"Atlas," John said putting an arm around her shoulder.
"Who?"
"It's not important because it's in the past!" Sherlock shouted back at her. John was obviously going to have to be the peace keeper in the shouting match that was about to ensue.
"I'll get Red." Atlas chirped from the backseat.
"Och, look at that," Jo said walking in as Atlas kissed Redbeard's head.
"Alright. Bring her over and me and John will take her over to the hospital this evening." Sherlock said quietly before hanging up the phone and turning to look at John. "Eurus is bringing Rosie over."
"Sammy's nice." Sherlock said, Atlas nodding as she watched whatever movie it was with them.
"Most of our family are," Peter sighed resting his head on the window before sitting up right. "Nice to meet you, Sherlock."
Now he was faced with a dilemma. To tell Atlas or not to tell Atlas. Tell Sherlock? He'd have to. Especially because they'd agreed to being open from now on. It's also not something that Atlas could deduce before it would happen. Sighing he sat back in his chair as he pulled up the timetabling on his computer. He looked at the photo he had on his desk. The new one. One of them all on Christmas, at Wanda and Timothy's. Atlas was stood at John's side, his arm hugging her shoulder, Rosie looking sleepily at the camera from where she was held up on Sherlock's hip - the green of Jeff just seen. They were all smiling.
WARNING: Vomit.
"Alright," Sammy said, persuaded.
"We believe that she pinned Mrs Pertwee up against the wall, arm behind her back." Mrs Frobisher sighed.
"Until we need to call an ambulance." John replied looking to his sister.
"Who?"
"I know." John admitted just as Mrs Hudson came up the stairs to make three cups of tea. She silently applauded them before making some cups of tea for them all. "I always assumed her last name was Holmes. But is it? What actually is her name?" John queried the question playing on his mind furiously.
"Shhh. Shhh. We'll worry about that later. For now," John said and he sounded so convinced right up until his voice broke. "For now, you have to focus on getting better. On fighting. Please. So that you can, when your old and grey in a nursing home having lived a wonderful life, you can confidently say I was your dad. Please. Please fight so that I can say you were my daughter and nobody can ever say you aren't. So you can be at my bedside when I die and so that you and Rosie and Sammy's one day if he let's me put his name down on my will-" Sammy's head shot up. "Can be in charge of what I leave and can make my decisions for me if I can't."
"In that case," John smiled before he looked over the banister. "Atlas!" The girls head shot up. "Do you have a moment to come and play?"
Eurus walked over and leant down and shook the older man gently and when he awoke he looked surprised. Then, after some time, his eyes softened.
"Atlas?" He all but exclaimed after the fright he'd recieved, dropping infront of her. "What's happened? Are you hurt? Are you-?" John asked, running his hands over her shoulders anxiously. "Come on, your safe. Your safe, Atlas. You can take your hands away. Your safe. Listen to my voice, it's John...it's papa and I'm telling you, your safe, love." His hands rubbed her shoulders as Sherlock appeared, his blue weighted blanket wrapped around his shoulders. Gently, he sat down on the floor and shuffled over next to her. Slowly, with the help of John, he wrapped the blanket around her shoulders before himself and John exchanged a look.
"Alright?" She asked walking towards him and sitting down next to him.
"Are we going up the stairs or?" John asked Sherlock who, for a change, understood what he was being asked.
"Of course," Isla said before Sherlock stood, bringing John with him. The older man continued to hide his face in embarrassment before he looked up and faced them.
Carefully, she unravelled her legs and moved to sit next to him, wrapping her arms around his torso.
"Botswana. India. Democratic Republic of Congo. Egypt. Portugal." She whispered before stopping and looking at Sherlock. He smiled at her before he looked at some more of the photos, this time more closely, before realising upon something. He saw the knife recurring through each picture before glancing at Rosie who was prodding various countries on the printed map.
"Do you want to come downstairs?" Mycroft asked as Atlas shook her head and began to panic. "Okay, shhh, Atlas. It's alright." He paused. "Do you want your dads?
"Because he was going around pinching girls...well...you know where...and I brought it up to him and he didn't stop so I punched him," Sammy said quietly. "The Scottish government are looking to police that too."
"Yeah, sweetheart?" He asked with a smile before she tilted her head at him.
"I don't know." Atlas said quietly. "It's as if someone is about to commit suicide or about to die and they are transported back in time to when they lost a loved one and is talking about what it was like." Atlas sighed. "At least, that's where my head was when I wrote it." She looked over to John and smiled before putting down her phone and lurching towards John. She squeezed her arms around his shoulders and he smiled before burying his head in her shoulder.
"I just wanted a hug from you," Atlas whispered. "Your comfortable. Not fat. Comfortable. I love you."
"Of who's got it worse." Sherlock said quickly.
"Oh Atlas!" He shouted and the he was greeted with her head popping over the banister. "Mycroft and Co. are coming by tommorow morning."
"Biscuit, please, daddy," Rosie whispered.
"Good morning!" Rosie said as she lifted up some greasy hands, exclaiming in weird excitement. Completely comfortable with the woman she, at last count, was incredibly wary off. "Your the nice one!"
"I'm putting you in charge of something
"I don't want to loose it," Sherlock whispered, slowly shutting his eyes.
"You had another one," Rosie said quietly before putting both hands on the bed and attempting to climb but when she couldn't quite get up, Sammy lifted her instead. "Thank you, Sam." She then wriggled under the covers next to Atlas. "Atlas?"
"He's autistic," Ruth said flatly.
Forty minutes after the class began and she was standing up in the classroom explaining meter.
"It's not epilepsy. It's what I've had the whole time." Atlas sighed before she looked at Mycroft. "It's stupid."
"Not really Ro." Sherlock frowned. "Not really."
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
"No problem," Atlas said, and while she was feeling generous she hugged Harry too.
"Pass me your coat, papa," Atlas said to John as she held out a hand to him and he handed her his coat. She tucked it down to her right and he smiled at his mum.
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
"Oh Mycroft. How lovely to see you here." Mrs Hudson said sarcastically as she made her way past the eldest sibling.
"John." Mycroft said as he entered the kitchen, his face painted with concern. "Something's going on with Atlas." John looked at him confused before his face flickered in realisation and he put down the tea towel he picked up. Then he followed Mycroft through to the living room where Atlas was sat looking straight ahead, her eyes devoid of emotion. She'd been reading with Rosie, who had since gotten up and moved away from Atlas just in case. Rosie had been warned about these moments that Atlas experienced.
"Oh god, I love you," John said, leaning up to kiss his cheek fondly.
"It's alright," John said quietly. "I know. I know."
"Suicide or intentional murder?" Atlas asked going back over to the breakfast bar.
Halfway through, Eurus snaked an arm around Atlas' shoulder and rubbed it gently. With a hidden smile, Atlas rubbed her nose against Eurus' shoulder.
"Thank you daddy." Rosie giggled hugging the small dinosaur to her chest.
"Pa." Atlas replied sternly. "You are the joint greatest man I know - the other obviously being dad-"
Atlas shook her head to that. No, she didn't want to talk. Not really.
"SO, Dr Aduba," Atlas said some seven days later. "When can I go home?"
"No, papa, you should go bac-" Atlas started.
"Yeah," Atlas smiled. "Your like the best."
"Yeah," Atlas whispered.
"Mrs H."
"It's alright, I figured you'd say that." Sherlock said as he gave a small chuckle, Atlas looking at him confused. "I'm just warming John up to the idea of you not going." He said. "I mean, by law you don't have to anyway." Atlas nodded, before giving a little smile.
"I'll sit on the floor," Sammy smiled. "I'm young enough and we can get some cushions." He went over to Rosie. "We can have a little den Rosie."
He enveloped her in a hug, his arms wrapping around her tightly. "Its alright to be afraid."
"Someone sent them to me," Eurus smirked. "I do take comissions you know."
"It is." Sammy interrupted. "It's my home. And you guys are my family and John and Sherlock are my dads." And then he put a hand over his mouth like he'd said something wrong.
"Who's who?" John said as Sherlock looked at him as if it was blatantly obvious.
John looked to Atlas and exchanged a smile.
"Sherlock," John said coming over and putting his hand on his husband's shoulder.
"Oh, that reminds me," John said with a smile, picking Rosie up and plopping her down on the sofa before he disappeared upstairs.
"Predictable," Atlas huffed before she looked at him. "Dad, don't let the fact your autistic get you down. I love you and Rosie loves you and Rebeard loves you but most importantly John loved you no matter what. Okay?"
"O-okay," Sammy stuttered.
"I am trying," Atlas complained as her right hand began to shake ever so slightly. A tremor so small that when her other hand began to also shake, no-one noticed. Or at least, no-one noticed until she removed her hands from her head and she looked at her dad. "I want to stop."
"Don't seem so surprised, I dress drag queens when I'm at home in Glasgow," Peter sighed.
"I shouted at them to go away," Atlas sighed into the mask.
"Can I help?" Rosie asked looking up at John with matching blue eyes.
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
ATLAS had been staying with John and Sherlock for a few days when she saw another dead body. This time she had to do the same thing, only she managed to get there faster. Her mind was racing as she approached the side of the second body, her stomach lurching at the sight.
"Double barrel, check me," Atlas smiled before Sammy giggled too.
Good!
"Yeah," Atlas smiled before she looked back at the phone. "I need more sleep I think. Dad said they might be worse today because we were up watching the northern lights last night. Though, that wasn't too long for me actually."
"I was going to pop out and see if we can get some takeaway food from the Tesco just around the corner," John smiled, as Rosie looked up at him. "Are you wanting to come with me Rosie?"
"Love ya," Harry smiled, kissing his hair like he was a child.
"Excuse me." Atlas said moving past him to get some pasta, realising that they still needed some.
"I know." John said reaching out a hand and squeezing her shoulder. "Can I hear the one your working on?" Atlas' face flickered and registered multiple emotions.
"Are you trying to start a conversation?" Atlas asked with a smirk as they started to climb.
"You nor Sherlock have ever explained how you ended up in Scotland."
"Of course," Sherlock smiled before he left.
For so long the young girl had been shuffled from one home to the next, never quite being given what she needed. Now, many puzzle piece's missing she hoped that this would make a change.
"I think so," Sherlock said. "But you were smiley too as a baby. When I unwrapped your swaddle your eyes and your smile." Lost in a moment of reminiscence he only found himself again when Atlas shuffled against him. "And now look at you. All grown up. No longer a baby but a young woman now. Beautiful. A beautiful young woman. Don't let anyone take you down yeah? No women. No men. Especially not men. And if you ever need anything I am always one phone call away."
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
"Let me guess," Mycroft said. "One of those days."
"Atlas," Sherlock tried, his voice hoarse. "You don't have to be afraid, not anymore. It wasn't real. Breathe. Your okay. Breathe with me. In through your nose, come on."
"Couldn't sleep," Atlas smiled. "My hand's also locked but thankfully I'm ambidextrous." She had a heat pad on her wrist to try relax it but it wasn't doing much.
"Ok, Atlas." Sherlock whispered quietly.
"Go to sleep sweetheart." John whispered as he stroked her hair.
"Why don't you want to be on the call?" Wanda asked looking over to her.
"Thank you," Sammy said quietly.
"Alright," Atlas said, wiggling her toes as Sherlock got up.
"Sweetheart," Sherlock grinned at her. "I have never been mad at you when things like this have happened. I never was. And I never will be. And not only for this. Me and papa, no matter what it is will always be able to help. Both of you," Sherlock put a hand to Sammy's knee too. "Now I know we go away in two days and you'd probably rather you were packing and getting ready, but anything. Truly, anything, from if your somewhere and your drunk and you need picking up, if your in trouble. If you just need to talk, either of us or both of us, will come and see you. Okay?"
"Nipped home." Sherlock said, as he leaned forward and kissed her forehead.
"Bring Lewis here," John smiled.
"I wuv you daddy," Rosie smiled.
"Closed cases?" Isla asked with a smile.
"We don't go for four days, John," Sherlock moaned as he put down his fiddle.
"She was the instigator." Atlas whisper shouted in return. "Why do you care anyway?"
"Lovely to see you Wanda." John said as he recieved a hug from the woman.
"Your husband and daughter." Atlas said quietly, looking up at her. Mrs Pertwee looked at her fiercely, before dropping the look. It was impossible to be recognised in this attire and get up.
"I'm here." John said quietly, knowing that right now Sammy just needed someone to sit with him. "Where's your mum?"
"Ha ha. Very funny." Atlas smirked. "Yes. After meeting my dad for the first time in seven years I told him I'd be there if he wanted to speak."
"Of course," John smiled.
"Are so."
It wasn't until ten minutes later that Sherlock walked into the lab to see Atlas in goggles, lab coat, hair tied back and gloves on, dropping a pipette full of liquid into a solution.
"Sammy! Sammy!" Rosie squealed as she got to her feet and ran over to him. He squatted down to take her hug. "I'm sorry about your sister."
Sherlock sighed. "I did inform the head of the facility I would be bringing my daughter."
"I love you too, lovebug," John smiled before Sherlock came over and kissed John before offering a hug to Isla who took it and then to Harry and then to Jo.
John laughed at that before sniffing again before going to the sink and washing his face. However, Sherlock wasn't finished and wrapped his arms around John's chest and pressed his chest against his back.
"You keep him right, Sam, love," John said with a smirk as Sammy nodded and put his arm around Sherlock's waist, the parent placing his around his son's shoulder.
"Sherlock is currently...well...your not going to be able to get him. So I am the next best thing." Atlas said trying to sound braver than she was admittedly feeling.
"JOHN?" Sammy asked coming into the living room, a smile crawling onto his face as he saw the man sitting with his husband in the living room.
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
"I don't..." John said, pausing as his throat became choked up. "I don't think I do." Sherlock looked up at him with his maddening blue eyes before smiling lightly, John returning the smile.
"Your more of an animal whisperer than me." Atlas said before she watched her dad pick up the cat.
"Of course," He smiled as Atlas frowned at him.
"Oh," Atlas said, blushing at being caught out. "Your not mad...are you?"
"No, I know," Sammy said with a small smile. "You love her and I do too and I know what this feels like." He paused. "I know what you feel like."
"We definitely will," John said rubbing Atlas' shoulder again as she looked up.
Sherlock sat back and watched as the nurse strapped Atlas' arm, tapped and pushed the needle in. The sickening noise of the tap, brought the poisoning home.
"Why don't I have a mummy?" A pause, her thinking face on. "Why doesn't Atlas have a mummy?"
"You look glum," John said as she looked at him.
After the meal they sat down round a coffee table in the living area to play a quiz board game. Atlas had pre arranged names in a hat, whoever's name was drawn that was who was their partner.
"Morning." Atlas chirped smiling before putting butter on her toast.
"We're not going anywhere unless the spare tyre is on the boot and it's not because we had a flat two weeks ago." Atlas sighed as she looked at her dad. "We've got a flat."
IT wasn't a long drive to Sherlock's parents house, but it would be due to traffic. You can't imagine somewhere to be busy on Christmas Eve, shoppers piling into every shop on the high street. Then you haven't met the British, unorganised to the point where last minute shopping is swiftly creeping into fashion and last minute deals are certainly not a strange set of affairs.
"Mrs Hudson!" Atlas mockingly shouted, lifting her mask off her face, a chuckle lying underneath. Mrs Hudson gave a smile at the wide eyed teen.
They continued to select a gentle turquoise for the upstairs bathroom before Atlas caught the attention of an employee. He was called Matt, had three dogs that were short and fluffy and black - most likely west highland terriers, a girlfriend who had brought one of the three dogs, they were living together out of town etc, etc. Atlas got bored before he'd even fully approached them.
"If you promise not to misbehave you can stay." Sherlock warned as Eurus nodded her head in reply. Sherlock stood, looking around slightly.
"No. No, nothing like that. He just is. Social issues, that's all." John said, his mind pursuing another very probable idea.
"I slept very well, thank you, sweetheart," Sherlock smiled up at her. "I love you."
"Right here," John whispered.
"Your thinking of moving?" She asked quietly, looking up with him. He nodded once before he pulled up a tab of the first house. "Have you told pa?"
"Don't suppose you'd like to go on a shopping trip with me?" Sammy asked looking at Atlas. "Only, I'm in dire need of some new clothes that are my style. And you seem like the perfect person to help me assert it. So whaddya think?"
"She wasn't saying anything." Abayomi protested, before shrinking with a glare from Atlas. Her eyes said
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
"S'alright," Atlas whispered as Sherlock smiled at her from where he was seated next to John.
"Your dad had a nightmare." There was a pause of discomfort in his voice. "About me and the morgue. But anyway..." he sighed. "Stop dodging my question."
"What?" John asked. "The nightmares?" Sherlock nodded. "It depends how well the therapy works."
"No your alright," Harry said. "It wasn't good but it wasn't bad either."
filled the room as Atlas began to walk away.
"Sherlock-" John started, only to be interrupted by Sherlock again.
"Shhh, shhh, okay, okay." Wanda soothed placing a hand to her back and rubbing, removing the pack of cereal from Atlas' hand. "Don't stress about that. I'm sure that if you wanted them to come home, they'd come home."
"Sherlock. You need to breathe." John whispered quietly his hand gently rubbing on Sherlock's knee.
JOHN opened his lunchbox and frowned. Inside, was a perfectly wrapped brown bread sandwich which was filled with lettuce, mayonnaise and haloumi. Next to it, a strawberry yogurt with a spoon perfectly sandwiched between the specially sought out tub of mixed fruit that had been thoughtfully covered in a sprinkling of lemon juice.
And a
"Oh Atlas." Sherlock sobbed. "What's happened to you?" He kissed her forehead and closed his eyes as the tears fell.
"And watched me die." Sherlock whispered regretfully, his eyes shining with tears. "You battled all that too." John just nodded before they hugged under the covers and John kissed Sherlocks forehead. "I could never have done all of that without you."
"We'll leave you in peace and if your no better in the morning, we'll ring the doctors," Wanda said before they disappeared.
don't want you to either." Sherlock smiled before he hugged John again. "We can go in a minute. I just need another hug."
"No," John sighed. "But thank you, my darling."
Putting them to one side to rise, they laid the table and Sherlock put the red wine out.
"I always wear my bow, nana," Rosie grinned before Mrs Hudson smiled at her.
"I understand that what you did today was because of trauma but we are going to issue you to therapy so you can return to resume your studies next year." Mrs Frobisher said, Atlas feeling the worst she had ever felt and she looked like she was going to cry. Looking over to her parents they saw it too, and then she saw Mrs Pertwee. She'd won, or so she thought.
"Don't speak, just try to breathe. I'm here."
Sammy nodded and followed Sherlock into the entryway of the small semi-detatched. Sherlock rubbed his feet and looked into the small house.
In the bathroom, he found himself staring at his reflection and complexion that was pasty. Gripping onto the edge of the sink he took a deep breath, in through his nose and out through his mouth. But it wasn't working and he heard John knocking on the door. The
"Your lucky I'm not washing the mugs Sherlock Holmes." Atlas scolded before leaving the two men to speak. That is if John could bring himself to bring up what he had been meaning to mention for a whole month.
"Papa," Atlas said in response turning her head to look.
"But not before breakfast," Mycroft smiled before the four of them got to their feet. Swooping up Rosie she giggled. "Now, Rosamund, me and Aunty Eurus brought croissants with us from the bakery. Would you care for one?"
"Alright dear." Mrs Hudson smiled putting the cat down which resumed her place on the bottom step.
"Good job," John smirked as he put down his book. "Cause I married you and 'cause I'm in love with you too."  He wiggled his fingers and with a grin in Sherlock's hands as the younger man stretched and put his feet against John's shin. "God, Sherlock! Your feet are bloody freezing!" And in reaction, the older man pulled his legs away.
"Who is Mrs Pertwee?" Sherlock asked, Mrs Frobisher sighing as if it were plainly obvious.
Atlas blinked repetitively before slowly moving her head and looking up.
"Yeah," Atlas smiled as he lay back down next to her and gave her an ear of his headphones.
"It's really early, we should probably go to sleep," John muttered to her.
"You two are hopeless," Jo laughed from the other side of the fire pit. "Look at those faces." She smiled as John and Sherlock looked at her bemused. "Your always so worried about doing right by one another that you never realise that you want the same thing." They both looked blank. "You want to live here, you want to have bees and make bread and I don't know, have space for grandchildren and walk and see what there is. Scotland is home for you both and you haven't realised it."
"It is you." She confirmed and Sherlock nodded. "How late is it?"
"And it wasn't," Mycroft finished as Atlas stuttered a nod. "And you've also had enough of death and danger for a little while and you weren't ready for more just yet?"
"No, he's good at showing very little emotion. But Rosie trusts him, so he's past that test." Sherlock laughed before linking arms with John. They get to the stall and stop at the end of the queue. It was long, but they knew the wait wouldn't be too bad.
"Mine." Rosie squinted before John gave a small sigh.
Mycroft joined Atlas in putting on an apron and washing his hands before he made his way over to the counter.
"Ah." She said quickly, looking at him. Carefully she wiped at her eyes before looking over to John.
"Pa." Atlas whined before smirking. She rolled her eyes. "Yeah. What do we need?"
"Your so like your dad sometimes." John smirked as he thought about his husband. Where was he right now? Was he alive?
"Rosie," Sherlock said sternly. "We don't say that."
"We'll buy you a new one. A better one." Sherlock sighed before Atlas sat at his side and deflated. "Okay? I'm not mad because I'm not allowed to be."
"Mhmm?" He asked, looking down at her.
"Atlas, are you awake?" John asked before he walked to her when she nodded as her chest gave way to a huge sob. "Sweetheart."
Sherlock huffed slightly as her speech began and Wanda shot him a look as if to say 'shut up'. Atlas rested her head against his legs and Wanda smiled upon recognition of the scene.
"John?" Sherlock asked from the door, toothbrush still in his mouth.
Enjoy!
"That would be quite funny I suppose, yes." John laughed before he hugged her again a gentle hand to the side of her face.
"Touché," Atlas whispered back before John got to his feet and went upstairs.
"No." Sherlock whispered. "I think he knows but I've never..."
Atlas laughed before scrolling through her contacts to find Mycroft.
"You know, dad," Atlas said.
"Oh Sherlock." John whispered very quietly, pulling his chair closer and slipping an arm round his shoulder. Sherlock looked at him afraid, and then it was there. The electricity he felt everytime he saw John, thought about kissing him or any romantic affection. Little did he know, John was eager to reciprocate yet Sherlock looked away before either could make any semblance of a move.
"He's...uhh...well." Atlas began before looking at Lestrade. There was no easy way to say what she needed to. "He's lost about three months of his memory."
YES MY PEOPLE! I QUOTED GREY'S ANATOMY.
"Atlas-" John tried.
"She used to get hit, Sherlock. For anything, everything. Speaking, deducing." Mycroft said to his younger brother, who looked very sad.
"How are you so good with words, papa?" Atlas grinned.
"Of course you can." Sherlock smiled.
"I got some new gold ones...which have engravings on the insides." John smiled as she looked at him. "They say 'Dinner?'"
"Wh-what?" John asked quietly, looking at his husband.
JOHN was sitting stroking back her hair and looking at her when he remembered.
"Okay." Atlas said eagerly.
"That's good, love." Came John's voice, soft and gentle.
"Where are we going to?" Atlas asked as her new found 'friend' who she didn't believe would last long led her round some paths and onto what she believed were the outskirts of the city. There he led her round the back of a fence before they both vaulted it easily.
"Alright."
"Sherlock!" John shouted angrily, the younger man turning to look at him. The crowds around them looking momentarily before rejoining their conversations. "Enough."
"Sherlock."
"No," John said quietly. "But she's still my baby. She's still so small and young and full of life and everyday it gets harder and harder like this darkness suppressing in the light that flows inside her being." He looked up at them. "And it's hard to watch." And then his face screwed up and he put his face in his hands. "I'm sorry." He drew in a shaky breath and covered his eyes, elbows resting on his knees.
"Yes," Atlas said before she began to sit up. "Look, I can probably walk out to the ambulance. I'm starting to feel way better."
"Yeah." Sammy sighed as Sherlock rubbed his shoulder. "Thank you."
"No, leave them...they're busy...they went through hell tonight," Atlas said as she gathered herself together.
"Me!?" Rosie squealed as Atlas nodded. Sherlock could be heard laughing as they continued along the road.
"Thank you. I would hug you but you know." Atlas laughed, gesturing to her bloody tissues.
When the seizure stopped, Damien quickly got to work on neatly matching the skin together with medical glue and tape, John peeling back Atlas' hair as she sat up his front.
She hiccupped again, her tears now coming in a fast, steady flow.
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
"I'll get help." Rosie said quietly as Atlas let out another whimper.
Mrs Hudson was rather chuffed with herself as she looked at the table. She'd managed to clean it up quite nicely and get it to look slightly better than it originally had. When Atlas had queried her in the morning about cooking for John and Sherlock, Mrs Hudson replied that they often ate out. Atlas then - as a mark of gratitude - invited the woman to join them that evening with their meal.
"I'll walk it'll only take 15 minutes, max." Atlas replied before gathering her ingredients into her rucksack satchel bag. She grabbed her red coat that was long and stopped just at the back of the knee, perfect to avoid the winter chill. It bared resemblance to Sherlock's and was wearing a pair of red high tops. Then she chucked on her satchel and left the house, a note being left on the table.
"Your never lost for words." John laughed, and then his eyes caught Sherlock's and he held the other's man gaze for a moment.
"Soph, look," Peter said. "John was always good to us when we were kids."
"No, no continue."
"Yeah, okay," Atlas sighed. "Shit-"
"Dubai." Atlas replied shortly, continuing to type up her essay on the conviction of Joachim Peiper in WW2.
"Unfortunately." She replied.
"So, me and Sherlock have some news." John said from where he was sitting on the bed. "As of today, Atlas is..." He paused not quite able to believe that it was true. "Well, she's my daughter...but we all know that...but the difference is that it's official." John smiled as Atlas shuffled to lie properly against him, an arm over his stomach.
But, on another note.
"And we'll be here to help you if something happens." Mrs Hudson added. "Alright?"
"Seizures? Do you know where you are when these...flashes happen?" John asked quietly.
"You should say." Eurus supplied helpfully. "Tell the doctors that you think they have the wrong diagnosis."
"And they were good I'm guessing?" Atlas asked quietly, smiling as she looked around.
"Is she alright?" John asked, Sherlock nodding.
"No, your not." John sighed putting his small, yet strong hands over Sherlock's ears, thumbs resting on his cheeks. "But
"Sophie." The boy said before the girl caught it and thought a moment.
"It's 10:23." Sherlock said walking into the kitchen, John coming in a moment or two later with two empty mugs.
"Thank you." Atlas whispered.
"I love you too," Rosie said before letting go of his hand and running back over to John, latching onto his hand. "Daddy!"
Sammy nodded once before glancing around the room. His eyes went to the yellow smiley, the bullet holes, the skull on the fireplace, the tidied experiments on top of the kitchen cupboards, the case files on the desk, the piano, the knife on the mantelpiece before back on Sherlock Holmes himself.
"I think Sherlock's going to like you." Atlas said giving the dog a chin rub before Mrs Hudson joined her. They both agreed, John and Rosie were going to like him aswell.
"What're we at?" John asked Sherlock, who frowned.
So did John.
"Her?" The other doctor asked, John pinching the bridge of his nose.
"They are." He said almost sadly. She didn't need to ask why he had the album, she could already deduce that one, she'd kept Whisper.
"Okay," Atlas smiled. "I'll go. I'm a girl. You and dad continue and I'll take Sam. Judging by the measurements I've just approximately taken, Sam's might fit."
"Forever and always." John whispered into her hair.
"My?" Rosie asked looking up at him.
"A strad," Atlas completed. "They are rarer than the Strad violins of which two are in our possession, dad's and Eurus'."
Now she could see the body and it wasn't as bad as she initially thought it was going to be, yet she squeezed John's hand tighter.
"You know, the rucksack was all I had and the violin and piano had been in a storage unit ever since a foster home with a nice man who gave me his in his will." Atlas explained to her dad as best she could.
And there you have it. The highest form of apology ever uttered by a Holmes. Admitting the other is right is something every Holmes would struggle with, whether they admit it, or not.
"She's my baby," Sherlock said quietly before feeling the outside of his coat pocket. "Oh, Whisper." He nestled the toy in the crook of Atlas' arm and they waited. "I love you." And then he turned his head to John. "I love you."
"Hey," Sherlock said with a smile, his hand going to her forehead. She opened her mouth to speak but he shushed her. "Shhh, don't speak, sweetheart." He paused. "Are you in pain?"
"Dad?" He asked confused.
"You were a single parent from the day I was born, dad," Atlas frowned. "Your one of my favourite people. Of course my bond with you is strong."
"Alright?" Sherlock asked her. "Atlas, look at me. Are you alright?" His hands were clamped either side of her face.
"Your shoulder aches when your stressed." Sherlock said, lifting his head slightly. "I have it all under control. And besides I have Atlas to help me out, we've found one we really like. It's all going OK. I promise. I can do it."
"She's okay," Sherlock blubbered.
"I really...really thought you weren't
"What mess have they got themselves into this time?" Timothy sighed punching the bridge of his nose. They knew better than to intervene.
"Yep, I did it not long before you came down," Atlas smiled. "And thank you for getting me the box too, I call it an old person's medication box but in reality, it's for anyone who needs it and it's really helpful."
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
"She's Atlas," Sammy said quietly as he rubbed at his eyes.
"Sammy?" Sherlock asked quickly.
The first one missed Kirsty, the other going straight into her chest and she crumpled.
John gave a little smile before resting his temple against Sherlock's shoulder. Atlas' eyes began to close and soon enough she entered a gentle sleep.
And in that door that Atlas had seen, leading from the kitchen was a huge work space - it had to be the size of all the bedrooms put together. She'd been told by Sherlock Sherlock they weren't going in there today - it was going to be a
"You don't have to lie about it, love," John said.
(Patient coughs and holds her arm to her stomach.)
"Your telling me," Sammy sighed as Sherlock's hand was placed to the boy's back gently rubbing.
The oldest Holmes child frowned at him in confusion.
"You have so little faith in me, John Watson." Sherlock laughed before John added.
Quite cute fluff. Enjoy!
"I was going to say, my uncle Mycroft, but the family plus our landlady - who's really an additional grandmother at this point - call him the government." Atlas laughed as they linked arms and tracked down the pavement. Her violin hanging in her hand. As they arrived at Mycroft's they knocked on the huge door before entering.
"Can we go for some fly?" Atlas asked as they approached a coffee shop further down the street.
"Of course," John smiled before pulling her into his arms. She rested her chin on his shoulder.
Mycroft finally appeared from his room and Eurus from outside with Red. She'd been playing fetch with him and had now taken him inside. Everyone was quiet.
"Thank you by the way Ro." Atlas said looking over to her, she nodded before looking over to her family members who looked as if they were trying to figure it out. She knew everyone wanted her to speak so she searched desperately for a way out when her eyes fell on the three violins.
"Thank you." John smiled, sounding less exhausted than Sherlock.
"School. We're talking about it." John declared, Atlas rolling her eyes as she continued reading her book.
"How did she die?" Rosie asked again. Smart kid. "You said she was ill, what happened?"
"What're you two-"
"I love you too," Atlas grinned back.
"I thought papa was going to tell you that I'd gone back to bed," The teenager mumbled from under the covers, the duvet pulled up over her head. "That it's the medication."
I don't edit.
"Five things you can see," Mycroft said.
"Ok." Atlas replied.
"Time for bed Rosie." John said to Rosie as she looked at him after giving a big yawn.
"Mycroft!" Atlas said aloud before repeating it louder. "Mycroft!"
"Dad," Atlas said again, Sherlock stroking her cheeks with his thumbs.
"I'm really sorry Ro." Atlas said looking into her eyes.
"GO away Rosie!" Atlas screamed at the five year old who had come in again that evening. Normally, she would be welcoming, allow the younger child in. But this page of work. The little pieces torn infront of her. She'd worked so hard on it and Mrs Pertwee had just said it was a disgrace. Called her in privately period 3 and spoken to her. Told her to rip it up. No witnesses. Rosie stood by the door, quiet. Atlas' eyes softened at the sight of her, though turmoil still boiled in her blood.
"It didn't all go bad," Atlas smiled. "Look at what we've got now, dad. We're in the best place we've ever been. I have two dad's, two siblings, a dog, a
"I'm sorry too," John said. "Im also tired and it hurts to watch it happening to her. You think that it's something you can get used to but it's not."
"Wanda, you didn't have to." John said as he took a seat next to Sammy, who gave a tired smile.
"I want to protect you." John Sr growled, his wife nodding her head in agreement. John had been friends with Sherlock long enough however to know when someone was lying.
"Oh, sweetheart," Mycroft said. "Somethings upsetting you. What is it?"
"Okay." Atlas said before she creeped into her marginally bare room and slipped into some clothes and collected her red long coat on her way to the living room.
John had thought, until he came to the horrifying conclusion that Atlas had had a nightmare about her mother.
The phone rang.
"Sally." Atlas finished for her. The woman looked at her confused before giving a slight nod.
"I know." Atlas whined. "But it feels like years. That's how much I
"Yeah. But then I got PTSD..." Atlas frowned.
with so much disgust that it made John give a quiet snort.
After passing miles of flat, inhabitated land, they opened for a while before plunging into row upon row of oak and pine woodland. Sammy smiled before pulling into a forestry car park.
"No, no, Atlas, listen to me," John said and she looked at him as he brushed the hair out of her eyes. "You don't have to be. Don't pressure yourself into those things. Don't make yourself feel like you have to be better. It's okay to not be okay. And it's okay to need a bit of help. And it's okay to show emotion."
"I love you too," John said back with a smile before sighing as Sherlock kissed each cheek in turn, making him giggle. "Oh, love, you are wonderful."
"A diplodocus," Atlas said again with a big wide smile.
"Sherlock, love, let me in," John said, stopping from his knocking. "Sherlock."
"Do I have to wear a kilt?" John whined.
"I just wanted to tell you that, Eddie was great. He was lovely to me and dad and kind and generous," Atlas said with a smile and John frowned. Her face then dropped and she looked at her lap. "But...he's not you. No-one is you, ever will be you. You make me feel so safe and happy," Atlas smiled. "I saw your face. Papa, no-one can compare to you, except for dad. But even then, you are still different."
The jug fell with a smash, right beside her head, shards flying in all directions. There was no reason for her fit right now but all that didn't matter as glass came to settle all over the lab floor.
"I do too." Atlas said pretending to be dog as she dropped her voice.
"Definately," Atlas said as they finally got to the bus stop they required. "Papa?" She asked once they'd stopped. "When do me and Sam have to go back to school?"
"If you sure?" Sherlock asked and Sammy nodded.
"It is," John choked as they began to play through a section of call and response.
"I've been fine. You know what it's like. Here. There. Everywhere." Sherlock replied trying his best to sound as normal of a human being as normal.
If any of the lyrics through this is used for an actual song that you write, then please just don't. I actually wrote these songs, the lyrics mean a hell of a lot to me because I'm going through (hopefully the last of) a long line of shit. Lockdown is not bothering me. And nor is Coronavirus. I have just lost a lot in a very short period of time, and my songs are my emotions and how I describe it.
"John," Sherlock said again as John just whispered to him, grounding him in the present. "Thank you."
"Where's your dad?" Greg asked as the four year old sat and turned angled her head to look at him. She cocked her head slightly, the dog who had decided to lie next to her doing the same.
"Don't," Atlas said as he pulled away. "If it's a bug, I don't want yo-"
"Miss Watson-Holmes, your case is developing, we need to hav-" The doctor said touching her arm, his white beard reflecting.
"YOU can go back to bed." John said getting up the morning to be faced with a tired eyed teenager with messy hair.
mind," John whispered. "You deserve better than that."
This was
"Lunch?" Atlas asked as she collapsed into the chair, slumping.
"Uncle Mycroft." Atlas whimpered, leaning into Mycroft again.
"Right. Shall we head to our favourite spot with this stuff?" Sammy translated for Xerxes as he gathered some bags of things to put at their private memorial for Aba.
SHE was awake, sweating and feeling the most nauseous she had ever been during a migraine. Slowly, she got onto two wobbly feet and made her way to the bathroom. Sitting down by the toilet she lay her head against the tiles as her head pounded. She wanted to cry. She wanted her dads.
"Got it!" Atlas exclaimed as they began to cross the road, the people around them looking at them. Confused.
"Sherlock." John said furtively.
"Thank you," Atlas smiled. "Thank you." She said again pulling away, she collected the flowers and handed her dad the caffeine. "It was nice to see you."
No idea if this has more ideas off of Instagram as well so if there is, credit where needed!
"I haven't finished my packing yet," Atlas said with a smirk.
"Yup," Sherlock sighed with a smirk. "Alright, I know that already."
"Sherlock," John said again, this time pushing his weight against the door but when it didn't open he tried the handle. Only to find it wasn't locked. He opened it slowly and entered, kneeling in front of Sherlock. "Oh Sherlock, you okay." He placed his hands either side of Sherlock's face and rubbed with his thumbs. "Look at me."
"Atlas?" Sherlock asked, making his way into Mrs Hudson's living room. Atlas, having told Mrs Hudson what had happened looked at her.
"How old is Atlas?" Jo asked.
"Yes," John said back to her. "I know, I know it's difficult."
"You've all had a hard day. Maybe you should all go home and get some rest." Mr Fraggerty said before looking over to the head teacher.
"I can't," Atlas whispered. "It's too much."
"Aye," John said with a smile and they giggled.
It was the blood curdling scream that made John look back to Atlas who was sitting bolt upright in bed breathing too fast, eyes wide, pupils blown, chest tight and her left leg bouncing under the duvet. Her mouth was forming a speed of incoherent mumbling that was evidently an ongoing part of whatever was going on in her mind.
"You were shot?" He questioned, Atlas sighing. Not quite how she wanted to start her day out with her new friend. She slowly lifted the shirt she was wearing to reveal the scar from her bullet wound before pulling it back down.
"Yeah?"
It's short. Sorry.
SAMMY, Rosie, John and Sherlock all found themselves in different places that afternoon. Sammy had a trumpet and saxophone lesson - from the same teacher, an hour of each - which took up two hours of his afternoon; Rosie and John were out at the park meeting up with Sophia Thorpe, one of Rosie's new friends; and Sherlock was busy working through paperwork that had finally caught up on him at New Scotland Yard.
Sherlock gave a hiccup his breathing speeding up and Mrs Hudson frowning.
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
"I know." Atlas smiled as she looked out the window at the passing traffic. "They like you. If you ever need to asking them something guy based, honestly, just ask them. And I mean, it helps that your all gay." Atlas gave a little chuckle at that and so did Sammy.
"Yeah. Really early. That's like over a whole two months. And when I was born, the cord was wrapped round my neck. Dad said something about me not breathing for ages. Although, that probably felt longer because he was...well...being a dad." Atlas smiled. "I was also too cold so they had to lay me on a heating pad with blankets over the top of me or something. He has a photo of me. In the weird incubation cot things." Atlas giggled. "I was in for ages. With the heart murmur and all that. Didn't have a seizure till I was about one and a half. I think Dad worried, still does. In the first few weeks, they monitored me in hospital because I was ill and I think I had a touch of jaundice too. And dad was scared because he blamed himself, said it was his fault because he should have kept a better eye on my mother, should have stopped her from having so much sex. He blamed
The younger man shuffled in his seat before looking over. "Sorry, please continue."
"Because your my niece and I'll care an awful lot and continue to care through your hard times. I'm giving you a hug because sources provide evidence that it can soothe people when they are feeling sad or down." Mycroft said looking away before he looked down at her. "Is that right?"
"Her chart does reference PTSD," The man said. "But no CPTSD."
"The makeup you've got on today is good. It's a good colour match for your eyes."
"Does it get better?" She asked as they walked over to the door.
"Atlas," Wanda said in return.
"I'm not crying because of what you said, sweetheart," Sherlock smiled looking at her. "I just needed a moment to balance everything. I was just-"
"Because you just did one of the kindest things I have ever witnessed," Sammy said with a bright smile.
"Let her in Sherlock. You know fine well she's not a client. If she was a client I would have said 'Sherlock! You have another one.' But did I say that?" Mrs Hudson said somewhat sassily. Her hands drawing to her waist, here eyes meeting Sherlock's beaten look. "No. I didn't think I had."
Later Sherlock repayed the debt to Mrs Hudson whilst she was stuck in her marriage. Sherlock put himself on the line to try and charge her husband, try and catch him out. He did so, charged on both drug selling and abuse. Currently he is serving jail time and isn't due out for quite sometime. Atlas scared herself by this analysis, all the pieces and things she'd seen suddenly coming together into one big pile that made sense.
"Well done Rosebud," Atlas smiled before pushing her hair out of her eyes.
"Yes, but, well, I want to be prepared," John said before he left the music landing and disappeared into his bedroom. And Atlas gave Sherlock a look as if to say
"The world," Atlas said and Rosie nodded knowingly.
"Please," Sherlock nodded with a weak smile. "Do you want me to stay here or in the car?"
"Please," Sammy whispered around a lump in his throat.
"Shhh, shhh, shhh." Mycroft whispered as he continued to hold her and rub her back. "My little Ida."
"No! I like Harry. She's like Aunty Eurus."
"I'm not a softie." Sherlock scoffed.
"I just want to go home, go back to normal. Go on - on adventures." Atlas said with a frown, throwing out a breath. "Go out with friends, see Redbeard." Her parents just listened. "I just want to go home."
"What did Mary-Anne do to Atlas?" John asked quietly and Sherlock just shook his head.
"Ida Atlas Elizabeth Holmes. But people call me just Atlas." Atlas said taking the hand and shaking it.
"No but's," John scolded, glaring at her. "No but's, alright? Since when did it matter if people did or didn't like you?"
"Not always. It differs from person to person. Is that something else that's troubling you?"
"Thank you," Sherlock smiled before he moved away to allow John to introduce her to the others.
"It's alright, love," John said quietly.
"But there's something different between mother and daughter," John said with a quirk of the eyebrow.
"No," Sherlock said, shaking his head lightly.
"January 5th." He answered Atlas giving a little smile.
"What pressure? Cause I married the wrong person. And it kills me to say it, but I married the wrong person. And that man..." John looked over to Sherlock. "Is one of the greatest men I know. In fact he may even be the best."
"Yes." Molly smiled. "I'm pregnant."
"WHAT'S wrong John?" Sherlock asked as he made his way into the bathroom and leaned against the counter. Hands perched on the sides. John's face was etched in an unfamiliar worry as his hands were poised over his stomach.
"Same way as yours is Mrs Pertwee." Atlas smirked, deducing the woman's marital status. "Gifted from my father."
Sherlock looked at her gently. "It's alright, sweetheart." He reached out a hand and placed it on her knee. "Do I need to get out?"
"Take care on the stairs dear!"
"Oh, okay." Atlas said hopping off her counter and going upstairs. When she got in her new room she saw an A4 cardboard box on her bed. Walking over, she picked up the box and opened it up. Her eyes stung and went blurry as she saw what it was.
"Papa." Atlas replied. "If that's ok? I don't - I really don't want someone I don't know touching me."
"Nice to meet you." Atlas said, producing a hand, smiling. Although her face faltered midway through John Sr's handshake.
"Daddy!" Rosie shouted at him, giggling.
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
"John." Sammy cried on the other side of the line, his finger nails bitten down to the quicks.
She didn't push it by sending another message and instead followed her father out the gate and started to walk along the pavement.
"Well...I...I put ice in. Like I'd seen dad do before. But he nor papa had put ice in theirs the night before, just water. They normally put it away but I think they were pretty drunk by the time they got to bed. They're jovial drunks." Atlas laughed. "So I was poisoned by the whisky which was poisoned by the ice. Papa and dad had just finished a case and they normally celebrate with some whisky so someone who knew the case was closing must've - must've done it or - or something. I don't know."
As they neared a river Rosie and Wanda walked forward, ahead of Sherlock and Atlas. Sherlock had let Redbeard off the lead and he was now running with Rosie and playing in the river.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I'll leave soon," Mrs Hudson frowned before she kissed his cheek. "Sherlock, you listen to me. This is not your fault. We love you all so much so don't be so sad."
I'm not a doctor.
IT was the 27th of December and Atlas was panicking. She'd managed for so long to make her own concoction of pills to keep her condition at bay. But now? Now she was scared. She'd run out of the two boxes of over the counter medication and she panicked. This wasn't good. She knew she wouldn't be able to get anymore. Lestrade was currently speaking to John and she'd just been to see Sherlock who was in Rosie's room helping her tidy up. All this panicking was making her throat dry so she hustled to the kitchen and gathered a glass of water.
"Uhm, Sherlock," Sammy whispered as the other man stayed at the bottom of the stairs. "Can you come with me?"
"Sorry?" Wanda asked looking at her granddaughter expectantly.
"I'll help you." Sherlock whispered. "They're my family now too." He rubbed his hand over John's back.
"Sherlock. Jesus. It's okay." John said the younger man still looking at the floor. "You - You look like I'm about-" Then before he could utter the words from his mouth on what he was going to say, he realised. "Oh shit. Oh Sherlock."
"Yes." Sherlock answered for change shuffling in his seat uncomfortably. He understood why all these years he had preferred children and animals to humans. They were less likely to judge him - unless they were John. Suppose that's why it came as a surprise the first day that Sherlock had a full day to look after Rosie.
to the table a moment later.
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
They played lots and lots of the game, getting through the disposal of three bodies before they got bored and decided that they wanted to watch a programme. Quietly they argued before Atlas managed to persuade her dad into watching some episodes of "Glee." Just as it approached three AM Atlas giggled a little too loudly at the cringe of a one Rachel Berry ⭐ and John began to stir on the couch. Sherlock paused the episode before looking down to Atlas then back over to John who was now peering through the darkness.
"I'm scared, dad." Atlas frowned as she looked up at her dad.
"I don't want to ruin it because we're going to have fun and-and-and it'll be nice-"
"Papi," Rosie whispered before she climbed into his lap, put her legs either side of his lap and lay up the front of it, like she had with Sherlock many times before. Her temple against his chest, his hand resting reassuringly on her back.
"Mary! My mother was called Mary too!" Rosie exclaimed, Sherlock giving a fond little smile before looking up to John.
"Sammy!" Rosie then squealed as she saw him and he lifted her up and held her.
And that Abayomi was dead.
"Your not my dad...or papa....or anyone I know." Atlas said quietly.
She walked over to Sammy with her arms outstretched and she put her hands on his cheek.
AFTER Lestrade had appeared everyone sat in the living area. John sat on a chair by the desk, Rosie on his lap. Sherlock sat in his chair, Atlas leaving against his leg and the front of the arm. Mrs Hudson sat in what was normally John's chair, Lestrade, Mycroft, Timothy, Andrew and Molly hanging around over her shoulder. Wanda was sat in the chair that Atlas would usually lay claim to that had been positioned next to John's - similar in style.
"John," Sherlock started. "It's alright. If you want to loose weight I'll support that but you don't have to worry about it either. It's alright."
"No. I think I'll take a walk home. It's not far." Atlas lied knowing that there was more to the case than met the eye. She also knew that there was more than one mind who had plotted the murder, they just had to find them. She'd sent the police to go looking for the adult, but she now had to go looking for the kid. Or, she should say all the kids. The shooter was a human trafficker and she assumed that the person had shot the victim due to them knowing the truth about their plans.
"Okay I ask first." Atlas said as she pulled the measuring scales out from a cupboard. "Why do you like baking so much?"
"What's wrong Ro?" Sherlock asked, before Atlas looked at him with icy blue eyes.
"Don't talk like that," Sherlock giggled before tucking a piece of hair behind her ear. "Now, I think the doctors might be annoyed if your out of bed for too long."
"Speaking of Rosie, I wonder where she is today?" Atlas said, understanding fine well she was behind John's chair. Out of view of herself and Sammy. "You can put your guitar over there. We aren't meeting the rest of my estranged family until half eleven." Sammy gave a nod before the dark haired girl complied in Rosie's game before finding her. She let out a squeal and ran to John, hugging his legs. Sammy followed her into the kitchen, smiling.
I don't know at this point. Probably all the chapters have something in it but imma go ahead and say this now. This is the Sherlock fandom, you can expect a lot of triggers but I will try to mention them when I identify them.
"I know it still hurts." Sherlock said looking down at her. She stood to look at him.
"You are a dick and you were being a dick." John laughed. "But you were not the one to blame."
"Okay. I want...to be...an astronomer musician consulting detective." Atlas said in precise words, and Sherlock gave a little giggle. "Its true. Although, maybe not the astronomer part...I think that and the other things is too much...but I want to be a musician."
you. And I wish I did." Atlas said, somehow welling up with unshed tears. "Dad, you should say something."
"Do I?" Isla smiled. "I pear my dialect back a wee bit when everyone's here so that your siblings and uncle can understand me. I know you and your dads can but I don't like to be rude."
She asked with her eyes.
"So not...not good?" Sherlock asked looking to John expectantly.
"Sorry, I just-"
"No, I always thought
"Both of them have thought for near on...well actually...I don't know. Years. That the other was never going to return their feelings." Greg laughed, hopping out of the car as the Enterprise rental van came into view.
Newra.
"Shall we play Slow Seasons?" Atlas asked referencing the duet they had just finished the other day. She looked at her dad expectantly as she awaited an answer, however, he nodded giving her the conclusion.
"My wrist is aching quite a bit so, no, not really," John smiled. "I'm hoping Atlas is going to sleep alright."
"Which colour does Rosie prefer? Purple or pink?" Uncle Mycroft asked.
"Atlas. I told him to go away. That's what you said I should do, because boys are a waste of time." Rosie giggled before frowning and looking back to Sammy again. Sherlock and John watched on before crossing round the edge of the bed to pull themselves some seats in next to Sammy and Rosie. John again, put out a comforting hand to Sammy's back and rubbed gently. Rosie climbed off Sammy's lap and climbed into Sherlock's lap.
"Bye." Atlas croaked.
"Exactly, papa," Atlas giggled.
"In and out," Atlas said with her breaths.
"I'm fine. Yeah, I think I'm fine." John said smiling at the man he had grown to love.
"These are your other grandparents Rosie." Sherlock smiled, dropping a small hint to his mother and to John's parents that himself and John might just be an item now. Atlas had figured it out the night before and told Mrs Hudson, who then told Rosie. However, Mrs Hudson had left that morning, Atlas wasn't here and Rosie didn't speak to strangers or people she was uncomfortable with.
"If only more people thought like that." John said before making his way into the kitchen. "Maybe we wouldn't all have been shot barring Rosie and the dog."
"And knock them out if they call you the banned word." Sherlock laughed before John cut in.
"I know this is difficult for you all, but can we maybe give us some room to work?" The male ambulance man asked and they all moved away, Sammy taking Rosie to his and Atlas' room, beckoning for the dog to follow.
Atlas.
"Oh Sherlock," John whispered as he put his hand in his curls. "I'm sorry I hit you that time."
"Okayyyyou'rereereerereur okay," John said looking at him softly. "Breath, Sherlock, take some deep breaths."
"I'm an army doctor." John said quickly, sniffing the way he does when he is pissed off. "And a reaction like that," He pointed to the computer screen. "Is normal in situations of trauma."
And the world kept moving around the family, despite all four of them plus Sammy, wanting the world to just
"Thank you." Atlas said quietly, squeezing slightly as she spoke. She drew back and looked at him. "I hate to say."
"I'm scared," Rosie whispered.
ATLAS and Sherlock returned from the new house on Saturday early to sort out a few things back at 221B. Tommorow, they were showing John and Rosie the new house, but right now Atlas needed a nap. John had left a sticky note just in case on the fridge saying he'd gone to buy milk and take Rosie to the park. Immediately in the door and Atlas was on the sofa, wrapped in a blanket and asleep. Out of it. Sherlock smiled before going over to his seat and selecting a book to read, settling on one about Afghanistan he'd seen both John and Atlas read - it was also one of the few books that hadn't yet been moved over to Rosewood Cottage.
"Just giving you a hug," Atlas said before she followed John over to the little cafe.
"She would have been conscious." Sherlock said again.
"Biology, English Literature and Art." Abayomi smiled before looking over to them. "You guys?"
After Mary-Anne, her thoughts began to shift to her time in care. She'd spent a lot of time thinking about this.
There was a pause of silence. "Sorry." Atlas said quietly, John coming to the realisation that she didn't mean to offend him. Or hurt him. Neither her nor her father ever did. They never meant to, they almost always had the best interests in mind. He rubbed her arm and pulled her back against him.
"Let's."
"Your my person." Atlas said as she looked at Sammy with a kind smile.
"Yeah," Sherlock plied. "Dragon House! It's really awesome, isn't it?"
No meal they had eaten, had ever been better.
Rosie and Mycroft's room began to fill with water, slowly but surely rising up and up and up. Sherlock and Eurus gave each other a look as John stood hunched over and defeated. His hands placed firmly on his knees as he let out a shaky breath. Briefly he looked up to see Sherlock looking a little beaten too, but not as much as he was sure he did.
"I've got quite a lot of pain today," Atlas said quietly.
XERXES mother was blue eyed, dark skinned and dark haired as she was beckoned on.
"Okay, okay, your alright." Wanda soothed as they lay her down, Mycroft collecting her glasses.
"Sherlock."
Jo heard the singing from upstairs and she smiled to herself from the en suite. They sounded happy, her
"It'll be okay. He'll get found." Mrs Hudson said against John's ear.
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
"Dad." Atlas said rolling over to look at her father.
"ATLAS." Sherlock whispered into her bedroom. It was two o'clock in the morning. "Atlas." Her head raised momentarily from pillow, before she huffed and dropped it back down. For a moment she considered telling her dad to
"She's...Good," Harry said.
"John." Sherlock said looking at him through the glass. "You need to do the same on the join at your side." John removed his coat, leaving him in just his shirt and thumped the glass before there was a crackle. The water was now sitting on Mycroft's chin.
"John, I didn't me-" Sherlock began but he was cut off by an anger rising John. The younger man had little fight in him to retaliate.
"No. No, Georgia's fate is sealed. Atlas's isn't." Sammy frowned before instinctively leaning back against John. As John continued to hug him.
"Yes, good girl, in and out," Mycroft said. "Deeper, pull it from your stomach."
"John?" Sherlock asked before he kneeled by John and rested his chin on his knee like he had done before. John just looked at him with a simple expression.
"For what?" John huffed. "You say thank you an awful lot."
"We do but not a great variety, but we do have fresh mint in the garden if you'd like some fresh mint tea?" Sherlock smiled.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Who are they?" Atlas asked, noting that Elizabeth Buchanan was 24 when she died and Robert 19.
"Here is a present for you. I hope you enjoy. It took me some time to paint and get it right, but I really hope you like this painting. Eurus kiss kiss." Sherlock read aloud before they looked at the painting.
"Nice to meet you Mr Holmes." Atlas said presenting her hand for what felt like the fifteenth time this week. The man seemed taken aback but shook it gladly.
"Yeah," Sherlock nodded before he pulled John's arm away from holding the book and held it to his chest, the older man's hand encapsulated within his. "I'm in love with you, John."
"Did you like her?" Sherlock questioned, John rubbing his chest again.
"Uhh...yes." Sherlock said, only after finishing the tweet he was in the middle of writing. Then he looked up and met eyes with Atlas who was assessing him in her normal way. "It's a good melody. Is there more to it?"
"And then...this morning whilst we went to the grave and I had a flashback but...this time it was longer," Atlas said quietly. "And Dad had to get a hold of me." She looked down at his jumper with sad eyes.
"Dipdocus," Rosie said again as Atlas smiled.
"Yes. And I'm going to force you to listen to me. You are the most human human I have ever met and you have the biggest heart." John laughed before Sherlock gave one of his proper smiles. One of those ones that lit up the darkest of rooms and the darkest of moments. That was contagious and only made John smile in return.
"Just a little overwhelming, yeah?" John said quietly before she pulled out of her dads hug and looked at him before she tilted her head up and looked at the ceiling obsessively. They waited, patiently, before she blinked a few times and looked at John and Sherlock in turn.
IT was 10am on Boxing Day when Sherlock stood and smoothed down his shirt.
"You will be supervised." Mycroft finally spoke as a guard entered the room. Clearly he was supervision. "I will also be with you." Sherlock and Atlas shared a knowing look before reverting their eyes back to Mycroft. Then whilst Atlas stood looking around the room, analysing much about the man who had just walked into the room, Mycroft moved over to Sherlock. "Do you not think this is a bit soon?"
"And if we train him right, he could also provide deep pressure therapy," John added. "I think you've just at had a very good idea, Mr Watson-Holmes."
"We'll try her on a different type of medication and I'll put it down in her medical history that this type makes her sick," Dr Khris said, nodding before exiting.
"Why?" Rosie asked against and John just held her to his chest.
"This isn't a bloody murder investigation." Sherlock snarled, John reaching out a hand and putting it comfortingly on his leg.
"We both need to go." John said. He sounded worried. "She's being suspended."
"Oh, I'm sorry," Sherlock frowned.
"I'll give you a lift." John said as he picked up his satchel. "We'll leave in fifteen." He said as he went over to the desk to get his laptop.
"I-" Atlas sobbed as Mycroft, surprisingly kneeled by her feet.
"How's things?" Jo asked John who smiled at her.
"I thought it was." Atlas smiled as she looked out the window too, imagining she was back on the coast again.
"I'll go get him." Sherlock said darting back to the house and finding Jeff. He looked at him momentarily before returning to his crying daughter and placing him in her hands.
"You and daddy are always going on about them. Only you guys call it an ost-, osk-, ora-."
"Dad will come home papa." Atlas whispered before John rolled onto his side and put his hand to her hair. Gently, he brushed it out of her face and ran his fingers through her curls.
"You guys aren't..." Sammy said, his hands waving around as he tried to find a word. They were not like Sherlock or Mycroft anf that confused him. "I'm trying to find the right words without offending either party."
Rosie asking more questions.
sure." Atlas put a reassuring hand on top of his, it resting lightly on Rosie's back.
"I don't know why this is so much harder than any other....deaths....but it is and I can't stop feeling sick when I think about it and so-" Atlas sobbed.
"Hey, hey," Sherlock said quietly looking back at her. She sighed loudly as she shut her eyes in exhaustion.
"Duh," Atlas said as the lift began to move.
"Whisky." Atlas replied sharply. "It came from the whisky."
"Atlas?" Mrs Hudson said coming out of her kitchen and into the hallway. "Deary me." She sighed upon seeing the girl. "I heard you and John having an argument last night." The woman looked tired before she filled Atlas in on what she was doing that night. "Up watching late night telly."
"Hello, my love," Jo said as Rosie woke up and Sherlock put her down on the floor.
"Alright, but check their 3 for £10 sale," John smiled as he watched Sammy head for the records selection. Rosie followed John up the stairs towards the sheet music and latched onto his hand as they entered the little, long rectangular room. It had been ages since he'd been in a music shop and he smiled as his eyes grazed over the pages of music.
Don't hate my opinions. I struggle to get what I mean across.
"Dad?" Atlas asked, looking at him.
"What is it Sherlock?" John asked again.
"Yes," Atlas replied. "Papa's a doctor." She put a hand to his shoulder.
"Good morning Mr Holmes." He chirped, as he loosened his nervous grip in the handle of his guitar slightly.
In Atlas' room, Sherlock collected his daughter a comfortable pair of trousers, a long sleeved t-shirt, underwear and a cardigan and placed them neatly outside the bathroom door. The shower had turned off and so, he knocked lightly. "There's some clothes outside the door for you."
wanted Sussex," John said before they both giggled.
"Very true." John laughed before Atlas shuffled a little closer but remained individual.
She held up her A4 drawing of a pirate pig with one eye to him.
"Oh my, you are stupid sometimes dad." Atlas sighed sitting on a bar stool near the kitchen. "We need toilet roll, kitchen roll, soap and things like that. We don't keep them in stock back at 221B but we have the space here."
"I don't know," John said before there was a thoughtful pause. "But I do know that I don't regret a moment spent with Atlas."
Rosie bounded up to Wanda with outstretched arms, her bag bouncing on her back.
ATLAS went home two days later, thank god, and to everyone's delight, she was in a good bill of health. And, a week after that, found all five of them standing in a Craghoppers looking a mix of bemused and amused.
"I think I need to lie down," Atlas smiled before she lay down right next to his feet.
"You've got your cardigans out again!" Atlas exclaimed. "Hallelujah."
"Yeah. They won't mind if you stay, I mean if you want to, which you know that your always welcome at my house." Atlas smiled as they pulled out onto the main road through London.
"WHO in God's name knocks on my door at this-" Mycroft huffed as he walked to his door. He had been enjoying playing chess with Eurus when a knock on the door had prompted them to stop. He was on his guard - as, at this time of night, it truly could be anyone - and opened the door with caution. "Atlas?" He saw his niece standing on the step to his house with her best friend and he beckoned the pair inside.
"Alright then," Sherlock smiled. "Redbeard." He called. "Sit." The dog sat before he let him off and the dog bounded away along the path. Torch lights lit the just before sunrise light effectively as they ascended the hill.
"You. It's clear since I met you last night that you don't do emotion's or physical contact. But for some reason you do kids. Something is not adding up Sherlock Holmes." Atlas smirked as she looked at the man opposite her. She'd only known him properly (excluding the first seven years of her life, but that was a story for another day) for just over twelve hours yet she felt like she had known him for years. That's the thing with having the gift. You can trust too easily, too quickly.
"Yes," Atlas whimpered as John moved his arms. "Don't...please don't go."
"He always does," John said smiling as he glanced to the dog who was wagging his tail and turning in circles at the door. "Walk?"
No triggers.
"Nothing strange about that, love," John said as he walked next to her.
"Eh, no buts either miss," Sherlock scolded with a smirk before sitting down on the bed, John pulling up a chair.
"I am. Yeah, we have two other children, Rosie and Sammy together too," Sherlock beamed.
"Yep." Atlas said before continuing. "But the one that says 'new formula' because the old formula makes our heads and faces itch."
"I thought as much. We'll make you some soup yeah?" John smiled as Atlas looked at him with a little smile, before she looked up at Sammy.
"Yeah." Atlas said with a smile and as soon as the doctor was out the door she changed into a jumper. Gathering her trainers she pulled them on, then collected her blanket wrapped it around her shoulders and stood to her feet. Then she waited.
"She'll be good. Aunty Eurus likes animals."
"Even better," Atlas smirked.
"Ehh, well, yes...sort of." Eurus stammered through the phone as John looked down at Sherlock who was opening and closing for his fist in request for the phone.
"Atlas," Sherlock said and Atlas popped her head around the corner. "Hop in." He said tapping the boot.
"A diplodocus," Atlas said and Rosie turned around and held onto her fingers.
"She tried to smother Atlas in clothes. I came back in time. Looked after Atlas for a few years. Couldn't look after her, placed her in care. The end. No more discussion." Sherlock said frustrated, emphasising that this was clearly a touchy subject to himself.
"No." Atlas lied. Truth was it did hurt, when she woke in the night from a nightmare. She would lie, hand on her side stomach, her other hand clapped over her mouth to avoid waking people up from her whimpering. Did anyone know it brought pain? No, she hadn't
"William Sherlock Scott Holmes. I expected you to ring me." The lady hollered, whacking the man on the back in annoyance. Then her face softened, her tense posture relaxed and she approached Atlas.
"Sherlock is too, more so infact."
Atlas got to her feet and made her way back to Sherlock's room.
"I'll buy one." John said quickly.
A little while later Sherlock came in to see them all speaking to each other about something.
"Alright?" Sherlock asked, rubbing her cheek.
They continued along and, with a smile, sat down at a table whilst Sherlock and John popped in to collect some beverages and cake. When they reappeared it was with a variety of items but most importantly, a bottle of Irn Bru.
"'Course. Of course I will." John whispered. "I wouldn't leave you behind silly."
There was a pause of silence.
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
When Atlas woke up from her thoughtful trance she found the queen's speech to be coming to an end. She looked up to see Sherlock had fallen asleep, the only one to do so. So Atlas being the only person who knew she could get away with it tickled him under the knee. In that moment she knew she couldn't be anymore annoying. He jolted awake sending everyone else in the room into coils of laughter. He himself let out a little laugh before ruffling Atlas' hair as she gave him a look.
"Breath, Sherlock," John soothed before brushing his cheek again. "In and out." Sherlock reached out a hand and placed it on John's chest.
Well. Here you go.
"Picking Rosie up from school, then getting Sammy from his music teacher and then they're all coming here, so just me, for now, I'm afraid," John smiled.
"Papa," She asked. "What's for tea?"
"No, no," Atlas said, tears spilling over her eyelids, hanging off her eyelashes.
"Optimistic John," Atlas mumbled as he kept his arms around her. "I just want to go home."
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
THE clock came to beep precisely at 6:34am, the time she had chosen to set the night before. It changed every night, the numbers significant to mood as she swung her legs out. Sighing, she placed her feet on the ground and rose to her feet. She did everything she had to before going into the living room, typing into her phone.
"No, no, let me," Isla said, getting to her feet and going to the phone.
"I don't remember much of what happened before and after my seizure yesterday," Atlas said quietly. "I have about one image of the lights, but nothing else. I don't even know what I did the rest of the morning. I think I sat...and thought, but I don't know. I'm not sad, I'm just frustrated dad," Atlas said with a gentle smile before looking happier. "But, my medication is largely working which is a plus, the next step is just finding me the next step up of medication 'cause this one isn't doing enough."
"Once your finished," Atlas said. "Sammy and I need to chat to you and dad."
"One fiddle," John smiled as he handed Sherlock his case and the man smiled. "Don't get too stressed out if it doesn't all fit, alright love?"
"Edinburgh." Sherlock answered, Atlas burrowing into his chest. He stroked her hair before flipping the page. More photos of her, this time as toddler. The creak of the bedroom door made Atlas look up quickly, to see John walking in.
Atlas quickly scarpered to the kitchen putting the kettle on to make hot beverages for their announced guests. She hadn't taken her manuscript with her leaving it on her seat, the title being written on the top of the paper with the beginning tune for Piano and violin duet. The title was
"No, your not," Sherlock said very gently.
"Do you think he knows?" John whispered.
"Hello Eurus. Is everything alright?" John asked as Sherlock grumbled about something from where his head was still resting on his husband's lap, finger pushing the TV remote mute button.
"Yeah."
"This is where, what I call, the magic happens," John smiled as his husband smiled back at him.
"I think I'm going to go upstairs for a while," Atlas said getting to her feet and going up the stairs, Sammy's eyes tracking her. Before he got up and followed her.
"I know," Mycroft whispered.
"How're the rooms going to work? A-and money? And my car finance? And-and all that?" Sammy asked quickly.
"Soppy," Mycroft said and Atlas threw her head back and cackled. "I'm glad you find that amusing." Mycroft laughed with her. "You should probably catch some sleep."
"Have you lost your speech?" Sammy asked gently and Atlas opened her mouth to speak and ended up just nodding.
Atlas stopped what she was doing and looked up, her eyes met those of her grandparents and she smiled before lifting a tray with a teapot, milk, sugar and an assortment of cups into the living room. She placed it on the desk before turning around where she was standing to meet eyes with her grandparents.
