Sherlock stared at him. "Animals die every day, John."
The intense messages from his brain demanding him for more data on John made Sherlock leap at any chance he got to observe the man. John was just about to pull out of the car park when he ran his hands over his face and kept them there for a couple of minutes as his frame began to shake ever so slightly.
"John, I am not-"
John sighed. "How are you finding the class so far?"
Sherlock tightened his grip on the steering wheel, saying nothing and glancing over to John, his mouth pressed in a line. "Not good?" he asked, after a moment of unsuccessfully trying to gauge John's reaction to his chosen destination.
"Sherlock, really?" John sighed upon entering his classroom on a Wednesday morning. "Have some respect and tidy up after yourself please."
"For doing what? Your behaviour has been so much better lately"
"How very particular of you," Sherlock commented, sifting through the pile. "10:53 3rd of August 2009"
"Really?" John lead him over to the blue chairs in the corner, next to Mike Stamford.
Sherlock frowned, his words sounding slurred and far away. "I'm still brilliant."
"Well don't, it's annoying."
"I do apologise for the interruption. Did you find anything for your Mother's 63rd birthday?"
"Mycroft..." Greg paused. "That's your brother, right?"
"Let's go home." Sherlock said, his voice deep and quiet, introverted, despite the emotionless expression on his face once more.
"Yes." John nodded, his forehead scrunched up in a frown. "But I know now-"
"Boring" Sherlock stated, flipping over another page to make a point.
Pressed back against a wall of lockers, Sherlock sank deeper in his confusion of the enigma of this short man with his protective gaze over Sherlock.
"Now you sound like your brother." Greg snorted, earning a half-hearted glare from the elder Holmes brother. "Any progress?"
"No, Sherlock-" John sighed, planting his feet on the floor and moving past Sherlock to pull the blind across on his rectangular window next to the door, shoving the door wedge underneath the jamb.  He moved cautiously back over to the taller man, gripping the edges of his coat, moving his head into Sherlock's line of view where he was staring stubbornly at the floor.
"Yes. I was twenty-one at the time."
Sherlock felt the burn in his lungs and sucked the smoke in deeper, feeling lightheaded and swaying backwards against the wall. He held his breath until he felt dizzy and exhaled in a thin cloud of smoke, followed by a breathy sigh of exhaustion. He closed his eyes and wished he were with John.
John tried not to think too hard about the strong smell of aftershave and cigarette smoke missing from his classroom.
Greg wondered if this is what Sherlock's childhood was like, if Mycroft's childhood was like this too, the latter only echoing his father's behaviour with no idea how to function after being suddenly orphaned and left with the responsibility of another human at such a young age himself. Greg's heart suddenly ached for the pair of irritating sods.
He'd waited behind in the classroom for at least fifteen minutes, knowing even that was a push for Mr. punctual Holmes, to be more than 4 minutes behind schedule. Suspiciously locking the door behind him, he made for the exit, checking all smoking locations which Sherlock had absently mentioned to him before, including the corner they often 'ran into each other' on most days of the week.
Sherlock waved his hand in John's general direction. "Stupid."
"We are if we want to remain appropriate,
He must have looked comical to John, eyes blown wide with shock from his own words, damp hair drying into a frizzy and manic cloud, mouth making shapes of words without any sound escaping.
"He hasn't left the country." he said, sounding sure. "He won't have risked being caught in a location populated with such high security."
John felt as though he'd been abducted again, like the time he was held captive once for 42 hours in Afghanistan. For some reason, Dr Watson felt significantly more intimidated sitting across from a gingery haired man wearing a full three piece suit, thin chain hanging from the pocket of his waist coat, and clutching onto a hefty black and metal cane than he'd felt with a masked Arabian man standing across from him pointing an AK47 at his head.
They revelled in the quietness of the world at that precise moment, the sensation of feeling at home in such a rare moment of paused time. John felt immediately overwhelmed at the emotion brimming in his chest, only exaggerated by the gentleness of Sherlock's touches, the innocence of his slow and explorative hands.
"Uh- no. I haven't. I'll get on that."
"Sherlock-" he said softly, placing his hands either side of the student's head and managing to tilt his face back up. "It's just me."
"What- You have?"
John was the one who came first, grunting with exertion, one hand gripping the headboard above Sherlock, muscles straining as he held himself above his lover's flushed body, his other hand pressed solidly to Sherlock's chest as he worked his cock against sticky skin. Sherlock found himself coming just at the image of John above him, muscles glorious and tanned, face contorted in utter ecstasy as he worked Sherlock's cock against his own.
"You don't believe in God." John chuckled, smiling against his skin before Sherlock managed to flip them over, rolling the teacher onto his back. There was a brief pause as Sherlock sat back on his knees above his teacher, eyes roaming over John's torso, following the trail of hair that lead tantalisingly underneath the waistband of John's boxers and jeans.
with my signature, thank you very much. Get back here-"
John surprised himself at slipping his tongue into the velvet warmth of Sherlock's mouth, his own hands gripping the flesh of Sherlock's hips, pulling his shirt from the tightly belted trousers and pressing his warm palms against Sherlock's pale and untouched skin. Sherlock let out an embarrassing whine, allowing John's insistent lips move to his neck, his nose shoving Sherlock's jaw upwards so he could circle his tongue around Sherlock's adam's apple.
"An item? But...nothing ever happened--" he trailed off, thinking back to their behaviour around each other. He'd only managed to catch a few furtive glances that immediately sprung to the forefront of his memory, but apart from that, his brain was struggling to force the concept of the rumours actually being
The silence between them stretched on persistently, the crunch of gravel under their feet scraping minutely as their feet shuffled about.
"I-Sherlock?" John asked, and then visibly panics, turning straight back to Lestrade as if the public services teacher could read his thoughts.
Sherlock pressed his ear to the gap of the slightly ajar door, recognising the voice of a year twelve student named - Sebastian, was it?
The Holmeses exit via the main entrance and Sherlock purposefully hangs back as soon as they leave, shifting into the smoking area and fishing out a lighter from his coat pocket.
Sherlock let out what could only be described as a growl, as he stepped back out of the door, onto John's doorstep, reaching for a heavy stone from the assortment in John's neighbour's garden. He spun in a second, focused in on a CCTV camera turned towards them from the corner shop across the road from John's house, and launched the stone straight into the lens until sparks began to erupt and glass fell onto the pavement from the shattered lens.
Greg's face distorted into one of displeasure and shock at the reminder, "I know he spent time on the streets, but he never elaborated. I never knew the extent until you said before."
"What is?"
"Greg," Colin began cautiously, his lips pressed together as he looked at the clearly distressed man. "You're not on the force anymore, this is none of your concern."
"You're a public services teacher!" Sherlock complained, not keen on having his un-official guardian trailing around after him berating him every chance he gets.
John pulled away from the kiss with a soft smack of lips, not wanting to be interrupted for the second time that day; attentively smoothing down the collar of Sherlock's open-throated shirt and hoping desperately to whoever was up there that everything would turn out okay.
John turned back to Greg with a determined look in his eyes just before a roar of heat blasts glass from one of the large windows on the second floor, crackling with a hiss and a wave of heat.  John ignored the screams and continued to run.
"In that case-" Mycroft pulled a document out of the pocket of his suit jacket. "The man in this photograph must be your twin?"
"What exactly are you finding difficult?" Sherlock turned to face John, needing to understand.
"You don't have to change it for me- I'm getting used to classical actually. Makes me feel like I'm in a Spielberg movie."
"Right. Kevin. Anyway, he's an A grade tosser. Pretty sure he's had a sexual harassment complaint filed against him by one of the female Art teachers too. Always seemed like a pig to me."
The line buzzed a dead tone, mocking and continuous.
. "Of course he lives in fucking Belgravia."
He practically hung off your every word for God sake." He stood and paced the stretch of windows to the right side wall of the room, still ranting to himself.
He stabbed at the speed-dial number and took another drink waiting for the ringing to cut out.
John physically winced at the word. "Molested" he shook his head. "This is serious, Sherlock."
“Sherlock, oh my god.” He went further down his shaft and John had to bite his tongue to keep from crying out. His whole body felt hot as if there was fire running through his veins and controlling him; making him writhe in pleasure as Sherlock went up and down, applying just the right amount of pressure. He felt himself building up to his climax, and he knew that he needed to stop Sherlock before he came.
He thrust again, faster this time and shoved his mouth against Sherlock's; enjoying just how soft and full his lips were. John realized that this is what he had always wanted with Sherlock. He wanted to claim Sherlock as his own; be his master. He wanted to memorize every detail about Sherlock.
"God, Sherlock I'm so sorry. I didn't know. I would never have-"
"I don't know how you manage without it."
"Let me," he said in a low voice. Sherlock only closed his eyes and nodded, while biting his lip sexily. After John had taken care of Sherlock's pants, Sherlock reached over to do his. He moved hesitantly at first, but as soon as he saw John nod at him, his hesitations turned into quick, decisive movements.
"Hm? Oh yeah, it's fine." He lied. It was most definitely not fine. He wasn't sure if he could handle being so close to John with such few articles of clothing on.
“Sherlock, are you crying?” A voice brought him back to reality.
~.~.~.~.~
John made a choking sound and started laughing to cover it up, but Sherlock saw a hint of lust in his eyes. John carefully removed Sherlock’s coat and draped it over the chair. Sherlock started undoing his belt while John undid the buttons on his shirt. His fingers slipped a few times, due to the tomato soup, but eventually Sherlock was in nothing but his boxers. John stared at Sherlock’s chest and stomach and swallowed.
"No, it's okay. It's just... I don't think I'll have enough money. My parents died when I was young in a car crash and I was left with next to nothing."
He knew that Sherlock had every right to be angry with him for what he did, but he didn’t know how long it would last. What if Sherlock never forgave him? He felt a surge of panic run through him. Sherlock was all he had. The realization hit him like a ton of bricks and he crumpled to his knees right there on the sidewalk. Sherlock was the one who had been there for him when John was at his worst. Sherlock wasn’t the only one remembering tough times from the past that night.
"Humor me, Captain Watson. SH"
"That's
"You were snoring adorably."
"Great. Well, it's only 9:00. I think we could stay up, at least, another hour. What do you want to do?"
“Well, would you listen to that. We’re being kicked out by our own gay son and his lover. How utterly surprising. The shock therapy was a good idea. You should be thanking us for trying, Sherlock.” his mother spat. She stood and pulled her husband up with her.
"What?" John wasn't sure what he meant.
"Nope."
It had been 24 hours without John, and Sherlock felt like he was slowly spiraling into a dark, bottomless pit. His anger towards John was subsiding, and now he just missed him terribly. John hadn’t known what his parents had done to him. He really believed he could help. John always tried to help people no matter what the cost was. Sherlock was still irritated that John had gone through Sherlock’s stuff without his permission, but people make mistakes.
~.~.~.~.~
“Sherlock, we need to hide,
"We'll be back." His mum huffed indignantly and walked back to the car with her husband. The door was shut. Eyes were met shakily. Shallow breathing and heavy hearts filled the room.
Mycroft: Good. I'll be there.
"Tell them what, though?" Sherlock went back to his fire.
John: Sherlock and I are having a bit of a get-together tonight at 7 and we would love if you could come.
“Tell me, now!" He commanded again in a low, husky voice.
He was in so much pain; screaming out. He was screaming at his parents, at Mycroft, at anyone who would help him. Mycroft wasn’t there, but Sherlock knew he could get him out of there. He just kept yelling for his big brother. After weeks and weeks of “tests”, the doctor’s released Sherlock to his parents.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock started to lay down on the couch, but John grabbed his arm. “Oh no, you don’t. You are not getting messy food on our couch.”
“John it wasn’t your fault. It wasn’t anyone’s fault. Stop blaming yourself for everything. The cab made a sharp left and Sherlock was pushed into John. He moved himself a bit so that he was only leaning on John the smallest amount.
“I-I just can’t… You don’t understand.”
"Mr. and Mrs. Holmes, please have a seat," John said, keeping his hand firmly placed on his back. They entered the flat and took everything in. Sherlock could tell by the looks on their faces that they weren't impressed in the slightest. He could also tell that they were suppressing their rude remarks about how untidy and disorderly everything was. He had experiments that he had yet to finish on the kitchen table, and piles of books stacked virtually anywhere there was space.
“Why does it sound like you’re saying goodbye?” John’s heart skipped a beat. The cab stopped and without giving him an answer, Sherlock pulled away and took off running.
Everyone sat down in the living room. Sherlock's parents were on the sofa while the two of them sat in their usual chairs. It felt just like a case with the two of them talking to a client, but the tension in the room was much higher. The silence evidentially became too much for John, who broke it by saying: "So, er... how long has it been since you've seen Sherlock?" It was his mother who answered.
"Oh don't worry, they're always like that. They have a bit of a rivalry going on." He heard his friend Greg, who played viola, say with a chuckle.
"Welcome to orchestra class, John. We're happy to have you. If you want, you can call me Mr. U, if Uyehara is too much for you."
"And your hair. And your eyes. And the rest of you."
“That one.” He pointed at one of the rings in the far left corner. She brought it out of the glass case and instantly knew that it was perfect. John would love it.
How could Sherlock just leave all these letters here and not open them? He obviously didn't want anything to do with his parents. "We really wish you would forgive us." What did they do that was so bad that Sherlock wanted nothing to do with them anymore? John heard the scraping of Sherlock's chair against the ground and John quickly shoved the rest of the letters in the bin and snapped the lid back on. He shoved it into the closet, shut the door, and walked out of the bedroom with the light bulbs in his arms.
“Oh come now, Sherlock. We were trying to help you; rid you of that awful-”
"I would quite like it if we could kiss now."
John’s flashback ended abruptly as his phone started ringing. He didn’t bother looking at the caller ID.
person?” Sherlock said cocking his head to one side and grinning down at John. He realized what he said and blushed profusely. He took a sip of his wine and looked away quickly to cover it up, but he knew Sherlock had seen.
“Listen, there’s no easy way to say this but-”
"I'll only come home if you tell me what you're going to do to me when I get there. SH"
“Okay. There are pillows and some blankets on the couch for you.”
Sherlock blushed and mouthed the words thank you. John nodded and grabbed the paper from him. He sketched something on it for few minutes and Sherlock watched every movement he made; captivated by it. He finally stopped and handed it over to Sherlock shyly. When he saw it he was pretty sure he gasped out loud. It was a quick, but an absolutely brilliant sketch of Sherlock smiling.
"John, you are the best thing that's ever happened to me."
"Yes, well you are probably wondering why you are wasting your Friday evening at our flat," Sherlock said with a fake smile towards his brother.
John's POV
“Sherlock, listen…” John started. “No, John. I’m sorry I overreacted. You don’t have to tell me, but I
“It was-” He almost said nothing. But it was definitely not nothing.
"You're being ridiculous." Sherlock tried to ignore the fact that, indeed, he felt his face get extremely warm.
"Trial and error."
“Actually,” he began nervously, “I need, um, a ring for a man.” He braced himself, half expecting her reaction to be extreme. She just kept smiling.
Sorry guys, I got sick halfway through writing this and was only able to finish it today. Thank you for being patient!
He felt the first tears fall and for the first time in a long time, he let them.
“Well I was practically asleep until you decided to wake me for God knows what reason.” Sherlock rolled his eyes and took a sip of tea, looking smug.
"Yeah! Are you in it too?" John asked happily. He was so unaware of just how much Sherlock was dying to ask him out. He was cute and his jokes were so stupid, they were funny. Which made him even cuter.
Guilt didn’t even begin to describe the feeling John had at the moment. He was ashamed of himself for being so clueless as to Sherlock’s situation. Sherlock was absolutely right: John couldn’t help but pry and try to make everything better even if it was beyond his capabilities. Only now, walking in the cold, did he realize how badly he had fucked up.
"You mentioned it."
“Sure,” he says picking up the cheese and reaching over to put it on John’s side. John reaches for it and knocks over Sherlock’s tea in the process.
"I want tea," Sherlock mumbled.
"Great. I'm just going to go pick up some Chinese food for all of us while you do that." Sherlock just kept smiling.
~.~.~.~.~
“Harry… I thought you said you were trying to stay away from alcohol for a while.” John put his hands on her shoulders.
"The champagne isn't going to drink itself, John," Sherlock said nudging him a bit.
The next step was figuring out the best place for them to meet each other and the best time. They also needed a safe word, as weird as that sounds, just in case Sherlock couldn’t stand it anymore and needed to be bailed out of there as quickly as possible.
Molly:
"Good god," Mycroft mumbled and handed Greg some paper towels. "Sorry, Greg." He glared at Sherlock. Sherlock looked as smug as ever.
“I don’t have a definite answer for you, but I will do whatever it takes to help you get through this, no matter what. I’m not going anywhere, Sherlock.”
“Sherlock…” he began his apology. Sherlock pulled him inside, slammed the door, and crashed into him full force, knocking them both onto the ground. They both laid there wrapped in each other, sharing heat. The faded sound of rain pattering outside and their breathing were the only sounds. Sherlock nuzzled into John, not caring how soaked he was, and held onto him for dear life.
“We only did it because we loved you. We wanted it to work so that you wouldn’t have live with that burden, those demons inside of you.”
This was a bitter-sweet moment. Sherlock hadn't accepted his apology, but he wanted to see him again. At least, it was something. He responded as sweetly as he could.
“Get to sleep.” She flicked the light switch off and walked out.
“Where are you going to go?” John asked. Sherlock could tell that he was trying to control his breathing; something that he did when he was on the verge of panicking. Sherlock did his best to ease John’s worry.
"I-er nothing." Sherlock stammered helplessly.
"Actually, I have a dorm room by the high school. I don't get on with my parents very well and they took the first chance they got to get me out of the house." Sherlock replied sadly.
"I've got the perfect plan." Sherlock smiled deviously.
“Okay, now me.”
, I want-need you in me" Sherlock whined. John was momentarily stunned at Sherlock's new name for him. He was surprised that Sherlock had a fetish, but that just made John want to find every single one he had and exploit them. Sherlock seemed to get excited when John was the dominant role; the soldier and commander. John didn't mind playing that part at all if it meant he could finally do what he had longed to do since he met Sherlock: bury his cock deep into him and fuck him to submission.
“I-I’m at this bar somewh-” The call cut off. His sister was always doing this. Drunk calling him and expecting him to get her home safely. The phone rang again and he picked up with a heavy sigh.
Sherlock smiled and wrote underneath:
“Only
"Yeah. Four years." John said smiling.
"Are you all right?" He asked worriedly and took a step towards Sherlock. He noticed the cello case draped over the boy's shoulder. Sherlock was pretty sure he swooned. Cello was his favorite instrument next to the violin.
"Let's stop for a bit then, and rest. I don't mind"
~.~.~.~.~
"Do you have an extra pencil? I left my pencil case in my locker on accident." John whispered in Sherlock's ear.
John: I'm sure that can be arranged.
skinny, dear.” The venom behind the word “boyfriend” was unmistakable. Sherlock remembered this all too well from his childhood.
(See the end of the chapter for
The safe word “jam” was quickly thought of and agreed upon. It was an hour before Sherlock’s parents were to arrive, and Sherlock was pacing the flat like a madman. He was muttering to himself, running all the possible situations that could happen through his mind.
He carried the sleeping Sherlock up the stairs carefully, making absolutely sure that he wouldn’t wake him up. He set him gently on the bed, curled up behind him, and wrapped his arms around his torso. John exhaled the breath he had been holding in since he knocked on the door to 221B. John had woken up at the sound of thunder, and he couldn’t stand being away from Sherlock any longer. He walked two miles in the pouring rain to get to Sherlock and didn’t regret a second. Now here he was, curled up behind his favorite person, the way it should be. The way it would be, forever.
Nothing is the same.
"Sherlock, are you tampering with evidence?" Lestrade queries from the doorway of the office.
"What message?" Jim snarls.
Helen Harrelson was nothing if not persistent. “And—?”
If he hadn’t passed both Moriarty and Moran on the way here, he would approach with more caution, but with their whereabouts known and Sherlock so very close, he throws it to the wind and drives as fast as he can, still taking care through to avoid the potholes that would bring a sudden end to the car’s petrol tank and his journey. Even though it’s midday, the darkness intensifies as he enters the tree line, the pines planted so close together that no light penetrates to the ground. Then they give way to a small concrete block hut at the base of the watchtower.
“You could say thank you.”
In the Shadows - Amy Stroup • In the Shadows
The collision derails Sherlock's thought processes completely. He grabs both a pint bottle and a two-pint bottle and heads for the self-checkout. Following the automated voice instructions, he is grateful that it comes to a value low enough to just tap his card because the four-digit pin number is not coming to mind at the moment. He is further unsettled by the high-pitched, disconsolate wailing of the child, her hand held by the woman as she directs the cashier at the till to give her a packet of cigarettes.
"I think I'll start by having you suck me like a good boy. And then I'll fuck you into the mattress while you come screaming my name."
“It was just a little bit. I’m fine John. R-really.” She hiccupped.
The cab ride back to the flat was the longest 7 minutes Sherlock had ever experienced. He was a complete mess. His pants and boxers were completely soaked through with tea and his coat and shirt were splashed red with the soup. John kept apologizing to him the whole ride back.
“Ah, the lucky lad then. Come right this way, and I’ll help you find something special for him.” Sherlock exhaled with relief and smiled. People were actually starting to accept people like him; a time Sherlock never thought he would experience.
"Aw come on! You can tell me!" John said grinning and showing off a perfect pair of teeth.
“I’m not going anywhere, Sherlock. I love you and I’m so sorry.” John said, gently brushing his hand over Sherlock’s bare back. Sherlock just hugged him tighter and allowed himself to fall asleep in his protective arms.
"Adorably you say?"
"Our booking is for 4:30. We have at least twenty minutes to kill." They entertained themselves by having John deduce things about the people passing by and then Sherlock correcting him multiple times. They would always be giggling after and burying their faces into each other to avoid laughing so loud.
"Some alley, I don't know. The- the one behind Angelo’s"
You’ve never called me that before; why are you in such a good mood?” he asked playfully and kissed Sherlock.
“It appears that the tests were a failure. He shows no change in sexual preference. I’m very sorry that we were not able to help you.” The doctor handed them Sherlock’s paperwork as the frightened teenage boy shrunk away into the nearest corner.
pretty hard to upstage Sherlock.
~.~.~.~.~
"They were right about you. Completely right."
“Yes, thank you very much,” John shook his hand again, “It was wonderful to meet you.” They showed him out and made sure he knew where he was going. As soon as the door closed, Sherlock stood in front of John smirking. He felt his face get hot.
Mycroft: Ah, hello John. What can I do for you?
"So... What about you then?" Sherlock heard the words come out before he could stop them.
"Usually, there are up to eight, but I've booked us our own. It's complete with champagne and truffles."
"Just my lips? SH"
“Jesus, John. You finally made your move?”
"Have you ever been on it?" Sherlock asked and slipped his other hand into John's. It's amazing just how perfect it felt to hold his hand.
“And you’ve saved me countless times, too. We need each other.” John said, smiling gently. Sherlock realized that if he was going to propose soon, he needed to buy a ring. He really had no idea where to start, but he supposed that the mall was a good idea.
"Well, I would be fine, but this chemistry homework is driving me nuts. Oh, by the way, in case you were wondering, I got your phone number from Greg. He seems super nice and he was very enthusiastic about giving it to me." Sherlock resisted the urge to scream, and instead played it cool.
John walked slowly towards the now pleading Sherlock. He already knew what he wanted to do to that perfect body. He already knew just how he would break Sherlock, then put him back together again
Hello again! I am currently posting all of the chapters I already have.
Speaking of the past… John still needed to get in touch with the Holmes family and figure out why they needed to be forgiven, and why Sherlock wasn’t eager to.
“That’ll be perfect.” Valerian stepped into the dimly lit bedroom. It wasn’t large, but it had just enough room to be of use to them. Sherlock was stretching his long limbs, preparing his body for the strenuous activity he was about to do. As soon as Sherlock noticed Valerian’s presence, he stopped stretching and walked over to greet his new dance instructor.
"Yes, I've got a few errands to run. I'll be back soon, love." John couldn't help but smile as Sherlock pressed a kiss to his forehead. He adored it when Sherlock called him love. He was the only person Sherlock truly cared about that way, and it made him feel good.
John thought of what he could do today to pass the time when it hit him. In all of the confusion and confessing feelings for each other, John had forgotten all about the letters. With Sherlock gone, it was the perfect time to contact Sherlock's parents and have them come over. It was time for Sherlock to get over whatever this was. He was a grown man bickering with his parents. Then again, John didn't exactly know what they had done to Sherlock to make him that upset. It didn't matter anymore because John was set on repairing the bond between Sherlock and his parents.
"I think it's a good idea to change things up every once in a while," Greg said and smiled sympathetically at Sherlock. The other students chimed in with their agreement to play Viva La Vida.
did most of the talking. He had learned her whole life story in just 10 minutes, and it sounded like she was about to tell it all over again. "Sherlock, are you almost done?" John asked impatiently.
"Hello, Mr. Uyehara. This is the new student John." Sherlock said proudly, gesturing towards his new friend.
"How badly do you miss me? SH"
(See the end of the chapter for
There he was, tossing and turning in his bed, realizing just how empty the flat felt without John. “Where was John right now?” Sherlock wondered. Probably at his sister’s place. Sherlock wondered if maybe, just maybe, things could go right and they would both forgive each other. Sherlock rolled over for the millionth time and looked at the clock on his nightstand.
"Damn it, John! You don't know what they did! I can never forgive them. Ever."
"How so?" John smiled shyly and shifted his weight a bit.
Molly: Oh! Let me check my schedule. Yep, looks like I'm free. At your flat?
"I'm not special John." Sherlock interrupted sadly. John took his hand.
“Thanks.” She smiled at him.
That night, after coming home from another exhausting case, Sherlock suggested that they play a game.
John: We are having a get together at the flat tonight at 7 and I'd like it if you could come. You know, if you're not too busy that is.
"We aren't," John smiled.
~.~.~.~.~
John was surprised. Sherlock rarely expressed his gratitude unless he was in an exceptional mood. John wasn't complaining, though. Happy Sherlock meant no holes in the wall or just a generally grumpy atmosphere.
?" Sherlock asked, looking up at John, pleading.
a genius after all. As soon as they reached 221B, John excused himself to bed and didn’t give Sherlock another glance.
"999, what is your emergency?"
"Your playing was brilliant," John said and smiled in Sherlock's direction. He felt his face get warmer.
"Mm, hello John," Sherlock said groggily.
"Nice to meet you! You must be Sherlock! John's told me a lot about you!" John's aunt shook his hand as soon as he walked through the door. He felt his heart flutter at her words. How much had John been talking about him?
“I’ll go get it, Sherlock.” John placed a quick kiss on Sherlock’s cheek and went to the door.
WASSUP FUCKERS!!! Hi, okay so I know it has been almost a year and all of you are probably either low key done with this fuckin fandom because Moftiss kind of failed us in season 4 and you also might think I'm dead because I haven't uploaded in so long, but tbh I just haven't had any motivation to write. Recently, however, I hit a really low point in my life and I think that writing and FINISHING this fic will give me some purpose. Seeing all your comments is extremely refreshing and I don't want to let you guys down. So expect some new chapters hopefully soon ;) Love you all lots!
"I've finished the homework, would you like me to help you with it tomorrow morning?"
"I don't-"
“Deal. Oh and Harry?”
"I'm fine, sorry, just probably ate too much." John rubbed his stomach to make his point.
“I know. It was a mistake to do that.”
John: Um, it's John. John Watson. Could you just tell Mycroft that I would like to talk to him.
"You know," Sherlock said, shifting a bit so he was closer to John. "I finally understand why people are so obsessed with sex." John stifled a laugh.
"Nice to meet you too, ma'am." He tried to smile normally. He knew he wasn't the best at being social, but this was awful. Well, except for the fact that John was sitting next to him, sipping tea happily.
"Good, no one can take my army doctor away from me." Sherlock giggled and pecked John on the cheek.
"Thanks. I'll make sure to give some feedback to the chalet company; you've been great."
And he hasn’t heard that for a long time …
The observation earns him a smile but there is no corresponding verbal response. Instead, the Colonel turns to Moran and barks out an order, “Set it up here. Then push him up against the wall. "Tape this up beside his head and take a photo.”
Sebastian mutters as he jabs the elevator button aggressively.
—nothing else matters right now than forcing Moriarty out of the shadows.
"I wish you’d refrain from further sarcasm and explain."
John presses the doorbell next to the electric lock. Through the plexiglass doors, he soon spots Sherlock striding down the hallway, pivoting on a heel once to say something to a passing co-worker with a quick and courteous smile before continuing to the door. The jacket of his new, very slim-lined black suit is unbuttoned, revealing a perfectly fitted, borderline straining, Picotee blue shirt that accentuates out the bluer hues in his eyes. His hair looks as impeccable as ever but longer than he's had it for years, which lends him a slightly boyish, artfully dishevelled look. He still pouts when John says he looks good wearing glasses. There's a GOSH nametag clipped to the edge of his trouser pocket, and he looks every bit the up-and-comer star neurosurgeon he is.
"Yeah, we could see they found one guy in the snow. Man, he was
A slab of snow is descending down the face of the mountain above us. The fracture lines are growing, extending in my direction. My ears pick up an ominous rumble which sounds like a thundercloud on the horizon.
Sherlock has opened the lid of his laptop but isn't typing, just staring blankly at the screen. His head snaps up the minute the door clicks closed behind John. "First impressions?"
"No."
"Nope, they didn't, but my roommate is deaf and has advanced dementia on top of his just-repaired broken femur. He's very quiet."
"Why you sly fox. Otherwise, she might have seen you as a threat, given John's obvious adoration."
Sebastian says nothing more.
Eventually, just as the sunlight is turning golden and streaming in low between the buildings across the street, the bedroom door creaks open and soft, barefoot steps begin approaching. Swaying slightly in the entrance between the kitchen and the sitting room, Sherlock pauses to yawn and run his fingers through his sleep-mussed hair that's sticking in all directions. A rosy tint on his cheekbones has brought a dash to colour to the dull pallor of his skin is complimented by fever-bright, tired eyes. Wordlessly he takes in the sight and makes his way to the sofa, sinking bonelessly onto it next to John who abandons his computer and leans back. He shifts to the left side on the seat so that Sherlock can pull his legs up onto it and straighten them as he scoots closer to John, leaning against him as though sitting in a deck chair. His head lolls onto John's shoulder, and he whines something incomprehensible as he buries his face between John's neck and the backrest.
Perfectly round and ragged at the edges, the new mark has all the hallmarks of a contact range gunshot wound — the abrasion ring formed by the force of gasses enter below the skin, blowing the skin surface back against the muzzle of the gun. A hole filled in badly by the sort of plaster that comes in a tub. Close contact — personal … it’s the last thought he has before sleep takes him.
"And what idea would that be?"
The intercom crackles. "So, sir, there's a Sainsbury's coming up; do you still want me to--"
"Yeah, well my gut says natural causes."
John was quite sure that if Mycroft so much as said hello, he would break the man's nose. It might be satisfying, but would likely make John's night as unpleasant as his day had been. Not worth it.
"John has been encouraging towards your attempts at King's to make things better for you, has he not? To improve your working relationships with others?"
"A fucking machine," he shouts.

"Someone probably left something here. I'll answer it" Sherlock said. John heard the door open and then complete silence.
Sherlock was lying on his bed staring at the ceiling when he heard his phone ring. He groaned and sat up to answer it, not bothering to look at the caller ID, assuming it was Greg. He was the only person Sherlock ever talked to on the phone anyway.
“Goodnight John.
He was being teased. John knew with every fiber of his being that Sherlock was going to be a dick and not make the first move, and knew he had to try to not let himself. It made him furious (and aroused) every time Sherlock teased him. He would seductively wink at John in public and John was forced to stay calm. It was killing him and the only way that he could get back at him was to be an even bigger tease. John didn’t mind it much, but it
John: Hey Mrs. Hudson, it's John.
Their tongues were in a fight for dominance; both of them tangling and rubbing against each other in time to their grinding. Sherlock gave up and John leaned as close to him as he could.
“That’s enough!” John shouted and got right up in Sherlock’s father’s face. “I swear to God, if you’re not out of our flat in 10 seconds I am calling the police.” The left reluctantly, muttering about how much of a disappointment Sherlock was. The door slammed, and the dam broke. Sherlock started to sob, as John sat down next to him. He laid Sherlock’s head on his lap and just let Sherlock cry and break down. After a while, John picked Sherlock up bridal style and started to carry him to Sherlock’s bedroom.
By the time he came downstairs and was dressed and ready to go, Sherlock was already waiting by the door, tapping his foot impatiently. No surprise to anyone there. Sherlock was probably dying to get outside and solve a case. His big brain was throbbing from lack of excitement, John was sure. It had been at least a week if not more and he was, no doubt, already halfway through solving the mystery without even seeing the evidence.
So sorry for not updating sooner... My laptop is completely fried and I was forced to write all of this smut on my phone. Kind of hard to do, I must say.
"No." Sherlock down looked at the floor, embarrassed.
“As you wish.”
"What's that behind your back?" John smirked.
“Yeah?”
"Two weeks ago!"
"They all thought we were together anyway. What's the point?" Sherlock said in a bored tone.
"I'm fine. My name is Sherlock. Sherlock Holmes." He managed to get out and raised his hand out for John to shake it. He grasped it firmly with a steady hand.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Then tell him that! Apologize again!"
"My closet. I'll get them for you if you want." Sherlock said, still obviously still absorbed in his laptop.
When Sherlock got to the mall, it became immediately apparent to him that he had absolutely no idea what he was doing. Buying a ring to propose with was not exactly something he had experience with. He decided to go to the first jewelry store that he saw and go from there.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Thank you, John. I-I love you.” Sherlock stumbled over the words.
For about an hour, Sherlock inspected each rose in the shop carefully while John was forced to make conversation with the shop owner: a quirky, middle-aged woman named Diana Reid. She was okay to talk to, although
“Aw fuck it. Dare.” John said throwing up his hands in exasperation.
“John, are you going to cook like you promised?”
"I was not snoring. I don't snore."
“Yes, John? I’m waiting.”
. It always happened that way. He rolled his eyes and tossed the driver a couple of notes before climbing out and following his flatmate. Sherlock went immediately into case-mode as soon as his feet touched the pavement, and John just stood around awkwardly. Lestrade walked up to him in an attempt to make friendly conversation. “Hello John,” he greeted warmly. “Nice to see you, Greg,” John said smiling at him. Greg Lestrade was a nice guy with a warm, friendly personality. He was only intense if he was wrapped up in a lot of work which happened frequently, but John wasn’t around him most of the time.
"So Chinese?"
. John thought back to his very early days as a college student.
“Well, I’d say they fit quite nicely.” John laughed. He bit his lip and kept his gaze transfixed on Sherlock. He was completely unable to look away.
"So much sleep" Sherlock whined, "I don't know how you manage it."
"Would you like to... Do something together perhaps?"
He's totally teasing him! Naughty Sherlock!
“Oh, thank you. That’s very kind. It’s just this way,” John led him to Sherlock’s room, “Sherlock decided to push his bed to the side to make more room for you two.”
John’s POV
your own good. Then Dr. John Watson would contact my parents in an attempt to "fix everything." Sherlock said sarcastically.
“What game?” John asked raising his eyebrow a bit, having a vague idea of where this could possibly go.
"Thanks," John whispered almost inaudibly.
“I dare you to take off your shirt,” John said smirking. He was tired of being the weak, sexually confused one. He was going to make sure that Sherlock knew who his master was.
“It’s not something you can get rid of! I like people of the same-sex and you need to wrap your brain around the idea that I always will!” He screamed at them.
Molly: Bye.
HOLY SHIT, YOU GUYS! I actually finished a fic. I can't believe I did it honestly. Thank you so fucking much for all your support these past couple of years and thank you for sticking with me. Your kind comments and leaving kudos have helped me so much and gave me the confidence I needed to continue this. I never in a million years would have thought that people would actually read my stuff and like it. Thank you so much. Please share this with anyone who would want to read it and let me know if you have any feedback. Also feel free to follow me on tumblr @mybaeisbaymax :D Bye!
"About us. How we're together now." John gave an embarrassed smile.
“What do we do now?” John asked, taking Sherlock’s hand and massaging a tense spot. Sherlock let out a content sigh.
"It was really cute." Sherlock pulled John close to him and held him for a few moments.
"How could you? If you only knew..." His voice cracked. "If you only knew what they did to me." There were tears now.
"In Mr. Coleman's class?"
"I think you know."
.” Sherlock exhaled and stared at his hands. John fought every urge to roll his eyes at the detective. He knew how Sherlock got on cases, but this time it was different. Sherlock usually relied on John to save the client while Sherlock solved the mystery, but Angelo wasn’t just a client. John took a deep breath to calm himself down and put his hand next to Sherlock’s. Sherlock took the hint and slowly laced his fingers in between John’s.
"Hey, Sherlock don't worry." John said putting a hand on his shoulder, "your playing is amazing and anyone who doesn't think that can answer to me." He puffed up his chest dramatically and everyone at the table laughed.
"Like what?" He said setting down his pipette.
“Hello, sir, how can I help you today?”
“I’m going to go to sleep now,” John said, putting his fork down and standing.
"Correct. Thank you." Mr. U smiled.
"You don't think half the people here already know? You've been staring at John at any chance you get and blushing at the mention of his name." Greg wiggled his eyebrows.
In his post orgasmic state, John realized a few things about himself: he was definitely bisexual, he had strong feelings for Sherlock, and he was a top. Of course most of these things, John had realized earlier, but only now was he coming to terms with them.
"So you'll stay?" John asked hopefully.
"Fine. Your room or mine?"
"You're welcome."
Sherlock’s POV
20 minutes later, the duo found themselves at the only flower shop in a 30-mile radius of Baker Street. The sign looked like it had gone through several years of hardship, as it was just barely staying up. In a hideous font, the name "Fancy Flowers" was displayed. Sherlock scoffed as he took it all in.
"Sherlock, I'm sorry. I honestly-"
"There's nothing to worry about, love. I've got you." John's heart melted at Sherlock's words. John leaned into his warmth and breathed in the scent that was purely Sherlock. It was a comforting smell that included tea, cinnamon, honey, and something else that John couldn't quite place. They all made him feel comfortable, though, and they made John feel at home. John always knew he had a home with Sherlock in 221B, but now it felt more real; more permanent.
(See the end of the chapter for
would make sure that you eat something. I mean look at you! You’re
"I have a Sherlock Holmes kink. Now come on, I'm tired. The sex can wait; I need sleep."
"H-hello?" He stuttered through the phone.
"Actually yes. Would you mind coming along with me to a flower shop? It's for the case. I have a theory of mine that I would like to test."
“I obviously don’t want to talk to them, but since it appears that it is necessary, I would prefer to meet them here. I want them to be fully aware that this is my flat and they are not to do anything that would displease me.” John nodded and kept massaging Sherlock’s hand.
"Come on Sherlock, or we're gonna be late." John had a firm grip, Sherlock knew from the handshake that day in orchestra, but holding hands with him was nothing Sherlock could have imagined. I guess it wasn't really hand holding; more like John grabbing and pulling him, but Sherlock couldn't help but to get butterflies as he let himself get dragged by John Watson down the halls. He saw Greg give him a wink and a thumbs up before he rounded the corner and found himself at the familiar science room door.
“So, do you like him?” John asked, trying not to give into the temptation of grabbing Sherlock, ripping his clothes off, and fucking him right there. Sherlock just kept smirking, his lips turned up ever so slightly.
"The man we found at the lake was wearing gloves and we never thought to check under them, well you didn't. I took a look and saw a cleaned prick on his finger. At first, I didn't know what it was from, but after a quick background check, I found out that his ex-wife Diana Reid owns a flower shop and I knew it was a prick from a rose thorn. It didn't take me long after that to figure out that she coated the thorns with poison and gave the rose to her ex-husband. Sure enough, I found a bottle of arsenic in the back room while John was keeping Diana occupied. Good job by the way. My theory is that she gave him the rose as an “apology” and he didn't want it so she took that opportunity to shove it into his hands, therefore, pricking his finger and getting the poison into his bloodstream. After a few hours, he would have been paralyzed and Diana then was able to throw him into the lake to make it seem like he committed suicide and he drowned." Sherlock finished his long speech and handed Lestrade the evidence.
*Ring ring*
This chapter is really short. I'm super sorry. The next one will be longer I promise.
“Yes, I’ll have a croque-monsieur please,” John said paying little attention.
"Lay down and take your fucking. I am going to fuck you so hard, it will hurt to walk for the next week." John's voice was husky and velvety at the same time. "That's an order!"
He took a few deep breaths and ran after Sherlock. John may have been a soldier, but he knew that Sherlock was going to be considerably faster. Regardless, he pushed his body harder and sped up.
"Was I really that good?"
“How did you know?” Sherlock responded, looking surprised.
"It's just cake, Sherlock. If we bought it, it would be much easier."
“You-you’re so pale…” John said looking up at Sherlock.
"Christ, Sherlock! They don't need to hear about that." John's hand brushed past Sherlock's lower back.
"What? Who was?" Sherlock said sitting down in his seat.
P.S. Sorry about the cliffhanger. Things are not always as they appear.
He checked the water for its temperature and slowly got into the shower. He let the water run down his back and legs. It was times like this that John thought of Sherlock the most. His dark curls and perfectly sculpted cheekbones, accenting his face. He was definitely going to try taking a shower with Sherlock some time in the near future.
"John!" He whined.
"From measure 57!"
“You’ll see.” He laughed then walked back out of the kitchen with two full glasses of wine. John gulped and took the wine carefully, as to not have another accident involving spilling liquids. Although, not that John thought about it, getting Sherlock undressed certainly seemed like something at the top of his “to-do” list. He sipped the wine and relaxed into his chair.
"Thai?" Sherlock asked with a smirk.
“So what are you still doing standing there?” Sherlock turned and started walking towards the sofa. John followed and grabbed his arm before he made it there.
I am SO sorry for the late update. Life is crazy again and I might update less, but I will still try to update once a week. I love you all!
"Sherlock, my boy. We've missed you."
"Well, I had hoped maybe we could be.." Sherlock trailed off and looked up at John.
Three short raps on the door sounded, and Sherlock felt his heart stop. All the blood rushed to his face and he felt his knees go weak. John's strong grip on Sherlock's arm and reassuring nod helped a little as he walked slowly with him to the door.
"On my way. SH" John had to laugh at this situation. They had just sexted and now Sherlock was coming home to be fucked. John decided that a change of wardrobe was appropriate. He thought about wearing his army uniform, but it would take too long to get off. Instead, he chose a thin dressing gown and plopped himself down on the bed to wait for Sherlock.
"So why exactly are we here?" John said as he took another look at the small, old shop.
They started walking and John felt oddly calmed by Sherlock's presence. Sherlock had this aura about him. One look at him and you could tell he was strong, smart, and confident. John wondered what people thought about himself when they saw him. Probably just a wounded soldier that was lonely and now only slightly less so. It didn't matter because he wasn't lonely anymore. He had a genius for a best friend and he was perfectly happy.
, which made Sherlock tremble in pleasure. He went down Sherlock's back, licking and claiming him, leaving hickeys wherever he went. Finally, John grabbed Sherlock's legs and spread them apart himself. He squirted the lube on his fingers and traced his fingers lightly over the spots he had marked on his back.
"They're gorgeous, John," Sherlock said in awe, soaking them all in. John buried his face in his hands. "You really mean that?"
"And whatever shall we do to pass the time?" John said whispering in Sherlock's ear.
"Just the one I'm currently working on about the man at the lake," Sherlock said.
“Thanks again, Harry.” He walked into the other room and sat on the couch. The only things he had were his phone and his coat. He closed his eyes and exhaled loudly. Sherlock was the only thought on his mind. He wished for nothing more than to just curl up together and wrap his arms around him. His phone chimed and he saw that there was a text. That text was from Sherlock.
"You're the best thing that's ever happened to me, so we're even." He hugged Sherlock back even harder.
John longed for an hour or two of it. If he could just-
“Table for two?” the waiter asked politely with a light French accent.
As he opened the closet and reached for the lightbulbs, a plastic container caught his eye. He grabbed the bulbs and set them on the bed. He reached for the bin but stopped. Should he really be snooping? It was Sherlock's stuff after all. Alas, John's curiosity started to drive him insane and it won over against his better judgment. He carefully removed the plastic container and set it on the bed as well. To his surprise, it was filled completely with unopened letters. Envelopes upon envelopes had been thrown into this container and shoved into a closet. He looked at the address and was confused.
"You really want to? You're going to invite Mycroft aren't you?" Sherlock groaned.
John: He agreed. Even if it's just for an hour, I really think you should come.
"Take-away would be great, yeah."
. Were they ever really safe in the world they lived in? How could John have been lulled into a sense of security, when he and his boyfriend solved dangerous crimes for a living? John gritted his teeth. He felt like such an idiot for not seeing this coming. He should have known that Sherlock would have run off by himself to try and keep John out of it. One of the only people Sherlock would ever be selfless for.
"No. That would be giving up. We don't give up John." Sherlock looked at the kitchen with new determination.
"Yes. He's your family." John said and squeezed Sherlock's thigh. A soft moan came from Sherlock's ever so slightly parted lips.
They stood there a few moments, not knowing what to say. Sherlock walked over and addressed Lestrade.
"I'm going to fuck you into the mattress and make sure that you enjoy every moment of it," John growled and thrust again.
Oops it's a short, choppy chapter. Sorry people it's midnight and I'm exhausted.
"We have traced the call and we are coming to you. Plea-" John hung up and threw the phone down in anger.
"In the bedroom. Do hurry." John growled. With every step up the stairs from Sherlock, he felt his anticipation rise. Then he saw him: his perfect consulting detective boyfriend. He was standing in the doorway with a sheepish, shy smile on his face. He had his hands behind his back and appeared to be holding something.
What John wondered was: why did everyone think that they were a couple? It’s not like they hugged or even touched much around people or anywhere. The most physical contact the two had was the time when John stayed out too late drinking with some of his mates and he couldn’t get up the stairs himself so Sherlock decided to carry him upstairs to John’s room and put him in bed. John could barely remember that night, however many months ago, but somehow he remembered Sherlock tucking him in. He blushed in spite of himself.
John was often made aware of the fact that he was nowhere near as smart as his boyfriend. He had to accept the fact and try his best to keep his jealousy at an absolute minimum to not seem overly possessive. (Not that Sherlock would have minded.) John quickly realized that he had to put his insecurities aside for the moment. They would only distract him from making sure that Sherlock made it back into his arms safely tonight.
"Sherlock? Sherlock, can you hear me?" John sat up quickly and stared into Sherlock’s gorgeous eyes.
Mrs. Hudson:
"You're nervous," John smirked.
. He was going to unlock the pleasures that Sherlock kept buried away, deep in his vast mind palace.
Can you see how hard I'm trying to update this fic on time?? *cries* I need sleep. I hope you enjoy. Please leave comments and constructive feedback. Also: here is a bonus. I don't remember writing this, but it was on the google doc that my fic is on so enjoy.
“What a handsome young man you are. I’m excited for the lucky lady who gets to be your wife.” she joked. Sherlock started sweating.
~.~.~.~.~
He sat in his favorite chair and tried desperately to calm himself down. How long had he been without John? It couldn’t only be a day, could it? He took a deep breath and grabbed his phone from the table. He was barely able to send this simple text, due to the blurriness.
~.~.~.~.~
"Oh, did you leave? I didn't notice." Sherlock's response was immediate.
"It will be fun, come on." Sherlock nodded slowly in defeat. All that he could hope to accomplish from this game was performing some sexual act on John. Dare to dream. They sat across from each other on John's carpeted floor and just stared. Their eyes were locked on each other's and neither of them looked away.
“Okay, yes I got a boner, and yes I went to go take care of it during your lesson.” John sighed, slightly embarrassed. Sherlock walked up to him and bent down a little to whisper in his ear. “I know.”
~.~.~.~.~
He flopped down on his bed and tried to control his breathing. How bad was this situation? John would say pretty bad. He barely managed to catch up on any sleep. His thoughts were mostly of Sherlock, and John knew that the more he thought about him, the worse it would get. But he just couldn’t help himself.
"I made the cake myself," Sherlock said proudly. The guests just stared at it with a mix of horror and a bit satisfaction. Finally, Mrs. Hudson spoke up. "You boys finally realized your feelings for each other. Long after the rest of us realized it for you." The others nodded in agreement.
"We should get going." Sherlock said after a moment, his voice thick.
Greg looked up for a second. "So...you're saying that biology is actually going okay?"
"So there is," Greg laughed. "Come on then, out with it. Who's the lucky lady?- Or lad- I mean, which is fine too, obviously."
"Still," John shrugged, hauling himself up to face Sherlock who was still sat in the same position, his long legs dangling over the edge of the raised bed, fingers clasped together, eyes wandering from wall to wall.
"That's true," John agreed, pushing open the door to the back entrance, using his electronic key card to unlock the automatic doors and holding the door open for Sherlock. "You do realise it is past 5:30?"
." Sherlock grunted in return, pulling at the fraying thread of the button at his shirt cuff.
"One second-" Sherlock called, reaching straight over to a branch sheathed in hanging leaves to where the quietest of strangled mewling could be heard.
"Where would we go?"
Sherlock pursed his lips, glancing up to John and doing a double-take, noticing the expression on his teacher's face.
"I- John-" he whined, finding security in his eyes just as he felt the hand curl around his leaking cock.
"Of course. I - God, what do you think is going on? We're not about to run off to France together, he's my student-"
Greg shook his head. "Why isn't it an obvious match then?"
He looked to John who was sporting a horrified expression on his face, quickly righting himself to face the cleaner who had just entered the room.
Something registered in the genius' mind, a recollection of those same words echoing through his consciousness like the reverberations of a bell.
Thought Greg.
"You shouldn't feel guilty, you know." Greg said, watching the exhaustion in the other man's features, the miniscule slouch of his spine, the single crease in his shirt, somehow knowing by now that even these tiny discrepancies were hugely out of place for Mycroft Holmes.
"I'm terribly sorry, we take full responsibility for our employee. Whilst Dr Watson has not technically been unlawful due to Mr Holmes' age, this kind of behaviour is obviously unacceptable. We will be having strong,
"I'm still your teacher now, the circumstances work against us." He reached his hand across the void of the duvet, towards Sherlock.
"No, Sherlock." He gasped, having lost his breath. "Come on-"
It wasn't the first time Sherlock had followed John, but it was definitely the longest time he had attempted it for.
"Oh, please, you wouldn't be able to threaten a fly-" Sherlock retaliated childishly.
What are we thinking about Greg and Mycroft? ;)
"Oh, don't worry about it, dear! I'm sure Sherlock will keep me company for a little while. Nice to meet you, Doctor Watson." John was struck momentarily by the warmth of her hazel-brown eyes, and the genuineness of her smile. He blinked back at the elderly woman, who was stood with her hands clasped around her broom, the standard navy-blue tunic cleaners  uniform drowning her petite shoulders.
their battered and broken car?
"Why are you asleep in a science classroom?" John crossed his arms.
a relationship." John insisted.
"Another round?" the bartender appeared as if from nowhere, his eyes focused solely on John, a flush highlighting his cheeks.
He watched Sherlock fumble over his words and became even more awestruck by his student, perplexed at how somebody so incredibly intelligent could be so incapable of handling something as instinctive as emotions.
"His mother has a lot to answer for." she chuckled to John, who nodded dumbly in return, eyes darting back to Sherlock when he re-entered the classroom with his mouth and hands full of ginger-nut biscuits.
Sherlock sniffed and sat backwards on to one of the lab chairs, crossing his legs and raking his eyes over John to the point where he felt self-conscious.
John moved back up his body to kiss him, taking his face into his hands to ensure the comfort of his younger lover. "Promise me something?" he asked, pulling back and looking into Sherlock's transcendent blue eyes. "The second you feel uncomfortable, tell me."
"How is your hip, Mrs Hudson?"
Sherlock canted his hips upward in order to squash his phone down into the pocket of his trousers. "Probably some predictable magic trick of his including the security cameras of the entirety of London that he likes to show off with every so often"
." Greg pointedly ignored the attack at his intelligence and chose instead to move on to Sherlock's punishments.
"I just thought I'd let you know," The look on his face was a combination of thinly veiled disgust and suspicion. "This afternoon's meeting has been cancelled. I told Colin I'd let you know since I'd see you before he would."
"See you then" John nodded, pursing his lips and measuring the reasonable amount of distance between their bodies.
"Besides, I'm likely to get more bother from your facial hair." Sherlock scratched at his upper lip in false annoyance.
John immediately moved his hand to Sherlock's thigh. "Are you tired? Let's swap over, I'll drive."
All of a sudden his world was spinning. He felt dizzy as the sickening image came back into view.
Sherlock bit his lip to hold in an embarrassing moan when John's hot and heavy hand fell to the bulge at his crotch, rubbing through the material and moving quickly to the fastenings of his trousers.
"How would I know?" Sherlock replied with irritation evident in his voice.
Ten minutes later, John emerged from the bedroom dressed more appropriately, and in search of his lover, who had seemingly disappeared. "Sherlock?" he called down the stairs of the cottage.
John suddenly realised that there couldn't be less than 4 years between the two of them, knowing that there was at least 10 between Sherlock and himself. "Hmm, didn't we all." He muttered in reply, desperately trying to mask his bitterness at Molly's clear interest in Sherlock.
Instead of merging with other equally bored biology students throwing around their quadrats onto patches of grass and scribbling statistics onto clipboards, Sherlock had ventured close to a running stream, and was attempting to cross it, balancing on his tip-toes.
Before either man could speak again, a sharp knock shook them out of whatever strange state they'd managed to settle themselves into, and an assistant appeared immediately in the doorway.
Sherlock frowned, feeling John slide his arm around his waist and lead him back towards the way they came. He took a step and hissed, falling into Sherlock's side, pain flaring in his ankle.
"I would still have three others, so technically-"
John was  immediately escorted to the open floor plan of an abandoned car-park, with grey concrete walls and piles of rubble surrounding faded yellow parallel lines.
It was a rule of thumb that most students were usually desperately running for the doors of the classroom as soon as the bell rang signalling the end of the class, but Sherlock waited until the end, distrustful of his surroundings and slow in movement.
"There has been a complaint filed against me" he drawled, the most bored and unaffected sound John had heard come from him.
He immediately curled his long fingers around the parietal bone, skimming across the dips of the temporal bones. "It's not as if I have anywhere else to go," he finally answered seriously. "These revision classes are intruding on the labs, and I'm not allowed to perform any experiments in the hallways thanks to the new enforced fire-safety rules." he rolled his eyes, poking his thumbs against the teeth of the skull's bottom jaw.
The room was silent save for the irritating buzzing of a trapped fly repeatedly smashing itself against a closed window. With surprisingly quiet footsteps considering the weight and size of the chunky black boots, he moved forward, eyes scanning the shapes of the lab tables, sweeping over the open door to a separate adjoined room at the back before moving towards it quickly, gun in hand.
Sherlock frowned at him. "You do not look old, John."
"That is not a cave, John." Sherlock called out from behind him, he watched John's figure running towards the structure in fascination, the soggy leaves sticking to the sole of his boots.
"Of course," Greg supplied, folding his arms atop the table. "John is a good man."
"And I'm warning you-" Sherlock snapped, any semblance of civil conversation slowly dissolving between the two men, stood mirroring each other in the open and aged room. "If you threaten John again, if you have him harmed in any way, I'm gone."
With a sharp exhale of smoke, Sherlock yawns purposefully and turns his head away, clearly done with being in Mycroft's general presence or having to listen to anything he happens to say.
Greg held his breath as Mycroft outstretched his arm towards him, CD in hand, offering it out to Greg's absent hands that hovered by his stomach. Upon closer inspection, Greg could see Mycroft's refined scrawl in black marker, that the CD was titled
Greg ran his hands over his face, the coarseness of his palms felt refreshing against his tired skin. "What time is it?" he said around a yawn, leaning back in his chair and slotting his hands together behind his head.
"Shut it-" John jabbed from the side, trying to make it obvious to Matthew that he wasn't interested by turning his back on the young man's suggestive looks.
"Come here," he said quietly, his legs apart, arms outstretched, and Sherlock moved cautiously towards him, stood with his unsure hands at his sides until John wrapped his arms around his flat stomach and buried his face into the soft cotton of Sherlock's grey t-shirt. "You okay?" he mumbled.
John sat back in his own seat, legs spread and fingers curled over the edge of the arm-rest. He licked his lips subconsciously, shifting slightly as Sherlock's eyes met his own. "What do you want to see?"
The young man snorted indelicately in return. "
It was an angered Holmes that stormed off ahead to the coach an hour later when all students and teachers had re-assembled after lunch-time, he had spent his own lunch waiting outside the wood-cabin waiting for word from the vets and neglecting to eat anything at all, even when John had bought his satchel back to him.
"Oh, no, I- That wasn't me, I'm Sherlock's tutor. Dr John Watson here saved him from the fire" Greg gestured directly over to John who finally jumped down from the van, paramedics be damned.
"Yes"
"You're gonna have to be more specific than that, love." John chuckled, rubbing his nose against Sherlock's.
With an exasperated look to the ceiling, John leaned his head back. "Well, I hate to say I told you so but..."
He focuses of the sound of footsteps leading away into the library before he looks over to his collection of framed taxidermy spiders with a sigh.
"Why are you phoning me? We never phone each other" Sherlock accused as soon as he picked up the phone to his brother's caller ID.
"No...I'm not" John replied, thinking
Mycroft squinted, humour dancing in his eyes. "Oh don't tell me- you're
Mycroft returns at the end of the week, and Sherlock is annoyed to have his presence lurking around the house once more. He is also trying harder than ever to keep his thoughts inaccessible, not wanting his brother to find out about Dr Watson yet. Dr Watson was
"John isn't like that" Sherlock insisted, not caring about the name slip any longer. "It's not like that at all-"
"Come on," he propositioned to the teacher. "It's getting darker." He hesitated for a moment before holding out his hand, an almost timid look on his young face.

"Am I what?" he replied, monotonous.
"Just saying, the age gap probably isn't so severe, plus you look younger than you are so you wouldn't look like some kind of predator or-", Greg shrugged, wiping the froth from his upper lip.
Sherlock watched him.
Mycroft's gaze landed on the very same armchair which hadn't moved in years, currently occupied by a bright-eyed, ash-haired ex-inspector with laugh lines framed by long lashes as opposed to the tall but plump balding man who had once frequented the chair. His eyes fell to the worn fabric at the armrest, fraying seams and thread where his father had constantly dug his fingernails in, an anxious habit of his. He passed over the glass.
He'd just released the handbrake when his phone buzzed against his trouser pocket, which began the daily struggle of wiggling it out of the position between his bum and the seat without strangling himself with his seatbelt.
"Look, he's a young adult himself now, you can't control his actions. There's nothing you could've done."
"Mhmm..."
Suddenly, John was sinking down on Sherlock's body, his cock being enveloped in the overwhelming wet velvet heat of John's mouth, his head bumping the back of John's throat with little effort.
"Do you want my number?" Greg blurted out, settling the mug back down on his desk, and almost slapping himself straight away, "I mean- uh- you know, to call me- if you decide to use me. Not use me like that, I mean, utilise me."
soon."
The silence was loud enough to fill the void of conversation in the room between John and Sherlock as soon as the click of the door sounded.
