By midday, they were dressed and respectable, and Dean had prepared some food for everyone, with lots of extra green crap for Sam. He was looking forward to seeing his brother, and a little nervous too. He knew it was time for them to stop the co-dependence and have healthy grown up relationships, but it still felt strange acknowledging that to himself.
Her jaw clenched but Castiel knew she wasn’t going to yell again.
“I’m fine. I have you to guide me, so I know this time will be better.”
Cas and Dean turned to each other with contemplative looks. It wouldn’t be the
“You-”
Dean frowned at Castiel, his brow furrowing as he regarded him. “Oh. Well, y’know… I thought I might’ve-”
“Alrighty, let’s get homework done so we can play,” he said, mimicking what he’d heard Cas say a few times.
Deciding to focus on something else, he asked, “Hey, it’s your turn to pick the movie tonight. Did you think of something yet?”
There was probably nothing sweeter than hearing your child tell you something like this. Tears pricked the corners of Castiel’s eyes and they tried to not choke up. “I try to,” they said, soothing a thumb over Jack’s cheek, “but lately I haven’t been doing my best job so we need help from Dean until I can do better.”
Ultimately, he might still be an angel, but it was obvious that these days Cas preferred earth to Heaven and humanity to angels. And thank fuck for that.
“But what about your allergy? Won’t it make you sick?” Castiel suddenly wished he’d saved some grace, and used it to cure Dean’s allergic reaction.
“It’s kinda eerie how different it is.”
It had been well over a decade since Dean had lived with anyone, aside from the two months Sam stayed with him while his house finished being built.
“Daddy says we can’t.”
All of the friends they saw regularly were accepting and encouraging but it was the other patrons that were worrying. People were difficult to predict and even if very few ever questioned Castiel’s clothing choices, Cas didn’t enjoy feeling people staring at them. It was sometimes easier to not bother with it.
“I know that’s not true, kiddo,” Dean said lightly. “Your dad sent me your teacher’s website and I saw the homework list. You have to write a book report and do your multiplication facts. I’ll help you, okay?”
allowed in the kitchen again, following the boiled egg incident.
Dean had taken a piece of chicken from his plate and was bringing it to his mouth, but he stopped with it in midair. “You… that’s not the first time it’s happened?”
“Claire, please don’t yell at me. I’m just trying to help you pack the rest of your stuff.”
As if to prove a point, Claire stomped into the kitchen and threw her backpack onto the ground next to the table. She slipped into a chair and put her head down with a dramatic huff.
It didn’t take him and Cas too long to clean up the mess Krissy and the kids had made and both of them had a smile on their face as they did so. Bumping into each other and sneaking glances at one another, it felt like they were young kids with a first crush.
Castiel slid down the living room wall until they were sitting at Jack’s side. Jack wiggled into Cas’s arms and leaned contently against their side, putting the phone in between them so Castiel could see. Castiel kissed the top of their son’s head before asking, “Do they know who the villain is yet?”
Cas was mostly relieved that they’d be able to get home and would even be able to eat dinner with their kids. Even though they knew their car was going to be sitting in the parking lot overnight, it was a problem they could worry about in the morning.
Dean chuckled. “You might even need to sleep sometimes," he said, and there seemed to be a fondness in the tone of his voice.
Hence the begging, here on the front step to the rickety apartment they’d had to move into. Here, standing in the clothes that hadn’t been washed in two cycles since there hadn’t been enough change to wash both the kids’ clothes and Castiel’s at the laundromat. Despite the crap that had been ripe in their life the past few months, this was the first time Castiel had outright asked for someone to give them a break. If only it had mattered to their landlord.
The guilt and worry ate at them as they assisted Dean in loading up the dish washer and putting the leftovers away. They could hardly focus on the nighttime story they read to Jack, or tucking each of the kids into bed.
“Hey, look at this. The staircase is even fancier than the one in the bunker,” Dean remarked from behind him.
“Mrs. Hanscum said you’re my step-dad.”
Cas shuffled forward and grabbed Dean’s hips as he lined his cock up with Dean’s hole, then slowly pressed in. If he thought being fucked with Cas’s fingers felt good, that was nothing compared to this. There was a slight burn at the intrusion, followed by an incredible burst of white light when Cas’s cock hit his prostate.
“Are you sure?”
Even though Kelly had only been living in the apartment for less than a year, the kids were already at ease wandering down the hallway towards her door, laughing and joking with each other as they raced to be the first one to knock. They were comfortable in a way Castiel had yet to see them at Dean’s place. But they figured it made sense, since even Castiel still thought of it as Dean’s home and not theirs.
“Cas?”
“Looks like we’ll get a great cup of coffee in the morning.” Dean gestured to the coffee machine, then at the French doors that led from the kitchen out to the back garden. “And the view’s not bad, either.”
So Castiel didn’t blame his kids for being moody, to say the least.
Kelly’s apartment building was nicer than Castiel’s old one had been, in a way that made Castiel jealous yet proud of Kelly for achieving her goals with her job. Still, Castiel felt out of place as they walked through the front of the lobby, past the security who politely nodded in their direction, and over to the second set of elevators that led to the apartments.
Castiel bit into his, and Dean was right; it did taste good. But not as good as the ones Dean made. “Yours are better,” he said, matter-of-factly.
The moment Cas slipped back outside, Dean grabbed a bottle of whiskey from the cupboard and a glass, and went through to the living room. He knew it wasn’t the best idea he’d ever had, but fuck it. Beer wasn't going to be enough.
But here was Dean, making Cas question if those people’s words mattered. Because if Dean saw Castiel as beautiful, why did they care what someone they’d never speak to again thought?
Dean thought as he experienced a searing pain in his head and everything started spinning.
Dean clenched around Cas’s fingers again, and Cas groaned into his mouth before breaking off the kiss and resting his forehead on Dean’s collarbone.
“It was supposed to be a rhetorical question, Cas. But I got your answer loud and clear." Dean started to head back into the house, but stopped and turned back to Cas again.
He felt bold that night. He didn’t think he could rein it in if he tried. He wanted to be close to Cas. He wanted to tell Cas the thoughts he had in his mind. He wanted to see the way Cas’s face softened when Dean said those things. All he could think about anymore was
“Yes, we’re just about done. Claire, what are you comfortable with Dean taking?”
The conversation between Sam and Cas that Dean had overheard a few days ago hadn’t helped matters either. Neither of them were aware that he’d heard anything, but it had stung, and he was kind of unhappy with both of them.
As he worked, he mused on what Mimi had said about Zander and Dan being attacked by the ghost almost as soon as they moved in. He and Cas had been here nearly twenty four hours, and they hadn’t seen anything. They were living as a couple, and even sleeping in the same bed, weren’t they? But there was nothing supernatural going on, and he couldn’t understand it.
Claire was still smiling to herself when Dean made his way back to the lobby and asked if she was ready to go. The mixture of her happiness and the fact that he was proud of her for sticking up for Cas, Dean decided to treat them both to some ice cream cones on the way home. Claire decided she wanted to eat inside so they both ordered double scoops before finding a booth to hang out at.
Dean’s blush deepened. “It has been said.”
Cas’s yawn was all the response he got. Dean laughed as his friend turned around and went back into the house, likely to spend the next hour on the couch as their mind fought against the need to wake up.
“I disagree. You said very nice things about me - even though I don’t deserve much of it - you made sure I had food when I was hungry, and you saved me from Bob.”
They didn’t have a solid plan but Castiel knew that at this moment, there was one person they could rely on to help figure out the next step.
No. They weren’t. But it was clear Dean immediately regretted what he said.
“Nope, it’s cool, I think I got it all.”
The feeling of Dean’s hand in his was both comforting and suffocating at the same time, but Castiel didn’t want to pull his hand away and risk spoiling the mood. He could maybe find a reason for Dean to let go of him, though. “I’m hungry. Do you think they have burgers?”
“No. No I haven’t seen it,” Castiel struggled to explain, their voice completely even. “I just already knew.”
“I believe these stairs will be much quieter than the ones we’re used to,” Castiel said, smiling, before climbing the rest.
He knocked on Cas’s door around lunch time on Thursday, having just solidified his plan into a real possibility. The kids were away that week which Dean was glad for because it gave him the chance to talk to Cas about this without any interruptions.
Cas gasped and fucked into him once more, and Dean clenched around him again and again, until Cas finally came, his orgasm ripping through him as he worked through the aftershocks.
Castiel had all but forgotten about the ghost, which was ridiculous, because it was the reason they were there, after all. He started feeling a little guilty about how much pleasure looking after his plants was giving him - and even the time he was spending with Dean - but was there really anything wrong with doing things that made them happy while they were there?
Dean had already made his way into the house after shaking off the sawdust from his clothes. “Trouble?” He asked, not liking the sound of that.
But Dean had been the one to ask and Castiel was terrified of what was to come when they returned home.
Thanks for reading, leaving kudos and comments, I love you all!
Dean nodded. “When you slammed me up against the front door? Instant boner.” He swallowed thickly, and a tremor ran through him at the memory.
“I believe I’ve heard that one once or twice before.”
“It’s kinda got a Stephen King vibe, but at least it has character. What do you think, Cas?” He turned to Castiel and smiled as he gave him a quick pat on the back.
As Cas started to speak, Dean grew increasingly more worried.
A crash came from downstairs and they both closed their eyes and groaned, their sweet moment now officially interrupted.
As if trying to prove their exhaustion, Castiel’s jaw popped as they yawned.
It was funny… if Sam started yapping incessantly about nature like that, Dean would have tuned out. But Cas’s enthusiasm was pretty damn contagious, and Dean could actually feel himself encouraging him.
“Only if you want to.”
But then Jack added, “And Claire says you’re mean and don’t like us.”
“Cas. I… er, yeah. I need to use the bathroom, but I feel like I’ve gone ten rounds with Mike Tyson.” Dean turned to face him and grimaced.
“PB&J, but it seems like you neither have peanut butter, jelly, or bread, and I wouldn’t be able to taste it anyway, I think.”
Down the hallway, Castiel could still hear Dean and his brother Sam shuffling through the house, Dean giving Sam directions on where to take things and how to label some boxes. Earlier, when Claire had been yelling at anyone who even walked past her bedroom, Castiel and Dean had exchanged a look that meant:
“Then grab one or two of those and then try these on for when you’re at home.”
,” he eventually admitted with so much disdain in his voice that Dean was pretty sure he was angry at his body - or vessel - for putting him through this.
Castiel knew better than to argue and made sure to signal to Dean to leave her be. Instead of making a fuss, Castiel grabbed the kid’s lunch boxes out of the refrigerator and grabbed an extra granola bar to slip into Claire’s. They weren’t sure if there was snack time at this new school but the gesture still made Castiel feel better.
The whole day had felt like a rollercoaster; every time it seemed like he and Cas came close to being comfortable with each other, something went awry again. It felt more and more like the foundations of their whole friendship was on rocky, constantly shifting ground, and Dean was beginning to fear that it might never stabilise again.
“Hey Cas, I’m just calling to let you know I have Claire, she’s perfectly fine. I’ll explain everything when you get home. I called Kelly just now and left a message too so you both don’t have a heart attack.”
The house was quiet when Castiel got back, their least favorite part of their kids being with Kelly. It was nice to have time for themself and to sleep in just a bit longer before work, but it was also the worst to not have their kids with them each and every day.
Cas stood behind him and looked over his shoulder, everything Dean had ever told him about personal space clearly forgotten, but Dean didn’t comment on it. Poor guy had obviously enough going on and the memory of the pulverized siren was still fresh in Dean’s mind. He
"Good, huh?" Dean nodded at Castiel enthusiastically.
“Yeah,” Dean sighed as they reached Mimi’s house.
Draining the rest of the cup, Dean poured himself another coffee and one for Cas, then stepped outside. “What do you think, Cas? Could you grow something in that soil?”
that sucked.
It had been the house Castiel thought they’d stay in for a while, at least until the kids were grown and they’d need to downsize. Getting laid off made sure that dream hadn’t stuck.
He had limited knowledge of trains but Jack’s enthusiasm was contagious. For the entire hour the two of them played, Dean could only chime in a few times before Jack told him a new train fact or reminded Dean of the rules for whatever game they seemed to be playing. It was when Jack seemed temporarily out of train facts that Dean decided to ask the kid some questions.
Dean huffed and gave an embarrassed shrug. “I know how important they are to you, so-”
“It’s fascinating that food changes its consistency when it’s exposed to heat,” he told Dean.
He steered them towards the gardening tools, and there were indeed green shovels, pairs of gloves, and trowels too. Dean told Cas to choose one of each, and strangely, he kept holding them up in the air and looking between each item and Dean before deciding on the shade of green he wanted. It was almost as if he was checking for something, though what, Dean couldn’t say.
“Thank you for being understanding,” he said, reaching his hand out to shake hers.
“Hopefully our elusive ghost isn’t watching and wondering why we’re not carrying something heavy,” Dean chuckled as they made their way back into the house.
"Just how long have I been asleep? Is it Christmas?"
It took nearly three minutes for her to finally answer. Castiel knew she expected them to either press for an answer or leave the room without one, but what their little girl hadn’t seemed to grasp yet was that Castiel would wait for her forever if they needed to.
He couldn’t imagine what the hell Claire had gotten into that they needed an adult to come get her. She didn’t seem to be acting out anymore at home. She seemed almost happy lately too, especially since Kelly had been able to come over last weekend and help Claire with redecorating her room. It was a shock to hear she was getting in trouble.
Even Dean didn’t seem to be as invested in the movie as he normally was, and Castiel began to wonder if this disastrous attempt at pretending to be a couple would be what finally destroyed their friendship.
. I know you like cowboys, and it’s not a movie we’ve watched together yet.”
“It’s disgusting that you’re a morning person,” Castiel said by way of a morning greeting.
Once they’d found a place to stay and were settled in their room, Dean cracked open a couple of beers while Sam fired up his laptop.
“Honey, I’m so sorry. I didn’t realize the money was due with it. I should’ve read it better.”
First, Cas might seem more human these days, but he was still an angel, and Dean reminded himself that they didn’t experience emotions the way humans did. There was no way he would want to have sex with Dean, and even suggesting it would feel like coercion. Cas would surely be disgusted at the idea, but say yes because of the case. And second, if for some reason he asked and Cas said yes, it wouldn’t help Dean and the oh so confused feelings he had for the guy. Things were awkward enough as it was, without adding one-sided feelings into the mix.
Dean was a pretty tidy guy. It was a byproduct of growing up with his dad. John Winchester had been a bit of a perfectionist. Everything had its place and it was most logical to put things away as you used them to limit the need to spend a full day cleaning. Dean could admit his dad had a lot of flaws but his preference for cleanliness was something Dean actually understood. Keeping his space clean made Dean feel less bogged down, like he could take off with the rest of his day and accomplish everything on his to-do list. He was proud of his home and how organized he kept it.
“No chick flick moments,” Dean said embarrassed, as the cat meowed at them for attention.
Once Dean handed Krissy some money for pizza and Castiel gave Claire and Jack strict instructions to be on their best behavior, knowing full well the house would be a mess and the kids would still be up when they got home, Dean and Castiel locked up behind themselves and hopped in the car.
Sam stared at him, then at Cas, then back to Dean. “Oookay, good. That’s good. Nice work, guys.”
“What should I say to Dean?”
He was almost too angry to come back downstairs but by that point he was ravenous and didn’t have many other options.
Then it was time to leave.
Castiel walked over to the roses, and waved his hand at the ones he’d used his grace on, as Dean came closer, his eyes widening in surprise.
At the sound of their dad’s voice Claire and Jack came out of the room laughing and asking if Cas liked the pictures.
it’s been occupied through the years by straight couples and families, who’ve lived there quite happily without any sign of the ghost. But one… their son brought home a guy one night and he was killed. And there was another death sixteen years ago, involving a gay couple. Each time, one half of the couple was killed.”
The last thing Dean saw before landing at the bottom of the stairs with a thump and smacking his head on the uncarpeted hallway floor, was Cas charging furiously at William with the bar.
The kids were long asleep by the time Cas got home. They had called on their break but Dean had been too busy with the kids and hadn’t noticed which meant Cas was rolling with anxiety by the time they walked in the door.
There was little he was able to do for Dean while he was asleep, but Castiel had removed Dean’s boots for him and gotten a blanket from the bedroom to keep him warm. The rest of the night had been quiet and uneventful, and Castiel had spent the time reflecting on everything that had transpired since his return from the Empty.
“You make it sound so easy.”
Dean stood there awkwardly, his hand lingering on Cas’s shoulder, an uneasy silence settling between them.
She didn’t say anything for a long while but Castiel could hear her trembling breaths and knew she was still crying. They knew there wasn’t more to say at the moment so they pulled themself up off the floor. It was as they reached to grab the doorknob, Claire said the most hurtful words she could muster.
“Do you believe that?”
“Yes?”
“I’m not like most angels,” Cas said, and wasn’t that the truth? The others were all dicks with wings; well, ninety nine percent of them were, anyway.
“Don’t worry about Dean,” Sam said, rolling his eyes dramatically. “He’s just mad because he wants to sit around twiddling his thumbs all day. I’m gonna go throw some clothes in a bag… Meet you at the car?”
Dean stared at Bob in disbelief for a few moments, before answering. “No. No, I’m not… neither of us are.”
Sam had done what Dean couldn’t and pulled Cas into a hug. “It’s great to have you back, Cas. And Chuck’s been dealt with, so with him not writing our story anymore, we get to write our own.”
Dean winked and wiggled his hips in an enticing manner. “Not too gentle though.”
To be fair, Dean had never looked at them in quite the same way he was looking at them now. It was the same way he’d looked at Castiel a few weeks ago on the front porch, when Castiel had almost thought Dean was about to kiss him.
“I will try my hardest to be useful to you, Dean,” he said.
“You okay there, Cas? Communicating over angel radio?”
He’d been pondering a possible solution for a while and figured now was his chance to give it a try.
“Just adorable,” Mimi said. “You be sure and come back again.”
Dean’s heart skipped a beat. He had to take a moment to swallow the bit of ice cream he just took. His voice came out a little hoarse. “What?”
Just last week he’d yelled at Claire when she was picking on Jack. Castiel hadn’t been mad about it and the two of them had a short discussion about it the next day, but it still rolled in the pit of Dean’s stomach knowing he’d already overstepped. The last thing Dean wanted to do was make Castiel think Dean was judging his parenting. He’d just been so shocked by Claire’s outburst and refusal to listen that Dean’s instinct had been to help.
It was obvious he was trying to make amends with Castiel for upsetting him, but he was under the impression that it was all about him drinking himself unconscious. Apparently Dean had little to no memory of what he’d said that had hurt Castiel so much.
If Dean hated the homophobic sonovabitch already, it was nothing compared to his murderous intentions towards it now. Just as Cas and him were doing what Dean had wanted for so long… but there was no time to think about that now. With a fervent hope that they would pick up where they’d left off once they’d destroyed the ghost, Dean sprang into action, doing what was second nature to him when dealing with the supernatural.
“Not yet.”
Dean made a scoffing sound. “I’m sure I could make enough noise if I put my boots on and-”
The following week with the kids went much smoother than the first week. Claire still didn’t seem to want to go to school but she wasn’t actively arguing with Cas each morning either. Dean didn’t quite know how he could best help them each morning and since the three of them were running late basically every day, making breakfast for them all was pointless. So most often he stood around off to the side, drinking his coffee and eating his cereal until one of them asked him to help find a jacket, backpack, or homework folder.
“I’d love to hang out with you.”
“Yes, but there’s been more good than bad,” Castiel added quickly, feeling the need to defend their relationship, no matter how false it was.
“I think it worked out this way though,” Dean replied softly. “Claire didn’t want to upset you so she might’ve kept quiet on the whole thing and had to be suspended tomorrow.”
It was hard to give their daughter time when she had her sights set on hurting her brother’s feelings at every chance she got lately.
“Okay,” Jack agreed. He seemed to be back to his normal self and slid out of Cas’s arms onto the floor. It was pretty clear he was no longer upset when he turned to his dad and asked, “Daddy, did you know Dean has a penis like us?”
Castiel trusted Dean to handle it, especially since only Claire’s room had been unpacked prior to Dean and Sam’s arrival with the moving truck. It also helped that Castiel didn’t have much they needed to keep. Their kitchenware and living room furniture were either hand-me-downs from family members or a few things they’d picked up from a trip to Ikea. Since a storage room seemed like an unnecessary expense and Dean already had all the essentials at his house, most of the big items Castiel owned were being donated.
“Good thing I want to,” Dean retorted smugly. “Do you think you’ll need two weeks or do you want to aim for this weekend?”
tell Claire that. Her birthday is coming up and I swear she’s hinted at wanting one every day for the past month,” Dean said with a bright laugh. It made Cas smile to think that Claire wasn’t just pushing her kitten narrative with Kelly and Cas but with Dean as well.
If they weren’t already hurting before, now there was a chasm where their heart once had been.
When William realised that he was unable to get to them, it seemed to fuel his rage even further. “You’re not allowed to kiss in my house. Get out!” he wailed. “Go, now.”
“Cas, right?” he asked, using a hand gesture that Castiel was pretty sure was called finger guns.
Castiel smiled happily. “I’m glad you like them. Now I think it’s time for coffee.”
“Is there anything you like, food-wise?” Dean asked.
Cas was outside, poking an empty flower bed with the toe of his shoe, like he was assessing the soil or something. Dean watched him, wistfully thinking about how even though they were together on this case, they’d rarely been so far apart.
Dean narrowed his eyes at him, then nodded and turned back to the house, with Castiel following behind.
Of course, Castiel had no doubt that Dean hadn’t said a word about Castiel’s love confession, so Sam wouldn’t have a clue about the consternation his suggestion caused. He did seem to pick up on Castiel’s hesitation, however, and his tone was softer when he spoke again.
The teenager must’ve heard Castiel’s displeased sounds because they were quick to ask, “Are you sure you’re okay sir? You’re not like, having a stroke or something?”
“No. Thanks to you, I’m fine. But I’m very sorry… I made this harder for you than it should have been.”
“No, thank you,” he replied, attempting to pull his arm away from Bob’s hand.
legal credit card, he made his way outside, where he found Cas waiting for him, virtually levitating with excitement.
Dean’s hand tightened slightly around his, and Castiel had no idea how to interpret that, or indeed anything that was happening. Was Dean merely trying to convince everyone, or was there something more behind his actions? Having promised himself that he wouldn’t hope for anything with Dean beyond friendship, Castiel couldn’t help the feeling of possibility that began to bloom once more in his chest. Despite every instinct in him screaming that he would only get hurt again, he knew it was already too late.
Dean stepped a little closer and dropped his voice to a whisper. “Well, our ghost is still a no-show, so after a super late breakfast,” he chuckled and his cheeks reddened again, “I think I’ll go up to the attic and clean the windows. It’s gotta be easier from the inside.”
Bob looked over at Dean and indicated with his head. “So, you and Dean… you been together long?”
Castiel should’ve known calling their best friend with a heavy, emotive tone in their voice would automatically set off Dean’s protective instincts. Already Castiel felt more at ease knowing Dean was going to be able to help them come up with a plan.
“Claire.”
Castiel had heard that stroking a cat could be therapeutic, but he hadn’t realised just how true that was until now. Every time he rubbed her head, she purred, and the sound increased in volume until he could feel the vibrations rumbling through him. It was very pleasant, and he felt a sense of contentment as he closed his eyes and rested his head on the wall.
“Extra pickles, extra ketchup?”
The rest of the week went on without much time for Dean or Cas to spend together. Dean did most of his work in the mornings while Cas was sleeping and Cas was gone until the evening at their job. By the time Sunday night came around, when Kelly came by to drop the kids off, Dean was eager to have them back.
He’d anticipated that their friendship wouldn’t go past that first day’s discussion, but by the next class Castiel was already asking about days and times they could watch movies together. And that was the start of a nearly two decade long friendship.
Cas looked at them too, and shook his head. “No. There are very few green flowers, and none I know of that would suit our garden.”
The woman was about Dean’s age, and was standing on the front path, waiting patiently for them to appear. “Hi, I’m Mimi, your nearest neighbor… though it’s not exactly close.”
“No, it’s definitely mine.” Dean slumped into the chair beside them. “I shouldn’t have yelled at you over just some mess. It was stupid. I know you have a lot going on and I shouldn’t have reacted like I did.”
“Don’t worry about it,” Dean said and Castiel could hear the way he waved them off. “The house is paid off. Just pitch in for groceries and we’ll call it even.”
Was he crazy for not liking the mess? Or was he so used to living alone that he didn’t understand how normal people lived?
Dean rolled his eyes. “Slow down, Sammy. Jeez. You really can’t wait until we’ve eaten, huh?”
“You swear you’ll wake us up too?”
“Is this Dean Winchester?”
Dean didn’t want to admit it, but Cas was probably right.
After last night, Castiel was starting to feel more comfortable around Dean. They had spent a nice evening together watching the movie Dean had chosen -
“Over there?” Dean pointed to a section with a sign proclaiming ‘Fertilisers’.
Shaking his head, Castiel replied, “No, I’ll stay. If I can battle my way through Hell, I can spend an afternoon with a group of strangers.” Of course, it wasn’t the strangers he had a problem with, but if it made things easier for Dean to believe that, that would be the story Castiel would stick to.
Castiel couldn’t help the little laugh that burst out of him. He’d become too used to barely interacting with Dean, and he suddenly realised how much he’d missed this easy banter.
” Dean tried to argue unconvincingly though he knew better. He was a product of his upbringing. Though he loved his parents and would do anything just to spend one more day with them, they weren’t without their flaws when they were alive. John Winchester, Dean and Sam’s father, was a retired marine and brought his military expectations into their home. Both boys knew to make their bed and turn up their rooms each morning, their bathrooms always had to be spotless and if they ever skipped out on their chores their groundings were harsh.
Dean was fighting the voice in his mind screaming,
“I really do want to apologize for this happening and I appreciate you coming down here to explain what happened,” the principal said once the door was closed. “I didn’t feel it necessary to explain this in front of Claire, but Ms. Black has been moved around in the district many times and we are her fifth placement. I agreed to try it out and see if she would be a good fit for us but it seems her values don’t necessarily align with ours. I’ll be reporting what happened today back to the district and see where they take it from here but since I don’t imagine her views to change even after speaking to her, I think it’d be best to get Claire out of her class and into a more welcoming environment.”
“You sure?” Bob gave Dean a hopeful look, then turned his attention back to Castiel. “If you change your mind-”
After he’d got comfortable on the sofa, Dean poured himself a big glass of the whiskey, then downed it in one. He immediately had another, and then another, until he had a good buzz going on,
“It’s only temporary,” Dean promised. He was about to semi-jokingly suggest Cas quit and Dean be his sugar-mama until Cas found a new job but he knew his friend’s pride wouldn’t like that suggestion.
Dean felt he did a pretty decent job keeping his cool while on the inside he was fuming over this teacher. He didn’t understand how someone who chose to work with children could lack the ability to be open minded.
Matt chuckled and kissed her on the cheek, then winked at Dean and Castiel. “Hey, guys, could you dial it down a notch? You’re making me look bad.”
“What about you?” Patricia asked quickly, as if she was trying to deflect attention away from them. “Was it love at first sight for you two?”
“I don’t want to watch his baby movies,” she declared with an attitude. Castiel took a fortifying breath, knowing exactly where this was about to go. They opened their mouth to intercede but the argument had already happened. Jack whined loudly.
Five minutes later, they were on their way back to the bunker. Sam was in the passenger seat, and Cas was in the back, looking pretty exhausted, if Dean was any judge.
“Heya, Cas. What’s up?”
He could see Cas mulling the idea over. It worried Dean that his friend hadn’t immediately agreed to the situation. It made him start to doubt his own competence with the kids. Maybe he hadn’t done so great of a job the past times he’d watched them. “Unless you don’t trust me with them?”
Dean’s face fell. “Damn, I’m sorry, Cas. You shouldn’t have wasted it on healing me. I would’ve been fine.”
As the movie progressed, the intimate scenes between the two men lessened and then they were parted for a considerable length of time, and Dean silently breathed a sigh of relief.
In the centre would be a telescope - of course - and around the sides a sofa, some cushions, maybe even a small fridge to keep some beers in. It wasn’t much, he knew that, but Dean had never lived anywhere before with an empty space like that. A space that he could design, even if it was in his imagination. He had the Dean cave in the bunker, sure, but even that room had furniture in it when Dean took it over, (which he’d managed to utilise pretty well).
“Thank you but I’m already running late.” Cas practically sprinted towards their room, Dean following behind. He watched Cas sift frantically through their closet and pull out all their few shirts. Dean was on the other side of the room but he could tell from his spot that very few of Cas’s clothes were in good shape. Most looked dingy, with stains, holes, or completely thread worn.
“Mommy has money,” Jack said sweetly, trying to be helpful.
The text asked if there had been any sign of the ghost yet, plus an enquiry about how Dean and Castiel were getting on together, and Castiel needed a moment to think before replying. Of course Sam would be pleased to hear that they were more comfortable with each other than they had been for longer than Castiel wanted to think about, but how much would Dean want him to say about that?
Even though Castiel feared that that day might eventually come, he wanted to stay in the bunker for as long as possible. It was still his home, and even though he knew he couldn’t have what he wanted most, he still wanted to be near Dean, in whatever capacity the hunter would allow.
After tidying the kitchen, Dean found
“Food was great,” she replied, walking towards the living room. Castiel shut the door behind them and followed along. They both usually chatted for a bit on the days Castiel dropped the kids off. They could hear their children off in the bedrooms giggling over something. “How’re you doing?” Kelly asked once they were both sitting on the couch.
Lifting the hem of Dean’s shirt as far as his armpits, before realising he would have to break off the kiss and reaching for Dean’s zipper instead, Cas was obviously done with any thoughts of taking it slow, and Dean was totally on board with that. However, he really wanted to get Cas on the bed, but he couldn’t do anything about that for the moment because Cas’s hands were roaming over his newly exposed skin; skimming down his spine, tracing the outline of his ribs, rubbing his thumbs over Dean’s nipples.
As much as her words warmed him, he couldn’t focus on the ‘potential step-dad’ side of it. All he heard was how much she’d noticed Cas’s sadness.
All the panic from their talk with Rich finally washed away. They had somewhere to go. Somewhere stable and safe and where Castiel wouldn’t have to tank their credit score even further to put a down payment.
So many of their friends were there that it took nearly ten minutes for everyone to greet one another.
“Glad to hear it,” Mimi said with a wide smile. “I hope you’ll be staying for a long time.”
“Nah, it’s okay. You didn’t say anything too revealing. But I don’t understand why the ghost isn’t putting in an appearance; we’ve moved in and we’re living as a couple, aren’t we?”
Dean stared at his brother, trying to get his head around exactly what Sam was saying. There was something he wasn’t quite getting, and he was waiting for the other shoe to drop. “So then, how do we…?”
“I love you to the moon,” she said as she pulled him into a hug, the familiar words they’d always shared.
With their talk finally out of the way, the two of them spent the night talking through household responsibilities and discussing what they felt would be fair. Castiel made a list of expectations they felt the kids would agree to, thinking it would be more than fair to ask them to put away any of their belongings if they took them out into the main living spaces.
He lowered himself into a sitting position on the ground, and the cat immediately climbed onto his lap and got comfortable. She was scruffy and very thin, and Castiel guessed that she was probably homeless. He was unable to offer her a home, but he could give her companionship, even if it was only temporary. He held her carefully in his arms and rubbed between her ears, and she leaned into his hand.
Cas nodded. “That’s wise. And if it turns out she’s telling the truth, it all fits with what Sam told us.”
“Hey, you can’t say that.”
“I hate you.”
“Long, dull, lots of listening to old white men explain how things are supposed to be.”
Button off. No more shirts. Cas needs help.
Dean cried out and gripped at Cas’s arms, as he wrapped his legs around Cas’s waist and dug his heels into his ass to get him deeper.
And they wondered if this was how life was going to be. Would it just keep getting worse from here?
“Hey, what’s going on?”
Dean stood in the kitchen, holding his head in his hands. What the fuck did he just do? Cas had made an innocent remark about the cleaning and painting Dean had done, and Dean went and turned it into an innuendo.
“I disagree,” Castiel insisted as he let go of Dean and picked the cat up once more. “I think you love chick flick moments.”
“Heya, Cas. Can I pour you a cup?”
Cas didn’t finish his sentence, but Dean knew what it was he’d stopped himself from saying. He was thinking about after they left the house, and yeah, that was pretty depressing too, but maybe it was an indication that Cas didn’t want to leave either.
“Yep,” Dean nodded. “This case was kind of a wake up call. The ghost threw me down the stairs, and I cracked my head. Cas had to heal me, so yeah… it’s gonna be safer for both of us.”
No one was in the living room when he made it to the bottom of the stairs and he could see that a mild attempt had been made at clearing up. His desk was at least mostly put back in order though he knew he’d have to spend the next morning reorganizing the papers. He didn’t want to feel as annoyed as he was, and he was fairly certain the lack of food was keeping him in a negative headspace, but he was over the mess. It had been so much easier when it was only him living there.
Cas had given him a smile of relief. “You defeated him; I knew you would. But where’s Jack?”
“Dean, Cas, I hope you’ll be real happy here. It’s a shame about the fellas who lived here before you… really great guys. Zander and Dan. They spent months remodelling the entire house, coming and going every weekend. Then almost as soon as they moved in, well… I don’t believe in ghosts, but something strange happened. Must’ve been an intruder, which nearly killed Dan.”
Keeping mostly out of Dean’s way had an added benefit; that of Castiel being able to conceal from him just how much his grace was fading. It was still there, thrumming under his skin, but it was no longer the force it had once been, and if it continued fading at this rate, it was entirely possible that Castiel might eventually become human again. He couldn’t help worrying that Dean might decide that Castiel was no longer useful to them and kick him out of the bunker. Logically, he knew that was unlikely to happen, but the memory of being left to fend for himself when he was at his most vulnerable was an ever constant painful reminder of that possibility.
Cas nodded and swallowed, then answered. “I have barely any grace left. I’m almost human now.”
“You have plans for the week?”
Dean knew he should be uttering similar sentiments, but his friendship with Cas had been a little difficult ever since the angel had returned from the Empty. When Cas had declared his love for Dean, right after telling him about the deal he’d made and moments before being sucked into nothingness, Dean had been so stunned he didn’t know how to react.
Even though Cas was more of the academic, sophisticated, living off their parents' money type, and Dean was a whole hell of a lot more blue collar type, something about them just clicked. Back then, Dean remembered thinking he’d found his other half. How else could he explain the way two teenagers from wildly different aspects of life could work together so seamlessly? Castiel understood Dean’s mind in the same way Dean understood Castiel’s. They could communicate just by looking at each other and knew exactly how the other would react to someone’s joke, a new food, or meeting a new person.
Those bright blue eyes looked up at Dean with glee and asked, “Do you want to play trains?”
Perhaps that was why Castiel had called Dean in the first place. Dean was a problem solver and a protector at heart. If there was a problem he couldn’t solve, he did anything in his power to find someone who could solve it. Dean offering Castiel a place in his home wasn’t necessarily out of left field, now that Castiel thought about it, it was just the way their friend was hardwired. Taking care of people was Dean’s thing.
Holding his hands up in a gesture of surrender, Dean spoke quietly and calmly. “Hey, William… it is William, isn’t it? You don’t have to do this. We’re not the enemy here.”
It wasn’t like Dean to say something he didn’t mean. And knowing he was willing to share this thought meant he’d likely been thinking about this situation just as much as Castiel had. Perhaps they’d both been sifting through the past few days and wondering how they were going to address this because it had been nice those first few weeks.
By the time they made it into bed, Dean had managed to change the bedcovers, and Cas looked like he could sleep for a week.
Wearing the clothes Castiel felt were the most beautiful was something that still scared them. It didn’t matter to them if an outfit was marketed towards a specific gender, if Castiel liked it, they just wanted to wear it. Some people hadn’t understood, had said things to them that had etched deep into Cas’s heart. It hadn’t happened often, but it had happened enough for it to leave an impression.
They followed Mimi into the house, where she sat them down and insisted on giving them each a glass of lemonade and a slice of apple pie.
Dean tried not to speed as he made his way over to the school but getting that call had set him on edge.
Mimi looked genuinely upset for her former neighbors, until she suddenly remembered herself. “I’m so sorry. You don’t want to be hearing about that when you’ve just moved in. I hope you’ll be very happy here.”
“Cas,
It took him a few seconds to find the box, because
"You need to wear something different," Dean added. "Mimi's already seen you in those clothes twice, and she's gonna think you're a weirdo if you turn up wearing them again."
“My–my, you know?”
“Okay, then, I’ll…,” he started and Cas nodded and left the library.
“Hey, buddy. Didn’t you hear Cas say no? ‘Cause I did.” Dean stepped between them, as Castiel breathed a sigh of relief.
Dean opened his mouth to say something, but seemed to change his mind. Pushing his chair back abruptly, he stood up and collected the plates and cutlery, then brought them over to the sink. He washed them quickly, then turned back to Castiel again. “So… movie?”
After dispatching the second of two nasty-ass vampires - who looked nothing like Robert Pattinson and didn’t fucking sparkle - Dean slumped to the floor and caught his breath. As his breathing slowed, he looked over at Cas, leaning against the barn doors and staring at the ground, with a distraught expression clouding his features.
hungry, but he had to distance himself from Dean for his own sake. All he could do now was hope that the ghost would show itself soon, and they could wrap things up and get back to the bunker. It would be much easier to spend less time around Dean once they were back there.
“Are there any movies you wanna watch?” Dean asked, prompting the most bemused expression Dean had ever seen from Cas… accompanied by a head tilt, of course.
“We can clean it. I promise I can clean it.”
Dean leaned in and planted a gentle kiss on Cas’s lips, before pulling back and smiling.
“What if I hadn’t healed you and you’d died? That’s something I don’t even want to think about.” Just the idea of it had Castiel’s chest tightening in anguish.
“Maybe we need to spend more time together when we’re in the house,” Cas said finally, hesitantly.
Eileen shook her head emphatically and chuckled as she shot Sam a wink. “Not me. I know what I want.”
“Are you okay?” he asked, his eyes practically boring into Dean’s soul.
Dean had tried to quietly enter that morning but Castiel is certain that Dean doesn’t realize his version of quiet is about as quiet as Jack trying to whisper (not very). Dean promised that once they were all unpacked and the hallways were not lined with boxes, that he would move his desk and computer into another place in the house so Castiel could have his own room. Until then, Castiel was in for annoyingly early wakeups.
“They’re not
“I don’t know what I’m doing.
“That’s the plan,” Dean lied, then got to his feet and gestured with his head for Castiel to do the same.
“Okay, okay,” Dean said, stepping outside. “What is it that’s got you so excited?”
“I just… Yeah, I can wait,” Sam said, before starting on his food. Dean could see that the wait was killing him though, so he decided to cut him a break.
“Oh, you’re back. I didn’t hear you come in. Did you eat dinner? I can heat something up for you.”
“Clearly I—”
“I’m sorry, Dean. I tried to tell him no, but-”
“Well, they’ve all got green leaves and stems. And... that’s not the same, is it?” Dean said as Cas’s face fell. “There aren’t any green flowers that attract bees?”
“Oh, I think she just got confused because you live with me,” he tried to rationalize. “She must’ve assumed that meant I was married to your mom or your dad.” He tried to sound casual as he said it but he wasn’t sure he did a great job. The implication that people assumed he was probably married to Cas since they lived together and Dean helped take care of the kids… did something to him.
“See, Cas, the neighbors are talking about us already,” Dean said with a chuckle, all charm and friendliness.
“You can talk to me, you know,” Dean said unexpectedly. It made Cas stop what they were doing and look at their friend, silently questioning Dean’s words. “You’re upset. You can vent to me if you want to. I’m always up for listening.”
much.
The following morning, Castiel was glad to see that he had woken before Dean. He’d decided that today would be the day he became fully human, and he didn’t want Dean to try talking him out of it. Being neither a fully powered up angel nor completely human, made him feel like he was in a kind of limbo, and he was determined to do something about it, one way or the other.
“Where are you? Are you hurt? Is it that damn car again?”
Dean stared at him, smiling gently. “You’re better than Google, you know that?”
“You have mine too,” Cas added, following Dean’s lead and taking a bite of his food.
Castiel watched as Dean rambled nervously, before putting his mug to one side and taking the blanket from Dean. It was soft, and decorated with pictures of bees, and the socks that were rolled up inside it were similarly patterned. It was such a sweet gesture, and his eyes prickled slightly with tears as he laid his gift down and pulled Dean into a hug. “Thank you, Dean. This is so thoughtful.”
“Twenty eight years for us,” David was saying, gesturing between himself and Patricia, who made a horrified face, then grinned and blew him a kiss.
None of their family lived near them either, so to ask a family member for a temporary place to stay was out of the question.
Dean’s face lit up. “Sure. I’ll give you a shout when it’s ready.”
Dean’s shoulder pressed up against theirs and Castiel leaned into it. “I will be.”
Dean sipped his coffee as he watched his three housemates shuffling through the kitchen without so much as a glance in his direction. He watched as the kids set their plates in the sink, grabbed their lunchboxes, and shoved them unceremoniously into their backpacks. He watched as Cas came hurriedly in from the hallway with their coats, helping them put them on since it was getting pretty chilly in the mornings. Dean watched as they all formed a cluster and moved towards the door, shouting over their shoulders ‘Bye Dean!’ and ‘have a good day!’
“That hurts me to hear you say that because I love being your dad more than anything.”
“Don’t worry about it, honestly,” Cas waved off. “He should’ve knocked.”
“And it’s okay if you don’t have any ideas,” Castiel rushed to say. “I just thought I would call you because you always seem to know these things. And I—I can’t call Kelly and ask her for help because I don’t want her to feel like she has to take the kids more often with her new job and I just… I don’t know what to do.”
Today was one of Dean’s days off though, and he had news to share with Cas. He’d just gotten done talking to Sam on the phone, and Sam’s excitement had rubbed off on him. He’d called to tell Dean that Eileen was expecting a baby, and Dean couldn’t be happier for them.
Dean burst out laughing, all other thoughts and worries forgotten for the moment. Trust that to be Cas’s takeaway from the movie.
“Me, you, and daddy all have penises.”
“Can we take the bed?” He asked, still standing in the doorway unwilling to risk Claire yelling at him again.
“Good.”
Of course. Hopefully it will be soon.
Little by little.
“Yep, one day I wanna-” Dean started, but then seemed to think better of it, and quickly changed the subject. “Well, we should probably unpack.”
Just then Dean heard Cas come through the front door, and he quickly opened the fridge and searched for the ground beef. He was just taking the packet out when he heard Cas’s voice behind him.
When Dean awoke - in the bed this time, thankfully - he wasn’t at all surprised to find that Cas was already up. It had been that way every morning since they’d arrived at the house, but this was the first time that Dean felt more relieved by it than disappointed; partly because of the tense atmosphere between them, but mainly because he had a boner that needed some attention. It gave him the breathing space to really think about everything that had happened the previous day, before facing the man -
“I got you a bit of everything,” Dean declared, as Castiel took one of the plates from him. Stepping closer, he murmured in Castiel’s ear, “You don’t have to eat it all. I’ll finish anything you don’t want.”
“That’s not very mature, Dean,” Cas said, before offering his congratulations to Sam and Eileen. “I hope you’ll be very happy. You deserve some happiness.”
“I’m well aware how many kids you have,” the older man replied. For what it was worth, Rich did seem mildly regretful to be delivering Castiel the news, but not regretful enough. “They’re good kids too. But they’re not my problem. Two weeks.”
Dean grumbled something Castiel couldn’t make out, then got to his feet. “Well, I’m not gonna let the two of you go alone. I’m coming with you.”
“Happy.”
They had a plan and they both seemed happy with it. It wasn’t at all what Cas had expected the conversation to look like but they were grateful their worst fears hadn’t come to pass.
“I love it!”
The Bees
“I kind of hope he never learns how to say Metallica. How does he keep getting cuter?”
He knew the irrationality of Cas’s mind when they were stressed, so Dean knew better than to feel insulted that Cas didn’t immediately think of this solution. They were on good terms now, even though Dean hadn’t fully forgiven himself for being a shitty friend.
“Do what?”
“What’ve you got in mind?” Dean asked when they stopped kissing.
“Oh, damn, that’s rough. Poor William,” Sam said, sadly.
“Yeah.” Dean scrubbed his hand down his face, and stared at the evidence in front of them.
Dean thought, as he chanced a look at Cas. The angel was still leaning against the wall, and he was staring intensely at Dean.
“Cas… what?” Dean managed to croak out before Castiel quickly stopped him by clamping his hand firmly over Dean’s mouth.
love.” Dean got to his feet and crossed the room to stand in front of Cas.
That sex scene though… it looked kind of painful. There should definitely have been prep involved, or some shit like that. Dean was sure he’d heard that somewhere anyway, although his knowledge of gay sex was pretty limited.
Cas almost recoiled at the sudden grip on the back of their neck but realized they’d been screwing their eyes shut for the better part of their meltdown. Dean kept the pressure on his grip and it took Cas a few moments to calm themself down enough to open their eyes.
Still, Lizzo was a sweet little creature; she didn’t bring
before heading towards the coffee pot for a refill.
So of course on a day that had already started off on the wrong foot, with two of the three places they interviewed with saying they’d chosen someone else for the position, it was a happy surprise to be cut from their shift after only one hour on the job. It sucked for the upcoming paycheck that would be merely pennies but it meant Castiel got to be home for the night and that was enough to lift their spirits.
“No!” She screamed again, pulling away despite the fact that in doing so it yanked the brush through her tangles with a cringeworthy tear. Castiel let go of the brush immediately, hoping she didn’t hurt her scalp.
“Thank you,” Castiel interrupted, his jaw clenching as he battled against his warring emotions. “Although I don’t really know why you’re saying sorry to me. You did nothing that warrants an apology.”
“Daddy? We’re here.”
“Maybe we can get a nightlight for the hallway so you can see better when it’s dark,” Cas suggested softly, still rocking Jack back and forth. “Would that help, love?”
Sam and Eileen still lived in the bunker, but they’d also retired from hunting, and were now running a seriously impressive hunter network. Kind of like the British Men of Letters, but one hell of a lot less douchey. When they weren’t answering phone calls, or researching in the bunker’s library, they were frequent visitors of Dean, Cas and little Lizzo. (Yes, Cas had insisted on naming the cat Lizzo, and because Dean had told him that naming her was his job, he had to live with it. He drew the line at calling her name outside the house though; he did have some limits.)
Dean had to stop himself from making a snarky remark about Cas not wanting to spend anymore time with him than necessary. That definitely wouldn’t have been a smart move.
But if he were being completely honest, he didn’t necessarily want it to be a roommate situation.
“Has she ever had to walk to school during winter without a coat?”
“Why do you keep them hidden then?” Dean asked and bit his tongue a moment too late. It wasn’t like this was any of his business and it definitely did not seem as if Cas wanted to talk about it.
“Positive. Plus, dinner is staying warm in the oven.”
“I know you are immensely capable of doing this yourself, I have never doubted that for a second. I only thought this would go much faster for you if you had some help.”
It was just a field trip, they knew that logically. Yet it felt like so much more. What other experiences would they be unable to provide for their kids if their life continued on this trajectory? Would there be more field trips and eventual class trips they’d miss out on because Castiel wouldn’t be able to afford to evenly split costs with Kelly? Would Kelly resent Castiel for not truly dividing their responsibilities fifty-fifty?
The truth hit Dean like a truck, and he dropped the photo back down onto the table, before turning to Cas. “Oh, fuck. This is so fucked up."
“You said you wanted me to wear something different, but I still don’t have any other clothes.” He held his arms out by his sides in a gesture of resignation, his glare daring Dean to contradict him.
“Since when?” Dean asked, sounding almost offended in not already knowing Cas’s favorite color.
“Four, and I get to pick where to shop.”
“Talk to me.”
Dean nudged him with his elbow and gave him a knowing wink. “Well, if there’s anything new to discover, we’ll get it out of ‘em.”
Castiel would forever be dismayed at how many humans had such a terrible attitude to something so important to the survival of the Earth’s ecosystem. It was disheartening to hear Brittany dismiss them so offhandedly, but before he could respond Dean spoke up.
“Who said anything was up? I mean, something is up, but can’t I just ring my brother to say hello?”
He realised Dean had said that because he thought Castiel might be concerned about a repeat performance of his extreme alcoholic consumption a couple of days ago. He appreciated the gesture - even though it was really none of his business how much Dean drank - and giving what he hoped was an encouraging smile, he whispered back, “That’s probably for the best. Some of the guests might have useful information, so a clear head would be advisable.”
“Hey! I’m a delight,” Dean said, wondering if throwing food at his brother would be too immature.
“It’s like you know us or something.”
Dean figured that his only option was to show Cas through his own actions how sorry he was. He would be extra nice to him, starting from now.
Dean patted his own stomach and grinned. “Did somebody mention food?”
When he turned back around, Cas was staring at him intensely; eyes blazing and an eyebrow raised in question. It affected Dean in a way he didn't want to examine too closely, and it was probably just as well he'd taken care of himself earlier.
“You what now?” Dean knew his tone was confrontational, but if Cas got put in harm’s way because Sam had downplayed the details of the case, Dean was going to be mightily pissed.
Claire heard the tail end of his message and looked a little nervous as she sat down.
Thanks for reading :)
It was a perfect night.
“He just has a timeless face. Like you. You’ve aged beautifully.”
Seeing Cas’s face when he spotted the mug had made Dean all warm inside, and he was still feeling it after he’d tidied the kitchen and made his way up to the attic.
Cas stared at the screen as the end credits started, then he turned to Dean with an expression of sadness. “I really don’t understand this problem so many humans have with sexuality. Jack and Ennis deserved to be together and live a life free of shame and fear. Love is love, after all.”
It was pretty early in the morning on a Wednesday. The kids were at their mom’s for the entire week and Dean was feeling a bit confused by the sudden change in the house since Castiel had dropped them off Sunday night. The house felt stiller and uncomfortably quiet.
Dean’s whole being hurt. Is that truly what Claire believed? That he didn’t love those two as if they were his own?
Dean realised that he had been staring at Cas like some kind of sex starved creeper, so he shook his head and attempted a nonchalant smile. “No…
“You want anything special for lunch?”
All he could do was stare.
"You've always been good with your hands," Castiel said.
“Okay.”
All that earned Dean was a groan as Castiel rolled over, their back to Dean now. They threw the covers over their head for good measure and Dean knew it was time to wrap it up. He quickly shut off the monitor and tiptoed out of the room, closing the door gently behind himself and making a silent promise to relocate his office later that day when Cas wasn’t trying to sleep.
“I don’t want help!”
But Castiel was a parent and one awful fact of the world was parents were forced to be morning people whether they liked it or not. It was made worse when your child also did not enjoy mornings.
“I did,” Jack added from his seat.
When they entered the store, Cas realized they didn’t know where to begin. It had been years since they’d purchased more than just one clothing item for themself. They’d been mostly replacing items here and there when they were worn out. It had worked for them for a while.
kept apart for the same reason.”
“I’m sorry I don’t have anything better,” he expressed sincerely. He wished Castiel felt comfortable enough to wear some of their sweaters to work but Dean was well aware how many shitty people there were. If Cas wasn’t up for dealing with them, Dean wouldn’t push the matter, no matter how nice he thought Cas looked in a baggy sweater.
“You take care of us.”
“I didn’t give it to her,” Claire said nonchalantly.
“It was all the kids. I was just in charge of tape duty and being their alarm clock.” He smiled at his friend who was looking at him with an unreadable expression, but Dean thought maybe looked a little like adoration. He felt his gaze trail down to Cas’s lips, wondering, just wondering if maybe he wouldn’t be rejected if he closed the few inches between them. Before he could so much as move a centimeter, Castiel turned away, bringing Dean back to reality.
“I hope so,” Cas said. “I’ll try to find out once we... after we-”
Dean knew something was going completely awry about a millisecond before it happened.
Dean resolved there and then that he was going to make sure that Cas knew how important he was to the Winchesters, starting with accepting his choice of movie.
“I know you’re upset but I won’t be leaving until you speak with me. The sooner we talk, the sooner I will leave you alone. It’s your choice how long I’ll be in here.”
“Talk to him,” she said sternly, and Castiel knew she’d be texting him in the morning for a report.
The barbecue was at three p.m., so at a little after two, Dean went up to the bedroom to change into something a bit dressier. He had a nice blue shirt that would be perfect and some almost new jeans. They’d go great together.
Sam joined them then, tossing his hair before giving Cas a sympathetic look. “You okay, Cas? You’re not hurt, are you?”
“I wish you weren’t my dad.”
“Dean, I’m quite capable of having conversations with these people.” Castiel realised that his tone was harsher than he had intended, and the shocked look on Dean’s face told him he needed to explain.
“Hell should I know?” he barked.
The rest of the day was fairly boring. No kids to talk about what they did at school, no arguments over who got to pick a TV show, no loud toys being played with from the living room. It was strange how quiet it was.
Jack still seemed a little hesitant but Dean could tell how much the kid wanted to play outside of his bedroom.
“So uh, so how do you like living here?”
The way Cas laughed and shoved Dean by the shoulder warmed his heart.
Castiel had to agree; it really was good. "It's delicious, Mimi. Thank you."
Ten minutes and he’d be good.
“And we’re done,” Dean blurted out as he put the last pancake on the stack, relieved as Cas let go of him in order to set the table.
“Yeah but we’ll get it fixed.”
He had always known that this was something he couldn't have though - he'd even said as much to Dean before the Empty took him - so he would be stoic about it, and hopefully being close to Dean for this case would repair their friendship.
“This is embarrassing,” Castiel muttered between grit teeth to no one in particular and Dean handed him another glass of whiskey. He wasn’t sure if the angel could feel its effects but he nevertheless seemed to accept it gratefully and downed it immediately.
And when he held Cas’s hand as they ascended the staircase, no words needed to be spoken, at least not yet. They didn’t even make it as far as the bedroom, just stopped in the middle of the landing. Dean’s hand automatically rose to cup the side of Cas’s face, allowing him the chance to see his own feelings mirrored in Cas’s gaze. This was everything he’d ever hoped for, right here in his arms. They needed no words as their lips came together, this is where they were always meant to be.
Dean nearly melted when he felt Cas squeeze into the hug and whisper against his neck, “Thank you.”
“I’m going to go check on Jack,” Castiel announced once the bed was out and all that was left were boxes and a few more trinkets that Claire seemed determined to pack herself. They stood and wiggled their legs a few times, trying to shake feeling back into them. “I’ll let you finish packing up the rest of this. Dean and Sam are going to grab everything we already packed up though, okay?” At least they got a head nod from her before leaving the room.
“It would be mostly secretarial work but it’s salary.”
“What?”
They were actually excited as they got ready. The button up they changed into wasn’t nearly as soft as the sweater they’d been wearing earlier in the day but it was a habit now to switch clothes before going out. As much as Castiel loved the different patterns and styles of all the sweaters and flowy tops they had started to accumulate in their closet, it was still easier to go out wearing basic neutral clothing. Jeans and a loose button up. Today’s color was light blue. Their nails were painted the rainbow sparkles that Claire had decided were the best color out of her set of nailpolish, and Castiel’s mascara was still looking fresh. They wanted to possibly add a little bit of eye shadow and liner, maybe some blush and a gloss, but knowing they were getting together with friends at a bar made them hesitate.
The visible sag in Cas’s shoulders just then was enough for Dean to pull Cas into a hug.
They brought all of Cas’s purchases around to the back garden, then Dean left him to his task, declaring that he needed to prepare the burgers. Before getting to work in the kitchen, he took his own purchases out of the trunk and hid them away in the back of a kitchen cupboard. He would surprise Cas with them when the moment was right.
Castiel pulled on Dean's hand impatiently, hoping to hurry him up. "I've made coffee."
He let her get her emotions out and clean up a bit before the two of them drove back to the school together. Dean refused to let the situation wait until the following day and with Claire’s permission to speak with Mrs. Hanscum again, they made their way back into the office.
It wasn’t that he didn’t care about the oppressed - of course he did - but what with all of the monsters and apocalypses he’d had to deal with in his life, he’d left worrying about that to others.
“Hey kiddo, how was your day?”
awkward since neither of them seemed keen on looking the other in the eye at the moment. Were they both thinking about penises? Were they even adults?
It was a gorgeous house. Castiel had always thought so. It was renovated here and there, with updated bathrooms and a spacious kitchen but it still held onto the integrity of the original structure. Castiel knew Dean loved his home and took pride in how well cared for it was. It was a welcoming place and warmer than the home Castiel had grown up in. The home shared with Kelly had been a nice one as well, a place Castiel had planned to live in for many more years, a place where so many memories had been created. Deep down, Castiel held out hope that someday they’d find a real forever home. A place like Dean’s where so much life and happiness had taken place.
Laying his knife and fork down, and shooting Cas a look that said ‘I got this’, Dean said, “We got the ghost to show by kissing. He really didn’t like that.”
Eileen giggled again, and Sam choked on his mouthful of food. “Right. Well, that’s great.”
“This house doesn’t feel too haunted,” Dean observed, going over to one of the windows to peer through it, before tracing what looked like a random pattern with his fingertip through the thick layer of dirt. “The scariest thing here is how badly the windows need washing.”
“Seven years. Seven! How the hell did that happen?”
Big emotions were allowed to be had, so long as Claire and Jack understood they must eventually verbalize why they felt them and what they could do to work through them. Discussion was important to Castiel and Kelly, and though it earned them much disapproval from all the other ‘perfect parents’ in the world, it worked for their family.
Dean must’ve looked as shitty as he felt because the first thing Sam asked as he sat was, “You okay?”
“Yeah?”
“Okay, tell me where you are anyway. I’ll be there as soon as I can.”
“Don’t worry about Sammy. I know how to handle him. We’ll invite him here for a debrief, tell him we’re in love, and after he’s seen how happy we are here, I’ll tell him we want to stay. It’ll be fine; I promise.”
With his mind whirling from the weight of everything he’d just realised, Castiel found himself unable to respond, but neither Dean, Brittany nor Matt seemed to have noticed, and had moved the conversation on to Brittany and Matt. They revealed that they had only been living in their house for a little over a year, and had never met the previous occupants of Dean and Castiel’s house. They’d heard rumours about something strange happening there, however, and were quite disappointed when Dean insisted that they hadn’t encountered anything out of the ordinary.
“It might make them a little sad,” he explained, “but I think they’ll be okay once we tell them about your new teacher.”
Sam looked between the two of them again, before a huge smile broke out on his face. “You mean to say the two of you-”
“But you said Jack needs new shoes. It’s okay. I don’t care.”
“Sooo… we’ve got a little over twenty-four hours to kill. Wanna see how many times we can have sex before Sam gets here?”
“Yeah. You cook better than daddy does and you make daddy smile.”
“I’m such a dumbass,” Dean said, reaching out to take Cas’s hands in his. “I’m so sorry, Cas. I shot you down because I didn’t wanna hear you say you didn’t mean it in a romantic way. I,
wouldn’t have a problem with it. But Dean couldn’t pretend to be gay… with Cas; not when he had all of these inappropriate feelings for the angel. And Cas, he’d sacrificed his life for Dean after telling him he loved him, but not in that way, obviously, and things were awkward enough between them already. What if them living together and pretending to be a couple, made their already strained friendship even worse?
“Yes,” Cas replied calmly, as Dean sat frozen in place, his mind whirling with all the reasons this was a terrible idea.
was he about to ask Jesse and Cesar to risk putting themselves in danger, and as for Claire and Kaia… he’d rather poke out his own eyes with a spear than let them use themselves as bait. “What the hell are we supposed to do then?”
He didn’t know what he was planning to say to make things right. He felt awkward enough just trying to form the correct words to apologize for overreacting. How was he supposed to bring up laying down house rules with Cas? Cas was a fully grown adult who had been raising Jack and Claire without any of Dean’s assistance for years. Cas was the one who knew Claire and Jack better than Dean ever would. Cas was the one who established rules and discipline. Who was Dean to try and question any of what Cas had already established with the kids?
“Mommy! I miss you!” Jack declared the moment Kelly opened the door. She had a smile as wide as the world when she spotted her kids and flug open her arms as they both rushed to her. As soon as greetings were over, the kids both rushed to their rooms, arguing over who would get to pick the movie after dinner.
Sam shook his head sadly. “As if the LGBT community doesn’t get enough shit already, now it looks like we’ve uncovered a homophobic ghost too.”
“Dean,” they went to protest, which the man on the other end of the phone clearly expected.
“Good shot,” Dean said, then asked, “You nearly done?”
He didn’t know how to broach this subject. How was he supposed to tell them all that they were kind of a mess and needed to be better about cleaning up after themselves? He tried to reason with his own thoughts, remembering each time Cas came back home and told Dean he’d been planning to clean up. Dean just couldn’t wrap his head around how it all got so messy. Wouldn’t it be easier if lunches were packed the night before? If they picked out their clothes the night before and prepped their backpacks by the front door?
“Claire, is it okay if Dean and Sam take your bed out?”
It was hard to believe that it had only been a few days ago, and so much had changed. It felt even more like they were deceiving Mimi with their performance, and it was yet another reason for him to feel like he shouldn’t be there. In fact… maybe if he left, Dean and Mimi could start a relationship. Just like when they’d visited Mimi at her house, Castiel noticed how she was obviously attracted to Dean, and Castiel was convinced they were just each other’s type.
“I got in a road accident… was unconscious for weeks, and when I finally woke up and opened my eyes, the first thing I saw was this angel.” David reached out and touched Patricia’s cheek, and they smiled sweetly at each other.
We're almost done!
“You should get this one too, since it’s your favorite color.”
Jack pulled Castiel by the hand until they were in the kitchen where Dean was caught sneaking an oreo. Dean was quick to hide it behind his back before Jack could see it and thankfully stashed the rest of them away. As Dean turned back around Castiel worried for a moment about what Dean would think but when Dean’s eyes landed on them they widened almost comically.
“Fuck, Cas,” Dean said huskily, his lips red and eyes dark with desire as he leaned back in for another kiss.
Castiel frowned and shook his head. “How could healing you be a waste? You’re the most important person in the world.” Dean looked like he was about to argue, so Castiel placed his hand over Dean’s mouth, before continuing,
The teenager seemed hesitant to believe Castiel’s exclamation but still pointed over their shoulder towards the bane of Castiel’s existence.
This seemed to be exactly what Cas wanted to hear. “Thank you,” he murmured, “and thank you for letting me do this.”
“What happened?”
Not being a parent himself, Dean couldn’t speak to the feelings swirling through his friend but he could empathize with being away from his family. Castiel was a great parent, Dean wholeheartedly believed that, and this change on top of everything else must’ve hurt.
“I know I already told you this, but you seriously look beautiful,” Dean whispered.
“I found a box of letters, and me’n Cas read ‘em. Love letters, we thought they were from a woman, but there was a photo at the bottom, and it was two men. He had to hide ‘em, ‘cause it was illegal, and William… that was his name, I thought you might wanna see if you could find anything about him. He might’ve been one of the victims.”
Castiel opened his mouth to apologise, but an announcement from Brian that there was a ton of chicken that needed eating distracted everyone. Letting go of Castiel’s hand with what seemed like extreme regret, Dean went and got in line for the chicken, along with almost everyone else.
“He is, isn’t he?”
It was obviously the right place, because Cas nodded and gave Dean a shy smile before making his way over there, with Dean following behind.
As he thought about this fundamental change in the way Cas viewed the world - and the almost amusing realisation that he’d been telling himself that Cas was different because he was an angel just the day before - Dean mused on how it had actually begun a long time ago. According to Cas, it was because of Dean, but he was struggling to believe that. Before the Empty took him, Cas had said that Dean had changed him, and that he cared about the world because of Dean, but that couldn’t be right. He knew he wasn’t exactly a role model, and he was convinced that if Cas had raised Sammy from Perdition first, it would be them that had the profound bond, wouldn’t it?
Walking into the apartment felt like a fever dream. For the first time in their life, Castiel was thankful the kids were with their mother. This moment wasn’t one Castiel wanted their children to see them in. Not as they slipped to the kitchen floor and tucked their head to their knees, feeling the whole weight of the world crushing all of their stability.
