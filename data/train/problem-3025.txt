“I’m—”

drink had swallowed John whole, this had been his favorite spot to make it up to his boys.
“Of course,” Cas said, at the same time Dean said “we’re good.”
“Would you two like to sit with us?” Cas said, hoping to defuse the situation. Dean shot a lethal glance his way.
“I’ll make you some dinner.”
to be safe too.”
“She’s dead. Sammy didn’t give details.”
The man pulled out a small pink plastic tongue depressor and hand sit over the small bag. Sam’s hands shook so much he can barely un-knot the twisty. It really is only a tiny bit, barely a hit, but he guesses that’s the point.
“I didn’t, honey. I just thought he should have a few minutes to talk to Bobby.”
"I want to look...presentable."
“I just...I wish I could tell him I get it now.”
“You’ve got Cas.”
Dean smiled ever so slightly, his face full of love and understanding, and Cas felt his heart swell when he leaned in and kissed him, gently.
“I’ll bring the good carbs.” Anna blushed a bit. “Thank you, Cas. I...I’ll be on time.”
“You too.”
Sam fell instantly silent at that, staring at the TV with unnatural interest. At the next commercial break, Dean hit ‘mute’ on the remote and said “alright—spit it out.”
“The things I can," Missouri said seamlessly. And—” she looked to him.
“I don’t know that.”
Dean had made beef stew. Not terrible tasting—and marvelous smelling—beef stew, with warm Italian bread and a big block of cheddar to go with it. Cas had been quick to point out “look! There’s carrots and celery and onions—vegetables!”
“Cas, don’t!”
“Dean,” Sam murmured. “This isn’t on you. I have to...learn. How to deal. Without you.”
And, for the first time since Cas had first gotten that call, he saw it: Sam’s legendary anxiety. Of course he didn’t want to leave Dean’s side: he’d left Jess’ to go to the library, and Maddy’s so she could go to work, and their father’s so he could live a life free of pain and violence.
Dean crossed the room and slammed the laptop shut. “No way. We’re doing this old school. You and me and the road.”
“I know you will. But...don’t you think it’s fair that Cas would be freaked to see you do that? I mean...you haven’t hurt anyone or stolen anything since you met him.”
For a minute, Sam tensed, seeing Cas register this. Seconds later, he smiled, recognizing the teasing, and met Dean’s eyes.
“What, this is our fault? What the hell are we supposed to do when he’s locked up like this is Goddamn Alcatraz and he’s friggin’ Al Calpone!”
But, doctor aside, he could be a good friend. He could fix up the bed and bring changes of clothes and permitted toiletries and pretend that none of this hurt. Dean had showed him the way, and it was a path he’d readily follow.
“But you and Sam...you’re okay?”
Cas did something he hadn’t since childhood: he turned and pressed his face into his brother’s neck. And then, finally, he cried. He cried for Dean, the man he'd fallen in love with, who'd never had the chance to explore his potential. He cried for Sam, the adopted kid-brother who'd done things so far beyond his comprehension that he couldn't even properly support him on a logical level. He cried for Gabriel, in love with a woman who would, he was sure, never accept him with the Dionysian lifestyle he lead.
“Sam?” a familiar voice asked. Cas’ friend—Peter. Doctor. Balthazar. “Are you alright? What are you here for?” The doctor approached him, frowning when he saw blood on Sam’s hand and shirt. “Are you hurt?”
“Ellen, I’m sure everything’s fine,” he soothed.  “Sam and Dean rely very much on you both, and I don’t believe for a moment that Bobby would ever intentionally run down Dean. I’ve seen countless accidents between family and friends since I started working in medicine. My brother still tells the story of the time our brother Lou tried to ‘teach him to fly’ and they both broke limbs.”
“I could eat.”
“It’s his expertise,” Sam grinned.
“It’s Andy’s.”
“With mayo?”
Sam couldn’t let the mutually shared stubbornness of his blood and adopted brothers keep them from having the relationship they’d always wanted. He
“You think you can talk him down?” Sam asked. Andy beamed.
, Sammy.” Dean softened his voice. “I am. We’re fine. You ain’t heavy—you’re my brother.”
—and now—Jess—
“My whole damn life is reliant on charity. I’m not taking it from you.”
“Morning!” Ava chirped. Ava does not speak: she chirps, squacks, caws, and, on occasion, squees. At least, that’s how Andy described her. He said the sound of her voice made his eardrums hum, like a dog that could hear frequencies unknown to humans.
"She said your last boyfriend hit you."
“Don’t worry,” Sam assured, patting Dean’s arm. “They’ll be by now that you’re awake and your fever’s down.” His hand lingered a little too long before withdrawing: enough that Cas could see Sam’s fingers were shaking.
“Quit being a dick,” Bobby barked. “We were here every day when your Daddy damn near killed the kid. We gave you that car, we co-signed your lease, hell we pretty much paid off your co-pays. And we don’t warrant a friggin’ text saying that he’s in rehab for cocaine and
Dean’s rolls, groans, burns with fever. The doctors—his colleagues—strap his arms down so he doesn’t pull himself free of traction. Cas sits dutifully by the bedside, but Sam—Sam leans over his brother, dabbing his forehead, talking softly, telling him everything is fine and not to worry. He stares at the monitors and demands that the nurses and doctors insure his brother isn’t in pain.
Dean’s eyes glittered, as warm and bright as ever. Sam’s, still damp, seemed to do exactly the same. And when Cas slid onto the mattress beside them and completed their little “litter of awesome,” as Dean put it, he liked to think when they looked at him, they saw just as much love shining back.
“Dude, you are going to
“I’ll go. Get Sam. He shouldn’t get a phone call. I’ll stick him in the car and get him here.”
Sam shot upright, gasping, heart racing, trying to walk himself through the deep breathing Cas had taught him, the focusing exercises he’d learned in groups and with Missouri. It was no use. This is how he felt after losing Jess and Dad, after leaving school. He couldn’t think, couldn’t calm down, couldn’t bear a life of constant grief and anxiety. Missouri had helped him understand what drugs had helped him do: fill the voids of lost confidence and faith he’d had when he arrived at college. When he’d met Jess. When lawschool and children and a life of peace for himself and his brother was
“Dean?” fast, harsh breathing—Sammy in a panic attack.
. Which all decent members of society should. Also, we believe it’s barbaric to pee in front of someone standing a few inches away without a divider.”
“Alright. You heard that. Off you go.”
“Well then, hang up!”
She’d made him cookies when he finally cut off the sonofabitch.
“The hell you will. You told me you’d fry it!”
“Yeah,” Dean soothed, taking over Sam’s mantra. “Yeah, Sam We’re gonna. We do. This is the worst of it. You’re off the street, out of lock-down.” He coaxed Sam’s head under his chin. “C’mon, bud. Y’gotta trust me this round. Just like you used to.”
“I thought you were going to be single for awhile.”
“You’ve given just as much—
“It’s Cas,” he mumbled. Silence. “Sam? Y’okay?”
Sam stared at the floor of her office. Plain linoleum. Scuffed from the shoes of so many addicts before him. Scuffs he’d added to, and would be seen, by all those following after.
“He won’t.”
“Are you out of your mind?” Dean’s voice was rising slightly. “We’re going to tell the cops that a former drug addict claims he was assaulted while prostituting himself to a dealer?”
“I’m not sure,” he admitted. “I don’t want to seem insensitive by making reservations at a bar. I also don’t want to deny him the best hamburger around because I assume he’ll relapse.”
“Raised you, took care of you, been your best friend forever. I know, Sam. We’ll talk tomorrow, alright? I love you, I do. But I can’t look at you right now.”
“I’m—” Sam’s voice wavered. “I’m just trying to thank you, man.”
“No.” Sam blushed. “I don’t want to...show off. I just...wanted to...show I was willing. I was working.”
“It’s so great to meet you too,” she said warmly. “Sam? This is Cas.”
Morgans, it seemed, had many advantages. But being loved was not among them.
“Shhh,” Dean soothes, pressing Sam’s head against his thigh and smoothing his hair. “I know, buddy. Don’t worry.”
Cas has a double scheduled the next day. It’s not until he’s well into the second shift that Balthazar approaches, looking surprisingly serious, and begs for a word. Cas circles back to him an hour later and Peter tells him that Fitzgerald McCloud of the Pub was found early this morning in an alley, beaten close to death, with packets full of heroin and cocaine stuffed in his pockets. When he recovered, he’d be looking at charges of possession, dealing, trafficking, potential money-laundering, and there were other whispers, about drugging minors, about prostitution, about tax evasion, and Peter just doesn’t understand, doesn’t understand, doesn’t understand.
Cas felt, for the first time since he’d heard of McCloud’s assault and arrest, close to tears. “It’s a dark picture, Gabriel,” he managed.
either.”
Sam felt heat in his face and smiled. “Andy—”
intended for him, somehow Sam was playing it infinitely better.
“Dean, I swear, I’m not using or drinking or anything. You can check with Alan, they tested this week.”
“I don’t know what I am around her, kid.” He tossed back his second glass. “But whatever it is, it sucks.”
his brother, and goes limp. Dean’s a warm, solid force over him, gently freeing his wrists, smoothing back his hair. “I know, buddy. I’m here, we’re alright. Easy does it.”
The halfway-house was important to him. It was compliant with his program. It was filled with people living the challenges he’d faced. It was out of the way of Dean and Cas. But under the covers, with the sound of his brother and pseudo-brother’s soft voices as they moved about in their room, he suddenly ached to stay put. He wanted out from the constant, 24/7 monitoring, the checks, the incessant platitudes. He wanted to be in a place where people treated him normally, where support was readily available but never forced, where he could, for the first time, leave behind the bubble of treatment and return to the real world. He could keep an eye on Dean and Cas. He could help clean the house and do the laundry and pay rent. He could run errands and cook dinners. He could, maybe, go back to school.
see jail.” McCloud’s eyes were widening further. “And if you out me, I guarantee my brother will turn over pitch perfect testimony in seconds.”
“MIA, per the usual.” Gabe grinned to lighten the sting that left on both of them and tossed an arm around his brother’s shoulders. “Damn it’s good to see you back here. The boys good?”
Sam swallowed, hard. “Um...would it be alright if we...maybe...didn’t talk about this for awhile?”
“Very good, thank you. My brother Gabriel...he needed me. But he’s well now.” Cas had never been a good liar. But Anna just smiled.
Dean would have called him every name in the book if he’d known, but Cas finally felt a previously unrealized sense of security. He hadn’t dared imagined a life without Dean, other than to sooth Sam’s panicked delusions, but, not that he had, he felt a larger purpose: whether it was soothing Sam’s terror or allowing the younger Winchester to support him, together, they could somehow survive the horror of the loss of Dean. And, while that loss was still a horrific scenario Cas couldn’t bear to envision, the surety of Sam at his side soothed him.
“No. You know we’ll find each other. I find you, you find me. I come back, you come back.”
And then, out of the blue, Sam shot upright, eyes widening, the monkey crushed beneath his elbows. “Is Dean coming back?” he asked.
“You gonna stand on ceremony? Or you gonna come in and get on your knees and beg my forgiveness?” Dean teased. Bobby flinched slightly, and Ellen glanced at her husband before turning back to Dean.
“I do.”
Dean could have slugged him in the pub on principal. It was only the desperate efforts of Cas and Peter Balthazzar that kept him from doing so. The second Sam had swung himself half into Dean, the elder Winchester had known something was terribly wrong. Forget big brother instinct: Dean knew people. And he’d known McCloud was a slimy piece of scum from the second he’d slithered up. He’d attempted to tolerate him because, for whatever reason, Cas had an attachment to Peter Balthazzar. And, though he loved his bright-eyed, serious-minded boyfriend, he sometimes felt he was guiding an emotional child.
He had nothing to do but wait.
“Sammy,” Dean cajoled, “he didn’t know Cas. He knew that crazy Brit doc-friend of his. His name is Fitzgerald McCloud and now he knows you’re Sam Winchester. And you’re lying to me. Why? I thought we were passed this.”
“I don’t—I don’t want you to go thinking—in case anything—”
“You can be late.” He smiled, hoping it was as warm as he wished. “We don’t mind.”
“Cas...where’s your head?”
“What happened?”
“Bro, we can talk this through okay? But you gotta put. That. Thing.
Sam mumbled something that sounded like “share Cas’.” Dean swore under his breath, but smiled as he did, especially when Sam reached over and snagged a few fries, chewing happily. It was all signs of a good day, and the old behaviors of sharing everything—with the exception of Dean’s car and Sam’s laptop. Growing up as they had, they’d often compromised, shared, and made do with what they had. Territorial they’d never been: quite a revelation to Cas, whose brain was stuffed full of the invisible borders his brothers had laid throughout their mansions.
“Bull.” Gabriel grabbed up a fritter and chewed it like a french fry. “Don’t get me wrong—mi casa es su casa. I’m really happy you came out. But it wasn’t because you missed me that bad. You wanna tell me what’s up?”
“He’s got a full-ride at the best private school in three states,” he’d bragged, “could’ve gone anywhere, but he wanted us to stick together and get our own place. Got a smokin’ hot girlfriend whose way too friggin’ good for him, and on track to another full-ride, to law school.”
“Well it’s about friggin’ time you two got it together. Sam, we’re having Bobby and Ellen over for dinner tomorrow and we want you there.”
“Giving is the reason for the season!” Dean barked. Cas lead them past their over-the-top Christmas tree that was jammed into the corner and up the steps. He’d been woken early this morning to Sam and Dean bickering and swearing at each other as they wrestled it through the door, and the brothers had been going at full-throttle ever since. He could see how people thought they could be a little off their rockers: one minute they’d be quietly moving in sync; the next, shouting curses and threatening bodily harm; the next laughing and reminiscing over some childhood memory; the next, bitching over some unresolved childhood fight; the next, slumped together on the couch looking like two puppies bedding down.
Sam turns and looks at his brother. Dean is younger looking in sleep.
“He was defending his own.”
He didn’t.
“No. My phone’s in my bag back at the house.”
“You’re the world’s
“Thanks. Thanks, man.”
“Little over two days. Don’t worry, it’s normal. They gave you the super-drugs. All courtesy of Anna. She and Cas have been all over it.” Sam smiled.
Sam opens his eyes. He’s on the pull-out couch at Dean’s and Cas’, the streetlights coming through the front windows. Dean’s beside him, rubbing his head, a broad hand on his chest, anchoring him in place.
, and not the other way around, just dutifully swallowed his own pride and, up into his early teens, would find his way to Dean’s bed on his big brother’s worst nights.
“You mean your house.”
do well when he can’t move around like he’s used to. The garage called Cas because he was trying to get himself under a car and couldn’t get himself back up.”
Dean’s hand found his own. Seconds later, his mouth found his own. Miles away, Sam was curled in bed, under the extra warm green blanket they’d bought, struggling and suffering. Cas silently willed strength and hope to him, and then embraced the one closest to him, vowing to all the absent others that he’d love them with all he had, across all the years he had left, no matter how hard they tried his loyalty, or however violently they assaulted his patience.
“But you
“Thanks.” Dean’s eyes softened. “Thank you, Cas. Just...hang tight. I’m not checking out on you yet.”
“It’s better than I remember,” Sam moaned, chasing a bit of chocolate through the melted vanilla milk at the bottom of his dish.
“About me?”
Sam smiled back. Alan had told him, quite calmly, that no physician chose this life without losing someone they loved down the path he’d taken. He’d never defined who, but he’d made it all too clear that he believed in recovery, and believed he could aid in it, and Sam trusted him.
“I left home, which is more than I can say for you.”
When Dean wakes and Sam tells him, he just smiles and pulls his brother close.
“Oh for—it was an accident. I mean, I know I called him a few choice words, but it hurt like hell.”
“All those years watching my old man, and I turned out just like him.”
Sam’s look went from kicked puppy to kicked, locked-out-in-a-thunderstorm-puppy. Cas spun on his heel and stalked off into the hallway.
Gabriel sighed and rested his chin on Cas’ shoulder. “Listen to me, kiddo. I don’t have all the answers. No one does. The system means well—I believe that. But...I don’t think it allows for the love Dean’s trying for. His is a little more than tough--it’s more jungle-like. If the situations were reversed, I’d go to court for you, with lawyers and spokespeople and gorgeous high-def shots of this face, because we have the money and connections and degrees that our word wouldn’t be questioned. Those kids never had that. And...in this case...they may very well have brought someone to justice who never would have seen it otherwise.” Gabe took a slow, painful breath. “For the record...if Kali showed up saying she’d done something like that, for her sister...I’d get it. Maybe it's a big sibling thing. But Cas...you're one of us now. And you're doing great. It's not just Dean that loves you.”
Sam was quiet for a long minute. Then: “Dad always ordered Coffee Chocolate Chip.”
“The courage to change—” Sam’s voice caught.
“Dean says you come from a pretty well-off family,” Sam said.
“You’re not getting out of that. I can type for you,” Sam teased.
“Please...don’t go until they make you,” he whispered, losing his battle with a tear. Sam smiled.
in the Emergency Room.” He left out the part where Dean had nearly given him a black eye for trying to touch him.
“Who is this?” the man said slowly, rising to his feet.
“Had ‘em on speaker the whole time,” Ash said. In the distance, a siren started. “Goddamn man. That—”
“Fine.” He didn’t mean to be short, he told himself. He cared, he did. He was just...just... “Why are you here?” he realized.
“Just hang up,” Cas said.
“No offense intended,” the Scot grinned, and took a deliberate sip of his drink.
“She makes me very, very glad not to be a nurse. And very, very grateful to the ones who are.”
Dean had stopped teasing him when he’d gone into treatment: even if Sam’s clinginess made him squirm at times, or even feel a rise of frustration, irritation,
Quiet for a moment. He heard the sound of more shouted voices, and then a soft, “is Dean there?”
“Hey,” Dean said.
The second time he’d gone down on the stranger, he called the garage where Dean works.
“Alright, Dean—don’t worry. I’ll alert Anna. We’ll have a team at the door to meet you.”
“Don’t listen to him, Sam,” Cas said. “The sounds he made when he touched it would be rated R.”
“Turn,” Cas said, in that automatic way that made Dean think
“I can’t believe he
He could do this. He could lie down and relax and not think about Ruby. Or relapse. Or Crowley. Or Jess and Dad and Maddy and Cas and Dean and Cas and Dean and Cas and DeanDeanDeanDean...
, he’d felt like
“I need sleep, a beer, and a good long lay. Not necessarily in that order, and not necessarily all while sitting next to my kid brother.”
“I’ll be there, immediately,” Cas answered.
Gordon had been. Gordon had been, because, every moment he wasn’t, meant that there would be some retribution: withholding of sex, of phone calls, of visits. Long diatribes about how screwed he was, how messed up, how only Gordon understood and how he could help get him where he needed to be if only Dean could stop fucking everything up.
“My ER?”
“You know...” Sam said softly, “Me and Dean...we always had a few people we could go to. Jim the Priest, and later Bobby and Ellen, and a teacher here and there. But you...you were the first to not tell us we were all wrong and messed up. You just...took us as we were. And I...I’d never want to...break that, Cas. You don’t just mean a lot to Dean.”
“Right here.”

“Sam,” he said gently, laying one hand on his shoulder and another on his friend’s knee. “I’ve spoken to Anna, my supervisor at the hospital. She recommended a wonderful grief counselor. She saw him herself when her Grandmother passed away. I’d like you to let me make you an appointment.”
family, Sam.”
By the time they made it inside, all Cas wanted to do was sit on the couch and have some slight amount of quiet. Or, at least, mindless chatter.
what I ordered!” Balthazzar barked at a nurse who looked ready to take a swing at him.
Cas and Missouri waited quietly until the end of their hour. Dean had an arm around Sam’s waist, as much to keep him upright as to support him emotionally. Alan appeared at the end of the hall, and Sam leaned slightly into his brother, damp eyes filling once more.
“Lou said you looked like you had Down syndrome until you were six months old. You kind of did.” Gabe took a gulp of Cas’ wine, made a face, plunked the glass down, and shuffled around until he came up with a beer. “But then you got all chubby and cute.”
“C’mon, buddy, you gotta calm down for me. I’ll stay, alright? I’m right here, Sammy.”
“I’ll keep you around awhile longer,” Dean grinned. “Night, Sammy. If you need anything, just holler for Cas.”
Dean glanced toward the smoke billowing out of the second story. Cas wondered, briefly, what had happened to the cat, and then forced himself to look at Dean’s steady features before he lost his battle against tears again.
“Feel...sick...” Sam gasped.
"You were baptised Mario Flood?"
“Easy does it,” Sam murmured. “It’s not bad.”
. C’mon bud. Relax. I know—you and I, life has pretty much never been okay. But it
Sam’s stomach dropped. “Thank you,” he murmured, and stepped toward the door. Andy grabbed his sleeve and hauled him back.
It was Monday.
“Yes you can. I’ll help you.
“This is our honest-to-God-date night, Sam,” Cas smiled. “In case you ever wonder about what we do when you’re not here.”
He was shaking, sweating, sneezing. His pulse was racing so fast he could feel himself struggling for breath, and his stomach muscles were cramping so hard he couldn’t straighten out. He’d fallen asleep—or, to put it accurately, passed out—in a patch of grass beside a Church that handed out free meals in the afternoons.
“I remember Mike taking that kid to town and getting grounded for most of eternity.”
“You didn’t?”

you want to feel better."
“Let me guess,” the woman said. “You’re Dean.”
Sam glanced to Dean, who tossed him an affectionate wink, before following him into the hall. The younger man’s hands were clenching and unclenching, and the lost, hurt little puppy look was back on his face.
Cas swallowed, hard. “You were alright for awhile after. But then you suffered from a very high fever.”
Cas’ jealousy gave way to grief. It brought an ache to his chest to think of his partner conditioned to respond to touch as a means of defense. And he felt another spike of resentment toward the younger Winchester, who’d he’d seen take Dean’s gentle ministrations as a given.
“No!” Even Dean didn’t believe that one. “No. I mean...yeah. But I’ve heard the spiels. I know I can’t.”
Sam began to tremble. His fumbled under his sleeves and started scratching at his scars. Dean launched out of his chair and grabbed his brother’s head in his hands.
. The harder he ran, the slower he moved. The further he reached, the farther away from the door he fell. The louder he tried to scream, the more air deserted him.
listen, to what these people in here are gonna be sayin’. Sam’s been looking up to you from the day he was born. There’s no better way to get him back on the right track than for you to hop on it first and give him a hand up.”
“Thanks! By the way—some blonde girl was around this weekend, asking for you. She said she’d swing by this morning. Can you work the information desk? We’ve had like, fifty people coming by asking why the books aren’t free to download electronically.”
, and the three of them laughing and teasing one another gently, and it was in these moments he missed his Dad terribly.
“Whatever. C’mon. Watch enough to drink your hot chocolate. Cas really makes it mean.”
“Sam!” Andy called, heading toward the kitchen. “Dude! What was that? You know the drill. Wave when you’re in okay.”
There were a few things Dean Winchester
“Buckle up,” Sam sighed.

“I am
“I’ll be back shortly,” he said, and made sure to shut the door so no one would overhear one of Dean’s closely guarded “chick-flick moments.”
“You need to watch your ‘Criminal Minds.’”
“I know you are. I’ve forgiven, you, Sam. I just want you to be well.”
“I’ll never see jail.”
“Of course—”
"Sammy," Dean murmured, smoothing his brother's hair. “I’m here.”
“Dean...I’m not thinking of using. Or drinking. I just...want to be here right now.”
. I promise, Sammy. Alright?”
"Jess—" his voice cracked. He reached up and grabbed his brother's shirt. "Jess is—"
Anna sat up a little straighter and focused ever-more intently on him. “What is it, Cas,” she said, in that way of gently demanding an answer rather than raise her voice in question.
“I know,” Sam sighed. “He shouldn’t yell at you though.”
Cas tried a few sips of the wine...but it did nothing for his nerves. Sam was laser-focused on him as if hoping he could make him explode just by sending hateful glances his way. Jess was warm and friendly...
“No! Dean, have some goddamn faith in me! I’d never—”
Cas turned the keyboard back toward him and took the phone in his hand. “I’ll call your brother,” he said.
“Yeah. And
But that’s what Cas did—that’s what Dean did. Looked after him without a thought for themselves. Gave and gave and gave no matter what insanity Sam laid at their feet.

the one who can’t.
“I will. I’m very sorry,” Cas wasn’t the strongest of the strong, but he managed to wrestle Peter into an empty room and shut the door. “This isn’t like you.”
“Cas, how about chicken parm? We all like that. If you call Alan and Missouri, I can skip group and help you cook it,” Sam said.
Cas had stayed awake, watching and guarding them both, for a long, long time.
“Then?”
“Ash, get something to tie Max’s hands with,” Sam snapped. He placed the gun on the counter, belatedly wishing he hadn’t gotten his fingerprints on it, and found some clean dish towels to bring to Andy.
“You are unbelievable,” he sighed.
“Godamnit, Sammy, that is not the

“Scottish,” Sam muttered. “And I’m not lying, Dean! I promised you I wouldn’t.”
“My friend Andy. Someone in my house shot him.”
"We'll get you sorted. Don't worry. Don't worry about anything."
“I haven’t...always appreciated you, Dean—”
“Of course.”
Sam laughed, wetly, into his brother’s shirt. “You’re a dumb, corny, jerkface.”

Dean arrived on the line, still swearing. “—then I’m gonna pull out its little intestines and—Cas! Call Sam!”

That horrid unease was back. “You okay?”
“Sam likes her a great deal,” Cas interjected.
“Sam? Your girlfriend is attacking our sex. Any thoughts?”
“What are you on?” Dean’s voice jolted him out of his thoughts.
It was humiliating that it took Gordon’s fist for him to see it all for what it was. What Sam and Jess had known and desperately tried to get him to see.
Gabe leaned back into his chair and slapped the computer shut. “Cas...I heard what you said. And let’s get this straight—you leave Dean, my guest room is your room. You go back? Call me when you land. You name it, you go it. I will always have your back. But...I like those guys. And, more importantly, you

"You're going to look ridiculous."
Sam was sitting up, in sweats, a t-shirt, hoodie, socks, and sneakers, all put on by himself. He’d showered. He’d brushed his teeth. He’d forced himself to get up and go to the nurse’s station for meds, instead of having them be brought in.
“C’mon. We know that’s when you lot plan your evil against us,” Dean said.
Somehow, Dean gets him out of the tub and into dry sweats and socks and a shirt—and Sam struggles to ignore the fact that his brother just
And Sam had briefly closed his eyes and indulged in the luxury of his brother’s unconditional embrace.
“Thank you, Cas,” Ellen said.
“Thanks, Ash,” Sam managed. Ash gave him a squeeze and drifted off, high-fiving nurses and doctors as he went.
And here he was. And Dean could

“We’re your family too, you dumb, selfish, sonofabitch. Get your head out of your ass and quit trying to carry the world by your lonesome. You know for a fact what you’ve been doing ain’t working. Sam may be the one who ended up in that bed, but your bags are stuffed just as full with crap you need get off your chest. And Cas—”
Sam was quiet for a moment, watching the television without taking it in. Cas snored. “He said...that I was a spoiled brat. That I didn’t appreciate you as my brother.”
“I was trying to reassure him,” Cas snapped.
“It’s true. Men who can burp the U.S. capitols are difficult to find in the singles bars.”
“Cas Morg—an.” Cas straightened and withdrew his hand quickly. “
It was like the Earth was opening up and there was nothing but darkness beneath him, and somehow, if he used enough, that darkness went away. And now, with nothing to use, he could finally see everything he’d been fighting off—grief, guilt, terror, confusion, pride and pain.
“And nothing you do—”
“I’m good.”
Dean dropped his arm around him and pulled him close. “I won’t leave you. We’re gonna figure this out buddy. I promise.”
that he would know a few tricks regarding how his brother ticks?”
“I’ll be back tomorrow, bud, okay? You hang tight until then. Maybe we’ll try and get you up and mobile, huh?”
Cas hung up with the Winchester brothers feeling a distinctive unease. He wasn’t sure why—he no longer doubted his relationship with Dean.  He’d reaffirmed his brotherhood with Sam. He’d felt a peace, and security, that he hadn’t felt since the night he’d taken Dean for burgers.
And Sam pushes his face to his brother’s shoulder and cries himself out while Dean holds and rocks and hushes him, and allows himself perfect comfort, perfect acceptance, because Rosemount taught him that what he advocates for others he needs to accept for himself, and he lets himself have it, and he refuses to feel ashamed.
“It’s alright,” Cas whispered when they seperated, “it’ll be alright. I’m here, Dean.”
“You shouldn’t—”
"All the half-off tykes and I get the one into bestiality.”
“Your brother,” the woman said as she shook Cas’ hand, “prides himself in being one of the only people living who can make me laugh And one of four people on Earth I allow to call me Kali.”
. My Father...I can’t claim he’s good. He’s absent far too often. But he’s never raised his hand toward any of us.”
“You’re gonna stay?”
“I don’t think you do. My family...isn’t a model of stability, as you know, but growing up, I was always told never to let anyone lay a hand on me, and if they did, to report it. I admire your sacrifice and devotion to Sam, but no one had a right to hurt you. You were a child, and I know you’d never hurt a child.”
“I will knock your smarmy ass back to the goddamn marshes it crawled out of.”
“That’s on him.”
So when Dean called for clean dishes, Sam did them. When Dean called for wrenches, Sam handed them. When Dean called for Sam to be downstairs, Sam went.
and he needed something to ground himself before he lost it.
“Sam, you haven’t slept. You won’t eat. You drink coffee like it’s water. And your nerves are shot.”
“How’s he hanging?”
“Shut the
But that didn’t mean, on occasion, he wished he could be different. Wished he could do what he saw other brothers do: turn their backs and let their parents deal. Or let them find their own way. He had a new man, a

"The little guy? He ain't so little."
“But he’s been gone awhile. Why...why did you send him away?”
“Are you going to leave Dean?” Sam asks. Cas startles at the thought.
"Hi all!" he said cheerfully. "Thanks for letting me crash."
unhealthy,” Sam grumbled.
He knew he’d hurt Dean: could feel it, even if he refused to turn and see it. Abandonment was a mortal fear of the Winchester brothers, and they really couldn’t bear another loss so soon after so many. But Cas really wasn’t sure, in that moment, if he was capable of carrying them any further.
“You have Thromdor.”

“Spare me the come-to-Jesus talk. I’m not the only one who’s sick right now. There’s dozens of us, and it’s on
“You don’t mind being there for me.”
Dean hushed him and spends another minute petting his head. Then he takes his brother's face in his hands, pries him away, and briefly pulls their foreheads together. "I'll be back first thing tomorrow. Okay? You get some sleep."  Sam nods, clutching Dean's wrists. Dean gently pulls himself away. "Lie down," he soothes, and guides his brother onto the pillows, tucking him in under his new blanket, murmuring nonsense Cas can't understand. He smoothes Sam's hair, smiles and pats him reassuringly. "First thing tomorrow, babe. Okay?"
“What? Why?” Dean asks.
“I’m fine Sam.” Dean insists rubbing his face and opening up his computer again “I just really need to find a way to get Cas out.” sneaking a look at the carving in the table.
Sam pauses for a moment, staring at Dean’s blank expression as he types.
“But, yes, that sounds great.” She says still smiling.
“Well that's a start.” Sam’s remarks trying not to frown.
Cas tilts his head again, “I’m confused.”
“Yeah, me too.” Sam says looking back at the door, “Let’s hope we can get Cas back.”
“I hope it’s something good, I always thought they’d be a great couple” Dean says smiling “And death can really bring two people together” he sneaks a look at Cas
“I get it, just please be careful.” Sam says, calling out the door to him.
“Dean, what was that?” Cas asks, breathing hard.
He watches his brother go up to Eileen and talk to her while they’re walking. Dean smiles to himself thinking about what he could do now that they are free from Chuck and hunting. But the crushing realization that the only person he would want to spend his life with is gone. Dean feels a peg of guilt, he never got to tell Cas how he feels; how he loved him too and wanted to be with him for so long. The pit in his stomach from before grows as he thinks about having to be happy while Cas is dead. In his moment of guilt, he also about what his dad would think. Not just about Cas but about Benny and Crowley, about the men he’s secretly been with over the years. After he left Benny, he went to Charlie and she taught him the term bisexual. Dean thought that was crazy when he first heard it, that he was close to Benny like a brother, just in a different way then Sam. But, had deep down he knew he was bi. Something he’s never dreamed of telling anyone but has always been implied. Sometimes he still hears his fathers words in his head-
“Miracle” Jack repeats and smiles at Sam and then back at Miracle. The smile they had before, where the light shone in their eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah I guess it is.” Dean repeats rolling his eyes, “We just got to keep looking.”
“Thank you Dean,” Cas says just like the first time he was given it, “I won’t lose it again.”
Dean quickly pushes them away as the blade starts to melt into them. Running deeper into the empty, he yells Cas’s name, looking around for him. He runs for what feels like forever but then, he finds him staring into the infinite darkness. Dean gasps seeing Cas again, his dark hair and trench coat covered body standing out  in the middle of the blackness.
“I guess.” Sam says looking into the crowd as well.
______________________________________________________________________________
Dean gets out and goes in taking his bag with him. Once he gets in he heads towards the back and starts the last part of the spell. He draws the circle and the symbols that Sam drew for him in it. He lights it on fire and the portal is complete, the symbols disappear and all that was left was black. He unzips his bag and takes out the angel blade and a little capsule for Cas’s grace. Dean turns towards the entrance and walks in.
“Yeah I get that, I just wish there was something more I could do.” Sam says.
This is a longer chapter, sorry
“Yes, I think that one of use can use a spell to go into the empty and take Cas out with us.” Jack explains, “Unfortunately he’ll have to come back human, but since the empty is weak and his grace was failing...”
Dean grips his steering wheel hard before putting Baby in park and turning off the gas. Looking down and taking a shaky breath before turning towards Cas, meeting his blue eyes, the flutter in his heart coming back. He fought heaven and hell time and time again but this was the most scared that he has felt in a long time. Cas straightens his head again trying to figure out what Dean was feeling. Dean could still see the confusion in his eyes though. Dean wanted desperately to say something, but not a word come out.
“Have you told Dean about practicing witchcraft yet?”
“Yes, I still feel that way.” he says quietly.
“Yeah, I’m finally ready for that beach vacation.” Dean says turning his head towards him, smiling.
Dean feels the blood drain from his face and he looks down at his hands shaking again. He had so much he wanted to say, so much he has kept inside for so long. He had been planning what he would say to Cas if they got him back for days now, but, of course, he always feared the worst. He was planning to say
It’s been about a week since Cas was taken and they defeated God. Dean has been spending most of his time reading about the empty, trying to find a way out for an angel. Unfortunately all he found could only get out humans, even opening a portal wouldn’t work. But Dean refuses to give up, even though it seems completely useless at this point. It really has been a long time since he properly slept, even before he started pulling all nighters he had trouble sleeping. His sleeps were restless and full of nightmares, just like when he was first pulled out of hell.
“I get it, but whatever happens I’ll help you, any way I can.” She says.
Castiel turns away and looks down before facing his head towards the window, taking a few moments deciding what to say.
“Thank you,” Cas utters quietly, “For getting me out.”
“Yeah Dean I've been thinking,” Sam says, laughing a little thinking about how well Dean knows him, “What do you think about retirement?”
“Well, my grace was failing before so I could feel things more strongly-”
“But Dean,” Sam starts making Dean look up from his computer, “we’ve looked through almost everything we have and we haven’t found anything maybe we should considering-” Sam says before getting interrupted by Dean.
“Dean, What’s going on?” Cas asks again this time with more concerns in his voice as Dean turns to him.
“No Sam, I already tried that,” Dean looks up at all the people walking around, “And Cas, Cas would want us to be happy, you know?”
“Ok, I think we’re ready,” Sam says, walking towards Eileen.
Dean’s expression falls into a pensive, thinking look. Eventually putting a smile on his face, he looks up to Sam and nods
“Dean… are you sure there’s not something else going on?” he asks.
Before leaving Jack gave him the blade that could supposedly hurt the Empty. Dean gets in his Car and takes a deep breath before putting the key in and driving. He has one chance to save Cas and he isn’t going to mess it up. All through the drive he thinks about what he’s going to say to Cas when he sees him. The drive there takes less long than he thought and next thing he knew he was at an abandoned burn, exactly 100 miles from the bunker.
Dean couldn’t hear Cas apologize again, especially for something he’s wanted to hear for so long.  He tries to open his mouth but he still still can’t seem to say it. Without a second thought, He grabs Cas’s face and kisses him. It is short and tender, but in a weird way, kissing Cas for the first time feels like home to him. As they kiss the guilt and fear he felt about his past starts to fade a little. Dean pulls away, still holding Cas’s face. They look at each other with wide eyes, both in shock. Then Dean finally said what he needed to say-
“Well maybe not fully, but yeah. We could help other hunters with our experience and help research or maybe go on hunts when we feel like it. But overall? I think we did good. We killed the demon that killed mom, we stopped the apocalypse, hell we even defeated God. You said that you’d be willing to retire when you thought the world was safe and I think it’s as safe as it can be, with Jack being God and Rowena ruling hell. There are other things I want to do now besides hunting. Think about it Dean, why does it always have to be us? I think we are ready to settle down and just… be happy.”
Dean’s phone rings and they finally part lips, looking each other in the eyes for a moment, before he picks up. Dean’s hands on Cas’s hips and Cas’s hands on Deans shoulders. It was Sam-
Sam followed him to the kitchen to find Dean leaning against the counter open up a new bottle.
“Yeah, I would guess.” Dean says, “We should be back at the Bunker in about an hour.”
“Listen we don’t have much time, I need you to take out your grace.” Dean says giving him the angel blade and the capsule.
“Me too, Cas.” Dean says closing his eyes and touching foreheads with Cas, “I need you to stay.”
“Dean, are you sure you want to go alone?” Sam asks watching his brother pack a bag, “It sounds really dangerous.”
“She’s… good, her and Stevie are going to New York for a vacation.” Sam replies, deciding not to argue, giving Dean a tired look.
Amara looks down for a moment-
“Yeah, I know, I just really hope he‘ll support it, you know?” He tells her, looking at Dean.
Dean couldn’t believe how good it felt to just kiss him and run his hands along Cas’s body. To think, 15 years ago he couldn’t even dream of kissing a guy. Since the day John left the hunt unfinished, since John shot him, he buried it. He knew what his dad would think... and do if it ever happened again. All the years of hiding and guilt, covering bruises and following his dad, had been leading up to this, he’s free from his father’s hold. Dean knows he has said and done some bad things in the past because of how far he tried to please his dad. But now he is ready to fully move past his father’s orders and be happy. And just like Cas, his happiness is them being together.
Crowley released the safety. “Silencer came installed. I could end you right now and no one would even give a rat’s arse.”
“You haven’t dreamed in awhile,” he said softly.
he?” Gabriel crossed his arms. “Look...I’m the first to say ‘stick it to the Man,’ but I’m not about a free-for-all. Unless it’s at a bar and I’m in the middle of the free,” he winked. “But if Dean hadn’t knocked that sonofabitch out? He’d still be doing this shit. And it’s
“I don’t think I ever will.”
“I’m sorry.”
“Is he recovering?” Cas asked dully.
“Man,” Dean snorted, “you are
"Brother, I do. Guess who just ordered a double-stuffed burriot and four margaritas to go? Give you a hint: she's on a show that starts with Sex and ends with City. Who's this?"
Sam smiled, ever so slightly. “Everyone in the state hears you, Missouri.” She grinned warmly back at him.
The man’s eyes were bright. “Now,” he grinned, “how about that kiss.”
The dial tone rang. No one had been on the other end.
“I penciled it in. I’ll deal with what I have to after,” Alan said, leading Sam toward the elevator.
“It’s her own take on a hot-pocket, but with pie. And, other than the lives of Sammy and Cas and my baby, they’re the only things on Earth I’d go to war to save.”
And he cried for himself, for knowing so many flawed people and having no idea how, exactly, to reconcile it all and love them best.
“Am I the worst person alive for saying that sometimes, dealing with this is
“Something you want to tell me?” he asked.
—for granted.
Sam hadn’t had that practice. Dean had learned to restrain himself, not to shout “I told you so!” long ago. It was agonizing, sometimes, knowing his brother would land on his face, but he’d learned the lesson all parents had to: knowledge and wisdom could only come from experience.
“Shove it,” Dean mumbled.
“No. Dean...Sam—”
. I know it’s not—
“You can.”
“Out with it.”
It was one of Sam’s bad days.

“Please don’t allow things to change. I’m the one who was in the wrong.”
“Anyway...I’m sorry to do this to you, but there was only one high-schooler on the pumps, and Jay was on a break, and when he gets back and sees that mess—”
Sam had never been to Cas’ office before. Cas lead him there, keeping a hand on his back or his arm, explaining the floors as they went, the various offices and waiting rooms, before unlocking the door to his own suite: plain, with two consulting chairs, a computer, a desk, his framed degrees on the wall, and a few medical texts stacked on the lone bookshelf. Cas offered him the seat that should be his own, and the phone, and took one of the consulting chairs for himself.
Cas would always be fuzzy on the details of the next minute. According to the Winchesters, John had drawn back his arm, Sam had lost his hold on his elder brother, and Cas had thrown himself between Dean and his father, hoping to stave off the oncoming fight. The next thing he remembered was lying face-first on the lawn, the blow evidently having knocked him sideways and flat. He hadn’t felt any pain at first, only a fuzzy confusion at the dirt and grass and the sounds of shouting above.
lunch was? A protein bar and a coffee I had while running across campus.”
Sam realized it was true. Cas kept his bright blue eyes on him and smiled, leading him to a set of chairs and holding his arm as they both sat. “It’s alright now,” he soothed, rubbing Sam’s arm. “Have you called Dean?”
. The
Sam slowly rubbed his elder brother’s fingers with this thumb, one after the other. “When we were kids,” he murmured, “we were so scared of CPS. They broke us up before, you know. We met this Priest, Jim—a Pastor, actually—and he really wanted the best for us. And he had a legal and moral obligation and all that, but he called in the state. And we were in these massive group homes, apart, for a couple weeks. Dean actually broke out—took off and made his way to me. I don’t even know how he knew where I was. But he got us home. And we lied. We told them we loved our Dad and he looked after us. And of course, our Dad lied too.” He smiled, ever-so-slightly. “There were times, you know, when Dad would stop. He’d swear up and down that he was sorry, that things would be different, that he’d never drink again, that he’d be there, that he loved us. Dean always fell for it, but I wouldn’t. If it weren’t for Missouri and my whole mess...I don’t think I’d ever have
“Didn’t you hear I married rich?” he said, with a wink at Cas. “Ellen, it’s fine. It hurt like a bitch, but it doesn’t now.”
“You and Cas are right down the hall. I know.”
.” Andy frowned. “You’re not some like…under-cover spy or a reporter or something are you?”
water-bong I have, and then I’d do a line or two and go get their lobster nachos and jumbo coconut shrimp. One time—” the smile abruptly fell off his face. “Wow...everyone here looks like they want to cry or kill me. Except you,” he said, turning to Dean. “You are full-on committed to killing me. You’re just trying to decide how.”
Cas feels vague flickers of envy and annoyance. He and Dean were both somewhat withdrawn emotionally: it was one of the many reasons they worked well together. And one of the reasons they were good at handling the easily agitated and frequently anxious, over-emotional Sam.

“Two.”

“The guy Andy’s always yelling at?”
Sam woke, warm and a bit disorientated, head on Dean’s shoulder. The Gremlins were in the movie theater. Cas was fast asleep, head on the arm of the couch, feet on the floor. Dean chuckled lightly at the screen.

"Yeah, yeah, we get it Pop, you can alliterate."
“I know,” Cas murmured.
Cas had thought he was prepared for it, but seeing the first-hand affects always destroyed his preparation and threatened to shatter his calm façade. Sam was pale and thin and shaking and damp-eyed and anything but the strong, calm, sharp young man he’d first met. Alan had told them he hadn’t been out of bed in two days, and it was clear from his dirty hair that he hadn’t been showering either. It lodged all potential comforting words in Cas aching throat to see someone who had once been so bright and smart and sharp be so weak and vulnerable.
Lunch consisted of fare Cas hadn’t tasted since their parents’ chef— Lobster Bolognese, smoked ricotta fritters, roasted marrow bones, lamb meatballs. It was oddly comforting and homey, as was the bustle of the city below them, the enormously polite wait-staff, and Gabe’s incessant, goofy chatter. Cas had no reason to feel ill at ease here.
being like you.”
Dean huffed against him. “You ever think about me in all this? Where I would be if it weren’t for my pain-in-the-ass little brother?”
“He’s alright, sir,” Sam assured him.
“How’d you get it?”
and his
Cas accepted a glass of champange and drank it very, very quickly.
When Cas noticed Sam trailing behind his brother, seeming lost and out of place, Dean always acted as if he’d asked Sam to be there—“hand me that wrench, grab a frying pan, dig out the Clorox”—but it was clear his sudden need to be near his brother was anxiety-driven. Cas saw Sam locking, unlocking, and re-locking the doors, checking the windows, pacing and checking until Dean would flop onto the sofa and call “Sammy, get your ass over here!” and get his brother to slump down wearily beside him while his older brother talked their way through whatever he’d found on Cable.
“Don’t 'but' me.”
Sam realized he was: his heart was beating normally, his palms had stopped sweating, and the evil voice in his head had stopped chanting. “Yes. Thank you.”
"Hey," he heard him murmur. "You want Cas to give you something?"
“What?”
Cas had never, in all his years jetting around the world, seeing the so-called-wonders, visiting and attending the nation’s greatest schools, greeting celebrities, seen anything that struck him as dumb and as profound as these two grown men finding absolute comfort and acceptance with one another, right out in public, without shame or fear. For the first time in his life, he knew he was looking at the bond of family: real,
Sam woke to a low light somewhere behind him, warmth at his back. “Dean?” he mumbled.
Cas stepped forward and placed a gentle hand on the middle of his younger friend’s back. “Sam? You’re always welcome, for as long as you want or need. Dean and I will always look after you. Would you let us take you there now?”
r what happens or how long it takes. Dumbest shit I ever heard,” he smiled, warmth and affection full in his voice. “Two weeks later, I’d busted us both out. Yeah, Dad could suck, but group homes were way worse. At least, together, we had a chance.”
“Thank you.” Sam accepted them both. He put the Gatorade at his feet and took a slow sip of the coffee, still avoiding Cas’ gaze.
he needed to push. He needed to stretch the limits of his comfort zone. Sure, he and Dean had been as passionate as they’d been in the beginning, this morning, but that didn’t erase the wake of destruction left by McCloud, or the fact that Cas had spent his life struggling to understand the emotional needs of those around him. If he was going to make it, going to truly join the Winchester family in their habit of patching together emotional strays and loving them as their own, he had to start facing down the emotional and psychological challenges they fought and conquered.
“I’ll need you to find me.” Dean tilted his head slightly. “I’ll need you to remind me where I belong.”
“I just feel there could have been another way.”
“No! Dean, please—”
“What can we get you? Bobby and Dean are gonna make a cafeteria run for us all.”
“So Gabe calls to tell me this, and then, in the background, I hear a female voice start shouting--she was there the whole time. Needless to say, he had to go immediately." Cas smiled. “Are you feeling any better?”
"I—" Sam's voice broke. "I want to go home."
“Well, I’m sure Dean will be delighted to know he’ll finally be introduced to my extended family.”
"He's forgiven you, Sam," he says gently. "He only wants you to be well, you know that. No one is more important to him than you."
“Right here, Cassie. City that never sleeps. Why? You thinking of coming home?” And, even in his drunken haze, his voice dropped to a more sincere, sober tone. “You okay?”

“No. If you and Dean get to share my mess, we share yours,” Sam had said, and smiled, shyly. “It’s good to see you, Cas.”
Dean turned the corner and nearly ran the cart straight into the last face he

“Sam,” she said.
Ruby. The dumb bitch Dean had hated from the second he’d eyed her. She’d dealt drugs—Sammy had never dealt drugs. She’d given attitude in groups. She’d rolled her eyes every time Dean asked Sam if he needed anything. She was just a dumb bitch and Dean didn’t care who knew it.
“He’s more the...snipe and run,” Sam said carefully, thinking of the few times Cas had given him a verbal smack-down. They always stung. And Cas was always so sorry afterward. Missouri had deduced, rightfully, that Cas hadn’t been allowed to express his anger or frustrations to anyone growing up, and learning how to do so constructively—without falling into the violent outbursts his brothers frequented—was an ongoing issue for him, one that they all needed to be patient with and help him feel safe when he
“Um...no offense but...you’re looking at me kinda gay.”
But here, under the blanket Dean had bought while he was new to Rosemount, surrounded by photos of him and Cas and even Jess and Maddy and his Mom, he felt a little stronger. A little more able to face everything. And, come the morning, he knew, no matter what his imagination said otherwise, that when he broached the topic, Dean and Cas would smile and tell him that this room, this bed, and his place in their home, had always been his. He never even had to ask.

“Dude, you didn't get this dressed up for
“You love Gremlins,” Dean prodded. “When you were a kid you used to go on and on about how you’d die for a Gizmo, except you didn’t trust me not to feed it.”
. Here I am keeping you alive, and you’re there looking at me like I’m some monster.”
Cas listened to his footsteps down the stairs and heard the car start. He waited until the engine had rumbled away in the night before he ventured down the hall to find Sam rocking back and forth on the edge of the bed. When Cas pulled the younger man into his arms, he lost track of who was shaking harder, and just held on like they were the only two people left on a vast, dark Earth.
Sam cries and cries and they know he hasn’t heard a word they’ve said.
Dean shook his head. “Asshole,” he mumbled, even as his hand moved through Sam’s hair and smoothed gently. Sam smiled.
But when he looked up at Sam, he smiled.
From: Jess
“Don’t you want it anymore?” he asked, voice cracking.
“His name is Flood?”
Sam’s eyes were back on Dean. “I only know some of this stuff. It looks like his heart-rate is high because his blood pressure’s low. And his temperature’s abnormal.”
“Late, bud.”
“But you stopped,” Cas reminded him. “For Dean.”
“Smartass bitch.”
“Of course.”
“No. Andy said he stuck around, checked with Ash—there’s no new curfew.” Dean rubbed his eyes. “He filled Ash in, and they’re gonna hang awhile, make sure he stays asleep and all.”

“What if I can’t take care of you?” Sam gasped. “What if I lose you, Dean?”
Dean started awake. Cas was pressed close to him, a warm hand on his stomach, breath soft on his ear.
The cops say, “you’re more than welcome to call a lawyer.”
Cas groaned. “I...fell asleep?”
“You got a ball to get to, Princess?”
Bobby huffed and stomped his way to the edge of the bed, then pulled a stuffed lion from behind his back.
let the Hamburglar live at the expense of loved ones. He was related to some of them.
Dean was a gifted man. It was technology that was stupid.
But once inside, he felt like he’d been dragged into the red room at the Playboy mansion.
“Potatoes aren’t a vegetable,” Cas had said with a long-suffering sigh.
“Sam off the wagon, is he?”
“Tired. Dog-tired. You?”
Gabe greeted everyone: parking attendants, doormen, the super, the plumber, the head of the co-op board, the hot woman on the fifth floor, the Jewish grandma on the tenth floor, the old man with the dog on the sixth floor, three cleaning women from varied floors, and his neighbor, a Broadway producer who promised him backstage passes and gave him a rough, manly hug.
He wasn’t sure how, but Sam ended up clutching him, face buried in his shoulder, and Cas did his best to hold him, focused as hard as he could on the love Dean would give if he himself were the one holding his younger brother, and then tried to hold on to Sam all the tighter.
“Yes. Very well. Thank you again for coming to our party awhile back.”
“Watch this,” Dean said, and poked Cas. Cas bolted upright like he’d been electrocuted, eyes staring straight in front of him.
“Whose is it?”
“Sugar,” Andy and Sam said at the same time.
“Found them,” Cas said, leaning over to drop several boxes of fake electric candles into the cart. “Thanks for waiting. I was worried I’d have to wander around for awhile before I found you.”

"It's good to see you, Andy," Cas greeted him.
“We pee, we wash, we go.”
