“Sherlock and John are no longer at the safe house.” The vampire informed his lover.
The detective had spent the last eleven hours scouring the internet for any and all information pertaining to anyone named Lestat de Lioncourt.  The search had proved most dissatisfying.  Like the lovely and cunning Mary Morstan, who even in death evaded his probing, this new stranger had as well.  He had found a great deal of information, of which took him hours to sift through, but all of it in the end was linked with a fictional character from a multitude of different books, most seeming to be penned by a different name.  It was all very frustrating.
John didn’t have to ask who the note had come from. He could figure it out from all Sherlock had told him of the girl, but the name still passed between them. A whisper that hung in their minds and the detective’s mouth quirked with the recognition he could see on the vampire’s face of this shared connection.
Once he had exhausted his available resources he contemplated his next course of action. There was one other theory he desperately wished to test but he would need to leave the safe house to do so efficiently—something he had promised John he would not do.
.  John's own warning echoed in his mind, words not to go unheeded.  The words alone had been poignant but John himself had truly feared what he could be capable of, even in this unconscious state, as he truly appeared to be.
Sherlock raised his hands in a plaintive posture, asking for some reason from his friend and time to explain.  "There is no need to yell, John, I’m right here. Your volume is piercing. "
Mycroft settled himself into the backseat as his faithful attendant closed the door before taking her own seat. The black privacy glass that divided them allowed him to not be concerned with perception as he brought up his hands to rub at the bridge of his nose and take in a slow deep breath, obvious exhaustion in his huffing exhalation.
Marisa gave him a patronizing smirk from over top of her china cup, as she made a derisive scoff.  "Ugh, please, Sherlock, you're so transparent it's horrendous." She paused to chuckle, before adding, lasciviously, "You want John back in your pants.  With this business out of the way I'm sure you might actually have a shot at it."
Sherlock was more simplified than that.  He didn't care what anyone else thought, what his family's opinions were, or what society accepted.  In John he had found a partnership that not only completed him in every way, but also that promoted excellence from his strengths and aided his weaknesses.  It was this completion that had been the desired goal of the ensued relationship, to extend that effectiveness to all areas of his life.  He had only hesitated from encumbering the doctor immediately upon realization of this desire and need, due the knowledge that John would resist it, because of societal inclinations, family history and disposition, and the thoughts and opinions of peers and acquaintances.  So in that sense the anesthetic's effects on his brain and on their relationship had proven to be anything but detrimental.
Louis probably wouldn’t explain anything.  He seemed to avoid conversation.
John snapped his fingers impatiently and scolded, “Quit pussy footing around this and spit it out.  Sherlock is not normal, okay!  Why is this one so dangerous?”
The shame that normally thwarted such thoughts was late washing over him and the force with which it normally drenched him had waned.  That did not sit well with John.
“My lady, you appear lonely.” The man held himself with the aloof air of someone who would never lower himself to menial labour. He was thin and tall, but Sherlock still had a couple of inches on him, with pale slicked back hair. “Might I take you for around in the gardens?” The man sounded like a pompous ass.
Mycroft sighed heavily, his mind a wash with this information, already attempting to make inferences.  “That does not bode well for my brother,” was all he spoke aloud.
As Sherlock considered the ominous implications of the other’s discovery John’s reaction was more immediate and predictable—flight.  The doctor had no grounds to fight this conviction on, not with the taste of blood in his mouth now, and so he ran, his fear receptors within his brain gaining traction as his mind failed to explain what and why this had happened.  In a flurry of limbs that Sherlock was unable to stop the other man was on his feet and through the door to the flat, bailing down the staircase two steps at a time and making a tremendous raucous as he did so.  Then the final slam of the front door to 221B.
“You didn’t even flinch. Good job, Lestat.” The tormentor complimented.
Louis’ grip tightened, his head dipped down breathing in the scent of apricots and cedar. It brought a happy noise to his throat as he inhaled deeply, this moment snapped in his mind. Captured and suddenly compared against so many others. The great temptation was that Armand had always found a way to put him at ease and drown you in the universe that was tussled auburn curls and burnt amber eyes.
With the lightning quick speed that only an immortal was capable of, the blond felt the other move, the whisking brush of the collar from his neck, the sudden iron grip of Louis’s grasp forcing his neck bared, and heard the soft crunch of his skin as teeth sank into his pale throat.  Lestat relented his own mouth’s pursuits in wake of his lover’s sudden play, yet even as Louis drew from his bloodstream he would not yield the grasp he held on the other’s hips, too enamored by this amorous change between them.  It had been years since they had been close, touched, kissed, adventured, but it had been decades since Louis had willingly taken this of Lestat.
The man’s large eyes, so dark that the brown was swallowed by the blackness of his pupil, widened in interest.  His mouth worked on the gum and he blew out a large pink bubble.  It snapped loudly as everyone watched, before the man address the vampire in return.  “Big words,” he said, pausing for emphasis, “for a vampire that got his arse handed to him only a couple of weeks ago.”  He raised a hand, shaking a disapproving finger back and forth at the blond, as he rebuffed him like a misbehaving child, “I told you once, Lestat, if you can’t play nice with my toy that I’d have to punish you.  I think you’ve earned a time out.”
John had not planned on meeting with Sherlock—certainly not like that—and now he had no choice but to remain close to the man, which already had proven quite torturous.  That thing was obviously otherworldly—that was still a notion he was not quite used to using—and the
Lestat paced the length of the balcony, bare feet on mosaic tile. This particular tile had been painstakingly placed by hand to replicate a few of the patterned sections of the Ravenna. Turning he suddenly snatched a large potted plan and flung it wildly out into the evening with a fierce snarl.
This man was brilliant in a way that very few could properly appreciate and he was utterly striking in a purely masculine way. John blinked slowly, body weaving slightly as he stared up at his friend. The man’s eyes were magnificent; bright blue iris, warm gold crowding into the pupil with a dark green limbus containing it all. Tri-coloured eyes, sectoral heterochromia, his mind supplied for him.
The scene changed, John was gone and he heard his own pathetic whimper.  It was echoing, as though it did not resonate from within the confines of his own body, but someone else’s.  The lids of his eyes felt heavy, drooping open and closed against his will.  What he could see was half blurred, plagued by bothersome black blotches that flickered in and out of his periphery.  The blond stranger was there, younger, scared but somehow still invincible, covered in blood and surrounded by the bodies of several wolves, with his hot breath pluming into the cold air of the snow-covered forest around them.
Sherlock was thrown back, either by the force of the punch or by John himself. His backside hit the tiled floor hard and skittered to a stop several feet back, knocking over a couple chairs in the process. Screams filled the air, followed by a torrent of rushing bodies, as the patrons attempted to escape what they surely could not comprehend.  The two vampires were brawling despite the crowd, a blur of explosive power that flashed about the café like a tornado, destroying everything it touched.  People were scrambling to flee, some getting caught in the wake of destruction.  Sherlock pushed himself back wanting to stay out of the melee, when a hand grabbed his arm.
John moved to direct the conversation but Greg beat him to it, shaking his head and admitting, “I knew something was up.  I knew something had happened, I just…I couldn’t figure it out.” He looked contrite, almost stricken by his failure.  “I had a bunch of other crap going down, the Yard was busy, and Sherlock seemed as stumped as we all were—which was the scariest damned part of it.”
“Oh, so I see you do know what time it is.” Lestrade fired back, gesturing at the man before him still clad in his dressing gown and bare feet.  “Dare I ask what you’ve been up to these last few days?”
There was a strangulating look of agony in John’s eyes.  It caused a pang of fear of this all ending before it had even begun—that Sherlock was hoping for and expecting more than John would ever allow him to have again.  He swallowed, trying not to contemplate the odds that rushed unbiddenly through his mind, when suddenly that look vanished.
“Likely correct, Lestat, but I don’t see how you lose anything by telling me about what happened when you first encountered Moriarty. In fact, I think you should be more concerned with him then with your latest fixation.” David was trying to be mindful to not use his scolding tone of voice but his makers reaction was much the same as if he had.
Three evenings later Louis had arrived back at the Baker Street flat to find a huge bouquet in the entrance on a small side table. Mrs. Hudson had come out as soon as she heard the door to the flat open, exclaiming happily, "Oh! These Lovely flowers came for you today, Louis!"
Blam-blam! The stillness of the flat was suddenly run through, as gracefully as an axe through a log.
“It’s okay. I was supposed to be home twenty minutes ago.” Came the unapologetic snicker from the other.
"Nothing." John said, snapping his fingers.  This chastening caused Sherlock’s indignant scowl to deepen. "Sleep. Think. Figure out how the hell Moriarty could still be alive, if he even still is alive, and find out what the bloody hell he could want with you this time."
The woman brought the cup down and swallowed, smiling broadly at him like he was a fool—maybe he was.  "Yes, I know." she laughed.
"My feelings for you." Sherlock’s breath was warm and sweet on his face, his eyes darting between John’s lips and eyes as he spoke.  "That's what others use alcohol for, isn't it? To say all the things they may not otherwise and to make themselves foolishly believe that they are somehow braver by the crutch of it?"
“Just one touch?” the detective pressed, wanting more data.
John leveled him with a stern glare and merely sighed, rigid with mounting irritation.  The detective pushed a little further.  "Or do you not sleep now?"
The memory seemed to repeat itself in his mind’s eye and the vampire thought for a moment that the physical pain that wracked his body was now too much. Even though he was immortal, he would lapse into unconsciousness, and Ludvik or Moriarty—whoever this was that tormented him—would win.
John made to remove his shoes and someone called to him from down the hall, “No need, John, come right in.”  A man approached him, tall and broad in the shoulders.  He was ridiculously handsome—as he was finding out many of their kind were—making the smaller simpler man feel slightly self-conscious.
Louis was highly intelligent and had dealt with the forceful whims of the blond monster for centuries. This decision had been calculated and executed with the intent to avoid Lestat. Apparently, Lestat hated Canada. Felt it was too sparsely populated and too boring for his liking. As ridiculous as the reasoning had seemed at first John came to understand that there was very good logic behind it. Edmonton was unlike any other city he had been to. It was a sprawling metropolis, boasting a fair population just above one million, taking up five times the space any other place would. The streets here were wide and generous, the houses large, the sky line not particularly crowded. It was a beautiful place, so open and free of the usual clamor and clutter of an older city.
Mary gave him a wink as she stood.  She reached across the desk and patted his cheek lovingly, as she playfully sassed her fiancé, “It is allowed, dear.”
The crunch of gravel, damp with the malodorous combination of rotting garbage and human refuse, seemed amplified against the bleak brick walls of the ally, as the dark figure stood with eyes intensely fixed on the large dumpster that occupied the space near where he had observed the two men investigating a few minutes earlier. The dankness of the location, the architecture, even the smells, if Louis silenced the humming of his amplified awareness he could almost imagine this was a street in any of the great American coastal cities, of which he normally haunted. The dumpster was smaller and the streets narrower, he thought as he straightened.  Bobbing his head, he moved to see if there was anything else his unnaturally acute vision had missed. The pale creature instinctively raised a hand and brushed away the stray ebony strands that swept across his face. Another scan of the ally reveled nothing outside what the handsome and eager genius had already discovered for himself and so graciously shared with his conflicted partner.
“I fear that Lestat’s interest in the detective and his doctor has only escalated.” Louis replied honestly, with regret, stepping back out from under the shops awning as canoodling couple invaded to take shelter.
Memories of John and himself, in this place, drowned his mind. Sherlock could feel the tips of his ears pinking with the rush of blood that flooded his face. Embarrassed, he coughed, responding, “As I have said before… I can make it any place I wish to conceive.”
Sherlock stepped forward, closing the space between them as those long, dexterous fingers released his arm and shifted to the hem of his sweater. The silence in the room made the situation seem more intimate than it actually was. “As you seem unable to accomplish this task on your own, I will assist.” As he finished speaking he slowly began pulling the material up.
The hot burn of the wound caused the consulting detective’s indignation at the one sided accusation to bubble up as he rebutted, “You
Yet his visitation had proven to be somewhat useful.  The young woman’s curiosity had driven the blighted conversation towards the itching scabs ever pestering him beneath the collar, the scarf, and the neck of his shirt, and he had conceded to allowing her the business of dealing with it.
The detective squared his shoulders and crossed his arms, continuing, “That’s why you have come to London, is it not?  To challenge me, because you are, and always have been,” he waffled his hand from side to side, as he finished that thought, “probably always will be…bored.”
Sherlock watched her, his curiosity and anxiety roiling under his calm exterior. He showed little tension although John’s state made him increasingly worried. This was the workings of a well laid plan, not of her crafting. Marisa finished and glanced back in his general direction. She rose and turned back around, moving back down the carpet. She avoided eye contact with him and silently took a seat on the pew left of the alter, like any religious patron might.
clever.” Sherlock gave his friend a cagy grin that earned him the delight of a chuckle out of John, before he elaborated, “He thinks he’s too intelligent to get caught…or too powerful.  He’s sought the best and never been caught so now he’s come to tempt the greatest.  I must be taking too long, that last one was sloppy.”
The images of that night rose through the hot rush of scarlet as the man now moaned throatily against him, hands gripping reflexively at David’s blazer as the vampire drank deeply from him with each pulse of his racing heart.
John lay there silently, awaiting the sun’s full rise to force his body into the unearthly slumber.  Sherlock too was quiet, moving about the room only for a short time before settling at the desk with his laptop.  In those moments, John did not worry about his friend.  There were many ways that Louis had taught John to conceal himself during the daylight hours that he could have otherwise employed if he so chose to. But he didn’t. Instead, he allowed himself to be content in the familiar and comforting sounds of the man’s presence.
Moriarty chuckled, turning back around to strike a feminine pose, knees together, hip out, with a hand brought gingerly to his mouth to cover the giggle. He waved a scolding hand at him, like a 1950’s all-american-girl turning down a suave gentleman’s flattery.  “Oh, Sherlock, we haven’t even disposed of John’s corpse yet.  Stop trying to ply me with your sweet words, you black widow.”  He opened his arms wide and laughed, “Besides, we are just gettin’ to the good stuff.  Let’s make a filthy mess of this fantastically holy place!”
John took the opportunity to grab one of Sherlock’s legs and hook it over his shoulder. Growling low in his throat he found himself going even deeper. At the first thrust, Sherlock’s eyes popped open and he cried out, “Yes!” It felt so amazing John wasn’t sure how much longer he could go at this rate.
The soft snores of the man faded into a silent irregular pattern as the light drew ever upward from jaw to cheek, and slowly to brow.  The closed eyelids twitched, crinkling to block the invasion.  The body of the man shifted, turning over in the bed to ignore the unwanted intruder. There was loud snuffle before lapsing back into a soft rhythmic pattern once more, content with a few more peaceful moments of sleep.
John let the words roll off of the other man's tongue, allowed them to soak into his brain.  He was both delighted, relived, and terrified.  He had wanted this, needed this, and now that he would have it, all he could think about was whether he should be concerned with it at all, when he knew that somehow Moriarty was still alive and a greater threat than ever.  His mind was roiling with all of it, the incident in the kitchen, the iron tang still on his tongue, and now this.  Still one fact remained poignant.
“Say something you bastard!” John demanded.
John cocked his head as he tried to frown. Instead, he found himself sight softly, his gloved fingers brushing along the perfectly cut hedges as they wandered. Eventually, John found himself stopping. He glanced back at the man who had been following along silently. His form weaved and coiled even as he stood still.
“Interesting theory.” The girl finally replied, filling up a kettle she had finally produced from an upper cabinet. She placed it on the oven, tossing a cheap tea bag into the waiting china pot.
There was a sudden guffaw of laughter out of the two girls that caused a few irritated and startled eyebrows to raise around them. Then the obvious ping of a text message, as the laughter and snickering was cut short.
“Call me as soon as the next one comes in.” Sherlock stated matter-of-factly. Reaching into his coat pocket he drew forth his mobile and the rapid sound of tapping consumed the quiet. Another moment passed before Molly began repositioning the body and bag before John recovered enough to turn and face the scene again.
“Oh Boys! It sounds like old times!” she gushed, delightedly.
"Yes, well, I was postponed." John explained, taking off the sodden jacket and tossing it over the back of one of the kitchen chairs, before he came to
Mycroft remained placid in the affront and coolly replied back in an even tone, "Ah but this time is different, Doctor Watson. So, if you value the name of the person who ordered the death of your beloved Mary then you should understand this is your only way of getting it."
“I’m serious!”
Dressed he decided to investigate the rest of the flat, finding that he was not in one.  He was in a massive completely outfitted penthouse suite.  He was in fact locked inside.  He had found an entrance that was fully locked down.  The door was metal and didn’t even have a knob.  The only other exit was a set of retracting patio doors in a wall of glass that opened up to a large stone patio.  As he walked out into the cool evening air he recognized his city below him.  London stretched out far below him in every direction, the street lights joining into one massive warm glow above the endless stretch of buildings and roads.
“Where’s John and who…was it that attacked you?” Sherlock tried not to get caught up on the feeling of the words heavy on his tongue, as they passed his lips. Instead, he focused on the importance of those answers despite feeling he was sure to be dissatisfied with what was provided.
Stubbornly he travailed, plugging away with his first two fingers of each hand, silently cursing his inability to find a way to incorporate the rest of his digits in his typing process. Plodding along, he soon was nearing completion, when movement in his periphery drew his attention away.
“What’s your theory?” John queried, his eyes noting the rent in the pig’s skin and muscle to be extensive.
“Undercover the whole time. You must have been planted years in advance. You took out two threats with one fateful arrangement of individuals.” The older vampire said aloud, drawing on his knowledge and experience with the organization to make his deductions. “You are a very good liar.” Lestat complimented the girl.
“So—Sherlock was back from the dead for how long? A couple months? And now he's gone again? So is the good doctor and the doctors cover-up girl-friend? Tumblr must be having a hay-day with that.”
“Like what? The football game, Sherlock? My cholesterol levels?”
“Now, now. You always wanted to be a famous actor, Lestat. Let’s see what you’ve got and remember, your precious Louis is where I will start, should you fail me. The first and the last to perish. Thoughts of peeling his flesh off, bit by bit are making me salivate already.” Lips smacked to emphasize the point as Lestat stared at the perfectly polished shoes in front of him, still struggling to regulate his breathing.
Hand stroking down to the base, he squeezed gently while nipping hard at the nipple between his teeth. He relished the guttural cry that burst from the man beneath him, panting breaths and unvoiced plea pursed on his lips. Sherlock’s fingers wound their way into John’s hair, fingers clenching and relaxing, unconsciously mimicking the pace of the immortal's fingers wrapped so perfectly around him.
Instinct drove him to fight back, to fend of the feral creature that attacked him.  He brought his arms up and between them, pushing back to no avail.  No matter how he struggled John did not give an inch.  The mouth he knew so well clamped onto his throat, to the wound generated, and he cried out as he was hauled bodily up into the couch.  The arms that held him moved to take his about the shoulders and back, fingernails digging through the thick wool of his jacket into his flesh, as the tongue and lips worked blood from him.  The sensation was the same as he remembered, the stinging pull of the suction on his arteries and veins, the hapless awareness of his own weakening form being crushed against the other.  Yet this was tenfold more painful.  The teeth gnashed at his broken flesh, ripping and licking and inexperienced, the greed driving the doctor to consume more.
The hand that splayed across his chest scored a trail across his abdomen, which caused him to cry out and jerk his hips back into the man’s straining erection. That hand continued to move, tracing patterns over his skin and across his hip.
“Fuck it.” He whispered, with a sad shake of his throbbing head.  He couldn’t think anymore.  Every thought hurt both physically and emotionally.  Self-diagnosis was never something that the doctor subscribed to, but he did believe it was the concussion more than anything that made his head ache.  It would be best if he just went back to bed.  Perhaps morning would see him feeling better and thinking clearly.
The detective paid him no mind, filling the air with another blam before John could cuff the damn yellow ear protectors from his curl mussed head. “Bugger off, will ya?!” he snarled, as he marched past the lout to toss a damp lot of brown notes into the sink.
The fledgling’s relationship with his maker had always been a complicated affair and this incident was just another poignant testament to that very tangible fact.  The blond had always been a man of his own, rebellious by nature, and untrusting of advice and authority.  He was his own worst enemy, heedless of the insurmountable detriment that could follow his fool-hearty choices, and those that tried to help him were always callously brushed aside.  It had been the ruin of more than one of the vampire’s closest relationships.  David would be damned if he would let his maker brush him off.
Moriarty had done the same thing, had he not?  How else was he to possess such powers—powers even incredible enough to best Lestat.  Although John loathed and despised his maker, he knew first hand what cruelty the black-eyed fiend could wrought.  Moriarty had been at best a sadistic psychopathic butcher when alive.  He could only guess at what evil consumed him now, knowing only that the man’s own dark ambitions would grow.  If this Ludvik wished to start a war with the supernatural powers of this world perhaps it was because of power-hungry, depraved beings like Moriarty.
Sherlock flopped backwards, the mattress bobbing with the sudden thrash of movement.  He closed his eyes, willing the dream to return, only to be greeted by infuriating blackness and silence.  He willed his chest to stop heaving, his breaths to slow, finding the task cumbersome.  As he did so, his hands pressed down the length of his torso, finding his cock still twitching, sensitive and damp from the fantasy.  It felt amazing and yet incredibly disappointing.  He had wanted it to be real and although it had been amazing, it was far from reality.
“I have said too much already, doctor.” The voice spoke, with finality, “I shall call again.”
The inspector turned on his heel at that point and left down the stairs.  A beer really did sound good right about then.  As he walked out of the flat’s main door, he was stopped by a young girl, who held a crumpled Starbucks cup out to him.  He tossed her the few loose coins he had in his trousers and left Baker Street.
At this range, the detective could feel the hot moisture of the demon’s breath passing over his skin. The man gave a huffed chuckle of satisfaction and pleasure. It delighted him so to have the detective at his mercy. Without warning, the man’s mouth opened wide, revealing teeth that were suddenly razor sharp needles, clustered together tight and dangerous. The tongue in his mouth snaked out, elongated and skinny, with a reptilian fork at the end. The flat awful thing reached out towards his face and Sherlock steeled himself, forbidding any movement or cringe. He could not give in to this torture. It was what the madman wanted, to see him helpless and squirming, the thrill of it would only fuel his pleasure and feed his demonic nature. The tongue pressed roughly against his chin, pulling upwards over his lips and mouth to flick the end of his nose. This repeated several more times, slow and terrible. The demon’s eyes closed with indulgence, moans of erotic pleasure rumbling from the man’s throat, as the blood was licked clean from Sherlock’s mouth and chin
Still riding the aftershocks of his orgasm, he watched as Sherlock rolled over onto his back and carefully pulled the condom off his still half hard erection. With deft motions, he knotted the end and tossed it into the rubbish bin beside the bed before closing his eyes. With another shift he pulled a small bottle of clear liquid out from under himself and dropped it on the side table, not seeming to notice when it fell to the floor with a thump.
But where was the man? John could see that Sherlock had been up—probably had not slept yet, he corrected—by the dismal looking cup of tea that had long ago cooled. He glanced towards the bathroom, heard the suspected flush of the toilet, and then heard a door open and close. Sherlock was in his room now.
John’s own temper rose to the surface, “I’m not making this easy?” His head turned to glare over his shoulder and he tried to lever himself back to his hands. That may have been a mistake, as he ended up forcing himself further onto Sherlock. John gasped, the genius now buried fully inside. He trembled, muscles straining and they both froze, the only movement was Sherlock’s hand around him, somehow still maintaining that distracting rhythm.
“What?” Her cohort sounded only mildly concerned.
His eyes went to the ceiling, unable to look at her any longer, as the voice repeated its haunting message.
“No,” John muttered as he stepped on the hem his dress. The action resulted in him falling over. He snickered again as he rubbed his cheek into the ground. Small things poked at his face, little sparks of ice against his chilled skin. He wondered why they felt that way. Ice would melt and become wet. What did wet feel like?
In a low whisper, Louis explained very gently, “I am going to bite you now, John.  Through the transfer of your blood into my body I will be able to link to your mind and through that link I will show you what I know of Mary’s death.”
“What the hell was all of that about, then?” John finally asked, after another frustrating minute in silence.
Anything would be better than puffin.  He took the container to the kitchen and fished out a plate from the cupboard, scooping half the curry onto it, before popping it into the microwave.  The first time it beeped the sauce was too hot and the lamb was still cold.  The second time he retrieved it the sauce was baked onto the plate and the lamb was dried out.  Still, he managed a few bites before scraping the remains into the garbage, still unsettled and unsatisfied.
The woman almost fainted.  She could feel her heart flutter with the temperature spike that the comment had sent through her system, setting her blood a boil.  It took her a moment to recoup her senses and when she did, she tsked loudly.  Spinning of her heel she turned away, her hands raised in frustration and almost as a plea to her ignorant tenant, as she scolded him and begged him in the same instance to quit with the racket and clean up the mess.
Again, John rolled his eyes and flopped back in his chair rubbing at his temple with a free hand.  He spotted his glass on the side table, thankful it had survived the miniature pillow fight.  He retrieved it and downed the last of it in a single gulp.  Then, through a stifled a yawn, he reaffirmed, "Right. No. Not happening"
To John’s horror the call had been switched to face-time.
John groaned at the delicious assault, his body burning with need and desire. Unable to help himself, he increased their rhythm, grinding their bodies together with a greater urgency than before. His hands ran down the man’s sides, sliding over each rib and caressing the sinfully smooth skin beneath his touch.
The detective could not remember the doctor’s tongue ever working such pleasure over his skin with such practiced skill, as his kisses moved to tickle the notch of delicate skin between the turn of his jaw and the lobe of his ear.  Yet his arousal spoke for itself.  John could surely feel it pressing so blatantly into his midsection that ground between his legs, as he held him prisoner beneath his mouth’s ministrations.  Swept away in the undeniable pleasure of the other’s sudden and unwarranted actions, Sherlock didn’t care how or when the doctor had picked up such intimate practices.  He didn’t even have a thought as for why.  He was only consumed with his want and his need for more.
Mrs. Hudson did not even flinch when hit with the rude comment that he had intended to push her away and the tension brewing between them in the air of the small kitchen was palpable.  She was concocting more things to say, feeling she had not properly voiced her opinion, of which Sherlock was still unable to completely piece together.  She crossed her arms, her faintly pink fingernails strikingly bright in contrast with the wool of her deep plum cardigan, the elbows slightly dusted with flour from her early morning visit to the baker’s kitchen next door.  “You know, Frank liked to get a little eccentric sometimes with his affections.  A lot of the other women he slept with he said liked the sensation but I never stood for it when we made love.  I’m surprised that John would…”
“That he most certainly can be.” John added. They both shared a laugh and John smiled for the first time since seeing the man.  Quickly, remembering his teeth, he closed his mouth a faked a drink from his cup. In his haste to cover up he moved a little too quickly and some of the froth from the head of the beer met with his upper lip.  The aroma was so strong that he nearly gagged as it flooded his system. In reflex, jerked back and the mug smacked back down against the table, sloshing out.  Embarrassed and concerned it may have been to much, John brought a hand up and pinched his nose, faking a sneeze. Quickly, he said, “Damn.  Spilled a bit.”
“You needed to…?” John’s voice was angry and confused, a hiss, against his neck and cheek, as his cock slammed into the detective with lust driven fervor.
The man shifted ever so slightly in the chair, again the movement seeming deliberately slowed even though his body moved in a perceptively normal manner.  He rested his head in his hand, fingers lost in the raven depths of his hair, his legs uncrossed so that his ankle was caught on his knee, a stance that suggested comfort and yet somehow was threatening all the same.  Why was that?  “Surely you’ve deduced that?”
It was rather difficult to concentrate on figuring out exactly what Sherlock did and did not like when all he wanted to do was plunge himself inside the man as far as he could go. But he restrained himself, wanting to hear Sherlock's cries of pleasure, wanting him to enjoy this as much as John was. He did not want the genius to regret any of this in the morning.
The doctor’s eyes rolled and he lifted his head from his hand, as he gestured a flat palm at the detective, in a querulous retort, "Then please would you care to enlighten me?  I fail to follow this vague logic of yours.  What happened back there in that alley?"
John felt that he was slowly beginning to understand the man beneath him. While the detective did enjoy his soft and gentle ministrations, it seemed that Sherlock very much preferred hard and aggressive. He would have to test this idea a bit more before he could be certain, but from how the other man had reacted to his hands and teeth he was sure that he was right.
Sherlock shifted, extracting himself from the tangle of arms only enough to look into the other’s face. “John?”
As his elder was waiting patiently for Sherlock to voice the concern he had so panic-strickenly typed into his phone a few hours earlier, the detective indulged him.  In a slow measured tone, which spoke of his impatience for this sort of game play at a time like this between them, the younger brother asked the obvious, “Where is John, Mycroft?”
“Very interesting,” the detective mused, leaning back in his seat on the couch, as those calculating eyes zeroed in on the vampire before him, “you really are capable of telepathy.”
He walked until the man stopped him. John blinked, leaning forward to look at his reflection in the shiny paint of the car. “Oh,” he whispered, his fingers trying to capture the shifting picture. No matter how many times he tried, he couldn’t grasp it. John began to snicker and abruptly sat down, uncaring of the man now cursing behind him. He touched the wheel that absorbed all the light, fingers rubbing back and forth over its side.
Louis' immediate thought was one he didn't want to entertain at the moment.  Even with the bleach and the water and the blood he thought he could also smell his maker, disquietingly somewhere in the mix.  Although Lestat had followed him across the ocean to the ancient city the other vampire had been incredibly adept at entertaining himself, which always raised a certain degree of suspicion.  His maker was normally very skilled at cleaning up after himself.  If this mess did indeed belong to the other vampire, concluding an exact reason as to why he would choose this time to be so obvious eluded Louis' thoughts.  There simply did not appear to be a clear answer as to why Lestat would engage in such activity, no matter what angle the other vampire considered.
With the other’s legs spread the vampire moved his mouth instead, nuzzling the thigh to the left with his chin and nose.  The flesh of the mortal body was so heated and supple, it was a pleasure just to hold it and lay kisses upon it.  David parted his lips and gently he bit into the soft skin, feeling the muscle tighten with the man’s slight discomfort.  The warm gush of blood that flooded his mouth was nearly overwhelming yet the flood of memories was just as erotic.
Sherlock was impressed and he allowed John to see the sly smile that curved the corners of his mouth as a deep satisfaction and pride welled in his chest—what was the colloquialism?—it the nail on the head. Even though it was a launch into the conversation he had been unsure how to start and was even more perplexed on how he desired to end, the detective waved a hand at his partner and then back to himself, as he explained, "Not anymore, John.  I solved it whilst you were enjoying the many pleasures of courtship, both in your home and on your way here."
“No.” the answer was simple, given with a shake of the other’s head.  “I just find that far more entertaining.  It would be such a pity to watch you die.  A shame really.”  Odiously, he continued to shame his victim.  “John wouldn't take that well.  I don't imagine he would last long.  He seems like the guilty conscience type.”
They said little else of consequence on the rest of the ride to London and when Sherlock finally arrived back at Baker Street he was thoroughly exhausted.  Marisa had been right.  It would take a while for him to build up his stamina to where it had been before.
John shrugged, picking up the pace a bit.  Perhaps he was growing uncomfortable with how much was being said.  Sherlock had a hard time comfortably matching pace with the man, even given his longer stride.  "From what I’ve been told, vampires come with different gifts and abilities.  There's a range in strength and power that has something to do with blood line and immortal age.  The older one gets the stronger.  If the vampire that makes you is powerful, you may have some of the same powers.  Something like that anyway."
"I damn well should." the doctor tried to insist, realizing after the words had left his mouth that he was already submitting.  An all-to-real feeling of dread welled in the pit of his stomach.  Somehow he just couldn't say no to Sherlock.
John’s jaw clenched and turned back to the man behind him, with a nod. ‘Yes, slow down’, he sent the other the thought. Louis stayed close, hands moving away, as John made a measured effort to slow down the task of fastening each button on the shirt. In his mind, he heard the returned encouragement, ‘Very good.’
Lestat had caught the sudden hesitation in Louis’ step.  He had turned to cast a radiant smile to his companion, ready to accept the gratitude for the gift that he had taken pains to have delivered and installed at such a late hour.  Instead he could see the flush of surprise though not for the reason intended. If he could have delved into the mind of his fledgling, he would have instantaneously had the answer but instead he had to come to it through a series of questions and avoided answers before he was certain.
The detective grabbed her arm roughly, holding her back from the door.  “I will leave now!”
“As if it were that simple.” John mumbled, turning from the man.
David was unsure what had happened and was even more shocked that it had happened at all.  The blow had knocked Lestat back but it was not enough to topple the powerful vampire.  This was still an incredible feat for a fresh fledgling.  John Watson stood between the detective and his maker.  His features were hardened with roiling rage, as he pointed a finger at the other, and snarled, “I’m not running away.  We are going to deal with this.  Now!”
The quiet that settled in the room was a hard contrast to the sharp yells and the pace that everything had happened moments before.  Coupled with the blood loss he was experiencing, Sherlock’s head swam dizzily and he closed his eyes against the swirl of the room.
Standing in the dimly lit room he observed the deathly still form of the vampire. John’s transformation was still extraordinary to the consulting detective. He found it incredibly distracting to more irritably and vexingly drawn to another individual. There had always been a quality about the man that the genius had found undeniably alluring. However, this transformation had not only made John painfully handsome, restoring a younger, stronger, and more vibrant look to his every feature, but it had also made him dangerously powerful. The Dark Gift, as the vampires had coined it, had given this regular man all the allure of a wild cat.  Grace, beauty, and an unfailing need to kill to survive. Before, Sherlock could concede that John held few gifts that were superior to his own.  Those, without standing included his social abilities, his medical skills, and little else. Now, however, John held a far superior set of skills and abilities than Sherlock could ever hope to surpass in this form.
They had tea shortly after and then she left the croft, quickly returning with the bedding.  She went into the one bedroom and went about the more domestic part of her chores in caring for her guest.  He watched her, more to study her and perhaps get a reaction out of her than anything else.  She ignored him, begrudgingly, glaring at him askance now and then.
The soldier muttered an expletive under his breath and lay there placidly trying to catch his groggy brain up on his current predicament. His muscles ached in protest, along with a new extremely annoying throb that pounded behind his eyes. Both were a result of the raucous commotion from the parlour below. The man cursed his luck, cursed his flat mate, and then lay there a few moments longer.
He lost the feeling of his fingers slowly squeezing about the heart in their possession.  Instead his hand felt the warmth of another, their fingers interlocked, white knuckled, as their legs pumped.  The only sound in his ears was not the sound of John screaming, but the gasp and hitch of his breath as they ran through the darkened London streets slicked with the ever persistent wet.  He remembered the pinch and pull of thread and needle, as John’s warm hands tended to a gash on his brow.  He remembered the smile, half-crooked, sitting across from him in their chairs by the fire, as a clients rambling was lost in his ears.  He remembered the glow on his cheeks, as they lay next to one another in the bed, both too terribly enthralled by the other to sleep, even though their limbs were heavy with fatigue.
John.  So different and still so much the same.  His body burned to be close to the man and yet also ached to be so far away from knowing him.  John was guarded himself, trying to keep himself removed from completely giving in to any interaction with him.  Sherlock wondered if it was simply that the vampire's concentration was on appearing mortal or if it was strictly to keep him from knowing and exploring.
“I need my mobile!”
John let up, giving a bit of slack. The purple disappeared to a red when Moran gulped down air like a drowning man to water. Music trailed into the air, making the harsh breathing of both men vanish.
John snorted, “That’s not happening.”
“Dear brother, have you informed your Dr. Watson that you are out of leads to find his wife?”
“You are doing admirable job of it on your own,” retorted Sherlock from the kitchen.
“Or did you walk the way you do because you are well-endowed.”
Violin music radiated throughout the flat. John sipped his tea, scanning through the paper, listening to pencil scratching as Sherlock decided on the notes. Every so often, he would offer an opinion, causing them to bicker. It wasn’t too much longer until John couldn’t contain his yawning. He didn’t bother to disturb Sherlock who was fully engrossed in his task. John brushed his teeth, went upstairs, changed his clothes, and climbed into bed. He drifted off to the sounds of the violin.
“I won’t be able to sleep without taking care of you first.”
A flare of ice went down his spine. Then he recalled what AJ had said earlier. Mrs. Hudson was the bait to trap him, so… “I’m the lure for Sherlock. You were going to hand me over to Moriarty. You were going to give him both of us.”
“Again, I brought copies,” Lestrade weakly motioned to the wall where Sherlock had tacked them up and was staring at the case files. Then he stood from Sherlock’s black leather chair. “It’s the best I could do. I have to get back to back to the Yard, paperwork and all of that before tonight.”
“But Merry Mollet didn’t have any known siblings,” argued Lestrade. “Her family history is her file.” The DI pulled away from Sherlock’s shoulder, moving to the cream-colored files on the end of the cluttered desk. -“Confirmed only child of Martha and Andrew Mollet, both died in a car crash when she was ten. Jumped around in the system until she was legal.”
“Very good. Now do what you’re supposed to do to begin with. I have places to be. I’m already missing my favourite programmes because of you.”
“So, we are… what? Holding out? Playing chicken? And what if that doesn’t work?”
The video went on.
The last of Sherlock’s words echoed in an unexpectedly silent room. Eyes of the Yarders stared at them. Phones rang, but no one made a move to answer. It seemed as if someone said freeze, and nobody moved. John nodded lightly to the stunned DI as Donovan approached the spectacle. Before she was close enough, he pulled at Sherlock’s coat, dragging the heavily breathing detective out of the building. Sherlock and his long limbs did not protect as they trotted along the corridors. It worried John even further, because when Mr. Punchline was quiet, things do not fair well.

“Dr. Watson-“
(See the end of the chapter for
“And he’ll understand?”
“You have no idea,” John murmured.
Gently, Sherlock tugged on his partner, nudging him to stay on his feet. “Do come along, John.”
Sherlock shook his head. His eyes closed. “Please, just go look.”
“I will say this plainly then since you do not see it. I will not tell Sherlock about Mrs. Watson, if you do not tell him about our conversations of Moriarty and what you’ve learned about our third.”
“Then listen,” whispered Sherlock. “Starting when the first shot was made, there were four possible scenarios. First, you could have returned fire, but on chance of hitting the infant, you did not. You could not guarantee the direction of his fall. He would have fallen over the edge or onto the rooftop, and theoretically could have crushed the child with his weight. Secondly, we both could have gone onto the rooftop, and you presented that you were armed. Cornered, either you or I, or potentially the infant becomes a victim immediately. Third, the infant is used as a distraction, thrown to either of us for a chance to escape, and as a doctor, you know how malleable small infant’s neck’s are, a simple toss could have ended the infant’s life. While armed, but knowing that the officers would capture him with that he ends his life with his own weapon. Fourth...is what happened.”
John leaned forward. His knees brushed against Sherlock’s.
And there was the touch of annoyance John had expected, with a hint of playfulness. John wasn’t sure when he pulled away and leaned against the wall cabinet with mobile in hand.
Another sigh escaped his lips, thankful that had Sherlock seen his quiet need for comfort. The last two months, he hadn’t asked. Trudging through it, shouldering all of it. It was something innocent that pressed him tonight, causing him suddenly to need this. He couldn’t watch them fall in his nightmares tonight, the man in front of him, and his child who disappeared.
“It’s interesting that the criminal would only want to speak with me when it’s obvious that the crime doesn’t merit the visit. Obviously, it was a spurned lover, but why insist?”
Lestrade huffed. “What makes you think that? We found them here.”
And he thanked her only because they would probably have to visit the hospital in the near future. Then he took down the hallway. It had been a while since any severe injuries happened. It also always paid to be kind, even if Sherlock couldn’t be arsed to care.
Well, that explained some of it.
“Pity.” He spat that word out in distain. -“For someone who wanted my help, he sure wasn’t grateful for it. Would whine about everything. It took him about six months or so to see things my way. Breaking him-” Moriarty paused, and cleared his throat when his voice grew too garbled to understand. “Sorry… breaking him gave me something to do during recovery, but it wasn’t the same as being here, playing the game.”
“You won’t be needing that.”
“You know that I could still walk out of here.”
“We don’t have time for this.” John broke the stalemate glare with Moran and declared exasperatedly.
The young man threw his head back and laughed. “I’ll forgive you since I found you unconscious on the floor.”
“Excuse us for a second,” muttered John. He tore out of his chair, and yanked Sherlock up by his forearm. It seemed that he knew what John was going to do because he offered no resistance, letting himself being pulled into the cluttered kitchen. John kept his voice low, fixing his eyes on Sherlock’s unwavering face.
John jumped as he opened the bottled water, splattering over the newspaper, his hands, and trousers. His eyes flickered between Sherlock, who had his hands fixed underneath his chin, his eyes closed in his usual thinking pose, and the water all over the place.
That question got Sherlock’s immediate attention. Blue-grey eyes jumped from the floor to quickly roaming over John’s features. “You’re divorced,” Sherlock concluded softly.
Since he was in his bedroom, John walked over to the hamper. If Sherlock was using Greg to pass a message to Mycroft then he could to. He didn’t want to neglect giving Mycroft the mobile numbers that Sebastian Moran gave him, or he might make appearance. Neither Sherlock nor himself would want that. Well, Sherlock might, only if he punched Mycroft like promised. But he didn’t want to risk the chance that everything was spilled out into the open. He could stand the idea of losing Sherlock again in theory, but ideally, right now, he couldn’t. John would just be better off passing it to Greg or throwing it out the flat window like he said he was going to do. At least, giving the mobile numbers would help Sherlock, and maybe, Mycroft and his goons would be able to find something.
The other man drew to his feet. Pain simply radiated from his body. “I can’t go back not after becoming your hostage. He’ll kill me.”

“No defensive wounds like the first two victims. Stabbed in the heart from the front, the killer changed to a longer weapon, judging by the minor exit wound here.” Sherlock pointed out a small pinprick on the grey skin. The smallest river of red had trailed over the victim’s side. “The throat was cut, possibly to prevent calling out for help. Worthless really, the victim would have been in too much pain to do so.”
“How do you know that?” asked Lestrade.
“No, I’ll take the way ther-”
Disclaimer: I don't own BBC Sherlock or any other variations.
John’s eyes flickered down to the remains of Mary’s mobile. “Shouldn’t have destroyed that then.”
Being articulate wasn’t his strongest suit even on his best days, worse when Sherlock had a hand pumping at his cock. John couldn’t set his words straight. He would just have to do it, the plan in his head. His hips jerked followed the stroking, stepping closer, lining Sherlock’s cock up against his own. He wrapped his hand around them both. Their mouths pressed together soon after.
Only then- did Sherlock stop trying to take his own trousers off. Sherlock’s hands moved to the side. Palms lying on the white covers. Green eyes narrowed. A frown formed on Sherlock’s face and the voice that promised sex turned flat. “I see. Being a man-”
John stuffed the note in his pocket, and went down the corridor. He glanced through the open front door, almost expecting to get caught out. No one was paid any attention, including Lestrade. He was busy calling orders to the other two officers. He snuck by, flitting up the stairs. No one would see John, stealing evidence. That was a job mostly reserved for Sherlock. He also mentally promised himself that he wouldn’t make a habit of it.
“I’ve waited years, John.”
“Of course she didn’t.”
Sherlock inhaled sharply, white teeth nibbled at an abused lower lip. John frowned. Using one hand to unbutton the appallingly small buttons, while he used his other hand to rescue Sherlock’s lip from permanent teeth imprints. It seemed Sherlock was as nervous as he was. “Don’t hurt yourself. There’s nothing to be nervous about.”
John clicked his tongue, and rubbed his fingers back over Sherlock’s nipple just to be ornery since Sherlock was trying to be bossy. He was amazed he could touch now. He didn’t want to rush it, even if his cock was hard and heavy, waiting for his turn of release.
“Perhaps. But a web always needs a spider to rebuild.”
Sherlock suddenly rolled away from him, and got out of bed elegantly. The tall lanky detective took the sheet, wrapped it around himself like it was his usual coat. All the milky pale skin John had touched hours ago was covered up right before his eyes. Sherlock padded around the bed, curls on his head bounced wildly.
“And what it is, is shit,” John disputed. “Sherlock is your friend. And what makes you think Moriarty will leave you alone after he has us? This is just like Magnusson all over again. People who know about your past will keep tracking you, you’ll never be safe.”
“Ah.”
John huffed, shaking in head with the same fondness that he saw mirrored in Sherlock’s eyes. Sherlock was still impressed, just as John was still impressed of Sherlock’s skills. A grin bloomed over Sherlock’s face, and John returned it.
“At the risk of bleeding out?”
“Fine, I won’t thank you or remind you that my life is my own-“ that remark earned John a disgruntled huff from the detective, but he continued,  “But I have something to ask you.”
“Crime scene first,” answered Greg when they reached the landing. Then he started for the stairs that lead to the entryway. “I can’t hold it for much longer and I want to know what Sherlock finds. Three bodies this time, more paperwork and processing. I’ll text Sherlock the address.”
Moran shrugged. “I don’t know, and I don’t ask. The last bloke who did, I had to cut out his tongue.”
John smiled at the greeting. Sounding so polite and formal out of a mouth that promised sin. He shook his head. “Sherlock, I can’t give you what you want.”
“John. I will not leave you behind ever agaian,” Sherlock simply stated; saying exactly what John needed to hear. Sherlock’s hands tightened, the motion somehow grounded John, both physically and mentally.
“Someone will die tonight.”
Laughter bubbled from John’s mouth. He opened his eyes, grinning when he found Sherlock smiling up at him.
“I have them memorised, stored them in my mind palace. Thought it would be useful.”
“Assuming there was no need in their intoxicated states. He was sober and surprised to find someone in the flat after getting out of the shower,” Sherlock motioned to the white towel, still fixed over the body’s backside. Then Sherlock added, “The killer wore gloves.”
“Sherlock…you’re doing that face again,” John muttered lowly, pinching the bridge of his nose, knowing that Sherlock would understand that pointing out ‘his annoying face’ meant that no one could comprehend him.
“Well, at least we have a full profile on CCTV to use for possible ID,” remarked Lestrade. “Maybe his identity can make a new lead.”
He inhaled deeply before pulling the oatmeal-coloured sweater over his head, and placed it in his lap. His hands started on the collar of his button down. Then he paused. “This isn’t a trade or anything, but someday, I would like to know what happened when you were gone, including Serbia.”
Large, elegant hands pushed the shirt down John’s shoulders, down his arms, and froze at his wrist were the buttons still held. Sherlock’s hands returned to the exposed skin, to the ruined silver trails of his scar. John shivered as fingers traced over it. Sherlock leaned over, his lips caressed over John’s features as the detective whispered against his skin.
“Sherlock, what are you doing?” John asked, ending with a sigh. “It looks like you were planning on doing the washing, but I could be wrong.”
Sherlock’s eyes trailed up and down John’s body, narrowed trying to deduce John’s body language if he was serious about it. Then Sherlock stepped out of the tub, walked to John slowly. Clever fingers swiftly removed John’s towel, and let it drop to the floor.
“Sebastian Moran. He was a part of Moriarty’s web. He was arrested for crimes against Queen and Country for attempting to blow up parliament. We prevented that from actually happening.”
“So, why did you have to ‘hold’ Douglas Hageman off? Did he attack you?”
John only nodded, wondering what the hell that was all about. He shared a look with Lestrade when Sherlock yanked open the door, and stalked inside the grey room once more. It seemed Lestrade was as confused as he was. But they both followed anyway.
“What about your sister?”
“Go check it. Tell me what you find.”
John arched his eyebrows, and felt the slightest of stings at his hairline. “Moriarty isn’t the lesser evil here.”
“Right then. I need your supplies.”
“No, that’s ridiculous. Saving her life hardly permits a visitation. I see her often enough in my mind palace as a distraction. Always interrupting when I’m busy,” answered Sherlock with an annoyed grimace. “Why do you ask?”
He typed out a quick message, asking where Sherlock was. The mobile buzzed in his hand again. John looked up to Peter. “I can’t stay actually…I’m being called to work.”
“I didn’t cause those injuries,” Sherlock clarified in a whisper.
“Yes, you are. But you can choose what kind of death, payment for your crimes or payment for failure. Your life or your wife’s death?”
“Because it ages you by five years and I need you to be the diversion.”
Silence befell the whole conversation when Donovan walked away. John could hear Sherlock mumbling to himself about this was tedious and an utter waste of time, and John could see why. Jack Ripper, it was either that is really his name or his streak of murderous activities had something to do with Jack The Ripper, or he was just throwing names around to take Donovan for a spin.
“Already was.”
“Right then.”
“You did,” John countered.
“I’ll fellatio you, obviously,” Sherlock answered with a devilish grin.
“And that’s my choice. Considering what you were going to do was murder.”
John blinked at her then smiled. “I would imagine.”
He also knew he needed a decent plan, in order for him not be snuffed out. Starting with how many bullets are in his gun, and where exactly Moriarty was, so John could blow his brains out. Then take his pulse.
“Not your first time tying someone up?” he asked, thinking that she was a widow of a drug dealer, and had said that this wasn’t her first kidnapping.
(See the end of the chapter for
“On top of the fridge.”
“Complaining?”
“It would’ve gone faster if you would’ve told me to flirt with him,” John countered back in annoyance. He yanked his jumper back over his head, quickly fixing the buttons on his collar. “You didn’t have to punch me.”
“Oy! Don’t break anything back there!”
“That was one time. You and I both know that’s not going to happen again and I want my mobile back.”
Molly meekly smiled at John when he stood by her side. “What’s going on?”
Except his eyes.
The traffic to Bart’s was miserable. John was pleased to pay the cab and let Sherlock stalk away. What could have happened at the flat was still in the forefront of his mind. Wondering again. He wasn’t opposed to it. In fact, the mere idea of closing in had John’s skin tingling. He could hear Sherlock before he walked into the morgue. The dark-haired man paced the room, ranting under his breath.
Green eyes stared up at John. Brightness shone in them, happiness, and disbelief. “Just like that? Even if it’s a trap? Or if Moran has nothing to do with murders?”
Sherlock huffed at him, getting to his knees. His pale hands tugged the rumpled suit into place, as if to save his dignity. It didn’t help; the reddened lips and mad hair took away from it. “Of course not. Don’t be ridiculous.”
“Mrs. Hudson complained,” answered Sherlock.
“What do you make of it?”
John sighed and shook his head. He might as well as get out with it. It would be helpful to have someone on his side to convince Mycroft to tell Sherlock everything. It can be another version of ‘Team Clean’ instead of drugs for Sherlock; it would be information for Mycroft.
Just he was about to tap the door again, it swung open. John took in Mrs. Hudson’s shuffled appearance, her wide-eyes and the dark flat behind her. John grinned.
Lestrade rubbed a hand over his face. “Lock what down? The only one who seems to be following you is him,” he pointed to John. “No offense.”
“You don’t for plan death,” stated Sherlock.
“Can’t you deduce it by now?”
“Soho? We could have walked there. Where are we going in Soho?”
A/N: Hello, it's me! Here's the next update. I hope you like it. Thank you for all the comments/bookmarks/ and kudos. They give me writing life. Thank you to my beta Whitehart for making this chapter look nice and spiffy.
It looked like Moran was knocked out. John checked the man’s pulse. It was fine, until it wasn’t, and that’s when Moran opened his eyes. Rage. Undiluted anger narrowed in John’s direction.
“Yes, you keep repeating that. You will too.”
John paused before her. His eyes landed on hers.
Moran shrugged, and glanced away for a moment, clearly stating without words exactly what he thought of John and of John’s plan. Moran huffed, sending dregs of smoke out from his nose. “Well, going solo probably wasn’t the way to do it. Too late now, toss the gun and let’s go.”
A pale hand held out a pair towards John. He took the offered gloves from Sherlock, snapped them on quickly and joined at detective’s side, avoiding the bloodstain that formed on the white carpet. John followed as Sherlock spoke aloud.
John’s apology was undercut by his laughter.
The sound of zipper teeth echoed through the quiet room. John snorted, as the clothing in his arms grew heavier. “That didn’t make you sound conceited,” he commented sarcastically before adopting a serious tone. “I’m not joking anymore, Sherlock. What if this goes to the papers?”
His hands balled at his side. A blush crossed his face. He wasn’t twelve years old anymore; he should be able to control his emotions when dealing with attractive people, especially with Sherlock. Besides, Sherlock wasn’t his in that way…only his best friend, flatmate, and sometimes a rather infuriating overgrown man-child that relegated into his care so he didn’t do anything stupid. He didn’t have any claim to the other man. Or to the pale skin that he’d rather see lying across his bed for the first time than in a classroom. But he had no right to it. No right to think of it. His life was easier when he ignored his attraction or was blissfully unaware of it.
John was in the midst of making them breakfast, simple eggs and toast (again) when the sun finally broke through the sky. Bright yellow stream of light trickled through the windows, but the ghastly grey still shadowed over Sherlock’s features and had been there since the lab. John couldn’t help but notice the slight shivers of Sherlock’s hands when he adjusted the knobs. Even in the safety of their home, and Mycroft’s watchful eyes, something was still bothering Sherlock. Coldness followed them, like a ghost, sucking life out from the warmth of their safety net.
John carefully stood and huffed a laugh. He flinched when he felt the tenderness on his head. It felt like it was only a bruise, but he should take a look at it again later. Next, he pulled the gun from underneath his shirt, automatically checking the safety before placing it on the kitchen table. He offered his hand down to Sherlock, who still was unhappily dumped on the floor, red lipped and rumpled.
John finished his wine, savoring the taste on his tongue. He opened his mouth, not knowing what to say exactly. He met Sherlock’s gray eyes. “John, I feel like there’s a need to apologize. I did not assess what happened in the pub properly. I understand if you were placed in a awkw-”
A/N: So how was that? Please leave a comment/kudos and/or bookmark. They give me writing life!
John turned his head, “What-”
John hummed. “I guess you could tell them that I broke your arms. Doubt they would believe you though, everyone thinks that I’m some harmless sod. If you’re wanting to avoid anything broken, I guess I could tie you up here in the flat until you detox completely.”
“Yes.”
Sherlock finally stepped into the kitchen, conceding the stalemate with a grimacing frown that looked as if it took all of his energy to give up this battle with John. Shrugging his shoulders, John gingerly pushed Sherlock into the chair and moved his arm, exposing the wound and quickly went to work.
“Of course. But it seems that my meddling brother had the paperwork already in motion due to “-’foreseen circumstances,’” Sherlock retorted with a sneer.
“Good, you’re following,” grinned Sherlock. His grey-green eyes gleamed happily as he continued, “Merry Mollet and Laura Pruit have one course in common, which means they met in the classroom. There’s a likelihood that our serial killer could have been there, stalking them from the very beginning and finishing it in the alleyway.”
He was slapped by the homeyness of the flat compared to the upper class design that carried through the rest of the building. Cookbooks were lined on top of grey marble counters. Dirty dishes floated in the sink. There was a bright yellow cookie jar, shaped like a smiley face brightening up the cool colors of the grey kitchen. The happiness of the decoration was ironic to the situation; everything about situation eschewed happiness. John’s pity came in waves when he saw the notepad on the refrigerator.
He straightened as Moran’s fist clocked him on the other side of the face. Blood burst within John’s mouth, and he charged up from the road in a tackle. His arms fixed around Moran’s middle as they both went down.
“No,” Sherlock answered without looking at John. Sherlock’s pale fingers fiddled with his cufflinks, proving to be difficult to remove when aroused. “Now, go lay on the bed. Don’t you dare fall asleep.”
John watched Sherlock’s long legs set the pace before he followed seconds later. He caught up to Sherlock, and remarked. “The surname should be easy enough. How many ‘Spoo’s do you know in London?”
John arched his eyebrows. “Rosemund?” he echoed lightly, the sarcasm in his tone carried in the air. “Is that her name now? What happened to Catherine?”
“All the things?” repeated John. “What are you talking about?”
“No. I need to say this, and you need to hear it. Now, if you try to protect me, or leave me out of this fight, Sherlock, I will drag you to New Scotland Yard, lock you in a cell and give Mycroft the key, is that clear?”
“Then I’ll talk to Sherlock. Want to leave your mobile number just in case?”
“Yes.”
He glanced up in surprise. “Another one? Does he think that’s it’s…” John frowned and shook his head. He weakly motioned to Sherlock’s clothes on the chair.
(See the end of the chapter for
The other man laughed and the sound of a zipper being drawn closed. “What? You don’t fancy breaking another table? Could always add another green one.”
He ignored the fact that Mary was at the pool showdown years before, aiming a gun at him to kill. Instead he questioned sharply. “Does Sherlock know? Is he in danger, right now?”
“Usually I get dinner first.”
“All conclusive data points to the possibility of someone else in the flat. Mycroft’s people are too meticulous. They wouldn’t touch anything they weren’t ordered too. I know that’s how “my things” disappeared from the kitchen table. I wasn’t up here at any point of time, and I personally know not to mess with the mirror. Mrs. Hudson and her hip can’t make it up another set of stairs without another herbal soother, and she hasn’t made any, otherwise the whole flat would have smelt like it. That rules her out-”
“Kissing.”
John’s eyebrows arched upwards. “Oh? Just what are you deciding on?”
“Baker Street!” he yelled at the cabbie as he slammed the door shut. The cabbie grumbled at him for his rudeness, but the car rejoined the busy traffic.
“He’s not injured.”
“Worst things have been said. You can open your eyes now.”
“There’s one more thing, Lestrade. This isn’t your crime scene,” declared Sherlock, stripping off of his gloves, and snapping the small magnifying glass closed. He tucked it away with his other crime scene supplies in his coat. John stood, ripped off his pair of gloves, and deposited them in the nearest bin. Wordlessly, he grabbed Sherlock’s, and threw them away as well.
John’s eyes widened. He shook his head and he waved his hand. “No, no, no, no, Sherlock. I should apologize, I didn’t mean to…” he trailed off. The words ‘touch you’ were on his lips, wanting to leave. John couldn’t. Not yet. Instead he cleared his throat. “It’s fine. It’s all fine, like you said, it was unexpected that’s all.”
“No, but you should think about quitting,” John supplied automatically as if were talking to a patient in the clinic.
“Touché, Doctor. Let me tell you secret just between us: Rose and I trained together. I know all her skills, abilities, and talents. She knows mine. I also know there was no way that Rose wouldn’t shoot to kill. If she hesitated for a mere second, that was her shooting him nicely. He died, didn’t he?”
Before John could explain about his and Sherlock’s ‘all-in’. Greg continued. “he also said that you were with Mycroft when I arrived. Was he trying to get information out of you about Molly? Because I told him I-”
“Should I expect him to jump out of the shadows, holding a gun to my head?”
“I thought about it. Thanks for the health talk.”
John plucked his coat from Sherlock and opened it. He didn’t even question the presence of his gun. John doubled checked the safety before tucking it away in the back of his trousers. After straightening his dark blue jumper over the gun, he pulled on his coat, and followed Sherlock downstairs. They briskly crossed the pavement, ignoring the light rain in favour of the waiting cab. Sherlock gave the cabbie the address, and the cab joined into traffic easily enough. John sighed when they reached a standstill. He turned to Sherlock, who was silently tapping on his mobile.
“You just stated otherwise,” Sherlock remarked, his mouth upturned slightly.
“He’s….”John trailed off, glancing out of the corner of his eye at Sherlock. He was still staring at nothing, but his breathing leveled. It was a relief for John, knowing Sherlock would not pass out from shortness of breath. He knew Sherlock experienced another ‘not-panic attack’ earlier. Now, he didn’t seem too different. John cleared his throat. “He’s thinking. Hasn’t said anything aloud yet.”
“And whomever Mr. Hageman made a deal with,” finished John.
Mycroft shift forward in in the leather seat. “I can tell you.”
He focused on four bright red inflammations over the curve of the shoulder. Tiny yellow blisters had begun forming around the inflammations. If the victim had lived, there was no doubt that a rash would have spread and pus would have formed underneath the skin. John had seen enough of this in the clinic to recognize it on sight. Plenty of patients come in, convinced that their skins were falling off only to find out it could be cleared up with a round of creams.
John caught himself on the edge. He had to lie back down and close his eyes. If he sees Sherlock fucking himself on his cock now, he would come instantly.
John finally lets himself get mad.
“Finishing an old one,” came Sherlock's hushed response.
“I'd have been a disgrace to my country if I hadn't”, he responded with a wink. And with that they both erupted into unreserved and hearty laughter.
He moved a hand up to cup Sherlock's cheek, running the pad of his thumb up the ragged contours of that impossible Sherlockian face. “You know that's not true”, he said simply. He hoped it was enough, but the truth of it was that so much was going unsaid. Cuts had been made and wounds would need nursing before scars formed over them. John swallowed, drawing back and running his hands over his face in frustration. Why couldn't Sherlock just
Sherlock gave a sad smile. “Now who's being an idiot.” John smiled back at him. There would be more discussions like this to follow, that was certain, but they'd wait. Their priority had to be Hamish. However, John's current priority was making sure Sherlock got some food down him first.
Sherlock looked up, his pupils swollen with uncertainty and his eyebrows knitting together in confusion.
“My brother was doing nothing to cause alarm.”
A brief smile creased Hamish’s face as he whispered his own muffled greeting, before it fell again. His eyes still shone with curiosity, but the pools of blue were tainted by a hollow, haunted look.
In previous years Sherlock would have scoffed at the sentimentality and nostalgia of John's reminiscence. It took the fact that, not only was he tolerating the sharing of memories as he slowly picked at the food John had prepared for him, but the fact that he was also enjoying it, for him to realise how much being with John and being a father had softened him. When he'd first met John he was all scathing remarks and prickly temperament, but he'd mellowed. He hadn't realised quite how significant the change had been, and he figured that it was so gradual that nobody else had either, but it was definitely there. He was definitely a better man. Listening to the soft and gentle timbre of John's voice as he wistfully recounted memories of Hamish's younger days was soothing, to both of them. It was of particular comfort to John to reflect on them as he continued to thumb that crisp white envelope which, as it was becoming evermore apparent, potentially contained their son's future career prospects.
George made no further attempts to prolong the journey, John was not going to calm any further. He was like a gas leak, and the longer he was left the more gas would come pouring from every crack and fracture. The reality of the situation was that waiting for them at St Bart's were two naked flames and there was no preventing the inevitable explosion.
“Bloody hell, John!” He screamed into the empty room in frustration. “You're supposed to be angry.”
“A case which I'll have solved by lunch time – at which point I'll require another one. Really John, I'd have thought you'd have been aware of my detective abilities by now” he said, dryly.
with Detective Inspector Lestrade. Mycroft must have read this thought clearly on his nephew's face, as he stiffened slightly, his mouth forming a tight line.
“My priority is my brother, and my brother was well. I had no business interfering with matters”, Mycroft responded in clipped tones.
proved to be fruitful. It returned leftovers of Hamish's home made chilli. He opted not to bother cooking any rice to go with it, and instead thrust the container into the microwave for a few minutes before settling down at the kitchen table to eat. Mrs Hudson had insisted she teach Hamish to cook, stating that neither John nor Sherlock had culinary skills beyond those of cave man, and that if at least one occupant of 221B didn't learn to cook soon then they would all die of malnutrition. John suspected that she didn’t have the patience to teach either himself or Sherlock, and thus figured that Hamish was the only option which wouldn't significantly age her. It was times like this that he was glad they'd humoured her. He still vividly remembered the first time Hamish had cooked chilli for them all, not even a whole week from his 11
Hamish’s brow furrowed in confusion at the change in conversation, but remained silent.
John and Sherlock were left alone, hands joined for hours on end across Hamish's hospital bed, not saying a word. John found himself fingering through the pile of birthday cards that he'd brought back with him from the flat, smiling to himself at the multitude of coloured envelopes, before resting them gently back onto the bedside table.
Hamish was walking hastily down the road to the Baker Street tube station, trying his best to suppress his frustration. His plan had been to make Sherlock realise what an utterly

not in the handwritten script of a friend or family member but in solid black print. He ventured up the stairs to Hamish's room to leave the cards and the letter on his bed ready for when –
Hamish mirrored John's frustration with a sigh of his own, slinking past him and into the kitchen. He discarded his bag onto the kitchen table, silently slipping two slices of bread into the toaster. John leaned against the door frame, observing him with his lips pursed. Hamish reminded him in so many ways of Sherlock, and not necessarily Sherlock's favourable attributes. Sherlock was, for all intents and purposes, a sulky teenager, and coupling that demeanour with an
Something about today had Hamish on edge, something about today had Hamish dreading the possibility of even finishing his breakfast judging by his laboured chewing.
John rolled his eyes and gave a humourous tut. “There really is nothing that fazes you is there..I mean, you're
“Late”, John had quipped.
“Hamish...why are you recording? Did Mycroft put you up to this? I bet he did, he's always been insufferable about 'family films'” Sherlock remarks scornfully. He slumps slightly, folding his arms in a childlike manner. Hamish rolls his eyes, before plastering a somewhat incredulous look on his face.
As a crossfire erupted above his head, bullets sweeping their graceful trajectory in search of their targets, John realised that reinforcements from Scotland Yard must have arrived. He couldn't determine from the exchange of ammunition how many there were, and he found that he didn't care. His focus was locked and there was nothing in it but himself and Hamish. The roar of gunfire barely even penetrated the muffling bubble that seemed to be constricting around him. As his hands carried out the almost habitual ritual he'd performed so many times on fallen comrades, he thought of all the times he'd managed to save his friends from similar wounds...and then he drowned in the times that he
my fault, Sherlock. It was yours.” The tears had ceased, but John's voice was trembling; shaking and quivering under the weight of the accusation it had just made. John knew he should stop, step back from the brink before he said something that pushed them both over, falling into a dark abyss of hastily flung insults and scolding words which they couldn't take back. The words, however, kept coming, burning like acid in John's mouth.
stories to tell!”
Sherlock was smiling again now, as his son looked up from beside him.
John didn't want to delve into anything too serious in the time he had Hamish's conscious attention, and so their conversations remained trivial and light-hearted. John repressed the urge to discuss what had happened, compressing his emotions into a tight and distant corner of his mind. He also fought against the desire to discuss Hamish's University application, which proved the harder of the two tasks, because John was excited beyond all possible reason. His hand would unconsciously drift to rest over the pocket of his jacket which contained Hamish’s acceptance letter. He hadn’t given it to him yet, he wanted to wait until his son was feeling stronger. And yet, he was so desperate to see his son read those printed words, to realise his achievement. John was anxious to start making plans, to start traversing the new road that Hamish was bound for; the preparation for one of the greatest leaps of his life.
“Met your lad earlier today.”
John thought. He liked Greg, and thought he trusted him too, but Greg wasn't so dense as to not realise how
John huffed a breath before closing his book silently and moving to Hamish’s bedside. He pressed a short but firm kiss to his son’s forehead. Ordinarily Hamish would object, but this time he leaned in slightly to absorb the affectionate warmth rolling off his Dad.
appearance, they knew was now aware of the Holmes-Watson storm descending upon them.
John allowed himself a rueful laugh before muttering a disgruntled “Thanks” and collapsing back into his chair. Across from him, George had lowered himself back into the wheelchair and manoeuvred it closer to the hospital bed.
“Nearly 20 years” George finished, nodding. “Nice to see you too, by the way” he added sarcastically.
“Okay, so...signature?” John's brow furrowed slightly, his eyebrows knitting together as he tried to make sense of the torrent of new information.
for fear of creating a spark which ignited them. He'd all but waded through the bogs of anger and boiling rage, and now he found himself consumed by a fog of raw and unrelenting
He took a step back, allowing Mycroft to bend and retrieve him umbrella before continuing. “Still, I should have expected nothing less from the man who essentially sold his little brother out to a criminal mastermind. Seems you have something of a track record when it comes to screwing over family.”
“You can say that again. Man’s a genius. That trick he does...the one where he tells you your life story...” He puffed out his cheeks briefly before expelling the air. “Brilliant”
right
“You knew”, John muttered through gritted teeth. It wasn't a question, it was a statement. His fists clenched around the handfuls of Hamish's bedsheets and it took a considerable amount of effort and every last fraction of John's restraint not to rise to the tight line of Mycroft's grimace. Meeting Mycroft Holmes with rage was about as effective as a chocolate teapot, and John had long since learned that presenting himself as cool, unwavering and even passive intimidated Mycroft more than threats and physical action.
“And what family business is that then, lad?” George called after him, his voice mirthful,
“Sherlock...” John made to move forward, but stopped when Sherlock gave a minute and almost undetectable shake of his head. “Look at me please”, he begged.
------
“How’s the pain?”
John sighed, he was neither prepared nor in the mood to face Sherlock. He took a breath and closed his eyes briefly to calm himself.
His mind wouldn't let him, even if he had wanted to. His whole conscious mind was drowning, buried and crushed under the weight of the rubble of his life. The last 8 hours had left him exhausted, drained and hopeless. He was utterly lost, flagging and wandering completely disoriented through his mind. He was pitifully wading through the storm of betrayal and heartbreak, of regret and loathing. His mind was a kaleidoscope; washes of dark blues of despair and pools of desperate purples, contrasted with angry red and oranges and blindingly bright white. And then there was black; a small but achingly all-consuming shadow, hidden away but frighteningly prominent. It was pulling John to wallow in a pit of sorrow, to close everyone and everything out and let it take him. He was tempted by it, considered that it may offer him some peace. The only thing left anchoring him in the
Hamish still spent a lot of his time sleeping. He struggled to stay awake for much over 40 minutes at a time for the first few days. This increased to an hour or so by the end of the week, but his body was still recovering, and so he remained much the same; sleeping for 4 or 5 hours at a time, and then waking for short periods.
George gave John a warm smile. “Sarah”, he began gazing off somewhere into the mid-distance. “Rose to my thorn, that woman. Dragged me through the mud by m'ear and I love her for it. Hold on...” He shifted slightly where he was sat, and pulled out a battered old leather wallet, flicking it open and withdrawing a photo and leaning over to bridge the gap between himself and John to hand it over. It was a wedding photo; George in his regiment’s parade uniform, and his wife stood next to him radiant and happy in an ivory wedding gown. Her heart-shaped face, framed by long, sleek, ebony hair, boasted startling green eyes. “Beauty isn’t she?” George remarked, beaming.
Sherlock didn’t say anything, but moved to sit on the edge of the bed. John moved an abandoned pillow to hide the state that his lower body was in, and took great pains to ignored the state that Sherlock’s was in. As he sat up, his jaw dropped at the sight of Sherlock’s back.
“I have.”
John watched as Sherlock’s eyes roamed over him. The detective’s face softened as it always did when it was just the two of them in the flat. “Yes.”
The woman stepped back with a look of both horror and surprise. “Oh, that was your husband! I’m so sorry, I thought…”
Sherlock hummed at him, eyes still calculative, lips perched around his wine glass. John couldn’t help but to feel transfixed by Sherlock’s mouth, his throat, and the way he held the glass in his hands. John snatched the wine bottle quickly. He poured his glass half full.
Sherlock’s mobile rang, the sound echoed in the sitting room. John’s mobile buzzed again. He snatched it out his pocket, read the caller I.D, and accepted the call. He spoke into the mouthpiece before the person on the side could say anything.
“I’m fairly confident that they’ll be looking elsewhere.”
“What?” repeated Sherlock, his eyes were looking everywhere but John.
When the door clicked closed, John sighed. He stood in the archway between the kitchen and the living room. His arms folded across his chest. Silently, he watched as Sherlock deduced him with that distinctive gaze, as he had done to so many other people, before blinking. John wondered what Sherlock found since Sherlock’s face softened.
Ah. John’s mind lit up and he pointedly ignored the idiotic jab. So Sherlock knew that he was attracted to him, that he wanted to act on it, and he was so tempted to do so but he wasn’t. Wanker. He returned the egg pan to a cooler burner to grab two plates. He held them in his hands; unaware of that he was trying to shield himself as he replied. “That…would make things complicated.”
“… and a coat fiber, a footprint, and Mrs. Hudson hadn’t touched her herbal soothers.” Seems like Sherlock figured it out a different way.
They went past the door with a sense of paranoia and apprehension at the approaching open doorway ahead. The room ahead was barely lit, shining a highlighted path into the hallway. John could hear Mary talking lowly and pausing every so often. Her heels clicked as if she were pacing, which she did when she was angry, at least that would help them figure out where she was. And if she were still making that call, they would have a chance of surprise.
“Nope. That’s why his usual methods of dieting end in failure.”
“And, what?”
John cleared his throat, stepped towards Peter and put on his most charming smile- well, one that he hoped was charming, it seemed to work for some women in the pub sometimes, as he lied. “Actually, I think I’m lost…it’s my first time on campus, but there’s something wrong with my schedule. I don’t know how to get that fixed.” The lie had come surprisingly quickly.
Sherlock stepped into his personal space again, using his height as means to intimidate him. John met his eyes, unthreatened, knowing the last time they had a tussle like this, it was Sherlock pinned to the pavement by his shorter frame and bleeding from the small cut on the cheek made by his fist.
“Do I want to know what the two of you did to find out? Was it legal?”
John grinned darkly. “You’re still an idiot, and now you’re my hostage.”
“Megan Hageman. 2343 Battery Road! She should be home. They were supposed to make it look like a break in! I haven’t heard anything!”
From that small motion, John thought of a plan.
“I thought you would be out.”
John sighed and whispered. “Me too.”
An exaggerated sigh from the kitchen carried through the air. “Thank you for the tea, Mrs. Hudson, no matter how predictable it may be-”
He opened his eyes to find Sherlock in a dark blue robe, not any different than if they were back at the flat. His toes wiggled against the brown-carpeted floor. Sherlock had a thoughtful look on his face. The robe leveled at the top of Sherlock’s knees and was knotted off in his middle, the main difference from the state that Sherlock usually wore it back home. From this angle, John could pretend that Sherlock was wearing clothes. If only he could get over the fact that twenty other people were going to see all of his flatmate’s pale skin exposed. John swallowed, not enjoying that feeling whatsoever, especially after his sudden epiphany that he was, himself, attracted to Sherlock.
John snorted. He must have yelled that last bit. “Sorry about that, yeah, my hearing is a bit gone.”
“Mycroft’s people never found Moriarty’s body on the rooftop, and some of Moriarty’s web is rebuilding. At least, that’s what Mycroft said. He also said you’re going to end up playing his game again, whether you want to or not.”
“You’re not in the position to negotiate,” stated Lestrade, earning a panicked look from the suspect as he threw himself on the table, trying to reach for Sherlock’s Belstaff. “I’ll only tell you the story if you stay in this room with me. No one else can hear it.”
Sherlock’s words did something to him, warmed his chest. This moment was the same as when they were alone in the flat. John watched as thoughts flurried over Sherlock’s surprisingly open face. Indecision. Hesitance. Resolution. They were so close; it made John’s heart wild. He licked his lips. Sherlock’s hands were on him, warm, inviting. Fingertips caressed his pulse. He held the cheap robe within his fingertips at Sherlock’s elbows. All he had to do was rise and capture.
“Sherlock, I-”
“You’ll be one of them,” John said flatly, breaking into the silence.
John smiled. “I wouldn’t say unconscious. I did complain about it.”
“Of course. Bye.”
If Moran strangled him, John would lose everything before he got to Moriarty. Sherlock would be the only option left for the psychopath.
Surprisingly, Sherlock did. John wedged the balled up trousers underneath Sherlock’s arse. Then John dropped to his knees.
“YES!”
John didn’t bother questioning. Instead he focused on delivering a fine sweep of his tongue over seam where their lips are sealed, tasting the faded taste of toothpaste in Sherlock’s mouth. That one split second he switched from the taker to the giver. He had let Sherlock have his fun. Now, it was his turn. He kissed back with vigor, addicted to the way Sherlock felt. So warm, and a bit heavy.
John’s eyebrows met his hairline in surprise.
John sighed, and swallowed the lump in his throat to calm down his beating heart. He bent down, and pressed his fingers to Moran’s pulse. Still alive. But, John wouldn’t promise a third chance. Moran was definitely going into the boot for safekeeping.
“Sherlock, what happened to your back, mate?”
“Brunette?”
Something that John couldn’t name flashed over Sherlock’s face before he stood up. The detective walked over to his chest of drawers. John watched as Sherlock paused, staring at his expensive shirts as if there was something fascinating. John partly wondering If Sherlock could deduce things from his own clothing as he did with others.
John snorted at the man’s sarcasm and followed with a frown. But he didn’t feel any pity. It was their choices that got them here in the first place. “I really don’t want to think about it,” he answered.
“And quite on purpose I’ll admit,” John snapped.
Lestrade’s face was grim, sinking John’s hope as the DI replied, “Stabbed in heart like the other two. I may not look it, but I sometimes do listen when Sherlock says something.”
John asked lightly. “What exactly are my options, Mary? To shoot you or be shot… again? I can’t say I was fond of the first experience.”
John clicked his tongue, and shook his head with his arms cross in front of his chest. “You wanted more, Sherlock. We are going to do this my way.”
The taller man leaned on the open doorway, arms folded across his bare torso. John bit back a laugh at Sherlock’s poufy wild hair from sleeping. Sleep lines were still visible on his face. Sherlock’s thin mouth upturned at the edges, blue eyes thoughtful.
“John-“
He hummed deeply as the liquid burned down his throat. The pipes in the wall stopped rattling, John turned to the cabinet, grabbing another mug. In the flat another door clicked shut.
“And out of your control. Which victim was it, the harlot? Or the one of the two men?”
“I called them...”
“That’s a chance I’ll have to take, John. We have to meet him.”
“Must be important. Do answer it.”
The distorted garble turned John’s attention from the bodies, to the smiling person who asked the question. The Beretta aimed for the man sitting in a wheelchair, dressed in a sharp black suit, legs covered in a pale yellow blanket, next to the water.
“Thanks for that…” he muttered back as he opened his eyes and ignoring the sweeping dizziness as he took in the surroundings. Then he added, “Sorry Mrs. Hudson, this case has been-”
He went back into the snot-green bedroom, eyed the bedside tables, and tried to figure which one the note was referring to. And Sherlock would have probably known right away, either from the shadows of something or the wooden knob, if the man had been here. But it was only John. He went for the nearest one. The lamp swayed from the movement as John pulled out a drawer. He wrinkled his nose at the dozen or so foil wrappers. He sure as hell hoped that the note was not referring to the condoms. He went to the other, dust covered beside table.
“I’m fine. I just…ran into a door. A rather large door, didn’t see it coming actually,” John feigned as he mentally promised to deck Sherlock the next time he saw him.
He glanced over when Sherlock didn’t answer right away, found the detective in his usual thinking pose. Pale fingertips rested on Sherlock’s lips as the man in question thought. Even when Sherlock was all about the case right now, John couldn’t help but to be propelled into thinking about those lips on his from when they stumbled into bed together. It had been about time something happened, that he would agree with Sherlock there. Going at it in their pants may not have been what Sherlock had planned at all, but tumbling into bed was exactly what they needed. That quenched the feeling like he was going to go mad, and burn up from the overpowering sexual tension…but it was slowly building up again as the clock ticked.
“I must say,” said John, as Rosie had finally gotten bored and trotted off. “You were right about the makeup. This was definitely worth it.” He laughed, poking Sherlock’s cheek which was coated heavily in some of the pink blush only adding to the natural color rising to his cheeks.
The Wednesday after Rosie’s birthday, John was at the surgery. He got out earlier than expected, but he was not about to complain.
he mutters. Suddenly his eyes light up, like he's just been handed a triple homicide investigation. Hamish doesn't seem to notice, but John does and catches Sherlock's eye, winking an affirmative for whatever mischievous hijinks Sherlock has planned.
with an apology under his own steam, realise the gravity of his situation and the magnitude of his mistake. He wanted Sherlock to realise how much he risked losing and come to John offering a sincere apology straight from the depths of the heart that John knew he had. He wished that, just once, Sherlock would come and see if
Still he did not say a word.
He was divided between the two opposing and conflicting mindsets grappling at each other and desperately seeking a foothold inside his head. He didn't know whether to let the worry take the podium or whether his simmering anger was the more worthy opponent. He elected to dismiss them both for the time being and instead resolved to occupy himself in an attempt to ignore them completely. He needed to focus on himself, even if just for a few hours, because he was hungry and exhausted and, quite frankly, he really needed a wash. He strode purposefully over to the desk, depositing the handful of letters that he'd been holding onto it, before turning and heading towards the bathroom.
Hamish was humming with nervous energy as he made his way across the school grounds. The anticipation was coursing through each of his vertebrae in turn, urging him forward into a run. The muscles in his legs propelled him forward of their own accord, his body acting completely independent of thought, as if each cell in his body was wholly and completely sentient, and he was completely at their mercy. He rounded the corner of the science building, the scent of sulphur, methane, ethanol, pricking into his adrenaline heightened senses. His legs reluctantly slowed, steadying back to a walking pace as he made his final turn towards the front gate. It wouldn't do for his Uncle to witness him so excitable. It would only further lower his opinion of him; he'd think him nothing but a hyperactive child. Hamish's posture stiffened, his face masking the unrelenting throb of wired thoughts swarming his mind; the endless and thrilling possibilities presented by this new case. And in that instant he was reminded of Private George Benson's words.
George had to laugh. He sobered up just enough to offer his response.
is an appropriate time to show concern for your brother.” No response came, but John knew that he'd understood, and with that he collapsed back into his former chair, running his now sweaty palms over his face, his weary eyes stinging with lost sleep.
This definitely didn't count as thinking about him; or so John told himself.
John smiled. "Friend of Sherlock's. Well, I say
“Hamish...”
“We got the bastards” was all he said. It was enough. Knowing it wasn't all in vain didn't make it worth it – nothing ever would – but it did take some of the sting out, even if just for a moment. Nobody else would suffer at the hands of that sadistic gang of criminals now, and that couldn't be anything but good. No more families would traverse the merciless road of grief and loss. Of course John was suffering now,
“Psychology is
Hamish had shrugged nonchalantly. “Solved a murder. No biggie.”
“But I’ll be honest with you, I don’t even know where to start.” John continued, before running one hand over his face in frustration
it had been for Hamish to be in attendance at his crime scenes. John found himself wondering if Greg had even attempted to fight John's corner, to reason with Sherlock at all. He suspected not. After all, Detective Inspector Lestrade was a desperate man a lot of the time, and god help him he needed Sherlock, and John thought there probably wasn't much he wouldn’t do to keep the Consulting Detective happy to keep him solving his cases. Currently, however, that was the least of his worries. Hamish needed to be escorted from the crumbling wreck of a factory. He was silently compliant, barely even chancing a glance at either of his parents as they decided between them that it would be more efficient for John to be the one to take him, and for Sherlock to wrap up the case himself with the promise of reinforcements close behind.
The dream during his day slumber had been a poignant gouge in his reserve.  He had felt so in control and that control had him taking Sherlock in a way he had never done before.  Worse yet was the way the man had complied—no, had surrendered to his want and desires.  John had woke with the taste of the man’s blood in his mouth, something that had haunted him for many nights after he had fled London for Canada, which he had thought he had dealt with.
The detective had not slept much, possibly a few hours scattered here and there, that left him floating through most of the days, unsure exactly what time it ever was.  He had lived and breathed Mary Morstan these last seventy eight hours.  He had exhausted all his resources, called in every favor he had left owed him, and still…nothing.
“Louis told me that you are a fledgling of Lestat.” The man started.  It was said simply, like a scientific fact stated, and still John loathed it.  The man reached out a hand again and the new vampire took it, curiously.  “Welcome to the club.”
“You planned this.” John accused, narrowing his gaze at the detective across the tiny room from him.
The reporters, however, had been bothering Mrs. Hudson.  That was a part of the reason why he had made a point of stopping by more often and had assigned an extra beat to the area.  Still it was hard to keep them at bay.  The woman had admitted to being hounded at her door and even out buying the groceries, even though there was nothing to tell.  All three people had just vanished.
Sherlock timed it properly, as he squeezed and slid his hand along John he slowly began to breach. It burned and he wanted to tense up all over again, but resolutely held himself perfectly still, biting hard on the inside of his cheek.
Mycroft looked down his straight nose at him.  “No he is not, for reasons that I am not at liberty to discuss.”
"New?" Sherlock questioned, the arch of one brow cocking.  If John was answering his questions he wasn't going to stop.  "So it does not happen with other people?"
The blonde’s tongue played with the sensitive lobe of his ear, tracing the curved shell up and then back down before eliciting a gentle but feverishly erotic warning, “We are going to have so much fun, you and I, Sherlock Holmes.”
“Look at me, John.” Sherlock tore the shirt from his body, tossing it away. “Really look at me and tell me what you see with all your newfound powers.” The detective spread his arms wide, inviting the man to view everything.
“I was sleeping, Sherlock,” John patronizingly called after the obtuse man, following him around the corner into the kitchen, “like normal people do.”
"Don't be ridiculous! Get out of my tub and tell me where John is!" With fists clenched, he began to seriously analyze his probability of success in the small space, when the other gripped the sides of the tub.  The detective found himself frozen in place with a wicked grin.
"You want this, don't you?  You want me to take you in my mouth." he said, his voice soft and smooth like it had never been before, damn near melodious to hear singing such desire.  John always had liked to hear him say it.
“Flattered as I am, I’m afraid that this isn’t a social call.” David’s reply caused the smile on his companion to sink a little.
There was a dull throbbing ache building behind his pale eyes and the sleep that he had been forgoing was beginning to take its toll. Choosing to not endanger his recent gains by way of John’s acceptance, the detective decided to call an end to this round of testing. He finished his recording and uncharacteristically, he tidied up the space and the mess as best he could.
As the vampire finished the last off, he began to feel guilty. He had caused most of his own trouble. He should have known better than to gorge on the cow in the barn. He could have gone into the farm house and taken the ‘little drink’, as Louis had taught him. He knew that animal blood could sustain him, but draining the whole damn cow had probably been his undoing. For once he thanked Sherlock for this insight and forethought. The blood was not from a living source and was therefore not nearly as satisfying, but it would settle him until they stopped for the dawn. He would need to feed then, before giving into the immortal slumber if he hoped of recouping fully. That and it would help him stave off the seductive aroma of the detective’s pumping heart.
The momentary hesitation ended and was replace with a vexing lust that doubled the ache in his heart and loins.  John lunged at him, decided and focused, violently ripping the detective’s shirt open. Sherlock’s surprise melded into a groan, as those familiar lips assaulted his collar, blazing a hot trail down his chest. The flick of wet tongue across his nipple followed by a gentle bite left him gasping.
The room became saturated with a sweet smelling smoke from the charcoal that burned in the ornate thurible that the mock-bishop swung ritualistically back and forth like a pendulum before him.  Behind him came a taller figure, blond curls drawn back with a black ribbon, hands holding a long white candle that cast eerie shadows on the vampire’s pale face. Lestat’s head was cast downward, his eyes barely open, as he followed his master. He was dressed in a long white rochet, detailed in lace about the knees, as it flowed over the scarlet cassock beneath. They proceeded past the two of them, as much a part of a play as Marisa was in her pew.
He really should have tried to think of what he would say to the other man on his walk home instead of thinking of what he would like to do. John locked eyes once more, licked his suddenly dry lips and tried again. “That is to say-” He cut himself off once more with another shake of his head. He couldn’t seem to get what he wanted to say out, he didn’t even know how to say what it was. “Bugger it.” With that he gave up on words, he was more of a man of action anyway.
John stopped. He was still. He was pinned by those words, spike driven into the joints of his body, steeling him against any movement.  He relived that line, spoken in her charming bedroom tones, over and over in his brain. What exactly had she just asked him? Was this an accusation? Did she truly think this to be true? It could not be so! He wouldn’t let it!
John snorted. Of course, he had solved the case before even leaving the country. The man was the most brilliant person he had ever met. Sherlock could sometimes be awe-inspiring, normally bloody amazing, but most often frustrating, like now. Looking down at his legs and wet jumper he shrugged, “It might be due to an inconsiderate ass banging the door open.” He was surprised that Sherlock noticed. No, not noticed, more like cared enough to even comment on it.
He had never been a patient man and waiting for John was proving to be more difficult than he had at first predicted.  The note and the postcard that Lestrade had produced were most intriguing, finally a clue as to who it was that meant Mary and John harm that fateful night weeks ago.  Still it had been sloppy.
John just grumbled an expletive in response, knowing that arguing was moot at this point in the game.
At the sound of her voice his head twitched slightly and his feet stopped fidgeting but the man made no move to get up or even move from his position on the couch.  His shoulders moved downward ever so slightly, revealing the sharp cupid’s bow of his upper lip, and softly he intoned, “My phone, Mrs. Hudson, I need it.  Retrieve it for me.”
Then they stopped.  Something changed, kicked in, a wall came down, and he refused the other part that believed.  “T-that’s a lie.” He said, stubbornly, his hands balling into fists at his sides, as his back went ramrod straight.
But you didn't, because you think you're so high and mighty.” John was towering over Mycroft where he sat in the chair now, refusing to back up and only closing in further around his brother-in-law. “I'm not one of your little government pets to be ordered around. We're family and, like it or not, we're equals. You have a responsibility to come to me when Sherlock is being reckless, regardless of your own desires, because I
“Nothing good ever comes of those words” John replies with a grimace. “In fact, last time you said that it cost me fifty quid” he adds, wagging a finger at his son.
“I'm here”, he mumbled softly between kisses. He'd not had to do this in so long, the nightmares which had plagued John so often had almost faded completely over the years, with John only suffering them mildly ever few months. It'd been years, or even decades, since one had provoked such a traumatised and nightmarish reaction. Sherlock could feel John almost shaking in his arms. Nightmares of the war had always been bad, but never like this. Something was different now.
George nodded again, tapping his thumb absently against the side of his mug. "It's good you've kept busy. God knows it's bloody difficult to get away from stuff people like us would rather forget."
bed, after all.
“...marks on the wrist confirm the dragging hypothesis – not that I really needed any confirmation. Mottling of the skin indicates he was on his back when he died, but was then moved and left on his front. Arms by his sides, rather than above his head from the dragging...he was positioned, conscious decision?”
The impact sent John reeling. Those hushed Gaelic syllables were wishes of good health, wishes of luck and good fortune. They were wishes of happiness and love. But more than that, they were the words of a mother who never was, and John's heart just ached for them both. It choked him, gripping at his heart and pushing violently against his ribcage. He had a son. A beautiful, wonderful, talented, intelligent son, and he had so nearly lost him. John Watson was blinded by just how
“Spent at least 18 months feeling sorry for myself”, Benson added. John remained silent. He could see each and every day of those 18 months in the creases around his old comrade’s eyes; they’d aged him significantly. War had that effect. It cultivated bitterness and relentless nightmares. “Took a slap across the face to bring me to my senses. Night I sacked my therapist in a drunken rage, landlord’s daughter – barely even knew the lass – gave me a cold hard wallop.” Benson gave that trademark, mischievous grin which John knew so well and chuckled. “She’s now me’ wife.”
Beat.
"You know, 'Mish," he began as he briefly skimmed the page of
Sherlock and John had been gone approximately 20 minutes when the message came through. The message that made Hamish wish he hadn’t instructed Benson to intercept any police communications to and from Scotland Yard. The message that contained chilling details of yet another killing. He'd been too late. Too late to save them. Hamish felt so painfully suffocated by the news as it came through, so completely crushed. Nothing could halt the bile from rising in his constricting throat when the initial police report disclosed that, on this occasion, there was not one but two bodies at the scene. The images that followed provided the sickening confirmation which Hamish hardly needed. On the screen in front of him, was a young woman discarded like an old rag in a dump of nettles. The inscription of that panicked and desperate apology on her back was only half complete, as the lifeless form of its scribe – Martin Bridges – lay by her side; their bodies boasting similar purples and blacks and blues. Hamish desperately tried to oppress the panic rising within him; two people were dead and two more were in danger, because if this band of sadistic criminals had identified that messages were being left, then they would be preparing for whoever it is who was following them. Without a word, and ignoring Benson's protests, Hamish pulled on his jacket, stuffing his phone into his pocket, and all but ran from the room.
He turned to his wife, with a finger pressed over his lips to indicate the need for silence. She nodded, sweeping in quietly to deposit the small Tupperware box with a selection of the fruits of her afternoon’s labour on the bedside cabinet. She excused herself, pausing to look back over her shoulder as she left the room and smiling fondly as George took his post by Hamish’s bedside.
Hamish was a skilled actor. Not in the thespian sense – such activities were trivial and nonsensical – but in the sense that he had a refined ability to deceive, much like his father. Though, when Sherlock was bored beyond measure he didn't make such an exhaustive effort to disguise it. Hamish had inherited a suitable level of emotional intelligence from John and was thus more subtle about his boredom, slyly and silently manipulating situations to work in his favour, whereas Sherlock’s stubborn and brazen approach adopted no regard for the reactions of the idiot who was boring him. And so, rather than engaging in a display of his obviously superior intellect, Hamish wallowed in the continuous hum of various 'industry professionals' in the crowded school hall. He took the opportunity to brush up on his skills of deduction. It was the Holmes equivalent of people watching: observing every minute detail about an individual and plotting their whole life as a map, stretched out through his consciousness.
It's been nearly 3 weeks and for that I offer my deepest apologies! I've basically hated every word I've written for the past two weeks and it's been so hard to get back into the rhythm of things. I was meant to post this yesterday but it was results day and I found out that I got into Uni so I was rather preoccupied with celebrating!
The shower was soothing. He cleaned every inch of skin meticulously and rigorously, working the soap between his fingers and over his palms, scrubbing at the mere memory of the blood which had caked them. He cleaned with the precision of a surgeon preparing for a procedure. He stood for a moment, wanting to revel in the calm aura he'd surrounded himself with in the clouds of steam before he had to wash his hair. The pressure of the warm water was perfect and the thrum of it cascading from the shower head down onto his back served to massage some of the tension from his shoulders. He focussed on that, just the sensation of water beating down onto him, and filled his mind with it. He'd closed his eyes, tipping his head back to allow the water to run over his face, droplets catching in his eyelashes before falling and running a path down to caress his cheeks. He blindly reached for his shampoo and began working the small amount he'd squeezed out between his hands. Then he narrowed his attention to sensation again, the contact between the pads of his fingers and the top of his head...
His attention was abruptly stolen from bathing in his own pride and the basking in the impressed expression of Private Benson by his mobile phone buzzing in his pocket.
He sat awake in the worn chair, picking absently at the faded and torn covering. His body wanted him to sleep, urged him to succumb to the clinical lullaby of gentle beeping and surrender to unconsciousness. He didn't want to. He plainly refused to slip into slumber.

“What's the project, kiddo?” John asks as he moves round the front of the sofa and settles in the space between Sherlock and Hamish. He ruffles Hamish's hair, just as Sherlock had.
Hamish's birthday passed silently. Nobody visited then. Even the nurse made herself scarce after completing her duties.
John heaved a deep sigh at the sight before him. “'Mish...you could at least make an effort. Today's an important day for you.”
“What's the latest?” John really hadn't spared a single though for the case in the last 8 hours, and who could blame him, but since his friend was stood before him with a leg missing he felt he should at least ask. George looked up to meet John's gaze, his eyes were laden with the same victorious spark that John had seen so many times in Afghanistan. However, the light blue was underpinned by a battle-worn grey.

Hamish smirked, turning to look back, throwing his arms wide enthusiastically.
He quickly rinsed the remaining suds of shampoo from his hair before shutting the shower off and haphazardly ruffling a towel over his hair to partially dry it. He wrapped the towel around himself, fixing it in place, and gathered up the pile of dirty clothes he'd discarded on the floor before heading into the bedroom.
be okay? It frustrated him – the underling sense of guilt that came with having to go behind his Dad's back. But the decision had been made for him by his Dad's restrictive and incessant
“Northumberland Fusiliers”, Hamish remarked, nodding towards the badge's position on the lapels of the man's jacket.
Hamish turned away and, after a brief pause to collect himself, continued. “I can't make y-”.
In which Hamish is a teenager, Sherlock acts like one and John is frustrated.
The colour drained from John's face. “Oh god.” And just like that, the warm aura that had cloaked the room had been shattered. Suddenly the pieces were coming together – Sherlock's swift exit, Hamish leaving school early. He swallowed thickly, he'd been so convinced that they'd listened to him for once, that for
lost?
“It's obvious he wanted to keep it from you until he knew for certain. He wanted to surprise you.” Sherlock provided by way of explanation.
“Something was different about this one”, he commented simply, allowing John the space to add what he wished or to ignore the remark completely. He felt John nod against his chest, and his hand tighten its grip on his shirt.
Oh gosh I am so sorry! I had a draft for this when I posted the last chapter but I somehow lost it and, well, with life being as hectic as it is lately with Uni prep and whatnot, a rewrite has taken me a while! But here you go. Enjoy?
The reason you're here today, on the behalf of the MOD, you're wearing your regiment insignia and introduced yourself as 'Private' so we both know how I knew your military affiliation. As for the exact conflict you were involved in, a few observations made is easy to alienate those two. The way you walk, a slight lull in your gate – unnoticed by most people, but evident to me that you have either a whole or partial prosthetic, am I right?” George confirmed the deduction by nodding. “
“Forced killings, yeah”, Hamish finished grimly. His voice was grace but quieter as he added. “The killer is a victim too. They're being forced to beat people to death. Somehow they're finding a way to leave these messages on the bodies before they're forced to drag them to a ditch somewhere.” Hamish clenched his eyes shut for a moment, his nose wrinkling slightly in disgust. He could feel John tense slightly beside him, and he knew that he too was struggling to keep the bile from rising in his throat. This case had turned out to be bigger than any of them had anticipated. Bigger, and infinitely more sick and twisted.
“Three victims in as many days. Latest of which was a Mr Harold West, investment banker, discovered this morning but has been dead for around 24 hours, making him yesterday's victim.” There was a grim urgency in Hamish's voice, the words
him; he was so startled by the prospect of his own humanity that he simply turned away from it.
“Oh, not Mr Holmes.” She cut him off before giving a small apologetic smile for interrupting him. She was so polite that it was almost absurd, John thought he liked her some. She could come again. “George Benson wishes to see you”, she added.
--------
“Afghanistan or Iraq?”
Beat.
Hamish chuckled slightly, wincing a little at the pain that tiny movement caused. “Are you here to babysit me?” he said, his eyes twinkling with mischief akin to that of a 8 year old.
The chances that George Benson could outrun a perfectly fit and healthy teenage boy were slim from the off, but doing it with a prosthetic leg was nigh on impossible. And yet he soldiered onwards, following Hamish down the two flights of stairs. His lungs were burning and his good leg was screaming at him to stop, each cell protesting in earnest. As he exited the building heaving a huge breath, he cursed as he saw Hamish mounting a police motorcycle
Much love!
Sherlock would outlive God trying to have the last word, and yet this text remained without response.
