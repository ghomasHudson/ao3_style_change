The moment he entered the room, the smell of John Watson flooded his nostrils, so much so that Sherlock stood there for a moment, closing his eyes and taking it in. Before he was entirely aware of what he was doing, he wandered over to John’s closet, opened the doors, and pulled out the first nightshirt he could reach. He pressed the shirt to his face and took a deep breath, and a smile teased his lips as he imagined John in the room with him. Knowing that his boyfriend wouldn’t mind in the slightest, Sherlock took off his suit and donned John’s nightshirt (inside out, as the tags always irritated him) and a pair of his pajama bottoms. The clothes were simultaneously too big and too small for him; the shirt and the waist of the pants were too large for Sherlock’s thin body, while the legs of the pants and the sleeves of the shirt were too short due to Sherlock’s tall stature.
John turned to Mycroft, mouth open, ready to reprimand him for disrespecting Harry – ready to yell at him if he needed to – but then he saw Mycroft’s face. It was still turned downward, and he was still staring at the paper he was writing on, but his entire demeanor had changed. His hands shook, and John found a droplet of moisture at the tip of his nose. It dripped down to the table, staining his paper, and John turned back to Harry.
John only stopped trying to read the previous victors once they left for the stage with the mayor of District 9. He fought for his thoughts – for rational thinking –
Once there was only one person left, John and Harry stood up and began to make their way down the aisle to where Dean was standing.
But, despite the overabundance of irises (a Johnlock symbol the two lovers tended to separate themselves from most of the time), the fact that just about all of Panem showed up to see Sherlock and John exchange their vows, and the fact that Sherlock spent most of that morning grumpy and wondering if it was too late to call the whole thing off and just make their wedding a footnote in the Capitol newspaper, Sherlock remembered the day quite fondly. The two were wed in April, between John’s twenty-second and Harry’s nineteenth birthdays. Alexander Waters served as John’s best man, and Harry served as Sherlock’s, and President Dean Bainbridge officiated the entire thing. He remembered the exchanging of vows like they had been spoken only yesterday:
It was still hitting him – the pain spreading across his chest and seeping into his brain – when Archie Neal was killed, mid laugh, from about ten different angles.
“The world is woven from billions of lives, Harry; every strand crosses every other,” Sherlock explained. “What we call premonition and psychic ability is just movement of the web. If you could attenuate to every strand of quivering data, the future would be entirely calculable – as inevitable as mathematics.”
. If you knew about what he had done you would’ve thrown all caution to the wind in order to kill him.”
“It seems that my brother has taking a liking to you, so I thought I would formally introduce myself, and congratulate you on making it this far.” He put out his hand for John to shake. “Hannibal Lecter Magnussen; it’s my pleasure to make your acquaintance.”
“What do you plan to do, now that the Hunger Games are over for good?” Dean asked – a person whose identity could not be ignored.
It finally hit John full-on now, just like it was hitting Sherlock over and over again with each shuddering breath he took: Mycroft Holmes was dead.
He saw the way Harry’s eyes lit up as Louise entered her line of sight, and John smiled to himself. Now that he didn’t have to be hyper-focused on Sherlock or trying to save him and Harry or his own problems one-hundred percent of the time, he was finally able to realize that Harry had a little bit of a crush going. He had no idea if Louise liked girls that way, but Harry was never one to fall for the straight girl, or for the first girl who was nice to her. Whatever this was, or whatever it was going to be, John was happy – after the past few days Harry had been through, she deserved whatever sort of happiness that came her way, whether it be a girlfriend or just a new best friend.
He then turned around again, and quickly walked in the direction that had to lead him to Harry – now, save for the sound of the Ravenstag behind him, completely on his own.
“Well, apparently he didn’t need to try to put anything in my drink – all he needed for me was a syringe.”
He stared at his watch, and every time the second hand passed over the twelve again, he changed the numbers coming from his mouth. He focused on that, and the sound of the ticking, and the sound of his words.
“So you can map out a maze you’ve never seen before in your life but you can’t predict the future? Damnit.” Harry snapped her fingers, like her plans had just been foiled, and Sherlock huffed out a breath of laughter, rolling his eyes.
Sherlock ran through the jungle, his legs aching and his mind so tired he could fall apart at any moment, but he ran as other images – spectral-like images of past Hunger Games tributes – surrounded him, lunged at him whispering and shouting and collapsing into smoke if he swung his sword at them –
It was mid-spring, just after Harry’s seventeenth birthday, the next time Sherlock ran away from home. John had gone into town to run errands, while Sherlock insisted on staying home to wait for Harry to return home from school. When John returned, however, Sherlock was gone.
John watched as Harry worked on the screen in the sponsors’ offices’ lobby, biting his lip so hard he tasted blood.
Because he cared about Sherlock. He cared and Sherlock only took advantage of him – because he thought he’d always be there – and now he was gone –
A chill went through Sherlock at his words. Of course – he had smelled Sherlock’s morphling addiction before from standing right next to him – of
Before John knew exactly what he was doing, John grabbed onto Mycroft’s sleeve. Mycroft looked down at John, and saw the fear in his eyes. He leaned down, and, once his ear was in line with John’s mouth, John breathed what he needed to say:
And then, suddenly, Sherlock was overwhelmed by affection for Harry Watson. After knowing her for all these years, he never once had to explain himself, or John, or their relationship to her. He never once had to apologize for ruining any sibling quality time John and Harry might’ve had over the past year due to Sherlock’s overall refusal to leave John’s side. She had always been there, ever since the beginning, and had never asked questions, never judged, and always loved Sherlock, despite all of his shortcomings.
“You’re early,” John stated, feeling his appetite start to leave him. Did Snow want to see them now? What had changed that had made him move up their meeting?
One of Sherlock’s Peacekeepers opened the door to the launch room, and Sherlock found Mycroft Holmes, standing before a table filled with food, with an empty plate in front of him.
“Brace yourself, John,” Sherlock told him on the elevator ride up to the penthouse, despite his stomach slowly turning itself into a giant knot.
As soon as Sherlock entered the room, he could see him – his white prison jumpsuit and greying hair standing out against the dark grey room he was held in.
“I just...I was so preoccupied with saving you that I forgot how much you could take on by yourself.”
me,” Sherlock promised. “Neither of you will ever believe me when I say this, but I think he wanted me to be his friend,” he revealed, watching his two friends carefully – gauging their reactions.
At exactly noon, Sherlock opened his bedroom door and exited the room, just in time to see Harry Watson walking down the hall – walking his way.
The room stayed silent as the person who asked the question refused to answer Hannibal’s question and went to sit down again. John supposed that it was satisfactory – everyone knew what happened, at least.
“Sherlock... I can’t even...” she started before the fell into sobs again. “This is so fucking stupid...”
“There were three people I never wanted to see in this year’s Hunger Games,” Mycroft said quietly. “I’m sure you can imagine who the first two were. The third was Charles Augustus Magnussen.” He then turned to look at the three of them, eyes dangerous. “He is a shark, and his brother is as well; the Magnussen brothers are worse than anything you will ever encounter.” He looked at John alone for a moment. “Even Moriarty. They use their power, Hannibal’s power from being a victor, really, to hurt everyone around them. They are manipulators; they can tell your deepest pressure points upon first glance and they will use that to hurt you.”
“He’s fine. Great, actually,” Sherlock said, hearing the pride in his voice. John was great, and they were both living their best lives, doing their best to not give a second thought to the Magnussen brothers – but then that letter arrived and
wasn’t in that room. Whenever the thought derailed his train of thought, he pushed through it, even though he could hear in his own voice how quickly it upset him.
“They have no idea, and I’d rather them not knowing about any of this until the last possible second; it would only stir panic. I’m afraid that if they knew what was going on they’d wouldn’t be able to hold themselves together during the interview. Or worse, try to miss their final interview so they could come rescue you with me.”
“You’re going to see Mycroft?” he asked, and Antonia and Alexander turned back to look at him. They exchanged a worried glance before Alexander replied, slowly.
Dean, who had been in the middle of a conversation with Mycroft, stopped mid-sentence, and turned toward the screen, his eyes suddenly dead. He knew what was happening. As far as anyone was concerned, Steven Bainbridge was already gone.
They fell into each other’s arms, and then took a step away from each other. They looked into each other’s eyes, and for the first time since John had come home, there was no spark in Sherlock’s eyes.
John and Harry had agreed to sit on the edge of the first completely empty row closest to the stage, which ended up being about three rows back. People were still filing in, though, and apparently everyone wanted their own space, so there ended up being people taking their seats a few chairs away from where John and Harry were waiting. Harry had stubbornly insisted that they leave the seat at the absolute edge of the row empty, and that she would take the seat next to it. At first, John wasn’t sure why, but the reason became clear when Louise Neal took the seat next to her, as if they had previously promised that whoever was there first would save the other a seat.
That morning, Mycroft and John had exited their respective rooms to find that both of them had had the same idea: wear black, just like they had for the reaping ceremony. John had made a half-hearted joke that one of them should go back and change, but they never did. Now, looking around, John found eighteen other black outfits, and it took a moment for him to see the trend: the people in black were the mentors who had a sibling going into the Arena. At first, John was confused as to why he only saw one black suit in District 2’s and District 11’s group of chairs, but he quickly remembered that District 11’s tributes shared the same sibling (William Smallwood), and District 2’s male tribute was James Sholto, the older brother of Cal Sholto, who had died a few years after he was crowned victor. The only mentor who was there and had a sibling as a tribute but wasn’t wearing black out of respect for their sibling was, of course, Hannibal Magnussen, who instead wore a plaid suit so ugly that John wanted to set it on fire the moment he laid eyes on it.
“It’s okay. It’s been hard enough for you – I’m not gonna be the stupid kid sister and try to fight for your attention.”
“Thank you, and congratulations to you on your brother’s continued survival,” Mycroft said, and John was amazed at how civil he was being, considering he was the man who killed and ate Will Graham, and the brother of the man who assaulted John just a few days ago. “May I ask what your final verdict is? I’m curious.”
“Yes –” Sherlock breathed, and then someone – Harry, John and Sherlock were both relieved to find – grabbed each of their shoulders, speaking so loudly and quickly that John could barely keep up:
“In – In the City Circle of the Capitol –” Louise began to explain, and Mycroft put his hand on her shoulder and carried on for her.
Sherlock’s fingers traced the words on the page, where the paper had been slightly water damaged and the now-dry ink had run while it was wet. Mycroft had cried while writing this entry – Sherlock couldn’t remember ever seeing his brother cry – and the only other entry Sherlock could tell Mycroft cried while writing was the entry he wrote on his seventeenth birthday, where Mycroft expressed his desire to end his own life, complete with a list as to why he should or shouldn’t (Sherlock’s name was listed under the reasons why he shouldn’t, in capital letters that took up half the page). Sherlock’s addiction – Sherlock being that close to death – sparked that same emotion from his brother.
“Is this little Sherly?” she asked, reaching out towards Sherlock. “Myc’s told me all about you – you’re such a peach! How old are you, now?”
“I know,” Sherlock said, nodding. How could he not? He had been counting the minutes since he had woken up.
The moment Archie appeared on the screen, calling Sherlock’s name from his podium, it all hit Sherlock like a bullet to his heart: just five days ago, Archie Neal was alive and well. In fact, twenty-one other people had also been alive and well, too, but now they were all dead – all within a span of four days.
The boy hid behind Atala’s leg, still staring at Sherlock with the one eye that Sherlock could see, mumbling something.
He heard a voice, pulling him from the thought of his potential future – from the feeling of fear and pain –
He slowly walked by the casket on his way to the stage, and found that he couldn’t pull his eyes away from his brother –
John was immediately put down by his reply, and was about to awkwardly tell Dean to forget he said anything and back his way out of the conversation when Dean looked back at him.
Mycroft shares the details of the last Quarter Quell with John; Sherlock and Harry attend their first training session; Sherlock makes an unexpected friend; Harry makes John and Mycroft aware of the friend Sherlock has made.
“I wouldn’t do that if I were you, Johnny Boy,” Charles Augustus muttered, and John’s blood ran cold, a thousand memories rushing through his mind. “I’m a tribute, don’t you forget. No one can touch me, and that goes triple for you.” As he spoke, he stepped forward, and John stepped back. “A mentor hurting a tribute from an opposing District; I wonder how that would look. I bet they’d have you killed for even laying a finger on me; for even the suggestion of sabotage. I, on the other hand...can do anything I want.” John felt the wall touch his back. He had nowhere to go, and Charles Augustus was still coming closer – leaning towards him – getting in his face – “I’m a tribute, John, which means that, right now, I own everything. The Capitol – the audience – the other tributes –
“But seriously, the horses? They’re all beautiful,” she said quietly, touching one of their horses’ muzzles.
“They could ensure that something got to Harriet’s leg, or place the tribute most likely to commit suicide next to Robert Frankland, or have an area with freezing temperatures set aside to lead Sherlock into. The possibilities are endless, honestly.”
“We’re breaking up,” he decided, but it took a few seconds of horrified staring for Mrs. Hudson and the prep team to get that he wasn’t serious.
And, without even pausing to think about it, John pulled down the neck of his shirt to display his branding, and Sherlock snapped his eyes shut, turning away.
“I knew absolutely nothing. I knew that Mycroft and some of the Hunger Games’ past victors were close, but I had no idea that he was leading a revolution.”
Suddenly, the dog tags around Sherlock’s neck weighed heavy in a way they never had before. The moment Sherlock had been waiting so damn long for – for forever, it seemed – was finally here.
They were almost there, almost to him, when Harry let go of Sherlock’s hand. He looked back at her, and she nodded toward her brother, even though it looked like she was fighting against herself to hang back.
“Yes, but the Capitol has created an image of you, brother mine. You have to keep that image alive.”
The three of them ran faster – as fast as they could and gained a bit more of the ground they had lost on the Peacekeepers. Soon, they were full lengths of hallways away from their pursuers.
Sherlock scoffed, rolling his eyes, and he could practically hear Harry’s voice in his as he made his retort:
She tensed at the sound of his brother’s name spoke aloud, and Sherlock knew exactly why – she had been playing him the entire time for power – sure, he had probably been playing her since he realized her true motives, but it was for freedom. She treated his death like it was necessary and she refused to say his name – she had dehumanized him to the point where he wasn’t even a person – not even part of the twenty-eight mentors who died last night – he was just a body between her and the position of power. Feeling his anger begin to bubble over, he looked to the Peacekeepers on either side of her. “You already know who I am and who I’m related to. Keep her away from me.”
Sherlock and John do get to see the coast. They visit at least once a year, taking their children and/or Harry and Louise with them. But they discovered it completely by themselves.
“Yeah, yeah, sure; whatever you say, you shithead,” Harry chuckled, punching him lightly on his unwounded shoulder. With a sigh, she looked back up at the birds – at the mockingjays that Sherlock could now see in the trees – the last birds finishing the last notes. “It’s funny how something so monstrous can become so beautiful.”
“I was thinking about her, and I was thinking about you, and there’s a handful of girls in my District who have come to me and told me that Magnussen had done the same to
That’s where he had seen the Ravenstag before, on that disc – the Capitol had sent them to attack a few of the tributes twenty-five years ago.
“I know I wasn’t there for a lot of it – I know you’ve only just met me so I haven’t seen much interaction between you and Mycroft in person – but I do know Mycroft, and he loved you, Sherlock. Christ, he did this –
“I say we forget our plans to be nice little rule-followers and make them feel sorry for what they’re doing,” John suggested.
“GET THEM!” Caesar yelled from behind them, and then they saw Alexander Waters – who had lifted the visor of his helmet to ensure that the four would run to him and not another Peacekeeper – being grabbed by a real Peacekeeper in the wings.
Mycroft has a discussion with John about Dean and Alexander; Sherlock, still unconscious, makes his way to the island.
Harry nodded slightly, and opened her mouth to reply, when another Jabberjay landed on a nearby branch, and made a similar call:
I think I'm gonna take a break? I'll probably start posting again when Mycroft's Games are done and then I'll work on the AU (hopefully I'll be better by then). I'm thinking I'll be posting again by Summer's end, if not earlier.
Sherlock smiled up at him, sheepishly, as if he had just gotten caught with his hand in a cookie jar.
“Try not to focus on the logistics; all you need to do is press the button, scan the card, and let the Capitol’s technology do the rest. By the way, I haven’t asked you: how are you doing since the whole Magnussen debacle?”
“Yeah – first person with a disability to win the Hunger Games. I mean, I know that a few of us are missing eyes and limbs and other things, but she was pretty much
“Do you know how to get there?” he asked. She nodded, and he grabbed her hand. “Let’s go,” he said, and led her down to the opening to the third floor, where he got them to the elevator.
“It was a marriage proposal,” he said, quickly, as if trying to say it out loud before he thought better of it. “Just. By the way.”
“Sherlock – Sherlock,” he called to him, putting his hand on his cheek to get his attention, just as the cheering was beginning to die down. Sherlock took John’s hand from his cheek and kissed it, his eyes watching his face. More than anything in that moment, John didn’t want to be the one to break Sherlock’s heart, to shatter his dreams and shove him into the harshest of realities, but he had to. “Vatican cameos,” he muttered, and Sherlock’s eyes widened and his smile fell into nonexistence.
think to also get lubricant – but to answer your question,” Sherlock went on, waving the thought away, “Dean was technically Mycroft’s mentor for the Games. At end of everything, Mycroft probably felt like he could tell him anything, which is why he went to him six months after his win and told him about his plans for the rebellion. By the time I was about to turn twelve, asking him for help with…that…was probably nothing, especially once he deduced that Dean would, indeed, help him with that.”
“So, what are we doing?” John asked, as he and Mycroft walked through the doors into the main lobby, following the groups of mentors into one of the elevators John hadn’t been allowed to use until now. “What’s this meeting about?”
“Dean was Mycroft’s best friend?” John asked without thinking, confused. He hadn’t actually put two and two together until now.
As soon as Sherlock’s pen lifted from the paper, he felt something shift inside of him – a tense muscle loosening, a weight lifting, both of which Sherlock had become so used to bearing that he had forgotten they existed in the first place. Hannibal was going to die, and he would never be able to pester Sherlock or John or even Hamish or Rosamund – he would never be able to ruin their lives, now.
But maybe he had missed the similarities between them. Or maybe Mycroft had kept the similarities hidden – he
And, for both Sentiment and Constantly, whenever I wanted to get anybody's exact words from BBC Sherlock itself, I used a fanmade transcript that literally saved my shit while writing this fic, and their link is here:
Sherlock briefly considered writing about everything, too – physically sorting out his mind palace in the hopes that it would also sort things out in his head, as well – but, upon realizing that he had no idea where to even
Sherlock must’ve been thinking the same thing – feeling the same anger that John was feeling – for he caught an iris out of the air, put it behind Harry’s ear, held her hand, and raised their arms together above their heads.
“Hm.” He closed his eyes and took a deep breath through his nose, and exhaled. Sherlock was still trying to figure out what he was doing when he opened his eyes and spoke. “I smell a dog, and wheat grain beneath that shaving lotion. It’s something a child would select, isn’t it? Is there a child in your life in District Nine, Mr. Holmes?”
or if he didn’t know, he was going to find out very quickly – very soon. Everyone was stuck between looking at John and looking at the screen above them – he’d find out in front of everyone – in front of Harry, in front of the Gamemakers, the paparazzi,
“Because he thought that we’d be here,” Dean replied, lowering his arm. “He gave me a set of instructions to follow in the event that…this happened. The set of instructions came with the key. He told me that he had a strongbox hidden in his room – he had said that you’d find it. And you did, just like he said you would. So please, just take the key,” he said, offering it to Sherlock again.
“Yes, they wanted a brief word with Mary’s family, but they should be at your house, right now,” Cinna replied.
“Because if something goes wrong, he’ll win the Hunger Games,” Sherlock replied. “Not to mention the fact that if you keep ingesting the fear gas, you won’t be of a clear mind – not clear enough to fight him. It’s got to be me. But
But as they followed the hallway as it twisted and turned around them, Sherlock glanced at his brother, watching in vain as he got red in the face, puffing in breaths. Sherlock could practically read Mycroft’s thoughts – trying to convince himself to keep going, despite his body not wanting to.
“Alright,” John said, taking it in stride; if there was really a problem, Sherlock would probably bring it up after the party, once they were in private. As he reached toward the next dessert they agreed to share, Sherlock caught his hand.
“Well then, don’t,” Sherlock ordered. “Stop trying – you don’t need to, anymore.” He then looked down at their hands – their fingers still intertwined on top of the box that contained the book all about them – his eyebrows furrowed together, as if trying to decide something.
And, with that word alone, James Sholto sprinted toward Aurora Blake, his hunting knife out, ready to bowl her over –
When John wasn’t focused on work or being whoever he needed to be for Sherlock and Harry, and when his mind found itself going over details of the Games in his head, he took to writing it down. He ordered a notebook from the Capitol (this was one of the only things that Dean kept from Snow’s old regime; the victors of the Hunger Games could place orders to the Capitol for supplies or food to be shipped to their District, but Dean added that the mayors of each District could do this, as well), and as soon as he received it he started writing.
He would exist in the Holmes household like a guest, not touching anything and, when he had to, leaving it exactly the way Sherlock and Mycroft had left it. He would claim the guest room as his own, unable to sleep in Sherlock's room like he had so many times before. He would, however, sometimes just sit in the middle of Sherlock's room on the floor. He would barely eat, even though not only everyone on the watch team but also everyone in District 12 provided John with meals once they heard that John Watson was living in the Victor's Village alone. He wouldn't sleep, refusing to until he ended up passing out in random places within the house, mostly on the floor of Sherlock's room. He grew angry at any sign of help, even though he was surrounded by it. He waited for death to take him.
He thought back to Helen Hewlett, the girl who was Magnussen’s favorite. He had watched the girl grow up, been neighbors with her, and then took her trust and showed her how to never trust anyone again. He did this with so many people – made them feel weak and powerless. They were all his puppets, John included.
“Would you like to talk about it?” Mycroft finally asked, his eyes finding Sherlock’s again, and Sherlock shook his head quickly.
“Natural high, I assure you,” Sherlock promised, his mouth still full. “I’m just glad to be alive!” he practically sang.
“Are you angry with me for telling everyone about your assault?” Sherlock asked, and John shook his head.
about his opponent in the end, but given the fact that there wasn’t a person John hated more than Jim, John didn’t care.
Finally, when he was done he sat on the edge his bed and opened the box, revealing five small bottles filled with the clear liquid, a single syringe, ready to go, and a plastic baggie filled with extra needles, just like the contents of the box he had found when he was nearly twelve years old, the first time he used.
For the first time in a long time, that night seemed like a normal night – well, as normal as it could be, considering where everyone was and what had happened. Both Sherlock and John went through their nightly routines in John’s bathroom one at a time (Sherlock first, John second), and though they were quiet, barely talking to each other as they went through said routines, it seemed like everything was fine – like the Watson parents were still alive in District Twelve – like Mycroft was still alive in his office next door. Like they were just taking a vacation in the Capitol, and the Seventy-Fifth Annual Hunger Games – and all the events that took place leading up to and after said Games – never happened.
The man glanced at the pouting Harry Watson, sighed again, and pinched the bridge of his nose for a moment, then grabbed the arm of the nearest Avox, who just happened to be passing by.
“GO – MOVE –” he shouted over the noise, and John’s feet finally caught up with what had happened, and he started running.
He then looked down at the list and pointed at another name, about twenty places below Victor’s name:
“Go on, Twelve,” she ordered, but Sherlock continued walking. When he was five steps away from Archie, he kneeled down, getting to his level like Mycroft used to do when he was a child.
So, I was rereading this chapter for one last editing session before I posted this and I cried, so...good luck. ;)
“Sherlock!?” she cried, taking him off of her back and laying him on the ground. She put her fingers in front of his mouth, trying to feel for his breath.
“You have…two children, don’t you?” he asked, and Sherlock set his jaw and tightened his fists, but his heart raced with fear.
He believed in him – why would he say that to him, after everything? Knowing what was going to happen – knowing of his plan – knowing what he had to do?
Sherlock’s stomach seized up. What if he could read him like a book – like Sherlock was always able to do with him? They had known each other for years – John could’ve picked up some of his deductive reasoning –
“It can only exist in human flesh. It can only be transmitted through cannibalism, and therefore no one thought to find a cure. This means that, unfortunately, I will be dead before this time next year.”
In lieu of a reply, Mycroft put his visor back down, and then he was gone, closing the door behind him.
“That sounds fine to me,” Sherlock replied, nodding, before he spotted one of Harry’s arrows sticking out of one of the hedges nearby. “Did someone find us?” he asked.
Not a single part of John believed that Sherlock had earned it, though. Yes, he had made the decision to start, but he didn’t deserve this.
“Do you have any more of John’s knives?” he asked, and Harry nodded, turning to her bag and looking through it. “I need two of them.”
Watch How You Go by Keane (for Mycroft telling Sherlock to live his life and not be riddled with guilt)
“You are a mentor, John – you’re supposed to be helping the tributes, not pulling stunts like this! President Snow told me to tell you this: if you misbehave again, if you put another toe out of line, very bad things will happen. Do you or do you not understand the precariousness of your situation now?”
Harry seemed so sure of herself – like she knew exactly what to do once she hit the water. If Sherlock wanted to keep Harry safe he was going to have to learn to swim – and fast.
John went on, fidgeting as he spoke, but Sherlock stopped paying attention once he caught sight of a light – of the sun bouncing off of something on his hand – a ring on his finger –
“Sherlock...” John heard Mycroft whisper from beside him, almost as if he wanted to reprimand him for going after the sword. They watched as Sherlock ran back over to Archie, swung the boy onto his back again, and, checking one more time for Harry Watson, sprinted off.
been talking about it!” she looked at Sherlock and cupped her hand around her mouth, blocking John’s view as she worded to him: “How is he?”
I know that they're adopted, but Hamish looks just like Sherlock and Rosie looks just like John, and they both inherited Sherlock's genius.
After Mrs. Watson said her goodbyes to her “baby boy”, telling him that Sherlock was “so special,” and Mr. Watson said his goodbyes to his daughter, John stepped forward.
–” he spun around, toward the tributes and past victors. They were staring. They were staring because they knew. Everyone knew. He searched for words – trying to get them to forget – trying to make them not write him off as an addict –
And he did. He stayed with John all throughout the night, trading stories of Sherlock back and forth between them. They recalled the times when Sherlock came home from school almost daily with a poor-behavior slip pinned to his uniform, with reasons ranging from “bit another student” when he was four to “calling the teacher a ‘f***ing idiot’” when he was sixteen, with loads of merits for deducing personal details about his teachers and fellow students in between. Their mother never gave Sherlock more than a partially stern talking-to, and when she passed away, Mycroft did the same. Their mother was good; she never wanted her boys to feel bad for their genius, even though their teachers probably wanted nothing more than to see the Holmes boys come into school the next morning struggling to sit down because of the trouble their mouths had gotten themselves into. But Mrs. Holmes never once hit either of them, and so Mycroft never hit Sherlock, because his mother taught him better than that.
“Whatever you have to say to me you can say in front of Mycroft,” he told him, and it was only when Snow raised his eyebrows at John that he realized that this was the first time he had spoken freely since they had entered the room.
if it wasn’t for him. He was supposed to be here, today, honoring the dead with us, acting as the new president of Panem instead of me –” It was here that he took a shaky breath, pursing his lips looking skywards, trying to keep it together – to stay professional. It took a moment for him to get his emotions in check, and then he continued. “This part of the service was never supposed to exist. Unfortunately, however, Mycroft did not live to see the world that he created; Mycroft Holmes was killed by Peacekeepers during the Battle For Panem, spending his final moments protecting those he loved. But he was fully aware that this fate was a possibility – he had plans in place in the event of his passing.”
“Do you think I haven’t?” Hannibal asked. “Everything I’ve done is to protect myself and those I care about.”
“I’ll be back soon,” he promised his family, then looked up at John as Hamish let go of Sherlock. “Would you mind, giving me a minute…?”
Twenty-five years old – Mycroft was only twenty-five years old. And now he would remain that way forever – all of these people would be frozen in time, unable to age for another second, all because of this.
But then, Sherlock slowly let go of Harry, making sure she knew that he was letting her go, so she didn’t fall to her knees as soon as they separated. He then approached John, slowly, as if approaching a wounded animal he wanted to befriend – and maybe that’s all John was, now; a broken boy, far beyond repair.
“It’s loose – help me, would you?” Sherlock asked, and together they pulled the loose board off of the floor, revealing a whole mess of dust and insulation and –
“That was quite rude of you to say, John Watson,” Hannibal said, his narrowed eyes trying to pierce into John’s skull.
“Sorry, they’re gone,” he said, glancing up at the screen. “I don’t think they’re coming back from this.”
“You owe me, big time,” Harry informed him. “Because, like, that whole situation was a whole different Arena, really.”
“William will be more difficult to dispose of, of course, but I’ll take care of him. I’ll take care of both of them, don’t you worry. I’ll try to be quick – no promises, though,” he chuckled, and – as punishment for not giving him a reaction, John supposed – he licked the side of John’s face.
Including this, which Sherlock could’ve very easily kept from John, Sherlock thought to himself as he reached one of the closest entryways to the park and waved down a taxi. When he was first making plans for the trip out, he considered catching a Capitol bus to deliver him where he needed to go, but then he thought of all the eyes of the other passengers, and he decided that the taxi would be much more private.
“So he knew?” Sherlock asked, panic slowly rising within him. “That he was going to die?” If he did know,
Even though John knew exactly where Sherlock was, and even though there were only a few walls between them, John was still wary without Sherlock by his side. He kept glancing nervously over in the direction his boyfriend had left in, anxiously waiting for his return.
And then, even though he had been walking with Antonia for the past ten minutes, and even though he knew they were allies, Sherlock ripped her away from John and – within seconds – before he could even notice what he was doing – he had her pinned against the wall, his arm across her neck, glaring at her darkly.
“Sure, blame Mrs. Hudson for your obsessions,” Harry said, crossing her arms, back to her usual self.
“Yes,” Sherlock interrupted, not really wanting to hear what John wanted to say, for they were technically still in the middle of a fight about whatever had happened the day before.
But their pictures weren’t in the sky – Archie Neal’s was, reminding Sherlock of what he had done – the mistake he had made, just a few hours ago.
The following day, Sherlock tried to act as if everything was completely fine. He walked to school with John and Harry, he paid attention in class just as Mycroft wanted him to, he bantered in between classes with John, and surprisingly, despite a few instances where Sherlock would meet John’s eyes and be reminded of the John in Sherlock’s dream – was reminded of his newly-realized feelings – it wasn’t that bad. In fact, there were times throughout the day where Sherlock completely forgot he even had the dream in the first place. Certainly, it was manageable –
“In the Capitol,” Sherlock replied, gritting his teeth in anger while saying the words, tears still flowing down his cheeks in a steady stream.
“I’m not in a walking coma,” John assured him. “And I won’t be in the morning, either. I am a survivor of these Games I don’t need to sleep –”
“You’re a mentor, so I would suggest that you still look somewhat presentable, but I think you know what to do.”
“Don’t worry,” Sherlock said quietly, still avoiding his eyes. “No matter what he says to me, no matter what I want to say in reply, I’m not going to be clever. I’m just going to keep the whole conversation simple and brief.”
Sherlock passed his sword to Harry, and held Charles Augustus’ glasses in front of his face, watching the lens, trying to find something, any sort of words or files – but finding none.
“I will. Later,” he said, forcing himself to pick up the case and turn himself around completely. “We should probably go back; the others are waiting for us,” he said, picking up the strong box from the floor, and the two exited the room, leaving the dust – leaving the last physical remainder of Mycroft Holmes – in the room.
The second thing he noticed was the red hair of Harry Watson, facing the podium at the back of the room. There was empty seat between her and her brother – a seat they had reserved for Sherlock, which he gladly accepted.
After a few more seconds of looking over the buttons, he typed in the first-most logical code he could make of it: 1895.
He pulled himself up from the bed, untangling himself from the mess of blankets and sheets, thankful that he didn’t have to force himself to move out from under John. As soon as he was out of the bed, he suddenly felt utterly too aware of his body and of his nakedness. He was slim – he had always been thin, nearly everyone in District 12 was, but Sherlock’s metabolism made him positively skinny compared to everyone else – but he skin felt different. The night before, it felt fine – perfect, in fact, as John was touching and kissing it – but this morning it felt as if it was wrapped much too tightly around his bones but also so loose it was hung off of them, simultaneously. He noticed his exposed lower bits felt especially weird this morning, so he pulled the sheet off of the bed and wrapped it around himself, leaving John with the blanket.
When an Avox had reached the mentor’s booth and signaled for John to come with him, Mycroft was instantly at his defense. At first he tried to follow, but the Avox caught on and put his arm out to keep Mycroft from coming along with them.
“It’s alright – I’m okay. Well, I’m doing better than I was – honestly,” Louise added quickly, looking up at Mycroft, as if she could tell that he didn’t believe her. “For right now, I’m just glad that it wasn’t Charles Augustus Magnussen on that stage, you know?”
“And what if we say no?” Aurora asked, crossing her arms, watching Magnussen as James silently fumed between them. “What then?”
“Probably because of Charles Augustus and Sherlock – Charles Augustus won’t respond to anything but both his first and middle name, while Sherlock goes by his exclusively. They probably just decided to announce everyone’s out of fairness, so it wouldn’t seem like anyone was favored over anyone else.”
“Well, um. You know the three year old from District Nine? Archie?” she asked, and John nodded. “Well, Sherlock kind of...comforted him today. Like, a lot. Archie was crying a lot and Atala couldn’t console him and Sherlock just...he just walked up to him and started talking to him. He’s never talked to anyone like he talked to Archie – he was really kind and he didn’t even train; he just stayed with Archie all day...” Suddenly an image flashed across John’s mind: the image of Sherlock and a young child, holding hands – smiling – he knew it was impossible, especially now, but he was sure he was imagining Sherlock Holmes – his Sherlock Holmes – as a father to a child that they called theirs. He shook his head as Harry went on. “I dunno, I just thought it was something you guys would like to know about – something good you might want to remember, I mean, in case...in case something happens – in the Arena –”
“Please…John, please…” he whimpered, before puking again, so hard it left his eyes watering, groaning into the bowl. “…make it stop…”
“The breakfast of champions,” she said, and they clinked their spoons together and dug in. “Or, lunch. Whichever.”
Once the Mycroft-Jabberjay was dead, the rest of the Jabberjays silenced themselves, leaving the two tributes in the now quiet section of the Arena.
“John?” Harry called from her place at the kitchen table, working on homework, hearing John storm through the house as he gathered his winter coat. “Are you –”
“There’s a big celebration of the Games in the City Circle of the Capitol; everyone’s invited, but sponsors’ and victors’ attendance is mandatory. It’s basically one big party where we all gather and watch the Games together that lasts for as long as the Games do.”
But he didn’t kill Beth and Andrew. The real resentment would start the day after next, in District 10, when John met Philip Anderson’s parents. And the day after that, John had to face Victor Trevor’s father.
Time was passing, each second was now adding to a quickly-growing amount of time that he was living without Mycroft Holmes. And, as much as it upset him just thinking about that, each second that passed them by – each tick of his watch – was proof that the world was moving, and that he was surviving without Mycroft Holmes.
“Oh my god – are you okay?” she asked, reaching her hand up to lightly touch the swelling, and Louise nodded.
“It’s understandable,” John said, finally crossing the room and sitting in front of Sherlock, kissing him gently on the lips. “Hey,” he murmured once they parted.
to get arrested for it. Harry, for one, looked to be on cloud nine, and Sherlock, though he was slightly concerned as to what could possibly inspire Hannibal to do something like this, couldn’t stop a feeling of relief from flooding through him.
Before either of them could say anything else, the door opened, and their family poured in, and it was obvious from the looks on their faces that they knew this was goodbye. They knew that their luck had finally run out.
SO. Would you guys want the first chapter of Constantly right now? Even if the second chapter may not come around until like?? Months later?
“Fine,” he said finally, and Sherlock knew that John was making the attempt to calm down. “Okay. Alright. I’m going to go pack my stuff – remember, we’re leaving the day after tomorrow.” He then felt John kiss Sherlock’s hair as he walked by, and then he was gone.
Sherlock turned nineteen in January (five months, twenty-three days, three hours, fifty-five minutes, and twenty-three seconds after Mycroft’s death), and John and Harry had gotten together with Dean to throw a small get-together for him to celebrate, inviting nearly all of the survivors of the from the Mockingjay Alliance that Sherlock knew, plus a few others like Mrs. Hudson, who had not been part of the Alliance but had consequently joined it the moment she fought against Peacekeepers during the Battle for Panem, and John’s old prep team (including Octavia, who took the time to formally apologize to Sherlock and John for making lewd comments about their sex lives this time last year).
Sherlock and John react to the Quell’s Twist; Sherlock makes a decision for John; the four prepare themselves for Sherlock and Harry’s Games in different ways.
“Does it ever bother you that it took me eight years and a public confession to figure out what you had known within five minutes?” John asked, and Sherlock took a minute to consider it before replying.
Sherlock –” she snapped, throwing herself back, glaring up at Sherlock in a rage that put Mycroft’s anger to shame. “What the
And then he threw the soap across the room as hard as he could, and held the sides of his head in his hands.
“I’m sorry, but I don’t recall asking for your opinion,” Mycroft informed him, and John, despite everything, smiled.
“Too bad,” Hannibal said, the smile finally reaching his lips as he took another step forward – leaving about a foot between Sherlock and himself.
Sherlock’s eyes snapped open, and he shot straight up into a sitting position in the same instant. It was then the pain settled in on his muscles, and he groaned, leaning forward and resting his elbows on his knees, putting his head in his hands.
If Hannibal died, after the level Sherlock had stooped to, after everything he had done and all of the bridges he had burned, who would Sherlock have, then?
Sherlock and Harry glanced at each other, knowing that, somehow, this was going to be what John was trying to warn them about.
Sherlock nearly choked on the water he was currently drinking as it spurted from his mouth in surprise. He rounded on his brother.
“I’m sorry?” Sherlock asked, disjointedly. Out of all the things John could say in that moment, he didn’t expect that.
“Did he finally have an epiphany about what he did?” Sherlock asked. As far as the reports went on Caesar, even though he was completely aware of everything he did and his contribution to the Hunger Games, he still thought his role in the Hunger Games was completely innocent – that he only spoke to them and tried to make the look good for sponsors, that he was trying to help them – that it was their own fault that anyone who died in the Games were killed.
“That’s what I said when you wanted to go in the meadow and we still went!” he reminded him, and Sherlock rolled his eyes.
wanted us to. Mycroft even gave me a ring – two, actually. Our wedding rings.” Sherlock then finally let go of John’s hand and dipped his hand into the neck hole of his shirt, and pulled out the necklace John had given him – the two dog tags they had both worn into their Arenas – the necklace John had never asked for Sherlock to return, never thought to – and revealed that the necklace now held two silver bands on either side of the tags. “I had these with me in the Arena,” Sherlock revealed. “I was going to do it – I was going to propose – once we were reunited, up on Caesar’s stage, but then everything happened...” he drifted off, staring at the rings on the chain for a moment, and then came back, looking up at John. “We’ve been split up by forces outside of our control so many times over the past few years that…it’s become obvious to me that I don’t want to ever leave your side again,” he whispered, tears filling his eyes. He composed himself and spoke again, fighting again to keep his voice steady: “With that said...John Watson...would you…will you marry me?”
Later that night, Sherlock began to read Mycroft’s notebooks. There were nine in all; each one holding a year’s worth of notes and lists and personal accounts of daily events. The first one started the day after Mycroft arrived home from his Games, when he was sixteen, and the last one – the one that had been found on Mycroft’s person when he was killed – ended the day of the final interview. Sherlock, who was, in general, a fast reader, took his time reading Mycroft’s notebooks, reading and rereading each page, flipping back whenever Mycroft mentioned a past event just to reread that section again for context before continuing, even if he knew what Mycroft had written about that past event word for word. Mycroft had written so much about his Games and about Sherlock and even about John and Harry, but not a word about the Rebellion, besides the occasional “Met with Dean” scribbled down in the middle of everything else. Everything he
“Given the answer to your last question, would it be safe to assume that you think the Hunger Games are necessary?”
Instinctively, Sherlock’s free hand rose up and gripped John’s dog tags through his jumpsuit, reminding himself of the same.
Idk about any of you, but my anxiety's WAY UP ON TOP OF THE ROOF AND IS ABOUT TO JUMP OFF SOMEBODY COME GET HER with this corona thing (aw look I just super dated the publishing of this fic) but hey! This chapter's cute and somewhat happy! So that's good and wasn't planned at all!
And because Mrs. Hudson willed it so, there was no other option, and so she became the main consultant of the Holmes-Watson wedding. While Sherlock had been perfectly fine with the original plan of a District 12 wedding – a simple exchange of rings and vows in the comfort of their own home in District 9 with a guest list of four at the most (the four guests being Harry, Louise, Dean, and Alexander) – he really got into the planning process of the Capitol wedding that Mrs. Hudson put herself at the head of. John didn’t really care either way about trivial things about color scheme and seating and flower arrangements, as long as the end result of “marrying Sherlock Holmes” was the same, so Sherlock had first say in many of the decisions, running it by John before giving any final answers. There had only been one thing John was adamant about: the appearance of the purple irises at the wedding. He, understandably, wanted the minimal amount of irises present at the wedding (
At one point, he had glanced up to find Hannibal Lecter Magnussen dancing with a member from District 1 on the dancefloor, but he was carefully watching Sherlock at every opportunity. It occurred to him then that Hannibal had probably been watching him all night, and instantly felt too close to him, even though they were nearly thirty feet away from each other.
A little itty-bitty scene I was thinking about writing as a bonus for Advantage was the moment where Dean finds out that Mycroft died during the Battle for Panem, but all I really had for it is one dialogue exchange so I didn't really run with it, so I'll put it here:
“And what, we can’t be the ones to give her the hardest day of her entire life by showing up five minutes late?” Sherlock asked, yet they had begun the walk back anyway, meaning John had won.
“What?!” Harry cried as soon as Caesar revealed the news, the microphone causing her voice to be heard above all of the shouting Capitol citizens, her voice full of so many emotions – fear and anger and sadness and surprise – that it was hard to pin it down with just one word. Her voice tore through Sherlock’s heart, and all he wanted to do in that moment was hug her, to put her behind him, and take the fall for her, just as he should have in the goddamned first place.
to do it. Everyone believed in him. Everyone believed he would he would get Harry out of the Arena alive.
Sherlock glanced around. They seemed to be entirely surrounded by hedges – he recalled Harry saying something about a hedge maze –
And after Dean, everyone else – or at least, it felt like it, because that’s when Sherlock tuned out again. He couldn’t take another speech – another word hammering another nail on his brother’s coffin. So, while Louise and Antonia and Alexander read their eulogies for his brother, Sherlock brought his legs up in front of him, folded his arms onto his knees and buried his head into the space between his torso and his legs, resting his forehead on his arms.
. That was the cause for most of John’s anxiety, and Sherlock was fully aware of that fact. Victor Trevor had been John’s first kill, and not only that but the death that had affected John the most out of all of them. Sherlock knew John hated himself for killing anyone in that Arena, but he hated himself for killing Victor the very most. And now, John had to face Victor’s family and friends and talk about how happy he was that he survived.
“Aurora; welcome back,” Magnussen said, and she nodded back at him. “I saw you got rid of her,” he said, pointing at the sky.
And, ever since Mycroft died, the layer of numbness that had surrounded Sherlock – the layer that kept Sherlock focused on facts and deductions and knowledge – completely shattered, sending Sherlock’s mind reeling.
“You’re not allowed here,” John said quietly, unable to come up with anything actually intelligent to say, and Charles Augustus smirked.
“What?!” the man snapped, spinning around, keeping the gun trained on Harry as she slowly stood up – for what reason, she had no idea – she couldn’t get the upper hand on this man – she couldn’t save Sherlock –
to meet you!” she exclaimed, and Sherlock looked back to find Mycroft waving at his brother, then turning and making his way toward the food.
“They knew something,” Sherlock called up. “They had to have. They’re punishing us, for trying to leave – can’t you SEE what’s going on?!” he shouted, his fingers digging into the meadow. John saw Sherlock uproot the irises and toss them aside in anger, sick of their love story and what it had done to them now, and it felt like he had done the same to John himself – tore him apart.
mentors, after all. We need to know what the tributes are going to face so that we can help them in their preparations.”
President Coriolanus Snow – the person who had been in charge of Panem since before John was born – was dead.
“And that’s just it?” John asked. “You – you gained a few pounds and no one wanted to – to sleep with –”
Harry immediately put her guard up, wiping her eyes (as if Clara hadn’t just caught her crying) and crossing her arms, staring at her with a stony expression.
He went on, gaining speed as he went, despite himself. “And you – you talk about him as if you own him – as if he’s yours, and I know that society has this big thing about people ‘owning’ each other in a sense because they’re sleeping together –” He could feel his anger boiling over, his frustration at the Capitol and his rage at Magnussen, and all he could hear was the sound of his fingers flicking Harry’s face over and over again – and soon he was speaking without even thinking, just to get it out. “– for instance, according to everyone in the Capitol, I ‘have’ John, even though we’ve never had sex and probably never will because I hate it, not to mention the fact that if anyone was ‘having’
“Please stop trying to figure it out,” John whispered, and Mycroft closed his eyes, though John could see him still trying to piece it together behind his eyelids.
In that moment, time itself seemed to stop. This was actually happening – John was alive – he wasn’t dreaming – and someone twice his age was touching him through his pants. No – that couldn’t be right – time wouldn’t stop for something like this. There had to be a clock that was ticking – somewhere in this goddamned place time was still passing...but John couldn’t find the proof.
Sherlock gets a surprise visitor in his hospital room; John eagerly awaits his reunion with Sherlock and Harry; Sherlock reunites with Harry, and they both get a visit from someone important to them, and a message from John.
“He’s – um. We – uh…” he fought for the words. How does one explain to someone that they had been sleeping together, in the same bed, stark naked, without having sex?
“You should not have done that,” Mycroft warned, and Sherlock was reminded of the fact that his brother had once killed others – had the reflexes of a whip.
“My arm!” he gasped in horror, and John took his hand off of him to let him speak. “My arm – it’s broken – you’ve broken my arm!”
“Permission to ask a follow-up question?” she asked, and Dean nodded in approval. She turned back to Hannibal. “On which side were you fighting?”
“Non-verbal communication normally works with Sherlock,” Mycroft explained, and that was able to jog John’s memory.
“That’s right – John’s boyfriend is in this year’s Games!” Caesar cut her off, acting as if he honestly had forgotten, even though the Watson siblings had just informed him of this fact, twice. “John, how do you feel about that?”
Sherlock refused to step backwards – to press himself up against the door – to do what Hannibal wanted him to do. “That you broke into my hospital room to try to convert me? Yes, they know all about that.”
The only people who knew that something was, indeed, awry, was Mycroft and Louise Neal, for now. When he had first arrived into the penthouse and she hugged him and kissed his cheek, he pressed his lips to her cheek, so that anyone who saw the exchange would’ve only seen him return her kiss, but only they knew that he had actually spoken two words into her skin, only loud enough for her to hear:
“Harriet Watson –” John started, his voice gaining a father-like tone that Harry hated him using on her.
But the Avox wasn’t looking at him anymore. She was looking up, signing to other Avoxes as they passed. At first the word seemed unfamiliar to him, but then he remembered – deep in the recesses of his mind – that he had learned that word – Clover had taught it to him –
“Bored?” John asked, looking up at Sherlock, his eyes dark with a feeling Sherlock couldn’t put his finger on. Annoyance? Anger? Fear? “Are you
The moment Caesar revealed the news, the crowd went into hysterics, shouting in rage and shock and booing at Caesar. It was so easy for them – they were citizens of the Capitol – unless they did something outright to rebel against the Capitol, they wouldn’t be punished. They had nothing to lose.
Harry sighed, squeezing his hand as she leaned her head on his shoulder, not needing to say what they both knew the other was thinking:
Also also: putting in links for every single song that reminds me of this fic exactly where the song is featured got really tiring really fast, so I'm going to just list the songs relevant to each chapter in the End Notes, and you can look them up if you want to. :)
John smiled, and then let himself drop back into the straight-faced expression he normally wore, these days.
“Let me look at you,” he said, pulling Mycroft back and holding him at arm’s length – one hand behind Mycroft’s neck, the other on his side; as if they were about to dance. He pursed his lips as he looked his friend over. “Age does not touch you,” he decided, hugging Mycroft again, and Sherlock realized why Mycroft had warmed up to him, in the beginning – he spoke and acted just like his brother.
“Ever since I returned from the Arena – my Arena, last year – I’ve been mentored by the doctors in District Twelve; I’d like to continue that work, so I can start my own practice. But, at the same time, the Games have completely taken over my life for the past year. So, first and foremost, I’m going to take some time to heal. I’m going to grieve the people I’ve lost – my parents, my friends... I’m going to spend time with my sister. I’m going to learn how to have a relationship with my boyfriend without the Capitol’s expectations looming over us. And then, once I’m ready, I’ll face the world again.”
The wind picked up, so hard the cameras shook, and Harry held onto her place in the trees to keep from falling.
Gasps and cries of horror flew through the crowd. John’s eyes snapped shut as he swallowed back the vomit that had suddenly risen in his throat, still unable to look at his boyfriend or his sister, even though he could feel their eyes on him. He had known this was coming – Snow had threatened him to make a choice mere hours ago – but that didn’t stop his knees from weakening, or his heart from trying to pound out of his chest as the need to be sick on stage worsened.
“They think we’re not getting any sleep, anyway,” he said, as if it was the most preposterous thing he had ever heard. But – Sherlock could tell, even in the dark, only seeing John’s face by the light of the moon outside – the kisses had sparked the beginning of a response to the stimulation elsewhere.
Magnussen had flicked Harry’s face to get Sherlock to spill John’s secret – all he had to do was something to someone that was important to him that irked him enough to do whatever he wanted – to spill a secret pertaining to someone that he loved; something that he swore he would never do.
Somehow, John was able to thank Dean and leave the auditorium, his arm around his crying sister’s shoulder.
“I think I’d like to see the ocean,” John said quietly after a few moments of Sherlock silently pushing his head into the doorframe. “It sounds nice. And I know they use it for Arenas sometimes – from what I’ve seen it looks nice –”
His back was to him, at first, but the moment the door closed behind him, the man turned around to see his guest.
Any happiness John felt the night before was gone by the time he awoke the next day. He looked out the window and noticed that it was the crack of dawn – how long had he slept? Three hours, at the most?
“No,” Harry said, shutting down that train of thought immediately. “Apparently the Capitol thinks they’re fucking hilarious and decided to put one hundred bandaids in my pack. But when Mycroft and John sent us stuff for our tracker jacker stings, they also sent gauze and a stitching kit and a numbing agent for your arm.”
During those months, it was extremely physically obvious just how much the Games and the death of his brother was taking a toll on Sherlock. His already slim body lost a lot of what little weight it had, causing for Sherlock’s spine and ribs to protrude from his skin, and his already prominent cheekbones now jutted out of his face. His sleep schedule (John was using the term loosely) was completely fucked – there were nights where he barely slept and days he slept almost entirely through, but they were lucky when it was even that consistent. There were times where Sherlock nodded off over dinner, or John would think that Sherlock was in his mind palace (a place he very rarely visited, nowadays) just to find out that he was asleep on the couch. He looked at the world with tired, sad, empty eyes, which were so different from the bright, alert, piercing eyes that John had fallen in love with. Before, it was so easy to tell that Sherlock was thinking – he was always thinking, his eyes always analyzing the world around him, but looking into his eyes was like looking through a window to his thoughts – there were times when John could watch Sherlock’s eyes and see a deduction being made, and John loved that – he loved seeing that process in his boyfriend’s eyes. But now, it was almost as if his eyes were clouded – John could no longer see the thoughts forming in Sherlock’s eyes, anymore, and that was probably the difference that scared John the most, more than the weight loss or nonexistent sleep schedule.
did you do?” he asked upon entering the room, and, with just a single look at Sherlock, John could see a wall being built within Sherlock’s features, guarding himself, and John instantly knew why: Sherlock didn’t want to tell Dean a thing.
for them to cut her hair – she wanted to do it herself. It was her way of showing the world they were wrong – that she made it through the Bloodbath. It was a reward for her personal victory.
And just like that, the memories came rushing to him, all being played out in his head, one by one. Every time Sherlock insinuated his brother was overweight, every snide remark, every last roll of his eyes. Every disrespectful thing he had ever done to Mycroft came back to Sherlock, each one like a slap in the face.
Sherlock hated absolutely everything in the entire world at this point – not even John’s smile could wipe the scowl from his face. His new prep team was John’s old prep team, which meant he had to deal with Octavia, which he wasn’t pleased about. The second thing that sent his mood into a downward spiral was the fact that the moment he was put into a little room he was stripped down naked. Octavia (of course) made a comment about his genitalia and how much John probably enjoyed it, and then they hosed him down and scrubbed him until his body was as red as his face. He was so close –
“I’m sorry – I wanted you to know that before – and that –” she lost the confidence as quickly as it must have come, and then gained enough of it back to close the distance between them and kiss her.
“As I said before, victors of Districts One through Six will have their hearings today,” Dean went on. “We’ll go in order from least recent to most recent Hunger Games victors within each District, which means that...” he checked a list in front of him on the podium. “Wallace Gregson – victor of the twenty-seventh Hunger Games – you’re first.
“Oh my god,” Dean murmured as Sherlock pulled the box out, turning it every which way, until he found what he was looking for.
Sherlock found that, on the days in which John was home and Harry was not, he was seeking out affection from John more than the days in which all three of them were in the house. In fact, it seemed like just about every kiss they shared – apart from the ones that John would give him on the forehead or cheek at random intervals – turned into a full-blown make out session, where it seemed like both of them were fighting against the urge to tear the other’s clothes off in order to get even closer than they already were.
“What are you doing here?” she asked with a sharpness that shot up Sherlock’s spine. There was a moment where he wondered why she was so angry, but then it came back to him: Clara left Harry when she needed her most, and then spoke badly enough about her to her brother to have him come after her.
It was something that the two had picked up within the last year – an inside joke of sorts. Since Sherlock was more or less living with the Watson’s after John’s win, Sherlock and Harry were more or less always together, but their dynamic had changed from the last time Sherlock had lived with the Watson’s. When they were kids, Sherlock had John, so he didn’t necessarily
“Yes, normally,” Mycroft said quietly. “After one wins the Games, depending on who they are and how physically attractive the Capitol finds them, they…sort of become a sexual icon. And most of the time, it’s sort of…forced.”
“May I ask a follow up?” he asked, and immediately returned his attention to Hannibal once he got the okay from Dean. “I’ve watched your Games – you killed and ate twenty tributes – I counted – and you just told us about Mischa, that bumps you up to twenty-one, and then you were seen killing and taking bites out of random people in the chaos of the final interview, so we can easily round the total of people you have proof of eating up to thirty. Have you eaten more than thirty people?”
As soon as Hannibal stepped away from the podium, Sherlock ran up to the stage, climbing over the edge and closing the distance between himself and John, with Dean following behind him.
Dancing In The Dark - Imagine Dragons (they don't dance to this song but it fits the whole Sherlock dancing thing nicely)
But he had thought it – he had almost said what he had been too afraid to feel this whole time out loud.
“Don’t come any closer – you are not permitted to be here – turn around, kneel down on the ground, and put your hands behind your head – I’ll shoot –”
“Don’t be; you were just a kid. In hindsight, it was actually pretty funny. And, you know, it kind of helped that I grew into my nose…”
As much as he wanted the water to be so hot it boiled his skin, he knew the steam left behind would bring him back to even more panic-inducing times. Instead, he turned the cold water on, and sat in the stream of water until his body was numb.
Sherlock. I’m in love with you,” he said it again, as if maybe having Sherlock see him say it would change his thinking. He took a step forward, putting himself between Sherlock and the others – between Sherlock and the rest of the world – and, for a second, it was almost like they were the only two people in the room. “I’m in love with you, Sherlock. Maybe I haven’t been since the very beginning like you have but, if given the chance, I’d like to make up for it, and hopefully that’ll be enough –”
They led Sherlock and Harry down a series of hallways, and then into a spare room, locking them inside. Sherlock specifically remembered the tributes being separated during this time, and it took him a second to realize why Sherlock and Harry were grouped together: all of the people who would be coming to say goodbye to the tributes this year would be visiting both of them. But this was the first time Sherlock and Harry had been alone together since the Quarter Quell’s announcement – ever since this mess began.
They didn’t need Mycroft to tell them a second time. They all quickly scuttled out of the office, and Mycroft slammed the door behind them. Sherlock and Harry immediately stopped outside of the door to assess the other one’s damage, but John did not break his stride, walking down the hall.
“No they’re not,” Alexander said, crossing the small room to the far wall and moving a ladder and a few mop buckets, and then dug the knife into rubbery cement between the bricks of the wall behind them.
“What about school?” Mrs. Watson asked. “Sherlock was supposed to collect the work John’s going to miss–”
“Looking for inconsistencies?” John asked, nodding to the manifesto once Sherlock looked up. “Because there are a lot of inconsistencies.”
John – being the attentive husband he always had been, picked up on it, and pointed to the left side of the wall, giving Sherlock a moment to collect himself as he spoke.
“You never had to deal with this because of what happened after your win, and you would’ve never had to, because you had John, and John never had to deal with it because he had you. But other victors...most victors, actually... They become the Capitol’s property. They may be freer than most people, but everything they have to offer is the Capitol’s. Including their…sex lives.”
“Come on,” he muttered to Louise, and together the two made their way through the crowd. Alexander spotted them before they reached him, and smiled sadly as Louise closed the distance between them and wrapped her arms around his neck.
“I feel the same way,” he said, suddenly entirely focused by the food on his plate, idly touching the dog tags he still kept under the wetsuit the wanted nothing more than to take off. “And I’m sure Harry does too.”
death – and now I’m back in a nice, warm building with one of my dearest friends and my big brother – are those ginger nuts?!” Sherlock cut himself off upon seeing two cookies on Harry’s tray.
“Mycroft was…equal parts logical and detached, and awed and terrified,” she said, grinning. “He deduced the potential due date and he refused to put his hand on my stomach to feel Myc kick, but…once I started showing – once I
And at first it seemed like everyone was apprehensive to get into the deeper side of Hannibal that everyone knew he possessed, until one of the more recent victors of the Hunger Games took to the podium to ask her question:
That was, until now, Sherlock thought to himself, as he reached one of the closest entryways to the park, and waved down a taxi. When he was first making plans for the trip out, he considered catching a Capitol bus to deliver him where he needed to go, but then he thought of all the eyes of the other passengers, and he decided that the taxi would be much more private.
“What, he didn’t request one with you last year when I won?” John asked, and Mycroft shook his head.
John had started writing about their experiences in the Arena years ago – how it felt, what it was like, and how they were living now that the Hunger Games were over. When John first mentioned the idea of publishing his writing, Sherlock was less-than enthusiastic.
Mycroft then looked John over, as if he had forgotten what he had wanted to say. When he finally met his eyes again, he gave the smallest – and saddest – of smiles, and spoke.
“I asked where I could find some; he was the one who insisted upon getting them for me. I didn’t even consider lubricant, though, but, given this newly-obtained information, that would explain why Mycroft
“It must be a Watson thing. Mom’s side – Dad doesn’t really aim, he sort of just fires,” Harry replied, tossing a sunny-side-up egg up to the ceiling. It landed perfectly, but only stuck for a moment before falling down into the plate of bacon. “I didn’t think that would actually stick,” she admitted.
“Just be yourself,” he replied, hoping that Sherlock knew that his words were not only a suggestion but also an apology, and Sherlock returned John’s sad smile to him, finally looking him in the eye. “Show him you’re nothing like him.”
“Ice cream!” Hamish cheered, and John led the way, turning around only once to wave goodbye to his husband.
“We can’t think like that, Harry,” Sherlock cut her off before he could think about it too much. “If we do, we’ll end up pushing the blame as far back as we can – as far as to the first rebellion. The first Games. ‘If there were no Hunger Games...’”
“Thank you, John,” she said, and John realized it was the first time that anyone had thanked him for answering their question.
His back was to him, at first, but the moment the door closed behind him, the man turned around to see his guest.
“I’m surprised by how talkative you are today,” he said casually. “When John returned from the Arena he barely spoke; for someone who hated talking in the first place I thought no one would get a word out of you until the final interview.”
But, before Sherlock could do anything about it, a very drunk Mrs. Hudson sat down beside him, tearfully going on about how much she loved Johnlock from the beginning, and Sherlock spent the rest of the night focusing on trying to coax John’s location out of her (she too refused to tell him) and then moving Mrs. Hudson’s glass just slightly out of her reach, until finally he asked her if it was now an acceptable time to leave, and she said yes.
So basically Constantly isn't gonna be ready until Summertime at the absolute latest. I'm like sorry x1000000 but that's the way it is.
The boy nodded again, yet slowly this time, as he mentally mapped out where he could find what Sherlock had asked for. But it was a nod all the same.
NOW. A few weeks from now, I'd like to do a Q&A thing of sorts because idk u guys might have questions. So pLEASE comment any questions for me or about the story down below - I'll answer EVERY SINGLE QUESTION the best I can without spoiling Constantly!
“I killed his brother shortly before my brother was killed and my boyfriend was assaulted by his brother – he could ask anything about any of those things and I’d have to answer,” Sherlock replied.
Two minutes later, Magnussen had his own penis in his mouth, his balls hanging out, and Sherlock and Harry finished the job, together, by plunging the sword into his mouth, too, and out the back of his skull.
Right, the speech. John glanced down at his index card again, knowing that his mind was too much of a mess to remember any of it.
He didn’t blame her, of course – he pushed her away, plain and simple. But it was better this way for them, he told himself. If Sherlock was disconnected from Harry there would be nothing connecting John to him – John would be completely free of him, finally. He would never have to think of Sherlock again. He could finally go off and get married and live happily ever after and –
“Hi,” Sherlock replied, then continued his train of thought. “If they end up catching us I’ll make sure they handcuff us together. That’ll get them talking, I’m sure –” John threw his head back in laughter, something Sherlock hadn’t seen him do in a long time.
“This somehow got past the censors...” Alexander said, finally unrolling the paper, revealing the front page’s article:
After Hannibal Lecter Magnussen’s arrest, the meeting finished quickly, and, with the paparazzi focused on Dean’s presidency and his reaction to the confession Hannibal had made, John, Sherlock, and Harry were able to leave the conference without much ceremony, though John made a point to wave at Dean before the three left the room.
Sherlock refused to leave John’s side that morning. John probably thought it was unnecessary, but Sherlock didn’t care. It seemed to help, anyway, being able to see Sherlock out of his peripheral at all times. And, of course, it kept Sherlock a bit calmer, as well. There was no painfully agonizing moments of waiting for John to get out of prep, wondering what was taking so long or what they were talking about (he still didn’t completely trust Octavia after the “fill in” mishap Sherlock still didn’t completely understand back at District Twelve). No one seemed too put off by the idea, either, which made Sherlock feel loads better about making the request in the first place. Cinna and Portia talked while all six members of both pep teams talked – there was just a lot of talking, but John seemed to be okay with that, today. Perhaps it distracted him from what he had to do.
“A lot of girls are very happy, I suppose. I mean, we just killed the man who terrorized them all for years.”
“Here in the meadow or in Twelve?” John asked, stupidly; he was sure he knew the answer before he could stop the words from coming out of his mouth.
“No, not about that. Snow sent you down there because of me. He was trying to keep us apart, so I wouldn’t be able to devise a plan to get the three of you – you, Sherlock, and Harry – out of this unscathed. Of course, Snow underestimates me. Time or no time, no matter what happens, I’m going to try.”
“Would you like to view his execution, Mr. Holmes?” the guard asked, for seemingly the second time, and Sherlock looked at the man to find him flipping the papers on top of the forms back over on his clipboard and placing the pen back in his pocket, even though Sherlock could not recall handing them back to him. “We can have it done and over with within the hour, if you’re willing to wait.”
“No – no. That was all him from the beginning – from the moment the Quarter Quell was announced, I think. I wanted to talk Sherlock out of it, actually, but there was nothing that I could say that he couldn’t find a response for – you know how he is. Sherlock was adamant that he would sacrifice himself for you when the time came, but when it came down to it he couldn’t.”
Sherlock was sent into motion as he dropped the sword and stood between Charles Augustus Magnussen and Harry, letting Harry crash into him and holding her back.
Mycroft sends John to stay with Dean and Alexander while Mycroft resumes his mentoring duties; John learns a little bit about life outside of District 12; John has an unexpected visitor.
Thank you. Whether you read one chapter or all of them, whether you’ve been there from the start or are reading this years later, you were still here with me, in one way or another, giving me that little boost whenever I felt like quitting this fic (and I did; there was a six month period where I didn’t touch Sentiment at all and I thought it was over) that I needed in order to continue. Without you, this fic would probably not be where it is today (and hey, maybe Advantage is a trainwreck compared to Sentiment, but most sequels are never better than the first installment, anyway). I can never thank you all enough for your kind comments and your kudos and even just for giving this fic a chance. You are all amazing.
“I hadn’t considered that,” Sherlock mumbled in reply, and Dean put his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder.
John stood quietly, leaning against the doorframe of his room’s bathroom, staring at Sherlock, who was sat on John’s bed. It had been hours since Dean left – once Sherlock had explained the situation with Hannibal, Dean quickly gone to count up the votes from the day’s hearings – and Harry had gone to bed; the two boys were alone in the world of John’s room, once again.
He was going to die tomorrow. Tomorrow, the world would continue on, and Sherlock would no longer be a part of it. He couldn’t imagine it, or he could, far too easily. “Are you afraid?” she asked, sensing his nervousness.
form of physical affection in the place of a verbal goodbye, but he knew that if he even put his hand over the line that the plan would instantly be ruined. “If – if this is the last time you see me – I just want to say –”
And John looked back at Sherlock and Harry, their hands still joined in the air, lit by the fire that was the exact same shade as the irises being thrown at them – the irises of their meadow – and hated the Capitol so much in that moment. They were taking everything from them – their lives, their happiest memories, their names, the light from their eyes...
“She was killed earlier this morning by Sarah Sawyer. Harriet’s still with the tracker jackers – she found a tree to sleep in without disturbing them, though; I don’t think she knows what sector’s she in, just yet.”
But Hannibal didn’t lie to him, anymore. And Sherlock didn’t ask. However, even though Hannibal didn’t – couldn’t – lie to Sherlock, it didn’t mean that Sherlock couldn’t lie to him.
Sherlock woke up the next morning incredibly uneasy – more uneasy than he should’ve been for the morning of the first day of group training. The morning was normal – or, as normal as it could be considering where they were. The four ate breakfast together and Sherlock and John went through their morning routines together, the whole time Sherlock trying to figure out why the hell he was so nervous.
“Sherlock!” Harry called, and Sherlock never felt so relieved to hear her voice. He could see her now, too – he could finally make out her form in the fog as he crossed the border between them –
“Not in your head, I don’t. Where am I in your head?” John asked, and finally he felt hot tears rolling down his cheeks. “I need to know. Please.” John could see the searchlights approaching, the circles of light touching the outskirts of the meadow – “I need you, Sherlock.”
Some gave names to their sorrows, some didn’t, but either way it didn’t matter – this was more about them saying goodbye to their loved ones than it was about talking to people they didn’t know about them. These eulogies were specifically for the deceased.
Sherlock runs into Harry, and has a few revelations; Dean calls for a meeting with all of the surviving Hunger Games victors.
As soon as he was able to stand up, he did, and he ran in the opposite direction of the man, keeping his eyes peeled for someone – anyone – who could help him.
“What would have happened if Sherlock woke up on the hovercraft?” John asked, and Mycroft’s face fell – the Ice Man had returned.
“Of course, yes. It was a pleasure to meet you –” he added, trying to remain polite like the Capitol had taught him to be, even though John had just practically beaten and threatened the man.
“Mischa died. More specifically, I killed her; I killed Mischa Simonetta Magnussen and I ate her remains. I know you’re all looking for more specifics as to how that happened, and I won’t be the one to deny you of your morbid curiosity.
His name was John Watson – he was nineteen years old – he was somewhere – anywhere but here – his mind could take him back to the Arena he didn’t care – it didn’t matter as long as he kept his eyes on that number on the wall – the most important number in the entire goddamn world –
Hannibal breathed in deeply again, and Sherlock felt the urge to cover himself – cover any scent he was giving off – but he couldn’t.
“That’s right,” she said, filling up a syringe. “I’m gonna just poke you with this really quick – give me your arm –”
Panem’s anthem played over the Arena, and the Capitol’s seal lit up the sky above the Arena, and Sherlock and Harry stood together and watched as Julia Waters, Steven Bainbridge, and Sarah Sawyer’s faces appear one by one alongside the stars, and then fade from the world forever.
Even though Mycroft, who had been by their sides through everything, was dead, it seemed like the rest of their friends had made it out of this battle alive. He glanced at Sherlock, and found his mouth pressed into a thin line, his eyes still shining with tears, and he squeezed his hand again, trying to convey the promise that they’ll get through it together.
And then, just as the Peacekeepers turned the corner – just as they were able to see them – Mycroft threw his silver egg to the ground, and grey and black smoke exploded from the small object as it broke onto the floor.
John looked over the edge, and found Harry and Sherlock, the only tributes donned in black in the lineup. The crowd went wild at the sight of them, cheering and shouting and throwing roses and irises (that were probably only sold because of Sherlock’s appearance) in their direction.
But it wasn’t just Johnlock – Harry was there, too. And again John was hit with the reminder that within a week, one or both of them would be gone.
“Answer yes or no: were you going to use this on John Watson?” he asked, showing the vials close to the man’s face. “Were you going to hijack John Watson?”
He took a deep, shaky breath. John was still alive, just across the hall. Harry was still alive, somewhere in the penthouse. He was still alive, right then, right there.
what they think?” Sherlock asked. “Harry and I – we’re alive – we’re out of the Arena – both of us – free as birds – mocking birds – Mocking
“I mean that there are no riots because right now everyone agrees that having the Hunger Games was wrong. Right now we’re entering a sweet period where everyone is going to agree wholeheartedly that something as horrible as the Games should never be repeated. But collective thinking like that is usually short-lived, and some people will change their minds,” Sherlock explained, speaking more than he had since Mycroft’s passing, looking out over the Capitol. “They’ll change their minds slowly and quietly and soon those same people will truly believe that maybe something like the Hunger Games was the right way to go about things, after all. Because, honestly, we’re stupid and we’re fickle human beings with poor memories and a talent for destroying ourselves while thinking we’ve got our best interests at heart and thinking ‘we can do it
John nodded as he looked away from Sherlock, a smirk playing at his face and a breath pushing itself out of his mouth in a poor excuse for a laugh.
“Of course I do. If I won I could tell everyone everything with no repercussions – he can't have that happen. He won’t let me win.”
Sex was never one of his interests – his body was a different thing entirely from the rest of him, especially in that aspect. He had always figured that if he was to ever be with someone, he would end up having sex with them at some point – that was the Thing To Do after all, wasn’t it? – but with John it was different. The Hunger Games haunted every part of John’s life, even that part. If sex was a thing they did in the first place, John would never be in the mood, to put it simply. There had been one time when they were kissing more passionately than usual, and their bodies reacted to the stimuli as bodies do, however. Sherlock had expected John to suggest they try it, and he, knowing it was the Thing People Did, was ready to agree, but John didn’t ask. He knew that John was a sexual person, though – he knew of some things John and a girl Sherlock forgot the name of had done the summer before last – so he only assumed the Games had done something to him on a mental level, making sex unattractive to him, now.
A part of Sherlock wanted to ask where they were, if not with John, now. He even opened his mouth to say it, but different words came out, instead.
Sorry it's been absolutely forever - I've been busy and tired af lately and then my computer decided the internet was going to quit on me for like 2 months but I'm here now so please enjoy
And then John heard what the crowd was cheering, their voices unified in shouts so loud that John’s ears began to hurt:
“I’ll handle whoever’s there,” he replied, glancing at the elevator’s position just as they passed the second floor. “With that said, when these doors open, I need you to stay back by the doors until I tell you that you can move otherwise. Is that understood?”
me to go?” Sherlock asked, and that question became the standard reply whenever John would ask him. Most of the time, John didn’t have to physically answer the question, just allow for Sherlock to kiss his forehead and whisper, “Ask me when you’re ready.”
But Sherlock hadn’t been just being dramatic like Mycroft thought he was being; he had been terrified.
After a few moments of moving upward, the ceiling opened up above Sherlock, and Sherlock let go of the dog tags as he rose out from the ground. The Cornucopia was in front of him, and all he could see were weapons – were there any food or supplies there at all? He didn’t want to make the journey over to find out.
John shook his head again. He had. He had made it home, directly over Sally Donovan’s body. And God did he hate himself for it.
“Magnussen’s still alive,” Harry muttered as soon as the Arena was plunged back into mostly-darkness, still watching the skies, as if looking for another message.
, John thought almost rationally. Was he okay? Fine was a word – fine was the word he would most likely use. He would say he was fine and move on to deal with it on his own, but –
The answer was obvious. So obvious, but neither of them wanted to see it, or even look in that direction. They knew what had to happen from the beginning, ever since the Quarter Quell’s twist was announced, even if neither of them said it out loud until months later. But here they were, down to the final two, and Sherlock’s gut
“Are you coming?” he asked quietly, and somehow the Stag was able to hear him – it gave a harsh breath through its nose and shook its head, as if he was shaking something off of his antlers.
As he thought of this, he held Archibald Neal’s hand – he had made sure the two seats on either side of him were open for the boy and Harry. As soon as a Peacekeeper came around to him with the giant needle that contained the tracking device, Archie had gripped onto his hand, and he hadn’t let go since. He had been talking and crying ever since lift-off, but Sherlock was only present for part of the conversation.
Two tributes – Janine Hawkins and Robert Frankland – were on either side of him. There was a small platform in front of Sherlock, just out of reach, that held a sword – Mycroft’s sword, or so it looked like. Everywhere – surrounding him on all sides – was water, rocking and swaying and licking the sides of Sherlock’s platform.
And Magnussen pulled his middle finger back with his thumb and released it, flicking it sharply against her exposed cheek. She flinched, instinctively, but made no other movement or sound to react to what was being done to her.
John remembered Abigail Reeves’ reaping – she, at seventy-nine years old, volunteered for one of the younger girls.
“Proceed,” the first one said, and Mycroft and John walked forward and began to make their way up the outdoor staircase to the mansion, the second Peacekeeper following closely behind them.
“Sherlock Holmes, where on earth is your brother?” Mrs. Hudson asked, pacing as much as she could in the tiny room underneath the stage.
“I blew it with Hannibal – I know it,” Sherlock muttered from beside John as they watched Harry take her seat upon the stage. “Yesterday I avoided touching you in front of him in fear that I’d mess things up and then I just...” The two boys both looked away as Harry was injected with the serum. “I couldn’t let him ask you that – you couldn’t let you
“Because if it was something good, he wouldn’t feel the need to wait until the meeting was over. He wanted us to sit in for the meeting, so whatever he has to say to us is not something we can just sit with; which means that whatever he has to say is nothing good.” he looked at his sister. “Does that make sense?”
“Or going in there so blinded by anger that I put myself in danger trying to settle a personal vendetta.”
By the time John had managed to open the door and close themselves on the other side of it, he was full-on making out with Sherlock Holmes and unbuttoning his shirt as he laid his boyfriend down on his bed, not even having the time or the thought to turn on the lights. John was going to have sex with Sherlock Holmes.
“As you keep reminding me. Seriously: what happened?” Sherlock asked, and John crossed his arms to match him.
“Sometimes it’s easier for the victors to speak to someone who was in their shoes not too long ago,” Mycroft explained to John. “Or, in my case, doesn’t have a victor from their own District to mentor them.”
Mycroft was not a man who was known for fits of rage, or acting impulsively. The last time he did he had cleared the desk in his office, just after learning that John had been assaulted by Charles Augustus Magnussen, and he couldn’t even remember the time before that. Injecting both of the vials of the tracker jacker venom into the man’s neck was not one of these times, however; he had planned it from the start, just not until he had completely served his purpose. Unfortunately for him, he had tested Mycroft’s patience, but that was fine; Mycroft could survive without his consciousness. He hadn’t needed him for much more, anyway.
the Hunger Games in play, they would be permanently incarcerated in a prison cell, with no hope of joining the rest of Panem.
He then turned back to Mycroft, smiling, and was met with a snowball in his face (courtesy of Mycroft).
“He’s going to have me killed instead. I tried to get back to you – I told him I needed time to make my decision, and then the next thing I knew I was here – in there,” he said, jabbing his thumb back at the cell he was in. “And my leg was gone.”
“The Capitol? No, no one,” he replied, and John only half-listened as he gave John the specifics of the first meeting, promising he’d “think about it,” even though he had already pretty much made a decision.
“I have!” he exclaimed, and John could see that one of his front teeth had recently fallen out. “He’s in there!”
“Let’s check on the other tribute from District Twelve, shall we?” Caesar asked, and the cameras cut to Harry Watson, holding one of her brother’s knives in her hand, slicing locks of her long, red hair. “It looks like Harry Watson’s changing up her look – someone should have told her that her stylist would have cut her hair if she had just asked, am I right?”
she didn’t mean it that way, but all he could hear was the unasked question within the words Harry said:
He thought of Sherlock, overdosed on his bedroom floor at the age of thirteen, eyes rolled back in his skull.
“You’re lucky,” John half-chuckled, and then glanced at his paperwork. “Do I have papers to fill out, too? Since I’m a mentor?”
Sherlock scrunched up his face again, gritting his teeth, tears falling from his eyes. Suddenly, he was crying, and Harry leaned into him, resting her head on his, just above his ear.
It was true – the Hunger Games was just a glorified battle to the death, and Mrs. Hudson, the woman who escorted two unlucky teenagers from District 12 to Panem’s Capitol, was just helping send those kids to their deaths. And this – the twenty-three deaths each year, the seventy-four years of Hunger Games – was all because of a rebellion against the Capitol that had occurred almost seventy-five years ago.
There was a post or two or five or ten on tumblr like a million years ago that started a headcanon that Catherine Tate would be the best actress for Harry Watson, if she were to make an appearance in Sherlock. Therefore, Harry's middle name is Catherine.
Sherlock was closing on the man – inching closer and closer, scooting himself across the limb of the tree as quickly as he could without drawing attention to himself. He could hear his heart hammering in his chest over the sound of the bees as he thought over his plan –
“Go – go –” he ordered, and each of them scrambled in; first Harry, then Sherlock, then John, and then Alexander, putting the mop buckets back in front of the door as he went and closing the door behind him. It was pitch-dark and it was cramped, but John couldn’t help but notice that there was just enough room for one more person – one more person, with a bit of a gut.
“It’s okay; I’m here,” he promised, and Sherlock squeezed John’s hand back, thankful, but not giving any other sign that he had heard him.
Sherlock glared at Mycroft, setting his jaw, but making no further comment as Mycroft immediately turned to the mayor and thanked him for the hospitality.
“Later,” he promised, and Sherlock hummed in agreement. “Go with Louise; we’ll catch up with you soon,” he said, and, reluctantly, Sherlock stood up and followed Louise out.
The day of the interviews was a disaster from start to finish, from the moment Mrs. Hudson had opened the envelope that came with breakfast that announced that the victor siblings would be interviewed alongside their tribute siblings, to the interviews themselves and after. As soon as the morning’s notice was read, everything was sent into a rushed speed that John hated – the prep teams had to almost pull them all from the breakfast table so there would be enough time for all of them to be prepped and ready – John’s old prep team working on Sherlock and Mary Morstan’s old prep team working on Mycroft, first.
This boy was three years old – he was tiny and probably the easiest target to these people, except for maybe the elderly tributes. He couldn’t let this boy spend the last few days of his life hiding and crying – he couldn’t just leave him.
“He told me that it held important documents – things that you would need. I don’t know what’s in that envelope.”
Mikhail Quidam was the most popular boy in their class, and John seemed to get along with him well, despite the fact that Mikhail had it out for Sherlock.
Welcome to Mycroft's Exposition chapter, part one! Chapter 70. This is too weird it needs to stop. My stomach aches for next week. This is so weird.
“How do you do it, then? Where do you keep all your information about everyone?” Sherlock asked angrily as Magnussen calmly wiped his glasses clean and put them back on.
He gasped involuntarily, as if his lungs had not allowed him to fully retain any of the air he had been breathing in the last twenty-four hours. He felt as if he was fully breathing for the first time that day, all because he was seeing his boyfriend and his sister – alive – in the Capitol.
They ran around the corner, Sherlock still screaming, but all Sherlock could hear was the sound of the gunshot still echoing in his head – the gunshot that would forever echo within his skull in his darkest moments – the one shot that had brought down the leader of the rebellion and his brother – Mycroft Holmes.
There was a moment of silence between them, Sherlock’s scrutinizing eyes taking John in, and then he spoke:
“Well, I’m going to be leading the whole thing, then there’s going to be you and the girls from my District, and I invited a few victors, since –”
“Where’s –” she began to ask, finally bringing her eyes to John’s, and he shook his head. Her eyes widened as she gasped, her hand flying to her mouth. “Oh my god –”
“And these people here, they played the Game, and they lost. This part of the Memorial helps us remember who they were.” He pointed at a name toward the bottom of the list –
The next morning, Sherlock woke up alone, and for a moment he felt what he imagined was merely a fraction of the fear John had felt when he discovered that Sherlock was missing from the house the night before. The instant he sat up, a wave of nausea and dizziness washed over him, and as soon as he stood up to rush to the bathroom, he found out that it was too late to even try. After cleaning the spot on the floor (thankful that he didn’t own a rug) and brushing his teeth, Sherlock finally made his way down the stairs, and found Harry sitting on the sofa, flipping through one of her textbooks.
“And you blinked first,” John agreed. “And because you blinked first, what happened to me never had to be mentioned. You didn’t like sex; that was reason enough to stop – we didn’t need to talk about any reason why
I deleted my snapchat because my computer's dying and I'm trying to make room for things I actually use.
“Thank you, I appreciate it,” John replied, but he knew – and he was sure they all knew as well – that the only person he wanted to talk about the assault with now was Sherlock Holmes.
“I was seventeen so she was...Julia was twenty-one,” he replied, his voice slightly unsteady as he spoke.
been blunt – he was basically blunt about everything that Sherlock could think of – his earliest memory was of his brother telling him that knowledge was the only important thing in this life – why hadn’t he been brutally honest about this?
Harry cut in front of Mycroft, causing him to stop. She put out her hand to him, like royalty might if they wanted someone to kiss their rings.
“Let’s go,” Alexander muttered, and, once John nodded, Alexander put his visor back down and guided John out of the room, down the hall, and to the wings of the stage, just as Mycroft had guided him out of the laboratory, down the hall, and into the tiny room they had wound up in. Once they were close enough to catch the slightest glimpse of what was happening on stage, John lifted his head and instantly craned his neck over and around the crew members, trying to see Sherlock and Harry.
John complied, expecting that Mycroft would just attach them to his belt, just in case a passing Peacekeeper noticed that they were missing and got suspicious. He was so attached to the idea that when he came back and Mycroft told him to turn around and put his hands behind his back, he panicked for a second.
He pointed at a house – more of a shack than a house, really, that had not been touched by any renovations – Sherlock’s house.
