Harry shook her head in disbelief. "You're crazier than I thought if you think any one alpha can be different than all the rest. Sooner or later, his instincts will kick in and then you won't have any power at your disposal to escape him. That's... just in his DNA," Harry said. Her eyes went out of focus somewhere between them, and Sherlock had the vague sense that she wasn't talking about John anymore. What had really happened with Carla... no, Clara?
John nodded thoughtfully. "Greg probably won't want you to speak to the omega alone because an improperly conducted interview could end up leading to a false confession. A good solicitor for the defence could use that to ensure that the confession gets thrown out because you don't work for the Yard in any official capacity – and that would put the entire investigation at risk."
John read the brief lines over and over. The buzzing in his head was getting louder and louder, overpowering the sounds seeping through the front door from Baker Street outside, and vibrating in his bones like the echo of a kettledrum.
"What?!" Victor said, stopping abruptly in his tracks, a combination of frustration and disbelief in his tone. He looked down at John, his lips pressed together, and glared at him. John would probably have gotten angry if he hadn't seen the glint of insecurity that flashed across Victor otherwise self-assured face.
"Sherlock finds you quite attractive but doesn't dare approach you. He has no experience and is shy on top of it. I think with a little encouragement..."
I took out my phone from my trouser pocket, entered the number for emergency services, and described what had happened, pretending to be frantic. After that I crouched down in front of Sherlock, brushed the damp curls off his forehead, and kissed him tenderly on his breath-taking lips.
"Oh. I'll bet this was his room, wasn't it?" The light-heared amusement in John's voice almost robbed Sherlock of his last shred of sanity. They were so close, yet worlds apart. If it weren't for the door, Sherlock would only have needed to reach out his hand to touch John, pull him close, hold him tight. Never let him go again. Never.
He relieved himself, cleaned his teeth, and turned on the shower to let the water get warm. But just as he stepped underneath the spray and his hair was pressed flat against his head, he heard John entering the bathroom.
The McKenzie case concerned a series of homicides. Five alphas had been attacked and killed while separated from their omegas; two of the omegas had gone into rapid decline shortly thereafter due to their broken bond, and eventually died. The alphas had been attacked inside their flats or houses. They had been drugged and had their hands and feet bound. Then their jugular and femoral arteries had been slit, and they had bled out.
Sherlock jerked out of a nightmare with a scream, flinching when pain immediately zinged through his body. The bandages and tubes had been removed by now, but the pain seemed to want to keep him company a while longer. Sherlock huffed and tried to orient himself in the dark room. The only illumination was a thin strip of blue lights along the upper edge of the skirting board in the otherwise pitch-black, windowless room.
The room felt abandoned, despite the fact that it was stuffed full of all kinds of things. The air smelled stale. He turned the light on and looked around. Dust swirled up. Cardboard boxes and suitcases stood in front of the wardrobe and the narrow chest of drawers. The box he was looking for sat on his old bed, whose mattress was covered with a sheet to protect it. John opened the flaps of the box and looked over what was inside.
Sherlock sank down on the edge of his bed, exhausted, and lifted one hand to touch the throbbing spot between his shoulder and neck. Pain flared and zinged in angry flashes through his body, radiating out to his arms and legs and making perspiration break out on his forehead and under his arms.
Instead, he went into the kitchen and tried to make tea with shaking hands. He swore when he turned the taps on too hard and the water hit a forgotten spoon in the sink which acted as a springboard to splatter John's t-shirt.
"I'm sure that's all in my file. Polybonding isn't some secret thing, merely unusual – for most people. I'm honestly not the one here who has something interesting to tell, William."
"Don't you dare lie to me, Sherlock. I have no idea what you were thinking to discuss my family business with your brother, of all people. But let me tell you one thing: trust, Sherlock, is a fundamental element of a partnership. And before you start worrying about my loyalty and how serious my intentions are regarding our relationship, maybe I should be wondering why I should trust you in the first place."
After Greg had said good-bye, John and Victor left the flat as well. They took the bus to Victoria station, where they would take the Southern Railway to Sussex. They didn't have any luggage, as they planned to return to London that same evening. With twenty minutes left before departure, they decided to go have a coffee.
"It's all right, doesn't matter." It was clear that John didn't buy the lie, but it was hard enough to remain calm and not blow his top. "Although I don't much feel like going to your parents' right now," he added.
It was ironic that an omega of all people had saved his sister's life, John thought to himself as he prepared for that day's visit to the hospital.
"Digital fingerprint. She was the last one who logged into the system and unlocked the door to Moriarty's cell," Mycroft explained, interlacing his long fingers on top of the desk. His aloof gaze tracked Sherlock across the room, once in a while briefly jumping to John.
Sherlock fought back, landing a punch and breaking Wiggins' nose. Blood spattered his fist and his shirt with red. Pumped full of adrenaline and fear, Sherlock grabbed the only two vials of Seven Wiggins had in his refrigerator with shaking hands and fled the scene before the dealer could collect himself enough to stop him.
"Was it the loneliness? You won't be sent on this mission if you're not stable enough to handle the loneliness you're sure to be confronted with, Mr Holmes. The risk would be too high. Not only for you, but for the outcome of the mission, naturally. None of this is going to end if you're not in proper condition."
John pulled Sherlock toward him as he leaned in to give him a hug and kiss him on the cheek. "I love you," he whispered.
"May I?" Sherlock purred, and simply pushed the baffled omega aside. He pulled open the drawer with a flourish and withdrew four small vials after a brief rummage. He crowed in triumph while the other omega cried out with anguish. John resisted the temptation to hold out a hand to provide the other man with some support as he clenched the wood of the dresser and glared daggers at Sherlock with tear-soaked eyes.
Sherlock hastily pulled in his legs when Tom leapt to his feet and stepped over him, fuming. Sherlock must have unconsciously filtered out the rest of the conversation. Victor got up too, albeit less energetically. The light turned on, and Sherlock squinted his eyes at the sudden brightness. He could hear the other two men's voices out in the hall. The hissed words were heated, but he couldn't make them out through the door.
"The knot," he remarked, his voice thick. He swallowed hard before continuing: "You've never used it before."
Nervously, Sherlock slipped the shirt off, his heart beating frantically. This was the first time he'd let anyone see his neck with the bite on it. He listened anxiously to Mike's every movement, every breath, every rustle of cloth. He flinched when the barely warmed diaphragm of the stethoscope came into contact with his back, shakily exhaling the breath he'd been holding in his lungs for far too long.
"I know... doesn't sound much like a coincidence, does it? But everyone always found him very considerate. He sat by my bed every night and told me stories. Some I never found in any book. He probably invented them himself. I still remember how he told me the story of the silent prince. Over and over. I knew it by heart. Even as a young child, the prince knew that people only said bad things about each other and decided never to speak again. Everyone around him praised him and was happy he never said anything stupid. So he kept up his silence and was quite happy with it. Along the lines of 'talk is cheap, silence is golden'."
Before he'd even caught his breath, Sherlock had washed his hands and was on his way out the door of the flat.
"Och," she sighed, resting her chin on her hand. "I spoke to Cilia and told her what happened. Or rather, I've been trying to for the past few days. Then last night, she was finally ready to listen without constantly bursting into tears or hurling insults at me. I have no idea if she's forgiven me yet. Sometimes I hate it so much being away from home and from her."
As if on command, a broad-shouldered man entered the room. His face was covered by a ski mask and his clothes were completely black, so that it was difficult to make out any identifying marks. He roughly shoved a delicate figure into the room, at whose sight Sherlock's despair flared up once more.
"Oh yeah, not much... right. I mean, you said that was your first kiss the other day. Well, sort-of-kiss at any rate. You can't really call that peck a kiss... or what do you think?" Victor asked. The corner of his mouth twitched with amusement. Was Victor intentionally repeating the word 'kiss' so often?
As a doctor and a soldier, John had seen many – too many – people die, yet nothing had prepared him for the panic he now felt constricting his airways. The frantic restlessness that had been making him vibrate with nervous energy a moment ago vanished into thin air. What remained was a paralysing fear that nailed him to the floor in front of Harry's sick room. He didn't want to face what waited for him behind the door: the fact that alcohol poisoning could end fatally, in the worst-case scenario, or at least leave permanent damage.
The alphas jabbered and offered congratulations, all talking over each other and clinking their glasses against John's.
"He wanted to help us. I gave my consent and wanted him to do what he'd offered to. But it's true that I got spooked halfway in. I would have gone through with it anyway because it was the only way I saw at the time to make my dream come true. The … episode that John had... it prevented all three of us from doing something really stupid. None of us could have known how Bill might react if John had actually... It took weeks before we could make love again after that without thinking about that night. But it wasn't John's fault. None of it was."
thing. Of course, she was well aware that it was none of her business, and that her only hope was that John would bring it up himself. That wasn't about to happen. Not today, not here. Probably not ever.
"What the hell are you talking about?!" Mycroft demanded, although it was obvious from looking at him that he knew the answer quite well. Before Sherlock could respond, he continued: "My separation from Anthea has nothing to do with my visit here today, and is – pardon my French – none of your bloody business. So please refrain from trying to tell me that my bond with her never should have existed, if you don't mind?"
John moaned when he felt Victor's hand on his cock, single-mindedly stimulating him until he was rock-hard. Frantic breaths struggled to escape John's lungs. An electrifying shiver ran through him, setting his nerve endings on fire, when Victor's thumb passed over his glans, spreading the fluid that dribbled out.
Both men held each other's gaze, knowing that Sherlock was apologising for much more than the most recent events, the mortal danger, the lies, and Sherlock's faked death. It was an apology for the years of ups and downs, for constantly pushing him away and taking him back, for too much and yet too little. For the irrevocable end of their relationship as it had once been.
"Yeah?" John said with a relieved snort, and dropped a kiss onto Sherlock's tense lips. "That eases my mind. Still, I want to learn to handle all of that and control myself better. But I know for certain that I would never do to you what Moran did to Anastasia. Never!" John spoke the last few words with vehemence, hoping that they would find a receptive audience with Sherlock.
Late that afternoon, the two of them picked Abigail up and drove together to the beverage distributor to buy alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks for the upcoming Christmas party. Abigail was extremely grateful that the two men were so willing to help her out. The party was going to be held a little ways outside of the city. It took a good half hour by car or train to get to the event location. Secluded enough not to cause the neighbours to summon the police for breaching the peace. And there was enough space for anyone to spend the night if they couldn't drive anymore or missed the last train, which solved a problem for almost everyone.
He had so many questions, but knew all too well that he wasn't the one who should be posing them. Not now, and not here at any rate. There would be time for all of that later. He took out his phone pressed one of the speed-dial buttons to connect with Lestrade. No sooner had he reeled off their location than the omega leapt to his feet and lashed out at Sherlock with the shard.
Could it be? Was it possible that he was experiencing not only what his own senses were telling him, but John's as well? Just as he had during the years they'd been apart? Except that those feelings back then hadn't been directed at him, but at....
Victor completed the thought in his head. "I could have put a stop to everything at any time," he asserted, more to himself, asking himself at the same time whether Sherlock were truly able to see past his facade.
"Is that right? I only hope those are planned and consensual pregnancies, and not attempts by certain alphas to tie their unwilling omegas to them more closely," Sherlock murmured, drawing his brows down grimly.
"We thought this whole thing would be easier, but it's not that simple after all. And now we need to make the best of it. I don't want to spend the rest of my life fighting with you."
"Yeah... that was before you two got together, sweetheart. And I thought before you drive off my next flatmate too, I might as well ask you directly." Abigail gave him a conspiratorial wink.
And it went on in that vein. Various details from Sherlock and John's relationship were revealed. Details that John had never told anyone about. In particular, things that could only have come from Sherlock's mouth. How long he'd been in love with John, how small he'd reckoned his chances to be of getting together with John, and how desperately he'd tried to find something to distract himself with. Mention was made not only of drugs, but also sexual congress with a series of anonymous men, not least the on-again/off-again relationship with Sherlock's old college pal, Victor Trevor.
He listened tensely for several breathless seconds, until John finally cleared his throat, went to the couch, and sat down. He didn't mention the file or Sherlock's strange advance again.
"We barely knew each other!" Sherlock cried. "How could I possibly have thought that that initial attraction could become…
Sherlock inhaled sharply as his head fell back, landing on Victor's shoulder. Victor gazed past Sherlock to watch as Ryan worked his way across Sherlock's chest and flat stomach with his lips and tongue. Victor wrapped his arms around Sherlock, stroking his neck, his collarbone, down his waist and hips, following the trail that Ryan blazed, wiping every kiss from Sherlock's skin. Held him when Ryan's mouth enclosed Sherlock's erection and made him moan.
Sherlock swallowed down the anger burning in his throat. He ground his teeth with frustration and glared at Moran through the mirrored glass.
The combination of happiness and grief threw him completely for a loop, especially after he had blocked his body from feeling anything at all for so long. And the profound sense of melancholy that John was broadcasting didn't improve the situation.
, Sherlock thought. His eyes wandered down the man's body of their own accord, following its edges and curves, the plays of light and shadow. Sweat gleamed dully on his skin. His shoulder-length blond hair was tousled, and a few strands were stuck to his forehead. He was fairly vibrating with energy.
Sherlock gasped in shock when John appeared on the laptop screen. He was only visible from his head to his shoulders, and was behind a glass partition. His face was distorted by anger and panic, there was perspiration on his forehead, and he was breathing hard. There was a red satin backdrop behind him with white roses in full bloom spread over it. It wasn't until that moment that Sherlock understood where John was.
Nigel kept a close eye on things. The sharp-eyed coach was in charge of the advanced group. He'd been practising kickboxing and taekwondo for years, had received numerous awards, and wasn't even thirty years old yet. His technique was excellent. Every punch, every kick was cleanly executed. Like in a training manual.
Sherlock twists around and leans closer against John for support, releases John's arm on his stomach and instead grabs his neck, pulling him deeper into the kiss.
When Sherlock scanned the short text, his eyes widened in disbelief. All of the colour drained from his face. Concerned, John leaned over to have a look at the screen.
. Victor seemed to be an exception. A person who had known John-and-Sherlock, and who now knew John-without-Sherlock. No, that wasn't right. Most of the people who John counted amongst his friends and acquaintances had known both versions, but Victor was the only one who had known Sherlock the way John had. That was one commonality John didn't share with anyone else.
"Guilty as charged," Victor replied with a shrug. He noticed Sherlock stopping a few metres away and digging in his bag as if looking for something. "I've heard a lot about you. But as I don't put much faith in other people's gossip, I wanted to see for myself whether you're really as hot as they all say."
"We haven't time for that!" Sherlock snapped. "It's of little consequence whether she's guilty or not. This letter clearly points to Sherrinford." He spread out the piece of paper he'd mentioned and smoothed it down by swiping his hand over it several times. "There must be a clue in it... There must be!"
John would have liked nothing more than to draw Sherlock into his arms and assure him that there was no reason to be afraid. But he knew that such behaviour was neither wanted nor would be tolerated. Even though it would do both of them good. It was possible to form a bond outside of a heat, but wasn't recommended according to the textbooks John had read. The hormones and endorphins released by both alpha and omega during a heat were just that useful. But that wasn't what Sherlock wanted, and John acquiesced to his wishes.
What did John think about when he pleasured himself? Sherlock didn't want to imagine John thinking about that beta he'd almost had sex with earlier. Or recalling any of the numerous sexual escapades he'd had; Sherlock had never felt anything like that for another human being, other than John.
Strangely enough, he scarcely felt the chill that crept into his bones, making his shoulder and fingers stiffen up. Instead, he was filled with a simmering unrest, which eased a bit as he kept in motion.
"I didn't know anything about that either. Although he did mention once that he'd had those nightmares ever since he was small. I can't say exactly when, but at least it seems reasonable to say there's some connection," Victor said, crossing his arms over his chest.
Victor's soap and shampoo weren't as exclusive as Sherlock's, but they were still in a higher price bracket than the products John usually used. Rolling his eyes, John washed himself quickly, trying not to imagine how often Sherlock must have stood in this very shower. Instead, he thought about what he was in for. It was a friendly turn – nothing more, nothing less.
"Excuse me," a nurse interrupted as she approached the table. She plucked the baby out of Sherlock's arms without so much as a by-your-leave. "Sherlock, you know you're not allowed to lift anything heavy. That fracture will never heal properly!" She returned Archie to Anthea with more force than anyone in the party approved of, and took her leave again.
He washed as much of the sticky residue away as he could without getting into the shower, all the while fighting the instinct to return to his alpha as fast as possible.
Sherlock nodded and propped himself up on one arm, examining Victor's face pensively. "And you?  How are you... after last night?"
John stared at his phone, dumbfounded, before putting it back into his pocket with trembling fingers. So that's what had made him so restless – practically like a wild animal – over the past few days. The alpha in him had instinctively sensed Sherlock's approaching heat. How had he overlooked that? And what did the omega want from him now? There was no way he could...
John sighed softly. His body was confused, trying to separate the pain from the pleasure and transport enough oxygen into his cells at the same time. Dazed and overheated, John let himself sink into the kiss, nipping at Victor's injured lip with his teeth and eliciting a tortured moan from him. They kissed again and again, desperately smashing their mouths together and grabbing fistfuls of each other's clothes and hair.
"What; freak? What would you call someone who opposes his own nature as much as you do? Who goes to any extreme in order not to have to function like every other human being on the planet? Hm?!" John crossed his arms defensively and swept his eyes from the top of Sherlock's head to his toes. "You try everything to be different and have your own snooty way rather than fitting into a role. What's so hard about being an omega then?"
He knew there was enough money there to allow him to live comfortably for the rest of his life, but Mycroft had found it prudent, in light of Sherlock's past experiences with drugs, to instruct the bank not to distribute more than a certain amount to him monthly: just enough to pay his bills and take care of his regular expenses. If he needed more than that, he had no choice but to ask Mycroft for it. Thus, it wasn't surprising that Mycroft wanted more specifics; after all, he was accustomed to Sherlock spending his "allowance" on Seven.
"Cilia, this is Sherlock. Sherlock, this is Cilia," he said a little stiffly, hoping it wasn't weird for either of the omegas that John and Cilia had once shared a physical intimacy.
Amalia gasped audibly and let out an incredulous snort. "Oh, no. No, no, that's when the nightmare began," she said softly. "We heard her screaming and crying but couldn't do anything. Augustus is... is... uncontrollable when he... He almost killed her." Her lips trembled and tears welled up in her eyes. She dashed them away angrily with the back of her hand.
"Right... okay. If you say so." John trotted along with Victor, not truly convinced by the suggestion. He knew Victor's flat was one street away, on Drummond Street, although he'd always avoided going past it on his way to the club. He'd been at Victor's once following their trip to Camden Market, but after that they'd only met up outside or at Baker Street.
"God, that's not how I meant it! Don't twist my words around," John griped and rested his elbows on his knees as he rubbed his face. "What I mean to say is I enjoy having sex with you. Whether during a heat or not. It's not a condition for me still wanting to have sex with you," John said firmly. When several seconds passed without a response from Sherlock, John turned to look at him, but Sherlock was still staring at the black expanse between them and the horizon.
He groaned as he pushed open the door to the flat and dropped their luggage. Sherlock followed close on his heels, pawing through the mail from the past few days. He was unable to suppress a smirk.
Victor basically didn't seem to care about the feelings of people who fell in love with him. And that was usually the beginning of the end. Abigail couldn't say whether Victor had ever opened his heart up to anyone, but she doubted it. She also doubted that the thing with Tom was going to end well. She'd wisely foregone giving any sage advice; sticking one's nose into someone else's relationship usually led more often to arguments than to gestures of gratitude.
"Well, you don't happen to have an affordable flat lying around somewhere, do you?" he asked with a crooked grin.
John exhales audibly and meshes his fingers behind his neck (Oh hell…). This stunning, pesky, clever, catastrophic version of a man is willing to start
None of it made any sense. Thousands of people must have read the article, but the mysterious letters weren't mentioned there at all. The only people who knew about them were John, Victor, Mycroft, and presumably his assistant. John didn't believe that Victor had anything to do with it. Not after everything that had happened between him and John.
John's chest clenched painfully, squeezing the air out of his lungs and rattling at the barrier behind which he had boarded up the tears he didn't want to – couldn't – cry. His body refused to give them up. To let them go. It was as if in doing so, he would be giving up the last bit of hope and facing the knowledge that Sherlock was dead. Although John was realistic enough to realise that that conclusion was the only logical one.
"I don't feel much in that spot," John confesses, stroking Sherlock's wild curls. Watery blue eyes look up at him and they are so full of unfiltered emotions that John has to swallow hard.
Sebastian's concoction was good; it was potent and long-lasting, although not as pure as Wiggins' blend. It was still worth the money, in Sherlock's opinion.
Once back in the flat, he took the whisky out of the bag which he'd bought on the way, unscrewed the lid, and drank directly from the bottle. The alcohol burned going down his throat, but it only took a few seconds for it to drive off the cold that had taken up residence in his stomach over the course of the day. Bottle in hand, John went over to the living room and sank down into his armchair, took out his phone, and set it down on the little side table without turning the sound back on. He kicked his shoes off, took another drink, and closed his eyes, unwilling to look at the world's ugly countenance any longer.
"We could have had so much fun together... But I guess we'll just have to make use of what little time we've got, right, sexy?" I said in a hushed voice and was just about to kiss him when rapid footsteps from the direction of the door made me look up.
John watched Victor and pursed his lips in thought. "If you always run away... is that the reason why you and Sherlock never... why it never worked out between you?"
John had leaned back and thrown one arm up over his head. His gaze fixed on Sherlock's lips, his mouth hung partway open and his respiratory rate was just a little faster than normal. He almost seemed to be shocked at Sherlock's brazenness.
By now, Victor had pulled Sherlock close, put his arms around him, and was kissing his way up his neck to his mouth, where he nibbled at the full lips with great pleasure. He registered Ryan dropping a few packets of condoms like sweets on the nightstand, then the dip of the mattress when he lay down behind Sherlock. Sherlock twisted his upper body so that he could face Ryan, running his trembling fingers across Ryan's chest and neck, pleading for a kiss.
"I understand," John murmured sympathetically. Bill's story reminded him of his own fate. In some ways it was diametrically opposed, but still characterised by social conventions and expectations.
"I'd be lying if I said that would be a bad thing: But it's not actually what I meant. No, I was talking about our... about
Victor stood on the landing beside her, holding a paper bag from a sandwich shop in the air. "Morning," he said and grinned when he saw Greg's perplexed look. "Hungry?"
"Yes, of course. I'm simply tired," he lied. He suppressed a yawn and stretched to lend credence to his statement. "It should be possible to get a search and seizure order now. Especially on suspicion of multiple homicides."
"About everything. That nature made you an omega, and that you're so unhappy about it. That society keeps knocking you down, and that no one sees what wonderful people you are, all of you. Not because of your gender, but for yourselves."
It had obviously been naïve of him to think that John would react with arousal to the dildo, especially since he'd already established in the past that the toy didn't represent a placeholder for him. The entire affair had only been settled once they'd made their feelings for one another clear. Since then, they'd even incorporated the dildo in their lovemaking a few times. And it was for that reason that Sherlock had never guessed that John would overstep his limits so far.
Sherlock nodded. "The pain knocked me off my feet. They had to sedate me to calm me down. But it must have been much worse for you."
Mycroft snapped his mouth shut and gave John a hard look. But his demeanour seemed to have more of a rueful cast to it than reproach at the interruption. He eventually nodded and averted his eyes, abashed.
John exhaled with a huff and curled his hands into fists. "So you're going to continue with your experiment until... what? Until you've completely destroyed your scent? Do you really think people will treat you differently if you smell like chemicals? If you just smell
"A little," Sherlock said, cautiously taking stock of himself. The all-consuming arousal had diminished noticeably, but he still didn't dare to move. "You're still hard..."
"Oh... oh, God... Sherlock... " John stared at Sherlock, devastated. His heart clenched painfully at the sight of the other man's desolate expression. He hugged Sherlock as hard as he could, virtually wrapping himself around him and rocking him back and forth as he trembled. "It's not your fault, you hear? Not your fault."
Back at the flat on Baker Street, Sherlock took off his jacket and hung it on the row of hooks next to the front door. He unbuttoned his cuffs, rolled up his sleeves, and ruffled the curls on the back of his head with both hands, as if he were trying to shake out the thoughts that had taken root in his brain.
"At any rate, Nick had nothing to do with anything else involving the business. He was just the intermediary between the customers and Tiger. Until the day Tiger told him to reel in a certain customer and bring him to him. Me. No one told him why, and..." Victor clicked his tongue scornfully. "… and based on the personal situation the two of them were involved in, he assumed I was intended to play a part in one of their...
Although he didn't specify his discovery any further, Sherlock immediately knew which book he meant. "Mrs Hudson brought it by."
"Love is a chemical process that takes place in the brain. Heats are simply part of my biology. I have no interest in sentiment. Rest assured, John: I don't want an alpha to share my life with. All I want is freedom and the right to self-determination." Sherlock frowned and gave John a searching look. "On the other hand, if you're worried that I might be some kind of hindrance or even a ball and chain – I won't be. Surely you realise we can take other lovers. You wouldn't be cheating on me. Feel free to do whatever you want, with whomever you want. Just ignore my existence. It's not as if I'll be around. Take a mistress and..." He made a throwaway gesture. "… have fun."
In the end, John conquered his surging arousal. It simply wouldn't have been right to indulge his lust that way. If he became intimate with Sherlock outside of a heat, then only when they were both awake and fully conscious of the moment. Not because their bodies were already aroused. And so, regretfully, he nudged Sherlock away as carefully as he could and slipped out of bed. He stretched and twisted the muscles which had become cramped from his unfavourable sleeping position, and fished for his trousers on the floor. He then quickly took his mobile phone out of the pocket to turn off the nerve-wracking alarm. It was a mystery how Sherlock could continue to doze despite the shrill noise, given that he was usually at odds with the mere idea of sleep.
"God, yes! I'd completely forgotten that. Do I want to know what other embarrassing facts you've discovered about me?"
To have Sherlock's full attention and to be used for his sexual explorations is a (wonderful, breath-taking) thing. But what would happen if Sherlock lost interest? What if he suddenly got bored with him? When his desire for the foreseeable future is satisfied, or when something else becomes the focus of his interest. John can't compete with
John can just barely avoid swallowing. He carefully puts the glass back on the table and wipes a few drops of wine from the corners of his mouth. "What do you mean?"
"He's... doing fine. Well, given the circumstances. He got lucky." Sherlock's voice became quieter with each word. His eyes were fixed firmly on John's arm, as if to escape the contemptuous judgment he so obviously expected.
I don't know anymore whether the poem mentioned was a haiku or a tanka, much less who wrote it – but if I ever find it again, I'll edit in the information. ^^
John's face was white as a sheet. His eyes darted nervously around Sherlock's face, trying to discern truth, lie, or reality.
"I heard the two of you arguing, John. And so I thought to myself, 'Before the poor boy goes off his food again—'"
omega, an adrenaline-spiked mixture of anger and arousal had washed over him. There had been hunger and longing as well. Longing for intercourse that sex outside of a heat couldn't hold a candle to, no matter how exciting and sensual it was. Now that the realisation had revealed itself like a literal Pandora's box, John didn't know how he was supposed to reassure Sherlock in future that he didn't place any value on precisely that natural union between alpha and omega.
"That'll be another one for you," Marcus said to Abigail, peeling himself out of the half-embrace so he could go to the door. He returned a few moments later, smiling in Victor's direction.
He covered the distance across the room and down the hall in just a few strides, ending up in front of Sherlock's bedroom door. He turned the knob, only to discover that the door was locked. He banged on the flimsy wood with his fist, making the door rattle in its hinges.
It was a strangely liberating feeling. If John hadn't been there, he would have avoided answering the door at all costs. After all, as an omega in heat, one could never know who was on the other side. At worst, it would be an unbonded alpha lurking in the neighbourhood who had picked up his scent and was just waiting for him to let his guard down. But John would never let that happen.
"...you can already practice using your senses with this clay at your age, Archie. And then maybe you won't end up such an unimaginative oaf as your father..."
Sherlock seized John's arm, which was pointing threateningly in Lestrade's direction, and tried to pull his alpha back. He cursed the sheer power emanating from the man and tried feverishly to think of a way to prevent him from tearing the Detective Inspector to pieces.
"Redbeard..." John whispered, letting his fingers brush the image with tenderness. Beside him, Victor smirked and gave John a gentle nudge with his elbow to let him know he wasn't alone. "How old was he here?" John asked Sherlock's parents, holding the album up so they could see.
The fact that John hasn’t touched himself once since his return, and that thanks to the constant fighting, not much has happened between him and Sarah during the holidays, it doesn’t help at all. Whenever John intends to pleasure himself, images of his completely naked and ecstatically moaning flatmate pop up in his mind and put him off his game entirely. He just cannot masturbate to the idea of having sex with Sherlock! (No way!) The little, innocent voice in his mind, which claims that fantasy is merely fantasy and one wouldn’t be punished for such trivialities, is ignored vehemently.
"Looks like he's not quite finished with you yet," Anthea said, turned Archie around and sat him on her knee so that he could 'communicate' with Sherlock again.
If it had been up to Sherlock, that would not have been nearly enough, but his hands were tied. He had no say in it; not that he ever had. After his house arrest was over – Mycroft had at least allowed that – they had broken off all contact with each other.
It was now nearly midnight, and John was just leaving the bathroom after showering and cleaning his teeth. He took a detour into the kitchen to say good-night to Sherlock, who was still sitting behind his microscope, conducting a series of inscrutable tests. John carefully placed one hand on Sherlock's shoulder, so as not to startle him.
Victor was hard as a rock by now and more than willing to release a little of the dark energy that was buzzing just under the surface of his skin. He set his legs shoulder-width apart, slowly undid his trousers with a smirk, and pushed them far enough down his hips to free his erect cock.
John huffed and pursed his lips, wiping his greasy fingers off on the paper serviette while he considered how to say what he was thinking without sounding like he was completely off his rocker.
John frowned thoughtfully as he dried Sherlock's other arm and found similar marks there. Although he couldn't see them properly in the semi-darkness of the bathroom, the silvery scars stood out clearly against the skin. When John traced a mark in the shape of a half-moon on his left arm, Sherlock inhaled sharply and jerked his arm back as if the touch had burnt him.
Sherlock listened to the conversation but didn't contribute anything. He understood all too well that John needed to let the facts sink in first and look for a way to help Harry and his parents. John and Sherlock didn't have enough saved up themselves to simply cover the debts and grant John's family a fresh start. Sherlock's wealth was limited to a monthly payment which Mycroft had set up after their parents' death. At any rate, it was clear to both of them that any financial assistance would pose nothing more than a short-term solution, and that they needed to get at the root of the problem.
A small mountain of suds made its way across the water as Sherlock lifted his hand and placed it on the edge of the tub. John caught sight of a rosy nipple before the foam covered it again. Visibly tense, Sherlock drummed his fingers against the porcelain, then started rubbing it, as if the smooth surface helped ground him.
Bloody footprints carved a path down the stairs from the first floor, then led diagonally across the entrance hall where they began to fade and ended completely in front of the half-open door to Lord Moran's study.
Victor looked past him and discovered Sherlock standing somewhat uncertainly in the doorway between the hall and the living room, looking around. When he spotted Abigail, he made a beeline for her and handed her a small package.
Victor held out a piece of paper the size of a business card. An address was printed on it, and three numbers were handwritten on the back. He placed it in Ryan's hand, brushing his fingers as he did, without breaking eye contact.
"I was just thinking what Mycroft would say if he found out what we've been doing in his old car. This is a collector's item," Sherlock said, grinning from ear to ear.
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Mycroft hold out the ominous documents in his direction. Sherlock kept his focus on the website in front of him, typing some nonsense or other into the comments box in order to appear occupied.
The eternal silence in the Diogenes Club weighed heavily on Sherlock's eardrums. His swift footsteps on the polished wood floor and his rapid breaths reverberated off the walls with an unnaturally loud echo. Beads of perspiration formed over his temples. His eyes flicked over everyone he saw, every object, looking for some clue. Concerned looks on wrinkled faces tracked his progress, only to disappear behind rustling newspapers as soon as Mycroft had caught up to Sherlock.
"Have you got a first aid kit?" John asked, indicating Victor's face when he gave John a questioning look.
The omega stood in the doorway of the Martins' flat, watching the new arrivals approach with a suspicious eye. He was approximately as tall as Sherlock, and of a similar build. His coffee-coloured skin stood in stark contrast to his piercing green eyes, and lent him an exotic air. Jean-Baptiste Martin was an extremely attractive omega, and yet something essential was missing – the characteristic omega scent was barely discernible. John could just make out a whiff of magnolia.
The concern in John's voice broke Sherlock's heart. A warm hand touched his cheek, wiping the tears away that welled up over his lashes.
Sherlock's stomach flipped as if he'd been caught doing something forbidden, and an anxious tingling fizzled through his body. He cleared his throat lightly but didn't know what to say. His freezing toes curled into the carpet, and his fingers trembled as they grasped the material of his pyjama bottoms. In the faint residual light of the room, he saw John rub his eyes, then turn onto his side and lift the covers. A wordless invitation.
John quickly lifted the cup to his lips and took a sip of the tea, even though it was much too hot, in order to suppress a laugh. These two were the polar opposite of their two sons. What in the world had got into Sherlock and Mycroft for them to turn out the way they had?
He took a good, hard look inside himself. Why was he so agitated? It wasn't as if finding the letters would make Sherlock rise from the dead. Still, this all seemed like some kind of sign from the beyond. A flicker of light in the utter darkness, even if it were nothing more than the reflection of the moon on the infinite mass of black water inside him. After months of mindless grief, he could feel the sense of oppression loosening. As if someone had turned a rusty gear two notches forward before it locked into place again.
John sat anxiously staring out the window of the 4-door Jeep he and Mary had transferred to after they'd landed. His head was bursting with all the information he'd received during the day. Like a puzzle with thousands of pieces where he could finally tell what the image was going to be, but which stubbornly refused to let him put all the pieces in their proper places.
"But what about monsieur here?" The man indicated John with a tilt of his head. "He's also an alpha."
Mary reached into her rucksack again and pulled out a manila folder, which she slid across the table. It contained several photographs and documents bearing Mycroft's signature. John saw right away that the pictures were of the fairy tale letters.
Sherlock stretched as far as he could whilst in John's lap, and scratched his stomach, which emitted an audible rumble. He looked up in surprise.
"Cilia, darling, don't you think it's about that time?" Bill said, placing a hand on her wife's lower arm.
Sherlock went to the stove, lifted the heavy pan and spatula, scooped some of the fried egg onto the plates which stood ready, and set the pan back down. A strange sense of foreboding coalesced in his abdomen, but he sat down opposite Bill anyway. Henry followed each of his moves with a watchful eye.
The woman snorted and curled her full lips into a sneer. "Sherlock doesn't live here anymore, doctor. He moved out shortly after the bonding. I suppose it shouldn't surprise me that you don't even know
"Hm?" Molly was just pouring the boiling water into two cups and dropping teabags in when she heard the strange tone in Sherlock's voice. She turned around and gave him a bewildered look.
Grey-blue eyes darted to John's. A moment later, Sherlock pressed his lips to John's, kissed him over and over again and whispered half-swallowed endearments against his skin.
On Friday, Sherlock gave John Moran's calling card. One phone call later and they'd set up an appointment for the next day with the astonished Lord. John hoped fervently that their house of lies was sturdy enough.
The fact that they'd gone on to have sex that night... well, they probably would have killed each other otherwise. But it wasn't like they'd suddenly developed feelings for each other, right? Months filled with stress and desperation had discharged in a huge clash – just like an inescapable thunderstorm. Were they now standing before the shards of their friendship, or would they be able to talk about it eventually like adults?
"The two of you had sex." Sherlock's voice was flat, didn't convey the usual arrogance with which he pronounced other people's thoughts before they had worked their way up to a confession.
, Sherlock thought as he wedged another piece of sweet pepper into his mouth which he'd fished out of John's bowl.
"No, I was bringing the laundry downstairs," Sherlock said and went back into the bedroom to put fresh linens on the bed.
"Just a little more, Sherlock. Push back. Yeah... that's grand. You're doing so well. Just a tiny bit more... Does it hurt?"
John carried Sherlock to the bed, blind with lust and caught up in their passionate embrace. Against all odds, he managed to situate them both on the bed without having to pull his cock out. He pushed Sherlock's arms up over his head and tangled their fingers together. With slow, steady thrusts, he pistoned in deep, kissing every inch of skin he could reach.
"Of course I understand. But I can promise you it's not your fault. You should know better than anyone that I don't want some simian for a partner, driven purely by instinct. Someone who just takes whatever he thinks he has a right to. No, John. It has nothing to do with your alphahood or you not arousing me enough. Because you do. You know I want you. Constantly."
"How is it during a heat?" she pressed after several metres of silence. Apparently Cilia wasn't about to let the topic rest. "Do the two of you at least enjoy your natures then?"
"Cilia doesn't want to continue without you. I don't know if that's such a good idea though. We're friends, and... I'm fairly fond of my balls..."
"You both thought I was dead... it's understandable that something like that would happen... I thought it might," Sherlock added without batting an eyelash. But John couldn't help noticing the tension in his shoulders and jaw.
Those were nothing but flimsy excuses! There was nothing natural about it at all! How could a good third of the world's population assume that behaviour like that was in any way normal? How could Moran still find approval, and possibly get away with it scot-free? And those comments came from a doctor. From someone who was responsible for the well-being of his fellow humans; someone who was in a position to calculate the damage better than anyone else. What did that say about how the lawyers would react, who didn't have half as much interest in the victim's welfare?
John was still holding Cilia open with one hand, and watched now in fascination as Bill stuck her fingers into her own mouth to wet them, then began stimulating her omega with practised motions. She rubbed circles over her clit with her first two fingers, continuing to play with Cilia's breasts with the other hand. It was a highly erotic sight, and reminded John of a wild night when two female beta soldiers had accompanied him to his quarters, and a similar scene had gone down. There was a reason for his nickname, after all.
. He increased the pressure of his touches on Sherlock's neck, hoping to calm him. In an effort to lighten the mood, he tried humour.
Others lost their partner due to accident or illness. Depending on how strong the bond between the partners had been, the surviving partner might also die within a short period of time.
He lay on his side, his legs drawn up and his arms wrapped loosely around himself. A blanket lay over him. It smelt unpleasantly of cigarette smoke. Even worse was the stale taste in his mouth.
The letters blurred before John's eyes. He growled and closed them, pinched the bridge of his nose, and swallowed against his parched throat. A horrible pain appeared behind his temples, seeming to increase with every throb.
John gently stroked Sherlock's cheek, brushing a couple of unruly locks of hair out of his beloved face. "But the fact that I have you back... that's the most important thing. I want you... only you..." he added in a choked voice.
Standing almost motionless and eating in the midst of a bustling mass of people was almost like being in a slower-moving parallel universe surrounded by a cocoon of colourful sounds. The clicking of heels on the smooth tile floor, the constant announcements that could only be understood with the utmost concentration, snatches of words in several languages.
"Are you okay?" John whispered, concerned. Tears prickled under his eyelids, and he felt one steal its way out of the corner of one eye and roll down his cheek.
He forbade himself to waste any more brainpower on the horrible injustice of his existence and hurried to the door, only to find that John was no longer in the bed. Overcome by a sudden panic, Sherlock whirled around and went into the kitchen. But John wasn't there either. The glass door leading into the living room was pulled almost all the way shut, leaving just a small crack, but his nose would have told him even if it had been closed all the way that his alpha was on the other side.
John frowned, bewildered, but did as he was told. Mycroft probably wanted to prevent John from contacting anyone on the outside, even if the only person who came to mind was Victor; he would have quite liked to tell him about Sherlock's return. But of course John wouldn't actually have done it.
Sergeant Donovan directed the light from her torch behind one of the towers of boxes. Her lips were pressed together into a thin line and perspiration beaded on her forehead. The young beta had proven herself amongst the Yard's alphas, but she was often lacking the sangfroid which would have been so important for attaining a higher position. Still, Lestrade had no doubt that she had a successful career ahead of her.
"Why did John attack him? Despite the similarity, he must have realised it couldn't possible be Moriarty." Sherlock watched his brother closely. The fact that he'd only brought photos that didn't show John directly was already quite revealing. Something was fishy about the whole thing
When Sherlock and John entered his office, he was just finishing off a cardboard cup of cold coffee. He waved them in with his free hand. "Thanks for coming in," he said, tossing the cup into the bin next to his desk.
Sherlock's delicious scent flooded John's body down to the last cell, making him moan with pleasure. He automatically licked the silver ridge of the scar and brushed a kiss over it, then watched approvingly as goosebumps formed on the back of Sherlock's neck, making the fine hairs stand on end when he scraped his teeth over the skin there.
They spent the ride to Baker Street in silence. Their hands lay on the seat between them, clasped firmly together. They occasionally exchanged a glance or a wistful smile, but neither of them managed to shake off the strange afternoon entirely.
Sherlock sighed crossly. "I don't know what the problem is, all right? If I knew, I'd have done something about it a long time ago. But it's just as much a mystery to me as it is to you."
It was a glass coffin standing at a seventy-degree angle in a darkened room. The seams were edged in brass and shimmered golden in the light of the dozens of candles placed around the floor. A locking mechanism with a keyhole was mounted on one side. Sherlock grasped the brass key in his trouser pocket so tight that it hurt.
John shook his head with a smirk. "And how's that supposed to work, genius? I was able to set aside a little money when I was in the army, but it's nowhere near enough for an investment like that."
Tom turned his head a little so he could return the kiss and reach into Victor's long hair. Soon, the rustling of cloth and the smacking of wet lips were the only sounds in the room, drowning out even the pounding of their hearts. Victor yanked impatiently at the sleeping bag to pull it back, slid his hand in underneath Tom's t-shirt, and cuddled up close to his now-bare body to deepen their kiss.
Sarah extricated one hand from his grip, laid it against John's cheek, and gave him a sad look. "I hope he'll realise what he has in you one day."
!" Moran hissed, forcing a loud, smacking kiss onto Sebastian's cheek. The omega's scent immediately shifted. A combination of fear and anger flooded Sherlock's nose, making him shudder inadvertently. Sebastian was definitely
John chuckled softly and wrapped his arms around Sherlock's neck, making sure not to dislodge the cannula in the back of his hand, and pulled him in as close as he could.
"What, that old thing?" she asked without batting an eyelash. "We've had that forever. It was for the kids, but Sherlock was the only one who was read to regularly from it. He could spend hours with it."
Apparently overwhelmed by a massive wave of lust, Sherlock squirms beside him, and then slowly raises his head, looking almost beseechingly at John from under long lashes.
Mrs Hudson's visits to his flat had become considerably less frequent since John moved in, however. She was probably worried that the alpha didn't tolerate her presence: he'd snarled at her more than once in the past few months. To be sure, Sherlock was generally the cause of such outbursts, but it wasn't clear whether Mrs Hudson was aware of that.
John's insides cramped painfully, squeezing into a hard knot. He felt a renewed burning behind his eyelids; his breath caught. He forcefully exhaled the air from his lungs and got up. He staggered a little as he went into the kitchen and opened one of the cupboards to take out another bottle of whiskey. As he unscrewed the lid, the seal broke in his grip, cutting into the skin of his palm. A glance into the living room confirmed that he'd left his glass there. Rather than fetching it or taking out a new one, he brought the bottle back into the living room and collapsed onto the couch with it.
"God, Cilia. You're even more beautiful than last time! And pregnant again. Why didn't anyone tell me?" John laughed and drew the omega close again. "I'm so happy to see you."
After the incident in Camden, Sherlock was never called in for cases that had anything to do with drugs. Nonetheless, Sherlock kept his eyes and ears open, and took note of any names that were dropped in communications between the drug and homicide squads. Most of them were dealers who had already been tracked down and sentenced, or were about to be arrested.
John’s neck, back and joints feel like they have been put through a meat grinder and replaced with rubber. Eyes and throat are sore from the dry airplane air, and the pressure on his ears has not yet subsided. Thanks to a whimpering toddler in the row right behind him, John wasn’t able to sleep a wink the whole flight. Wretched and deeply exhausted, he picks a few pounds from his wallet and hands them to the driver, thanks him and pulls out the handle of the suitcase to pull it over the pavement.
Mycroft's voice reached him as if through a thick layer of cotton wool. "We have him in custody, John. I've just checked. He's still in his cell and under constant surveillance."
As expected, Lestrade inhaled sharply with a combination of indignation and resignation. "It's true then? It wasn't an accident?"
"Good night," Sherlock said – for what might have been the first time since John had lived on Baker Street – and purposely avoided eye contact with the alpha as he continued to hover.
Aside from that, even if in his naivety he'd once envisioned himself in a healthy partnership with Sherlock, these days he wanted nothing more than to wring the vain omega's neck. He didn't even want Sherlock anymore. And he wanted even less to latch on like a parasite in Sherlock's flat. He needed another alternative in the long term.
Deep, rapid breaths; impatient and imploring. His hands buried in Victor's hair and grasping his back, Tom forgot everything around him and whimpered softly when Victor's teeth sank into the sensitive spot beneath his ear.
Sherlock's pupils are dilated, lips already reddened. His high cheekbones have also turned a darker shade. With a slight turn of his head, he pushes into the hands in his hair.
What kind of response was that? Muttering to himself, John stuffed his phone back into his pocket and looked out the window. There were still a few more stops to go. It was dark by now, and the street lights had come on.
"Ready if you are," Sherlock replied. He grabbed the handle of his roller suitcase and gave John a look as if to say, 'get on with it then.'
Tom had obviously got ready in a hurry. He stepped out of the bathroom, trying to get his ginger hair in some semblance of order as he tugged on his jacket and finally slipped on his shoes.
The kettle turned off with a click, and Sherlock filled John's cup. Meanwhile, Lorraine slid the pancake onto his now empty plate and put it into the oven to keep it warm. She dropped a pat of butter into the pan, where it melted with a hiss. She then took another plate out of the cupboard and set it down next to the stove before stepping aside so that Sherlock could take over.
Three weeks had passed since the funeral. He'd found his way back into his old life. He'd resumed his position at St Bartholomew's Hospital – starting the day after the memorial service. He'd had to, otherwise he would have been climbing the walls. When he didn't have anything to do, his mind kept leaping to his dead friend, torturing him with images of their time together. He'd been offered a half-day position in order not to place too heavy a load on him. But John hadn't wanted any part in that. Just the opposite: he spent as much time as possible at the surgery, going through files and helping his colleagues when they were overwhelmed with the influx of patients.
John didn't need Bill's needling to recall his bond; he was well aware of it himself. Whether he wanted it or not, whether he forbade himself from thinking about it or hoping for something to happen, part of Sherlock always seemed to be with him, like a non-corporeal entity. Invisible yet always there. A figment buried somewhere in his subconscious.
Shallow, frantic breaths burned on Victor's neck when Sherlock collapsed against him a moment later, exhausted. He reached into Sherlock's short hair, turned his head towards him, and held his fingers up in front of Sherlock's bright red face, painted with his orgasm. Sherlock's uncertainty was clear from his expression. Victor brought his hand to his own mouth and licked his thumb and index finger before drawing Sherlock in for another kiss, shoving his tongue into Sherlock's mouth. Sherlock made a surprised sound but let it happen as he tasted himself.
He still hadn't found any concrete solutions – there wasn't enough evidence for that – but at least he'd managed to gain extensive insights into how the various homicides must have taken place, depending on whether the killer was an alpha or an omega.
Not with Sherlock. He'd persisted in trying to fit more and more of John's erection in, licking and sucking with abandon, all the while making the most delectable sounds. The whole operation had seemed to arouse the omega as much as John. When Sherlock had finally clambered onto him, he'd been so wonderfully wet and uninhibited that John had almost come right there on the spot.
Heat and alcohol, rhythm and a sea of lights. It was a wonderful feeling. Letting go and following the rush of blood. Abigail flung her arms around Victor's neck and drew him close in a clumsy embrace.
"Okay..." John said as he walked toward Victor. "I just need a shirt or something. You'll have to help me out." He couldn't help noticing the pointed look taking in his naked upper body before Victor silently pointed toward a square of fabric lying on the arm of the couch. John decided to ignore the look. It was probably unavoidable that they more or less deliberately measured themselves up against each other; after all, Sherlock had found both of them attractive.
"You don't understand. Not yet. A bond between an alpha and an omega is more than just a little scar on your neck. It's a lifelong – "
had been shut down. In any event, John couldn't imagine returning there at this point after everything that had happened in connection with the gym. The affair with Greg had begun there, which had drawn the attention of that bastard Philip and landed John in hospital and in court. Then there was Bridget. His friend who had fallen into Moran's clutches, dealt drugs for him, and ended up paying with her life. One of the countless victims on Moriarty's conscience.
While John added the dinner ingredients to the pan one after another, he mentally steeled himself to ask the big question that had been plaguing him ever since his meeting with Mycroft.
The last climax of that heat left John riding a massive high. He had pounded into his omega with wild, exuberant fervour while Sherlock cheered him on with ecstatic noises calling for
Sherlock cautiously lifted his head to meet John's gaze, only to glance off to the side again, ashamed. "It was a trick that Mycroft's omega told me about. I was supposed to take something that smelled like you to bed with me so that I … "
"Is it?" Mrs Hudson said, placing one dubious finger against her lips. "Of course, as a beta I'm not in a position to make judgments, but on the whole a bond works very much like a marriage. Two people who love and respect one another... it's all very sweet!"
John felt like he was fifteen again. The only difference was that his breathtaking omega was spoiling him with his talented mouth, frantically chasing his own climax at the same time, rather than one of his crushes practising their awkward first attempts on him.
Sherlock's low keen brought John back to the here and now. Maybe John's loose grip around his balls or his thumbnail scraping Sherlock's rosy nipple was the cause. Or maybe it was the gentle nibbling at the back of his neck and the flick of John's tongue across his silvery scar. Maybe John's dark, rumbling growl – or simply the combination of all of the above.
John felt a strange emotion latching into place in his heart. A sense of togetherness the likes of which he hadn't felt in a long time.
Victor had every right to voice his anger. But even if he did forgive Sherlock at some point, Sherlock would have to live with the guilt. At least until it sank in that Moriarty's plan hadn't worked and all of Sherlock's friends were alive.
After concluding several transactions with Sebastian within the space of three weeks, Sherlock received a message from him as usual with an address for pickup, sent from a burner number. This time, however, there was another line of text underneath that had Sherlock doing a double take.
Mrs Hudson wasn't put off by Sherlock's attitude. She simply pressed the book more firmly to her chest and smiled cheerfully as she said, "I used to love cooking for my husband, back in the day. Of course, I knew all of his favourite dishes and enjoyed watching him eat with such gusto."
Sherlock wiped the sleep out of his eyes, got out of bed, and went into the loo to have a shower and clean his teeth. After he'd got dressed, he went down the stairs to the main level of the house. He could already hear Henry's excited voice from afar, accompanied by the enthusiastic pitter-patter of a small child's footsteps echoing through the house. The aromas of bacon, eggs, and toast hovered in the air, but when he stepped into the kitchen, it wasn't Cilia he saw by the stove, but Bill.
"Yes... I'm so sorry. Don't worry about your things – everything's been packed up and put into storage. As soon as you're out of here, we'll help you find another place. Or... would you stay at ours?" The hope in the omega's voice was unmistakable, but the offer sent an ice-cold shiver down Sherlock's back. He shook his head and shrugged awkwardly.
He fancied he heard John swearing; felt him thrust deep inside him one final time and spurted, his whole body shaking. John's forehead rested on his chest as he tried to transport enough air into his lungs and not burden Sherlock with his entire body weight at the same time.
Sherlock immediately froze up and made a choking sound, which prompted Ryan to press further forward into Sherlock's throat. Victor swore and pushed against Ryan's chest, shoving him firmly aside so that he could move Sherlock up and shield him better with his body. Sherlock seemed to quickly forget the incident when Victor inadvertently hit a sensitive spot inside him, making him groan loudly.
John raised one eyebrow sceptically when he caught Victor's eye, but Victor's only reaction was a brief twitch of the corner of his mouth. Apparently everything was fine. And anyway, Victor was more than capable of taking care of himself, John thought to himself, and reached out one hand toward his friend to take his beer. Victor understood after a moment's pause and handed the bottle to John before returning his full focus to his dance partner.
He wasn't particularly hungry, nor did he feel like having tea. He would have preferred a beer or a whisky, but he'd just been drinking the night before. Maybe a warm bath would be relaxing.
"It's such a nice day, this weather should be enjoyed, don't you think?" John said. They'd skirted the shore of the Boating Lake for a short distance before stopping to look out across the water and watch the swans and geese floating on its surface.
His throat constricted with fear, but there was nothing he could do to stop it. No matter how hard he fought against it, he had long since lost control over himself. His body was dead set on satisfying its hyped up sex drive, no matter the cost. The erotic moans and sighs coming from him and John in an unbroken stream burned against his eardrums. His eyes filled with tears when the pain finally overtook the pleasure.
"I simply asked about the situation with my trust. It's no secret that Harry drinks, and your parents' debts—"
John was surprised but returned the embrace with one arm, giving Sherlock an inquisitive look when he pulled away. He licked his lips and gave Sherlock a once-over from head to toe. "You'll... call me if you need anything, yeah?"
It was Friday. John had just returned from his shift at the surgery, and was piling the take-away he'd brought home with him for lunch onto two plates, clearly intending to share it with Sherlock. Sherlock had already memorised the address Lestrade had sent him, and was about to put on his shoes.
"You're surprised he told me, aren't you?" John said, and Sherlock nodded, uncertain how to put his misgivings into words. "I was too at first. But he said you weren't ready for that conversation yet; not that I agree. I know you haven't always … erm… approved of the fact that your brother has … feelings for other alphas. But… he put his entire life on hold, bowed to convention, and concealed his true nature in order to maintain appearances. The two of you are very similar in that way, even if you're also completely different."
"Let's get out of here," Victor said, grabbing Sherlock's wrist to pull him along, summarily declaring his working day over.
John grunted an affirmative. He also felt deeply sorry for the omega, for a variety of reasons. "I was shocked that his alpha more or less bought him. I thought human trafficking was illegal," he growled.
He tossed and turned from one side to the other, recalling to his mind the formula for the pheromone blocker he'd been tearing his hair out over for so long. He hadn't made any solid progress on the compound since meeting John. It worked fairly well at a distance and was relatively reliable for suppressing omega pheromones – at least for two or three hours. After that, though, the personal scent seemed to be intensified for the same amount of time before reverting to normal. It could therefore hardly be called a blocker. It was more like a temporary damper – which simply sounded pathetic.
His enthusiasm was dampened slightly when he first set foot in his new digs on Baker Street. The flat was let by an elderly woman who lived on the ground floor and quite obviously had been instructed to keep an eye on Sherlock so that he didn't revert to his old habits and procure any Seven.
Sherlock swallowed once, then again, before straightening the collar of his coat and nodding, as if assuring himself that everything was in order.
The omega let out a loud gasp and seemed to be approaching her climax when Bill took her fingers away, interrupting her ministrations, and instead grabbed the backs of Cilia's knees with both hands. She lifted her legs and splayed them further, holding them in place with an adamantine grip to prevent Cilia from twisting away.
Hip and hand are working in tandem now. John feels how his climax is approaching. It builds up warmly in his groin and announcing flashes jolt through his limbs. Only with great difficulty does he manage to ride the crest and wait for Sherlock to give him a signal. In anticipation of the final act, he grits his teeth and shuts his eyes.
He swallowed hard. What was going on? No sooner had the darkness enveloped him than the images came alive which he'd succeeded in burying in a distant corner during the day. Images that had burned themselves into each of his cells; that were doing the strangest things to him. Images that had no right to cause such turmoil inside him.
"Yes, it's true. Sherlock didn't say a single word until the summer of his fifth birthday. We were very worried that it might have had something to do with my age during the pregnancy. I was already over forty, so there was an increased risk, as I'm sure you're aware, Dr Watson. However, the doctors couldn't find anything to confirm that. His vocal cords had developed normally, and he reacted perfectly well to sounds, so they were able to eliminate a disability. They ran a whole gamut of psychological tests, but he also achieved excellent results there with the exception of the fact that he didn't say a single word.
"At first?" John teased. "I got the distinct impression you didn't want to have anything to do with me after we'd bonded."
Sherlock lifted one eyebrow and twisted his mouth into a sarcastic smile. "You've already said that, and I still concur. At least that's one thing we agree on!"
"John, please," John hurried to correct him. The last thing he wanted was to be addressed with an antiquated honorific, when the omega didn't seem to have any problem speaking to Sherlock as an equal.
Sherlock squeezed his hands into fists and pressed them into his thighs. He couldn't believe that he was being denied even this one brief moment of happiness.
"What do you mean?" John asked as he suckled on the skin at Sherlock's nape, nibbling it lightly. "Because it was the first time you had sex during a heat with me?"
Several threads addressed the lovelorn. Betas complained that the alpha or omega they had their heart set on had ended up choosing another partner, leaving the betas in the lurch. As was to be expected, there was an outpouring of negative commentary against the gender which had interfered in the would-be relationship.
John wondered – and not for the first time – what he'd done wrong to make life so unfair to him. After being born the only alpha in an underprivileged family, he'd done everything he could to pay for medical school and realise his dream of becoming a soldier. And for what? Not for money or prestige. No, the only thing John had ever wanted was to help people. Now he couldn't even do that anymore.
"Oh, Sherlock. I'm so sorry. I seem to be putting one foot in my mouth after the other. And I wanted this to be such a nice visit for us."
He was empty, starving, and at the end of his reserves. Yet at the same time full, absolutely brimming with emotions that were directed at another person altogether. Ebb and flow.
Sherlock nodded curtly, still holding the blue cloth in his hands. When John realised that, he took the dressing gown back and draped it over Sherlock's shoulders, smoothed down the lapels, and tied the ends of the belt together with a loose knot. He wrapped his fist around the loop, pulled Sherlock closer, and kissed him with a matter-of-factness that sent hot shivers skittering down Sherlock's spine. Then he stepped back.
Their bare bodies gleamed with moisture in the light from the setting sun which fell through the window into their bedroom. Sweaty strands of hair stuck to John's forehead, and smouldering heat coated his cheeks and chest with a red cast.
John had started with surprise for a fraction of a second but promptly regained control over himself and pressed his face further into the crease of Sherlock's buttocks, intensifying his sucks and licks with a guttural growl. He insinuated his left arm underneath Sherlock's torso as well so he could lift his hips a little more, which had the additional effect of spreading Sherlock's arse cheeks a little further apart and widening his hole.
"Bloody hell, nothing's fine. I'm your alpha! You're my omega. I've been trying to make it clear to you for weeks that I'm not like that, and then I turn around and hit you next chance I get?! Shit!"
Sherlock sighed again and stood to approach John. This time maintaining a safe distance of at least a metre and a half between them.
Sherlock's restrained whimpering and twitching almost jumbles John's mind. He literally feels the orgasm building up in Sherlock, multiplying the electrical impulses in his nerve pathways and making him tremble. His breathing turns short, erratic and is interrupted more and more by his lustful sighs.
So that's how it is, when you have sex with Sherlock Holmes... As strange and exciting as the man himself. And yet, the fact that they weren’t even in the same room leaves a sour aftertaste.
"William," Sherlock said promptly. He didn't think it appropriate to give a suspected murderer his name, but he wanted to avoid being caught in a direct lie. Strictly speaking, William was the first of his three given names, even if it wasn't the one he usually went by.
Resignation passed over her face when she downgraded the likelihood of getting Sherlock outside to impossible. She leapt to her feet and strode resolutely toward the door, presumably to fetch help.
"'s alright," John replies, putting Sherlock's hand back against his head. He shifts his weight a bit more to his thighs so he doesn't have to rest on his forearm, then fumbles with his sweatpants, tugging at them impatiently to free his own erection. But he needs both hands to pull enough of it out to remain over the waistband of his underwear. Taking advantage of the brief respite, John spits in his hand and rubs the extra moisture over his shaft. John makes a guttural sigh against Sherlock's skin, then puts his lips over the swollen glans again to specifically stimulates it. The added arousal that shoots through his own body spurs John to work his lips and tongue faster over Sherlock's penis.
John’s eyes widen a fraction. Then he swallows against the lump looked in his throat, raises his chin and meets Sherlock's piercing stare. Fervour and excitement linger there, and his lips part slightly as if he’s struggling to breathe. John’s heart skips a beat before hammering at double speed against his ribs. He nervously licks his lips, scrutinising the other people present. But no one seems to take note of the situation. (You incredible madman...)
"Oh? Is that what they're saying? I'm flattered," he replied evasively and put his papers into a leather briefcase.
Oh, so this was news to John? Had he not noticed Cilia's discomfort at the time? Had he been so intent on finally having an omega after all those betas?
"Can I?" John asks, but doesn’t wait for a reply. He carefully removes the vibrator and drops it to the floor between Sherlock’s knees. Sherlock only hisses and whimpers faintly, then relaxes noticeably in Johns embrace. Close and clinging to John’s chest, his breathing and heartbeat slowly calm down.
Night had fallen by now. Street lamps and a couple of windows here and there in the vicinity were the only sources of light in the hazy darkness. Snow crunched under the tyres of the car as Mary turned onto a country lane. John had no idea which Swiss city harboured the tiny private airport where they'd landed. He probably wasn't supposed to know.
"I'm afraid that won't be possible," she said, shaking her head as if in slow motion. "We cleared out his things years ago. It's nothing more than a storage room now." She turned to the stairs and was about to go back down to the ground floor but paused when John didn't move.
But now fate had reunited him with the alpha he'd chosen, and his traitorous body apparently wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to reverse the five-year separation. It was as if some foreign creature had escaped the chains of his self-imposed celibacy, and completely derailed his train of thought.
His body was functioning as if on autopilot. As he pulled on his winter coat, he composed a short text on his mobile phone and sent it off.
"It's... fine..." Sherlock said hesitantly, crossing his arms as if he didn't know what else to do with his hands. "Just forget about it." He turned around and walked away, sensing Victor's eyes on his back.
Those three simple words struck John like a bolt of lightning. Something deep inside him contracted hard, as if an immense hand had grabbed his intestines and squeezed, causing a pained cry to escape his throat. A low whimper that he didn't even recognise as his own.
When he got to his room, Sherlock was already standing at the window, looking out. He'd tossed his t-shirt and pullover onto the bare mattress. Victor studied Sherlock's naked back for a moment: the raised vertebrae, the shape of his shoulder blades. The urge to go to him, wrap his arms around him, and pull him close, was immense. Instead, Victor closed the door, leaned back against it, and waited.
The slender omega penises were all erect, and the nipples on both males and females had contracted to firm buds. John thought he could make out something wet running down their bare legs.
Victor carefully withdrew his fingers and huffed irritably. "Don't complain afterwards!" He leaned over to the nightstand and picked up one of the little packets. He watched with annoyance as John turned over awkwardly and arranged himself until he was kneeling facing away from Victor. "Don't want to look at me?"
