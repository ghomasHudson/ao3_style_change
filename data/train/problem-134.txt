Douglas didn't take the jacket.  Instead he said:  "I'm going to ask you a few questions, then.    The cockpit voice recorder records for what minimum period of time?"
"Well, you have calluses on your fingertips on this hand. Like from pressing down with a stringed instrument. It can't be the guitar because your nails are short on both hands, and guitar players keep their pick hand nails long. That means it has to be one of the orchestra strings since they're played with a bow. After that I just guessed, because the violin is what more people play than the viola or cello."
“Trust me it wasn’t easy but the way I see it: either you lied to me and that whole business at St. Barts was a fraud, or your absence has finally driven me round the bend. Either way I don’t care. I can’t live in a world without you,” John made a valiant, failing attempt to keep his voice from breaking, “I tried, Sherlock, I did. I can’t do it. You are so much…my life ceases without you. So I don’t care. I need you and that’s all there is to it.”
“I’d thought I made myself perfectly clear,” Sherlock said without letting up on John’s mouth, “on many occasions.”
Sherlock smiled a bit at that and John nearly lost all the composure he had left seeing that “I’m so proud of my clever blogger” smile playing on kiss stained lips. “I’m in love with you, John,” Sherlock finally said, “Have been for the longest time. I’ve fought it and taken every opportunity to show it best I know how. It seems I failed in both regards.”
It wasn’t until John had gotten them back to the rundown room he’d been crashing in, and well into his undertaking of stitching up the lashings on Sherlock’s back, did Sherlock emerge into coherency. Not that he said anything at first. But John watched the brightness return to his eyes as they danced about the room, absorbing every detail, before landing, at last, on John.
“And this is me insisting,” he continued, gun leveled at the head of the man standing behind Sherlock. He’d lowered the whip but it was clear what he’d been using it for. John felt his patience meet its end.
“Not John,” Sherlock slurred, even as John released his chains, “John’s not coming, John thinks I’m dead.”
“Yeah,” John said before he could devote any thought to anything except that delightful thing Sherlock was doing against his tongue, “No, I mean, no…what?” John gave Sherlock a very half-hearted shove to shake his head, “Got what settled?”
He wasn’t nearly so removed from his emotions as believed, social exchanges or expectations for those emotions, yes, but not the emotions themselves. In fact, in comparing himself to others he’d be forced to admit he was probably more acutely aware of them than the general populous. So it was with absolute certainty and clarity of mind that he could say he was in love with John Watson and had been for some time.
was the one who was believed to be dead. It made John’s soul ache at the tenderness all while frustrating the hell out of him, but wasn’t that just so Sherlock. John really wanted to punch him straight in the jaw for being dead, for making him watch. He settled for biting at Sherlock’s bottom lip instead.
“Huh…I honestly wasn’t expected it to be so easy.” Sherlock’s lips turned up in the smile John well knew, the one Sherlock always gave him when he’d managed to surprise the detective.
“This just,” John tried to say, “This isn’t the way…” tried because Sherlock seemed entirely unwilling to give up John’s mouth, “people do things.”
That statement was the first thing, since this whole ordeal had started, that gave him pause but he didn’t linger on it. Instead he leveraged Sherlock’s arm over his shoulder, bearing as much of the taller man’s weight as he could.
If he had to put a date on it he would state it as being the night John shot the cabby. Seeing him across the tape as Sherlock began to describe the shooter, John, to Lestrade, so unassuming and calm, blending perfectly. John
“If you were capable of that,” Mycroft smirked, it was a wholly Holmes trait, that unholy smirk like they knew every-bloody-thing, “I believe you would have done so long before we could have found ourselves here.”
When he’d reached the end, saw the tattered state Sherlock was being kept in, he nearly regretted the swiftness of his Browning, longing momentarily for the slow ease of his scalpel. His veins were ice, the cold fire of untouched steel. He entered the room and immediately took out the man to the left. He fired the shot without thinking, without feeling, without regret. He would raze the
“I-I had no idea,” Sherlock began, clearing his throat and starting over, “I owe you a thousand apologies. I had no idea you would be so affected.”
“Really, John?” Sherlock asked in the way he always did when he was forced to answer a question he didn’t think should have needed asked, “Must I spell everything out for you?”
John knew what Sherlock must see in his eyes. No hesitation, no regret. John’s survival dictated Sherlock’s and desperate creatures are capable of just about anything to ensure their survival.
Much of John was left behind in that forgettable black car. He was still John Watson, doctor, soldier, but he forewent the empathy, morality, and restraint that went along with them, instead he allowed himself to be taken over by the detachment of the doctor and the ruthlessness of the soldier. In short, he tucked his broken heart away in order to make it whole. Heaven help anyone who thought of getting in his way.
“No,” John said, “it’s smart.” Sherlock made a non-committal noise obviously aimed at pacifying John. “You can want something,” John soldiered on this being alternately cut off by fantastic kisses, “in a moment and the next,” John was beginning to think Sherlock had the best lung capacity of anyone he’d ever met, let alone kissed, “change your mind.”
The stitches formed neat, tender rows along his skin. Dispassionate was the farthest thing from what he felt for Sherlock, from what he had ever felt for Sherlock. His broken heart was making itself known once again, impossible to deny in Sherlock’s presence.
“Let me guess – he was telling you that since the flat he’s been to with K has blinds and the shades drawn so he can’t tell you where it is?”  While he was sure there was more to their conversation than that, it seemed like a neutral enough talking point.
"Last May.  It was after dinner and I was watching the news.  Jennifer was in the room coloring.  The announcer said something about an investigation by the Yard into multiple reported cases of abuse.  They showed a picture of the suspect and Jennifer looked up at that moment and started screaming."  Even now he looked stunned.  "She ran off to her room before I could say anything."
"No," Phillip whispered, still looking at the ground.  "Then he asked if I'd been telling the truth when I said on the form when I broke my arm that I was having sex.  I said I was."
"No further questions," Clark said with a sigh.  He went back to sit with Harvey.  From the gestures and facial expressions John could see, it was obvious they were arguing about something.  Neither Lou nor Susan went up to the stand; they simply looked on with amusement until the argument ended.
Harvey switched subjects.  "You said your mother talked to Dr. Martin.  She asked if you were behaving and Dr. Martin said you were."
"Well, her father's dead, right? So it's not an issue of explaining why they can't visit him anymore?" asked Eli.
"Haven't seen or met anyone with that description."  He was now able to look Lestrade directly in the eye.
Sherlock looked briefly at the picture, and then back at Moira. "Has anyone else come to visit you?"
"Two months later she died of a stroke," Sherlock said in his usual way of not quite answering the question. "I should have known better." He took the file and got up to leave the room.
Yes, John, he did. He knows just how Moira feels and thinks it would help put her at ease. He's right.
"Never went to sleep," Sherlock said, glancing over his shoulder briefly.  The other man had come to stand in the doorway.
The neighborhood where Sherlock apparently had placed this flat was in fact near the Aherne's flat, and they even passed by that building on the cab ride there.  The driver stopped in front of a nearby playground that was probably the one Moira Aherne had taken her dog to.  Sherlock scrambled out right away, and John followed him after giving the driver the fare.  Once the cab was gone, Sherlock turned in a circle, eyes wide open.  He then cast his eyes up the street.  "It's just up there.  Come on, I want a closer look at the building."  He sounded more like his normal investigative self, which made John feel slightly better.
"And you helped her at work," John said slowly.  He had suspected what that meant almost since K had said it, but Sherlock apparently hadn't known he had known that.  He sprang up from the couch with a look of horror on his face and if John hadn't stood up himself and grabbed his arm he would have probably bolted to his room.  "If you didn't, what would happen?" John asked in a neutral tone.  K might have told Sherlock otherwise, but he knew perfectly well that the only reason Sherlock would have done such a thing would be under duress.  "Because threats are just as much as force as holding a gun to your head," he continued.  Sherlock was as still as a deer in headlights, frozen in his attempt to flee.  "No matter what she told you, you're not going to be arrested for it.  You told Phillip the same thing, remember?"  He made his voice as soft as possible, as if he was trying to calm a frightened animal.
Lou sighed again. "She can't, no, but others can make a plea to release her." He looked again at the wall of the people he'd helped. "I'm making a few calls like that today, but I thought it would be better to talk to you directly, since I never got to know Victim Three that well." Victim Three had been what Sherlock was called in all the trial documents.
"I wonder why his mother pays for a mobile for him.  It's not like she puts any other effort into him," John idly remarked.
"You'll be getting there before the start of the trial, I presume," Sherlock said from behind him.  John turned to look at him.  He stood in the doorway, still wearing the clothes had worn yesterday, Hamish under his arm as usual.
"She's going to plea," Mrs. Hudson instantly replied.  "What happened in court to make her suddenly so worried about a conviction?"
For those of you following No Final Solution: it is on hiatus until I finish The Ball I Threw. My apologies. I will finish it.
The trip wasn't long, so it didn't give him much of a chance to look around. He was almost disappointed when the man - Douglas, wasn't he called? - told him: "Get out."
"Implying some nasty things about who's been testifying."  John left it at that.  Not wanting to hear any more questions that he couldn't fully answer, he got out of bed and headed for the shower.
I've disabled comments for obvious reasons, but I hope you can think about those children today and think good thoughts for them, in hope their futures will be better than this past.
"Come in," he said.  While he wasn't supposed to talk to Sherlock, he couldn't just leave the boy out in the rain.
"Hi," she said cheerfully.  "Me dad moved my bed to his room.  I sleep there now.  He lets Rory sleep on my bed too."
"Not always," Eli said.  "Our second elder statesman, Brian, came here for a friend of his.  But he moved out of the area."
"Lesson it is then.  I'll do something that we all discussed last session; emotional reasoning."  Dr. Dodson filled the next fifteen minutes with a discussion of the concept, how it related to perception of the world, and what to do about it.  John didn't pay much attention, since it was something he already knew the basics about.
Jennifer nodded and stood up in the chair, using one hand to cup her groin.  "Back and forth," she added.
"People left the courtroom when she was on the stand," John said.  He hadn't planned to talk about the details of the trial beyond what was already in the papers, but Mrs. Hudson seemed to be an exception.
"The children?" John echoed.  He had a feeling this was about more than the children K had abused, but wasn't sure what it was.
"The laptop by the chair I was sitting in before," John said back. Martin shuffled over to the chair and sat down. He felt more dread now then he had at any point in his life, even before his seventh exam sit or his dad's funeral. Hesitantly he pulled up the browser and typed in the URL to the site Arthur had so proudly designed.
"Once he finds out that his father didn't run off, wants to see him, and loves him, he will want to live with him.  He's hungry for love."  Sherlock looked away at the last sentence.
"Yes, I do," he said before going up the stairs.  He spent the whole evening by himself, watching the news, heating up dinner, and finally going to bed upstairs.  All that time he bit back the urge to go running out and find Sherlock.  The only thing stopping him was that he had no idea where Sherlock could have gone.  He could have asked Mycroft, of course, but at this point he didn't want to ask him anything.  Sherlock would see it as betrayal.  So instead he lay in bed for well over an hour before sleep came, that feeling in his stomach never going away.
Phillip spoke again, hesitantly.  "She did that the whole time I was in Her lap and I didn't say anything about it because I didn't want to get up.  Finally She said She had to go back to work, and I got up and went back home."
"That's our job," she reassured him.  "Oh, and the family of Victim Five's going to be sitting in court.  None of them are going to testify and they all wanted to be there."  She opened the door and walked down the hall.  After a few seconds Lou came into view and she called out: "Over here, Lou."
"Of course.  You are aware that most children are capable of expressing such a preference?"  At that moment Sherlock looked just like the person he had been before this case came to dominate their lives, and John was grateful for it.  Then Sherlock looked down at the paper again and gritted his teeth.  "Victim Eleven is Alla Pinyakova?"
"Yes, of course.  Every fact I saw led me closer to the conclusion that She was K, but I investigated it as if I knew nothing about K in the first place."  He briefly turned to look at John, looking proud for a moment.  "However, even if She was not wealthy, She would still frequently move because of the children."
How long this would have gone on John didn't know, because after a minute Moira's brother Kieran came over to where his father stood.  He looked furious.  "So she's the one who hurt my sister?"  He pointed at K just as the lights went out.
"But he doesn't know him," John responded with confusion.  "What if he's mad at him for not seeing him in all that time?"
"Well, come upstairs with me."  Phillip obediently followed John up the steps and stood aside as he unlocked the door.  From the door he could see Sherlock was on the sofa like before but was sitting normally instead of lying down.  Phillip apparently saw him as well, as he pushed John aside to get into the flat.  He was momentarily annoyed but this evaporated when Phillip sat down next to Sherlock and started to cry.
"Why don't we play something else?" Sherlock suggested, and Phillip picked up his flute again.  For the better part of an hour the two of them played a set of music that John didn't recognize at all.  He could see how happy it was making them, though, and that was enough.
"She thought if she just kept asking I'd marry her.  I think she just wanted the security of two incomes and not because she was in love.  Around Phillip's third birthday she figured out I was never going to accept.  I usually saw him twice a week and when I went to her flat at the usual time there was no one there."  His face was full of anguish.  "I got a court date and she showed up.  Said she wasn't interested in me seeing Phillip anymore.  That was the beginning of ten years of fighting."
At that moment Lestrade came into the room.  "Mr. Aherne, it's good to see you again.  Wish it was under better circumstances but..." He shrugged.  "In about a minute the lights will come on and Moira will be able to see the people behind the mirror."
That was enough to snap him out; Sherlock blinked and seemed suddenly aware how strange he looked naked and attacking sheets with a knife.  He took a dressing gown from the floor and hastily tied it around himself.  He was slightly pink, and didn't look John in the eye.
"It would be better if you stayed outside. Children are sometimes reluctant to disclose in the presence of a parent." As Lestrade spoke, Mr. Aherne's eyes flicked down the hall, towards the lounge. "Why don't the three of us go to the lounge while Dr. Watson talks to Moira." The three of them walked down the hall then, Donovan still resting her hand on Mr. Aherne's shoulder.
"I'd pretend that She was my mummy.  Sometimes She would let me call her that."  Phillip looked so mortified John wondered if he would just flee the flat and not return.
"He'll come back," Martin reassured him.  "He's just a bit broken up about all this."  He paused and added: "I think what I said to him earlier was hard."
"Actually, yes. Some.  A few of the images were originally traded online, on a password-protected forum.  It was brought down in a sweep a few years ago, but several members, including some frequent posters, are still unidentified.  Dr. Martin might not have been a member of that board - and nothing on her computer or laptop indicated that she'd been there at all - but she clearly knew some of the posters there."
Sherlock shook his head.  "No one who's going to testify in the trial's allowed to watch what's going on in court until after they testify.  Otherwise they might be influenced by the others."
"Will you testify?"  John wasn't referring to Sherlock's own history with K but rather what the conversation they had the day she had been arrested.  In all likelihood whatever she'd done to Sherlock wasn't something she could be charged with anymore.  Of course, it would still have to come out, if their conversation was brought up.
"Then one of the police came back and I left.  He gave me his mobile number and told me to ring him if I had more to say."
John was able to dress in just a few minutes, one of the remnants of being in the army, and they were both out the door and into a cab in a remarkably quick period of time.  They didn’t speak to each other, and the silence seemed to fit with the darkened city.
"No."  Phillip shook his head.  "He told me about a friend he had from school and he said he understood a lot of what I was feeling, but he never said anything about that person."
The man - Arthur - looked undaunted.  "He can have some of the bread.  Didn't that passenger we took to Dublin last year say that people all over the world have bread with their breakfasts?  Except she said they ate pickled vegetables in Japan.  I'm not sure I'd want to eat anything pickled then.  It's too sour, and breakfast should be happy and sweet."
"Hello, did you come about the flat on the third floor?  It's still available.  Quite a lot of people have come to look at it, but I'm the one that makes the final choice."  She looked down the walkway at John.  "Are you with him?  Come over here, don't be shy.  Better for anyone who's going to live there to see what it's like."
"If I didn't want to go out to eat somewhere I wouldn't have suggested it.  Since when have you known me to do something I don't want to do just because someone else wants it?"
“On the contrary, Mr. Ogbeide, this has been a very useful conversation, and I'm glad to have spoken with you.”  Sherlock rose from his chair and turned off the recorder.
The idea for this as an icebreaker is of course based on the ACD canon that Sherlock Holmes retires and keeps bees, but this specific picture I got the idea from the hilarious story by
The conversation had to be over, since Sherlock could now hear the man coming down the hallway.  When the footsteps stopped he heard the man say "You're awake already."
Moira clutched Brownie to her chest and slouched in her seat.  "He didn't ask the same things other people did.  And he knew about Her before I said anything."
Even if Sherlock had been willing to talk, John wouldn't have been able to carry on his end of a conversation after hearing something like that.  They spent the day in companionable silence, John watching crap telly and Sherlock alternating between pacing, playing the violin, and sitting on the sofa with Hamish the bee.  Occasionally he would look at John like he was trying to tell him something, but he never said anything.
As I said on my other story, sorry for the delay. I am working on five different writing projects and trying to juggle them is hard.
“I think you’ve told us enough for today.”  Sherlock both looked and sounded carefully neutral.  Lestrade had spent most of the time when Graham relayed his terrible story with an expression of shock on his face.  John himself had to bite back tears and still had a lump in his throat.  It occurred to him that Sherlock’s neutral expression was his own way of biting back all emotion.
"When you first told the police what you'd been doing, you asked if someone could help you if you were arrested."
"Not all of it, of course.  Most of the photographs.  We're still trying to identify the children in most of them." There was an awkward silence.
She folded her hands on her lap.  "Well, my mother died shortly after I was born, so it's always been just my father and me.  He didn't have any living relatives, so we are - were - really alone in the world.  When I was younger we traveled all over Europe and Asia; we only settled here when I was twelve.  Even then, he would go on these business trips and leave me with friends."  After a pause where she seemed to collect her thoughts, she began again.  "Most of the time these were very short trips.  This one I remember because he told me it was going to be six months.  I had my GSCEs next year and I assumed he'd take me with him.  But he didn't.  He said something about how India wouldn't be very fun to me, even though we'd been there before.  Now that I think about it, he seemed nervous."
Thankfully the waitress finally seemed to take the hint when Sherlock didn’t react to her pressing her chest against his back as she put down his plate, and left them to eat their food in peace. He felt John’s chest against his back earlier in the evening, how could she ever hope to compare? How could anyone ever hope to compare?
know I was the one for you?” Sherlock was fairly sure he’d never seen Michelle Whitfield in his life before this evening.
"What makes you so special!?” he growled, leaning in close, almost revealing himself from the shadows, almost.
“Yeah, they’re here. Whatever you do, don’t lose them.” John said handing Lestrade the box containing his and Sherlock’s wedding bands.
“Well, the knife perforated Mr. Holmes’ spleen, and we had to perform a partial splenectomy to take care of all the damaged tissue.”
“Oh.” Sherlock said quietly, looking back down at his lap. John was a doctor, of course he would have noticed the marks, of course he would have been able to figure out what they meant.
Before long the need to breath gets to great, and John forces himself to pull away from Sherlock’s now kiss swollen lips. “I don’t remember saying anything about a relationship. I’m no stranger to a one night stand. Now, tell me about this ‘get off and get out’ lifestyle you lead.”
the Yard,” Sherlock huffed, offended. “I sometimes led them my assistance when they are out of their depth, which is always.”
he had heard, despite the viola player being slightly off, most likely due to her having to use a borrowed bow.
(Side note: After some googling, I discovered there's apparently a Barlow Road in West Hempstead. That was a complete coincidence)
“What? No. Why would I care what or who you find attractive? Men, women, both, neither, it makes no difference to me.” It didn’t, and he didn’t care.
Feeling the conversation stray in to territory far too emotionally dangerous, John changes the topic to Sherlock’s work with the Yard, and him coming back to London.
“I honestly didn’t think I’d live to see the day.” Came Lestrade’s voice from somewhere behind them. For a moment, John had honestly forgotten that he was even there. “That may be the single most impressive thing I’ve ever seen in my life.”
“It’s getting kind of late.” John said after almost another hour of talking, and a fair bit of snogging. “We should probably get going.”
“Ok, I’m going to chalk this attitude up to you being in pain,” John sighed, “but like hell I’m going to leave you. I’m taking you to hospital.”
“Oh right, a friend. Because my mates and I look at each other and act the way you two do all the time.”
“Well what about your dad? Surely he has some sway too. Didn’t you say he holds a ‘minor position in the British Security Service?’ And Mycroft, he’s rising through the government ranks at an alarming pace.” This couldn’t be the end of it. They couldn’t let the piece of filth using Mummy and Daddy to get him and his friends out of trouble, not when it was something this serious.
“Okay, I posed that as a question, but it wasn’t really a question.” She sighed, stepping fully into the office. “I checked the schedule and we both don’t have patients for the next two hours, you’ve eaten nothing but vending machine food all week, and I still owe you for coming in on your days off. I’m treating you to lunch, and as your boss, I forbid you from declining. Now grab your coat, we’re going.”
John watched with his heart in his throat as Sherlock opened himself up, biting his lip and moaning as he breached himself with one, two, three fingers. Sherlock was beautiful, an otherworldly creature John didn’t feel worthy to touch, but he could touch him. Sherlock was his, and only his to touch.
The ride from John’s flat to campus was short, and passed in near silence. All too soon it was four o’clock, and Sherlock found himself in one of the university’s meeting rooms. The room was set up like a mini court, in the front, facing the rest of the room, sat the University Disciplinary Committee, made up of seven professors and administrators. There was a small table – the “witness stand” – facing the committee. And finally there were chairs set up as a sort of gallery. Looking around, Sherlock saw that on one side sat Sebastian, Eddie, Brian, and their parents; while on the other sat Malcolm, Alec, Molly, and… his mother. Well, that wasn’t really much of a surprise; she had stopped by to “check in on him” at least once a week – oftentimes more – and called almost daily since she found out what happened.
“Same time tomorrow?” Sherlock asked when John got up, looking hopeful. It was almost hard to believe that three days ago, John had no idea who Consulting Detective Sherlock Holmes was, it felt like they’d known each other for years, that Sherlock had always been part of his life.
Nearly forty-five minutes later, after far too many goodbyes and promises to ‘get together soon’, Sherlock finally had John back in their room and all to himself, where he learned that reality getting John out of a bespoke three-piece suit was better than any fantasy. There were pants underneath the trousers in reality, but needless to say, they weren’t a problem for long.
With London rushing by outside the window, Sherlock started berating himself. He couldn’t believe he let time slip away from him; he couldn’t believe his internal clock failed him, it was always so precise. It wasn’t like he needed to do the interviews today, they could have waited. He knew he was going to do something to mess it all up. All he could really do now was hope John wouldn’t be too upset, it wasn’t even John’s idea in the first place.
“I know, Sherlock. I’m only teasing. I’m exceedingly fond, and I love you too.” John said, leaning up to close the distance between them, kissing Sherlock softly, but thoroughly.
“Well, you can think about it. In the mean time, I’m going to go take that shower.” John said planting a kiss in Sherlock’s curls, and was then up and out of the bed before Sherlock could make any last ditch effort to keep him there. Not that Sherlock would ever do such a thing.
“Yes, well I never had much faith in them to begin with. But since then, Lestrade has slipped me case files when he thinks I might find them interesting. And then there are the occasional times he allows me into the crime scene when his superiors are busy.”
The new physical therapist – this one named Heather Something – arrived at nine o’clock sharp the following morning. When Sherlock refused to return to Mycroft’s home for his recovery, Mycroft had contacted the physical therapist, and arranged for her to go to Baker Street instead. John thought it was considerate, that Mycroft was being
With a wicked chuckle, Sherlock finally released John, and breaking their gaze, turned to a now awkward and slightly embarrassed looking Lestrade. “Should anything come up and you need us for something, Lestrade, don’t even think about calling or texting. We’ll stop by your office sometime tomorrow, you can tell us then.” He said, before reaching into Lestrade’s coat pocket and pulling out a set of keys. “And don’t bother stopping in when you come by to pick up the car.”
“What? Oh, no.” Actually, it did smart a bit, but clearly this DI was more than just lead investigator. John didn’t want to pile anything on him at the moment. “No, I’m fine, Detective. Really.”
“The five!” Sherlock sighed, he didn’t have time to explain everything. “On the one we found, there was a large orange number five written on the side. And look, a large number five on that carton. It’s the same one.”
“Excellent. I’d like to speak with Mrs. Rachlin now.” John knew that look, he knew that tone. Sherlock was on to something.
John soon found himself giving up the fight to maintain some semblance of composure, and was laughing along with Sherlock, the deep, rich rumble of his friend’s chuckles impossible to resist. Almost everything about his friend was impossible to resist.
“He’s an adult,” John groaned, almost whimpering, his voice doing nothing to quell Sherlock’s growing need, “he can look after himself.”
– yes I do.” Sherlock breathed between kisses. His wires were fried and he was desperate for John, desperate for more.
“To incapacitate versus just restrain, yeah.” John nodded. “And this one’s easier, at least I think it’s easier.”
“Right,” John continued once the clapping stopped, “with that all said, a town car and wedded bliss await, so Sherlock and I are going to head out. Thank you all again. Truly, thank you.”
Next chapter we return to the normal chapter format.  January 6th approaches for our boys, shenanigans must ensue.
Sherlock let out a sigh of relief as he surreptitiously watched John Watson turn and walk away from him and out of the library. He had to take a few deep breaths to calm his pounding heart, because of course he knew who John was, how could he not? He made a point of finding out what he could about anyone who had any say over his academic future – advisers, professors, and in John’s case, TAs.
“Oh dear, yes.” Mrs. Hudson nodded sympathetically.  “But it must be nice to be home again, getting to be with people you care about.” She added, glancing towards Sherlock, much to his dismay. Why couldn’t the woman leave well enough alone? Why was she so determined he have
As Sherlock leaned over John’s shoulder to get a better look at the document on the laptop’s screen, he could hear John hold his breath, he could feel him shiver. Shit, he’d made John uncomfortable... again. “Looks… uh… yeah, looks good. Should be… um… should be very helpful. Nice of you make it, thoughtful.”
“Yes, this isn’t even half of what I would really want. And why does that matter if the table’s covered?” Sherlock frowned, sitting up on the back of the couch, his bare feet resting on the cushions, “we always just eat out here and use the coffee table.”
“Here.” Sherlock shoved his phone into her hands. He couldn’t talk about this, he wouldn’t let himself even entertain the idea of it.
“But that’s the point,” she continued, “you’re already going to be so much smarter than all the other kids, you don’t want to rub it in and make it harder by being four or five years younger than them too.”
“Oy! You’re one to talk, Miss Marple!” Laughs John. “She’s a TV detective. You know what, never mind” He says when met with a blank stare.
“And in the mean time, you decided to just have a little check to see who was contacting me? That it?” Crossing his arms in front of him, John really wished he were in more than just a towel.
Things soon grew frantic. With one hand still braced on the headboard, Jack reached back with the other, blindly gripping Sherlock’s thigh, and forcing him in deeper with each thrust, Sherlock’s – well, not really his – name tumbling from his lips over and over again. Sherlock heart was pounding, his skin felt overheated, his sweat mixing with Jack’s as his chest pressed flush against Jack’s back. The tension building in his abdomen once again coiling to the point of breaking. He was close, he was so close. He wanted… he needed…
“Oh, so you must be the young man Sherlock’s told me absolutely nothing about.” The woman – Mrs. Hudson – said, looking pointedly at Sherlock.
“And me being bi-sexual? Which, by the way, you’re lucky I’m already out, or you’d have a serious problem on your hands.” John adds.
“Bedroom!” John gasped when Sherlock tore his mouth from his only to start nipping and sucking on his neck. They couldn’t be restricted, he needed room to move, to explore. “Bed… NOW!” was all he could manage.
“Sherlock, if you would now place the ring on John’s finger.” At this Lestrade stood up and hurried to give them both their rings.
“It’s been a while since my psych rotation, but I’m fairly sure that’s not how the human mind works.” John laughed.
“Not really, though.” Sarah grimaced slightly. “I mean, sure, he shouldn’t have read it, and he defiantly shouldn’t have jumped to conclusions and started making accusations like he did, but the phone screen does light up. He probably wasn’t aware he was looking until he already was doing it.”
Eventually – it could have been minutes, it could have been hours – Sherlock felt John break the kiss, moving back just far enough that Sherlock could fully see his face.
"Exactly, John! Exactly!” John had to fight to keep from flushing red as Sherlock beamed at him. Sherlock’s proud smile was not something he could ever get used to. “I’ll bet anything that the neighbor who called was actually your step-daughter, ensuring you got timely medical attention. And you said it yourself, the burglars only stole some of your husband’s family heirlooms, nothing of any real monetary value. They would only mean something to someone in the family.”
“I do – I do too.” Sherlock blushed, dripping his head to capture John’s lips in a chaste kiss. In just over a month he was marrying John Watson, he was going to be part of John’s identity, John was going to be part of his.

“As I recall, you didn’t need all the much convincing when your mum and Mrs. Hudson came to us with the idea,” came John’s toothbrush muffled voice from the bathroom.
John’s eyes went soft, and Sherlock could have sworn he slid down the couch a bit, closer to him. “No, it’s a struggle, I get it. When addiction takes a hold, it’s hard to regain control. But you did, you’re not letting it define you. That’s what counts.”
It wasn’t until late the next morning when a thoroughly sated Sherlock was preparing himself and John tea and some brunch in bed, that he noticed he phone on the coffee table, the light blinking to indicate there was a text waiting.
“Sherlock,” Sherlock replied, once again looking at John’s chin instead of his eyes. “Only my Nanna calls me William anymore, everyone else calls me Sherlock.”
“Of course you always wear a suit.” John muttered to himself. Sherlock really was almost too posh for words.
“Forever?” John chuckled, “You’d be willing to give up cases and corpses, all for an eternity here on the couch?”
“Thank you. I should let you know that we’ve come across some new evidence that leads us to believe John was abducted. We need to see John’s room, it might give us some leads as to who took him, and maybe where.”
John went limp in Sherlock’s arms, his eyes no longer fought to open, his breathing became shallower.
“Ha, no. I think the three hours here was enough team bonding time. Not to mention the last two years I’ve been on the team, and all this year. I’ve bonded enough with them.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and yanked the offending garment off John’s still warm from the shower body. “You’ve said that every single time we’ve had sex since we returned from the sex holiday, and every time I tell you the same thing. So, for the twelfth time this week, my need for you will never leave my system. My need for you will only increase with time, and is now integral to my proper functioning. You don’t want me to stop functioning properly, do you?”
Well duh, they're falling in love. But now it appears they've come to terms with what they're feeling, don't you think it's about time they open their eyes and figure out how the other feels? I know I do. I guess you better stay tuned for what comes next!! :D
“He’s still in our room. He wouldn’t let me get any help last night, but this morning I heard his alarm and saw he had plans with you. He’s mentioned you a lot, mostly in passing, but yeah… I figured you might be able to help. He might listen to you.”
“You’re like a coiled spring all ready to bounce around. Springy.” John explained. “So what is it? What did  you do?”
“What time is it?” He asked, sitting up next to Sherlock with his back against the headboard, completely unaware of the storm raging in Sherlock’s chest.
“Jesus Christ, Sherlock! You can’t tamper with evidence. You’re going to get us arrested!” John hisses, but he’s already moving towards the officers, ready to divert their attention.
“No, I’m really alri –” John started, but an oxygen mask was already being trust over his nose and mouth, and another paramedic was forcing him into the back of the second ambulance to examine him.
“That is harassment, Sherlock! It’s assault!” John said through gritted teeth. He was upset, why would he be upset about something happening to Sherlock? “You can’t just let this happen,” he continued, “you need to report this to your senior resident.”
So no, Sherlock wasn’t mad; he just didn’t want to be too close to him anymore. John wasn’t sure if it was something he did, something he said – his stomach dropped at the thought of what he might have accidentally done or said in his sleep the night after the game when his subconscious took over. All he knew was that every time Sherlock put distance between them, every time he stopped and took a step back, it hurt.
“Oh you left me quite sore. Pleasantly sore, I should add,” Sherlock smirked, “but there’s still an extensive list of other things we can do.”
This is a fairly short one today, a little filler before some good stuff happens (at least I hope you think it's good).
“How did it happen?” Sherlock blurted, breaking the silence that had settled over them. “I’m sorry, ignore me. That was personal. I shouldn’t have asked.”
“Is it a good thing or a bad thing?” John huffed, rolling his eyes. Really, what went on in Sherlock’s absurd head? “It’s a very good thing! I want everyone to see how wonderful you are. Though I couldn’t give a toss if someone did disapprove, I’ll love you all the same.” Love, he liked saying love.
Carefully lowering himself back down on to the mattress, and with several deep, deliberate breaths, John attempted to calm his racing heart. Closing his eyes, John tried to think back, tried to remember what had happened to him, how he ended up in this cell. He had just got back from the park – back from Sherlock, he thought with a smile – the house was silent, either his father was already passed out, or not home. What was it? What happened next?… Changing! He was changing, getting ready for bed, when something moved behind him, and there was the sharp jab to his neck, and then nothing, everything went black. Looking down, John saw he was in his pajamas, still wearing socks, and his watch was still around his wrist. It had really happened, it wasn’t some twisted nightmare brought on by the stress of A-levels looming overhead, or graduation rapidly approaching, John had been kidnapped. He had been taken from his bedroom, and now he sat in his too thin pajamas, cold and alone, in a grey cinder block cell.
Sherlock flagged down a cab, and the half hour ride to St. Bart’s passed in complete silence. Molly wrung her hands the entire way, shooting anxious looks over at Sherlock every so often. She had tried calling her uncle, but there was no answer. Service was notoriously poor down in the… down there. They didn’t have the number for the landline, and just the thought of explaining why he needed to be connected to the… there, made Sherlock feel ill. And so they rode in silence, and with every passing second, Sherlock dread grew. What was he going to see when they finally reached Bart’s? What was he about to walk into? What if his nightmare was about to come true? What was he going to do if…
The last of their guests – Lestrade and Molly – had just left, and Sherlock showed them out. Well, he didn’t so much show them out, as he was trying to convince them that allowing him to do the post-mortems on murder victims first would save everyone time. He’d be damned if they were going to leave, and deny him the last word. He didn’t actually manage to convince them, but it wasn’t over, they’d come around and see sense sooner or later.
Following Sherlock’s lead – something that was becoming a bit of a habit as of late – John stepped calmly out of the conference room and headed for the lifts. They weren’t stopped, no one even bothered to look at them. Sherlock had never looked so smug, John hated that look. No, he loved it.
A small, reassuring smile formed on John’s face, as he threaded their fingers together and gave Sherlock’s hand a squeeze. “Well he’s a piece of shit little bastard, not worthy to even a millisecond more of either of our time.”
Sherlock, however, was quick to tell him not to put any stock into her words, since Mrs. Hudson loved to cook, and was always bringing up food.
“Yeah? And you loved every second of it,” Sherlock grinned, “the blood pumping through your veins, the adrenaline, the potential of just the two of us against the rest of the world!”
When it came time for Sherlock’s physical therapy sessions, John would make himself scarce, retreating up to his room, running to the shops, or visiting with Mrs. Hudson. He’d even rescheduled his weekly appointment with Ella to coincide with one of Sherlock’s morning sessions. Between the sessions and once they were done for the day, they’d resume their quiet – and sometimes not so quiet – comradery. At some point, John would usually have to force Sherlock to eat something. At first Sherlock would refuse, repeating his ridiculous claim that the food just slowed him down, but eventually he’d give in. And the added energy clearly helped, because with each passing day, John could see Sherlock getting stronger and stronger.
What? Why should John be the last person ‘out of everyone’ to… Of course, the alcoholic brother! He must not be straight. There was always something.
“You told me your name. I couldn’t very well call myself the world’s only consulting detective, if I couldn’t successfully locate one man not currently in hiding. Even if you were in hiding and I didn’t know your name, I would have still been able to find you.” Sherlock grinned, lifting his head to rest his chin on John’s chest.
“Whoa! Don’t blame that on me!” Sherlock protested. “You’ve been patently ridiculous since the moment I met you,” he laughed.
“Yeah to you maybe.” When he explained it, yeah, it all made perfect sense, but it was like Sherlock could just look at a scene and put everything together in a matter of seconds. Sure John might have seen everything Sherlock saw, but Sherlock understood it.
The first to meet that fate was the assassin he’d unwittingly been sharing his dank shamble of a life with. She made for a weapon hidden in her groceries when he’d announced his intent. In his single-mindedness her betrayal barely registered, even after he’d pulled the trigger. He finished his packing, her weapon and everything of value they had accumulated shoved into an additional bag as he went. When he was done he locked the door behind him before kicking it back in and tossed the bag of their lives into a bin as he made his way to his next location. Without his wayward detective’s assistance no one had any hope of determining it to be anything other than an unfortunate robbery.
“What makes you think I won’t kill him myself?” John said finally, thinking back on 2 years of blinding, life-ending grief.
Absent sounds haunted him up the stairs. Experiments banging about in the kitchen. A mad melody played by violin regardless of the hour. Monologueing “conversations” that happened whether John was there or not. He couldn’t decide if it was better or worse than the little rented room he had been staying in since…since it all happened. Since the most brilliant, clever man John ever knew had taken his own life while all he could do was watch.
“I trust you can take it from here?” Mycroft intoned, like he hadn’t just handed John back his life in a single manila folder.
“Glad we got that settled,” Sherlock said, rather agreeably, before doubling his efforts to reduce John’s higher brain functions to a puddle of
Going off his force and enthusiasm John felt he could honestly say he had never been kissed by anyone who wanted so badly to kiss him as Sherlock. Being the focus of all that cleverness and considerable intellect was something John had never expected, even more so than the kiss. Normally only the dead got that kind of attention from Sherlock Holmes. John felt deeply honored. It didn’t matter if he “wasn’t gay.” Maybe it had never mattered. He would have to be a fool to pass up what Sherlock was giving him. John might not have been as brilliant as Sherlock but he had never been foolish.
Sherlock did stop his assault then, pulling back to look into John’s eyes, “You really didn’t know?”
In those four bleak walls there were no memories of Sherlock’s presence to be missed. There was nothing of Sherlock at all. It was, in fact, quite similar to where he had been staying before he moved to 221B. Some days he would wake up and it was like Sherlock had never existed at all. Others he would open his eyes expecting Bakers St. Expecting to hear Mrs. Hudson rummaging around downstairs or Sherlock yelling at the telly. Those were worse. Of course, he felt guilty about that: wishing his best friend had never existed rather than left him alone.
He did not make any particular note of any of the others that fell before him, only the information they provided, only the progress towards his goal.
Sherlock kissed him then and John was too surprised not to kiss back. When he regained his faculties he had the faintest idea that he should pull back but disregarded it in favor of exploring the crafty tongue that had just snaked its way into his mouth. It didn’t matter if John had never thought of his flatmate in this regard before because Sherlock was alive. My god, Sherlock was alive! Everything else could sod off.
Loving John and watching him date all those women was the hardest thing Sherlock had ever done and he’d quit drugs cold turkey. But pursuing John could have chased him off. Sherlock had meant what he told John, “I’d be lost without my blogger.” Sherlock could not live without John, could not function without John, so sacrifices had to be made.
John had been so alone before Sherlock and now he was alone again. He had soared but no longer. It was easier to pretend he’d never had wings at all.
For a long time, Sherlock just looked at him, likely reading everything John had endured in his absence, a task John knew from experience needed no input from him so he continued sewing.
John opened his door to see a tall slim silhouette standing facing the closed curtains. He suddenly hated those curtains beyond reason.
asked for. John didn’t spare much thought for him after. Muggings were so regrettably common in urban centers.
“Well as usual it wasn’t clear to me,” John responded in a tone twin to the first time he’d said something similar to Sherlock on their first case together.
“A mutual friend requires a lift home,” he said without preamble, handing over a plain file, “I believe you are just the man for the job.”
to the ground before any of them could stand between him and his detective. He’d proved it more times than he’d bothered to note on his journey and he would not let up with his aim so literally in sight.
He wasn’t sure how long he sat, motionless, transfixed by that singular name only that he had yet to verbalize a response when the car came to a stop.
It took John longer than he would admit to enter 221B Bakers St. again. It probably would have taken longer still if it hadn’t been for Mrs. Hudson’s encouragements. Not that they worked but that John couldn’t bear to disappoint her too. He did his best not to look at the rest of the flat, just went straight up to his bedroom. He couldn’t bear to see it as it inevitably was, unchanged, this place had been his home, their home. Now it was broken and it should have the good decency to look it.
Oh, he knew all too well the flack nurses had to deal with on a day-to-day basis, and adding to that by being an obstinate loved one was the last thing John wanted to do. “Still, I apologize.”
“Carl never had a history of seizures,” Sherlock said, clearing his throat and tamping down the growing pressure, “or epilepsy, or any other type of neurological disorder. That, and the police recovered all of his belongings save for his shoes. It never sat well with me.”
Was that the only word this man knew? “I asked, Afghanistan or Iraq. Where did you serve, in Afghanistan, or in Iraq? RAMC if I’m not mistaken.”
Sherlock didn’t hesitate for a single second, quickly rolling on the condom – Christ, he forgot how much he hated the feel of condoms – and slicking himself up before pushing into Jack. Jack was… oh god, Sherlock forgot how to breathe. Jack was tight, so tight. Jack was obviously a top, but the way he accepted Sherlock, the way he moaned and thrust back against Sherlock, clearly he wasn’t unfamiliar with bottoming. A top who was into occasional switching, so why… why was he bottoming for Sherlock? What was special about…
“What do you mean, bring someone back?” Sherlock asked, feeling justifiably confused. It wasn’t like someone else could do the stretches and exercises for him.
“If by ‘disturbing preoccupation’ you mean I think you should eat every day, then yeah. And if I’m a hobbit, then that makes you an elf.”
“What?” John stuttered, quickly looking up to check that Sherlock was still talking to the others, and not listening in to his and Mrs. Holmes’s conversation.
Sherlock was awake; the moonlight streaming in through the window illuminated the sleeping man curled next to him, highlighting his strong features, turning his handsome face into something utterly breathtaking. But then again, John had been taking Sherlock’s breath away for years. As he laid in bed, watching John sleep – his eyes moving behind closed lids – Sherlock couldn’t help but reflect on the life he lead with this man by his side.
John had just skidded around the last corner when his heart stuttered to a stop as he watched the bottom of Sherlock’s coat disappear over the edge of the retaining wall running along the riverbank. John stood frozen, unable to move, it was hardly more than a hundred meters. One hundred meters, that was all, if he had been faster, if his seatbelt hadn’t jammed – why the hell was he even still wearing his seatbelt – if he’d jumped that gate instead of gone around it. He should have been faster, he should have been right beside Sherlock, if he’d been there he could have…
Sherlock nodded. “We did, but you know how I think, how I process things far quicker than everyone else. You know I do
“John,” Sherlock started. They were nearly home, and he figured he might as well just get it over with.
“Two days ago I kind of inadvertently got roped into a police investigation; right place, right time sort of thing,” John said, deciding it was best not to tell her about running headfirst into a fire, he didn’t even re-bandage his hands for that very reason. She might focus on his blatant disregard for his own safety, and not the fact that he was attempting to save a life, that he did save a life. “I’m fine, and everyone involved is going to be fine, but I guess I got caught up in the adrenaline, and forgot about the cane. My leg has felt fine, and I haven’t needed it since.”
Sherlock felt his breath catch in his throat, John was standing in front of him now, hands clamped on his shoulders, beaming up at him. Sherlock knew for sure he’d never seen anything more beautiful. “I wish you had been there too.  I’d never had been able to do if it if it weren’t for you. You taught me everything.” And suddenly his arms were around John, pulling him into a tight hug.
Eventually, and with much fumbling – he didn’t want to lose the feeling of Jack’s body against his for even a second – Sherlock finally managed to find some lube and a condom which was miraculously within its expiry date, and when he turned back, his heart nearly gave out. In the not even fifteen seconds it took to root around in the bedside table, Jack had shifted on to his knees, laying himself bare for Sherlock to do with him as he pleased. Overwhelmed and unable to stop himself, Sherlock draped himself along Jack’s back, dragging his lips up the length of Jack’s neck, nipping at his jaw, and sucking one earlobe into his mouth. Biting down just hard enough make Jack whimper, Sherlock slowly reached down and started to circle Jack’s entrance with a single slicked finger. Jack had toyed with him, and Sherlock was just as capable of giving as good as he got. He wanted to be needed, he wanted to be wanted. He wanted Jack to beg for it, he wanted Jack to beg for him.
That, of all things, was what made Mycroft look away from him.  "Sherlock did say that she let him help after school in the clinic she worked at.  He also said that he liked playing in her garden."  He paused.  "He told me he loved her.  I thought he merely had a childhood crush."
The first thing that John noticed was the minimal furniture.  It wasn't a particularly large flat, so there wasn't really room for a lot of belongings, but all that was in the living area that bordered the kitchen was a couch, a throw rug, and a coffee table.  The kitchen had no microwave, or for that matter any other appliances; all that was there was a stove, refrigerator, and some cupboards.  The second thing was how clean it seemed.  If K really didn't live here, he still had to put some effort into cleaning the place.  Of course, if he really brought his victims to this place cleaning it would effectively remove most evidence.  Mrs. Murray shook her head in silent disapproval before leading them down the hall to the one bedroom.  It was also furnished minimally; there was only a king-size bed with no headboard or footboard tucked in the corner and a chest of drawers.  There wasn't even a bedside table with a lamp and a clock.  Sherlock strode up to the bed and bent over the covers, sniffing audibly.  "These sheets were recently washed," he said.  "Is there a laundry in this building?"
"Wanted to try something with some plumbing pipe.  Didn't work out right, though."  He sounded halfway muted.
They fell into silence for another fifteen minutes, until someone knocked on the door.  Sherlock flung himself off the sofa to get the door.  "I expected you," he said as soon as he opened it.  His body blocked the door from view, but John was almost certain who it was and was not surprised when Phillip and his father filed in.
"Lemonade, milk, orange juice, water, and ammonia.  I wanted to use bleach but me dad said that was taking it too far."
While the flu patients were a welcome distraction on Monday, by the end of Wednesday John was thoroughly tired of them. He wanted nothing more than to not think for the rest of the evening and prepare for tomorrow's visit with the Aherne family. Lestrade had got permission to have them interview Moira again and to tape the conversation, and had even provided a tape recorder from the Yard ("you'll have to give it right back, of course"). Since Sherlock had been so silent over the last few days, he figured this would be easy. John hadn't even seen any new experiments around the flat. When Sherlock's nose wasn't buried in the file, he was writing things down in a notebook John had never seen before. Of course, the bubble burst as soon as he got home and saw Sherlock bouncing like he usually did in the throes of a case. "John! Before the visit tomorrow I'd like to run some ideas by you." He sounded delighted.
"Have you actually heard what most people say about the case?  Almost everyone who's mentioned it to me or I've heard discussing it think she should get off."  She must have seen the shock all over his face, because she added: "You see, with a case like this, people start looking right away for the man.  They assume that if she really did it, she'd been doing it for a man, or because a man told her to.  There have been cases where the woman's confessed to doing it on her own and people still assume she's covering for a man."
"We should," Lestrade said.  He shuddered before saying, "God.  For some reason that's the thing that bothers me the most.  Working constantly with small children, like a parade of potential victims."
. Mary Boyle is blond, but Moira is strawberry blond (and her father has reddish-brown hair) because of their last name, taken from
"Hi," he replied.  Even at this distance John could see the contrast in his eye color; one dark, one pale.
As Harvey asked "Do you know why the social services people seemed so reluctant to return your daughter to you?" John wondered if the defense would call Dr. Arthur when their time came.  He'd be able to cloud the argument of who had abused Jennifer a bit, but he'd also have to admit he didn't bother to do any basic testing when Sagnik Malakar had come in to A&E.
"What?" John said in disbelief.  "How could he have done that?  He was only at that house once and he never even went inside."
"Our Mum wasn't much for a cuddle.  She was good to us but she didn't touch us a lot.  So when someone tells you to call Her Mum and wants to have a cuddle with you it seems good."  She paused, glanced at her brothers, and began again.  "I was twelve then.  Not much different than other girls.  Boy crazy."  She looked down at her hands.  "Anyway, She'd ask me about school every day and then two weeks in She asked if I'd kissed any boys yet.  Told Her I hadn't, and that was true.  Asked me then if I fancied any boys yet.  Course I did, seemed like that was all the other girls talked about.  So then She said when She was my age She'd kiss a pillow and pretend it was a boy.  And I said that isn't much like a person, and She asks me if I'd ever practiced.  I said no, and She said that when She was in school the girls all practiced with each other.  I knew some girls that did and said that.  So She leans over and kisses me.  On the lips, but not hard.  Asked me then if I liked it, and I said I did, because it wasn't bad really.  So I said it wasn't bad, kind of tingly.  Then I said that the shagging part was the one that sounded bad.  Couldn't see why anyone would like getting something like that stuck in you.  So She said that I just didn't know what the good part was like, and did I want to see.  And I did because I wonder why people seem to like that and we go up to Her room.  Then She tells me to take off my skirt and knickers and lie down."  There was a lengthy pause.
At that point, before he could do any more than process that information, his mobile rang.  He was almost glad for the distraction as he answered it.  "John," Lestrade said, businesslike.  "I was going to ring Sherlock but I figured you might be a little more rational about all this."
John almost wanted to tell him to stop talking. There was a note of anguish in his voice that he'd never heard coming from Mycroft before. Anyway, he doubted he would hear anything other than what he already suspected. He was as surprised as anyone else when he heard himself say, "Go on."
"Possibly, if I can get work for the branch there.  Otherwise no."  Mr. Aherne kept his voice level.
"Not a problem," John said.  The siblings followed Gloria to the door and left.  "When are you coming tomorrow?" he asked Lou and Susan.
"No.  I try to explain it but he just looks at me and keeps repeating the same things."  John swallowed down the new lump in his throat.  He hoped he wouldn't start crying.  While he was sure Ella had probably dealt with crying patients before, it still seemed worse than even the time he'd cried in front of Sherlock.
"No new news here," Eli said. "Her brother's staying with us for a few days - not any crisis in his family, he's just got work for a few days in London - and it's nice having him around. It's eerie how much they look alike."
"I wouldn't mind a piece. Thank you, you're very kind." John could now smell the faint scent of the chocolate bar. "You said you had an insect book the last time we talked. Can you show it to me?"
"I spent an hour trying to get a word out of that Aherne girl. An hour. I didn't even ask her any questions about why she was there, and still all I got was a few mumbled 'Yes' or 'No" answers. Wouldn't even look me in the eye. All you did was chat a bit and she spills her guts to you. If John couldn't even get her to say something, I would have assumed she'd have sent him" (here she gestured to Sherlock) "out of the room and cried for her dad. You're so hard-nosed most of the time. What happened?"
"Did he say anything about it himself?"  John doubted he had.  Dr. Arthur hadn't seemed like a particularly active reasoner.
By six in the morning, John figured there was no point in staying in bed anymore, so he got up and took a slightly-too-hot shower to force himself into a form of wakefulness.  Even with that he still felt blurred, out of focus.  A few cups of strong coffee would at least lessen that, so he made his way down to the kitchen.  He mentally thanked the person who had invented the coffee maker, since pressing a few buttons seemed to be all he felt up to doing.
Sherlock squeezed Hamish tighter as he said:  "When I was four years old my brother went to school..." and proceeded to tell the story he'd told John about when he'd met K.  Since John was in the front row for the first time, he could clearly see the buffalo's expressions; most of them looked shocked even though they'd been at the trial for every day John had been there.
They remained silent through the way out of the Yard and all of the cab ride home.  John only dared to break the silence once they were back in 221B.  "What did Phillip ask you about?"  He wasn't sure he'd actually get an answer, but still felt the need to ask.
"Or bathe in acid." Sherlock knew they both didn't literally mean what they said, but he knew the feeling.
"Actually, yes, I have.  I get another error message.  'This drive cannot be formatted.'  Since I'm not using it to run the computer that doesn't make any sense either."
"My sister's wife left her because of the drinking, so yeah, I know what that's like." He paused. "Can we use names here?" he asked, already having noticed that no one ever gave the name of the person they were there to support.
"Are you happy you finally got your man?  Is that it?  That one great mystery even you couldn't figure out got solved?"  Sherlock acted like he hadn't heard anything John said.  "Who did you think it was?"
"Sherlock wants a trial."  Suddenly something clicked in John's brain.  "Wait.  You feel guilty, don't you?  You thought the same as everyone else, that the person Sherlock was 'telling horrible lies' about was a man!  You knew that he was close to that neighbor but never considered it could be her!"
"Not to her, no.  She did give me a few names if I wanted to talk to someone else."  John paused before adding:  "I'm not going to make you go see anyone.  I know you wouldn't talk anyway.  This is just for me."
"Someone has to do it," she calmly replied.  "Doctor Watson, feel free to help yourself to the food."  She took two of the coffee cups and put one each in front of Lou and Lestrade.  "There's two more coffees and an extra cocoa if you'd like something to drink."
“No.  I kept my mouth shut most of the time.  The next time I saw Her She said She was sorry though.  It was a little better for a while after that.  I got to cuddle more and there were no kids or ropes or sticking things in me.”
"Yes.  He was working even during the summer and rarely came home, so I didn't know him at all.  Everyone said he was apparently a genius and was going to do big things in the world.  I saw him a few times and that's it.  I don't think we ever talked."
He resisted the urge to try to tear his penis off, somehow. This always happened. One trip to The Room and all his supposed inhibitions melted away. The Room was too comforting to abandon, but this...
The words didn't seem to cheer Mr. Aherne. "She said she doesn't know. Maybe she really doesn't know."
"Apparently there was an investigation of a serial child abuser, and Jennifer's case fit into the pattern of them, so they wanted to talk to me.  I told them everything I knew, which wasn't much."
"No, you would not.  However, that you would might be easier to convince the jury than someone like She would."  Sherlock's mouth formed a tight line.
"She had reportedly been in that flat and had a receipt in Her purse that gave Her real name.  At the very least it needed to be investigated."
"Sir Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle KStJ, DL (22 May 1859 – 7 July 1930) was a British writer best known for his detective fiction featuring the character Sherlock Holmes..."
"First of all, I didn't know that's how you felt.  If I had known at the time I wouldn't think it was funny."  John paused.  He hoped that Sherlock would have made some response, but when he got none he went on.  "Second, I wasn't thinking about 'how good you had it,' as you said.  There's a world of difference between what happened to you and my own experience."
Once the two of them were in a cab and on the way back home, the silence that had permeated the trip there returned.  Truthfully, John didn't have the slightest clue what he might say and was glad for it.  He didn't want to look at Sherlock at all.  If everything that he’d heard had disturbed him this much, he couldn't imagine what Sherlock must be feeling now.  When they got home, Sherlock went straight to his room and slammed the door shut.  John distracted himself by taking up an invitation from Mrs. Hudson to join her for dinner and a movie (she liked James Bond just as much as he did) and that was enough to put him in a better mood.  He didn't see Sherlock when he got back upstairs and went to bed in silence.
"There are a few good places right nearby. Chinese, Indian, fish and chips, sandwiches?" Truthfully, John rarely ate at most of the places in the area, since he usually picked up something on the way home if he hadn't bothered to bring something with him, but all of the places he was thinking of he had eaten at at least once and they were, if not gourmet, far better than cafeteria food.
“I don’t think you could have brought everything for something this complicated.”  Sherlock didn’t know why he’d said it, but he didn’t want to just sit there in silence.
The court was deathly silent.  John usually heard the buffalo whispering to each other on occasion, but now there was nothing at all.  When Susan said "What happened after that?" it echoed through the room.
After Judge Foster had seated himself and asked both parties if they were ready, Lou made his way up to the stand.  "The prosecution calls Phillip Rodgers."  An usher led Phillip up to the stand.  In fact, he was more leading him by the arm, as Phillip walked slowly, hesitantly.  He looked petrified.
"You have to come back home now.  Case."  John figured it would be best to skip the lecture for now.  Even a drugged Sherlock seemed to know what "case" meant; he got up (in a much quicker flurry of limbs than would be without the drugs) and headed towards the exit without another look back at John.  If he hadn't known Sherlock well and seen him move with much more grace, he wouldn't have been able to tell that Sherlock was currently somewhat high on something.
"Probably," Sherlock responded.  If he'd really spent the night on the street, and high to boot, he most likely hadn't slept at all.  With no drugs to fuel him now, he was going to be especially fatigued.  Even now his eyes were starting to close.  By the time John had showered and dressed, he'd fallen asleep again.
"Not on his own.  I asked him if he'd been having sex with that person too and he said he had."  Phillip visibly swallowed.
"Anyone who knew them from before they were taken into care say they had behavior problems?"  John asked.
"Oh, you like dogs?  Brilliant!  We can build the obstacle course!  I saw it on the telly!  They have poles and a tunnel and this bridge thing!"
John paused in mid-sip, surprised he'd brought the subject up on his own.  "Yes," he finally replied.
, he thought. He had once been so good at stopping his train of thought before getting to anything unpleasant.
"I couldn't see anyone at first.  Then the woman from before came into the room.  Then I realized I wasn't wearing any clothes."
Lou shook his head.  "The poor boy."  He reached into the bag and took out a wrapped sandwich.  "Will you be eating with us, John?"
"No.  I told him Her middle name, because I remembered it from all the times I'd visited Her at Bart's.  And I told him about the flat She took me to."
"The trial's over. As long as they don't name any of the victims or anyone whose identity might identify a victim, they're free to do as they like."
John took a look at it himself.  Victim One was Phillip Rodgers, Victim Two was Moira Aherne, Victim Three was Sherlock... He did a double take for Victim Four.  "Wait.  Is Jennifer Ogbeide-Bena going to testify at all?  She's so young."
"I'm going to leave in a minute."  He picked up his wallet and headed out the door, the clatter the keyboard made echoing behind him.
"I sat in A&E for a bit before I saw a doctor, and that made me feel a little better.  A doctor came in then and asked me what had happened.  I told him about the drink and the woman and the flat and how I felt, but he didn't really listen."
Sherlock took several steps backward, like John's comment had burned him.  "But I'm not normal!" he cried out.  That statement, of all things, made John realize that he was drunk, and had deliberately gotten himself drunk.  No other circumstance would make something like that come out.  "I'm never going to enjoy it!  Isn't it enough that I let you?  I figured that with enough wine in me it wouldn't be so bad, but it's not!  It would be worth it if it kept you here!  I know you want sex, need sex, because you're not a freak like me.  I can give that to you, I can kiss you, I can even just lie there and let you do whatever you want to me in bed, but you can't expect me to enjoy it and you can't expect me to want it, because I never will!"
"I don't need to be looked after." Mycroft had tried to look after him, and it had made things worse. He made himself stop before he got lost in those thoughts.
At that point, John did something that in retrospect was a very bad idea, but he was acting on instinct. He put his hand on Sherlock's shoulder in what he hoped was a comforting manner. It was like a switch had been turned. Sherlock froze in mid-rant. His entire body had a mannequin-like stiffness.
“No see, when I hold your wrist like this,” John explained, wrapping his hand around Sherlock’s thin – warm – wrist, “if you only move at the wrist, you’ll end up just hurting yourself more.”
I'm back home safe and sound, and I got a new phone. I did end up losing all my photos, but what can I do.
John’s knees gave out from under him, and it was only because of Lestrade’s quick reflexes that he managed to land on a chair and not the floor.
John frowned to himself as he listened to the conversation going on before him. Was getting a statement really DI Lestrade’s first priority? Sherlock – whose surname as Holmes apparently – had just undergone surgery, surely any statement could wait. Clearly detective inspectors with Scotland Yard were as bad as ex-army doctors, they couldn’t turn ‘the job’ off.
Or worse still, Sherlock may fear John incapable of keeping his feelings in check, and request John move out.
“Don't you see, Sherlock, don't you see? You're not what he wants.” Moriarty hissed. “He will never want you, not really.”
“Alright mate, listen, I’m going to give you some advice because I’ve been there. Sherlock is fun is short doses. You may think you’ve got something real going on now, but give him a month, and you’ll be pulling your hair out. You’ll be running for the hills. Trust me on that.”
This kiss, this kiss was… dear Jesus, how had he almost let nerves stop him from pursuing this? Sherlock would willingly spend the rest of his life kissing John, and being kissed by John. He let out a long, drawn out moan; a lifetime of John’s lips and tongue exploring his mouth didn’t seem like enough, it would never be enough. One hundred years, one hundred and twenty-five, one hundred and fifty years could pass, and he’d still never tire of John Watson’s mouth, of John Watson’s arms holding him, of John Watson’s body pressed against his, of John Watson.
“Good.” He nodded when the kiss eventually ended, some of his confidence restored. “Now that that’s settled, what are the plans for the rest of the day?”
The pint with Bill went about as well as he expected it would. Bill told him all about the redhead, her name was Gwen, she was in publishing, and she was as close to an angel on Earth as any human could be. He then proceeded to tease John about his little weekend in seclusion with ‘the dark haired stranger’. And, after listening to him complain, told John that the guy might have been an arsehole, but at least sleeping with him allowed John to
but really, John had never been surer of anything as he was of marrying Sherlock. He was so ready to be married to Sherlock Holmes.
The footage from around West Barlow Road had already been reviewed; His father assured Sherlock he sat next to the tech and watched the footage himself. According to Mr. Holmes, John was seen getting home a little after 11 pm, and no one was seen coming or leaving until Mr. Watson left for work the next morning at 7:30 am. All foot and vehicle traffic in the immediate area, were cleared as well. No suspicious stops or delays. But of course the captors weren’t seen, who did they think they were dealing with? John could never have been taken by amateurs.
Six months after their first meeting finds John chasing after Sherlock who, yet again, has taken off after a suspect. John turns the corner just in time to see the suspect, knife in hand, lunging at a cornered Sherlock. Next thing John knows, he has the suspect on the ground, hands pined behind his back, and John’s knee digging into his spine.
“He’d better be!” Harry laughed, and gave John a kiss on the cheek. “Now go on, get back to that dashing husband of yours.”
Everything was a haze, his vision blurred as his eyes tried to adjust and focus, his head groggy as it throbbed in pain, his limbs felt weak, barely able to move. Finally, after several minutes of opening and closing his eyes, John’s vision cleared and, struggling to sit up on his elbows, he was able to take in his surroundings, and fear took hold. He was in a cold, square room, though cement tomb would be a more apt description. Probably no more than 10 feet by 10 feet, the room was empty, save for the old twin mattress on which he was currently laying. Completely windowless, the only source of light was a harsh incandescent light bulb, recessed in the cold grey ceiling. Opposite John, and the only apparent means of escape, was a heavy looking metal door, a flap at floor level, and another about chest high. John was being held captive.
“Whatever you say. So should I just leave you be to get cracking at this ‘invaluable opportunity’ then?”
“You got me a present?” No one had ever given Sherlock a Christmas present before, no one other than family. Though he’d never had anyone in his life like John before, not really; and Victor didn’t count. “I don’t know what to say. I don’t have anything for you yet.”
There was a brief moment of silence as John seemed to consider… something, and then suddenly Sherlock felt John start shaking, devolving into a fit of giggles. It was contagious and Sherlock soon found himself joining John, laughing harder than he had in a long time.
“Yes, well we know that. But as you said, Mycroft is clearly a bit slow.” That seems to calm Sherlock down, and he was able to focus on the serial burglaries he was able to get them in on.
“That’s good, that’s good. Am I allowed to go back and see him, we do need to get a statement from him about what happened this afternoon.”
“They really didn't. Your watch did.” A small smile forming on Sherlock’s face. “It’s only about 5 years old, but the style is clearly more an older individual’s taste. So, it was a hand-me-down, most likely from a parent. You wear it, but it’s not well maintained. You want to honor the previous owner, but you’re a bit bitter about it. You loved the previous owner, but you think their death was avoidable. The fact that you look guilty about drinking a second beer, suggests a family history with alcohol you hope to escape.”
“Right… Sherlock Holmes.” John attempted to sit up slightly to properly address Sherlock, but Sherlock was having none of that, so John just resettled himself on Sherlock’s chest. “Will you do me the honor of being my plus one to an anniversary party I have to go to tomorrow night?”
“Oh dear,” John hummed, “I’m not sure I would be able to live with myself knowing that I’d prevented one of the greatest minds in generations from thinking.”
The wait for news was agony. Sherlock was confined to a wheelchair, the only way the hospital would allow him in the waiting room and not a hospital bed. His parents sat with him in silence, his mother never letting go of his hand. Mr. Watson paced. The police tried to get a statement from him, but aside from saying it was James Moriarty, Sherlock said nothing, unable to concentrate on anything other than John.
“Don’t be ridiculous, you’re not going to be homeless. You’re going to crash at mine.” John explained, as if that didn’t have its own host of problems. “You know the couch isn’t half bad, no worse than the school mattresses at least.” He added.
