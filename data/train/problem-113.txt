This was better than any drug. The thoughts of John and the overpowering euphoria that shot though his body with each stroke…It keep building , liquid fire in his veins. A twist his fist , the swipe of his thumb over the soft glands ...he couldn't hold back . The whole world disappeared into the fog of pleasure .  His chest was wet his belly and hand were sticky . It was all so good ..... . He is going to become  addicted.
Both Jo and Hansen were confused by this but simply did as they were told.   It wasn't long before Sherlock Holmes took over . He went over all of the files in a matter of 20 minutes and started demanding to see the body.
The sound of another punch and the ripping of clothing made John spring into action. He rounded the corner  and he felt his heart stop. "DON'T FUCKING MOVE !"he shouted making the group freeze .
He pulled his covers up ,  places his phone on the charger then snuggled down into his warm sheets...
He glances over to where Sherlock was still in his own little world good ...He feels sick with nerviness. God what has he gotten himself into? He has to make this quick. He  carefully he sets his mobile  up on the table.  He spreads his shaking legs , his heart pounding ..if Sherlock catches him he's never going to live this down...
He kissed Sherlock's beautiful cupid bow lips once more before he  placed both hands on Sherlock's legs and stood up. “I need to go take a shower and head to bed..might have had a bit too much to drink..”he said with a smile. He grabbed his mobile and headed to the loo maybe he read Sherlock wrong,  and made a very big mistake.
Sorry it's been a wile guys lord knows I been wanting to get back into it , but personal life have interfered with alot of my free time.
But it was short-lived he spun around and reached behind him feeling for the notes, just as expected he pulls a few off .
"Who the hell are you" The man asked his voice was like a snake hissing. He looked around the room and then down at the floor . "Dame " he groaned, his red eyes flicked over to a more human color , and pinned John with a stare.
‘Not a clue,’ he shook his head, ‘but the Lieutenant was adamant that we be on time. Whatever it is , it must be  important since she called us on our day off." He spat like the words burned his tongue.
John knew this was a bad idea...He could feel it. He knew he should talk to Mycroft about this first ...
" I'm not his boyfriend! " John said out of reflex. "Look , Sherlock he has a point .. We are so close , just one more step and I might be able to go home ."
Sherlock shakes his head. “ It is  not my blood. “ He points to Elizabeth sitting  on the ground with a rather nasty gash on her arm. “ It's hers… that thing sliced her.” John pulled Sherlock into his arms and kissed the top of his head . Everything  felt better when Sherlock was safe and in his arms. “ Good I'm happy your safe… “ John breathed his voice low and steady like a rumble of far off thunder .
John holds Sherlock's leg and presses his lips to the side of his lumbar spin.. John's other hand still tracing slow, lazy patterns on the same leg under his bottom and balls.
Dean's smile got broader  as he steered Sherlock back towards the car. " Hay Sam mind staying out here with Sherlock just  incase Crowley's goons show up?"
John freezes in his spot unable to look away form the lude display in front of him . Sure he was use to Sherlock's utter lack of boundaries but THIS is nothing compared to that.
"Don't hanging up "John rushed when he heard the sound of rustling "I need his help or someone who knows as much as he did ."
know better . This killer — whoever they are , are extremely good at what they do. A professional,  perhaps a surgeon or somebody with the same anatomical knowledge. It all made Henry almost giddy with Glee.
"John I don't want to hear about your boring extracurricular activities. I must have deleted whatever it is you are speaking of . Do go to bed John and don't waste  time with your dick in your hand . " --- Beep---
John groaned . No way was he going to let a teenager choose his clothing. He followed the young man inside and went straight to the shirts, found the first one that fit,  pulled the tag off slipped it on than scuffled over to Sherlock.
" I gave you the amount we discussed. It is not my problem if you suddenly need the money to please your brother. "
If  Mycroft seen him react Sherlock knew he  would never live it down or worse. He wouldn't be able to go to the USA with John.  So he keep his expression board  and made sure he looked further out the window away from his brother. " I don't have anything better to do."
Where did Elizabeth go? He knew he heard her scream . Sherlock wasn't moving . He stood petrified feet glued to the wilting  grass.
John raised an eyebrow but didn't hesitate or question what he meant. He took the phone and unlocked the screen . No password.
John could feel Sherlock’s laughter so close to him pure and warm, his eyes a  lit and his hair messy from sex....this was perfect. ..he could spend the rest of his life like this.....
They are lost in the moment just their breathing and the sounds of the world outside continued on despite the life slowly ending in front of Wilberforce's eyes.
John had to pull his arm away. " It's too hot for you to cling on me . "  Quickly John slid inside the car . " You two hurry up. " John grumbled at the brothers . Dean shot John a knowing smile " You can have the chains after we are done  . " he gave Sherlock a saucy wink before he and Sam disappeared inside .
He moaned at the overwhelming sensations. ..It was to much yet not enough...Johns hand was moving now sending unfamiliar pleasure though his body.... bitting his lips Sherlock angled his his hips, rubbing himself up and down Johns cock, teasing..testing ..feeling the heavy meat between his cheeks.
" They are friendly enough at least. " John shrugs and walks over to the sink " I thought they were going to start a fight there for a moment.  " he turns on the tap and washes his face . The water smelled like mildew but it was refreshing and  cool against his skin.
" We don't  do any of a physical or sexual  parts of the  relationship. Okay. But we do live together and spend most of our time together, we are not a couple in that way.  We are  the best of mates Sherlock. “
John groaned  and put his head on  cool leather seat in front of him.  Even Dean could see Sherlock's pinning . This was bad. He hoped to god this spell or whatever it is  works . He's not sure how much longer he can fend off this younger hormonal Sherlock's advances. It been a week well , six days and  if the boy gets anymore ideas ,( like the ice pop indecent ) John was going to explode. Years of pent up
" Sherlock ." Images of  two sets of Sherlock's eyes looking up at him with a mouth full of  his cock flashed though his head.
He felt his face heat up as John's eyes lingered ion his. Then John's eyes  followed the line of Sherlock's  neck to the open buttons of his shirt then  quickly they darted out the window .
John took his eyes off of Sherlock for a moment to regard the woman.  She was a pleasant blond woman with soft gray eyes . She had a nice face a few to many moles but it somehow worked for her. She was a bit overweight but that seem to work for her as well. He smiled "Well he's not new. I am, this is my first time seeing him dance. " his eyes drifted back to Sherlock he couldn't look away.  " I wanted to see him before I went home. "He spoke softly.
Their lips meet soon after toungs sliding tasting lickingm..teeth teasing and nipping ,lips sucking ,their breaths became tingled and erratic.
"Y  …yeah.... let's go home...."Maybe  if goes back home he will wake up and all of this will be a dream... If it is not a dream someone most likely heard the gunfire . It would be best not be here when the yard shows up....
Sam's lip pulled up into a boyish grin " It never really stuck. " Dean laughed and bumped  his brothers shoulder playfully.
Sherlock shifted his weight and smiled brightly "Yes I am . I had to fight Mycroft about it but since I am ahead of all of my classes and I can't dance.He has no other excuses . I'm better off going with you."
Sam sighed. " Calm down Dean we are outside. The guys from earlier invited us to eat . Come on out sleepyhead."
A startled breath leaves the doctors throat and he swats Sherlock hand away . " I'm fine." he  didn't mean to snap but he was starting to trudge in dangerous territory . This was not his Sherlock flirting with him...
John put his hand in his pocket and fiddled with the necklace unsure about letting such a strange man get his hands on it .
If she weren't a woman John would quite literally thrown her out. Ridiculous. How could he have been so blind!?
John chuckled softly and made his way  around the store .He was surprised at how -normal it was. He pictured a younger version of Sherlock dragging him to some posh clothing store where a shirt would cost more than his paycheck. This place was reasonably priced and had styles of all kinds. He found a few new jumpers and three nice pairs of jean trousers.   Since he was going to be here a few days he also picked up a few pajamas .
John jumps , the deep baritone purr floods over him. It feels like so long since he's heard that voice. The older of the two Sherlock's got to his knees next to  the  younger version of himself . Who blushed slightly and  smiled before  parting his lips to run his tongue along John's  calloused fingers still holding his chin.
Worry started to settle over his gut . When enough time passed and Sherlock still sat there eyes wide mind lost in thoughts.
" Don't be stupid John . " Sherlock’s baritone rumbles " I wouldn't miss this case.  It's easily  a nine . "
After the short drive from one side of the bridge to the other . They pulled up to the small blue building in the middle of nowhere. The impala  bounced  and grinded over and in pot holes the size of the grand canyon . The "parking lot " was more like a war zone of sink holes.  Dean parked the car ( when he found a place not riddled with holes)  and started cursing. "Son of a bitch . If there is one  scratch on my baby, because of this dame  drive way I'm going to murder someone !" Dean jumped out of the car, prowling around the vehicle like a overprotective   mother checking her child for cuts and bruises .
Nodding Wilberforce sucks in a long quiet breath for courage. The steps echo only three times on the wood floor before reaching the bed.
John sighs softly and nodded. He had a point.  "Alright I'll get them but I get to pick the rest of my clothing. I don't want to walk around all posh like you and your brother. " John could hear Sherlock's eyes rolling.
Tremors of sweet euphoria ripped though John "you bloody genius. ..god you're brilliant "he murmured into the ear so close to him....
"Really Dean " Sam  groans softly. The tall man crumpled  the paper into one little ball and tossed it at Dean's head . " Are you  in Elementary School?"  . Dean sat next  to his bother and smacked his  back " haha common Sammy that's what ya get for sleeping in. Hurry up you two . We got breakfast and coffee.  "
The girls flicks her hand around.  " it's not a stone jackass. We are after the Weeping angle itself. The other ingredients are to make the stone into flesh.  "
" Dey from were Toba'y is from , dat ‘ew Emlag' place up nor'h!" The black man ,Dion tosses his arms up and shouts as he walks over to meet them.
So my dear friends I wanted to say sorry for the few day delay I got sick on the plane . Thats why this chapter is a bit short and a bit late.  I took my vacation. You guys will never guess were- The USA!! This place is so much different then I thought it would be . Its beautiful I never knew it had mountains like this ! I thought it was all beaches and malls like in most of the vacation spots I looked up.
John remembers , on a cold January afternoon he and Sherlock where sitting watching telly when a the announcement was made for the legalization of  gay marriage had passed. Sherlock's mobile went off , as always the detective was too lazy to get up so John had to fetch it for him ..He will never forget  the words on that screen .
~” his thumb brushed at young Sherlock's lips.  His other hand falling to his older Sherlock's curls.
" I have no idea and I don't want to find out." Sam caught up to them not long after. He glanced over the scene and pointed to the far end of the Cemetery. " The kids are over there. "
Sherlocks small sharp teeth nipped playfully at  John's bottom lip then...Oh....he sucked into his mouth...
"Just to be safe " John clarified. "Your ankles still must be tender and we don't know if those men were found yet. So it's better to be safe than sorry. "
Dean wiped his hands took a sip of his beer then set it aside " Well a few things dealing with time travel. I wanted to ask how you got sent back in the first place . We didn't talk much over the phone "
Dean smiled from the driver seat . " Wait till you hear her purr. " And just as he said that the engine roared to life sending shivers down John's spine. He and Dean talked about this car and that , witch  car is better then the other - the conversation always came back to ."
Dean's foot never lifted from the gas going 80 down back roads 100 on highways.  " How the hell did the demons know we where there ? "
John just realized they spent the whole night out, and he's been away from home for an entire week. Sherlock must be going stir crazy trying to find him. It’s  alright he is going to be home soon. John smiles and looks over at this Sherlock who is talking to Sam. The boy was smiling brightly up at him making all kinds of fighting  gestures , Sherlock even had an angle blade in his hand acting like it is a sword.
"Ahgh who the hell are you old ma-ahggh-" John pulls his arm so far up his back the Wilks hand was almost touching his neck. It was bent very painfully and Sherlock was sure John was about to snap it off.
Today was no different . The body is perfect showing no signs of a struggle, not a hair or fiber out of place.  If he didn't know any better it would just look like it was a natural cause of death but Henry
Henry laughs again, giving into the urge he takes a few steps over to Sherlock and slowly he raises his hand to the detectives cheek “ Like immortality? ” Henry whispers.
John leaned down a bit placed his hands under Sherlock's bottom lifted the taller man up to his chest .
Sherlock let out a soft yelp as drips of the melting popsicle drop onto the  soft white skin of his chest. John hissed as he watches  the almost clear blue liquid seep over Sherlock's nipple. The pink flesh pebbled as the cool liquid danced over the sensitive flesh. Sherlock looks over at John and the little bastard smiles  and he takes another long lucid lick up the ice pop then finishes off by biting the thing in half.
Panic, fear , confusion fell over him...What? What was he going to do-?!....The sound of his heart was hammering in his ears the flush of adrenaline took over  his senses. He couldn't hear the voices speaking.
John clenched his fist . Should he tell this man everything ?It might be his only way home he don't want to put his faith in some voice on the other side of the phone....to some American man with no face.
."  No ...he won't ever get that from anyone. All people are the same. If it hadn't been for John last night he would most likely be in a hospital having  overdose and rape kit done.
"Seems Mycroft’s pet psychopath can't get me home yet . "His eyes dart down to the ground. "So we are gonna see what we can do ..If your brother can't do anything in  the next two days I'm going to America to meet someone that might be able to send me home and I wanted to know if you wanted to go  with me-"He rubbed the back of his neck and shifted his weight nervously " I know your busy  so its alright if you say no ."
"Glad you boys made it . I thought you might have bailed on me . " The girl gave Sam a playful smack on the arm. Then winked at John . " That would have broke my heart. "
Slowly he pressed their lips together. Sherlock  froze in his spot for a moment then relaxed into the chaset kiss...
Sam chuckles "well the bunker is heavily worded so no monsters are getting in here. If it makes you feel better -." he shrugs. "I'm sure you two are tried get some rest and we will get some food. Are you hungry?  "
He scrambles to his phone and out the kitchen not caring if the picture might be blurry. That was horrifying. ..yet exciting. ...thrilling and fun....Knowing that if  Sherlock would have  turned around and seen him spread out on the table using his science equipment as a prop sent a rush though him.
John followed  the  politician inside the busy building.  They walked past the busy front desk, back to a door with a strange symbol on it, six pointed oblong star circled by two thick lines. . John traced the mark with his eyes .  It was like something out of an occult book he read in high school.
Hansen nodded in agreement . " Most likely- " Once they entered  the office there is two men sitting in the chars in front of the lieutenants desk. She looked up and waved to the two gentlemen " Jo, Hansen. This- " she said waving her hand to a pale dark hair man " is Sherlock Holmes and his partner Doctor Watson. " she said with another wave of her hand. " -from England " she continued
Dean snorts " Start a fight from someone out of town yeah right. They might over feed you and talk your ear off, but they won't fight ya. " John plops down on the bed with a sigh and watches as Sam walks over to the sink ,wets a flannel with the cold tap then walks over to his exhausted brother. He then places the flannel on the back if Dean's neck. " You should rest a bit ...I will put up the  wording, and then we can take John to see that guy alright. I'm sure he doesn't mind waiting a few hours. " He murmured close to Dean's ear. Sam shoots John and pleading look. John sighs again " I thank we can all use some rest and air condition. " he smiles at Sam. Dean deflates slowly and walks to the other bed. " Alright but only two hours alright just two..." Sam nods. " alright just lay down Dean. "
The odd man wiped around and shook his head like he didn't just ask a personal question he shouldn't know anything about. " Iknow a man who might be able to help let me get his number. "
John looked up almost surprised to see Sherlock. Immediately  John's eyes softened he could fee all tension leaving his body .
Sherlock inwardly groaned he didn't want to deal with this after all  he been through in the past few hours... Quickly the small boy grabbed his bag and made a beeline around the other side of desks and out the opposite  door . It was a longer  walk home but he didn't want to deal with him.
John would miss looking down at Sherlock. He likes how short he is . He placed a hand on Sherlock's curls and ruffled them softly "Anytime mate. " He turned around got inside the car.
Sherlock looked over at him that little wrinkle forming in the spot where his nose meets his eyebrows.
When the gun clicked dryly and the bodies piled the floor. John felt air fill his lungs and the world came back into focus.
" You're telling me Castiel did that to you when he -" John trailed off unable to keep the disbelieve from his voice .
" God they're intoxicating  "  The doctor  murmured.  He can't stop this there is no way he could... It's to much- yet not enough.  He moved  his hand from  Sherlock's tangle of soft curls  down along the older Sherlock’s   cheek. His fingers  slipped to   his mouth and down to his chin where he  tilted Sherlock's face upward. John's  bobbing erection brushed against younger Sherlock's mouth .
John opened the phone and scrolled  through Mycroft's numbers. He sure did give up his  phone up easily. He must trust John or really feared what he might do. Once he found the  number he hit the call button.
So guy's I'm not sure if I want to end it here or not I have a few more ideas I want to try out .But I have Midterm s creeping up on me  in two days and need to focuses.
Pushing back again he  captured Johns cock in between his thighs. The tip dragged up against his balls, ripping  a harsh gasp out of him, and slid then it  slid away , feeling the heavy weight slip along his ass, past his hole, and back again.
Slowly Sherlock shrugged off his night gown John helped pull it off his shoulders mouths never parting. Tentatively John moved his hands down to the him of the other man's shirt...and lifted the fabric slowly.
"Lonely? You?" John was surprised at how even his voice was . " That's ridiculous." He huffed out a soft laugh.
The warmth of Sherlock skin under Henry  fingertips makes him tremble… This is really happening … He smiles softly.  “ He remembers how this perfect cupid bow lips felt against his. They were so warm with a fever. So dry from dehydration but so soft , kind and loving he wanted to feel them again. “ I can't believe you chose the name Sherlock Holmes. Wasn't he the character used to tell me about in the field we used to race in? “ Henry glanced into Sherlock kaleidoscope eyes then licked his lips then watched as Sherlock copied the movement.
"That's fine...it's all fine ...lube?" he asked letting go of his hair . Sherlock buried his face in his pillow and pointed to the night stand .
" What in  bloody God's name did this?" John bit out.  He raises his gun . He felt Dean's tension like it was tangible. His alertness and his focus made John's own heighten further.
He walked inside the large building . A small older woman with short ear-length silver hair greeted him with a friendly smile. "Hello Sr. Are you here to watch the class. ?"
"I see so... "He looked down at John's hand holding the necklace . There is something missing ...something  John could tell he was thinking " where's your cane ?..." John's brows knitt together
"Since the start. Your dance was beautiful. " Sherlock could hear the smile in his voice. "I don't know how this time travel thing works. If loose any of my memories . I hope I don't loss that one . I want to  I keep it.  I want your dance to be the only thing out of this crazy experience I remember . " John shifted foot to foot and rubbed the back of his neck.
But the darkness was settling in....He felt like all the monsters in his mind could bleed through his eyelids and creep into reality and gobble him up leaving  nothing left.
John smiled of course he would be taking music classes. Though , he would have thought Sherlock's parents would have got him a private tutor or something . When he turned around he came face to face with a black sedan ... He straightened his back and got into the car . This better be good news.
“When it melts, your ass will be flooded with my come, filled to the brim with it, so much so that the plug itself will be struggling to keep it inside.”
He hadn’t been able to do anything at the time, unfortunately. The nightclub had been filled to the brim with people and his contact hadn’t made a move yet.
“Sherloc-k,” John whines, reaching a trembling hand down to his thigh, pulling it outwards. His thigh muscles tremble with the effort, his body shaking as Sherlock growls. Clearly, the man is doing this in the hopes of further enlarging his passageway for Sherlock’s cock and tail, easing his way down instead of having the throbbing erection shoved roughly into him.
" Sorry I laid my  filthy hands on you and I will never touch or speak to you again . Because if I do John Watson is going to feed me my prick for lunch. ”
The room was crowded with  three groan men and Sherlock . There wasn't enough space stand comfortably . Sam had to duck so his head so he didn't  touch the low the ceiling.
" John Watson is not gay Miss Leeanna so leave your hope at the door. I’m sure your side man will be more then happy to indulged you in your fantasies. "
John walked into the room and closed the  door this was his only way. Young Mycroft seemed to trust this freakishly pale Russian so maybe the Mycroft in his time trusted him to . So he told him everything. Starting  with Mycroft's call then went on from there all about the tape the trip in the car. Everything.
"Bobby Singer.?" John repeated the name from memory. "You said I need to ask for his number if you can't get me home. "
It was too late the dark headed man spotted him "Hey freak !I need to talk to you !!."His deep voice  rumbled through the door after him. Sherlock picked up speed . He really didn't not want to deal with this.... Just a few more meters  and and can hide in the closet down the hall. No one but him seemed to know it was unlocked. It was his safe spot . He could see the hallway leading to the closet  door but it was to late he felt a strong hand on his shoulder push him . He stumbled forward clutching  his bag. He straightened up but didn't turn to the man . "What do you want  Wilkes .?"Sherlock said keeping his voice board.
The drive home felt like a drive home from a case in his time. He and Sherlock giggling inappropriately about his brother and the amount of uncharacteristic touching  and caring he showed the psychopath  who hissed at John.
Why did people always do this? They always want something from him...When they get it  they hurt him or call him names.  When he doesn't follow through or he  completely deny them they  do the same. He's tired of trying to connect with people. Why does it always  happen like this?
Now all that was left was the  stone of a weeping angle and  the one that made John a bit skeptical - It sounded so sexual.
Jo simply shrugged . " The lieutenant invited them. Just let them see the body Lucas." She sounded exhausted. Lucas wondered for brief moment how long she has been with these two. He groans and tosses his arms down like a little child ." Henry said he didn't want anyone to bother him   while he was examining the-" Sherlock pushed past the him with a dramatic flare that should only be used on television.
Sherlock took a soft breath in and closed his eyes .  He let his head fall to the doctors broad shoulder. Sherlock felt the other man tense up for a moment  but he relaxed almost immediately .Sherlock held back his smile .He felt John shift around for a moment before he put his arm around  Sherlock's back and pulled him closer to a more comfortable position. That made the young man smile. He is not  wrong from what he been deducing.....This man was his lover from the future.  Not to many people get to meet the person they  spend their life with twice.
John called his name . The boy didn't look back . Something wasn't settling right . A chill ran up John's spine. It wasn't the demons bodies he was dodging and  jumping over that chilled him to the bone . It felt like someone was following him ...not the brothers it was a different presence.
John slowly  examined Sherlock's bruised ankles checking for brakes. He found none.  John felt relief wash over him  he is sill wound up ,confused,angry   and  the   smell of blood and gun powered filled his nose. This is a nightmare .  A child like Sherlock covered in track marks and bruises? He needs to  wake  up.  All   he has  to do was get Sherlock home . Then he would wake up . That's how it worked right? Or maybe jumping off a building?
Even Lestrade is getting pissed off. 'I hate Anderson!' he rants, entering Sherlock's new room where he finds John. 'And Donovan, too!'
'He hasn't woken up since he got here,' John breaks the heavy silence. It had been his task to fill this Mycroft Holmes in with what they knew and he's gone through several lists and forms with him. 'It might tip into a coma.'
John takes the file and looks at the pictures. There are some suspects but none is an uncle. He only spots the word on the second page in some statement. 'Why did he kill the woman?'
'Don't be too proud to ask – ah – questions.' His sentence is interrupted by a gasp when John slides his fingers between Sherlock's cheeks until his fingertips find the rim and press gently at it. 'Wait, lube.'
'Stop being so smug, you were dreaming about … what was it at that time? Running after a killer with me? Defeating a monstrous dog with me? Being saved by me?' he teases.
'No, I want to hear you groan again,' John says without thinking. 'I want to know if you're loud during sex.'
Sherlock follows, grumbling to himself. Only when John asks him about new experiments, he lights up and begins to tell John about several of them. He explains it all in fast monologues while John sips his tea and the atmosphere is calm and comfortable.
The man is shaking, black curls sticking to his sweaty forehead. His breathing is rapid, far from normal. Just as John has assumed before checking, his heart is hammering very fast in his chest. Along his arm are several traces of injections, some fresh, others a day old and some mere scars. His face is pale, expression pained. It could be a pretty face, John thinks, the cheekbones and the philtrum could look quite attractive. To someone who liked men, that is. John isn't gay, and anyway it certainly does not matter now!
'You were amazing,' he says later as they sit in a pub. None of them has an alcoholic drink in front of them but John doesn't really miss it.
John doesn't really listen. He forgot his cane, he walked without like he did before the injury years ago. There is definitely something wrong with him today. Or right. (He feels good.)
John smiles, a little amused. 'My pleasure,' he says albeit not entirely understanding the bit about forgiving. Does that refer to the spilled water again? He steps closer and slides a hand to the back of Sherlock's head to lift it while he holds the glass to his lips. It's not the first time he feels the dark soft curls brushing over his fingers but everything has changed five minutes ago. Sherlock takes small sips.
'We got the cat.' He sighs. 'To be honest, I would rather have a dog. Well, we wouldn't have the time to walk it anyway, I guess.'
It's become cold. The streets are now filled with brown snow slush, the sky is grey and an icy rain starts and stops and starts again. People are rushing down the road. The tube is overly crowded. Everyone's cursing the weather, Christmas atmosphere won't really settle. Merely shop windows and the people in the ads are excessively joyful. In the restaurants and cafés, someone has at least tried to pretend the world really does consist of red and gold glitter. Some even have decorated trees. In Sherlock's room though, nothing even hints at the upcoming holiday season.
Yet, right now, he finds himself feeling as if he's drunken five energy drinks. Not my Sherlock, he thinks as he jumped up and rushes over to the bed (walking stick? What walking stick? What limp?). He checks the monitor again, then the tubes and everything. He's John Watson, he knows what to do.
Sherlock looks up to him and their eyes meet. Slowly, his lips curl into a smile and he chuckles, fully laughs then.
'You're mad at me,' Sherlock breaks it, voice quiet. When John glances over, he's fidgeting with the wet hospital gown.
'Well, waking up had its benefits, clearly,' John says and kisses him again. He can feel him smile against his lips.
Sherlock leads him around a building and there are police cars and yellow tape. Obviously, John shouldn't be excited about this but he can't help it. When Lestrade brought him case files, he imagined going with Sherlock to the cases. Lestrade said that Sherlock came several times before the coma.
Sherlock complains and grumbles to himself for at least another hour, then he tries to brainwash John. Halfway through an argument about fake moustaches, glasses, bow ties and French accents, he falls victim to the exhaustion. John checks, but it's normal sleep.
She steps away from him. 'No, I mean it. It’s heart-warming. You’ll do anything for him – and he doesn't even know you!'
In the late evening, they find out who he is: a tall white pinstripe-suited man with a black umbrella turns up and pretends to be very important, powerful and fearsome. Though John has caught him referring to someone on the phone as
Sherlock brushes his thumb over John's lips. 'Well, my mind made up some parts,' he says, 'I… obviously I don't know how you behave in situations where you're likely to die.' He sighs, then he leans forward and kisses John. 'I miss those times.'
John's ignored her and now pulls the door open. There are people in there indeed, another doctor, Anderson and two nurses. Oxygen is now artificially pumped into Sherlock's lungs, he's getting an injection and someone else is doing something else. A beep alarm is just being turned off as John enters but a look at the monitor is terrifying enough.
Just when they reach the platform, John phone chimes. Jeanette rolls her eyes but grins a little. Her mood is getting better since they headed off for an evening with nobody else but them.
But in the second coffee break on this Thursday afternoon, John is not in Sherlock's room. Instead, he's suffering the third time of
After two months, he does text Mycroft and gets a short reply stating Sherlock is doing well under the circumstances.
At about five o'clock in the morning, John fetches a coffee for himself and a tea for Sherlock. It's crazy how after a whole year, he was awake now and they were talking as if he always had been. Like friends. When Sherlock explained the case to him, John uttered a 'brilliant' and Sherlock smiled. John felt at ease talking to him, like before, but it was so much better now that Sherlock's eyes were open and focused on him. It was so much better now that he reacted and replied. Even if it were remarks like 'idiot' or 'stupid'. He said it in a fond tone, actually.
'I proved that, instead of murdering the victim, he was involved in a burglary at the different end of the city.'
Lestrade sits down in one of the chairs in the hallway, John next to him. 'That's…' He doesn't quite know what to say. 'Why wasn't I the best friend?' he asks then.
There isn't an MP3-Player, though. The music that fills the room comes from John's phone. It's a spontaneous act, really: on Christmas Eve, two weeks after the encounter with Mycroft, John's at work, but free to go in the late afternoon. He'd already got rid off the white doctor clothes and Jeanette had just arrived to fetch him. They were on their way down the corridor when John saw a familiar face walking up to him. There was a brief round of 'Hello's and 'Merry Christmas's, John introducing Detective Inspector Lestrade to Jeanette, and his lovely girlfriend Jeanette to Lestrade. Who was on the way to Sherlock, as it turned out.
John can't help a smile. He's thought about Sherlock's deep, rumbling voice. It's less hoarse now, than it was a year ago and the laugh is … it sounds nice. Frankly, it suits Sherlock much better than the emotionless expression he had during the weird sort of coma. When he leaves the hospital some day, maybe … maybe John could … experiment. In the past months, he's been wondering whether he might be attracted to men. Sherlock definitely is very attractive and people have teased John. He's not gay! Just … maybe … he might … like … Maybe when Sherlock leaves hospital, John should just ask him out. An experiment. Back in the army, he never really admitted to himself that he appreciated the fit forms of some of the other soldiers even though he knew it. In University times, he kissed men on parties when they played stupid games. John … might have liked it.
At home, John sends Mycroft a text, explaining what happened. He leaves out the fact he took Sherlock out on a date in a restaurant.
On a Tuesday evening, one of many, John is in Sherlock's room to write a few emails. The Wi-Fi connection is rather good here, that's the only reason, obviously. It's dark outside, Sherlock isn't moving, and John is sitting in a comfortable chair at the table, typing. The telly is on, because sometimes, it has to be. Even though he initially spent some free time here because of the silence, now and then, John can't bear it.
Sherlock doesn't give him a sarcastic answer but actually appears a bit nervous as well. 'John, well, you have been so nice to me. And after all this time and everything that happened, we're… you're my friend.'
She and John are standing at the end of Sherlock's bed, watching him breathe and do nothing. He's still the coma, but doing much better than before his “death”. During a call half an hour later Mycroft has told John that he'd brought his younger brother to a secret government whatever-John's-better-off-not-knowing-any-details place. There he had experts implant a new heart, a new liver and a new set of kidneys, as well as special medicine. The newest there was. John personally thinks Mycroft had scientists develop it just for Sherlock. Someone so close to death wouldn't have got new organs normally either, but Mycroft had easily got some from a criminal network in Serbia. After the biggest danger was over, the younger Holmes brother had still enjoyed special treatment for the past months but now, according to Mycroft, it was time to reunite him with a doctor who genuinely cares. 'Do I?' John had asked and snorted, to which Mycroft had laughed a little and said, 'Admit it, you missed him.' And so, John took care of Sherlock himself and was now standing there with Mary and looking at him.
It's easier to stick with the facts: Sherlock Holmes didn't die right away. They found out several of his organs were irrecoverably damaged. His brother managed to get him transferred to another hospital, not in London. John hasn't heard of Mycroft ever since, nor of Lestrade.
Sherlock swallows and opens his mouth, but then he just shrugs and looks to the window. 'No. Go ahead.'
John eventually calls Lestrade and tells him everything Sherlock says. Lestrade barely cares about the case.
'This man is dying,' someone behind John says and he turns to find another doctor there, standing next to Sally Donovan.
She stays with John when he and Mary break up. It's her who moves out after too many fights. Too many lies and faces from her past and it just didn't work out. John tells Sherlock how they talked again at the London Aquarium. She had liked being John's girlfriend, but they could both see that it was over. 'So, Mary's gone and I got to keep the cat,' he closes. 'Mary's kind of dead to me. Oh god, no, that sounds too dramatic.'
'It was fun in the beginning and then it became a matter of principle. I didn't think you'd get my bloody birth certificate,' John says, holding the damn thing up.
Mycroft Holmes straightens, picking up his umbrella and letting it swing slightly. 'Consulting Detective, that's what he calls himself. The only one in the world. He invented the job.' One last time he looks to his unconscious brother. 'Take good care of him, Doctor Watson. Please.' Then he leaves.
After drinking virgin cocktails in a bar (no alcohol for Mr Ex-Drug addict), John has walked Sherlock home to his expensive flat paid for by Mycroft. The flat is in a tall, modernised building with elevators and whatever you can wish for. Now, Sherlock lives alone and without a personal nurse anymore. He can walk short distances with crutches or by supporting himself on furniture but occasionally he still uses the wheelchair when he goes out. Not tonight, which is also why he leans against John in the elevator and why John supports him as they make a beeline for the couch. Sherlock's exhausted but he refuses to say anything about it.
But there aren't any flat lines. This isn't an American cliché film after all, this is Sherlock Holmes in a real coma with one computer by his side that showed one steady heartbeat line and several numbers and symbols. It's those. They are, just like the beeping sound, rather alarming and would have about the same effect as a double espresso on John.
Which started a discussion about Sherlock doing his own shopping and John not being his maid to run errands for him. Obviously, John agreed eventually and it earned him another thorough bout of snogging just when the doors to the elevator opened. They had to call it again minutes later and John grinned at Sherlock before the doors were closed. Sherlock had grinned back.
John can't help but smile back until he knows this moment of eye contact and stupid smiles has lasted too long so he clears his throat and glances around the room. 'You know,' he starts then and looks back at Sherlock, 'I'm very glad that you…' He clears his throat. 'Made it,' he says then and frowns at his sandwich. 'What I wanted to say, I'm of course glad about your current state but I also, uh, appreciate the fact you and I…' No, wait, “you and I” sounds wrong! 'That we are on good terms,' he closes eventually, feeling stupid.
Well. While Sherlock's blood levels seem to be on the way to getting better, his heart beat loses the steadiness it once possessed.
But he's afraid this derails into an awkward conversation about love and other things. Sherlock's certainly been in love with his version of John and John doesn't know if he is all that different in reality. Character wise, that is. It's strange to think that Sherlock might be deeply in love with him as he is.
'A good doctor would never do this,' he mutters while pulling the covers back and setting down a stack of clothing on the bed. 'No-one who's in their right mind would do this. You've clearly manipulated me. This is the stupidest thing I've done.'
Confident now, John thrusts faster, establishing a rhythm. Sherlock moans with every roll of John's hips.
'Gottle of geer,' someone in the telly chants. 'Gottle of geer. Gottle-' One of the nurses turns the telly off. At least, she doesn't have time right now to ask why the hell John was watching TV in a coma patient's room.
Now he does glance at John, the small smile gone. 'He's certainly not. Make a guess. What do you think he does?'
Sherlock groans in frustration and throws his head back. 'She's an idiot. You're an idiot. Sometimes you're worse than Anderson.'
He keeps looking at him, which might be a bit creepy if Sherlock wakes up, but he doesn't. The ads change to the film, but it's still muted so he doesn't notice. It's quiet and outside, it's getting dark. John shifts in his chair, half asleep and then he really dozes off.
Sherlock's piercing blue eyes fixate on him, like a predator looks at its prey. Or as if he's about to say
'Hey, they show that Victorian ghost detective film today, and Mary's at a friend's place over the weekend anyway, shall we watch it together? It's about this bride whose ghost rises again. Critics say it's surprising and clever.'
Sherlock obliges for once. He shuffles around a bit before getting comfortable next to John, snuggling up against him.
Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective, hasn't opened his eyes since he told John about the tattoo murder. John supposes he won't forget that moment, ever. He still remembers the deep voice and sometimes imagines Sherlock replying to what John tells him: little things from his everyday life, stuff he's read in the papers–like the mysterious death of that Connie Prince. Every once in a while, a certain DI from Scotland Yard dropped by. He talked to John and even told him a bit more about some cases of his. After he left, John proudly presented Sherlock his theory: 'The scratching on the Connie Prince's arms,' he said. 'And we saw the pictures of her brother with that cat in the telly, remember Sherlock?'
It's more difficult to stop thinking of all that. Even if all John's lost is a little habit, more of a ridiculous tradition really, it's difficult to be a doctor and to know that by now Sherlock must have died. John could get Mycroft's phone number probably, and just ask, but John knows what answer he is going to hear because he is a doctor, he has seen the reports and he knows. Though Anderson suddenly started to come up with ridiculous theories, like that Sherlock actually woke up and got some new organs. Or that the whole thing was faked.
'Lean back a bit or lie down,' Sherlock instructs. He has his knees on either of John's hips and lifts a bit, curling his long fingers around John's cock to position himself above it. Leaning on his arms, John watches, making a quiet sound when the tip of his erection slides against Sherlock's rim.
"So open for me," he grins as he sticks another finger in, plugging John up with great satisfaction before releasing him with great reluctance, carrying the tired man onto the bed, laying him down.
“You all right?” Sherlock hums, waiting till John nods before he drags the popsicle out slowly before shoving it roughly back in.
The last ridge of Sherlock's cock slips in, impaling John fully as the man screams, drool dripping copiously out of his mouth as Sherlock grins, licking it off his chin.
“Mmmm” John hums, chuckling as he rests a hand on the arm currently curled around his body, holding onto it tightly, "I like the sound of that"
"You were born for me, made for me, made to take this-" the tail inside his body twitches, curling around John's prostrate, giving a tight squeeze.
It’s not the first time that they’ve done this technically, John tends to relish the connection he has with the demon, purposefully trying to make him jealous as often as he can. And more often than not, the reason being to get a nice fuck out of it.
John closes his eyes, still sucking as he feels a weight settle at the foot of the bed, listening as the crackle of ice resounds across the room.
John cries out in response, tears streaming down his face as his cock spurts, his hole clenching around Sherlock's cock as come hits John directly on the cheek, trickling down his chin.
John cries out once again, his throat hoarse from abuse as he comes, a trickle of come dripping down his cock as his balls empty, draining him dry.
“Wonderful,” Sherlock chuckles, pushing the hair on John’s forehead back, watching as John hollows out his cheeks and sucks. “Now for the second part.”
Sherlock has his hand on his stomach throughout all of this, his guiding hand grounding him throughout the whole thing and John swears that he can feel himself distending around Sherlock’s fingers.
John yelps in surprise as Sherlock thrusts upwards once again, the ridges on his cock stretching the man’s whole further as John wriggles in his arms, his mouth now open in a silent scream.
"Yes, YOU CAN! You filthy SLUT!" Sherlock gives a violent shove, thrusting firmly upwards as John's cries, puffs of warm breath ghosting across Sherlock's lips as he grabs John's thighs, forcing them back down. Sherlock's cock drops an inch as John wails.
"I'll just leave it in there," Sherlock smiles, stuffing his cock back inside the man with a wet “squelch”, come pulsing out of the man’s hole as Sherlock’s cock slips in to take its place.
John listens in silence, his ears twitching as the sound of crackling ice pervades the room. He sighs, relaxing back into his restraints as the soft shuffling of footsteps grows louder and louder.
John shudders as Sherlock picks up the pace, his movements getting rougher till he begins to purposefully seek out John’s prostrate, hitting it dead on once, twice… thrice.
“I used a plug as a base,” Sherlock smiles, stalking over to John’s front and giving him a sly smile, watching as his lover continues to suck obediently on the popsicle enclosed between his lips. “It’ll keep everything inside.”
"All of it and so much more-" he breathes, sinking his head down onto John's shoulder as his tail breaches the sphincter, the tip slipping inside as John cries out, arching upwards in Sherlock's arms, only serving to impale himself further on Sherlock's cock.
And of course, John had chosen the interim to flirt with other random human beings. What should he have expected?
There’s something, far larger than the butt plug, nudging at his entrance… and John has an idea of what that is.
"Sherlock,” he whispers, nuzzling into his partner’s neck, Sherlock licking a long line up his cheek in response, “That was amazin- GOD”
"God John, you're so open," he whispers, his index finger somehow not even touching the walls of the man's passageway as the muscles there convulse.
"You filthy slut, look how you cry, wanting so much more of my cock," Sherlock snarls into John's ear as he picks the man up by his sides, thrusting him downwards as the man wails.
He drags a long nail down John’s throat, drawing blood as John gasps, flinching in response to the pain.
“You’re going to be so full John,” Sherlock continues, stuffing the popsicle further into John’s mouth, “Just wait till you see what I’m about to do to you.”
“Fff sherl-” John groans as he comes, his hips bucking down into the bedsheet as Sherlock steadies him, holding onto his hip with a vice-like grip.
Sherlock waits till John has composed himself before shoving what remains of the popsicle all the way back in, sealing his entrance and John groans at the relief.
John did just that.  The picture of his home..The wall paper filled with bullet holes , The ugly yellow smiley face , the warm fire place ,the skull...Sherlock....he smiled . His Sherlock sleeping on the sofa cradling his villon like a child would his teddy. That's where he wanted to go right back to that moment . He did promise Sherlock he would be back. "Alright I'm ready "He spoke softly.
Sherlock moved his hand's up to John's shoulders. He rubbed  the tout muscle there  enjoying the broad shape the twisted wound on John's left shoulder . "C...can I….?”
Dean smiles and holds out his hand in greeting " Oh us? We are from Maine . " The lie came out smoothly . " But my friends here are from England"
Sherlock rolled the salty flavor on his tongue before diving down again taking the very tip between his lips.
John keeps his head low ,clears his throat as he  glances at the detective. No response ....His sharp blue gray green eyes still glued to the screen of his phone .
" Sorry Dean but I have to agree with your brother.  The trip seems like the best way to go." Sherlock said mildly.
Sherlock felt his whole body tingle. The older man's demeanor changed from worried doctor into a beautiful perfect military Soldier . His blood boiled and he felt it rush to his face .
Khoung handed John the necklace. "If I can recreate the moment you were sent back. We might be able to get you home but not until I know what's missing. Tell me .... Do you remember anything prior to time travel . "
John had never seen anything so beautiful. He has never heard anything more enchanting than the sound of Sherlock's genuine laugh.
Oh no...no..no no...!! he flipped through his messages and again. ...He sent the pictures to ....oh god.....
John may be a short man but he seemed much larger . "I will break every bone in his bloody body. Do you understand stand me. I am not his toy nor am I yours. I don't mind helping your brother. I would give my life for him but this is different you understand me . This changes everything. Demons, angels , time travel and whoever the bloody  fuck Men of Letters are and you. Can all suck my arse . I'm going home!  If I can't  get home I'm going to kick your bloody arse understand ? "He slammed Mycroft's back against the wall  again and stormed past him "I will take what ever risks are necessary to get home back to Sherlock. You started this mess Mycroft's. .I'm going to end it. I will be in the car."
He tries to force out a nod, shaking his head in a daze as Sherlock chuckles, moving to sit on the bed along with a tray of… something.
"You didn’t have to flirt with that man you know,” he croons into John’s ear, his forked tongue flicking the reddened shell of his ear, “But you did it all the same… You knew what you were getting into… and yet-”
“So full,” Sherlock chuckles darkly, beginning to piston the popsicle in and out of John’s ass, “So full just for me.”
Hot come gushes out of John's hole, nothing there to stopper it now and John cries out in shock as Sherlock grins, wiping his hand through the mess as he sticks a finger into the goo, pressing it back into John's anus.
John gives a muffled cry in answer, his lips still full of the first popsicle which still seems to have a long way to go before it melts completely.
“You’re mine you know,” Sherlock whispers, nuzzling into John’s neck as he sinks his fangs into the already teeth-marked skin there, John groaning in response, “Mine to kiss, fuck and breed. If you thought I’d be letting you off easily...”
He feels the butt plug in his arse being extracted, his hole suddenly feeling ten times empty than what it had been before. John keens in answer, begging Sherlock to put something- anything back in there and… oh
Whining in answer, John instinctively grinds back down on Sherlock’s cock, shifting his arse till he’s fully seated on the demon’s balls.
He bites down on John's shoulder as he comes, prompting a sharp intake of breath from the man as he spurts inside of him, warm come filling the man's fluttering hole as John yelps, burying his face into Sherlock's neck.
Sherlock watches as John closes his eyes, grinning as he curls up against the shorter man’s back, aligning his hips with his before taking his cock in hand. He positions the head near the human’s anus once again, pressing it in roughly and listening as John gasps in surprise.
John’s eyelids droop as he nods, still high on the endorphins from his orgasm as he continues to suck on the popsicle between his lips, come dripping slowly down his throat.
“I'm not done with you. Not yet,” he finishes, thrusting up into the warmth of John’s body, seating himself as deeply as possible before lifting John up by the arms, pulling him off his cock before slamming his body down once again.
"Well in that case… how about… I leave it in there till I get hard again and fuck you?” Sherlock growls, his chest rumbling happily, “Does that sound good to you?”
He moans as the smooth tip slips past his sphincter, his muscles fluttering around the intrusion as he takes deep breaths, willing his muscles to relax as the popsicle slips all the way in.
“Well then, open wide,” Sherlock smiles and John responds accordingly, his lips widening as Sherlock slips something in. It’s cold and hard, a nice, long cylindrical shape with a huge circumference and… oh
“You’re wrong,” Sherlock murmurs into John's ear as he reaches another tail towards John's red-rimmed sphincter. It slips in easily, slick with slime and John howls, throwing his head back as his cock engorges once again, filling out in Sherlock's hand as the man toys with it, pulling down sharply on his balls and John screams.
John breathes a sigh of relief, his body shaking as Sherlock presses up closer to him, his come-soaked tails curling around John’s torso, marking him with the white sticky substance, Sherlock only stopping till the front of the man’s entire torso is slick with it.
“Full?” Sherlock helpfully supplants as he gives another sharp thrust, rocking John’s body up against his own, eliciting one final groan from the human.
“You’ve been so good for me… so good to me,” Sherlock murmurs, reaching a hand down to John’s chin, tilting it upwards with his index finger.
John turns his head instinctively at the sound, his neck curving as the rest of his body pulls and tugs against the restraints that have him affixed to the bed.
“I have more popsicles you know,” Sherlock continues, almost nonchalantly, “We can do this as many times as you want… well until they all run out of course. How do you like the sound of that?”
He smiles, reaching a finger down to feel the spot where John’s sphincter is still clenched around him as he pulls out, feeling each ridge of his cock bump against the man’s exposed skin till his cock slips free.
John’s eyes flutter close as Sherlock's cock goes flaccid inside him, his cock shrinking to a manageable size, John groaning at the sensation. But even flaccid, it’s still tight enough to stretch John open, his sphincter still engorged and puckered as Sherlock pulls out his tails.
“Yes,” the man whines, pawing at the sheets of the bed as he curls back into Sherlock’s body, rubbing his arse cheeks back down on Sherlock’s pubic hair.
“I’ve been planning this for ages,” Sherlock grins, wiping the sweat of John’s brow who shudders, suddenly hit with the realisation that Sherlock has basically just presented him with a popsicle of his frozen come.
'Whatever you want, John,' Sherlock cuts him off. 'I can bottom, I like either way.' He's put a condom on himself, too, and crawls over John. 'We don't need to do anything involving penetration but god, I want you inside me,' he murmurs and leans down to kiss at John's neck.
'Oh and did you know about those serial suicides? Was in the papers last week.' Obviously, Sherlock's eyes are closed (and he doesn't listen anyway), but John still holds up the newspaper. 'They've solved it, finally.' He smiles a little. 'Bit slow without you, hm?'
Instantly, Sherlock stops. 'I was just… it's just your shirt. We don't need to go further tonight,' Sherlock says after breaking away from the kiss. He's visibly nervous now.
Soon after, Sherlock is put in a wheelchair, now wearing a coat and a scarf. It was John's idea to gel back his hair and Sherlock suggests glasses and a small fake moustache. He says something about John not having recognised him like that the last time and while he gets that it's a joke he doesn't understand it at all. He doesn't agree to steal glasses, hair product and eyeliner either. Well, he borrows it instead.
Sherlock shakes his head, gripping John's shoulder as he moves forward and carefully let's his hands wander over the dead man's chest. 'I want your medical opinion,' Sherlock whispers back and then gives John all the information he has. 'So? What would you say?'
Luckily, though, officially they remain just that because nobody notices when they get back and Sherlock gets back into bed. Mycroft stops by again that evening just when Sherlock is being transferred to another room in a different part of the hospital. He's awake but drowsy from the medicine they just gave him. While Mycroft and John have a little talk in the cafeteria, John feels like Mycroft is looking right into his brain again, much like his brother does but with Sherlock, John feels more comfortable.
'I love you, John,' Sherlock says quietly, like he often does at random moments now. Sometimes he taps it out in Morse code, on the tabletop, on John's skin or on his phone when it's on standby.
This kiss is less tender and more demanding than the previous one. John wants to show off his best skills and Sherlock's clearly enjoying himself. One of John's hands is on the small of Sherlock's back so he slides it further down until he can cup his arse. Sherlock pushes into the touch and slips a hand under John's shirt at his waist.
John doesn't listen to him and lets the weeks and months pass. Maybe (probably) it's good that he spends less of his free time in the hospital. John has met someone.
'I’m his doctor, let me come through,' he mumbles frantically and reaches the bed. 'Let me come through, please. No, he’s my patient. He’s mine. Please.'
'This conversation has become insufferable,' Sherlock says and runs his eyes all over John. He makes a thoughtful face, biting his lips a bit. 'Speaking about naked people,' he says, 'you've seen me naked before and I think that's unfair.'
Grinning ridiculously widely, John leaves the dishes in the sink and takes his jacket. He grabs his keys and wallet.
In the real world, John's there, as usual. And Sherlock doesn't move. Nothing happens at all. The crime novel he's reading (out loud) is exciting though. In the end he goes back home late, very late. John
The next day, when he comes for the usual talk, conversation starter prepared, Sherlock's asleep and John allows himself to look at him like he used to when Sherlock was in the coma.
Sherlock looks up now, then he moves and does exactly what John's describing. Ever so slowly, he's pushing his groin against John's, watching him.
At this moment, John loses all hesitancy and nervousness. It has been pretty predictable so far, yes. He feels more relaxed now though. They're going to get somewhere tonight, kissing or further and it will be fine.
When he glances up, Sherlock's smiling. 'You were being so nice to me that I didn't realise for a whole week that we're not actually best friends that have saved each other's lives multiple times.'
'So hard to please,' John teases, threading his fingers through the dark curls. He feels like he wants to touch and kiss every part of Sherlock's body.
'I'm your doctor.' But he realises he likes Sherlock calling him a friend. John has often thought that when Sherlock wakes up, he'd just stalk out of the room. It's undeniable that he means something to John, but he'd always thought that it wasn't like this the other way around, even if he'd pretended things to be different. John clears his throat. 'Detective Inspector Lestrade.'
Sherlock  somehow  managed to get his tall body to lay upside down in his leather chair . His feet in the air his head on the floor, his pale hands were steeped under his chin .
"Yup...I'm sure Sherlock's brother will get him once I return home...So... Ah- is this my room? " he ask when they stop outside a door with the number
Sherlock slipped further down on  his knees slowly he wrapped his long pale fingers in the loops of John's trousers and tugged them down his legs , taking John's  red pants with them. He reaches out gripping John's thick member with cool hands. Slowly he started itching his Cupid bow  lips  toward the swollen head .  John sucked in a breath his whole body a live wire sparking and bouncing with anticipation.
The older man wasn't  going to last much longer like this.....Sherlock's cupid bow lips were the perfect heart shape around his cock...his eyes were hypnotic. ...just tiny sliver of silver peeking behind the black of his pupils like an eclipse.
The first ring  ,then the second and the third Dean started to pace after the fourth, then the fifth . His heart started to beat frantically. " Common Sammy pick up." Finally, after the sixth ring the line came to life and his brothers voice echoed through the speaker like a song.
This I thank is the longest chapter I have written so far . Well beside the chapters I smashed together in a few of my earlier chapter's I hope you enjoy.
Dance ? He smiled to himself. It was probably some kind of ball room or waltz type thing. At least that cleared up why he was here. Music was something that John always figured Sherlock learned as a young boy anyway not in Uni. He walked up the steps to Sherlock's building . Now that he thought of it he didn't know what room the boy was in....Oh well won't hurt to ask.
Sam turned around in his seat and read it out loud for Dean " Don't blink?" His brow knitted together. " What does that mean? "
Once he was out in the main room he flopped down on his sofa with a sigh. He watched the blonde man move about in the dorms small kitchen like this was his own flat. The doctor: John came at just the right time last night . If he never showed up Sherlock knew he would be waking up on that filthy floor with more than a few bruises and a sprain ankle. He had his very own solder . A protector who pulled him out of the flames of hell .  He felt his heart clinch and a smile crossed his face .
John pinches the bridge of his nose this is a lot to take in. It seems there is more to the world he lives in then he could have imagined . He takes a deep breath. John  looked out the window again . "Just take me to the airport . I know you contacted Bobby's friends ."He looked over at Sherlock with hopeful eyes "You're coming to right?"
“ I'm not sure , I recited the incantation exactly maybe ...It has to be read by a human ...or an Angle Sr. “ Khoung  pulled his hand away from John as if it burnt him “I'm sorry , I am no help .I will try to find another way.  Maybe if you  recite them after me and hold the man's hand. "Khoung nodded to John “He said your future self was the one who sent him.  Maybe you can do the same boss."
"Wait -! Did you say a demon?? " Sherlock yelp bewildered at how John was so nonchalant about it. " You didn't make the deal did you!??" The boy asked panicked.
John walked over to him and helped the small boy to his feet " What ? " he asked genuinely confused.
- whatever the hell he feels for Sherlock will come to a boil at any point. Just one little ice pop made John go mad  with images that should be illegal and here in the states ARE illegal. It don't help that in his dream his Sherlock gave his  younger self permission to suc-
Sherlock slouched deeper into his sofa and crossed his arms tighter . "I don't want to repay him Mycroft I'm not that sentimental.  "He huffed dramatically.  Of  course Mycroft wouldn't let John stay. There is no point in arguing. Sherlock could  just go visit him at his room anyway.
" What else did the future Mycroft do to send you back?" The red and black man approached him necklace in hand . "Obviously we are missing something . I need to know the events leading up to the time you were sent back. "He gave him a look and john gets that feeling like he knows this man again...John bit his lip ....Should he tell him about that night? Should he tell him about Mycroft’s random  call ? The tape ?...Sherlock's rape and how he was sent back to stop it?
...He turned his head it was too dark. No one was going to save him now . He got himself into this mess . His curse to read people and the inability to know when to stop talking has always landed him in bad situations but this....
A voice ? ...It's the same voice calling his name...Somewhere far away but ....it was coming closer...
Sherlock shook his head and held up five of his fingers " A five is a  werewolf or vampire. "he dropped  his thumb down " four is shifter, ghoul,  or Rougarou.  " he put another finger down"Threes and below are normal people.  "
John opened the box and read through the list again.  Everything seemed  to be there, the salt , chalk , paint to draw with, bags of herbs , a vial of dark  liquid, John hopped wasn't blood a  few candles and other things he did not recognize.
Another fist , this time to his side Sherlock fell to the floor his ankles giving out . He  groaned softly . "I don't have what you want Wilkes . I ran into a problem last night. You didn't give them the right amount."
Slowly he leans forward   looking into Pitts swollen ever changing eyes ,  their bodies are so close he can feel Pitt's fever - slowly Wilberforse leans his forward and rests his forehead against  his. They both glace at the door again  only braking eye contact for a moment. Wilberforce returned his  gaze . It is intense, he can see Pitt's fear . They knew for so long that they both wanted this...But the consequences where always too dangerous to risk… Now… they are both aware of the lack of time they had left together…… Pitt glances down at Wilberforce's lips.
Soon they had a paste in the bole ready to go .  Elizabeth nodded to the angel . “ Rub it on its neck.  The stone will turn to flesh, but be quick it will only last  for three or four seconds. The moment you see flesh slice it with your angle blade  and get as much as you can.”
John huffs and goes down to the bathroom . He fills the tub up with  bubbles and suds. . He gets undressed and sinks into the hot water . The water  sloshes  over the edges onto the floor  . He leans over ,sets his phone across from the bathtub sets the timer on his camera. He poses making sure the suds were just covering his bits. Barely . He ran the bubbles down his chest and though his short blond hair. He waits the few seconds before the camera takes the picture. He dries his hands off with a near by flannel and sends it.
Wilberforce feels his heart breaking in his chest as his friends words find their way into his ears he knows the pain is visible on his face but he can't hide it…. This man has done something for him no one in the world could have ever possibly done, and he did it just for him. He helped stop the slave trade.
"Hello what can I get you to drink sweetie ?" She  licked her red lips and smiled at John tossing her long dark curls over her shoulder.
"Wait" John protested, this Sherlock was just like the one in his time. "My jumpers are not goofy they're  comfortable.  "He pauses outside the door. He didn't  pull his arm from the younger man's grip . He just stopped him from walking inside .  "Maybe I should wait out here until you get me a shirt.  Just grab anything and I'll finish my shopping.  "
John shut the kettle off and looked over at Sherlock.... "I will be right back ..." he mumbled to the sleeping detective .
Sherlock you are a  thinker and an observer; you have an incredible ability to notice and draw deductions from seemingly trivial details . You use this tool for solving crimes . You also often utilizes your mind palace for remembering the smallest of details and organizing your memories in visual ways. However, your unusual and somewhat anti-social personality has led to many in the official police force to disliking you though, I'm guessing they just don't like you now because you are still a kid." he teases.
Leeanna's face dropped her eyes glossing over in mock tears , “John, he's lying, he just want's to keep you all to himself!”
John walked them out to the main road and like he predicted this part of town was dead . He couldn't get a cab even if he wanted to .The walk was silent the only time they spoke was when Sherlock told him to turn this way or that . With no surprise he cut out half of the journey  by taking back roads and going through people's yards. Within ten minutes they came up to the dorms from the back and John snuck quietly up to Sherlocks flat.
He can’t help but stare. Sherlock laid before him ,bent over ready for him .  With his free hand John pulled Sherlock trousers down to his knees . He saw the young man flinch and bury his face even further into the fabric of his pillow.
Dean skulked  around the car three more times touching various spots on the Impalas slick black frame before he was satisfied.
It made the politician sneer.Anger and pain filled his belly until it felt like he might exploded . How could he have never known about this ? His nose curled up and he had to turn away from the screen .His little brother....was gang raped. He grabbed the remote and shut off the screen. With a painful sigh he leaned back in his leather recliner and pinched the bridge of his nose. He had to stop this .....
John melted into the soft white leather seat with a sigh and closed his eyes for a moment.  Just to breath take it all in. One thought at a time .
"What the 'ell do you think you are doing !!" Johns voice rang in his ears. "You touch him again I will break your arm off and feed it to you . "He twisted Sebastian's arm back behind his back pulling until the man cried out in pain .
Constantly on repeat. Hurt. Abuse.  Name calling they use and beat him. Why can't anyone  be kind to him?
Sherlock and John look at each other as they toss their things on the bed . Sherlock smiled inwardly.
“Yeah. Do you happen to have air condition?” He didn't want to be rude, but the air from the open windows  feels like he is sitting in a miserable stagnated , fishy sauna.
Somehow the further into the graveyard they went the darker it got. Sherlock and the girls pleas faded into that darkness. John's legs were burning . How long has he been running?
"Maybe it was Cas after little platoon  punched him in the face-" Dean joked and Sam playfully slapped his bother shoulder .
John so blatantly put on display for someone else. .... They didn't deserve to look at something so beautiful. ... He didn't either, but he was John's best friend.. ..
The man under his brother shot up pushing Sherlock over with ease . Sherlock let out a yelped .   His ice blue eyes darting up to his brother .
" This moron walked right up to that poor man and  asked him if he had ,and I quote ' some fun time chains for my boy-toy here."
John ruffled his curls "Good morning sleeping beauty.  Have a good nap?" the older man  teased playfully . He quickly walked to the exit. " Come on Sherlock . " Sherlock frowned-  Is he in that much of a hurry? Sherlock sat a moment to take in John's reaction.
The throbbing calls to him. He lowers a hand down between his legs and gives his aching member a slight squeeze.  A  grunt escapes John's  lips. God..hes so close.... Just a few strokes he could finish  He glanced up at the door. Any one could come in....he felt a pulse between his legs. No way he can ignore it. Quickly  he shucks down his trousers, shoves his hand down into his pants .He was already so wet.
"H-w bout yu boyz joian   yuu friendz and have som crawfish-" Wild Bill grabbed both Sam and Dean's shoulders and herded them over to a row of long tables set up with plastic tablecloths hanging over to the ground . There was a huge lump  of red steaming crawfish piled up so high Dean could  barely see Sherlock's curls on the other end   of the table. the crawfish wasn't the only thing on the tables  ribs ,burgers, boiled onions , sausages and a few things in pots he couldn't identify  were also stacked on as well. The spices that puffed up from the food made Dean's eyes water.
The drive seemed to have taken forever but in reality it was only a few minutes. The moment the car stopped John got out quickly . "Right here!" John called to the men slowly following him.  John glanced over at the building ...No police tape . Not even a single speck of dust changed since he been here....Good no one found the bodies yet. Maybe he should tell Mycroft .
John's never heard Sherlock sound so….broken. At first the poor detective looked as if he had seen a ghost. John was curious . Sherlock  had to know that man. Was he somebody who worked for Mycroft?
Sherlock raised an eyebrow he to had a shot of brandy but not nearly as much as John . He knew they were both  lightweights when it came to alcohol. He lifted his head from his chair across from John “Oh? From what?”
They stopped outside of Sherlock's school building.  "I will let you know when Khoung has finished with your necklace. I am aware you would like to say goodbye to my brother before you go." It wasn't a question.
He did as the instructions stated , he salted the door ,the baloney door ,the windows looking out at London . He was glad for the hard wood floors in the room when he started drawing  it will be much easier to wash up if all of this was a terrible joke. He put the bowl right outside of the strange star he painted and started putting the odd  ingredients inside ....
" Wha! No way. You boyzwanna hav some craw'fish. " Dion smacked Sam on the shoulder " We cookn dem up right naw-" Sam shrinks away from the man's touch and steps closer to Dean.
"I will be home in a few hours . I only have two classes today...There is food on the ice box  and you have Mycroft's card if you want take out. " Sherlock mumbled as he scurried up the steps quickly and vanished into the building. John didn't have time to say anything ,not even a “ have a nice day “. He just shook his head and looked around. He took a deep breath of cool London air. This  was a nice part of campus .  Each building had its own style. One made out of wood like an old-fashioned cabin, another was a large silver concrete building that was at least three stories tall, with wide clear windows that reflected the gray London sky .Sherlock's building was a large brick building adorned with a few large bushes and a couple beds of flowers of all different kinds.  He's never seen this building during his time spent here. He looked up at the sign.
Sherlock groans at the idiotic nickname . He don't know how much longer he can stand being around the Two Stooges and their angel. The synthetic grace seems a lot safer than some demon. And a trip to a different state  with John and the idea of  single bed hotel rooms  sounds delightful. Sherlock's eyes lingered down John's body. The  dark  brown army fatigues he bought John fit him so well...tight in just the right areas.
"  It's a shame I  was so close to having him. " The King of Hell chuckled . His gravelly voice echoing in the dark.  He tilted his head and observed the creature in front of him. " But I can't have you killing him. He's no good to me dead... Though,  he did do quite a number on you didn't he ?" Crowley's red eyes scanned over the angels neck. It wasn't easy to see but with his demon senses he can see  the stone breaking away and falling to dust . " That's a pretty nasty left hook he has . " Crowley smiles . " Even an alien like you seemed surprised by his strength.” Crowley inspected his nails. “ He’s  waking up so you better run little angel , go back to whatever pit you crawled out of . " He spit in the angels face and turned around . It could attack if it wants, he could always get a new vessel.
His ankles really did  hurt . Buuuttt.... being  held in the arms of a strong handsome soldier was not all bad either.
She wrote down the order completely ignoring Sherlock.  She smiled at John again  before wandering away swaying her hips more than strictly necessary.
"Mycroft. " John corrected  politely with a nodded " The question is : how did he not know Bobby was dead. That man knows everything. "
Sherlock looked over John's frame trying to get a feel for what he must have meant, however when John drank that it a little more unpredictable .
It's been forever since John had a girlfriend stay so long , even with Sherlock's consent texting during dates and when he's at her house she don't seem to mind. She's a nice girl ,understanding and smart. She works in the microbiology lab at the clinic. She's smart , beautiful. She has  long fake curly blond hair that touches her full hips, sky blue eyes that change with her mood. She's a bit heavy set  but - the weight is in all the right places. Large breasted, thick thighs and a perky arse. She's a few inches shorter than John and about four years younger than him as well .
“ Let go of me !” Sherlock thrashed in   the demons arms. He bit and scratched; he wasn't going to make this easy for them.
John felt his brain click ,that settles that ...even the Winchesters can see it…..it's as clear as day.
John  shakes his head fondly at the grunt and the role of  Dean's eyes . He's going to actually miss these two. " How you two are not  dead is a mystery. “ John mumbled more to himself than anyone in particular.
Letting Sherlock pick a few things is worth seeing that smile again....Not like he would have to wear the ridiculous fake army fatigues.  He was only staying for a few days after all.
The adrenaline tapered off. Quickly he ran into young Sherlock's room. The doctor found him trembling tangled in his bed . Crying pleading...
Sherlock withdrew with  a look of hurt on his face.  " Do what ? Like me because  it is clear you do . Is it because I'm sixteen ? Or is it because you are to scared to put the moves on your future boyfriend ?"
John chuckles softly.  This time he lowers his pajamas just low enough to see his red pants tightly hugging his hips his soft blond happy trial of hair leading down to where he knows she wants to see. He smiles wickedly at the camera.
The next morning John was at the bunker again watching the strange men and women go about their business. Whatever that may be. Who knew the post office had this huge bunker like building built into it. He was sitting on the edge of the balcony when Khoung's deep Russian accented voice broke his train of thought.
After they eat , change and finish their coffee they were off. Down the rode. It was a short five minutes drive to 210 Leona from the Morgan City Motel. One right on Brashear Avenue down  Federal and a short left on Leona. They were parked across the road from a small yellow house with a dark brown wrap around porch. People were standing outside smoking with beers already in their hands.  Three men : one near  his fifties , shorter than John and so skinny he made Sherlock look like Mycroft . The other two men were obviously bothers tall built like a bull with curly sandy blonde hair. The slightly shorter of the two had the start of a rather large beer gut.
John followed the chubby man out of Sherlock's flat with a  very confused Sherlock still attached to his side
Dean let out a chuckle as the two broke apart , John's hand still on the boys lower back protectively.
"Alright if you want to dress like someone's daddy I won't stop you" He said with a put on sigh.  He went back to digging though the racks of fake military style gear.
“No, Sherlock. I'm not angry. You let me keep this one ..... You were going to let me find out on my own weren't you? ” John asked taking his cup from Sherlock's long pale fingers . He took a sip the sting and warmth helped a bit . He smiled for once he happy of Sherlock's social and emotional ignorance. “ I can't believe you..... ”
