“Sherlock,” came John’s warning voice from across the room, where he had been sitting quietly and patiently, in his usual rigid military posture, while the nurse had been fussing over Sherlock.
“After we test your blood, we will be able to tell if implantation has occurred.  Don’t be too upset if it hasn’t—you will continue to ovulate monthly, until you become pregnant.  So there will be plenty more chances for you.”
to do that with Mary, in all honesty, but with Sherlock it is different.  He wants to share everything with Sherlock, romantic and stupidly sentimental as it all is.  He can see how this is exactly the sort of thing that Sherlock would hate, though, and he tries to hide a wince as his stomach knots itself into ropes.
However, John ignores the blatant display that Sherlock is putting on and instead decides to go about this slowly.  “Let’s get these off, yeah?” he asks innocently as he fumbles about with the flies.
“Please, John,” Sherlock scoffs and rolls his eyes.  “I don’t need your
, Sherlock reaches down to take hold of his own cock, smearing the precome that has leaked from the tip all around the head with the flat of his palm, moaning desperately at the feel of the friction against the heated flesh.
“It’s stupid and frivolous,” Sherlock stated simply, getting up from his seat with some difficulty and going to the shelves to search out another book.  “And I don’t see why I should be subjected to it!”
A few minutes later the bathroom door opened and a very pale, very shaky Sherlock stepped out, sea blue eyes pinned on John like a wild animal being stalked.
John looks at him in disbelief.  “It’s Friday,” he breathes out, shocked.
“So what are you going to do about the Holmes kid, then?” Mike asks, but the question is not meant to start a friendly conversation.  It sounds sardonic coming out of Mike’s mouth.  “Wait for him to graduate and then move away with him when he goes to university?  Follow him around like a middle-aged, besotted, lovesick fool?  Don’t you think that might seem a tad suspicious?  At the very least Mary will ask questions and dig around, find out that you were having an affair while you were married.  It won’t be hard to put two and two together.  She’s not an idiot, you know.”
For a long while Sherlock only stares at him blankly.  His eyes have gone an odd pale-green colour in the bright light that filters in through the kitchen window and shines down on him from behind, tinting his hair more auburn than usual.  It makes his skin look much paler than it really is.
“Did I do it right, Daddy?” Sherlock asks as he pulls away slightly so that he can stare at John.  The look in his eyes is almost overwhelming in its innocence and genuineness, and John’s movements stutter to a halt.  This isn’t part of whatever internal script Sherlock had planned out, John realises.  He has forgotten just how much reassurance Sherlock had needed in the beginning of their relationship; it would make sense that the deeper Sherlock sinks into this headspace of his, the more self-conscious he would get.  After all, Sherlock loves knowing that he is doing well.  He loves knowing that he is being good for John.
It amazes John that the two of them, each with their own set of kinks and fetishes, have found each other and come together this way, their sexual desires complimenting each other behind closed doors much the same way their personalities complement each other out in the real world, beyond the walls of this bedroom.
He urges them on to the admittance desk as fast as Sherlock can go.
“I love you.”
“What, like—”
Sherlock whimpers at the addition, fingers tearing into his bear as he drags it down towards his face, hiding against it.  “I-I’m sorry, Daddy,” he moans as John stretches him around his middle and index fingers.
“Yeah, right,” John said, frowning.  “Okay, well then you’ll have to have something that you need fixed,” he stated matter-of-factly, deciding that if Sherlock was doing this only in the name of science then he could be detached and clinical about it as well.  “Or that you need to happen.”
“God, Sherlock.
“Oh, er…” John stares at Sherlock, wide-eyed and caught off guard.  He’s never really noticed that he calls Sherlock anything.  He’s never thought that Sherlock might not like being called those types of things—
“Oh my God, look at you,” John breathes out, his fingers tightening on Sherlock’s sides, hands on the boy’s hips as he rides the motions of Sherlock’s thrusts.  “You’re the filthiest thing I’ve ever seen.  Does it feel good, baby?”
They have been lying on the floor, snogging for the last ten minutes.  John’s knees are killing him and he is sure that Sherlock’s back must be hurting.  No matter how young he is, necking on the floor is never comfortable.  The timer on the oven goes off just as John’s hands start to wander lower, and Sherlock giggles against his mouth.
“Mycroft is around your age,” Sherlock answers, and he turns on his phone to fiddle with some app or another and doesn’t look up at John.
John was drained from just a few hours of being on a proper case with the consulting detective again. They hadn’t been at it for a while now, what with Sherlock having been so sick the past couple of months. He missed the feeling of solving the case, sure, but he was coming to realize that a pregnant, achy, hungry Sherlock was not an evil that should be released on the world.
Beside him Mike simply purses his lips and narrows his eyes at John.  “Is it best if I don’t know?” he asks lightly, as if it is inconsequential.
“Are you ready for me, baby?  Seems like you are,” he answers himself, lifting his head up from between Sherlock’s arse cheeks and grinning at the teen.  “You seem more than ready.  Do you want me to fuck you now?”
John tries not to show his irritation.  He closes his eyes for a brief second and inhales, his head twitching slightly to the side.  When he opens his eyes again he no longer feels as if he is about to yell at the infuriating student.  He licks his lips.  “Yes, but you didn’t wait around after school all this time just to listen to me lecture you about your smoking habit,” he says.
“You have to go.  Now,” John tells him, pushing him towards the door once again, though not as harshly this time.  His hands on Sherlock’s back are somewhat softer, less tense.  He allows his fingers to curve along the contours of Sherlock’s body, rubbing slightly, a silent plea for Sherlock to stop playing this game, whatever it is.  “You shouldn’t be here.  It’s highly inappropriate.”
“I know what he’s been telling you,” Sherlock continued, and John got the distinct impression that Sherlock was trying to shame him with his words—and, if that were the case, it was working wonders.  John visibly cringed as Sherlock spoke, not sure he could stomach listening to the man for a moment longer.  “I know that he still talks to you about his feelings for you and I know what you’re starting to think about the whole situation.”
He has always treated Sherlock with the utmost respect and care, which is more than John can say about the way the child treats
“That’s because she’s an insecure narcissist who can’t take responsibility for anything in her life,” Sherlock answers, waving a flippant hand back and forth as if he is explaining away something of little consequence.  “If you were to ask her, she would probably blame you for her cheating, too.”
.  He always knows how to set John off, but he always knows exactly what to do to quell John’s anger, too.  It is disconcerting, to say the least.
He lifts his head again and stretches up to place a single soft kiss on Sherlock’s lips.  “I would never hurt you,” he promises Sherlock, tone gentle and serious.  “I’ll take such good care of you before I fuck you, it won’t hurt you at all.  I never want to hurt you.”
It’s all so very plain, so absolutely mundane, and so achingly arousing.  John can’t help it when his cock starts to respond to the closeness of Sherlock, the little sounds of pleasure he is making as John rubs off the last of the suds.  The heat of Sherlock’s body is so near and John gets lost in the feel of Sherlock’s slick, wet flesh under his hands.  With a flip of his stomach and tingle of his skin he suddenly remembers the other gift in the bag which he brought into the loo from his closet.
Sherlock didn’t know how he managed to go 17 weeks without sex with John. Because it had only been 2 days since the blonde doctor had left for his medical conference and Sherlock already felt like he couldn’t function without a John-induced orgasm. Crime scenes and Scotland Yard police officers were feeling the brunt of it, mostly, but it was nothing compared to how high-strung and tense Sherlock was feeling.
It was heavy and the backing on it was high quality black velvet and not just flimsy cardboard, so he knew that it was expensive.  He could tell that the back of it wasn’t sitting flush against the edge of the frame itself, so someone must have already put a picture in it—it was doubtful that a frame this nice would be so shoddily packaged that it was just a mistake.
His phone vibrated in his trouser pocket and he jumped guiltily, caught off guard by the loud sound in the quiet room.  He knew who it was, of course.  It could only be one person.
Sherlock finally stopped, in the middle of what John could only assume was going to be a large room once the workers had the drywall up.  People milled about them, but Sherlock didn’t seem to mind them at all.  He turned on his heel to face the doctor, smile still in place.
“Christ, look at you, you sinful little thing,” John breaths out, licking his lips.  “Daddy has to touch you, sweetheart.  Can Daddy make you feel good like your duck does?”
“No,” he asserts firmly, extremely flustered.  “I’m not saying—
That gives Sherlock pause.  He continues to stare at John from his seat, but there is a change in his face, a darkening of his eyes, a tightening of his mouth.  He looks wary now, the way he always does when he puts his guard up around John, afraid of getting hurt.  “Then why do you bother?” he asks quietly.
John rides out his orgasm with shallower thrusts between Sherlock’s thighs, and he can feel his semen smear all over Sherlock’s legs.  Once John comes, Sherlock’s breath catches and John can feel the teen’s body tighten.  Sherlock suddenly moans quietly as he climaxes and John moves his unused hand off of Sherlock’s chest and up to cover Sherlock’s mouth, trying to stifle the sound.
“Christ, Sherlock,” he says, still trying to catch his breath.  “That was…” he searches for the words and finds that he doesn’t know what it is he is trying to say.  Still, he needs to tell Sherlock how amazing he feels, he has to let the boy know just what Sherlock does to him.  “I’ve never come like that before,” he tells the brunet, looking over at him.  Sherlock looks sated, shagged out.  His hair is a complete mess and his skin is still pink from his post-orgasmic afterglow.  “Never in my life.  Not with anyone.”
John grins at that and finishes off the last of his chips.  “Glad I could help you get a leg over,” he tells Mike with a smile.  “Just like old times, huh?  You never could get any on your own.”
Sherlock startles suddenly, making John jump slightly.
John knows that Sherlock’s house will stay dark and empty for hours to come.  He has spent a decent amount of time with Sherlock already, but there is no need for him to go rushing off just yet; he can enjoy this time with his young lover.  “Of course,” he says, more than happy that he doesn’t have to leave.
Sherlock reaches out to take it in his hands, eyes wide as he silently studies his new toy in the same exact way he does every single time John gives him a present.  At first John had thought that Sherlock did it because he didn’t like his gifts and was trying to figure out a polite way to decline them.  John is slowly coming to find, though, that it is more a silence borne out of surprise that someone thinks about him enough to buy him seemingly insignificant presents for no reason at all.
“If you must know, I’m down to a pack a day,” Sherlock tells him another night as they sit across from each other.  He seems to be proud of himself as he says it.
For a moment John stares at him in astonishment, surprise etched on both of their faces at the suddenness of Sherlock’s orgasm.  But then John practically melts against him and ruts against his body, dick smearing across Sherlock’s semen coated stomach and creating the most wonderful slide of flesh between them.
“Sherlock!” John complained with a groan, rolling his eyes and trying to turn away, but Sherlock’s hand on his shoulder tightened and held him in place.
“I don’t think we should, John.  It would save her the mortification,” he said, reaching a hand out to pull John towards him, wrapping his arm around the other man’s still shaking shoulder.  He turned to give the top of John’s head a kiss, sighing in contentment.  It seemed he was still pushing his luck, he knew.
He got his few things together and washed up quietly, not wanting to bother Greg, and made his way out of the flat silently, leaving only a made-up couch and a small note of thanks scribbled on the pad by the phone.
He shook his head and made a face. “No, sorry, you’ve missed your chance at it.”
Sherlock gasps and bites his lip but he keeps bearing down on John.  Finally the widest part of him slips past Sherlock’s entrance and John almost bottoms out inside of the teen quickly, nearly falling forward as he lodges his hips against Sherlock’s arse.  He stops himself from pushing inside completely, though, worried that Sherlock won’t be able to take him all, but that doesn’t stop his mind from going frighteningly blank for a moment at the feel of being surrounded completely by Sherlock at last.
Sherlock is sitting in John’s regular seat, facing the doorway.  When he hears John near the table, he looks up from the book he is reading and his face lights up with joy when his eyes land on John.
“Yes, you sweet thing,” he tells him.  “Go ahead.  Come for me.”
John, on the other hand, would simply sit awkwardly in between them at the dinner table, biting his tongue and keeping silent for fear that the Holmes brother’s wrath would be turned on him.  But as Sherlock and Mycroft continued to quibble at the table like temperamental children, John could only sigh into his soup and hope like hell that they wouldn’t have to spend much longer at Mycroft’s tender mercies.
Final chapter!  I know it's short, but hopefully it's good.  I'd like to thank everyone who commented, left kudos, bookmarked and read this fic.  And also, a huge thanks to That Kid With the Long Coat and SomeCoolName for beta'ing.  You guys are great!
“Of course,” Sherlock said, trying to keep the frustration out of his voice.  Like he would be here to discuss the
“No, I’m not hurt.  Everything seems to be working just fine,” Sherlock reassures him through the door.
“I’m going to start by prepping you,” John states, “but I won’t touch your cock; I know it will start to feel like too much.  We’ll just go slowly.  All right?”
“No, John, it’s not that,” he snapped annoyed, and slightly hurt that—if it
Sherlock’s second and third shots, though, were much better.  Adapting to the unfamiliar weight and pull of the gun quickly, he aimed again and shot at the man that he had missed before, catching him squarely in the chest this time and knocking him to the ground with a painful scream.  The third shot caught the tattooed man in the stomach, and the younger boy, who had not spoken at all during the ordeal, watched fearfully as his two friends were gunned down in front of his eyes, and he stopped moving towards Sherlock.  He stared at the brunette man for a long, quiet moment, eyes glued to the barrel of the gun that was pointing straight at his face.
“Oh no,” Sherlock moaned with fake sorrow. “Whatever will I do without you clinging to me while I try to sleep comfortably at night?” he mocked, and John could feel him settling down on his side of the bed with a happy sigh, pulling most of the covers around himself and leaving John with only a sliver to keep himself warm.
“What?” Lestrade asked, groaning at the thought of the press conference and the paperwork.  “Think she was murdered, then?  Do you think it’s a serial killer?”  He brought his hands up to wipe at his face in exasperation.  “Media is going to have a field day with this one,” he mumbled dejectedly.
“All right,” Sherlock says on a shaky breath.  He thinks for a small moment, and then says, “Arsenic.”
“So?” Sherlock sniffs derisively as he wipes himself off with John’s discarded jumper.  “I didn’t hear you voicing any concern while I was giving them to you.”
Sherlock bites his lip and nods, eyes slamming shut as he rolls his hips in a movement that takes John’s breath away.  He has to force himself not to come right then and there, with Sherlock riding him, all inhibitions gone, nothing but wild abandon as Sherlock finds a rhythm and sets the pace that he wants.  One of Sherlock’s hands slips in between their bodies and jerks at his cock while the other moves up his chest, touching himself all over, exploring what feels best for him.  His fingers find their way into his open mouth at one point and John sees his sinful tongue peek out to wet them.  They fall down, dripping saliva, to his chest, where he rubs and pinches at his nipples, making them wet and red and puffy.  It is all John can do not to lean forward and put his mouth on them after that.  John wants to touch him, so badly, but he doesn’t want to disturb the beautiful image of Sherlock taking his pleasure, losing control and finding what he needs in John.
.  And when his orgasm burns through him, he realises that this is all there ever was, this is all there ever needs to be.  Just this.  Just them.
“Oh,” he said softly, “right.”  He quickly bent down, flipping his coat tails up so that he didn’t step on them as he crouched, and squatted next to John.  He dug in his coat pocket for his magnifying glass, only to let out a frustrated growl at not finding it where he usually kept it.
Slowly he undresses, climbs under the duvet, and lies there for what feels like hours, sleep never coming to him.  Mary comes in and gets ready for bed.  She cautiously slips in between the sheets next to him, ignoring and avoiding John’s grief.
in his hand as Sherlock cries out.
, John thinks stupidly to himself, all other thoughts fleeing his mind as he stares at Sherlock unabashedly, mouth hanging open slightly.
John sits across the table from Sherlock and stares at the person before him, the teenage genius who hadn’t had any friends before he met John, whose IQ is higher than anyone John has ever known, who is amazing and brilliant and beautiful, and who hadn’t had anyone to love him before John came into his life.  John finds it hard to reconcile the fact that this is the same person who sits at John’s feet with his head resting on John’s knee so that John will read him a story, who curls up like a cat between John’s legs on the couch so that John will pet him and call him baby, who lets John fuck him while calling John “Daddy”.  And who currently has his thumb in his mouth, sucking chocolate off of it like a toddler.
“Yes.  It’s lovely.  It’s so soft…” the deep voice trails off as Sherlock continues to caress the bear, staring at it as if John isn’t even in the room anymore.
John sees red.
Normally John wouldn’t allow such impudence from his little one, but he wants Sherlock’s cock in his mouth just as much as Sherlock does.  So when the slim hips thrust forward and the tip of Sherlock’s prick smears slickly against John’s lips, the man can’t help but open wide and suck him back down, taking him in to the hilt.
“Go on, John,” Sherlock urges him.  “Say it.
For the first time John doesn’t know what to say to his friend.  He hasn’t really thought about what he would tell the man about Sherlock, mostly because he didn’t think that Stamford was going to want to know.  He knows he can’t tell Mike that he is sleeping with one of his students—the man may be his best mate, but he knows that Mike won’t hesitate to turn him in to the authorities for taking advantage of a student.  John may love Sherlock, but he still knows that what they are doing isn’t legal or acceptable in societal standards.  “He’s—well, it’s…” he licks his lips and trails off, at a loss.
Beside him he feels John begin to stir, and he knows that the other man will clean him up in a moment.  He is proven right when John gathers up a discarded shirt and wipes him down.  When they are both as clean as they can get without showers, John settles back onto the bed besides him and fidgets a bit uncomfortably.
“Nothing, Sherlock,” John sighed. “I just want to read my book. Why won’t you let me have even that much happiness?”
John remembers the rehab facility that Sherlock spoke of infrequently in the beginning of their relationship.  It was in the States.  Mycroft had sent him there.  Still holding Sherlock tightly by his upper arms, away from his body, John turns burning eyes onto the elder Holmes, glaring at him.
“Come on, then, gorgeous,” John coaxes as Sherlock’s cock jumps in his hands and dribbles out the first drops of his climax.  “Show me.”  He pulls away so that he can take in all of Sherlock as the boy comes apart around him.
“Why did you punch him?” Sherlock asks quietly, voice small in the silence of the bathroom as he dabs at the dried, crusting blood on the side of John’s face.  John can feel that the blood has caked into the hair at his temple, making it stick to his skin and pull at it irritatingly.
addiction—and he knew that he could never stop it.
Sherlock did nothing more than roll his eyes in exasperation. “Teenagers have to get the money to score somehow, Lestrade. If they were busy working, like productive members of society, they wouldn’t be shooting their brains up, now would they?”
John opens up his call log and goes back through his list of calls (mostly Sherlock, slightly less from Mary, and then Mike and Harry in descending order) until he comes across the only blocked number in his log in the recent months.  He knows it is pointless to try, but he dials it anyways.
Standing across the room from him, Sherlock could see that Dr. Greenwhich looked extremely tired, so different from the last time the consulting detective had seen him, only a few months ago, embracing his teenage daughter as Sherlock brought them back together after the kidnapping.  Now, he had the lines around his eyes, mouth and forehead that he had worn the entire time his daughter had been missing.
thinking of the day that Sherlock came home from his relapse.  It was a wonder he even remembered where he lived.  But he
At John’s words, Sherlock’s eyes widened slightly in surprise.  His mouth parts the tiniest bit as his tongue comes out to lick his lips nervously, trying to decipher just exactly what it is that John wants from him.  He is suddenly so unsure of himself and hesitant.  So John decides to help him out.
“Every time I try, it pokes me!” Sherlock shouts out, glaring at the offensive fruit.
And now that 40 had just become 38 or 36 or….
“It’s never bothered you before,” he says, almost as soon as John has finished his previous thought.  “Something’s changed.”  There is a short pause before, “Mary has made some sort of comment about it.”  He says John’s wife’s name like it tastes bad in his mouth.
He trailed off, taking another long draught from his mug and Lestrade stared at him from across the table, hard.
He dawdled with the case a bit, intent on spending as much time on work as he could. It may not have been like him to take so long with such an easy case, but he was coming to understand that these increasingly rare moments when he didn’t have to think about his future, or his decision to take the Synathida, or the damned pregnancy, were coming fewer and farther between, and he was going to hold on to any semblance of his old life that he could.
“I’ve already done it,” Sherlock cuts him off with a secret smile that John just wants to kiss right off his face.  “I’ve got the results in and everything.  Clean,” he states proudly.
They lay, panting, on top of one another for a few minutes, John’s head resting on Sherlock’s thigh and their legs and feet tangling around the sheet at the foot of the bed. When he had seemed to catch his breath enough, Sherlock propped himself up on the pillows, a goofy smile spreading across his face as he looked down at John.
“Because, Sherlock,” John says desperately, turning towards him.  “Because you’re just a
Sherlock begins shivering against him, a different sort of shudder wracking his body than the trembles.  John wraps the blanket tighter around him and pulls the duvet up close to his chin as the chills start up in earnest.  “Why, Sherlock?  Why did you do it?”  The question he doesn’t ask hangs heavy in the air between them.
“Everything,” she whispers, her voice full of anger and contempt for him.
“Then can I touch you?” Sherlock asks him, and for a moment John thinks that he is still talking about John’s scar.  But the miscommunication is quickly cleared up when he continues, “I want to know what your cock feels like.  I want to do for you what you do for me.  I want you to know how you take me apart.”
“What, love?” John asks, tearing his face away from Sherlock’s most sensitive places.  His mouth and chin are positively covered in saliva, it’s uncomfortable and obscene and John is surprised by how much he loves the feel of it.  “What do you want?”
When he finally makes it home, he finds himself with an armful of teenage genius, hugging him and simultaneously trying to pry the shopping from his hand.
“Sherlock,” John interrupts, wanting to reassure his student.  “I’ll step outside if that will—”
, John thinks as he drifts off to sleep, a large smile on his face.
“Okay, it’s okay, calm down,” John said soothingly, in what Sherlock had taken to calling his ‘wounded animal handling’ voice. John had picked up the tone over the past few weeks, when the mood swings had really begun to kick in.
But Sherlock doesn’t seem to share John’s concern.  “I haven’t slept,” he repeats agitatedly, not looking away from his microscope.
When they do resume talking, it is in hushed tones, telling one another quiet, secret things about themselves.  Sherlock tells John a little bit about the time of his life before his mother left, before his father started drinking so heavily, when Sherlock was still a small child.  When he was younger and happier.  Sherlock whispers that his father had been a man of many rules and that he had expected Sherlock to finish every meal placed before him.  Sherlock tells him that he would be punished if he didn’t finish his food, and John begins to see a pattern in Sherlock’s strange eating habits now that he is older.  Sherlock remembers story after story of how he, always contentious of authority, found every possible way to rebel as a child—leaving meals unfinished, picking through his food to find only what he liked best, taking only a few bites and declaring he was done eating only to be hungry later on.  He refused to give his father the satisfaction of asking for more food, though.  John tries to be angry because he knows that Sherlock’s bratty behaviour as a child led to the predicament that he is in today, but, really, he can’t help but shake his head in fond exasperation at the idiot lying in bed with him, the man-child who would cut off his nose to spite his face and not even realise it.  John understands now, why Sherlock is so picky when it comes to his eating habits: he has been basically allowed to eat like a spoilt 6 year old for the majority of his life, with no one to tell him otherwise.  Well, John will just have to start fixing that as soon as possible.
“I can do anything just as well as anyone else,” Sherlock answered, bitterly.  “Better even.”
“There,” he announces once it’s on.  “All done.  Do you want me to kiss it and make it better?”
Still circling his hips, Sherlock leans up and licks along John’s chest, cleaning the mess he made, until he reaches John’s nipple.  He takes the nub in his mouth and sucks at it, rolling his hips over John’s groin at the same time, and John is completely lost.  He convulses with an unintelligible moan, gripping Sherlock’s hands urgently and fucking into him in a last desperate attempt to bury himself deep.  He can feel his cock twitching and pulsing inside the closed heat of Sherlock’s tight passage as his climax burns through him like ice and fire, setting his body on aflame, and he cries out Sherlock’s name as his cock spills inside of him.  Sherlock looks up at him, watching him come, and continues to make small little movements with his hips, milking him for all he is worth.  He watches, lying underneath the man, as John comes apart, wrung out and whimpering above him.
John knows it’s pointless to lie, so he doesn’t bother.  “Well, yeah,” he confesses, and he tries not to fidget in his chair.  “I had kind of gotten used to the smell, but she noticed that I’ve been coming home reeking of cigarette smoke.  I had to lie to her and say that Mike started up again.”
Sherlock moans under his mouth, his entire body still sensitive after his orgasm.  John’s cock pulses out a few more drops of come at the sound, adding to the mess between them.
“To what?” John asks him, when it becomes clear that Sherlock isn’t going to finish his sentence.
John smiles at him reassuringly, the edges of it tipped with sadness and remorse, ashamed that his actions have already caused Sherlock to doubt John and himself.  “Always,” he answers Sherlock’s question without thinking, a searing promise burning between them.  John wants to regret it as soon as the words are out of his mouth, knowing that it’s too much too soon, but finds that he can’t.  The answer is true, and he knows it.  He has always wanted Sherlock, from the days when he first started getting to know him better, and he will
is the more fascinating of the species,” Sherlock affirms with a sharp intake of breath as John finds a particularly sensitive spot.  “I find them quite intriguing.  I just thought you should know.  I want you to know everything about me.  Before this weekend is through.”
me shut up.”
So he decides to stay in the shower and he tugs at himself again, a little softer than normal at first because he is still rather sensitive.  As he continues, though, the need to become a bit rougher emerges as he goes on and finds it slightly more difficult to climax than the first time around.  But it happens, eventually, and the feel of a second climax literally knocks the breath out of him and makes him a bit weak in the knees.  His vision swims a little and his skin tingles and feels rather strange, but there is a warm looseness in his belly, a distinct buzz in all of his extremities that feels amazing, and he chuckles at himself giddily, if not a bit breathlessly.
But there was only blackness around him, and emptiness.  Everything was empty—the rooms, the flat, the building—except for his bed, and his body, and he rubbed his hands gently over the swollen, stretched skin of his stomach, feeling his child move sleepily inside of him and letting his eyes drift closed when he couldn’t possibly stand to keep them open for a second longer.
The silent ban on 221b Baker Street had been temporarily revoked a few days prior, and Sherlock had resumed life with John as if nothing had happened at all.  John knew better than to ask if Sherlock was fine or what the silence had been all about.  Sherlock had never been one to explain his actions or the need for certain things in his life.  John would just have to content himself with the fact that Sherlock was speaking and sleeping again, and be happy with that for the moment.
Well that just won’t do.  John went through all of that hassle to undress him, after all.  He wants to see everything.
He was going to make John Watson get him good and pregnant.
Sherlock tastes like cigarettes and broken promises against John’s lips.
“And I can always tell when you’re about to come,” John is saying, “because your belly tightens.  I can feel the muscles moving under my hand or against my stomach when I’m pressed up against you like this.  You’re whole body starts to shake and your pupils dilate.  Your mouth goes soft and slack and that’s my favorite time to kiss you, when you’re too far gone to even respond to my lips.”  John bends down low over him now, bringing their mouths together but not kissing, just pressing so that he can still speak to Sherlock, can still talk to him.  “And while I’m kissing you, I can feel you inhale around my mouth, and I know that you’re finally there, finally, and then—”
“What are they doing back here?” John asked, pacing the living room of 221b Baker Street in an agitated manner, hands fluttering as fast as his feet as he stomped back and forth from one wall to the next. Sherlock, of all people, had had to put the kettle on and offer Mr. McNairn tea and biscuits, seemingly much more calm about the whole thing than John himself was. “They left us alone after they couldn’t get any information confirmed,” the blonde doctor continued to mutter, while Sherlock and McNairn sat in the chairs in the living room, watching John fidget. “And we’ve only just been back from Sherlock’s prenatal checkup. That isn’t enough time for them all to have met up outside our flat like that.”
, John thinks, frustrated.  He sends back a text that he hopes doesn’t make him sound as desperate as he feels, but there is no response to it; Sherlock is ignoring him, probably getting a good laugh out of all of this.  John tries not to think about how infuriating the boy can be, how frustrating and annoying—those things won’t bring him to orgasm.  His erection is almost unbearably painful now, and John continues to stroke himself as he reopens and stares at the last picture he received, trying to imagine how Sherlock had looked and what he had sounded like when he came.
“A family?” Sherlock repeated with a confused frown, the word sounding strange on his tongue.
For his part, Sherlock seems to rather enjoy having John’s fingers in him no matter how he can get them.  He licks and laves and sucks, teeth scraping and tongue soothing until John’s knees are weak and his cock is straining against the flimsy material of his underwear.  But Sherlock doesn’t seem to be finished, and John wouldn’t dream of interrupting him.  He reaches out to grab up the jar of marmalade and pops John’s fingers out of his mouth, only to dip them into the sticky preserve.  Sherlock brings them to his lips once again, sucking them back inside, heedless of the mess he is making on his face as they smear across his cheeks and chin.
“Everyone’s in the drawing room,” John said as he helped Sherlock down the stairs.  The brunette’s stomach protruded so far out that he could no longer see his feet anymore, and the stairs of Mycroft’s home were always taken with great care.
Sherlock lights up at the mention of a present from his Daddy, just like John knew he would.  John reaches over to the coffee table awkwardly, careful not to upset the squirming pile of teenage Sherlock in his lap.  He opens it one-handed, drawing out the contents inside, and presents it to Sherlock proudly, not able to keep the stupid, goofy smile off of his face, although the edges of it are curbed by a sudden nervousness.  He doesn’t know if it will ever stop being nerve-wracking, buying gifts like this for his very adult, very temperamental, very
And suddenly, John felt like he couldn’t take one more second of it.
One of those options sounds infinitely more pleasurable than the other.
“Christ, Sherlock, it’s freezing in here!” John says, exasperated.  He was going to take the boy to London today anyways, but now it seems like a sign that the trip that he has planned is a good idea.  “Come on, you can’t stay here,” John tells him, searching Sherlock’s dark room for some clean clothes.  “We’re going out.”
“Yours,” Sherlock slurs, blissed out of his mind and half incoherent.  “M’yours.  Always.”
And Bridget was off like a dash, pulling Sherlock to every corner of the shop to show him merchandise and tell him about the many things they would be needing for the baby.
“So you know you’re not supposed to do it, don’t you?”
Sherlock decided that was one of those questions John had told him about in the past—hypothetical and not requiring a response.
“What was it, then?” Greg asked, placing a friendly, comforting hand on John’s lap.  John could feel the heat of the detective’s palm through the thin material of his borrowed pajama bottoms and he tried to ignore the fact that he hadn’t been this close to another human being since a couple of weeks after Sherlock had taken the Synathida, due to the constant vomiting the pill—and then the subsequent pregnancy—had induced in his partner.  “He cheat on you with some science experiment?  Or…oh no, John.  You didn’t mess around on him, did you?”
God, it is unfair how well Sherlock can take a cock.  John doesn’t ever stand a chance playing this game when Sherlock wants to suck him.  And if he lets it go on for too long, it is over far too quickly, before John ever has the chance to fuck him.
He feels whole again.
A few people, including John, chuckled around him, and Sherlock smiled, too, closing the box that the violin came in with a gentle hand and moving it out of the way, so that he could get to the rest of the gifts.
“Help you with what?” Sherlock asks, confused.
are things that John thinks are easy enough to follow, but when John suggests them Sherlock throws such an epic fit that John is momentarily surprised and then swiftly thinks that the teenager is close to calling the whole thing off.  John doesn’t understand it and tells Sherlock as much.
“Yeah, no, I know,” John is quick to confirm, not wanting to say anything that will make Sherlock uncomfortable.  “It just seems like you’re more apt to finish whenever I dominate you somewhat.”
doesn’t seem to even begin to define it.  “I’m just so close that everything feels more intense.  You didn’t do anything wrong, it’s all right.”
leaving you.  I promise.  I don’t blame you for anything, and I certainly don’t hate you for anything.”  John wonders what he can say that he hasn’t already said, what he can possibly do that he hasn’t done yet, that will make Sherlock understand.  That will make Sherlock see that these feelings John has for him, this flame that he carries only for Sherlock, will never be extinguished, will never go out.
Sherlock gives him a small smile and shakes his head once again before placing a placating kiss on his forehead, like John has done to him so many times before in the past.  Then the teen gets up to don a dressing gown on his way to his desk to check the experiment that John had interrupted when he had shown up at Sherlock’s doorstep.
“Yes, John,” Sherlock gasps out, hair fanned out against the pillows and his eyes glazed over.  “Give it to me.”
“Sherlock, are you all right?” is the first thing John asks, looking him over as John hovers above him.
It was enough for Sherlock to wish that he had never gone through with the blasted idea in the first place.
“Yes,” Sherlock breathes, and his voice holds a hint of something that sounds like wonder.  “Yes.  I want to see it, too.”
John stares at Sherlock, at a loss.  There are no words.  John can think of nothing that he can say that would make this moment better, nothing that would make Sherlock’s pain go away.
They stare at each other for a moment in a dazed silence, John blushing profusely because he hadn’t meant to say any of that.
Lestrade gave a small sigh, as if he were unsure that he should even be doing this.  His hands twitched nervously as they sat by his sides, fingers moving almost of their own volition, and the detective gave him a pleading, almost desperate look, as if begging John to understand.
“What do you need from me, Sherlock?” he asks, voice breathless.
“I know you’ve been tested,” Sherlock cuts him off, a manic light in his eyes now that John has acquiesced to his demands.  “You haven’t slept with Mary in over a year but you got yourself tested after the last time.  Considering her serial adultery and your health consciousness, you most likely got tested quite frequently when you were still having semi-regular sex with her.  I also know that your results came back clean because you didn’t end this discussion right at the start.”
Sherlock cries out, the sound low and guttural.  He shoves his arse backwards, wanting to take John’s finger deep into him.  His hips thrust and rotate, and John can feel his own knuckles rubbing all over the slick muscle.
“What is it, Mike?  Spit it out, already, you’re making me nervous!”
When Sherlock finally pulls away from him for air, he doesn’t go very far.  His lips stay attached to John’s body and he trails kisses across the man’s chest, over to his arm.  John feels a warm tongue dip into the small indentions of the scars there, licking and tasting each one.
“Touch yourself, Sherlock,” he says, pushing into the wet heat of the body under him, lifting Sherlock’s legs and hooking them over his shoulders, pushing himself in deeper.  “I want to see you come, baby.  I want to see you make a mess all over yourself.”
He feels like he’s home.
Why had Sherlock done this?  Why had he thought that this would be an idea even worth entertaining?  Why had he jumped into it headfirst, without stopping to discuss it, to rationalize it, to think it over?
"Yes, sir," Sherlock gasps out, bringing his hands down to his cock and pulling at himself to get some sort of friction.
“Turn over so I can see, love.”
“You’re laughing at me,” Sherlock said suddenly, astutely.
“Well I’m not sick of you.”  He was being petulant and childish, he knew, but—really—he didn’t know what else he should say, what else he should do in this situation.  He could feel John slipping away from him, pulling and pushing against him and trying to break apart, trying to leave.  And,
“John!” Sherlock cries out, voice breathless and, God, John relishes the way Sherlock says his name when John is making love to him.  There is a desperate, pleading tone that comes into Sherlock’s newly deepened voice that drives John absolutely wild.
“God,” he rasps, trying to buck up farther into Sherlock’s mouth.  He looks down the length of his body and finds Sherlock studiously avoiding his gaze, his sparkling eyes pinned to a spot on John’s groin, concentrating intensely as he takes John deeper and deeper into his mouth.
“Oh, yes,” John moans as he starts up a regular rhythm, rocking Sherlock back and forth on top of him.
“Please?” Sherlock amends, eyes big and guileless.  John can’t tell him “no”.
It isn’t a question so John doesn’t answer.  He couldn’t, anyways.  All he can do is turn away from Sherlock, ashamed.
“Oh, right,” John says uncomfortably, calling himself an idiot.  What a completely bigoted question to ask in this day and age.  He should have known better.  He, of all people, knows what it’s like to have his sexual preferences assumed—just because he’s married doesn’t mean he’s straight.  He hopes that Sherlock isn’t offended by his question, but he knows how some of these teens nowadays like to think they are radical activists and martyrs or some such nonsense.  “Do you…have a boyfriend, then?” he asks in a lame attempt to cover his tracks.  “Which is fine, by the way,” he says in a rush.
“Yes,” John says, hands running down Sherlock’s knobby back to dip into the elastic band of the pyjama bottoms that he is still wearing.  “Yes.”
Other times, the problems are much larger, though, and harder to make disappear with just that simple word, though Sherlock certainly tries.
John chooses to ignore the flirtatious undercurrent to Sherlock’s words, however, and decides to take them at face value.  He pushes his purchase towards the brunet across the flat expanse of the tabletop.  “Then why don’t you start with this muffin and we’ll go from there.”
“They’ve all been checked over and cleared as safe.  I’ll just leave you to it, then,” Anthea said softly, but neither one of the men were really paying any attention to her.  When she slipped out of the room and left them alone, they didn’t even notice.
“Well, yeah,” John tells him, placing a soft kiss on his forehead.  “You can be anything you want to be Sherlock, and I know you’d be brilliant at it.  You’re so smart.  You can do anything you want.  If you want to be a consulting detective, I don’t see how anything would be able to stand in your way.”
hyphenated, though, correct?”
Sherlock had always thought of love as a dangerous disadvantage, and it would seem that at this very moment it was proving itself to be true.
221 Baker Street no longer stood solemn and stagnant against the black London sky.  Now, instead, it was burning.  A roaring fire that was consuming everything that it touched.  He could barely even see the brick façade of the building behind the flames.  All that was left was a wall of fire that was reaching towards the dark heavens above it, casting an orange glow over everything on the whole block.  There were two fire trucks on the street in front of 221 already, and the firemen were focusing their high powered water hoses on the edges of the fire, the corners of the structure, protecting the surrounding buildings from the flames as best they could.  There was nothing they could do except wait for the flames to burn themselves out.  No amount of water would make a difference in that fire, even Sherlock could see that.
John doesn’t really know what to say to that so he stretches out to kiss Sherlock sadly, and it feels like an apology.  He sits up on the edge of the bed and bends down to the floor to pick up his trousers and pants.  “I’ll come round earlier tomorrow, since I won’t be able to stay too late.  I have dinner plans with Mary.”
,” he moans.
The music continued, changing again, and this time John’s breath caught in his chest as he heard it—the sound of his son’s heartbeat as he stood once again in that doctor’s office, staring at a bulky machine that showed the bean-shaped body of his baby in black and white squiggles on a large square screen, and in the quiet darkness of the bedroom he could feel Sherlock’s music cover him as fully and completely as the sound of his son’s heartbeat in that tiny exam room did that day, weeks ago.
Sherlock turns to look at John, his face blank and his gaze penetrating.  “There’s no one around for it to bother,” he says off-handedly.
yes just like that.”
“Let me have that cupcake in the display.  The chocolate one,” John says, leaning his cane against the counter and pulling out his wallet.
John can see Sherlock’s lips tremble and he looks frightfully pale, almost scared.  “Yes,” Sherlock answers on a broken whisper with a vigorous nod of his curly head.  “It’s just…” he trails off, biting his lip and looking away from John.
“Listen,” John sighs heavily, running a hand through his hair and making a mess of it.  He is tired.  So tired.  He doesn’t want to be having this conversation, but he knows that there is no stopping it now.  She needs to know the truth of it all.  She deserves to know, after everything that John has done the past few months.  He owes her that much, at least.  “I think we should talk.”
For her part, she stood her ground rather well, squaring her shoulders and raising her chin. He knew he couldn’t intimidate her, not with his belly and not when she was used to hearing and seeing worse things in such a male-based profession. So he tried to play to her more feminine emotions. “John worries about what the stress will do to the baby,” he told her plainly, “and I’ve already been labeled as high risk. You have no idea what consequences you can bring about with your little stunts.”
Mary clears her throat in a nervous sort of manner and tries to sound aloof.  “There is a medical conference in Cardiff two weekends from now and she says that she wants to take me along with her.”  Mary’s fork makes a shrill scraping noise as she drags it across the bottom of her plate.
Against his chest, he can feel Sherlock nod his head.
“Hello?” he says, voice tight and high.
“Daddy,” Sherlock breathes.  “Daddy, I’m ready now.  You can start if you want to.”
“I know you like the mental aspects of it—taking care of someone, nurturing someone, providing for them.  Dominating them,” Sherlock explains, looking John straight in the eye, and the man can’t help but shiver as Sherlock says the last two words, thinking of all the ways that John could do exactly that to him.  “But this proves that you like the visual part of it as well,” he continues, holding up the bear.  “You like emphasising my youth and you’re aroused by the things that make me noticeably young.  We both know, though, that my actual age is the crucial factor in all of this but the thought of seeing me with something like this—something that de-ages me—makes it easier to fantasize, to play the game.”
“Stay just a little bit longer,” Sherlock tells him the next day as he lies sweating and naked on top of his duvet.  He is on his stomach, heedless of the mess on his belly that he is now rubbing onto the bed sheets.
John chuckles at his eager young lover.  “Yes, you rotten little thing,” he gives in, reaching out for the chocolate bar that he has kept close by because he knew Sherlock would be asking for it as soon as they were finished with dinner.  “Here you go, my little honeybee—have to have your sweets, don’t you?”  John hands the treat to him and lets Sherlock snatch it out of his grip in a hurry.
Sherlock looks at John, so close to him, and doesn’t say anything, doesn’t do anything, for a long moment.
“I love you,” he whispers against Sherlock’s lips, dry from panting.  “I love you so much, you have no idea.  I love you so much that I don’t even know what to do,” he confesses.
X.X.X
But, it seemed that he was the only one.
“Yes, I know.  You truly are a genius,” John deadpans with a smirk and roll of his eyes.  “Why?  Why am I spanking you?”
On his knees, John swallows down his mouthful before carefully pulling off the softening prick.  He licks and nuzzles at the wet, sticky length of it as it falls back on top of Sherlock’s lower tummy, cleaning him off in a way that makes Sherlock giggle slightly, always ticklish to certain stimuli after climaxing.
John lifts his lover’s hand facing upwards and tenderly places a gentle kiss over the bandage, a barely-there brush of lips.
However, it seems that Mycroft won’t give his little brother up without a fight this time.  If the elder Holmes ever did anything as indelicate as scoff, he would have done so then.  John can see something close to a sneer settling on his face.  “It doesn’t seem as though you are doing much better, Dr. Watson.”
When they are finally allowed to go, it is closer to the next morning than it is to the previous night and John knows that he is going to have to leave Sherlock on his own when he goes back home.
John groans at Sherlock’s words and thrusts harder.
After he has stroked himself for a moment and Sherlock has backed away from the jagged edge that John has pushed him to, the man bends low to lick over him again, dipping his tongue into the soft, open hole of Sherlock’s body as the boy cries out below him.  He loves it so much, the feel of Sherlock against his tongue, under his mouth; the taste of such secret, sensitive skin on his lips.
Sherlock pushes back against John’s face, rubbing himself against John’s tongue.  John lets him, licking at the tight ring of Sherlock’s hole and feeling it flutter and soften, opening slightly under his tongue.
“Fucking hell, John!” Mike yells out, and he is so angry and agitated now that he can’t even sit any longer.  He jumps out of his chair and it scrapes loudly across the dirty pub floor, drawing the attention of the bartender.  “Have you gone round the bend?  What is the matter with you?!”
“I hate you, John,” she tells him softly, but her words are no less truthful for their quietness.  “I really, truly do.  I wish I had never married you.”  She looks him dead in the eye, tears gathering at the corners but not falling and her lips trembling.  “I’ve wasted so much of my life on you, on us.  I’ve wasted so much of
“You’re taking advantage of him.  It’s sexual abuse,” Mike says bluntly.  John shakes his head against the accusation, but he doesn’t say anything because he knows that it’s true.  He has thought it himself before.
“I’ve never wanted anything more, you know,” John whispers, moving inside of him, deep.  “I’ve never wanted anything more than what you give me.  It’s all that I need.”
John asks Sherlock for another finger before his body is really ready to take it.
for one bloody second.
John thinks that he has never had a better first kiss in all of his life.
Sherlock simply stands in the entryway and raises an imperious eyebrow at John’s words but remains still and silent, not letting John into his house.
Unbelievable was right.  Sherlock didn’t know how they had ever thought that their lives were complete before Callum.  Before the Synathida and the pregnancy and the fights and the mess.
Thankfully Sherlock shakes his head, his curly hair tickling John’s cheek.  “Not too often.  The last time it was this bad was the night you took me to hospital.  There have been smaller incidents but not as big as this one.”
, Sherlock thought.
!” Sherlock squawks indignantly in surprise, twisting about in John’s grasp, but the man simply ignores him.
“When you left, it…destroyed me,” he tried again, and he felt the light tingle of a blush on his cheeks and the tips of his ears, his composure undone by John’s soft deep blue eyes boring into his own.  “And I can’t tell you how wonderful it is to see you back in Baker Street, where you belong,” he continued, hoping he was making more sense than what he thought he was.  “The entire time that I was here without you, I was incomplete.  It was as if something great was missing from my life.  Baker Street just wasn’t the same without you, John.  I wasn’t the same.  And here I was, in our flat, waiting so very long for you.  And now that you’re back…I could just slip right into you.”
That catches his attention.  “What?” he asks—almost yells, really—caught off-guard by such a complete lack of disrespect and common decency.
John groans at the heat that is suddenly enveloping his stiff prick.  When they wank, it feels amazing—every time, no question—but there is just something about the warmth of a body wrapped completely around his hard cock that surpasses everything else.  He gives an experimental thrust and slides slickly through the tight space between Sherlock’s clenched thighs, the lotion making Sherlock’s skin smooth.  John pants into Sherlock’s neck at the feel of it and reaches his lotion-smeared hand around to Sherlock’s front, gripping Sherlock’s cock and stroking him.
how wrong it was.  “I could have hurt you.  I could have given us away.  I was reckless.  I don’t know what came over me.  If I had hurt you, I’d never be able to forgive myself.  I’m sorry.”  He presses a kiss to Sherlock’s forehead.  “It won’t happen again,” he promises with conviction.  He knows that this is one of the reasons why he can’t leave his wife just now, because he doesn’t trust his own self-control.  He had thought that Sherlock would be the bigger problem, but this incident just proves how wrong he was.
But John was correct in his statement, and as much as Sherlock wanted to, he couldn’t ignore the fact that they
.  Your miniscule little brain could not possibly try to keep anything a secret from me.  I’ve always known.  I simply never felt the need to say anything because I knew that you would never do anything about it.  Until something pushed you hard enough, something drastic.  And now you can’t stand the fact that I have him, and I have this, and you have nothing.”
“But he’s completely insatiable, Mike,” John continues hurriedly, covering up the awkward hitch in the conversation.  “We haven’t even gone all the way and I can’t keep up with him.”  He shakes his head and runs a hand through his hair, taking a drink of his beer.  “I can’t remember being that age, but if I was half as horny as he is all the time it’s a wonder I was able to even graduate uni!”
Sherlock has been giving him exactly what he had wanted: the daddy kink without the daddy part.
“Shut up, Sherlock,” John chokes out through clenched teeth, voice gone rough and breath gone jagged in his anger.  “Just shut up.”
“Yes,” Sherlock gasps, his face pressed into the pillow.
John’s frown deepened at the childishness of his partner. “You hadn’t been eating well during your first trimester, and you need to make up for it. Now, eat it!”
When he finally finds what he is looking for, he flips the cap and squirts some of the cool, viscous liquid into his hands.  He rubs the lube around his fingers, spreading it and letting it warm before brushing against Sherlock’s entrance once more, slicking the outer muscle and making it shine.  He wipes as much of the excess lube as he can along the dip of Sherlock’s arse, pushing it gently towards the boy’s hole, where it will be needed shortly.  When Sherlock is as wet as John can make him, the man licks his lips nervously, knowing what is going to happen next.  “Okay, Sherlock,” he murmurs softly, running his finger through the slick pool of lube that is sitting at the teen’s entrance.  “I’m going to put the tip of my finger in,” John tells him.  “Just the tip,” he promises.
“We’ll need to go shopping for electronics again,” the brunette man was mumbling to himself, staring at the far wall of the room with his fingers steepled in front of his mouth, not paying John any attention again.
It had finally come.
When his head stops spinning, he looks down at Sherlock, covered in his come, and the growling beast in his belly quiets for a moment, sated by the sight of his claim on his young lover.  John sighs happily and rubs some of the slick emission into Sherlock’s skin with his thumb, lifting his hand and bringing it up to Sherlock’s mouth for the teen to clean off.  Sherlock takes it in his mouth and sucks it wetly, and John’s cock makes a futile attempt at waking once again.
“American pop culture reference,” John explains, sighing tiredly.  When Sherlock just looks at him blankly, John snaps out, “Oh, I don’t even know why I bother!”
for an end to it.
“Freak and Freak, Jr. are still here, I see,” Donovan said acidly, by way of greeting.
John should be mad that Sherlock has used him this way, right now, in this particular situation.  Sherlock knows that John hates when he doesn’t let John care for him the way John wants, or makes John do things that hurt him.  And right now Sherlock was letting John hurt him past the point of pleasure, past the point that his body could take.  Sherlock
, his mind warns him, and he agrees whole-heartedly.  He sends Sherlock a rather formal-sounding text stating that he is about to go into the first of his classes for the day and to please not disturb him.
“That’s it, love,” John encourages him, staring up at Sherlock’s enraptured face.  “That’s beautiful.”
Silence settled over the room for a long moment, broken only by the low drone of the tv and the soft noises of newspaper pages turning.  John was almost to the end of periodical—and more than happy to note that there was not even the smallest mention of Sherlock Holmes in conjunction with a piece on the Synathida protests that were still happening in the area—when suddenly Sherlock jumped in his seat across the coffee table from John, sitting up quickly and bringing a hand up to touch his belly.
The last of John’s resolve crumbles, taking with it what little control he had left, and he lets out a soft, helpless cry.  He suddenly pulls Sherlock towards him instead of pushing him away in the uncomfortable position he has put himself in, shoved into the corner of the booth as he is.  He lets the leg that Sherlock is rubbing himself against slide farther up onto the seat, slipping more comfortably under Sherlock and letting John ease into a better angle.  Like this, he is more fully reclined under Sherlock, and John can grip the boy roughly by his arms and hold him tightly against his own body, rubbing them together closely, wonderfully, perfectly.
Sherlock’s mouth was hard on his, unyielding and demanding, tearing John’s lips apart with the hot press of his tongue and taking him ferociously, tasting every inch of the inside of his mouth.
Sherlock does not text today.
He regained his footing and pushed back against the people around him, shouldering them away so that he could have room to breathe.  A few feet ahead of him, Sherlock was fighting against the small group of men being escorted towards the building, trying to get to John, but the men were panicking around him, afraid to get too close to the protesters.  They kept Sherlock within their ranks, hands coming up to pull him back in when he tried to get away from them.
“It’s all me, Sherlock.  Everything.
child’.  This was Sherlock’s problem, is what John was saying without words.  John didn’t want anything to do with this.
“No, of course not!” John assures him quickly and somewhat loudly.  He looks around to be sure he hasn’t brought any attention to them and turns back to Sherlock, lowering his voice.  “I want you to quit for you.  It’s not healthy, you know that.  A kid your age shouldn’t be smoking as much as you do.”
In his arms, crushing John to him, grasping onto the doctor’s shoulders with hands that were shaking only slightly and burying his face into the crook of John’s neck, breathing in deep.
But when Sherlock speaks again, he still sounds unsure.  Confused and frightened and like he is at the end of his rope, struggling to hold on for just a little while longer.
John gives him a skeptical look.  “No you didn’t.”
“Yes.”  John nods hastily, turning around to grab the second item out from the bag he had brought in.  “Look, here.”  He holds it up to Sherlock and they both stare at it for a moment before Sherlock breaks into uncontrollable giggles.  His wet, bubbly hands reach up automatically to take his gift from John as he continues to stare at it in unabashed happiness.
“I made a promise, Sherlock, and I didn’t keep it,” John explained, his hands fluttering about wildly in his distress, the .22 still in his grasp.  “I don’t want to start off our baby’s life with me not able to keep promises to him.”
When the man became aware of Sherlock looming over him, he looked up at the brunette man and spat blood towards him, baring his teeth at Sherlock in pain and intimidation.  “You fucker,” the man gasped out, fingers clutching at his stomach convulsively as large shivers wracked his body.  “You’re going to burn in hell for your sins, faggot.  You and that bastard child of yours.”
Sherlock thought about the answer to John’s question as the doctor turned back to the frying pan on the stove, flipping the contents once more and then switching the burner off.
“Christ, look at how hard you are.  You just came, you naughty little thing.  Do you want to go again?”
The two revolted him.
Almost instantly, John flips them over so that Sherlock is suddenly on top of him.  His hands come between them to hurriedly divest them of their clothing, Sherlock’s helping him with jerky movements.  When they are both completely naked, John hugs him close, deepening their kisses, trying to show Sherlock how he feels about him without words.  Loving Sherlock, caring for him, even controlling him, all of this is what being Sherlock’s Daddy means to John.  Mostly, though, being Sherlock’s Daddy means that he will keep his little boy safe and happy all of the time, no matter what is happening.  He will make sure that Sherlock feels cared for, every second of his life.  The only time Sherlock should ever feel like he is coming apart is when John is making him do so.
John loves him so much.
It is a topical analgesic ointment, and Sherlock takes one look at it before he sniffles and nods, looking contrite.  John can’t help himself from pulling the child into a hug and dropping a kiss on top of frizzy curls before he lets Sherlock go and turns his attention to the bath.  It is halfway full now, and John grabs up the bottle of bubble bath that has sat unused under the sink for months now.  Mary won’t notice if any is missing, he is sure.  He pours a liberal amount under the faucet, letting it mix and froth up, creating a mountain of white foam that Sherlock stares at with wide eyes.
“Yes,” Sherlock finally answers him, after some time.  “One.  An older brother.”
John has found that Sherlock also has an insatiable and rather lascivious praise kink—which suits John just fine because he loves showering Sherlock with compliments.  It seems the two are perfectly suited for each other: Sherlock loves being praised when he shows off, and John loves watching Sherlock show off and telling him so.
,” he finishes with a smile.
good care of him.  He always gives Sherlock exactly what the boy wants.  Sherlock might not want to eat food often, but John knows that he loves come, and John does so love spoiling his boy.
The week following his doctor’s appointment, Sherlock was, indeed, on edge and rather jumpy, but he couldn’t be sure if it was pregnancy related, or if he was just feeling the strain of waiting for the doctor’s phone call.  Each time his cell phone went off, he would start violently and scramble for the small electronic device, rushing out of the room if John were in it.  Not very discreet, he knew, but he couldn’t help it: he felt as though he were walking a tight wire, waiting for the one piece of information that could tell him whether or not he could proceed with the next part of the experiment, or if he had to go back to square one.
,” is all John can get out.  “Not at all.”
At this, Sherlock’s blush deepens, and he still won’t look John in the eye.  “I was hoping that maybe you could read to me, afterwards, by the fire,” he answers, clearing up John’s confusion.
“You don’t seem very frightening,” John answers back, the response quick and biting.  He doesn’t appreciate this man stealing him away in the middle of the evening, employing scare tactics to make John squirm.  The ex-soldier has never been one for theatrics.
When John and Sherlock first moved to London after John left his wife, John had been sure to keep Mycroft informed of where Sherlock was, in order to ensure that the teen’s education and finances were taken care of.  This, though, meant that Mycroft now felt it was his duty to look in on his brother—even though he hadn’t felt it was his duty back when Sherlock was growing up in a neglectful home—despite the fact that John was now in Sherlock’s life, taking care of him.
?” he begs petulantly when John doesn’t answer him, sounding for all the world like the child he tries so hard not to be.
“Shhh, it’s all right now,” John consoled him.  He had only ever heard Sherlock cry once before, on the phone with him as he stared up at the man he loved on the edge of that building and heard him tell him goodbye.
John bites back a groan at the sound of Sherlock’s voice over his speaker.  It should be illegal, how wanton he sounds.  “God, Sherlock, you drive me crazy.  You beautiful monster.  What are you doing to me?” John asks him for what seems to be the hundredth time since meeting the boy.  Here he is at his wife’s family reunion, wanking to his teenage boyfriend’s voice over the phone while Mary stands on the other side of a closed door.
“Christ, no!” John exclaims.  “What kind of doctor—what kind of teacher or
“Don’t push me, kitten.  I’ll bend you over my knee and smack your little arse until you know how to behave,” John warns him, tone frosty.  They’ve talked about spankings before, agreed that it was something they were both comfortable with, but they have had few occasions in which to implement them.  Sherlock has said before that he wouldn’t be opposed to a bit of discipline.  Yet with the threat of it near, John can see Sherlock’s eyes wavering wetly at the dark promise of John’s words.  However, no matter how sweet and innocent, John will not be deterred by sad puppy-dog eyes.  “Now go lie down.”
When Sherlock finally has him naked, nestled between his pale spread thighs, John wastes no time rubbing dry fingers across the boy’s hole.  He can feel it clench as Sherlock gasps against his mouth and bucks into him, the tight ring of muscle closing up.  Sherlock’s arm shoots out to grab blindly at something on his bedside table, knocking over empty tea cups and boxes of nicotine patches.  He shoves a bottle at John’s chest.
He is Sherlock’s teacher; he is in a position of power.  That part is perfectly clear.  Yet even if that weren’t true, there is still the ambiguity of consent.  Sexual abuse is made out of the issue of consent, and John thinks about the boy he is in love with.  The boy who doesn’t have a mother and doesn’t have a father and doesn’t have any friends or family to teach him how to love or interact with another human being.  All Sherlock had before John was a detached human skull that he couldn’t keep track of to save his life.
John will kill him.
He clears his throat again and looks off across the coffee shop, pretending to read the chalkboard menu that is hanging behind the counter.
He was too far gone to care that he was being pulled apart by everything going on in his life. All he cared about was what was growing inside of him, getting bigger with each passing day, becoming more and more
“I know, John,” Lestrade cut him off. “God, I’m such a prat, for throwing this at you, too. I just wanted you to know that I’m here for you, John, even if Sherlock isn’t. And I’d be willing to give you everything that he isn’t. Because you deserve it John. And you don’t deserve what he’s doing to you. I’ve always thought that.”
But their flat….
Sherlock shakes his head and bites his lip.  “I feel strange, but not sick,” he says, chewing his lip nervously and not looking at John, face red with embarrassment.
“So beautiful, baby,” John whispers into his neck, lips pressed against the abused skin.  He can feel the divot of the chain biting into Sherlock’s flesh.  “Mine.  You’re mine.  Say it.  Say it for me.”
And suddenly there is the wet, warm splash of something hitting the skin of his cheek, the bridge of his nose, the closed cavern of his mouth.  He feels drops of it fall on his forehead and some dribbles down the side of his face, turned upward as it is, to catch in the creases of his ear.
No. Definitely
“Fine,” John said, glowering at the other man.  “What do
At this Sherlock scoffed.  “A
“Well, I think you’ve never been more irresistible,” John said, in what Sherlock had come to know as his ‘bedroom voice’. Usually, that alone was enough to set Sherlock off, but it seemed futile today.
John Watson of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers.  He doesn’t know why, not if it makes him feel like
He thinks that he should probably be somewhat offended because it sounds like there’s an insult hidden in her words, but he can’t be arsed to care about anything other than his ridiculous row with Sherlock right now.
“Touch me, John,” Sherlock begs him, and one of John’s hands drifts down to find Sherlock’s cock pressed up against the side of the worktop, painfully hard, leaking and smearing precome against the table.
John thinks for a moment, weighs his options, and makes a decision.  Still sitting on the sofa with Sherlock staring at him angrily, he holds his arms out to his lover, open wide.  “Come here, love.”
John will never understand how Sherlock does that, but he is completely right again.  John doesn’t need to tell the genius that, though—he already knows.  So instead he explains, “She got pregnant once, a few years ago, but she—we—lost it.  She blames me for the miscarriage, too.  Seems like she blames me for everything lately.”  He tries not to sound bitter but doesn’t think he succeeds much.
By the time John pulls away they are both panting and John’s cock is trying to stir futilely to attention once more.  Sherlock’s head stays twisted at what must be an uncomfortable angle as he continues to stare wide-eyed at John through the shadows of the room.  John isn’t sure but Sherlock looks slightly surprised.
When they are finally settled, John gives him one final kiss and then says, “Okay, I’m going to start now.  Just listen to the sound of my voice, all right?  Don’t think too much.”
John takes a moment to stare at Sherlock in surprise.  Sherlock hardly ever tells him “no” outright.  He will say that he doesn’t want to do something, and he will complain and moan and cry crocodile tears when John forces an issue, but the little boy isn’t usually so brazen as to tell his Daddy “no” when John wants him to do something.
Beside him, John sighed in exasperation. “Come on, Sherlock, we’re already out. What could it hurt?”
the term without cringing slightly) is nothing to hide away, nothing to feel badly about.  Nothing that the two of them can’t share together.  However, John has always had his reservations.  Until recently, when Sherlock helped him see just how fun it could be to finally give in.
(or blind), after all—but never with sort of…all-consuming urgency.
“Sherlock,” John chastised, his tone still very, very nonjudgmental. “It’s not that bad—you definitely won’t have to go out in your pajama bottoms, at least. Look, come here.”
Sherlock’s voice suddenly cuts through his train of thought, ragged and completely wrecked.  He is panting heavily, hands scrabbling at the sheets as John mercilessly pushes three fingers as deep into his body as they can go, just to see how far Sherlock can take him.  “John, I can’t wait any longer.  Please.  Please say that I’m ready.”
“I meant what I said, Sherlock,” John tells him, voice a soft whisper in the small room.  They are alone for the moment and John takes the opportunity to pull the brunet close to him, protectively.  This is the first time he has been so close to Sherlock yet it feels comfortable, natural.  “You don’t have to tell me what happened if you don’t want to.  But I think I can make an educated guess.”  He brings a hand up to Sherlock’s face to brush a wayward curl out of his eye, careful not to touch the swollen flesh.  “I’ll still help you any way that I can—of course I will—but it would be nice to know for sure what kind of help I may need to provide for you.”
And before Sherlock had time to react—to even think—all three of them grabbed him about the arms and pushed him into the entry way of an alley a few feet from where he had been standing on the sidewalk.  Once out of the direct line of sight from the people walking out on the street, one of the men took the opportunity to hit him over the head with a thin metal pole that he had pulled out from the waistband of his trousers while the other two held him still, rendering him speechless and barely conscious in the few precious moments when he could have still called out for help while he was in hearing distance of someone.
For a split second, Sherlock thrusts even deeper, almost impossibly so, and John can’t help the choking noises and coughs that erupt within him as Sherlock mercifully pulls out of his mouth, finally giving him the chance to inhale air properly and catch his breath again.  But he isn’t allowed his reprieve for too long—he is immediately turned and pushed harshly face first into the floor of the sitting room.  He falls ungracefully forward, spinning on his knees.  His tied hands are only barely able to keep him from smashing his face against the hardwood, although not entirely.  He is too busy still trying to regain his breath to protest as Sherlock’s hands grab him around the hips and tug his waist upwards, letting him tuck his knees underneath his torso, arse in the air and completely exposed.
