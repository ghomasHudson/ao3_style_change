Castiel sits across from Sam, who is ensconced in the library like a fish in water. Despite purportedly researching components for a spell that has intrigued Sam, Cas is mostly enjoying the silence and quiet camaraderie. Sam appears deep in thought, while Cas is happy to simply skim through books. The one he’s currently enjoying has interesting ideas about blood warding that would be groundbreaking if they weren’t all based on a flawed understanding of physics. Cas smiles to himself. Humans have always been such fascinatingly curious creatures. Even starting from faulty assumptions, the author arrives at some clever conclusions. Cas mostly enjoys his zest for the subject.
Leaning forward in his chair, he rests his hands in between his legs and dangles the beer bottle at his fingers. He feels his shoulders rise up, and then he pushes them back down.
and is too boggled for any reaction other than to listen to the next set of lyrics.
Dean rewinds the song again, listens to
“This one did not make you happy.”
They somehow manage to be dry and runny at the same time. Dean’s scrambled eggs are always fluffy perfection. Sam still thinks about that egg white omelette Dean made; despite his best efforts, Sam hasn’t found anything as good since.
‘No,’ he thinks as he coats the bones in salt and kerosene. ‘The hunt isn’t the problem — uh, situation.’
“All the Knights of Hell are dead.” Castiel says, with a slight frown. Dean stops himself from adding ‘except me’ at the end of that sentence, but only because he’s distracted by a fluttering of wings down the line.
A horrible heat builds behind Dean’s eyes. He closes them like that would protect him at all. Like anything could protect him now.
No one really talks while they rip apart breakfast. Even Jody and Donna are too busy devouring their meal. Kaia smacks Claire's hand away from her plate, so Dean hands her the pan, and Claire mops up the leftover sauce like the feral creature she is.
Eileen isn’t always at the bunker, but her effect is instantaneous when she is. It’s like she de-ages Sam by 10 years. He’s lighter, quicker to smile, and he follows her around like a puppy who just discovered what treats are. It’s embarrassing.
It would be easier. But Cas never asks. He never sinks his hands into Dean’s chest, just curls soft fingers into Dean's hands or cups them around Dean’s cheek. It’s Dean who sways into Cas’s grip, whose hands linger for extra seconds. If he was more whole, he could give that to Cas, and then, at least, he’d know that Cas was getting something out of this.
He can do that one more time. Cas might not be right, but Dean can at least listen. Cas probably knows him at least as well, if not better, than his Dad had. Plus, Cas has the infinite knowledge of the universe or something crammed in his dorky little angel brain. He’s a smart guy. If he’s saying he knows who Dean is, Dean can at least try to listen. That’s an achievable little goal.
slams him right back to the floor of the fucking store room, with nothing to show that Cas was ever there except a bloody handprint on a jacket that he can't make himself wash or throw away.
The song settles to an end and Dean doesn’t rewind it. He can’t find the revelation he’s supposed to have. He just listens to the fading song and drives.
Sam looks down at his phone. He hasn’t responded to Max’s invitation, but he stares at the carefully unopened message on his screen.
The garage is mostly soundproof and far enough from the bedroom that he doesn’t have to worry. He lets Gang of Youths rumble in his ears, and welcomes Baby as a comfortable weight under his hands.
“I have no idea what that is.” Dean confesses, and it pulls a grin to Kaia’s face.
Eileen’s never heard of a Marid before, but she’ll be damned if it doesn’t make sense.
They won, right?
The first says “2. Schoolin’ Life by Beyoncé.” Dean should have figured. Cas really likes Beyoncé. He was honestly surprised she hadn't shown up earlier. The song gets soft at the end, and Dean listens to
has Dean drumming with both hands on the wheel of the Impala.
Last time, she’d been terrified, in pain, alone. This time is different. If she dies, she wants to be thinking about something beautiful. Something comforting.
Dean realizes it isn’t a song, but a poem set to music.
If James isn’t a good father, then Dean must not even register on the scale. He blinks, trying to remember little goals, trying to tell himself that it’s about the trying after all.
“First of all, never ever take romantic advice from Becky. She dated Chuck.” God. She really did date Chuck. Yikes. Poor Becky. Dean should send her a fruit basket or something. Would that be weird?
is piped scorching hot into his brain.
Eileen’s job is to stand firm so that he can.
Beyoncé croons out
“I want to convince Dean.” Cas says, and a few seconds of short reflection reveal it to be true. This is what language he was struggling with before. He wants to meet Dean’s torrent with an ocean. He wants to show the depth of his feeling, the way Dean had with his kiss. He wants to respond to Dean’s sweet kiss in a way that makes Dean’s knees weak with the same overwhelming feeling of being cherished.
So what if it’s too late now? So what if Cas is already gone? Dean can still become this version of himself. Still make himself better. Cas deserves that. Jack deserves that. Sam deserves that. Even when they all leave. He keeps going.
He does what any sane man would do. He stuffs the paper back into his pocket, pulls out the walkman, and rewinds to the beginning of Peacock Dance.
Dean heaves his attention back to the lyrics. He hears
Dean treats himself as if he’s a monster, like if he loosens the cage of his body some horrible darkness will be released.
He stills for a second, allowing the song to wash over him, eyes closed and hands wringing Baby's steering wheel, and he just thinks
He starts the song over again.
A/N: hey, ever wonder what would happen if Dean listened to deeply emotional slam poetry recordings?
You make loving fun. Dean has a fleeting moment where he remembers Dean, before Hell, before everything — heck, before ruining Sam's life at Stanford. Just him alone on the road, Cassie's gentle finger prodding his chest as she said, “Stop making me laugh, I'm trying to seduce you,” like Cassie's laugh hadn't been one of the most beautiful things about her.
It doesn’t take too kindly to the implication that it might not want to kill people.
Dean wakes up the next morning with the sun — a quick way to orient himself to ‘not in the bunker’ — and he catches an hour of silence before anyone else even plays with rising. The first thing he does is grab the walkman from where he had abandoned it in the passenger seat. He slings the headphones around his neck but doesn’t hit play.
Dean chokes on the beer.
Content warnings at the end
Cas is taking phone calls from the bottom of the ocean. Jesus. Dean doesn’t stand a snowball’s chance in Hell.
Somewhat horrifyingly, the conversation turns to some podcast that Cassie is helping produce, and then she’s saying, “You have a really fascinating perspective, Kaia,” and Claire and Dean are watching with numb terror as the two of them trade numbers. Then, Cassie is asking them about their shirts, and Claire is talking about Stand Atlantic, which somehow turns into Claire and Kaia promising to look up Cassie next time they’re near DC.
Cassie’s hand comes out and rests on Dean’s, her wedding band glinting in the harsh light of the diner. When he makes eye contact with her, she has a soft smile. It’s another thing Cassie and Cas share: a kind face.
Dean and Sam, or Sam. Never just Dean. Eileen doesn’t hang out with just Dean.
Dean had tried. Dean had tried to tell his brother he loved him. It felt important. Like it’d be all he had to say to get his point across. But the words had turned to ash in his mouth. He hadn’t been able to do it.
Wait, that’s not right. He has to move his hand. He has to open the fridge. He has to get beer and go and sit out there, and talk with his family, and he has to do it with a smile.
Jody quirks her eyes at the whiskey and glass as she goes to clear it from the table, so Dean says “tiny bit of angel business” as an explanation, which he should have known wouldn’t slide, because suddenly everyone is trying to get clarification and making sure everything is alright.
The Impala is already parked outside of Mo’s Diner when Eileen finally arrives, so she gives herself a few seconds to stare at it. This isn’t going to be weird. Eileen isn’t going to let it be weird. Dean and her are friendly.
Then Dean had yelled at him, berated him for coming, acted like Cas could possibly leave him in such distress.
Her pleased, “I win,” prompts screams for a rematch. Dean, whose loyalty has come under fire, is banned from participating, which suits him just fine. Ferrying plates to the kitchen, he grabs drinks for the adults, a juicebox for Jack — who asked for one — and a juicebox for Claire — who retaliates with a scowl.
The poem ends, but gentle strumming endures as Dean pulls off the headphones, staring out at the field. He tries to wipe his face with dirty hands.
Patience is stronger.
He fetches them both mugs and listens to the tinny sound of drums coming out of Kaia’s headphones.
“Hmm...okay. He’s definitely smart, because we both know you like that.”  Dean realises suddenly that he does have a type, and that type turned out to be ‘secretly an asshole.’ “He’s probably a fighter, too. You need someone who will stand up for you.”
When Cas draws back, the jagged mess of Dean’s heart is in his hands, and Cas is smiling, idyllic, at the pumping mess he holds in his palm. He looks into Dean’s eyes and smiles. Dean, mesmerised by Cas’s joy, smiles back.
One's in California — a salt and burn that any amateur could take — but Dean knows Donna just finished up a vamp’s nest three towns over. She's honestly going to have to drive right over it to get back to Jody and the girls, and it just seems dumb for Dean to suit up when she's going to be done before he even gets there.
“No problem?” He says. Because, what else is he supposed to say? Patience shrugs apologetically.
Weird boys, those Winchesters. God help her, she really likes them both.
“Howdy, Cas.” He tosses out, because he’s an embarrassment. Their staring contest is broken when a young man with curling red hair and a slight build makes himself known from his position behind Cas.
Dean can’t look at the artist or Cas’s little note because Eileen is in the car.
He’s not useless, he tells himself. He has vampires to kill.
And that was it. Excluding that one awful moment when Cas had tried to give it back, they just never spoke about it again. Dean had already said what he'd wanted to say by giving Cas the tape, and it didn't matter that Cas would have no way of knowing that he was being a 12 year old girl and giving the boy he had a crush on a mixtape full of the music his parents fell in love to. Nope, because see, Dean didn't have ulterior motives like that. It was just…music.
Dean and Alex slice up fruit while Jody throws together sandwiches, and lunch is a happy affair, punctuated by the cryptic network of rituals that seem to govern the sisterhood of the household. Then, without really agreeing to it, everyone is heading off to nap, read, or pack.
He’s not strong enough. Or good enough. He’s not — he’s broken. He’s a new animal. He’s all alone.
Dean watches Jack closely. “It's okay, you can touch it.” Jack slides his palm against the brand like he could hold Cas's hand through Dean if he tried hard enough.
Well, one reason. He retreats to the Dean Cave and its comfy chairs. He fiddles out the papers to read “3. I See You by Missio” on one and “I Am A Credible Source.” on the other. Schoolin’ Life is still playing, so he has a few seconds to boggle. Dean would have thought having explanations would make things more clear, but wow, was he wrong.
“How do you two know Dean?” Cassie asks gamely, like a respectable human being.
Other times, it’s like a car accident at high speed or a fall from a great height. Sudden, terrifying, lashwise. Like today. Dean’s voice had come to him, high and thready, barely formed, a desperate edge to it that Cas had never heard before. The longing — Dean’s longing — had slammed into Cas like a physical force.
God, Dean wants to go home. He just wants to go home. He wants people to stop dying. He wants Cas to forgive him, and he wants Sam to be happy, and he wants Jack to have the childhood he deserves.
Dean doesn’t get much time to ruminate on it because the next lyrics are
“The Winchester Prank War is a time honored tradition, Cas. Sam retaliating is half the fun,” Dean squeeks out. He’s proud that it comes out nearly normal. His mouth does a funny thing on Cas’s name, but embarrassingly, that's probably normal enough not to attract notice.
It's catchy. It's no Kashmir, but it's catchy in its own way.
Just in a shirt. No blazer, no trenchcoat. Just slacks and a white shirt.
His frostiness is cool enough to draw Sam’s eyes up from the book he’s reading.
Cas had explained to Jack how to turn it off, how to block out those frequencies. Cas can stare directly at Dean’s soul for hours, but only after years and years of practice. At first, Jack had seemed pleased, but he’d quickly slipped back into melancholy.
But that was long ago, buried beneath another hundred years of mistakes. That’s sort of the point. He liked boys before Hell, and he liked men after. He likes sex, touch, comfort. That’s nothing new.
A/N: Non told me to add content warnings to this if necessary but I am stupid so TW: Dean has feelings about stuff, Cas also has feelings about stuff. I don't think anything is too wild but my bar is pretty high.
Eileen looks down at her jumble of notes, her open journal, and the two mugs of coffee (both hers, one way too cold, one currently too hot) and manages to resist the urge to tidy up in case Dean walks in the door.
“Jody said that I should ‘let loose’ when I’m at home and with my family. Taking off one’s uniform is a way to separate being at work and being at home, she says.” Dean’s going to send her a fruit basket, or maybe a bomb. He’s not sure. It depends on how many brain cells he has at the end of the week. “I don’t have a uniform,” Cas adds, which is hilarious because Cas absolutely has a uniform, but sure. “But I wanted to demonstrate that I am happy and comfortable at the bunker.”
Dean’s brain/mouth filter is a little fucked right now. Cas is fiddling with his shirt sleeve, exposing acres of pale flesh. Dean’s never wanted to kiss the inside of someone’s elbow before. He’s not dealing well.
Dean slams on the walkman headphones. Smashes play. Sits on his bed and takes breaths that are exactly 7 seconds in and 7 seconds out, perfect in their deliberacy and little else. The tape picks up where he left it, but Dean can’t hear anything over his own careful counting until he mistakenly syncs to the rhythm of Oh Honey telling him to take his time.
Dean really, truly, honestly cannot figure out how his life ended up like this. Castiel looks peeved. “Are you —” There is no way. Come on. “Are you jealous?”
“Hunting?”
Dean’s never deserved anything Cas did for him. He’s not sure why it’s hitting him so hard that there won’t be any more.
He lets the song play through. Castiel is in love with him. Dean is in love with Castiel. He's never going to be able to listen to Taylor Swift again and not think of Castiel in the passenger seat, grumpily putting on a cheap cowboy hat and rumbling, “I'm your Huckleberry.”
has Dean’s hand shooting off the wheel to the tape deck.
“You haven’t done anything wrong,” Dean asserts. She hasn’t, and she should know that. “This isn’t your fault.”
As an angel, thousands of years before even the idea of Dean existed, Cas had protected the birth of a baby from a lineage in which Heaven held a vested interest. The mother had suffered in the birth — wracked with pain, coated in sweat — but she hadn’t cried out at any point. When she felt herself fading, she had prayed, softly, not for herself, but for her child, for the strength to complete the delivery. So complete had her faith been, not in God, but in her fellows, that she did not worry if her child would know pain, would suffer under God’s plan. She believed completely that her siblings, her husband, her people would protect her daughter, as they had protected her. Castiel himself had carried out the blessing, as the birth was on a Thursday. He had carefully corrected the child's pulmonary atresia, the weakness in her bones, the sallowness of her skin. He’d left the tiniest touch of his grace in her, so that she would grow healthy and hale.
“Dean?” Sam says worriedly as he walks into the kitchen. For an entry line, it lacks a certain level of inspiration. Dean’s done more with less.
Dean thinks of Eileen, in the bunker, on hunts with Sam, laughing. He thinks of Eileen, hunted by the hellhound, stalked by a silent and invisible predator. He sees her body strewn aside and ripped to ribbons like a discarded chew toy, her only crime being an attempt to do good in the world. Rage crashes over him like the screeching metal of a collision. She was dragged to hell for no sin, hunted for no deal. She spent time in Hell, as a ghost, and for what?
Dean’s humming reaches the end of the song, and he remembers
“Jeez, I'm sorry! If I'd known you were going to find out about them, I'd have left them in your bed.” Dean weirdly thinks that would be preferable. He doesn't like having a dirty kitchen. It's reasonable, he thinks, to do your dishes as soon as possible. You never know when you're going to end up on the road for 2 weeks, and mold is the MOST disgusting thing they've ever fought.
It doesn’t answer any of Dean’s questions.
Cas though — Cas kept being around. Came back. Kept throwing himself into danger for the Winchesters. For Dean. Had the audacity to apologise for everything, including Jack, like that had been anything other than Dean’s own fucking fault. He had looked at Dean and said, “I left, but you didn’t stop me,” like Dean had ever been the kind of person who was strong enough to ask Cas to stay.
rather than
It’s little steps towards becoming human again.
His breathing is getting loud. He has to breathe quietly or Dad will —
Somehow, they were fighting. Dean dismissed him with that cold, blunt tone, said he didn’t need him. Cas knew it wasn’t true — knows that Dean loves him — but his own hackles had risen in response. It had felt impossibly cruel. Even knowing he didn’t mean it, even seeing how much Dean was still in pain, Cas’s confusion had given way to anger until he stormed out.
Dean startled slightly, clawing the shape of Sam’s brother out of the hollow dark. Sam had lost Jack, and Cas, and Mom, but Dean was still here, and Sam wasn’t going to let him go without a fight.
He’s not in Hell. He was saved.
Why is he even in there? He doesn’t have to eat. Lord knows he can’t cook for shit.
Dean knows he’s a violent man.
But Dean hadn’t been strong enough to keep Cas at arm’s length. Castiel had said, “Maybe it’s time for me to move on,” and Dean had let that fuel the anger. He’d been silent through, “You used to trust me,” like trusting Cas wasn’t one of Dean’s most reliable weaknesses. Hadn’t responded to, “I’ve tried to talk to you over and over,” since Dean’s stoic silence was only uncommon to Castiel. After, “You don’t care,” he hadn’t explained that Dean caring was exactly the problem.
A/N: The parasocial emotions are A Doozy this morning, but, uh, pls enjoy Dean having a lot of feelings about things?
So, everything is pretty much normal. Except that Dean carries the walkman with him everywhere, and when he gets angry or tired or can’t remember why anyone keeps him around, he slides the headphones on and lets 18 songs stand as proof that someone loves him on purpose and wants him around. He knows Cas catches him singing along to it in the kitchen more than once, but he just smiles fondly.
a few more times.
Content Warning: brief mention of suicidal thought, reference to Dean's time in Hell
He listens to the singer say
croons above it.
Cas’s only consolation for having somehow miscalculated this conversation so completely is that Sam seems equally confused by this turn of events. Sam continues while Cas marvels at how Dean somehow makes talking about these things easy. “Dean is the best man I’ve ever known, and every mistake he’s ever made has been because he was trying to do the right thing. If you can’t see how good he is, then you should just…you can…” Sam trails off, either because the absurdity of that concept caught up with him, or more likely because the lack of suitable threats stifled his speech.
(See the end of the chapter for
They make it to their destination in record time, not that their destination is much of anything —  just a strip of road where some of the bodies were found. The scenes are too weather torn and tire trod to be of much use, but they don’t have any other leads.
Okay. Fantastic. This isn't a romantic mixtape — it's just music that Castiel likes. Stuff that makes him think about what they've been through. That's good. That's a relief. Dean sips his coffee and rewinds the song one more time so he can just…enjoy it without panic. It's catchy.
. Unbidden, Dean thinks of Sam. Sam, who he carried out of a fire, who he carried out of Hell, who he carried out of a normal life. Sam, who carried him out of Apocalypse world, who pulled him back from Hell, who made Dean remember there was a point to having a life.
older. She’s your older sibling and you should listen to her.”
And suddenly, Dean is angry. He pulls it over his shoulders like a well-worn leather jacket. What gives Castiel the right? He knows how Castiel found Taylor Swift — Dean fucking
“Shut up.”
Sam’s face lights up, but he has a tendency to think his way out of good things.
He can’t tell Cas that
It’s not often Castiel remembers that Dean is taller than him in this form, but he’s going to remember it now.
Sam is wearing Bitch Face #13, which roughly translates to “you’re an asshole and I don’t know why I forgot that” when he snipes back with, “It’s kimchi, Dean. And it’s made with cabbage.”
The next song starts with a heavy beat, someone says “Blackpink!” and the rest is
so Dean faces the whiplash that comes from confronting both “Castiel is in love with me” and “Castiel wants to bend me over the kitchen counter and RAIL ME,” not only between songs, but also between verses. The song slides into a loving croon for the chorus, and Dean is again perusing mental images of what it might be like to have Castiel's fingers in his mouth. Dean grips his beer bottle so tightly that the paper label slides off.
Dean’s never going to be able to give Cas what he needs.
Plus, Dean's not a total moron. He see's how
Listen. Don’t knock it until you’ve tried it.
With the stimulus available, Dean can either think about Eileen in his passenger seat or Cas pumping out of his speakers. Thinking about Eileen makes his heart hurt, but thinking about Cas makes him want to drive off the road, and he’s not going to take risks with her life like that.
Cas is at once the most familiar thing to him in the universe and the most strange. Dean’s never going to understand all of Cas, never going to know perfectly what makes him tick, never going to understand the total landscape of Cas’s being.
Because he knows it will drive Claire nuts, he then rolls down the window after he’s gotten Baby started up.
Cas. Cas smiling down at Dean, leaning over to push their soft lips together, smiling at Dean and saying ‘I love you,’ not because he has to, not because he’s out of time, but because he wants to. Filling Dean with the searing light of his grace until there isn’t anything dark left in him.
“Zadkiel is kinda a mouthful, honey.”
It's fun. The movie is undoubtedly dumb, but Dean is a little helplessly charmed by it. Jack’s enthusiasm is catching, and Cas seems to like it, which was sort of the point. Dean decides it’s a good night. Sam and Jack beg off after the movie, but Dean confesses to Cas after that he'd also bought the sequel, so the two of them stay up and watch that. At some point in the middle of it, Cas's hand curls around Dean's wrist and just…stays there. After the movie, Dean is sleepy, a little punch drunk, and desperately wanting to curl around Cas to sleep on the couch forever — but that would be murder on his back, and Cas doesn't want that.
“Dean Winchester. I
his brain supplies. Because it hates him, it follows up with
Cas lifts his palm away and shifts to stand against the table instead. Dean wants to grab his hand and put it back. Dean wants to put his hand on Cas's hand, on his chest, on his cheek. Dean doesn't want to have to deal with the fact that Cas came back and now Dean wants and wants and wants.
is paired with the knowledge that Castiel rebuilt his body after he'd flayed himself apart in Hell, or if he's just nearly 40 and having an actual heart attack.
Immediately, the mood is happier, but it doesn’t intrude too much on the quiet of Dean's mind. Not even when the beat picks up. He barely picks up any of the lyrics until
The author labors over his subject, crafting gentle prose that belies a soft care despite the harshness of the material. It’s nice. Affectionate. Loving, even.
So, Dean wants to join her hunt. That’s fine. Dean has a reputation of being an excellent hunter. She’s been on hunts with Dean before.
Cas tilts his head suddenly, probably picking something up on angel radio, and Dean runs through the whole conversation. He tries to deduce what went so horribly wrong, figures it was probably right around when Cas had said, “I’m the one who gripped you tight and raised you from perdition” and Dean had proceeded to stab him. However, every moment that followed was a strong contender.
He can create himself. According to Cas, he’s done it before. Who says he can’t do it again?
Dean carries old bones of a kind, just not ones that he can salt and burn. But, he can do better.
Kaia shoots him a look that reminds Dean that, despite everything else, she is basically a teenage girl, and Dean is an ancient husk of a man.
Which brings Dean to this weekend, where he’s standing out in the bright sunshine, finishing up on building. Sam had offered to come help the first weekend, but he’d spent the whole time on the shore
Sam has his eyes lowered, his shoulders hunkered in like anything could make him not look like the 6’4” behemoth that he is. It works better than it should. Dean readies himself for a lecture. He slides the headphones off his ears and onto the desk. Distantly, he can hear a tiny voice saying
“Dean,” said the angel, and it's not really his name — it's just a place Castiel is stopping before he strides into a speech. Castiel says
. Dean Winchester, starter of the apocalypse, has a standing Tuesday game night which is…honestly, nice. It’s fun. They have to remember to confiscate Claire's weapons at the door after the Great Pictionary Stand Off, but other than that, it's…fun. Safe. Jack clearly loves it.
The singer chants
Eileen laughs.
The next song starts and he doesn't know it. The woman's voice is pretty, and Dean isn't really focused on the lyrics because he was honestly distracted by wondering where Castiel is finding all this music. How does he even know this artist? The song has a little techno break before the singer starts again. He flips through his pocket to find the card where Cas had diligently written the song names and artists. Who the fuck are the Chainsmokers? More importantly, how does Cas know about them?
Wait, a spare? Does Dean wear reading glasses? Eileen gingerly swaps her sunglasses for the newer pair, squinting in the sunlight.
Calmly walking out of the car, calmly walking out of the parking lot in the middle of nowhere, and calmly finding a place where no one would even think to look for him.
Even when the famine had come, when her aunt struggled to feed her own children, the girl was protected and loved. Alone in the universe, the first of her kind, beloved by her family, honored by her people.
Dean flicks off the tape. Staring at the road, he lets himself drive in silence for an hour.
. It's about being in between two dueling choices.
Dean racks his brain and tries to pick Zadkiel out of the hundreds of rotating angels that Cas talks about. “Zadkiel…” he says to buy time, but then he remembers. “Isn’t that the angel who asked if Heaven could have purple magpies?”
If they have a prescription, it’s not very strong.
It's pretty. Atmospheric. Honestly, it makes Dean think of streetlights and standing on the road and Castiel softly asserting, “We had an appointment.” So, Dean, like, gets it — he thinks. He's not smart like Cas and Sam. He's not going to understand Vivaldi's Four Seasons or anything. But this isn't some fancy composition. It's just a nice song.
“Dean!” a voice bellows. Dean looks up to see Castiel touch down in the field, several paces to Dean’s left — exactly where Baby had been parked in this field nights before. Cas swings a wild circle, scanning the field before his eyes settle. Before he makes eye contact with Dean.
Dean is bored.
The main event comes out, and Claire and Kaia shoulder their way to the front of the crowd, so Dean posts up at the bar for a better vantage point. The singer grabs the mic to sing about Coffee at Midnight, multi-color lights fanning out behind her. Despite himself, Dean finds himself nodding his head along to the song. Hard not to get behind a song about coffee.
Eileen taps his arm every now and then until Sam hands her a caramel, but mostly they drive in comfortable silence.
It hadn’t worked.
Dean swallows
“Sure. But...you know where the guest rooms are, if you just wanna crash. Cas can take you wherever in the morning, if you need.”
Dean makes him feel —
He was raised in a car, not a barn.
Dean doesn’t know what to say, or what to do. This feels like a conversation Patience should be having with Jody, who's good at these things. Or Donna, who can make anyone smile. Or even Sam, who might be smart enough to get what’s going on. Really, anyone other than Dean. He thinks about reaching out to Patience, but he isn’t sure how that’d be received. He catches a drip of melting whipped cream as it slides down the side of his mug instead.
Castiel is back in the bunker by the time regret catches up. It’s a short flight — less then a second — but shame moves quickly, obliterating anger and annoyance and fear. He looks down at his hand and tries to think.
Eileen: tucked under Sam’s arm, laughing. Claire: safe and satisfied. Kaia: unhaunted. Patience: undivided. Alex: unafraid. Jody and Donna: at rest, unworried about things that lurk, and stalk, and threaten their family.
Nope. This is fine. Dean's fine. He doesn't need to make a list of nice human experiences that Cas is missing. Cas is fine. Cas is here.
and try to keep rational thoughts in his brain.
Castiel made him a mixtape. Castiel made him a mixtape and smiled at him happily and said, “This is for you,” and tossed it to him like he didn't just drop a live grenade into Dean's lap.
Cas bit back the instinctive desire to fly into Dean’s room and haul him out of it. He knew it wouldn’t help, so he focused on what would. Cas remembered Dean’s grief as Jack was dying, the way he couldn’t — after everything — pull the trigger on the gun, despite Chuck’s insistence. A lot of baggage was settled there, but a lot of love rested beside it. However, Jack had specifically asked how Cas could know, if Dean wasn’t saying it. That, at least, Cas could answer.
Cas resolves himself, greets his anger, and lets it pass. He’s worried about Dean, who was so clearly upset. That’s no reason for him to be snappish. Cas will make peace with him, and things will return to being good.
Dean rewinds the track, listening again. It definitely is.
Dean watches Jody out of the corner of his eyes, sees the quiet, fierce pride with which she regards them. He thinks about how casually she can reach down to kiss Kaia on the forehead or nudge Patience’s books down, how she tells Alex she’s proud of her, how she tells Claire that she loves her: how she gave these girls a house, and in short order, a home.
“4.94441 by 172.48046.” Dean tries to do some mental math about where those coordinates are and just gets not in America.
A/N: Non wanted to leave you guys at the cliffhanger of Sam getting the emergency text last week - you're welcome for not letting her do that -Yar
It’s that bad.
“Uh no. It’s a —” Sam scrambles for the appropriate word. “— witch thing.”
He points his gun to the floor.
Dean slides into the front seat of Baby. Claire and Kaia stare at him.
In retrospect, Dean thinks that was one of the moments that slid a ladder into the dark empty hole that hid his heart at the bottom.
Dean zones out of the conversation slightly as Cassie tells him a funny story about her, Rob, and a nearly lost luggage in a Berlin train station. He just enjoys Cassie being alive and well. Claire seems to have recovered from her temporary insanity and laughs at all the right parts of the story, while Kaia uses this distraction to her advantage to scoop up Claire’s hashbrowns.
“Yeah? He need a — whatever you call it, a second, or something? Or is this more theoretical stuff?” Dean replies, looking to Sam with easy-going curiosity, like the biggest issue he could possibly have is whether or not Sam will be around for dinner so he doesn’t mistakenly make too much food.
This shouldn’t be hard.
The first thing she did with her new body was punch Max in the face.
Jack is deceptively strong, too. Dean freezes.
“Cas!” Dean pleads in desperate warning. He starts, but then finds he has no good way to end that sentence.
Dean’s grief split open. Stepping out of it, he had pulled Sam into a fierce hug, as if Sam was still small enough to smush into Dean’s chest. “Okay,” Dean murmured. “It’s okay, Sammy. I won’t. I promise.”
lie. Not to further your own selfish crusades. Not to me, not to yourself.”
Eileen slams her hand on the detonator. The grenade inside the Marid’s head explodes, sending Isabelle crashing against the wall.
This might be because Dean walked by his room 3 days ago and saw him carefully placing Blue on his bed, right on top of his cleanly cornered sheets. Their eyes had met, and because Dean is sometimes the greatest older brother in the world, he hasn’t said anything.
“That’s not the same thing.”
pull apart his ribcage again.
Baby sings
“What?
Jesus H. Christ. Dean spins so quickly he almost knocks the pasta off the stove, and then there is the brief panic of righting the pot.
Cas opens his mouth, and Dean’s not going to lie: he’s very interested in how the fuck Becky became involved in Dean’s tragedy of a love life, but priorities. He remembered what was actually important to talk about. Unlike Castiel, Dean knows how to respond to the right part of a question.
Except.
Nothing matters as much to Sam as Dean does.
Anyone who said ignorance isn't bliss never had to deal with being the last person to figure out you’re dating someone. Things had been good these last couple of months. Really good. Like, weirdly good.
Cas is saying:
Then, he stops himself from stopping. Carefully rewinding, he carries himself to the beginning of Angels Of The Get Through and lets himself listen. He lets his heart fill with caulk and duct tape instead of teeth and knives. He allows the sharp edges to scrape notches into his ribs, cut his vocal cords on their way out. He lets the words hollow him out.
“You shouldn’t,” Dean says in a near whisper, a last desperate attempt. It lacks any kind of punch. Too true, Dean supposes.
On his fifth listen, Dean gives up. He’s not going to figure it out.
Dean, fist uncurling, pulls himself off of Baby’s frame, makes his feet walk to the door, slides past the bunker’s wards — they don’t have anything that keeps Dean out — and walks in.
Cas had also asked Dean not to get in the box. Cas had also searched for a cure for the Mark. Cas apparently wanted Dean to live — that was the only thing he asked for.
The girls stay late into the night, but not as late as they could. Dean shadows them, tripping and giggling to their motel room. Sparing a second to check that the warding is still up, he sees Claire put out protective hexbags, but he then books it to his own room on the other side of the building because
Dean throws the headphones across the room.
For Leave It All Behind, the paper reads “12. Legacy.” Dean has no idea how that relates. He still has no idea what the song is trying to say. He remembers a brief moment, when he thought maybe Jack would be their legacy. That the world would be safe, and they could retire and enjoy just living in it.
We Move Lightly comes on immediately, and thank the universe for self-rewinding tapes. It's not enough, it's not enough of a distraction but it gets him off the floor and to his bed, where he grabs his gun from under the pillow and squeezes it into his hands. It's comfortable and cold and he's a cry baby who needs his blanket, but he does feel better. He feels better. He adjusts his grip, and he's able to hear
They’re obviously close enough to hear, because Claire shouts an indignant, “Hey!” Dean shoots Sam a nonsense text asking him if the nail gun was left in the garage as they finish their approach.
He closes the door to his room behind him. His room. He has a room and a soft bed and a family, and everyone is safe and happy. They’re free and safe and Dean Winchester is falling apart.
Dean’s quiet surprise after each affectionate act Castiel proffers, no matter how small, means that Cas hopes to tell Dean “I love you” in some form every day for the rest of creation.
Cas: full of funny stories about how various angels were faring. Dean: hyper-aware of whenever Cas was near him.
Sam shrugs, because he has no idea, and she laughs.
No content warnings here!
Dean hits play on the tape and sits down. Staring out over the lake, he gives Cas’s mixtape the attention it deserves.
distracted. He knows exactly what thought he keeps revisiting. “And you keep doing that.” Sam adds.
He manages to sign out a quick “Ask him about Sandy,” even though he has to finger spell Sandy. Dean is a champion, and Eileen loves to ask Sam embarrassing questions. Fortunately, Dean knows so much embarrassing stuff about Sam, like Sandy being the stuffed dog Sam owned and loved to death when he was 6, who had honestly been disgusting because Sam rarely relinquished him long enough for Dean to sneak a wash in. Sam had been attached to that thing for a year, treating it like a real dog half the time. John had thrown Sandy out while they were at school, when he’d packed up the boys’ stuff to move them to the next town. Dean doesn’t really blame him — the thing had one eye and more bald spots then Professor X at that point. Plus, Sam hadn’t really seemed surprised when the dog went missing. He didn’t even ask where Sandy was when they unpacked at the next motel.
Dean pushes the breath out of his chest. Sam looks ready for Dean to take a swing, his shoulders bundled by his ears, eyes carefully down like not seeing it coming will make it hurt less.
A/N: Fluency in ASL (as in most languages) takes years for most people, and Dean's opinions on what a person can and should be able to do on their own should never EVER be trusted.
And then, Dean — because he’s not a coward, except for all the times that he’s a coward — takes a miniature leap off a cliff and says, “They’re very, uh, romantic.” Cas smiles, so Dean continues, softer and more honest. “It’s maybe the most romantic thing anyone has ever done for me.”
She grins even though no one can see it.
He figures, if he can't find it — well, Cas can always magic one up. At some point, they'd all executively decided that Jack shouldn't be throwing around his God powers on whims, and they're trying to stick to that, but he also knows Cas would move Heaven and Earth to give Jack something he wants.
brings Cas to mind, so flustered by a simple kiss and a simple pet name.
even though Dean himself only ever got to see parts of it. Cas'll like it. He rewinds to Hymnals and lets the two songs carry him to town, laughter at the edge of his mouth like a smile.
Dean slides on the headphones and restarts the song. He shoots a text to Sam to let him know he found the nail gun. Staring at the lake, he doesn’t think about Cas drowning or leaving. Doesn’t think about Sam afraid, alone, or dying. Doesn’t think of Jack with Dean’s gun in his face.
“1. Light of humanity.” Still there.
It’s a sentiment he understands. It’s Sam telling him not to get in the box. It’s Sam hunting for a cure to the Mark even after Dean told him to stop. It’s Sam saying, “It’s the only thing in the whole word I could always count on. It’s the only thing I’ve ever known that was true.”
Dean’s not even surprised. The song is nice and pleasant and Dean’s only real objection is
Everyone laughs, and the conversation moves away. Dean catches Kaia and Claire texting each other a few times, which is somehow extremely cute — even with the conspiratorial grins they share. Everyone breaks up after dinner, and Dean spends a quiet evening with Jody and Donna on the porch, watching the girls run around in the lawn.
“No. That would be reductive. I love you —” How does he say that so easily? “— because I am me, and you are you. I could no sooner stop loving you than you could stop being Dean Winchester.”
Depending on schedules, the girls, Jody, and Donna all variously pop in for game night. And Dean does mean Pop In, literally. They live too far away to drive down, but Jack is always delighted to go get them.
Claire and Kaia are sitting in stunned silence, but Cassie laughs easily and says, “Oh Dean, you really haven’t changed.” Dean doesn’t open his mouth to say how deeply, disgustingly not true that sentence is, but only because Dean’s seriously contemplating a vow of silence after the nightmare that just came out of his mouth.
Dean re-examines that thought. In both ways, it turns out. Dean repeats the song.
He stands up.
Sam looks down, and his face is all hard resolve. It’s him when he’s twelve saying, “I know dad’s not coming home,” and it’s him at 17 saying, “I’m going, Dean, you can’t stop me,” and it’s him before shooting Madison and before choosing to remember Hell.
This step takes more time because it requires convincing Dean that he wants to set up with a sniper rifle instead of knocking on the door, but the challenge is mostly finding a nest Dean thinks is appropriate. Dean has been happy to do this hunt the Eileen way, but he also has opinions about what makes a good nest. Eileen doesn’t mind. She’s not the one taking the shot.
But now she has Sam. And Jody and Donna, who are constantly trying to get her to ditch game night for wine night. And Cas, who perfectly rivals her in snark and wit.
Oh yeah. If Cas wants to drop secret tokens of affection, he’s got another thing coming. Dean’s a fucking ninja.
retire. Just, take fewer cases, maybe? We could run the phones like Bobby used to.”
Sam’s countenance takes on a wry smile. “And then Lucifer again, and finding a way to deal with Michael, and then, uh, the whole thing with, well – God.” Dean snorts.  A barebones if accurate summary of the shittaccular last decade of their lives. “Like, usually, when we’re hunting, there’s some big horrible thing that we’re gunning for, even when we’re just cleaning out a vamp nest or something, and now there’s...” Sam stalls out.
(See the end of the chapter for
Fuck, it’s a new song.
“You like pie of all kinds, and you love your family so much that you taught Castiel what it means to have a family. You said that pain had meaning, but work to always lessen it for others. You drive a cool car that you fixed yourself, and you have given your life for this world more than any human could be asked to. You liked my bird idea and you took the time to answer my question.”
Right now, Dean is chopping garlic with the practiced ease of someone who uses knives every day. Sure, maybe that’s not what they usually use knives for, but practice is practice.
The stake out to find the Marid is awkward, but luckily, they find it chilling in the basement loft of Isabelle's stupidly big house. Eileen and Dean had entertained the idea that perhaps the Marid was being held against its will, but the 4K TV and disturbing number of funko pops put that theory to bed. Still, Eileen gives the Marid a chance to explain itself.
“No. Not the — the
“What the actual fuck?”
Sam seems to take pity on Cas’s confused expression. “Don’t worry about it. Also, probably don’t move any mountains. I’m sure that would come back to bite us somehow. As for Dean, well…he’s Dean, y’know?”
On the fourth listen, Dean howls along to lyrics he half knows —
The other thing he can do, apparently, is make breakfast, which he lets distract him until the girls, Jody, and Donna do so themselves. Then, he’s telling Jody that the dock is good to go, which immediately turns into demands that they test it out. After a brief detour of Alex and Patience arguing about whether or not Dean has summer colours (Alex says yes, Patience says colour matching in fashion magazines is a holdover from colorism and has inherently racist roots, but also that Dean should wear more purple to make his eyes pop), Dean (who didn’t bring a swimsuit, let alone a purple one) and Jody sit on the porch chairs they’ve dragged to the dock while Donna and Claire engage in complicated water warfare. Alex and Patience have reconciled by virtue of a common enemy in Kaia, who had mistakenly unveiled her lack of date night plans for her and Claire’s anniversary later this month, and is thus enduring increasingly more ludicrous suggestions while steadily trying to swim farther away.
The song ticks over, and Dean doesn’t sigh in relief when he recognizes the song — he doesn’t. He just... exhales some of the emptiness in his chest.
He thinks about how she never let them down. He thinks, for a second, about Bobby and all the things Dean never told him. He thinks
Dean wipes his hands and moves to the back of the Impala. He rewinds the song — he deserves the reminder — and draws the papers from where he has them holstered in his pocket.
His phone buzzes, and he can’t even make himself look to see who’s calling. Someone could be in trouble, but Dean is sinking his back against Baby, pushing his palms farther into his eyes.
Okay, it is. Dean doesn’t really like it. He also doesn’t dislike it! He’s just sorta...neutral on it. Like elevator music — better than silence, but not usually something you’d pick for yourself.
didn’t grab the groceries they said they would.” The girls are all standing clustered together, so Dean’s not positive who the dirty look is for. Alex is carefully avoiding eye contact though, so that's an even bet.
It’s not that Dean isn’t familiar with this blinding rush of fear — he just has no idea what he’s supposed to be afraid of in his own fucking kitchen.
“Hello, Dean.” Holy fuck. Holy
If it was at all possible, Dean would punch his own brain. ‘That’s what coffee is for,’ he figures with a shrug.
So, he’d ripped his eyes off of Max, looked to Sam, and said, “We can fix this.”
This brings Dean back to his first issue: why did Cas leave Dean a mixtape on his bedside table? When did Cas do it? Weren’t the angel race finals last night? Why didn’t he wake Dean? What the hell is up with the flowers? He could have woken Dean up. Dean would have — nope, actually back up. Dean moves back one thought.
“Wait. When did you talk to Becky?” Hold on, no, that wasn’t the important thing. How did this conversation become about Becky?
that. He could continue being his useless idiotic self if there wasn’t all this fucking pressure to not mess anything up.
Max called a million witches. Sam called Rowena. They’d found a spell that could work, except it required 5 liters of Max’s blood. Everyone had stalled out until Dean had asked if it had to be fresh.
This has the benefit of stopping the music immediately, and provides a satisfying crunching noise as the headphones shatter into the wall in the hallway.
Dean turns her on, flips on the song, and lets it play. He loops it. He plays it over and over again.
Still, Cas had been scared. Worried. It wasn’t like Dean to let his emotions bubble so clearly to the surface, to cry so unreservedly. Dean wore his heart on his sleeve, but those sleeves were carefully tucked under galvanized vambraces, covered in blood warding drawn in Dean’s own careful hand.
She looks at the text again. Seems casual enough. Plus, she knows the boys are used to hunting in pairs. This is probably Dean’s version of being friendly. Probably bored with Sam heading out for the Lunar Ceremony.
do that again.” And he stepped back.
Why is the mental image of Cas getting dressed so much worse?
The second verse starts with
Cas freezes so violently that Dean figures he may as well have shot him. Why did he do that?
Dean pulls out the papers. “9. The Next Right Thing by Kristen Bell.”  For a second, Dean’s confused. He thought the song was from Frozen 2.
He wonders if Cas gets distracted by himself in the mirror, getting dressed. No, wait. Don’t think about Cas getting undressed. Uh, dressed.
Dean flips back to Loving Violence, staring at the strange capitalization. He thinks of Cas saying
But he did convince Dean. He did. It’s hard to let it go now.
Slamming the nozzle back into the gas dispenser with more force than strictly necessary, he tries to shrug off acting like a 4 year old.
He remembers Dean saying goodbye on a car-ride like this. He remembers Dean talking obliquely about how John would send him away when he stepped out of line, but Sam had been too mad and too scared about what Dean was planning to even think about that.
“A lot!” Jack says, honestly and with great feeling.
Eileen, uncertain, snaps a quick selfie and sends it to Sam along with, “Why are these glasses weird?” She’s sure they’re weird in some way. She’s just not sure how. While she waits for Sam to respond, she notices a hint of blue at the edge of her vision. As she turns her head to see it head on, she notices a sparkle of light emanating from the warding on her car.
Dean is objectively the worst boyfriend in the world.
Dean’s in the grocery aisle buying tomatoes before he even lets himself think about that. He’s pulling the lyrics apart in his mind, but he’s not getting any closer to an answer.
The first song is peppy and upbeat and weird, which doesn’t surprise Dean at all, but mostly because he’s come to expect anything at all from these tapes. By the end of the first verse
“Give me your heart,” Cas says, and it’s so easy here, in the haze of want and lust and need, to reply to him honestly. It’s like the words are already there when Dean opens his mouth.
Cas says, “I should probably go.” Then, because he’s not allergic to goodbyes, he waits for Dean to wave him away.
He’s freaking out. He knows he’s freaking out. Hell, Cas had apparently fallen in love with Dean while Dean was kicking him out of the bunker and beating him to Hell and back, so it should be pretty hard to mess this up.
It was like Dean had realised, factually, that he’d never be happy again, but because Sam had asked him to stay, he’d accepted the condition and moved on.
Kaia asks Cassie a question about her jacket, which is clearly an attempt to get the conversation anywhere else, but Dean is too grateful to call her on it. Cassie, mercifully, allows the conversation to move on.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hello, Dean.” Castiel says, 3 seconds later, and presumably several thousands of miles away from where he started the call. Dean briefly worries about the data service fees Cas is probably wracking up.
Here, alone in this room, Dean allows himself to admit a terrifying truth: he loves Cas, and there is no place he’d rather be. He lets himself be weak for just a second.
Which is fine.
He laughs all the way to the highway.
The Impala is something of a Mecca to the Winchesters. More than a car, halfway to a home. Would it be offensive to turn it down? Also, they’re going to the same place, so there’s no reason to take two cars. Eileen’s not attached to any of the weapons stashed in her car safe — just the knife already strapped to her calf.
To Be Alone With You reveals that Cas also knows Dean is a failure of a lover.
From over his shoulder, he feels Cas step closer to his bed — dithering like he might sit down. God, Dean desperately wants Cas to sit down. Almost as badly as he wants Cas to leave. Neither as badly as he wants to figure out what’s wrong with him, but close.
Eileen’s never been someone's first priority. Hell, she doubts she’s ever been someone's second priority. She’s used to it. Still, sometimes, watching Sam and Dean, she thinks that it might be nice. Sam and Dean would both move Heaven and Earth for their little makeshift family. Eileen’s not sure she’s ever merited that much effort from anyone.
- Non
Which is good. Since sometimes, you know, a supernatural evil will break in to beat the shit out of them. Or a non-supernatural British douchebag. Or once, memorably, their own house. It's good to be in yelling distance, is his point. It's always good to be in yelling distance. Dean carefully doesn't examine the part of him that gets itchy and uncomfortable when Sammy isn't in yelling distance. Or when Cas is —
Unbidden, she remembers a story Sam told her about being cast in a play for school, about how John hadn’t approved of it as an extra-curricular. Dean had fought for them to stay in that town till the play went up. Dean had picked Sam up from every rehearsal, and had then shown up to opening night with a sluggishly bleeding chest wound because he hadn’t wanted to miss curtain. Dean had given Sam a little plastic rendition of an academy award, even as he’d made fun of Sam tirelessly. Sam said he’d kept that plastic toy for years, until it had burned into mush in his dorm room.
Wildly, this reminds Sam that the only person to ever set a curfew for him was Dean. There was also a weird period when Sam was somewhere between 6 and 10 that Dean got strangely militant about bedtime. Sam’s not complaining — sleep is important, as are routines. Distracted, he answers honestly. “No. I want to go.”
By the time the gang traipses in for lunch, everyone is exhausted in the way that only prolonged exposure to sunlight can make you. Claire’s cheeks are a dusted red that smacks of sunburn, but everyone is happy, if a bit sun drunk.
but that thought leaves his mind immediately because
Sam doesn’t think about Dean until the next day, the thought brought on innocuously by the sucky scrambled eggs at the cafe where Eileen and he end up for breakfast.
Dean, who didn't have a plan, and never really has a plan, constructs one real fast because Jack is squeezing Dean's arm like he's got something Holy in him, and he's looking at Dean with Cas's eyes and Sam's fucking puppy dog expression.
She couldn’t see them. She couldn’t see the hellhounds. Dean’s not sure why he’s surprised, because he knows she didn’t make a deal. He just — well, he forgot.
love with him, that was a surprise. What a pesky preposition. Love versus In Love. Cas loved Sam, but he was in love with Dean. Similar in so many ways, but with a slight change, a tiny, insignificant word, so utterly different.
Dean pulls into the bunker halfway through Hold on To Your Life, but it could have been John Cage 4’33” for all that Dean was paying attention. Something is happening in his chest and between his ears, and he can’t really focus on anything other than that.
Dean thinks of Cas's hands, the way he flips the angel blade, and thinks
Cas meanders to the table, and any thoughts he might have about grabbing Cas and making him stay there, of making Cas explain the tape, fly away in the humdrum of making breakfast, then making fun of Sam, then chores, then Claire calling about something that's maybe a werewolf that turns out to be definitely a ghoul. By the time it's 8 PM, they've had a long and totally normal day, and Dean hasn't taken the headphones off his neck, but he also hasn't thought about the mixtape anymore.
But here’s the other thing he remembers: he couldn't pull the trigger.
One hunt and he’s exhausted. Listen to some bullshit poetry and he’s sobbing. In the garage, in the kitchen — Dean’s coming apart at the seams. No wonder everyone is moving onto bigger and better things. It’s not like Dean has a ton to offer. There’s nothing he does that other people can't manage. Hell, half the stuff others do better.
Cas could have said “You love violence.” Instead, he said “Loving Violence.” The capitalization is bugging Dean, too. Cas had been meticulous in his grammar this whole time. What, he just mistakenly capitalized the second word? Cas- “I don’t get words wrong” -tiel? Hell, even ‘Violence loving’ would have made sense.
How do you make friends when you’re 40/80 and also a moron? Dean hits send. Apparently, by acting like a 12 year old girl trying to get invited to a sleepover.
(See the end of the chapter for
After Eileen’s third cup of coffee goes cold on the counter, she thinks to wonder how the monsters are funding their operation. They’d have to coordinate, and they’ve lived here for at least 20 years. It isn’t expensive per se, but it certainly isn’t cheap. Even if they’re squatting, they’d have to avoid detection for a long time. Plus, they’d need eyes in at least a few of the homeless shelters, or some other way to identify victims who are unlikely to be missed.
He hasn’t ever tried to make pie. That should have been the first clue.
Dean has no idea if he's made things better. Jack isn't crying anymore, which seems like a win, and he has a soft smile as Dean fumbles on the flannel and goes to tuck him in again. Dean walks to the door and figures, well — checking never hurt anything.
He hits the hardware store first, and then Cas's weird artisanal bakery where the snooty barista whose name is something French that Dean always forgets looks personally offended when he asks where to acquire a Pillow Pet. Dean tries the toy store, where he strikes out, so he goes to the grocery store, where weirdly they sell not only Pillow Pet unicorns but a slew of other animals as well. He grabs a unicorn for Jack and then what appears to be a blueberry cow for Sam because that's hilarious, and then he grabs the DVD of Mamma Mia and silently wonders if there is anything you CAN'T find in a Super Target.
Just because he knows it’ll make Eileen smile, Dean glances over at Sam, then back at Eileen, then brings two fingers to the bridge of his nose to sign “Nerd”.
A thrumming contentment resounds in Cas’s chest, and he recognizes it: Cas is happy with who he is. He’s made mistakes. Catastrophic, irrevocable mistakes. Nevertheless, looking at this — at the beauty of Heaven and his part in constructing it — he can’t help but be a little proud.
“You don’t — you don’t have to. You can dress however you want, Cas. That’s what being comfortable is,” Dean says. If you let things like this sit, they can get twisted up.
Dean lets himself close his eyes, and drops off to sleep.
He looks back at the paper. He is resilient. Well, he was. He took all of Chuck’s beatings —  metaphorical and literal — and he’s still here. He’s still kicking.
“Hey!” Eileen’s voice breaks through Sam’s thoughts, as do her waving arms. She gives him a questioning look. “You ok?”
The only thing worse than this conversation would be Cas showing up in the middle of it.
“Uhm. Thank you?” Sam says, his tone questioning. Cas plods on anyway. Sam has been the object of Dean’s love for as long as he has existed. A different love, yes, but still, Sam is perhaps the one person who can help Cas find a way to respond.
He just has no idea what Cas is getting at. He listens to
Dean starts trying to make introductions before he realises he has no idea how to do that.
Dean's brain, which really has been doing too much work today in general, stutters right over the idea of “Cas might want sex” into “Cas having sex.” It's 10 seconds of lidded blue eyes, pink bitten lips, and the way that muscles in Cas's neck shift when he's straining before Dean can wrench himself out of that thought process.
Another thing that helps: a new hunt. Apparently, Jesse thinks they might have a small vampire nest a few miles from the ranch. They’re retired (a fact that Caesar had been adamantly rehashing in the background of the call), so they need someone else to take care of it. Dean can do that.
If Dean had been braver, smarter, better, he’d have been able to do something. Or say something at least. Instead, he’d been silent, and he’d done nothing.
“Sam,” he chokes out, but it’s weak, barely scraping past his desperate bid for oxygen. “Sammy.” He tries again. Dean feels the hook claw through his shoulder, pulling him up and open and onto the rack. He feels his knees buckle, hitting the garage floor with shocking pain. It rattles.
“Of course. Sure. You’re a fucking well of emotion. You couldn’t care less what I do.”
Hurtling down the asphalt, she picks up speed, as if to outpace a horde of invisible demons.
“Uh, yeah.” He tries to think about what fucking moment in his life he could have found the time to get married and can’t come up with anything, and says, “Couple years now.”
Dean lets the song slide away as he pulls into the garage. He busies himself with putting the groceries away and lets the lyrics rattle in his head. He thinks
He slides the tape into the walkman, which he nestles in his pocket. He doesn't have headphones, but he doesn't think much about that fact. He has the walkman in his pocket, and his Colt tucked into his belt.
Claire is grinning gleefully. Dean takes the lesser route of two evils.
Dean lets the song peter out. Lets the next song waft in. In classic Castiel fashion, the tone is suddenly soft and wistful, and Dean almost cries in relief when he realizes he's not having a stroke —  the lyrics are fully in a different language.
there isn’t anything in the lake.
Dean remembers this moment. Jack had cried. Cas had reached out and put a comforting hand on his shoulder. Dean had carefully, carefully not looked at Sam, not looked at Cas, not looked at anyone.
Through his gently opened door. Right past Castiel.
He looks at the paper. The next song is Taylor Swift.
They’d been in that horrible slog of grasping at some kind of normal for months, and then Jack and Cas had shown up.
and Dean wonders how, after all this time, after everything he’s done, Cas doesn’t already know the answer to that.
Dean feels a flush of shame sink cold through his chest amidst the welling panic that Cas might not be lying. Dean thinks about Cas, who raised him from Hell and could easily put him back there. Cas saying he was moving on. He thinks about how little he has to offer that could convince Cas to stay.
With a disappointed grimace, Dean stared at his fist, which had failed him again in this ridiculous child's game. Sam didn't seem to think so, though, which was evident from the cunning smile on his face as he waved his open hand in front of his brother's face. Paper wins over rock. Who the hell thought up such nonsense?
When Dean carefully lay down next to the angel, trying to calm his own arousement, he was met by a tired look of pleasure-befuddled blue eyes and a lazy smile from Castiel. His chest gradually rose and fell under the hunter's carIng hand. Dean had never seen such a look from his angel before, so he was mesmerized and shaken, unable to look away, drowning in that alluring blue. When he came to his senses after a few long moments, he was a little confused, and Cas noticed it, despite the languor that enfolded his relaxed body.
Dean shrugged, as if he felt cold, though the room wasn't cold at all. Castiel looked at his face with concern and saw the pain that Dean was trying to mask, but the semblance of a smile that he was trying to hide his sadness with was only a nervous twitch of his lips. He couldn't help but remember with horror how, just like that, a couple of years ago, Cas wasn't breathing, his heart wasn't beating, and the charred traces of his burned wings were spread out on the dusty ground, and Dean was standing over his cooling dead body, helplessly looking up at the indifferent dark sky, as if it could give him back his angel…
— Don't fuss, Dean! Have a rest, — Sam declared with a chucle as he walked down the hall to the stairs.
— Dammit, Sam, just wait! — there was an indistinct noise, a couple of low curses, and the sound of something falling.
— That's right, and it's also a poisonous plant that can cause quite nasty burns, — Sam added, saluting with his mug, — and you're welcome.
— Oh, — Sam said in embarrasement, — you have a penetrating eye. We're sorry…
— Come on, we wouldn't have fallen apart if we worried! Maybe we'd have found a way out by now! Cas, I asked you so many times not to be silent if you're going to do something... like this!
— I think I do, Dean, I get the idea. So, if take this moment… I feel so good with you now, but I've been worried about Jack since we got him back. The magic we used to do that must have a price, and it can be quite high.
— The most difficult part is over for us, — the warlock agreed.
— See? My grace can well replace both breathing and blood circulation. Although it's not worth doing for a long time, so as not to waste it... Dean, what's wrong?
Such as the ones now, at that very moment, turned around behind him, sparkling with blue lights of spreading grace. Huge and beautiful in their primordial power, these wings were even better and stronger than those he had before the fall, and not even a single battle scar remained on them. Startled, Castiel moved first one wing, then the other, and the sunlight shimmered on the glossy black and bluish feathers.
But just as Sam set the items on the smooth, polished surface, there was a sharp thud from under the next table, and the muffled voice of the senior hunter.
— I hate washing dishes, — she said shortly. — Well, Dean, Sam, get some rest, and I need to find a couple of ingredients for the spell. We'll apply it tomorrow, as they say, with a fresh mind. But, Dean... I have to tell you something. If you really want to help your angel regain his wings, then you must have a really deep connection with him, or the spell won't work. Let me take a look…
— Welcome, Dean and Sam, — the host smiled at them, somehow knowing exactly which of the brothers was who. — Don't get up, no formalities, please. Ogden Green, nice to meet you, — and he shook hands with each of them as he sat down in the chair opposite the couch where the hunters were sitting. — You can call me just Ogden.
— Touch your soul? — Cas asked, astonished. — Do you realize how dangerous it is? What are you up to?
...They sat, closely embracing each other, under the dome of the blue-black wings of Cas, which he carefully covered his beloved. Opening his eyes, Dean stroked the soft flexible feathers, and the angel's wings quivered slightly with pleasure.
— Dean, look at me, — Castiel lifted Dean's pale face and gently touched his lips to his forehead. — I understand you, I will not leave you again, do you hear? I love you... always loved you, no matter what! Dean…
Love... When the angel who dared to defy Heaven finally realized what was happening to him, it was too late to retreat. He tried to overcome this such a human feeling, unseemly to soldier of God, that made him vulnerable, leaving and pushing Dean away more than once, but coming back again. The weak sprout took strong roots, grew a dense crown, and blossomed into a magnificent flower.
— Speak of the devil, — Dean chuckled, answering the phone. — Hey, Sam, what's up? Did you miss me? We'll be right…
— Call and say hi from me. I think they'll help you.
— Dean... more... I want more... — Cas whispered obliviously. His hot hand closed over Dean's fingers, begging him to continue the luscious sensation.
— I lied then, Cas, I lied! — Dean interrupted, grinning awkwardly and catching his hand. — My digestion is fine. I just...
— Ogden, Mattie… If you need anything from us as hunters or anything else, —  Dean began as he and Sam said good-bye to the welcoming couple on the porch. The warlock and the angel held hands and smiled warmly at the brothers.
— Dean! — the angel interrupted his discursive tirade, squeezing his forearm soothingly. — Wait, let me say something.
The sorceress took another sip and turned away again, resting her elbows on the bar.
— And you woke it up when Jack woke you up with his call, right? — Dean winced, imagining his own feelings when he had to wake up suddenly. — I'd be mad, too, and I'd pick a bone with you if I were it. If the Shadow has bones, of course.
— Wow, good reaction! You're like Bruce Lee! — Dean surprised and for figurative comparison mimicked the sound that the famous fighter made in the movies, knocking down another ferocious enemy. However, in the older Winchester's performance, it was a little like the scream of a cat who has been stepped on its tail.
— You have a nice home, Ogden, — Sam complimented the warlock's house, looking around as Dean sniffed the delicious smell of home-cooked food wafting from the kitchen.
And when Cas nodded silently, Dean threw both arms around him, pressing his cheek against Cas'.
Dean's lips twitched in a sly smile. The angel's words made his head spin even more, and those unspeakably blue eyes lured him like an ocean beckoning to plunge into its bottomless depths. Dean's hands slid over the angel's knees and began to rise higher, growing bolder with every inch they crossed, and his right hand gently touched the swelling bulge under the fly of Cas' trousers.
— But you forgave him that time, didn't you? — Dean frowned, sensing her resistance, but continued this hard conversation with the uncooperative sorceress. — You are the only person I know who knows angels' magic, so who should I ask to but you?
— Very nice to meet you, Mattie, — Dean grinned, looking around the cozy room. — We've just passed the hairdresser shop “Mattie's…
— Not much, — Dean said, disappointed. Okay, let's say. I'm going to take my phone and tap the calendar — whatever date I get to, it's going to be it. Oops, I didn't take my phone upstairs... Okay then, I'll tap later.
Turning sideways to Cas, Dean hunched his shoulders and buried his bare toes in the warm sand. Meeting the dawn on the tiny deserted island in the Pacific where Cas had taken them was not part of his plan, but he had to admit that it was beautiful. The sound of waves splashing against the gently sloping shore just a few meters from where they were, the clean white sand beach, the small palm grove behind them — such wild exotic beauty he had only seen on TV and on a computer monitor in rare moments of rest, only sometimes dreaming of visiting somewhere like this place.
— I don't want to slow down, — he heard Castiel's throaty voice in reply. — It's not what I waited so long. I want you, Dean Winchester, I want you now, — and his fingers gripped the collar of Dean's shirt firmly, pulling him back to himself unhesitatingly. In an instant, his strong hands turned Dean on his back, gently but insistently laid him on the bed, and the angel was suddenly on top of him, straddling the hunter's thighs.
