God bless everything that was John Watson.
you despite all your thorns. So just- Just stop thinking this fucking life is going to scare me away. Stop thinking I won’t take whatever the world throws at us gladly. And for fucks sake, just fucking… let me be part of the conversation next time.”
“Can I come spend the night wiff you?” John looked down at her in shock. Her voice was high pitched and whistly. She looked nervous to have asked and John couldn’t keep the smile off his face.
John followed
“You realize her attackers were probably all men?” Sherlock pointed out in a last-ditch effort. John squared his shoulders.
“It- it’s Sherlock. H-he’s,” Mycroft took an audible inhale, quiet for a moment, composing himself. “he’s hurt, badly. Stabbed, I- I don’t...”
Sherlock smirked smugly, before his brow furrowed, “and what, Detective Sargent, is your point?”
of choices to be made, a million colors to pick, guests to invite, strange wedding traditions he didn’t understand that he was meant to follow. A whole new world of etiquette and expectations. Why, if John had it his way, he and Sherlock would have just put on their best suits and skipped on down to the courthouse, then come straight back to Baker Street for sex so loud it would make Mrs. Turner next door turn scarlet.
. There was nothing left of him but misery and destitution. Whatever fate thought he needed; it could go fuck itself.
“Sherlock,” John groaned, twisting and writhing, trying to get Sherlock's mouth on his fucking prick.
“Yes,” Sherlock said, breathless. John just smiled at him softly before pouring him a cup. As the soldier set the mug at Sherlock’s elbow, he leaned in and kissed Sherlock’s cheek. Sherlock felt a bolt of electricity run through him, from the point of contact to his toes.
meet me?” he asked, delighted. John rolled his eyes, sagging in defeat.
“Yes, Rosie, we are.” Sherlock said, his arm wrapping around John’s shoulder. Rosie grinned.
Strings, John Watson decides on a cool autumn day as he’s limping along the path in Reagents Park, trying to pretend his whole life hasn’t crumbled under his feet, are fickle, vicious things. They’re only purpose is for fate to have one giant, cosmic laugh at the petty humans wandering aimlessly around the earth. John Watson is sure of this, down to his bones. For, his life has been nothing but one giant shite show after another thanks to the damned red string attached to his chest…
“I understand, but I know you. You jump ten steps ahead. This isn’t one of those things you can do that with. This kind of thing takes months or years of preparation and planning, and that’s if it goes through at all. It’s certainly not a decision you can make in a night. Besides, we don’t even know her name, or if she even has one.”
“So good for me, my John. So good.” Sherlock gasped, he sounded breathless. John gripped the sheets where his hands had been placed. A moment later he groaned as Sherlock finally, fucking
A moment later Sherlock fell into bed beside him, pulling him in tight.
“You’d do that?” he asked in a hushed voice as their friends and family drifted around them. John gave a half shrug.
“Are you?” Sherlock breathed in wonder.
Deadly.
“What's it like?” John asked
“It’s your birthday, wherever you’re most comfortable and can see best.” John shrugged. Sherlock cast his eyes about the room, before turning slightly and eyeing the living room.
“I- ah… I haven’t done any drawing since the war. My um… my arm-“ John cut himself off, Sherlock flashed his eyes down, the doctor was shifting in discomfort, “my tremor, made it hard to… I couldn’t hold the pencil right. I… I thought I’d try again, you know,
John looked beautiful as he shuffled into the room, Sherlock froze over his microscope. His mind short circuited as this mussed and sleep ruffled piece of glory greeted him with a rough “
” John, who had been trying to remember how to close his mouth while gaping at his fiancé, let out a surprised bark of laughter.
“Oh! Right!” The detective said, skittering out of the room again. A moment later John heard running water. Sherlock returned with a wet flannel and a cup of water. He set both items on the tea tray, on John’s side, and looked down at the little setting, rather proudly.

Hands just as treasured and sacred.
“We do.” John said, wrapping an arm around his husband’s waist and watching as Rosie opened up the toy chest under the window and removed the set of zoo animals before flying a bird through the air and making a quiet “
Sherlock paced the floor in eagerness as John helped dress the girl and comb out her long hair. She smiled at him sweetly when he finished, dark blue eyes looking into his soul. He thought, again, about parenthood. He hadn’t contemplated it seriously in many years. But he was right, last night when he talked so long his throat went dry, ranting at Sherlock. He could barely care for himself some days, how could he ever care for something as precious and delicate as a child?
“Cars here.” John breathed out against his lovers’ lips. Sherlock just nodded distractedly.
“What’s wrong?” John asked, concerned, as he moved closer, grasping Sherlock’s elbows.
With a swish of his ridiculous coat, Sherlock swirled into the room. The chanting stopped and all eyes went to him. The woman holding the dagger, poised to cut another women’s arm, turned the disease-ridden bit of metal on Sherlock.
“How did you get it back?” John asked in a muted, gentle voice.
“Yes,” Sherlock said, narrowing his eyes.
“Well-“ John cut himself off, his voice a little high pitched from the crying. He cleared his throat and tried again. “Well,
may die if he doesn’t.” Mycroft sighed deeply, rubbing his temples. “Sherlock, listen to me, alright? Put aside everything and anything I have ever taught you in a misguided attempted to protect you and
“What’s your name, kid?” Greg demanded. The boy stopped giggling, then sat heavily on the cot.

And his hands. A soldier’s hands, a healer’s hands, a lover’s hands. How softly they touched Sherlock, even when the detective knew he didn’t deserve it. Stitching Sherlock together with care, carrying out acts of violence in his name.

“It’s alright,” Greg soothed, “you can always call me when he’s being an idiot, you know that.” Greg gave a half smile and Mycroft returned it hesitantly.
“Dear god, you’re telling me. I didn’t know there where so many shades of blue, and good god like I
It took another week of trudging through darkened passages and whispering in the ears of the city’s homeless (
John instantly looked away and shrugged guiltily. Sherlock's mouth turned down in displeasure and he huffed in annoyance. “Fine,” he sighed in a long-suffering voice, “shall I just deduce it?” he lifted an eyebrow, challenging the doctor, and John cringed, god help him,
Mike Stamford led him into the lab at Bart’s. John kept up the brittle, jagged smile as best he could, his nerves already wearing thin. This wouldn’t work, whatever person Mike knew that was looking for a flatmate wouldn’t want someone like John. Someone broken, crippled, scarred from a war he never wanted to join (
“I know what your doing, kid.” Greg said, leaning against the cell casually. Sherlock’s brow pinched in frustration.
“Oh god, fuck, Sherl, Sherl, come on, babe,” John breathlessly tugged the man away by his hair, causing Sherlock to whine. “I just cleaned so we could do this,” John said finally, blinking and breathing hard. They both sat for a moment, getting ahold of themselves.
piece of this man he had put back together.
“Of course it’s a bad idea.” Sherlock snapped, but not at John, at Greg. Greg just shrugged and sighed in exhaustion.
! He had what he needed, he had a new war, he had the excitement, this hadn’t fucking happened since he abandoned that little shite hole flat. So why now?!
John swiftly turned and walked away, no, he wasn’t doing it. He didn’t want that. He didn’t want to see that kind of violence. (
When they got to the restaurant the middle section had been cleared off into a makeshift dancefloor. There were three young men and one young lady tuning their instruments as the small party sat. Each of the tables had a bouquet of flowers, Sherlock murmured the meanings to him as they sat. Symbols of love, devotion, forgiveness, strength, knowledge, and rebirth surrounded them in a rainbow array of colors. John wondered vaguely how Sherlock had managed to get a hold of so many out of season and exotic flowers but decided not to push the issue, it seemed insignificant in the wake of their union.
“Why? Sherlock,
, John realized, looked bewildered in a private, reserved sort of way. With slow, steady hands he typed out a message on John's phone, turned it over once, then stepped closer to John. He was all long limbs and sharp angles, John immediately wanted to wrap him up and feed him way too much food.
Sherlock shrugged, “Related memories, mostly. I would find myself organizing new information or reviewing old information. It’s… set up like rooms and halls in my mind. Occasionally I would be perusing a room and find something of theirs under a metaphorical shelf, hidden behind other memories, combined with information that related to them.”
“What hospital?” Greg asked as he bounded down the steps of his flat, heading outside to grab a cab.
“Oh.” He finally said, one brow lifted in surprise.
or, reversely,
“What’s all this, then?” Sherlock asked with a small smirk, his eyes roving across John. The doctor innocently held the tea saucer up.
bring him back Mycroft, Moriarty used him once. Others will do it again. Besides, I hurt him. He’s been gone three days, he wouldn’t even want-“
“Ah, you found it,” John said cheerfully, plopping himself down in a shocked Sherlock’s lap.
“You go to a rehab center, tonight, and I don’t see you again until you’re clean and sober.” Greg shrugged nonchalantly, as if he hadn’t just asked this lad to tackle a task that most men, far stronger than Greg even, would undeniably fail. The boy froze, almost snarling. Then his face smoothed out, his brown creasing in concentration.
“Trust me.” He murmured lowly. John took a deep breath and nodded sheepishly, following his husband onto the makeshift dancefloor. He laid a hand on Johns' shoulder, tugging John until the doctor was pulling him in close by the waist, effectively giving John the “male” position as the music started.
“So were you.” Sherlock rumbled lowly, as though they were discussing the weather, though John could see the flush on Sherlock’s cheeks.
fool.”
They sat in silence.
John shot up from his bed, gasping in ragged breaths and letting out little sobs. He whimpered as he curled in on himself. The bed felt too soft, the air too cool, the window… well, there
“Why haven’t I seen you doing this before?” Sherlock asked, puzzled. John cleared his throat, uncomfortable.
Strung out,
Sherlock kissed and nipped at his thighs, a random pattern slowly making its way to Johns’ center. With one hand Sherlock finally spread John open. The action made the older man flush in pleasure, he was open, he was wet, he was
The music was something beautiful, something soulful. Halfway through, when the tune began to lift from its somber tune into something brighter but still melancholy, John tilted his head. For, while he had never heard the song, it felt oddly familiar.
When they kissed, it tasted of honey and love.
. Med school, honestly? John was a good student, no doubt, aceing all his classes and exams, but even with that, school was bloody expensive. He couldn’t even bloody well afford to eat, they barely managed to keep the damned water running as it was!
“John,” Sherlock gasped, turning. His eyes were red, he had a tissue crumpled in one hand. He stood suddenly, the coat dropping to the ground.
him. You want to be around him; you want domesticity and a life with that man.” Mycroft paused; one hand outreached slightly.
“You’ve got to have some story or another stored in that big brain, and there’s a million books in this flat. Just pick one.” John nearly pleaded. He was exhausted, barely able to move let alone keep his eyes open. Sherlock scowled at him for a moment before sighing.
safety. It had already happened. Moriarty had seen his love for John before even Sherlock had, he’d hurt the soldier, beat him, threatened him,
John felt a pleasant shiver run down his spine as Sherlock began to sip his tea with one hand, and gently tug at Johns' hair with the other. It wasn’t but another few minutes before John had drifted once more, this time his mouth opened, breathing softly. A look of utter bliss upon his face.

Sherlock, who was at the desk typing on his laptop, felt his breathing pick up before he forced his body back in line. Heart rate dropped, breathing pattern even, no outward indication he was bothered.
Sherlock kept his arm around John’s shoulder, kissing his temple.
“It’s nothing,” John started. Sherlock raised one eyebrow again, highly unimpressed, “look I just… Don’t take this the wrong way but… I don’t care.” John finally huffed out.
brother
“What will drive you away? What will I say or do that will finally snap what we have between us? What will make you leave me?” Sherlock's voice had gone far off and melancholy, his hands no longer gripping John, just running along his skin, as if he feared the soldier would stand and leave right this moment.
“Open your eyes.” Sherlock ground out, he sounded wrecked. John blinked quickly, gasping and arching into his husband.
“Well, seeing as you seem to know my whole life’s story-“ Greg snarked. The boy groaned and rolled his eyes.
. Past. Present.
John gasped, he felt his whole body relaxing, so unlike that night. It burned a little, the stretch a delight instead of a torment, the friction heavenly instead of cruel. His wrist dripped warm blood down his forearm as Sherlock bottomed out. The blood smeared across Sherlock's pale back, catching in the man’s own scars as it smeared across his skin. John wrapped his legs around Sherlock, arching into the man.
“Well, who said anything about flatemates?” John asked, looking at the strange man, bewildered. The man just grinned a little, pleased.
“Bell tower, he was, rather stupidly, trying to cause the bell to collapse. Utter imbecile.” Sherlock scoffed. John shook his head at his husband.

Memories were brought up for John after they broke the news to the girl. She found herself powerless to do anything in the wake of this information. The abuse had happened decades prior, and the man had far more money and connections than the simple schoolteacher could even dream of. The man would walk away unscathed, his reputation intact, the girl would have to live the rest of her life knowing the man she had remembered fondly as a brother figure had indeed been her abuser.
The pub wasn’t too crowded, what with it being the middle of a weekday. Still, John had to look around for a moment before he saw Lestrade. He was sitting at a two top, absently watching the footie replay on the telly as he sipped at his pint and picked at his fish and chips. John smiled as he approached the table and Lestrade turned his gaze to him. The elder man’s face lit up as he smiled. It was easy to see what drew Mycroft in during these softer moments, John thought as he approached his friend.
“They’re not gonna find her parents are they.” John said, feeling utterly defeated.
“Yea,” he whispered gruffly, stepping into Sherlock’s space, with every breath his chest brushing Sherlock’s coat “Yea, at home.”
“Let me take care of you,” Sherlock said quietly, thumb stroking over John’s inner wrists. John fought himself for another moment, half of his brain twisting and writhing in an animal fear, part of his brain serenely quiet for the first time since he awoke in that dilapidated warehouse, since he was shot in the desert, since he signed the dotted line and got himself shipped off to war, since he left home at 18, since his father straddled his chest at 16 and forced a bottle of liquor down his throat, hell, perhaps for the first time since the day he was born.
“And my wife’s affair,”
“Cool.” She said, almost in awe, allowing John and Sherlock to hug her for a moment longer before squirming out of their hold and excitedly running about her new room.
“They’re gonna put you in bloody solitary if you keep that up, you know.” He said to the young man. The boy snorted.
John and Sherlock locked eyes, their silent communication (“
, you bloody moron, I
John left his fiancé to it as he puttered about the kitchen making a pot of tea. It was so bizarre to no longer have to dance around Sherlock's chemistry sets. No strange body parts in the fridge, no dangerous chemicals left to be mixed into edible foods, no eyeballs in the mugs, just a neat, tidy kitchen. Sherlock had taken a shine to the idea of having a privet room for all his experiments, though there was a small armchair in the corner reserved for John. Sometimes the soldier would drift up with him and they would chat comfortably while Sherlock worked on some mindless experiment which only required half his attention and John edited their blog, reading out cases for his fiancé to choose from.
“I love you, John,” Sherlock said seriously as he picked up the scalpel.
As he shakily made his way downstairs, he was surprised by the sound of clicking china and boiling water. He furrowed his brow as he rounded into their living room. Sherlock cast an assessing look in his direction before swirling about the kitchen, flaring dressing gown in his wake. A moment later Sherlock whirled back into the living room, setting the tea tray on a table between his chair and John’s. Sherlock eyed him silently, then set about making a cuppa.
, slid home. Always so slick and warm and tight inside him. Always, because that never changed, no matter how many times they did this, Sherlock still filled John just right. As he slid in, Sherlock leaned over John, grasping his wrists once more, holding John down.
John sobbed then, truly sobbed, nodding furiously, telling himself Sherlock was right. He felt… a release of tension. No matter how many years went by, no matter how rotted Moriarity's corpse became from its place in the earth, no matter he had been witness to Sebastian Moran’s death, John could still
The people were being stored in an abandoned warehouse near the docks. The team stormed in, Sherlock and John allowed to enter after the building had been cleared.
“Get up, Watson.” He hissed to himself, overcome with utter rage and frustration. He’d been living with Sherlock for almost three bloody months now, this wasn’t
“In front of the fire.”
“And yours?” John asked, nodding to the flowers pinned into Sherlock's lapel. Sherlock took John’s own far rougher hand in his own, bringing it up until John gently began to trace his fingers over the flowers. So light, so soft, like whispering his hands over a baby’s eyelids, precious and fragile.
They found 26 other women and children living in repurposed crates and makeshift cages. A wooden box had been turned into a play pen for an infant, a chubby little thing with a tuft of black hair and deep almond eyes. John felt sick.
“Your

”, John tuned out her fake smile, staring at the brochure the string was tugging him towards. With barely concealed annoyance, John snatched the pamphlet up.
“Oh,” the doctor said, a bit sheepishly, “I was just… sketching. I’m sorry if it bothers you, I can throw them out-“ John was blushing, embarrassed at being caught. Sherlock had tuned the man out, plucking the simple lined notebook from John’s hand with no preamble.
Greg complied anyway. He stayed close by as the lad punched in a number and waited for the ringing to stop. There was silence on both ends, nothing was said. Finally, the boy sighed in frustrated defeat.
“We don’t know a thing about each other, I don’t know your name, I don’t even know where we’re meeting.” John huffed. The mans face lit up with joy.
He sat and took up the cup of water, going through a few sips before noticing the two white pills, pain killers, for his headache, shoulder, or leg, John couldn’t tell. He obediently took the medicine and drained the rest of the cup. He simply stared at the flannel for a moment.
“Don’t be stupid, Sherl. I don’t know the first thing about kids, or parenting. Why would I ever want-?”
“You do,” Sherlock answered confidently. He was right, of course, but it only made John flush in discomfort.
Then nothing. A few blank pages, then one aborted sketch. The lines wobbled, weak and light, barely marks upon the page. There was a mark where John had snapped a pencil against the page in frustration.
Sherlock froze from where he was hushing John and stroking the man's hair gently. “What about them?” he murmured, pulling John closer.
“Not a word.” He shook his head.
“Because this isn’t… children are loud and messy and take over your lives. There’s schooling and childcare, and sick days and nightmares and gum in their hair and football games and ballet classes and college and break ups and huge screaming rows and-… and a million other things. It’s not always letting a child pass out on the couch after a cup of tea and a short bedtime story. There’s… things to think about.”
“I’ve gone over every scar I could find, I’m sure you’ll manage to find one or two more. I counted, I think, 23? I can account for 20 of those. So, here’s the deal, if I can remember the story behind it, or where I got it, I’ll tell you. That way you’ll have that part of me. But if I can’t remember, or if we both decide it’s from a bad enough memory, then you can have the scar itself.”
, just a bit faster, yes, yes. Sherlock sped up, answering his bodies animal call.
wedding, just… the- I dunno, everything else.”
.” Sherlock said, suddenly fierce in his protective fear.
“What you taught me to.” Sherlock snapped back. Mycroft sat frozen, a hard look on his face, before it melted into exhaustion.
Sherlock couldn’t sleep, and as such, John couldn’t sleep. Sherlock had wrapped himself around John and in the dim moonlight of their bedroom, he was feather-whispering his fingers along each of John's many,
“Look mate, I can’t take her home with me, she can’t go into the system with her kidnapper still looking for her. What do you suggest I do?” Greg asked, he sounded defeated and annoyed. Sherlock snarled and began to pace the small office, John, who’d been awake for almost two days (
. The little girl seemed entranced, though it was hard to tell from her excellent poker face. She sat still and silent, sipping her tea at random intervals. Finally, her drink was finished, and she set it on the coffee table. John found himself rising and helping to get the girl tucked into the couch as Sherlock continued the story.
? At his little shite of a brother’s hospital bed side?!
“Of what?!” John finally snapped in anger and pain. Sherlock flinched.
John nodded and took the girl by her upper arm, gently but firmly speed walking her out. When they finally found the secret exit out into a dingy alleyway, littered with needles and glass, John swept the barefooted girl up. She squeaked as the trio ran to the opening of the alleyway. John set the girl down on a low wall and set about untying her. The gag came out first and she broke into loud sobs.
How much grief was hidden behind those eyes?
“Just try it,” John whispered, pressing the candy against Sherlock’s perfect cupid bow lips. Sherlock met his eyes, his gaze intense, overwhelming as always, before he opened his mouth, taking a bite of the large sweet. His eyes closed for a moment as he tried to make a show of enjoying the candy for John (
, you mad man, let’s go. I’ll cover you.” Sherlock looked to him with a fondness and warmth that was so out of place John couldn’t help but replicate it.
And of course, this meant John Watson spent the next two years working his fucking arse off, applying for scholarship after scholarship, aceing test after test, working two jobs, barely sleeping. Exhausted, hungry, lonely (
” Sherlock sat up and leaned back over his husband. Sherlock prick slipped against John, causing the older man to groan low in his throat.
“Y-you remember all of it, don’t you? Siberia, I mean.” John whispered back, protected by the darkness of the night and cocooned from dead men's hands by his lover and the comfort of their bed.
“Sherlock… I don’t want to be-“
“Walk out backward, slowly, don’t turn your back,” Sherlock said without taking his eyes off the cult members, kicking the dagger behind them and into the corridor where it skidded to a halt against a wall made of skulls. John grunted in acknowledgment. There was another tense moment before the trio began to walk backward. The girl sniffled from behind John. He murmured to her in English, not knowing if she could understand the words of gentleness but hoping she could at least interpret the tone of voice.
In the end he got a full ride, how the fuck he managed it, he’d never know.
? Sherlock didn’t even have to bloody speak to the man, just looked at him through the two-way glass for a few moments.
understood.
“Oh, you’re Mycroft I take it. Brother, I imagine?” Mycroft looked at him with a sad half smile.
“Yes. You seem to have had quiet the influence on my little brother. So, I’ve come to thank you, and ask… ask simply that you keep your promise, once he gets out.” The man shrugged, though there was something vulnerable in his posture. It all clicked for Greg suddenly.
“It- it doesn’t hurt.” He hiccupped a little, both hands grasping Sherlock's hair, pulling the man in for a gentle kiss.
“Perhaps, but the fault lies solely with you.” Before John could lean in and steal a kiss, Mrs. Hudson knocked on their open front door with her customary
) and a further two scars that, after a quiet discussion, John agreed to give to Sherlock.
“Well considering we’re married, very little save harming innocents and infidelity, I’d imagine.” John tried to joke. Sherlock was silent for a long moment before he began to pull away. John immediately grabbed him and pulled him closer. “Hey! Hey, where are you going?” John felt his heart beat faster.
“You just sent that boy to get engaged, didn’t you?”
you. Do you understand? You could
“I know.” Sherlock said, looking back up, “I know. I just. I don’t know, I got scared. I said all those things to… I’m sorry.” Sherlock finished lamely, looking away.
“I’m not… particularly attached to the Watson name. Watson's tend to die drunk, and young, and alone. I don’t plan on doing that.” John confessed, leaning into Sherlock. Sherlock searched his face for a moment before breaking into a wide grin.
) for John and Sherlock to finally stumble across the right stretch of endless corridors. Another two days of stalking said corridors before they finally caught the cult in the act.
John supposed, in the end, it was good that Sherlock enjoyed this so much, because
John sat for a moment, processing. Sherlock, by nature, was not a very violent person, he took no special pleasure in the pain of others. Save a few people (
“Oh!” the girl said, false cheerfulness coloring her voice, “yes, I almost forgot! We’ve got a fantastic pre-med program! We work with some of the top hospitals in London to-“ John tuned out.
The next morning John awoke wrapped in warmth with a set of deep blue eyes staring at him curiously just over the beds edge. He yelped and flinched back on instinct. Sherlock, the complete wanker that he was, just grunted and weakly smacked John before rolling over, stealing all the covers, and burying himself in stolen warmth. John felt a minor irritation along with the morning chill that was subdued when the little girl curiously begins to poke at a wound on his bared ankle.
“Violin?” John asked weakly, lost, terribly aroused, because holy fuck how did he get this lucky? Please god, don’t let this be a platonic bond!
“What does it fucking
“No, you fool!” Mycroft snapped, “they where in
. I’m yours through and through. From the top of my head to the soles of my feet, it’s all yours.”
Sherlock flipped another page and stopped, tilting his head in confusion. He looked into his own face, he had his hands steepled in front of his face, his eyes closed. The shadows danced across his jaw and cheekbones, giving him a sharper appearance. He found it hard to tell where the shadows stopped, and he began. It was fitting, he supposed, Sherlock lived a life half in the shadows, drifting through life pretending he belonged in a world of light.
As Sherlock slept, John thought.
“You can’t seem to keep from getting kidnapped and I’d rather not have to come save you again.” Sherlock said, aiming for bored. He realized that he’d hit home when John physically recoiled.
Dear god, Sherlock felt his heart stutter.
Sherlock gave a half shrug, biting his lip and fiddling with his mug, “you’re better at it than I am.” He said shyly. Johns' face softened at the vulnerable admission.
“And this one,” Sherlock whispered in awe, drawing John back to him. The detective pressed on Johns gunshot wound, his voice breathy when he spoke. “This scar I
”. Did he not see what he did to Sherlock? He must not have, because he blearily made his way to the coffee pot on the counter, checking the water back and the coffee grinds before starting a morning brew. John rubbed his eyes with a yawn.
The head of the cult escaped, but Sherlock merely scoffed as he berated the head detective, the friend of Lestrade’s who had initially gotten Sherlock set up on the case, this time in English. He told the man to check an ancient church which the professor had developed an obsession for. Sure enough, as they sat in the back of a cab on the way back to their hotel room for a long, much deserved rest, Sherlock received a call. He simply hummed and gave a curt “
They found receipts from bought children, and bills of sale from sold ones, hopefully the police would be able to track down the poor souls that had already been sold off and save them. Rose was among the receipts, it appeared she was, in fact four years old. There was no birth date, but there was the country and city of sale, a smaller city in Romania, Sherlock told him, and it mentioned that she was sold by a woman. Most likely Rose’s mother had gotten in over her head and sold her daughter either for drugs or to pay off debts. She wasn’t a new purchase though, she’d been with this man for three of her measly four years.
Three days later the detective broke down and donned his coat. Mike Stamford had come by the day before, giving Sherlock a wide berth as he packed a bag of John’s things. When Sherlock asked where John was, Mike had just given him a disappointed look and shook his head.
Perhaps if I had… If I had held you like the day that grandfather died, perhaps if I had loved you more you wouldn’t have torn yourself apart. I’m sorry for that, brother,
The next day found them peacefully wondering a small marketplace. John had never smelt so many foods, nor seen so many different people all in one place. The air tingled with joy, the sound of a thousand languages rolling over John in waves.
It was freeing.
“You.” The detective breathed out. It was lower than a mumble, a sound so low it was felt and not heard. Shy, uncertain, laced with shame.
“My eyes?” John asked, feeling unbearably slow, though Sherlock didn’t seem to notice, just bit his lip and nodded. With a doubtful frown John took up the rag and covered his eyes. He couldn’t help the sigh of relief as the cool cloth met his face. His whole body relaxed back into the chair, legs going lax and spread. He wasn’t even feeling self-conscious about his lack of a packer at the moment.
“I haven’t heard about her talking at all,” the woman said, “this is a great sign, she must really trust you.”
know what they were talking about, seeing as this Sherlock was born in his mind.
“No, John, what if I want… to hurt someone innocent?”
“Sherlock?” John asked, confused, the girl tilted her head, eyeing the taller man, before nodding. “oh… kay?” John breathed out. After making up the girls’ bed on the couch, he made his way into the kitchen, laying a gentle hand on Sherlock’s back.
The girl hesitantly launched into a spiel about how fantastic this particular university was. The great housing and financial aid and “
Why him?
Two fingers traced over the top of John’s right foot. “Basic training, dropped my damn pack on my foot. Hurt like a bitch, Bill Murray ‘bout pissed himself laughing at my dumb arse.” Sherlock breathed out a laugh.
“No!” he cried in desperation, tugging Sherlock down insistently. Sherlock hesitated for a moment. They had never done this, Sherlock always took the time to stretch John, to ensure he was wet enough, to make sure that John never felt a moment of discomfort. But John didn’t want that today. He wanted Sherlock in him, nothing, not even artificial lubrication between them. Sherlock hesitated but whispered a quiet “
for Sherlock. Only Sherlock. After an eternity Sherlock finally licked John from his opening to the tip of his prick. The action made John gasp, his eyes flying open and hips shifting. The direct contact felt like almost too much after so many long moments of teasing brushes.
“I don’t think anyone wants that to happen.” Sherlock confirmed. He was frowning, his face pinched in frustration. He hated loose ends, but this was more than that, he was nearly fuming with an impotent rage as he watched a paramedic wrapping the baby from the wooden playpen in a blanket.
Three hours later, after the boy had been bailed out over the phone and seen off in a dark nondescript car by Greg himself, a man in a three piece with a sharp nose and an umbrella appeared at the corner of Greg’s new desk.
“Ah, but then we’d be on the phone all day, every day, yes?” Mycroft joked. Greg grinned at him.
night. Another drunk driver eager to go around them, but John was in the driver’s seat instead of Victor this time around. And as the car crashed, he saw Moriarty hanging out of the drunk driver’s car window, laughing and pulling taunting faces at Sherlock. The car rolled into the ditch.
“Yea well, they’re vain gits, aren’t they? All that time spent on their clothes and hair, it’s no wonder they spend so much time on the big day.” Greg shrugged.
“Sherl-“ he said, hesitant.
“And I'd take yours, gladly,” Sherlock replied in kind.
, he really wanted to go there. But fate, it would seem, had other plans. What a fucking bitch.
“How the hell did manage to get a grenade past airport security, anyway?” Sherlock smirked at him and removed said grenade, pulling out the pin and releasing the lever. John’s breath caught…. And nothing happened. After a moment John choked on a laugh.
are you doing?” he’d snarled gruffly.
“Er, sorry. Anyway, Sally will take the lass back to the station, us three are going to a warehouse on the docks. We’ve gotten a tip that our men were seen there last night.” Sherlock froze, then groaned.
When it came time to chose where he would train, the string made its presence known once more. It tugged him insistently, pointing straight to the words “
He liked Sherlock like this. So rarely did the cases take a back seat, so rarely did Sherlock allow himself to experience and feel freely. John thought, perhaps, it was something to do with the anonymity? It had been many, many years since Sherlock was afforded the luxury of simply being a man in love. Probably not since Victor all those decades ago. The detective seemed content to revel in his newfound freedom. No one around them saw the superhuman detective and his trusty sidekick, instead, they were simply two newlyweds, madly in love as they wondered Parisian streets.
“Us?” Sherlock’s voice sounded small, his brow was furrowed, concentrating on everything John said with an intensity that meant he was cataloguing something new.
The red string tugged him, almost making him stumble, and he had looked up in annoyance and hope. Perhaps this would be the moment… but no. The string was pointed at, but not connected to, a husky boy with round glasses and a kind face. The lad introduced himself as Mike Stamford. Though he wasn’t John's usual crowd, he found the young man’s kindly manner a reprieve from the intensity of their training.
Greg and Donovan arrived a few minutes later to John and the little girl playing a game of Operation on the living room floor (Rose was surprisingly good), and Sherlock pacing with his long legs, stopping occasionally to eye the map of London tapped up on the wall over the couch.
“Very well,” he said, standing. “Let me make a call.” It wasn’t a question.
“He’s been waiting too long, idiot.” Sherlock sneered.
to me, listen to what I’m about to say and commit it to memory, do you understand?” Mycroft asked seriously. Sherlock analyzed his brother before nodding hesitantly.
who thinks a fucking ex-junkie is worth
“How do you feel about the violin?” the man asked, straightening, his hands clasped behind his back.
“Is it… are they here?” the boy asked breathlessly, flashing his eyes around for a new person. Perhaps a new classmate or teacher, or even the two girls at the booths. After a moment, fighting for air, John shook his head, motioning for the boys to go on without him. Riley, the one who had recognized the signs of a string pull in John, began tugging the others along, nodding to John in solidarity and understanding. John didn’t nod back.
“Only for you, my love,” Sherlock replied with a blissful smile.
“-now if you were a sentimental sap of minimal intelligence, you would go back to her right this moment. With or without a damned ring.” The junkie kid sneered. His voice was bored, but full of malice and arrogance. Greg gaped in shock as the lad nodded to the kid in the cell and turned, fleeing out the door. The other two PC’s just stared after their comrade.
John gasped as Sherlock slid over him after setting the plate aside, straddling, holding the doctor’s arms over his head gently, kindly. They hadn’t yet done this, John didn’t like the idea of being a passive partner, hated the idea of being submissive in any way. He suddenly shifted; a bit uncomfortable at how deliciously his body was responding to this.
And that, Mycroft would say years later, was the exact moment he knew he could possibly, one day, maybe, love Greg Lestrade.
And the
“Thank you,” Sherlock sighed after a while, laying a kiss on the crown of Johns' head.
Sleep deprived,
He’d never seen such a tidy child. Even as a little one, even in his tumultuous home, John still left dolls and toy cars laying about, coloring books and crayons on the coffee table and half-filled milk glasses on the counter. Her almost robotic movements, silence, and nearly neurotic tidiness was unsettling and heart breaking at once. She should have been asking a thousand questions, gaping at the books and beakers, trying to grab the skull on the mantel and touching Sherlock’s violin. Not staring at him with the most somber face he’d ever seen on a child outside the battlefield.
“You- You utter and complete… fuck you Sherlock Holmes. Fuck you, fuck everything you do, fuck every breath you take, you utter fucking
Then John entered the lab and his world turned on its head. John was gaping in shock, even as he offered the man his cell phone when Mike said he’d left his. The man looked up, down, then up again quickly.
He sat.
” floating around their heads.
“Sherlock?” he asked, looking around his chair on the ground, as though assuming he’d left the shoes there, “D’ya know where my slippers are?”
“I didn’t
” Imaginary Sherlock looked up and gave him the look, but this time John didn’t snap about it, because technically speaking, John
The tale continued on until the little girl, who had been staring intently into the slowly dying fire, began to drift. Her eyes going hazy and soft, her grip on the blanket that was swallowing her whole loosening. Another moment later and she was breathing deeply, her face lax, her body at ease. Sherlock paused, considered the girl, then continued the story a moment longer while John quietly took their cups into the kitchen and locked up for the night.
“The girl.” Sherlock nodded in her direction. Sally scoffed.
?” he asked, shocked. John let out a nervously giddy laugh and nodded.
“Problem?”
Now truthfully, that’s not the reason I insisted on Reagents park for our union. I’m not sure if he remembers or realized, and to be fair, it was rather dark at the time, but the first time he surprised me was in a cab, passing by that very park. On the way to our first crime scene.”
“A- Afghanistan, how-?” John stuttered, entranced by where his own red string wormed its way into this strange man’s chest, burrowing past his deliciously tailored shirt and into flesh that was probably pale as porcelain. The man smirked playfully, then pulled back, suddenly self-confident to the point of arrogance.
“Maybe.” He finally said, “maybe. But… Slowly. This was… perfect. I don’t know how much more-“
“That’s enough to be getting on with, don’t you think?” he asked with a secret smile that John already seemed to understand, “the address is 221B Baker Street, tomorrow, 7 o’clock, and the name is Sherlock Holmes.” He paused as he passed John on the way to the door, looking at John expectantly. John, entranced by the man’s beauty, jumped and flushed when he realized what he wanted.
“He’s your son.” The man, no,
They deserved this. They all deserved to be happy and have a family, they deserved it more than most, if John was honest. He looked at Rosie and couldn’t imagine ever being like his father, couldn’t imagine ever looking at her with anything but an overwhelming and awesome love. He’d do anything to protect this home he’d made, to protect these people who deserved his devotion. He made this for himself, he pulled himself out of blood and bone, he learned to be love and loved, he deserved this, and he would continue to put in the work every day to deserve Rosie and Sherlock’s love. To be the man they needed. Protector, provider, supporter, father, and husband.
, I would lay myself at an alter to this scar and everything it signifies. Without this, we’d have never met, you’d have never been put in my path. Where would we have been, had you been left to your own accords? You’d have stayed in the army until you found yourself unable to hold a gun, and probably past that. You’d have never come home at all, would you? And we’d have never met, you’d have never put me back together. You know that, right John? You know you took all my broken pieces and made something of the nothing I was before you, you know that, don’t you, my love?” Sherlock was crying now; John could feel the tears hitting his skin where Sherlock was half laying over him.
. With a ridiculous flick of his wrist, Sherlock showed off the grenade in one hand and twirled the now removed pin in the other.
“You’re an idiot.” John finally decided, tugging Sherlock in by the collar. He felt Sherlock smile against his lips and could picture the blush the detective surely wore.
“You take care of Harvey all the time!” Greg argued with a furrowed brow.
His shoulder screamed in agony; his wrist twinged in pain. Oh fuck, Christ, he needed to come. Sherlock hummed in acknowledgment, lifting his head to eye John. John moaned at the sight, Sherlock’s own spend on his lips and chin, Johns’ slick wetting his lips, and fuck, Johns’ blood stained his mouth. Sherlock analyzed him for a moment before slowly lowering his mouth, finally, fucking
John drifted in and out of sleep for a few moments before he felt Sherlock prodding at him. Shoes and trousers were removed, his tie and suit jacket folded over John’s armchair, and his grandfathers’ cufflinks removed with reverence. Finally, John was left in his pants, unbuttoned white dress shirt, and vest. After a moment Sherlock carefully lifted John’s upper body and sat, lowering John’s head and torso back into his lap.
“Greg,” Mycroft said, curt and strained. Greg was at full attention.
“Marry me?” Sherlock asked so quietly that John felt the rumble of his deep voice more than heard the words.
The girl, now carefully clutching her cooled half-filled mug of tea, squirmed back into the couch for a moment before going still. She delicately began to sip and John had the thought that, tomorrow, after he had slept at least eight hours, they would need to get a name out of the girl, or else pick one for her. After a long moment of Sherlock seeming to wrack his brain, his deep voice began to tale of
The taller man had combed back his hair, taming the mess of curls and was wearing a suit of dark purple, with black lapels, (
“And you damn near gave Phillips a heart attack when you told everyone his Da’ was a drunk son of a bitch. Not that he didn’t deserve it, mind. He’s a right cock, nice to know who made him that way.”
be?” John asked, a bit concerned now.
It would be many, many years before his string tugged again. Not until he was a pathetic, broken, crippled mockery of a man angrily and determinedly limping along Reagents Park as he tried to do every day. When he felt the string stir for the first time in a better part of a decade, he grit his teeth in anger and determination and kept walking.
“At… at home?” Sherlock asked hesitantly, hopefully. John seemed at war within himself for a moment. He was clearly still hurt and angry. “Please?” Sherlock pleaded quietly, holding John’s hand a little tighter. Something in the soldier softened for a moment, he seemed to deflate a little.
“Greg, we don’t know the first thing about taking care of a kid.” John argued weakly.
“Sherlock?” John asked breathlessly.
“Yea, but I’m
. He’s fine, they say he’ll be fine, back to normal in a few months, as long as he doesn’t pull the stitches. I don’t know why I called, I just…” Mycroft drifted off, he looked lost, confused at his own actions.
“This is a bad idea.” John sighed under his breath, exhausted, anxious. He rubbed the back of his neck tiredly.
” “you know we can’t” “
“I was a bloody captain,” John growled, relaxing further into the bed, his feathers still ruffled, but intrigued by Sherlock’s unraveling of his past.
When he returned home, feeling much more relaxed and at ease, Mycroft was gone. Sherlock had cleared away all the swatches and everything else, he was now on Johns’ laptop (
. Every breath John took was filled with the aroma of Baker Street, tea and gunpowder, gun oil, violin rosin, lingering cigarette smoke. And Sherlock, god, fuck, the smell of
) John couldn’t possibly picture Sherlock feeling any kind of joy at any person’s pain, especially someone innocent. Crimes with violence towards innocent people, namely children, could easily send Sherlock into a rage. The idea of this stoically calm man, who had a stranglehold on his emotions, finding pleasure in the pain of an innocent person was outlandish.
“Greg Lestrade?” the man asked, Greg looked to him, fumbling a little as he stood.
. Or at least he decided he did in that moment.
,” the shade hissed
and most importantly he knew how to care for Sherlock on the bad ones. This, John supposed as he slipped into his coat, is just how two people perfectly suited for each other worked. They knew each other inside and out; they knew what the other person was thinking or wanting or needing before the other person even had to voice such desires.
“Ah yes, right well. I know you didn’t, ah, really want to do any of the traditional wedding things, but would you perhaps, rather…” Sherlock motioned helplessly to one of the young men, a thin brown-skinned boy with a violin in hand. He nodded meaningfully to Sherlock and lifted the violin.
, but…”
After a tense few moments the Professor spat something in French at one of the women, she was one of the ones who had her palm slit open in the blood rite, the crimson liquid now staining her white linen robe and fair skin. With a glare that could only be described as murderous, she moved towards the captive and none too gently ripped the bag off the girl’s head. The girl cried out in pain, her head jerking in a way that told John a chunk of her hair had probably been removed along with the bag. She was young, perhaps of legal age, perhaps not, with fair skin and wide brown eyes which watered with tears. She looked around herself in fear, before casting her eyes on John and Sherlock with something like hope. John gave her what he hoped was a reassuring smile.

“I’m not going anywhere. I’m not leaving. Not over this.” John soothed and Sherlock’s tears picked up.
“Thank you.” John finally choked out, blowing gently on the tea before taking another sip. Sherlock blushed again and ducked his head, pleased.

“We’ll take her home.” John suddenly said, surprising himself and everyone else. Sherlock looked at him wide eyed and panicked.

“Yea,” John whispered roughly, “I’m yours. Only yours, a separation from you wouldn’t just break me, love. It’d destroy me. There’d be
“Ok,” he finally said, “what’s going on?”
Eighteen minutes later found Greg Lestrade running up to the third floor where Mycroft had directed him via text. The first thing he saw was Sherlock laying on the bed. He was paler than usual. He looked small and young, none of the venom and vitriol Greg had come to associate with the man. Mycroft looked a mess, or what passed as a mess for him. Which of course meant he still looked like he’d walked off a magazine set. He had shed his jacket and rolled up his shirt sleeves. He was standing at Sherlock’s bedside, looking down at his brother, hands in his pockets. His face was drawn. He looked to Greg with something like relief.
“Nothing,” Sherlock whispered back. John rolled his eyes in the dark.
,” the junkie said in a bored tone, though his eyes roved over Greg from head to toe in an intense manner, “he’s yours. Not the other mans, you’ve been worried about it. Now, if your smart, you’ll divorce the mother, quickly and as civilly as possible. She’ll rip away your custody rights first chance she gets, don’t let her fuck you over, Detective Sargent…” the boy lurched forward, squinting at his badge, “
“Are you hungry?” John asked the small girl, trying to fight his own exhaustion. The girl silently shook her head from her place perched on the far side of the couch, her little bottom nearly off the edge and toes still not touching the ground, hands primly folded in her lap. Trying to make herself as small and unobtrusive as possible. “ah… right. Do you… want a bedtime story?” John asked, racking his brain for his own bedtime routines as a little one. He recalled Harry whispering stories into his ear as a small boy when she’d sneak into his bed after an argument with their father that went too far. He was always unsure if she was trying to make him feel better or herself. The girl stared at him hard for a minute before turning to look at Sherlock who was preparing three mugs of bedtime tea. She pointed at the gangly man.
), and, to Johns surprise, Mr. and Mrs. Trevor. In the end, they chose to marry under a tree in the park John had met Mike on that day so many years ago.
“Well, hell mate,” Greg shrugged, “just ask him? It’s not like any of us will ever know what in the seven hells goes on in a Holmes' brain,” Greg scoffed.
It was… fitting, in a way. They each had a role, a give and take, neither had power over the other, where one found himself lacking, the other found himself in abundance. It was just a dance, it was just dancing positions, it didn’t really mean anything, not to anyone else. But to John it did. To John it felt meaningful, the way they swayed together, the way they danced in close comfort.
“Yes…”
“What
“Oh, um, John Watson.” He nodded lamely at the man, Sherlock. Sherlock smiled at him; his face giddy.
“Hydrangea, meaning
That was the first time John Watson took me by surprise. The second was later that day, I led him on a wild chase through London, departing from this restaurant. It was, admittedly, just for fun. Partially to see if I was right about the cause of his leg pain, partially to see how he would react to the Work. To my surprise, John took to my lifestyle like a fish in water. We worked perfectly as a team, keeping up with the other with ease. There was no awkwardness, no question, then, that John Watson would be moving into 221B, for I decided he would be a wonderful asset to my work and my life.”
When Sherlock was allowed to leave, seemingly always without ever being charged formally or even given a court date, Greg nodded to him in respect.
It was with a heavy heart John watched the little girl and Sally Donovan descend the stairs of 221B Baker Street. The little girl looked back for just a moment and gave him a sad smile, raising a free hand in farewell. John had a feeling she understood exactly what was happening. He tried to smile at her as she vanished but found it impossible, the twist of his lips felt all wrong.
good, actually. His eyes seemed a little brighter, his skin a little tanner, he stood a touch taller as he tugged on his matching tie. He liked himself like this, if he was honest. He smiled at himself a little in the mirror, running a hand through his carefully combed hair one more time. Sherlock liked it longer like this, John knew. Some days he couldn’t get Sherlock's hands out his hair for anything less than threatening to botch an experiment. And Sherlock had taken to holding John in place by the greying strands in their bedroom. Something John was in no way inclined to argue.
“She’s at least three, Sherl, she probably doesn’t wear diapers.”
A week later he returned, the lad had showered this time, the hair Greg originally thought to be black was actually a dark, dark auburn with a touch of red. Sherlock helped Greg catch a man who had murdered his brother-in-law because he was in love with his own sister. Greg never would have caught that. But
“No, not yet, anyway… I’ve actually come to thank you.”
not know about the earth going ‘round the sun? Or is it like the lost memories, where it’s eclipsed by something more important?”
“Sherlock,” he breathed.
John hummed happily as he stripped and situated himself on their large bed, the small tea saucer balanced on his thigh. Sherlock came out of the shower some long moments later, a white towel slung low across his waist, and another rubbing vigorously at his hair. He slowed his movements as he took in John on their bed. John stretched teasingly, allowing Sherlock to see every bit of him without hesitation or self-consciousness.
“Tea, it makes everything better.” The genius said to John’s unspoken question, a crooked, shy smile on his face. He stood suddenly, staring at John intensely, as John stared back in embarrassed bewilderment.
“You ok?” the genius said once he’d gotten his breath back. John could only grunt and wriggle himself in closer. Sherlock huffed out a laugh. “That good?”

“What will

“She’s insistent.” John shrugged helplessly. After a moment Sherlock rolled his eyes and grumbled.
. With you, I am heard. I am a man who is loved and much more than tolerated. Without you, I am cold, cut off from the world.” John swallowed thickly, blinking quickly. Sherlock smiled at him with unyielding affection and dragged John's fingers over the sprig of bluebells. “Bluebells,

ought not kid yourself. You are useful to me. An asset to the Work. Nothing more.” John was gasping as though he’d run a marathon.
“Ah, thanks?” John said, bewildered as his strange flatmate drifted into the kitchen, making them a pot of tea.
Sherlock carried her back to the couch and allowed her a few moments of rest as he and John cleaned the kitchen before both men dressed for the day. After all was said and done, Sherlock plopped the little girl in the client chair as he and John took up their places across from her. She kicked her feet and stared back at them quietly, brushing wayward curls out of her eyes every few seconds, the poor lamb was in desperate need of a haircut. After a moment Sherlock spoke.
“Greg,” Sherlock conceded begrudgingly, “is on his lunch break. He’ll be at the pub on Shefford, Shefford?” he looked back to his brother for confirmation. Mycroft hummed in agreement. “Go eat with him. I’ll find a case when you get back.”
“Dunno, you and Mycroft just seemed so excited I thought… I dunno.” John ran his hand through his hair. “Look, I’m not saying I don’t want to show you off, cause I

“Good, good. Mycroft’s over at the flat. They’re looking at swatches. It’s been nothing but wedding planning for weeks.” John groaned as he sat at the second chair, waving over a waitress and ordering the same meal as Greg. Greg gave him a sympathetic look as the waitress swiftly retreated behind the counter.
“What’s it matter to you?”
John took a look out the glass wall that separated Greg’s office from the bullpen. A little girl sat on a bench, thoroughly unimpressed at whatever Donovan was saying to her. She had pale skin, probably from being locked inside all her life, dark golden hair that fell in ringlets around thin shoulders, and wide, intelligent, sad blue eyes. The girl flicked her world-weary gaze up and made eye contact with John. John could almost feel the misery in her bones.
“You’re restless.” Sherlock finally stated.
Sherlock was silent for a moment before his hands clutched John and pulled him close. “I always wonder… what will it be.”
person? A turtle who showed his belly to none but John. How could John possibly hope to shoulder this honor? How could two people so stunted and emotionally damaged possibly hope to help piece one and other together after living lives as merely fragments of human beings?
John stared at him with dead eyes, the image flickered.
“I thought we weren’t people?” Sherlock asked quietly. Mycroft swallowed and shook his head.
The bleeding woman sneered at John as she forced the young girl to her feet. The girl was shoved none too gently in his direction and with his right hand, he tugged her behind him. Sherlock again said something in French and all the cult members sullenly stood against the wall opposite John and Sherlock. The woman who had been holding the ancient dagger threw it at Sherlock’s feet with disgust before joining her comrades.
