“Make sure I’m clean,” Sherlock interrupted in a tone which was discouraged and disgusted at the same time, though it was impossible to tell just exactly with whom he was disgusted. After a few minutes John felt sorry for him and poured him a cup of tea. He pushed it towards him and said, “Go get your milk and sugar. You’re gonna need fortifying.”
John glanced over the letter. He’d started with Greg’s. The insults regarding Sherlock’s ability to disappear from a locked room in the beating heart of New Scotland Yard, were sprinkled thinly throughout and would have to be expunged, but the apologetic tone was surprisingly sincere. Sherlock understood the distress he had caused and had clearly considered the nuances of the connections he shared with Greg.
Sherlock went to him and settled onto his knees and said, “I’m, uh, sorry about the, uh, well,” and pointed between his legs where he was halfway to a decent erection. John shrugged and said, “It’s to be expected. It’s been four days. I’m not far behind you. Just make sure to situate yourself…precisely, shall we say,” and he shifted on the chair. Sherlock leered and draped himself, precisely, dragging his stiffening cock over John’s thigh.
Purposely provocative, Sherlock interrupted him. “Says the man who shredded my arse to ribbons.”
It  had started as a romantic Friday night dinner that Sherlock had picked up from Angelo’s after deducing that John had had a miserable, mucus-filled shift at the surgery. It warmed John’s heart to see the fire and candles lit, the table laid, the smell of the eggplant parmesan drifting through the flat. (It was the one vegetable dish, besides the thing with peas, that Sherlock would eat. John and Angelo insisted on using the Italian, Melanzane alla Parmigiana, because neither of them were convinced that Sherlock actually knew it was a vegetable dish.) The wine was open and flowing and the sexual tension built deliciously all through the meal.
Sherlock rolled over unconsciously and cried out as his rear hit the mattress. “Why are you waking me up to face my misery? Let me sleep. My arse hurts.”
Mycroft took pity and said to him, “I will summarize. You can expound on the details later in private if you choose.” Sherlock turned to look out the window again and Mycroft spoke to John. “The Detective Chief Inspector discovered the efficacy of physical discipline in the context of a mutually respectful and…” he wrinkled his nose slightly, “affectionate relationship. And he added the incentive of access to crime scenes. He served as something of a benevolent authority figure, shall we say, and sought to leverage Sherlock’s need for approval,” Sherlock’s jerked around, but Mycroft continued “against his self-destructive behavior. A formal protocol of physical discipline was effective, to everyone’s surprise, but the emotional costs were significant and once again, all parties consented to a lessening of the previously agreed upon, penalties, let’s call them ”
The warmth in his chest helped expand his ribcage a bit, and John relaxed some.
John sighed. “I don’t like the cane, Sherlock.” A shake this time. “You don’t either.” Another shake. “It feels like the right thing this time, though, doesn’t it.” He waited for another move of the head but the only movement was a deep sigh.
"It's a crime scene. I don't want it contaminated. Are we clear on that?" He sneered.
“I used to go to one hotel to dine when the time permitted it. When I wasn’t chasing criminals. They served the most exquisite roasted pheasant with rosemary, glazed carrots, asparagus with hollandaise, and when I had a sweet tooth, a tiramisu. Their merlot wine was smooth and fruity.” Sherlock stated in a dream like voice as he came to.
” He thought as he looked down the hall to the siren calling door. Sure he had no notion of wanting to go in. That was invading privacy. But the fact he was warning him, heavily warning him, had to mean something. What skeletons was he keeping in his room? Especially if John was threatened with pain of death.
“More along the lines of great-great uncle per say. It is by some miraculous chance that we share the same bloodline.” The man explained as he stood and readjusted his suit.
“If you’re not the typical vampire and the myths hardly apply to you, then do you have…you know.”
"There wasn't a case. There was never any suitcase."
Mycroft’s expression quickly changed to a stony mask. A common feature that secured his thoughts on doubting if he and Sherlock were indeed related.
“No, Watson.” Holmes straightened himself up. “One place is strictly the limit for the recently deceased.”
John's face must've said it all as he threw him a look and the man's face instantly fell into confusion.
“Ah, morning John! Good to see you
John’s heart began to settle down and the white knuckle bearing he had, had on the sofa eased up.
“Alright. I’ll see you back home.”
He most likely didn’t want money. Why would he need it if he was wanting to ‘relieve’ John of finance burden? He must want blood instead. His blood in leu of rent. Why else would he want to ‘relieve’ him of any financial burden? Why hunt for your food if you could have a live in snack? God, he would have to conceal bite marks, treat himself for blood loss, not to mention it would literally drain him.
The sickening crunch of the man’s esophagus that came next made John’s hair stand on end. Sherlock’s fingers pressed in deeper taking a firmer hold and with a sudden jerk, ripped out the man’s throat with his bare hand. Blood poured and flew out of the man’s neck as though a bomb had exploded from inside, splattering whatever laid in its wake. Sherlock released his grasp on the man’s body and, like a finality of a theatrical performance, it fell to its closed curtain.
“Sherlock, what in the Illuminati
"So where are we?" Sherlock asked.
“It would’ve helped.”
A creak from the foundation above made the detective stop abruptly in his tracks.
Emelia Ricoletti.”
“Has he been up at all since I was at work?”
“How often do you need it?”
“Very well quid pro quo.”
"Oh." the man said in surprise as he quickly glanced at Mike. "Thank you."
“Never exhibited or never tried? Or won’t say?”
“A hurry, yes. She was alive when she was being dismembered.”
"Sherlock, hello."
twins, Watson!”
“What does food do to a vampire? Does it repel you?” John asked.
“Before, when you asked if you were going into war, I should’ve explained myself better. With me you always be on the invisible battlefield. There is a constant danger lurking in every corner waiting to strike. Like a snake hiding in the grass. But I know you have your own battles to fight and I would not want to bring you into a war that you are not prepared for or even wanting to be in for that matter.”
“I just…I just wondered why all the concealment?”
Just observing it gave John a cold chill down his spine. Something didn’t look right about it. Every other movie or TV show he had seen the vampire simply bite their victims. Two punctures and that was it. Why did Sherlock’s look like he was mauled and assaulted? Bit multiple times in such a violent manner, uneven and not straight made John’s mind jump to one conclusion.
Sherlock’s eyes widened slightly and looked at the mug in his hands with confusion.
“No. Just making sure you’re ok.” John retrieved his hand.
Sherlock sighed and added another text.
“They must be at the very fore front of your brain. What is it?”
good."
He put on a smile that John couldn't exactly tell was the true smile of this man or one of a fiendish devil. It wasn't till again John realized what the detective had said that made him see the inner question of what he was asking.
With baited breath the doctor dared not move or even speak with the cold act of murder still hanging fresh in the air. He had feeling if he did he would set off the vampire and he would strike again. The next target being him. His eyes were glued on Sherlock’s form as the vampire tossed aside the man’s flesh he had clutched in his hand. Slowly, he turned to face John, the full horror of his actions painted on him in splash work on his clothes and across his face.
“Yes you are. You’re practically blushing!”
Here he had hoped to bring home some blood for Sherlock, but his day had literally went to hell in a hand basket. Oddly, when John left the hospital there was no black car waiting for him. Perhaps Mycroft got tired and went back to his hole of a government office. Seemed like the inability to wait was another Holmes family trait. Why was he not surprised. Either way it made little difference to him and to be completely honest he was tired, hungry, and was in need of much needed rest after today’s mess. Actually it was miracle he hadn’t fell asleep on the bus ride back to Baker St.
Sherlock remained silent. Not even a grunt in acknowledgement or a change in his stony exterior to hint that he had heard him. Time for a different approach.
“Good, Watson! Lost in her own reality. But now the reason why the murderer wanted her dead. That is one motive we have yet to establish. Where is she, Lestrade?”
The Inspector returned then, leaning on the doorframe as they watched them. John knew he was going to have to say something and he was on a two minute time crunch. He leaned down forward, taking a whiff of the dead woman's face. Nothing out of sort. Next he looked at her hand. Her fingernails were jagged, not like the immaculate manicure she had before. Years at Azkaban definitely did a number on her.
"Colleague of mine, Doctor Watson. Doctor Watson, Sergeant Sally Donovan. Old friend."
"Oh. It's not a flat share with you?" John asked confused.
"Sorry, Mrs. Hudson, I'll skip the tea. Off out." He called out to Mrs. Hudson as him and Sherlock reached the bottom landing.
He swiftly made it to the staffing room where he kept his personal items and put the bags into the lunch box. Throwing on his coat and with a determined route to get out of the hospital, John made it outside without being stopped. Safe at last. At least so he thought.
Sherlock's head cocked to the side watching John in curiosity.
"Thanks. I'll let you know if anything else comes up." John ended the call and shoved the phone back into his pocket.
"Who are you? What do you do?"
The nature of her question left him baffled that she would ask such a thing. He thought for a moment and rather than letting Sherlock risk his career over his presence maybe it would better if he backed out of the situation if it was going to be a problem. He could always watch him from the sidelines.
“I understand.” Replied John.
Sherlock rested his hands on the arms of the chair and looked down at the now interesting floor below him. To John he seemed nervous as if he was trying to ready himself to divulge a horrible secret. Sherlock took a steady breath and willed his eyes to look at John once more. Now with more will power and determination.
Fishing for the phone from his pocket he flips it around to show his proof on a webpage he had pulled up; the weather for the current day's weather, particularly southern Britain. Cardiff in question had been dosed in heavy rain, just like he said.
“Very well. I’ll be back in a few. Nice meeting you dear.” She left out the kitchen door and made down the stairs. “But like I said, just this once!”
“Right. Too early in the morning for this.” John made his way to the kitchen and flipped on the kettle. There was nothing a dose of tea couldn’t help.
A colleague? He had went from stranger, to flatmate and now a colleague in just three days. How did this happen? As far as John knew they were going to lead separate lives, he would pay his way in the blood that the vampire required and that would be that. This unexpected shift caught him off guard. He had a hard time believing that he would actually need his help, but his excuse seemed genuine. He supposed as long as he was helping and not getting in the way or possibly any confrontation, he could go.
“Oh God.”
"I know you're an Army doctor and you've been invalided home from Afghanistan. I know you've got a brother who's worried about you, but you won't go to him for help because you don't approve of him – possibly because he's an alcoholic; more likely because he recently walked out on his wife. And I know that your therapist thinks your limp's psychosomatic – quite correctly, I'm afraid."
"Oh no! That's not fair. Everyone who meets him needs to be initiated. It truly is a gift. For a muggle." Mike fawned over the subject in question.
“Are you sure you weren’t doing more than just…watching me for the past two weeks? Did you ever go into my flat?”
Sherlock drew back from the microscope and let out a sigh.
“A flatmate? You brought me all the way here because you needed a flatmate? Personally I don't see what is so abnormal about asking someone about a flat share. On the street. In public. Though I will say I do cross the line at being kidnapped by a potential flatmate. Any way I already have a flat so I hate to burst your bubble. Now, if I can have my gun back, I think I will be going. I’ve been here longer than I care to.”
"This is absolutely ridiculous. Either he is mad and needs to go to the funny farm or its actually true. Jesus really? 240 types of tobacco ash? Did…did he smoke them all or what? Identifying markers on certain people and careers…London mud…my God this is crazy."
Sherlock handed John the mug and sat in his own grey chair. He had hoped that this subject would never come up. That John would continue on to believe that he had simply snatched him up, blacked out, whatever story he had told himself. John was smarter than that though. Smarter than he gave him credit for. He saw it in his eyes that night when he had brought him home. All the gears turning and falling into place as he tried to take his pulse. The way he looked at his watch and his brows creased together in confusion, not from the lack of Sherlock’s physical norms, but from realizing what time it was. John’s eyes had ever so slightly looked away as he thought about it, ignoring the task at hand. Sherlock had thought he had derailed John’s way of thinking then. Obviously not.
wearing it!"
His heavy thoughts jolted him back from his internal ramblings to the present. Peering over to Lestrade, he schooled his features to one of indifference. There was no need to alarm the Yard if they saw that even he was starting to have his doubts. Especially if the possibilities of the supernatural could be in question.
The camera swiveled away, turning its body from the phone box. John could feel his heart beat steadily faster.
John immediately jumped from the reclined position he had taken on a sofa to a stock straight pose, clutching onto the furniture within an inch of its life. His vision now fixed on, what he assumed was, his captor. Though he didn’t exactly look the part. John’s version of a kidnapper was a burly man, which was no description of this one, as he looked too lean. He certainly had doubts he could’ve hauled him off the street. Perhaps he had help. He appeared tall in the small chair he sat in and had his legs draped one over the other in a relaxed manner. He was posh yet dressed darkly in a suit and a button up shirt to match. He had long pale boney fingers that he had intertwined together across his lap and a face was so still and angular John thought for a second he was a statue. In contrast to his pale features, ebony curls decorated his head with a gloss like sheen. However, what unnerved John the most about the man was his pale eyes. They seemed to penetrate right into one’s soul.
come to
Sherlock’s head tilted slightly to the side as he gave off an eerie smile of his own. John thought it looked too unnatural on his face as though the man didn’t smile too often.
John has some conflicting feelings as he stays the first night with Sherlock.
Looking on, John was just the same not three months prior. Anytime the Auror office had a new case or lead he was gone in a flash. Never staying in one place for too long. He decided that this was indeed a smidge of jealously he felt at the muggle. One who in mere hours, if all went smoothly, he would never see again, and in return the man would never know of John. He would just be another face in the crowd.
"Take a seat and I shall be out momentarily. Dr. Watson, I presume?"
“Evening Dr. Watson. Why don’t you come along for the ride?” Mycroft beckoned.
With every step up the stairs John’s heart beat a little faster. What was he going to tell him? It wasn’t as if he had anticipated this. Sure there was bound to be mass injuries once in a great blue moon, but a terrorist attack that wiped out the whole hospital’s supply of blood? The whole second half of his shift had been a nightmare. It felt like Afghanistan all over again. Just like Afghanistan.
John was dumfounded. So, he was just an undead man that barely slept and drank blood for his daily diet.
John’s thoughts encouraged him on as he wrapped the tourniquet around his right arm.
The muggle spun back on his heel, just before he could reach the front door, to face the elderly woman. His face was lit up full of excitement.
It must have been from John’s lack of response that Sherlock abruptly stopped speaking to study the doctor. The detective’s eyes gave a brief scan of John from everything to the expression that worried his features to the way his posture held a defeated slump. He could hear John’s heart beat like a accelerating pounding mallet banging upon the walls of the muscled organ.
“Yea. I’m used to the heat. Couple of years out in the desert will do that to you.”
John’s eyes jumped to Sherlock’s.
"... but the police don't go to private detectives."
"I can always Obliviate him and move on right?
John wasn’t exactly sure what the vampire meant by fun, but the harsh light of the computer screen was starting to take a toll on his retina’s. He made his way to the kitchen and dug the curry out of the fridge, throwing it in the microwave to cook.
However, it wasn’t the only thing John had noticed. He couldn’t deny that he had seen some long side ways glances towards him from the vampire. He knew he had to be hungry, starving. Usually these staring fits started out as nothing more than one of his deep immersions into his mind palace. His eyes would be out of focus, his hands clasped in concentration under his chin, never moving a muscle. Though John had learned to be vigilant during his time in the army. He had developed an almost sixth sense and could tell when reality shifted to a more dangerous setting. And this was one of those moments.
“I’m…I’m sorry. The offer is tempting, truly. A very nice gesture and I can see you thought it all out, but maybe someone else could help you.” John backed away and grabbed his briefcase off the coffee table in a hurry. His mind forgetting about his confiscated weapon.
"Try the main road." She lifted up the police tape and John slid under.
“I trust you slept well?” he asked as he turned away from John and back into the kitchen, flipping on the kettle on the counter.
If anyone had told him before he was sent back home that he would be living with a vampire who was probably a century old detective, going after criminals and providing him blood so he wouldn’t starve himself, he would’ve asked them what drugs they had been taking. Even if they told him that there was a man that was going to be providing him a home, friendship, and the most craziest way to relieve him of his pains from war, he still would’ve been skeptical. Sherlock had brought balance to his once chaotic life and he had to say it wasn’t so bad after all.
"Where?" Sherlock didn't miss a beat with the Inspector, his demeanor changed again to how he was before in the lab, wiping all emotions aside and focusing on the work at hand.
"Not at all Harry. And swing by the Burrow tonight. Perhaps we can all have a family dinner…Ginny will be there." He added in with slight hopefulness.
Before John could fully comprehend what was happening Sherlock was gone in a fell flash. All he could hear next was the gurgling choked out groan that echoed within the concrete walls. Then silence. Focusing more at where the intruder had once been, stood Sherlock. His hand, that could bring out the pleasant tunes of any ethereal instrument, was bringing out the sounds of death. He grasped the neck of the man so tightly his fingers dug into the skin that was quickly turning red from the lack of oxygen. The man was far from being scared of the detective before him, he was down right petrified of the demon that held his life from the brink of existence.
John was dumbfounded for a moment. It would be risking his career stealing blood from the hospital. Though the prospect of living rent free would be easier on his wallet. But what would happen if he got caught? More or less what would happen if he didn’t bring anything home?
“I don’t see how you can’t just, I don’t know, smell down a suspect if they have the victim’s blood on them.” John knew he was pressing his luck by asking such a question, but in all honesty he was truly interested. Though the last thing he wanted to do was make Sherlock feel like he was asking him because he was fascinated by his infliction.
Sherlock rose up from the sofa and made his way towards his room. Locking the door from the outside world to his small refuge.
John almost voiced his disbelief until he looked back at the victim and really observed. To see like a Felisian he had to think like one. If he was looking for his “mouse”, so to speak, he would need to find out where he had been. And true to his word there was a significant amount of dust on the victim’s clothes.
“Poetry or truth?” Watson asked, repeating Holmes's earlier question he had asked the Inspector.
"You were thinking. It's annoying." John shared a look to the Inspector beside him who looked equally as confused as John. He didn't know how to read minds, right? John shook his head at the ridiculous thought of this muggle reading minds. No he clearly proved himself in the cab ride to the crime scene. He just saw and observed. He now watched Sherlock as he glided across the room, looking, making mental notes in his mind, circling the dead woman on the floor. He reminded him of a trained blood hound searching for a scent. Anything that would lead him onto the right path.
"Shot in the dark. Good one, though. Power connection: tiny little scuff marks around the edge of it. Every night he goes to plug it in to charge but his hands are shaking. You never see those marks on a sober man's phone; never see a drunk's without them." He handed back John's phone, dropping it in his hands. "There you go, you see, you were right."
"Really?" His voice came out surprised "I thought it was a big improvement. Your mouth's too.. small now."
In the past two weeks he had visibly seen the detective become paler and paler. A dusting of purple underlined his eyes once again and his movements had become more sluggish. Life was slowly draining from Sherlock. By the time the third week had ended Sherlock had stopped working on the terrorist case due to the fact he was now more sensitive to sunlight. This had him make a cover for Lestrade that he was severely sick with the flu. But in turn this meant the sitting room curtains had to be drawn during the day time so he could venture freely throughout the flat.
As he scooped up some of the lubricant that had leaked out along with the plug, John kissed the dimple of Sherlock's lower back. “Shut up. I’ll buy you another. Now, pay attention. You’ve got the real thing.” He slicked himself and directed his cock towards the emptiness the plug had left. Sherlock was so ready for him, John was comfortable skipping his usual foreplay, the methodical (tedious and unnecessary according to Sherlock) stretching of his passageway. He slid, forever, into the slippery, wet heat in one long, slow push. His breath caught in his throat as Sherlock whimpered beneath him.
John was startled out of his reverie when the shower started to run cold. Time to stop thinking. He had a record breaking speed-wank to be sure his body wouldn’t be confused about the purpose of the evening’s main event. This was not going to be spanking as foreplay. He didn’t want to run the risk of undermining Sherlock’s punishment with his own arousal. The man could sense weakness like a shark could sense blood in the water. John couldn’t afford to send him any mixed messages. He toweled off and put on a sturdy, sober pair of pyjamas. He grabbed a flannel and to further clarify the boundaries, he brought a straight-backed chair into the bedroom with him. Starting off on the bed was too ambiguous.
When John had finished working Sherlock through his shuddering release, he reached for his head to draw him into another bruising kiss and collapsed onto him, sending the table crashing to the floor, split neatly down the middle. Fortunately Sherlock’s skull was held safely away from the impact by John’s capable hands and casualties were limited to the furniture. Once John had checked Sherlock twice over for injuries, despite his protestations, a most unusual look spread across his sculptured face. It was dread. With widened eyes, he said, “What are we going to tell Mrs. Hudson?” like a boy who was terrified of a scolding.
“Ugh, Sherlock! Stop. Go. More, less--make up your mind already.” He stared at the ceiling for a few seconds and it was silent but for their deep, rapid breathing. He reminded himself it was Sherlock’s turn to choose.
John thought a little cuddling on the sofa might help fortify them for the last round of punishment. Sherlock curled up with his head on John’s leg and shouted at the program for a half an hour, while John let his fingers run through his hair and scratched his scalp. Sherlock squirmed in pleasure and nuzzled his cheek against John’s thigh. John would stop from time to time just for the pleasure of having Sherlock try to make him keep going without actually asking for it. He would grumble or butt his head up against John’s belly. Once he actually picked up John’s hand and put it back on his own head.
“How much longer do you think until I’m fit for duty?” he asked while gyrating his bum just a bit.
“This...” Sherlock croaked and paused. He cleared his throat before trying again. “This is ok.”
John swung the paddle across both cheeks and the sound startled both of them: an echo of the rubber meeting flesh that bounced around the room. The color sprang up immediately, a bright pink imprint, staining the milky white.
, now,” Sherlock complained, rolling his eyes.
“I’m the judge, remember? I’ll judge your sincerity. And if it’s merely apparent sincerity, it won’t do at all.” He started to read. Sherlock stood in front of him expectantly. John looked up at him and said, “It’s going to take me a little while, Sherlock. Find something to do.”
Routine check-ins from half 12 to 2. Sherlock texted him at 2:30.
“Let me elaborate a bit. Option number 1 would obligate you to agree in writing to agree unreservedly and in advance to my judgement. If at any point you fail in your cooperation with the consequences I determine to be appropriate, Option number 2 would immediately go into effect. Option number 2…well, I’ll leave you to deduce. Option number 1 would only be effective in preempting Option number 2 if the court determines that the consequences of Option number 1 were appropriate to the severity of the crime, of course. You may now take 30 minutes to consider these options and ask questions, which I will answer if I consider them appropriate and at the end of 30 minutes you will tell me your decision. If you decline to choose, Option 2 will be chosen for you. I will leave the room so you can deliberate.” He ceremonially ticked the timer on his watch.
“My point exactly. So have you. Let’s stay focused on what we can do now. Are the students gone? Can you run round to the lab and check if he’s there?”
“Come on up here. There you go. I’ve got you.” He helped him up to sitting, making sure his arse was hanging over the edge of his lap and pulling his face into his shoulder. He rubbed his fingers through his hair and held him tight, murmuring meaningless sounds and comforting words while Sherlock cried. “It’s all right now, it’s all over and you were very brave. Go ahead and cry yourself out. As long as you need. I’m here and I’m not going anywhere.”
, he hissed. He was kicking himself thinking about how much cumulative skin Sherlock had been flashing around all these years.
A final pull, a drag of the tongue and Sherlock’s mouth filled with come. He was careful not to lose a drop. John panted, his hips thrusting as he chased the sensations fueling his climax. The view of his lover, eyes closed, swallowing, sent new tremors through him. Sherlock concentrated on sucking, while his hand sped up on himself. In less than a minute he threw his head back and rode his own wave of pleasure, shuddering and spurting onto his chest. He fell onto John’s lap, like his bones had turned to jelly. John fell forward, laying his head on top of Sherlock’s.
“I haven’t even touched you yet and look how hard you are.” Sherlock looked and looked back at John with pleading eyes. “You’re going to have to breathe though. Deep breaths, remember?”
Abashed not in the slightest, he said, “Yes, John, I am more than capable of thinking and keeping time simultaneously.” John gave him raised eyebrows and with a humbler attitude, Sherlock dropped his eyes and said, “I wasn’t doing it consciously. I’m…sorry.” He looked up again and John gave him a reassuring smile. “I was thinking about what I could have done. I thought of seven things. Do you want to hear them?” he asked shyly.
Sherlock reached up and wiped the tears from John’s cheeks with his fingertips and asked, “Not sad? Not disappointed?” John shook his head and said, “Sentimental crying. Not sad, not disappointed, I promise.” He kissed his forehead. Sherlock studied his face carefully and seeing the truth of the words there, he inhaled deeply in relief and dropped his head back into John’s lap. John ran his fingers through Sherlock’s hair and rubbed his back until his breathing had slowed down and his muscles relaxed somewhat. “Shhh. It’s all good. In fact, let’s call the weekend officially over, ok? Punishment is finished. We’ve both had way more catharsis than necessary, yeah?”
Sherlock shifted from one foot to the other and said quickly, “Yes, yes sir, six is more than enough!”
John climbed onto the bed and settled himself between Sherlock’s feet. He held Sherlock’s ankles, stilling his legs for the first time since they’d been tied. He moved up, forcing Sherlock to spread his legs wider and as he did, Sherlock thrust his hips up and down, stretching towards nothing he could reach. John sat back and watched him for a moment, then crawled up over him and laid down flat on top of him, touching as much of his skin with his own as he could, arms to arms, chest to chest and hips to hips. “I’m touching you, I’m touching everything I can reach."
“John, I know you are ambivalent towards my boxing, but I’ve decided that you’re coming with me tonight. Boxing is an important activity in my life, and I go with you to the pub on occasion, even though I find it loathsome. Isn’t it right that you reciprocate?”
Sherlock scowled at him, but a blush rose under his lovely cheekbones. He claimed to hate that “puerile, infantilizing, drivel,” but he sucked it up like a desert flower. John knew Sherlock would never get enough of it. He loved watching him open up, soften and relax in the warmth and affection John lavished him with. And he loved teasing him about it.
to follow through, otherwise, I won’t be able to trust you either. In fact, I've actually done myself a disservice. You mustn’t even show me any mercy. If you waver, I will be tempted to experiment to see if you can be manipulated in the future.”
Sherlock turned his head towards the back of the sofa and John struggled to hear him. “Yes. The answer is yes. My parents were constitutionally incapable of physical discipline. The teachers and headmaster wore out their canes on me and I never saw it as anything other than a challenge. Prepared me quite well for Serb—“he cut off quickly, looking at John, who had closed his eyes and turned his head away, “future experiences.” Sherlock waited until John had turned back around. “They were contemptible. Mycroft was…not. There was a time that I looked up to him,” adding quickly, “it’s only natural for a younger sibling.” He looked again at John, trying to judge his reaction.
“I’m on my way. I’ll ring back if I find him.”
Sherlock hummed and murmured out, “Coming?”
John frowned and gave a disapproving, “Hmmm.” He looked up at him. “Again? Something wrong with my technique?”
Greg snorted. “Never saw my self as a priest.”
finished, brilliant. You forgot something.” He stripped off a sock, careful this time, not to make the slightest sound.
This chapter includes caning, so if that doesn't float your boat, you can skip it without losing too much of the plot.
“No mustard. Eat.”
“Tell me you brought lube, ‘cause I’m gonna fuck you in this alley, over those steps, till you can’t walk. Remind you who you belong to.” He pulled the collar of the coat off his shoulder and sucked another bruise over his collarbone.
John squared his shoulders at the landing and pushed Sherlock through the door to the flat. Mycroft was sitting in Sherlock’s chair, ankle crossed over knee, mobile in hand.
Now, to the even greater shame of my ruthless intellect, I care what those same people feel. Before I met you, I hardly realized that people felt things. Now I can imagine what their feelings are and, with those very few to whom I have previously referred, I, upon certain occasions, actually feel what I imagine them to be feeling.
“I also don’t want to carry a grudge and it’s possible the next time you drive me mad, I’ll regret not having gone through with my spanking. But with the responsibility of carrying through with punishment, I also have the responsibility to judge its effectiveness. The purpose of this session was to make you more conscious of how your actions affect the people who love you and it’s clear to me that it’s been effective.”

“Yes Mycroft, I won’t leave him alone.”
) and gave him a hug, which Sherlock didn’t return, which Jack didn’t seem to mind. When Sherlock turned away, Jack slapped him on the arse. The arse. His hand touched. Sherlock’s. Arse. John stood up and squared his shoulders, trying to ignore the testosterone flooding his system.
“He’s gone, just bloody gone. I saw him, went to make coffee, no more than 2 minutes, and when I got back he was gone. Vanished. I’ve got everyone here doing a room to room and an APW on the street. Fuck!” John heard him slamming his hand down on the steering wheel. “He’s six feet tall! How does he just disappear? I’m heading to Crosley, but you better go to Brixton. Can you reach Billy?”
“Are you listening? What’s first?”
The welts had faded, leaving the colors of fading bruises, but all the lotion that had been massaged into that already smooth skin had left it velvety and John couldn’t wait to get his own skin onto it. He pushed Sherlock’s legs apart and crawled up between them. He stroked gently, cupping and rubbing circles with his palms, watching it ripple under his fingers. When he lowered his face and rubbed his own cheeks against Sherlock’s, his stubble prickled and that perfect arse rose up to meet it.
John gritted his teeth at his presumptuousness out of habit and erased the text. He walked over to the bedroom door and took Sherlock’s dressing gown off the hook, while he continued talking to Greg.
Wilder: Good evening, Doctor. You eat?
“I disobeyed the rules.”
“There we are. Initial results are promising. Should I retrieve my manual, Doctor?” Sherlock asked with mock scientific authority. John attempted to reply, but Sherlock gave the tip of his foreskin a delicate kiss, and the words couldn’t find their way out. Sherlock smirked and slid his mouth down, pulling the foreskin off the glans. His tongue swirled loosely. He wrapped his hand around the base. John moaned and kissed the top of Sherlock’s head. After a few passes up and down, the pre-come began to leak from the tip and Sherlock lapped it up like a kitten at a bowl of cream. John grabbed his hair a little tighter and Sherlock hummed. Using the slightest pressure, John pushed Sherlock’s head down, but he was so eager, he never felt it. One twist of his fist and John was completely erect.
Until Raul walked in the door.
Sherlock adamantly insisted, “NO! Of course I’m not enjoying it! You’ve seen my arse—I’m not going to be able to move normally for days as it is. Another one tonight is going to leave me crippled for a week. You don’t understand.” He shook his head in exasperation. “You must follow through. Don’t you see? The letter was true. I wrote it from ‘the heart’,” he said mockingly with gestured quotation marks around “heart”. “It was in no way calculated to influence my punishment. If you reward me, I won’t be able to trust my intentions in the future!” Confusion furrowed John’s brow and Sherlock gripped his knees.
Sherlock grumbled and whined, but John was relentless. “This is going to be cold and I want you to put a shirt on, a jumper maybe, so you don’t get chilled.”
“Unnecessary John. Mrs. Hudson is not nearly as sensitive as Graham. She’ll be overcome with emotion at my apparent sincerity.”
“Your skill level has nothing to do with this. You just want to get away from me. You’re tired of me because—”
When Mrs Hudson finished her tandoori, John waved the envelope under Sherlock’s nose and ordered another naan wrap for himself. Sherlock grabbed it and then took Mrs Hudson by the arm. They walked to look out over the lock and after a little while he handed her the envelope. While she read the letter, he twitched and fidgeted. She tucked it in her pocketbook and then took his cheeks between her hands and tilted his forehead down to rest on hers. They communed for a moment and she let him go. They chatted, or Mrs. Hudson chatted, for a while and when John finished his meal, they strolled home leisurely.
“Yes, sir.”
“All right then, what’s going to be different the next time you’re left under someone’s care?”
“5 for tone.” 5 smacks.
John sighed and tilted his head dubiously, but kept his voice neutral. “Maybe the summer suit. Silk.”
John thanked his lucky stars again to know that everyone was just as invested in Sherlock staying clean as he was.
It moved on towards lunchtime, but he was reluctant to interrupt him. Watching Sherlock at work was one of his favorite occupations at any time. It was positively delicious the way he fidgeted while he was writing—so different from the way he conducted himself when he was thinking abstractly. When puzzling through a crime or in his mind palace, he was positively statue-like in his perfect stillness. Now he scratched his head, tugged on his curls, rubbed his nose, lips, forehead, fiddled with the pen, putting it down and picking it up. John had to look away when he sucked on the tip or nibbled at it, but otherwise he was rapt.
Sherlock came back in a few minutes in the coveralls again. John looked at him questioningly. “As I expected. Too tight. Front and back.”
“First time you break a rule—” John interrupted, “He won’t be breaking any rules if he knows what’s good for him.” Sherlock slid his eyes sideways to look at him, but Lestrade carried on, “First time, your leg gets cuffed to the desk. Second time, hand to the chair. Third time,” he turned back to John, “special delivery back to Dad,” jerking his head toward John. Sherlock crossed his arms in indignation and huffed.
A shy smile spread across Sherlock’s face. “I’m going to do a little work on the heavy bag and cool down. Then take a shower.” He turned towards the bag, and looked over his shoulder. “If you don’t mind the extra time, I’d like Raul to do a little work on my lower back. I think I feel some tightness there. Wouldn’t want to cramp up or anything.”
“You’re right about that. Cheers.”
Sherlock felt a surge of power knowing he was needy and wanting him. His cock throbbed in a feedback loop synchronized with John’s desire. He teased him, shaking his head slowly, but he kept his finger moving. “Noooo. That’s not true. Not exactly, John. You’ve been taking showers that are approximately 12 minutes longer than usual, and since I believe the universe is rarely that lazy, I would say that it is no coincidence that 12 minutes is the average time it takes you to have one of those wanks you think you’re having surreptitiously. I’m the one who’s actually been waiting, rather stoically, I might add, and now I’m going to take my time.”
Sherlock made a final attempt to forestall the inevitable, “I’m clean. I swear,” to no effect. Lestrade’s look was enough: he’d heard it all before. He glanced at John who gave permission with a shrug of his shoulder. First he turned around and fished in the pockets of the coat on the back of the door, including the inner breast pocket and the one sewn into the hem. Nothing. Then he walked towards Sherlock with purpose and began his physical examination. He put his hands on either side of Sherlock’s head and John marveled at Greg’s courage and Sherlock’s temerity. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d seen Sherlock so compliant with another person, although he’d never enquired as to the depth and nature of their relationship. Greg tilted Sherlock’s head back and pulled on his upper lids, then down on the lower. Head up again, flashing his nostrils with his standard issue penlight. He flickered it quickly into each eye and Sherlock blinked. He grabbed his left wrist, straightened out his arm, and pulled up the sleeve, checking it for pinpoint blood stains He ran his fingers all the way up and over his inner elbow. He pulled the sleeve down and repeated the procedure on the right arm. He frisked him head to toe, ruffling his hair, searching his pockets. He poked between the toes of his bare feet and when he stood up, fists on his hips, Sherlock began to unbuckle his belt.  John interrupted him.
Lestrade shouted into the phone, trying to make himself heard over the siren blaring.
John was magnanimous in victory. “That’s the beauty of it. Nothing. Not a thing. You don’t have to do anything. Just be naked on the bed at eight o'clock tomorrow night and I will take care of everything. And, uh, don’t worry. I got Mrs Hudson tickets to see Iron Maiden.” He kissed him and headed for bed, whistling cheerfully.
Sherlock looked and made as if to sit up, but John placed his hand on his chest and said, “Don’t move. Just watch.” He took hold of himself and stroked, slowly at first but it wasn’t long before he was pumping rapidly and throwing his head back as he came, spurting up and across Sherlock’s flushed chest. Sherlock scooped up a fingerful and licked it delicately off his finger, as John watched and shuddered, then lowered himself so that all his weight was crushing Sherlock to the mattress. Not enough pressure apparently because he felt Sherlock’s arms clasping him even more tightly. “You took my breath away already, love, let me catch up.” Sherlock complained but allowed John to roll over onto his back. “That was amazing.”
Sherlock groaned and dropped his head into his hands. Greg had been the first and only one able to rescue him from his habit, back in the days when there was serious fear he might actually succeed in killing himself. He had stumbled upon the method in a fit of desperate frustration after Sherlock had disappeared for a 3-day bender. He’d been young enough at the time to be taken over Greg’s knee and the pain and humiliation of it had served its purpose. The mere threat of a repeat had kept Sherlock clean for a year and a half. It was still effective, although John was now the administrator. (It was no consolation that they’d discovered recreational spanking to be an enjoyable activity for both of them.)  Sherlock would have to avoid sitting and Greg would be able to tell that he was sore from a mile off. He would take great satisfaction sharing the secret knowledge with John and Mrs. Hudson. He’d tease without mercy and John would try not to grin while Sherlock blushed furiously to the confusion of everyone not in on the joke. Even the Belstaff could not shield him from the indignity.
Mickey gave him the formal tour and John kept his eyes peeled for the fellows whose names he had engraved in his memory. He attempted a casual question. “So, Mickey, who’s the cornerman tonight?”
Sherlock gave him an obligatory scowl to disguise his shy smile. John came up behind him to give him a hug, from the waist up, trying to maintain a safe distance between their hips.
He took pity on him. “All right, maybe you’re not ready for that yet. Why don’t I ask questions and you answer them? That might make it easier. Okay?”
John nodded at Sherlock and he stood up, throwing his shoulders back and clasping his hands behind his back. John approved. Best to face it like a soldier.
“Yes, love?”
John knew keeping silent was killing him. “When Greg finishes, you can make your defense, plead your case and ask for mercy, but in the end, Sherlock, they’re going to be my decisions. No arguing, as per the arrangement.” He put his hand over Sherlock’s. “We were so scared,” he said quietly, “and sometimes scared looks like angry. Remember that when Greg gets here.”
Now he grumbled. He looked over his shoulder. “What? What is it? Can’t I sleep now?”
He took one look at Sherlock’s face and said, “Option 1 then.” He sat in the chair next to him and began writing.
Sherlock got down to business. He was quiet, his focus fixed on the prominence rubbing up against his stomach. He pushed up and back off John and had to swallow. His mouth was watering. It was rosy pink against the tan of his belly and he couldn’t wait to get his lips around it. “Now that’s a plan. You first because, I’m not going to last anyway. I’ve missed you.” And he dropped his head, mouth open, eyes fixed on him. John groaned and reached down to tangle his fingers in Sherlock’s hair.
Sherlock glared at John then and stuck his hand out for the folder yet again. This time, John handed it over. Sherlock opened it and was transported immediately. He took the papers out, and absentmindedly held the folder out to the side and John took it from him. He put the pages down on the desk, fanned them out and handed some to John. He walked to Lestrade’s bulletin board and stuck some up with pins and whipped up a snowstorm of paper around the room. Then he got to the photos. Lestrade and John stepped back and let him work his magic. He ordered and reordered and sorted and picked then up again. He picked up one of the stacks, flipped and reordered it and then shouted, “Oh. Oh. Of course! Take me there. Now!” He turned looking at the two of them in disbelief, projecting wordlessly:
They went downstairs to wait and John started the kettle. Sherlock leaned on the mantel, looking out the window for the long black car. He stiffened and stood straight just as John brought the tray to the table. Mycroft appeared, soundlessly sliding through the door with his usual impeccable authority. John thought,
John blew his own breath onto Sherlock’s rosy pink bud. Frustrated with the restriction of the trousers around Sherlock’s knees, he stepped back and pulled them off. He dove back and licked right up to the dripping head of his cock, where he swirled his tongue around lazily. He made the lewd, wet noises that brought a beautiful blush to Sherlock’s cheeks. From there, he slurped sideways from the tip back down to Sherlock’s puckered hole. Sherlock lifted his head to watch and John met his eyes with a wicked grin, sticking out his tongue as far as it would go and swiping around in hot, wet circles. Sherlock’s face was a bright red by now and he slammed his head back down on the table in agonized bliss. The poor table let out another creak. Or was it a crack? Sherlock groaned, “John, please, now, now, now…” John shoved his own trousers and pants back down again, shook one foot, then the other and stepped out of them. He pushed on the backs of Sherlock’s thighs, exposing him completely.
“What…what happens if I do?” John treaded cautiously, all cheerfulness from their previous conversations had completely vanished.
John had to practically run after Sherlock who had longer strides and moved faster than he did. He approached the body first, circling around it as he put on latex gloves. Probably picked from the cleaning cart, the doctor figured. John couldn’t help but make note of the deep sniff Sherlock gave off as he crouched down beside the deceased girl and produced a small magnifying glass from his pocket. Blood soaked the ground everywhere and on the girl herself. John wondered if Sherlock was ever tempted despite his declaration of celibacy towards drinking from a body. To him it must have looked like a buffet table the way her body was cut showing off every available artery and vein.
“Only what you inquired about. The CCTV footage from the tube station.” Mycroft retrieved a USB drive from the inside of his suit jacket.
"Both of you?!" She exclaimed coming out of her flat to see them out.
“And I’m supposing you know how I take it too?”
“How? How the hell did you know that? I have never talked to my therapist not once about the war let alone…this.” He gestured to his hand.
Though however crazy it was John wanted to know. How did he get his knowledge of his time in the middle east, his fake story of an army doctor, he didn't even have a brother so who was he thinking was his brother or even his therapist? Just how? He wanted answers!
“Stay put, stay quiet.” The detective said in a firm voice.
Wasn’t a brothel? John caught up to Sherlock and entered the mysterious building. The inside was more elaborately decorated and fashioned with the style and times of the late Victorian period. The antique furniture gave off an old leathery smell which could have easily been mistaken for the older gentlemen who were seated about. All of them appeared to be just as lavishly put together in suits like Sherlock always wore. Though none of them were seated near one another and it was deadly quiet. In fact so quiet one could hear a pin drop. The sign by the counter they approached was not one of welcome, but of warning. Absolute Silence.
John prompted, “Yes?”
Sherlock sounded startled and sarcastic simultaneously. “I can hardly do both at the same time.”
Sherlock took pity and on his next pass over the ring of muscles on the rim, he applied some pressure, watching how they stretched and took in his finger. John huffed sharply and Sherlock pulled out, afraid he might still somehow be going too quickly. John turned around to look at him, and said, “Go on already, you’re not going to break anything.” Sherlock smiled at him. John wanted this. With more confidence now, he pushed in, up to his first knuckle, moving in and out. John breathed, “More. More. More,” with every stroke.
“Well it’s not possible. I am meeting with the representative of the…a very important person and there are protocols that must be maintained. I don’t even have anywhere to lock him up! My whole staff is on call. You’ve got to get someone else. You will get someone else, won’t you?”
Sherlock lowered the top of the paper. A look of infinite suffering came over his face. “I have been able to count since I was two years of age, John. To one hundred, I’m told. I am aware that there is another letter to deliver.” He lifted the paper again. Quietly, he continued, “I am merely avoiding it.”
Sherlock made to pull his hand away, but John wouldn’t let him. “Ugh,” he said in revulsion, “Why do I need to tell you if you already know? It serves no purpose, John!”
John looked confused. “I don’t understand.”
On their way, John demanded Sherlock’s help with his sign language. “Show me ‘Good evening’ again,” he demanded.
“Shall I keep on, then?”
“Two for hedging. Be specific Sherlock, where were your legs?”
Thoroughly pleased with himself, Sherlock blurted out, “Shirt! Those are the buttons on your shirt!” John stroked down the side of his back over his ribs. “Well done, my genius!” Sherlock wriggled in pleasure and also, to rub his cock against the rumpled sheets below him. There was a damp spot there now, but he didn’t really notice.
Friday morning, John couldn’t get Sherlock to eat a thing. Using grocery shopping as an excuse, John reminded him he had two hours left to come up with a plan and left him to ping around like an electron round a nucleus. On the endless line at Tesco he texted:
Sherlock’s eyebrows flickered upwards, acknowledging the sense of it.
Pretending to be calm, John Captain-said, “I’ll tell you when I want you to lie down.” He ground himself up against him and Sherlock responded in kind. Fondling,
Mickey said, “That’s the clinch. It’s called the clinch. Normal part of a bout." Mickey gave him a sidelong glance. The bell rang surprisingly quickly and Sherlock returned to his corner and Jack, who got very busy with his hands. All over Sherlock. John decided the safest strategy was not to look. He chatted with Mickey, asking questions about the gym, gossiping about common acquaintances.
And now John was truly impressed. “The Diogenes Club. You really are my brilliant boy, aren’t you?” He walked over to Sherlock, bent down and kissed him. “How clever are you!”
John stood and pulled him to his feet. “Come on, up you get.”
John went to him and took his hands down from his face. He pulled him over by the chair, where he pushed him down onto his knees. Sherlock grimaced when his bum met the backs of his calves, but he adjusted himself and settled into the most comfortable position he could find, head bent and staring at the floor.
“Absolutely sure. I’ve been through this before. If Raul doesn’t take care of it, I’ll be struggling to move tomorrow.”
As soon as the car screeched to a halt, John flung the door open, and turned toward the cabbie, who cut him off, “I’ll wait.”
Sherlock spoke with resignation. “All things Mycroft call for the traditional. Keep calm and carry on, Queen and country. Bend over and think of England.”
Wriggling despite himself, Sherlock blurted, “Um, uh, I’m sorry, I don’t know!” This was a new level of punishment, being soundly spanked after a caning. His brain was going offline. John knew that Sherlock would have no doubt that the punishment hadn’t been watered down.
Sherlock took a deep breath and said, “Legs. Legs too.”
The next week was far more interesting in terms of cases, and far too busy to consider a session at the ring. John was looking forward to a domestic weekend, to make up for Sherlock’s complete disinterest in food, sleep, and/or sex. On Saturday morning, Mrs. Hudson called up the stairs, “Ooh-hoo, boys. Package.”
John licked over the spot he’d nibbled. “They say, ‘this will hurt me more than it hurts you.’ It’s the truth. Not being able to touch you like this? It hurts.” He reached behind and stroked Sherlock’s arse, still warm to the touch, hard enough to register somewhere between pleasure and pain. Sherlock drew away and his cock rubbed up against John’s belly. As he pulled back to frot again, his arse slid up against John’s strong hands and he rode the wave of sensations, in front and behind.
She answered, her brightness undiminished, “Are you cranky, Sherlock dear? It always takes a while for you to wake up, doesn’t it?”
“I didn’t hear anything. You’re cheating! There’s nothing left. John, I need you inside me,” Sherlock whined.
John said, “Ok. One more thing. I want to show you about being in charge.” He snapped the thread off the spool. “See? I’m not going to be restraining you. You’re going to be restraining yourself. But only if you want to. See?” He snapped another length of thread off. “Do you understand?””
Sherlock's flare of maturity has interrupted the course of consequences. The British government arrives to provide John with data he needs to make his decision. It's not pretty.
“Who was on top?”
Sherlock began whingeing as soon as the cab pulled away. “Can’t we do this somewhere else, John? Mycroft is hardly going to improve the situation.”
John used the hand he liberated from Sherlock’s back to reach under him and coat his hand in the lube still leaking down onto Sherlock’s bollocks. When it was slick enough he took hold of Sherlock's cock. Sherlock didn’t know whether to push forward into the fist stroking him or back onto the cock splitting him open. He went with both and between the two of them, they set up a rhythm that sent them hurtling towards a climax. John had no breath for anything but keeping up the punishing pace, while Sherlock was pleading and moaning, “Please, John, please, yes, more, don’t stop, John, John, John…” gradually devolving into babble as he got closer and closer.
Thank you to TiaOconnell for being here from beginning to end. I wouldn't have gotten here without you.
“And how many formal facilities were engaged?”
“Oh, God.”
“Don’t touch!”
That assurance brought on a brief spurt of harsher crying and John said, “I know you’re not keen on repetition, but I’m going to say it again anyway: I’m right here and I’m not going anywhere. You’re never going to get rid of me.” Sherlock grabbed him around the neck and John struggled for breath for a second. “Here, watch out, you’re gonna strangle me, you great gangly thing. Let me breathe.” Sherlock huffed out a teary laugh, and worked on getting himself together. Eventually he quieted down and John said, “Can we move to the bed for cuddling now, for your old, broken-down soldier? Give my shoulder a break.”
Sherlock opened his eyes and grimaced.
John’s omelet, toast, jam, and coffee were all on the table. He’d laid a place for Sherlock at the side table where he could stand comfortably, and although the discretion was appreciated, it couldn’t keep a lovely blush from rising up from his throat and onto his cheeks when he walked through the sliding doors. “Oh, God.” He covered his face in embarrassment. John rubbed his shoulder as he passed by and said, “Never mind, it’s just me.”
She kept on. “How are you feeling, Sherlock? I’ll just set a place for you here,” pointing to the side table. She lowered her voice conspiratorially, “You’ll be more comfortable.” Sherlock covered his eyes with his hand and abandoned the pretense. John tried to hide his own face by paying surgical-level attention to the spreading of butter.
Sherlock reached his hands around to grasp the cheeks of John’s arse and lifted his own hips against the pressure of John’s. He arched his head and neck back, exposing that long, lovely, white throat of his. Thoughts of the potential disasters awaiting fled John’s mind and he ran the point of his tongue from Sherlock’s collar bone up along his throat to his Adam’s apple and under his chin, then up along his jaw to that particular spot behind his earlobe, where he licked and slurped noisily. Sherlock broke into a shudder and moaned, lifting his shoulder and trapping John’s jaw, twisting his head in an attempt to move away or get closer, John wasn’t sure which.
Sherlock stomped to the table, remembering at the last moment not to slam himself down onto the chair, but he still made his displeasure obvious. John put his plate in front of him and tucked in while Sherlock complained.
Sherlock sucked in air and crawled over the foot of the bed. John followed him. John chuckled and said, “Did you really think I’d let you hide that arse from me? I’m going to have my fill of it.” He gave him a swat on that delectable bottom he’d sworn off for,
(For those of you who might be disappointed, there's no spanking this chapter. But don't worry...)
With a deep breath, John tried to relax his shoulders and rumbled, “Let’s see that it doesn’t. I’m hungry, remember?” He gave him the look Sherlock imagined a bear would give upon being poked.
John curled up around him and when he could speak from the laughing, he tried to soothe him. “Sherlock, calm down. She will be a little ticked but Mrs. Hudson is no blushing bride. I assure you that she knows that we’ve been shagging each other silly for quite some time now. It will be a bit embarrassing, but you’ve lived through far worse and you’ve certainly put me through more humiliation. In public. Besides, underneath the scolding she’ll be dead chuffed to be able to brag about us to Mrs. Turner. I bet her married ones haven’t broken any furniture.”
John answered him, “Well I’m going to watch telly. I recorded an old movie I’ve been wanting to rewatch. It’s been a month already. Come sit, or, uh, lay down, with me. You can predict all the plot points because I’ve already seen it.”
Sherlock gave him a very sly look. “I’ve noticed.”
Sherlock, comprehension dawning, sat up straight in the chair then shifted from one hip to the other, testing the tenderness of his bottom. When he realized he was pain-free, he sprang out of his chair and grabbed John by the hand. Their flight was accompanied by more disapproving scowls. They ran together and burst through the front door of the club, Sherlock with his hand already in the air, calling for a cab. The two of them were vibrating with tension and sat thigh to thigh on the rear seat. Any additional contact would have sent them into an inappropriate frenzy, and beside, the anticipation was a pleasure in itself.
“Morning? Morning? Why are you waking me up in the morning? It’s a lovely way to wake up, no doubt, but today is a free day. We talked about it last night.” His eyes were most definitely open now, but they were glaring down at his wake up call.
Billy didn’t answer, but that wasn’t unexpected. He rarely picked up straightaway. He didn’t bother leaving a message. Billy would recognize his number and in any case, there was only one reason John would be calling him and he would probably ignite the homeless network within minutes. Next was Molly. He knew she would blame herself and he dreaded making the call, but St. Bart’s was a safe place Sherlock might head to if he felt the craving drawing him off course. She picked up on the first ring.
John stopped in the middle of the message and phoned. When Sherlock picked up, he said, “John, you know I prefer to text.”
John clenched his jaw. “I could give you a rubdown when we get home, you know.”
He continued to tease, wanting to get Sherlock to a place where he would be open and undefended, not confident and invulnerable. He knew how Sherlock’s aloof attitude and solitary nature had protected him during the horrible lonely years when he was tormented and bullied as a freak, but there was no need for it now, especially not when he was at risk of sliding back into his reliance on chemical defenses. He needed to let the people who loved him help. He needed to remember how good it was to receive.
“How did you know that?”
He wasted no time leaving the lab. For once it would be nice to talk to someone normal. Even though if it was under the strong circumstance of getting blood for a vampire. But she would never know that. In his short time home he hadn’t made any fast friends and had gone straight to work. Sure he had coworkers he saw on a day to day basis but no one he could say he saw after the day was done.
“I would know if I’ve been into a fancy strip club.”
John took a quick drink of his tea so he wouldn’t choke on the information he had just received. Ensuring death. Sounded like a very vampire thing to say. Hopefully there had to be more to the story than what Sherlock let on. Did Mrs. Hudson, knowing what Sherlock was, have her husband off’d? Maybe she was now living here at Baker Street because she was indebted to him?
"Brixton."
think, don't you?" Clearly tired of playing the cat-and-mouse game Sherlock lifted the tape and let himself through.
He felt around for a promising vein and without hesitation plunged the needle in.
“Well I’m not sure about you, but I’m having dinner. I think I’m going to reheat that curry from the other night.”
John closed his mouth that he didn't realize was agape and could feel the heat in his cheeks. He certainly underestimated what they meant when the Ministry said he just "knew things". Like a window blown open in a storm now he saw why he was a threat and needed dealt with immediately. It was as if he had read his whole life story from one glance.
It was early evening and John tried to be as quiet as he could as he descended the stairs to get down to the café below. However, before he could make it to the first landing the door opened to a middle aged man he had seen only glimpses of. He was a Detective Inspector, the only one from the Yard that ever visited the flat that he knew of.
A man with lacerations on his body, bleeding profusely. He wouldn't stop screaming. He would need a blood transfusion from all the blood loss, surgery to stop the bleeding, but he would survive.
John nodded in understanding.
“Your left hand. Show me.” Sherlock commanded as he held out his own, waiting for John to submit to his request.
"What's new about this one? You wouldn't have come to get me if there wasn't something different."
“More to the point, what’s
John heeded Sherlock’s words. Not only had he rescued him, but he had taken the liberty to clean up afterwards so neither of them would be linked to the crime. A practice, John was sure, he had perfected since his change. Constantly covering his tracks to make sure he was never found.
John thought as he re-zipped it and headed out the flat, catching a bus before it left for its destination.
“Tell me.”
“She would’ve made it out the back door here while the rubbish was being thrown out in the skip. Plenty of places to hide behind cars till staff returned inside. And since the cameras were out no one saw her leave. But why would she go outside where the murderer is? Inside she would have been safe. Reported it to staff…not unless she knew her murderer.” Sherlock talked to himself.
Mike gave him a look and motioned his head towards the door, then it dawned on him. It was their cover story. Small and basic. John nodded and Mike knocked and opened the door. There in the back of the lab was a tall man in a dark suit, pipping a petri dish only giving the briefest of glances to the intruding visitors.
“And she knows you’re..” John trailed off.
“Damn.” Cursed Lestrade.
Sherlock did not bother waiting for permission and crouched by the body to inspect the murderer’s handy work.Whipping out his small magnifying glass he studied the victim’s clothes and wound. But he didn’t stay there long.
“No. Power outage with a storm took down the cameras and none of the staff saw her leave the night she was reported missing. But here’s the thing. A search party was sent out to look for her and didn’t find anything all week. No signs, no nothing. Yet this evening she turns up butchered like she’s been to the slaughter house.”
"Not in a police car. I'll be right behind."
“I must be off as well. The Yard wants me to take a look at a frozen waiter. Make yourself at home and don’t wait up on me. And remember John, under no circumstances should you enter my room. I will know if you have even touched the door.”
“Seeing as a fact that I don’t age it would cause some problems. Must I spell it out for you. I don’t want to draw attention to myself. The public eye would constantly be at my doorstep and now in a time when more advanced media would archive my image I can’t afford to be recognized.”
"Hello?" he asked into the void, knocking lightly on the door.
Sherlock, never breaking his stance, greeted him as if there was absolutely nothing out of the ordinary going on at the moment.
"Oh, we're
“To the morgue. There’s not a moment to lose.” Holmes replied as he shucked off his dressing gown and donned his coat. “Which one can so rarely say of a morgue.”
Sherlock turned to see the newly showered John in his pajamas and house coat. He had been so engrossed in the blood he hadn’t even heard him finish his shower. He turned away from John out of modesty for his current state so not to disgust his flatmate and mumbled out a quick apology.
Mike raised a hand in farewell as Sherlock disappeared out the door leaving a stunned John in his wake. All John could do was turn to Mike in disbelief.
He had interviewed over a hundred people for the extra room, but none of them suited him. Either they were radicals who opposed him, into strange fantasies he had no desire to be apart of, or detested his personality altogether when he confronted them with their life story. The last thing he wanted to was to rely on his brother to help him with the rent just to live in a decent area of London. Even with the discounted price the land lady had quoted him.
“Neither. His name is Wiggins.”
bothers you?” The smallest hints of a smile pulled at the corners of his mouth.
John was slightly confused. How was it the relative of Sherlock’s not know what was going on with him? Every family has their own secrets, that was no shocker, but it wasn’t everyday a family would have a vampire relative just for fun. He figured it would be something that would have to be heavily guarded. But he had assumed that said family would know all there was to know on their unique relative.
John looked up into the eyes of his employer that was hidden behind large circular glasses.
"Which was?"
"Crime scene. Next?"
"What?" John asked confused.
Sherlock returned her greeting and stepped aside to present the shorter stout man beside him.
And while I was away I had a inspirational thought for another Sherlock story that will take place prior to the events of BBC Sherlock. Kind of a alternate first meeting type story with a younger punk Sherlock who meets John while he is still in med school and of course chaos will ensue! I've already written part of the first chapter to that story but I will be working on it more later.
"Yeah ... Asphyxiation, probably. Passed out, choked on her own vomit. Can't smell any alcohol on her. It could have been a seizure; possibly drugs." John threw out there.
“Oh no, I don’t cook. Set too many fires to this damnable place that I have been banned from even touching an oven. Mrs. Hudson cooked your breakfast.” He said as matter of fact as though it was given knowledge.
“It did more than shake me up. It cost a life.”
“You were tired after your shift. Of course you don’t remember.” Sherlock hurried with a response barely making a glance over his shoulder.
“If you want to know what happened, how I was turned into this, then tell me about  Afghanistan. What happened the day that stray bullet marred your shoulder? How you stitched back together your brothers in arms as they screamed in terror against the blasts of cannons in the desert plains,” He tilted his head to the side as if his scrutiny gave him a better angle to read John from across the table. “If my deduction serves me right, from what I have seen of how you hold your shoulder, I would say the bullet shattered the collar bone and severed the subclavian artery. You must have lost quite a bit of blood. You had not one but two surgeries to set it right. Must have left a sizable scar. The end result was that it riddled your health to the point you were discharged and sent home.”
The detective broke his repetitive walk, turning on his heel to give the doctor a confused expression. His hand that had a cigarette nestled between his fingers dropped from his face and he let out a plume of smoke from his lips before he spoke.
“What was the case you were working on. Must have been something if he thought it shook you up a bit.”
John looked across the road to the second camera perched on the corner of a building, which was also pointed towards the phone box at him. And on cue it too swerved away from him towards the other direction.
“Many would say they’re the same thing.”
Sherlock’s demeanor changed again. Despite looking like something out of a horror movie with blood all over him his face held a softer expression. Not out of weariness for his earlier actions, but something akin to compassion.
“Bloody hell that was…amazing. You sure you’re not a spy or something?” John breathed out.
"And what's wrong with the landline?" Mike asked.
In the three months they had been flatmates John had seen his fair share of cases. Though so far, as Sherlock had wanted it, they had all been mild mannered. Anything ranging from murders, burglaries, stake outs and kidnappings. A terrorist attack though? This was definitely going to make news. No matter how low profile Sherlock wanted to keep his identity out of the lime light, John knew he was going to be thrust into this head on. Whether it be a call from Lestrade, Mycroft, or Sherlock’s own curiosity.
The doctor couldn’t help but smile. Holmes could be stern, cold, detached from the realm of emotion when on a case. But Watson knew he was one of the few individuals who ever got to see his true being. One that was full of life, desires, and a enthusiastic giver in the ways of relations in the bedroom. And if one got to know him intimately, they were graced with his over talented melodrama in the art of sentiment.
“Be more careful next time. Others have not been as fortunate as you. If…something had happened…I do not think I could have forgiven myself.”
John gave a confused looked towards the elderly woman and then back to Sherlock. The angular ears had flattened to the sides and his stare was cold and hard.
“The victim here had a history of getting himself involved with the wrong kind of people. Apparently he owes a mob lord some money. And when he failed to make due this is how we found him. He tried calling police which alerted us, but there was no sign of a break in.” The Inspector briefed in the detective.
"I heard you were abroad somewhere getting shot at. At least that's what The Daily Prophet said, what happened?"
“Oh I think you will be regretting those words. Evening.” The window rolled up and the car drove off.
“Right, of course you wouldn’t know. It happens to be a gentlemen’s club. One that I need to get to post haste. So please put your mouth to good use and finish your breakfast because you won't be using it once we get there.”
Now that it was morning it meant Sherlock had to be asleep, stove away somewhere hiding in the darkness. John could move about freely in his new flat. He unlocked his door and carefully made his way down the stairs, trying to be easy on the creaking boards. He reached the bottom of the landing and saw that the door of the sitting room was open. Just like he suspected this level of the flat was quiet with no hints of life bustling about. Suspicions so far proving to be correct.
“I can tell you are thinking too loudly. A moral crisis no doubt. Either you are accepting or refusing? Which is it?” Sherlock interjected again.
John and Sherlock are on a stake out to catch their latest suspect but things turn bad when Sherlock has a protective moment and things get ugly.
John stepped back for a moment after awhile to survey the crowded trauma area. There were so many of them. And more coming. So many, many more. Though in the throes of chaos, just like any solider observing the battlefield, something felt off. And that’s when he saw him. A dark haired well tailored suited man standing outside the lobby beyond the sliding bay doors of the A&E. From what the doctor could tell he had no visible signs of pain or evidence of injury like the people here now. It was hard to make out who exactly he was. Who the hell wears a suit to an A&E?
detective. Only one in the world. I invented the job."
"I don't ...Er, who's this?" her voice becoming flustered.
"Look, what exactly am I supposed to be doing here?"
"Right. Er, d'you know where I could get a cab? It's just, er ... well... my leg."
“Is there anything to which you would like to draw my attention?”
"I think he wants me to take a look." He replied sarcastically, patience running thinner by the second.
"Very well. How long have you been back from the war? I would say no more than a couple of months, is that correct?" Kettle had just boiled now. Tea was being poured and prepped. In a few moments he would meet this mind reading magician. Or maybe he was a serial killer? John shook the thoughts away with effort.
“Who’s this?” Asked Donovan.
"I can give you two minutes." Lestrade warned the detective.
“Someone has to with all the sorts you get to the flat and your strange experiments.” She remarked giving him a sideways glare before returning back to John. “I’m going to the market. Is there anything I can pick up for you?”
“No.”
“What is it? You haven’t spoken since you arrived home. Work has made you flustered. Slight perspiration on your brow line suggests you have some anxiety weighing on your mind and equally exhausted judging by your gait as you came in. But knowing you, you thrive in the action, so it can’t be the A&E….oh!” Sherlock’s eyes lit up in realization.
John could’ve swore at himself as he felt the dusting of a blush heat up on his cheeks. It was the way he had said it.
John's eyes widened at his words.
“Presumably on his way to the morgue to identify her remains.” Holmes was still trying to follow along where the Inspector was going with his story.
A small voice came from behind him and John head whipped around to meet the sudden intruder: a petite woman. Her lab coat draped her small frame practically swallowing her whole making her look much smaller and younger than what she seemed. It didn’t really help matters none when John took note of her odd mismatched outfit that looked more like something a teenager would wear at university. Even her hair was swept up in a ponytail with a scrunchy that could easily date back to the 80’s or 90’s. John tried to read her name tag but it was covered by the lapels of her coat. The only words he could make out was that she was a pathologist assistant.
“Alright, children,” John interceded. “No, I live here. Mind you he had a bit of a dickhead way of asking for a flat mate but in all honesty he was just there helping me out. Being discharged from the army has been a rough change for me. Rougher still given my newer circumstances but...all in all I am grateful.”
, depending on the time of day either side of the desk could be
“Let’s not dwell on darker thoughts shall we? It will give us both a peace of mind.” With that Sherlock turned on his heel and made his way down the stairs.
It didn’t take long for John to arouse himself. After all Sherlock did very little harm in order to bring him to the small flat in which he resided. The steel eyes of the doctor drew from the depths of their clouded slumber as they took in the new surroundings he was in. No longer was he fighting the chill, but now was enveloped in warmth from the heat of a fireplace from the far end of the room. Looking around he realized he wasn’t even in his own home but another’s. Two chairs were nestled in front of the hearth, behind them bookcases filled with volumes of various subjects from floor to ceiling, and by the window a large desk littered with papers and manila folders.
"Suitcase, yes. She's been married at least ten years, but not happily. She's had a string of lovers but none of them knew she was married."
The detective was just about to peg this, once interesting case, for a dud. Though, there in the musty confines of the morgue he was now not so sure. An uneasiness was settling in the pits of his stomach, making it turn over. It was when he had these feelings he knew that he was out of his league. He dared not admit it openly. And here he had thought he had the answer, waiting to spring forth from the crevices of his mind. A painting of marital discontentment gone array to the point of a ghostly accomplice concluding in murder-suicide. Something was making him second guess his reasonings. As though he wasn’t asking the right questions and had to go back to square one.
"Ah, yes. Recently got back. You must be Mrs. Hudson. And thank you for letting come and see about it."
“No. At this rate hell will freeze over.” Sherlock returned back to his rigorous pacing.
If it was one thing he couldn’t stand, it was how the Yard liked to over exaggerate things, especially when it came to dissolving facts from fiction. And irritating him even more when they disclosed such preposterous stories to the paper for them to dress it up in scandal and gossip. He couldn’t help but let out a sigh of frustration.
With caution he put his hand in the vampire’s. The shock of contact between warm and cold was instantaneous. Sherlock carefully turned the doctor’s hand this way and that way in keen interest as if he was looking for something.
John rigidly nodded.
“Good.”
“You’re speaking like a child.” said Watson.
the British government after all.
John viewed back on what Sherlock had said. The case leading up to his change had cost a life. If he could bet any amount of money he would change his theory and say that it wasn’t Sherlock’s own life, but another’s. One that was close to him. One he couldn’t save. One he would kill for to avenge their death. The question now was, who?
"How can you
“She takes her acting role very seriously.” Sherlock piped in not bothering to look at either one of them.
"I know John, but just give this a try. Its the Obiliviator's Headquarters. They investigate muggles who may or may not be getting to close to the magical world when they shouldn't be there. Some field agents can spend years in one area. Observing, reporting, all the while correcting the error the Ministry sees as a potential breach. Obliviate and move on to the next case."
“Afghanistan.” A ghostly voice brewed from the farthest reaches of Sherlock’s mind. Or was it the howl of the wind that was making him hear things? But why? Why indeed. Now his mind was curious.
John took a seat in the red armchair, hooking his cane to one of the arms.
"How are you doing this?" John breathed out. He could barely hear shakiness in his own voice.
“Glad to see you still have a sense of humor left after your diagnosis. And I am quite glad nothing has changed for me since my demise.”
“It’s been interesting to say the least.”
"Yeah, he just took off. He does that."
Sherlock took another peek to the streets down below and his features upturned into a scowl.
John’s brows furrowed in confusion at the vague message. Carefully opening up the drawer of the table laid his gun. Relief flooded him as he picked it up and finding it loaded, ready and armed. It surprised him in some ways to find it just how it was and not loaded so Sherlock would have the upper hand. But as the vampire had said, even he had morals and even he would think someone an idiot if they did not think of their well being first while with him. He had to have taken his gun for something more than the excuse of John’s safety. Perhaps his own. Was there something about John’s gun that could possibly harm Sherlock or even the bullets? Bullets contain no silver, so that was out of his theory. Whatever the matter was he left it with John, armed, and even let him know its location. That in itself gave John enough motion to hide it under his pillow just for good measure.
John wasted no time. He grabbed up the scraps of his lunch, binned them in a nearby trash can, and made a mad dash towards the A&E. His body sensed the habitual muscle memory of such a response and, like second nature, kicked into what it was supposed to do. It remembered the drop of a hat moments in the desert when the injured was flown in and work began immediately on arrival. There was no time to be hesitant or anxious. The adrenaline was too busy pumping through the bloodstream to allow such feelings.
**Les eaux de la fontaine de jouvence — The waters of the fountain of youth**
"We can't just wait!"
"Hopefully this will be easy. Just watch, Obliviate, and redirect him. Simple enough. At least I hope."
They both laughed.
The tall man took a seat at the table and then decided to make his presence known.
“Christ,” Greg breathed out as he reached for Sherlock’s hat and handed it over to him. “May want to get out of here while you still can.”
The bottled up rage finally burst out of him and onto the innocent woman who turned back to look at him from the door, making her jump. As soon as it came out he instantly regretted it and back pedaled fast.
“What about…doing it the old fashioned way?”
John turned and rested back on the counter, arms crossed.
Lestrade and John followed him out the door watching the detective fly down the stairs in his rapid descent.
“No! No. I mean yes.” Sherlock’s words stumbled again. “What I mean to say is that it was something not socially acceptable, but I was not…put off. It was…”
“Yesterday morning.”
No sooner than the Inspector had arrived he was off in a dash, hurrying back down the stairs. John had watched the interaction in a new light. From the new information he had just shared to the detective and asking for help it seemed that the Inspector was heavily relying on his input if he wanted him to come so desperately. So what kind of detective was he? Private eye? Or was he just some new recruit that had just started on the force? He seemed rather young though. No way the police were relying on some kid fresh cut out of university.
“Oh, see you found it.”
"Well, you're the second person to say that to me today."
“Perfect. There’s no time to waste. The game is on.”
John nodded. Nightmares of years past had been haunting him of late. Anything from his time as a school boy to recent events had increasing been plaguing his mind. Perhaps it was time for a change of scenery. He knew his time as an Auror was over. His last case had been a terrible one and he had gotten injured in the field. They had got their person, but it came at his sacrifice.
"Cup of tea'd be lovely, thank you." He grabbed at the newspaper that was on the arm of the chair the elderly woman had put down, flipping it open.
"Yes; and I can read your military career in your face and your leg, and your brother's drinking habits in your mobile phone." He defended.
The doctor knew every man had needs. It was one of the very first things he learned in medical school. In the way of the hierarchy of things, love and belonging, was a category all on its own according to Maslow. It consisted of friendship, family and most of all intimacy. John had never been entirely sure of the detective’s sexuality and never gave it much thought. From what he knew Sherlock never talked about any past lovers. He had never mentioned a woman’s name from his past life. Or was he even interested in women? John remembered him saying he wasn’t ‘put off’ when he had kissed him the first time they had met.
With that Mr. Weasley left and John noticed how he too had a limp. Perhaps Mr. Weasley was right. Perhaps it was possible to be normal again.

! Houston, we
This time his stone like legs finally gave way and began to function again. He made a sprint for the staircase and didn’t bother looking back. All he knew was that he had to get away from Sherlock. Far as possible.
John said slowly.
“Alright?” John asked casually.
“Because it’s never twins.”
"When I met you for the first time yesterday, I said, 'Afghanistan or Iraq?' You looked surprised." Sherlock began his onslaught by peaking John's interest.
“Right.”
If that wasn't already putting the nail in the coffin it certainly cracked John's cool.
"There wasn't a case."
A baritone voice answered from down the hallway to his left behind closed doors.
“Older than you, obviously.” He clipped and returned his attention back to the newspaper.
Mike just grinned.
“Where did you get this blood?” Sherlock blurted out.
He remembered all too well being called out the same way when he first found out he was a wizard. That was when he had his first encounter of accidental magic. He made the neighbor's prick ass of a son grow excessively long hair all over his body and the boy had to be taken care of by the Ministry of Magic. Though, the boy never messed with John again and whenever he saw him he ran for his life. The men made their way up to the building I was greeted by a rat faced man in a plastic suit who was also not happy to see them. Adversary number two.
“Death wants you to be terrified, but the scariest thing is wanting death. They made her suffer before she met her end.”
Toodles!
The detective’s face scrunched in confusion and gave the coroner a pointed look.
"What's happened?" Harry asked curiously.
"So far, so obvious."
Down flights of stairs, into the depths of his deepest basement, one door led to out to the strange unknown. He opened it and was met with the salty breeze of the ocean shore. This gray landscape held no color of life, its sky was devoid of emotion, and waters as dark as midnight. He remembered visiting this beach in a distant memory under different circumstances making plans for the future that never came to be.
“More?” He asked in confusion. Surely not. There was no way. But then again he didn’t exactly see what happened with his patients as he discharged them from the A&E to be admitted to another floor to the hospital or scheduled for surgery. His job was to take care of the patient at time of need, not for the long haul.
Perhaps that is why it took Sherlock by surprise when he sensed none on the man he had just swept off the street. He had been stalking him silently since the first day he had laid eyes upon the unsuspecting doctor just two weeks prior. Little did Sherlock know that fateful night would change his life forever. When he first caught eye of the doctor Sherlock had been leaving the morgue late one bitter frigid May night. At first the man looked like any other doctor leaving St. Bart’s Hospital. The doctor’s face was sullen and marked evidence of a long and weary shift. He was young, no more than mid-thirties and looked as if he carried the weight of the world upon his shoulders.  His hair shown in a bright golden hue under the street lights that revealed secrets of silver hiding underneath. He tugged his coat tighter around him as the brisk wind of the unusual cold spring plowed through the city. It was enough to show the hidden tan line that was beginning to fade that went no higher than his wrist.
“She was positively identified by her own husband seconds before he died. He had no reason to lie. He could hardly be mistaken.” The coroner pressed.
“Seen a lot of injuries then? Violent deaths? Bit of trouble too I bet?”
“Oh. Oh ok. Well…that’s good.”
Sherlock’s eyes sharply lifted to John and as if by physical force became darker.
Him? Concerned about his health? The thought of a vampire concerned about his health made him somewhat perturbed. John had figured the only reason Sherlock would only care about his well being was that he essentially was playing the part as his blood mule.
problem?” Holmes turned to Lestrade, changing the subject entirely. The Inspector who had been bewitched by the presence of the corpse, lifted his eyes to face the onslaught of the detective.
