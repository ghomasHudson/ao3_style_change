John took Sherlock’s hand and answered firmly. “Yes, no doubt about it. Lets stop wasting time here on the pavement. I want to marry this man before he changes his mind.” He turned toward the doors and hauled Sherlock along by the hand, trusting that Mycroft would escort Mrs. Hudson.
"I guess it does not matter if he goes back to his normal everyday life tomorrow, I just don’t know exactly what is the best course of action for now - he obviously needs to rest but I agree with you that he should not be alone. Is there anyone who could take care of him a bit when he returns to his room? "
Because Sherlock had always had the habit of fake-smiling often, most people don’t notice. But John does.
The subject of the novice lesson could not have been more appropriate - Father Andrew spoke of mercy and forgiveness and was not tired of reaffirming that they should be an indispensable part of charity to each one of us if we were angry with someone.
He shook the hand still brutally grasping Sherlock’s nape, causing Sherlock’s head to snap backward.
"By the way, you’ll find a phone in the office," Jonah whispered to me with a wink, "If you want to talk with Harriet."
Quickly I went to the end of the room to see what it was all about - and was frightened. In front of me was Brother Jonah, next to him a broken bottle, the blond hair at the back of his head bloodstained.
Now Sherlock was back, popping “not dead!” on him and babbling about some secret website John was supposed to have known about. His fist clenched at the thought.
I waited until the ringing of the bell, then I went to the noon prayer in the church. The process did not differ from the other days until Prior Lambert rose after the closing prayer and addressed the brothers present. He explained briefly and unceremoniously that Brother William had been hospitalized in the morning with severe medical conditions and would now be treated there. A low murmur went through the rows; only Jonah sat in his seat, stony-faced, staring at the floor. The Prior cleared his throat to make himself heard again.
I glanced at the heart monitor, but the readings showed no change. He probably did not notice me at all - and that was what scared me the most. During my professional career I had often found that the answer to the anxious question of whether the life of a coma patient continued or not was within a few days or weeks: either the patient woke up again - or the brain died. Again I let my eyes slip over the body of the young monk. Which group would he belong to?
"It does not have to mean anything," I tried to calm the young man and put a hand on his shoulder, "Maybe this is just a misunderstanding ..."
"Because there is a priest with Brother William supposedly with him to give him the sacraments. And after my meeting with Mycroft Holmes, I can not imagine that it was Brother Williams' family that summoned this priest, so I'm worried that ... "
John heard Mycroft sigh again. “Very well,” he said then the line went silent, leaving John staring blankly at his silent phone.
Father Andrew, who had come in late, but as a novice master knew the brothers entrusted to him better than many others, shook his head with conviction.
"You're the one who brought me into this situation!" I complained to him in a hoarse voice, knowing how unjust and defiant my accusations sounded.
John was grateful when a clerk approached him while he browsed the Reds and Blended Reds aisle. He explained that he was looking for a special bottle, but not too outrageous, to pair with salmon. When the clerk suggested an £80 Pinot Noir, John winced at the extravagance - especially in light of his recent months of only drawing half salary - but he braced himself and dug out his debit card. Sherlock was the one who knew wines, not him, but the clerk assured him that the wine would please even the most discriminating palate.
“Good god, John. Did you not actually spend days reading my letters or are you too dull to pick up on what I so obviously stated?
A murmur went through the crowd until one of the men plucked up courage and asked the question that seemed to burn in their souls, "Brother William was ... poisoned?"
“I haven’t started reading yet. I listened … listened to the conversation. From the rooftop. I listened to it and I have to talk to him.”
It felt strange to me that the monks' lives went on as they had before the treacherous attack on Sherlock, the false accusations against Jonah, and the unmasking of the murderous novice Francis; no one seemed willing to discuss it. Francis’ disappearance was apparently simply accepted and not further remarked on, although I was sure that everyone in the monastery knew exactly what had happened.
Sherlock took a moment to scan the room before he moved. The furniture was of high quality and the Oriental rug that covered the white tile floor looked hand-knotted. With a jerk to the top pull, Sherlock found a drawer full of elastic and drawstring waist athletic shorts, t-shirts and white athletic socks. The second drawer contained more of the same, plus sweat pants and fleece hoodies - everything he could need except pants. With a shrug at that omission, Sherlock picked out a navy blue t-shirt and navy shorts with white stripes running down the outer seam of both legs. He carried them into the bathroom, then stripped and stepped into the shower.
Father Lambert led me up through countless corridors, stairways and down again until I was confused and convinced I’d never be able to find the way back to my room alone.

Sherlock moaned his agreement, working his fingers to the second knuckle. The sight was almost too much for John - he grabbed the base of his overwrought cock and squeezed
“Yes, Sherlock, I did record the conversation and can send you the file. I’ll also send over a transcript of the conversation. But why would John believe it’s genuine? Might he just believe I had the conversation faked?” Mycroft sounded weary.
"Today at noon, in the church. He prayed and then asked Father Christopher to hear his confession. Maybe he could help you ... "
"Everyone should bring in the talents given to him by the Lord, for the benefit of the community, and both medicinal herbs and honey are often of great use to us all. And as I said, if you would like to help Brother William occasionally, he would not mind. "
A little sound escaped John’s throat, startling him in the silent house. Sherlock had written this just two weeks ago. To him. Thinking he was sitting in his chair at Baker Street, praying for his lover’s safe return.
This knowledge, I was sure, would never meet the high demands he had placed on himself and his work, if I could take the words of his fellow brothers for granted - and why would they lie to me? I could not escape the aura of perfection that seemed to surround him. How, then, would what I was doing ever be enough to ignite that tiny spark of recognition in his eyes once again, that he had showed to me yesterday afternoon? I had read the book until I had not been able to keep my eyes open any longer ... To my astonishment, he now gave me a benevolent look and led me immediately, as soon as I had put on the protective clothing, into his work.
"Yeah, obviously," I snorted bitterly. I had not wanted to talk about the subject, but now it took possession of me and I felt rancor rise in my throat.
I nodded in agreement. An easy life was really rare. But people like Brother Jonah made it more bearable.
"Yes, very much!" I replied, and was amazed to realize it was absolutely true. This almost meditative calm that had prevailed during the common prayer had touched me unexpectedly deep. It felt like when you finally got home after a long journey. Still very inspired by these unfamiliar impressions, I followed the blond to the refectory and to the novice’s table, where I greeted Brother Francis with a friendly nod and took the seat to his right. After a brief look around the room I remained standing like all others until grace was spoken and the brothers took their seats.
Only half-heartedly did I go to the refectory after supper, and chewed cheerlessly on a slice of bread; I felt no hunger, and the idea of the imminent conversation made my throat dry. My unusual behavior must have aroused attention because Brother Elijah took me aside.
The file lay on the table, innocuous manila cardstock somehow threatening him by its mere presence. John downed half his pint then plucked up the courage to open it. A tiny flash drive was taped to the inside of the folder. The top dozen pages of paper were stapled together precisely. A note in the top margin of the first page in Sherlock’s neat handwriting read:
"No, you didn’t," I answered softly, because at the moment I simply lacked the strength to focus on the appropriate signs.
went through my head. As he stood there in his black habit with the hood thrown back, the slender, pale fingers clasped over the waist, looking at me with his pale blue eyes …
“Damn the cases.” John said, and Sherlock gave a mock gasp. “The more remote the better. I’d have you all to myself if I could.”
“Just exactly that.” John chuckles. Sherlock is grateful that he doesn’t make to come back into Sherlock’s field of vision. In fact, he’s fairly certain John has his back to him as well. What an odd way to carry on a conversation. Also how brilliant. This way, Sherlock can’t get overwhelmed and ruin things. “I’ll stay,” he says, “But only if you want me to.”
The third thing he notices is John, sat in a chair across from him. The odd sensation of having found yourself sitting when you had no memory of stopping standing, pales in comparison to Sherlock’s mounting mortification.
“That was days ago, sir.” Wiggins replies, trying to hand Sherlock a syringe. Sherlock scoffs and waves him off. “Sorry, sir. Forgot you don’t share.”
standards, Wiggins. Do try to remember that.” Sherlock looks about the dingy flat with his eyes for the charger he’d brought, but there’s no hope of finding it in this mess.
“You sent me the address, Love.” He’s trying to get Sherlock to sit up, hands urging his body to move.
Sherlock spares a glance at the man, sees he’s still in his rain soaked coat and scarf. Then looks back out the open window.
Fingers card through Sherlock’s curls at the back of his head as he snorts the line, and then, with a fist of Sherlock’s hair, he wrenches Sherlock’s head back violently. The feeling of cocaine being absorbed into his system and the sharp pull have Sherlock making a wretched sound as he falls to his knees, hair still firm in Seb’s fist.
“When I get better--” Sherlock tries but his throat convulsively swallows, effectively cutting him off.
“What are we what? Doing? I thought you wanted to… ‘talk’. Or whatever.” He looks back down into his whiskey, concern creasing his brow, mouth twisted up to the side by his obvious discomfort with the situation.
Sherlock scoffs, looking away, though feels a blush color him at John mentioning his arse in any context.
“Perfectly,” Sherlock’s voice squeaks and he has to clear his throat, “Perfectly, perfectly.” He coughs and looks at anywhere but John, before narrowing his eyes in defiance at his own embarrassment and giving John an almost-glare. “Why wouldn’t it be?”
“Sorry, sir.” Wiggins jerks himself awake and sits up ramrod straight, forcing his eyes to stay open.
Sherlock always seemed to get like this when John told him he loved him. Even though he’d been saying it multiple times a day for these past four months, as if his lips couldn’t say it enough. Ever since that first day... the one where there had been too close a call on Sherlock’s part, a bullet speeding past, taking a chunk out of his Belstaff, but luckily leaving Sherlock with nothing but a graze. John had decided he couldn’t contain it anymore. Couldn’t risk Sherlock never getting the chance to hear John say those words. And so he’d just said them. Right there and then, while Sherlock sat grumbling on the back bumper of the ambulance. They hadn’t been alone, but John had said it anyways. In front of the EMT. In front of Greg. Hell, even Sally Donovan and Anderson were there. Sherlock had given him this almost quizzical look, and then smiled in a way John hadn’t before seen. And so John decided he’d just keep on saying it.
“Oh... “ Sherlock looked down at a traumatized child as she watched Father Christmas swear up a storm and ruin her childhood forever. “Hello.” he said awkwardly.
“Don’t worry,” Sherlock said, turning back to the children and their concerned parents. “That’s not really Santa.” Sherlock shammed a reassuring smile. The parents looked relieved. So did the kids.
They kissed in front of the open window, snow drifting down outside in soft tufts, while the pink glow of the streetlamps outlined their joined frames. John forgot how cold he was. All he could feel was the warmth of Sherlock’s lips, and the warmth radiating and pulsing out from his heart.
“Move!” Sherlock yelled, pushing the mouth-breathing pedestrians out of the way. “John! He’s heading towards the mall!”
“I thought we had already discussed this.” From the change in John’s voice, Sherlock can tell he’s turned his head around to look at the back of Sherlock’s. “It doesn’t just have to be what you need. It can be what you want too.”
“I’m fine,” Sherlock tries to protest, but Seb’s grip only tightens, probably painfully so, but Sherlock is too doped up to really tell.
Sherlock takes a deep breath, can smell John, the scent concentrated at his pulsepoint. Can smell his own sweat coating John’s palm.
Sherlock sighs dramatically and takes the straw, bending down to hover over the mirror and choose which line to take, which line is the smallest. Sherlock’s entire head had gone numb and every time he swallowed he felt as if he were going to choke. He didn’t want more, but he did want to please Sebastian.
John wore the hat when they went in to pick up their food. He then texted Mrs.H to be ready, and slipped the hat back onto Sherlock’s head right before they entered 221. She snapped a picture of him before Sherlock even had time to react.
If it came right down to it, and one was forced to decide, Sherlock preferred men vastly over women. In fact, he preferred men entirely.
John laughs up at the ceiling, rubbing both hands over his face. “Oh, god.” he breathes in humour and agitation. And perhaps also fear. He looks back at Sherlock, a defiant smile struggling to stay on his lips.
"He doesn’t live here anymore," the blond man replied, without answering my question. He took a drag of his cigarette, already burned down to a small stump, then tipped his head back and blew the smoke into the air.
Mary rose to follow more slowly, giving Sherlock a warm look of sympathy. She grabbed a few paper napkins from the dispenser on the table and handed them to Sherlock. “Don’t worry, I’ll talk him around,” she said sweetly.
"I am sorry that I have caused you grief. It was stupid and I promise you that something like that will not happen again." He put down the cup, folded his hands in his lap and lowered his head humbly. "Please forgive me."
"Oh, all of a sudden? After all, you were the one who sneaked into my room in the middle of the night because I aroused your interest! Has it not been you who held my hand while cleaning the dishes? And let me lick honey from your finger? "
During breakfast, I never was so happy about the omnipresent silence as I was at that moment, because as soon as my eyes fell on Brother William, who barely touched the food on his plate and seemed to almost exclusively partake of tea today, I felt both hot and cold. In the next hour I would have a hard time dodging him, because along with Brother Jonah, we were on kitchen duty once again. I almost wished that the Order would have invested a small amount of its funds in the purchase of a dishwasher. However, since this was not the case, I found myself standing between the two young men in the kitchen again, after we had cleared the tables together. The tasks were clearly divided - William rinsed, I dried and Jonah put the dishes away in the cabinets.
Tracing small circles on Sherlock’s hip bones with his thumbs, John toyed with the low-slung waistband of Sherlock’s tight black boxer trunks. Sherlock leaned lower, his cotton-clad erection brushing John’s as he rolled his hips, his cock stroking John’s from root to tip, his bollocks pressing softly against John’s.
I scratched my head in embarrassment, hoping that my explanation would convince the officer that I was not planning a break-in, but had far more honorable motives.
John double checked the date. What had he been doing then? Nothing stood out in his memory. Just an ordinary day. He’d probably woken early, cycled to work. Met patients, written prescriptions, referred some to specialists. Cycled home, had dinner with Mary, perhaps followed by sex. Just an ordinary day in his small, petty life. He’d been sleepwalking while Sherlock was taking down nearly two dozen dangerous international criminals single handed
"You don’t have to. For now, it would be enough for me if you helped me take my things back to my room. I feel so isolated here, I want to have other people around me again. "
"Jonah, would you at least agree to let me do some neurological examinations in the next few days? If any abnormalities arise, you can still go to hospital treatment. "
He seemed pleased, for he did not respond to my excuse, except for the fact that he was giving me a pat on the back. I sat down into the lounge and studied the daily newspaper in order to be left alone. I retreated to my room immediately after the end of the free time and the following Complet. Since everyone believed that I was tired and wanted to go to bed, at least nobody would disturb me.
John felt the pieces of himself start to slide apart but Sherlock tightened his grip, his strong arm holding the bits of John together while he gasped and sobbed and tried to find the edges of himself. Sherlock didn’t go in for platitudes or empty comfort words - but the weight of his arm, the rhythm of his steady breathing grounded John and kept his pieces from breaking too far apart. Sherlock pressed his lips against John’s temple and breathed, keeping a steady rhythm for John while John fought to breathe at all. Finally John’s  hysterical laughter faded to irregular hiccoughs then after a final sigh, they lay in silence for a while.
“Mycroft, why the bloody hell didn’t you tell me John didn’t get my messages!” Sherlock stormed at his brother.
John took a booth in the back, ordered a pint and stared at the closed file. “My explanation, my apology” echoed in his memory, causing him to wearily rub the heels of both hands into his eyes. He took a long pull from his glass to chase the memory away.
They both laughed while John retrieved bandages, antibiotic cream, medical tape and nitrile gloves from the large stach on the counter top. He lifted the towel away from Sherlock’s shoulders and was relieved to find it free of blood stains.  John snapped on gloves and went to work, gently spreading cream over the wounds with a square of gauze. “Looks good. You’ll have scarring but all of these wounds are healing nicely.” Affecting his doctor-mode helped John distance himself from the fact that he was cleaning wounds Sherlock had suffered while being tortured in an Eastern European dungeon. If he let himself think about it, John would fall apart. Instead he kept his mind on the task of cutting strips of bandage and taping them in place. Sherlock stayed silent. An occasional flinch was his only response to John’s ministrations.
I knew the words I needed to tell him in many different languages, but I had never said them so seriously before - so serious that they almost seemed too naïve and cheesy. The words expressed exactly what my heart and soul screamed when I thought of him. The sign was simple and understood by most people, even people who didn’t know sign language, but for me it meant
Immediately we left the refectory and went on the seemingly endless way through the labyrinthine passages again until the Prior stood in front of high double doors that looked as if they would creak at the lightest touch. I was surprised when they opened without the slightest resistance.
it. And why do you think that I'd talk to Prior Lambert, breaking my vow of silence doing that, just to learn something about you? "
"Yes," I replied simply, "And that's why I find it so hard to believe that he would be able to intentionally hurt another person. He must have said something about the allegations against him ... "
In the course of the morning, I decided to visit Brother Jonah and was glad to find him in bed. This time he was awake, leaning against his pillow upright, holding a sketchbook in his hands. When he heard the door creaking, he looked up and smiled at me.
? Why was John preparing to present some strange woman a ring? He knew Sherlock’s return was imminent. What was he doing out with a woman at all – why wasn’t he at Baker Street waiting for Sherlock?
"I don’t expect a monk to understand such things," I shot a toxic look in his direction, suddenly angry that he seemed to judge my feelings.
John watched Sherlock trail his slickened fingers up his thigh then further, rubbing three fingers along his perineum, trailing back until they met his cleft. John sucked in a breath between his teeth - they’d never done this, hadn’t even discussed it. John had had sexual encounters with men before Sherlock, but only using hands and mouths. He’d never even considered actual intercourse and had assumed Sherlock felt the same.
However, Sherlock put an end to my musing in a way I would later recognize as typical of him: He walked over to his bedside table, took out a packet of condoms and a tube of lube and shoved both into my hand before he glanced down at the broad bed then looked at me over his shoulder:
John had known he was being a jackass to Sherlock the past few months but just couldn’t seem to stop himself. The smothering isolation of being shut up in the flat while he recuperated from a devastating shoulder injury with just the twice weekly visits from the physiotherapist, Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson for company had narrowed his world to two points of focus - the unremitting pain in his shoulder and his lost playing career. Neither of those were Sherlock’s fault but it was easy for John to take out his anguish and frustration on his husband: Sherlock, who had been surprisingly supportive throughout the surgeries, the hospital stay, and the tedious recovery. Sherlock, who he’d continually pushed away until finally Sherlock had even stopped trying to engage him.
Sherlock grinned wickedly. “It’s my first time here.” He raised an eyebrow rakishly, flirting too-obviously.
- it shot through my head, but before I could think about it, a loud hiss, followed by a moan, pulled my gaze to his leg. He’d demolished the bandage and thus revealed the still slightly bleeding wound.
Again, I received no reply. Instead, he seemed to have regained his composure and continued to dedicate himself to his work in an almost meditative manner, raising his hand from time to time when I tried to approach, which, I told myself, was more likely due to the fact that I did not wear any protective clothing than to the fact that he did not want to talk to me or to have me near him.
"Beyond repair? This can not be determined at the moment. We'll have to wait and see if his vocal cords recover, but I do not want to give you false hope - his doctors think it would be a miracle if he would recover from his injuries without any sequelae. But miracles handled by your current hosts and I personally will leave the miracles to them. "
Opening the site, John read over Sherlock’s last message. He exhaled sharply, thinking of the lash scars on Sherlock’s back that resulted from his capture by Moriarty's Serbian people. Sherlock had told him in the message about his injuries. How confused Sherlock must have been when John launched himself at him, knocking him to the ground on his injured back with all his weight. John swallowed the gorge that threatened to rise at the thought.
"I want to go see Sherlock Holmes," I pleaded, reaching for the pen to sign the Visitor Log. The duty nurse put a hand on my forearm to keep me from doing so.
Sherlock made a dismissive gesture. “I knew you’d want to do the honorable thing. Dull. Surely she’ll have figured it out by now.”
form of endearment, because they had unshakable respect for each other. The joy in each other’s company, even if all they did of an evening was sit in front of the fireplace and read silently. Relating – really
It couldn’t be true. All the suffering, all the pain, moving out of Baker Street, avoiding Mrs. Hudson because it was too painful to see her sweet, sad face … falling in with Mary, the affectionate relationship based mainly on sex and Mary’s bright smile and not much else… all of it, the huge
to run back to Baker Street, tear open the door, throw him on the sofa and snog him silly. It hurt so badly to see Sherlock in the flesh, even more incandescent and magnetic than his memories of the man.
The door opened and the friars, led by Prior Lambert, entered the church. To my astonishment, I realized that Brother William was the last to take his place in the choir loft, but settled on the edge, while all the other men went to their usual places. I decided not to let myself be irritated; my interest in the young man had brought too much trouble to both him and myself. Nevertheless, it was noticeable that he would only passively participate in the service. It was only recently that I had discovered that there was also a plan for the liturgical ministry, which assigned certain tasks to each brother, such as the recitation of psalms or the service on the altar, and which was valid for one week. Brother William should have assisted the priest who led the Eucharistic celebration this week, as he had done on the preceding days - but now he stayed in his place, gazing into space, and seemed to hardly notice his surroundings. Was it worry about his protege Jonah, or was there something else?
But now - now. Now Sherlock is angles and planes and firm and hard, arms and legs fuzzed with wiry hair, jaw rough with five o'clock stubble, fingers bony, limbs ropy. And it’s glorious, the brand-new sensations under his palms, against his limbs, his belly. Deep-voiced sighs to match his own. Large hands on him, large mouth around him - god, everything about Sherlock is so big.
“I followed you this morning because Mycroft shared with me that he has information on Mary. Nothing solid, just hints and rumors of very dark things. I thought it best to monitor your interaction with her.” Sherlock held John’s gaze. One corner of his mouth crooked up.  “Good thing, isn’t it?”
As much as I tried, I could not combine these two pictures in my mind. It was not the famous two sides of a coin that the curly head revealed to me.  I had the feeling of having met two completely different people: a serious, profound man whose spirituality was more important to him than all other things and who apparently had gained great respect within the convent within a very short time - and someone who was quite a scoundrel, with his inner child on display, and testing his limits by pushing his fellow men to their own. Or past, as in my case. I had fallen hopelessly for him - and at the same time I was absolutely certain that he could not have missed that.
Heaving a sigh, Sherlock sat forward. “Give me a chance. You can call my brother, he’ll verify my identity.”
“John’s home. We can’t be disturbed.” Sherlock grabbed John’s wrist and pulled him up the stairs. “If a client comes, tell them to go away,” he threw over his shoulder.
And she looked good. Very different from the last time John had seen her. Along with clear eyes and steady hands, Harry sported a smart jacket and nicely tailored skirt in soft grey and a beautiful yellow cashmere scarf that flattered her golden brown hair and deep blue eyes.
Sherlock looked toward the ceiling for a few moments, a bashful expression lighting his features. “I painted the downstairs powder room for my mother this morning. Obviously some paint dripped onto my hair.”
Sherlock brought it up just after John lit the logs in the fireplace and settled into his armchair with a book. “What do you think about getting married again?” Sherlock’s voice was neutral and partially muffled by the sofa arm he’d draped himself over.
I stopped and felt my whole body stiffen. Just the mention of the sweet fluid brought the memory of Sherlock back to life; my heart squeezed painfully. If only I had never come to this cursed market!
I cleared my throat as I stood before his table, but this did not help much; still my voice sounded hoarse and rough as if after a long cold.
But what does that mean? Was he simply relieved that my brain devoted itself to other things than planning a murder attack on his confreres, or …
The past two days had showed John that Sherlock’s feelings wore more complex than he’d ever imagined. The days had also forced John to think deeply about his own feelings. He felt clear-headed for the first time in two years. He realized now that he had not been fair to Mary – had never been, since the day they’d met. Mary had pursued him with clear intent and he’d just gone along because it was easy and accessible. He didn’t have strong feelings for her. He’d talked himself into feeling love, but it was a pale ghost of what he felt for Sherlock – and he’d known it at the time, but refused to admit it to himself.
He could not look me in the eye. Instead, he changed his sitting position, stretched out his legs and pushed the hem of his habit upwards. A broad strip of adhesive plaster appeared to cover the injury on his leg - though I had repeatedly offered to treat his wound, he had repeatedly put me off to 'later', almost as if he wanted to delay it as long as possible. Now, however, he began plucking at one corner of the bandage, but was unable to grasp it with his strikingly short fingernails.
"Alright, I realize that I'm putting you in a difficult situation. That was not my intention, please forgive me. "
I hesitantly walked up and down the hall thinking about my conversation with him. Could it really be that he had pushed Brother Francis and caused his fall through the glass? It just did not fit in with the image of the peaceful young monk who grew so much in his faith that nothing else counted for him. I couldn’t imagine him committing such an act of violence. On the other hand, that also applied to all other friars. But it was clear that someone had poisoned the chocolates that William had eaten with a strong neurotoxin and there was a high likelihood that this person was living here in the monastery.
The last part of John’s rational mind still functioning cautioned him to slow down but the animal inside shoved the concern aside. Grasping Sherlock’s nape, John forced Sherlock’s chest and shoulders to the mattress, making his long back arch. Sherlock submitted without resistance, turning his head to the side and to watch John over his shoulder. The cheek presented for John’s gaze was flushed, sweat-slick curls clinging to forehead, mouth slack while John’s brutal thrusts elicited an endless stream of involuntary sounds from the arched white throat. Thrusting brutally, John ground out between clenched teeth, “Feel
Sherlock heard a voice a short distance away but couldn’t make out the words. He was hauled along, stumbling and cursing, across the paved lot, through a door, through a carpeted room, another doorway and finally into a large air conditioned office. A large man, square head and no-neck, sat sweating behind the desk in a polyester blazer and white dress shirt, tie loosened and top button unbuttoned. Sherlock’s eyes widened when he recognized the man from the nightclub, the middle aged owner who’d held court at the bar the night before.
"You don’t have to decide immediately. Above all, I do not want to push you in a certain direction. This is a decision that only you can make, all alone. I personally think that you can only benefit if you stay a little longer and you open your mind to these thoughts. Perhaps you could talk to one of the older brothers or with the novice master, for this is nothing new to them."
He looked up at Brother William and thrust his last remaining bishop from the board with his knight. Still, I had the impression that he was strangely quiet for the rest of the evening.
I had to distract myself. I looked around my room and was almost relieved when I discovered a leather-bound folder, the type also found in many hotels. It contained all kinds of useful information about life in the monastery; information concerning the Rule, the prayer and meal times, a floor plan of the monastery as well as a list of contacts I could turn to in case I had questions or needed emotional support. It was no surprise that a part of me already knew that a certain brother was not on that list. But, I kept telling myself, I did not come here to become acquainted with someone, but to finally find myself. Well, at least regarding my sexual orientation my stay already seemed to raise more questions than answers…
John let out an annoyed laugh. “Yeah. I remembered the liquor, candy and cocoa but forgot that ingredient.”
"And ... you don’t care?" I asked skeptically, although I was aware that I indirectly admitted that I felt something for the dark-haired monk.
A cab was waiting outside the door - Sherlock had called for one while John changed. They slid in side by side and were silent for several minutes. John finally took Sherlock’s hand. “Did you look up the requirements?”he asked. “Is there any kind of waiting period?”
“My good man, did you just say…” Watson’s declaration was interrupted by another bout of coughing. “Twiddle diddles?”
Sherlock, confused at the kind lady’s abrupt change of demeanor, followed. She was halfway up the staircase by the time Sherlock entered the foyer. Her frightened face turned toward him as she hissed, “Hurry!”
"If Brother Jonah needs help, then I want to help him get it - so why not let it be me who helps him? I know I'm just a stranger who has nothing to do with the whole thing, but maybe that could be what’s needed? Perhaps I can look at it more objectively than you or Brother Jonah can?"
Without hesitation - and above all, without letting me out of his sight - he pushed the sleeve of his habit a little way up, and stretched out his pale, sinewy arm. I already felt the trembling of my hands, but I tried not to show it as I put my fingers around his narrow wrist and held my thumb on the artery and stared at my watch.
John looked down his body at Sherlock’s upturned face. Sherlock’s eyes flashed playfully as he stroked over John’s bollocks and down his thigh, trailing his slick fingers through the wiry hair, drawing slick designs into the shiver-sensitive skin, then stoked his palm back up to firmly massage the root of John’s cock. The knuckles of his other hand brushed the back of John’s sac before his tongue finally replaced his fingers, laving John’s bollocks and perineum and trailing kisses over his thighs, drawing a full body shiver from John. John watched a tiny pearl of translucent fluid appeared at the tip of his cock as Sherlock kissed up his thigh, lingering at the place thigh became hip and ending with a wet swipe up his cock to gather the drop of fluid. Sherlock sat back between John’s thighs and licked his lips as he poured more slick into his hand then rubbed his palm together.
“Well, I have all these messages. You wrote them, and they’re. Well, they’re wonderful. The best thing you could have ever done for me. And, you know. I just … I’m not good with words. With talking, I mean. I’m better at writing things out.” John felt a blush rising. Really, it was ridiculous to be embarrassed in front of Sherlock. He’d had his tongue up Sherlock’s anus, for god’s sake. How could he be embarrassed at Sherlock catching him writing a love note!
"You're not like him," I said quietly, "You've proved that people can change. You have managed to defeat your addiction. Now look at what has become of you! "
"Exactly. And I'm not the type to run away from something. And you aren’t, either, I believe. Therefore, I now ask you the same question: do you want to try to face the challenge and fight the demons of your past or do you want to draw the line at this point?"
"I do this based on free will. And you should know by now that I do not need any kind of support whatsoever. "
Sherlock moaned and buried his face in John’s neck, panting hot against John’s sweat-damp skin.  “Give me your hand,” he gasped. John licked his palm and threaded it between their bodies to capture Sherlock’s rock-hard cock. Sherlock’s skin felt hot and dry, distended over the thick vein that ran the length of his cock, and he shuddered violently when John stroked down the hot length. Taking a moment to readjust his hips to line up his own aching erection with Sherlock’s, John stretched his fist to accommodate the girth of the two of them together. Sherlock jerked like he’d touched a live wire then snapped his hips into John’s fist faster and faster, making little ‘aha’ sounds with each exhale until he shuddered and came, scorching John’s belly with his release.
"Yes, he is ..." I murmured reverently, staring at the curly head with my mouth open. He had closed his eyes and let the bow glide over the strings of the violin with a gentleness as if he caressed a loved one. Maybe that was indeed the case, perhaps to him the music was some kind of substitute for the relationship he could never have. In my opinion, the music ended much too quickly, but the audience showed their appreciation with loud applause. The dark-haired monk nodded in thanks and then retired to the newspapers.
What Sherlock didn’t see as he flailed was John, hit by an unobservant cyclist who knocked him to the ground head-first. John got up from the pavement quickly and, since all attention was on Sherlock’s ‘suicide,’ no one thought to insist that John have a CT scan to check for concussion. Thus, said concussion went undiagnosed. John never noticed his mild memory problems because – well, he couldn’t remember, so he didn’t know he had a problem. Others around him attributed his memory lapses to the horror and grief of watching his best friend and flatmate commit suicide right in front of his eyes.
"I see how he looks at you when he thinks you don’t notice - and I also see how sad he is. If you had met earlier ... "
He’d exchanged texts with Mycroft and before he’d even unlocked the door at Baker Street, he’d been granted access to post messages to the secure website.
Pawing at each other’s clothing, kissing and groping, they ended up in the kitchen. Sherlock’s coat and jacket had been shed on the way, along with his shoes. Continuing to murmur filthy phrases without paying much attention to the words that left his mouth, John found his shirt hanging from the waistband of his jeans, flapping behind him. He didn’t remember shucking his jacket - Sherlock must have worked it off at some point. Frustrated at his constraining clothing, John quickly unbuttoned his jeans and shoved them down roughly. His pants went the same path and he kicked his shoes off impatiently then the offending clothing.
It turns out that the chapter is much longer than I'd planned so I'm splitting it into two chapters. In this new arrangement, this chapter turns out to be mostly smut. I hope that makes up for the long wait.
- his notes would not start with apologies. He and Sherlock had both said their apologies and agreed that none further were needed. John wanted his first note to echo Sherlock’s tender words, not apologize for injuring him further. He opened a new document and began:
John hung his head. “Yeah, about that. Mary asked me out. It was easier to just go along. I thought my best friend and partner was dead.  I just didn’t care anymore, it was easier to go along with her than to be alone.”
But loving him didn’t erase the daily tension between them. It didn’t excuse the distaste that Sherlock displayed when John did make an effort to be affectionate. John bit his lip, irritated at his own conflicted feelings. In the end, John knew without doubt that he could never follow through on his threat. Even if their feelings were waning, even if the flame was guttering - John would hold out until the last gasp, and he’d be there to lock the door behind them if Sherlock ever walked away.
The bed was a mess, they were both a mess, they’d have to strip it and wash the sheets before bedtime. But for now, John was content to hold Sherlock’s hand, to feel Sherlock’s arm around him and to place a kiss on Sherlock’s sweaty forehead.
“Sam,” Sherlock said loudly over the dance music. “I think you should get me a drink, Carlos, before we dance.” Sherlock stuck out one hip and crossed his arms across his chest, the picture of a young man on the prowl.
I stared at him as if I could make him open his eyes, but the reaction was the same as before: nothing. I was almost ready to give up, but then the miracle I had been hoping for so long happened. Gently, almost tenderly, his index finger and middle finger closed on my hand. The touch was barely noticeable, he was so weak, but he was clearly there. I noticed a slight trembling of his eyelashes, as gentle as the wingbeat of a butterfly - a blink, and you would have missed that wonderful moment. As long as I could, I enjoyed the indescribable feeling that flowed through my entire body as I witnessed his slow awakening.
But Sherlock was too good. Within a few short minutes, John pushed at Sherlock’s shoulder and gasped, “Sherlock.”
"We do. In fact, I know it. I’ve researched. And my research makes me sure that you did not tell me the whole truth. "
Just when I worked up the courage to ring the doorbell, the door before me opened and a gray-haired man in a black habit with inconspicuous wire-rimmed glasses on his nose stood before me.
. These words, too, went through my head again and again, but the question now arose as to what kind of interest it was. I could not imagine that he - a man who voluntarily committed himself to a life of silence and chastity - had made tender advances toward me. And then, of course, there was that still, breathed
Ella still looked at me as if waiting for me to bring up the crucial detail for her. The trigger for my gloom. When I did not respond, she tried again.
The next morning was uneventful. Brother William, as usual, had appeared at early mass, and for the last time had taken his place at the extreme end of the choir stalls. I was secretly happy that his banishment would end with this evening, since he seemed extremely lost when he was not between the other brothers, but among those novices, who had only been part of the convent for a few months. He was also sitting in my direct range of vision, so I could not miss how absently he was behaving this morning. Tired, on the one hand, but also absent-minded; several times he did not respond to the psalms until after a short delay, and he seemed to be very ponderous when he fell to his knees for the silent prayer.
But Mummy had prevailed, and now not only were her sons coming home for Christmas, but Sherlock had invited three friends. Violet had always envisioned a house full of merry guests for the Holidays when her boys were little - handsome grown sons, wives and of course grandchildren. Life had turned out quite different than she’d imagined. She had the handsome grown sons, but no wives were in the plan - or husbands. It bothered Violet not one whit that her sons were gay, but she was concerned that they both had shut themselves off from any chance at love, or partners, or family. It seemed the Unfortunate Event with the other one had scarred them both for life.
"Don’t you want join us?" I was approached by an elderly clergyman whose thinning, graying hair stood in a heavy contrast to his bushy, jet-black eyebrows.
My eyes fell on the church clock - it was only a quarter past one. Rarely have I made a decision in less time than now. I ran down the steps, walking the corridors with certainty, as if this was my home, and rushed to the front gate. The brother on duty at the gate looked at me with a frown but did not ask any further questions when I called him a hurried "I have to leave for a while, an emergency". A few minutes later I raced down the street in my old Volvo, steadfastly heading for my destination - St Mary's Hospital in Aldershot.
It was obligatory for him to show up. I was, on the other hand, only a guest, who would probably not really offend my hosts if I just overslept after a busy day and by doing so missed the nighttime prayer despite the bell-ringing. Once again, I glanced to the window on the other side of the building - everything was still dark. Once more I rose, pushed the curtains aside, and opened the window to remove the reflection of the light on my night stand in it. The night was cool and the air smelt of modern foliage, of dampness, of smoke - autumn had begun. The wind blew softly through the branches with a soft creaking; somewhere in the distance I could hear the faint roar of a brook. In the sky,  millions of stars and between them the full moon shone with all its might and bathed the garden beneath me in a ghostly white light. But on the other side of the building there was still impenetrable darkness. I sighed, closed the window, and stood in the middle of the room.
One officer pulled Mary to her feet and another cuffed her hands behind her back. Lestrade directed them to take her to the police cars that waited in the back alley. “Go on, book her. I’ll be along in a bit.”
Whereas before, they’d indulged Mrs. Hudson and hosted Christmas Eve gatherings, and visited Sherlock’s parents for a Christmas family gathering, now they preferred to spend both the eve and the day on Christmas alone. Just the two of them at home, all of 221 Baker Street to themselves since Mrs. Hudson visited her sister for Christmas.
"I will not speak to him," I promised, pausing until the priest found the key and opened Jonah's door.
I nodded, even though I didn’t believe that "educational" measures were necessary or even appropriate for an adult man.
Sorry for the long delay. Family life has been hectic plus the 4th Quarter is the busiest time for my IRL job - that's why this took so long. The good news is, I have the next chapter half done and the final chapter completely done, so it won't be such a long interval until the next chapter is up.
The lines around John’s mouth softened. His lips appeared minutely fuller because tension in his facial muscles eased. The whites of Sherlock’s eyes were brighter, because he was getting more sleep (more sleep meant more time touching John so Sherlock was wholeheartedly in favor of it). Both men held their shoulders in a more relaxed pose.
I looked around, in search of the British Government, aka Mycroft Holmes, whom I discovered in conversation with the Prior. I glanced questioningly at Sherlock and Jonah.
With a final shake of Sherlock’s neck, John stepped back. His demeanor instantly changed into one of concern. “Here, c’mere,” he murmured as he drew Sherlock into his arms. Sherlock propped his chin on John’s shoulder and shut his eyes tightly, enjoying the closeness of John’s embrace in spite of the pain throbbing through his arm and everything that had transpired.
you? That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. Sherlock does not need anyone, the only person important to him is himself. "
Frank went around his desk and dropped into his chair. He rubbed his temples with one blunt hand, thumb and forefinger working the flesh of his face in small circles. With a sigh, he looked up at Sherlock. “How the hell did a British kid end up breaking into my yard and sleeping in my truck? I want to believe you, kid. I do. But it’s just too much of a coincidence.”
"The chocolates! I did not even realize that you've been here before, must have slept pretty well ... And most importantly, I did not realize you knew that it’s my birthday. "
"... Your vocation, I know. But if you do not recover completely right now, you might meet your Creator sooner than you are fond of. So - off to bed. Shall I leave for a minute? "
It gave Sherlock comfort to think of John sitting in his chair at Baker Street, checking the secure site before bed a few times a week. The longer Sherlock was away, the more he missed John and the more his posts revealed his feelings. As months stretched to years and his longing for John - and home - grew stronger, Sherlock poured his heart out to John frequently, until just before he was captured by the Serbians, he was posting several messages a day, telling John how he loved him, how he longed for him.
I gazed at the Bible, which lay on the pile of information material. Had this not been one of the reasons why I had come here? The search for the faith that had enriched my life so much when I was young? And now I sat here admiring the faith of so many other people as they drew strength from it and evidently led a fulfilled life, and I was still occupied chiefly with the things that were not part of the monastic life: the life stories of the brethren, their motivation to turn their backs on their daily lives and to join this convent, my misguided feelings for Brother William, or the meaning of the letter that Jonah had thrown away.
“No!” Sherlock nearly screamed.  “No, I don't want to go home.” He sprang from the chair, staring around wildly for a method of egress. The locked door was the only exit from the windowless office. “Frank, don’t send me home. I can help you in your business. I can, I can help you with this Jim who’s after you. Just don’t send me home.”
John felt more decadent than he’d ever felt, dripping with silicone lube from hip to knee, Sherlock’s hand stroking his bollocks in just the right places while stroking Sherlock’s frenulum at the same time, Sherlock making tiny “ah” sounds behind him on each exhale, the heat of Sherlock's chest, the Sherlock’s bony knees behind his own. John felt hedonistic and wanton and suspended in time, fully given over to Sherlock’s attention. He pushed his arse back against Sherlock as far as he could go, not wanting a single millimeter of space between them, then he rocked forward against Sherlock’s hand, moaning and panting. As he watched, another bead of precome pumped from his cock and dripped onto his belly, then another.
"I can not punish you for Brother William making a mistake. However, I would be very concerned that such a thing is not repeated in the future. If you can assure me of this, then there is nothing more I will expect. "
, then John would go along - happily. John would follow Sherlock to the ends of the earth and over the edge if only Sherlock asked. And he’d offer up his body for Sherlock’s enjoyment if that was what Sherlock needed.
Starting at Sherlock’s waist, John ran his hands slowly up Sherlock’s sides as they kissed. He broke the kiss when he encountered a ropy scar on Sherlock’s right side, between his lowest and next higher ribs. Thumbing the scar lightly, John asked, “What’s this?”
I needed to stop my thoughts from wandering. And, as read in the strict gaze of the novice, I also needed to stop apologizing over and over again.
Again I stared out the window. A question remained that left me no rest. According to what Jonah had told me, the separation of the two had been the result of his decision to enter the monastery - Brother William had at that time been anything but enthusiastic about his decision - he had ended the contact and had not restored it ever since. And then, little more than a year later, he had appeared again on the scene - as a fully ordained monk. Even assuming that he had gone to France immediately after their separation, had joined a convent, successfully completed the novitiate and took his vows for a few years, this did not explain his motives, nor the astonishing speed at which he had completed his monastic education - and certainly not the fact that he had returned directly to England afterwards and had joined the community which his former partner also belonged to.
On the third day, John began to feel a swelling in his bollocks. By night the pain was unbearable and John’s doctors stood by helpless while John’s body fought the rare complication of adult Chickenpox: testicular infection.
Eyebrow raised, he looked at me as if waiting for another explanation, but without urging me to give it.
The date was months before he’d met Mary. What had he been doing? Most of that first year was a fog. A fog of sleeping long hours, dragging to work and slogging through the day like swimming through wet concrete then going home and drinking his dinner to fall into bed and start the cycle all over again. It was less than a half-life - it had been a mostly-dead-life.
John was so engrossed in his thoughts, he didn’t Sherlock arrive home until Sherlock strode through the bedroom door, bringing the scent of wood smoke and cold still clinging to his hair. Sherlock leaned over John’s shoulder and peered at the laptop.
"What did you do to him?" he hissed, slamming me against the wall again when I did not answer immediately.
“Sherlock, I can tell you know that I was never impressed with your John. He did appear to be a gentling influence on you but as a man, I felt he lacked basic respect. He was rude at times, has a hair-trigger temper, and continued to fail to impress me with his behavior. Isn’t it true that he insisted you were not a couple, nearly shouting from the rooftops that he was not gay, until well after you were together?” Mycroft didn’t want to be unkind to his brother, but he did want to paint a realistic picture of John Watson in the hopes Sherlock would be objective.
No television, no radio, no newspaper, his phone deactivated - John felt very disconnected from the world. He decided to just think for a while. He needed a break from Sherlock’s messages so he sat down on the sofa and placed his meal on the coffee table. He ate mechanically while lost in thought. He thought about the juxtaposition of Sherlock, rounding the globe and risking his life while John had been living a routine existence with Mary. Of Sherlock alone, in ever stranger places with ever stranger disguises, while John muddled about suburban London mowing the lawn, taking out the trash, cycling to work to keep his weight check since he no longer had criminals to chase.
After the end of the service the brothers left the church in two rows and gathered for dinner in the refectory - Brother William, however, was missing. At first I thought he had left for Brother Jonah to bring him his food, but then I saw one of the novices with a wooden tray that contained a soup bowl and a glass of water; he set out in the direction of the sick-room. In the dining room I looked around again and could not find the slightest trace of the man, who was almost painfully missing. Slowly I began to worry and longed for the evening gathering in the recreation room; I wanted to inquire after the whereabouts of Brother William and hoped that my questions would not excite too much attention.
“Dull!” Sherlock drew out the word to almost a moan. “I have plenty of money. You don’t need to work. Just call them and tell them you won’t be back.”
And the flicker of irritation that flared at the thought of the money he’d spent and the time he’d invested? John tried to stifle that, too.
Slowly, as if in slow motion, William lifted his hand to the spot where both Jonah and I stared, wide-eyed, dipping the tip of his finger into the dark red liquid, then looking at it as if he did not understand what was going on. I could not watch it anymore.
"'The one with the short cut hair'. I'm glad he does not honor his name, would be a shame about these locks ... "
"Evidence is of no use if nobody knows who is behind it. Jonah sent me to look for clues in your room, but I didn’t find anything."
Mycroft nodded, two quick snaps of his head. “John, there are things you don’t know about Miss Morstan. Things I need you to know before you make any hasty decisions.”
Leaning back in his chair, he put his fingertips together and rested  them his chin on it, brooding silently.
"Brother Jonah," he explained, drawing air quotes in his claw-like fingers as he rolled his eyes, as if he considered the custom of choosing a religious name at the beginning of the novitiate one of the stupidest things he had ever encountered.
"Don’t you think that would be unfair to the other brothers? Brother Jonah is not the only one here who likes Brother William and may wish to bid him farewell - even though, of course, we all hope and pray that the Lord will not call him just yet. Doctor, what’s wrong with you ...? "
My faith had often helped me, especially in Afghanistan ... if  shots cracked around you and bombs detonated in close proximity, it could be immensely comforting to hope that somewhere, someone was holding a protective hand over you and over your squadron. As I lay there in the glowing desert sand and felt my life fading with every drop of blood dripping from my body, I had prayed for the first time in years. I begged the God whom I had ignored for so long to let me live and not to let me die in the middle of nowhere without a soul at my side. And He had heard me. My comrades had found me in time and had brought me to the relative safety of the hospital, where surgery was performed on me and I was drugged up to the eyeballs with antibiotics to counteract the onset of sepsis and, after two weeks, flown back home. The wound itself was not fatal, but the massive blood loss was hard on my body. The two weeks immediately after my injury are dim in my memory to this day; my knowledge about this period came mainly from the other soldiers’ stories and the treating physicians’ reports. I knew that my life would never be the same again; yet I was grateful to have escaped without lasting damage.
When I stopped my car in the gravel parking lot in front of the hospital, I thought for the first time of how I would proceed. Of course, I couldn't just walk in the door, ask about Brother William, and expect to be sent to him so easily - but I did not have any other promising plan. Perhaps the clinic staff would be persuaded by my argument that  I had treated him during the emergency and now wanted to check on his condition? I had to try it - there was no other way.
"Brother William repents for a fault he has committed. He is excluded from active participation in worship and from the common meals until the end of the week. He seems to be fasting at the moment, for I have not seen him in the kitchen tonight," an elderly monk with thin, blond hair, who suddenly looked at me very attentively answered. "Is everything alright with you? You are so pale suddenly... "
Back at work for just a few weeks, John was finding his new position with the team as assistant coach to be part nanny and part drill sergeant to the players. The strategy sessions with the other coaches, watching films of their opponents’ recent matches and planning their own offense and defence strategies wore on for hours. But what really surprised him was just how much he enjoyed his new job. Being told he’d never play again had seemed like the end of his dreams. But he now had a new lease on life in coaching the team he loved.
"Maybe" I replied, "Or someone poisoned you. And that's why I'll call for an ambulance now and have you taken to the nearest hospital. "
Skipping from navel to hipbone to hip crease, Sherlock littered kisses on John’s body as he settled  between John’s legs.  John watched and made a sympathetic sound at Sherlock’s languid movements - he was obviously moving carefully to avoid pulling the tape holding the bandages crossing his back in place. John heard a click, then Sherlock’s lube-slicked hand circled his cock and the other gently slicked his bollocks. Sherlock kept his mouth in motion, kissing the inside of John’s thigh, the soft skin just beside his sac, his kneecap - everywhere but the place John most wanted his mouth to be.
"I do not believe that. I would rather point out that he just forgot that he is on kitchen duty today. There's been something up there lately with the boy, God knows what it is ... No matter. Please do me a favor, Doctor Watson. I need some fresh herbs for the food. Would you go into the garden and get them? I've already made a list for you ... "
I cleared my throat and glanced uncertainly around the room. "Honestly ... I'm not very good at cooking ..."
To John, every shared breakfast is a celebration of all those dates. Every time they brush their teeth side-by-side at the bathroom sink. Every time Sherlock shyly takes his hand in the backseat of a cab and hides their handclasp under a fold of his coat. (They’re both still reticent about public displays of affection.)
"I'm sorry I can not offer you anything better but my money was only enough for this," she said tersely, as she could only provide a small pot of vegetable soup for Harry and me. "I'll get my wages tomorrow, then I'll make up for this."
"Prior Lambert did that immediately after he was informed about the events. The investigation is already underway. "
John looked simultaneously hopeful and broken, and it made Sherlock’s lungs feel to small. He finally took a breath and said softly, “I didn’t see any heavy cream in the bags.”
More and more pressing was the question whether the two men had known each other before. Could I dare to listen to Brother Jonah a little, without being suspicious? The idea that I could be jealous of Brother Jonah was completely absurd. Why should I? That's why I really didn’t have to worry ...
I looked up at him and realized only by my blurred vision that my eyes had filled with tears. I shook my head indecisively and was about to respond when I was cut off by the loud opening of the door.
"’ If a man lies with another man as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination. They shall surely be put to death. Their blood guilt shall be upon them.’ That’s Leviticus 20:13-15.”
There was a slight commotion in the church for a moment when the friars got up in order and went into the sanctuary to receive Communion. I briefly thought about joining them but then decided against it. I was conscious of too many guilty memories that kept me from joining in. Brother William went forward last and knelt on the lowest altar step. Prior Lambert put the Host on the tip of his tongue. I went both hot and cold at the sight; I was aware that I could not stare at him like this, certainly not at such an intimate moment for a true believer - and yet I could not look away from his sensual, slender shape, the dark curls that played tenderly around his pale face and his lips. Absolutely inappropriate things raced through my head and I turned away embarrassed, hands frantically pressed to my lap. Pull yourself together, John Watson! This is neither the right time nor the place for such thoughts - quite apart from the fact that the man of my daydreams was committed to life as a monk and would never return my feelings.
About an hour later there was a timid knock on the door of my room. For a brief moment I waited to see if my guest would just open it, but when that didn’t happen, I called a half-loud 'Come in!' at the direction the knock came from. The door opened a crack and a young monk with short blond hair and  fashionable black-framed eyeglasses on the top of his snub nose shoved his head into the room.
Sherlock grinned wickedly while he rose, took John by the underarms and hauled him onto the bed. He crawled over John, caging him in with hands and knees and staring intently into John’s eyes. John shivered. He had never forgotten what it felt like to be the sole focus of Sherlock’s overwhelming attention. To feel so open and so cherished, knowing that Sherlock could read every thought and desire.
With a soft sigh, John relaxed into Sherlock and opened his lips to caress Sherlock’s tongue with his own. Before - before  Sherlock jumped, before John died inside, before things got so complicated - they’d been lovers, but not loving. They’d vied for control inside the bedroom and fucked rough and dirty. Kisses, when they indulged, were more tongues battling for domination than a way to convey feelings.
I wandered through the ancient hallways of the monastery, took a look at the kitchen, looked out from the cloister into the spacious garden with its sea of flowers, rich fruit-bearing apple trees, and a small fountain in the middle. At the opposite end of the garden I even saw some beehives. My search finally led me to the library, where I found Brother William as I’d suspected, sitting at a long wooden table in the far corner of the room, inconspicuous nickel eyeglasses on the tip of his nose and fully absorbed in a thick, leather-bound book. I did not want to interrupt him in his studies, but I felt such an urgent need to apologize to him that I could not miss this chance.
He’d finished breakfast, stuffed his own clothes in a plastic bag he found under the kitchen sink, and retrieved the laptop when the doorbell rang. He opened it to bright sunlight and Mycroft Holmes, immaculately turned out in a charcoal grey suit.
"And how do we proceed now?" I asked carefully. One “we” did not exist between me and the Father, after all, I was only a guest here and did not have the right to interfere in the matter of the convention. My interlocutor, however, seemed quite taken by my concern for the young monk.
"No," I replied, both convinced and embittered, "All this ... was as false as the story of the deeply religious monk. He probably just wanted to talk to me to find out if I was a threat to you. "
A long-groaned moan that could mean anything or nothing escaped his throat, but he clung to me now instead of letting himself sink to the ground again, although he wavered threateningly. I tightened my grip and took a cautious step forward.
Sherlock responded with a smile again, then shrugged apologetically and turned to Jonah, who translated Sherlock’s signs:
, and John leaned back on his elbows to watch Sherlock’s gorgeous pink lips circle his rock-hard cock.
, John’s nerves stretched a little thinner. Whoever was texting just wouldn’t let up. John’s hands itched to snatch the phone from where it lay beside Sherlock's plate and chuck it in the bin. He tried to stifle his irritation but when Sherlock’s fidgeting reached fever pitch, he could no longer hide his ire.
After a time Sherlock kissed John’s shoulder and said, “I’ll get a towel.” John made a soft “mmm” sound in reply while Sherlock pushed up from the bed and kicked off his pants. He went into the ensuite, still wearing his crumpled dress shirt. John listened to the sound of water running and Sherlock splashing, cleaning up before he dampened a flannel for John. He returned and handed the flannel to John, which John employed while Sherlock rounded the bed and climbed back in. Instead of laying down beside John, he sat near John’s waist and inspected John’s face gravely.
John sighed and slumped into the seat. He was already exhausted by this conversation and it hadn’t truly begun. “Different how?”
After the initial newness of their relationship wore off, things returned to much the same as they’d been before Sherlock jumped and John got his concussion. There were a few marked differences. Sherlock no longer forgot and left John behind at crime scenes. In fact, John was usually so much at the front of his thoughts, he had to learn to think around his John-thoughts. And John gave up his full-time position at the surgery, He stayed on the locum list and worked a few shifts a week to give them an income they could rely on to pay the bills but as The Work picked up with the spread of news of Sherlock’s return, he took on fewer and fewer surgery shifts in favor of wild chases and all night stakeouts with Sherlock.
“I never thanked you,” he finally said. His voice was low but he was sure Sherlock was listening. “You said you did for Mary. But I know. You did it for me.” John paused, and when Sherlock didn’t respond, he concluded, “So thank you.”
Stumbling naked down the hallway, John pulled Sherlock into the bedroom. One there, he pushed Sherlock into a sitting position on the edge of the bed then took Sherlock’s chin in his hand, positioning Sherlock’s mouth just so. Dimly aware of Sherlock’s hand moving to shed his own shirt and unbutton his own trousers, John continued the rough kisses that had started on the stair, holding Sherlock firmly by the chin and hair. He was achingly turned on, filled with the paradox of of his own mortality and the pulse of his own
John continues calmly putting away the groceries he’d stopped for after work. Sherlock rifles through bags, commenting on nearly everything. “You could go to the supermarket yourself, you know. Liquor store, too. Nothing holding you back.”
The last word was nothing more than a breath of air and as weak as its sound was its effect. Sherlock's chest rose and fell with the rhythm of the ventilator, and it was not until I rested my hand on his chest that I could feel his heart beating. Weak, but even. If I had hesitated the previous visit, it now seemed as if my body wanted to make up for what it had been denied the last time; I wanted to touch him, stroke his skin, run my fingers through his dark curls and feel his lips on mine. But instead of continuing to indulge in dreams that would never come true, I thought better of it and began to talk. I told Sherlock about everything that had happened since his involuntary departure from the monastery, about Jonah's 'excursion.'
"I was fine until now ...", he murmured and looked at me, startled, as if only now realizing how bad off he was, "What happens now?"
With his back to me stood a tall man with a strikingly straight posture and short blond hair, parted deeply on the side. In front of him, on the blanket next to Sherlock's legs, lay an open book. Beside the book was a small golden vessel. Most striking, however, was the fact that the man wore the habit of the friars, supplemented only by a violet stole that was placed around his shoulders. My worst fears seemed to be confirmed. Now, I had no doubt as to what was happening here. I felt like rushing for the man but since he did not seem to notice me yet, I decided to wait. I did not like him being so close to Sherlock, yet who knew what he would do if I attacked him. He stared down at his unconscious brother with folded hands, then, with a slow, deliberate movement, picked up the jar, unscrewed the lid, laid it on the nightstand, and drew closer to the bed. Slowly he dipped his thumb in the oily liquid and marked the young man's forehead and palms with the sign of the cross.
Hands still clasped tightly, they followed Lestrade to the kerb where a cab waited behind Lestrade’s car. They exchanged a few more words with the DI then settled into the cab for the ride back to Baker Street - back
He gave me a look I could not interpret, at once imploring and demanding. I sank back down into my chair and allowed him to pull me toward him, his movements still a bit slow. He brought my hand to his lips and placed a whisper-light kiss on my knuckle.
With a sigh, John withdrew his hand and stood. He looked down at Sherlock, still on his knees on the lino. This man who had held his heart since they were teens, with whom he’d built a life and a home, this proud, arrogant man was willing to plead on his knees for their marriage. John winced, knowing how much it must hurt Sherlock’s bad knee to kneel on the hard floor.
"Sherlock," I murmured, reaching for his hand again, interlacing my fingers with his and looking into his pale face, his closed eyes, and tangled hair, "You must not die. Please wake up!"
My gaze wandered along the opposite wall while I counted the windows, soundless, with slightly open lips. Did I just imagine I could see a dark curly head in the window frame over there, about 50 meters away? I leaned forward a little, narrowed my eyes to be able to see past the sun glare, but now the dark silhouette I had just imagined seemed to have disappeared.
Before I could answer, completely taken by surprise, she went on with a wink: "There's another bedroom on the second floor - but I think you won’t need a second bedroom, will you?"
After the Prior put his glasses back on his nose and thanked the attendees for their attention, everyone stood up and went back to their usual routine as I retreated to the kitchen where Brother Elijah had already begun to prepare a small pot of herbal tea and cup on a tray for Brother Jonah. A bowl of porridge followed and was finally garnished with three fanned apple slices; it was clear that the cook wanted to make the novice happy with the lovingly prepared breakfast.
The conversation became more and more of a battle between me and the young clergyman, but I was sure that I could emerge victorious.
"I'm sorry," the priest replied, "I did not mean to blame you for inciting him to break the rules ..."
"No objection, for today you are laid off, sleep it out, and if tomorrow is better for you, I'll see you tomorrow morning. John, may I take advantage of the fact that you are a doctor just this one time and ask you to accompany Brother Jonah to his room? "
) for the past two years, struggling to put on the appearance of mourning his friend. If he’d only known!
But now, each brush of lips felt charged with emotion. When Sherlock’s tongue brushed John’s, it was as if a circuit closed in John’s body, flooding him with electricity. And from the sound Sherlock made in his throat, John didn’t have to be a genius to know that Sherlock felt the same. Sherlock shifted his weight, pulling John even closer, stroking John’s hair with the palm of his hand.
He contrasted that night with Sherlock’s description of his night. They’d both been cold and miserable and uncomfortable but at least Sherlock had known that John was still alive.
Sherlock gestured that he understood with a vague wave of his hand, half asleep. John bent and kissed his cheek. “Wash those sheets while I’m out,” he said over his shoulder as he headed into the loo.
He denied in a weak voice, but I didn’t have to be a trained medical practitioner to realize that he was lying. He coughed and I had trouble understanding him. His breathing was heavy and every word seemed to take an incredible effort, as if with every drop of blood a small piece of his vitality had left his body. What if he died in my arms before the ambulance arrived? I bit my lower lip to suppress my tears and dug my hand even harder into his upper arm.
John dropped his head and let his shoulders sag. Sherlock, asking him to pray. Sherlock Holmes, High Priest of the Church of Atheism,
His goal achieved, Sherlock leaned in to speak into Carlos’ ear. “I need the men’s room.” Carlos turned toward him and Sherlock winked and spun away. He wove through the crowded dance floor and headed straight to a door set in the back wall with a red Emergency Exit sign over it. He slipped out and sprinted down the alley, turned toward the ocean at the cross street, then ran block after block, high on adrenaline, dodging traffic at intersections, not stopping until he’d put at least half a mile between himself and the bar. He ducked behind a parked pickup truck and opened the wallet. He riffled through the credit cards and driver's license but left them in place - he was after cash, $288 that he found folded in the back compartment, removed and slid into the front pocket of his jeans. He passed a US Mail box in the following block and dropped the wallet into the letter slot, counting that a kind postal worker would find Carlos from the information on his driver's license and return the wallet. Sherlock might be a pickpocket, but he wasn’t a dickhead.
Deeply moved by his words, I did not know how to answer, and just nodded silently to his shoulder. A hurdle was crossed - but now it was necessary to clarify what exactly Sherlock wanted. But while he was in such poor health, I did not need to worry about it.
“No, John! I told you! The phone call! From the roof – remember? I told you about the secure site, how to access it and the password? John! I sent you 400 messages! Please tell me you read them!” Sherlock’s composure cracked. He clutched at John’s arms, trying to will him to understand.
He reached for the top shelf, nodded - and immediately vomited. If he had not been so drunk, I would have considered the diagnosis of 'concussion' positive. So, on the other hand, it was necessary to wait and, if necessary, to see a neurologist - but first I had to get Jonah out of this cellar! I leaned forward, reached for his glasses, pressed them to his nose, and grasped him with a strong grip. The young man belonged in bed as soon as possible.
Just as I walked towards the direction of the cloister, he reached for my arm and forced me to stand still. I looked at him questioningly, until I realized that his gaze was fixed on my left upper arm, on which one little bee was crawling. Slowly, he pushed a finger over the fabric of my woolen sweater, waited until the little animal climbed over, and then carefully set it down at the entrance hole of the beehive. He came back with a bright smile, patted me on the shoulder, and accompanied me back inside the convent. I could only hope that it had escaped his notice, how tense I had been by his short touches.
The conversation we had afterwards slightly reminded me of my therapy sessions with Ella - whereat the serious difference was that Father Andrew listened attentively, instead of taking notes. Besides, he did not look at the clock again and again, also in clear contrast to Ella, but always let me talk. When I asked questions, he did not counter with other questions, but gave me a simple answer. Perhaps that was what I had ever been lacking in the doctor's office: Father Andrew treated me as a human being, not a source of irritation which could only be borne because he ensured the livelihood.
John winced at the confident tone of the message. Sherlock had been so sure he’d take out Moriarty’s network in a matter of weeks and return home quickly. John wondered what other countries had Sherlock had visited. He’d take out a map once he got home, and a Sharpie, and draw out Sherlock’s travels. He’d open every message and plot them with pins on the map. He wondered if Sherlock could even recall his wanderings. But of course he could – he was
"Where else would you have made the acquaintance of my brother when he has been hiding behind monastery walls for almost a year?"
Meanwhile, Jonah had not moved from the spot, thunderstruck. When I saw the telltale glint in his eyes, I realized they were tears of joy.
"Why would I have done that, even though both you and Brother Jonah made it clear to me that it wasn’t possible?"
John reached a hand to Sherlock’s nape and pulled him down gently. He paused when their faces were level and searched Sherlock’s eyes, waiting for permission to reinitiate a physical relationship with the man he now realized he’d loved for so long. Sherlock smiled and John saw the same realization reflected in those pale eyes that he hoped his eyes displayed. Moving his hands to cup Sherlock’s face, John placed his lips gently against Sherlock’s. He tried to convey all the tenderness he felt through the chaste brush of lips. He moved his lips to Sherlock’s cheekbone and planted the softest of kisses there, then on to the soft spot just in front of his ear. “I’m sorry,” John murmured softly. “Can you ever forgive me?”
Straightening his spine, Sherlock stood with confidence he didn’t feel. He smoothed the front of his shirt and pushed up the sleeves of the jacket he still wore, the one he’d lifted at the nightclub the night before - the jacket that belonged to the intimidating man before him. He faced the boss - Frank - as if he owned the place.
For a moment, John thought that Sherlock might actually smile. A real smile, a smile full of warmth, like he used to reserve for John. It had been weeks since John had seen that smile and he realized how much he missed it. Then the ghost-of-a-smile was gone.
It was only when he started to turn a bit to the side that I realized that I had unconsciously placed my hand on his thigh, where it still rested.
Sherlock was in a funk and John tried to cheer him up by leaning over his curled-up form on the sofa to kiss his forehead and gaily exclaim, “Cheer up, Sherlock! It’s almost Christmas!”
Sherlock glanced down. Frank was, indeed, wearing steel-toed workboots. He drew a shaky breath and tried to summon the bravado he’d felt earlier. “My name is Bill. I’m here in Miami at a drug and alcohol clinic. My parents sent me here to get clean.” The waver in his voice embarrassed Sherlock but he couldn't seem to damp it down. Suddenly he felt very alone and very frightened. No one knew where he was - not his parents, not his meddling older brother, no friends; no one. “I signed myself out yesterday. My birthday, when I turned 18, they couldn't hold me any more. I wasn’t going to steal any of your equipment. I just wanted a place to sleep.”
Lost in sensation, John didn’t notice the blocks passing by until Mycroft leaned forward and spoke to the driver, “Pull over here.”
"Oh - I think I got him. Sherlock Holmes. Is apparently in the intensive care unit, that is, you would have to register there first in the nurses room. Fifth floor, left corridor. "
Again, I snapped out of my thoughts, so unusual it was for me to hear this man speak. He noticed it and began quietly giggling, a noise that sounded more like a soothing hum with him.
When the laptop finished booting up, he double clicked the audio file and closed his eyes. Sherlock’s voice, strained and wavery, filled the room, followed by his own voice that sounded strangely flat to his ears. He held his breath while he listened to the conversation the first time through, not realizing he was doing so. Afterward he let it out in a loud gust, feeling like he’d been punched in the gut.
"Our lost son has returned home," said the elder monk, who had served at the gate at noon - resting on his shoulder, Brother Jonah stepped into the room, and even though he was limping and his habit was torn at the side, he seemed to be well except for a few minor scratches on his face. Immediately, his brothers scrambled around him, escorted him to a place by the fireplace and pressed a cup of tea into his freezing hands.
Sherlock remained silent but squeezed John a little tighter. After a bit John’s breathing evened out. “And I’ve really not liked Christmas ever since.”
"Yeah, that's what we all thought ... but then Sherlock got a message. I still don’t know what it was and under what circumstances it reached him, but shortly thereafter Sherlock appeared in the clinic with his brother and two strange guys and they said it was necessary to get me out of the country immediately."
, John.  I thought it would be okay. And now look at what he did to you, jumping off a building and making you think it was your fault. I don’t care how good looking he is, that’s just unforgivable.” She paused at looked at John, obviously waiting for his agreement.
"Alright, without pathological findings. Although it would still be better if you would agree to have a computer tomography ... "
One long, white finger stroked the ribbon before hooking it and pulling it free. Sherlock eagerly tore the paper to find
"I feel so empty ..." I muttered, regretting it the next moment when I saw Ella wrote something on her pad.
I told myself. I tried to suppress the thought of the possibility that his condition might not improve. This was anything but easy, with Sherlock’s fear too clearly written on his face.
I looked around, amazed. The Prior had raised his voice but he still sat just as still behind his desk as before.
"I'm going to pack my things ..." I muttered, deeply ashamed. "Give Brother Jonah my regrets, will you?"
Well, John wasn’t going to expose Mary to Sherlock’s brand of crazy risk again. He’d done what he came for: thanked Sherlock for saving his life and said they could still be friends. Nothing in that mix allowed for Mary to be dragged into further danger.
I didn’t want to wake him, but wanted him to know that I was with him. It was not long before he opened his eyes and squinted at the bright sunlight. Then he looked at me with a sincere smile and turned his left forearm slightly so that my hand was now directly in his. His movements were still quite laborious but he managed to close his fingers around mine. Encouraged by this gesture, I did the same and tenderly stroked the back of his hand with my thumb. It was nice just sit together quietly and communicate only through the touch of our hands. Perhaps we would have stayed like that all afternoon, had Sherlock not  suddenly been gripped by a coughing spasm.
And Sherlock was bringing friends! That nice Dr. Watson who had taken such good care of him while Sherlock recovered from that ghastly gunshot wound. And Dr. Watson’s estranged wife. That seemed a little odd, but Violet supposed Sherlock had his reasons - and strongly suspected those reasons were to push them toward reconciliation. And a Mr. Wiggins. Violet didn’t recall ever hearing Sherlock talk about a Mr. Wiggins, but she was proud that Sherlock was kind enough to invite a friend who had no family to visit on Christmas.
He handed me his book and let me take a look at the pencil drawings he’d done to chase the boredom away. The first page held mainly motifs from nature - sketches of flowers from the monastery garden and an extremely detailed depiction of a hedgehog sitting next to the trunk of a tree and nibbling on pear that had probably fallen from the tree. I flipped the page to a portrait of the Virgin Mary, who looked out kindly with outspread arms. It was obviously an image of the statue that stood on a wooden pedestal between the two large windows in the novices’ classroom. I caught my breath at the next picture; it showed Brother William, who stood with his eyes closed between the fireplace and the bookshelf in the lounge and played his violin.
John woke the next morning with a feeling of conviction. He knew the course he needed to take:  gently end it with Mary; apologize to Sherlock; move back to Baker Street; spend the rest of his life trying to make it up to Sherlock how he’d acted since Sherlock returned.
It was only when the bell rang for morning prayer that I realized I must have fallen asleep after Brother William left. His nocturnal visit seemed strangely surreal in the cold light of dawn - had he even been here, in my room? Or had my mind, plagued by the unusual sleep pattern I’d experienced in the monastery, played a trick on me? I looked around for an indication that I had not imagined his presence, but of course I found nothing. Nevertheless, I was convinced that the encounter had to have actually occurred. After all, I could clearly remember his voice! Well ... at least I
"I was told there was something that had strained you - if you would like to talk about it, I would be happy to help you."
With a quick glance over my shoulder, I told Jonah to get help while I dealt with William, who insisted on sitting on the edge of the bed.
And the sounds - breathless “ahs” and “ohs” mixed with impatient “mnnnn” sounds while Sherlock quickly worked himself open, obviously wanting to get it over with and regain his connection with John. John picked up the bottle and slicked his own fingers and his aching erection. He was a little alarmed when Sherlock dropped his hand and leaned forward on both elbows, groaning, “John, come on.”
Suddenly it struck me that today was also Jonah's birthday - presumably, despite the latent threat, he would never have expected that his special day would take such a tragic course. I felt pity for him. But more than that, I pitied Brother William who was probably in hospital all alone and fighting for his life - I could only hope that he had not lost his battle.
John straightened into his Captain Watson pose. “Right, then. I’m off.” He glared at Sherlock for half a minute. Sherlock thought he caught a glimmer of something softer – regret, forgiveness? But it was gone before Sherlock could even identify it.
- not anyone else. Finally. After so many years of long glances, innuendo, almost-taken chances, missed opportunities. John wanted him.
Reaching for his mug, John answered quietly. “Sure, Mary.” He took a too-hot sip just to fill time while he silently calculated a way to disarm his former girlfriend. Who had now appointed herself his fiancee.
I knew exactly what he meant, but I still had to appeal to his reason if I did not want to blame myself for not having done everything to ensure his full recovery.
“Oh, god, Mycroft,” Sherlock moaned, “He surely thought…he believed that I’d committed suicide. He thought I was dead.” Sherlock’s stomach roiled at what he would have thought and done if the roles were reversed and he believed John had killed himself. He feared he would be sick. “What do I do now?”
"How did that happen?" I asked to the novice, who seemed to be too weak to answer me and only gave a low, painful groan. In his place, Father Andrew speculated that he might have slipped on the floor tiles and fell. When he heard these words, Brother Francis seemed to awaken briefly from his shock, blinking and looking restlessly around the room. He then raised a trembling hand and pointed to Brother Jonah, who was leaning against a wall, chewing nervously on his lower lip.
"Sherlock, I ... I don’t know how much you sense right now about what's happening around you, but maybe you've noticed that you're in hospital ... I'm not saying this to scare you but your brothers and I are very worried about you  ... of course I understand that your body has to recover now, but ... "
Frank straightened and surveyed Sherlock coldly. “If you tell me how you got in, I might let you walk out of here with your balls.”
Brother Elijah looked disappointed, but still wished him all the best from his heart, whereupon Sherlock placed a hand over his heart and bowed slightly in gratitude. Suddenly something seemed to occur to him and he pulled at Jonah's sleeve to get his attention. Jonah translated once more.
Perhaps it redounded to my advantage that I was granted a certain respect as a doctor and a former soldier; yet I wondered how I would react if I were to be attacked because I loved a person of the same sex. Would I react as Jonah had done? Resigned, but understanding? Would I get angry? Justify myself? And might I have reacted differently when he told me about it? Perhaps I should have been more honest with him, told him of the experiences I had had in Afghanistan, when the nights were long and lonely? Should I have mentioned Harriet? No, not a good example. I had already told Jonah that we did not have a good relationship with each other and that she still insisted that I was incapable of having a relationship, but if he would have asked me whether her coming-out had an influence on our fraternal relationship, I would either have to admit to that or admit that I had not supported her when she needed my help most urgently. When I was honest with myself, I was still ashamed that I had crawled into my room instead of protecting her from our father. Nor did it help that, after her departure, I had become the favorite victim for his anger; my bad conscience still plagued me.
I put a hand on his shoulder, wanting to make him turn toward me so I could take a closer look. Only then did I notice that he was trembling. Brother Francis joined us and looked at his fellow-brother, no less worried.
. John felt a shiver run down his spine.  The touched the transcript of the phone call and thought of the words he’d heard just before Sherlock jumped. His stomach clenched at the memory of standing on the pavement, being struck by the bicyclist, staggering up to try to reach Sherlock, fighting his way through the crowd, taking Sherlock’s wrist, looking into his lifeless eyes. He downed the rest his beer in a gulp, trying to summon the courage to pick up the pages.
As the friar disappeared into the confessional with Brother Jonah, I left the church and roamed around aimlessly, at a loss as to what to do next. I stopped at a long row of windows and looked out into a bright blue, cloudless sky; had it not been for such terrible events, it would have been a beautiful, clear fall day, one of the kind rarely seen.
Beside me was one of the priests who had previously served in the Mass, a man in his forties with even, dark skin, short black hair, and gold-framed glasses whose simple elegance fitted the rest of his appearance. He made an unobtrusive gesture to follow him to a chapel to the side. I did, casting one last worried glance at Jonah.
Best to put away those gloomy thoughts! She had a turkey to baste, piecrust to crimp, potatoes to peel and she needed to lay a fire in the living room fireplace.
As soon as I started toward him, I again felt the familiar lump in my throat. Actually, I thought I had finally left this stage behind me.
Reaching out to touch his shoulder, John murmured, “Sherlock?” He could see that Sherlock’s hands were trembling. Sherlock’s chest expanded to maximum capacity, then he let out the breath on a shaky sigh. He kept his face averted and his head braced in both hands.
"We're expecting you back for tea!" he shouted after me and grinned broadly, when I then jokingly saluted.
He said nothing else, giving me time to clear my mind about his unusual emphasis on the word 'accident'. Then he looked me straight in the eye.
Sherlock watched several emotions play over John’s features, one after another. And when John’s face settled into lines of weary resignation, fear flickered painfully through Sherlock’s gut.
Sherlock rounded the sofa and sank into the soft cushions. He glanced toward the telly and the detritus on the coffee table before him. A commercial for feminine hygiene products showing a young woman riding a horse in white jodhpurs and white blouse blared on the expensive television. A green glass ashtray near his knee held the partially smoked joint that Mrs. Hudson had obviously snuffed out when they entered the room.
Hastily I rushed over to him, crouched beside him, and felt for his pulse - weak, but present. With the sleeve of my sweater I pushed the broken pieces of the cracked bottle aside to get closer then lifted his upper body so I could take a closer look at the wound on his head. I let out my breath, relieved. Only a flesh wound. But still, he was unconscious and that worried me. I thought about letting him lie here while I ran to get help, but I soon realized how nonsensical such behavior would be. After all, I had the appropriate knowledge of treatment of emergency patients - I was just missing the right equipment. I took a quick look at the motionless young monk and estimated his weight at about 70 kg. To go up the steep stairs would be difficult, but not impossible. Nevertheless, it would simplify the matter considerably if he were at least conscious, because that could facilitate the transport. An arm still around his back, I tapped him with my free hand again and again against his cheeks.
John thought about yelling Mycroft’s name again, sure the phone on the end table would ring immediately but suddenly he just didn’t feel like engaging in the outside world.
And Sherlock loves it, simply loves it, when John tries out his idea that night, in their big bed, in the dark.
Frank held up a beefy mit. “Whoa, kid. Sit down.” He paused while Sherlock sank into the vinyl chair. “Why don’t you want to go home?”
"Thank goodness," I mumbled and got up so the paramedics could take care of their patient right away. Even as I got up, I felt the light touch on my arm as the young monk tried with the last of his strength to hold me beside him before dropping his hand in resignation. It was the saddest thing I had ever seen.
I could not suppress a soft sigh as I closed my locker door, and grabbed my jacket and backpack. Dr. Burke was right. I had made mistakes more often lately, had been inattentive and had even brought a patient to critical condition, because it was lost on me simply that he had significant symptoms of a stroke.
Mycroft rolled his eyes but complied with a sigh, turning his shoulders away from his brother and glaring out of the window.
Oh, what was all this? I would skip the Vigil, I decided. I crawled under my covers again and turned my face towards the wall, away from the window; I did not want to be tempted to stare again. Perhaps William himself had long since gone to bed to get a little sleep. Or - and the thought now preyed on my mind very stubbornly - he had not arrived at all. Could it be that someone had intercepted him on the way? I was not comfortable with that thought. It was not forbidden to sneak through the corridors at night, but as he seemed to be under observation anyway, it might lead to unpleasant questions. But why did I care? He was an adult, he could take care of himself. And I would see tomorrow morning if he was alright.
Sherlock discusses his encounter at the restaurant with his brother. They both realize that John has not had the full picture the past two years.
His penetrating glance rested on me, his forehead was creased with wrinkles. It seemed as if he was going to infiltrate my thoughts to look for an answer to his question. Suddenly his features relaxed and his lips opened, breathing a soft 'Oh'.
“Reading through your messages will help me remember what I was thinking and what I was doing while you were away.” John held Sherlock’s gaze, willing him to deduce what he meant so he could stop talking. When it was obvious to him that Sherlock didn’t, he continued, “It’s like therapy. Remembering things, how it felt. It helps me. You know, work things out. In writing.”
I unfolded the note, which by now had already yellowed slightly, and read the tiny, yet legible, handwritten words. According to his information, Francis had been mistreated as a child by his parents and housed by the youth welfare office in a children's home in Tralee. He had quickly adopted the prevailing Catholic moral teachings and had acted out - sometimes by force - against anyone who did not meet these values. He was a good student who passed his exams with top marks but he clearly lacked empathy. Nothing was known about the time between graduation and entry into the convent - he obviously had not said anything on his own and nobody had asked him either. Sherlock had speculated that he had to be in contact with one of the drug dealers during this time. He occasionally received mail from his old home, allegedly from his parents, to which, however, according to Sherlock's investigations, he had had no contact since early childhood. Shortly after Francis received the last letter, Jonah had sent the orange pips. A word on the note had been smeared to the edge and circled, making it difficult to decipher it.
I could not remember the last time I had consciously pronounced these words. Feeling strangely fulfilled, convinced that I was on the right path - wherever it might lead me. I walked further and further into the dark church, which at that hour was illuminated only by the lamps in the entrance, the Eternal Light before the tabernacle, and two large candles on the altar, which flashed there in unobtrusive glass vessels.
And John closed his eyes and shook his head again. Suddenly one dinner, one expensive bottle of wine, seemed a small gesture. Insignificant. There wasn’t anything he could reply - Sherlock was right. He heard Sherlock move and opened his eyes to watch Sherlock drop to his knees in front of him.
Fisting his fingers in Sherlock’s hair, John tugged to draw Sherlock’s head back enough to allow their eyes to meet. “I’m going to fuck you blind,” he whispered savagely.
I'm not sure what reaction I’d expected from Sherlock. What I got was a blissful smile, another kiss from lips so unspeakably tender, and finally, after I had let go of his hands, he signed slowly with obviously heartfelt emotion.
The high, wooden double doors of the west portal were closed but, as I noticed after a slight pressure on the brass latch, not locked. I pushed them open just far enough to slip through and close them silently behind me. I found myself underneath the organ mound in a small entrance area that was dimly illuminated by four ceiling lamps, with a small basin filled with holy water on the left, while on the right a wooden shelf held songbooks for guests. In fact, I had noticed that sometimes some people from the nearby village appeared, mostly old, single women. However, they brought singing-books with them, as I had already observed.
This voice was definitely familiar to me, only the speaker sounded strangely panicky, the voice at least an octave higher than usual.
The fight went out of Sherlock. His shoulders sagged as he turned toward his husband and spoke, softer now. “John. How can you think I don’t want this.” Sherlock gestured between the two of them.
I gave up. Apparently there was no chance to talk him round when it came to leaving the monastery. But at least I wanted to know the reason.
And that, in a nutshell, was John’s answer. His subconscious had skipped several steps ahead while his conscious mind had been ruminating. John sighed, allowing his mind to realize what his heart already knew: he couldn’t marry her. It wasn’t fair to him, it wasn’t fair to Sherlock, and it certainly wasn’t fair to Mary. Mary was a wonderful woman. She deserved someone who could love her without reservation – not a husband whose heart belonged to his best friend.
A vessel with the inscription Vitex Agnus-Castus caught my eye: chaste tree. I thought of how he'd had a bunch of the dried plants when he came to see me that night. Had he not alluded to my feelings towards him, but wanted to give me a hint? After all, that evening we talked about how it would be possible to help Jonah ... I reached for the container hastily, unscrewed the cap - and stared at about 500 grams of finely ground chasteberry. That could not be right, I was sure! On the verge of desperation, I shoved my hand in, searching for a hidden clue that I did not find. Now my nerves were actually at breaking point; I could not think of another place to continue my search. I thought frantically about the conversations I had had with him, especially trying to recall what he had said to me when he came to my room a few days ago, but soon realized that this conversation was only superficially about Jonah - instead of talking about how to help him, to protect him from the latent threat posed by the author of the letter, we had tried to figure out where we stood concerning our relationship. Whether feelings could be involved in the game was completely out of place. Even though I still had no answer to this question, I could say one thing quite clearly: Whatever had been behind this conversation - it had not been a hidden clue to a potential poisoner within the monastery walls.
Just pathetic, John realized. His life – his dreary sleepwalking through endless days of the same thing, over and over and over.
"This is our meditation room. Normally, it’s used for seminars attended by our guests or for retreats in small groups. Of course, it also serves for private prayer but most of us prefer to pray quietly in our cell or in front of the Blessed Sacrament. Since you are our only guest at the moment and the next retreat is scheduled for Advent, hardly anyone uses it at the moment, especially since the older brothers are not particularly eager to climb to the top floor. "
The fact that William had a brother astonished me - someone who had such traits as those he had revealed to me, I would have rather considered the typical only child. But the entry in the elegant handwriting of my so passionately revered monk proved the opposite - Mycroft Holmes was written plainly there, including a mobile phone number and a London address - Hampstead, if I was not mistaken. I could not resist raising my eyebrows a little. If his brother could afford an apartment in such a posh neighborhood, the family must be extremely well-heeled. One more reason to wonder why William had renounced it all to go to the monastery.
"Whether or not I leave this convent, if only for a few hours, is not up for discussion. I'm sorry, John. I appreciate what you did for me, but this point is not negotiable. "
I felt my cheeks blush slightly. Caught. I shook my head as if I could thus expel the unpleasant thoughts that started me haunt again. Perhaps it had been a mistake to come here, because actually I did not really know exactly what haunted me and slowly crept into not only my sleep, but also robbed the joy of life from me.
There was a time when John would have thrilled to hear Sherlock’s offer to do chores but now it just made him even more cross. Sherlock was just throwing out trifles to try to salvage his comfortable, settled life after John had spoken the one word that couldn’t be taken back.
A landline phone on an end table began to ring. John grabbed it savagely. “Mycroft! I need to talk to Sherlock
“But he claims he didn’t know about the secure site! His reaction seemed honest. He truly does not remember our last conversation d. He says he grieved for the past two years.” Sherlock wanted to believe it was true, that John had not merely cast him aside when he was no longer in London.
John thought he’d drop off quickly, since he’d been up over 36 hours, but his mind churned endlessly. He pulled the laptop close again and decided to start at the beginning and work forward this time. Opening the first message that had been posted two years ago, he read”
Carefully, I groped for the confessional in the dark church, which was somewhat hidden in the side doorway. I pushed the heavy velvet curtain aside and slipped inside to find that everything was just as I remembered - even the smell of old wood and sweat was similar. Just as I pushed the curtain back and went into the side doorway, I heard a faint crackling, followed by frantic steps on exactly the same path I walked. I hurried back into the confessional and listened intently - I did not want to be seen here late in the evening but I was as eager to know who else was roving around here in the middle of the night.
"No Jonah - doctor’s orders. Stay here and rest. At least today and tomorrow. Until ... well, until we know how William is doing. "
Blood tests confirmed that John suffered from varicella zoster infection - Chickenpox. Other than quickly transferring John to an isolation room and making him as comfortable as possible, there was nothing the doctors could do. The only antiviral available at the base hospital was Tamiflu, which did not treat varicella zoster infection.
Mrs. Hudson’s eyebrows flew toward her hairline. “Broke in!” He eyes locked on Sherlock’s. “You broke into Frank’s yard? With all of his security?”
As I passed through the lobby, I spotted Tessa speaking with a middle-aged man with heavily groomed, reddish hair, waving an umbrella next to him, looking through the entries in the visitor list. She noticed me and nodded unobtrusively in my direction whereupon the man, dressed in an elegant black three-piece suit, turned to me and examined me from top to bottom. He approached me and stood so close that I felt uncomfortable at the lack of distance.
John let his head drop forward on the pillow so he could see what was going on below his waistline. His cock stood flat against his belly, weeping and flushed, and below it Sherlock’s big hand cradled his bollocks. Sherlock’s fingers stroked gently and John drew in his breath on a groan when he realized that Sherlock was stroking both John’s sac and his own cock, the underside of the head where it nestled against John’s bollocks.
Almost tenderly he stroked Sherlock through the tangled curls and I was tempted to dismiss my suspicion as unfounded - had he not pulled a latex glove off his hands after applying the anointing oil and hastily disposed of it in the wastepaper basket. I had been half hidden behind the door but now I rushed forward, grabbed the man by the collar of his habit and hurled him against the wall with all my might. He shrieked in anguish when his back hit the hard surface with a loud crack. I stared with rage into the blue eyes of Brother Francis, who, though dazed by the impact, twisted his lips into a wry grin.
The detective, who was lying on his belly on the disgusting floor, saw John's eyes flicker to his face for a brief moment. John was nervous. He and Sherlock both knew the risk that Jason Kelleher held, and for the moment, he also held all of the cards. The man was an ex-US Navy Seal, as well as a Central Intelligence agent who had been caught selling international secrets, and had been on the run for months. On a special request for Mycroft, they tracked him down, but had misjudged his ability to outrun even Sherlock Holmes. They knew that he was telling the truth when he said he would kill Sherlock.
John ran a hand over his tired face. "Just... Tell me that Sherlock's safe." He ordered kindly. He didn't want to think of Mary at that moment.
"It doesn't matter how he found out, Sebastian, he knows, and if I don't do this, God knows what he'll do to you."
One of the military wives, a young girl who was barely older than Sherlock, had come over and introduced herself as Sam, then offered to take him for a drink. He had agreed, which he rarely did, but he needed to. They didn't talk throughout their drink, but when the time came, they had hugged, and parted ways.
The words came so suddenly, they almost shook the detective to his core. He hadn't even noticed that John was sitting in his old chair in the living room (he had even forgotten that John still had his key), and it took all he had not to go running to him right off the bat. Instead, he said nothing, and quietly slipped his coat and scarf off of his thin frame, and walked quietly to his own chair.
By popular demand, I brought back this story from its' metaphorical grave, so, here it is! I said there would be a sequel, so, here's your little sneak peak at it!!
"Stop where you are!" Came a rough, gravelly voice from behind the building. Out of the corner of their eye, they could see the tall, silver-haired Detective Inspector of New Scotland Yard coming toward them with a gun ready. "Stay right where you are, and put your hands above your head. Don't try to run. Just do what I say, and this can be easy." He growled, his feet scraping across the pavement as he got closer and closer.
Effie smiled. "Nice of you to join the party, Dr. Watson." She called out smoothly, like she were greeting guests at a dinner party.
He pushed the door opened, and stepped up beside the doctor, keeping a safe distance between them as to not bother him. John didn't move. "I... I figured that you would want to be alone, but I didn't think it was wise." The detective whispered.
He hesitated. He didn't want to tell her he was meeting with Sherlock, just in case she thought he was going to go back to the cases, but lying would do nothing. It was impossible to lie to Mary, and he promised he would always tell her the truth. All hatchets had been buried since
Effie Taras sat down on the cold ground, her legs stretched out in front of her, her ankles crossed, and looked down at her hands as she picked at her fingernails. "How about this, pretty boy. I'm going to tell you a story, and you tell me what you think I mean." She briefly looked up at him, and when he leaned back in the chair, straightening up to listen, she smiled. "Think back twenty two years ago. You were sixteen, and you were taking a trip to the Ukraine with your brother I think it was. You got wind of a possible child trafficking ring in the East. You, being you, decided it would be a good idea to check out. You searched, found evidence, but the police wouldn't listen to you. So, you decided to go check it out by yourself. After a few days, you managed to find the group, and you saved the life of a ten year old girl. She was about to be raped and murdered, and you saved her. The next day, you left the Ukraine. No one ever knew what happened. To this day, no one knows. John Watson doesn't know, that handsome Detective Inspector of yours doesn't know, the police forgot after a while, even you may have forgotten what you did." Effie paused and gazed up at Sherlock with eyes that suddenly seemed so utterly familiar that he would have fallen if not for the chair. "But I'll tell you one thing; that little girl never forgot."
"Well, between your dangerously high fever, raging infection, severe dehydration, cracked ribs, slight blood loss, and the remainder of the more minor injuries, I'm honestly surprised you managed to walk five miles in the desert and still be alive." Mycroft replies rather bitterly.
Effie shook her head. "Not really, I work for his favorite sniper's ex-wife, and she's just as bad. But, like I said, Mary and I aren't working for the deadman now, but Mary still thinks she does, considering his most recent pop-up across the world. Strange though, his silence." She said almost too nonchalantly.
Dana Carlisle came back alive, she would have the credentials of a Secret Service agent under Mycroft Holmes. She's not considered a threat, she's not considered a criminal, in fact, no one actually knows her past record. I had it wiped. If Lestrade were to look her up, he'd get nothing but an MI6 record, which is confidential. Only we know the truth. I thought of it as a way to say thank you for what she did for us."
Everything starts to fall. He sees everything at once; the rooftop of Bart's, Baker Street, Serbia, the tall one's face as he delivers blow after blow to his body, John's horrified expression as he watched him fall... John.
John was between patients at the clinic, and he had a few minutes to himself. He hadn't spoken to Sherlock in nearly a month, and he had to admit that he missed the overbearing prat.
She nodded. "Of course, I'll be the one to have to fix it if anything goes askew." She replied. "Now, I'll have a team ready to clear your body out of there after Sherlock jumps, and we'll get you out of the country. Bassy, you'll have to stay for a few days, to keep an eye on things, but you'll have to pretend like Jim's dead for real. Grieve. Get drunk. Whatever. It doesn't matter, just look really distraught. Then, we'll ship you out to meet him wherever you guys end up, and you'll be free to travel and be merry. You said it yourself, Magnussen thinks that you'll do whatever to get the better of Sherlock Holmes, so once you're dead, he'll turn the other way."
Sebastian took a step back and sat down on the bed, hanging his head. His shoulders were shaking ever so slightly, and all Jim wanted to do was reach out and hold him, tell him he was staying... He suddenly looked up, and there were tears in his eyes as well. "Come away with me. Fuck Magnussen, fuck Sherlock Holmes, John Watson, all of that shit. We'll pack up and we'll just go. Anywhere, I don't care where, but we'll go somewhere else, and we won't have to do this anymore." He seemed to be almost pleading with the consulting criminal. He sounded so broken, so terrified for the first time since he and Jim had met. It was terrifying.
It wasn't exactly much to go on, but it was a start. The doctor began to search the flat, searching rooms, searching around on the floor, but eventually came up short. There was nothing. Sherlock's stuff was covering the table space as it always was, fingers in jars, a few eyes, some other random appendages that he was often experimenting on. John couldn't help but sigh as he looked at them.
After coming up short in the kitchen and dining room, he decided to check the detective's bedroom. He hadn't been in Sherlock's room for ages. It was possibly the cleanest part of the house, except for the occasional algae experiment or the smell of chemicals. Sometimes, having a chemist for a flatmate was a bit... Grueling, but he managed. Some nights he even missed it.
John smiled down at him, then pressed a kiss to the tip of his nose. "Come on, you. Your daughter needs you."
John sighed. "Okay, answer me this. What were you going to say? Right before you got on the plane, you said you had to tell me something, and then you made a joke, and left, but you and I both know that that wasn't it. So, tell me, what did you really want to tell me?"
and he couldn't stop it. What if John was next? What if he never knew? Who would tell him? He would just keep on living with Mary, he would cry and mourn and grieve all over again, for the third time over
"Bassy, you forget, Sherlock has his own strapping soldier boy." Dana said. "Johnny-boy's a tough little cupcake."
Sherlock tenses, then pulls away, and looks up at him with questioning eyes. "You're lying. You didn't sleep at all." He deduces, his glossy baritone voice becoming strained, like it always does when he figures out something he doesn't like.
Greg ignored her question, and waved her away, turning around to meet her concerned eyes. "Go get John and Sherlock on the phone. Do it
"You made that mistake, Mary, not me." She replied softly. "Put the gun on the floor, and step away."
The doctor threw the file in his hand on the table in front of his friend, not really caring that all of the paper inside it had gone all over the place. He'd care about messes once they found Sherlock. "For one, I know that my wife is a murderous animal, but I already knew that. Now she's trying to kill him again, only this time, she might actually fucking succeed." John shouted before turning around and punching the wall next to him hard enough to split the skin on two of his knuckles and dent the drywall.
Sherlock didn't remember arriving home, but the next thing he knew, he was lying in his bed with Lestrade sleeping in a chair in the corner. Mrs. Hudson was sitting beside him, rubbing calming circles into his back while he slept. Her eyes were red and puffy, and it only took Sherlock a fraction of a second to deduce that his brother had informed her of what had occurred back in America. She didn't say a word to him. It was her loving look that broke him. The loving look from the woman who was more like a mother to him than even his own mother was the one that finally broke Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock looks confused. "I deduced that early on, yet you never dated a man all throughout our friendship, and it was evident even when me first met that you hadn't in a while. Why did you stop dating men?"
The detective watched as his friend faltered. He didn't even realize that John was gripping both of his arms, and was now dangerously close to his face. He watched as his hard expression fell, and was replaced by nothing but sheer emotion
He made his way around the bed, and made his way to the bathroom to brush his teeth. He scowled slightly at the sight of how unruly his hair looked, but the moment he thought back to the events of the night, and suddenly, he didn't mind so much. He brushed his teeth and pulled his pair of pajama bottoms back on, just so he could feel a little more decent, not that his partner cared.
The American laughed breathlessly and bitterly at John's remark, and dropped his head. "I won't go to prison, Dr. Watson." He whispered. He pulled the gun out of his lap, and aimed it right at one of the barrels, sending a spark of terror through Sherlock's body. "I'll die first."
"Not even that, really, just..." John's voice trails off, and he sighs. "I'm old, Sherlock. That's the truth of it. I'm old, and getting older every day, and it's getting harder and harder to explain that I
The hesitation was longer this time, but finally, Sherlock cleared his throat. "I love you too, John." He replied so quietly, it was hard to hear.
When they pulled away from one another, Sherlock watched as John released his hand, and gave him a pained smile. "I'll come home. Just leave a light on."
John only tightened his grip. "Sherlock Holmes, you are so smart, and I need you to use that big brain of yours. You can tell if a person is lying just by the way they're standing, and I need you to look me in the eye, and tell me that I'm lying."
"We'll work it out." John didn't even let him finish the thought. "One way or another, we'll work it out. Mycroft can make himself useful." He slowly closed the distance between himself and Sherlock, with his arms slightly outstretched, like he were approaching a frightened child on one of their cases. "If you'll have me, though, I want to come back to you."
So, when the doctors released him, Greg took him to the airport where he sat on a private plane that belonged to Mycroft, utterly silent, and then stayed the entire drive back to Baker St. The DI drove them back to the flat, and the whole time, Greg Lestrade had his hand on Sherlock's arm, occasionally giving it a light squeeze whenever Sherlock jumped.
Sherlock straightened himself up, and got to his feet to leave, but hesitated when his gaze dropped to the letter on the table. He picked it up once again and read it over, smiling down at the purple ink that stared back up at him. He wasn't exactly sure why he was smiling, but for whatever reason it was, he didn't question it. He thought about that mad woman who brought them together, and shook his head.
Later that night, with the lights out and John once again spooning him up from behind, Sherlock feels an odd bout of bravery, and so asks,
“Because it’s hardly as if I can make it across the room in this state, let alone out of the flat to--”
“What were you going to say?” he is still petting Sherlock’s hair, the side of his face. Sherlock turns into John’s palm where it has come to rest on his cheek.
. Untouched by the wretched thing making a misery of Sherlock’s life. Feeding on his life force from inside his own head. This alone remains pristine in all it’s colors, smells, and sensations. Perhaps it is because Sherlock never allows himself to look. Whenever they are together in this way, it is always John’s front to Sherlock’s back. He can hear, feel, smell, John. But cannot see him. Perhaps this is their saving grace.
That’s what the nightmare had been about. About John leaving. Not Sherlock. Not the flat, even. Simply Sherlock’s bed. And that had caused Sherlock to panic in such a way that it had brought him to consciousness, gasping for air, for comfort,
“Wait, hang on!” John marches over, ripping Sherlock’s phone from his fingers. “You are not getting anyone else to buy your drugs for you either.”
“Hmmm.” Sherlock routes around for his box containing individually packaged sterile needles. He finds it under a pizza box and opens it up, fishing out a needle and ripping the packaging open. “Now, where’s the cocaine.” he wraps a band around his arm as he waits for a reply. “Wiggins?”
Sherlock jolts awake. He’s not in his flat. He’s in some dingy meth den, by the looks of it. He turns to the side of the mat he’s sleeping on and sees Wiggins working at a table covered with vials upon vials, and equipment all used for one very delicious purpose.
“I’m going to go make breakfast.” he says, squeezing Sherlock’s shoulder as he lets go of him. “Want anything in particular?” he asks over his shoulder as he heads into the kitchen.
Weeks go by in this fashion, one puzzle after another. It’s a distraction. There is no exaltation or elation of the soul. Sherlock’s lethargy had worn off, but his world still remained in varying shades of grey. Even taste had become muted. Smell becoming a blur of sameness. Everything swirling together in a humdrum mix of apathy and agony.
“That’s not… “ Sherlock trails off. Swallows again. Nods. “Yes.” he says breathlessly. “A hug is… fine. S’fine.” He shakes his head several times, trying to clear it. Was this a fever-dream? Had he taken drugs at some point today and simply forgotten?
Sherlock can tell that John is on edge. He checks his watch supertiously and finds he’s been incapacitated for nearly forty-five minutes.
Sherlock thinks of spending the rest of the day in bed, but eventually decides against it. Without drugs in his system, the next best thing is to try and wrangle a case free from Lestrade’s grasp. Something over a seven. And then he’ll get another case, and then another. If he gets enough cases in a row he can forget about the fact that his heart is breaking.
“Forget it,” John smiles at him once his eyes have made it back to Sherlock’s face, “Just feel the music, or whatever.”
“No I’m not using again!” Sherlock does snarl this time, “I’ve wanted to! But I don’t. Not anymore. Not since—“
John turns around to fully face Sherlock’s back, and Sherlock draws in a sudden breath and snaps his head forward once more. Those eyes of his are so overstimulating. It is the unmaking of Sherlock and he knows it.
“No, Sherlock. Not good. Ruining thirty kids Christmas’ is pretty ‘not good’.” John told the pavement, refusing to look at his flatmate.
People turned their heads to look at the mad man shouting about Santa, but did not try to stop the obviously intoxicated Father Christmas, nor did they move out of the way as Sherlock and John rapidly approached.
Sherlock just curls up more, hugs himself harder, feels himself begin to shake with what has nothing to do with being cold and wet, and everything to do with the storm raging on inside him.
John Watson could be a menace when he wanted to. And he could be oh so wrong about an astonishing amount of things... So why did Sherlock feel like crying?
“S’not ready yet.” Wiggins rolls his chair to the far side of the table. “Here, take this.” he separates some fine powder from a large pile into a not-so-thin line.
Come morning time, Sherlock will tell himself it was nothing but a dream. Straight men do not, as a rule, enter into relationships with gay men. Or did John think he meant… a what? Platonic relationship? Wasn’t that just called friends? Hadn't they already established that that’s what they were?! And so Sherlock will bury himself in the morning newspaper and refuse to make eye-contact with John. Even though he will be supremely aware of John’s eyes being a near constant presence on him.
The cab ride back to Baker Street is quiet; Sherlock hunched up against the door, head pressed against the glass as he looks out the window; John on the other side of the cab, shooting Sherlock worried looks.
“Bloody hell, Sherlock. Do you have the window open?” John asked, rubbing his arms and shivering as he approached his madman, who perched on a windowsill, head stuck out said window. The living room was dark, and Sherlock was outlined by the orange-gone-pink streetlamps.
They lay in a heap on the floor from where they’d landed afterwards. Sherlock is soaked, John too, a little. Odd. Sherlock had only been thinking about it, he hadn’t actually intended to—
He sits up on the side of the bed and then just stares at his wardrobe for a while. Feeling broken and defeated, in a way that has nothing to do with his recent drugs binge. He already feels the impulse to ring up Wiggins. He’ll give it a few weeks, at least. Knowing Lestrade won’t give him a case if he tests positive for anything. And annoying aware that John and Mycroft would’ve told him about this latest relapse.
“I’m not going anywhere unless you’re coming with me.” John says in a voice that is at once fierce and soft.
“Right! Got it!” John rushed forward and together he and Sherlock got Santa’s hands behind his back, Sherlock cuffing the man with the cuffs John handed over.
“No, I know,” John shakes his head against Sherlock’s back, sniffs again and raises his head so his nose is directly behind Sherlock’s ear, “I know you can’t help it. When you get like this.”
“Morning.” he says brightly, folding up the newspaper and setting it on the tiny end table next to him. “Tea?” he asks, already getting up to go make it.
Thank God. Sherlock doesn’t think he’d be able to stomach John starting in on the questions just this moment--or ever, if he is being truly honest with himself. But he knows John will ask his questions at some point, for he can feel the need for answers burning in John, radiating outward from his chest and warming Sherlock’s back with it’s hateful heat from where they are pressed together.
Sherlock wakes to an empty bed. There’s an instant crushing sensation in his chest, and so he closes his eyes, tries to get himself under control.
Sherlock supposes he’d been through this enough times with the rest of the lot to have expected this, though he was always shocked anew each time. But... John had never seen him through a relapse before. Or a detox. And yet here he was. Still by Sherlock’s side. Still, to the supreme shock of Sherlock, sleeping in his bed with him. Sherlock had never got such powerful, deep, or frequent, sleep in his life. He was compelled to bed each night by the promise of John’s warm embrace. By his accepting presence.
They sit, staring at each other. Sherlock in his chair, and John in his own. In front of the fire that John had felt compelled to build in the fireplace when Sherlock had first sat down but made no motion to speak. They also had a finger of whiskey each, another compulsion of John’s when Sherlock had continued his silence past the twenty minute mark.
always be the one to answer these questions first?” he turns his glare to John. “Remember what I said about taking responsibility?” he raises a brow.
.” Sherlock says more forcefully. “Not what--what I was going to say.” he tries to control his stammering, but his body shakes so intensely it’s making his teeth chatter.
“Yes, well... “ Sherlock clears his perpetually blocked throat. “This sort of thing… I mean… Is it… okay?” Sherlock shakes his head at his own stupidity. '
The cigarettes were the only thing lifting his spirits—the slight amount that they were—and he knew in his heart of hearts, that if he’d been given the opportunity for anything harder, he would have taken it without a second thought. Luckily or not, his lethargy has kept him from venturing out and doing so.
“Get tha fook off me!” The Santa shouted as Sherlock wrestled with him to the ground. “I’ll fookin’ kill ya!”
John awoke, sleep-slowed arm reaching for the Sherlock he thought he was sure to find. When he was met by nothing but empty, cold sheets, he groggily blinked awake, lifted his head and looked about the room.
too much. It’s not as though he were being unsafe. Nothing that stupid. It’s just… sometimes it’s hard to measure out the correct doses when you’ve been on a drug binge for a few days. Though he knows he managed to make a list. It’s in his breast-pocket. So it can’t have been all that bad if he managed to write it down first… Right?
Sherlock wants to tell John all these things, from how nice his hand feels, to the stories behind every imperfection on his own. Instead he allows John to pull him to his feet.
.” Sherlock barely manages to force out. The word issued in a gust of air as if he’d just had all the wind knocked from him.
And I was listening to 'Friday I'm In Love' by The Cure when I wrote the end. Def give that last song a listen if you haven't already. The lyrics are very Johnlock, and very perfect for this particular fic.
“J-John?” Sherlock asks, body shaking so fiercely that it rattles his chest, shakes the words as they come out of him.
His phone is laying next to his head, however. Sherlock reaches an arm up to grab it, socking himself square in the eye on the first attempt, but eventually managing to maneuver his limb correctly and grab the damned thing. Best to send a text to Mycroft. Just in case.
Now that he thinks of it, perhaps... ? But, no. He didn’t have the energy for it. If he started puking out the window he’d probably just fall right out of it. Down onto the hard, unforgiving pavement. Down until he hit the end of his life...
John just shakes his head in Sherlock’s periphery, and then rubs Sherlock’s back as he tosses up into the toilet once more.
“Then what was it that I just saw, hmm? What happened to you, just now, when you checked yourself out for
He’s been awake for seventy-four hours. They’d solved the case five hours ago. Ever since Sherlock has been sitting on his hotel bed, staring at the blank wall across from him.
It’s four in the morning before John wanders into the sitting room. He rubs at his eyes and peers into the mostly dark room before his eyes land on Sherlock sitting in front of his microscope, watching the magnificent chemical reaction the instrument allows him to observe. Though he’s still very  aware of John’s presence. Almost as if he’d known it all his life.
“Oh,” Sherlock chuckles at the zapping sensation of the action. He suddenly feels much more inebriated. “Oh, this s’nice, isnnitt?” He smiles to himself. “I’ll just tell tha’
“Yes, thank you,” Sherlock’s voice sounds as wispy as his constitution. He clears his throat and gives a baritone, “Thank you, John.”
And though John had said it many times that night before he’d finally succumbed to his exertions, Sherlock hadn’t been able to respond, too caught up in the sweet rapture and newness of everything. He thinks, now that John is asleep, he may just be able to say it. Speak the words aloud. For the first time in his life. To anyone.
“W--Wi--” Sherlock tries to call out for Wiggins, but the music is far too loud, even if he could manage to say the man’s name.
“NO!” Sherlock’s breaths punch in and out of him faster and faster as he panics more and more. “Who are you!? No, stay away!” he takes a deep breath to scream, “WIGGINS!” he calls out. What was the point of coming here if Wiggins was just going to let random men come in and have their way with Sherlock while he was incapacitated? WHAT WAS THE POINT?!
Sherlock’s eyes did that thing where John could see the absurd amount of thoughts whirring past them, as if they were one of those old microfilm readers that used to make John seasick back in school. They let him have a glimpse into Sherlock’s mind palace. Among the flickers of emotion that John was able grasp before they passed by, wonder and shock seemed the most prevalent.
. How dare John stump him? HIM, Sherlock Holmes! The world’s greatest Consulting Detective. No, the world’s
John pretended to think it over. “That would be quite mad, wouldn’t it?” he looked up at Sherlock, smiled. “I’m actually starving. Where were you thinking?”
“Oh, GOD!” Sherlock shouts in frustration, slamming his skull down, perhaps a little too hard, on the desk.
“No problem, yeah,” John waves his thanks off, sitting back down but leaving the journal abandoned, elbows on his knees as he leans forward, hands clasped together, “You sure you’re alright?”
Sherlock doesn’t turn around to acknowledge he’s heard John, or say anything in return, but he does tilt is head, ever so slightly to the side. He is listening, to whatever John has to say.
The door to the flat opens, John comes in, talking about how silly it was for him to forget his umbrella. That you’d think after five days he’d get the hint. Sherlock knows the exact moment he notices him because he stops his mundane rambling.
“Try what, exactly?” Sherlock’s eyes narrow in suspicion as John walks past him and straight to the coffee table, pushing it out of the way along with the two living chairs facing the couch, clearing a large space in the center of the room.
“Yes, Love.” The petting continues as Sherlock releases the hand. It’s brushing away tears that Sherlock wasn’t aware he’d shed.
“You talking now?” John asks, raising his head up a bit, neck creaking audibly, so he can get a look at Sherlock’s face.
It isn’t a big thing, and it isn’t violent in the slightest. Just a casual grab on the arm to halt Sherlock’s retreat. But Sherlock feels all the anxious energy leave him in a flash. In fact, all sensation, all his senses, are immediately dampened, gone cold, and underwater, floating up, and barely holding onto his physical form, just by the bite of nails into his palm.
There’s silence. Sherlock can hear each of John’s breaths as they come and go. He has the breathing cadence he gets when he’s thinking.
At the door John finally releases Sherlock and goes for his bed, pulling back the blanket and sheet, as if this were some posh hotel and John was a merry maid.
Like a bird leaving offerings to a potential mate, or a pagan leaving offerings to a God, John continues to bring Sherlock things, attempting to change his black mood.
“At least pretend to focus, Love.” John coughs, eyeing the crime-scene techs who were shooting them dirty looks.
“ he says it in such a way as to let Sherlock know just how he was humouring him. “And you looked...”
“Hmm? No.” Sherlock answers, shaking his head. He needs to get himself under control. That’s the third time in the past two hours that he’d been caught staring at John. And it was only just now turning eleven in the morning.
“I’d like to take you to bed every night. Hold you ‘til you fall asleep. Be there when you wake up.”
“Then yes, of course,” he breathes out, leans back, apparently able to see Sherlock’s face even though Sherlock can’t see his. “Of course this can stay. I can stay.
“What, snort it?” though Sherlock is already rolling up his sleeves and pushing his greasy hair back.
John’s mouth drops open in disbelief, he shakes his head before, “Nothing,” he sits back in his chair, grabs the newspaper and fluffs it out, “Nothing. At. All.”
“Just, I…” Sherlock doesn’t know how to say it without saying it. Oh how he wished he had that capacity to make subtle implications and sub-textual references, the way John and so many other people seem to have. Then he could allude to this. Then it wouldn’t be so damned difficult. “You… do realize I’m a homosexual?”
“So,” he starts, decides he needs another drink, polishing off his glass. He finally meets Sherlock’s eyes. “Let’s talk.”
But Sherlock doesn’t want to ‘just try it’. He wants to meditatively walk this room in a circle until he’s worn a path in the rug. He turns to leave, and that’s when it happens.
Must be Wiggins. His paranoia had him jumping through windows only all too often. At least they're on the first floor, this time. Sherlock will deal with this later. Hopefully he won’t have to though. Wiggins is fairly self sufficient. That’s why he likes him. That and the drugs.
‘Damn my brain!’ Sherlock curses, ‘Function within stated parameters or cease to function entirely!’ He threatens himself.
The hand that had gripped Sherlock’s arm moves to his back, caressing. Touched starved as he was, it was this he craved from Seb. That and the drugs. With Seb it was a package deal. He’d fuck you, even hold you afterwards, all as long as you were willing to chase oblivion with him. Sherlock was never one to turn down a good chase.
“It’s alright, Love. It’s alright. Shh, shhh. That’s it. You’re awake now. S’alright.” John is brushing the sweat-matted hair away from Sherlock’s forehead, petting his face and hair. Shushing him and soothing him until Sherlock finally begins to settle.
He takes a deep breath, looking at his room cast in the early grey of morning light. He doesn’t know what this means, having John spend the night in his bed, cradling him, caring for him. He doesn’t know what it means. But he does know how he feels about it. And that he doesn’t want it to stop.
“Because, there’s the kick when you first snort it, and then all you want to do afterwards is to sit down and ponder on things for a while.”
Lestrade had called after them, but they’d ignored him. They knew this song and dance. Knew they’d just come in tomorrow morning and fill out their reports. It was just a habit of Lestrade’s to insist they immediately come down to the Yard after they finished a case.
Sherlock had been waiting for this--John and him together in this way--to become mixed and blurred with the grey sameness of everything else. But this alone had stayed his.
The sun had set hours ago and the flat had gone dark with its loss. The only light available was whatever happened to filter in from the windows. Regardless, Sherlock turns his face into the carpet. Inexplicably not wanting to be seen by the man he was perfectly fine being held by.
“It means, Sherlock.” he takes a deep breath, leans forward again. “That I would like to take you out. On dates.”
John ducked his head back in, absolutely freezing, but unable to suppress the laughter at Sherlock dusting off the snowflakes that must now be coating his own hair.
Sherlock takes the straw with a put upon sigh, though he’s already thrilling in the idea of whatever this is and how it will feel once it meets his blood/brain barrier.
Before John could ask if they could please shut the window so they wouldn’t freeze to death, Sherlock dropped his head down and pressed his lips to John’s in a sweet kiss.
Sherlock opens his eyes but the figure he sees won’t stay put long enough for him to deduce a thing, and maybe there’s actually three figures, not just the one. Though who can really tell?
John loved that photo; a confused and red-eyed Sherlock--from the camera flash, not drugs (thank God)--arms full of Chinese takeout and that hat clumsily balanced on his head. It ended up framed and on the wall above the fireplace. Even all these years later, John will be walking, or pacing, in front of the fire, and see that picture. And for a moment he’ll be filled with memories of Sherlock tackling Santa, of that stupid hat--which they still have somewhere--and the rest of that night. He'd remember how they’d zoned out together on bad telly and good Chinese food. How they’d ended up falling asleep and waking up snug as a bug, wrapped up around each other. How they’d had their first kiss, complete with morning breath and Mrs. H interrupting them as things got heated. John would remember all that, and it would bring a smile to his face. It was, to this day, his favorite picture of Sherlock. And he was pretty sure it always would be.
“Because!” He shouts, throwing his arms up, “I’m bored!” Sherlock lifts himself up so that he is sitting on the back of his seat, feet where is arse should be, “You say you’ve been paying attention,” Sherlock has a dark, judgmental smile, “But I have told you time and time again—“
As John handled the still kicking and spitting Santa, Sherlock stood up, suavely dusting off his coat, and then noticed the small audience that had gathered.
The first thing he notices is that sound is back on—a fire truck races by, birds sing from somewhere, and the everyday white noise of Baker Street floats in from the open window.
Most of that went over the kids heads, parents too. But the part about Santa being a lie and Christmas being 'bad' seemed to stick.
. Would not give his body the satisfaction of knowing it had broken him. So he doesn’t. But his breaths do become ragged, his shoulders hitch up and down in a jilted way. But he doesn’t cry.
Sherlock breathes in the scent of John’s hair, holding him tighter. John makes a small sound in his sleep, but just nuzzles closer. Sherlock has never felt like this before. So free yet so grounded. So light and energized yet so bone tired and heavy. He’s satisfied beyond measure, in every possible way. He can’t imagine a world where he might need drugs when he has
Sherlock shuts himself inside his tiny bedroom and proceeds to collapse on top of his bed. He lays there, face flat on the duvet, for what could have been either hours or minutes, before crawling up the bed a bit and turning on his side, curling up on himself in the fetal position.
As often happens, a drastic upswing follows Sherlock’s downed spirits. One day he wakes, revitalized and energized. Almost uncomfortably so. As if he is hooked up to some machine, being shocked, sparks zinging out across his nervous system, setting him alight.
With one last contented sigh, Sherlock feels himself being pulled under into the realm of dreams. Tomorrow will be a new day. Filled with tea and newspapers. Cases and John. And even
It’s not as if he hadn’t been expecting this, over the last few days as his constitution improved. John was just sticking around out of some Doctorly duty. Sherlock had finally pushed him too far this time. Finally showed John his full hand. And John was disturbed, disgusted. John wanted to leave. And so he finally had.
it was forty-five minutes. I was keeping time, you know—But that’s not—That’s not the point, Sherlock.”
Sherlock has to do a double take as he was certain John had gone out to get milk just moments before. That was the point of the skull, wasn’t it? For someone to talk to while John was out. Oh! No, it wasn’t. It was someone to talk to because he refused to talk to John. That was it.
John shrugs again, both his shoulders and his lower lip. His grip on his glass tightens. “Kind of teetering on the line, I think.”
“He’s trying to shake us off in the crowd of other Santas!” Sherlock was already running towards the brightly colored, flashing lights of ‘Christmas Town’--or so said the poorly hung up sign.
Sherlock stares up at the ceiling, laid out spread eagle and feeling a lovely sluggishness pulse through his veins, enveloping him in a warm, comforting embrace. Though all he can manage to ‘ponder’ on is John. Where he’s at. If he’s worried about him. If he’s mad at him. This won’t do
Sherlock doesn’t remember the trek to his room. Nor does he remember falling asleep. But he does remember waking up, warm in his own bed. Warmer for the body pressed up behind him. And warmer still for the peace beating within his heart.
Suddenly, a hand on his shoulder, not making to pull Sherlock to face him, but just resting, just testing out this new territory. When Sherlock doesn’t make to buck him off, John scoots closer, crowding in behind him and wrapping an arm around Sherlock’s side.
Sherlock can’t fathom the need for sex when he can’t feel the majority of his body, but he knows that tone and the look Sebastian’s giving him. He sighs internally before nodding as much as Seb’s hold on him will allow.
They decided against a cab, as the mall wasn’t too far off from Baker Street--and isn’t that just lovely? Seeing as they’d both received a lifetime ban from the place. The silence lasted a good ten minutes into their walk home when Sherlock couldn’t contain himself anymore.
He can hear the springs of John’s own hotel bed creak as he lifts himself off them. Then he can feel the bed dip as John joins Sherlock on his. It is not long before that now familiar warm presence is behind him once more. The only balm he’d found to comfort his soul.
“NEARLY an hour, unresponsive--And the thing is, Sherlock, it’s not how you usually get when you go into your mind-palace.”
“Do you want to be?” comes the immediate reply, though he’d hoped John was asleep, even though he knew he wasn’t.
“Shit, sorry!” John exclaims, his heart pounding in his chest. He turns his head quickly, trying to see whether Sherlock is nearby. To his luck, the detective is still in the back of the shop, having an enthusiastic conversation with another customer about the ‘belt’ John had picked up earlier.
Each and every comment left as we all took this journey together left Tad and I grinning. We'd screenshot comments and do the internet equivalent of poking each other to make the other read comments that tickled us.
He wanted to be with John. That was a fact. They worked well together on cases — John was smart and clever enough to keep up with Sherlock. Attractive and brave; confident and brilliant in bed. There was more. There was always more. He shifted on the sofa as he let his thoughts race, and finally, it struck him.
“Look,” he started over. “Let’s not do this here, right? I’m sorry about not correcting the server. No need to have that ruin our night.”
“No,” Sherlock snaps as he lifts himself up to his full height and glowers at John. “You are not about to take this away from me because...you got wrapped up in the moment!”
John sighs but agrees, bringing his free hand up to trace outlines across Sherlock’s chest. They should clean up, but he doesn’t want to move — doesn’t want to ruin this slice of peace, a fragment of what they’d had before. It feels so easy like this. Here, they know exactly how to talk to each other, how to ask for what they want and give in return. Why had they even broken up? He can’t remember. If every time was like that;
Sherlock turns his sketchpad over wordlessly, revealing the rough form of a figure, sitting on the sofa, holding a newspaper.
Sherlock let out a long and loud giggle that he knew wouldn't be possible unless he was very close to several sheets into the proverbial wind. John's easy-going charm and steely confidence were absolutely knocking down his defences, but his superbly dry yet decadent wit would be what made Sherlock crumble completely.
“No, but you’re a scientist, Sherlock. If anyone can create the scent of John Watson, it is yourself.”
Sherlock needed more wine to make it through yet another one of these ridiculous dates set up by Molly. She had promised that this one was intelligent enough to at least keep up a general conversation. Ted was much older than Sherlock went for but handsome and a highly skilled lawyer. Unfortunately, though, Ted also asked way too many questions.
Sherlock sighed, stood up from the corpse and swivelled around. His magnifying glass snapped closed, the echo of it ricocheting around the morgue. The DI and Molly's faces stared back at him as if they had just recalled where they were.
John sinks forwards, resting his forehead against the polished wood. He’d almost forgotten. For three glorious hours, he had convinced himself that nothing had changed, that the detective at home was still his.
“Sherlock,” John says, his voice strong and commanding enough to cut through the shouts. “Calm down.“
Irene punctuates her question with a simple raised eyebrow, and Molly cry-laughs again. This type of reaction is becoming quite a habit.
“What is it?” John continued, then giggled at the puzzled look that Sherlock gave. “The cologne, I mean. Is it from a particular store?”
The higher functions of Sherlock’s mental capabilities want to complain about being treated like he can’t manage the simplest of tasks. However, the scent of John is everywhere and him straddling Sherlock’s hips is beyond cheating.
