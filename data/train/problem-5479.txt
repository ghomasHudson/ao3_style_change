“Maybe some day you can come down to my workshop and I can show how it really works,” Tony says and then begins to steer the ship toward the tiered port again.
He smiled, but then it dropped. Maybe he just wasn’t brave enough. “I don’t think I can do that. It isn’t me.”
Shaking out his hand, he thanks Bucky for the lessons and watches as spurts of blood run down Rumlow’s face.
Maybe that’s the reason that Tony doesn’t waste any more time. Or maybe it is his upcoming urgency that’s hitting him with exceptional fervor. All he knows is that he pulls open his trousers and releases his heavy cock with a groan. It takes nothing at all to slide into place, pushing hard into the omega’s entrance. The omega halts his movements, stiffens. But Tony goads him along with a few nasty tugs on his willing erection, supplying a fingernail to the tip of his erection – enough to hurt a willing sub and have him cascade into pleasure. The omega cries out and begins thrusting in earnest which is all the encouragement that Tony needs. He rams up and into the omega, heated and hungry for release. It’s messy and awkward, but the angle is right with the omega tied to the spread bar in a slightly bent position.
With a quick gliding motion, Steve thrusts in and the feeling nearly sends him into shock. It’s so tight and so strong and he’s over the moon with need that he swoons a little before he’s able to get his head wrapped around the sensation. “Oh baby, sweet one, you feel divine. You feel so tight, so powerful.” He stays motionless and tears streak Tony’s face.
He’s at the door to the room before he knows what to say. As he enters, the doctor moves away from the single cot to reveal Bucky, sitting up, fevered and drained.
Steve embraces Tony, kissing his pulse point on his throat and then up toward his jaw and finally his lips. He breaks away. “I won’t. I’m sorry. I’m here for you.” He finds he doesn’t like the pain streaking through Tony’s features.
“And he is dead, but not here. Why is that?” Heimdall asks and then points to them. “And who are these waifs. I have told you I cannot take them with me. I cannot even take you, my queen. You are beings of a different substance than I.” Heimdall sizes them up and then points his sword at Steve’s chest. “He’s a new one of your lost puppies.”
Steve pauses the playback again and tries to settle his stress panting. “Fuck.” What if Sam says something about Steve? Bucky will find out. There’s no two ways around it. He needs to take the bull by the horns and come clean to Bucky. “How do you say to your friend, oh by the way Bucky, I’m a whore now?”
Before she can answer, JARVIS chimes in, “Mer Rogers, you asked to be alerted to the time. It is one hour and a quarter until you are to meet Prince Anthony for dinner. He is running on schedule tonight. I expect he will be there on time.”
“That’s my boy. None of that baby crap with that stuffed animal you insist on dragging around. This is my boy. You’ll figure it out. I’m sure. Maybe someday you’ll even figure out how to miniaturize the arc reactor!” Howard smiled. Even with the sharp jab, Tony beamed at Howard’s words. It was so rare to receive a compliment from his father.  Howard cupped his hand around Tony’s shoulder. “Maybe next time I go to the Arctic Ocean to search for Cap’s plane you can come with me. Just the two of us. Father and son.”
A pitched cry shuddered through the bond, but Tony couldn’t discern its origin. Even as he heard the click of the rifle the sky around them flashed with lightning and thunder roared. A blast of red fire hit the Hydra goons and Bucky was momentarily caught off guard. The twins circled one another both taking out the guards and keeping Tony at bay. The leak of the memories assaulted Tony again, and he stumbled back, getting in front of Bucky. The memories of all the deaths, the looks of fear, the intensity of murder. It bled through the bonds as if Barnes gushed from wounds deep and deadly.
How much did he just fuck that up? Tony drops onto the bed, which he shouldn’t do. He’s messing up his clothes and he doesn’t give a shit. He lies down and stares into the blindness. It’s never entirely just black or just white, but shades of gray swirling before his eyes. He used to try and say they were shapes of things and people, but it isn’t. It’s like an ever present after image. It taunts him with hope and gives him nothing but ash in return. The ash burns his throat and weakens his resolve. He’s stronger than this, he knows it. He’s always been a man of action. He’s wanted to present himself that way to the world for all these years. He thinks most of his friends see him that way, he thinks Steve does too.
Steve tries to unburden Tony of his tie, his jacket, his clothes, but Tony stops him. He’s not getting off, not yet, not now. This is for Steve. He wants to show Steve that there’s more to him, there’s more to life, there’s someone who cares about his needs. A flash of the woman across the hall comes to his mind and he thinks – no, he knows that Steve takes care of her and the other one – Clint. For once, Tony is going to take care of Steve.
“What? What the hell?” Tony stops dead in front of Steve. His sightless eyes close and he cocks his ear to listen.
Steve walked up the steps and into the small kitchenette. His hair was a mess and his uniform torn at the shoulder. He tugged off his jacket and went directly to Tony. “You should have called. I gave you a phone.” He eyed Natasha and then examined Tony as if he assessed a wayward child. Tony hated it. Sure, Natasha and Steve had decades on him, but the truth was Tony had been a genius and a billionaire in his day. Sure, not anymore, but still he commanded respect – once.
“Or I can help out,” Bruce said as he entered the small hospital room. Although his eyes showed a weariness, he offered a calming influence by his presence and the vibrations of his soul.
“Not really. My mom read it to me when I was sick. I was a very sick child.” Steve waits, bracing himself for Tony’s anger.
“I don’t get Howard. Yeah, he was a cad when I knew him, but he turned into such a-.” Steve stops like he’s at a loss for words.
Steven glowers at him. “I don’t lie, my lord. All I can say about the Purge and the omegas there is that they are not saddled with the current political philosophy of the Council of Worlds.”
It is Frigga who stands up and silences him. “Your anger may be justified but tell me what is its worth?” She tilts her head, her long hair falling over her shoulder. “All of us carry anger, but it serves little purpose now. Take it and learn what you must do. What you’ve been made to do, Captain Rogers.”
“He needs you,” Strange says. “You need to come with us. Ms. Potts knows this now. Come. His speech is soon, and the crowds are dying down outside.” He nods to the entrance way where the people have drifted away. The paparazzi aren’t manning their stations.  “That means they’re seating soon for the dinner.”
“You’re telling me that since you had this soul bond thing all your dreams are realistic?” Sam furrowed his brows and studied Steve; just by the look on his face Steve knew that Sam had an inkling that wasn’t the endpoint.
Their embrace aches through Steve and he stops a sob from escaping. “We’ve never had enough time. We never had enough sense to know better. To be together.”
“Oh they’re gonna try,” Rumlow moans. “Oh sweet Jesus, you feel so tight, tighter than a goddamned virgin. Must be the fucking serum. You should have stayed with SHIELD. You should have -.” Rumlow speeds up as he fucks Steve. The wet slap reverberates. “You should have stayed. Wouldn’t be a whore then, would you? We left you nothing. You got nothing left.” He laughs through a groan. “I follow you around from one city to the next and stop everything you try to do. But this, this I ain’t stopping. You gonna let us fuck you.”
“That’s putting it nicely and, I was lucky, I had a gal that sent food and supplies. Prisoners that had family to help out ended up better than the others,” Steve says, trying to ignore the memories of the Raiders and how they’d extorted what they wanted.
Tony grasps Steve to his chest, holding him tight. In days gone by Steve would have struggled away from a demon’s touch. He would have fought with all the strength of the righteousness imparted in him by the Soul Keeper’s binding. Yet now, as he feels something familiar and comforting about Tony, Steve allows himself to be held. It steadies him, gives him strength to combat the internal battle and break away from the viper snaking its way into the confines of his soul. He shudders and a moan escapes him, but he sags into Tony’s embrace, safe.
“Sorry, Potts, but you have to go.” Natasha wasn’t taking any protests. Pepper only nodded and clasped Tony’s shoulders.
“What?” Steve says and wonders if Tony is diagnosing himself. “I know you’re probably in shock because of the cold water. You’re going to freeze to death, both of us are going to freeze to death if I don-.”
Steve takes it and, instead of putting it on the small table in front of him, places it on his lap. “Thank you. Grapes? Cheese? I haven’t had any of these in.” He stops, failing for words.
Tony puts up his hand to stop Wong. “Let’s remember I don’t want anyone not vetted and under a non-disclosure agreement in this room.”
“What school did you go to?” Tony asks as he watches the man slowly move through the presentation suite. It has a miraculous free standing rack and a lounge area. The canopy rack over the bed is a wonder to behold with many upgrades that Tony designed himself. He hasn’t used it much. Usually he pays a drone to fill the need when his urgency strikes. Now he doesn’t need to do that anymore. Something hot and needy curls deep inside of him. To most on the Avenger this is called an urgency cabin or suite, not a presentation suite, though Tony knows he designed it for a future omega. Now he wonders if this decision was the right one. “Your school? Your training?”
Tony waves it off and points to the two dueling assassins. “Well, are you having a drop down or not, because I have other things to do if not?”
They weave their way through the brush, though the path is more distinctive now with their constant trudging of it each day. When they get to their stream – and it’s strange that Tony thinks of it as theirs – he bends down and scoops up some water to drink. Blu crouches and drinks directly from the creek. Tony splashes some of the water on his face and through his greasy hair. A quick dip won’t slow them down much. It shouldn’t take more than a half hour or so to walk to the designated pick up spot.
At that point the knock came for the delivery and they chowed down on it. Steve told stories of his younger days and Tony relished it. It helped in some ways to hear Bucky humanized and not just some instrument of Hydra. The conflict that they were one and the same person plagued Tony, but when he heard of both the bravery and the smart-ass interactions that Steve had with Bucky, Tony’s hatred started to dissolve. He didn’t know if it was a good thing or a bad thing.
The prince touches the blue symbol that almost but doesn’t clash with the rest of the colors. “This is a symbol of the new Stark House. After the war, I’m determined to change the way the Inner and Beyonds interact. This symbol is part of that. It’s a symbol of crossing the galaxy and the Conclave and bringing it together.”
“Hmm. The room’s interface with the implant needs to be turned off. It’s by the fireplace,” Tony doesn’t want to talk right now. It just jogs his head more. At a slow pace Steve leads them back into the living room, telling Tony to step down into the lounge area.
“Yeah.” Steve gives a small laugh. “Actually, one of the ways I died was starving myself. I couldn’t stand it, so I stopped eating. When I came back in perfect health, I figured it was some occurrence due to the serum. It was only later that I figured out it was my experience with the forces behind the tesseract.”
“Your astral projection is linking up with ours. Steve has a pretty organized head, but right now while he’s in pain and being cared for by the doctors here, not so much. That leaves chaos.” A flash of need sparked through the bond as Bruce talked of Steve. Tony wondered if it was the same with all of the pack members; did Bruce feel this way for each of the pack? At the same time the racket running through the bonds made it difficult for Tony to parse who was giving off what signal. Tony recalled the moments after he’d touched Steve, how the triage bay around him swirled with madness. Was it mess of busy people or just the clutter of his own brain?
“Not entirely human,” Shuri replied. “It’s simple on a molecular level. We know now that vampirism is a kind of disease but it isn’t fatal, nor is it undead. When people get the disease their bodies change in reaction to the virus. To something that we cannot truly understand, but I am getting close!” There was a twinkle in her eyes. “Call the vampire state one of metamorphosis. Like a cocoon and a butterfly.”
He can count on the team. The Avengers are there for him. Sam and Natasha are his closest friends. Wanda is like the little sister he never had. Clint like the screwball cousin with the secret wife. He smiles. It’s enough, he tells himself. It has to be enough. The needs of the world supersede the needs and desires of one man. He looks over at Tony whose turned away from the light to sleep.
Steve looks away, grappling to catch hold of the bag before it follows Clint. The backpack slides again, but Steve hooks it with the tip of his fingers and yanks it toward him. That motion only causes him to skid further down the gravel slope.
She’s kind enough to ignore the flush to his cheeks. With a critical eye, she examines the fit, making slight tucks here and there. “The memory nanites will take the measurements and then we’ll have it fabricated for you. It won’t take too long. For your size you have amazing shoulders, so square. And your jawline is absolutely perfect, I can see why Tony’s attracted to you.” She lifts his head to check the collar. “Just make sure to use makeup to hide the hickeys please.”
He turns and notices that Tony looks small, lost, almost abused. He wants to know, has to know. “Yes?”
Strange considered them. “Well that means that you must bring the pack together to strengthen the bonds and to show him the way home – that the pack is his beacon, his center.”
Getting the wings had been child’s play for Natasha, and Steve thought she even enjoyed it a little too much. He felt her celebration through the bond and only suppressed a chuckle as they headed off to find Sitwell. Sam took it all in stride and seemed confident and growing through the bond. During the car rides, Steve and Natasha continued to brief Sam on the Soul Mantra and how to work through the bond, how to control it, how to concentrate, and how to distance it. They also worked on seeking and catching as they liked to call it, where they used the bond to figure out positions and status through a mission. It was harder to do and test in the confines of a car, but they tried their best as they made the final plans to secure Sitwell. Steve knew these were stopgap measures and that he’d have to refer Sam to Wong’s tutelage as soon as possible, but Sam’s mind was lightning quick. He followed the instructions, asked all the right questions, and genuinely settled into being a part of the bond so easily it felt natural. Like he was supposed to be there all the time.
“How long has it been?” Tony asks quietly. “I mean erase the time in the ice. How long has it been since she passed?”
At that point, Tony waltzes out of the bathroom still naked as the day he was born, and Clint only rolls his eyes. “I can hear you rolling your eyes, Clint.”
“You wore them for four hours and 39 minutes,” Pepper whispers as if it hurts her to admit the time.
Steve clears his throat and rubs his hands on his khakis. “Steve Rogers. Captain in the US Army. Four tours abroad -.”
Bucky pressed fingers of his one hand into his eyes and muffled a scream. “God! What the hell did you do to him?”
“I don’t know, it seems pretty close to me,” Steve says but then again, he’s found something he never could capture in life. He shrugs. “Maybe I’m wrong. But I’m glad I ended up here, with you.”
“I’m sorry. About the pack. I mean I wouldn’t have-.” Steve didn’t know how to continue, but Natasha chimed in.
“Only if you become the first, where you want more and more and are never satisfied. All people and vampires alike have these tendencies, but only the depraved ever act on it.” Thor studied him. “You are not depraved. You are growing and maturing.”
“Cho’s not coming. You don’t have enough data on her and the serum to have her walk into the room. She’s never coming. It’s just you and me. Ultron.” Steve clenches his hands.
Walking up the worn steps to the studio apartment always increases his pulse rate until it's nearly a din in his ears. Is it fear or excitement or a little bit of both? He swallows down the rising needs and knows part of the rapidity of his heart -so fast and heavy in his chest -comes from the thoughts of seeing Steve. He hasn't seen him in over two weeks. It's been a long, hot couple of weeks and he's blamed it on the heat as August settles over the city, but he knows he's lying to himself. The scorching heat inside grows and boils his blood because the idea of having Steve, touching Steve, being with Steve overwhelms him.
Tony turned to Bruce who only raised his hands in question. Shaking his head, Tony said, “Okay? Let him up.”
“Calm, calm,” Steve commands. “I’m adding some more lube and another finger.” He adds the warmed lube and slips back inside. It curls something tight in the pit of his groin and this time Steve can’t stop the little cry of need that escapes him.
“Somewhat. About 120 or so parsecs out. We’re lucky that both Doctors Cho and Erskine are here at Prime Station. I have Happy reaching out to Doctor Richards and Strange to find out if they are in any danger.”
The church emptied out but they all stayed silent and waiting. When Steve finally spoke, he said, “Thank you. I didn’t know that was possible.” All the other mourners had left the church, going to the burial.
He shrugged. His thumbs notched in his belt. “Can’t say. Like I said I haven’t been here for all the years the facility has been in operation. I do know that there’s only been one subject for the experiments all the time I’ve been here. That’s o4.”
That was when Steve reached out and held Tony’s hand, bringing it to his lap. He smiled in what Tony could only describe as incredibly dorky and adorable grin.  Throughout the flight, Steve would talk about the team, about Tony’s thoughts about the pack. How to proceed without the support of SHIELD. They fashioned ideas about an Avengers Initiative and how it would run. It was the rare instance that Steve spoke about his feelings. He only mentioned it once, but he did happen to say how much he enjoyed Tony’s company. How he was grateful that Tony was there to support him. None of it was about their bond or their budding romance. Although he tried not to be let down, Tony swallowed his fears and his sense of impending loss. He felt that as soon as they were back in the States, the little dream he had crumbled.
“Finals are tomorrow. I still don’t understand how statistics tell you anything. I mean I can make the incidence ratios work whatever way I want.” Steve throws down his pen. It skids off the desk much to his chagrin. He sighs - dramatically.
Picking out the least exotic soap, Steve washes the plug and the dildo (although he hasn’t used it yet). He scrubs and then asks JARVIS to get water boiling for him. By the time he’s finished the wash, the water’s ready and he sets the plug and dildo in the pot. “Give me eight standard minutes, please.”
Steve dropped the scrubber and hung his head. He waited a moment and through their link, Tony sensed that Steve worked at stilling his temper. In and of itself, that surprised Tony.
“Well, I think you better decide soon, Steven is not stupid. He’ll eat you alive if you let him. You do need to establish the hierarchy if you expect him to follow your orders, if you expect anyone to follow you.” Pep studies him before she adds, “Things are different now. You’re changed. We all are, I think.”
Swiftly, Steve makes his way through the ship’s quarters level. No sign of the Strike Team greets him and he’s inwardly relieved. Rumlow creeps him out. At least, Natasha banned him from the Widow’s Brothel.
JARVIS doesn’t comment on his request any further. “Sir, I’ve studied the topography and geography of your coordinates. Are you able to walk approximately 1.5 kilometers to the south? There is a flat plateau that would be an excellent landing space.”
Strange relents. “Tony only has tonight and then he will lose his sight. The implant will come out and he will not longer have the any access to sight.”
“Maybe. Natasha and Clint could have had a hand it in too,” Bruce said. “It’s not like anyone else gave him anything to do other than deal with the complete displacement he must feel on his own.”
The images of the bottle, what happened filters through his memories and he shivers as he awakens in the embrace of the cradle. The pain shoots through him like a spear driven deep in his heart. He doesn’t want to remember what happened in that room, the shattered face of his friend afterward, the resolution he made – that he would never let Bucky face what happened alone. Not ever.
“How far can you fly in the armor with a passenger?” Steve asks, his words a little breathy due to the heavy winds.
Tony returned Sam’s concerned gaze. “I get it. I’ve been there before, I know how this works.” He lifted a chin to Bucky. “He does too. We can do this. After all, we all love Steve – just in different ways.”
He screamed out a cry and came awake. Panting Steve shuddered and picked up his hand to touch his cheek. All he felt was the warmth of his tears. Tony shuffled awake next to him. He rubbed at his eyes.
Both Tony and Pepper stayed silent. Tony found the washed out surrounding spinning around him, he felt ill for no reason that he could discern. Happy jumped in to ask, “Scrub down?”
“Apparently when I returned to the game, I was in full health.” Once again, Tony responds to something Steve thought. “Good that the nanobots are cold, it will relieve some of the swelling I would think.” Tony sits back. He looks haggard, tired, about to give up.
“God, that’s complicated. And confusing.” Steve pulls out a nice pair of slacks, a polo shirt and clean boxers. He exits the closet with his clothes for the day and his packed bag. “Strange said I can stay at the clinic with Tony. You won’t need to stay. It’ll be about a week or so. You can have the time off.”
“Two lines up and down your back, actually on either side of your back, of puncture wounds. It looks like you’ve been skewered. I can’t figure out if it’s deep. That’s not my specialty. If Yinsen was here-.” He stops and audibly swallows. “But he’s not and you’re stuck with me. Did they capture you trying to save me?”
“Yes.” Steve squeezed his hand. They sat on the riverbank for the rest of the hour as they waited for Natasha and news of the coming storm from America.
“So, Sheriff, I hear you need your horse taken care of?” Stark digs into the meal with not a small amount of appetite. The amount he stuffs away competes with what Steve can haul off and clean up in a sitting.
He nods. She leaves and he feels all of 2 feet tall. When Cho re-enters the room, she accepts his argument to hook him back up. Her face remains impassive, but her eyes show only concern as Tony drifts away.
Steve turns and looks at the beers. “I just.” He rubs at the back of his neck. “I thought maybe we could maybe sit and watch a movie. JARVIS told me you were on your way home.”
Steve weighed the information. He’d thought that the Wikipedia had been some kind of official encyclopedia. He was used to volumes and volumes of a big stately books with gold leaf and leather bindings. Wikipedia sounded weird, but it was a convenient source. Tony had directed him to that site and now Steve considered whether Tony had known that it was an error prone source? Probably, since he used it as a way to throw Steve farther down the primrose path. Predictable. In every way.
“But he’s.” Tony stands up and walks to the window, hands in his pockets. It’s night out. Pepper shouldn’t be working this late. He sees the surrounding areas of the complex, the wide open spaces of the parking lot, the twinkling lamps, the rolling hills leading to the city. Beyond the hills, the amber glow of the city fills the sky and blots out the stars. “He’s a mystery. Like the stars or the ocean. I don’t know if I can ever know him.”
He comes upon the blacksmith’s large barn. Walking through the door, he peers in and the forge is still hot, but the place is fairly quiet. He lets the reins drag so that Shield will stay in place and searches past the empty stalls into the backrooms of the barn. He hears Stark and Banner before he sees them.
“Yeah, sorry I took so long. Thought I would get back sooner.” He thumbs behind him at the rubble of the compound. “Thought I could help out. Seems it’s a bit harder to get across the galaxy than I thought it would be.”
Tony saw the same fierceness, the same determination that always glowed in Captain America’s eyes in a man that – for Tony – was the barest of memories in Steve Rogers’ story but would always be the major player for Steve himself. “I know that you can’t possibly-.” He stopped, looked down at his slender hands – hands that no longer had the strength to fill the role of Captain America. Or so Tony thought. “I can’t ask you to forgive him. I can’t ask you to accept him in the role of Brother for our pack. But I can -.” He swallowed hard, audibly. When he met Tony’s gaze again there were tears in his eyes. “I can release you. You don’t have to be tied to me, to him. You don’t have to feel his soul. Know what he did – in all the details. You don’t. I can consult with Doctor Strange. I’m sure he knows of someone-.”
Steve only side eyed Sam. “I’m not certain I like the idea of having people change their lives for me. Look at what’s happened so far. ” He could go into all that had gone wrong, but the rawness left him empty.
After a moment’s reflection, Steve said, “Sir, if you will. I need an alpha and I don’t think going to the blocks if there are any these days is the best idea.”
“Okay?” The steep descending slope would give the most skillful horseman a test; Steve worries about Tony. He’d like to lead the horses down but with the storm pounding and increasing in intensity, they don’t have that luxury.
He looks up at the screen – at the headshots of the men. He could go to Sam, ask Sam to do this for him. But he can’t. Because he still admits to himself he has hopes. If Steve entangles Sam into this whole mess, then how will he ever get Tony to be with him again? So he has to go to a nameless person. Someone to hurt him, and knot him, and not kiss him and not touch him in any pleasurable way. This is a biological urge and that’s all. When he first when through presentation, Tony explained it as simple as the need to eat, piss, or shit. He has to keep that in mind.
Steve follows Tony’s lead, he doesn’t have any choice and he clears his mind, sinks into the emotions, the heat, and promise of what Tony’s doing to his body. To have another man touch him thrills and scares him. He’s only touched himself, ever. The slightest touch by Tony causes him to groan.
Tony brings the tray over and slides it onto his lap. An array of different foods are laid out including a roast beef sandwich, fries, a large salad, and even a small cup of noodle soup. “Go ahead and chow down. You need the calories.”
Steve manages to get to his feet and across the room before he needs to cling to the bureau. His clothes have been laundered and the shirt that had been the victim of the bullet wound cleaned and stitched up. He shrugs it on, his shoulder achy and protesting. He’s still wobbly on his feet but he gets on underclothes, his pants, a pair of holey socks, and his gun belt. He finds his badge and pins it onto the breast pocket. It still has a nick in it from the bullet but the blood has been washed away.
Stopping her by catching her arm, Steve said, “How else am I going to convince Fury that I’m not a liability?”
Tony frowns and then asks, “Are you asking us to get physical or are your asking for the metaphysical.”
“That’s unlikely, right? He has the ring on his wrist that designates him as a leader. He will eventually find a pack,” Bruce said.
He rested in the cage and mused about the idea of having Tony Stark as his alpha. He smiled deep inside and his gut coiled with pleasure at the thought. The wet slick between his legs smeared with come and he sunk deep into that place a sub/omega dreams about. But then he recalled what Tony had asked him.
Tony nods. “Because of Steven. And he hates me because I beat him for a damned drink.” Sighing, Tony slips away from her and heads down the path toward the Main Conference building. His guests should be there by now. She follows him without a word. When they arrive at the building with its glass atrium and steel girders reaching up to the sky, Tony stops and says, “Tell the attendees I will be in shortly.”
Later, Clint, Steve, and Tony managed to put together a traveling plan after everyone else had cleared out of the common kitchen. Clint told them of a private farm they could use as a good training area. Clint rolled out a map of the residence and showed them an area of fallow ground. “This area here near the woods and the stream is open and not being farmed at the moment. It’s far enough away from the pasture land that the war games won’t really interfere or cause trouble with the grazing animals.”
“That’s the only way to cut off the resonances and stop the entanglement. I know it sounds crazy but the Steve from that other reality is affecting you. If this continues, the God Machine or whatever the fuck it is will destroy you. You. In this reality, not in that other reality. Now. Here. You.” He sucks in a breath because the idea, the picture he’s painting terrifies him.
“Gee, thanks.” He forces himself back up and then starts a fire. The idea of skinning the animals grosses out Tony. “You can have them if you want. I’m not hungry.” His stomach rumbles just to be a dick and betray him. “Not that hungry.”
It takes a few more minutes as Pepper leans in close and speaks to Steve. Tony gets a slight irrational worry that she’s prepping him, getting him ready for the meeting. He doesn’t want that; he wants to discuss everything himself. He starts to get up out of the chair again, but then Pepper turns toward the door and Steve follows. She swings it open, a smile wide on her face. She looks charming and lovely as always.
“What about your boyfriend, Bucky? What? Didn’t want him to beat you until you bled again?” He must regret it, because the look on his face screams defeat.
Steve notices the sallow expression on Tony’s face, but his words are soft and not bitter. “She did. Once. Like I said.” He flips the compass open. “Always was surprised the photograph survived.”
“I know the brothels’ quarter, the concourse where all the shops are, the courts which include the food and entertainment venues. But I don’t know much about most of the station. I only get one day off a week. Most of those days I just hang out at the brothel with my friends.”
“Depends on what you call paradise, doesn’t it?” Tony answered and generally gave off an air of disgust and annoyance.
The music continues in the background, the wistful Auld Lang Syne plays. It seems appropriate to Tony. His mother used to love this song, but he steps away from that memory in his head – he can’t think of her and his guilt that she died that night.
“What’s so funny?” Steve calls from the kitchen – Tony hears the slight echo of his voice off the tiles.
Steve watched as the family accepted them into their home. He scanned the room, saw the trappings of another life, a different life and deep within him the hopes and dreams that he’d smothered as a child resurfaced only to be slowly and painfully unraveled. What he witnessed before him remained elusive, almost foreign to him. He observed all of his team mates speaking to the children, gather like an extended family around Clint. They all were, in a way, since they were pack members. The bond seemed to extend and wrap them into an ancillary role. In some ways, it felt right and good for Clint, for the pack, yet Steve never felt more isolated and different. Slipping out, he went to the porch, stood there for a long moment, and then left. He walked. Just walked into the fields as if he could keep walking until he found what he sought in his heart.
He jerks back to the present as Pepper expresses her concerns. Tony smiles: the thoughts of Steve are soft and sweet, if not a little too painful to dwell upon. “No. He’s not a jerk. He’s everything anyone could ask for, but-.”
The prince lays his head back on the cushions and Steve runs his hands up his thighs sensing the tension strung high throughout his body. A tender caress and he unrolls the condom onto his erection and then Steve holds the prince’s cock to lightly lick at the head, paying special attention to the slit. The prince shivers slightly as if he always holds back, as if he can never relax. If Steve can make the prince release a minimum of his stress, release the tension held in his muscles, then he’ll call it a win. He laves at the cock ignoring the fake black cherry taste and falls into deeply inhaling the musky scent of the prince. He curls his tongue around the heavy erection, using the tip of his tongue to glide and slide almost tickling in its manner. Then he slips his hand toward the prince’s balls, lightly stroking them and bringing them close enough to kiss and inhale.
“Am I?” Steve says and immediately regrets it. She didn’t put him in his current position. He did that all on his own. “Sorry.”
All the guards and Happy depart; the doors whisper closed. Tony, sitting on the bench in front of the piano, stretches out his hand and Steve goes to him – the beckoning call silent in the quietude. The stars outside are distant and lovely, but nothing compares to Tony’s eyes, the universe is there within him. Tony grasps his waist and jostles him to the keyboard. Discordant notes sound as he’s pushed up against it. The amber liquid on the side of the piano shimmers in the dim light.
“Take care, babe. Don’t like John-boy do you no good.” He walks out and Steve follows him to close the door.
Steve smiles and Tony hates the fact that he feels all the more right with the world because of it. They order Thai, though it is far too early in the morning for hot pots and pad Thai – Tony doesn’t care. He gets three orders of pot stickers. They head up to the deck as soon as the meal is delivered. It’s 10:30 in the morning. They have two hours until all of the last testing is done on the nanites. Two hours before they are disentangled.
Mechanically, Steven eats but Tony can tell he’s not enjoying it. He hopes it isn’t a requiem on his situation but that he’s engrossed in his role – working out who is who in the world and what needs to be done to support and protect Tony and the Stark family. It had better be a strong sense of fealty and loyalty from the omega to his alpha.
Steve kept quiet and never said a word about it throughout those long wonderful first days with Tony. Tony had been more than willing to enjoy those first days. When Tony agreed to put Steve in the cage, after he directly disobeyed an order not to come, part of Steve’s nature exploded with joy. Even though he kept his reaction stoic and quiet, he curled up in that cage and gloried in the rough feel of it against his skin.  The cage was only as big as a large dog crate and Steve couldn’t move well in it at all.
She offers her hand and he accepts. Once she leave he picks up the tablet and starts to go through the different options and limitations. It’s a long list but what he finally decides on ends up being more self-flagellation than he’s willing to admit. As he finishes Samantha returns to the room and tells him that they have selected a few alphas that are currently available and willing to assist him in his presentation.
“I will name my heir when it is time. I want an alpha. I don’t want my wealth or my power to fall out of the hands of an alpha-.”
He wanted desperately to disappear and just walk out of the hospital, but an invisible tether tied him in place. Tony indicated the new guy. “Who’s he?”
“No need,” Steve says. “That book allowed my mom to live another year. I say that’s worth it.” He tugs at the blades of grass, knowing he shouldn’t disturb it but not being able to stop himself. “I did memorize some of the poems though.” He’d always had a great memory. Maybe too good.
“Tony.” He cannot parse how Tony is standing by his bed, how it is Tony’s hand covering his own, a welcome pressure. He mustn’t be there. This must just be a product of his mind. Like Peggy.
Even though Steve wants nothing more than to drop into bed, he ignores it as he enters his bedroom suite. He shrugs off his clothes and goes directly to the shower. Turning on the faucets he steps into the stone tiled shower, closes the glass doors. The water beats down on him and he closes his eyes, thinking about Tony. He hasn’t thought about his art or his comic book story in a while. It’s really all been about Tony. Even his drawings for his book have transformed into Tony. He smiles. He wishes he hadn’t screwed up so badly on the drive. But still, Tony is a force, a tidal force. A gravitational force. Steve can’t seem to not want to be near him. On his days off, Steve finds reasons to hang around close to the house. Sure, he’s run the island, even swam in the frigid waters, but more often than not he doesn’t leave. Tony’s even offered to have him go overnight to the mainland to get away. Steve’s never taken him up on it.
“I’m a man of science. Hocus pocus doesn’t work here.”  He scans the horizon, according to his information they should be approaching the landing area. “Do you remember anything else?”
Steve presses his lips together, biting back a response that would only serve to depreciate himself.
“No. No. It’s today,” Steve hisses at the end of his sentence. Before Tony can bark out any laughter at the unfortunate day Steve decided to make his entrance into the world, Steve rushes to say, “Really no big deal. The job, sir?” He points at the documents and, for all the world, looks like he might salivate to just sign them in his own blood.
When he finally swims back to the surface of consciousness after long hours in the hazy of fever and dreams, nightmares of bloody battles, and mud, and fallen comrades, and friends on the end of his bayonet, Steve opens his eyes to find an unfamiliar face staring down at him.
Tony goes to the galley kitchen, pulls out a few crackers and cheese, plus a bottle of water. He’s not a chef or even a cook, he’s not making that mistake. He finds some grapes and places them on the platter as well. Bringing them to Steve, he offers the platter to him.
He arranges a short trip to DC and keeps Obie off his tail by promising to meet with some higher ups at the Pentagon. Nothing goes well there. But he gets flack for his lack of progress on the Jericho. He takes it all in his usual careless fashion all the while sneaking peeks at this phone. He has a short window to visit Aunt Peggy. He needs to be back to New York by nine tonight. He bought the whole night again with Steve.
The arc reactor in the armor brightens enough to illuminate the whole of the den, the prison that Steve has been most obviously tortured in for months while Tony begged someone to believe him. What he sees as the soft blue light lands on the figure before him, takes his breath away. Tony’s muscles, his lungs, his brain, his body forgets how to breathe, because what is before him is impossible.
“Is Steve in town? We’d be happy to have him over for dinner,” Pepper said. Her act cracked in front of Tony; he assumed that Natasha could read it easily enough. Pepper wanted his old life out of their life, out of his mind. She hated Iron Man, but not maliciously. He knew that he understood that, but the yearning still plagued him.
A bright flash of light hits him and he cries out. He hears Frigga from the kitchen area say, “Now you’ve done. I’m a witch not a mystic. Don’t fool with the nature of this place.”
Steve places a hand over his eyes and twists his mouth. “I do have feelings for you Tony.” He drops his hand; his eyes are glistening. Tony’s not sure if it’s tears or mania. “I remember things, places, events, times that aren’t real. Not for us. But that doesn’t mean I don’t know you. I saw you fly a nuke into a whole in the sky. It was a one-way trip. I saw that. I know who you are. You’re the guy who invented nanites to save the world, but you’re also that guy who thinks you can’t make a move on me because I’m too innocent even though I’ve been around the world with the guy you call a bear for a year.” He sighs, hard and heavy. “I know who you are, Tony. I came to be with you.”
Steve watches the back and forth between doctor and patient. The sinking feeling in his gut grows heavy and he turns away. He’s been a patient before – heard words he wanted to ignore. He’s been a family member and listened to the worst diagnoses and fought through the weight in his gut. But the weight is like gravity. It pulls and tugs until it drowns. He coughs once and excuses himself. Tony doesn’t say anything as Steve steps out of the room.
“I asked her if she wanted to die. She said yes.” Clint looked down at his hands. “She had tears in her eyes. I didn’t know that they could cry, you know. I thought they were these bloodless, mindless creatures. That’s what they teach you. But she wasn’t – she was something wonderful and beautiful.”
“Anything’s possible.” He licks his lips and then slowly states, “He had Bucky attack me.” He points to his cheek. “Like he did in the Helicarrier. Well, it felt that way anyhow. This Bucky didn’t have a metal arm at first. I don’t think, ever. But he attacked me. Tried to kill me.” It hurts to say it, because in reality – it was true. Bucky as the Winter Soldier tried to kill Steve. It had been his mission and Steve told himself that a thousand times – truths never stop the nightmares though.
“Seen lots of things in my travels, you’re not my first angel you know,” she says and pats him on the arm. “I’m looking over your wounds. Most look superficial, most are healing on their own. Your wings-they are another story, child.”
Steve grabs it and pushes it into the port on his implant. It stings but it will allow him the access he needs.
Tony ground his teeth before he said, “Don’t you think that Steve should move on? That he should come to accept that he’s never going back, that the life he lived before is over?”
“A bond not a pack. That’s what I recall,” Natasha said with a small lift of her shoulder. “It’s weird because now I know it was a change in the timeline, a change in our reality because of Strange. It might never have been, but it is now – to me.”
Steve glanced to the side and furrowed his brows. He recalled Tony saying that the equations for Clint didn’t add up, and that the holographic representation of Clint had a halo of uncertainty around it, but this – this surprised Steve. Standing in the middle of a farmhouse out in the middle of nowhere USA, Clint hugged his wife and children to him.
He reaches it and begins freeing the innards of the makeshift magnet. Tony squirms, swallowing and grunting as he tries not to move under Steve’s hands.
“Where?” His voice sounded strange even to him. Blinking, the room around him made no sense. It looked sleek and modern, and technologically beyond what he’d seen as a V-Corps agent.
He submits. “Fine. Okay.”  Folding the bag over his arm he heads toward the bathroom. He’s going to be pissed if it’s some kind of disgusting outfit only meant for bedrooms. Steve affirms not to go to any luncheon dressed like he’s about to blow everyone in the place.
He checks the position of the sun. “A little late for lunch, what’s up?” He’s not certain he’s fit for company, yet.
Steve nodded, and both Bruce and Tony helped Steve into a sitting position. He noticed that Clint was still on the gurney. Reaching up, he tried to grab the archer’s lax hand. “Is he?”
Before them serene and beautiful, the farmlands owned by Clint Barton spread out. The raging storm is a thing of the past – or at least a thing behind them. Pastoral and peaceful, the sun shines and the rows of corn wave in the gentle breeze in front of them. He sees the house, rustic and wholesome with its large porch. He spots the tractor Tony once fixed moving through an empty field with a tiller hooked up to the back.
Tony frowned at him and then crossed the room, his hands on Steve’s bare chest. “I was worried about you. Not about my next meal. You.”
Loki spins around, his cloak whipping the air with the movement. He looks away, beyond the newly constructed maze toward the cliff. “Find your way through the maze, Captain. Find the way through the maze and maybe, just maybe, my maker won’t suffer the fate he deserves.” He glances over his shoulder at Steve – but he’s no longer the god of mischief. His robotic features dance over the remnants of Loki’s flesh. “Good luck, Captain. I’ll see you on the other side.” Loki/Utron disappears in a scattering of green light reminiscent of fireflies.
Bruce explained, “No, not as far as we know. He wasn’t exposed to an electrical shock, but he isn’t responding to outside stimuli. The monitors barely register brain function.”
Thankfully, Wong picked it up and explained, “You will be learning how to control the bonds of the soul pack and how it connects your astral projection to others. We will not be training you in the ancient arts.”
He couldn’t. Until he flopped down on his back again and Tony – his ghost – was there again. Tony smiled down at him and then Steve moved, shifted, opening for Tony.  The slide and slip of Tony breaching him startled Steve but he accepted it. He wanted it, the heat of his need blinding him to right or wrong. Tony thrust in slow easy strokes and then Steve felt his hand encompassed by Tony’s ghostly hand. Together they worked Steve, as Tony continued an ever increasing rhythm. Steve couldn’t deny the heightened throb of his heart, the hunger coiling deep inside of him. He urged Tony and threw himself into the feeling, the intensity, and the rolling thrum until at last he succumbed to it. Opening eyes he hadn’t remembered that he’d closed, he met Tony’s gaze and a knowing streaked through them.
JARVIS reported, “Captain, Agent Romanoff’s reading states that in reality she is fine but in the game she is gravely injured.”
“They even have the stems on them,” Steve says as they both settle back in their chairs. “How did the chef?”
“Which is something similar to what you experienced when Blu the lion transformed into Captain Rogers.”
“A tuxedo will be delivered momentarily.” As if on cue another knock on the door and the doctor goes to open it without Steve’s approval. “Ah Doctor Wong. Thank you.”
“Yeah? Well, I have no idea what you’re talking about. If that means you’re going to put me in a prison under the sea – well, you know how that turned out with the rest of my team,” Steve shoots back. He really doesn’t want to confront Tony, but it seems like that’s all they do. They oscillate from calm and tender to irritated and livid. It’s getting him seasick or maybe that’s the after effects of the cradle. He frowns.
Natasha chuckles a little and sighs. When Steve raises a brow at her, she shrugs. “I mean I knew you two were staring into one another’s eyes all the time.”
The monitors had wailed in protest as both Steve and Tony experienced increased heart rates, blood pressures, and oxygen use. At one point, the situation disintegrated, and Cho strapped on a nasal cannula for Stark to offer him straight oxygen. Thankfully, things settled down and their vitals went back to normal.
The omega jangles, but he doesn’t have good footing with the spreader. He suffers for it; his body juddering in the bindings.
“I’m not sure what you mean? Are you talking about God? You know how I feel-.” Tony twists to look at Steve.
“There’s several types of wraps on the platter, Tony. One looks like a beef and provolone wrap with bell peppers, another is a turkey – probably roasted – with an avocado spread, and the last one looks like a chicken salad make with sliced red grapes and celery, I think. Also, there’s a fruit salad on the side. What would you like?” Steve asks.
“This is standard. Sometimes the clients like you to wear something special. This time, no need.” She hands it to him. Without protesting, Steve dons the tunic. He feels more vulnerable with it on then without any clothes at all and that’s confusing. Natasha seems to read his mind. “Most of the workers feel more at ease without this tunic on – I know. I apologize but the guild makes it so that all workers should greet a client with at least the standard tunic.”
Bucky swallows down the acidic horror of it. The barbed wires, the thing looks like a contorted version of a dog muzzle attached to Steve’s face, but it is so much worse. The face plate is a cage, plain and simple but underneath it - attached to Steve's face it is a torture device. Bucky needs to steady himself as he realizes the gruel in the bowl to the side would be impossible for Steve to eat since his mouth is partially blocked by a rod pressed horizontally across his lips like a Horse’s bit. His crack lips bleed and scab over. He groans making little sounds and then he paws at the air as if begging.
“He didn’t do his job. His job was to protect you. You had a seizure, Tony. We could have lost you. I can’t. You’re all I have. I don’t have anyone else. You’re my family and he didn’t protect you. I asked him to protect you and he didn’t. I have to do that – I have to protect-.”
For the first week, Tony stayed cooped up in the house, never venturing farther than the patio or balcony. Steve finally convinced him to go on a walk. As they leave the house, Steve asks, “Do you want a hoodie? It’s a little on the cooler side today?”
“You left. You didn’t even visit me in the hospital. I didn’t think you wanted to see me.” Steve stood gripping the table edge, holding himself in place and waiting for Tony’s next attack. “I didn’t have a choice. It just happened. I swear it,” Steve said. “I swear it Tony. I didn’t want to hurt you. I never wanted to hurt you. I came with all of the evidence, everything so you would understand.” His soul stood apart, giving Tony space and room to decide, to weigh his intentions.
“I’ll sketch for a bit.” Steve bends his knees and props the sketchbook on them as he digs out a sharpened pencil. He’s only working in graphite because it’s not as messy as a charcoal stick. He should work on his comic book sketches, but instead his gaze focuses on Tony.  He starts to tentatively draw. Tony has his hand close to his face, in a lose fist under his chin. It’s serene.
“Yeah. I am.” The garage door opens and the bright light of day streams in. Tony smiles at the sight. The visual sensors on the helmet aren’t as advanced as his glasses, but he’s missed seeing the sun, seeing the green of the trees. He’s missed the blue of the sky.
The pack must try and save Steve, but can they when he's determined to sacrifice himself for the good of the pack.
“Are you fucking kidding me? There’s no way.”  Tony folds his arms across his chest. “We are not getting on that thing together. No way.”
The force of Tony’s thrusts move the table, causing it to screech against the flooring. It doesn’t distract or stop Tony. He’s well lost in the feel and touch, the imminent explosion of their bodies fucking. Steve sees the tension fill the arteries in the prince’s neck, feels the tightened grip on his shoulders as nails dig into his flesh. There will be bruises on his tender flesh in the morning. And then Tony throws his head back and howls words that are meaningless but nonetheless trigger a pulsation so hard and forceful that Steve’s vision whites out and he feels himself spill without a hand on him. The clenching of his ass around Tony causes the prince to fall over the edge as well and then both cry out.
Tony’s expression turns from puzzled and concerned to stern and cold. “You don’t have to worry about it. I don’t need to have a mouth on my cock all the time.”
“We are what comes after.” Natasha kept her voice soft, almost tender, as if she spoke to a frightened child. He would have blown up except her expression stayed gentle because she didn’t want to spook him. “Vampires are the state of in-between. They are neither alive nor dead. It’s a transition. Some fail and only go on to waste away in the wraith state. Others, very few, are lucky enough to be transformed.”
A clatter across the workshop room jolts him to his senses and he looks. Through the hazy entwined holographs he spots a star sitting on a broad chest.
The next steps were Bucky. Natasha dug up old contacts from Russia and got a dossier on Bucky. She told him not to pull on that thread and then took off for a few weeks of R and R. He understood that she needed time to process, that she had to figure out who she really was. Hell, in some ways, he felt the same. When Natasha left a part of his soul mourned but he knew she would be back, eventually. Bruce hung around to ensure that Steve had healed completely before he begged off to go back to New York. Steve wanted to ask about Tony; he knew the Bruce and Tony were close. though he never summoned up the courage.
Something amorphous shuddered through Steve. Not a chill or a pain, but a sense of incongruity. Like his dream where the clouds were fire and it didn’t hurt him but ran through his nerves, shaking through him. A personal earthquake meant to change him. For a long second, he only stared at her. She stood there, waiting for him, but her eyes – her eyes weren’t staring at him, but at something beyond him. Some state of life (or death) that only she could see. For the first time, he comprehended her power – she not only stepped through to other dimensions, but she saw them around her constantly. Right now, she watched something happening like ghosts playing games around him.
“Of course, why didn’t I think of that,” Tony mumbles and drops down to sleep on the cot. Sleep eludes him and shortly thereafter, their captors come, and they start to torture him. They ask him to build a Jericho rocket for them and he refuses. They beat him, they use water. They even chain him within an arm’s length of the lion for the night. Yinsen they take away that evening.
Sam stayed. Like a guardian, Sam remained stalwart next to Steve. It helped him suffer the blow of Natasha departing. Change always felt like little deaths. Sam’s presence also helped Steve move through the hurt that Tony would be interacting with Bruce but not him.
“Soon. He has some groups that he leads he’s trying to find someone suitable to take them over at the VA. Probably be 100% with us by Spring.” Steve retrieves the special creamer from the refrigerator and Tony grins.
The familiar figure looks up from his hunched position. He smiles that smirk Steve’s known for a thousand years. “Bout time you showed up. Thought you were just going to leave me here, like you did when I fell.”
Steve lies his head back on the couch and stares up at the dormered ceiling. He needs this job. Natasha put him in touch with the hiring agency, put in a good word for him too with her boss, Ms. Pepper Potts. He doesn’t fill some of the requirements but who could:
Obie must have taken a moment to compose himself because the next words were measured but seeped in anger. “Your company was about to go under. You mismanage everything Howard. You drink too much; you fuck too many women. It’s time to stop this and listen. If you’re not going to listen to me at least listen to your wife.”
He doesn’t need this crap. Striding down the long sleek corridors of his Court vessel, An’Tony taps the side of his glasses and calls on his AI. “Jo-Jo, what do we have?”
“Is that what this is? Or did that soul mark decide for you. Did you want this? Did you want him before this?” Bucky pointed to the scarring on Steve’s chest. It was back – all of the marks were back.
Pepper reports out after she informs him that his glass of water is at 1 o’clock above his bowl. “The gala is all set. I was able to secure both Hank and Jan. It was a last minute arrangement and you will owe them big time. Hammer isn’t coming, and I know you’re happy about that one.”
“No,” Tony says and takes the mug from the counter after Clint finishes pouring it. He sips the coffee and cringes at the bitterness. “He lives here, doesn’t he? That’s where he brings his clients.”
Steven nods and joins Tony at the table. There’s still a rose to his cheeks and he glances at Tony, something longing and earnest is in his gaze. Tony wonders just how much the omega loved Dany Carbonelli. He might say he never did, but it is obvious the man misses his former alpha deeply.
“I’ll think about it.” Steve released a breath and then surveyed the area around him. “Do you think we’ll ever retire?”
He steps into the shower and lets the warm water cascade over him, ignoring the memories of Tony kneeling in front of him in this very shower. His cock twitches slightly at the fleeting images, but he pushes those thoughts away. Instead, he washes like a baptism. He cleans away the past. He doesn’t forget it, he doesn’t want to ever forget Bucky, but he needs to compartmentalize his pain, his sorrow, his potential loss. He has a job to do – take care of the prince, make sure he’s safe and happy. If he does his job successfully, then indirectly Steve may affect the possibilities of recovering Bucky, of helping the Fleet. It’s a lofty thought process, but it’s not overreaching he tells himself.
“It’s something I invented. It’s like a moat around a castle, but a virtual one. This one is completely filled with code and crap now.” He stood next to Bruce. “This is all wrong. It’s not even crap code. It’s functional code.”
He calls out to them, not crying their names, but seeking them both in this realm and the next. The Boundaries are shuttered to him and no matter how far he reaches into them, the cold liquid of evil seeps out. There’s something wrong within the worlds and realms. He cannot search, because the way has been infected with the lower realms, the realms of evil intent.
“The sky’s my worry,” Steve says and nods to the darker clouds toward the far west where they are headed. “I’m hoping we make it across the river toward the ranch before we have to set down for the night.”
Tony raises his hands in surrender. “My fault. All my fault.” He leans in but stops short. “Don’t bit me. Remember I’m the good guy.”
“Okay,” she agreed. Leaning forward she touched her identical brand to his mark. When she did something within him, within his core – his astral projection – grasped hers, linking them in the soul bond. Her confidence was essential and not in question.
“What? Jesus, no. Steve!” Natasha laughs. “You’ll actually be attending the different formal functions with the prince as his Escort.”
She glances down and then back to him again. “You’re all I have as well. I’m glad you’re back.” She disappears then without another word. He tries not to contemplate the meaning behind her words because he has a Captain to save – a Captain he dreams about at night, a Captain who may very well still be at the hands of terrorists.
“Tony,” she says and leans in to lightly brush her lips to his cheek. “How are you feeling? I’m so sorry I haven’t been by to check on you.” She squeezes his hand and, while others spouting those words would sound superficial at best, the warmth and tenderness in her tone shows that she’s anything but.
Whatever they’re planning on doing it’s obvious that it’s not happening right now. They assessed his physical state and decided he can’t be transformed into one of them because he’s too weak. All he needs to do is to play along, get stronger while not allowing them to know, and then escape.
Tony wasn’t cheating. He told himself these things as he fucked his hand and images solidified in his mind. As he reached out and thought about those burnt and ashen stings of his soul needing connection. Inside, he didn’t lie to himself. He let his imagination shine and his frayed ends merged with the one he was looking for, the one that he wanted.
“Yes.” JARVIS displays the image of a man in his mid-50s with startling white hair and a eyes like daggers. He’s obviously fit from the glimpse of muscles on his forearm, but his robes hide the rest of him. In his right hand he cradles a semi-automatic, in his left the head of a tiger.
“It’s a protein drink, after all. Keep your strength up. Maybe you can bite off Thaddeus’ fingers next time?” Pierce chuckled as Ross scowled at the older man.
“Yes, Thor said about the ergot being laced with something special from his brother’s concoctions, might be right.”
With that Tony confronted Steve. “Well, Cap, what do you say? You sprained your wrist and now we’re all in a mystical, magical, wolf pack together?”
He stops that train of thought. Ableist. That’s what that is. Tony can do anything. He just needs the accommodations to deal with his blindness. Hell, look at him now. He’s peacefully sleeping as he downloads a program into an implant in his brain. Who the hell else in this whole world can say they can successfully do something like that? He might be able to cure certain types of blindness. Steve turns over so he can see Tony from the couch. The curve of his shoulder, the line of his jaw, the mess of dark curls in the bed – it’s like watching the stars in the dark sky at night. So beautiful yet so very mysterious and far away. Untouchable. Steve closes his eyes. Somewhere along the way, he falls asleep with his thoughts.
It was like an explosion. Like the big bang but instead of creating the universe it only burned and burned until whatever was left was nothing but ashes. Everything turned sharp and clear and
"Maybe Peter should stay over and keep you company. ", she then suggested with a conspiratory grin. Peter gave Wade a look, curious too see what he would reply, but once he did Peter wondered what else he had expected.
"Well, I cut it pretty short at the back and at the sides but left it long on top. Because your curls are cute.", Wade winked.
"I can't promise anything. ", Wade returned, a small smile creeping onto his face. It wasn't all lost, yet.
He wondered if he was alone. Probably not. He wondered if he could be alone for long enough to end this. Peter had felt like this before, this was familiar. He had been sure that he was ready to die many times, he had tried to get it over with, too. Killing himself was difficult. He'd have to find a way to hurt himself so much that he'd die before his body could heal. His hands wouldn't do. Maybe a knife. He needed a knife or scissors or something.
"It's okay... I promise...", he whispered before a cough shook through him. The blood he spat splattered onto Gwen's face.
"Okay, Deadpool. You aren't getting anything until we made a DNA test, its standard procedure, so if you'd follow me to the lab...", the Fake-Peter went completely rigid, his too-big brown eyes shooting towards Deadpool with panic.
"Tall, pretty, into memes and willing to put up with an emotional wreck.", Peter replied simply before staring intently at Wade.
"When I went through the treatment they gave me those drugs that sort of...numbed everything.", Bucky sounded not entirely there when he spoke about it, his eyes distant, remembering his own time in that hell hole. "It didn't necessarily make me more obedient. It sort of... focused me and shut down my feelings. I wasn't afraid, I didn't panic anymore and that made me easier to work with. But I also didn't care about anything in general.", his voice hitched for a moment but it was steady again when he continued. "Add a shitload of dissociation and the possibility that he's actually angry at us and I think that's what we saw right there."
"Yeah...?", Peter asked, his smile turning a bit nervous, like he feared rejection, like Wade could ever say no to Peter.
"Your HYDRA file.", Bucky replied, his tone apologetic. It had been the most recent picture of Peter, taken right before they froze him. The Peter in the picture didn't know yet that he'd wake up to Wade's relentless rambling instead of HYDRA's cruel words. All he knew was that he had killed his only friend. He looked empty in the picture, soulless. Luckily the passport picture was too small to show that. "I'm sorry, I needed something quickly.", Bucky apologised.
"I'll take that into consideration next time, thanks.", he smirked in return and Tony didn't attempt to hide his relief.
"Not my intention, baby boy. Besides, I have no idea what the actual afterlife is like, I never got past the doorstep.",Wade said, turning his head a little to look at Peter beside him. The boy was staring up to the ceiling too but a faint smile pulled at his lips. "Don't worry, I'm not in a hurry to bite the dust.", Peter then stated, still not looking at Wade.
. Bucky threw himself against it a couple of times, using his metal arm as a battering ram. "Get it open!", Wade snapped but the door wouldn't budge. It's almost like Stark build this house with super soldier inhabitants in mind.
"Yes I am, there's no point in denying it. ", he stated bluntly. It was the truth, he didn't care that it was. He was fucked. And he understood that not everyone was willing to put up with him.
He looked so fragile, curled up in his bed, his unkempt hair hanging into his face, the dim light casting dark shadows underneath his eyes.
"No, I heard you. Just... why would you say that?", Wade asked and he couldn't hide the crack in his voice. Peter glanced over at him, finally. Wade searched his face for something. Any semblance of an emotion, anything that reminded Wade of Peter. He came up empty.
"If Peter didn't want us to follow he would've turned it off like last time. ", Tony mumbled, thinking the same thing that Wade did. "We're going after them. Get your suit and weapons and meet us at the hangar.", he then ordered determined, before getting up.
"How are you doing?", Steve dared to ask after a moment of silence and to his surprise Peter actually answered.
He tried to learn from his father's mistakes, to do the opposite. Peter didn't have a mother and Tony was a busy man, it would've been easy to hand him over to a Nanny, make him someone else's problem. But Tony wanted to be better. So he did everything himself.
And Steve. Steve was a fucking blessing, as always. He was the only one that knew how to handle Tony's bullshit. He knew when he just had to let Tony be alone with himself and when it was better to pull Tony away from his workstation. He stayed awake with him when Tony's mind was too wired up to calm down and he was there when Tony woke up from a nightmare. "Do you think he'll ever come back?", Tony asked one day because he had the awful habit of indulging in his worst fears. They were eating dinner on the balcony of their house. Bucky had just sent Tony another picture of Peter. He never told Tony where they were, though he could sometimes tell from the backgrounds of the pictures. Apparently they were on a tour through american national parks. Right now they were back at some beach. Peter was standing with his feet in the water, his pants rolled up, wearing an oversized t-shirt that probably belonged to Bucky. His hair had grown out and was curling at his ears, his skin had a tan and his cheeks had filled out a little. He wasn't smiling but squinting at the camera, shielding his eyes from the sun with his hand.
Natasha couldn't understand how he could be a genius and an idiot at the same time. "HYDRA doesn't care for their people, they have sacrificed people in the past. And even if this isn't a plan, he could still be programmed. A sleeper agent without knowing it. What if they activate him? What if he goes rogue like James? What then?" They didn't have an answer to that because there wasn't one. "I'm trying to protect you here.", Natasha added, softer this time. That was truly her only attention, to protect Tony, Steve
"I have a really quick metabolism.", he replied before digging into his first burger. That's one thing he had actually gotten better at, eating. He still probably didn't eat as much as he should with his metabolism but he didn't have as many anxieties connected to it anymore.
Keipon narrowed his eyes at Peter and he had to do his best to not cower underneath his glare. "You had some work done."
"I wish we could've met sooner.", he admitted and the smile on MJ's face was something heart breaking.
"Here he is! The one and only Peter Stark. You can thank me later for finding him, right now what he could really use is a sandwich and a bed!", the other stranger announced and Steve focused on him instead.
Okay! Here you have chapter two. I promise this story isn't just gonna be tons of angst with nothing in between, I do have a plot planned that will set in motion next chapter but I just needed to take some time to establish where everyone is at emotionally. I hope you enjoyed it and leave a review! Your comments motivate me so much!
"Yes, you did! You can bring him back, so why the fuck won't you?! ", he asked, pushing her away from him.
Peter's eyes grew large in anticipation. "Yeah! Sure, let's go!", he agreed before pushing himself off the floor.
Peter needed a second to get the joke but when he did he started to chuckle. "No! Is not like that,  it's- It's like the webs of a spider, just stronger.", he explained.
But tight now I'll just leave you to wonder what happens next! I hope you enjoyed it and leave a review! They are honestly the most motivating thing ever!
The towel was warm from the radiator and soft against his skin. Peter avoided looking at the mirrors in the bathroom once he was done drying himself and instead focused on the bandages. They were stained red and had gotten wet anyways so he pulled them off before looking at his wrists in the bright light of the bathroom. They already looked much better. Still bleeding but it didn't look like a wild animal ripped his skin to shreds anymore.
Then again, maybe all that tension had completely exhausted him. Now he was sleeping, his head resting against the window, snorring quietly. Wade had never seen him look so peaceful.
How did Wade know this? Well, it all started with a devastated Tony Stark, calling in an Avengers meeting to explain that his missing son had been found but was missing again. The news was met with joy
"A cult? Is that what we're calling HYDRA now?", he asked and Tony could hear that edge in his voice, that sharpness, like a warning.
"Did he also tell you about what I did? About what they found out about me?", he asked and there was an edge in his voice, like he was challenging Bucky. Steve indeed didn't tell him about any of that, so Bucky shook his head. "I have a file, it documents everything I did at HYDRA.", Peter started and Bucky noticed how he said
Bucky's eyes grew wide as he realized his mistake and he was quick to deny it all. "I didn't say that.", he said, his tone apologetic.
"Where?", Peter asked. He didn't quite think Wade's words through, he was too tired. Then again, sleep was nothing peaceful so he tried to avoid it.
"Get out of my house and don't you dare speak to my son ever again!", he hissed, his voice dripping with venom.
"-but he completely freaked out.", Wade finished with a sigh and Tony nodded miserably. Wade let out a deep sigh as he tried to get his mind, and his boxes, to shut the fuck up so that he could form a coherent thought. "It isn't a big deal to you but it is to him, Peter was abused for the majority of his life, if he does something wrong, even something little, he expects punishment, might even crave it. It's sick. ", Wade mumbled, his hand running over his face.
Bucky wasn't sure how exactly this happened but there was a kid in his bed. After he brought the boy into his Brooklyn apartment, he took care of his wounds as quickly as possible, but to his surprise they were already closing up by themselves.
, that sounded like an awful idea, in light of recent events and Peter seemed aware of that. He was quick to explain himself. "It's not like that- I don't want to kill myself.", he added but Bucky wasn't convinced.
They stayed a couple hours, watched a very bad slasher movie that inspired a discussion on why Peter and Wade didn't already become a horror-film-actors-duo.
It wasn't dramatic and it didn't even catch Tony's eye until he heard the plate crash against the tile floor and shatter into dozens of shards.
It didn't convince Natasha, though. She just narrowed her eyes at Steve before saying:"We're a team. We can't afford to have secrets."
A short glance over at Bucky told Peter that his eyes were still firmly focused on the road. He had mostly given up on getting Peterto talk to him. At least for now. Granted, Peter had participated in the conversation as well but now he had grown rather tired of it.
On first glance there was no way that that boy was laying in front of him. But the more he looked at his sleeping face the more he found similarities. The nose, the same bushy eyebrows, a sharp jaw like Tony's.
"I need you.", Peter said, Wade liked it when Peter needed him. He stepped closer because Wade liked it when Peter was close to him. He reached out and touched his chest because Wade liked Peter best when he touched Wade and could be touched by him.
"What are you talking about?!", Tony asked, turning on his chair to face Wade, his gaze sharp, determined but also deeply worried.  It was the first time he even acknowledged anyone else's presence.
him to check out his room. He then proceeded to only leave it when called, he completely retreated otherwise, into the room and into himself.
Bucky must've been disappointed. He had thought that Peter could be saved. Peter always disappointed the people he loved. Still, why would he be here when they tortured him? Why would he watch? Wasn't it bad enough that the agents saw? But maybe this was his punishment, maybe they all wanted to watch him come undone, humiliate him. HYDRA used to do that. He could remember times when agents would tie his arms behind his back, blindfolded and put noise cancelling headphones on him, then they'd let him stumble around a room, completely disoriented. He didn't see the agents, he didn't hear them. He felt their stun battons. This felt a little bit like that game. Like he was completely out of control, and no matter where he turned, he was just met by agony and once things would clear he'd be met by their taunting laughs, by Lorenz' smile. Peter wanted everything to stop. He wanted to be numb again. He could be good if they just let him be numb again. He had behaved then. Things had been clear, nothing hurt.
When they finally arrived at Barnes' apartment building, Tony was visibly shaking with nervousness. but he still straightened his back and soldiered on. He'd never been to here before. While Tony didn't blame the former Winter Soldier for his parents' death, not anymore at least, they were never close and Tony doubted that they ever would be. Still, he'd rather have Peter with Bucky than with anyone else, he might understand what the boy needed best.
They had a good hour, calm, quiet, Peter focused almost completely on the diaries. There was something about them... he had called it familiarity when he talked to Bucky but it wasn't just that. It was soothing, in a strange way. Because even though the things HYDRA did to Bucky were horrendous, even though they made bile rise in Peter's throat, even though they awakened memories Peter would rather keep forgotten, Bucky was okay. Or at least he was better, functioning. Something Peter was so far away from that even thinking about the process made his head spin. But Bucky did it, even though they had broken him, even though he would never be the same, Bucky was okay and maybe Peter could be, too. Peter was fine in that moment, or close to it. Then Natasha came barging in.
"I don't know what a sasquatch is but I guess it ain't good.", Peter commented before reaching into his hair and pulling down a single strand to look at it. "And I don't mind. It's bothering me anyways."
Steve Rogers was a painter. Peter didn't know why he had been surprised. Steve was a fucking person, of course he had interests outside of being Captain America and Tony Stark's boyfriend. Still, when Peter stumbled upon the studio a month ago, he was baffled.
They started to hang out more, especially in the evenings, MJ would join them for dinner or come over afterwards. One day she even tagged along to the beach.
His face showed the aftereffects of his panic, bloodshot eyes, rimmed with red, dark shadows underneath. But his expression was blank, almost bored. His eyes looked straight ahead but it was like he was looking through all of them. He didn't react to them, didn't say a word or make a sound.
Not sure if it'll happen in the next few chapters but I have plans and they are not fun, not for Peter or any of the people he loves. ANGST FOR EVERYONE! Can you guess what it is?
Bucky knew how much it must've taken out of Peter to ask for this, to ask for time and a bit of privacy. He knew and he respected it. And damn, Peter really needed a break. "Then I won't. But you know that you can tell me when you're ready."
"You had friends at HYDRA?" It wasn't exactly an accusation but it felt like one. Peter felt the need to justify his alliances.
"I love you, too. ", Wade returned and he was happy. Even though Peter was still in danger. Even though they might never have a normal relationship. Even though in a few hours Wade would get tormented by Death again. Even though he still didn't know how Peter's death had effected him. Wade was happy and he could tell that in that moment, Peter was, too.
MJ looked like she was about to say something else but then there was a hurried knock against the door and Tony asked from the other side:"Peter?"
"I- sorry, I don't know who you are. ", Peter admitted. Shouldn't his afterlife be something familiar?
Wade didn't get time to contemplate that thought much further though because in that moment he heard shots. They had no time to react when something hit one of their tires and suddenly they were flying off the road.
"We're keeping it under wraps for now. A handful of people, not more. Us three and a couple of friends.", Tony said.
Peter wasn't hopeful in nature, he wasn't optimistic. Optimism was a foolish trait when you grew up the way he did. A fatal character flaw that made life so much more unbearable. Things weren't good just because. Every rose had it's thorns and people were like that, too. Life was like that. Peter didn't expect good things, he never did. For a while he though that that would make it hurt less. He couldn't be disappointed if he didn't expect anything, right? That's not how it worked. He had been stripped of everything he cared about often enough to know that nothing really helped. Still, Peter didn't hope for anything. He didn't expect that he could just go home, that his father would still want him, he didn't expect forgiveness. Not when he could never forgive himself.
“Yeah. Everything’s fine. No asthma attacks, heart rhythm’s been pretty steady – no incidents of arrythmia. Also, I’m eating well so no overt issues with anemia or anything like that.” He rolls his sleeve back in place.
Tony and Steve go shopping, spend time at a lacrosse game, and end up in the shower together. Along the way their secret starts to unravel....
“I should be taking care of you. You’re the one with a missing friend,” Tony says but his eyes betray him, he’s hungry for Steve to take him.
Drying his hands on a towel, Steve nods. “Well, at least we’re safe and sound here. Unless we lose electricity-.”
They are sitting nearly nose to nose. He feels the warmth of Tony’s breath against him. He wants Tony to touch more of him, his wings. “If I laid down, would you, would you massage my wings?”
Slapping Tony on the arm, Obie smiles. “It’s about time you take care of yourself, Tony. And Mer Rogers, how did Tony find you?”
How could Steve love someone with a stone heart? How could he long and crave someone with an undead soul. How could Tony damn him? Answers never came but he grabbed Steve and kissed him, hard and long and fiercely. He poured his strength and fear and love into the kiss, and Steve rewarded him by returning it with such power that Tony would never have guessed he’d only just fed him. It urged Tony into a lusty desire without inhibitions. All his concerns dropped away and he trailed tiny nibbles and bites along Steve’s neck and then his chest. Steve groaned in response as he first went frozen with the paralytic that Tony released and then relaxed when Tony suckled at his flank, sending the antidote through Steve’s circulatory system.
Steve retreated to the right side of the car, blocking the whip's view so that he couldn’t see Tony under it.
Now everyone knew who Tony was talking about. At that moment, a big green hand parted the crowd and pushed Thor aside.
“I'll give you a shilling for what you think now." Kris opened the door and stepped out, putting her arms around Tony from behind.
Steve did not speak. He sat quietly beside Tony. Tony felt someone sitting next to him. Subconsciously, he thought it was Jarvis. Without thinking, he hugged the man next to him.
"Wait, Cap... May I have a look around your room? I haven't been in your room since I've been here." Said Tony.
Steve sat by the fire polishing his shield, which he had done dozens of times. From time to time, he stole a glance at Tony beside him. Tony's mind was clearly fixed on repairing his armor. His face was orange in the firelight. Squinting his eyes, he pulled one tool after another from a small box spread out beside him.
"Oh, I know, it's my fault. I shouldn't have kept it from you and other Avengers. If it was him, this little problem would probably have been solved long ago. But I am not him." Tony hated the feeling of powerlessness. He hated the feeling of being under siege. He hated the feeling that almost everything had gone beyond his expectations. And these unexpected things also include himself.
"To be exact, only half of it was caused by me. I'm trying to fix it and protect everybody from it. I mean everybody. That's the difference between you and me."
"Moreover, he taught that class specifically for the Desk Man, we were forced to waste time. Fortunately, this time he trained his young version, and didn't drag us into summer camp."
All the mutants present joined in making this container. Several lights appeared in midair, creating a shield over Central Park. At the same time, a silver light glowed from the machine Tony was operating, throwing into the vortex of space-time turbulence.
"Looks like someone's trying to be a hero today, want save the bastard. Don't you ever go out without a brain, hmm? You're only one, but you want to defeat us, uh?" Said the tall, stout boy in the cap who led the way.
"Tony, you're tired. Sleep for a while. Leave the rest to me." Steve's gentle, steady voice rang in his ear. The comfort, the familiarity of being in his arms, made Tony want to just go to sleep, just let himself go to sleep, leave all his troubles, all his worries, all his responsibilities to Steve, just be a human being protected by him. But he couldn't. Because he was not just Tony, he was not just a 19-year-old kid looking up at Captain America, he was Iron Man, he was his equal, so he had to protect the world, and he had to protect the man in front of him.
Steve shook his head in self-mockery, turned to leave the lab. He went back to his room, lay on his bed, still unable to sleep. Then he sat up, opened the drawer, took out the watch that was paired with Tony’s. He stared at it for a long time. Then he got up, dressed and headed for the simulation training room. He needed to find some more robots to beat up.
"You can climb tall buildings like you typically do, and I added an adsorption device to the spider's legs. There is also a spider-silk spray that you can use to reverberate. Of course, silk is 100 times more abundant than you would normally have, and 10 times more flexible and load-bearing. The four legs in the middle of the spider are embedded in the armor and you can call them out when needed. They add a 360-degree camera so you can always see what's going on around you. You can also release the tiny camera robots and remotely control them to fly at distances of up to 100 meters. They're like your spider sensing... I would try to keep the armor function consistent with your normal movement and combat habits. Detailed instructions are in the computer system."
"After I received Sikorski's message, I went through some of the documents from the year." Tasha said. "Under the presiding of Cap, the Avengers did sign the peacekeeping charter at the United Nations and get the priority permission. But these special operations only include...'assignable only to cosmic, extraterrestrial, extra-dimensional, occult, subterranean, sub-oceanic menaces, invasions, limited incursions, infestations and enchantments not instigated, abetted or sanctioned by a current member nation’. Obviously, natural disasters are not part of these status."
"Nice to meet you, Mr. Krats. Carbonell is a family business. I’ll consider your investment, but I can't accept a takeover."
"I have never rejected him for what he did. He always wanted to do better, beyond the times. But his attempts didn't always lead to good results. He was a 'future man' trapped in this era."
The sound of the crash caught Steve's attention. He led Spider-Man to the source, where the road was blocked by a pile of rubble.
Greeting them with an umbrella and a night light was Kris's brother. He pulled open the door of the carriage. "See which wandering girl finally came home."
"Steve, listen to me, don't, don't go any further." said a deep, strong voice. Steve couldn't recognize the voice, but there was something vaguely familiar about it. One of his feet paused in midair.
Tony, who had already given up hope and was ready to meet his destiny, was filled with new hope by Doom's words.
"Peter, wait a minute! It can't make you fly! Open the glide wings inside." Tony shouted anxiously from the built-in communication system.
He blasted off the flying disk at 36 degrees, dismantled the two long-grabbing robots that attacked at 45 degrees and 48 degrees, and activated the repulsion device of the boots to fly upwards to avoid the laser beams from the diagonally below ground. And then he was hit in the same direction by Steve's shield. Steve flew down. Tony fell straight to the ground, fell back, and was pinned down by Steve. Steve raised his shield and smashed the invisible joint of armor’s relatively fragile neck. Armor damaged, made a sizzle noise. Tony lay on the ground. His mask opened automatically.
"Since we are pressed for time, I will make a short story. Today's Zodiac is no longer what it used to be. It is no longer a criminal organization, and I am not a criminal organization leader. As you said, I was the only one left after Zodiac encountered Avengers a few times. I was dissatisfied with the way others were doing things, rarely involved in the activities of the organization. I joined Zodiac only for one purpose: to seek knowledge of the cosmos.
"According to my calculations, it's the safest place... We'll meet there... Zzzzz, you're in charge of the east side of the river... Two villages... Did you hear that?"
"Yeah, just Hulk, no Dr. Banner at all. You have to get over him fully, and we're going to help you get over him completely."
"I have a feeling, like it's not over yet, like there's something missing." Tony was lost in thought.
The boys gathered around him were obviously attracted by the sound of the interjection. He opened his eyes and looked up. A boy with brown hair and brown eyes appeared two metres away.
"Then you should know the consequences. If you return from this time node "as you were" now, you will face only one fate. You will become That-TonyStark, the man you stopped a year ago. I have no problem with you becoming him, but do you want that outcome?"
"Aren’t that what you heroes are for? Save the world or something? The data is in the mainframe of my lab in New York City. You don't need me to write instructions, do you? There's no point in giving you data if you can't breach the security protocols."
There were three left. Tony glanced, positioned, at 45, 62 and 170 degrees. Then Tony's fist hit the 45-degree man's face, the man raised his bat to defend. But it was a false move, Tony took the opportunity to kick him in the defenseless belly. With a click, his ribs should be broken. He fell to the ground. The 62 - degree attacker's bat has swept into Tony's waist. Tony did a back flip to avoid the attack, then flipped onto his shoulders, his legs around his neck, hit him on the head with his elbow. He passed out.
"I mean, the earth's not exterminate, I'm alive, everybody's alive, and everything's the same old and the same old. Good guys are still good and bad guys are still bad. Even though we're a little poor now, I'm going to try to make money as hard as I can, very hard. Even though I'm 20, kind of boring, uninteresting, unsurprising..."
"Peter, just dump him and find another man. He almost occupies your seven days 24 hours." Tony joked.
Yes, that's it. He's like a transformer. It absorbs, it transforms, and then it releases. And every machine has an Achilles' heel. Tony had an idea, but it was a risky one.
"In fact, I am also short of money. I launched a project in Silicon Valley, currently seeking investors. A lot of investors are interested in it, calling me. But as you know, I am busy, and this matter has been delayed."
"Steve, remind me to fix it when we get back. It made such a loud take-off after the last crash in the Grand Canyon, our neighbors are going to complain." Said Tony, fiddling with a row of buttons.
Gatlin's bed is still cramped for two grown men. Tony lay on his back. Peter lay on his side. Tony couldn't sleep, chatting with Peter.
"Blah, blah, blah... Can you old man tell any new jokes? I've lost all interest in the way you see me ten years later. I'm not a saint, but I'm not a monster either. Believe me, I also want to continue to stay in the future and play with you. The game between us was still a little interesting. But because of my existence, the earth is going to be destroyed, tick-tock...... What does that sentence say? ‘Time does not wait for me’. What can I do?
Tony thought he caught a hint of teasing in Doom's words, but then he threw the ridiculous idea out of his head. If Doom is a big-breasted, leggy woman, like Bain, then there's a good chance that his future self will hook up with her. But this guy is a scary mask man, should not be to any of themselves’ taste. So Tony said in a playful tone.
Tony's social life is rich, too. He's even taken up tennis to make himself less of a pale lab boy. This obviously made him more popular. Many girls wrote down their phone numbers on his hand. At this time, a girl named Kris DeGann came into his life. She worked as a plane model and used her modeling income to pay for her college education. Her efferent enthusiasm infected Tony, warmed him up this summer. When she was around, Tony's throbbing made him convinced that the feeling that Steve got close to him in the training room that day was just his own hallucinations, and it didn’t really happen. So, Tony threw himself into his real life, ready to embark on a passionate campus romance. And then something happened that made everything go wrong...
"I will make a public apology and take responsibility for this misdirection." Tasha said. "If the top brass is still not satisfied, I will resign as chairwoman."
"My grandmother used to tell me that a lady needs a third date before a boy can kiss her on the lips. But I'm just a village girl, not a blue-blood." Kris whispered in Tony's ear. "So... Stay with me, trust me, my roommate is not here today."
Do you think that only lofty ideals can sustain us for so many years? Let us risk our lives to protect the lives of our teammates? Let us make mistakes over and over again, still be forgiven and accepted?
This morning Tony picked up Steve and the detector, stepped on his jet boots, easily found the secret base.
"Oh, My World! You are absolutely a primitive, boring, backward, completely out of time man. By the way, shouldn't we be enjoying some delicate moment in the first sneaky taste or second, or whatever?
They slipped away, went back into Steve’s room and closed the door. As usual, as soon as the door closed, they exchanged kisses, and exchanged words between kisses.
"Then, would you force the child to crack this pocket through your mind? Charles, you have no limits. Mind control a mutant child under the age of five."
Everyone was relieved to see Cap laughing. Beast took the opportunity to step forward. As someone with bad news, know when to say it.
Steve didn't have an umbrella either, but he certainly wasn't in Tony's poor situation, but he still smiled and said:
"Mm." When the warm water and cozy kisses fell on Tony, he was too lazy to speak. He had not slept for days, and the feeling of sleepiness came with comfort and relaxation. He let out a big breath, let Steve do the rest, then fell asleep just as he had done that day.
As he ran, the brown-haired boy pushed over a fruit cart at the corner of the street, sending apples rolling all over the ground. The falling apples slipped over the painter who was carrying a ladder across the street. The painter's bucket of paint flew out of his hand, spilling yellow paint on the policeman who was chasing them. The ladder flew off and smashed into the window of a car. The car braked suddenly, and a car behind it followed. A truck behind braked too slowly and nearly hit it. An irascible truck driver jumped out of and cursed the motorist in front. Traffic was backed up and the scene was chaotic. Sirens were wailing as more police arrived.
The habitual criminals on Christmas Eve are also busy with the holiday and rarely want to cause trouble. So, Christmas Eve, as the name says, will probably be passed safely. It is a joyous occasion at Avengers Mansion.
"Aha, all the heavy armed forces are chasing Hulk now, we're just looking for someone who got lost on the way." Said Tony, slightly resentful, sitting in the copilot
Tony leaned over Peter and hugged him. Peter's eyes were wide open, watching Tony move closer and closer until Tony's lips touched his. Peter had no idea what was going on. Thirty seconds later, Tony let go of the petrified Peter.
"I call on Captain America to protect me." Steve took a round metal model of the Star Shield that had rolled off the shelf next to him and held it to his chest.
"It's not my home anymore. It's the home of the Avengers. It was his home. I want to stay away from everything that once belonged to him, avoid all the people he knew."
"Your castle is a bit big, there are a lot of fork roads, my probes aren't working, and I'm a bit in a hurry, so if it's not too much trouble, your little double guide..."
"All right, I'll tell you a tale, but don't get used to it. It's only today. I can't put you to bed every day."
Just then the door of the house creaked. Steve listened carefully. The sound of heavy, familiar footsteps.
Tony could no longer hear Kris. He turned and walked quickly out of the restaurant. So he didn't see the cutback to New York and had no idea what Steve's statement was. But he didn't have to look at it to know that Steve would have taken his big trouble off the list.
At that moment, a mob of masked men with baseball bats ran out of the surrounding trees, blocking their way and surrounding them.
"Iron Man has not been seen at the Avengers' mansion since. A source told us that Iron Man's move to the UK was not authorised by the Avengers, and that there was no agreement among the Avengers on how to deal with the situation... Stark Enterprises had been the main source of funding for the Avengers operations, and Stark himself had been the biggest financial backer. His death left the Avengers financially strapped, and the need for Iron Man, Stark's bodyguard, to remain in the Avengers was questioned. Today, one of the Avengers' co-founders, Captain America, is expected to make a public statement on the matter. Whether Iron Man will remain on the Avengers roster will be clear soon. Before we do that, we cut back to the Yorkshire Dales to find out what local people have to say about previous events."
"In that case, to make sure your Christmas wishes are granted, if anyone snatches you at Christmas, I'll have to get you back."
Peter's spider sense finally came online at the crucial moment. He found Dani up a tree and shivering in it. Seeing it, Peter happily climbed up the tree and wrapped Dani in silk. Then he tied it strongly with more silk. Finally, he jumped out of the tree with Dani in his arms and handed it over to Seth.
This time Tony followed Steve back to the room without meeting anyone. The clock in the corridor pointed to three in the morning. Tony had been in the lab so long that he had lost track of time. It was too late. Jarvis was already in bed. No wonder he had to eat the ugly sandwich. It's actually quite tasty.
The Windows 95 desktop and slow dial-up Internet drove Tony crazy. Tony thought it would be nice if the Avenger system could be hand-held and wirelessly connected to the high speed satellite space network all the time.
Tony thought for a moment, immediately fired a sonar shock wave at Steve's shield. The sound waves amplified by Vibranium, dissociated the current. The dissociated electric particles bounced off the shield and beat Electro, knocking him back a few steps.
As Tony spoke, the Quinjet's autopilot had stopped. Because of the warning, Steve had switched to manual control, temporarily stabilizing it, but it was still jolting.
Steve finally packed up his things, put on his bag and stood up. Paige stood up, too. They walked together, talking and laughing, as they left the silent school in the sunset.
Krats opened his suitcase. In half an hour, Carbonell was shocked. He had never seen anything like this in his life.
"Today I admit defeat, Tony Stark, you're clever, but you're still not going to trap me. Because my employer is a lot smarter than you, has been playing the field for a long time. We'll see each other again. You won't win so easily next time." The Spymaster tapped a device in his hand and disappeared.
"Let's go back. I'm tired." Tony quickened his pace. Tony's usual excuse. He knew he couldn't hide them this time, but he could buy time, sift through what he told Steve.
I've been playing by your rules for a long time. Maybe it's time to play the game my way. Tony thought. He walked down a dark alley, pushed a button on his backpack, and flew away as Iron Man.
I should marry Peggy, and have two more children. Bucky will be their Godfather. The girl will be named after my mother. The boy will be named after Bucky. As a man with a wife and children's responsibilities, I would probably give up the dangerous superhero job, pass on the title of Captain America to someone else, just be an ordinary country dad running a small farm.
With everyone watching, Tasha followed Tony out of the room. Thirty minutes later, Tasha returned alone.
"I've used the communication system in the armor called Maria Foundation. They're going to take care of the collateral damage at the hospital. Can WE go now?"
"It looks like I have to change the head of our security department again. The peripheral security system is useless."
"I decided to do it the old way." Steve backed out 10 yards, then flew out of the shield, hit the electronic lock on the cell door.
Tony's thoughts were broken by Peter's appearance. Tony quietly wiped a tear from the corner of his eye. He turned and smiled back at Peter.
"Elden was terminally ill, had to freeze himself. Remember the Black Circle in New York caused by the Zodiac? Apparently, the facility also lost power, and their backup power supply wasn't enough to support so many popsicles, but Elden seems to have been prepared for such a situation like that. He used the bodies of other popsicles to convert energy into his own chamber, accidentally triggering his own cell mutation and becoming the hell face like this."
"Look, it's not MJ who decides who you are, it's yourself." Tony put his arm around Pete's shoulder, leaned his head on.
The fire lit up Seth's face. He is a small man with half red hair and sideburns. He's about 30 years old. According to Tony's information, the DeGann family is one-eighth Irish, and Seth obviously has more of that in him.
"Thank you." Said Tony with his mouth full. When he finished the burger, Peter handed him a second one. This time he didn't even thank him. He just ate the second one. After eating two hamburgers, Tony finally found his stomach.
"Isn't that what you wanted? Aren't you trying to force me to give up my identity as Iron Man by putting obstacles in my way?"
"Avengers can't hire someone without a degree, Maria Foundation won't pay for it, so it's time for you to Univ task." Tasha patted Tony on the shoulder with mock seriousness. "Your leave has been granted."
"So, during this period, I finally cleaned up the things you left in my room. It is now much tidier."
"I'm just a little good neighbor Spiderman. Besides, now, I'm on the stage of Captain America and Iron Man, so I'm going to play a supporting role."
"Tony, you did disappear for a long time, and I was so afraid you would never show up again, I was so afraid... And I didn't think you'd show up and give it to me... I..."
"We must concentrate our utmost force on the spot where its shield’s weakest. I think I can detect this spot."
"I know what you're thinking. You're a bad boy, pushing your luck. Just for today, only today, you know?"
"Kids, I'm in a bit of a hurry, so I'll treat each of you to an ice cream today, if you let me buy it first."
"You rushed into Baintronics?! That's something we need to talk about." Steve woke up, got to the point.
"Because the world needs Iron Man, and the world needs Tony Stark. This is more important than you and me, Tony. And anyone who chooses to be a superhero is already ready to die for the world." Steve said.
"Thor, why don't you tell me the details of what happened? I'm really sorry I wasn't there with you at that time." Steve knows Thor likes to tell stories about battles, and he was kind enough to bring it up.
A gorgeous woman with long brown hair, high heels, a hip-hugging skirt, and a low-breast cover came through the door. The guards looked at each other, laid down their weapons.
"I understand... I also once woke up alone in this future world. Everything was strange to me at that time. Most of my teammates had become names on the tombstone. I was filled with resentment. If it wasn’t for him... It might be me who fell; it might be me who is lying in the grave today."
"Hush, hush, everything will be all right." The brown-haired boy patted him on the back. "Probably."
"Except for yourself. I see. So call me mad. You're ready to kill yourself anyway, and what harm is here in bringing in another madman?"
"I'll see you drink it this time. Every time you say leave it at the door, I always come back to collect the chilled plates. "Jarvis said.
"They still treat me like a kid. They seem to have forgotten that Iron Man is on the permanent roster. I'm Iron Man now. I don't need to be cared for like a fragile item. Have you forgotten that the Zodiac came not long ago and we won a battle together?"
Handled one and you'll never notice another. It's a trick he used when his teachers confiscated his “toys” in high school. Steve fell for it. Tony thought with delight. All he needs to do is put his hand under his cheek fake to sleep, and their voice could be heard clearly through the watch. In fact, they can't blame him for eavesdropping. After all, he is the subject of the conversation.
The hug made Peter's heart beat so hard that he didn't notice the flicker of guilt on Tony's face. And Tony didn't notice the blush that was hiding Peter's mask.
"Neither. In short, I was Tony Stark 10 years ago. I helped the Avengers defeat the current Tony Stark, and then I took over the Iron Man title."
"He would forgive his father for that bat... When he grew up, he would forgive a lot of ones and a lot of things..."
Steve sat on the doorstep drawing a picture. A yellow leaf fell onto his board and covered the forehead of the person in the picture. He stared at the grain of the leaf for a long time, and then added it to the painting. The green shady road, floating into a withered yellow leaf, the whole picture was infected with the summer was over, autumn would be sad, the picture also became bleak up.
"He built it; he created a mess. That final good deed couldn’t make up for the evil he had done!" A burst of pent-up anger, Tony held his head, squatted down on the ground.
"I... I... Of course, I... Willing to. I mean, great!" Steve bustled his drawing board and the brush into his schoolbag. The brush fell to the floor and he bent awkwardly to pick it up. The blonde girl sitting next to him had already picked it up and handed it to him.
"I cunnan na to understando se wynn of hit.(I failed to comprehend the fun of it.)" Thor said doubtfully. "butan se heortan of mine freondas is genog to macodon me felan bliss. (But the hearts of my friends are enough to make me feel happiness.)"
Steve turned to Tony and whispered, "It's been a long time since Avengers Mansion had a party. He was the one doing all this stuff, and since he, you know... Don't you mind, Tony? '
"Thank you, Spiderman. I was just going to ask Crystal to dance to this piece." Quicksilver patted Spiderman on the shoulder. "I hope you're officially joining Avengers this time."
"Or you're just protecting someone. Don't you think I don't know anything? S.H.I.E.L.D. knows everything. I'm watching you. I'm watching you both."
Tony spent most of the next few days in labs, Doctor Octopus's lab and Avenger's lab. Many nights he fell asleep in the laboratory. Again, and again, Jarvis took the cold food from the laboratory door.
"In real fighting there are a lot of distractions. If your body isn't good enough to have reflexes, you have to concentrate on getting rid of them. It looks like you need more practice."
Tony couldn’t find the village head. The civilian communications were down. With an idea, he connected to the Avengers satellite, called up the area map, located the school, and rushed directly into the broadcasting room.
“Gonna give you all I got. I want you all the time. You feel so good, so fucking perfect. All the damned time. Night and day. Wanna live inside you,” Tony divulges a litany to Steve, but it seems more like a secret he shouldn’t be admitting to him. He nuzzles into Steve’s neck, nipping him as he thrusts. He laps at the water and then bites down hard until Steve cries out not with pain but with unalloyed arousal. He bashes the shower wall with a fist and hisses through his teeth.
“Don’t you get it? I didn’t ask you to do this, I was having an honest conversation with you. Do you want to be punished? Is that it?” Tony wants to rip into Steven, to dress him down and scream and pitch a fit – but that would just prove Steven’s point all over again. He heaves in a few breathes, exhaling them noisily. “Okay, fine. I want an honest conversation with you. You are fucking brilliant in the Council room. You show up every other omega. You bring them to shame.”
Shield hits a rough patch of tangled weeds and her hoof mustn’t land right because she bucks away from it and Steve’s not prepared. He jostles in the saddle which leads to Tony’s horse spooking. They are caught between two walls of rocks to the ravine. The horse cannot back up so it charges forward causing Shield to buck again and throw Steve forward. He pitches over the horse’s head and lands hard on his back. But he has the presence of mind of curl up and roll as he protects his head from the smashing hooves of the horses as they ram forward down to the river. Tony yells out a cry, but Steve cannot help – yet.
"Not funny!", she snapped, looking furious now. "I thought that you'd die! I thought-", her voice broke off and she had to take few shaky breaths, her eyes frantically looking around as she tried to collect herself.  "What are you?", she finally asked, sounding tired and confused.
"Sort off...", he gasped. He couldn't breathe, his lungs were filling with water. Someone reached out for him, but all that Peter could see was Keipon, yanking his head up by his hair to taunt him, before shoving his head into the water again. "No, stay back!", Peter snapped, unsure who he was even pleading to.
Peter turned his head to check on the other two who were now frozen in shock when the doors to the motel where slammed open. Bucky stormed in, apparently alarmed by the gunshot.
"What's wrong with him?"Steve asked as Wade already kneeled down in front of Peter trying to catch his eye but the boy's eyes were focused on the floor.
So he just curled up in the center of the bed, pressing his eyes shut and letting the pain pour out of him while he wished for her gentle voice in his ear.
"Anyways. I wouldn't want anyone catching you without a license but we can work on that if you want.", Tony then suggested carefully, like he feared that Peter would reject him.
his stupid brain dared to resent the only people who had ever been kind to him. He didn't hate them, or he did, or maybe this was love, or maybe it wasn't.
"You hate water.", Bucky pointed out. He knew of Peter's issues with baths and showers, he had calmed down Peter from several water induced panic attacks already.
"I really don't know, I'll figure it out, though. ", he replied focusing on the boy again. Only then did he notice that Fake-Peter was glaring at him. His huge dark eyes had something unsettling, even disturbing.
But it is tooth rotting fluff and since I don't write fluff often I can't wait to hear you thoughts on it, I hope you enjoy it!
"Can you- I mean, it's selfish, really. You already did so much for me and all I've done is be a huge liability,not to mention that I'm a walking HYDRA magnet, and you crashed your car because of me and-", the rambling was the opposite of silence but just as frustrating and he only stopped once he felt Wade's touch again, this time on the back of his neck. Normally Peter would've flinched away from it but with Wade he leaned into it.
"It wasn't her fault-", Peter whispered before a violent coughing fit got a hold of him, blood splattered from his lips and Wade now fully realized that Peter was bleeding out, inside and out. He couldn't heal. If Peter didn't heal he'd die.
In the five days that Peter had spend in a coma, his body too busy with healing than to bring up enough energy to wake him, Tony had thought through thousands of nightmare scenarios. That Peter would never wake up and just spend the rest of his life in this catatonic state, that he'd wake up but just be an empty soulless shell, that he'd wake up as some kind of Frankenstein monster, with no memory of a human life or simply, that he'd wake up and wouldn't remember any of them.
"I'm aware.", he said before taking a drag of the cigarette. He had gotten used to the burning sensation by now.
"You talk like that to Death herself?", she asked but she didn't really sound insulted, just surprised.
"It's important.", Bucky insisted. Peter was about to refuse again but Bucky wouldn't take his bullshit. "It's about Gwen!", he stated and Peter froze, but only for a split second, then he was up on his feet, taking the phone from Bucky.
Peter glanced over at him before replying:"Natasha's alternative. You know, let SHIELD scoop my brain out and put it back the right way. Seems like the easy way out."
This didn't seem to convince him entirely so Wade added:"I promise I won't rip her head off." Steve than let go off him and went on to grab Natasha's arm instead. They left silently and both Tony and Wade turned towards Peter, the tension leaving their bodies, gentle expressions taking the place of furious ones.
The look in Tony's eyes softened and Peter wasn't sure, if he could take it, being looked at like that. With warmth and something like love, not that he'd ever dare to believe in that. "Of course not. Peter...I don't want you to think that you're a prisoner. Everything we do is to protect you.", Tony said, so gently that Peter wanted to rip his ears off.
It was awful, there was no point denying that. Natasha knew first hand what these organizations were like. The red room wasn't much different. And after everything Bucky told them about HYDRA... she wasn't surprised that the kid was messed up.
"Now, who is this little popsicle and would it be a bad idea to let him out of his freezer?" Wade froze when he saw the name at the top of the file.
"Shit.", he cursed when Peter reached out and covered Wade's hands with his own, staring up at him intently.
Tony's mind was already running a mile a minute but essentially it was running in circles. A cruel carousel of:'
The Black Widow didn't look impressed. "She's waiting in her cell-",she started to say, which was an awful start.
When Peter didn't reply anything to that Tony stroked his hands through his hair before continuing. "So what? You aren't the same as when you were 9? Of course you aren't, you're practically an adult. And I get that you don't trust me, or anyone really and I know it might be hard to believe that this isn't a test, that I'm not tricking you, that there won't be punishment but that's okay. Thinking like this kept you alive. That doesn't change the fact that you are safe now, that you can relax, that not every situation will end in disaster. But I don't expect you to believe that. I'll prove it to you, though. I'll remind you for the rest of your life, if that's necessary."
I'm really happy about how this one turned out, especially since I didn't know what to write next, this kinda just spilled out of me. I'm just feeling real wholesome right now, idk.
"Obviously it didn't work out. As I said, I heal.", Peter smirked slightly. It didn't seem bitter but that didn't help to calm Wade down.
"And don't worry... I... I'm not going to kill myself over this. I'll live with it.", Peter then said and Wade couldn't help but to stop once more. This was a dangerous topic, dangerous for multiple reasons but most importantly because Wade wanted to keep Peter as far away from contemplating suicide as he could.
"Stop looking at me like this. It's not personal.", Gwen said, looking straight ahead. And there was the difference. A mindless HYDRA drone wouldn't have said that, at least not the kind that Peter used to be. He wouldn't have cared that she stared. He wouldn't have asked her to stop.
"Fuck...", he whispered. "What they do to you?", he asked quietly. There was no answer. One thing was for sure, though. Bucky would take care of him, he'd protect him. No matter what happened next.
It didn't happen. Peter's heart was still racing. The boy leaned his forehead against the cold surface of the door, trying to block out the sound of his pounding heart. With a frustrated sigh he pressed the heels of his hands against his eyes before turning around. Once he lowered them he finally saw himself in a mirror for the first time... maybe ever.
"Peter, wait. We need to-", Bucky started when Peter was almost at the door. Natasha was staring him down and it was too much.
"What the fuck are we supposed to do, Buck? What does he need?" The question sounded desperate but already defeated, like Steve couldn't imagine a way out of this. Bucky had been in the middle of it, he knew that there was always a way out.
"Don't- don't get this the wrong way but, I killed Tony's parents. I wasn't myself... but still. I killed them. And when Tony found out-", Bucky's voice broke off at the memory of a time when Bucky was what separated Tony and Steve, of a time when Tony couldn't stand to be in the same room as him. "Let's say he didn't take it well.", Bucky admitted.
"Yes...I suppose...", the boy mumbled, his voice sounded hoarse and he gave Steve a weary expression before quickly lowering his eyes.
But what about the gun? Would Gwen really kill herself as soon as Peter misbehaved. He had trouble imagining it. Not because he thought that HYDRA valued her in any way, shape or form. Just because it was a bonkers plan. If she just killed herself as soon as Peter missbehaved then they'd lose both of them because Gwen was the only reason Peter wasn't at home right now. The leverage made more sense once they actually reached wherever Keipon was waiting for them, because then Peter would be on sight.
It didn't even feel real for multiple reasons. Peter, who most of the time could barely stand people being too close to him, was touching Wade, Wade's scarred and repulsive skin. He did it so softly that it made Wade's heart ache. He didn't mention it, though, too scared that he'd break the moment if he did. "She said that you were dead. And I believed her because I didn't think-", his breath hitched and Wade tried to push down whatever was building up inside of him. "After all the shit she put me through, after everything she did to me, I didn't think that she would do something like this. I suppose I'm an idiot." Wade couldn't hide the bitterness in his voice, and there was nothing sweet about it, it was vicious and ugly and Wade hated that he couldn't be better than this.
"Like you, dad.", Peter breathed out, finally looking at Tony and Tony was convinced that for a moment his heart stopped beating.  "Is it...Is it okay if I call you that?", Peter asked and he sounded so fucking scared.
"FRIDAY? Did they turn off the tracker?", Tony asked, holding Wade's gaze as he silently prayed for good news.
Natasha wished to find nothing, no proof of programming. She wished that she could just put the file back and apologize to Tony, knowing that Peter wasn't a danger to them.
"What do you mean?", Wade asked and Peter's eyes refocused on him. He looked defeated, more so than a few seconds ago.
Still, I hope you enjoy it and leave a review. The responses I got for the last chapter really blew me away.
Ahhhhhh guess who's going to see a special screening of Infinity War and Endgame tonight! I just wanna warn you that this might kill me, so if I don't update it's because I died with all my favorite characters.
I hope you enjoyed the date chapter and leave a review with your thoughts! Your comments motivated me so much to write this chapter so quickly so keep them coming!
"Perfect! Sit down, I'll get the utensils.",Wade smiled before getting a comb and some scissors out of the bathroom. When he returned Peter was obediently sitting in the chair. "Any wishes?", Wade asked, his tone chipper.
"Okay... good.", Peter sighed, smiling up at Wade. He went completely lax. Wade hadn't noticed how tense Peter was before.
Wade had handed off the phone to Peter so that he could focus on the road again. When he didn't make a sound Wade got concerned and glanced over at him again. It turned out to be justified because Peter wasn't looking at the phone anymore.
He usually avoided looking at mirrors and only ever saw his own appearance in Bucky's photos but this time he actually dared to look at his reflection.
"Okay, I've had enough of this. Put your clothes back on.", she ordered, already moving to the door of the studio.
"Do you mean Deapool?", Tony asked. They didn't know his real name. Peter nodded. "He's outside the room. He insisted on staying."
want. It doesn't come easily to me.", Peter shrugged, avoiding the question once more. Bucky got the feeling that there was something Peter wanted to ask for but didn't know how to. "Doesn't mean that there isn't anything you want. ", he stated, fishing for the truth. If there was anything that Peter wanted that Bucky could give to him, he'd do it. Peter stared at him, Bucky could tell that he was contemplating, considering if he should trust Bucky enough to tell him his wishes.
Peter stopped. He hadn't really taken the time to consider how he was feeling, yet. Not with the initial panic of waking up alone and the closely followed wonder at their surroundings. But now, when he thought about it, he really did feel better. More rested, not as hollow and cold. He wasn't feeling good yet, Peter couldn't even imagine ever feeling truly good. But he wasn't quite as miserable as he had been a day ago.
. Peter jumped to his feet which seemed to be a surprising move since everyone seemed startled by it. "I need to go...", Peter mumbled, now pressing his palm to his wound. He wasn't exactly sure where he was going just that he needed to get out.
Bucky shook his head. He knew how dark things could seem, how hopeless. He knew because he'd been there and back then nobody but Steve had believed that he could ever become something resembling a person again. If he made it, Peter would as well. "That's the aftereffects of the withdrawal talking.", He said but Peter didn't seem to like that.
A noise suddenly chimed through the jet. Peter couldn't see the controll board from his spot on the floor but he didn't have to wonder what was happening for long.
It was dark when Peter woke up, dark, still and quiet. He was still in the car but he was by himself and a bolt of panic went through him when he realized that.  His eyes snapped to the empty seat beside him before a gasp worked it's way out of his throat. "Bucky?", he asked into the silence of the car, his voice hushed and unsure. A million possibilities rushed through his mind. Granted, they were all pretty unlikely, forged by a paranoid mind. All his fears began and ended with HYDRA.
Death smiled, it looked bitter and painful. "You only ever want to see me when you're sad and lonely. ", she said with a shrug.
The whole time he didn't stop eating. Apparently the bread fired up his appetite and he was on his 3 egg and 4 waffle now. He dipped the waffle into marmalade and stuffed it into his mouth.
That's how Peter found himself outside for the first time in weeks. As promised they paced along the beach, right where the water met the land. Tony was keeping a few feet distance while Peter walked through the water barefoot.
The presence of a boy in Tony's home seemed to be enough of a surprise to finally wipe the blank expression off her face. What was left was hard to define but there was a certain confusion there.
"Okay... thanks. And could you-", shame coiled around his throat, making it hard to speak:" - could you not look at me." Wade turned away, now facing the wall without hesitation and it was embarrassing how relieved Peter was. "Thanks. ", he mumbled before pulling off his shirt and strictly avoiding looking down at himself.
, over and over again, his voice was dripping with poison and once Wade stepped right underneath where the boy was hanging, something dripped on his face.
"Or what?", the stranger chuckled, waving the weapon around like a toy. It was the only level of threat, physically Peter knew that he could take the other man in a fight.  He just needed to get the gun out of his hands and then the danger would be terminated. Peter decided to disregard the risk and approached the robber but as soon as he took another step the man pulled the trigger.
"Know that feeling. I annoyed my handlers so much he threatened to sow my mouth shut. I'm telling you from experience, that would've been awful for the franchise!", Wade laughed, deep and genuine. "We used to make Bucketlists, me and this other guy they were keeping in hearing distance, of stuff we wanted to do when we got out. Just to amuse ourselves.", he then added and even though Peter couldn't see his face, he knew that Wade wasn't quite present anymore, thinking back to that time. "Got pretty depressing after a while, though. ", Wade finished before shaking his head slightly, maybe the voices were bothering him again.
"How shitty that I don't remember most of it, am I right?", Peter then said, a bitter smile on his face.
"I love you Gwen- remember that I love you-", he said, his voice trembling with the strain of living. His vision blurred but he still saw the moment, the moment she switched. Her eyes grew wide and the weapon slipped from her hand, clattering to the floor beside them.
It was more of a feeling, a pit in his stomach. It felt like Peter was desperately clawing for control while losing more and more of it, like he was stirring into a direction that Tony couldn't follow and that time was running out. They had already missed so much and now it felt like the timer was counting to zero. What would happen when it reached its end? Tony didn't know but he was sure that it wouldn't be pretty. That's why he rushed into suggesting therapy instead of waiting a bit longer. His son was unraveling in front of him and he had to do something about it now, not
"No, that's me talking.", he snapped all of a sudden but the agitation was gone as quickly as it appeared, leaving that same blank expression. He turned his attention towards his bandaged wrist before starting to unwrap it. Bucky watched him carefully but didn't try to stop him. The skin underneath was mostly healed, only a long, jagged, silvery scar remained and even that would be gone soon. "I didn't mean to kill myself, you know?", Peter said after another moment of silence. He let his fingers run along the scar, not pressing down on it to cause more pain, only lightly brushing over it with the tips of his fingers. "I mean, I did, but I wasn't really me. I wouldn't do this again. ", he added. He wasn't apologizing, which Bucky was relieved by. He wasn't sure, if he could take it, if Peter apologized for the pain someone else had put him through.
Wade's eyes fell on his unmade bed when he stepped into his bedroom. His chest tightened with panic as his boxes whispered in his ears, calling him all kinds of vile slurs.
"I'd never leave you, okay? I promise, it's you and me, remember? I'm not going anywhere.", Peter reassured her.
"You don't need to apologize... Why did you get in the water if you were actually scared of it.", MJ stammered, her tone uncertain. She was probably waiting for him to lose it again.
"Seems like it.", Peter remarked and suddenly he wasn't on the bed anymore. He was standing right in front of Wade, inches away, glaring openly into Wade's eyes. Wade was always surprised when Peter showed off how unnaturally quick and strong he was but Wade didn't flinch back. "Get out of my room.", Peter ordered and his voice was almost a hiss. His eyes weren't empty anymore but they were still cold.
"No, this is a ruse. I'll drop and kill you so that you have to spend time with Lady Death again.", Peter replied sarcastically, rolling with his eyes. He pulled at Wade's hand once more and this time Wade leaned out of the window and let Peter pull him up. He held onto the thin string of Peter's webs and marvelled at how Peter could just pull him up without breaking a sweat or even standing up.
"You don't know what foster parents are?", she asked, like she was hoping for Peter to say. "Just kidding."
"Nahh, that wasn't convincing at all, baby boy! Next time with a bit more passion.", Wade tried to joke and he did actually get Peter to smile at him but it didn't quite reach his eyes.
It took some time but Peter slowly started to settle into a routine. At first it was just get up, eat, ghost around, eat, pretend to watch a movie, pretend to read, pretend to listen,
"Let me know if that ever changes. I'll kidnap you to a waffle house to change your mind on any day.", Wade tried to joke and Peter picked up on it.
"It's a tragedy.", Peter whispered, because it was. They had turned his best friend into the thing they both despised so much, against her will.
"Yeah?", Peter shrugged. "I suppose it just didn't have a priority in HYDRA's curriculum.", he added but it sounded off-hand enough that Bucky didn't comment on it.
It broke Wade's heart, how could it not? Of course he loved Peter, of course he wanted him to know that.
Three jeeps, all black, drove off the highway to the side of the road they landed on and then the only thing Peter could hear was gunfire. It was deafening, especially for someone like Peter. It felt like his head was exploding.
"You're so beautiful.", Peter said with a breathless laugh, his eyes fluttered shut for a moment and only opened once Wade gave him a careful shake.
Then he told him that he could leave the table. Not because Tony wanted him to leave but because he was 97% sure that Peter wouldn't move an inch, if not ordered to do so, no matter what Peter wanted. Tony felt like a handler, not a father and he was disgusted with himself.
Anyways, back to the story. This one was fluffy again but as you might be able to tell it's the last one and we're heading straight back to awful-town. Can't wait to show you what I have in store!
"And being myself has worked out so amazingly for me in the past.", Peter said, his voice dripping with sarcasm.
Then Bucky remembered how he himself used to be and felt guilty. He had been just like this, worse even. He had been violent. Steve didn't give up on him, Steve wouldn't give up on Kid. So Bucky didn't either. He ignored the times it felt like he was taking care of a machine and not a person. He focused on all the moments that told him that Kid was real and alive and in there.
"Peter, you still with me?", Wade asked, his tone slightly alarmed. Maybe because Peter hadn't said anything in a while.
"Peter-", she started to greet him, her calm fake smile on her lips. But Peter didn't want to play the game like that.
"Alright Spidey. You want proof, let's get you out of here then." Suddenly Peter wasn't on the ground anymore,  he was being carried, bridal style. Sure, it was humiliating, but Peter was way past feeling humiliated and his aching body was just glad that he wasn't dragged along.
"Somebody saved me. HYDRA doesn't control me anymore. Did you get saved? Did you escape on your own?" The kid didn't reply, his eyes grew distant for a second and suddenly they were filled with tears.
"Yeah, the whole package. Torture and brainwashing included. But I wasn't the only one. There was this friend of mine-"
The boy tensed, sitting up clearly caused him effort but his voice, barely above a whisper, was steady when he spoke. "Is this real? I mean, am I really here?"
A fire lit up in his chest when he saw Peter's name on the screen and died down as soon as he heard Tony's panicked voice on the other side of the line. "I sent a jet for you, he needs you."
"Are you okay?", She then asked and Peter hated how sincere she seemed, how concerned. Peter hated how everyone was always so fucking worried for him.
"Are you sure?", Tony asked, obviously not entirely convinced but Peter nodded eagerly, desperately trying to erase his previous mistake.
Eventually his curiosity seemed to win like it often did, a quality that was almost a miracle in Wade's mind. Curiousity in face of fear rarely survived for long.
"I have no fucking clue what to do with myself.", he admitted and there was something relieving in that. This whole time, ever since Wade got him out, Peter had just been existing and even that had often been to much. Peter had never even entertained the thought of what he was going to do with the rest of his life. He sort of didn't expect to live that long.
"No, you don't fucking understand!", Peter suddenly screamed and it made them all flinch back, except for Natasha of course, immovable bitch.
"Sorry to break it to you but you're stuck with me.", Wade smiled before something unpleasant reminded him of the truth. "Until I get you to your dad.", he added before turning to the three jeeps.
"No problem, kid.", Bucky said with a careful smile. Peter didn't return it but he also didn't argue about the nickname again.
The mood was quite weird the next day. Peter had clearly tuned down the explosive angst but he also seemed more careful, silent, observant more than anything else.
"Do you ever miss the 40s?", he then asked because Bucky didn't seem totally put off by Peter's curiosity.
"So what do you expect will happen, I bring him back, he lives another 60 years if he's lucky, he'll grow and age and die and then we'll be right back here, nobody is forever, except for you and me.", she said, clearly frustrated but Wade didn't care, he had heard what he needed to hear.
Finally the boy closed his eyes. That wasn't it, though, his whole body went slack and he almost fell over if it weren't for Deadpool who caught him. "Fuck, Peter... you're with me?", the stranger cursed, holding the boy up by his shoulders.
"Okay...how about we put the gun back and talk about this instead. I promise that we can work this out together.", he suggested, taking a step closer, reaching towards her.
"Where is she?! What have you done to her?!", he asked sharply, jumping up from his seat and meeting Natasha halfway.
"I know, okay? I know. I love you, too Gwen.", He returned and she let go of his hands, pushing them aside to wrap her arms around him instead.
"Sorry, you don't need to swim if-" The voice sounded distant, his vision blurred. He felt like he was under water, like he was drowning over and over again.
Every day he he just found more ways in which HYDRA had deconstructed his son. While Tony would never give up on Peter like the boy clearly expected, Peter was right with one thing. Tony hadn't been a dad in 10 years, and the Peter he had lost wasn't the same as this one. He didn't know this current Peter yet, couldn't tell what he needed.
Wade wanted to scream at her, he wanted to call her selfish and cruel, but he didn't. Instead he realized the thing that might help him to get Peter back. Death was in love with him, or at least as close to love as literal death could get. She was jealous of his human relationships, she wanted him to keep on coming back to her. Maybe they could find an agreement based on that.
"Peter?", Tony called out and Wade just though that he might be in the bathroom when they heard his come voice from above.
"Yes, the afterlife is waiting for you just on the other side of that door.", Death nodded but Peter wasn't thinking about the other side. His thoughts were still stuck on Gwen and Tony, Bucky and Steve, on Wade. They'd have to go on without him.
"Yeah... she was the best.", Wade nodded, a sad smile pulling at his lips. "I think I might have a type, too. ", he added.
The girl came alive, jumping up from the bed and launching herself into Peter's arms. They held onto each other for dear life, both unwilling to let go, both trembling violently.
"You weren't-? You didn't-?", she repeated, her voice toneless. Peter thought that maybe she was mocking him but it didn't sound like it.
They finished most of the food before the movies started, they had arrived pretty early. Soon it got dark and before they knew it the movie started to play.
"What are you talking about?", Peter asked seriously baffled. Sure, Peter and Wade were close but Peter always felt like Wade mostly just stuck around because of a sense of responsibility.
After a while he held on to one of the trees, crawled up as high as possible, he could feel the rough texture of the bark underneath his fingers.
Peter picked it up obediently and a few minutes later the boy was busy reading some article. Wade kept eyeing him every once in a while.
"Gwen isn't staying here. She's coming with us. ", Peter stated like it was fact. Wade could tell that Peter wouldn't voluntarily leave without her, he'd die on this hill.
It didn't quite make sense to Bucky. HYDRA didn't do this to him, it didn't look like them. His theory was that the boy hadn't been in HYDRA custody when his injuries happened. This looked like an accident that he only survived because of his healing factor. The arms still didn't fit but Bucky would just have to ask him about that once he woke up, if he did wake up.
"HYDRA training. He has all the skills of an agent, he just lacked obedience.", Wade supplied before looking up at Tony. "What now? Do something! You're Tony
"If you say so "  That ended the conversation for a while. At least until Wade left the highway and drove to the nearest wafflehouse, stopping in front of it. Peter stared out the window with big eyes and then looked back at Wade, narrowing them.
"Yes, Peter. Skinny guy, messy brown hair, doesn't understand pop culture. Ring a bell? You seemed pretty familiar with him last time." Wade had no time for Death's games but she never really cared much for what he wanted. Wade didn't mind her most of the time but he also knew that she was essentially a predator and he was her prey. If she wanted to play with him she would do exactly that. "Oh that one.", she said innocently as she leaned in on Wade, holding onto his neck and pressing herself against him. She wasn't warm, that's what convinced him that she wasn't Vanessa. She wasn't alive, couldn't even pretend to be, not fully. Death had never lived, she'd never understand how it felt.
"They are brothers.", Bucky replied. He hadn't really thought about this yet but he'd do anything to keep Peter present.
