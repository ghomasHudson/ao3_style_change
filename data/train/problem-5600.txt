Coulson’s eyes widened just a fraction and his mouth fell slightly agape but he did not display anything more other emotion other than the calm, relaxed expression he always wore. He quickly recovered and reiterated, “So you have not had any kind of contact with Sergeant Barnes at all?”
“Jarvis, hack into Osborn’s Tower video feed and look for any signs of Mary Parker,” Tony commanded, turning to his work station.
He dug his fingers into Steve’s flesh and pressed his face into his shoulder and let himself give into despair for a few seconds.
Tony tried to properly kiss his lips back but he was sobbing too heavily and Steve was holding up all his weight. Steve rocked him gently and kept whispering apologies into his scalp. To Steve, it seemed like only half an hour ago he had last seen Tony but, to his husband, so much more time had passed and, in that time, he thought Steve dead. Steve’s heart went out to him and he wanted to hold and comfort his husband’s trembling form for eternity.
“Maybe we slipped on the ice? Did we hit anyone?” Tony gasped, scrabbling up to look out Happy’s window.
They hit a wall of traffic and Cable cursed under his breath. After a short pause, he grumbled, “Hold on.” And drove them onto the sidewalk. Steve caught himself on the door handle as the car violently jumped, going over the steep curve.
When Steve had slipped away with men before, he’d mostly meet them in bars. They’d size each other up and go down an alley or, if Steve got lucky enough, they’d spend the night in a hotel. However, it’d always been impersonal.
Luckily, them being ridiculously in love was a positive factor in getting Steve to be less angry with him.
Tony smiled sadly at him and murmured, “Future stuff.” He around at the gathered company. Everyone looked shaken, Peggy and Gabe most of all. Tony said, “Alright, let's get this thing started! Ready to help, Gabe?”
Vision nodded and wrapped an arm around Wanda’s waist and then held out his free arm to Wade. Wade stumbled into his embrace but never once took his eyes off his boyfriend.
Bucky sat down next to her, his expression suddenly serious and Steve slowly sat down, strangely feeling like a perp in an interrogation room…
She kissed him fiercely and she pulled at his shirt. He did not want to let go of her but her moans of frustration finally broke through the haze of lust that was growing in him. He helped her remove his top layers. As he pulled his undershirt over his head, she ran her hands up his torso and then sat up and pressed kisses up his chest.
From out of nowhere, Aunt Tasha pounced on him before he could push through the blackened doors to the ER waiting room. Peter struggled against her hold and screamed out to his father, “
“Would it be unsanitary to clean the rest of this particular area with my mouth?” Tony asked, his finger caressing the base of Steve’s cock drawing a groan from Steve. “What do you think, Steve? Should I stick with the towel or go with my mouth?”
Steve felt like someone had doused him with a bucket full of cold water. All of that was for nothing?
Clint looked with him and, as Steve turned back, Clint hissed, “I’ll find someone!” Turning to Natasha, he asked, “Do you have him?”
Steve was the first out of the van and he ran to the entrance to the secret facility where the two stood.
Steve shook his head then leaned back in his seat and stared at Tony with a happy smile. He asked his husband, “Speaking of
Steve purposely curled the corners of his mouth even more and Bucky’s brow seemed to twitch higher. Tony was sitting across from them and he ducked his head to hide his smile. They were playing cards in the cafeteria and it was after the dinner rush so there were a few groups simply hanging or playing cards like them.
“Crystal, sir,” Steve replied. "But I must insist on staying with my son. He was traumatized by Tony's 'death' and my disappearance. I can't just leave him again like that."
“…I think so too,” Steve replied, lightly grasping Tony’s hand. Tony looked at him and Steve said, “Peter is smart. He’ll know when he should and should not use it.”
Peter shrugged and said, “My Uncle Ben is at work and my dad couldn’t reach him. Harry, do you know where my mom is…?”
It was only at that angle did he notice very faint veiny lines surrounding the reactor. Steve searched his memory to the first time he saw Tony without his shirt on and he was positive they were not there before. He lightly touched one and asked, “What is this?”
“I have to Peter, I’m a superhero, remember? It’s more than just going to fight the bad guys. I have to protect people too and, sometimes, protecting takes longer than fighting… I will come back, just like Uncle Tony, and we will all go out for ice cream, alright? Uncle Ben and Aunt May are really excited for you to sleepover, aren’t you excited?”
Tony stuttered in reply, “I – I…thank you? Um…” He needed to say more. Hell, he wanted to say so much more but he wasn't as brave as Steve was and couldn't be so forthright. He usually danced around his feelings and he never put his heart out on display like Steve was doing.
It was easy to do with Steve because he was such an amazing person that Tony always felt at ease in his presence. With Steve, things went back to normal and their friendship stayed as strong as ever.
Tony shot off Steve and Steve stood just as sharply. He remains of his shirt fell off him without his notice.
He’d only just told Rhodey about his little side project that morning, after the whole jet plane fiasco, but had the government already known?
“…I felt similarly when I thought you had gone down in Air Force One,” Tony whispered. “That combined with this horrible guilt because I had thought I had failed to save you when I had the chance…”
Howard beamed widely and pulled Tony into another tight embrace. He whispered, “I want to know everything that happened since I last saw you…but I doubt you will tell me because of the dang ol’ time continuum again?”
Tony wound his arms around Steve’s head and pressed his face into Steve’s scalp and, with Steve, he too wept for their lost child.
“You’re not a jerk, Dad. You…You just want to be there for me as a ‘dad’ but it can be a little stifling at times. There are some days I do appreciate it. You’re my dad and I didn’t get to have the whole father-son experience growing up…I had Richard and then Uncle Ben but it wasn’t the same. It wasn’t
‘Pizza!’ Was Steve’s instant reply. Tony laughed again and, as soon as he stepped into his suit, he placed the order.
,” Howard hissed. He found his son on stage and saw he was already looking at him. Tony shot him a glare and looked away sharply. Oh, boy, he was upset.
Even his impending death hadn’t hit him this hard. He felt his eyes well up, but he adopted the blank mask he used for most scandals and didn’t let them see how affected he was… He was so angry and most of it was directed at Steve. Why did he do it?? It did more harm than good toward Tony and Steve’s own future.
“Or do you miss the idea of an ‘us?’ Maybe all you really need is an ‘us’ with Barnes?” Tony replied icily.
Tony stepped beside him lightly pinching his arm to grab his attention. Steve exchanged a warm smile with his husband and then redirected his gaze as their son approached them.
His breath caught in his throat when the man beat his father and he stopped breathing all together as he watched him throw Howard back into the car and murder both of his parents. The soldier then walked up to the camera and shot it, making the screen go black…but not before Tony saw the man’s face.
Peter shrugged and murmured, “Truthfully…nothing. I just want to laze around and maybe watch some movies.”
century. Without Tony, Steve would have been lost or gone insane. And, most importantly, he loved him. He loved him so much he felt like his heart would burst. The love he shared with Peggy never equated to what he felt toward the older man in his arms. Tony grounded him in ways he would never understand. But their current arrangement…being so emotionally cut off from Tony, was destroying Steve. If Tony could not love him…he needed to find someone who could.
Peter came to a stop facing the sliding glass door to the balcony. His eyes were not on the cityscape but the reflection of his stepfather as he exited the kitchen and walked over to Peter.
“No,” the Goblin interrupted. He stepped closer to Steve, his height made him look down at Steve. Steve adjusted his shield according, waiting for an attack. Then the Goblin sneered, “The boy is
Peter left without so much as a goodnight and fled to his room. He was already shaky with this new relationship but it was on even more shaky ground with everyone seeming to disprove of it. It made him feel so insecure about himself and Wade.
“N-No!” Peter strangled the mask in his hands and repeated, “You did not know. Oh my God, you really did not know. You did not know and I just told you. I did not even wait for you guys to…Oh my God, I told you.”
Tony closed the door to the fridge and stared at his hands as he tightly squeezed the handles and his knuckles turned white from the pressure. He breathed evenly to try and calm himself and then whispered, “I know what he did. I know
He did not want SHIELD to know who he was and he definitely did not want to be paid off for revealing his identity. He was one of the few superheroes left in the world whose identity wasn't public knowledge and he'd like it very much to keep it that way.
Steve sat up slowly, trying not to wake the others up. Natasha simply rolled to her side and freed his one arm but Tony grumbled and buried his face deeper into Steve’s side. Steve carefully unlocked Tony’s arms and placed him on the pillow Steve had been laying on. He ran his fingers through his hair once and then slipped into the kitchen.
Steve bent down and gently kissed his husband. They both whispered their love for each other and, as they separated, they held each other's hands until their arms could not stretch any further and they were forced to break apart.
Dennis got to work and Peter looked back to Wade and found the man smiling at him. He leaned toward Peter and said, “So my baby boy isn’t a baby after all.”
“Don’t go where I can’t follow,” Wade begged of Peter, staring into his frozen, shocked face with half-crazed eyes.
“Nope,” Tony said, scooping up a large glob of oatmeal. “I’m boring.” He then shoved the food into his mouth and slowly chewed it, looking anywhere but at Howard.
The parted slowly and grinned happily at each other. They only had eyes for one another and the rest of the world faded in the background.
Wade placed a finger over Peter's lips and said, “Say no more.” Peter leaned into his touch and Wade moved his hand so he was cupping his face. He traced Peter’s cheek with his thumb and Wade promised, “I know you'll be amazing. You're Spider-Man! You can't be anything less! What you've done to me already has made me nearly blow my load!!”
Both men immediately stopped what they were doing and Pepper charged in from the dining room after Peter’s exclamation. Tony glanced at the others and then refocused his gaze on Peter before finally saying, “I am just trying to protect you. You don’t need to worry yourself with what they are saying.”
“Home, I guess,” Steve yelled over the wind. Why would he ask about Sam? Did he suspect he was a part of it?
Tony had gone into the relationship thinking he could handle it like he handled his usual, flimsy relationships…but he did not factor in the fact that Steve was not made to be a one-night stand kind of guy. He was made to love and cherish and…and grow old, smiling that genuine smile of his at his significant other for the rest of their lives…
His heart ached at the very thought of seeing Steve’s smile even diminish a little…and Tony did not want to leave him. Steve’s company was the only reason he was surviving the past. He’d gone crazy by now if it weren’t for him.
Tony’s mind raced. Palladium was hard to get in the future. He knew for a fact that something as bountiful as aluminum was rationed in World War II so palladium would probably be totally impossible to get in this era.
When he thought Bucky dead, the world became dark and devoid of a happy future. When he woke in the twenty-first century, Tony had taken that mantle and Steve had light in his life again.
“Who’s the Mama Bird now?” Steve joked. Tony always called him such when he overly worried over Peter. He sat himself up with a groan and Tony’s hand instantly shot out to support him.
of May, 2011. Your mind might be a little off because of the trauma. Don’t worry everything will be alright.”
“But we need to get you a replacement piece for whatever is in your chest, right?” Steve demanded, squeezing Tony’s hand tightly in his worry. “Tell us exactly what you’ll need and we’ll get it.”
“Uncle Thor brought me here to wait with Harry until the fight was done,” Peter explained. “And since I was here, I thought I’d come see you…if that’s alright?”
His boyfriend slipped back into bed and Tony turned away from him so he wouldn't see his glassy eyes.
He had cleaned up his room for when he gave Peter a tour of his place and, thankfully, it didn’t become too disorderly since then. A few wobbly steps into his bedroom and Peter pushed him onto the bed and then jumped right on top of him.
Yet leaving his arm hanging there, waiting for a handshake was also suspicious so Steve slowly grasped Tony’s hand and had to hold back holding Tony too tightly as he felt a sudden surge of touch deprivation. Tony’s warmth sunk into Steve’s hand and memories associated with that touch filtered quickly through his mind. They never had many opportunities to hold hands. It was frowned upon in his era so he’d treasured all those collective moments and he couldn’t help but think of them as he slowly shook Tony's hand.
The Commandos warmed up to him instantly and he fused into their group as easily as a nuclear reaction. Daily, the team would split into groups of three and patrol the woods along the perimeter of the base and Tony was immediately included in the endeavor. He got to know each member personally as they strolled through the abandoned woods. They were all chipper, funny, and so young. Tony enjoyed getting to know them, or, in the case of Dum Dum and Aunt Peggy, learning knew quirks to their younger natures. The men he had grown up idolizing were very human but it made Tony think all the greater of them.
“Yeah, I took command as soon as you decided to catch the idiot who tried to kill himself,” Bucky replied.
Steve turned in the direction of the cafeteria but, as soon as he saw an empty alcove, he leapt into it.
The screen expanded on the area, showing Steve’s familiar form and the flurry of bodies around him trying to bring him down in the main glass elevator.
He picked up his scattered clothes and went through what little files he had. He made a few notes but could do nothing more without a microcope and his slides. He then went into his closet and organized and then reorganized his set up. He was teetering on the edge of color-coding his socks when he came across his old camera.
Steve wrapped his arms around himself and fell back against the metal wall. Tears began to drip down his cheeks. He tried to answer Jarvis but his lips were trembling and his throat was so tight that he would only be able to squeak if he tried.
“I’m going to send this to Pepper and let her know she’s an aunt now,” Tony said, already shooting the text to his friend.
Steve sat with his hand over Tony’s for a few minutes and watched his husband’s sleeping face. It was relaxed yet Tony’s grief had ingrained deeper lines around his red eyes and his mouth had seemingly been molded into a permanent frown. Steve reached out and lightly brushed his lips. Steve missed the smile that used to come so easily to Tony…he missed living in that time when they were happy…
Steve did not feel rectified upon his answer and shame trickled into his chest. All this time he’d been thinking about himself and how great it would be to finally touch Tony the ways he always wanted. He never considered how weird it must be to his friend… Yes, Tony was bi but…Steve was his friend. Being anything more than that must be strange to Tony.
By their glances at Clint, he guessed the archer was going to be their next victim in the drink creations.
Steve's eyes twinkled like he knew exactly what Tony was thinking and, without looking away from Tony, Steve informed Fury, “In fact, I’m more than fine. I’m in an era where I can love the man of my dreams, marry him, and spend the rest of my life with him. Not to mention, my best friend is alive and probably lurking nearby, listening in.”
Bucky suddenly appeared and announced his presence by slamming a vase in the middle of the table filled with bulbous purple flowers. Everyone jumped back from the bouquet, shocked by it sudden appearance.
Between upchucks, Tony heard the plate and mug clink lightly as Steve set them on the counter next to the workbench. Seconds later, Steve’s warm hands were on him and he was making soothing noises. He rubbed his back and talked to him as such until he finished.
He pointed his webshooter at a far off building and shot the solution at it. Peter tugged and they went flying off the roof. Wade stretched out his arms like he was flying and laughed excitedly as the flew through the sky.
Tony looked at his top lawyer with a frown and said, “You are not invited. Why didn’t you bring up this dress before now?? We could have avoided a trial had we had this at the preliminary hearing!”
Steve released a shuddering gasp. He had held his breath waiting but, now it felt like he could only sob not
“…When we all heard Peter on the radio, we came running,” Tony explained. “Thor included. The Goblin got away.”
He smiled warmly at her and she inserted her hands in the spaces between his arms and ribs before pressing her chest to his and wrapping her arms around him.
Steve bunched his brow together and asked, “Wh-What does that have to do with kissing me?? What are you trying to say?”
Until then, Happy Holidays to everyone and who else is feeling the urge to gift Tony a new core for Christmas? :D
May’s eyes flowed over all of them, checking to make sure everyone was settled and eating before she partook of her own meal. As she poured herself some orange juice, she bluntly asked, “What happened?”
, his man even had the muscle structure of Adonis! The curve ratio of his ass alone was enough to bring Tony to his knees.
He pushed Natasha away from him and charged Barnes. He grabbed the man by the scruff of his shirt and demanded, “
, he got the idea from our project! A sentry is practically the same thing as a shield! It protects!”
Tony nodded and wondered if Steve was putting it together yet. Tony jumped in either way and said, “Susan was obviously upset but she’s now filing charges on us for unlawful firing, slander, assault…and rape.”
Her brows pinched in confusion and she asked, “What more?.. And why are you speaking to me in English?”
The first scene in this chapter is the same memory Steve reflected on in the last moment of the prior chapter. It takes place not long after the events in Warm (part three), before Steve and Tony got married and Peter was still a toddler.
Thor had been getting lunch at a deli when the tower was attacked but was flying back now and would be with them in minutes. Natasha and Bucky were already outside fighting and Clint was joining them, having successfully delivered Peter to the safe room. Steve called Peter last once he knew everyone was doing what they were supposed to do.
bedroom now that I’m shacking up with you?” Steve countered, smiling as Tony pulled him up the stairs.
to understand! Ever since I saw you the other day these memories have been coming back, memories of you, memories of us—.”
Cap was the best candidate. He was a man of morals and Tony already knew he from what little interacted with the man that he could be trusted. The fact that the man was also Tony’s childhood hero was a perk and, as soon as he was home in the future, he was going to rub it in Rhodes’s face.
"Fourth wall," Wade replied cheekily. "Oh, and I apologize ahead of time for Chapter Nine...I always speak without thinking..."
Tony grabbed his hand and clutched it to his chest. He stared at Steve as if he sprouted two heads. But the worst part was seeing the change in his eyes. Steve had grown used to the warmth and trust in his gaze. Chaotic hurt  replaced it.
Steve watched it all in shock and was at a loss for words. He didn’t even hear his lawyer’s questioning him until the judge leaned in and loudly stated, “Captain Rogers!”
Peter fully inserted himself with one last thrust and both of them groaned from the sudden sheathing. Wade felt wondrously full.
Hydra had been waiting to use him for a total SHIELD takeover, but Fury was already leading scorched earth campaign to clear out all the Hydra agents. The entire country was embroiled in the scandal and no one really noticed when Tony slipped away for a cross-country flight.
Tony sighed heavily and returned his gaze to Steve’s. He’d told and shared everything with Steve over the years. He watched Tony grow up and knew everything about him. It just felt…more vulnerable though, sharing this. Maybe it was because it was being spoken aloud in the real world?
Tony inhaled sharply and pushed himself out of their embrace to look at Steve again – really looked at him. The mysterious SHIELD agent who had died in Obadiah’s attack…Tony ran his fingers through Steve’s beard again and his mind felt like it was going to explode.
The hologram of the city was gone and now it was May’s street glowing around them. Peter’s body suddenly came flying out of his bedroom window and both men paused to see if their son was alright. With the tiniest sign of movement from Peter, Tony felt spurned on to run to his suit. As soon as it closed around him, Steve whispered, “Bring him home safe.”
him. God, I need him so much and nothing can fill that. Not even you,” Steve whispered, lightly caressing the side of his face with one of his thumbs. Bucky slowly pushed himself off Steve, his expression stark. Steve grabbed his shirt so he could not escape and whispered, “I just want it to be like when my mother died…I want you to be there, be my friend…I wanted that feeling of being loved.” Steve dropped his head on Bucky’s shoulder and whispered, “Be my rock, Bucky, please, if we start to kiss then we’re both going to become undone. Just hold me and lie.”
“I-I just dreamed that I hadn’t gotten away,” Peter quietly explained. He tried to discreetly wipe his face and Tony clenched his fists tighter. Peter lifted his gaze and smiled reassuringly at all of them. He murmured, “Thanks guys…I’m fine now.”
here when the Goblin…” He paused but the Goblin crushing his reactor need not be vocalized. “I need to be there with you, whatever happens.”
Pepper ignored Tony and placed the shirt back into the box and then put the box into Bucky’s one available arm. She commanded, “Take a shower and then change into these. After that, we can go out before the sun goes down to get you two outside.”
Steve found Howard busily directing his minions in setting up his tent. It was even bigger than the main command tent and had two openings. One for people to use and the other was large enough to fit the back end of a 15-foot truck. One was currently parked in this entrance and Howard’s projects were being unloaded.
. Tony was his friend and…that was it. He wasn’t a flint. He wasn’t gay. He was not attracted to men. He had been attracted to women his entire life. He could not be attracted to Tony now. Everything he was and had been feeling was a fluke. Their first kiss was obviously brought about from the stress of his nightmare and from the stressful events from earlier that day…
Tony stared as the drawing as his mind drew a blank, but his heart began to sink as it realized quicker than his brain what had happened.
“Yeah,” Bucky replied. He lightly tapped Steve’s back in passing and then to the others said, “Let’s step out.”
People and large, black cars were following him. The city had changed in the decades since he last seen it, but the grid of streets was still the same. Steve ran at top speed and took all the routes he used as a kid to escape pickpockets or bullies.
They did not come at him like they had when he first woke so he did not immediately run. He also did not run because of the mere fact that he could not he see Stark Tower. He had no idea who these people were but, they were the reason he was here and, if they were friendly, maybe they’d point him in the right direction. Otherwise, he’d throw them through some more walls and run around the city until he found it on his own.
Steve and Tony were escorted to one of the vans and sat in what must’ve been a space they usually kept prisoners because the walls were bare, and you could only sit.
Tony was ridged in his hold for a second and then awkwardly returned the hug. Tony hummed, “Uhhh, you’re welcome? Really, Cap, it isn’t any problem. Like I said, easy-peasy.”
The entire scene was surreal to Steve. It was like he was watching himself and Bucky again. Tony was reaching out to Pepper just as Steve did to Bucky. Pepper was barely holding on just as Bucky was. She could fall to her death and have the same look in her eyes that Bucky had.
He kept his gaze pointed out the window and started mapping out a new, tentative future…with Steve. He’d never imagined settling down with someone…he never thought it possible…but now, the future seemed limitless.
It was the first night in a long time since they did not sleep together or make love. It resulted in a restless night for James and he wondered if it was the same for her as well.
Natasha frowned and forced herself to take a long, calming breath. With her hand steadied, her resolve shifted.
Why was he just looking? He started to tremble, he needed Tony to touch him. Steve fisted the sheets beneath him and moaned his name, “
Tony rubbed his face into Steve’s side and then sat up slowly. He kept rubbing at his face and smiled shakily at her, apologizing, “I’m a mess, sorry.”
Could this plane crash be some kind of pivotal moment in the universe that couldn’t be prevented? Just contemplating such a thing gave him a headache.
Natasha smirked and said, “True. If I hear Steve sigh heavily one more time I might have to punch him.”
Howard clenched his fists, not wanting to upset his son further. But there was nothing he could do. The man Tony loved was dead and none of the power or wealth Howard had could change that.
Tony blinked in surprise then looked up from the coffee. When he saw it was Steve he smiled warmly and said, “Hey there.”
Peter’s eyes went back to his costume and took it all in. To Peter, both of the primary colors had always been representative of his fathers and the morals they taught him which he planned to carry with him as a hero.
Peter relaxed into Wade’s side as a wave of relief washed over him. Everything was starting to finally work out in his life. He may have been outed as Tony Stark’s son but, he had this: his family and Wade. They were the most important people in his life…
“Can you honestly tell me that damn big heart of yours feels full from all of us alone? That you don’t crave love, especially when you see me flirt with a pretty dame or listen to the guys talk about their sweethearts back home?”
Steve placed Peter down on the ground, expecting him to play with his new toys. He kissed the side of his cheek and murmured, “I love you.”
Steve felt guilty whenever the team left for missions without him. He blamed himself for every hurt civilian, every lost life, and even all the destroyed property. He felt, if he had been there, things might have turned out differently. He might have made a difference and saved one more life. That one life could have amounted to a mother, a father, a brother, a sister, or any loved one who was unjustly taken before his or her time…
Steve did not reply but wrapped his arms around Tony and pressed his face into his scalp. He darkly wondered if a broken heart sounded different than a normal one?
Tony’s eyes trailed over the scars imbedded into Bucky’s body and then his gaze rested on the worst of them where his shoulder turned into metal. With guilt churning in his gut, Tony whispered, “You don’t need to thank me…”
Eddie chuckled darkly at Peter’s ironic observation and drank another gulp of water. He finally met Peter’s eyes and said, “I think we’re still in the middle of our experiment though. We still haven’t found out the effects Venom had on us. It had easily fused with our solution at the beginning of the experiment. Did it do anything to us while we wore it? Have we changed because of it?”
He couldn't change the future. If he did, Tony might not end up being born or the Allies might lose or something even more worse might happen.
“That’s not what I meant,” Peter interrupted him with a flush. “With a female it’s easy, take Piece A and insert it into Piece B…We both got Piece A, you catch my drift?”
Tony peered at him from behind the goggles and said, “Oh…Cap. Thanks. Is it that time of day already?”
“And I thought I was an only child,” Ultron retorted sarcastically. It raised its red gaze to Peter and stated, “It matters not…because, when I get my Vibranium , the only thing that survives my wrath will be metal. You, our father, and the rest of the Avengers will –.”
“Our Enigma is being elusive,” Tony retorted with a chuckle. His eyes flickered to a news story playing in the background and it caught his attention when he saw his name on it in connection to a gala he hosted annually. Was it that time of year already?...Why hadn’t anyone told him about it?
“The show must go on,” Tony sadly murmured to Steve, doubting he would know he was referencing one of Queen’s songs. He looked up at his friend with a wide smile and asked, “Ready?”
“It was really horrible,” Mary whispered, her gaze falling down. “…And you probably want to know how I survived.”
As their kiss deepened, Steve’s hands bunched in Tony’s shirt, slowly drawing the fabric up until their lips had to part in order to completely remove it. Tony gasped for breath, readying himself for another smothering kiss, but Steve dropped the shirt and paused. His eyes fell onto his new reactor and several emotions ran through his eyes as he took in Tony's chest.
Tony heard the click of cameras behind them and he whispered, “The paparazzi need a show, my beloved boyfriend. How shall we let them capture us together now? A quick embrace? A gentle kiss? Or a slobbery French kiss that will make you quake in your socks?”
“No,” the Goblin growled, his eyes glowed red in the dark room. His hissed, “It is time for the Goblin to make his move now. Your silly scheme is at an end.”
“You don’t know what you’re talking about!” Peter hissed, “You just found out about our backstory, don’t think you know everything! It is all much more complicated than you think!”
Peter led Wade into the main hall. To the general public, all that was known was that Tony was making an announcement. To the people Tony personally invited, like Peter, they knew what the event was going to be.
He returned the guns to the rack they had hidden in the closet and when he came back to the kitchen, Natasha was already eating. She was leaning into the counter on her elbows and her eyes sparkled when they met his.
“Apparently, we time traveling astronauts,” Tony replied ironically. “And, I need to know, do both of us get grey hair? And who had the clone??”
He did not believe Jarvis when he informed them Peter had been returned safely to the tower. When Steve saw him alive and unharmed in Bucky’s arms, he could not help but shed a few tears of relief.
Tony watched Steve round the counter with a smile. Steve began to wash off Peter over the sink and Tony looked back down at the photo.
Tony was sitting on the couch wrapped up in Peter’s favorite quilt. He was clutching a bottle of vodka in one hand and one of Peter’s inventions in another. The invention was a simple jack-in-the-box toy but it played a tune Peter came up with on his own and instead of a Jack's head popping out it was a plushie of Hawkeye.
“Project Resurgence,” Tony read aloud. He and Bruce glanced at each other and then back to the screen. Tony commented, “That sounds interesting.”
They both wrapped towels around their hips. Tony directed Steve to sit on the tub’s edge and then laid out all his shaving supplies on the nearest counter. He wordlessly handed Steve a hand towel to catch the hair and then got to work.
“I just want to test its reactions to temperature changes, certain alloys, moisture…pretty much everything to see if there’s some kind of weakness.
Steve was also obsessed with Tony’s workshop ever since he first took him there so they spent most of their time there as Steve educated himself. Steve especially loved his bots and Dummy was smitten with the super soldier. Tony initially took him to the workshop to show off his bots but Steve could not get enough of the place. He had questions about everything and he absorbed the information like a sponge.
When he was fully erect, Tony announced his presence by stating, “Beloved, you are too overdressed for this island.”
Which was how Steve ended up on top of a building holding the Hydra operative, Sitwell, over the edge and then letting Natasha kick him off.
Bucky was looking particularly between Steve and Tony but, he put on a teasing smile, and added on, "Steve's new gay ol' buddy."
“Because maybe it worked!!” Tony hissed. He pushed himself off Steve and glared at Bucky. He growled, “If it pissed her off she would have shoved it down your throat! Now get out of my room before I shove my pillow down your throat instead!”
Eventually, the boy and his mother left, leaving him with thank yous and words of praise. Steve felt humbled by it. He had been treated like this hundreds of times before but he still felt like a just a regular guy from Brooklyn.
Steve smiled to himself and let himself finally give into the darkness that had been eating away at his vision.
“Then my confusion stems from this: Tyler claimed to be working when this happened but this is not her uniform.”
“...You think someone is slowly picking off anyone involved in Project Rebirth?” Howard stated, quirking his eyebrow.
Steve and Tony will end up together (and sorry there are going to be absolutely no threesomes or any sort of love between Bucky and Tony).
Steve nodded and got to his feet. He stated, “I think I’ll settle for just getting a ride home right now.” He held his hand out to the shorter man and said, “You kept your word, thank you for showing this to me.”
Steve so badly wanted to run his fingers through Tony’s hair. Instead, he lightly grasped his arm and promised, “It does, he may have a big head but he’s also a good man. He’s going to grow old and grey and invent many amazing things.”
As his brain became deprived of oxygen, he found himself unable to focus and his thinking became hazy.
Steve leaned down and pressed his forehead to Tony’s. He asked, “What do you think the future holds now?”
“I think I will call it Clinson or Coulint. Part one is already coming to me now…I’m envisioning green slime…Steve?”
Wade followed them to the outdoor kitchen. The barbeque was already on and Steve lifted the top and turned to them. He stated, “I’ll start now and Tony should be back before we’re done. You two sit! Can I get you anything to drink?”
Tony clenched his hands, not wanting Steve to hear but...he needed to...he needed to know why they had to give up so much.
“Yes, please,” Tony groaned. He hadn’t eaten anything since shawarma. Steve gave him the address and Jarvis gave him the directions.
Steve dropped his head, his lips shook with emotion and his eyes blinked wildly. Peter’s own emotions rose and he got up and rounded the counter. Steve moved with him and they met halfway in an embrace.
Sophie’s grin widened a fraction for a second with the audience’s reaction and then she pushed, “Tell us about your life! What’s it like to be the son of Iron Man and Captain America? Or…do you want to confirm those rumors floating around about you and Deadpool?” She asked the last question coyly and wiggled her eyebrows to make the question sound more tantalizing. The audience ooed as if on cue and some giggled like it was a dirty secret.
Steve nearly fell over at the thought and collapsed onto Cable instead. It felt like the weight of his sorrow tried to push him back down and Steve tried to take a steadying breath, but it just turned into a shuddering sob.
Wade dipped his head, caressing the exposed skin of Peter’s jaw, and murmured, “As are you, baby boy…”
“I would have turned the world against its axis to get to you,” Steve swore, laying beside Tony and hiking his hips up to meet his again.
“Harry’s dad is probably somewhere in the tower and there’s probably a maid or something in the penthouse too…But if you’re still not sure why don’t you ask them?”
“Touch me, Steve,” Tony groaned into his mouth. Steve had been growing bolder since their first kiss but this was the first time their erections had come into contact like this. And,
Thor nodded and murmured, “You do not have to be there with us. For all the Red Skull knows, you are dead.”
They quickly moved together, not separating and grinning at each other like idiots until the back of Peter’s legs hit the couch and they fell over together. Wade landed on top of him, pressing all of the air out of Peter’s lungs. He furthered smothered Peter more when he pressed his mouth to his. Wade broke the kiss and gasped, “Let me know if this is going to fast or if you want to be on top or –.”
“Good enough!” Tony said, “Alright, no one freak out. Because if any of you freak out, I will freak out. People usually freak out when they see me take this thing out.” Tony put his hand on his reactor and turned it clockwise. It released with a light click but then also released a small puff of smoke.
“I stand corrected, you are worse than Stark,” Natasha replied, finally turning to the archer just so she could raise an eyebrow.
He finally noticed that everyone around them were frozen and still as statues. The Goblin was being overwhelmed with SHIELD agents and Peter was on the ground not too far from where they stood with Wade at his side. He was holding up a hand before him, his fingers opaque like Tony’s had been.
Natasha wanted to scream but the breath was frozen in her throat. She went to touch her soulmate but two soldiers stepped forward and grabbed both of her arms, dragging her away. James slipped off her lap and did not move as they took her away.
Gary laughed and handed Steve his coffee. Gary said, “That’s great! I knew you’d get through this! When I first heard about it on the news, I knew it couldn’t be true!”
“Fuck no,” his uncle growled, making Peter still. His uncle never cursed unless he was really upset. Now that he was in his uncle’s hold, he could feel the older man’s entire body was trembling, not just his arm and his pulse was racing under Peter’s ear.
Howard’s finger stilled and his eyes widened as he stared down at the crude drawing of the shield in shock as all the Vibranium components and formulas filtered through his mind and
“Give him time, sir,” Jarvis stated from his side. Howard glanced down at his retired butler and the older man smiled up at him as he said, “One day, he’ll know all you’ve done and he’ll understand. Just give him time.”
Venom tried to press upon his emotions…but the boy now knew what he was doing and he knew he could fight back. Whenever Venom tried to turn his will, all his host needed to do was think of being safe in the warm embrace of his sire, his adoptive father, his uncles, or aunts, and their love was strong enough that, in his weakened state, Venom could not break through.
Tony's hands snapped forward and grabbed his wonderfully romantic fiance's shirt. He pulled him into a deep kiss, unable to hold himself back upon Steve's words. Steve was right. From now on, where ever they were, they'd be together.
After regrouping with Sam and changing Tony’s bandages, they decided their best bet for more information needed to come from Hydra itself.
“Yes,” Steve suddenly said into the phone, answering a question from Peter. “No need to be so formal. Please, call me Steve.” He was talking to Peter Parker! He was talking to his son! Was it a good thing that he called so soon? That little glimmer of hope he felt yesterday grew into a massive inferno. What would Tony say to him?
Steve jumped and guiltily looked at Natasha as she slid into the barstool beside him. She ordered a Dirty Martini and then turned her full attention on Steve.
Wade pulled him tightly to him and Peter lost himself to the deeper kiss and the possessive feel of Wade’s grip.
As he walked the streets he rarely saw any Captain America memorabilia but his red, white, and blue color scheme seemed to be a popular choice for celebrating the nation’s birthday. He’d seen a number of people wearing shirts with his shield or a visage of him from a recruitment poster. Children ran around with plastic shields and pretended to be him as they followed their parents to the event. He’d even saw someone in a uniform similar to the one had worn on the USO tour, complete with mask and shield.
He'd then toss and turn the rest of the night and worry about his future. Steve was innocent. Would he run if he was proven guilty? What of Tony? He couldn’t ask him to run with him. They’d be fugitives for life…but they’d probably wouldn’t even make it far. Everyone knew what they looked like… so they would have to live like hermits in the wild…with no technology…and he couldn’t do that to Tony…But he knew he’d never do it in the first place. Running was a fantasy. In reality, Steve would let them take him and humbly serve his sentence despite the injustice.
Peter rolled his eyes but grasped Wade’s jaw and kissed the stupid time traveling idiot anyway. When it came to Peter, Wade would do anything for him…and Peter would do the same.
Natasha put her arm over Sitwell’s shoulder and said, “You are going to tell us everything you know about Hydra and when Zola’s program is going into effect.”
Tony threw is head back and stared at the ceiling, his heart constricting as it tried to understand the relationship he had, had with his father. He wished his father hadn’t waited until he was “old enough to understand.” Things may have turned out drastically differently.
,” Tony corrected him with a lecherous grin which made Steve’s flush deepen. Tony sat up, gritting his teeth as his own erection begged for release. He turned to Steve and suggested, “You probably want to jump in the pool to clean that off of you before it dries.”
“And if you do, I’ll take away your tablet,” Steve added to his son. Peter paled like he had just threatened his life.
As soon as he opened the storage fridge, Venom slid out of the beaker and wrapped itself around him. Peter released an audible sigh as he relaxed into Venom’s embrace. He felt so much better with Venom. He knew he was safer with it. He was going to have to find a way to keep it with him always and not just a tiny piece, but the entire mass.
Steve pushed his open hand closer to Tony and said, “Tony, I have known you for years. We are best friends and I know all your quirks. And I knew all this when you asked me out. I knew what I was getting into when I agreed to date you…
Peter snapped his head up and looked down at his uncle below him. He retorted, “Go ahead and leave. Pops did. Uncle Tony did. Now
The Red Skull had barely survived but the fact that he was still standing while the Captain, with the "updated" serum, was buried beneath ice and water, never to rise again made him pleasurably happy, but, better yet, obviously he was the more superior super soldier.
Tony found the bottle and held it up victoriously to Steve. He crawled over to him and agreed, “That it is.”
,” Steve soothed, running a hand down his side. Staring into Tony’s eyes, Steve stated, “I never doubted you’d be an amazing father. You are one of the most caring people I know.” Tony scoffed but Steve pressed, “You are, it’s one of the qualities about you that made me fall for you in the first place.” Steve gripped the back of Tony’s neck and pressed, “What happened between you and Howard will not happen again. You will be a great father.”
It was the first time Tony had dreamed without his soulmate by his side. It was so traumatic that he woke in seconds and nearly screamed.
. They began to fly all around Steve and the area. They attacked Kilian’s men and Steve laughed upon seeing them fly around like busy little bees protecting a hive. Steve might just make it.
Knowing Sam would overhear, Steve assured him, "Everything will be alright. Remember when me marrying a robot man from the future and raising a spider son with him would've sounded like an insane fairy tale to us? It's not as far-fetched as what you are about to attempt."
Steve grabbed his hand as he was withdrawing it then slowly brought it up to his lips and closed his eyes as lightly kissed the center of Tony’s palm. He opened his eyes with Tony’s hand still connected to his mouth and Tony trembled under the heat of the other man’s gaze.
Steve glared at the boy and retorted, “And you’re a good-for-nothing jerk! I coulda handled those knuckleheads by myself!”
a crash decades prior and apparently hibernated until recently…Or, like out of a horror movie, the Captain was now one of the undead…looking to feed upon human flesh…
Steve lightly grasped his hand and carded his fingers with Tony’s. Tony held his hand tightly as if he planned to never let go.
Tony rose a single brow and sarcastically stated, “I don't know if you had noticed but I had been otherwise preoccupied at the time.”
He’d been gushing to Wade about the shield for the last few days and his boyfriend wrapped an arm around him and stated, “Let me guess, something awesome happened?”
How could he be so lucky? To have Peter and to be able to date Tony? Never in his wildest dreams did he imagine his world would equate to this miraculous life.
Before he slipped away into the land of the awake and living, Tony turned to him and murmured, “Thank you…”
The hardest part was staying quiet. He wanted to say something to distract Tony from his pain or comfort him.
When the buzzing stopped, Steve opened his eyes just as Tony kissed one of his freshly bared cheeks. Their eyes met and both tilted their heads to share a kiss.
“She is well,” Heimdall replied. “She was not a part of the foremost incident and the mighty warriors of the Avengers brought down the peril before her life was threatened.”
Rhodey’s words were like ice down his spine. Obadiah stole his reactor for a reason. He had full access to the giant one in the lab at Stark Enterprises, so he clearly was going to use the smaller one for reasons that were already unnerving Tony.
Pepper tried to convince him to rent one but in the end relented her protests and helped him pick out a small island that was far away enough from any kind of civilization. He swiftly built a small house with a lab, gym, and
“I think you were a little preemptive in burying me,” Steve teased and joyous tears began to fall unchecked from his eyes.
His heart clenched as he felt a sudden craving for his mother’s embrace. What made it worse was that he could have it if he returned to this future but…
Every time he used the armor, even to just charge it, the core was tested and then more and more poison was pushed into him.
be able to sense any danger from it. To his senses, this thing was an extension of Peter and not the monster in hiding it truly was…
Tony slumped in his seat, finally understanding what she was getting at. He murmured, “It’s not like that…”
Steve would have loved to grow up in the era of wonder Tony described…and he would have been free to love Tony as well.
“That is why we are here,” Howard said. A small trail of smoke was coming out of the reactor’s seam. Howard ordered, “Jacques get me a light. Steve, Bucky, get ready to hold him down in case this gets painful. The rest of you stay out of my way.”
Harry was born a few months later but Norman did not find as much excitement in his birth. Harry was remarkably average. Normally sized and screamed like a banshee whenever he wanted something.
Steve jumped on him and forced Tony’s body into a nearby ditch. Tony grunted from the impact, but he too pressed himself into the ground as the air above them exploded with blue light. They were chest to chest and Steve wrapped his limbs around Tony to best protect him from Hydra’s weapons.
He started to pull away from Steve but he grasped Tony’s hands before they came apart. Steve leaned back into him and whispered, “I’ll still love you too.”
Steve did not remember returning to the tower. In fact, he did not remember much after Venom disappeared. Everything was in a fog until he heard Tony speak. His shock over the comment was instantly wiped away all his downtrodden feelings.
The future still had them, thank God. He did not see any commuter trains, all the ones he passed on that particular railroad all carried freight. This particular rail had been around in his era and it seemed to still be going the same way, west to California.
He operated the Iron Man suit from the ship. Several holograms were open before him as well as the ones that were wrapped around his hands like gauntlets and the one that hovered before his eyes like the ones in his suit. He turned his head to look to Steve through those screens. Looking at his husband, helped calm him, even though he could barely see Steve in his space suit. Tony had made the Iron Man suit lean back and appreciate the form fitting design he had included in its design.
Steve paused and saw a particular look come across Tony’s face but disappeared in a blink. Tony shrugged and said, “Then we will have to think of something else…”
“Sir, I informed your parents of the situation and they informed me to tell you that they’d be happy to share lunch with you instead,” Friday stated.
“Doubt it! But can't say we didn't try, eh? And, if we get arrested, you owe me all of your pudding cups from the dinner meals for the next month.”
“Pep, I am going to sink my tongue down Steve's throat in the next ten seconds whether or not you are here.”
He stopped in his tracks and stared up at the tower in shock. It was under construction but was already one of the tallest skyscrapers in the city.
“I’m sorry,” Peter gasped, lightly grasping Steve’s arm with was probably all the strength he could muster. “I didn’t mean to – I didn’t want to. Tell all those people’s families I am so-so sorry.”
Soon they’d be alone again and would continue where they left off. Steve didn’t mind waiting a little longer. After all, they were going to share a lifetime together.
Steve turned on the water at the sink and turned it to hot. He opened a few drawers until he found some dish cloths. Choosing the most worn ones, he put them under the water and was surprised to see Tony watching him with a critical eye.
Both Stark and his target’s faces paled. His target’s eyes shot to Stark’s extended arm where his soul implant was clearly visible to her. The Soldier could only see the back of his arm, but, by the target’s reaction, he knew the implant had reset. Her expression was hard but her eyes glazed over with pain.
“Sitting would be easier,” Steve retorted and Tony jumped onto the bed without another word. He pulled off his undershirt for Steve and looked at him expectantly.
Shaking his head, Barnes replied, “I can’t let you go in. We are more at risk inside than fighting outside. If you are captured, then Schmidt would –.”
So this fiction is going to involve a lot of New York legalities and, since I am Californian, I may not get everything right! If I mess up on anything please let me know! XD
Peter elbowed Wade in the gut and Wade fell back with a mock groan, clutching his stomach. Peter replied, “It’s my new suit. I made it, it’s a biological…well, it’s like a living suit. Wade, for some reason, thinks it looks like an eighties movie monster.”
“We’ll find something,” Bruce reassured him and Bruce’s mouth tightened into a hard, thin line as his gaze returned to his reports.
This had to be some sort of horrible nightmare. Any moment now, he was going to wake up and turn to see Steve sleeping soundly beside him. Tony closed his eyes and pictured the last time he and Steve shared at bed. The image of Steve’s strong shoulders, bathed in the blue glow of his reactor instantly came to him. He focused on the image, making it real, and then snapped open his eyes. Instead of Steve’s back, his gaze was only met with the sight of his husband’s coffin.
“So, Steve tells me you're gonna try to ‘woo’ him,” Bucky murmured into his spoonful before sipping it down.
“Varicose tattoos? Not into them?” Tony tried to make a joke of it, but Bucky just frowned and dropped the bag on the table within reach of Tony’s hand.
“Alright, you and Bruce go to his wife. She will need to go with someone she recognizes and trusts. Clint, you and Thor will go to your kids. They’ll need their father the most right now. And then Tony and I will find out who this ‘old friend’ of mine is.
Soulmates shared dreams so the world of color was obviously when his soulmate dreamed. Steve did not exist beyond these dreams. Between the dreams, his life was only darkness similar to the dreamless nights he’d have before the crash. In a fluke of nature, he'd somehow connected with his soulmate despite his death.
Tony noisily sniffed and whispered, “You…You don’t have to apologize…You survived, Steve. I just thought – When I first saw you, I thought…you wouldn’t…and it felt like I was bleeding out on the floor with you…”
Eventually, Peter started to feel human again, a sad and weary one, but a functional human all the same…
A sudden weight hit him like an anvil straight to the chest as his own words to Peter rebound with shocking clarity.
Jarvis was busily hacking into and monitoring all the security cameras in the city and Tony had hired a handful of PIs to search homeless shelters.
“I did – I mean – I do – I, well, we barely had time to discuss getting married nonetheless raising a family. Truthfully, I didn’t even think it was an option because we were both men but if we can get married in this era then it stands to reason that we can adopt together too…Did – ah – Did you want kids?” Steve asked, nervously.
Peter cleared his throat and said, “So, since five years passed, according to my birth certificate, I’m over 18 now…”
Tony asked hoarsely. Steve could feel his eyes on him but he could not meet his gaze. Tony sounded like he was going to be sick when he reasoned, "You let him - you -
Explosions were going off all along the towers body. Steve jumped from Tony’s hold and attacked the first aggressor he came across. As he fought, he could not help but be reminded of the Chitauri attack. He compared the people he fought with to the aliens. Some were more easily defeated whereas others put up a better fight in comparison to the aliens. This fight, however, was both luckily and unluckily only centered around their Tower. The rest of New York was safe but their home was being destroyed.
Wade was used to people confusing Deadpool with Spider-Man but that wouldn’t be the case once everyone knew exactly who he was. When he’d enter a room, he’d no longer be just a horribly disfigured stranger, he’d be Peter’s horribly disfigured boyfriend.
“What is there to eat around here?” Peter murmured, settling back into his bed. Wade held onto his hand as he settled and returned to his seat without breaking the connection. He had started smiling when Peter joked and teased Tony and that smile seemed glued to his face now.
Also, it looks like there's going to be one more chapter of the couples stories being split and then they'll finally converge!
The elevator began to move without any more prompting but Peter kept staring at his hands, his excitement mounting.
“Tony’s dead,” Steve stated, saying it aloud made it more real and final in his mind. A wave of pain washed over him, making his body shudder. He closed his eyes and rubbed them, crushing his eyeballs into his sockets.
He imagined pressing the larger man into his bed. He imagined rough lips and rougher hands sliding across his skin. He imagined the soft pants Wade would make, similar to his own.
That knife in his heart was twisting and thrusting all over his chest. His emotions were going haywire and…and Steve loved him? Like in love – love?
. Even though we haven't even discussed adoption with him yet, he is your son too. You've been there for him longer than even I have! He loves you too! I… I…You know me…I worry.”
. The notion was so spectacular that the Soldier had to step back and sit down on his cot. His limbs were trembling so hard that he could barely sit up nonetheless stand.
Venom shrunk drastically when they were gone. Wade hissed as the tendrils became smaller. Peter’s head snapped over to him and he gasped, “Are you all right??”
“Right now? I…” Peter paused, reflecting over everything in his life. He hated how the press had invaded his life and made it impossible to be boring Peter Parker anymore. But he accepted that part of his life. He’d probably began to accept it years ago when he first found out Tony was his birthfather. He was Tony Stark’s son and being so meant he would share the spotlight with his father. Peter could handle the press and he stated, “I know I am…I don't know about Wade…”
Eddie also smiled and he said, “Well…Since Subject A’s tested it out, I think it’s Subject B’s turn.”
Without pausing to think about it, Steve dropped his head close to Tony’s, so their faces were inches apart, and whispered, “Do you still feel sick?”
This kiss was brief but had filled Steve with yearning. When they broke apart, Tony gasped into his mouth, “Can you ever forgive me?”
His heart squeezed painfully as he looked at her. A year had gone by since her passing but it still hurt. He had only just recently had the heart to go out and be Spider-Man again. Before that he could barely look at the mask, much less wear it.
“You don’t have to,” Bucky stated. “You said it yourself, we can’t change what happened, but we can move forward and I want to do that. I want to move forward.”
His heart broke for Tony, knowing the intense pain he must have been going through. Steve knee him. He’d probably been hiding most of his pain in the world of the living but, with Steve in the dreamscape, he was free to be true to himself.
Whenever Steve saw Tony, they usually met elsewhere, usually for lunch at a nearby restaurant or diner. The Tower was a foreign place to him. He had not been inside it since Loki and the Chitauri attacked New York.
Steve gulped, not really liking either option. This was not his world or his war, it did not seem right. And any form of experimentation was totally out of the option.
Tony offered, “I can give Clint a call to pick you up in the quinjet. I have a helipad up top…Or you could stay here and…you know, move in?”
Steve knew he'd said it hundreds of times already but Steve was so grateful for him. He said it again, “Thank you.”
Steve smiled diminutively at him and nodded. He looked at his food and said, “Good. That’s all I want. We can continue our affair in the privacy of the Tower but…out here we’re just friends.”
“Fury is dead,” Pepper gasped and Tony’s head shot back up to stare incredulously at her. She continued, “He was killed at Steve’s apartment.”
Bucky grasped the case tightly and replied, "I have memorized each moment with the historical accounts and testimonies. I'll make sure they are returned at the right moment."
He and Tony froze and then simultaneously looked up. From his position, hovering over where Tony lay on the counter, he could easily see Sam standing in the living room. Steve’s friend’s cheeks were burnished red and he awkwardly held a laptop and his medkit.
SHIELD got the news helicopters to vacate the area so they also could not see their fellow Avenger give up the search and hunch his shoulders in defeat.
“Babe, don’t bring up other people having sex while you’re in my bed,” Tony grumbled. “And, yes, when couples start having sex in the real world I hear the sex life continues in their dreams, but I hear most tire of the sex marathons after a while.”
Tony looked back up to the far away face and thickly gulped. There were so many things he wanted to say to his super soldier…He didn’t even know where to begin…
He did not pause to wonder what happened or gloss over his memories. There was no air in the enclosed space and he could already feel his mind beginning to grow fuzzy. He needed to act fast before he fell unconscious.
“Ow, ow, ow, ow,” Wade whined as Peter dragged him back into the room by what must’ve been his ear through his mask. As soon as Peter let go, Wade rubbed the area over his mask with a pout.
In those eight hours, the entire world learned of his disappearance. The officers radioed in that they had him so it should not have surprised Steve to see the reporters waiting at the precinct, but the presence of Director Coulson, a number of SHIELD agents, Thor, and Tony in his Iron Man armor did.
“Steve…You were born this way and God made it so. There is nothing wrong about being gay. I am so sorry that you grew up in an era that vi –.”
!” Tony was the first to reply. His voice resonated over all of their communicators and he sounded so wrecked and relieved all at once. Tony demanded, “How are you?! Are you hurt?!”
Once the doors sealed behind them, Tony hissed, “You are not doing it and that’s final! Swear to me you will not sacrifice yourself!”
When the entire team came into his lab, he stopped talking to Barnes and working on his suit. The intrusion was sudden and without warning. Why had they all come together? None of them looked stressed so he figured nothing was wrong and he looked at them questionably.
“We had flown back to the Tower together because I was worried about Peter,” Steve started, happy to change the topic.
His only consolation was that the Soldier had survived his gun shot and she thought her mate was dead. He had heard living on without one’s mate was a fate worse than death and he hoped she enjoyed living the torture.
“No, we both run around the capital,” Steve replied, speaking for the first time since he introduced Tony and Sam to each other. He placed his water on the counter and continued to smirk at Sam.
Steve had taken Peter to the Central Park Zoo for the third time that week and Peter could not get enough of it. They got there just as the gates were opening so the larger afternoon crowds had yet to arrive.
He turned to Tony, his eyes wild as he searched for the blood he saw only moments ago, and gasped, “I’m fine…J-Just a bad dream.”
Tony looked up from his implant to Bruce and his smile expanded. He held up his arm and explained, “I officially have one month left.”
His entire demeanor changed before her eyes. He lost the cold, cutoff façade and looked…scared and confused. He dropped his gun and walked toward her. She raised the gun threateningly but he kept walking toward her. His dark blue eyes were focused on her face and he paid no mind to her gun. She placed her finger on the trigger with her muscles tense, ready to quickly jerk the trigger back.
Loki didn’t go down without a fight and the staff he wielded used the same energy Hydra fought with. It put Steve on the edge but it marvelously cleared his mind.
Bucky lunged forward with a massive swing to punch Natasha. Natasha dodged and grabbed his outstretched hand, wrapping her hands around his wrist. She used the momentum of his punch and threw herself into a flip, curling her body around his and kicking her leg at his head with all her bodyweight behind it. Bucky raised his other arm up just in time to block the kick and Natasha hit the metal arm with a loud, echoing thud that made Steve wince.
“No promises, Cap,” Tony replied jollily and he kissed Steve a second time before pulling himself out of Steve’s grasp and leaving.
Laying his arms on Tony’s shoulders in a relaxed fashion and locking his hands behind his head, Steve replied, “Yes, it is, unless the clichés continue and one of us is kidnapped or loses his memory.”
Tony was left alone standing next to a silent sentry and he wondered what he was supposed to do now.
They slowly pulled their faces away from each other’s necks, wary that it wasn’t safe. Steve went to look at Tony to make sure he was okay but Tony did the same, bringing his face much closer than Steve thought it would be.
Steve’s heart rate picked up. He placed his phone on a nearby counter and his hands instantly rose to his hair, brushing it back, trying to fix it. He then ran his over his shirt, to destroy any unseen wrinkles.
At that moment, Peter decided he would do all that was in his power to make Wade feel just as prized…because that was what Wade was becoming to him, something precious.
May shook her head and mumbled something about teenagers under her breath. Peter smirked but said no more. He pulled out some cereal and, in no time, was eating at the table. He watched his aunt’s back as she finished her cleaning then asked her, “What are you doing today?”
She smiled sadly at him and replied, “No, you are not wholly him right now. Nor are you Steve’s Bucky. But both are buried deep inside and maybe my James might never resurface…” Her heart twisted in her chest at the thought and flashes of their time together crossed before her eyes in an endless parade of happy, bittersweet memories. She sighed, “But you are my soulmate and being your soulmate comes with tasks of more than just loving you…I will also be there in times like these when you don’t even know yourself. Through thick and thin, you’re stuck with me.”
“Nants ingonyama bagithi baba,” Wade began to sing the Swahili beginning to the iconic song, following his friend with a laughing smile. “Sithi uhhmm ingonyama!”
“But –,” Tony began, trying to look over her shoulder. Damn the woman for practically being the same height as him! He could barely see over her head!
“Your very presence is changing the future,” Howard argued. “What’s the problem with changing it a little more?”
Starting with this chapter, I will begin to use multiple POVs. With the way this story will go I will need more than Steve's POV!
Steve chuckled but it was cut off as Tony kissed him again, deep and hard. Steve pressed Tony down into the mattress and Tony curved his body upward, trying to stay in contact with Steve as much as possible.
Tony was slumped on the chair next to Steve, nursing a coffee and picking at his single pancake devoid of any syrup. Once the coffee kicked in he would be his usual animated self and start eating in force.
Tony had no ammunition belt which was more Steve's fault because he forgot to grab one for the time traveler. Tony and Bucky began to trade overly sarcastic words that made the others heavily sigh or roll their eyes. Steve eyed the gun, planning to grab Tony the belt and its ammunition but stopped himself…because Tony was carrying one of Hydra’s guns, the very one he had been tinkering with.
Tony tilted his head to the side and his brows pinched in confusion when Jarvis said nothing more. He then heard his phone ringing coming from upstairs. He had left his cell phone on the living room couch after his last coffee break.
Tony was so tantalizingly close. Steve so badly wanted to just leaned forward and kiss him. Even Tony's gaze was burning into his, teasing and daring him to so.
Tony huffed and rose once again from his work to speak to his AI. He put his hands on his knees and retorted, “That’s enough sass from you.”
Tony was hurt and pissed and he was soooo glad Point Break tried to break his brother out of the quinjet on their way back to the helicarrier.
Pepper rolled her eyes and rose to her feet. She walked over to them and stated to Peter, “I think it is great that you are not letting this incidence tie you down. You should keep trying to live your life, in whatever ways you can.”
Eddie met his eyes in the reflection of the bathroom mirror. A stranger stared back at him. He was no longer the same person before Venom. He felt hallowed out and without purpose. Banner wanted his help…but what kind of help would he provide?
He’d already been taken to a detention cell to sleep for the night. Though it looked more like a small hotel room than a cell. The priest’s eyes widened with recognition when he saw Tony.
“I broke up with you because you are such a great person and deserved someone who could love all of you: Tony and Iron Man…I thought you understood that when we split but all of this with Steve…I can now see you blame yourself. I am the one at fault, Tony. I am not perfect. I was not strong enough.
Steve smiled warmly as he imagined Tony’s pinched expression of disgust and slinked out of the train yard without anyone noticing him.
“Natalia…” He whispered, unsure how to continue, but, the mentioning of her true name was enough. Her eyes illuminated with hope and she tenderly cupped the side of his face. She slowly rose to meet his lips. She gave him ample opportunity to pull away but he didn’t and mutely accepted her kiss.
“The Chameleon was a distraction,” Bucky hissed. Natasha nodded in agreement. Tony did not seem to hear them as he was busily typing away on three different holograms hovering in front of him. A look of total concentration was splayed across his face and his mouth seemed to be set in a permeant frown. The virus shook him. He thought no one could outsmart him or his machines and now he was trying to add more armor to a system he thought virtually imperishable.
With his heartbeat slowing with his growing melancholy, Tony ironically whispered, “I didn’t think so…”
“What about the fair?” Peter asked, it was currently Friday night. Friday, Saturday, and Sunday were the Stark Tower Employee Fair. His dad threw it twice a year, thanking his employees for their hard work ethic and tolerance of Avenger related incidences which occur at the Tower more often than not. Tony and the rest of the team went to
The song ended and another with a similar tempo began and they continued to sway and press into each other.
“It’s not fine!” Tony retorted angrily, “You are in pain! I’m afraid to touch you! Your flesh is charred! I'm afraid if I touch you it might crumble off!”
As he was under, he and the others were exonerated of all crimes Hydra had accused them of. Pepper disclosed their location to the rest of the team but did not notify anyone else of Tony’s location just yet. They may not have been wanted fugitives anymore but they were still wanted for questioning and Pep knew Tony wouldn’t want to do anything until Steve was found.
and his mind immediately imagined what they would do if it were true…He was hard as a rock within the first five minutes of laying down and he refused to touch himself as it reminded him of Tyler.
Peter’s knife slipped, spreading marmalade onto his finger. He glanced from his aunt to Steve to Wade and back to May. He looked back at his toast and slowly continued spreading the jam before he continued.
Rogers sighed and said, “Truthfully, because I made him.” Peter felt his brows rise uncontrollably. He was not expecting that answer. Rogers continued, “He promised your parents that he would never reach out to you or them and he kept his word. He did not even know your parents were dead until the day after your latest birthday. He was afraid of how you would react…He puts on a tough exterior but on the inside he’s the softest of us all.”
“To the best of my abilities,” Bruce replied, gripping the table tightly. Scott nodded and wordlessly ran out of the room. Bruce explained, “Scott has a portable battery with high voltages in his lab.”
On that same shelf were a few books his father had published and Tony’s eyes almost ran over them went he suddenly noted an old leather bound journal strangely inserted in the middle of the books. Tony pulled it out and recognized it as one of the ones his father always used to write notes in. He also remembered the countless occasions his dad had berated him for touching them.
He was asked to wait then, eventually, a man came out and offered to take him to her. He led Ben to the elevators then they got into one alone. Ben tried to make small talk with his guide but the younger man did not answer him.
“Where are you, baby boy?” Wade whispered with yearning and looked out the window as if he’d see Peter suddenly jump out from behind something.
Coulson’s team pounced on the camera to the docks and poured over the footage immediately. They knew which ship the Captain had left on but they had to confirm. The tech guys were working on clearing the footage and the rest of the agents were scouring up any clues they could find in the arctic camp.
Fury sent Steve and Natasha out to retrieve him and Coulson was to wait on standby if they needed a wave of SHIELD agents.
The civilians screamed and began to run away. The Avengers ran forward against the tide, Peter included.
Steve did not reply but his silence was more than enough of an answer for Tony, whose repulsors whined at a higher frequency for a hotter and more powerful blasting charge.
Tony had no clever reply to that. Truthfully, he’d been avoiding Steve, wanting to avoid a fight or a
“How the hell are we going to contain that thing??” Clint asked. He had an arrow drawn but was pointing it at the ground.
They needed to talk this out again. Steve had pretty much told Tony he was up for anything when they had practiced and Tony seemingly took that to heart. He needed to lay down some ground rules on how they were going to act before they totally destroyed their friendship.
The Soldier did not reply. It was not a part of the mission. He kept his gaze level with his target’s and said, “Tell me your name.”
“I can’t imagine why?” Peter replied sarcastically. They grinned at each other and their smiles were perfect mirrors of each other’s.
Wade just held onto him tighter, like his hold would keep Peter tethered down to this era despite his past being completely eradicated. His body was numb, but he didn’t watch his body’s progressive disappearance.
“…I love you,” Tony stated, his voice grave and serious. “I may have yelled it out spur of the moment out on the battlefield but, I just want you to know I was serious,
“Hey, I know it’s a lot to take in but, hey! World War II is over and there’s no more polio and we’ve got some decent TV! No more of that Howdy Doody crap! And, not to brag or anything, but I’m –.” Iron Man touched his shoulder and Steve broke away from it.
“Jealous?” Wade murmured into his ear. His breath was hot and it brushed against Peter’s ear and neck, making shivers run down his spine. The memory of waking up to Wade in his bed resurfaced and those feelings began to rise too.
“The Red Skull does not run,” James stated to her and not over the communicator. She picked up their pace. They had to get out of there. If they were still monitoring the interior of the building then...
“Me too,” Steve whispered and dropped his gaze so he wouldn’t have to see the open emotion in Tony’s eyes. He was wrong to assume Tony had so easily moved on…He was hurting just as much as Steve was…
“Stevie, even if he was…he’s going to be like all the others. He’s not going to stay. He has another life, decades away…”
James’ hold on her tightened exponentially. She returned the pressure it was a reminder for both of them that they were not alone in this.
Eddie nodded and followed Peter to the bar. They sat at the end and Peter asked Nat for two waters. Natasha nodded and filled two glasses with ice and placed them in front of them before filling them with the bar hose. She then stepped down to the other end of the bar to give them the privacy they clearly were looking for.
After another long and sleepless night with Mary at the lab, Bruce dragged his feet to SHIELD Medical and planned to check on Tony and Peter before slipping into the hospital’s on-call room and grabbing a quick nap.
Steve ran to the hole he had created in the window down the hall and looked down below. He spotted Venom and the Avengers immediately.
Steve looked down as some woman across the room screamed. His eyes focused on the fresh, bright red blood pooling at Tony’s feet and his heart stopped.
Their future was here and neither of them were ready for it but…Steve was excited. By the way Tony was beaming in the photo, he could tell he was excited too.
Since he was in the past, he didn't have to worry about his image with Steve. It was refreshing. However, as he thought about it, he realized he took a lot of things for granted in the future and he really didn't know how much he valued things until he was thrust into this era.
“…Natalia,” he whispered her once secret name. It slid off his tongue easily but it weighed down in his chest.
Tony thought his armor would hold but alarms blared in his ears and the red emergency notifications blanked his screens with warnings, obstructing most of his sight of the outside. The emergency systems activated, enabling Friday to blast him away from the danger. At first, Tony thought only the suit had been damaged. His adrenaline was pumping so high that he felt nothing wrong.
Tony grew and the world grew with him. As worldly affairs became more noticeably to the child, he started to tell Steve about it. Soon, Steve was getting updates on, not just Tony’s day, but also of the world. It was through him, Steve learned over thirty years had passed since his plane had crashed. Tony took it upon himself to fill in whatever gaps in history he missed, including the music and movies. Tony would try to sing favorite songs of his and Steve would teasingly laugh at his attempts.
Tony left the Winter Soldier chained to the ground and staring off into space but, with his door open. Tony went back to work on his suit in front of that open door.
“Done,” Tony agreed with warmth blossoming in his chest. Before the press conference, he had to get Steve alone and make this relationship
Tony froze and then his eyes snapped to Bucky’s. The Winter Soldier hadn’t been spouting an obvious fact he’d learned in his research. His voice was sad and it was the first time Tony heard emotion in his voice.
“They are in California! We can still root for them from across the country,” Steve reasoned stubbornly.
“…Ton –,” Steve began but Tony lightly ran his fingers along Steve’s abs and silenced the blond with the simple caress. Tony had been wanting to touch him there ever since he felt the muscles beneath the shirt. Steve shivered under the touch and Tony drew back his fingers.
Their loving reunion didn’t last long unfortunately. Tony’s fever didn’t let up and he relapsed back into the hazy world of delirium. Gabe gave him more medicine, the others volunteered to help sit with him, but Steve was the only one who could keep him calm.
Steve palmed his face with a groan and sarcastically mumbled, “Never mind, I don’t want to be in the real world…I’d have an aneurism by now with the things you do…”
There was a sharp clink from the window and a resounding sound from the television. He would have never thought anything of it until the alarms went off.
“I want to fix my camera. I figure I swing over to the nearest lens repair shop, pop in and then pop out,” Peter stated.
(that relationship tag is finally going into play. It would be a shame if SHIELD did something to spoil it ;D)
Tony near about came at the question. Images flooded his mind of the various ways Steve could help Tony with his current predicament, the first involving Steve’s mouth and where exactly Tony wanted him to put it.
“Your son was right,” Steve hissed and he took another step back from Tony. Tony lurched with him and felt like he was going to vomit.
Steve was standing in front of the TV with a hard expression as he watched the news coverage about Peter unfold. Tony hung up his cell and wrapped his arms around his husband’s waist. He quickly relayed to him his conversation with Peter and his plans to fly out to him.
Steve stalked up to the edge of the desk and growled, “Let me guess, if a family member came forward then you’d be happy to produce Mary.”
The elevator opened the rooftop access room which was a small area with only the elevator access, the stairwell access, and the double doors to the roof itself.
Coulson put a hand on his chest, stopping him, like Cable expected him to. Coulson stated, “I cannot just let you go without more clarification.”
There was a loud thumping sound on the roof of the van and then the window broke by Sitwell and he was gone in an instant.
Tony rubbed his back to try to comfort him and even pressed a kiss into his forehead like his mother used to when he cried as a child.
“Huh…That's weird,” Tony murmured, poking at the skin above his arc reactor. Steve leaned forward and saw he was poking one of the raised veins Steve saw the night before.
Steve knew he could not stay cooped up forever so when he went outside the next day, he made sure to go where it would impact Bucky the most. He drove out of the Tower’s garage on his bike. Anyone who saw him leave, would know exactly who he was and he probably had a few photos snapped of him that would be in the gossip rags by tomorrow.
“Peta!” Peter replied enthusiastically and Steve was instantly smitten. Steve smiled at his son and enclosed him in a tight hug. Peter hugged him back and giggled as he did.
Tony sputtered out the soda he’d just taken a drink from and argued, “Peter is a genius! He knows better! And he’s
Upon Steve’s appearance, he’d completely forgotten she was here. He sheepishly grinned at her but she did not seem to take offense.
Tonight, Wade thought the best-case scenario would have been having a terse dinner with the folks. He never imagined….
“Tony…you used the incorrect term,” Steve murmured, his flush growing brighter. He cleared his throat and said, “I…I’m gay.”
Bucky was caught by two suits instead and hung limply in their arms. A bristling Tony, meanwhile, pushed himself out of the suits’ grasps and angrily hissed, “He wasn’t going to hurt me!”
“No, thank you,” Wade replied and mentally high-fived himself for being able to slip in some manners instead of vocalizing his voice’s comment.
Marcel kept his face blank but something flashed in his eyes. He covertly glanced at Tony then shifted his gaze back to Steve and replied, “In a preliminary hearing, all the prosecution has to do is prove they have sufficient evidence…we can fight back, but DNA is considered irrefutable evidence…”
Before Thor could reply, Loki disappeared in a blink of an eye then reappeared in front of Steve. The Trickster smiled thinly at him and Steve’s skin crawled. Loki did not say a word to him and disappeared again but so did the weight of his son in his arms.
Sneaky nodded and replied, “I’d be proud to help you on your mission. I will tell you one thing about the future, the legend of Captain America and his Howling Commandos lives on in my century. All of you are remembered and celebrated.”
Deadpool always flirted with Spider-Man and sometimes Peter would flirt back but…it had all been in good fun. Peter wasn’t expecting anything to happen but now here was Wade, leaning toward him, obviously interested…
Tony was drawn away from his memories and he sat down on the couch next to Pepper as Rhodey started the projector. His father’s image flickered on and he began to talk about his expo. It was clearly scripted and had several outtakes so Tony wasn’t expecting much from it.
Bruce tightened his hold on Peter’s hand for a heartbeat then replied, “I don’t know…hopefully. That’s all I can provide: hope.”
Peter glanced back into the elevator then scratched his head as he faced forward again. He caught Tony’s eyes and saw trepidation in his gaze.
“Yes, but they are locked in Bruce’s lab,” Steve called out to him and sagged in relief. Peter was fine and Jarvis was going to be okay. He could not imagine what would happen to Tony if they lost the AI. Jarvis was family to him.
“Where’s Peter?” Steve asked, glancing around them in concern. He still wasn’t used to his son joining them on Avenger missions. As soon as he escaped his view, Steve assumed the worst.
He paused as Peter spoke and Steve glanced at Tony with a worried expression. Tony strangled his sheets. He wanted to command Jarvis to hack into Steve's phone so he could listen in but his voice wasn't working. It felt like his throat was closing up. Steve again spoke, "...He does care. That's why he hasn't contacted you in all of these years. He was respecting your parents' wishes..."
Tony put his hand over Steve’s and assured him, “I’m fine. My dad was able to figure out the element I needed in the decades between my travel.”
Jarvis lowered the volume and Tony stepped up and peered over the outer shell of his tower’s reactor. Pepper stood below him with her arms crossed over her chest and an angry frown marring her face.
Steve pulled on his undershorts as Tony settled into the tub. When he turned back to him, they exchanged smiles and Steve sat down next to him. He murmured, “Well
Bucky squinted his eyes suspiciously at Tony but pushed himself off the wall and headed out to the balcony. Tony shot Steve a wink over his shoulder then crossed the room to follow Bucky out.
The team and their son came to visit them in waves. As soon as Steve was no longer on bedrest, Bucky got into the habit of walking him around the hospital.
Those dark blue eyes she so loved became red rimmed and glassy. A single tear broke free, overflowed, and slid down his cheek to flow down her thumb. With a husky voice, he whispered, “I push and push and push but…but you just keep coming back to me.”
Natasha’s eyes flickered with an unknown emotion and she faced forward, ending the argument with her refusal to counter. The rest of the car ride was spent in relative silence with the exception of Clint muttering curses at his fellow drivers. Bucky was immobile, like a statue with a stony expression in addition.
“He…” Peter paused as he searched for the right words he could use that would not upset Stark’s teammate. He continued, “Stark…Why did he reach out to me?”
Win them with kindness was his strategy for the night and he was going to hit Stark with so much kindness he’ll be singing My Little Pony friendship songs and shitting rainbows for the rest of the week!
Tony gulped but his throat was dry and bobbed uselessly. He gasped to his AI, “J-J, you look different from when I last saw you.
He vividly remembered their journey to Switzerland, before he had fallen sick. They traveled along the French coast and spent one day on Italian soil before moving northward. The Commandos took that time to jump in the water one last time because they knew they were not going to see the ocean for a long time. Tony hadn’t gone in the water for obvious reasons, but Bucky
Luckily, Tony had the largest fridge and pantry known to mankind and he always kept it well stocked to feed the team and a super soldier with a very high metabolism. Steve pulled out all of the bread, coffee, eggs, and bacon and got to work.
"Told ya we had to find another way home. Now make it snappy. Nat doesn't believe me that we defeated Thanos without her and she wants to see Clint, the kid, and the others.  Preferably in that order but she can manage whichever order they come in."
Peter let go of T’Challa as soon as he reached Wade’s side and carded his fingers into Wade's. He confidently stated, “
As Tony’s words hit him, Steve’s heart constricted and he looked down at the top of Peter’s head. He loved that everyone fawned over Peter but since they settled at the Tower no one had ever asked Steve how he was doing. As he thought on it, he never realized how much things had been weighing on him until that moment. All those fears suddenly welled up to the surface and came flowing out as soon as he opened his mouth.
“Oh, no, you don’t,” Peter hissed and tugged the symbiote back. Peter fell back from the inertia but he was able to get it away from Wade. They crumbled together on the ground.
Steve all but ran back to his bedroom and locked the door behind him. Without turning from the door, he started cursing to himself, “Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.”
The windows had been blown out in the bedroom as well and and the curtains fluttered loudly with a cold wind as they entered the room.
Peter’s heart skipped a beat when he felt the hot tongue inside of him. His hands dug into Wade’s flesh a little tighter and his breath seized. He didn’t know how to respond. His first incoherent thoughts were:
They eventually found Clint. The archer was surprised to see Wade but was fine with him joining in. No one was paying much attention to the lesser known Avenger and Peter felt safe enough to play with him.
have joined up with their team and added in their two cents for the best ways of dealing with Hydra or SHIELD.
“Yes, it builds endurance, but he is not late often. I should blame you or Tony for that,” Natasha stated, walking up to his side.
Steve let him lay there for a few moments but, eventually, he stated, “…The hologram I saw…when I woke, you were searching the city for him…weren’t you?” Steve so badly wanted to comfort him more but they needed to keep on track. Peter needed them and they needed to focus on their son and not their own turmoil…
He took out his newest suit, the Mark 17. He called the suit "Heartbreaker", because of its oversized chest RT, that fired more powerful blasts than his older models could handle. It could fire narrow or wide beams and could also generate a Repulsor Shield for protection. It was all he would need to deal with any rouge Hydra agents that happened to be guarding the Winter Soldier.
Tony was tense in his embrace and Steve was deathly afraid to look at him. His gaze bored into the ceiling as he frantically wondered what to do.
way. It reminded him of those sappy romances that he never thought possible. But here stood Steve, flushing madly and smiling at him with that small cute but nervous smile.
“I…I felt your arousal,” Peter murmured, keeping his eyes on the sky in order to avoid Wade’s gaze. “I’m not used to that…”
Since he’d taken down his tent in the morning, he had absolutely no where to retreat for privacy and he started to crave it as the stares around him grew.
As he rode over the Brooklyn Bridge into Manhattan, night finally settled and the city was aglow with its sparkling electric lights. Traffic was much denser as he approached the tower and he carefully weaved in and out of the trafficked vehicles. A few of the local taxi drivers, who dealt with the commuters around the Tower, recognized him and called out to or waved to him. He responded in kind, but his heart was not in it.
Steve hissed in disbelief, grasping Bucky tightly. With a strangled voice, he gasped, "You can't -!"
Metal shudders started to close over the windows, as Jarvis stated, “Sir, a projectile has breached the building.”
The Soldier felt his entire body shiver as if it was plunged into cold water. But, what really stood out to him was the way his heart seemed to stop beating upon hearing the name. It clenched tightly in his chest and stole his breath.
Harry had reached out to open the door to the penthouse but he stilled upon Peter’s question. Harry frowned at his hand then looked to Peter with a complex expression.
Steve drew back and looked down at the metal appendage in horror. He gasped, “What happened to you?”
“I’m looking into apartments in Brooklyn right now,” Steve stated. He and Peter were currently staying in a nearby hotel. Steve was uncomfortable returning to the bugged apartment SHIELD had given him. It was hard finding a place now that he was so well known but now that he had a child to care for he had to limit his search further. Steve murmured, “I just haven't found one yet.”
Thor’s grin widened and he replied, “Strengthen your stance and know that fear you will feel is merely an uncontrollable reaction to Mjölnir’s immortal power.”
Without questioning Tony’s ire, Clint moved his holo-screen to the passenger seat. Brock’s scared face filled the screen. Clint had already briefed the young man on the situation. He knew his and Peter’s experiment had disobeyed Peter and would not come off.
Tony eyed his outstretched hand for a long moment then grasped it, shaking it in acceptance. He murmured, “No problem, Terminator.”
“Oh God, we did, didn’t we?” Steve gasped, burying his face into one of his hands. Tony threw back his head and laughed and Steve watched him with an amused smile and then looked to his son, who was looking at the both of them with an exasperated grin.
Peter’s eyes sparkled and replied with as much conviction, “Me too…” He looked back down at his phone and murmured, “What should I write?”
“Hmmm,” Tony murmured thoughtfully. “I think I finally figured out what to do for Project Winterwidow Part Four…”
Tony’s eyes were dark and glassy and their depths flickered like a candle when Steve’s eyes locked with his.
By the tone of his voice, Steve was reminded of the vultures and guessed one of them wanted a close up. Steve tilted his head away so they could not get any good photos of him. Making up his mind quickly, he nodded to the kettle, and said, “Just give me whatever tea you have on the pot.”
Venom regarded him with renewed interest. The beast was indeed large…deliciously large. So much mass…so much
Clint slowly put his phone away and whispered, “This is against orders, if Coulson ever found out-.”
He knelt down but made no move to pick it up instead leaned forward pressing his face to Steve’s crotch. Steve’s hand immediately reached out to the wall for support as Tony teased him to full staff.
When he woke out of his stupor, Pep and Sam were the only other ones in the room. Pepper grabbed his hand as soon as he was awake and whispered, “Hey, how are you feeling?”
Steve dragged his fingers through Tony’s hair and stared into his hazel eyes, reassuring himself this man was indeed alive.
Peter’s mouth had fallen open into the shape of a perfect “O” and his eyes were open just as wide and sparkling with excitement. He had seen the Avengers fight on TV countless times but he had never before witnessed the feats of their power in person.
Bucky grunted and pushed Tony to the ground to latch onto Steve. His grip grew lax almost as soon as he grabbed him. He slid down and Steve guided him to the ground.
The Commandos laughed at them and teased Jim about his messy hair but Tony didn’t really listen. He was reminded of Bucky’s early death and the sad melancholy that accompanied this fact felt like it weighed heavier on his shoulders.
“No one would fucking listen to me!” Wade angrily countered. The outburst seemed to have shocked Peter silent and Wade sighed sadly. He gently grasped Peter’s hands and explained, “They all thought I was lying when I said your life was in danger! They were my tenth stop! Even mi familia de X Force rolled their eyes at me. They thought we were just having relationship problems and I was being overdramatic!! I was desperate!” Wade grasped Peter’s arm and whispered, “I tried to save you myself, baby boy, but they were too strong for me…I cannot survive losing you again…” Wade embraced Peter and buried his face into Peter’s shoulder as he gasped in a broken voice, “I can’t…”
Two women stood together on one side of the lab, watching the news through a computer. They both looked up upon his entrance and Peter saw recognition and shock flicker through both of their gazes.
Tony picked his face off Steve’s chest and squinted open his eyes to glare at Steve. He groaned, “I will never get used to this ungodly hour. The Army is Hell. Pure and simple.”
“I can’t do this,” Tony gasped. He wanted a scotch instead. Scotch is good. Scotch does not get mad at you or is upset about being related to you. Scotch is only your friend, your amazingly, drinkable friend who makes you feel like you are on top of the world after enough sips.
“You are not going to in a long time,” Steve stated. He drew Tony’s soiled shirt over his head then tossed it on the floor. It took Tony a moment to realize what he meant.
Steve turned on his side, keeping Tony’s hand in his, and faced his boyfriend. Tony’s arc reactor cast enough light for them to see each other and he met his tired hazel gaze easily. Steve smiled sadly at him and whispered, “No, you’re not…”
With a happy laugh, he ran through the open gates and to the main door to the house. He went to open it, but the doorknob was ripped from his grip before he got the chance and Steve’s gaze suddenly locked with a familiar dark blue gaze he thought he’d never see again.
Natasha shook her head, lightly running her fingers through his hair, and murmured, “He needs more time to heal and remember.”
Coulson did not realize how big of a problem he had, because when he hit the ignore button, on the other side of the world, Tony Stark’s eyes narrowed with suspicion as his call was rejected. He slipped the phone back into his pocket and announced, “Jarvis, we’ve got some hacking to do.”
Steve’s heart clenched and he tightened his arms around Tony to keep him in his embrace. Such a move on Tony’s part made him extremely tempted to let him sleep a little bit longer in his embrace. If it had been a normal day, Steve would have let him...
?!” Tossed gasped. Damn, damn, damn he screwed up. He stated, “Have I ever mentioned how much I love you?”
Did he feel Steve’s erection? Steve crossed his legs and his genitals felt like they were being crushed between two ton weights.
Steve’s fingers dug into the flesh of his knees. He hoped all Ben prophesied was true and Ben’s wisdom did not fail him now.
The Red Skull took off his belt and Steve tensed, readying himself for more pain. Steve expected him to hit him with it but Schmidt wrapped it around Steve’s upper left arm tightly. He locked it on his arm, cutting off the blood flow. His arm twinged with discomfort and his fingers prickled slightly from his blood being cut off.
“The Palladium is the root of the problem,” Howard stated without falter. “So we just need to pull out the weed and replace it with a healthier alternative.”
Natasha ran to the edge and snapped her hook onto the railing before jumping over. Her tether whined as it quickly unfurled and Natasha was smirking to herself.
Tony leaned up and pressed a hard kiss into his mouth. Steve curled over him and dug his fingers into Tony’s flesh as their kisses grew more wild and enthusiastic.
Steve went to get up but Wade stood and hastily said, “Doc said you shouldn’t be moving too much, Steve. I’ll get it! I’m getting something unhealthy for Peter but what do you want, Steve? Stark?”
Last, but not least, he tucked his shield under his undershirt. He cringed as the metal chilled his skin further. He would have to walk with a hunch until the Americans took him but, once with them, he could straighten and look like he had a potbelly.
Peter had been listening to all of Wade’s one-liners for the last couple of minutes but this one made him nearly snort his drink. In response, Wade continued, “If you were a booger, I’d pick you first.”
“Lower your weapon, boss” Natasha growled, ignoring Steve and Clint’s exchange and stepping closer to Bucky.
Could Peter’s fear activated something within him? Bruce turned into the Hulk when angered what happened to Peter when he was scared? Fear was just as strong of an emotion as anger. He looked fine but what if changes were occurring on the inside? What if his body was tearing itself apart?
The hearing moved on and the prosecution stated their reasons Steve’s bail should be revoked, “Steven Rogers has the backing of a multi-billionaire, he is known to frequently leave the country, he has few ties to the community, and he has connections to
Wade smiled wobbly at him and threw himself at Peter. Peter was still sitting on a lab stool so he was much shorter than usual therefore Wade’s arm went around Peter’s head and Peter buried his face into Wade’s stomach.
The suit opened and he jumped inside as Jarvis stated, “The agent mentioned the disbanded Nazi branch: Hydra.”
Steve bought a vanilla cone for himself, in case Peter did not like the strawberry flavor, but he absolutely loved it. Bruce also got a chocolate cone for himself. The three of them sat on a secluded bench overlooking the walking path and watched the people go by as they enjoyed their dessert.
There was a bell on the door that clanged, announcing his arrival to the employees. The front of the store was all windows and made the tiny store bright enough that Peter felt comfortable leaving his sunglasses on. A man came out of the back and called out, “Hello, how can I help you?”
