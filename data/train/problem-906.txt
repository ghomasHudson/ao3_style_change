"I love that you've been thinking of me, Louis but I'm fairly certain that it's not in the fashion I would like to imagine." There was a gentle humor in the words.
“Yes, of course.  The fall having occurred so close in proximity to my own self I was unsurprisingly the first on the scene.” Then with a very blatantly acted purse of his lips—those full perfectly sculpted lips—the man turned and brought a thin hand to his chin like some wizened professor stroking a beard that wasn’t there, and he added, “I take it then from your response that you are from America, New York or Los Angeles perhaps?  Although you speak with a hint of a creole accent—New Orleans then.  And I wonder, what brings you to London?  You seem to have an affinity for old books and reading, a man that keeps to himself but his eyes on everything else.”  There was more but it seemed that the man swallowed it.  His mind gave a small tweet of the comment that had almost escape, squelched by his better judgment
John’s eyes went wide and glaring.  He blinked a few times and tried to stifle the laughter, as mockingly he pointed at Louis, and chided, “You’re a fucking loon, that’s what you are.”
Sherlock felt his breath hitch and his abdominals tense, as he resisted the need to look up into the eyes above him.  He focused his energy on finding a reason, understanding this turn of events, motives, intentions, desires…and then the fingers caught his chin and forced his face upwards.  His shocked wide eyes narrowed onto the dark blue saturnine depths of the doctor looming over him, startled, confused, fighting arousal, blushing, as the blooming warmth he remembered so well captured his insides and he realized the idiomatic expression, “butterflies in your stomach”, was a completely justifiable comparison at the moment to the anxiety that gripped his nervous system.
“Do you think that she is in league with Moriarty?” John asked the burning question that Sherlock did not want to think about.
Louis met those roiling eyes, which spoke so much more than his impenetrable mind, and in a calm, pleasant tone, the vampire gave the detective a brief neighborly salutation.  "Good eve, Mr. Holmes.
He nuzzled the femoral artery, his steely arms trapping Sherlock beneath him. Unable to resist any more he struck, head darting in and teeth sinking cleanly into the exposed neck. The first burst of coppery liquid on his tongue shot excruciating pleasure through his being and he ground down hard into his lover. John lapped and suckled at the clean punctures drawing more blood with each swallow.
“Oh, just don’t fall for the same mess again!” She huffed, instantly calming as she returned the smile and prepared another cup of tea for herself. “After all, that one’s taken. There’s a lady in the middle but she’s no good for John.”
"And Lestat is one of the most powerful?" the detective asked.  The books had laid this out plainly for any reader, but many had been written by the devil himself and give the creature’s insatiable need to gloat, it clouded the clarity of the fact.
They tussled to gain control, swatting and grappling one another, but John was faster and slightly more coordinated, having not indulged in the boozy eggnog as much as some of the others had. Knocking Sherlock's elbows out from under him, he jumped on top of the man, flattening him against the throw rug beneath them with the press of his entire body weight—which in truth was slightly less than the taller detective’s.
The frustration straining almost painfully against his slacks twitched, reminding his easily distracted brain of yet another way the other man left him aching. John hadn’t pushed back yet, hadn’t pulled away from his advances, nor had the vampire reciprocated with the same fever of their original encounter in his mind palace. The atmosphere this time was much the same, except, this time he and John were more keenly aware of the lucid dream state they were sharing. Here, there was no risk of physical harm to either of them. No limitations beyond what their own minds and mutual desires could conjure.
Sherlock had left Baker Street. He had guesses to what had happened but there were other factors that demanded his attention. Matters that meant his own life as well as even bigger stakes should he put the greater need after his own selfish desire to take care of his inept little brother. Even now, the vehicle they traveled in was returning, not to his temporary home but to one of his offices. The explosion had to be explained to those he reported too. Multi-million-dollar mansions belonging to top government agents simply don’t blow up without everyone having an enquiry.
His remark was purposely hurtful but Molly had earned the biting remark with her pitiful attempt to elicit some sort of emotional response from him. That the woman should even consider he was not attempting to find John in spite of his displeasure with the man’s new romance was beyond ignorance. Her general stupidity he was usually able to overlook as she did often play a beneficial role in his ability to access hospital resources, but he had learnt all he was going to from this evenings interaction.
David didn’t move in reaction to the doctor’s violent rise in temper.  His caramel orbs rolled back slightly, his face taking on a bored expression, as he leveled the shorter man with a look John was more familiar with Sherlock giving him, “John, she’s dead, so obviously she was not a part of it.”
Blackness surrounded him.  There was not a single light on in the flat.  The only light came in from the street lamps outside.
Sherlock was thrown back, either by the force of the punch or by John himself. His backside hit the tiled floor hard and skittered to a stop several feet back, knocking over a couple chairs in the process. Screams filled the air, followed by a torrent of rushing bodies, as the patrons attempted to escape what they surely could not comprehend.  The two vampires were brawling despite the crowd, a blur of explosive power that flashed about the café like a tornado, destroying everything it touched.  People were scrambling to flee, some getting caught in the wake of destruction.  Sherlock pushed himself back wanting to stay out of the melee, when a hand grabbed his arm.
The vampire slowly came to a stop on the sidewalk, watching the pressurized gush of the water try its best to remove the dark scarlet stain from the cement.  The worker gave him nothing more than a questioning glance askance, his mind drumming out his perception on having a 'watcher' as he worked as clearly as a police car's siren wailed its presence.  The immortal had the collar of his jacket turned up and his hands were in the pockets, as he tried to observe the scene.  The smell of the blood was still thick in the air, despite the stinging tang of the bleaches vapors and the waters mist, easily detected by his heightened immortal senses.  Both the stench and the size of the bloody mar on the cement hinted that the death had been gruesome.  With the body cleared away already it was hard to ascertain how the individual had died and he doubted he could deduce anything further from what he already had perceived.
John's gaze was just as penetrating, truly acrimonious in countenance.  There was no mistaking his anger, his palpable conviction of injustice and violation.  "Stop looking at me like I am a damn science experiment.  Look at
A much as John longed for the detective to find him it was more perpetuated by his own selfish desire to be free than it was to be with the man.
Lestat was beside him in a flash of unseen movement.  The vampire was kneeling across John’s body from the detective and Sherlock found his wrist in his grip. His icy eyes were filled with genuine concern, as he glanced from his newest fledgling and back.  “He needs blood.” Lestat said, as if asking permission.
“I do not fear for my safety and if you do, Inspector, than you are welcome to accompany me.” The detective snapped contemptuously, narrowing his pale cold gaze on the other man that was openly scrutinizing him.
Sherlock growled low in this throat and he angled his head, exposing even more of his neck. “Harder John,” The order was panted out as heavy-lidded eyes bore into his own. Following the command, John bit down, hard. The detective arched as much as his trapped limbs would allow, a loud moan escaping those lips.
John could hear something else then, a roaring like radio static, that grew loud enough to overcome the pounding. It was a rushing torrent of sounds jumbled all together, moving so fast that he could not make anything out. It was like being immortal again for the first time, that rushing din of voices and thoughts screaming through his brain, before he had learned how to shut them off and tune them out.
The small door they had all come through opened once more and soon the small chapel was filled with the monotone sound of latin prayers being sung. It was a dark sounding rhythmic pattern of song, one step above a chant, sung in a harmonic tenor and baritone—two individuals. The procession slowly came through the door, the duos steps covered by the volume of their synchronized voices. Moriarty was dressed in the holy vestment of an archbishop. The demon’s even steps ruffling the hem of the scarlet cassock, which was topped with a matching mozetta, and the tall diamond shaped mitre sat upon his most unholy brow.
Sherlock wore nothing underneath. He didn’t know why but he found that arousing as hell. Had the man anticipated that this was where things would lead? Of course, he had, the genius nearly always seemed to know just how John would react even before John himself did. He finally managed to tug the slacks free, taking the black socks with them. This left the beautiful man sprawled out, fully nude on the bed. His erection stood at full attention as his hands clenched tightly above his head in self-imposed restraint.
Then the images stopped.  His mind was blank, black, for a long silent moment, filled only with a lingering sense of trepidation.  Then his eyes opened to the warm light of the penthouse suite and Louis was there just above him, body still pressed against his, and on his lips John could see a soft smear of red, before the red tongue darted out and swiped it away.
For the first time since entering this place, John lost himself. He lost control of his mind, of his body, and therefore of his actions as well. The tenuous grip he had on his emotions, on his rage, on his regrets, on his guilt, was let loose—slipping from his hands like the reins of a wild stallion, sure to buck him off, and trample him. He felt his own desire, felt the flames deep inside of himself, licking up from his gullet and searing the back of his throat. He felt his teeth and tongue and lips trailing kisses and nips from the corner of the other man’s mouth, to the turn of his jaw, to the bob of his adam’s apple, and finally to the pulse of the blood in his carotid artery. His breaths came in rapid succession, leaving him fighting for air, as he lavished in the throb of that moving blood against the tip of his tongue and the curve of his mouth, mimicked by the tensing of the man’s arousal against his own.
If he were honest with himself, John was pretty certain that he would have to admit that his brain had been running away to prevent an undesired epiphany.  He did not want to think about Sherlock, or the alley, or 221B—because all of those things had brought back emotions, sensibilities, and sensations that he had long since managed to bury.
John felt the forearm without having seen it.  The concrete appendage had caught him in the neck and remained unmoving as his lightning quick body came to a sudden catastrophic halt.  The pain seared along his windpipe and then his back and shoulders, as the force of the collision whiplashed his body down into the rocky earth.  He felt the ground give way, rocked and stone and tree roots crushing and breaking beneath the weight of the impact, and yet he could feel that his body was still intact.  He lay there but a mere immortal moment, his eyes adjusting to the change of motion, as a fist came into focus.
“Oh!” She squeaked as she looked up into the cerulean eyes of the dazzlingly handsome man who stood on her front step. Smartly dressed in a navy coat with the collar turned up against the wind, a small gust rustled the lions mane of shimmering golden curls which were loosely drawn back into a pony-tail at the base of the slender man’s skull. Sharp and high cheekbones were perfectly cut into the angular face and the glossy pink lips curled seductively into a pleasant smile that caused the older ladies heart-rate to elevate and a flush of color to rise to her blush-applied cheeks.
John yanked on his captured leg. This rash technique only served to ensnare him further. He sighed in annoyance and forced his torso upwards, balancing on the upper half of his back end to reach the sheets that formed his cotton bonds. Once his leg was free, he climbed to his feet and headed straight for the door.
“ Wait...” the word was drawn out, “I thought they were together. The doctor had a woman on the side?” John felt his eyebrows rise in disbelief and Louis’ stern stare reminded him not to get worked up. There was no gain from losing his temper and revealing himself to the two gossiping women.
all along?” John spat, pointing at the so far very quiet and very still figure of the consulting detective the fledgling had just stepped in to protect from his maker.  The younger Holmes remained still, watching and observing, calculating, just as the elder one was from behind his desk.
Then to the inspector’s surprise, the detective did something he least expected.  He straightened, his back going rigid as he squared his shoulders.  In a calm pleading tone, Sherlock Holmes asked him, “Please, Lestrade.”
John could not recall the last time he had read aloud. It made him feel childish and insecure, vulnerable in a way he was unaccustomed to. He reasoned with himself that it was ridiculous to recant now and for such preposterous reasons. Thousands of people had read his blog now. Sherlock had even read them—where he felt he was being terribly maligned and misrepresented.
Francis pulled a long pipe out of his vest and packed it with quick ease before lighting it with a torch. He puffed on it a few times before holding it out courteously. “Lady Jean, would you care to try some? It is a lovely blend that I have specially made.”
“What is the point of this?” In contrast to their position, his voice was calm, resigned. Sherlock’s grip loosened at the words and John relaxed more fully onto the bed, not caring that he was still pinned. “Of you and I being here like this?” he elaborated softly as he looked away from the detective’s intense gaze.
John didn’t have to ask who the note had come from. He could figure it out from all Sherlock had told him of the girl, but the name still passed between them. A whisper that hung in their minds and the detective’s mouth quirked with the recognition he could see on the vampire’s face of this shared connection.
She sat there, the amulet in her delicate white fingers. Her head was bowed, as though she were deep in prayer—which he very much doubted. Her red hair fell over her shoulders, in contrast with the glinting gold that surrounded them, flickering in the sparse candle light that was barely enough to light the room. She was waiting, and Sherlock was certain he knew for whom.
The dreams had been unsettling and the thrashing movement of the swerve even more so. John mustered the resolve to stay awake, yet he couldn’t get the imagery out of his head. The thought haunted him. Perhaps Moriarty had orchestrated it all. The fall, his own death and subsequent resurrection, Mary’s death, and John’s vampirism. What John failed to see was the spider’s end game.  What was the point of it all? Could one really chalk it all up to boredom? Surely no one was honestly that callous.
“Louis, Mrs. Hudson!  The tenant downstairs!  He was just here!  I saw him come in!” his voice was strained and extreme, pervaded with urgency.  He gave only a moment’s hesitation, a quick dart of his tongue across his lower lip, before he amended in a slow measured tone, deep in timbre, “It is of the utmost priority, Mrs. Hudson, that I find that man.”
The knob wiggled and moved, unlatching, and then eerily the door slowly pulled away from the jamb.  At a snail’s pace—typically over dramatic—the door swung open, to reveal the mysterious blond man languishing in a tub full of white sudsy bubbles.  The detectives mind instantly went into overdrive, assessing the scene beheld before him—
“I read the papers.” The remark was snooty and admonishing. “Also, John hasn't posted anything since Sherlock died—er, hold on, I have an idea.” There was the slap of the woman’s hands on the table, as John heard her friend gasp a little and steady the rattling cups. “Let's. Go. To. London!”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes on the man, searching those illuminous orbs for more answers.  He certainly was not bored now.  “And so then why have you come?”
Sherlock whirled back to the door to see nothing more than a shock of black hair and the back of a blue jean jacket, as the woman dashed around the vampire and out into the dark street.  It was clear evasion.  The detective did not hesitate to pursue, John quickly picking up on his cue, but even with the vampire's speed and agility they were unable to locate the girl after they had gotten outside of the cafe.  It was as though she had simply disappeared.
“Ha! 5 Points for me.” He cheered exuberantly, proudly of himself. He threw the next handful of buttery kernels into his own mouth happily.
Frustrated to have a kink in his morning ritual—well, the ritual he would have liked to keep for his mornings, which was in truth always interrupted by something—he stalked into the living room, where the meddling consulting detective was still stretched out on the couch against the far wall.  He peevishly snapped, “The toaster, Sherlock, really?!  Couldn’t you have at least left me the use of the bloody toaster!”
Armand watched the intense figure of the other immortal from the corner of his eye. The rapt attention Louis payed to the performers on the stage below the balcony they occupied was endearing and quirked a smile of satisfaction to the corner of his lips. With perfect pitch and undulation, the final note rang out from the robust Ulisse as the last act of
Two hours later the consulting detective work up, sore, hand burnt where it had grabbed the electrified handle. He was groggy for a few minutes, then impressed, and then disappointed in himself for getting cocky. He went about figuring out and dismantling a few more booby-traps that secured the safe room for the vampire and by the time Sherlock was able to confidently take his first step into the lower flat he had less than an hour and a half left until sunset. The entire lower section of the home seemed to be a massive open concept den and bedroom. There was a low warm light that lit the entire level and travelled up behind bookshelves and from recessed lights. The bed itself was massive and against the farthest wall where the body of John lay prone and motionless in its center.
The answer took Lestat off guard and in his annoyance he strode past David entirely and paused, as his fledgling watched him blatantly snatch a hot beverage from a nearby table where a couple sat cooing at one another.  The immortal’s movement was so fast that neither had a chance to notice.
John must have seen it, if he had been in the flat.  As a vampire now, he must have caught the scent of blood—his blood.  Mrs. Hudson had tried to clean up the mess created by his brawl with the blond vampire, but it was superficial.  With nothing else to occupy his wandering mind the detective set to straightening what was still there, always listening, wondering, and hoping that John would visit.
“No, Louis.” He managed to say, barely above a whisper, as if in the fury of their love-making he had forgotten quite how to speak. This statement deepened the pout as Armand rose and was suddenly standing over the other again. Quickly the look changed to understanding as Armand knelt down to straddle Louis’ midsection once more. The press of the hard cock against his bare backside caused a groan to rise unconsciously from his throat in anticipation, as he began to rock against the other man and resumed the kisses that had started all of their naughty interlude.
“My lady, you appear lonely.” The man held himself with the aloof air of someone who would never lower himself to menial labour. He was thin and tall, but Sherlock still had a couple of inches on him, with pale slicked back hair. “Might I take you for around in the gardens?” The man sounded like a pompous ass.
"Very." she answered bitterly, with a concise nod of her head.  "He has in his possession an ancient artifact that has ability to amplify his telekinetic abilities.  He has been using it of late to bully the other elders into coinciding with his decisions, making it look like a democracy, when it’s all just a facade to hide his own agenda.  I'm not sure what he's trying to attain but it obviously is off the mark to say the least.  It's like he wants to start a damn war or something."
There was movement behind him and Sherlock fought the urge to twist around, to nervously lash out at the other’s departure.  He froze, body half submerged in the water, and listened to the footsteps—not rushed with frustrated haste or the need to escape, but slow and sure.  John’s standing form appeared in the periphery of his vision, blue jeans and dress shirt sleeves rolled up to the elbows.  The man stopped beside the tub, his fingers trailing along the lip of the white ceramic, black blood from the pig outlining his fingernails.
He continued his teasing ministrations across his collarbone, tasting the pale skin, before trailing down the other man’s leanly muscled chest to replace one teasing hand with his mouth. He lapped at the nipple before catching it between his teeth and biting down gently. When Sherlock cried out softly he repeated the action, only this time with more force. Sherlock arched into him in addition to his cry, his hips thrusting hard against John before settling once more into their slow rocking.
“Never stopped.” She confirmed. Her eyes rolled and she tipped her head from shoulder to shoulder in a bobbing motion, as she shrugged and admitted, “Probably never will.”
The cup was hot to the touch, the steam rising from the dark liquid inside evidence enough.  The man pursed his lips and found that his teeth were clenched.  He sighed again, took a cleansing breath, in-out, and sat back in his chair.  He rested his right elbow on the padded arm, his palm caught his chin, and he sat there a moment, his first finger keeping time against his temple with the ticking of the clock on the wall.  He tried to think of work.
Slowly, how, he could not be certain, but the pain began to recede and for once he let the raucous clamor of other’s thoughts fill him. He gorged on it as he had the blood earlier, feeling the physical pain of the attack subside as he was consumed. He listened to the words, the sounds, thankful for their intrusion, when he suddenly realized that he recognized them—all of them.
Seated in the fine leather of Armand’s Ferrari 458 Spider, Louis met those waiting eyes and smiled warmly.  He reached across the rest between them and placed his hand over Armand’s.  He felt the fingers beneath his own tense slightly around the gear shift.  “Let us go to Regents Park and enjoy the moonlight through the trees.  I would like nothing more than to smell the wet bark and soil after being inside for so long.”
“Enlightenment, John,” Sherlock said simply. He finally turned, jumping down from the sofa and stepping over the low coffee table to stand beside the doctor. “Lestat explains as much as is known about your species. In this case, it has brought an important fact to my attention.” The man paused in his explanation. “Moriarty was aided or possibly aligned with a demonic force while we were engaged in our little game.”
At this range, the detective could feel the hot moisture of the demon’s breath passing over his skin. The man gave a huffed chuckle of satisfaction and pleasure. It delighted him so to have the detective at his mercy. Without warning, the man’s mouth opened wide, revealing teeth that were suddenly razor sharp needles, clustered together tight and dangerous. The tongue in his mouth snaked out, elongated and skinny, with a reptilian fork at the end. The flat awful thing reached out towards his face and Sherlock steeled himself, forbidding any movement or cringe. He could not give in to this torture. It was what the madman wanted, to see him helpless and squirming, the thrill of it would only fuel his pleasure and feed his demonic nature. The tongue pressed roughly against his chin, pulling upwards over his lips and mouth to flick the end of his nose. This repeated several more times, slow and terrible. The demon’s eyes closed with indulgence, moans of erotic pleasure rumbling from the man’s throat, as the blood was licked clean from Sherlock’s mouth and chin
John smiled again.  It was not because he was pleased to see the man, in his light grey bespoke suit.  “Isn’t that just pants.  Of course…it’s Mycroft
The detective pulled his head back, letting it flop back against the arm of the couch, exposing the pale length of his throat and the torn front of his shirt.  “Jesus, Sherlock!” he cursed, as he realized the front of the man’s shirt was covered in dark speckles of blood.  He reached out a hand and flicked the front over, noting considerable bruising towards his left flank and more spatters of dried black blood.  There were more bruises and scrapes on his chin and the right side of his jawline—all of it was more than Lestrade could handle.  “What the bloody hell have you been up to?”
Sherlock walked away from the table, his trailing fingers grasping the corner of a stack of papers and file folders.  He flung the mass with a sharp violent thrust of his arm and the papers noisily flapped to the floor behind him as he left the kitchen.  His limbs lazily carried him into the parlor, like a skiff drifting from its moorings in an ever growing sea of chaos.  He found himself at the desk, his eyes cast down at the closed lid of his laptop.  There was a stack of papers here too, another of the coffee table by the couch, more tacked to the wall above it.  All of them were useless.  Proffered him no gain.
"W-Why shouldn't I?" It was a pathetic retort and came out with all a degree of petulance he wasn't aware of possessing.
A female body moved in front of him like a protective shield.  Red hair fell from over her shoulders and fierce blue eyes narrowed at him, as she chided, “I swear, I can’t take you anywhere.”
John looked miserable. His pallid skin was stony and grey, becoming more translucent as he lost blood. The front of his torso was a slick mess of deep alizarin crimson. It soaked into the jeans, until the dense fabric could hold no more. It dripped onto the floor, marring the beauty of this holy place. Sherlock had seen terrible things done by depraved people but never had the horror of blood on a body been as disturbing as it was now, on John. His John.
Cautiously, John uncovered his eyes, just enough to peer up at the detective. Those eyes were blazing brightly with self-gratitude. It was an expression John was overly familiar with. They were lit with the same fire as when he had proven a theory of his right. Before John could figure out what the madman had figured out, Sherlock pressed his open mouth against John’s.
With the other immortal frozen in his grasp Lestat gently began to escalate the wayward adventures of his hands over the other’s still hard form.  His gloved fingers trailed from the man’s throat, where his lips pressed lingering caresses and his teeth soft teasing nips, down the lean length of his torso, slipping under the hem of the dingy worm jumper.  Lestat was not sure that it was possible for Louis to tense more within his ravishing clutches, yet there was a renewed tautness to all the muscles of his being.  He could feel the clench of the other’s jaw, the bob of his adams apple, the grind of his molars, as his one arm entangled the ebony haired man’s waist and forcefully drew their two body’s together.
The spent vampire let his body go loose against the finely crafter seats of the car. He had never felt exhaustion like this before and his medical training made him wonder if a mortal even could. His entire body pulsed with bone grinding ache that seemed to resonate through his muscles and joints.  It felt like blood pumping continuously through his circulatory system and after a moment of deliberation he supposed that it might very well be the case. His body was working as hard as it could to make up for the trauma he had sustained. He cursed himself for finding his unnatural strength and resilience absurdly fascinating.
“It was no problem, Mrs. Hudson. Simply good timing.” Louis smiled at his landlady, her eyes turning away suddenly as she blushed a little and scooped back up her bags.
“I will start throwing things over the balcony!” John raged, pointing at the elaborate glass doors that led outside.
The vomit had been cleaned away and on the night stand by the bed there was a fresh towel and a fresh pitcher of water in the basin.  The door to the bedroom was closed and slowly he crawled from the bed.  He was still naked, had been wrapped in the plaid blanket like a cocoon, and when he stood up the detective took the time to stretch out his tired cramped muscles.  Then he poured a little of the cold water into the basin and cupping his hands splashed a some on his face.  If felt incredible.  Wetting the cloth, he swiped the grime from his face and neck, working over his entire body to rid himself of the sticky sweat.  By the end he was chilled by the cool air in the room and the cold water but his skin was pink from scrubbing and he smelled slightly better.  Lastly, he bent over the basin and poured the remaining water over his head, working it through his tangled mop, massaging his temples and his scalp, before toweling off.
“That’s it?” Sherlock’s question sounded pathetic in his own ears, he was hoping for more information on the artifact and so he tried again. “What about this artifact?”
Sherlock hunched his shoulders as he walked down the cold London streets, the mizzle from the afternoon now a full on drizzle that had wet his hair and the shoulders of his jacket.  The detective had stepped out of the flat to stretch his legs and take a distracting but necessary bathroom break—he still refused to enter the bathroom in the Baker Street flat, the memories of his last few encounters with John there too powerfully disabling to chance.  His feet moved over the cement below him at a swift pace, pushed to return home to the dry confines of his parlor, even though the man was sure he would only find more disappointment upon his return.
"Coherently isn't the word that I would use to describe it." John said, with a small smile.  "Your thoughts are loud, fast, and they layer up over top of one another until it's just a blaring noise.  I can't concentrate or think myself when you get into something that you're really working on."
They, like so many of their kind, did have a rather sorted and difficult history. Filled with past slights and peppered with rare but pleasant segments of time. It was those kinder times that would so often linger in the older vampire’s mind when he was feeling want to reminisce. Not an activity that was habit, as so very few times in his long past were not fraught with some form of turmoil and strife. It was one reason why he gravitated towards the raven-haired younger vampire, for after the scales were balanced he found more pleasure in this one mans company than in many of the others whom he had known over the centuries.
Of course he had seen the flowers when he had burst out of the bedroom in search of the bloody phone, but he had not really seen them.  His gaze focused in on them, as he took the few steps he needed to reach the table on which they sat in their pretty vase, perfectly arranged.  The bouquet was quite elaborate, filled to the brim with many different blossoms and lush greenery.  There were many large silken tulips.  He reached out a shaking hand, poking past something that looked like eucalyptus, and his fingers stroked the soft outer shell of the dark purple tulip closest—Mary loved tulips.
Between one blink and the next John found himself pressed back into the wall with Sherlock looming darkly over him. He didn’t speak or move immediately. He didn’t do anything other than stare silently down at John, his expression an icy mask that showed absolutely nothing. John’s anger broke free and he didn’t think, just reacted.
John turned, looking up the stocking clad legs, the dark skirt, to the teal blouse, and the blond curls of Mary. She held an umbrella over her head and slightly towards him, to shield both of them from the torrent of water falling from the black sky. Her trench coat was getting soaked, the long hem dripping with the sopping downpour. Her face was pinched, disapproving.
Even though he found himself drawn to stare at the way the man’s thin fingers raced across the keyboard or the way his teeth ground down over his full bottom lip, he moved passed this, walking briskly into the kitchen.  The vampire was ignored, as he anticipated that he would be, and he came to look over the man’s shoulder at what he was so feverishly researching.  The screen was a mass of open browser tabs, thick with volumes of text, and scant on pictures, making it damn near impossible for him to decipher how or what this had to do with their current mission.
Sherlock did not move.  This was quite possibly the closest John had willing come to him without some ulterior motive of restraining or removing him.  The answer was clear enough and he had not thought to remove his scent from the room, nor did he have any means of doing so.  As he was lost in this contemplation, he felt a hand come to the collar of his dress shirt.  As their eyes met yet again, John quietly asked, "May I?", as his fingers hovered over the top button.
John stopped then, chest heaving. His own injuries had already miraculously healed through the power of the blood that ran through his veins, but the wet blood remained on his lower face, a grizzly reminder of the destruction wrought there. His maker lay unmoving beneath him, his bruised face slowly washing back to the pale perfect white. John had effectively accomplished nothing, even though he had used all his effort to damage that super-model face. Lestat’s eyes were closed and there were streaks of blood running from the corners of his eyes and into the mussy golden curls.
The detective rushed inside, ignoring the blond beast who was making a show of dabbing his lips with a cloth, as he rushed within. Keeping the blond in his peripheries the long legs carried him swiftly into the space and rounding the back of the settee, he saw a man was laying prone. John’s eyes were closed and his face rather tranquil despite the glaring contrast of his bloody torn shirt. It was obvious that he was breathing easily and it was confounding to witness the doctor so reposed, as though in sleep, without the slightest sign of trauma or harm despite all visual evidence to the contrary.
By this time Sherlock had gone thoroughly mad.  Marisa was growing increasingly short with him.  She spent more and more time away and the detective spent more and more time looking for her.  For how small the island was it was amazing how elusive the small ornithologist could be.  It was childish, like a game of hide and seek, but it gave the man something to do, something to occupy his mind.  She would rise before dawn, slipping out in the darkness, and even when he woke to watch her path through the window, she seemed to lose him.
He scrubbed the thought, as the creature continued, “What if I could show you what you cannot remember?”
“Likely correct, Lestat, but I don’t see how you lose anything by telling me about what happened when you first encountered Moriarty. In fact, I think you should be more concerned with him then with your latest fixation.” David was trying to be mindful to not use his scolding tone of voice but his makers reaction was much the same as if he had.
“She did, did she?  Hmmm.” The dark haired detective answered, musingly, as his head returned to its previous position, hands still steepled in thought.
John glanced back over his shoulder at the counter, drawing Sherlock’s own gaze.  A young woman was placing an order, with two men in tow behind her.  The detective could see that there was some kind of connection there.  When the girl saw John, her green eyes went wide with surprise and her cheeks flushed, yet the vampire had already turned back.  “Damn, it’s a bloody small world.” He muttered.
He was back to Sherlock again. Why had the detective done what he did? He had to care. Right? Otherwise, he wouldn’t have instigated anything. John didn’t think that he would willingly jeopardize their friendship for no reason. No. While on several occasions he had strained their friendship, he had never stepped over that last line. So, for some reason, Sherlock in his infinite wisdom had decided that their shagging wouldn’t destroy their friendship.
The problem was the plausible fictional cover that the vampires had erected around the memoirs of Louis and his maker, Lestat. As well as those that followed afterwards. Sherlock knew now that these books were his true resource regarding the Talmasca. Unfortunately, of the books, he profited little from their knowledge. It was all second-hand information, one’s view and opinion of the organization, and not true information about the order itself.
Their shouts mingled with the copper taste that still lingered in Sherlock’s mouth as they froze. Each relished and basked in the feel of the other man, the remembered passions of all their times before bleeding into this new experience. Sherlock was the one to end their stolen moment in time. His hips shifted as his legs coiled around John’s waist. He pulled John to him, grasping him with tightly with arms and legs, head bowing into the curve of the other man’s shoulder as though refusing to ever let go.
The taller man spun at the sound of his name, the supple material of his expensive jacket flaring out dramatically and the detective stalked towards him. His eyes were bright and menacing as they zeroed in on him as he scowled darkly. “What do you want, John?” The question was harshly spoken as he narrowed the distance between them.
Sherlock could see the transition. He could see the mask of a soldier about to go into battle take over the rage that had burned there only seconds before. This was a battle unlike anything the two of them had experienced before. They were as ready as they could be.
“And you have.” Sherlock confirmed, “She told me that she met you once when you were first dating Mary. As I understand, they were not on the best of terms, so it was no doubt a very brief meeting.”
John released a ragged breath, as the sensation of the detective’s mouth over took his thoughts and senses.  His hands balled into fists at the back of the other man’s head, following the movement as his mouth worked up and down the length of his cock.  The doctor was hardly breathing, lost in the pleasure of the detective’s ministrations.  He let his head fall back, feeling himself mutter his name through a strangled moan.  Sherlock gripped him around the base, beginning to move his hand in rhythm with his mouth, drawing John ever closer to a climax.  When the air was rent by a muffled ringtone.
The detective’s dark head rested on the back of the low cushion of the large chair, the previous tension melted from his slack features, his eyes peacefully closed. His hands were folded neatly over his chest, which rose and fell with the steady inhales and exhales of his breathing. He breathed in through his nose, and upon exhalation, the breath was pushed through his full lips, making an odd rumble that was faint and most certainly could not be categorized as a snore. The sod had fallen asleep!
Sherlock was brilliant, there was no doubt about it. His mind was sharp and frustratingly secured against Lestat’s invasion. A rare quality in a mortal but given the particular character of this man, was not entirely unsurprising to the vampire who relished in the knowledge that he was one of the most powerful of their kind. There were others, of course but regardless, he suspected they would encounter the same should they try to enter into the mind of the closely guarded genius.
Greg didn’t look as great as the last time John had seen the inspector and that had been outside of the Baker Street flat, assessing the bloodied body on their door step.  He looked weary and worn out.  Too many late nights and cigarettes.  He smelled as such too.  The strong odor of the stale smoke and beer was overwhelming, making it hard for John to stay focused on acting human.  Again, Joh could hear Louis’ caution in his ear.  It only made him focus harder.
The momentary hesitation ended and was replace with a vexing lust that doubled the ache in his heart and loins.  John lunged at him, decided and focused, violently ripping the detective’s shirt open. Sherlock’s surprise melded into a groan, as those familiar lips assaulted his collar, blazing a hot trail down his chest. The flick of wet tongue across his nipple followed by a gentle bite left him gasping.
“Now that I have you here it is customary that I seduce you.” He went about pouring a rich amber colored liquor from the crystal decanter on his side table into the short glass that was obviously meant for no other purpose in it's placement.
"With who?" Sherlock was very interested now in the supernatural politics of this underworld so closely knit with their own.
Closing his eyes tightly, Sherlock’s head dipped, sagging between his shoulders. A long, aggravated sigh left his lungs. Then it came. “It was my fault, John. I could have prevented all of this months ago.” It was a guilt-stricken admission that not even John had anticipated from the mad genius.
Fisting the sheets in his hands he pulled at them to stop himself from forcing that exquisitely talented mouth onto his erection. Oh, how he wanted to though. He couldn’t stop his rhythmic pumping as the detective continued his ministrations. He felt on fire, his entire body tense as waves of pleasure crashed over him.
“She explained that they were aware but not of the perpetrator.” David replied, “The Talmasca was watching Lestat, hardly ever stop, but they simply did not have the access to your property.”
Mycroft’s head fell back as the vampire pressed one finger into the man. This made David’s smile quirk and his eyes darkened with lust.  He worked a slow pattern, each twist and gentle thrust making Mycroft pant and moan.  A sharp gasp of breath as a second finger joined the preparations and the vampire’s own erection was beginning to strain against the constraints of his jeans.  The other man’s own need was just as apparent, his erection flexing upwards as if pleading to be taken.
John gasped, the man’s wet fingers gliding over his cock in a deliberately slow pace and he began to lightly thrust against John’s ass. The feel and friction sent shudders racking his body and he lowered his arms until he was braced on his elbows, head bowing as he tried to breathe through the waves of pleasure.
John cried out again dropping once more to his elbows as he buried his face into the sheets. He couldn’t think. Pleasure and pain coiled inside John as Sherlock thrust deeper and harder. “Sherlock!” He cried out as Sherlock clung to his hip, nails biting harshly into him.
The consulting detective steeled himself against the ardent temptation of doing any such thing.  John had yet to contact him since the incident and, being his own efforts to resurrect their former lifestyle and relationship had thus far only proven ill-fated and destructive, sound logic would suggest that it would be best if he left the next attempt up to the doctor—even if the wait was killing him.  John did have a lot to sort out.
Louis spotted the figure of the elderly land lady, arms heavy with the burden of bags as he pulled up to the front of the flat. As soon as she had saw the expensive car roll to a stop in front of the flat, almost as if on que the bottom of a bag let loose and sent a cascade of oranges rolling down the step as she let out a string of curses and tried to rescue the remainder of her items while fighting with the house keys. Louis was out of the car and had gathered up most of the fallen fruit while the woman’s back was turned and as she dropped the rest of the bags in the entrance with a disgusted huff, she turned to collect her fallen groceries.  She let out a startled yelp at the smiling man on the ste, arms full of oranges.
Unable to find a solution and not feeling the sensation any longer Sherlock cursed under his breath and gave an aggravated sigh that more closely resembled a growl.  He stalked over to John, grabbed the man's shoulders, and drawing him close, whispered in his ear, "Did you feel it?"
Cautiously he came through the door, fully prepared for anything or anyone that might greet him, only to find a man reclining comfortably in John’s chair.  Seeing another body occupying the doctor’s favored seat made a billowing rage bloom within the detective’s chest—a sensation both foreign and shocking, that was barely quelled without any visible physical manifestation of the reaction on his person.  The reeling mind of the quick-witted detective was refocused through analysis.  Dark raven hair was loose, hanging straight, framing a pale face with a straight nose and striking emerald orbs that glistened an unearthly hue in contrast to the dark lashes and brows surrounding them.  It was his neighbor, the tenant of 221C.  In the second that it took to observe the man’s features, identity, and purpose, he had also evaluating much more from this strange visitor.
John shrugged his shoulders and turned to answer his friend, only to find that he was gone.  The only one left in the kitchen within was the dead pig.  “Sherlock…?”
—and when he opened it his mind was inundated with information.  The bed was before him, against the wall, nightstands on either side, white metal frame—
Mrs. Hudson came to the door and he was relieved to hear the lock slide back before she opened it.  Again they exchanged polite salutations before he followed the woman into 221A, where she already had a pot of tea steeping on the kitchen table.  He took off his coat and shoes, taking a seat at the table, as she poured him a cup.  The note and the post card were out on the table.
The vampire looked unsettled and Sherlock attempted to reign back his mental hypotheses to see if it lightened the mood any.  John sighed again, this time attempting to reply, but obviously guarding his words, "Sherlock, I really don't wanna get into it now."
“Oh, Mr. Holmes!” the man bellowed, with a guffaw laughter, “You have hit the nail right on the head!”  The triumphant demeanor melted away to reveal a dramatically saddened visage, as he whispered, “But still I fear you do not believe me.”  He paused and his lips moved from a pouting frown into wan smile.  “And it is far more entertaining to watch that little brain of yours whir about trying to concoct a logical explanation.  I will give you a small piece of advice.  Forget the logical and use your gut, hmm.”
Sherlock raised his hands in a plaintive posture, asking for some reason from his friend and time to explain.  "There is no need to yell, John, I’m right here. Your volume is piercing. "
He needed to get dressed and out, he needed to feed. The hunger was beginning to burn inside of him, consuming more and more of his thoughts with each second that ticked by. What he wanted to do however had nothing to do with leaving this room. Hell, it had nothing to do with leaving this bed for that matter. He turned fully away from the temptation sprawled out like a feast, feet touching down on the cool wooden floor as he prepared to vacate the room.
The same creeping feeling from the ally began to prickle at the back of his neck, descending over him, similar to how long-surviving prey animals could sense the predators that frequently stalked them. It was clearly not the first time Sherlock had felt watched by someone whom he was quite certain wished him harm in some fashion, but outside the ally, this was the only other time he had ever felt a particular unnerving uncertainty about it.
He managed a weak smile, before she added, to all present, “Well, as much as I wanna’ stay and see you three off, I really should split.”
Two more days passed like this and they never spoke to one another.  Not really.  There was the odd nonverbal nod or wave.  Nothing else was needed.  She did her duty.  Fed him, cleaned up after him, and the like, and spent the rest of her time away.  The detective slept more than was his habit, finding himself winded and exhausted with little exertion, but each day he grew stronger and slowly his energy reserves were returning to a moderately tolerable level.  Before they both knew it, a week had past, and still the vampire did not return.
The yellow hand towels of dear Mrs. Hudson had been stained crimson, nearly black in places where the old dried blood had been cleaned away from the wound before John’s expert hands had taken to his skin with a needle and thread.  The movement of the needle passing smoothly through his skin was dulled to an uncomfortable tingle thanks to John’s on hand medical supplies, freeing more than just the pain.  Words and phrases came tumbling out, mostly tangled and incoherent, even though he still felt he was in complete control of his faculties as he did so.  The concern on his friend’s face transitioned to that baffled smile, accompanied by a ruddy color that rose on the sandy blonde’s cheeks, which made a warmth bloom within the detective’s gut.  The warmth had been addicting, a sensation that once experienced was consuming, which Sherlock hated to have dwindle and disappear.  Yet this had not been as stimulating as it had been to feel his mouth pressing firmly against the doctor’s, as his arms entangled the man greedily, wrestling the other down into the hot water of the bath he had been cleansing in.  Both soaked and cramped within the confines of the ceramic tub John had relented his struggles to Sherlock’s advancing touch, to the rapid aggression of his hands, mouth, and thrusts.
The cold air of the evening was a welcome reprieve to his heated body.  His skin and head felt like they were burning.  It wasn’t sickness that caused it, although he may have welcomed that at the moment.  It was the agitation of mounting failure.
The other man looked considerate for a moment, weighing his reply, as he casually leant on the doorframe. “I hate to admit it, but I’m afraid I don’t know the answer to either of those questions quite yet.” He added becoming animated with his next exclamation, “But that’s exactly why I have
“It is a stretch.  We have no evidence to suggest that Moriarty is linked to the Talmasca in the least.” Mycroft scoffed, made even more irritable with this new information.  “It’s still something to throw to Sherlock that would keep him relatively safe.”
His eyes had changed too. He had always likened the coloring to that of a mud puddle, dark blue around the edges but brown from sand and muck in the middle. No one had ever particularly fancied them when he was mortal and now they drew attention like never before, lit from behind the iris, making them almost glow, especially in the darkness of night.
John’s head was spinning by the time Sherlock had finished explaining what exactly he had missed during his immortal slumbering.  It was a lot to take in and the detective had delivered the news in his usual arrogant fashion, assuming that his flat mate would be able to keep up with the spider’s web of deductions that he was inferring from small bits and pieces of the proceedings.  John had to stop the man several times and have him reiterate parts in layman’s terms in order to follow the twisted path this plan they were now putting into motion was taking, as well as to take a breather from the rash of migraines that plagued John when Sherlock’s feverish mind was at work.
Mycroft reached out his hand and offered the creature the seat opposite him, politely replying, “No need to hide.  Please, come and sit.”  The man listened, moving to take a seat in the chair, the whole while never allowing his eyes to blink or break from Mycroft’s face.  His head seemed to suddenly ache, a penetrating pull at his temples that almost brought him to wince.  Fighting the sudden, strange discomfort the elder Holmes straightened his jacket and repositioned his hands diplomatically on the desktop, lacing his fingers together.  “I presume you have business, Mr. de Lioncourt.”
The man hated him, for now, for what he had done to his beloved doctor and past lover. That would pass with time, once Sherlock began to truly understand what the dark gift meant for John and for himself, should he be able to eventually turn the man.
The vampire stopped at another crossing and this time he was joined by a grubby elderly woman, who was clearly on the piss, as well as a couple of young fops out on the town.
Lestrade was not so easily dissuade.  Perhaps he had grown accustomed to the detective’s moody tricks.  In a louder voice the inspector went on, voicing how he had found the flat, which he had managed to come to the conclusion that John had been taken and the flat had been cleaned and staged.  Frankly Sherlock was impressed that the inspector’s skill had come so far since he had been away.  It was certainly a marked improvement.  All the while Lestrade talked the detective played through the movement, the notes transitioning from doleful into a smooth patterned melody and then suddenly into the quick and light notes which his trained fingers paced expertly up and down the finger board.  Soon the inspector grew quiet and the only sound in the flat was the quick movements of his bow being drawn over the strings in rapid succession as the classic sped to a racing crescendo of notes—that just as suddenly stopped.
He tore his lips away from Sherlock’s throat with a shout, everything pooling for the barest instant before he came. Wave after wave flooded through him. Hands clenching into the mattress, John felt the material rip under the strength of his grip as he shuddered. Sherlock’s cry of completion echoing his own as he clenched around John, fingers ripping through the sheets with ease as he rode his own orgasm.
An ache resonated within the confines of his chest, pulsing with each mechanical thrum of his beating heart.  Was it not strangely ironic that the very organ that pumped the life giving oxygen to every recess of your body would also be the one that was synonymously connected to the strongest physical emotion one could have.  Due to the feeling clawing away at his insides this morning he could rationally agree with the ridiculous sentiment.
John was helpless to do anything as he writhed under the man’s ministrations. Sherlock was in complete control of everything. The understanding brought another wash of heat burning through his being, mingling with the fire already building inside him. He wanted more, needed more.
Sherlock’s hand went to the throat of the animal, his thin fingers digging deep into the mangled hide, skin, and muscle below, making a sickening squish, as he took hold of it and reefed back.  Nothing much happened.  “The man’s neck,” he began to explain, “was torn open.  There were clear marks where, what I suspect must have been fingers, had torn into the flesh.  The way the skin and muscle was ripped away from the neck was most certainly from a tearing motion.”
Coming up empty handed the vampire tuned into the unbidden thoughts coming from the cleaner, who still worked at his task, eyeing him contemptuously now and then through the clear safety goggles over his muddy brown eyes.  The human's thoughts were no help either, full of rambling curses and derisive judgements, completely consumed by the fact that he was always hampered by 'watchers' in his profession.  Louis had not the time to listen long enough that the man might by chance recall what had happened to the individual whose blood provided his employment and the vampire feared that a more direct approach would only garner more suspicion and less answers.
Sherlock stood there, his butt resting against the counter of the sink, frozen, his eyes trained on John.  The doctor took in the scene.  Here he had barged in, invaded what the detective had attempted to use as a sanctuary, safe from the consequences of his own selfish destructive decisions.  The taller man was undressed.  His dress shirt lay in a discarded heap on the floor near the base of the toilet, his trousers undone, ready to join the pile.  John had always been in awe of the detective’s body, at times even envious.  The man was tall and thin, but his form remained very lean.  His skin was perfect, unblemished and a soft pale pink, adding definition to the toned abdominals along the length of his torso.  The doctor shook off the effect it had on him now, seeing his flat mate exposed before him as he was, and instead remained steadfast to his mission.
Once again Lestrade found himself having to interject, in order to move the conversation along.  He did have a crime scene to get back to.  He started by clearing his throat before he deftly cut in, “Be that what it may, Mrs. Hudson, is there another reason why you have called me today?”
"T-the morgue...? Right, of course, the morgue." John sounded sour, but the detective did not hesitate to believe that the doctor's interest was piqued. As the other man's footsteps followed behind him Sherlock could hear him question, "What is 'it'?"
Then those large hazelnut eyes flashed up at him, the emotion roiling beneath her features pinging as they registered in the man’s mind.  “You should have cleaned it.  You have the start of an infection.  I’ve cleaned what I can but if the swelling and redness continues you will need to see a doctor.” She explained.
“If she happened to end his life, by biting clean through his fleshy neck in her amorous need to satiate some carnal sexual desire, then, yes.” The detective jested, fantastically, before grinding back to the truth.  “Perhaps that’s why I referred to the murder as a ‘he’ earlier.  Biting for sexual arousal is somewhat out of my league of experience but I do rather think that a woman would have had a hard time leaving that deep of an impression—most men too I suspect—?”  Sherlock’s last comment was stifled by John’s sudden movement towards him.
Once her parcels were secured Louis politely attempted to excuse himself but the landlady paused in her bustling only long enough to insist she repay his kindness with a hot cup of tea. After a few moments of trying to decline her offer he soon realized she was not about to be denied. She had even refused to let him out of her flat, calling his bluff on the excuse that he just wanted to get something from his own flat and would return.
Sherlock opened his mouth and paused before speaking lowly. “It took you long enough to figure this out, now shut up.” With that simple statement his arms wrapped around John and pulled him back down to the bed.
The hand that gripped his wrist so ardently thrust him forward, his face nearly slamming into the collar of Sherlock's coat, as a quick hissed question met his ear, "Did you feel it?"  John obediently answered, shaking his head no, and slowly the other man pulled back, only enough for their eyes to meet.  It was a calculating sweep of his face, John just didn't know what it was that the detective was looking for.  Then a small turn quirked the corner of the man's full mouth and he was being pulled in another direction, with only the classic quick demand, "Come, John."
Truth be told, as much as he longed for the closeness of the other immortal’s companionship there was much about the time spent with Louis that his maker could think of better ways to enjoy himself.  Louis preferred a quieter lifestyle.  The vampire loved to lose himself in books, to sit in coffee shops with a fragrant latte in hand, observing the small and unremarkable lives of the people who milled about them, so many blind to everything around them, to caught up in the little dramas of their own universes to pay any real attention to the monster that sat in their midst, so close, drinking in the scent of the lives he could so easily snuff out.
Ella would think, he theorized in that absent moment of thought, that he should be more concerned about the bombs, about the lunatic that had fed him lines through an ear piece to regurgitate at his friend, who had threatened to end him to spite Sherlock.  Ella wouldn’t say that though—no, she was a shrink—she would simply lead him to that conclusion, like a mother taking the hand of child.  Surely he should be concerned about all those things.  The danger, the threats, the red laser beam dot between the curls above those intense piercing eyes.  Instead, he cared more about the hands…about the accelerated breathing, and the stuttered words after Moriarty’s departure.
He knew that he would enjoy it, the prostate was fairly easy to stimulate once it was found and Sherlock was an exceptionally talented man. But could he just relinquish all control to the genius? John looked up into those oddly mesmerizing eyes, seeing them filled with so many emotions that John hadn’t known the detective possessed and thought that maybe, with his man, he just might be able to.
"Why all this?" Sherlock asked, he needed to stall for time to find someway out of this inescapable predicament.
Molly cleared her throat with a mousy chirp and their eyes broke.  “Is it what you were looking for?”
“You’re nuts.” Lestrade stated with a shake of his head, the quirk at the corner of his mouth stretched just a little further, before he puckered to suck one last drag that finished his smoke off.  “That part of London, on a Friday night?”
“The girl could not verify that.” David responded, “It seems that all she was able to find out was that the Talmasca believes she was targeted and killed by this faction, a group which they are currently monitoring.  Although Mary Morstan had defected, they cannot prove that she left to join this group.  If they did not neutralize her than it is clear—”
, he corrected himself, as John’s stance and presence alone broke him of his train of thought, delving back hard and strong into the last incident that had occurred between them within the walls of the flat they had previously shared—that he now so visibly felt uneasy to frequent.
Their first field trip provided nothing, besides John’s breakfast, and soon the two men were moving on to the another of the location’s Sherlock had found through his cross-referencing. With the vampire having fed he was recharged enough to again experiment with the consulting detective and the results were slightly better than the first; images coming through faster and clearer.
John had moved through several reactions to his current predicament that would be considered normal he supposed if his captor were watching—which he was most certain the culprit was.  He had gone from quietly perturbed, to desperate, to panicked, to enraged, and to finally where he sat now, somewhere on the precipice of acceptance.  He was where he was and there was no way out but down—a long way down.  His desperate stage had not been that precarious.  What quieted him now and allowed the man to enjoy the view and the cup of coffee was knowing that his captor would eventually turn up.  There was no way someone imprisons someone in a bloody penthouse suite in the tallest, most expensive building in all of London without having the ego to go with it.
Anthea handed him a cup of hot tea and he sneered at the offer, even though he begrudgingly accepted it.  The elder Holmes was not used to being snubbed and it left him in a splenetic mood.  The tea was just another offense, at that point, that he really had no option of rebuffing.  They were in a miserable part of London and in all honesty he was surprised his young attendant had found a cup of anything.  It was warm in his hands, a soothing comfort that mimicked half decent drink if nothing else.
Sherlock watched the vampire close the door behind him.  It was but a dark blob of movement, across a distance that he could not judge through his bleary eyed focus.  With the creature gone his system seemed to flood with relief, allowing his mind to shift to more important tasks.  The vampire always kept him on edge, especially now, and with him gone he could focus his dulled intellect of trying to escape.
The grin cast up at him showed the barest hint of the sharpened incisors and somehow the predatory look made John even more desirable. Sherlock groaned and squeezed his eyes shut, feeling overloaded by his desire, his want of all of this, of John, of how he found himself in this dream and how real it all felt. John watched and felt the store brewing in Sherlock and rose to his feet, staring intently at the man he truly loved. This was real, as real as it could be and as it needed to be.
With no more sound then the soft rustle of curtains that stirred in the open windows of the apartments above, Lestat descended into the shadow of the man who smelt like peaches and cigar smoke. When the youth stopped suddenly, alerted to the predator that was so closely behind him, it was too late to escape. The cell phone clattered to the concrete below as the iron grip snaked around his torso, a hand clenched tightly over his lips to stifle a muffled and desperate cry. The two ascended swiftly as Lestat pressed the length of his body tightly to the other mans backside, releasing his hand from the others lips and instead clenching a tight hand full of the perfect curls. Too high above the buildings below to be easily heard over the ambient noise of the city, the string of curses as well the violent struggle ceased suddenly. A soft gurgle replacing the thick accented language as Lestat bit hard and savagely into the exposed throat before him. The flesh tearing easily, like the thin skin of a grape, as the rush of hot and rich blood flooded into Lestat's eager mouth.
“I gotta’ get this bad boy back where it belongs.” She said. The amulet, as if having heard itself being reference in the conversation, gave a bright purple pulse of light that shown out from where she had tucked it under her blouse.
Those kaleidoscope eyes flashed up to meet his for just a moment, something odd catching John’s attention before they looked away again. There was still mirth in the tone and warmth in the others hand that rested on his own now on the bed. "Or Mrs. Hudson's rum, if you prefer."
Lestat's powers were something, he was sure, not even Lestat could fully grasp. That creatures, such as they were, existed could shatter the reality of the man whom had drawn him to London in the first place. Knowing that his maker had been struggling lately with control over his extensive dark gifts in conjunction with his emotions was not something that could any longer be passed off as 'bad mood swings', as Armand had put it.  Even so, there was nothing to be done about it until Lestat reappeared.  Until then he would have some time to figure out exactly what it was that he could do.
“No, don’t!” John snapped, earning a sharp tug on his arm from the fiend that held him captive in his tight embrace.  The doctor could feel the warmth of blood spreading down his front and back from the trauma, soaking into the fabric of his button front shirt.  The pain was excruciating, worse than a bullet, but still he warned his friend, “Stay away, Sherlock.”
John stood up, brushing the mud from his hands. He turned to the woman at his side. Mary looked at him with question and distain in her hooded eyes. This was not the woman he had loved. This was a wolf in sheep’s clothing. This was Ludvik.
Sherlock was much more of a restless sleeper. It had always been a source of frustration between them when they shared a bed. There had been more than one argument about the war for the bed covers. The thought raised the corner of his mouth. He had always won those battles as well, ending all of John’s quarrels with a well-felled kiss. The almost-smile slipped. He doubted the tactic would hold water now.
“Arrogant cock!” Lestat spat, allowing his anger to flare once again, now that the imminent threat had removed itself.
Mycroft scoffed loudly, and leaned forward out of his chair.  His cold eyes nailing his younger brother in the seat opposite his desk.  Contempt and sarcasm dripped form his words, as he proffered an open palm dismissively, explaining, “This far?  I assume you mean the engagement.  That, little brother, is why I warned you not to get involved.  Dr. Watson is a stubborn man.  You should have known you could not keep him, you of all people.  Who was I to intervene?  And was I to do so for your sake?  For your honor?  I’m pretty sure I don’t have to verbalize how that would have turned out.  Please remember, Sherlock, you have just recently returned from the dead.”
"You've been...?" she never finished the half-muttered sentence.  She spun back around and furiously continued her task, scrubbing the dishes harder, as she complained, "Of course you've been using my laptop.  I must have been an idiot to consider that you would have had enough respect for privacy to leave my things alone."  She gave him a cheeky glance askance, as she sweetly inquired, “Have you been sniffing my panties as well?”
clever.” Sherlock gave his friend a cagy grin that earned him the delight of a chuckle out of John, before he elaborated, “He thinks he’s too intelligent to get caught…or too powerful.  He’s sought the best and never been caught so now he’s come to tempt the greatest.  I must be taking too long, that last one was sloppy.”
“They did not feel she was of a threat.  Yet she was being fully monitored to prove that.” Mycroft finished.  “So, therefore they are also aware of John Watson’s change and of our involvement.”
Handing over most of the remaining bills in his wallet, John barely noticed the man leave before returning with his change. The bartender quickly stacked the few coins beside the momentarily empty glass before he unscrewed the heavy bottle in his hand. After giving him an appraising look, the man filled the glass with more of that amber liquid. Capping the bottle, the bartender shifted forward, raising his voice to be heard over the crowd. “All right Doc, this is your last top-up, I’m cutting you off.”
“Oh , you mean that the world’s hottest detective is missing?" The younger girl finally blurted out, her voice hitched with an exuberance that she tried, too late, to subdue.
Sherlock timed it properly, as he squeezed and slid his hand along John he slowly began to breach. It burned and he wanted to tense up all over again, but resolutely held himself perfectly still, biting hard on the inside of his cheek.
Lestat stood panting and bloody on the cracked marble tile, his icy blue eyes assessing the gaunt devil that stood across from him. The man was thin with short cropped black hair and eyes that seemed impossibly pitch. It only added to the confirmation that the creature in front of him was not another vampire but something else, something stronger and more dangerous than he himself, and it infuriated the immortal. The man had mocked him at every chance and seemed to easily beat back any attack Lestat had thus far attempted.
“Besides,” she added, finishing her previous remark, “John makes Sherlock laugh and that is a rare thing, indeed.”
One could never be too thorough and so the man had decided to start with a run through of the home once more, taking special care to check every nook and cranny.  He found little that was vampirical in nature, just the odd individual preference that one could appreciate.  The building was very secure externally from intrusion but not beyond what could be expected of an individual who traveled extensively.  This was obviously a stop over home, not meant to be used as a permanent residence, so it seemed only equipped with the essentials.
Ice blue eyes ribbed with striations of cobalt met the coffee and amber tones and David’s own and he was unsure what he saw flash behind his makers gaze. Lestat shifted his weight to one side and snorted, tossing his head. “I am always being punished it seems.”
The silence hung in the air for a few more long moments, the blond held out as long as he could, before puffing out an exasperated breath, snatching the duck back from from it's bobbing position in front of him.
Memories of John and himself, in this place, drowned his mind. Sherlock could feel the tips of his ears pinking with the rush of blood that flooded his face. Embarrassed, he coughed, responding, “As I have said before… I can make it any place I wish to conceive.”
There was no food in the cupboards or the fridge, yet one was present, and there were no clothes or personal items in the upstairs bedrooms.  The library was one of the few rooms that showed any individuality, displayed in the extensive collection of books that lined all four walls.
Sherlock’s teeth grazed softly down the shaft, his mouth lowering until he had taken all of John in. John’s eyes widened in shock and he forced himself to be completely still as he felt the automatic constricting at the back of the other man’s throat, amazed that the detective had been able to deep throat him. But this was Sherlock, he couldn’t do anything by half measures.
“Grande salted caramel white mocha half sweet, for Sherlock!” called the barista at the bar, far louder than was necessary.
An hour later she finally heard him moving about the flat above her own and around supper she was certain it was the detective that let the door slam closed as her left the building.
With his patients done and dealt with, he left his office to find that Mary had also left to meet her Janine and their mutual friend chocolate cake, so he pulled on his dark jacket and headed out to catch a cab.  It was dark already, drizzling cloud cover blotting out the last of the sun as it set, and the air was crisp with a sharp chill, as the misting rain wet his skin and hair.  The streets were busy and he was damp before he could hail a cabbie.
“What?  Sherlock?  Play along now…” the sound pierced his veil.  Moriarty was calling to him from somewhere outside where he hid.  “Simon says...
That had to be the most arousing thing that John had ever seen. Sherlock Holmes spread out of the bed before him like a Sunday Buffet. A full body shudder coursed through him as arousal spiked across every nerve ending. Not wanting to wait anymore he jerked out of his still damp coat, letting it drop carelessly to the ground with a sodden thump. His jumper was a little more difficult, the water saturated material clinging to him even as he extracted himself from the warm, wet wool, taking his undershirt along with it.
Lestrade looked lost and taken aback by the entirety of the scene.  It had been rather gruesome, not just your run of the mill homicide.  The inspector raked a hand back through his short silvered crop.  Sherlock could sense that the man wished he had the butt of a cigarette between his lips, the smoke of its tobacco in his nostrils, and the calming effects of the nicotine in his bloodstream to help him think.  Sherlock had to admit that he empathized with the other man, he too could use a drag, but not while John was present.  Lestrade’s dark eyes, wide with the late hour and the mystery of the man’s death, asked what everyone else stupid enough to think wanted to know, “What do you make of this, Sherlock?”
“To my estimate, he has been heavily influenced up until the point where Marisa completed her task of caring for me on the island.” Sherlock explained. John gave him a quizzical look. “Her payment was a sum of money and a vile of Lestat’s blood. I think she was already being coerced by Moriarty. He put her in that place, so she could retrieve a vile of the vampire’s blood and somehow having that blood has given Moriarty enormous powers over the vampires and control of Lestat. That’s why he took Lestat from my brother’s library. He had to assert his control over him, so that he could send him back out as an agent of his demonic desires.”
The mortal had intended to wake before his cohort, as much to appear that he had not failed in his vigil as to take up the post once more. He was surprised to be woke by a soft nudge at his shoulder, followed by the press of cool lips against his temple and then his mouth—sending him into a dazed state, lost between the memory of such pleasing wake-up calls in the past, the thought of it all being a dream, and the very real sense that this was unbelievably his reality once more. It took him a moment to shake the disorientation, which all but vanished the instant he sensed the vampire’s palpable trepidation, of which he had meant to alleviate with his failed vigilance.
The man’s gaze scanned the bright city lights that stretched out around him like a tangled web of electricity.  Why had he not asked about her?  Where was Mary?  Was she okay?  Was she searching for him?  Then he thought of someone else.  It had been as natural a progression for his thoughts as it had been to consider his fiancé’s well-being and yet the after effect it had on him made him cringe.
He found himself in an immense house with many rooms, all of them lavish and grand, decorated with expensive drapes and rugs and wood furniture.  John had been in very few places that could compare to the elitist feel of what was obviously a grand estate home.
Softly the voice behind him asked, “Do you thirst?” It was cautious and caring, but also threaded with the underlying graveness of the reality of their damned immortal lives.
Sherlock bobbed his head again in that see-saw motion that meant ‘not quite’ or ‘yes and no’. “Demonic power or the ideology of it predates Christianity and pervades almost every culture past and present to some degree. Even vampirism is demonic at its core or so it is said.”
Everything centred in that small area, mouth and hands driving him insane as Sherlock sucked, and pumped and rolled. “Please,” John didn’t care that he was begging. “I can’t-” he arched and strained, a sharp cry escaping as the third finger slid all the way in.
Sometimes they were of that night, the night Lestat took him.  Those were the worst ones.  One might consider them more nightmarish than a dream.  He would hear Sherlock's scream from the other side of the mobile and then the crunch of his own skin breaking under the pressure of the blond monster's teeth—too loud and terrifyingly crisp to be real—as pain resonated throughout his entire being like liquid fire in his veins, when his blood was slowly, methodically, suctioned from his body, gulp by audible gulp.  Sometimes he could see Sherlock watching this happen to him over the face-time connection on the mobile.  At times, the detective would look horrified and disgusted.  He would scream and cry out, in as much pain as John could feel.  Other times his face would smile, horribly delighted and intrigued, utterly captivated by it all, those silver eyes of his alight with aroused curiosity.  Once Louis had arrived in time to save him, heal him, and keep him from their mutual maker's designs.  Most of the time he didn’t come at all, leaving John to wake and return to the reality of being what he was now.  A vampire.  A blood-sucker.  An Angel of the Night—a disgustingly romanticised way of viewing someone who killed to survive.
“I have read them.” The detective replied, tossing both books back into the others lap, haphazardly, “They still don’t explain everything.”
The immortal had passed through airport security with ease. His passport and credentials were found credible, raising little attention to himself, aside from the occasional lingering glances of people mesmerized by the impossibly beautiful depths of his emerald eyes and the ivory pallor of his unnaturally tough skin, but that was rather typical. Now he, like the rest of the unsuspecting mortals that milled about the terminal, waited for his international flight.
John groaned as he moved against the other man, unable to keep himself still. He needed more than the friction that they were creating. “Sherlock.” He begged the other man with his name alone.
He could not get enough of Louis, his mouth, his moans, his body his being. Louis’ hands had come up to grasp him, positioning him perfectly as he slowly pushed the smaller man down onto his weeping erection. Slipping the impressive girth deep into the others tight ass as both men groaned their mutual pleasure. Armand’s face buried in Louis neck, as he settled to the hilt and they stayed that way a long moment, chests heaving as they panted against one another with Louis’ hands kneading his backside. When Armand began to slowly move, it was he who set the initial pace until soon they were both lost in the sensation of their love making. His head tossed back, as he surrendered his body to Louis and Louis immediately reacted, slamming the other down hard.  The loud smack of flesh on flesh ringing out into the night with Armand’s cry of surprise and ecstasy.
Then they stopped.  Something changed, kicked in, a wall came down, and he refused the other part that believed.  “T-that’s a lie.” He said, stubbornly, his hands balling into fists at his sides, as his back went ramrod straight.
They stayed that way for a long while, Louis reading through book after book, never once saying a word, as Armand silently watched.
“Oh, thank goodness you’re here, Inspector,” the elderly woman’s voice cracked and sputtered, beyond the thin hands that she wrung together under her chin.  Her eyes were red and glassy from crying.  She quit her hand wringing only to swipe at her sniffling nose and to open the door wide for Lestrade to step inside the foyer of 221B Baker Street.
Sherlock leveled the caustic vampire with a acidic sneer of his own.  “I hadn’t planned on it.” He stated coolly, as he briskly paced to the other side of the bed to draw the drapes closed.  “I do not suspect it would end well for me if I tried.”
The quiet was not settled for long. Soon the air was rent again by another two blasts. Blam-blam! Blam-blam!
For once, the detective was considerate of his landlady, sleeping in her own flat.  That was all they would need.  They made their way up the stairs with a respectful modesty and Sherlock could not help but detect that John was physically and mentally repressing his natural vampirical speed, forcing his new body to slow down and take things at a more moderate pace than was given to his kind.  Like a gentleman, he walked through the open door and gave a welcoming gesture of his arm, before John reluctantly stepped through the threshold.
“I will be appropriately wounded but charmingly persistent always to bow to your desire and not cause unnecessary woes between us. So now that we have established the next bit of our evening, how would you care to spend the rest? I have a private box at the Symphony if you're so inclined one evening, in my company or not, it is yours to use if you should wish it.” His eyes didn't look up once to meet Louis’, instead they watched the splash of the expensive scotch in it's crystal confines through dark lashes, lips parted slightly as he inhaled the scent of the liquor he himself, would never drink.
Soon enough they crossed the threshold into his sparsely furnished bedroom. The younger man released his shoulders and stepped past, walking through the room like it was his own. “Remove your shirt and lay down.” The order was spoken as the genius circled around the perfectly made bed to the far side. Grasping the dark coverlet Sherlock folded it down to allow John to more easily climb in and collapse.
John laughed again. It was not the hilarious sort of Sunday laughter you might hear over tea, but rather the sad darker thing that you sometimes hear after one has overcome great grief. They let the chuckles settle and melt between them, savoring the moment for as long as they could before having to return to their new supernatural realty.
When they had finished, John excused himself, wanting to return to his unfinished blog entry. He had a couple more hours to add some girth to the adventure before he would have to jump in the shower. He left Sherlock to collect and examine his bullets from the chamber experiment, returning to his laptop.
Hands pulled him to full alertness, rushing up and down his person in a medical-like sweep that was both shocking and familiar. John was behind him, breathing a sigh of relief, as he found that the detective was in deed intact and unharmed.
Their gazes met, and John suddenly realized he had been staring. He swivelled his head back to his laptop, feeling his cheeks warm uncomfortably. It took a hell of a lot longer to figure out where he had left off with his blog than it had the last time, as he tried to ignore his own physical response to the detective behind him.
The soft and familiar creak of the steps leading up to his flat alerted Sherlock that Mrs. Hudson was ascending, as a soft rap on his only partially closed door revealed the older lady in her conservative evening wear.
Sherlock turned his body slightly away, glancing back at John askance. There was a coy smirk to his mouth that dimpled his cheek, as he proudly replied, “Got your blood pumping, did it?”
The wide lips pursed and brow knit as he slowly sank back into the blackness and back to standing at the drop-site, looking towards the entrance to the ally. He turned his minds-eye back to the roofs of the buildings as he thought on the unease that he had experienced. When he had felt it, it had come over him quite suddenly, like a small dart shot directly into his amygdala and his immediate reaction was to freeze. It was different, sharp, focused and it had produced a high-pitched squeal in his mind like a bank-vault alarm being set off.
Inhaling deeply, he caught the scent of the oil beginning to permeate the room. Mint, sandalwood and something else he couldn’t identify. Thankfully it wasn’t anything flowery like lavender, he hated lavender. The combination of scents was calming and he wanted to relax, but that was hard to do with his flatmate straddling his back.
“I wouldn’t worry.  She thinks you’re genetically endowed with such desirable attributes.” Sherlock confirmed for his friend.
There was another moan, breathy and gasping, that was really truly the mingled sounds of both their spiraling intemperance, as he felt the body above him begin to slowly move into alignment with his own.  It was an odd sensation, both intensely sensual and pleasing but also slightly alarming.  John was surprised at the ease with which the movement was succeeded, like to pieces of a working machine coming together, both feeling the press of the other’s enjoyment with each shift of their hips together.
John grew restless at his side. “Am I supposed to attack this guy or wait for him to strike first?” he questioned, growing increasingly anxious with the encounter.
“Lestat can be hard to love and is truthfully, easier to hate, for most that know him.” The older vampire said, without malice or judgement in his tone.  “But you are of his blood and that changes everything.”  He stopped then and turned to face Louis, taking his arms gently but steadily, as he explained, “I do believe that you have been that damned creature’s one redemption.”
However, what made him even more curious as to where the detective had gotten to, was the fact that his experiment had nothing to do with their current case. The trail of the culprits who had stolen an illegally housed mammoth skull from a wealthy private collector, no doubt to sell it to a proper museum, had gone cold the night before. This infuriated the detective. When he was vexed like this the irritable man would rant and rave and even give out the odd curse—under his breath—and then usually settle down on the couch or roost in his chair, speckled with nicotine patches.
With a frown, John wiggled, startled back to stillness when air puffed like the lion’s growl against his ear. Distantly, John knew that something wasn’t entirely as it should be. He needed to go- “-Home.”
“She was targeted but not by the Talmasca, although I am sure that if she had defected and threatened the organization in any way that they would have overseen that she was sufficiently neutralized.” David explained.  It gave the impression that David had known about other potential target killings by the organization itself.  “But this was another group entirely.”
“Ensure he doesn’t and don’t think on it if you do go to him for any ‘training’. Fill your mind instead with pictures of something else, the more random and nonsense the better. That is the one method I can give you against intruders that would hack your mind should you not be able to outright eject them or block them.” Marisa’s tone was one of experience, pushing herself away from the counter and interrupting Sherlock who had been about to ask another question.
"Oh would you?!" The slender mans face lit with a glee that Sherlock wasn't entirely convinced was contrived, which only served to confuse him more and subsequent to that confusion came the growing rage.
The genius marveled at the puffin-girl’s teleportation abilities. What he had at first suspected a mere ability to vanish and reappear somewhere close by was completely transformed by this revelation. She had teleported not just herself but two additional passengers over thirty kilometers south west of Prague, in a mere moment, and appeared to be none the worse for having done it. Not to mention through obstacles, like stone, metal, mortar, and wood. They had been in a building and now they were outside. It was mind boggling. His mind went wild, calculations and permeations racing through his head, evaluating and analyzing this data, hypothesizing—but he reigned it in. This was not the time.
by?” Louis question airily.  He cast a quick glance at the blond, eyebrow arching appreciatively at the striking figure, before he turned and walked towards the street.
Sherlock stood perfectly still, posed at the window as though he were a statue. His shoes had been kicked off to the side and he stood in his black socks, coat still hanging open and his blue scarf dangling loosely from his fingertips as he stared down below. Once more John was struck by how utterly magnificent the younger man was. Beautiful and brilliant. “Sherlock.” Involuntarily the man’s name slipped past his lips.
Louis felt the anger and frustration rolling off Mrs. Hudson and quickly returned the gentle pat to the back of her hand that he had just received. Sympathetically he stated with a soft smile towards her, “Reminds me of my ex.”
The room was not so hidden.  The house was a typical layout for the era and area.  He had known where the secure room was the moment they had entered the home.  He knew enough about Lestat and his kind to figure out that sunlight would need to be avoided.  Yet John had exhibited some peculiar symptoms as dawn had approached that matched his warning for the detective about interfering with his immortal slumber.  He presumed then that by now John was incapacitated, which meant he would be unaware if Sherlock heeded his caution or not.
John followed, sarcastically, “I got your message. The one you sent while I was getting the piss kicked out of me. And by the way, I did have my own suspicions, thank you very much.”
There it was again. Small but substantial. That voice reminding him what was reality and what was not, even though he wanted very much to stay here and argue his point. It was Sherlock. It had to be. The man was trying to get inside. Trying to help. Trying to keep John on track.
John frowned at his reflection in the mirror. He didn’t seem to look like the man he had been. He resembled his younger self, a man fifteen years younger. He had been no fool, age had not been as kind to him as it had some, and neither had the heat, sweat, and sand of Afghanistan. All that was gone now. His skin was ruddy no more, the wrinkles around his eyes and his mouth had vanished, and all that was left was white smoothness.
The rich deep chime of Lestat’s laughter filled the cool night air around him, as the devilish immortal watched the charming scene unfold in the London flat. Ruddy lips, warm with his recent feed, spread into a seductive smile as he felt all of the embarrassment and arousal and then, immediate shame of the detectives faithful and conflicted companion as he happened upon his former lover in the tub.
With every draw of the rich red substance he thrust harder, the detective's body embracing and meeting him every time. The detective’s nails raked over his marble-like skin, scoring red-hot trails along John's back, as the younger man cried out in pleasure.
“Interrupted?” It was the first time Mycroft’s voice had entered into the whole exchange. John shot a look at him, remembering the man was in the room, as he continued his question to the blond, “By whom?”
The artifact resonated with a purple glow, that cast refracted light about the room, displaying its intricate gem-cut. It lit the planes of the girls face with an eerie light. Sherlock could see the curve of satisfaction on her full lips, before she closed her eyes, and began to spout a latin incantation. The words were so soft that Sherlock lost half of them.
He also knew he would need to deal with Sherlock, eventually. Thoughts of the consulting detective left him feeling full of turmoil, the scale tipping heavily towards the negative end of the spectrum. He had almost killed the man the night he had been turned into this new creature. The blood lust had consumed John, transforming him into a savage beast with no mind beyond its insatiable desire to feed. In his darkest days after the change, he had sobbed for all three of them. Mary, Sherlock, and himself. It was only after much convincing that Louis had persuaded him to believe that the man still lived. But, in what form? Neither knew and so they had left it at that.
