"No," she forced out, her voice sounding rough and strangled. The word hurt her throat. "No. I will not be your tool."
a relationship, but recently he'd ended up talking to her almost as often as he did Fury or Dugan.  Tony suspected that Fury had decided that watching him and Maria try to be as professional as possible while pretending they weren't sniping at one another was even more entertaining than baiting or manipulating Tony himself.
That sounded ominous. "Deny-" Steve started, and broke off as Sam came rushing through the open door, Clint on his heels.
Steve stared at him, feeling as frozen as he had when Tony had casually tossed back that glass of soda and revealed to the entire room that he, too, was interested in other men. Was Tony flirting with him? "I wasn't going to admit it," he said. "I'd never told anyone. But you drank first, and, well, I wasn't really thinking."
His jaw still ached under his mask, the bruise where Van Dyne had struck him throbbing.  He would remember that offense as well.
"Loki's words are oft as dangerous as her actions," Thor said flatly. He was actually talking to Tony now, Loki's appearance having presumably provided the distraction of someone he hated even more.
She looked away, one hand crumpling the fabric of her skirt. There was something dark on the back of it, but Tony wasn't close enough to make out the details. "I'm... I will be. I hope."
"From Doom and other sorcerers who seek its power for selfish ends." Strange gestured at Wanda, as if the answer ought to have been obvious. For him, it probably was. "Wanda was seeking it for Chthon's ends, not her own."
"You'll pay for this, woman!" Doom spat, turning back to Jan with energy crackling over one gauntlet.  The other hand held his mask to his face.
Carol grabbed him by the wrist and thigh and spun him around into an armlock. The knife he'd been holding clattered to the floor, and she kicked it away. She slammed her forehead into his and dropped him, letting him crumple to the ground, then picked up the assault rifle he'd had strapped across his back and bent it into an arc; that was one gun they weren't going to have to worry about, at least.
Steve shifted to put himself sideways on the couch, his back against the armrest and his head and neck out of claw-reach. Designed to accommodate Thor if necessary, the couch was long enough that even with Tony sitting on the other end, he could stretch his legs out to their full length. He rested one foot against Tony's thigh and drew the other leg up to balance his sketchpad on his knee. "Is this what's had you pulling all-nighters?"
Tony shuddered. "I wore something across my chest for long enough as it is. Surely there's some spell you haven't tried."
Tony nodded. "Probably. Or they arranged for it to happen." Steve smelled like lemons, the earlier scents of spaghetti sauce and blood erased by dish soap. Cleaning products, he suspected, shouldn't smell so enticing.
It took Jan a moment to recognize the blonde woman striding toward them as Sharon Carter.  She needed sleep, she thought, and something to eat.  It had been a very long day.
They made it another fifteen feet down the hall, Sam on his left and Carol and Jan in the lead, before six men came charging out of the special exhibit space, brandishing a mismatched collection of rifles and handguns.
"Oh." Pepper flashed him a momentary grin. "I guess that makes a difference, doesn't it? But the threat stands. Hurt him, and I'll hurt you." She said this with such confidence that it never occurred to Steve to doubt that she could carry said threat out, and never mind that she was a foot shorter than him.
"I'd try that, but Rhodey's still mad at me, too." The words emerged almost without conscious intent, and Tony could see both Clint and Hank twitch. It was true, though - he might otherwise have actually had a chance with Rhodey now that he was temporarily female, but not after forcing Rhodey to pick up his slack and clean up his messes for months until the stress practically drove him into a nervous breakdown, getting Morley and Clytemnestra killed, taking the Iron Man armor away from him, and otherwise treating him like dirt. The War Machine armor had made up for a lot, but hardly everything.
Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum was only a twenty minute walk from Hell's Kitchen. Thirty minutes, in heels. She could be at his door before full dark. Good. Chthon might be more powerful after dark.
"Good." Wanda's voice was quiet, but there was an odd fierceness to it. "I caused so much destruction, hurt so many people – without these seals, I could destroy the world." She tilted her head to one side, sweeping the heavy mass of her hair to one side to expose the glyphs tattooed at the base of her neck. "You have no idea how dangerous I'd be without this. Omega-level mutants are... unstoppable. You remember what happened to the Professor, and Jean."
"You brag about yourself well enough without my help."  It was jarring for a moment, how normal everything suddenly felt; it seemed as if this shouldn't be real.  Not anymore.
Steve blinked. He'd expected more of a reaction when he finally worked up the courage to say the words. Maybe Tony hadn't noticed. "Yes," he agreed. "You are being stupid." He let go of Tony, standing, the memory of those hours spent watching Tony lie there motionless suddenly crashing down on him. "You- I was afraid you weren't coming back."
"I know that, I just... I didn't realize, when you first told me, how dangerous this could be. Not until Wanda explained just now. Whatever you do, the risk-"
done a good job. And Hank tended to only believe things like that if someone else said them. That was, when he wasn't being over-confident.
"Great, guys. That's level two cleared, and the system didn't throw up any red flags." Jan's voice was loud over the intercom, drowning out the faint whirr of floor plates shifting back into their normal position.
Sam grudgingly tapped out, and Steve let him go. "What if he changes back?" he asked, climbing back to his feet and rubbing ostentatiously at his shoulder. "What are you going to do then?"
"I'd like to get some sleep first, if you and Wong don't mind putting me up for the night. Or, well, the day."
"Chthon can do that," she said, to Daredevil. "It's one of his tricks. Sometimes he'll sound like someone you know."
Wanda frowned down at her hands, studying the tracery of black tattoos for a moment, then looked up again.  "We still don't know how Doom's planning to get the spear out of the cathedral.  Strange's spells ought to keep him from even going inside.  I assumed that's what he wanted the Dee manuscript for, but maybe he's planning to use her."
"Will you and Thor please stop apologizing to me?" Exasperation had leaked into his husky mezzo-soprano voice now - odd, but at some point in the past few weeks, the lighter pitch had stopped sounding strange to Steve, had become just Tony's voice.
"You could stand to be a little bit more concerned yourself," he snapped.  "He took one of those shots for you."
"I don't know.  He tried to summon her to Asgard with the ring she gave me.  We should have known it was a trap."  He drew his bad leg — his good leg, now — up and bent forward to lean his forehead against his knee.  It helped the dizziness a little.
She glanced up at the vent curiously, and her eyes widened. White vapor was swirling out of it into the room.
Steve was probably busy trying to talk Barnes out of being Fury's private assassin right about now – he hadn't said much about it to Tony since the night Barnes and Agent Carter had shown up on their doorstep, fresh from eliminating one of SHIELD's problems, but Tony knew it bothered him, and not just because of the risk involved.
He caught the woman around the waist, snapping his wings back out to halt their descent. She screamed even more loudly, and stabbed him in the shoulder with a fork.
Pepper did not actually roll her eyes, but Tony could sense her desire to do so as clearly as if she had. "You're getting married to Captain America. Of course it's going to be a media circus."
Tony looked up with a jerk to see Jan standing a foot or so away from him, examining him intently. How had she gotten there without him hearing anything?
"Using magic to modify your tech is cheating," Tony mumbled.  His face tightened into a pained grimace, and he reached up to touch his temple, then opened his eyes and squinted blearily at his bare left hand.  "What happened to my armor?"
"He argues with you," Sam held up one finger, "he won't put up with you trying to boss him around," another finger, "and you think you need to save him." He flourished three fingers at Steve as if they were evidence of something.
He had expected something like that. He hadn't expected her to have half the Masters of Evil along for the ride.
"Happy's married," Tony objected, pointing out what was only a small fraction of the many, many things terribly wrong with this idea. "And I can't take an employee to this."
"He only fractured it," Steve said defensively. "He could have caved my skull in if he'd wanted to." Unarmored, Steve could mop the floor with Tony, but in the armor, Tony could go toe-to-toe with just about anyone short of the Hulk. And that wasn't even counting the repulsor gauntlets, which, as Tony had pointed out, could be deadly weapons.
St. Vincent's lab facilities were not as nice as the Avengers' lab. At least they had an entire section to themselves, since Hank had scared all of the hospital employees away. Peter was currently performing what was probably the fifth test of their unknown toxin with St. Vincent's gas chromatograph, while Hank examined yet another blood sample.
"I know why some victims are more strongly affected than others," Hank announced, not looking up from what he was doing. "One of the compounds that causes the endocrine reaction bonds with serotonin in the brain and becomes inert. They can't have meant it to do that; it must be an oversight."
Jan would be there. She might even be leading the post-mortem on the fight with Agatha Harkness and the Masters of Evil. She and Steve alternated as chairman of the team these days.
Tony grinned, and his eyes looked very blue.  “Great, then dance with me.  I want to see the expression on Assemblyman Liefeld's face when he has to watch Captain America dancing with another man.”  He nodded at the State Assembly's minority leader, who had carefully avoided greeting either of them when they arrived.
“Mmm,” Tony mumbled.  “Good.”  His eyelids were starting to droop, and his voice had gone distant, as if he were half-asleep.  “C’mere.”  He tugged slightly on Steve’s hand, still in his, and Steve obediently bent down.
Steve began pacing back and forth from the massive black gas range to the table, still strewn with cookbooks. John Walker's book of manly grilling recipes had been relegated to the far corner of the table, along with a vegetarian cookbook that he was pretty sure belonged to Wonder Man - Simon went through periodic health-nut phases that only ever lasted until the next time Beast showed up bearing grocery bags full of Twinkies and potato chips. "Strange doesn't like to leave the Village, unless it's to visit other dimensions. Maybe you'd better send Tony here. Wanda, too. She'll be able to give Strange a rundown on what happened." And, Loki or no, she was still the Avengers' expert on chaos magic.
Don shoved the thought aside as the elevator came to a halt. He might as well wish for the ability to raise the dead, while he was at it. Asgardian cosmology wasn't as forgiving as some.
"I don't want to think about where the mass went." Tony waved a hand dismissively. "The more I think about it, the less sense it makes."
"Morals," Steve said firmly. "Ethics. The Geneva Convention. Or the fact that a lot of your plans involve disturbingly high chances of you blowing up."
“I know flowers aren’t your thing, though,” Tony was continuing.  “I’ll take you on a real date eventually.”
"Besides," Tony added, "Happy was the one who always looked like a thug." He hesitated, looking away at the woodcut over Steve's shoulder. Steve was struck again by how tired he suddenly looked. "The more expensive the suit, the more he looked like hired mob muscle," Tony finished, voice subdued.
Barnes snorted.  "An office building would work just fine.  All you need is someplace with a basement.  Or a storage or service area that no one checks that often.  Hell, a restaurant with a walk-in freezer would work."
Steve touched the end of his tongue to his torn lip; it was still bleeding sluggishly. He scrubbed the back of his hand across his mouth, trying to wipe the blood away.
Of course, it wasn't necessarily bad driving on the would-be robber's part that had caused this. According to the police databases and radio frequencies Tony had been watching, traffic accidents were yet another thing that had increased in the vicinity of the cathedral, like muggings, domestic violence calls, and a bunch of other petty, every-day evils that superheroes could do nothing to stop.
Again, there was no response, and Steve glanced up at the green lines and curves of the EEG read-out, wondering whether Tony was actually seeing him, or if he was looking through Steve, to someone or something else. He had obviously been hallucinating earlier, with his talk about blood and bodies.
Something was glowing up ahead, an eerie green that didn't look or feel like Chthon's power, yet still felt like chaos.
The inside of the cathedral was dark, illuminated only by the candles on the high altar, and by the flickering red glow of a dozen or so tiny votive candles left burning below the image of the Blessed Virgin. A middle-aged white man in a green windbreaker was praying at one of the stations of the cross; he didn't look up when they entered, Strange's magic subtly clouding his perceptions and hiding the two of them from his sight.
He had considered Tony Stark a brother, one nearly as close to him as Baldur, or Volstagg, or Beta Ray Bill. Or Captain America, whom Thor had searched for amongst the valorous dead and, when he had failed to find him, mourned for. His father's handmaidens had been the choosers of the slain, and a fallen warrior who had believed in him — and friendship could be accounted belief, if one was creative — always had a place in Valhalla.
"Yeah, thanks for that, by the way." Rhodes' voice was not quite sarcastic, but only by a small margin. "You did hear the part where I said they're suing us?"
That was when the channel five news van arrived, unusually late on the scene - normally, they beat the police to the site of a super-powered fight by a large margin. Steve seized eagerly on Jan and Sam's offer to deal with them, probably prompted by the stiff way he was moving, and escaped inside as quickly as he could, Tony hot on his heels.
Steve picked it up, careful of the broken glass. Underneath it was a framed pen and ink sketch of the city skyline that had once hung in the tower's kitchen.
Steve blinked, and his attempt to slip sideways and let Tony's left-handed jab slide past him yet again did not quite succeed. "No?" he said, absorbing the blow and squaring off to deliver a few more of his own.
Amazingly, the guard started strolling casually toward them, as if nothing was out of the ordinary.  He couldn't see them well enough to realize that Don and Hank were partially free, Don realized, not coming from the brightly lit other room into the dark open space of the warehouse floor.
Tony had lied to him, manipulated him, but deep down, he had the uncomfortable feeling that he might be secretly grateful for it, at least a little. He hadn't had to make the kind of choices Tony had, and even though he'd deserved the right to make them... he couldn't help but be a little glad that, in the end, he hadn't had to. He hadn't knowingly supported the things SHIELD and the House Unregistered Superhuman Activities Committee had been doing in secret. He'd only had to sell out a little, not sell out all the way, and he certainly hadn't been made to pay for it the way some people had. His family had paid, Aunt May had paid, but it could have been so much worse.
Steve wasn’t sure what she saw on his face this time – he was almost running out of the energy to react to bad news – but she hurried on.
Agatha Harkness had let out a scream of rage and turned on Loki, who had waved aside the spell she threw at him as if it were nothing before disappearing again. Then she had turned her attentions to Wanda, the only remaining potential vessel for Chthon to inhabit. Wanda had been able to defend herself, but Agatha's smoke tentacles had made it impossible for any of the rest of them to strike a blow against her, and the stalemate had been broken only by the arrival of Strange and Clea, his other student, who had joined forces with Wanda to cut off Agatha's access to Chthon's power and take her down.
Don reclaimed his walking stick and used it to push himself to his feet; the nurse he’d managed to catch between patients had told him that Hank was in stable condition, that there hadn’t been any neurological damage, and the multiple organ failures they had been afraid might occur hadn’t happened, but he’d feel better if he could read Hank’s chart for himself.
Normally, she'd enjoy taking him out on the way in, but it could wait until she had the spear.  She'd have magic power of her own then, enough that his invulnerability and brutish strength would be no obstacle.
They had all been adults, and most of them had had teammates to try and help them deal with it. All except Peter, who had handled being a fifteen-year-old solo hero far better than anyone ought to have expected him to.
Important business was going to be transacted at that party. Deals would be made, information would be exchanged, and prospective business partners would be quietly sounded out. As much business got done in this town over drinks and seemingly casual conversation at parties and on golf courses as ever did in the boardroom. He had already let himself fall out of the loop by not going to the right handful of bars anymore - to any bars - or meeting the right people for drinks. He couldn't afford to start missing major social functions on top of it, especially not right now.
"By the time I found out, the whole thing was over," Clint said, feeling thoroughly on the defensive now. "That's why I was mad, because Wanda didn't tell me about it until it was too late to do anything."
Hank refilled his glass, and held it up. "Since I seem to be the only person in the room who doesn't find Steve's sex life an object of constant fascination, and since Tony, Jan, and Wanda don't seem to be interested in taking their turns: I've never been captured and tied up by a supervillain."
"Master's?" Wanda forced back the dizziness from the drugged tea, thanking whatever powers watched over witches and mutants that she had only taken a few sips of it, and raised her hands, letting her chaos power gather around them.
The lab was empty — of people, anyway. The cat was sprawled out across Tony's drafting board, one arm hooked over the top to keep himself from sliding down the incline. Several well-chewed pencils and a shredded blue-print were scattered on the table around him.
"I wouldn't know," Wanda said wryly, and Clint felt a moment of intense gratitude that nothing that left permanent scars or damage had happened to her, that no one had hurt her that badly. And also, selfishly, that he himself had never been under long-term mind control.
"Stephen Strange," Agatha was saying. "Are you sure that's a good idea? His power is very different from yours."
"At least you don't have to keep it classified anymore." Making the students cover up the death of one of their classmates had been one more thing Hank had hated having to do.
"I don't care how thorough it is," Tony snapped, glaring up at Hank. "I just want you to undo it." He was used to having to look up at Hank, but never when Hank was normal-sized. It was a new and not particularly pleasant experience.
Trying to took so much energy, more these days than it had before he'd been exposed to AIM's toxin — or maybe it just felt that way — but it was worth it. More than worth it.
This time, Wanda could hear the flaws in its façade, the open malevolence that Agatha Harkness had never possessed, and wondered how it had ever fooled her.
"I wanted to serve my country, and I knew that if I were completely open and forthcoming about certain aspects of myself, I wouldn't be able to. Things were different then; I don't know if I would make the same decision now."
“I convinced them to let me out of bed, but I think they were planning to get me up and walking around soon anyway.”
He rubbed his head and side blissfully against Tony's ankles as the elevator started to descend, looking up at Steve with a smug expression in his huge blue eyes. '
He gritted his teeth and reached for it again, only to have it snatched out of his grasp by a blur of brown and white feathers.
Nick gave him a flat look. "Yeah, but why now? And why bother with those men when it's the people right here in this room that she wants? Little Miss Crazy's always been the impulsive type. These attacks are targeted, planned. Without Daddy to hold her leash, who's givin' her orders?"
Jack had gone through hell for hours every day to try and keep his powers under control, to avoid hurting anyone else – or destroying himself – with an accidental discharge of energy. Nothing Chthon could have done to him could have been crueler.
The single spell remaining from that grimoire would let her claim the power of the spear for herself. It wasn't the cosmic cube, lost with her father's first death, but it would do. America would burn — the world would burn — and from the ashes would arise a new order, in her father's image.
"Your aura has altered." Strange was staring intently at him now, the piercing blue gaze unnerving, as if Tony were a particularly interest specimen on a lab table. "Here." One gloved hand traced a circle in the air just over Tony's heart, and Tony felt his stomach lurch.
Hank shook his head.  "I don't know."  He leaned his head backward against the brick wall and sighed.  "I don't know," he repeated.  "I don't know what happened to any of them."
"I can't give you anything for the pain until Clint comes back with Strange on the line," Hank said apologetically. Now that he'd established that Tony wasn't in immediate danger of dying, he felt generally useless. Which, if this was like most cases of spontaneous abortion, he pretty much was.
"They're not," Steve said, meeting Sam's eyes and seeing by the look in them that his next words weren't necessary. He said them anyway. "She's not working alone."
"Yes. I left the ice pack in the kitchen. I don't think it's actually as bad as it looks, though." Nothing was torn, after all, or moving his arm would be infinitely more painful. "It really is just bruises, and I heal from those pretty quickly."
It wasn't that funny, but Steve found himself smiling anyway. Smiling was better than the alternative. "I'm glad you're not hurt. I was worried there was something else wrong with your heart."
"I needed an excuse to leave the room anyway. He had Tony take his shirt off so he could get a better read on... something. I don't know. It apparently required bare skin." He paused, making a wry face, and added, "Tony makes a disturbingly attractive woman."
"This is the second time I've had this conversation this week," Steve found himself saying, more plaintively than he would have liked to. "Why would anyone think that I would hurt Tony, or that I'm not serious about him or that I don't have enough experience to keep him satisfied?" He could feel his ears turning red, remembering Pepper's comment about that.
The music playing in the background finally registered, and inspiration struck. "You're required to dance at least one dance at these things," Tony informed Rhodey. "The hosts insist on it. Let's go get it over with."
Loki swung around to look at him, putting her back toward Don. "Bold words, from a mortal with no powers to his name. My business is with Thor, not you."
"Why do they keep asking me about that?" He gave them the same answers every time, the only answers he had. "Do they think my reasons are going to change?"
"I think what we're all trying to say," Tony announced loudly, "is that your presence in my lobby is making everyone in the building nervous. I suggest you leave before we end up having to make you. If your offer is sincere, we can discuss it somewhere else. Someplace I haven't just spent several million dollars repairing." He raised both hands, the repulsor ports in his palms a glaringly bright blue-white. "These may not be able to kill you, but I can guarantee it will be painful."
He glanced back over his shoulder as the armor's short-range sensors registered someone approaching at a run, ready to turn and defend Thor's back against more copies of Doom, and relaxed when Steve dashed into the room, shield raised.
Wanda smiled slightly.  "He can be over-protective.  He tried to do that to the Avengers a few times when I first joined, and we ended up having to rescue him from the Swordsman."
There was a moment of silence, during which Tony imagined that he could hear Hill grinding her teeth, and then she said, "I'll be there in ten minutes," and hung up. Presumably, he was meant to note that she hadn't needed to ask where he was and be impressed by SHIELD's ability to track his cellphone signal.
"Whatever Doom's got in mind for us will probably make Don's blood eagle look mild.  It's probably going to be so gruesome and excruciatingly painful that a quick death would be a mercy."
Tony shifted uncomfortably, rubbing at his chin with his hand and feeling the rasp of his goatee against his palm. As frustrating as the Extremis's new limits were, they weren't completely unmanageable – he'd functioned without it, been Iron Man without it, for years. Even if the Mandarin's rings had burned his Extremis abilities out of him entirely, the way he'd initially feared, he didn't need to sense the armor in order to wear it and control it. He would have missed it, though, like missing a limb he'd only recently grown but had already come to rely upon. Like missing the burn of alcohol against the back of his throat.
"You know perfectly well I can do my own maintenance work," Rhodey was saying. "How many days did Pepper make you promise to stay out of the lab and away from your armor?"
that needs forgiveness?" She expected this kind of self-recriminating stupidity from Tony, but Clint? How bad a number had Wanda done on his head, for him to blame himself? "You were mind-controlled, Clint."
Hyde doubled over, the breath wooshing out of him, and his huge, sausage-fingered hands closed around Steve's ankle, gripping so tightly that it felt as if his bones were being ground together.
Tony hadn't sacrificed his integrity, his reputation, half his friendships, and far too many people's lives to have anti-superhuman sentiment break out all over again. Not when they'd finally managed to turn the tide of public opinion and get Registration repealed.
In fact, if you reverse engineered Reed's design and built a copy of it out of stolen Chinese and Lemurian parts, and substituted Antarctic vibranium for anti-matter as the power source, and then used it to bounce someone into the Negative Zone and then out of it again at a different location, the way one would bounce a radar signal off of...
"Considering how easy it is to hack into your system, I think I'd prefer to do this in person." 'Easy' was something of an overstatement, but given that both the Mandarin and Red Skull had been able to infiltrate the old Helicarrier's security systems, take over SHIELD's satellites, and plant double agents in their ranks, it wasn't beyond the realm of probability that Doom had done the same thing. Or that some of the Red Skull's agents might still be in place.
The spells in the Book of the Vishanti were not intended for chaos magicians created to serve as avatars for Chthon.
"I guess that would take priority over me," Tony admitted. It was, he had learned over the years, better not to ask too many questions about the kinds of things Strange did or fought. It only made his head hurt.
"Six-forty-five." Pepper shut the PDA off and tossed it onto her desk, which was spotlessly neat in comparison with Tony's own mess of forms, papers, blueprints, and empty coffee mugs. There was brightly colored paperweight shaped like a flamingo that Tony knew had been a gift from Happy sitting alone on the desk's far corner, in its own little quarantine of tastelessness, at odd with the somber black of her blotter, keyboard, and computer monitor.
She weighed almost a hundred pounds less than Steve did; he didn't even have to adjust the armor's power output to compensate.
Less than half a year ago, Steve had stood downstairs in the burned-out shell of this building and said goodbye to Tony for good. Having Tony right there next to him, sweaty and messy-haired and smelling like sex and expensive aftershave and hot metal, was a gift he still hadn't completely gotten used to.
"Good. May and I saw some footage of the building evacuation on the news, and it was pretty gruesome. There were a lot of people in that restaurant."
"Mr. Byrne." She stood and extended her hand as the reporter reached their table. "We're so glad you could make it here this afternoon."
This, now, with Steve wasn't going to last either, he knew. As much as he found himself wishing that it could, Tony wasn't going to lie to himself; eventually, he was going to revert back to his own gender, and then Steve would understandably lose interest in the physical part of their relationship. And even if that didn't happen, if Tony turned out to be stuck this way, Steve would eventually find someone who deserved him more than Tony did, who could make him happier than Tony could. Someone like Sharon Carter, whom he'd had a crush on for ages and would probably go back to in a heartbeat if she were willing to have him; Steve had broken up with her several times before, and they always seemed to end up back together in the end. Or someone like Bernie, the woman Steve had almost married a few years ago, someone who could offer Steve a chance at a normal life. Even as a woman, that was one thing Tony couldn't give him.
Steve had lain down on the couch, intending to just close his eyes for a few minutes and then get right back up again, claiming that he was too keyed up to sleep and might as well make himself useful.  They ought to have more than just one person on alert in case Doom picked these next few hours to make his move.
She was standing by a glass display case when they reached her, staring down at an old, leather bound book that had been carefully propped open to show an elaborate print of the symbols of the zodiac. The red leather of the cover and binding had faded to a rusty brown, and the pages were faded and worn.
Tony shifted a little closer to him just in case.  "Give up, Doom.  Even if you get out of that box, there's an energy field surrounding the mansion and grounds that disrupts access to the Negative Zone.  Next time you try to break into my house, try not to do it using a copy of technology I worked on."
Steve was starting to regret not taking the rest of his costume off before getting into the shower. The wet leather provided good friction, but it was much too tight now, and he wanted it gone, wanted as much of his skin touching Tony's skin as possible.
"That was better," Steve said, grinning at Tony, who was now flat on his back on the mat with Steve straddling him, using his ‘extra mass’ to pin him in place. "You're actually trying this time, but I still took you down pretty quickly. Come on, rich boy," he added, smirking down at Tony, "give me a real challenge."
"You could say that," Tony admitted, with a smile he didn't feel. Mind control was not something he particularly wanted to talk about right now, but Clint was clearly worried about something.
"Sin just disappeared," Steve said, grimly. "Some kind of spell, or teleportation device, I don't know." Whatever it was, it was nothing he'd ever seen her or the Red Skull use before, which meant she'd had outside help.
Jan, now half again as tall, had woken up several times, slightly more lucid each time. The last time, she'd pulled out her various IV and monitor lines, walked out into the hallway where Hank had been pacing nervously back and forth, and hauled him into her room, where she'd then apparently collapsed on him. The hospital staff hadn't been pleased with Jan being ten feet tall in the first place, and had unsurprisingly liked this even less. Steve had come out of Tony's room long enough to tell them to leave Hank and Jan alone, which they then had. He had a feeling the blonde nurse from earlier wouldn't have been so easily cowed, but this was a new shift.
"This is not the same as Registration!" Tony snapped, finally losing control over his temper. "And even if it were, compromise was the safest course of action then, and it's the best one now."
The communicator wasn't dead.  He could feel it transmitting, if he concentrated, though doing so made his temples throb warningly.  It just wasn't picking anything up, and Steve's frequency wasn't working either.  What was-
"What?" He was supposed to talk to someone? Steve looked up at Carol, dragging his eyes away from Tony with an almost physical effort. "Who?"
Steve stared after him for a moment, then wrenched his gaze away from the broken window and the empty space beyond and turned to Clint. "Give Jan to War Machine. He'll take her down."
She pulled open the door to reveal Agatha Harkness standing on the front steps, in a familiar old-fashioned dress that made no concessions to the cold weather. After four hundred years spent living in and around New England, snow probably didn't bother her.
"Another warehouse."  That had looked an awful lot like this warehouse, right down to the brick walls and metal ceiling beams.  "Or maybe a different part of this one.  The ceiling looks familiar."
"Can't you be a little late?" Steve asked, taking Tony by the wrist and pulling him up into a sitting position. He kept hold of Tony’s wrist for a moment longer, squeezing it lightly. "A quinjet can get you to DC in twenty minutes."
By the time he returned to the mansion, the Helicarrier's engines repaired and Barnes under observation in SHIELD's infirmary, it was four in the morning, and Hank had long since gone back to Stark Tower.
"The book."  Steve was already moving toward the door, his bare feet silent on the wooden floor.  "They're after the book.  How did-"
Somewhere behind Clint, the elevator doors closed, quietly, like they were trying not to disturb them.
It made no sense. Clint had been her friend for over a decade. He thought of the Avengers as his family. Even if he had believed that she had amnesia, he wouldn't have simply left her there. He wouldn't have slept with an amnesiac woman who didn't recognize him, either. She knew Clint, and that wasn't the kind of man he was – Clint rarely had casual sex, for all that he liked to act like a ladies' man occasionally. Well, except for that one time with Jan, and that had been an unqualified disaster all around.
It took him a moment to find Wanda – he still looked automatically for bold colors, and the steel-grey dress she and Jan had found at the last minute was the sort of thing the eye skimmed over without really seeing. Neutral, cool.
Jan had had to steel herself in order to come down to Hank's lab. Leaving it again was much easier, but not, for the first time in months, because it meant that she was getting away from him. She'd had an entire conversation with Hank, and walked away neighed angry, disappointed nor worried. Maybe Tony being changed back to normal hadn't been the only piece of magic to happen today.
By next week, half the tabloids in the US would be asking those unspecified questions for her, in bold, two-inch headlines. And answering them.
"You know how it took me a while to turn up again after I came back from the dead?" Clint started. He was picking at a loose thread on the knee of his jeans, slowly turning a small hole in the fabric into a larger one.
Tony was attracted to him. Tony cared whether or not Steve was interested in him. Tony considered Steve to be "the right kind of man," whatever that meant.
What-  She shouldn't be able to hit so hard.   It was like being smacked around by the Hulk.   Even with magically boosted strength, Sin was barely five foot four and shouldn't have had the leverage to throw him around like that.
"And so when Don wouldn't gossip with you about your teammate's personal medical information, you figured you come ask me?"
The Red Skull had "given" him false memories — ones where he'd been the sort of stereotypical street gang member the Red Skull had probably thought all young, black men were — and had tried to use him as a pawn against Steve.  The only positive thing to come out the whole experience had been Redwing.  "You're insane," Sam told her, and fought not to wince as her fingers tightened in his hair.
Don swatted his hands away.  "Leave it.  If I were bleeding enough for it to be a medical emergency, I'd have passed out already."  That was stretching the truth, but there wasn't anything remotely sanitary here to bandage the wound with.  Hank's clothing, covered in plaster dust and soot, certainly wasn't.  "Focus on getting us out of here.  I'll be fine as soon as I can get to Thor's hammer."
He didn't mention Tony's armor. Thor had spent most of the past couple of weeks not mentioning Tony, or Hank. It was hard to blame him, as much as part of Steve wanted to come to Tony's defense, but it made for uncomfortable strategy sessions, since he wouldn't speak directly to the two of them, either.
Sam had stepped up to flank Steve's right side, Redwing no longer perched on his wrist.  Carol would be overhead now; he knew without having to look.  Between the four of them, Strange, and Wong, they had them surrounded and outnumbered three to one.  He caught Sam's gaze, then Clint's, nodding towards Doom's back.  Carol and Strange could take Loki.
Avengers were supposed to be the good guys, and he had trusted them. Don wasn't the one who had been cloned, whose DNA had been experimented with and used to create monsters, but the betrayal was no less personal for that.
Time was limited, however, and the need to divert some of his attention away from his plans was a constant hindrance. Still, Latveria would not rule itself.
Tony gave Ben his best bland smile. "Wanda spent the past year in Transia, her home country. She lost a great deal when Ultron attacked us; she and the Vision were married for years. Anything more than that is Wanda's story to tell. As for the X-gene, Dr. Pym can tell you far more about that than I can. It's a combination of genes, some of them encoding the potential for mutant abilities, and some of them governing the expression of those abilities, and no one in the scientific community has been able to figure out how or why so many people's abilities were suppressed, much less how they began working again. I don't believe in miracles, but I do believe in science, and much as it pains me as a scientist and an engineer, in magic, and I believe that there has to be an explanation, either scientific or supernatural. I just don't know what it is."
"Maybe he's – she's," Tony corrected himself, "maybe she's not here to fight. Maybe she's just here to taunt us."
Technically, as chairperson, she had the power to asked them point blank what the problem was, and whether it would interfere with their ability to work together as a team, but in practice... almost no one but Steve or Thor ever took advantage of that power.
Unless... Steve shoved the thought away. Sin couldn't have meant that bit about 'Daddy and I' literally. Red Skull was dead. He had to be dead.
He looked away, and grasped for a new subject. "According to Steve, Fury's afraid Doom's still working with Red Skull."
Jan looked away from Byrne, back to Tony, to see how he was handling this. He was blank-faced, but his hands, which had been folded loosely in front of him on the table, were now so tightly clenched that she could see his tendons.
"Yeah," Rhodey snorted. "Because you were really in a state to give me instructions." He turned back to Steve. "It's not a choice for these kids; their powers aren't some experiment they volunteered for, or a suit of armor that they can take off if they can't handle it. If no one takes responsibility for training them, they're going to get hurt, and they're going to hurt other people."
Steve left Tony shrugging out of his shirt and went to get him dry clothes. He'd seen Tony naked before, but that had been before the artificial heart. He'd just drop the clothes off and then give Tony some privacy to get showered and changed.
Clint ducked low under a laser blast and rolled, coming up to one knee and knocking an arrow in one smooth motion. Jan, beside him, was slightly slower to dodge, the laser catching her on the shoulder.
"What should I do?" Steve asked, his stomach going tight with old, familiar fear. Tony's heart was going to stop beating right in front of him; he was going to keel over, blue-lipped and gasping, and then-- "Can you charge it up here?" he asked, ruthlessly cutting off that line of thought, "Or do I need to call Happy or Pepper or somebody?"
"I know," Clint agreed. "I mean, I didn't know. I..."  Maybe Cage and Rand were looking for an extra member for their Heroes for Hire group. Or maybe Rhodes would take him on as part of his superhero training program. Working with Rhodey wouldn't be so bad; he'd done it before, and it had worked well before half their teammates had been... possessed. Oh God.
Except that if there was one thing his handful of months as Director of SHIELD had taught him, it was that you didn't throw potential allies away, even if they personally scared the hell out of you. You never knew when someone significantly scarier was going to show up.
"No, Nurse," Clint glanced quickly at the woman's name tag, "McCall. We're not. But Jan's ex-husband isn't here yet, and Tony doesn't have any relatives." He paused, "Well, except for some cousin who tried to kill him once, but I don't think they're on speaking terms. So we're the best you've got."
Sam, Wanda, and Barnes all looked uncomfortable; he was probably going to regret having this out in front of them later, but at the moment, Tony couldn't summon the extra energy to care.  "I'm sorry I scared you, but we don't have time for this right now.  Dealing with Doom is more important."
"I've been told on good authority that having sex with someone when they're too drunk to say yes or no is something like assault," Tony said slowly. It wasn't a question with a clear-cut answer, particularly since he only knew what Clint had just told him, and Clint didn't know the whole story himself. "Being under mind-control is kind of like being drunk; you're not in control of your actions, so I guess it would be the same thing. If anything, if you were under some kind of mind-control, she took advantage of you."
“Wanda,” he managed.  He cleared his throat, and the next part came out significantly less hoarse.  “They let you up.”
"No," Carol snapped, glaring at the cars ahead of them. "Somebody needed to stop her. She's a menace. Look what she did to us, to Scott, to Vision, to her own brother. You don't come back from that kind of crazy. That's supervillain crazy"
To ordinary eyes, the inside of the cathedral must have looked entirely normal, the stone wall and polished wooden pews glowing warmly in the dim light. The tiny brass number plates that marked each pew gleamed brightly, and the heavy gold embroidery on the green altar cloth blazed in the candlelight. Chthon's presence did not exist on the physical plane – it would not tarnish the brass candlestick holders or stain the altar screen or heavy wooden crucifix.
Steve gave him a stern look, presumably meant to convey that he was Captain America and that Tony ought to be taking this much more seriously, and furthermore, that he was not secretly snickering over the shield comment at all. Then he turned to Ben, face and voice appropriately serious.
Convinced, it turned out, because that was the only appointment Sharon had mentioned to him. She obviously didn't want Steve to know that she hadn't slept with him of her own free will, and Tony couldn't blame her.
It wasn't like last year.  These were Doombots, not Ultron clones, and Clint was still alive.  And she was in control of her own powers, her own mind.
Clint stared down at her and felt deeply useless. Yesterday, things had been on their way back to normal, if you ignored the fact that he was supposed to be dead and that Cap had been sulking over Tony not being there to a degree that surpassed even his previous sulking fits, and now Jan and Tony were hurt, and Cap, who was supposed to be the one who held things together in these kinds of situations, was visibly upset, and Wanda had maybe done something to Clint's mind.
He wasn't even sure if the snarled threat he'd delivered had come from himself or Thor.  Both, he suspected.
Wanda, laying out tarot cards on the part of the coffee table that wasn't covered in fluffs of purple down and crumbs of that styrofoamy stuff that filled the inside of quill shafts, shook her head. "He's afraid of the Dee manuscript. Redwing won't come in this part of the house, either."
"I didn't think I had too," she said dryly.  "They were practically sharing a room.  Not to mention clothing."
Sharon shook her head, a wisp of blonde hair that had escaped her tight ponytail falling into her face. "Does it really matter if it's her or him? Our people are just as dead either way. And either way, she won't stop until we capture her or kill her."
Wanda looked up, then, meeting her eyes levelly. "He was thinking the same thing I was," she said. "That Chthon may be too powerful for us to defeat on our own, should he break free, and that Loki is significantly less likely to try to destroy reality itself than Chthon is."
"Pym's got a cure!" Rhodey came skidding around the doorframe and burst into the room, nearly yelling with enthusiasm and obvious relief. Tony flinched at the noise, and Cap turned to glare viciously at Rhodey.
Calling the police, as it turned out, wasn't necessary. They arrived on the scene only moments later, sirens quiet but lights on, arrested the driver, and began taking witness statements. Apparently, the driver had been fleeing from the scene of the crime after robbing a drug store on 8th avenue.
Tony frowned, clearly about to protest this, and then his eyes widened slightly and he glanced around at the wreckage of the lab.  "Where's Doom?"
He'd given it up for Jan, Tony knew, as much as he had for himself. Tony had told himself, during those brief hours when he'd thought the Extremis was dead, scoured out of him by the Mandarin's lightning, that the armor was a small price to pay for having Steve back. And it would have been, but giving it up one day at a time, knowing all the while that all he had to do was change his mind in order to have it back again... It was hard enough to fight that knowledge every time someone at the next table ordered a drink, or every time Logan had sliced the cap off a bottle of beer; he wasn't sure he could have managed to do it when it came to the armor.
"Like witchcraft?" Agatha pursed her lips. "You should have come to me, child. I know more about witchcraft than any woman alive. I have studied it for over three hundred years."
"We weren't great at plans, when we were his age." Clint shrugged one shoulder. "I don't know. I think you and Spiderwoman should keep an eye on him. Sanity is optional for supervillains." He glanced back over his shoulder to where Thor and Jan were talking to two uniformed policemen and a woman with a microphone and a plastic smile. "Jan's waving at you," he added. "I think you're on deck."
The manuscript case looked lonely and out of place against the sterile metal walls; Jan had lined the bottom in red velvet, like a display case. She'd suggested that they donate the thing to the museum when the book was returned, as a gesture of good will.
Hank hissed something about booby traps and security under his breath, then asked, more loudly, "How long have we been here?"
The infirmary, he explained when he reached them, was not one of the Helicarrier's conference rooms, and everyone who wasn't a patient could go and find themselves one.
"People on the internet think what?" the Falcon asked, raising his eyebrows in open skepticism. "Ignore it. People will say anything on the internet."
"We just broke through to the aquifer last month," Dr. Avison cut in quickly. "There have been a few kinks we had to work out, but overall things have proceeded almost exactly as planned. Would you like to view the diagrams of our filtration system?"
Steve rolled over, propping himself up on his elbow, and looked at Tony. It was the middle of the night, and not much light filtered in through the bedroom window, but there was sufficient illumination for Steve to make out the way Tony's eyebrows were drawn together into a thin, unhappy line.
"I can't believe you're actually meeting with a publicist," Clint snorted, as they reached the exit into the main concourse, where there were three times as many people as there had been in baggage claim. "You've been in LA too long."
"Covering for you?" Sam shrugged. "I figure you've done enough interviews about why you decided to put the costume back on. Plus, any time they get a chance to talk to Captain America, they hang around twice as long as they do for the rest of us."
At least it gave Steve something to focus on other than the things Doom had thrown in his face last night.
Steve shook his head. Turning around was automatic; after years of dealing with Tony as Iron Man, Steve could carry on a conversation with Tony without needing to see his face, but hearing Tony's voice coming from just over his shoulder made the skin on the back of his neck tingle distractingly. "If it was just our reputations at stake, I wouldn't hide anything." Steve met Tony's gaze, hoping the words sounded sincere, and not like empty rhetoric. He meant them – their relationship was not the media's business, and part of him cringed at the idea of having it dragged through the headlines and discussed on talk shows as if it were something tawdry and sordid, something to be ashamed of, but hiding it was like a silent agreement that there
Wanda nodded, her mouth set in a grim line.  "Let's go find the real Doom," she said, "and ask him about it."
The Doombots' green surcoats and capes were on fire, burning with the same green flame that hedged them all in, and white and red chaos lightning crawled over their metal armor.  Only one still looked normal, and he was trying to simultaneously destroy one of the others and attack a twelve-foot-tall Jan.
"Iron Man is fine," Tony snapped. Hank glanced back over his shoulder to see him propped up on one elbow, glaring poisonously at the crowd in the doorway. "Now go the hell away."
"Of course it does," Tony interrupted. "You're you. Always so chivalrous; it's one of the things I like about you."
Tony sank down to sit on the tile floor, his back against the cool metal and frosted glass blocks of the stall dividers, and pulled out his Avengers communicator, flipping it to the West Coast team's frequency.
"All I promised Pepper was that I'd stay home from work today," Tony countered. "Steve's the one who made me promise to stay out of the lab. And that I wouldn't use the Extremis to telecommute."
"No." Tony shook his head, the hard ridges of the scale mail scraping against his cheek. Then, again, more forcefully. "No. Don't leave."
The chaos around them surged again, and for a moment, she could see nothing but black and red, hear nothing but Chthon's whispers.  Then they were descending.
Then Barnes started throwing up again, the kind of dry, wracking heaves you made when there was nothing left in your stomach to expel, and all joking abruptly ceased.
Tony’s eyes were closed, his breath coming in small, shallow pants, but he flinched visibly when Steve put pressure on the wound.
No, Steve answered her silently, because that would require actually having the guts to show up in person. He wished they had shown their faces, whether 'they' was in fact A.I.M. or some other group; someone ought to be made to answer for this.
Steve didn't answer, just leaned his head back against the boxes and enjoyed the afterglow. It was a rhetorical question, anyway. After a few minutes, when the energy began to slowly seep back into his limbs, he asked, "What have you told Washington about the mutant situation?"
The Helicarrier's temperature controls were always set slightly too low, something he'd never quite gotten around to fixing when he'd been in charge, and he'd spent the past twenty minutes alternately sitting and lying on a metal table with no shirt on. From some women, he might have suspected ulterior motives, but Maya had always set flirtation aside when a matter of scientific interest presented itself. Well, most of the time.
"Actually," Tony said, for the sake of accuracy, "he can't.  Not as long as the Helicarrier's in motion."
"No," Carol agreed, "we're talking about Wanda. We screwed up, big time. We should have gone to get her as soon as Clint came back and we knew where she was. We shouldn't have let Chthon take her in the first place. But we did, and he did, and if he gets his hooks into her again, he could turn Manhattan into a smocking crater."
"Jack started it," Steve mumbled, his entire face aflame. "He looked so lost all the time, and… saying no would have been like kicking a puppy." Actually verbalizing the reasons made them sound even flimsier, and even more like he'd taken advantage of Jack's obvious and occasionally embarrassing case of hero worship.
"It was a little too one-sided to call it a fistfight," Rhodes admitted, sounding chagrined. "Ultron was an accident. I meant to knock the hell out of Tony. He was just trying to stop me from being an idiot, and when
Just before he completely fell apart. Before he'd vanished off the radar, before Steve had tracked him down to that seedy hotel room where he'd been hell-bent on drinking himself into oblivion, had tried to get through to him and failed.
The whine of Thor's spinning hammer abruptly ceased, and Thor landed in the middle of the street with a thud Tony could feel in his bones. "The last of the vapors have dispersed. The air is once more safe to breathe."
Jan had put styling products he hadn't bothered to ask the names of in his hair, somehow transforming his expensive but now slightly-too-long haircut into something that looked cute, feminine, and like he'd had it done on purpose, and attacked his face with brushes and tiny little make-up pads. The resultant coat of make-up was almost invisible, except for the way it made his face look.
Clint was smirking broadly; it was nice to see that one of them was enjoying themselves. "I thought we were using the Tony Stark definition of sex, not the Bill Clinton one."
"I know that," Peter mumbled, "but... I have been mad at him, and he is poisoned, and..." he trailed off, because that sounded exactly as stupid as it was.
Tony rolled his eyes, secure in the knowledge that no one could see his face. "There are times when you're even less mature than Spiderman, Hawkeye." He probably should have been amused by it; people had been reacting to his sex life with everything from envy to disgust since he'd been seventeen. He didn't feel like being amused; his head hurt, his chest hurt, and reporters were starting to cast glances in their direction.
If it were activated, Peter would probably be able to track him down; it operated on a frequency similar to his spider trackers.
Thor cleared his throat, looking both startled and concerned. "I cannot apologize enough for the indignities you have suffered on my account, Iron Man." He hesitated. "Or should I be offering my congratulations?"
The office, when he left the elevator and the two awe-stricken men in business suits who had shared it with him, proved to be a cold, barren space. Massive windows let in sunlight, but the furniture was spare and angular, and everything gleamed black and silver, like rock limned with ice.
Doom was not the only one with access to ancient grimoires. Her father had preferred more conventional — and reliable — means of gaining power, but had been wise enough to take advantage of magic when the opportunity arose.
He almost reached out to take Steve's hand, then remembered just in time that his left arm was a tangle of tape and plastic tubing and moving it would pull at the IV.
not to use them. Because not using his powers was better than being miserable and out of control all the time, and being left out of things was better than losing it at the wrong moment.
Before Steve could answer, Sam's gaze fixed on his face, and he raised his eyebrows, adding, "Don't tell me; you finally tripped over your shield. That's what you get for keeping it on the floor next to your bed."
"Stark Tower has a lot of innocent bystanders in it," Jan said slowly. She looked faintly apologetic, as if she didn't like pointing it out.
"That's good, I guess." Very good, actually. He might still be angry with Tony, and disappointed that his friend had turned out to be not quite the man Steve had thought he was, but he never wanted to repeat that horrible week the year before last, after Tony had disappeared for nearly a month and then turned up again in St. Vincent's hospital, half-dead of hypothermia, malnutrition, and a raging case of pneumonia.
The punch had been deliberately easy to block, he realized, as he doubled over and fought to suck in a decent breath. Steve had distracted him with a blow he knew Tony would be able to see coming and react quickly to, and then sucker-punched him when he left his lower torso wide open.
He didn't have time to rehash the "Tony isn't good enough for you" argument right now. Not when Tony was this upset. Tony had a bad habit of doing stupid things when he was upset. "Yes, Sam," Steve snapped, "I'm a battered wife." Sam's expression shifted from concerned to annoyed, and Steve immediately felt bad; Sam had done nothing to merit being snarled at. "I asked for it," he elaborated. "I know better than to shake people awake from nightmares." Sam would understand that; Steve knew he'd accidentally clocked his friend at least once, when his own nightmares periodically resurfaced.
"Do you think it's possible that my powers somehow affected Tony?" she asked Agatha, staring down at the shifting reflections in her teacup. Agatha's tea service was as comfortingly familiar as her house, the roses painted on the side of the fragile china cups worn and faded with age. "That I ill-wished him somehow? I never wanted anything bad to happen to my friends, but there are times when it seems as if the people around me are cursed."
Steve didn't have to hold back, knowing that Sam was the same height as he was and closer to the same mass than either Tony or Clint. He didn't have to pull punches, because Sam wasn't going to let Steve hurt him. Not like Tony, who after years of hand-to-hand combat training still had a habit of leaving himself wide open to blows that he ought to have dodged or blocked, because the armor would have been able to absorb them.
He bent down and kissed the lop-sided circle of metal in the middle of Tony's chest, pretending it wasn't hard and cold, that it didn't taste like metal. Tony shuddered underneath him, and Steve reached down and wrapped the fingers of one hand around Tony. It took a few moments to get the rhythm right -- it had been a long time since he had done this to anyone but himself -- and then Tony was gasping something Steve couldn't decipher, his eyes closed in what looked almost like pain, but which Steve knew was anything but.
If some supervillain ever made it necessary to send Jessica back into the Shadow King's dimension... Even the thought made her stomach twist and her throat close up.
The chaos-tainted book at the museum was still unguarded, the museum administrators having taken Wanda's warning about it precisely as seriously as they did the insistence by museum staff that it was cursed. There had been a rash of minor accidents surrounding it, according to the security guard Sam had spoken to, but it was the keystone of their special exhibit, and they were reluctant to remove it.
Silently cursing Thor, and himself for being stupid enough to go along with Thor's brilliant plan to begin with, Don tried to shove himself to his feet.
Sam stepped away from the huddle of law enforcement officials and waved at Steve, coming a few steps closer to them so that they could talk without shouting. "The police want to talk to the two of you." He nodded up at where Steve's shield was lodged in the crackling remains of the billboard. "About that."
He would call, and she would come — not to the Avengers Mansion or Stark Tower, as she had no doubt expected, but to his father's throne room.  Let her see Hlidskjalf, the throne she wanted so badly.  Mayhap it would make her more likely to believe in what he would offer her.
Beside him, Clint made frustrated noise.  "I can't get through to Wanda.  Or the Helicarrier.  Or Thor.  Where the heck is he?"
"I can't tell," Tony admitted.  "He's upgraded his robots.  Even SHIELD's LMDs aren't this seamless, and I designed those."  That wasn't entirely true —
Tony didn't respond. He was sitting cross-legged on the floor of the lab, fiddling with a partially assembled anti-teleportation device, his head bent forward over a laptop. There were two StarkTablets lying on the floor on either side of him; a single portable computer was apparently an insufficient replacement for having the Extremis running at full capacity. He typed something into the laptop, machine-gun-fire fast, muttering, "If I increase the strength of the energy field until it can penetrate lead or two feet of concrete, the radiation it gives off goes above fifty millirems, and that's unacceptable."
Steve grimaced. "Nice surprise for the emergency personnel when they arrived on the scene. They shouldn't have to worry about that kind of thing." It was difficult enough being a firefighter or police officer in New York City without terrorist organizations trying to poison you, and men and woman who risked their lives to serve the public good deserved better.
In the recesses of his mind, Don was protesting that lithium toxicity was grave indeed, but Thor overrode him.  "Nay, I do not think he shall."  Any other outcome was unacceptable.  He would not stand helplessly by while a comrade died before his eyes due to Loki's treachery.  "But we must be gone from this place, and find him aid."
Whatever it was, Beast had thought that Wanda had done it, and therefore, that it was within her power to undo it.
Tony couldn't help smiling at little, despite everything.  That had been true of Peter even when they'd been on the same team.  The concept of checking in and telling other people what he was doing seemed to be foreign to him, and he'd only just been starting to adapt to being part of a team when everything had gone to hell.
Her knuckles stung where she’d skinned them on Doom’s mask, bits of skin torn off them.  It was a sharp counterpoint to the dull headache she’d woken up with in Doom’s warehouse, which had never quite gone away, and the muscles in her arms and legs still felt wobbly from the transition back from being goliath-sized.  Shrinking never made her feel this worn out.
"And anyway, Carol's on it." Wanda frowned, sharply arched eyebrows drawing together. "At least, I think she is."
Tony was still smirking with satisfaction when the waiter came to take their orders. He might not have Steve forever, but as long as he did, he was going to enjoy him. At least they seemed to have put the disaster with his stolen armor behind them, so when things eventually fell apart, they could still be friends.
Rhodey sighed, making a wry face. "I'm not a scientist," he said. "I'm a pilot. I'm just... I passed my limit for seeing Tony hooked up to heart monitors a long time ago."
Thor clenched his fingers around Mjolnir's handle, and curled his left hand into a fist. "He lives, yes, but not for lack of effort on your part. And he is far from the only one whose death you have sought." Jane Foster, Fandral, Hogun, Volstagg, his father, nearly every one of the Avengers at one point or another. Thor himself, countless times.
Hank half-turned, a concerned look on his face.  "It was in my pocket," he said.  "I forgot about it when I went to bed."  He was staring at Don oddly, but before Don could comment on it, he shook himself visibly and turned back to his task.  "I wish I'd forgotten the entire shrunken tool kit," he muttered.
