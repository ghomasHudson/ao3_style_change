I thought you were dead for five days. I nearly broke my heart over it. Please understand me—I am extraordinarily glad that you are safe away, that you saw your chance and took it. I only wish you would have warned me.
He was giving not an inch. Could I confess now that I troubled myself with everything about him? Would he permit me that? “I don’t like what I don’t understand. You’re a reasonable man. Don’t you have enough now?”
"Too dangerous for you. I'll rest at Mycroft's, and meet you at the station for the Continental—second first-class carriage from the front. But think, John—Europe. We'll go together—see the ocean on the crossing, the gardens, the music-halls, the mountains, if you like. You can have as much of me as you choose." And then I broke off and blushed; but he was blushing, too, and smiling.
“I’d thought in all that you’d have turned up something useful.” Lestrade was not gloating, as he would have been years ago. He sounded a little regretful, and wholly respectful. Holmes didn’t look up from the mess of paperwork spread over his workbench. We’d retrieved the whole from the Ambassador’s study, while Lestrade held the man fast in an argument two rooms away. But once home, no proof of the man’s identity could be found amongst them.
At first I thought nothing of it. Milverton had been to see me; he had been piqued by my interference, though barely concerned by it; and I supposed that he had written for himself, or written to some other party, a memorandum concerning me and what trouble he might reasonably hope to get me into. Death having come for him so suddenly, I suppose I thought the chance of trouble from that quarter was at an end. I wanted to enjoy my triumph, and to linger a little over the memory of Watson, in a black silk mask, tucked into the window-recess at my side, and clinging to my arm.
“So do I.” Mycroft is not unobservant of his brothers, nor is he a bearer of false hope. “Why didn’t he tell you before?”
Through the long evening, I kept a kind of vigil. I ate, and wrote, and read, and sat dreaming, wondering how he was, what he was doing, if anyone had taken notice of him, or if he stood alone in a corner. But as the clock struck half nine I went into his room; knowing that whether the night went well or ill he would want me. I undressed in the shadows, amid the comfortable clutter of his chamber, the scent of his tobacco and the cedar chips in his costume-chest. I stirred up the fire; his hands and feet were always cold. I set his slippers beside it to warm, and hung his soft old night-cap on the bedpost; blew out the candle, and tucked myself beneath the coverlet, thinking I surely would not sleep.
Which brought me sharply to the inevitable: I had to tell John, and then I had to get him away. He could not remain with me. He might not want to, after this. I could, very probably, have Moriarty in court in the end. He was very well-equipped in his chosen life, but so was I. But it would take time and there would be risks, enormous risks involved. If I let John be brought into it he would end in Reading Gaol in a heap of refuse with irons on his legs, and I would break my heart or lose my head, and the game would be up. So: John had to be removed from play.
But as I went on I began to have doubts. How could he imagine I would have reason to disappear into the wild without a word? How much more likely that he should walk the trail to the Falls expecting to meet me, and finding me nowhere, think he had failed me utterly? That I had been kidnapped—attacked—wounded—without him there to help me? I could imagine no greater hurt to him.
The day the letter came, and the change began, was less than a year into our affair. The whole thing seemed miraculous to me, and yet to anyone’s eye we would have appeared the same as ever. Only behind closed doors, and in the quiet of the night, was everything new. A mizzling fog had crept over the city, rendering the cold grey outdoors inhospitable, the glow of the hearth wholly heart-warming. Holmes and I had already passed several very comfortable hours settled in our chairs before a roaring fire, in the homely half-light of a stormy day, with books and tea and hot buttered toast, when the bell rang. Mrs. Hudson’s voice could be heard answering, and a minute later Billy thundered up (his enthusiasm indicating excessive boredom belowstairs) and rapped sharply at the sitting room door.
“But—” I had thought I’d understood. I looked bewildered round the room. His writing desk was, in point of fact, untouched from its arrangement the evening before; and then I saw his overshoes left by the door, still damp.
A flash of a glance, too quick to read, and then, “Mycroft has always been capable. Sherrinford takes after my father,” he said, and dropped his head back on the seat, and closed his eyes, and remained so until we pulled up before the august doors of the Diogenes. But his hand still lay in my lap, clinging to mine.
I know he slept, because he was wrapped around his pillow, open-mouthed and dreaming, when I came awake in the early morning, and went into my own room for my things. I settled in the sitting room. Mrs. Hudson brought up our breakfast, and left again; the clock ticked on. I read the newspaper through, and examined the post, and cast about me for something useful to do. It took some time, but at last I was wholly immersed in rewriting a piece for the Idler, a sketch of my time at school, which would provide me with a little pocket-change, when I heard the sitting room door open. I turned to see him entering fully dressed, dazed and blinking in the morning light. He looked miserable.
I left, and lost some indeterminate time in consideration, as I do when there’s no kind hand at my elbow to bring me back to earth—came to myself in the middle of the Jardins du Trocadéro as the sun was going down, still running round and round the facts of the event in my mind. It was possible that the cup had been intended for someone else. If not, if I had in fact been the target, someone had recognized me; someone who objected to my presence in Paris to a lethal degree. Was the unknown enemy connected to the work I was doing for the Général? Or was the source of the attempt the Professor? If the former, success in my endeavours would end the danger. If it were the Professor—then my flight from London had changed his plans, and pushed him to consider more reckless and less public methods of recompense for my interference; and I might expect the attacks to continue until I could bring him to court.
“All right,” I said, surprised. His lashes had fluttered closed as I continued to stroke his hair, his forehead, his dark brows, and I was struck with the need to bend and kiss each delicate eyelid in turn, and then the corners of his beautiful mouth, before I continued, “I was reading an article on the common prescription of lobelia in treating the asthmatic. Doctor Salter is suspicious of its popularity; he suggests cigarettes, or Indian hemp.” I went on talking to him, any ordinary nonsense that came into my head, until he was nearly asleep in my lap, the candle guttering on the table, the house fallen silent save for the sound of my voice; and then I said, “Sherlock. Come on, darling, come to bed.”
He stood watching me openly while I waited. Something shone in his gloved hand: a knife, most probably. His stance was patient: a trained man, used to waiting for his quarry, confident of his capacities. I might have anticipated this: I had been hunted for three months, and why should it stop because I had come home?
He came to me; sat on the bearskin rug at my feet, and took my ankle gently in his hand, and laid his head down in my lap. His hair has silver in it now. I buried my hand in the soft strands; drew my fingers through again and again, till his eyes grew clearer, his expression less otherworldly.
“So,” Mycroft said, after fresh tea arrived, and we had each taken a steaming cup. He settled himself into a padded rolling chair moved up before the fire, with a sigh. “Something rather dire has occurred, disturbing you, Sherlock, to the extent that you came here without warning, and brought the Doctor for support; but it is not so distressing that you would refuse refreshments, or shout out the news of it on your arrival. I conclude there is no immediate threat. Shall I deduce further what is troubling you? Or shall you tell me yourself?”
You don’t understand what it is like to love you—which, by the by, I have also done for years already; it isn’t a feeling but a fact—nor do you comprehend what a miracle you are to me. You are too secretive, and damnably unwilling to care for yourself as you should, but that will never make me tire of loving you.
And the freedom would be good. In Paris I was not notorious, I would not be spoken to in the street, I would not even appear unusual. I might stay up all night, and live on coffee and bread, and wander about bookstalls and chemists’ shops dressed in the most careless fashion, and no one would say a word.
“Harry wouldn’t know your size,” I said, staring at it too, and picked up the hand and kissed the little, rough finger with my ring on it; I couldn’t help myself. He laughed again.
“I told him enough. I made it clear that there would be no more fraternal dinners. I said I wanted no news of him. I knew Mycroft would go on seeing him, regardless, and writing to him, and worrying about him, until he was drowned in a ditch somewhere, or had his throat slit by a desperate ‘bit of scarlet’ from the godforsaken Park--forgive me.”
"Holmes." A wealth of feeling in the word. His hand still held mine; it tightened, and his face shone with sudden delight. I found myself speechless before his happiness a long moment: no one else had ever looked at me quite so.
All at once it was quite clear what I had to do. I clambered back down to the path, and caught up my staff and my pack, with all my things, put up in preparation for our evening’s stay in the next town over—my money, papers, stockings and smalls, three forged passports, and a blanket roll. There was flatbread and sausage in the side pocket, wrapped in wax paper, and I could fill my flask in the river. It would do.
“My dear boy, what do you mean?” He had drawn closer, and catching at my hand, pulled me across the room, and down, to sit pressed close upon the settee. I shivered as he touched my sore knuckles. His lovely brows drew together. “Let me see."
Sherlock appeared to be struggling with himself. Mycroft waited without impatience, delicately stirring a third lump of sugar into his tea. Finally Sherlock looked up. “Sherrinford wrote to me. You must have known he’s--marrying. He’s asked us to the ceremony.”
“No!” His lips parted at my vehemence. “No, for Heaven’s sake, don’t apologize.” I stopped under his stare.
I had not anticipated his shock. I am no stranger to John Watson at a loss and grief-stricken, but I knew him better, then, than I had at the first, and strangely that made it harder to think what to do. I sorrowed to see his loneliness. I mourned over the blackness in his gaze. His silence unnerved me. At times I even became angry—with myself, Mary, Maxwell, Providence, everyone who had known but could not help him. But I could see him making an attempt at courage every time I came into the room. He’d offer me a weary smile and a kind question. I, both shamed and heartened by it, would search my own reserves for a little more patience, a little persistence, and pick up a semi-developed solution, or a book, or again take up my violin and play for hope.
A smile lit his face, and was gone, leaving behind an expression of such deep intent that I could no longer look at him. I dropped my gaze to my hand as he took it up in his gentle one, and slid the cool, heavy little ring onto my smallest finger.
I was beginning to feel rather strange. I watched Will set out the tea tray, and Mycroft direct his arrangement, as though from far away, suspended outside of any hurry or sense of the danger at hand. When the whole was done to Mycroft’s satisfaction, and Harry had closed the door, I heard Mycroft say, “Can you sleep a little?”
“Yes. Once my brothers left he degenerated, and without anyone to help--” Here his voice failed him. I reached out at last and took his hand from his lap, and held and stroked it, until he could continue.
HAVE RECEIVED WORD OF THE MORAN MURDER STOP AM WIRING YOU FROM THE HARBOUR STOP WILL BE IN LONDON IN THE MORNING STOP THE GAME IS AFOOT STOP
I signed the letter, “William Scott.” I did not write that I loved him. I felt I did not deserve to.
“Yes, thanks.” He smiled at me again. I turned away quickly to hide a surge of gratitude so strong it frightened me. When he added, curiously, “Anything to do?” I couldn’t answer; only shook my head, and poured out his drink with a hand that was not steady.
“Your intimacies?” Heat was rising up my neck, and I prayed Heaven he would not look up at me then. He did not.
He blinked and blushed a little at the statement, or at the sound of his name; perhaps both. The use of our first names had taken on a very pleasant weight in both our minds; the circumstances under which we had begun to use “Sherlock” and “John,” within our own four walls, were memorable enough. After a moment, he sank back into his own armchair and began to make use of the pipe more steadily, letting out the smoke in slow and thoughtful streams.
We had developed a simple code, years back, for use when our communiqués might be read: I became William Scott, a periodic patient of John’s, and any threats to my life or his were transformed into the guise of William's many imaginary illnesses. Any dedicated spy would see through the ruse in a minute, but a mere casual surveillor of John’s mail would miss the point. I wrote:
“I’m sorry.” I subsided, a little ashamed, and considered. I was right in my facts, of course, but wrong in my approach. We sat in silence for some minutes while he ate and I nursed my cup of morning tea.
“One night Sherrinford came to my door with a man, a stranger. He was almost incoherent--worse than usual. I was living in a sorry little hotel. There was no one to stop him coming up; the watchman fell asleep every night, and no one cared to wake him. Sherrinford found his way to my room even in his state, somehow, and knocked, and knocked, until I opened the door--it was the middle of the night. He asked me to give him and his companion a bed. I believe he only meant to rest. Anyway, he was too drunk to fuck.”
“I can promise you your destruction, but not mine,” he snarled, and rounding about, left the room, and I was once more alone.
And then there was a change. One frosty morning he sat across from me in his old chair, smoking a cigarette, while I talked to him about the Professor; Moriarty, of infamy then still to come. I had only just recognized the fact that his name came up peripherally in case after case, a stray thought, a secret behind secrets, and that his influence was all about me in the City without anyone’s realising how he’d intertwined himself about us. I was intrigued. Disturbed, too, with a faint unease far from the loathing I would later conceive for him; but deeply interested, God help me, in a man who seemed capable of camouflaging himself and his unrighteous capacities in plain sight of society, with dignity and ease. I was talking to John, as I do at times, as though to myself, swept away in the flow of speculation, when a turn and a glance at him brought me up short.
I am accustomed to being struck speechless in his presence. I rather relish it, but this was quite beyond me. “I beg your pardon?”
I used to sleep longer. I wake up, now, feeling as though there is something to do, and then I remember I can do nothing until we know who it is that followed me to the Fall. Who I overlooked. So I make myself a cup of cocoa (I keep a tin of the powder and a kettle of water by the fire) and I walk down to the river. There are always a few birds awake, even before dawn. I never go into the laboratory until the clock strikes eight. I am trying to avoid notice. A mad chemist working his experiments in the dark of the morning might get talked about.
"You have to go home," I said, in the courtyard, over dinner. I had thought he would take it more calmly if we were in public.
“Yes. I—kissed her, Holmes, for the first time, when I pledged her my life, and it was pleasant enough; but it wasn’t much to me. I’m afraid to say—I was a little disappointed.”
“I’ll be quick,” I promised. I was finding it hard to get my breath. I unwound my scarf, stalling for time; wrapped it around his neck, and he blinked at me. I’d dragged him outside without his coat; it was a rational thing to do. But he looked at me as though I was being sweet, but puzzling; his eyebrows were being quite eloquent about it. I gave up trying to find words, then, and just pulled the little velvety box out of my coat, and laid it in my palm where he could see it. His eyes went wide.
He waited a moment and then nodded at my silence. I found myself looking at his stiff back, as he seated himself at his desk, with a finality indicating there was nothing further to be said. I thought I had better allow that to be true.
My beloved is a showman before friends, a professional with strangers, and an enigma even to me. He likes little to show himself startled before he has had time to understand things. So I waited quietly until he had read the letter through twice, and then dropped his lovely head down heavily upon the chair back, to regard the firelight dancing across our low ceiling, with a queer expression. I said, “Is it a case, then?” Clearly it was not. There was every indication that this was personal news, or a private missive, at least, and from someone unexpected. But I had not been made privy to the annals of his past, except in apparently careless remarks regarding old sparring partners and comrades at university. Our friendship was old and rich, but our love affair was new. So I waited to learn how much he wanted me to know.
“You won’t help me by catching cold. Go change your clothes.” I waited until he turned away. Then I sank into my chair. My fingers had begun to tremor. I sat, trying vainly to form a sentence in my mind which would ease him into it.
“We’ve been watching him,” he said, gently, “though I’m not certain it was necessary. He’s capable enough, as you well know.”
“No. They’ve not invited me. They understand the risks, I think, to someone in my position; and anyway, it is quite possible that their friends would not welcome me. I do not represent their best interests, officially, however benign my private attitude. But I dined with Sherrinford and Alfred last week, and we talked over their plans at some length; and I will send a gift, of course. I had thought of a dog, but they informed me with some unnecessary amusement that they have five already.”
“What? No.” He lifted his head to look at me, and his expression cleared and sharpened, and became more familiar, if still stunned. “It isn’t Mycroft, it’s Sherrinford. He’s asked us to his wedding.”
“Oh, you’ll always presume, and I’ll always let you.” Then his voice caught, as I caught his hands; and he laughed at me, and kissed me.
“For France, as soon as possible. I need time. You aren’t safe—until I find conclusive evidence against the Professor—if I can find it. Now at least we could say truthfully we had never, if it came to court—” My voice failed me. I wrung my hands in my lap; but his face had changed again.
He returned too quickly. Hair smoothed roughly back by hand, cheeks still pink with cold, his quilted emerald smoking-jacket brightening his eyes and squaring his shoulders, making him look faintly royal. Wool stockings, my gift three Christmases ago. Incongruous, shabby, soft old slippers on his feet. I looked up and found his gaze clear on me. I quailed, but felt more certain still: I could not risk him.
He shook his head. “Mycroft took me at my word; told me nothing, except to inform me when he’d moved to Islington. I assumed Mycroft had been seeing him occasionally--but--”
The confrontation between Holmes and the Professor is paraphrased pretty directly from Doyle's version in "The Final Problem," going on the principle that Holmes probably remembered it accurately and Watson would have no reason to change it. I also took Doyle's comment that Holmes was staying with Mycroft during the short time he spent in London, and played with the idea.
“Are you afraid of something? Here?” he asked. Calm eyes, steady tone, steel beneath. If we were at risk, he was ready. The feel of having him by me again in a fight—
“Well, he shook his head at that, and said, ‘No wonder.’ He sounded almost sorry. ‘You’ve been all alone,’ he said. I began to protest, but he wasn’t finished. ‘You’ve had your work, of course. Still, one begins to feel the need of a companion. I’ve known a number of fellows like you, with no natural affinity for women. Some marry anyway. Some of them go on to live quite happily on their own; philosophical company, or public works, or artistic endeavours, take up the place in their soul which a family might have come to occupy; and that is no poor outcome, of course. But some turn to one another.’”
Whatever the public may have heard in the years since, he has not left me. And I shall not leave him again. I had not imagined I could be known as he knows me, and then find that he wants all I am. It is his—my soul—so long as he has need of it.
We were given a week of peace. We started out from Geneva, and took in the great Rhone Valley on foot, headed toward the pass; stopping in a different village every evening, when the twilight chill fell early in the shadow of the mountains, while the clouds overhead still held last light. We walked barefoot in frigid glacial streams, stockings and shoes held in our hands, like schoolboys. We bought fresh bread and cheese and blueberry wine to eat in fragrant, greening fields of new grass and early wheat, under the broad blue heavens; every day higher amid the peaks, nearer the sky. We slept anywhere; in farmhouse beds with down pillows and old quilts, curled about each other's heat; in the back of a farmer’s cart, our hats over our eyes, the May sun bathing us. At night, he told me things in whispers that I could barely understand. I could not find words, but he did not seem to begrudge me the quiet in which I received him.
“No—” When he is trying to explain himself, to bring what is in his mind into the open, he gestures like an actor on the stage, displaying perfectly his hands’ full range of delicate expression. I sat back and stared. “Just now,” he went on, ignoring that, “my mind is all full of the case. I can’t understand what I am seeing, yet, but I can see patterns appearing and disappearing amid the chaos, little lights glimmering in the dark. I can usually go on examining them quietly, whatever I am doing externally; but taking you to bed is entirely different, and I don’t like to be distracted from you.—You are laughing again.”
He was waiting for me, when I returned, still standing by the fire. I could see he was nervous, too. I held up the book. “I thought I’d read a bit of the service proper, if I’m to be our priest,” I said. As I’d hoped, his expression dissolved into pure amusement.
I did think, once, in Montpelier—established at a little room-for-rent above a widow’s quarters, the rain against my window, the scent of the wet earth coming through the melting snow in her back garden, and the sound of a man passing on the street below, whistling in the dark—I thought of giving up, and telling him to come. I could show him everything: the ancient library, the modern, beautiful laboratories at the university, and the footpaths into the budding lavender fields round about the town—we could have walked through them together every warm day. I thought how it would be to stay there with him, away from everyone who knew us, and would notice us; away from England’s most sanctimonious, unnecessary, interfering laws. But of course I was called away at the end of the week, and left my daydreams behind me when I went.
At any rate, this time I was too preoccupied to put on a good show for him. I knew that, so I went straight for Lestrade, standing over the bar, and asked him to get us drinks. John would start talking while we waited, or Greg would draw him out. Greg squinted at me. “Really? You’re letting me choose what you have?”
"My dear man," he said. "It cannot have escaped your attention that the conditions in which I was promised a kiss have failed to materialise."
Two days of calm followed, of sunlight, and street fare, and music in the evenings. Two days of his smiles across the breakfast table, his unmistakable step at my side, his hand on my arm, his warm laughter beside the fire in the homely dark. Two days of looking, looking, looking at him, knowing that he knew; watching him blink and fidget and brighten when he caught me looking. Thinking of how he had sounded when he'd said he loved me.
France was a sufficient distraction for about a week. I could forget myself in wandering the crooked streets, ducking in and out of second-hand shops and third-rate music-halls, a cigarette in my hand and my cravat undone; I could disappear into my research for hours, and go to bed at any time of day or night, and rain curses, unreprimanded, on my uncooperative fireplace and my draughty window and my empty room. For John wasn’t there, and the release of utter self-indulgence was failing to counterbalance the weight of his absence.
Of course Holmes’ soul has never been near becoming a “dry, cold mechanisation,” but it’s how he feels it. He’s never been as duplicitous and inconstant as he feels either.
“We’ve been threatened,” I said, dismayed by the sharpness in my voice, but powerless to find another tone. “You—your presence here will be used against us.”
“His does, clearly.” His voice was high, soft, and strained, and strangely remote, as though he had gone somewhere inside himself, away from me. I hesitated at the threshold of his secrecy.
Please pass Mrs. Hudson and my brother my gratitude for feeding you, and taking up the duty of your care which I am egregiously neglecting.
His umbrella stood against the wall at the top of the stairs. There was a light shining under the door, on the landing. All was quiet within. I thought of knocking, but the impulse to surprise won out, and I pushed it open softly.
Because it was all going so well. We were comfortable. We liked each other, and we even managed to say it aloud. Now that we’d managed to get here–to the point where kisses and quiet nights side by side on the sofa doing our own work, occasionally reaching out just to be sure of each other, and flowers, and regular hugs, was all normal, a foregone conclusion-it seemed strange to ask for more.
“Oh, no.” She came around to arrange herself on the stool beside me, finger the stem of her blue iced something-in-a-glass and eye me. “I should say, it’s obvious to a woman.”
It wasn’t until the next morning that I went back to look at the letter properly. Within a few lines I was sobered. Milverton had written to the Professor about me. I had been following any mention of Professor Moriarty with interest for years, and had of late began to track him in earnest, in hopes of unraveling the secret of his uncanny influence over London. I had learned enough to know how difficult it would be to prove malicious intent against him, though what a difference it would make to the state of our city if I could! But now I saw our own names written out in the Professor’s hand, cultured, but cramped with ill-feeling; saw his smooth acknowledgment of Milverton’s request to end my interference, and an elegantly-worded promise to deal with me apace. I was foolishly pleased to see him refer to me as “notably difficult to touch on moral grounds,” but in the next moment my heart sank down to my toes, for the line went on, “but he may easily be reached, I think, through the weakness supplied by Doctor Watson.”
After an hour or so he grew quiet. I opened one eye to find him taking a peppermint drop from the bowl beside his chair, and opening up the notebook he’d left there, the paper set aside. He must have thought I was sleeping. I did not disabuse him of the notion, but watched him with one half-opened eye while he began to write. He is a study in earnest endeavour: he frowns, and bites on his lip, and puts out the tip of his tongue, and taps the pencil twice against a completed sentence which he finds especially satisfactory. If he knew I watched him, he would grow self-conscious; so I used to ration out the pleasure, and allow it to myself only when most needed. I hadn’t had the chance in a long while. The trouble, of course, was that in watching him I was given time to think, and it became harder and harder to contain myself, until, “Watson,” I burst out, and he started.
I went to my room to get out the little prayer book, and the token I had bought for him. With them in my hands found I had to sit down. I have loved a few times, and lost every one; traveled a wide world, with very little comfort in it. I have known my share of good times, along with trouble, but never a happiness like this. And now I was about to make vows to him. I would never do anything again, I thought, that meant so much.
We sat down on the great, black, slippery mohair Chesterfield which reposes squat and immovable before the fireplace, with an ancient silver tea-service beside it. The rest of the room is walled floor to shadowy ceiling with bookshelves, adorned only by portrait of a stern-faced Holmes patriarch of the previous century hanging portentous behind the desk. The style of the place is solemn, the carpet dark and thick; the overall effect as imposing on first look, and as comforting on better acquaintance, as the man who rules over the room and from it the Empire.
So he could tell I was nervous, that night, but he thought it was about the party. Really I’d been trying to work up my nerve to talk to him for days, and I’d set the NSY party as a sort of deadline for myself, so he wasn’t wrong. I wanted to get it done before Christmas, so I’d have an answer for the questions at the family party. I knew Mummy, she’d definitely ask, and in front of him, but trying to be subtle–“Have any plans?” But he didn’t know I was thinking about all that. He’s gotten the idea that I have anxiety about public events. Well, he gets protective, so I didn’t say anything. I let him smooth my shirt over my shoulders, and tell me I looked wonderful–I do enjoy that, silly as it is, being tidied and praised. I let him tell me everyone would be so pleased we came, a blatant lie. A few people (Greg, Molly) would be glad to see us, but most of them indifferent. He was pleased, though, which was the main thing. He held my hand in the cab. I tried not to fidget. The box in my inside jacket pocket felt bulky and obvious, even though it clearly wasn’t; he hadn’t glanced at it once in the days I’d been carrying it around. (I would have noticed it within sixty seconds.)
“I’ll get your coat,” I said. I felt vaguely that I ought to steady him, but I couldn’t manage it; I was reeling. I’d done it. I had him. I had asked him to marry me, and he’d told me he would, and he'd cried. He'd kissed me in the street. I left him there; went back through the noisy heat of the main room, up to the bar, where Molly and Greg were standing, Molly tucked under his arm.
He loved me, I knew that, as a man loves a brother-in-arms, or a knight his shield-bearer. He would likely argue that I am the knight, and he my shield-bearer, but I differ. Still he wasn’t wholly mine any longer, but Mary’s, and steadfast at her side six days out of seven. I couldn’t trust myself to see him for a while after he left me. Whatever he might have needed from me then, it wasn’t the only self I could find in those weeks, the furious and lonely self bared and howling for what I had lost, for a quick smile every bright morning across the breakfast table; for his step at my side, unmistakable as a signature, one stride caught up just slightly short in memory of Afghanistan and a burning bullet; for a gentle hand tucked into my elbow, or touching my shoulder as he passed; for the low, warm laugh I could provoke when we were sleepy and talking nonsense by the fire—just for his company.
When at last he put up his instrument, and turned again to me, I expected only a swift, “Good-night.” We spent some part of most nights together, but sleep was a point in which we rarely coincided, talk and other intimacies taking up what sanctuary we found in the safety of his room, or mine. I thought to-night he might want to be alone. But his eyes as he took up a candle, and turned to me, were wide and dark and asking for me, wordlessly, and wordless I followed him.
Not everyone can smell cyanide, but I’ve decided Holmes is among the portion of the population genetically capable of it.
Anyway, he was going for the kettle when he saw them, and he stopped dead. His hand twitched, and then he turned around to look at me. He looked almost angry: wide-eyed and silent. I said, “What?” I might have sounded defensive.
"I cannot let him loose on Europe, to begin again! Heaven help whatever nation he chose for refuge. John—Watson. You would not wish him on anyone. If I could end his career I would consider mine complete. I could retire in the country, to my chemicals and my philosophy."
I could not find a thought with which to object. I ate all of my beef, and drank two cups of tea, without really noticing the taste. Then I was shepherded to my room by Will. There was a beautiful fire made up in the grate. The counterpane was large and soft. I had enough presence of mind to wait until Will had gone to remove my outer clothes and crawl like a child into bed.
“You could let it be, give it time. Or you could write to him. Or you could go and see him.” I stepped to meet him; touched his jaw, which worked under my hand; brushed my fingers over his soft, damp cheeks, to catch the tears. When he still didn’t speak, I asked, “What time is the wedding? Seven o’clock?”
We’d promised each other a week, each to find a suitable token for the other. Something with which to promise each other our intent. I made a quiet trip to the bookseller on the Square; I needed a copy of the prayer book, for we’d agreed that we would have no priest. Neither of us wanted to ask in a stranger in, even if we could find a sympathetic one.
I could return to the hotel, to John; and we could start home—unknowing who our enemy was; what he looked like; what resources he had at his command. It would all begin again, the ceaseless attacks, the certainty that the risk of death would follow us until I had found them all; but this time John would not let me out of his sight, and so he would be their target, too. It could take months to find our new enemy. I might not find him before he found his opportunity.
With a hot baguette from the bakery next door tucked under my arm, I set out on foot for the harbour. Nearly there, on some strange impulse, I pulled a rosebud through the fence of a little fishing house on the borders of the dockyard, and tucked the soft bit of colour into my buttonhole. There was a tramper leaving port in four hours, with room for a paying passenger. Baguette and bag in my lap, I sat on a bench by the quay, watching the ships pull in against the waning tide, the gulls wheeling above us in the darkening sky, crying into the cold, clear wind, and came fully into the realisation that I would be in London by the morning.
After a moment he began again, “So then—” just as I said, “I’ve been packing my bag. I was leaving.”
“Sherlock.” Mycroft sounded bemused. “The Doctor’s writing has made you both famous. You must realize that.”
On my arrival, I did follow John into his office in disguise, as he wrote later; and he did collapse into his chair in shock when I revealed myself, though I should hardly call it a swoon. We both clung to each other, and I will be forgiven, I think, for not recording what we said; but I shall never forget the look on his face.
“There was no love between them,” he said. “I know, because the stranger with my brother looked me over, head to foot. That look--I didn’t have the language, then, to name what he wanted to do, but I could see it. He would not have asked; he would have taken what he liked. And my brother would not have noticed.”
“Well,” he said, “It’s a pity, but I have done what I could. I know every move of your game. You can do nothing before Monday. This is a duel between us, Mr. Holmes. You hope to place me in the dock. I tell you that I will never stand there. You plan to beat me. I shall not be beaten. If I were to be ruined, I should bring ruin on you at once.”
We walked about the city for the better part of two silent hours. The loneliness on his face grew no less, but he kept my hand tucked close into his elbow, and felt for it, and patted it, now and then. I thought it steadied him. He asked if we might lunch in a tavern; and when we finally arrived in our own rooms he set aside his coat and went directly to occupy himself at his tabletop laboratory. I am no student of chemistry, but I am an observer of Sherlock Holmes. It was quite clear that while he was not angry with me, he might be, if I insisted on breaking in on his thoughts before he had sifted through them and found what he needed; so I remained nearby, attending to the Journal and my accounts, and preparing several submissions for the Strand. Sometimes he needed me only to stay, a presence beyond the borders of the wild country within him, so that he would not get lost there.
“But—your coat. You were going to buy a new one. Yours is really past salvation. And your books—you wanted books.” He’d been delighted over that money, the first cheque from something more than his ridiculous pension. He’d been glittering with pride, overflowing with plans for it, as pleased as if it had been ten times the sum it was.
“Good,” he said, smiling. “I assume that was Mrs. Hudson’s doing. Have you taken steps to secure her safety?”

I had heard enough of him to know any appeal to his supposed sympathy would gain nothing. I said, “Danger is part of my trade.”
"Together," I agreed, no longer caring what he could hear in my tone. "Come away with me to the Continent—please. Only for a few days, till all is over. Mycroft will see to the trial, but we cannot stay here. I am sure we are being watched; I will have to leave you over the back wall, shortly, to escape detection."
“Let me see,” I said. He laughed, and held it up just before my eyes, turning it again. Within, where it would remain a secret known only to the wearer, was engraved a message in pictographic code. Two white enamel hands sheltered a heart between them. After them was carved the word
A slow breath, beside me; the hand over mine tightened. “I am sorry,” he said, and then he turned into my shoulder at last, and hid his face in my neck. I drew him in; held him against me, and stroked his back, and kissed his temple, the pulse in his sweet neck, the curve of his slender shoulder. Angry as I was, I knew he loved me. I knew that he was afraid, and that there were things at work that I did not understand.
"He's desperate. His work is in shambles, his name ruined, his men in custody, his livelihood forfeit. He cannot go home to England. If you go back, you will be safe from him." I was having trouble keeping my voice down.
"No, I know. Not—everything, not until he is in irons and we are safe from his knowledge. But—only take me walking, Holmes, and let's see the city. Tell me about the people we pass. Bring me home, and talk to me, and let me read to you, and be with you." He spoke lightly, but his expression was hungry. "Just let me be with you."
"You evidently don't know me,” he said. The words were threatening, but his tone was calm, almost interested, as though I were a novelty for his observation. I should have liked to stand, and look him in the eye, but I kept my seat on principle. I would not rise to his invasion.
We lay like that a long while, wrapped in shadows. I had begun to drift toward sleep amid the heat of him, when I heard him whisper, “I wish I could.”
After a half-hour’s lively debate over composers past and present, and the merits of various instruments (for which I stayed silent, but happily), Cox quite unexpectedly fetched a beautiful little Spanish guitar from another room, and played for us a while. Sherrinford watched with a softness which better recommended them both to me, since I have often watched Holmes at his violin with just the same feeling. After, I remembered Mycroft had mentioned they kept dogs, and asked to see the kennels; and that removed any remaining stiffness between us. Sherlock raced and tussled the dogs about, and tested their training, and asked after all the details of their puppyhood, and Sherrinford answered him with a light in his eye which was very good to see. Sherlock ended up coming away in a pair of Sherrinford’s trousers, having muddied his irreparably in the kennel-yard. As we boarded the train-carriage toward London in the gloaming, he was smiling to himself. I believe we will visit them again.
Queer clubs, holding queer weddings, with the blessing of  priests, reads like a fic-writer's wishful invention. But it is actually a matter of historical record. From a tumblr post by @weeesi: "Both London and the Culture of Homosexuality AND Strangers: Homosexual Love in the Nineteenth Century talked about this. To quote from Strangers: '…marriages continued to be a common expression of love and sociality. A surprising number of priests and vicars were prepared to perform marriages for homosexual men or lesbians, and there were also many private arrangements. […] There is evidence from late 19th-century America, Britain, France and Germany of hotels rented for weddings, male brides in gorgeous gowns, exotic honeymoons (sometimes ruined by blackmailers) and bridal bouquets kept under glass in front parlours. These events were the feast days of small communities.'"
“Sherlock,” I said, lower, and stepped up behind him; rested a cautious hand on his shoulder, through the shabby old velvet of his worn smoking-jacket; slid it slowly, meaningfully, down his arm. The corner of his mouth turned up. I ran my hand down his arm again; clasped his wrist and turned it; fit my hand into his. He sighed, and pressed it, and turned to me at last.
“He’s a great boy of twelve,” said he, “and you’re a mother hen.” He peeked out above the map at last, twinkling; winked at me, and laid it aside, and took up the letter from his lap, and plucked a butter knife from the tea-tray to serve him for a letter opener. “Let’s see what mysterious mess of iniquity we’ve been sent now. I hope it’s worthwhile.” In another moment, however, he had examined the handwriting and the return address, and his expressive face went quite blank.
“Of course I told him to go on. ‘I’ve seen a good deal of life,’ I said. ‘I am not easily shocked.’ He said, ‘You’ve told me you haven’t enjoyed close contact with your wife, but you are very fond of her. Were there any friends at school, or in your regiment, who were as significant to you? As Damon to Pythias, or Achilles to Patroclus?’”
I put away my things, and donned the dressing-gown; sat down with a sigh, stroking a hand over the worn, familiar pillow. I had to think what was next to be done. Arrests could not be made until Monday; the precise location of each member of the Professor’s inner circle had to be tracked until then, without alarming them, intelligence finalised as to their probable escape routes, fail-safes, and suicide risk; the security of the agents involved in their collection assured. I ought to see Mycroft soon.
I started down the path into the gathering twilight, pulling the straps of my pack tight across my chest. I had planned to meet John by the Falls. We’d have walked to the next village over, and at our lodgings I’d have asked him to read to me a while beside the fire. When I'd gotten up the courage, I’d have laid my head in his lap, to tempt him into playing with my hair; and at last, sufficiently distracted, he’d have set the book aside and bent to kiss me.
Any lover can imagine what followed. Till then I had been neither lover nor beloved, and was quite unprepared; but I had faith enough in John Watson. Whenever I have need of him, he proves himself; and I think I offered enough in return to put all thought of luck and the loss of it out of his mind.
A sound escaped me at that. He glanced up at me, surprised. He must have thought me uncharacteristically pained to the heart on Mrs. Watson’s behalf. His brow contracted; he leaned forward, and under that look it began to be difficult to breathe. I held his gaze with all my strength: it seemed the worst possible time for my practiced serenity to fail, but it was faltering badly. Thank God, he did not understand. “I’ve said too much,” he said, after a moment’s earnest scrutiny of me, and sat back, releasing me from the effect of his bright, worried eyes. “Forgive me, this is precisely the irrational kind of tragedy you might have expected for me when I indulged in the absurdity of marriage. You did warn me.”
“Are you coming?” was all he said. It took me some few moments to recall--we had agreed to visit Mycroft. He needed his brother.
“Thank you,” was all he said, graciously, “and good evening. It’s home for me, now. It’ll all look better in the morning,” as he put on his hat in the doorway.
“I do not speak of danger,” said he. “I speak of inevitable destruction. You are standing not in my way, but in the way of an organisation whose extent you cannot have realised. You must stand clear of our progress, Mr. Holmes, or be trodden under foot.”
Even at Milverton’s unexpected entrance, while barely hiding ourselves in time, I felt no real misgiving; only some horror and a greater sense of sympathy as the woman he meant to destroy followed after, and brought him his end. John wrote that I held him back until the man was dead, and the woman gone, and then leaped out to rifle the cursed safe he kept full of his trade-secrets, and cast the letters there into the fire, before we ran out with all the house and a few policemen on our heels and took ourselves safely home.
For some moments he regarded me in silence. I couldn’t read his face at all, which was more frightening to me than everything else so far; but then he blinked, and determination writ itself across his forehead. “All right,” he said. “I’ll hold you to that in a minute. Holmes—I’m having difficulty—that is to say, Mary and I—” He stopped, and sighed, and rubbed his chin, clearly discomfited; his eyes dropped again. “I’ve not been able to fulfill my duties to her.”
“It’s already forgotten,” I answered, but it did me good to hear him say so. I still kept his hand in mine, and nestled it in my lap; the blessed privacy of carriage-travel allowed us some few minutes to be ordinary together, before the world burst in on us again. “May I ask you one question?”
We're given very little idea of what Holmes was doing in France, and I leave it as vague as canon does, but added a few attempts on his life to account partially for the exhaustion Doyle describes in him (I can't imagine Moriarty left him alone the whole time there)--the rest of his weariness being due to his absence from John, of course, and the attendant impulse to work himself into the ground. I wish I had the plot room to write about what Holmes would do with the money from the case--I imagine a lot of indulging John in nights out, and books, and better food, and a lot of music, to begin with; and then laying plans for Sussex, eventually.
But his eyes on me were somber, his lips pressed tight together. I was about to forgo undressing and go to kissing him at once, in hopes of teasing a little relief into that forlornity—but, “Wait, John,” said in a rush, “wait a little. Could we—Would you feel—John, would you—”
“Billy,” I said, and held out a handful of coins. We’d had several profitable cases the week before, and the day was dark and drear enough to fray the nerves of any active, healthy boy cooped up indoors. “Run to the corner store for some candy. Get what you like. Bring back toffees for Mrs. Hudson and ribbon candy for Anna.” Anna, bright, curly-headed, fourteen years old, helped in the kitchen three days a week. Billy was entirely smitten: stricken red-faced and silent when she was in the room. He flushed straight up, on cue.
I couldn’t answer him. I rose to my feet, under the pressure of mounting emotion, and found I could not stand steadily. He rose with me, watching me—reached out, and grasped my shoulders, anchoring me.
A sound escaped me. I had not expected that, from him. He smiled a little, watching me, and turned it in his lovely fingers for me to look at. It was gold, gleaming but plain, till I glimpsed inside the band what appeared to be a miniature skull inlaid.
“Yes!” Now he was starting to laugh too. “Yes, I want it, and yes, you ought to ask me, you idiot! Oh, my God.” He stared at me. He was waiting. I had to find words.
Had I felt less, loved him less, I might have been able to speak, to praise him as he should have been praised, and try to please him. All I could do was cling to him. At first he handled me softly, but then, as I met his kisses with my own, he began to hold hard to me, too; and all at once as I kissed his cheek I tasted tears there. I pulled back in surprise, and, "Sorry," he murmured, "I'm sorry," but I shook my head.
“There is almost material enough to convince a British jury evident in the actual facts,” said the cool lines, “but I am prepared to furnish you with several men of good, ordinary, honest-seeming quality, who will testify to the intimacies required to infer the act itself between Watson and Holmes.”
Sherlock has promised to take me to the old Holmes estate, some day, though it was sold to friends of friends after their father’s death--”No need for a house of that size,” he said, dryly, “nor lands, since any future young Holmeses are now quite out of the question. But we could take a tour of it. I’m glad to have grown up with the glades and meadows about us, and the wild things, and the great library, and the land rolling down toward the river; but I much prefer London, and our own home.”
“John,” he answered; halted, searching my expression. Speechlessness had proven a good omen between us before.
"Be careful tonight." And then, "All this time—I've had no idea where you were, how you were. It feels strange—to think of having you to myself again."
“Everything’s fine,” she said, and came right up to me and gave me a hard hug, with her chin on my shoulder. I could feel her laugh silently. “Everything’s wonderful,” she added, letting go, and patted my shoulder. Greg was gaping at us, but she didn’t look at him, only tucked herself back in at his side, and said, “Give him our best, Sherlock, and take him home.”
“Then let us exchange the tokens of our good faith,” I said, when I had got my voice back, and I produced out of my pocket the little gold sovereign I’d had made into a fob. “Give me your watch?”
“I had thought it might help you through it,” I said, making an attempt at equal bluntness. “To be touched.” I sat down on the bed, and looked back. I had been in awe of him, long ago; had regarded him as something a little above the bewildered lot of us humanity, something cold and clear and certain. He was not. He was quite human. I should have known it sooner.
I am not alone. I met up with Stamford only last week; wrote him, and said I owed him a drink. He introduced us, after all. I suppose I feel a sort of intimacy with you in his company by proxy. I meet the ghost of you about the city everywhere, anyway, there are so many places we have been together. It used to be a torment to me, when I left you for Mary; but now it is a help.
When I looked up, great tears stood in his eyes. I was caught in his gaze, bright in the firelight, till the tears overflowed and spilled down his face. I said, hoarse, “Sherlock.” He wiped quickly at his eyes; took the watch from me, and touched the coin with one finger; put it away in his waistcoat pocket, reverent. Then he reached into his other pocket, and brought out a ring.
He drew a breath at that, and followed it with, “My dear John,” in quite a new tone. He had brightened at last; in fact he was fairly shining at me. All at once he crossed to the bed, lifted my face in his hands, and kissed my forehead soundly; released me, and said, “I do love you.” Then he left me there.
I said, “I do love you. I love you,” and then, “Heaven help me,” and I seized the strong hand that held my arm and brought it almost to my lips. I could do it; he would not stop me. I let him go. “Leave, then. I can’t bear this either.” And then I lost my breath again at his expression.
I turned up the lamps, and picked through the pile of rejected requests atop my workbench, recovering several letters from the Lieutenant Général in Paris. He had offered me work across the Channel, well-paying work, with official protection. To accept his request would purchase me a little time, and space enough to let me breathe, away from our silent rooms, once John had gone. I might gather the funds necessary for any larger operation around the Professor, while giving my connexions time to work up the information I required.
The Professor did not, as in John’s dramatic recounting, approach me with a challenge when he found me, nor did he leave me time to write a suitably dignified note for John (I wish he had), to find and memorialise as my final speech for the Strand's grieving readers. In fact, I was standing over the precipice, looking through the mist to the shining ranges beyond, when several shots rang out hard at hand. I turned to find Moriarty coming at me, pistol raised. I suppose it was his enormous anger that made him fire before he was quite sure of his aim, or he could have had me; but I believe he was half out of his mind with fury and thwarted pride. I sighted him, and returned fire.
Sometime after midnight I was woken from a dreamless sleep by Mendelssohn’s Lieder being played below, slowly and tenderly; as he had always played it for me, from the start.
“I must have looked lost. I didn’t understand, even then. He added, carefully, ‘I mean they look to each other for love.’ I said, ‘As spouses do—they love each other?’ and he nodded. ‘Body and soul’—those were his words. ‘And while the practice is unusual, it seems to settle them, much as marriage does another kind of man. Some waste their time and their energies on hired boys, as a rake would on women. Some despise their own nature, and are unable to accept any kind of comfort in it; but given your intelligence and your self-respect, I think you will do better than that—if this idea strikes you in any significant way.’ And he smiled at me. I think he hoped to reassure me. I was stunned. I am still stunned, but—I have considered it, and I think—I believe he is right.”
With the distinct feeling that we were getting nowhere, and with a rising need to get out from under his empty stare at once, I stood. “I am afraid that in the pleasure of this conversation I am neglecting business of importance which awaits me elsewhere.”
“I think they’ll be all right,” he said. “My brother looked--I hadn’t seen him like that. He’s changed. I might go to see them. They asked me up to the house.”
“I’ll plan a pudding for supper,” was all her answer, but she patted my arm before she turned back to the kitchen, and I felt obscurely comforted.
If he had been only a hired man, a bodyguard, a rough, he ought to have left as soon as the Professor fell. His work was done, his employer’s life over. But if he was one of them—if he was waiting for me—
“No.” He gave me a small smile, a silent thanks for the proffered escape. “It’s all right. My mother died of lock-jaw when I was ten years old. They brought me home from school, but they didn’t allow me to see her until she was in the casket. My father broke his neck in a riding accident fifteen years later. He was with a hunting party; they had been drinking, and the sun had nearly set, and he tried a jump his horse couldn’t manage in the dusk without firm guidance.”
“How can I not? She’s lent me her strength throughout my confusion. I’m quite sure I owe her the truth as I know it. If I frighten her too much, she can tell me so; but you must understand this is a problem that belongs to us both. I asked her to share my life.” He still spoke bravely, but his eyes were growing desolate. To a man of his loyalty—
“Maxwell, your friend,” I said, finally. “Did he offer you any studies on the subject? Any evidence for his views?”
He shook his head. “No, he didn’t. I took two shillings out of my purse; gave them to my brother for a cab-fare and a cot, and shut the door on him. I didn’t sleep till sunrise; but I didn’t repent it. To this day I don’t know if Sherrinford remembers. I don’t know whether he found a hansom to take him home, or whether they went to some hovel; or whether his companion robbed him and left him in the street.”
“Not like this,” I said. “Not having friendly, civilised dinners with him and his lover, talking over their future.”
I do miss Mary. We've exchanged notes, but I've yet to make another visit to the house. But I don't miss her in the way I think you mean. She's been a true friend to me. I hope she’s happy now. I couldn't give her that. I have sometimes believed I could make you happy, as you do me. Those weeks in Switzerland were the most wonderful of my life. Forgive me the sentimentality, but you are very far away, and sentiment is a comfort.
I paid a distant cousin to purchase his practice, so I could bring him home at once. I had money enough, and no reason to use it but for him. To see him at Baker Street once more was all I needed.
You ought to see her, to learn how she is, if it would ease your heart. Let her know you wished to see her well. She cared for you, too, and I owe her a debt of gratitude for that.
You might speak to my brother. He holds the information I had gathered on the organisation as it stood, including the members we deemed unimportant, wherein you could search out those hangers-on and minor associates remaining at large in London. Our man must be somewhere among them. I would prefer you stay well out of it, but if you feel it is necessary to your peace of mind, my brother can bring you into the case.
On the very rare occasions when he deems it necessary we socialize, I do the talking. I would think he’d like to, since he’s the one who insists on going; but he doesn’t. He likes to nurse a whisky, and hang about, and watch me talk. So I do; I find the nearest marginally intelligent looking person, pretend I’m on an investigation, and draw them out. And John is pleased, because I’m being friendly. I’m making him feel part of the group, by extension.
"I had a run-in with a rough on the way here," I said. "And that was the third attempt on my life to-day. We can't stay here."
“I didn’t know,” I admitted, because I hadn’t. It would make John happy, that I’d listened, and learned something. The knowledge could be useful on a case–the psychological impact of rom-coms. But now I couldn’t manage to be social any longer, not with John sitting there laughing, and the box in my pocket.
When dawn broke over the rooftops he was dozing in my chair, wrapped up in my shawl. I laid myself down on the sofa, thinking to watch over him till he woke, but the ticking of the clock amid the quiet in the room pulled me under with him into blessed unconsciousness.
“Dearly beloved,” I read, “we are gathered here in the sight of God and in the face of this congregation”--Here Sherlock raised his brows, and I gestured between the two of us; if I could serve as our priest, we could be our own congregation, surely. He nodded, conceding the point, so I went on--“gathered to join together these men in holy matrimony. If either of you know any impediment, why ye may not be lawfully joined together, do now confess it.” It ought to have been funny, given the multiplicity of reasons we might not, lawfully. I expected a sparkle of derision from him at the line, but his gaze remained wholly solemn and true.
My disappointment must have been evident, because he pulled me back into him, suddenly, putting his nose in my hair, and said, “No, John, of course not. Not if you’d like to come along. I didn’t know if you would--perhaps you’ve had enough mad Holmeses.”
“Good Lord,” said Mycroft, mildly, when I limped into his study covered in brick dust and mud. He was seated at his desk, the curtains behind him half-drawn. The hush in the room, even at midday, was absolute. It always felt in those rooms as though the rest of the world had ceased to be, not extant, exactly, but imminent in any meaningful way: it was sanctuary.
The firelight shone a radiance round about him as he stood there, with such an expression in his eyes. He went on, softly, "But we are left to settle what is between us, anyway. The fact remains that he can't harm us any more, not lawfully, not in England; not a man in the court would believe his word against ours, now, thanks to you."
It was not really a question; an order, more. I bowed to it. “As soon as I’m rid of our company on the street. And I must see my brother.”
I caught up my cane as he bent and scribbled out a missive upon his desk, and did up my collar as he sealed it. We went down together. At the foot of the stairs, he rung for Billy and ordered him to have the note over to the Diogenes at once. I minded my business, an occupation I am well practiced in. When he wanted me to know, I’d know.
I nodded. I could not have spoken; but John was caught up visibly in a powerful emotion, and hurried on. “He asked, then, ‘Have you ever embraced a friend?’”
He kept up a stream of information to me in our own simple code, Greek letters forming Latin words—again, no real protection, but a point against a quick perusal. The messages were hand-carried week by week across the Channel by his lackeys. He kept me abreast of the movements of the Professor and his men, the communications intercepted, the threads I might pull to unravel, bit by bit, the web wrapped carefully round the whole of London. It was a delicate task; one great tug might break the thread I held. I had to proceed with horrible gentleness.
“Ha!” He turned to me fully at last, with a spark of something in his gaze--not humour; perhaps irony. “The latter explanation contains the former, my dear boy. His bride is called Alfred, and the club represents all the family they own.”
I had done worse than warn him; I’d mocked him. I’d goaded and scorned him, out of my anger. I was well and truly repaid now. “I was wrong to do that. I do not think it absurd. You may tell me whatever you choose.” I sounded an automaton.
And you are much better at tending to me than you know. In fact no one has ever taken such care over me as you have. I have only ever found you generous of soul.
Several possible lines of inquiry opened there. But I had to ask first, “Why are you glad of that? And what bride consents to be wed in a gentlemen’s club?”
He had flagged down a cab; it was waiting for us at the kerb. I helped him into his coat, and opened the door for him; went around to the other side in a daze,  and slid in, as near him as I dared. He tucked his hand into my elbow; squeezed it gently. His other hand lay in his lap. The ring shone amid the shadows, in the streetlights’ glow. We looked at it all the way home.
I arrived just as the trees around the university grounds were coming into bloom. It would have been an ideal retreat to come to, had John been with me; but I had not even had a telegram from him the whole of my time in Turin, nor Florence, though Mycroft had told him where I was. The silence between us was worse than the miles. I had not found the courage to wire him again; but on the fourth night from my arrival I sat down at last to write him a letter.
“Oh?” I sat up, and found I didn’t know what to do with my hands. I folded them, and did my best to offer him a courteous expression of interest.
“Maybe he felt himself bound to wait. Maybe he feared Sherrinford would fall to drink again.” His voice was growing thick. He turned: looked at me with dark, wet eyes. My heart jolted at the sight--he never weeps. “Or maybe he thought I would ask, if I wanted to know. I had said I would not hear of him.”
All at once the door was opened by a sturdy, keen-eyed woman, about thirty, with paint-spattered hands. A streak of blue paint adorned her hair—she had put her hand up to tidy it out of habit when I had rung the bell.
As a man of quite another bent, to whom acting is as instinctive to my nature and as necessary to my profession as the pulse of my blood, I sometimes wonder why he trusts me. He has seen me enact a thousand characters in as many days, and in each shift of voice and breath and tone and angled wrist and changing tread I believe the chimera created appears as natural as the one before. If I were him I should not feel I knew me. I will say this: I am honest. Not with his sincerity, changeless and innate, but with the truest truth of whichever man I am creating; I never say a thing which that man would not. Sometimes I wonder if there is a way to learn what he saw in me: if there was any idea of me he held to, or if he loved me for all my selves.
“You have me,” I repeated. I could not resist drawing near to him, holding my hands out to him, pleading as I rarely would. “As far as it depends on me. I should like to keep you with me. Will you allow me?”
“God in Heaven!” was the muffled exclamation from the kitchen, and my heart bounded up in near-painful relief as she appeared at its door, wiping her hands on her apron. “What is it?”
Then, of course, I found I needed you; in fact I could not do without you. I am only half myself when you are not here.
That was the crux of it. “Because you’ve left Mary to return here. Because you write about me so kindly. They mean to accuse us of indecency.”
Not again. I leaned forward. “And not without me. It is both, or none, if you can manage to remember that.”
I read Mycroft as asexual, and much more content alone than Holmes could ever have been. I think that as long as Sherlock and Sherrinford are alive and well and nearby, he is happy.
“You are careless of yourself,” was all he said, though, and promptly buried his feelings in the roast. I was careless, with the incautious joy of a young man who had always had his strength, so I had no real rejoinder; but I wondered very much what troubled him about me.
The words were shockingly harsh, but his expression was lost and wild; and I saw one thing clearly: he had not understood me at all.
I was in sight of No. 221 when I became fully conscious that I was being pursued, as when a sound outside a dream suddenly startles one into the waking world. I had noticed, without knowing I noticed, a man coming through the crowds on the other sidewalk some way back, small, sturdy, his hat pulled down over his forehead. His clothes were all dark. He walked quickly, with a definite aim. I noticed all this properly for the first time as I realised that he was crossing the street, his gaze fixed on me. I began to think where I could throw my violin case and my carpetbag, if I had to run for it, so as not to harm the Strad. But now the door was approaching; and I reached it, and pulled hard on the bell, just as my pursuer gained the sidewalk on my side some ten yards behind.
John has a marvelous voice, warm and clear and dry. He reads charmingly, with little asides on the interesting bits, and small bouts of laughter when he strikes on something unexpected. I tucked myself into my arm chair, with my head on a velveteen cushion, and closed my eyes, the better to savour the experience. The heat of the fire seeped into my skin, the wind whistled in the chimney-grate, and his voice went on steadily, while the world fell to rights around us.
When I returned he was standing over the breakfast table with a fork in his hand, chewing without enthusiasm. He dropped the fork and stepped back with visible relief, threw back a cupful of lukewarm tea as though it were cheap brandy, and caught up his cloak and my cane as we passed into the entryway. Outside, he fidgeted about on the pavement while I hailed us a hansom, pulling at his collar, taking out his pocket-watch, and putting it back in his waistcoat without looking at it.
I've rewritten how Holmes and Watson meet in London. Clearly Watson couldn't write it as it happened, but he gives us permission to rewrite him pretty directly by admitting how often he has to change details to obscure sensitive facts. I followed their canon path through Europe, but again, changed the details of the confrontation at the Fall.
The next day a great goose arrived fresh from the butcher’s; and a bottle of very fine aged port followed from Mycroft’s address. I don’t know when Sherlock told him; but the proof of his approval was surprisingly good to see.
So I overlooked the signs that perhaps he was not quite so settled as I. He seemed shy sometimes at my invitations, but I persisted; I’d spent years in London in my own solitary company, and I had a hundred things to show him. I brought him to the best booksellers, and the music halls, and the coffeehouses; the boxing rings where I beat off ennui and kept my fighting hand in; the dockyards where the spices came in from India and Siam—where the sailors in the taverns welcomed him, with his limp and his soldier’s posture, and asked where he’d been, and nodded their respect: offered in return wild stories of their adventures, to which he listened hungrily. He began to sleep better; he laughed at whatever nonsense I could find to entertain him, and smiled at my showing off, and seemed less weary. I wanted company, and he needed it; I thought we were in sympathy.
