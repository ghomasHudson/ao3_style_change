Bruises from the explosion were scattered across his body. Dean could see the stitches covering cCas’s chest in an attempt to repair the stab wound and black peeking from the edge of the sleeve. Cas looked pale and small in the empty room with only the sound of his own heartbeat to keep him company. Everything felt very wrong.
The action picked up in the middle of the day. Jody, Donna, Claire, Alex, and Kaia returned with more purchases so the refugees could be fully clothed and they picked up as many cheap cellphones and computers they could find. Led by Charlie and Sam, about fifteen other tech-savvy nerds rounded up every available laptop and computer including Dean’s and were mass creating fake identities, bank accounts, and funneling money at blinding speeds. Charlie grinned wickedly has she broke into the offshore bank account for a CEO recently disgraced for sexual assault allegations. She had the thing drained in less than ten minutes. Dean couldn’t fault that one or the many other soon-to-be-goners they had targeted.
Dean glanced down and was thankful to see that the flannel tourniquet had mostly done it’s job in lessening the bleeding though some of the checkers of the pattern had become tinged with blood. The bleeding from his side wound soaked his shirt even more which was worrisome. Cas’s foot was barely touching the ground and anytime he tried to weight on it he winced.
“I can see how that is a grievance worthy of a ball flying 95 miles per hour and hitting someone in the head. Too bad it was you though.”
Thunder and lightning clapped overhead. As they crested the hill, Dean glanced back and saw Billie break through the door at the bottom of the hill. No demons were behind her but they wouldn’t be far behind if they were chasing the grace like the last group.
Dean’s heart broke a little more inside. His heart had shattered when Cas confessed his feelings before being taken by the Empty. The shattered pieces crumbled further when he realized the feelings he had been harboring for years towards his best friend were romantic. He loved Cas back. What little pieces that remained had been ground into dust when he thought he wouldn’t get the chance to say it back and he was too late.
Dean thought about offering to go but bit his tongue. A five-hour trek through the woods followed by days of moving an entire camp? In theory, Dean could probably make the trip but not without a lot of pain and slowing people down. No way his family would let him go even if Dean thought he could do it. They didn’t need to babysit another injured rebel as they abandoned camp.
The room was still for a few moments before Jack began to babble a bit. The tension immediately eased and Dean spent another few minutes holding Jack before handing him back to Cas. Slowly, Dean made his way to the hallway and Cas followed.
Cas and Dean grew more comfortable together as time went on and Cas grew adept to reading Dean’s body. Sometimes Dean swears Cas knew Dean’s limits better than he did. Cas would even stay long after the massage was done either chatting with Dean or just silently enjoying his company for as long as Dean could stay awake. Dean lost track of the number of times he fell asleep with Cas gently massaging his leg like Makenzie had suggested for his taxed muscles. Mackenzie and science were right, he felt much better afterwards.
“Jurassic Park, Cas. We watched the original last month when Jack stopped by for burgers. You spent the entire move talking about dinosaurs actually having feathers.”
“Yes, I’ve been doing lots of research and spring is the best time to start a beehive virtually from scratch. We would be starting a little late but we should be able to get one up and running. They need the summer months so the colony has adequate time build up, brood, and prepare for the winter. There are a few more benefits like having pollinators right there for the garden too.”
In the early hours of the morning, Dean’s eyelids began droop and his body protested the late-night hours he was no longer used to keeping. He drove down the open highway until the neon sign of a roadside motel caught his attention. The light flickered the familiar dull orange as Dean pulled into the motel parking lot.
“Rowena, it’s not that simple. I have to think about Sam and what he’s doing here. You don’t even like me so I don’t know why you would cash your favor in on this.”
“Dean, there are demons in town,” Jody said unprompted as she set down her last bag with a loud thump against the table.
Cas took a step towards Dean with one hand outstretched, “Dean, this is your home. We aren’t anywhere where people can see us. Nobody will know about your physical therapy happening in the living room unless we tell them and I would never without your permission. I want you to be comfortable enough to do anything you want in
In the first hour that had passed, Cas had changed Jack’s diaper, fed him, burped him, and rocked him to sleep. Dean had about one million things he could be doing. He could have been reading lore. He should have been moving Charlie. He probably should have started cleaning up the glass that blew and scared Jack into opening the rift. He did none of those things.
“Glory and happiness isn’t what I would call it. More like jail while you guys take the easy way out,” Mary said.
The injured and brittle wing shaft ran along the entire burn. Attached to the shaft were four feathers spaced throughout. All four feathers were all damaged but still magnificent. Two feathers were together on his shoulder blade. They looked fluffed up but in decent shape the last time he had seen them. They touched ever so slightly near where the feather attached and brushed gently together. They leaned against each other for support. Dean had seen those two feathers the least.
Gone was the irritated man and in his place was a father who looked fondly down at the toddler. Sam watched as Dean shifted Jack slowly to not risk waking him up. Dean carried Jack out of the room slightly favoring his braced left leg. The occasional creak of the stairs and floorboards allowed Sam to follow Dean’s journey. Cas followed Dean up the stairs a moment later with the promise to return quickly after they tucked Jack in for the night.
Dean ordered pizza for a late lunch when one of the granddaughters recalled losing her precious baby doll in the woods and her grandparents spending hours trekking through the bushes and bramble to find it. He was starving after not eating that morning in anticipation and nothing made lost kids feel better than pizza. The oldest grandson recalled struggling to learn to drive stick at thirteen up and down the gravel driveway with his grandfather in the passenger seat. The stories kept coming until the got to the loss of their grandmother. Their grandfather struggled after the loss of his beloved high school sweetheart. After the accident, the grandfather stopped having the family at the house and travelled to them instead. As time went on, the kids and grandkids branched off to do their own things and their grandfather’s farm was more of a happy memory than a place to go.
“A few places. Once on the face, a few times on the arms, and a place you don’t want to know and where the sun don’t shine.”
It was a yell and screech that woke Sam up. He immediately tensed in preparation for a fight and was surprised to find his face smashed into a tan pillow. He looked around quickly and was perplexed by his surroundings until he remembered where he was. The soft, early morning light streamed through the window in the bedroom he was staying in.
“Castiel, it’s so good to see you,” Naomi said. Dean saw the way her eyes lit up and her voice softened. She must have been genuinely happy to see Cas which struck Dean as odd. They hadn’t parted friends.
Dean held back the urge to roll his eyes, some things across worlds didn’t change including the grouchiness of old men. Then, he noticed the long gash Bobby’s arm and his exasperation was replaced with concern.
One of the constants during all his projects was music. Dean would turn on his boom box he brought from the bunker at the beginning of each workday and not turn it off until he was packing up his supplies. At first, he was content to hum along but as time went on he was more inclined to sing and even dance a little. The first time Cas caught him belting out the chorus to Shook Me All Night long while dancing he had been more than embarrassed but Cas had assured him he didn’t mind in the slightest. It took some time for Dean to get over his embarrassment and dance again but seeing the house change put him in a better mood which had him back to singing and dancing quickly. Dean sometimes wondered if he was getting so sweaty from fixing the house or listening to music. He would never admit it but he enjoyed dancing.
“Hey, I know you’re busy reaping the rewards from all your hard work but Claire has been asking me a few questions about why her car was making a funny noise after using it to hit that vamp. Could you check her message for me? Cas will kill me if he sees me checking it while driving,” Dean said as his eyes flicked to the rearview mirror where he likely saw the truck following behind him at a safe distance.
The grandmother Sue told Natalie they would love it. Natalie told her employees she would be stepping out for a few minutes.
“From the rate Cas’s honey is selling, we will need at least ten more hives for next year’s farmer’s market. Preferably closer to twenty if Cas’s projections are correct and we don’t want to run out. Took us a while to build up to what we are but we already picked up two this summer alone. Cas is worried that we are gonna run out of harvestable honey before the season is over”
Dean would lash out from the pain, ricocheting off anyone who dared come to close. Unfortunately, this usually meant Cas received the brunt of Dean’s rage but Sam and Mary weren’t spared if they called during one of Dean’s episodes. Dean would curse the world, curse Chuck, curse his leg, curse the brace, curse Lucifer, curse the house, curse the bunker, curse anything and everything that he deemed fit. His short temper and irritability paired with his inability to move from wherever he happened to be lying simultaneously suffocated and drowned him so completely he thought death may have been preferable.
But the new hunters were working through their own crap from watching their world end and feeling guilty from having to abandon it. It wasn’t long until one hunter realized that they would never see their lost loved ones in Heaven because it wasn’t their world anymore. That had been a devastating day in the bunker as the news spread.
“Dean goes out?” Eileen asked jokingly. The truth was, as far as Dean and Cas were concerned, they were both homebodies who preferred a night in than going out on the town but it was always easier to make fun of Dean in such situations.
“I…” Dean started to say. He had no words. Not with two parts of his brain so wildly at odds with each other.
This symbol was different though. Cas’s hand was bloody from the cut to draw the symbol and from pressing his hand into the symbol to banish Billie. Dean froze in that moment. He was brought back when Cas grabbed his shoulders and said, “Dean focus on Jack. She wasn’t going to help in the end. We have crossed her too many times. Jack’s breathing is staying the same but we have to hurry.”
Doctor Sands had been talking to Dean initially but when the conservation moved to alcohol the doctor had shifted his eyes to meet Sam’s. A silent conversation took place between them and Sam nodded in understanding. Great, now Dean couldn’t even have a drink to deal with his shitty situation and he was being treated like a alcoholic.
A look of almost relief crossed Dean’s face which struck Sam as odd but Dean started nodding almost immediately so Sam put that aside for later.
“That’s exactly right Jack. We share our favorite toys. I’m very proud of you,” Cas said very seriously to a Jack who had turned his blue eyes questioningly towards him. At Cas’s approval, Jack shoved his way closer to Sam and began to point out pieces of the car. Dean must be rubbing off on him because for a three-year-old his knowledge was very thorough.
Cas must have surprised himself with his outburst because his eyes went wide. His words shut Dean up too. The idea immediately sparked in his mind like a match in the darkness and the idea spread like a gasoline-soaked forest. Dean felt like he got smacked by another semi.
“I don’t know how to sign farmer’s market,” Jack said seriously. Without hesitation, Eileen showed Jack how to sign farmer’s market which he carefully followed along with her hands until he got it. The warm feeling stirred in his chest and Sam’s love for his family filled him up.
He didn’t even pause to consider Sam and the rest of them not making it, even with Billie’s words echoing in his ears. They were too strong and Sam would have made sure they survived, especially when it came to Eileen. But Jack was so small and struggling to breathe the last time he had seen him.
Claire stood at the young girl’s shoulder looking exasperated and defensive. She had her hands on her hips and was positively glaring at Cas.
Around the corner came Billie and she was holding her scythe which was now dripping with blood. Her face was furious and she was favoring her left side but she went to swing the scythe again. The other angel stepped forward and began to battle Billie as Dean dragged Duma a few feet further away.
Dean is shocked. He has never met his new neighbor so how did he already know his name? Dean would have remembered meeting someone that looked- well like that.
Sam slid back into the bed he shared with Eileen and pulled her closer into him. She snuggled into his chest and Sam wrapped his arms around her. He let sleep take him another time. The next time he was woken up by a happy Jack in his face letting him know that cinnamon rolls were ready. The sweet smell of cinnamon and fresh baked goods floated up the stairs.
Cas began to twirl the ring around his finger. The rings arrived in the mail a few days after Charlie bought them when they were establishing their fake marriage. They were simple silver bands but they were strong. Nothing extraordinary about them in theory. But to Dean they meant something, everything really. It represented their life here.
Dean was raptured by the conversation imitating a train wreck in front of him. Feeling guilty for not focusing on the book in front of him he glanced around and noticed that every other eye in the room was on Sam too. Eileen’s eyes would dart from Sam to Cas who signed the conversation to her rapid fire.  Even Bobby looked sympathetic to Sam’s plight, and he had only known the guy for less than a day.
Cas met Dean's eyes once more. The look of love and adoration he felt was being reflected back at him. Dean never wanted to look away but when he did he found their kid looking back at him and Dean answered truthfully.
Cas didn’t respond with more than a defeated sigh and a quick look away before turning back go watch Dean. He stood there waiting as Dean swung his legs over the edge of the bed slowly. He had been hoping his biting comments had been enough to send Cas scurrying away so Dean wouldn’t have to do this in front of him. Cas won the first game of chicken but Dean won the second. Score was all tied up.
Disappointed and thinking about Dean, Cas opened his mouth to reply as the crowd cheered near him. A sudden painful strike to the side of his head and Cas was out.
Still the woman hung back. She seemed hesitant to step forward even. Another customer stepped in front of her without anyone but Sam realizing. Dean was still busy chatting with Natalie, Matt, and Eileen, Cas was helping the newest customer, and the two toddlers were playing behind the stand.
The house was also wonderful in many ways despite its ugly appearance. The living room had two big windows that would overlook the yard and let fresh air in. The kitchen was the most modern part of the entire house and had so much cabinet storage space. It was four bedrooms technically with a large living room, formal dining room, and kitchen was the perfect amount of space for Cas and Jack. Not too big and not too little. Just right.
The last time they saw the curly haired reaper, they were debating which Winchester she would throw out into the void once and for all before Cas killed her by stabbing her in the chest with an angel blade. Or he thought she had died but here she was standing before them.
It was their people. Imperfect people who Cas cared for so much. It was the people they lost along the way. It was the people they were still fighting for. More memories came like a tidal wave.
Which likely was a good thing, Dean concluded. The green-eyed monster named jealousy that Dean had been desperately trying to suppress reared it’s head at dinner. Dean tried his best not to sulk but he did a terrible job at it. It had been "Uncle Sam this" and "Aunt Eileen that" all night long while talking about their hunt in Georgia. Dean had nearly stabbed a hole in the plate with his fork so maybe it wasn’t so bad that Sam hadn’t joined them tonight.
“It was fine, very comfortable. If this was a hotel, I’d give it five stars for the morning wake-up call alone. By the way, thank you Jack,” Sam said. Jack gave him a thumbs up since his mouth was full of eggs. He didn't look at Sam to long because he was eyeing the bacon again.
“Or maybe we should tell him about the time you were God and smited a pastor because you were what? Utterly indifferent to- “
Cas closed his eyes and concentrated before speaking, “I came to in a meadow, there was an old windmill with a garden near a quiet brook.”
Cas smiled for a moment before he replied, “Yeah, I capiche. I couldn’t fight anything off now even if I tried but if something happens you’ll wake me up?”
The only thing Dean could do for the next 45 minutes was stare. He was waiting for Cas to do anything. For him to move. For him to speak. For him to get out of bed like nothing was wrong. He would put on that stupid trench coat he loved so much and walk out of here like he always did. Angels were stronger than this and Cas was the strongest angel Dean knew.
It was in that moment that he noticed the blood-stained handprint on the left shoulder. It must have been from when Cas banished Billie in the library. It would have lined up perfectly with the handprint still faintly etched into his shoulder. Part of Dean’s brain couldn’t believe he hadn’t noticed.
Dean cut him off, “We don’t need to talk about it. Don’t want to talk about it. Let’s just move on.”
That’s exactly why when Dean texted him the following Saturday asking if Cas was awake at 11PM Cas responded he was free in less than three seconds. Dean asked if they could meet at Cas’s place this time since his brother was working on finals for graduate school.
He tried not to think and just drove the back roads away from Lebanon. He popped in one of tapes and let the faithful hum of Led Zeppelin fill the car. He started making decisions and turned over every thought on what to do in the future- his future. The brief moments of silence in between songs or when the tape ended were filled with the sounds of the tires turning over the road. The night grew dark and the stars came out.
“Fine for the most part. I think one of the books must have got me in the head because I feel a headache coming on already.”
Dean couldn’t help but relish at the thought of spending more time in the Dean Cave hanging out with Cas and Jack with a now moveable leg. He would also need to wear his supportive brace until the check-up at 18 weeks. Dr. Sands had even brought the brace into the room and set it on the counter near them so they wouldn’t have to hunt one down later he claimed. The technician arrived then and Dean was whisked off in wheelchair.
When he accepted Charlie was right, a part of him accepted Cas was right too. Thinking about that though was too painful. Cas may be right but that didn’t stop the fact that Dean had no say in what happened to Jack (or Cas) and wasn’t even considered to be an important deciding factor. Hell, his opinion hadn’t even been asked about the whole damn thing. Charlie left him alone that night though she did finish watching the movie when Dean nodded and half mumbled an apology. The look she gave when she held nothing but sympathy and said all the words neither of them could say.
He saw glimpses of a roaring leopard’s head, a sharply taloned foot, various eyes, and so many broken wings.  It burned his eyes and Dean tried to look away. There was something he did see at the center that didn’t hurt to look at and it tempted Dean like a siren’s song out at sea.
Sam doubted Jack was very hungry after all the candy he not-so-secretly ate before Cas stopped him. He followed Dean’s gaze to wear Cas was crouched down with Jack tying up the bag so no candy would be dropped. One of Dean's primary instincts was feeding the people he cared about so Eileen was already pushing the right buttons. Knowing Dean, Sam pushed further.
Unfortunately, Dean didn’t answer when Cas called. He even called a second time and asked Dean to call him back ASAP. His phone had been damaged when it fell out his pocket at the stadium and Cas hoped unrealistically that maybe that was the reason Dean wasn’t answering. That or he was in deep wilderness.
“I do prefer Sam but that doesn’t mean I don’t have affection for you. You wore me down years ago, unfortunately. A few of us even have an entire group chat about that. I sadly succumbed to the illness too. Sam and Cas both want you to go so this favor is ultimately for their benefit. Don’t make me curse you for going back on the favor, Dean. I know many things and a favor you don’t follow through with can mean something very nasty. Most importantly don’t split that baby in half. He’s too cute to be a child of divorce. So fix it. Fix it now.”
Dean and Cas confronted each other right there in the garage with the young baby being passed to Sam as Cas steadied himself for their face-off. He looked ready for a fight despite his gaunt features from his long stay in the hospital.
Sam looked at Dean for a moment before snorting at Dean’s obvious change of direction. He smiled at his pile of flash cards and said, “Eileen and I were thinking of calling it the American League of Hunters.”
Sam nodded along to Cas’s words and that annoyingly righteous-determined do-gooder face he got when he argued with Dean about morals and right-vs-wrong settled onto his face. He was just drunk enough he wanted to argue and try to push them away but he was, as Cas pointed out, too outnumbered in the moment. Cas was still staring at his face when Dean looked back at him. He saw many things: compassion, sadness, caring, and anger. What Dean didn’t see was pity or, worse, disgust.
“Cas, I got this. You need sleep and I’m sure I can handle him for one night so you can get a break."
That morning the kitchen was busy. He had tried to swing by like it was a normal day and found six women mass preparing breakfast. Flour and bacon grease flew through the air and it looked like a war zone. One older Mexican woman thrust a tray at Dean and told him to take it to the library. When Dean didn’t fight back, she put her hand on Dean’s face with a smile and said, “Thank you, mijo.” She turned her back to Dean in a clear dismissal and Dean followed her orders with a small smile at the thanks.
They chatted a bit as they walked when Dean was surprised to find himself enjoying Natalie’s company. Occasionally, she pushed here and there as she tried to pry information out of Dean but seemed to respect his boundaries when he gave short responses. She was easy to talk to and didn’t let Dean’s avoidance for some questions stop her from being friendly and polite. It wasn’t long until she had spotted Cas at a stand selling houseplants and they were going to say goodbye. She bought the plant Cas had been eyeing, one of those weird not-a-cactus cactus things, and gave Cas a hug in greeting like they had been life-long friends. Cas had barely responded in time to hug back awkwardly but Natalie didn't seem perplexed by that at all.
Dean rolled himself to his stomach and grimacing against the pain in his knee as he hauled himself back to his feet. He pulled Cas up next to him again.
Billie was leaning against the wall casually like the world wasn’t falling down around them. She smiled at Dean when he noticed her and she didn’t move from her position. Death’s scythe stood tall in her free hand.
Cas took Meg’s advice and Monday morning he reinstalled the app after Dean left. He gave himself one last weekend of pretend with Dean before he would start getting over him. That Monday came too soon and Cas never wanted a goodbye kiss to last forever as much as he did in that moment. He changed his profile completely so he would lower the chances of meeting another Dean.
Just then Perla, set a steaming plate of pancakes in front of Dean and another pile in front of Cas. As Cas and Dean pulled their plates closer, they chatted with Perla who said she, her three adult sons, and their partners all came through the rift. Cas demolished his second plate of pancakes and when Dean finally dove into his he quickly understood why Cas had made those noises. The pancakes were Heavenly and he nearly forgot he was holding Jack at one point. His morning had improved.
He let out a sigh before he continued talking slowly this time, “The spell to open a portal and keep a portal open requires four major ingredients. As you know, Rowena is getting three. I said on the phone we have one of the ingredients.”
Three weeks and six days ago he had woken up in the meadow next to Cas and later found out that everything had worked. They had survived. Everything was looking up from there. For lack of better words, Dean had been happy. Cas survived wielding archangel grace. Jack was alive and breathing. Sam, Eileen, and Mary rescued people from Apocalypse world. Claire even got herself a girlfriend officially. Everything was good and right in the world.
It took months of hard work but Dean was turning this house into a home before their very eyes. The house repair days were some of his favorite days in their home so far. While their good days were great, their bad days were terrible.
But if Cas was here with him and this wasn’t a memory, then that meant this likely wasn’t heaven. It certainly didn’t feel like Hell, Purgatory, or the empty nothing space. Heaven was struggling so maybe it was no longer memories. So his options were a weird Heaven, Earth, or somewhere else? His head hurt from thinking about it so he refocused his attention to getting them both up to figure this out.
Cas looked sheepish and glanced in the backseat like he expected to find someone besides a sleeping Jack back there. Jack was snoozing soundly after a day of riding in the car. The shift caused the vinyl to squeak. Cas rolled up the sleeves to his flannel to his elbows and Dean couldn’t help but feel disappointed he couldn’t see the feather peeking out. He was struggling to keep his eyes on the road between Cas’s nervous energy and his weird partial confession.
It hurt to walk and move for any amount of time. Resting wasn’t terrible but it wasn’t always easy either. Some days were better than others but he was never without pain completely. It was always there, waiting and lurking. Sometimes, he even excused himself from activities early or ducked out when Cas fell asleep while watching a movie so he could lie in bed and not have fight to keep his face relaxed in front of everybody or so he could scream into a pillow or swear as much as he wanted.
Jack only woke up once during the night to eat and be changed. Between having to use his crutches to move his casted leg about and getting Jack through the feeding and diaper change, that took nearly an hour and a half to do everything before Dean returned to bed. The tiredness Dean felt the next morning quickly vanished when a refreshed Cas handed him a steaming cup of coffee wearing one of Dean’s favorite AC/DC shirts, red sweatpants, and a green flannel. The smile Cas gave him and the weird feeling of victory from the successful night of keeping Jack left Dean feeling almost high from giddiness. It felt like Christmas though that was likely due to Cas’s red and green outfit Dean told himself.
It was only after Bruiser launches himself at the yellow bee bin and manages to crush it with a single, well-placed tackle that Dean remembers Bruiser’s hatred for the thing. Bruiser, satisfied his foe had been vanquished, picks up a large piece with his mouth and starts walking away like he had just successfully hunted a gazelle on the Serengeti.
Dean looked over to Cas who met his eyes a moment later. Whatever worries Dean had about what came next faded into the background and all he saw was a calming blue. Cas gave him a hesitant smile before turning back to Sam.
“Unfortunately, I am not able to see you true forms at the moment, only your vessels. Please accept my apologies for not greeting each of you. Naomi, what can I do for you?”
Yet, the moment Cas had frozen Dr. Ellie Sattler had thrust her head into Dean’s outstretched hand clearly asking for attention.
Cas looked confused and wary at Dean’s response. He tried to meet Dean’s eyes again but Dean wouldn’t let him. One of the seats on the other side of the table creaked and Dean saw Sam shift uncomfortably out of his periphery. His vision focused back on Cas when Cas leaned forward towards Dean. Dean put more distant between them by shifting away from Cas. He needed space. He needed space now.
Jack looked exhausted and like a little lost puppy left out in the rain. Running the afterlife wasn't an easy feat even for someone as powered up as Jack. He currently sat slumped at the table with his head resting on his hands.
“Dean, just the man I was looking for. I was actually looking for your better half but if you’re here then he can’t be far,” the woman said affectionately.
“What about Jack?” Dean croaked out. Before the others could respond, Dean continued, “If you can’t heal me were you at least able to-“
Dean sat there for another minute and Mackenzie made no effort to move. If Dean didn’t know better, he would say she was glaring at him.
Cas stepped into the room hesitantly. The only time they had been spending together was passing Jack between them. He looked nervous but grateful to be allowed in the room for the first time. Cas rubbed his hands on his jeans and appeared to be collecting himself. Dean waited for Cas to speak.
“A partner to practice the movements. They will be helping you like I did today. The exercises need to be done almost daily and correctly if we are going to achieve all of our goals that I had you write on your awesome goal chart in the beginning. A partner helps push you farther and makes sure you aren’t cutting corners because something hurts or is uncomfortable.  You’ll still be seeing me biweekly for the first month and weekly thereafter but daily care is important. Our facility firmly believes that the most important work is done at home and with partner. There are lots of promising studies that show that a familiar partner over a doctor can have greater healing components. So where is the lucky gal who is helping you out? Is she waiting in the lobby?”
Jack took to fingers on each hand and put them out in front him. He put his right two fingers across of his left two and then quickly brought them down to his side. It was the rough but cute the way Jack brought his hands down to symbolize eggs cracking that made Sam smile.
Cas and Dean watched helplessly by while Bianca and Doctor Stern began to evaluate Jack. Dr. Stern was mumbling under his breath has he positioned the flashlight near Jack’s mouth and began to position the swab at the entrance of Jack’s mouth. Jack immediately began to wail desperately. His cries were weak and pitiful with the occasional cough and sucking breath breaking them up.  Poor little Jack had crossed from the land of exhaustion to an island of misery.
Cas spoke slowly, “Well, you could be whatever you wanted to be to him. You could be an Uncle like Sam if you wanted but you’re more involved with Jack’s daily care. You’re involved as much as I am and I honestly think you love him as much as I do. You feed, change, and bathe him daily. He is in your room every other night and you help on nights that aren’t yours. Sam and Eileen try to help but they are focused on other things. Not to mention, Jack loves you a much as he loves me. I don’t anticipate that changing but I didn’t want to force anything including a name on you because ultimately, it’s your decision how you want to be in his life.”
“Both,” said Sam, “It’s both. But you know Dean, he’ll come around. If he doesn’t, I’ll kick his ass. He just wants you here Cas even if he doesn’t show it.”
Sam would never bring it up to Dean because he valued his life and his sanity but Dean had grown soft in his last few years of living like a normal person. Normal life had domesticated the Great Dean Winchester. It was a slow and subtle change. Every time Dean left the bunker after a visit, his hugs would last a little longer which Sam didn’t complain about. There was always a little brother inside of him that liked his big brother’s hugs.
Dean still remembered looking at Cas in that ring of fire and leaving him behind. He also remembered asking Cas to stop later that night all alone in his bedroom. He said he wouldn’t and Dean vowed to stop him. Leaving Cas in that ring of fire almost destroyed something in Dean that day. He could still see Cas’s face lit up from the glow of the orange holy fire flames.
The ten-hour mark came and went without sight of anyone. Dean decided to sit vigil at the end of the end of the table from then on. Another hour went by and Dean’s nerves were practically fried. At the end of the twelfth hour Dean found himself arguing with Eileen and Cas about who would enter for a search. Eileen had earned Cas’s support through logic and well-placed arguments, but Dean was as stubborn as the day was long which was frustrating the other two adults immensely. Then, they felt it and their arguments ceased. The neck on the back of Dean’s hair stood up and all three of them trained their guns on the rift.
Out of all of the people in the bunker, the person he would be the most comfortable (or least uncomfortable) invading his personal space would be Cas. He definitely didn’t want Sam giving him a massage or grabbing him by the thigh no matter how much he loved his little brother. The thought grossed him out and made him grimace in revulsion. No way in hell he would have ever let that happen.
“Dean, we are family. You taught me that. You and I sharing a last name would never be a problem, now or ever. Especially when it comes to Jack. You are too important to us.”
“Did you like the guest bedroom?” Cas asked as he dished out some eggs for himself and began to lather them in ketchup much to Sam’s disgust.
Dean began barking orders immediately, “Sam go! Donna, Jody follow him and get people out. Claire, stay with Kaia and keep her conscious.”
“Well, somebody was talking while I was praying so it might have gotten slipped in,” Cas responded in an annoyed tone. Near Cas, Hannah looked equally annoyed at Balthazar and Dean.
Shoving his hands into the pocket, Cas spoke, “Dean, if you need to take some medication before we go, I’m more than happy to wait.”
Dean felt it was time to intervene. He strode farther into the room and all eyes turned to look at him. Dean raised his voice commandingly, “What’s going on here?”
The paint and the wallpaper had to go. They would never feel settled in otherwise and this was part of the promise Dean had made. It was time for him to hold up his end of the bargain. Dean had a good handyman foundation from the time he spent working construction when he lived with Lisa but that was years ago and mostly grueling labor on a coordinated team with an uptight boss he didn’t like. However, he still remembered some things so progress started slowly but at least it started.
Dean moved to make room on the bed and Cas went to the other side. Cas sat next to his leg as Dean pulled himself back against the head of bed. Together, they removed his brace with Dean taking the top half and Cas working on the lower half. Pulling the brace off made Dean feel suddenly exposed.
Cas had been chuckling at Jody’s quip from where he sat directly across from Sam when Sam had nearly choked on the sliver of birthday cake. Cas to shot him a concerned look from across the table until Sam managed to clear his throat to ask if he could come visit their house soon. Cas said they would love to have him and Eileen visit with a smile and glance at Dean.
Charlie and Bobby had seventeen others with them in the room including Perla for their faction. They all looked much better since most of them had a chance to shower and change into the cheap sweatpants and shirts Donna had purchased at the local supercenter. She had wiped out the entire section and it still hadn’t been enough. Then again, they brought twice the amount of people that had been estimated. For the most part, he trusted Charlie and Bobby. Charlie had already gone to bat for them. Bobby seemed to have the same core values as their Bobby. Faction two understandably put a lot of distance between themselves and the third group in the room.
“Should we go with the old we forgot or the truth that we were busy opening a portal to another world while you prepared to leave me to go on the run with Jack because he was gonna be kidnapped by angels?”
Cas appeared dissatisfied by the answer so Dean continued to reassure him, “Getting that house would cause you more problems than its worth. Scout’s honor. I’m telling you that’s not problem you want to have. Even I couldn’t fix that.”
Dean brushed him off, “Don’t apologize, we are happy you guys came early. Hell, stay as long as you want to. We love having you here.”
Dean and Cas had always had a close and, dare he say, more profoundly bounded. In the years that followed their initial meeting, they had grown closer. Purgatory increased that ten-fold and when Jack was born it practically went off the charts. When they started physical therapy, Mary had been the one to note that they were somehow even less hesitant to touch each other which Sam had to continually bite his tongue to keep from talking about. Cas had lost all reservations about touching Dean at all once that started. But Dean especially was less hesitant.
Mackenzie stopped and smiled at Dean. She looked from Cas to Dean and back to make sure they were following her logic. Cas nodded seriously in understanding and didn’t seemed phased like Dean was. It looked like he was making mental notes.
“You mean the child of the monster who has successfully killed me twice so far? How could I forget.”
“You’ll figure it out?! Well shit, why didn’t I think of that!? That sounds like a plan that couldn’t possibly fail. Are you trying to put both of you in danger?” Dean replied dramatically.
In earlier times, Dean would have been able to take advantage of this moment to try to disarm his distracted opponent but forced onto his bum knee and having his ass kicked earlier left him at the mercy to the five angels in the room. Another sign of just how useless he was in a fight.
Dean did try to avoid the bins at first but both sides of the street were lined with cans and bins. He tried every trick and tip he found online but Bruiser could not be swayed, bribed, or persuaded not to tackle. Dean even tried walking down the middle of the street which caused him to have to pull/drag his slow-moving bulldog out of the way every time a car came and Bruiser would tackle the closest bin anyway.
“Oh, that is a wrench in the plan. Do tell Auntie Roro everything,” said Rowena has her voice slipped flirtatiously low and falsely sympathetic.
Dean didn’t want to broadcast his thoughts for all these people to hear. He had already heard a few whispers about his “fight and flee” with Cas and Sam. He didn’t want to fan flames even more. Dean shook his head and purposefully let his eyes dart around the room. Eileen nodded subtly in response and flipped to a new page in her notebook. Uncapping her pen with her mouth, Eileen scribbled quickly before sliding the notebook across the slick wooden table.
The cuts across his face and hands healed. The bruises faded away. What mud was from the hillside disappeared and the skin underneath returned to a normal, healthy color.  Balthazar pulled his hand away with a smug smirk. Cas gingerly lifted his shirt to reveal the long jagged cut down his side had been completely healed and no scar remained.
Eight trips back and forth to the kitchen and four strips of bacon snagged on one trip (he’s only one man) later, Dean was wondering if it was ever going to end. His leg certainly protested the constant walking. Making his way back to the kitchen with five empty platters, his newest friend gave him a hug and gestured for him to sit down at the table. The woman who Dean had been faithfully playing delivery boy for the last half hour came over with a heaping plate of eggs, bacon, and toast and a second plate of pancakes. She placed the plate in front of him and stuck out her hand with Dean dutifully shook.
“Ever heard of speak of the devil. Well, speak of the handsomest angel and same thing. You talked about me hitting on someone so I figured I popped in to see if it’s worth my time,” a British voice sounded with nothing more than an interested eyebrow raised at Mackenzie.
That night he had spent with Dean had been better than good. As Dean described it, it had been “awesome.”
“… and over there we can put the garden next to the beehives. I won’t put them too close to the house, we don’t want your Papa getting stung. He can be a big grouch about those kinds of things but he would never let anything happen to you.”
Then, Dean talked about their Charlie. Dean helping her flirt with a man while she spied for them. They were deep in the talk about her calling him the first time they LARPed and her making out with Glenda when Charlie allowed him to check and repair a few of the stitches that popped. Charlie’s subsequent hunts followed not long after that.
A heavy charge had filled the air. Cas was offering him an olive branch and it was one he desperately wanted to take. Cas was also giving him an out if Dean needed it. It dawned on Dean that the reason Cas hadn’t given Dean a name for Jack to call him is because he was letting Dean decide what level of he wanted to participate in raising Jack with Cas. Cas was just as unsure as Dean felt.
There was a light and polite knock on the dungeon door that did not match the atmosphere made all eyes shift to Cas holding Jack at the door with an angel blade in his hand. He stood tall, ready to face whatever may come. Dean’s heart sank after the rush of relief at seeing them both unharmed. They were supposed to run, not turn themselves into the mercy of angels.
On the second night, Dean was working his way from tipsy to drunk with the two whiskey bottles he had stashed in his room. Doctor said he couldn’t take them with painkillers so he decided to continue to forgo the new prescription and use the whiskey to numb the pain instead. The burn from the whiskey after a few months of forced sobriety was a welcome and warm rush that soothed every muscle and fiber in Dean’s body.
“We can probably wait until tomorrow if you want. Just grab whatever you’ll need for tonight. Dinner’s almost done and I made a whole spread including burgers. After that, we’ll get you settled in.”
It had been nothing smiles and laughing as they watched Jack stumble and walk around Friday night over delicious pizza from the local joint Cas loved. He even surprised Cas by ordering his half with pineapple which Dean always teased was a sin and would contaminate his half of the pizza. Cas’s face would always go blank and saying that pineapple was one of the most prized fruits in Eden and wouldn’t tell Dean if he was lying or not anytime Dean pushed for the truth. Jack continued walking around late into the evening long after their bickering about pizza toppings subsided. Story time was the Papa and Daddy story Dean had a soft spot for. Cas and Dean talked late into the night on Dean’s bed before realizing how late it had gotten.
fix the house, come hell or high water. It was everything unspoken that came with the house that he was worried about.
Dean squashed the thought. He focused back on Mary who seemed to sense his confusion and looked concerned.
The universe decided that Dean used up all of his breaks when Dean threw the archangel blade blindly at Lucifer. Dean barely remembers throwing the blade. Hell, he doesn’t even packing the bag or grabbing it. He certainly wasn’t aiming with accuracy, and he barley remembers surging forward toward the angels. The one thing Dean does remember clearly in those few moments as he went to throw the blade is the silent prayer he sent up to any god and Chuck willing to listen. He shouted “Please” into the universe and the universe milked every last piece of luck he had left to let the blade sink home.
The rift began to shimmer as somebody tried to come through and come through they did. Sam emerged with a gash on his cheek a clutching an unconscious woman Dean didn’t recognize. His eyes were wide with fear and exhaustion. Alex rushed over and took the woman from Sam. She struggled to bear the weight of the woman before she got her feet under her and began to drag her the makeshift gurney. Sam began to talk while walking back towards the rift immediately.
The tension at the table was stifling. They sat for a moment in silence before Cas spoke “Do we have to use all the grace for the spell. I don’t want to take all of his grace if we don’t have to. If he wants to be completely mortal in the future that’s his choice but I don’t want to make that decision for him.”
The rift behind them crackled with energy but there was no sight of Mary, Sam, Eileen, or the apocalypse world hunters. Dean realized they would be walking into an ambush when the demons managed to break down the door. He glanced at Rowena. She had to fix Jack and be ready to close the portal at a moment’s notice. They would be swarmed by demons too.
The other brother who “helped” around the store, Chad, annoyed Dean beyond reason. Chad was an idiot when it came to renovations, hardware stores, and life in general thus getting in their way every time they visited the store. An exasperated Brandon told Dean one day when he got done helping some old lady find batteries because Chad couldn’t be bothered to stop reading his magazine that Chad was only working there until he became a big-time actor. Brandon sarcastically said that would involve Chad going to auditions on occasion which he never did. Every time Dean asked about a part or where something was in the store Chad shrugged, said he didn’t know, and went back to ignoring Dean.
“You know, I don’t think the Impala would appreciate you staring at another car. She might think you’re cheating,” Cas said as they made their way to the inside of the store. One thing Cas had improved on in the last 12 months was jokes and that was something Dean could appreciate. Most people still didn’t get Cas’s humor but Dean always did.
Cas looked worried and held Jack a little more protectively. Even after the last few months, Cas was still concerned about how they would respond. Scared that they- particularly Dean, especially Dean- would want Jack gone as his powers came to fruition. Even though Dean was now Papa Dean.
Dean thought. He was a lousy and inconsiderate idiot and an even worse friend for thinking that doing something simple and following what people assumed to be true take over his tired brain.
Four weeks ago, the bunker was attacked. They had fought back, ripped Jack’s grace out, defeated Death, pulled Angels from what was now dubbed the Empty, and saved people in a world set on exterminating him. Sam, Eileen, and Mary almost died. The fearless women in the bunker almost died. Jack almost died. Dean and Cas almost died.
“Wow, thanks Jack! This is a great gift. Why don’t you get back on the field and play soccer?” Cas said with sincerity as he held his little dandelion with care.
Cas returned to the story, “Daddy and Papa wanted to have a kid. They decided that adoption was the best way to do that. They could help a baby in need and make their family bigger! Daddy and Papa tried and tried to adopt a baby but it was hard. They visited three centers to find their baby. The first center thought Daddy and Papa couldn’t give a baby the ‘right’ type of healthy home. Daddy and Papa had a farm with a big yard for playing and running, a few goats for that help made fresh milk and cheese, and dozens of chickens so they could have fresh eggs for breakfast every day. Daddy and Papa decided they had right type of home after all and tried to show the people that. The first center still said they could not adopt a baby so they went to the second center.”
Cas got up slowly and put the book away. He started to straighten the room when he glanced over at Dean. Cas picked up a few more books that had mysteriously fallen off the shelf earlier when he seemed to notice that Dean hadn’t moved since the story ended.
Sam and Eileen stayed on the front porch a little longer and watched the stars come out cuddled together. The silence that surrounded them and Eileen in his arms made Sam feel at easy and relaxed. She was safe and he could protect her from all the dangers of the world if the moment never ended. She was his lighthouse in the storm. He wrapped his arms a little tighter around her and she squeezed him back in return. Eventually, they made their way inside the house and Sam held Eileen’s hand as they ascended the stairs together.
“I’m sorry for not running it by you first and I know that you don’t want to be fake married to me but I thought it would save us time and energy with everything going on with Jack. We can correct it when we go to his check-up with his new doctor. I’ll just say I was tired or something.”
Dean thought Jack was the only witness to his dance moves until he caught Cas watching. Dean hadn’t known how long he had been standing there but it was clear it had been long enough to make Cas grin that rare, gummy grin. Saturday night the storm finally cleared and Cas brought out some watercolor paint for Jack to experiment with his little chubby baby fingers. Jack’s unofficial first art piece was dried and proudly placed on the fridge.
“Yes, dumbass. We. Unless you don’t want me there and want to this this thing completely solo in which case I won’t stand in your way.”
The dead angel Cas was searching for was alive but in another place completely: huddled, silenced, and bound in dirty clothes and shame.
“It’s just formula and its easier than making another trip to the sink to rinse it off. It doesn’t taste bad.”
Cas licked his wrist quickly to wipe the formula off. Dean tracked the movement with his eyes. Then, he caught a whiff of the formula and his nose crinkled a little. Warm formula smelled better than it’s cooler counterpart but it still wasn’t the best smell in the world.
Dean couldn’t deny that people did love a happy ending after a troubled start. The people in town would be eating out of the palm of their hands. Together, Cas and Dean figured out the rest of their life story. Dean’s injury and Cas nearly dying happened in a car accident which ended Dean’s mechanic career and Cas’s military career a full year before they adopted Jack. They even made a family tree and took turns quizzing each other on their fake family. Dean’s fake life was a lot easier to memorize than Cas’s since it was mostly true and Cas had a nine-year head start so Dean felt like he drew the short stick.
Cas watched Dean feed Jack like he always did. His blue eyes were focused on Jack when his stomach rumbled and Cas moved his hand from the table to his stomach. He looked shocked at the rumble despite being used to the feeling of hunger as a human. Granted they hadn’t technically had anything to eat since before they reopened the rift but the grace would have eased the hunger. The brain and stomach know more things than they get credit for and must have realized Cas hadn’t eaten in days.
Cas was laid out in the bed and his face looked so calm he appeared to be sleeping. There were machines everywhere in the room. Some were hooked up directly to Cas and others appeared to be pushed farther back, ready to be used at a moment’s noticed. Sam had told Dean Cas could breathe on his own but he still was hooked to oxygen just in case he stopped breathing when someone wasn’t watching.
Dean’s head hit the low hanging hood and Dean saw stars for a second. His initial flare of panic was tempered briefly by the jolt of pain in the back of his head. Dean pulled himself from beneath the shelter of the hood and turned to find a guarded Cas watching him nearby. He had taken residence on a chair directly behind Dean about 7 feet away. Dean’s temper flared immediately because he had been unwittingly conned into helping Cas with the process of leaving.
Cas needed to stop it. He was already too in love with Dean for it not to break his heart when Dean inevitably moved on to his next casual sexual encounter. Tonight proved that. That was how Cas wound up tipsy and spilling his guts out to Balthazar and Meg at 8pm in a random bougie bar Dean would not enjoy. Dean had said no dating but Cas had fallen for him anyway.
“He didn’t have to say it. I know he’s going to miss you but I can tell he’s more happy for you than anything. You better get going, don’t want to keep Cas waiting.”
The static in the room changed as Rowena spoke slowly, “If you recall, you promised me a favor if I helped open the portal. God help me but I’m cashing it in now. This is the favor I ask of you, Dean Winchester: I want you to go with your wee little angel and that sweet son of yours. I want you to give them a good and honest life. I want you to make that house a home. If I could back now, I would have stayed with Fergus or at least taken him with me. You have a chance here so you need to do better than I did.”
Dean reeled back the imagination a tad bit. He still let it fuel their designed life but kept the reins on it a little more. This imagined life was one where he went to work every day to provide for his little family back home and Cas would pack his lunch. They would have dinner together and have normal conversations every night like some kind of sitcom family. They would spend weekends taking it easy on the couch and playing with their kid. Cas and Dean would lay Jack in his crib before moving the covers back of their bed-
Cas screwed up his face and thought about it. He counted on his fingers and then recounted. A smile slowly filled Cas’s face. Satisfied with his own conclusion, Cas replied with confidence, “Let’s say we’ve been married for five years.”
The cotton swab entered Jack’s mouth and he began to sputter. Dr. Stern stuck the cotton swab even farther towards the back of his throat and Dean felt Cas’s hand clamp down over his own. It was a desperate hold that was hard and just the wrong side of too tight but Dean understood exactly what Cas was feeling. Cas’s hand started to tighten and cut off his circulation so Dean gave a reassuring squeeze before he refocused on Jack.
After a long time, Dean wasn’t sure how long and he didn’t want to get caught sneaking a glance at his watch, the party of angels had enough. Naomi spun Dean around and he was shoved into the wall by another angel. Her voice was steady but her eyes held nothing but impatience and anger.
Then, Cas and Dean figure out exactly what Dean is to Jack after Dean gets jealous of Jack's relationships with other people.
Cas let a long sigh and responded, “I never meant to tell you this but when you were living with Lisa I would stop in every once and a while. To make sure you were safe and happy. Sometimes, I saw you at work or cooking breakfast. Once I was going to ask you for help with Raphael but...”
The door to the bedroom they were staying in for the night closed with click. Eileen went from looking soft and content to alert in seconds. Her eyes shone bright with intelligence when she caught the open drawer in her sights. The sight of the drawer had woken her up from their tranquility and reminded her of something. Immediately, Sam knew that Eileen needed to say something and he had a strong suspicion it had something to do with the night before.
Dean reasoned. That made sense and explained why he felt weird all day. They had tasted great at the time and he had been planning on making them again. But if they were causing him to feel weird about Cas and Mackenzie, then they were gone.
Dean forced himself to focus. He wasn’t going to let his mind go there. He needed to find Cas right now.
The silence stretched awkwardly for a moment as the insects buzzed in the background before Dean decided to speak up.
Sam was happy though. Unbelievably happy with the time spent with his family. It was nice to forget about monsters and saving the entire world for a while. It was nice to watch Jack be a normal kid and get to see a town that had mostly accepted Dean and Cas as one of their own. It was nice to see his brother finally having the life he had always wanted. He thought all these things as he dressed for bed in their room after his shower.
“It’s a good thing you had it on hand, I think Jack could have been in more serious trouble if the two of you hadn’t been prepared.  I want to know a little more about Jack’s medical history. Please do not take offense to anything I ask. I’m just trying to get a complete picture here. The person who gave birth to Jack, are they still around?”
Cas was telling him that he was lying. Cas’s hand continued to move and Dean needed let Cas know that he had gotten his message before the other angels noticed. They were too enraptured by the story that Naomi was spinning with her golden thread to be paying attention to Cas or Dean.
“Sam, be safe. Watch out for Mom, Eileen, and Bobby. Get in, get out, no detours. Don’t do anything stupid and heroic.”
“Hey, you made it back,” Dean said with a bright smile at Eileen and Sam, “And you made friends? Nat, do you have a sixth sense for picking up newbies at the farmer’s market?”
The elephant-sized weight of everything that had gone unsaid between the two of them was suffocating. The fear in his chest of voicing his own feelings were out gunned by his fear of losing Cas. This week was bad enough with Cas avoiding him, he couldn’t stand if Cas had the exact wrong opinion because of him. Cas thought Dean didn’t care. He thought he didn’t feel the same. The only problem with that was Dean had fallen more in love with Cas with every passing day.
Cas and Dean stayed silent. Dean had to admit the plan was likely their best shot but it still sucked all around.
“Bobby, you know she won’t be. She’s lucky she lasted as long as you did,” Dean responded protectively.
“I thought about going back to the cabin but that probably is where they’ll check first. I’m thinking about going to the ocean. I want to see it.”
“Honestly, I don’t think so. If everything goes according to plan, then we should only have to use part of his grace. I mean it didn’t wipe Jack out to create this rift. But with all his grace out, we would know we have enough for the spell. Plus, it’s the only way for Jack to escape undetected. From what I’m understanding, the angels were already suspicious so using that much grace will draw them in. For a time, he’ll be graceless until we can come up with a better plan for keeping him from Heaven’s grip or he can replenish it himself. We’ll hide the remaining grace from the angels somehow. We’ll put his grace back the first chance we get. I promise.”
Sam glanced a look at Cas who had finished loading the combs and had taken the final combs and put them in the lower section. He lined the flimsy plastic sheet up so it settled on a comb in the top of the box and leaned against the tractor to create a pathway for the last of the bees to find their queen. When Sam looked at Dean again, Dean’s eyes were still fixed on Cas watching every move he made.
Dean was three bites into his toast when a freshly woken Cas and Jack appeared in the doorway of the kitchen. Cas narrowed his eyes at the full kitchen and bounced Jack on his hip. Mouth full, Dean grunted loudly and Cas turned Dean’s direction. Relief at something familiar stretched on his face. Making the way over to the table, Cas handed Jack to Dean’s outstretched arms without another word.
Sam gave him the sad, closed mouth frown that showed he was trying to sympathize with Dean and knew if he said anything Dean would likely bite his head off. He didn’t want anyone’s sympathy. Least of all Sam’s. Jody didn’t say anything but she squeezed his should for a moment when he rejoined their side. Mary looked at Dean and her eyes said it all. Dean couldn’t even look at Eileen or Donna. They were all sorry Dean was still broken.
Cas paused and appeared to be thinking about his answer. Dean thought he knew the answer but stopped thinking about it when he noticed Cas was trembling. Most likely from his own emotions and not the cold but that didn’t stop Dean from retracting his hand from Cas’s knee, slipping his coat off, and sliding it around Cas’s shoulders. Cas grabbed the lapels and brought the coat closer before finally answering.
Cas didn’t care enough to consult Dean beforehand and Sam clearly thought he was a loose cannon. Dean clenched his jaw and allowed his tongue to trace over his teeth as he forced himself to relax.
Dean turned around to catch Cas’s reaction. Cas did the thing where he focused his eyes on the ceiling when he was on the phone and uncomfortable before letting out a sigh. Dean knew that Cas was approaching grumpy and irritable. He was going to watch carefully both to watch Cas navigate the social dilemma featuring a feisty and flirty ginger witch and to step in if it became too much for either of them.
“We could say you were in the middle of a fight at the bar with a biker gang when I stepped in,” Cas replied almost immediately.
When Sam let go, he gave a brief but fierce hug to Cas as well. Once Cas let go, he turned towards Mary who was already ready and waiting to hand Jack to Cas.
Dean and Cas had discussed starting a garden all winter long. Cas was very insistent that they have vegetables in their diet regularly and Dean had warmed up to the idea now that he had found lots of ways to make them delicious or hide them in other foods.
“Does nobody read these books before publishing? It sounds like they are angling for a three-some,” Dean quipped with a smirk while dramatically moving Jack’s hands about from his position on his lap. Jack giggled in response.
“I found more wanted posters and more bodies that people connected to you. Then, I found a conspiracy theory discussion board on the serial killers Dean and Sam Winchester. Murders and disappearances happening all across the United States. Old college friends of Sam still have a semi-active discussion thread where they talk about how unbelievable it was that the guy they knew disappeared off the face of the Earth when his girlfriend died and then popped up years later as a serial killer. When I thought I hit rock bottom, I found a small little piece of the internet that called you heroes instead. There was one comment in defense of you two with a link. Naturally, I clicked on it and that lead me down a completely different rabbit hole. It talked about a lot of crazy things. Ghosts. Monsters. Demons. Even Angels. Actual freaking angels. People claiming that you and Sam saved their lives from the horrors of the world. I found books called the Winchester Gospels. I nearly broke my laptop when I stumbled up a missing flyer for a Jimmy Novak who I say looks remarkably like a younger version of your partner Cas on one of the forums.”
“Exactly, you never listen. Even before when I-” Cas trailed off and angrily watched the raindrops race down the window.
Shame instantly creeped into Sam. He felt bad for interrupting Eileen. He wasn’t that type of guy but the words just came out. He looked at her apologetically and she smiled at him. Eileen knew he was flustered and he hadn’t meant to interrupt her on purpose.
The steel in Cas’s eyes hardened and his jaw clenched tighter. Cas was beyond pissed now but Dean decided to keep poking. He wanted Cas to be as angry and hurt as he was. He was looking for a fight, physical or verbal he didn’t care. Hell, if Cas took a swing at him it would be justified and almost welcomed. Part of Dean hoped he would.
He stalls for a few more minutes while he thinks about what he wants to say. It’s probably going to be something along the lines of Please don’t call the cops on my asshole dog. He likes to tackle trash cans because his first owners were idiots. Here’s a check for 100 bucks.
Crying was not something Dean had ever seen Cas do. The occasional tears here and there only came under the most dire of circumstances. Cas had always been steady as a rock until he fell. Crying was out of Dean’s comfort zone and his arms were tense against where they held himself up. His instinct screamed to comfort him but Dean hadn’t been sure what to do in that moment. This wasn’t something Dean was supposed to do. Men didn’t deal with crying.
They were in a vast and dark nothing. Each crumpled on the ground and worlds apart. Without hesitation, Cas begun searching desperately.
The angel prayed and pleaded for any brother or sister they could think of including the former exhausted angel Dean had tucked into bed minutes before. With their final breathe, the angel had begged Cas to save them again before dying as Eileen and Sam stood helplessly by. Cas, of course, hadn’t known the angel was being tortured and wouldn’t have been able to help but that didn’t stop the guilt Cas felt from hearing the story. Cas hadn’t left that day but he had been damn close judging from where Dean had found him. Now, Cas was sitting in front of him on the porch after a perfect weekend in April and Dean recognized this Cas.
The sounds of a siren in the ambulance woke him up. He had an oxygen mask strapped over his face and the pain in his head was surreal. He felt like he had gotten hit by a bus.
Dean considered trying to argue some more to get out of this awkward conversation as his brain helpfully supplied that his losing streak of “fights” with his family was considerably high so what was one more point on their side. The logical part of his brain supplied all the information he had gained in the half of the day in support of Cas. Plus, Mackenzie was right. Who didn’t like a massage?
On the other side of where Sam and his family were setting up, a man and woman introduced themselves as Brandon and Jaqueline who pointed to a large group of nearly identical boys including Jack’s friend Clayton from as their kids. Jaqueline, who had been giving the kids orders to chill out when they had first arrived, smiled at the sight of Dean and the Cas. She kissed Cas and Dean on the cheek and handed the young baby girl in her arms to Dean. Dean smiled brightly and took the young girl from Jaqueline without hesitation. Sam watched as his soft-hearted brother started talking to the young girl couldn’t be more than 10 months old.
“I was not a good mother. We can all agree on that at the very least. This was going to be the one thing I could do to make it up to Fergus. I always put my ambition and my own sense of worth to my job above all else. Do you understand?”
The grace sprung from the vial and spiraled all around them. It slowly rose and encased them in blinding white sphere. The sphere shielded them from the rain and casted a white glow. Dean noticed how bad Cas looked now that they were no longer in the dark hallway of the bunker. The scar from the angel blade peaked out over the partially torn collar and his burn was almost fully visible. He was pale from blood loss. Exhaustion rolled off him in waves.
Dean must have sensed the unease Sam was holding because he spoke next, “Sam, seriously don’t stress about it. Cas and I share a room when we come to the bunker and trust me your giant ass is not going to have a good time sleeping diagonal with your feet hanging off the pull-out bed surrounding by paint cans and tape.”
Glancing over his shoulder, Cas saw one of his cats sitting on Dean’s lap. Cas could hear his purr from across the room and wasn’t shocked that his cat was bumping his head into Dean’s chin. He had forgotten to lock his cats in the bathroom like he would  normally do when company came over.
Cas squinted at Sam suspiciously and Dean grew a little more annoyed, “Yeah, we were there. In the same room and everything.”
“We saw at least three in town and a car with four more on our way back. They are definitely looking for something.”
“I am a former warrior of Heaven and have spent nearly a decade watching you and Sam hunt. I think on the tiny off-chance something tries to get us, we’ll be able to handle it.”
A certain red-headed witch had taken pity on her when she knew she was being hunted and helped stage her death which explains why the body they visited looked so damn real. Now that the threat had vanished and she hadn’t heard a whisper of her own name for months, she had decided to reemerge from wherever she had been hiding and the first person she had reached out to was Sam.
Cas had been rushed into the other OR that night before and alongside Dean. Cas’ surgery had been to repair the gaping hole in his chest in a frantic attempt to save his life. Thankfully, the blade had missed his heart and only nicked a lung but the damage was still substantial. Cas survived his surgery but was left completely graceless, comatose, and unresponsive. He hadn’t uttered so much as a word since Sam had dragged Cas’s bleeding body into the ER.
Out of the Impala’s trunk came two blue folding chairs that Dean carefully shouldered before the familiar squeak from the Impala’s hinges sounded. Their group approached the field and Eileen was holding Jack’s hand as he grew giddy from excitement. The sight warmed his heart as Jack and Eileen swung their arms dramatically. Lily was holding Dean's hand until the reached the side of the field.
“No, I don’t think that will work. I need… I need to say it to Cas and I won’t be able to do that with you in the back of my head.”
The tension that lingered in the room was stifling. Cas almost brought a hand up to touch the hidden burn before letting it fall to the side. Cas studied Dean for a long minute before his eyes hardened into a look Dean recognized. The look of Cas doing something knowing it was the unexpected route and he was gonna be a little shit about it. Cas took a deep breath and shrugged off the flannel he was wearing without a second thought. The flannel was tossed onto the floor. The burn peaked out and the lower full feather was completely visible. While Dean looked at Cas’s arm, Cas stared Dean down.
Dean just nodded in response. He leaned forward and gave Mary a kiss on the cheek. She rubbed his arm and waved him away.
“No Dean, you don’t listen. It doesn’t matter what I say or how I say it. You don’t hear me. I don’t know why I’m even here.”
He saw Cas first. His eyes were wide in horror and disbelief. He had been leaning against the edge of a table across from a young girl seated in a chair in the middle of the circle of on lookers. Dean didn’t recognize her. She was young, around Claire’s age, and tiny in her too large clothes. Her black hair framed her face which wore a terrified expression as she sat in front of Cas.
“Only for a little bit in the beginning,” Claire retorted defensively in her signature head-strong tone. She hovered protectively next to the chair of the unnamed girl who seemed determined to shrink into the chair.
He heard the parade long before he saw it. A few minutes later, a large green tractor lead the way with a hand painted banner celebrating the 39
It took him a minute to realize what Dean was talking about before he responded, “What? You mean one of the Brandon Sorensen books I loaned you like a year ago? What about it?”
“You’ve never watched him before. You’ve never spent any time with him. Are you sure you can handle a whole night?”
Dean wished he could boil the Leviathans in Borax and throw them into the Empty with his own bare hands. He also silently cursed Sam for being so frazzled from dragging his and Cas’s bodies into the ER the day Jack was born that he had given them Dean’s real name. The guy had been dealing with a newborn half-archangel, a dying angel, and Dean blacking in and out from a shattered leg. Not to mention Kelly Kline’s and Lucifer’s bodies were still laying where they had died back at the cottage. They had been through worse though. Granted not much worse but Sam kept his head cool when throwing himself and Lucifer into the pit. Dean didn’t actually blame Sam but damn if their luck didn’t suck.
“Did the sea witch have your voice until a minute ago? You could have just told us there were grace-addicted demons at our doors! Why are you even here Billie? You’re a reaper and the only person that has died is the demon you let in.”
The smell of breakfast was simply too tempting for Sam to keep staring at his brother and the entire table ate their breakfast easily. Jack kept asking when they would go and Cas or Dean would respond soon or after breakfast since the toddler had no concept of time. A call from Donna came as they cleared they dishes and her happy voiced filled the kitchen for several minutes as they took their turns chatting on the phone. The ended up talking to most of the girls at Jody' house.
Dean didn’t have too much time to ponder that before Mackenzie switched back into physical therapist mode after glancing at her watch and realizing they were over the time and hadn’t taught Cas a thing yet.
Cas may have developed a crush because his casual hook-up was nice to his cat but falling in love with Dean Winchester was beyond his control.
“Rest now, we have plenty of time to do more of that later. I’m gonna change and grab the cats. We can hang out in bed the rest of the day. Just the four of us.”
“Hey Dean, I need to ask for a favor,” Cas said as he hastily returned to the room looking excited. Physical therapy was over which left Dean feeling drained but Cas was busting at the seams.
“Becoming Death was… eye opening to say the least. You learn rules about the universe you never understood before even working as a reaper. The Winchesters and company constantly defy these rules. I mean look at this situation right now. A witch who has died twice has opened a portal using Nephilim archangel grace. The portal has already allowed four souls of an alternate universe into it with I’m guessing more on the way if your plan comes to fruition. As the new Death, I am done. No more chances for you or your friends. I’m fixing the universe. I’m righting wrongs. What’s dead will stay dead.”
Maybe the rain wasn’t drowning them after all, maybe it was washing the slate clean for the first time.
Sam chided himself as Dean brought breakfast to the table and Cas handed out glasses of milk and juice.
The drive home the next day was done in relative silence with the occasional squeak from the Impala’s vinyl seats interrupting. Dean cast a few glares and some worried glances at Cas. Cas couldn’t help but feel he had done something very wrong to make Dean so angry with him. Walking through his own front door brought relief and two happy cats. Soon enough though Dean was interrupting their heartfelt reunion with a reminder Cas should be resting in bed. Cas had been kept up all night by concerned staff and he felt like he was a little drunk and floating on a cloud from the lack of sleep.
A few droplets of grace that remained sought shelter in Dean’s skin creating a slight, soothing hum as Billie drew close enough for Dean to see her face. She was still limping from them casting her away and where the angel stabbed her oozed black blood but Billie reeked of righteous fury and damnation. Cas clungt o him just barely.
Dean came to the dining room then looking a little more frazzled than normal but dished out chocolate chip pancakes to Eileen, Jack, and an empty plate Sam was assuming was Dean’s. Blueberry pancakes were set on Cas and Sam’s plates. Of course, Dean knew exactly what kind of pancake they would each want without asking. They smelled delicious and looked mouth watering. The blueberries were large and the pancakes were thick enough Sam thought he could use them as a pillow.
The other feeling Dean would experience besides shame was embarrassment because this former, washed-up Michael Sword couldn’t do simple functions like walk or issue a much-needed apology to his best friend who cared for him after a day dealing with Dean’s anger and rage. He used to be the one of the best hunters in the world and now he was just broken and a liability. He never really apologized even though Cas deserved more than one.
"Sam was prepared to give up hunting to be your physical therapy partner. He actually volunteered first before I had the chance to offer like I was planning on doing. But the more we discussed that option, the more we knew it wouldn’t work out. The biggest problem was we all knew that both you and Sam would not be comfortable touching each other in such a manner. Sam tried to play it off saying he would be fine but it would take some adjustment. Eileen forced him to admit neither of you would ever be completely comfortable getting that close. She also said that you would never forgive Sam for quitting hunting to care for you. He wants to spend more time on the road with Eileen too. Sam agreed that he wasn’t the best option but he wasn’t quite ready to back down yet.
When Cas and Eileen returned with a bottle of formula, Dean fed Jack despite his tiredness. Jack was such a happy baby when eating that Dean couldn’t help but smile as he watched him. There wasn’t a thing in the world he wouldn’t do for this kid.
They made it into town much too quickly in Dean’s opinion, but he couldn’t help but smile as Baby purred when he pulled her into a spot at the store.  Parked towards the back of the parking lot away from the other cars to give the Impala space she rightfully deserved, Dean watched Cas fight to unbuckle Jack from his car seat in the back. The kid was overeager to escape his restraints and was hindering the process instead helping. Cas was muttering something about buckles and never seeing such a “convoluted contraption in all of humanity” from inside the car.
“I’m sorry to hear that. Cas is my favorite character,” Mackenzie replied sadly after she took a minute to absorb what she heard. She looked a little guilty for forcing Dean to tell her what had happened to them.
Dean nodded in understanding and took a piece out of the extended bag. Being a hunter, or former hunter he mentally corrected, he watched as she grabbed a few from the bag randomly and bit into one before he bit one himself. When he took a bite, the fake cherry flavor settled on his tongue and he quickly devoured the rest of it. When she offered him another from the bag, Dean didn’t hesitate this time and took a few more. Maybe Mackenzie wasn’t so bad if she was bringing snacks to all her appointments.
Dr. Ellie Sattler would never let anyone else through the door. His normal cat sitter was out of town too. Every option had been exhausted with the exception of one. As long as he hadn’t really left to camp or wasn't too busy doing whatever had made him go quiet, this was his last and only choice.
No one spoke after Dean’s joke so he spoke again, “Anyone care to tell me exactly why I am here with my very own intervention squad?”
“Cas, are we going to the ER or the bunker because they might be in opposite directions,” Dean asked when he realized they didn't have a plan.
There was a renewed spark in Cas’s eyes as he took in Balthazar words. It was hope that burned bright. It was no secret that Cas preferred to be an angel and his subsequent fall hit him hard even though he had mostly buried it. He buried it under caring for taking care of Jack. He buried it under helping Dean with his appointments and physical therapy. He buried under assisting Sam and other hunters in any way he could from here at the bunker. Dean wondered how much Cas truly kept hidden beneath the surface.
The Doctor’s inability to look Dean directly in the eyes for more than a few seconds when talking confirmed his worst fears. The damage to the femur and knee was too extensive. Dr. Sands pulled up the x-rays on his tablet as he began to speak. The femur had healed the best but it had “aligned abnormally” during the process. There was also unusual crystallization around where the pins were placed because he body had tried to reject the pins. The femur was going to cause pain in his future but it wasn’t the primary focus of their concerns. The doctor didn’t offer more explanation on this.
Cas put his hand on the doorknob and before closing it said, “I don’t know if it matters or not but I think having my ashes spread with yours in the meadow would have been nice.  I think you picked the perfect place.”
Sam and Dean worked on laying Charlie across the nearby table. Her eyes were still closed and her breathing was shallow. The cut on her stomach was deep and a large bruise forming on her head. Eileen and Mary reacted quicker and gathered supplies because Dean or Sam were still shell shocked at the sight of Charlie. Mary handed Dean a towel and he firmly pressed it against her stomach to stop the bleeding.
Hours later when dusk was fading, Sam was awoken by the front door opening and the sounds of conversation. True to his word, Dean brought Sam and Eileen food from the diner that even reheated was delicious. Cas explained the wait at the restaurant had been lengthy and then they had taken a drive to give Sam and Eileen more time to rest. Another possibly suspicious but not abnormal thing.
The amount of cars throwing candies, beads, and cheap erasers was surreal. The kids would watch down the parade line to see which cars were throwing out the goodies. Their shouts of delight would fill the air when the car made their way in front of them. Jack’s reusable bag filled quickly as he raced from his spot on the curb to gather the thrown candy and objects against other kids. During the breaks between the cars handing out candy, Jack would return to show off his spoils.
The words came out slow. Dean tried to plan what he was thinking but instead Dean closed his eyes and let the words flow from deep inside him. The words that held truth. Dean focused on his hands in his lap and bowed his head a little as he focused.
“I’m gonna go get the car and pull it up front. Keep the mask pressed to his face and wait for my signal to come outside.”
“Claire, that doesn’t give you the right to threaten and kidnap people,” Jody said with exasperation.
Three weeks ago, things shifted again. The apocalypse world survivors had begun to settle into their new life at the bunker. All the refugees and retired rebels had been sent on their way. The rebels who wanted to fight monsters were being organized under Sam. The freshly alive angels returned to Heaven with Mary in tow in an effort to restructure it.
“Not much to be honest. I remember calling out to the angels. I remember Billie telling us she was going to reap us. I remember looking at you. You looked scared. Then, nothing.”
The window frames, door frames, baseboards, and stairs came the following month. Dean should have done these before painting the walls but this was the first home he had lived in long enough to spend time repairing so if things were done out of order, then so be it. But it turned out to be a good thing after all.  Gone were the days he would crudely crave things into wood (or the vinyl of the Impala). Dean had practiced enough on the floor and walls that it was almost too easy and too quick to carve more protection marks into every window and door frame after replacing them. The projects were going by too fast the handier Dean became but he couldn’t stop or slow down because watching the house transform and Cas’s response to all the changes made Dean happy. It made Dean incredibly happy
Sex wasn’t the reason for his crush. Cas caught feelings for his casual fuck buddy because he was nice to Cas’s unfriendly cat and the cat loved him back. How screwed up was that?
Dean sucked in a breath trying to refocus after the two blows the stomach and the vibrating pain from his leg. In a matter of seconds Dean had been overrun, like the useless hunter he was. Part of him was ashamed to be taken down so easily. The other part of him acknowledged that the way four of the monsters had immediately swarmed him, it almost seemed like a coordinated attack.
Dean gestured to the door as Mary laid Jack down in the playpen. The hallway was still quiet as it wasn’t quite 7:30 yet. Dean glanced over Mary’s shoulder with one last check on Jack. Mary looked at Dean with understanding and fondness.
Unlike the stab scar on his chest, Cas never touched his arm and hid the burn underneath long sleeves every day. He pretended it didn’t exist. Dean never argued or questioned him. He also made sure never to complain about Cas taking all his shirts either. Even on warm days, the burn was tucked underneath a flannel or sweatshirt to hide it from sight. Sometimes Cas would forget to throw a shirt over his night t-shirt before stumbling to the kitchen only to retreat immediately upon the realization he was exposed. Sensing Cas’s dislike and pain, Dean tried not to look but felt drawn to sneak glances.
“Well, I started noticing things were off after the first night. You told me that Dean said they had to finish setting up the room because we came early right?”
Sam and Dean both tucked their guns into their waistbands and move forward. Dean had left his crutch in the kitchen and followed Sam more slowly as they approach Bobby and the stranger. The unnamed stranger was moaning like she was in pain and Dean could see she was clutching her stomach. Sam moved to support the woman on her other side when her head rolled back and they finally got a glimpse of her face.
Dean focused on Jack who was still sleeping in his arms. Rowena’s hands were raised in the air and a small wisp of white grace poked out of Jack’s mouth. Rowena said the final line again and motioned with her hands and the grace edged further from his mouth. Rowena began to lure the grace into a large vial on a chain. With a final tug, Jack’s grace was completely free. The room shook violently for a brief moment and Dean watched as every single protective ward and sigil washed away. Instead of focusing on the lack of protection, Dean turned his attention to Jack.
They stopped here and there. Sam bought Eileen a bracelet made by local girl scouts group that she had been eyeing. At one of the chocolate stands, Sam split a dark chocolate sea salt caramel bar with Eileen that was so perfect Sam bought six more to take back to the bunker for a few people like Mary. People were incredibly nice to them and when they got to talking they wouldn’t stop especially when they found out Sam was Dean’s brother and they were in town visiting. The general consensus was they loved Dean, Cas, and little Jack.
Sam was used to the look now and he appreciated that his brother still approved of them. The continuous joke Sam had gotten used to hearing from Dean was that Eileen could do better. She’d roll her eyes but Sam knew the truth. He was lucky because she did deserve better but he made sure to earn her love every day to make himself worthy. Taking the rear, Sam followed Dean and Eileen up the stairs.
“I think we can all agree we need to focus on the evacuation first. We have a week to deal with the angels but have maybe eleven hours to deal with the evacuation,” Mary said.
They landed in a crowded library. The lights were bright and the voices that quickly surrounded them sounded happy. The smell of food hit Dean in the face and his stomach instantly grumbled despite his lack of appetite. People and angels were spread out across the room in a blur of colors and they were taking up every available space despite a clear separate rift between the two groups. Some were sitting in chairs, on tables, or on the floor. Some were standing while others leaned against the bookshelf. The atmosphere was warm and inviting.
That had become abundantly clear the previous weekend when they had one of their few adventures out of the house and into the small town. They had gotten a town newsletter in the mail for the first time a few days before. It was a detailed little thing. Full of gossip, birth announcements, marriage proposals, and other small-town what happenings.
Guilt seeped into Dean’s bones. He remembered Rowena eyeing the portal but ultimately turning to care for Jack. She had kept Jack breathing while Cas and Dean pulled the angels. He didn’t have the words to thank her for choosing to save Jack’s life and losing a chance to save her own son. She had saved his kid while sacrificing her own. It took her a minute but Rowena continued speaking.
Jack matched Cas’s curious but intense gaze and Dean couldn’t help but think how much Jack looked like Cas in these moments. The blue eyes were different shades but equally powerful. The head tilt and squint when they were both trying to understand something. The only thing missing that stopped Jack from looking like a mini-Castiel was the hair color. Cas’s dark brown hair couldn’t be farther from Jack’s sandy blonde hair. Jack’s hair looked a lot more like Dean’s in that aspect but the rest of the kid, that was all Cas.
The blade hitting the cast material was unbearably loud and the technician let out a whoop of victory when she was finally able to get the cast completely off. Dean got to see his leg for the first time in three months and two days. It was pale and had clearly lost muscle tone and definition. It looked about as weak as Dean felt.
Whoever designed this truck was an idiot and rigged the coolant so close to the formerly blown headlight making it near impossible to replace bulb without undoing the entire thing. It was going take a few minutes and most of Dean’s patience to snap everything back into place. At least now Cas had two functioning headlights. His strong and silent façade started to slip after a few days of sulking in his room. Boredom and lack of people to talk to got the best of Dean. He decided he would try for a casual conversation like a civilized person instead of the stony silence they were immersed in.
Sam had been their rock the last few months and he deserved more than anyone to have this moment. Sam ran his arms up and down Eileen’s as she started trying to sign to explain her absence through hiccups and sobs. He pulled her close again and held her tight not caring for an explanation.
“Last night when I came inside, I did a little snooping in this room and the bathroom. Really look at the room. Go take a peek in the dresser, Sam.”
The next few days were pretty much the same. The case was a simple salt and burn Dean had concluded and a few new eager hunters were sent to do under Eileen’s supervision. It was clear that Sam didn’t need a second opinion because Eileen’s neat notes were written along with Sam’s but Sam needed something to get in the door. Dean helped with the programs Sam offered and even took Jack the next night after dinner because he was weak and missed the kid. He missed him and he wasn’t even gone yet.
“The camp is full of injured people. Most of their rebel army is out of commission. There are people, families with kids, and some elderly that have taken refuge with the rebels. They would never have made it on time rift and they don’t have enough cars for transportation. The camp is almost 5 hours away on foot and that’s with three abled body people with two good legs apiece which most people fighting aren’t.”
Granted if that is how he was going to use the last of his luck, he was more than happy to sacrifice it to save Cas but it didn’t mean his current situation was any less shitty. It didn’t make him feel good when he thought of leaving Cas sitting in the truck alone, engrossed in his novel, and waiting there patiently for Dean to return. It didn't help his embarrassment as the other patients watched Dean struggle into the building crutches, brace, and all which would have been easier with Cas. He hoped he was still doing okay. They may both be unlucky in their current state but at least they were alive and together this time. Dean tried his best to remain positive about that.
“Really Dean? Because I don’t think you have ever taken anything I have said seriously. Not a single time, maybe when I was an angel but certainly not since I’ve become human.”
It was decided early on they would take two separate cars despite Dean and Cas knowing how busy the downtown area would be because Jack's toddler seat took up a lot of room and made Sam feel cramped. Natalie had already roped off a few spots for Dean to park the Impala and for Sam to park his car behind her bakery before they made their quick trek to where a group of Dean and Cas’s friends had claimed one of the best spots in town they had been assured.
“And the wee little Winchester clan would like me to do what exactly?” said Rowena slowly, annunciating every word like she couldn’t believe they were dumb enough to call her about this.
What he does remember is Cas’ grace was exploding from inside him in a blinding light that illuminated the clearing. He remembers throwing the blade without skill or finesse. Not like he had mastered all those years ago but in a desperate attempt to stop Lucifer and save his best friend. He didn’t aim, he just threw the blade with a silent prayer. Time stopped for a split microsecond and then accelerated quickly hitting Dean in the stomach like a drop from a rollercoaster as the blade sunk deep into the center of Lucifer’s chest.
Recounting the tension put people back on edge again and the silence was deafening. When it was revealed that the “people” helping were angels of this world, it had almost come to blows and another war. Sam recognized several angels and was able to ease tensions until stories lined up. The silence that hung in the room when Sam finished his tale was deafening.
The little girl nodded excitedly and abandoned her drawing. She took off down the path without a second look at her family or Sam and Eileen. Natalie and Matt followed her immediately seeming unconcerned as their toddler lead the way back to Dean and Cas.
Sam volunteered to go back with Bobby immediately. Nobody really argued about that. That obviously made the most sense. Sam was a natural leader, a quick thinker, and physically able to do the entire trip easily.  Dean hated to admit it but Sam was made to do things like this.
“Siblings, you got like a million of them but a large family when we would have been growing up would be like eight to twelve kids. You can go high, lower, whatever floats your boat. Pick a number.”
Dean felt his mind expand as Cas searched everywhere again, not just the empty angel space. Dean found him first and recognized instantly that this was who Cas was seeking.
“I’m. fine. We. Can. Keep. Going.” Dean managed to choke out while trying not to scream in pain. Dean threw his head back onto the bed and closed his eyes waiting. They had only done two of the suggested five repetitions.
The smell of bacon and pancakes cooking floated up the stairs and that seemed to wake up Eileen even more. She sat up and stretched her arms over her head as Jack clambered down from their shared and rumpled bed. He made his way out of the room and shouted down the stairs, “Papa, Aunt Ei and Uncle Sam want eggs!”
The angels had heard and seen everything in Cas’s call so they knew all there was to know about Jack. None of the angels had mentioned taking Jack again. In fact, the angels had paid little attention to Jack at all. Hannah and a few others had awkwardly met Jack at Cas’s discretion before lunch but none of the angels spared Jack a second glance. Hannah confirmed that there was still no grace in Jack and it would likely take a few weeks’ time for him to replenish it fully. Even with Hannah being Cas’s number one fan, Dean didn’t trust the angels not to take Jack the second his grace started replenishing. They needed to work on a plan to keep Jack here in the bunker soon.
Carefully flipping through the notebook caused a soft ruffle of pages. Pain tinged in his chest when he realized what he was holding. The neat then erratic scribbles of Kevin Trans’ translation of one of the tablet were in Dean’s hands. Dean closed the notebook to flip to the cover to see which tablet the notebook pertained to. As soon as Dean read the word demon etched into the front, a single piece from the notebook released and floated gently to the floor. Dean stooped to pick the lost page up.
The tone from Cas was less than enthused. Dean doubted he actually remembered the movie because they watched a lot of westerns since returning to the bunker. This was a young Dennis Quaid though, kind of hard to forget. Instead of trying to force Cas to remember a movie he probably fell asleep during, he moved forward, “What’s up?”
Dean recognized that a long time ago he would have hit on her in a bar or even at this appointment without a second thought.  She was attractive, in her late twenties, long dark hair, small frame, and intelligent enough to already be a doctor. In theory, she checked every box.
"Can we just do a normal dinner like we used to at the bunker?" Jack's eyes were as big as saucers and practically pleading.
It took Dean less than ten minutes to diagnose the “clunking noise” Cas had described and another twenty minutes to complete the large mental list of everything that should be fixed in the truck to make it safe. Dean was busy snapping the coolant hoses back into place when he felt the urge to talk.
When they rounded the turn, they saw Sam and Eileen approaching from the opposite end with was a temporary comfort because what was in the dead center of the room was terrifying. A rift to that other apocalypse world had opened up right in the center of their library.
Cas was spiraling. He lifted his chin towards the dusk sky. He stopped twirling his ring long ago and was rubbing his scar from the angel blade that should have killed him. Cas’s statement was a lot to unpack and Cas seemed to be sinking in a sea in his own thoughts. Dean was there and he refused to let Cas drown. He angled his whole body towards Cas before he reached out and grabbed Cas’s knee in a desperate attempt to anchor him, to ground him, the fallen angel no longer flying in the skies but living a mortal life there on their front porch.
“Oh tweetie pie, how I’ve missed that gravelly voice of yours. I know you didn’t ask to speak to me and that Sam needs a moment to do whatever he is doing but getting to speak with the topic of all the otherworldly gossip is delicious. Tell me, how is the new domestic life?”
“Dean, what are you looking for?” Cas asked from the passenger seat as he mimicked the lean. It was the first time he had spoken in hours after talking on the phone with Sam. They had spoken about the case and the case only so Dean could focus on keeping them from hydroplaning off the backroads to the rundown town they were in now.
Walking around the little farmer’s market, Sam could see why Cas and Dean (though Dean was less likely to admit it) loved it so much. Vendors from five surrounding towns came to sell their goods after a merger that Cas helped lead last year combined the three primary markets. The stalls were brightly colored and ranged from unique art to tantalizing food stands. A handmade dog bandana stand was pushed against a stand that specialized in various forms and experimental watermelons which Sam was curious about. A monster cookie vendor was connected to an IPA vendor. The smells of smoked and barbequed food and cooking kettle corn made Sam’s stomach rumble despite still being full of Dean’s pancakes. The atmosphere was happy, light, and infectious.
Every day he would grab the Impala’s keys and use his crutches to drag himself outside the cottage no matter how much it hurt, his new pain killers rattling around the bottle in his pocket. Everyday Mary and Sam protested insisting that he rest and the hospital would call if anything changed. Every day he would drive himself to the hospital before visiting hours started and would not leave until he was forced out long after visiting hours ended.
The pun made Cas smile and soon enough Dean and Cas were deep in conversation. It felt too easy and too natural until the moment Dean invited him out for the night. He immediately typed in an excuse before remembering what Meg had said only a week before.
“I found more inconsistencies and evidence that they are hiding something. This room isn’t right, Sam. I thought it was a little off when we first got here and then Cas said the thing about it being a guest room. It got me thinking. What do you see? Better yet, what don’t you see?”
At twelve weeks, it was finally time for the moment of truth. The cast would come off, he would get his recovery brace, and the countdown would start for his return to hunting would officially begin to tick.
But when Cas nearly tripped over one of Dean’s crutches that Dean had leaned against the seat next to him on his way to grab Jack from Dean, Dean folded like a cheap suit. Cas had braced himself against the table with his free hand to catch his fall. The other hand held the bottle which was just within reach. Dean reached out to grab the bottle from Cas’s hand in a surprisingly quick movement but Cas didn’t release it. They sat there with their fingers brushing together for a few seconds.
Down the hallway, the door to Dean’s room was still closed. Unlike the stickers that decorated Jack’s door, the door to Dean’s room was bare. Sam and Eileen had headed to bed the same time Dean and Cas had gone to do Dean’s physical therapy. He hadn’t heard so much as a peep from the other rooms after he got done talking with Eileen. Probably because he had promptly fallen asleep.
Slowly, stories came out. The house still reminded them of the grandfather they missed and Christmases they had spent in the home as kids. The time they had spent there as kids when both of their grandparents were still alive. Waking up in one of the bedrooms they would share together to the smell of their grandmother’s traditional Polish breakfast. Running around with their younger cousins during the summer months. Trips to town and playing in the hayloft. Drying off in the sun after playing in the creek.
The front door opened and one creature fell through. The door slammed shut with a resounding bang before another could get in. It was human shaped and charged down the stairs through the war room and into the library towards the table where everybody was stationed.  Dean pulled the angel blade out of his waist band and yelled at Cas to grab Jack. The monster charged the closest people which were Kaia and Claire. Claire’s eyes went wide as the monster charged towards her and she braced herself in front of Kaia.  Charlie stepped in front of her immediately and took the brunt of the attack as both Charlie and Claire were thrown back into the floor. It began to grapple with Charlie as Claire slowly pushed herself off the floor with a cut on her head.
Dr. Sands then started talking about the sheer number of breaks that occurred in his knee alone. The knee was done for and Dr. Sands said the thing had basically been “shattered”. Bone was grinding on bone and some of the breaks had been so minute also they had been impossible to repair under surgery and the surgeon had hoped they would heal naturally. They hadn’t.
