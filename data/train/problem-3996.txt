"I thought you... I thought it was human. I was so scared you son of a bitch." Dean yelled and hugged Castiel. Castiel chuckled a little and hugged Dean back.
Sam prayed to Cas as soon as they sat in the car but there was no response. Sam didn't understand what had happened.
"Where's Castiel?" Clarie asked. She had forgiven the angel for taking her father's body, she was happy to hear that her parents were in heaven. She saw the angel as her parent figure now.
"Yup, took you long enough. I got it last year." Dean raised an eyebrow. "I know I know. I had to get it early as both my parents died and I had to look after my little brother, Ernie." She said.
The only two who didn't follow the crowd over to the bar were Jensen and Cas. The two of them stayed right where they were despite the crowd moving on.
"Well then, just say all three - WAIT... three... Why the hell are there three?" Dean exclaimed, genuine shock filling his expression.
"Little man, I think you and I both know who is going to win this argument, especially since your entire vocabulary consists of at most 50 decent words, none of which will compel me to change my mind, though."
"Fine-but if you lose, don't come crying to me about it!" Castiel ignored the hunter's previous remark and reached down to start the color wheel.
On the other hand, he could just choose to become human and maybe get to spend the rest of his life on earth with Dean and Sam.
Everyone but Dean smiled in victory. Donna got up out of her chair and made her way around the table to hug Dean.
"It's not you, man ... I just absolutely hate this. I fucking hate remembering it, and I fucking hate seeing it again. It already sucked that I had to live through each experience once. But now I have to do it all over again!"
Dean pulled himself out of his brother's grip. "I don't know, man. I just spent so much time counting down the days until Cas would get back here, and I couldn't take it anymore!... I am many many things, but patient is not one of them."
Castiel let out a deep sigh. "... Here, I am always second to Sam for you. And I get that he is your little brother, and you practically grew up raising him. I understand why he is your first choice, and I think that your protectiveness for Sam is an admirable trait. I would never want that to change. I know I am not your brother, and I know that our relationship differs from that of brotherhood."
"You see... the end goal of this program could jeopardize your safety, and I cannot let that happen."
"So..." Sam muttered, leaning up against his doorframe. "You're finally ready to tell me about what happened?" He asked his brother with a mischievous grin.
But Dean still was entirely unaware of the ultimatum that Chamuel had given Castiel in order to ensure his safety.  And Cas had no idea how to tell him. He knew if he brought it up to Dean, the truth spell might push him to say more than he wanted to, so for now, Cas had to keep this secret to himself. Dean would be mad regardless of when Cas confronted him with his decision, so prolonging it wouldn't make it any worse... he hoped.
Dean's eyes widened in astonishment. Cas couldn't possibly be implying what Dean thought... what Dean felt too. But Castiel continued explaining while Dean was still attempting to process what Cas had just said.
"Yep, it's that simple! Just look at the image in front of you, and you will be done in the next ten minutes." Rachel replied.
"I wasn't referring to his outward appearance Dea, I don't think that's strange in the slightest." Cassie responded.
"It's just a small little welcome gift for you, I wanted to give you something when I saw you tomorrow at the airport, but now that you're here, I can just give them to you now." Castiel smiled genuinely.
"They are numbers." Castiel stated. It seemed like he already somehow knew what Dean was thinking. But that didn't stop Dean from questioning the angel.
"I couldn't let myself look, Sammy. The more time I waited, the longer each day got. And trust me, it wasn't easy to just stop waiting, but I had to. I could feel my sanity slipping. In retrospect, I guess I should have set the alarm on my phone, you know, give me like a 2-day notice or some shit because I have so much to do, and who knows what time Chamuel will even let him loose. It could be 10 minutes or 10 hours. I'm fucked!"
Dean couldn't help but smile at that. "You haven't even seen the best parts yet." He closed his eyes again and transported the two men into one of the side rooms. The room was filled with vintage video games and four different pool tables, and a few small high-top tables on the side that had board games on them like Sorry and Monopoly.
Cas needed time to build up enough courage to tell Dean the truth. He knew that he was putting it off by not telling him right away, but he also knew that the sooner he told Dean the truth, the longer it could be awkward between them. So Cas would wait it out.
Dean coughed as an attempt to hide whatever ounce of blush had filled his cheeks by covering his mouth. The cough only served as an excuse to do so. "Anyways, it's your turn now." Dean picked up the next card on the deck and read aloud - "What's your guilty pleasure?"
"Down boy," Chamuel said snarkily with a small smirk on her face as if she liked getting this kind of rise out of the hunter. "You're not stuck here. Once you finish this round, you are free to leave."
The next chapter will be full of love and smut, just FYI. You have been warned an entire chapter in advance.
"Ok, so then what's your point, Cas?" Dean asked, still not completely understanding the magnitude of Castiel's words.
Sam eagerly went to open it. He couldn't help smiling at the sight of his brother standing in front of him in the hallway.
"YOURS!" Castiel yelled before forcing himself to take a deep breath in an attempt to calm himself down. "I was your second choice." He uttered much more calmly than he was just a second ago.
"Pupils dilate to signify emotions such as love, lust, and even infatuation. And your pupils only dilated when you were shown, one specific person."
Dean blushed again. "I'm showing you this to you, angel, because as soon as we get out of here, this will be where you and I spend most of our free time! Do you catch my drift?"
"Now it's time for ya to get back to your real Cassie while I fix this thing up here. But, don't worry; this world will continue just as it did when their original Dean was in commission."Gabriel snapped his fingers. Thus returning Dean back to his own world to finish up the questions in round 5.
"Dean… if my theory is correct and you and Deanna are the same person, and me and Samantha are the same person, who would that make Cassie out to match with? Really think about it."
"Confusing you was never my goal, so I will be blunt. It's your turn now." Cas deadpanned, letting Dean know that it would be wise to move on.
"I mean, she helped me put all of this together before all this. Before Castiel left, right after mom had died, I had read up on Chamuels cave's legends, and I thought it could really help you guys out...  Look, the timeline is a little fuzzy now. My point is, you were in an awful state after mom died, Dean. I didn't know what else I could do to help you. " Sam said, looking up directly into Dean's eyes.
"You're the smartest hunter I know, Dean, anything supernatural related you can figure it out with hardly any effort at all… so how the fuck did you not connect those dots."
Dean opened his mouth either to question what Cas was up to or to protest the space between them. Either way, Dean didn't get a chance to speak before Cas was thrusting his hips back and forth, his length moving quickly inside Dean's hand across his own erection.
"What are you doing here? How did you-" Dean started to ask how she'd even remembered him, but that was just out of instinct. But, of course, this Lisa probably never had to forget him, so that question would have made no sense. Thankfully Lisa cut him off, assuming the end of his question like she tended to do.
"I can see what's going on here just fine, thank you very much. There was a beautiful girl right here in this room, and you may have just ruined my chances with her."
? DID YOU GET ME INTO THIS MESS OR NOT?" Dean asked. He needed a straight answer before he would allow himself to lash out at his little brother. Or in this Cas the hologram of his little brother.
"Woah Woah Woah hold on, your names are Sam and Dean Winchester? ... Winchester?" Deanna asked. She seemed just as confused as Dean was. However, Sam appeared to be the most confused of the group; since neither one of the girls had been properly introduced to him before now.
"Until you left the cave... yes." She answered, and based on her expression Castiel could tell she was telling him the truth.
"I can't tell you that, Deano, but don't worry if you fall astray; I'll help you get back on track." Gabriel winked.
He laid there for a moment, staring upwards towards what he assumed would be the ceiling, hoping that his eyes would soon adjust to his dark surroundings. But they didn't.
Castiel responded in a calmer tone. "No, Dean, ... all I am trying to get across to you is my perspective. It is not that it matters to you anyways; because you never want to see me again, but I care too much about you for you not to know my side of the story. It doesn't change anything; I know that. I also know I should have told you about the snake and Jack. And you are right; maybe I could have prevented what Jack did. But we don't know that. We won't ever know that. And I hate myself more and more every day because of the possibility that I could have prevented all this. I let you down, Dean, and I'm sorry for not confiding in you the truth of Jack's actions sooner."
Dean gave his best fake laughed in response. "Well, I have never been the best role model, so no, but I keep going on regardless of my mistakes."
The behavior Cas displayed through his wings probably meant something important, but Dean had absolutely no fucking clue what it could be.
"Well, the funny thing about that is... I lied. I was hoping that, after this, we could head in the same direction, you know, back to the bunker. If you want?"
Dean smiled with tears still glistening in his eyes. He grabbed the wrist of the hand the Castiel was still using to cup Dean's face and pulled his hand away gently.
Whatever was going on, he obviously didn't want to talk out it, but Theo, on the other hand, seemed more than willing to explain their relationship.
Sam rolled his eyes. "Oh, come on, Dean!  You've been back for exactly three months today. We both know that Cas should be back sometime within the next 24 hours!." Sam stated.
"Well, now that everyone is here and Misha has his memory back, let's get this party started. Who is with me?" Jared asked the now-gathering crowd of men.
"I...Ummm, I was looking for the bathroom, and I guess I must have gotten lost?" Cas stated. His words sounded more like a question considering he was making up the story on the spot. But fake Sam seemed to be content with his reply.
"Ughhhh, why me? ... Who the hell did I piss off in my past life that made me deserve ANY of this bull shit ?" Dean exclaimed out loud, still lying face-up on the bed.  Dean rested his forearm on top of his face so that it was directly above his eyes to block out the room's lighting.
"All I see is darkness, Dean. I guess... I guess Chamuel took away my ability to see in the dark." Castiels voice hinted that he was a bit scared, but it was obvious that he was trying to keep that under wraps from the hunter. Despite the darkness, the angel wanted to keep face. He was a warrior of the Lord, not a child who needed his night light; or, in this case, night vision.
"Try me!" Samantha insisted, pushing the knife a bit closer to Dean's skin, making him tilt his head at a very uncomfortable angle.
Sam brought his hand up to his face and used his thumb and pointer finger to massage the bridge of his nose because this entire debacle was giving him a migraine. "Let me try saying this a different way – she is an angel… named Cassie… who apparently raised a girl named Deanna Winchester from hell. Does that ring any bells for you?"
Eventually, Dean insisted on getting up to get a washcloth so that he could clean them both up. But after that, they both just snuggled into bed without a care in the world.
Dean smiled back before shifting his gaze to the sofa. Would Cas expect him to sleep in the same bed as him? Did he and the other Dean typically do that?
"Awesome, now that we got that solved, let's -" Dean began to lean in again, but Castiel still held him at arm's length. "Oh, come on!" He exclaimed.
Castiel rolled his eyes. Apparently, he would need to approach this in a different way. "Don't you want to get back to Sam? I am sure that he is looking for you by now despite the time difference." He stated bluntly.
Jack stuck his tongue out at Kevin, who just mimicked the action back, causing the toddler to giggle again.
Cas knew enough about human traditions to know what a bachelor party is, and therefore he figured he knew what this party might entail. Still, since these were all new people with familiar faces, he had no idea who this particular party might be for.
Dean dragged his hand across his face before taking a deep breath and beginning to yell again. "OF COURSE I'M ABOUT TO ACCUSE YOU OF SOMETHING, JACK. THERE WERE FOUR PEOPLE IN THIS BUNKER WHEN I WENT TO BED, AND NOW THERE'S EIGHT! AND NO ONE ELSE THAT I KNOW OF HERE HAS THE POWER TO COMBINE TWO UNIVERSES INTO ONE! WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU THINKING?"
Chamuel's voice once again filled the room, but she was still nowhere in sight. "Good job, boys, you completed the introduction segment of this therapeutic process. Now the real fun can begin."
"What's going on?" Castiel asked, looking up at Dean. The two men were extremely close to one another which made Castiel blush involuntarily.
"I rebelled for you, Dean... you were why I rebelled against heaven... against my brother's and sisters... Sure, after some time on earth, more people began to gain importance to me - Sam, Claire, Bobby, Kelly, Kevin - just to name a few of them. But when I first opposed heavens orders, I did it because of you. Nobody else influenced the choice I made."
Dean's arms unfolded as he stared at the angel in front of him, bewildered. "So then... if that's the case... why hasn't the Empty come for you yet?"
Castiel stopped, not letting go of Dean's hand. "Holding your wrist or arm would do just fine, but last I checked, you hate it when I take charge. Therefore hand-holding is the only option to convey that I am not trying to control you here. I am only trying to lead you in the right direction. We all know how you prefer to be in control, Dean."
"No, it is my attempt to rectify the mistake of one of my associates. This program is intended to benefit you and Castiel, so I don't want you to experience any unnecessary stress."
Dean sighed, remembering that he needed to word himself carefully now that he could only speak the truth and nothing but the truth so help me God.
The next morning Castiel woke up only to see Dean face directly in front of his. Cas tried to move, but Dean was holding him down.
"Do you wanna know why I left you, Dean, after your 'big confession'?" Cas said, using the stupid air quotes thing again. "I left because you obviously don't feel the same way for me as I did for you, considering you had intercourse with a mere copy of me!"
"Once you both enter your separate cubicles, I will tell you what to do." Rachel replied joyfully, which was a complete switch in mood from just a moment before. She was probably just thrilled that Dean seemed to be cooperating more easily now.
"Yeah, but come on, man... whatever memory you are about to show me took place in the bunker... it has to be something good."
"All I need from you is for you to tell me everything you know about the magic behind the legend of Chamuel's Cave."
"This round will be a bit different than the others." Chamuel replied, somewhat avoiding Dean's question.
"Thankfully, Gabriel had let me remember all the languages I knew as an angel, so I was able to communicate with the locals. In Grande Terre, I befriended a fisherman who agreed to sail me over to Madagascar if I would work on his boat for two weeks. In Madagascar, he introduced me to another fisherman sailing to Tanzania; he happily let me accompany him on his boat. Once I got to Tanzania, I picked up several random jobs until I could afford the cheapest flight to America. Sadly, that cheapest flight landed me in Florida, and from there, I hitchhiked up to Lebanon and walked the rest of the way to the bunker."
"Oh umm, alright... that's pretty righteous, I guess!" Dean smirked to himself even if the righteous joke went right over Castiels head.
Cas stared in awe at the hunter's now exposed chest. His pupils began widening in want as if that would allow him to see better. Castiel, of course, had seen Dean shirtless before, but this was different. This time it was intimate. He was so enthralled at the sight that he didn't even realize Dean had been walking towards him until Dean was standing directly in front of him.
"Huh? Usually, I just leave all the convincing stuff up to Sammy. You know - since he planned to be a lawyer and all! But I guess he's got some competition now." Dean beamed. He would never admit it, but this was one of the few moments where he genuinely felt proud of himself. Dean knew that Cas was just as, if not more, stubborn than he was. Which meant that convincing either of them to change their minds was next to impossible. So, the fact that Dean was able to sway the angel from spending his immortality in a dreary, damp cave was a significant win for him.
"No, no, trust me, the flowers are great... I really enjoy the Ummm..." Dean desperately tried to remember what these specific flowers were called, but nothing came to mind. "I really like the colors that the flowers are. You did good."
"Dean, I'm fine, I'm fine!" He replied, pushing his helicopter brother back a step. "I may have a few bruises here and there because damn, that girl can hit, but nothing bad enough to warrant your mother hen instincts."
"Oh yeah ... right." Dean replied, trying not to sound as disappointed as he felt. "But why is Jack a toddler here? And how is Kevin alive?"
Before Cas got pulled fully through the doorway, he hit his head on the door frame. It all happened so fast that Castiel had to really focus on getting a grip on the situation going on around him.
"I get it, Cas. This was the first time you ever met the kid, and Kelly practically left him in your custody. It was a lot to take in. He ummm... well, he meant a lot to all of us. So yeah, I get it."
"I guess I'll read first." Dean said, picking up the card at the top of the deck. He decided that arguing with Castiel would be pointless, so why not just get whatever the hell this is over with and call it a day. Dean didn't necessarily want to fix anything between him and Cas, but he had spent his whole life acting like someone he wasn't. Being a hunter requires a vast array of skills, and two of the top ones are lying and improvisation. Dean had been able to fool hundreds if not thousands of people during his career into thinking he was an FBI agent or a CIA agent, or even a Teddy Bear doctor. He could lie about his own feelings well enough to convince one angel and one archangel.
"I don't appreciate your tone, boy!" Theo replied. "I myself had no choice in the matter. I didn't decide to lock her away for safekeeping!"
He couldn't help but smile at Dean's response. They hadn't made amends yet, but this was a good start. Castiel had always enjoyed their talks, but the element of sarcasm had always intrigued him. In the many years that he had spent with Sam and Dean, he had observed the many different uses of sarcasm in the human language. Or at least the multiple ways that Sam and Dean seemed to use it.
Dean's fists clenched at his side. "Outside??? I've been stuck in this cave for a damn eternity! I can't even remember what daylight looks like!"
Samantha's eyes shifted back and forth between the two men before she spoke up again. "So wait... Sam?" she pointed to Sammy, who could only nod at her. "And ... Dean?" her gaze and pointer finger shifted over towards him.
Castiel smirked at him, and Dean became nervous because he had no idea what that smirk could indicate.
"Sup, Lil man!" Projection Dean said, reaching down to ruffle the toddler's hair playfully. "Wait just a second... something is wrong with this picture." Dean knelt to face the child, who was still wrapped tightly around Castiel's leg. "Jack, why isn't your hair wet, and why are you not in your PJ's? I thought Kev was supposed to get you all washed up and ready?" Projection Dean stated, squinting over in Kevin's direction.
"Well yeah... I had no idea what we were up against at the time." Dean replied, shifting in his seat a bit.
"Why I oughta-" Dean positioned himself to launch forward at the man, but Castiel grabbed onto his arm.
"It took you long enough!" Jensen proclaimed before suddenly pushing Castiel up against the wall and kissing him frantically.
Dean quickly pulled his gun back out while the girl swiftly put down the beer and grabbed one of the large butcher knives from the holder.
Dean must've looked like a lost puppy or something because suddenly, a female voice came from behind him.
"Chamuel called upon me for assistance in this case. She claimed to need my help with one of her charity cases or whatever it is she calls this program. And when an archangel calls on you, you don't refuse their request."
"Dean... let's just hear her out, okay? If she attempts to imprison me, you and Sam can kill her!" Cas attempted to comfort the hunter.
Dean checked his brother's room first, no Sam. He then scoped out the kitchen, still no Sam. Finally, Dean made his way over to the war room, and guess what? Still no Sam.
, but you both already know about those, so I won't waste my own precious time re-explaining them. The second type of card, though, is something neither of you has yet to experience. It's a type of card called "Picture This" now during these cards you will both have to use your projection power in order to fully answer whatever question the card is asking you. In other words, it will help you provide a visual aid to your response. Got it?"
"What the hell do you mean that you'll be taken there?" Dean asked Castiel after the angel had revealed that he couldn't leave Chamuel's Cave without risking being taken to the Empty.
Dean quickly shifted his eyes down to read the numbers. He had no idea what unit they were using or how they could measure the size of someone's pupils, but the number had definitely changed. It went from 0% to 55%! Dean may have never gone to college, but he could understand that 55% was definitely bigger than 0%.
Castiel walked away from the door and sat down on the closest corner of the bed. Dean sighed and sat down on the bed beside Cas.
"NO, no, that wasn't it at all!" Dean spat out, interrupting Castiel. But he regretted saying that the moment the phrase left his lips.
Soon the room around them turned into a bar, which was very similar to the one that Castiel and Sam saw when they were trying to break Dean out of Micheal's control when he had used possessed the hunter.
"Ummm... I'm Castiel. I am an angel of the Lord, and to answer your previous question, Jack is a Nephilim. He is the son of the archangel Lucifer and a human named Kelly Kline."
"No, well, not exactly. There were rumors in heaven about her existence for a very long time, but I never thought much about it. They were just like folklore or fairytales, stories you tell to keep the angels entertained. They had no merit to them. Well... at least I thought they didn't." Castiel replied stoically. His eyes never leaving the women.
"I had to refuse her. I couldn't live with the fact that I was being forced into a relationship that neither one of us had chosen for ourselves."
"Hey!" alternate Dean said while centering himself in Castiel's line of sight. "You feeling okay, Mish? You seem to be out of it."
Dean rolled his eyes and walked over to sit next to Cas. _______________________________________________________________________________
"Way to go, Jensen!" Dean exclaimed, smirking to himself. It may sound stupid, but he was proud that alternate universe him could find someone to settle down with. And apparently, she was hot, so that must have been a plus for alternate him. Dean was just happy that somewhere out there, a version of him found love, and if that were possible for Jensen, then maybe just maybe that would be possible for Dean as well.
Castiel remained silent as Dean walked over to his door before turning his head around to smile at Castiel. "I'll see you on the flip side." Dean stated before opening his door, which closed behind him automatically.
"Cas, seriously, what's up with you?" Dean asked again, trying to calm down his frustration in being kept out of the loop. Secrets had torn him and Sam apart too many times, and he didn't want that to happen with him and Cas. Especially that they had just gotten back on speaking terms again. Yeah, the kissing and stuff from the room before was still an issue that weighed on Dean's mind, but he had to put that away for the moment and focus on the bigger issue at hand. Whatever Chamuel had said or done to Cas was obviously affecting him, and Dean wanted to know why.
"Fine by me!" Castiel then lunged from his current sitting position onto Dean and started kissing him frantically.
Cas smiled fondly at Dean for the first time in what felt like hours. His smile almost caused Dean to blush. Almost. But instead of blushing, Dean decided to distract himself by doing what he does best - diverting the conversation somewhere else.
Dean made a sound to express how pleased he was, but he did it without shame. Dean then started meeting Castiel's by moving his own hips upwards to match Castiels thrusts. Castiel moaned the moment Dean's dick slide against his own, even if it was through multiple layers of clothing. It felt glorious like they were made to do nothing else but this—the type of connection they shared and the electricity that flowed between the two of them.
"You do understand my ethical limitations here, right? If there were any other options, I would have given you them." Chamuel states.
In the silence of the room, all that could be heard was the steady sound of Dean breathing slowly, in and out, in and out.
Castiel frowned in confusion." My name isn't Sherlock. It's Castiel... I thought we had already got past the point of introductions?"
Castiel chuckled lightly at Dean's persistence. Apparently, the hunter was highly eager, which made Castiel's next question even more important. I need you to tell me precisely what it is you want from me, Dean. This is uncharted territory for us, and the last thing I want to do is push you too far or overstep my boundaries."
"I... WHAT? You think I slept with him? I didn't sleep with him, Cas!" Dean exclaimed. "In fact, I stopped him!"
"Well, I assumed you wanted to get out of here as soon as possible, and waiting for you to follow me in the dark is taking far too long. This is the most efficient way to get us out of here quicker."
Dean used his hands-on Castiel's shoulders to pull the angel closer to him so that they were chest to chest before lifting his hands a bit to slide the shirt off Castiel's arms. Once the shirt had fallen to the ground, Dean resumed mapping out the new territory. He leaned forward and kissed Castiel on the tip of his nose. He then leaned in even more so that their foreheads were resting on one another.
"You will soon enough!" Naya said. "Now the doors unlocked, go get some rest. Round three usually is a doozy. Fare thee, well fellas."
"When you play the game, the timer will count down. When you stop, so will the clock. So play the game correctly, and you will be out that door behind you in just seven measly minutes. Cheerio fellas! I would say it was a pleasure, but it wasn't, so I will skip the formalities."
"Cas...I need to tell you something I learnt yesterday." Dean said. He had forgotten to tell him because of their activities the previous night.
"So tell me about yourself." Cas started a conversation as he poured ketchup to one of the sandwich.
The rest of the day went pleasantly, Dean saw Lisa in two of his classes she looked sad but he knew she was a strong girl and would get through this.
Dean entered the class. It was the first class where Cas wasn't there. He had gotten used to Cas being around him all the time. He was nervous. What if he gets the urge? Everytime he felt like that Cas was there to distract him but now? Dean took a few deep breaths and entered the class. The only left seat was next to a redhead girl. He saw her snap her head up when he entered. Dean wondered whether she knew.
Sam woke up and smiled knowing today was Dean's birthday. He was always excited to celebrate his big bro's bday.
"I'm Dean, I'm 18 years old. I live with my parents and my little brother. I love pie." Dean chuckled and cas joined him.
The three of them talked about about college and where Charlie stayed. Even the girls had dorms and were with a room mate. Charlie said her room mate was a girl named Rowena.
Meg chuckled. She chuckled in front of an angel when he was full angry and could smite her on spot in a mili second. Little did she know that a full raged angel can smite demons without even touching them.
"I- okay. If you say so Dean. I trust you. But don't lie to me." Cas said and walked away to his class, leaving Dean standing alone. Dean felt bad. He didn't want Castiel to know that he liked him. And he was jealous.
"We can share him Dean." Justin laughed, not afraid of the scary figure of Dean. If the room was not dark, Justin would've seen the real form of vampire Dean.
Dean was tossing and turning on the bed, feeling hot and sweaty. He just wanted this night to be over.
"Yes, it was necessary to get intel at the time, and I was in a female vessel back then! You do know that angels don't particularly identify with human genders, right?"
"YEAH!" "Woohooo" "JENSEN'S GOING TO GET LAID TOMORROW!" "FINALLY!" "He really NEEDS it!" The group of men all shouted out before they headed over to the bar to grab a shot of fireball.
"Dean, you came a day early... your reservation wasn't supposed to be until tomorrow, and this place is booked solid with all the guests we have coming to the wedding, so I don't think they will have a room available for you until tomorrow. But don't worry, you can stay with me." Castiel said.
"Yes, it's a yes!" Dean quickly put his hands over his mouth before he ended up saying anything else.
"Ok, even I have to admit that's kind of awesome." Dean replied. Maybe this place isn't as bad as he originally had thought. Dean quickly popped the blue pill into his mouth before his realistic view of the situation could set in again. He slurped down the cup of water and placed it on the table.
For a solid 5 minutes, though, Dean just remained in his position, thinking. Or at least he was attempting to think. Words were still hard for him.
"See... I knew it. I knew even when you kissed me that there must be something else going on. You could never want me... I mean, why would you? I am a fallen angel with black wings... I am a disgrace from heaven, and I am not a part of humanity.
"You are changing the subject, Dean!" Castiel was really starting to get annoyed but then again, so was Dean.
"It was a rhetorical question, Cas... It didn't require an actual answer. Also, so what now? Are you friends with Chamuel? Do you have a little angel crush or something?" Dean grinned and winked at the angel.
Castiel's mouth fell open in shock. Was Dean... I mean, was Jensen just inviting me to his room on the night before his wedding? Maybe I am just overthinking this. My Dean invited me to his motel room a handful of times, which meant nothing more than just meeting up and discussing a case. Maybe Jensen and Misha have a similar type of relationship. Maybe they just meet up to talk about their thoughts and feelings and then watch sports or politics or something. Yeah, that must be it. I must have misread the situation. This Dean, who is called Jensen, is getting married tomorrow. In no way whatsoever would he be flirting with me.
"I remember now!" Cas said accidentally, suddenly finding himself looking back and forth between Jensen and Jared.
Eventually, Dean had realized the position they were in. He hated that it wasn't weird, therefore forcing himself to become uncomfortable. He had to do something. If Naya found out that Castiel had lifted one of his hands to help Dean, she may disqualify him or some shit.
"Let's continue this conversation where I have the free will actually to pick and chose what to say. Sound good?" Dean asked, gesturing towards the door labeled 'room.' Castiel nodded, and they both walked into the bedroom.
"I'm not sure, but it's the only thing that makes sense from what I heard. And based on what Cas just hinted at, I think he may have an idea about what's going on here."
The hunter was rendered speechless and involuntarily tightened his hold on the angel blade he had forgotten was in his hand. Jody was supposed to be at the door, not Cas. Cas had made his choice over three months ago to stay with Chamuel, right? So why the fuck was he at the bunker?
that maybe just maybe Castiel had felt the same way for Dean. But to actually experience this admittance through a forced kiss was far too much for him to take in. Plus, maybe it wasn't that Castiel had feelings for Dean. Maybe he just kissed him because he figured that that's what you had to do to finish the game.
Castiel nodded. His wings were once again folded up neatly behind him, but they sagged a little now. He hated that Dean had to hold all this inside, it would be so much easier if they just talked this out, but Castiel knew Dean really hated those conversations. So he let the hunter continue his montage while keeping his lips shut.
Castiel thought for a moment. "I can't think of any examples of Sam talking in his sleep... but now that I think about it, I do recall a period of time where you would say a few words while in slumber." He replied.
Castiel sniffled a bit, trying to compose himself. "I just... I never - I never thought I could have this... that we could have this. That you could ever feel the same for me as I do for you... It's just overwhelming." He smiled happily through the joyful tears still filling his eyes.
"I'm not entirely sure." Cassie admitted looking distraught by her lack of insight into the situation.
"Yes... I did." She admitted somewhat sullenly, like his choice disappointed her. Or better yet, her lack of accuracy disappointed her.
"It's what you humans refer to as an eye tracker test. However, I added a bit more sparkle to it. This test was to see what part of the image your pupils would shift to when an image came on the screen. It also tracked the dilation of your pupils throughout the series of images shown on the screen.  Now that we explained all that mumbo jumbo let's begin with Castiel's results. You ready?" She asked.
He couldn't lose Cas, not now... not again. So Dean decided that lying would be the best option, or better yet, Dean's only option because Cas revealed his previous deal.
"Well, I think that the details are essential, especially in a question such as this one. For all we know, this question is based on a scenario where the majority of the human population consumed a substance that detonates when combined with alcoholic beverages, therefore, making the consumption of any alcoholic drinks deadly and the - "
At first, Dean's eyes were wide with shock as Castiel's lips moved across his own, but he quickly melted into the kiss after he realized what was going on.
Sam and Jack had supposedly gone to bed hours ago, so that probably meant that Cas was the one currently rustling about in the kitchen.
Deanna rolls her eyes at her little sister. "Sami...You are so incredibly lame... I hope you know that! Anywho, it's my turn! The name's Deanna Winchester. I'm a part-time hunter and full-time heartbreaker." Deanna smirks at Sami. "See, Sami - That's how you do it, short and sweet and to the point!"
"The urge to punch your dumb face is getting stronger by the second!.. But I could really use your help, so I'll take a rain check for now at least."
Dean sat up, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes. He was still a bit groggy, so it took him a minute to remember why exactly Castiel was acting less Cas-like than normal. He froze the moment he recalled exactly what he had told Castiel the previous day. Suddenly there was a dark empty pit feeling in his stomach.
It wasn't like Cas could just come clean and tell them that he was actually the angel Castiel from an alternate universe and not, in fact, the actor who played Castiel named Misha Collins. Plus, even if he did tell them the truth, they probably wouldn't believe him.
After pacing around the bedroom a few times, he was still red hot with rage. Eventually, Dean stopped in front of the bathroom mirror. He hated his reflection and how confused he looked. Without a second thought, he broke the glass with his fist. It hurt like a bitch, but the pain momentarily distracted him from the internal battle going on in his mind.
Chamuel snapped her fingers before Dean could finish his sentence, and in a snap, Castiel's arms were empty.
"You listen to me, lady. I just got this angel right where I've wanted him for years, and I'm not letting him go without a fight. Understand?" He lifted his eyebrow in question.
"Huh... well, you learn something new every day. I should really buy me a pair of those." Dean replied. Castiel sent Dean an annoyed glance, but it wasn't as if he could see it anyways.
Castiel and Dean stood in the doorway of what was meant to be their shared living quarters. Shared being the keyword. The room looked a lot like the rooms in the bunker before they moved in.
"Nothing important..." Castiel muttered and walking past Dean towards the back wall of the small room, still not meeting Dean's intense gaze.
"If your anything like your "soul twin," you will believe whatever you think is right regardless of what I say, so with that, I'm going to bed." Cas said, getting up from his chair and closing his book.
"I am on your side Dea, I am always on your side, but your sister is right. We need to figure out what is going on here before we dive headfirst into any type of violence."
"I thought no one knew she even existed. Didn't God keep her locked away in a tower or something like that hot Disney princess?"
"You knew my feeling for you, and you used that against me. You kissed me only because you knew I would desire to kiss you back, and that would be enough to satisfy the game we are currently playing."
"Probably not..." But that doesn't mean he wouldn't have done something else instead, in an attempt to distract Dean from the matter at hand.
"I'm going to help you get there, Dean." Cas whispered with his low lust-filled voice into the hunter's ear.
However, being the fantastic actor he thought he was, Dean wanted to play it out as a real loss. He wasn't going to half-ass it or admit that he was trying to save Castiel.
Cas nodded and then shook his head a bit to help bring him back to the task at hand. He closed his eyes, and the scene around them shifted for the final time.
? You wanna share what's on your mind with the entire class or keep it to yourself like you always do?" Dean said.
"Good boy!" Gabriel responded with a smirk that only made Castiel glare back at him in response. "Now, let's jump into the rules of the last round! I believe Chamuel explained some of it earlier, but now I get to do the honors of restating what you already know. Think of it as a refresher and listen close cause I am only going to explain this once. You got it?"  Gabriel asked.
Deep down, Dean was afraid Castiel was right about the cards asking deeper questions later on. Dean already had trouble being honest with himself; therefore, being honest with anyone else was damn near impossible to do for him. He didn't want to "solve" things with Cas because to solve anything Dean would have to admit that he was blaming Castiel to avoid coming to terms with the despair he had felt since he lost his mother...again. He knew it wasn't Castiel's fault per se, but it was easier to blame it on him than to focus on the pain or admit he was in the wrong.
Cas looked down, only feeling even more ashamed than he already did. After looking down Castiel refused to move. It seemed like any movement might set Dean off all the more. Dean was currently livid, and it wouldn't take much to make him lose his temper completely.
Samantha then walked across the room and picked up Dean's gun from the floor. "Any funny business, and I won't hesitate to shoot either one of you. Got it?" Samantha asked, casually pointing the gun at each of them.
It all seemed surreal... sure, Dean had entertained the thought of being with Castiel on a more intimate level than what they had already experienced, but getting married was a whole new ballpark. He had always thought if they ever did hook up, then that would be the extent of things.
Maybe twenty or thirty minutes of consistent walking later, Castiel spotted a solid wooden door at the end of the tunnel. He could tell from a distance that Enochian writing covered the door.
But as soon as Castiel's hand was on top of Deans, whose hand was now holding the doorknob, the lock clicked.
Seeing Dean laying next to his own vomit was the last straw for Sammy. He went to clean up the bathroom after draping his brother's arm over his shoulder and dragging him safely into his bed. Surprisingly, cleaning up his brother's mess was not only disgusting but it was also an enlightening experience. In other words, the ordeal gave Sam an idea.
Dean was about to ask what he meant by that when all of a sudden, a shuffling sound came from somewhere in the darkroom beyond them.
because not only is this a place a bar, but it's completely warded, and we allow other hunters to check-in and stay here for however long they need."
The video was currently showing Dean looking at one of the stock images that portrayed a young woman. She had great curves and long wavy brown hair that reached her elbows. Whoever she was, she would definitely have been Dean's type. His eyes did exactly as Rachel had described to him. He gave the women a quick once over. Then his eyes slowly outlined her figure before moving to focus on the corner of the page. It was like he was waiting for the next image to pop up.
"IT FUCKING BROKE ME, CAS. I'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT OF SHIT IN MY TIME, I'VE LOST A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT I CARED ABOUT, BUT LOSING YOU..." He sighed and closed his eyes again. "Losing you again, it messed me up. Hell, if Sam, Jody, Garth, and Donna didn't step up to support me, I probably wouldn't be breathing right now."
"My name is Chamuel." She replied. "And there's nothing you need to be worried about here. I only want to assist you boys in solving your ongoing issues with one another."
The purpose of enrolling him in Chamuel's program was to help Dean and Cas, not to fuel Dean's anger and alcoholism.
"Hey, Sammy!" Dean exclaimed, pulling his brother into a tight hug before turning his attention to Jess and the baby. "And you, my dear, look as stunning as always."
Before Dean had a chance to take it all in, a giggling toddler darted out one of the rooms in the lower hallway and ran quickly up the stairs and down that hallway until Dean and Cas distinctly heard the sound of a door shutting. Neither of them had a chance to comment before a man emerged in the doorway that the toddler had just run out of.
Even though Dean couldn't see the angel, he sent a glare in his general direction. "Uhuh ...Yeah Cas, I figured that much, but hey, thank you so so so much for your help." Dean replied sarcastically.
"Well, if you haven't noticed, the Winchester's can take pretty good care of themselves. They survived a lot, so I've heard."
The figure's head laid resting against their knees, so Dean assumed that whoever it was hadn't noticed his arrival. Quietly he took a few silent steps closer. A ring of fire with a person trapped inside could only mean one thing. Dean was dealing with an angel. As he inched forward, the figure's traits became clearer, but Dean only needed to see the tan trench coat to know who was sitting in front of him.
"Because what good would that have done? You hate chick flic moments!" Sam replied with a small smirk.
After a moment more of contemplating the behavior behind Castiel's wings, Dean realized that neither of them had spoken since Gabriel left the room, which was probably, at least, five minutes ago. That was an awfully long time to stand in complete silence.
The kiss wasn't rushed; it wasn't lustful. It was tender and slow and all the things that true love is made of.
"Heya Cas, what's on the menu ton-" Dean started to say as he entered into the kitchen, but he stopped.
Castiel reached up a hand and placed it on Dean's cheek, using his thumb to wipe away the tears. Dean couldn't help but nestle into the calming touch of his palm as he took a calming breath and closed his eyes.
"So then how did you...why didn't you... you could have called or write or something! Sam and I could have come got you or sent you money or used some spell."
"Why?" Dean asked involuntarily. The word just slipped out of his mouth before he could think about how detrimental this one word could be to his and Cas' friendship.
About an hour or so later, Dean heard a click. The light went off in the bathroom, and suddenly a figure emerged out of the narrow doorway. Castiel crept towards the bed in a far from graceful manner. He might be flawless in combat, but in the dark, his moves were not elegant in the slightest. Castiel tripped over the pillow on the ground on his way towards the bed.
Dean ignored the dialogue going through his mind. "Have you told the person how you feel?" He asked, genuinely sympathetic towards his friend,
"Well, I mean, the similarities in our names and professions is kinda weird, I'll give you that, but I wouldn't go as far as saying we match. I am a hundred percent sure I have a much better fashion sense than either of these buffoons." Deanna replied.
"Wow… low blow. But seriously, tell me, how did you get in here? This place is warded against practically every supernatural being there is, so what exactly are you supposed to be?" Dean asked.
Dean knew that Castiel becoming human again would be a hard transition, so he wanted to help make the transition as easy as possible. He had spent hours upon hours studying up on how to best help people process major changes.
Dean began going around to each door and try to open each one. None would budge. He sighed, annoyed at being stuck in another weird part of this cave, but on the upside, this room at least had some decent lighting. A few lanterns hung around the room on the cave walls, each one spaced evenly out between each of the doors. In the dead center of the room hung a small chandelier that seemed to match the lanterns' aesthetic quite well.
It was Dean's turn to read now. So, he grabbed the next card to ask Castiel. " Have you ever been in love?" Dean read out loud. "What's up with all the love questions?"
Dean walked down what he assumed had to be an extremely long curvey hallway. He still couldn't even see his own damn hand in front of his own damn face, so he forced himself to continue to take it slow.
Once the two brothers were untied, and Sam had the sock taken out of his mouth, Dean rushed over to check the damages. "Sammy, you alright?" Dean said, surveying his brother for any flesh wounds.
"... Yes, of course... I just meant I want to be able to truly appreciate your body and soul that night, and if that means we have to starve ourselves of sex, then so be it."
Projection Dean smiled and stared deep into Projection Castiel's eyes, placing his hand on top of the one still gripping his shoulder. "Thanks, Cas, you always know just what to say to make me feel better."
Castiel's eyes met Dean's as he quirked his head to the side in confusion. "I don't understand what your question entails of me to try and answer."
"I'm glad to see you guys made it there safely." Chamuel's voice proclaimed through some sort of speaker system.
"I can't... correction, I don't want Dean to change. And I can't change the past, right?" Sam said, sounding a bit more optimistic.
Dean shut up his rambling with a chaste kiss before separating their lips once more. "I'm in love with you, Castiel. In fact, I love you so damn much that it physically hurts."
"Haha, under my bed, hiding like the little monster that he is!" Mary said, tickling Jack until he became a wiggling mess in Mary's arms.
Cas laughed, and as much as Dean really enjoyed the sound of him laughing, it only confused him more.
It was oddly silent between the two of them. Neither one said anything, but the tension between them filled the small outlet of the cave.
"Look, you may be a badass angel but let us go this time," Dean says and Sam stays neutral. He enjoyed seeing his brother and best friend arguing. It was cute.
Hope you liked this story, please do comment and leave kudos. It is very much appreciated. Love y'all 💜💜 see ya soon 🔜
Dean and Justin walked for a while until they were alone and Dean shocked him by punching him with his super strength. Justin stumbled back towards the wall.
"Fuck." Castiel cursed and cupped Dean's face, healing on a molecular level. He felt something foreign while healing him. It was as if Dean had been drinking too much. Like too much. Castiel always watched Dean. He made sure Dean didn't drink that much. How had this happened?
"It's good son. But be careful who you trust. We want to know that you're safe there." His father said concerned.
"I'm never leaving you alright? Etch this into your brain." Dean poked Cas' head and laughed. Cas tried doing the same but Dean ran. Few minutes passed by just cas trying to catch Dean. The other students gave them looks but they too busy to notice that.
"Fine!! But if something goes wrong you're coming back, no matter what. Understand?" Dena said looking at Cas, still not okay with him going inside. Cas smiled.
They went out to see Jody and Clarie outside standing outside their truck. Clarie seemed to be telling Jody something.
"We will love you no matter what." His mother said and Dean almost cried out of happiness. He was never a guy who showed his feelings but this transformation had taken his feelings to another level. He hated that.
⭐Okay so I just wanted to tell you guys that I'm posting the same story on Wattpad too so if you're interested or like to read it there, you can
"Hey, come on this way." Cas said getting his attention. Dean looked at Cas who had pie in one hand and two sandwiches on the other.
"Please.... I liked you from the moment I first saw you. Please give me a chance." Justin was almost begging Cas. Castiel sighed and decided to agree just for one day.
"Can we talk ? Alone?" Dean asked and Cas nodded confused. Charlie smirked as Lisa sat down beside her.
The creature gets to know from different ways. Smell, a kiss, behaviour, over attraction towards the person.
"I wasn't planning on leaving you anyway. Let's go?" Cas motioned towards the door and Dean nodded and follwed cas outside their shared room.
As he had completed all the admission process, he just had to go and know which dorm he was allotted and collect his time table.
"You like him don't ya?" Sam asked Castiel who looked like he was interested in the book he was reading but gave off the vibes that he hated reading the book.
Again, Dean felt someone watching him but that couldn't be possible. He and Cas sat at the last bench and there was a window which led to the forest of tall eucalyptus trees.
"No, Cas. I'm well. Don't worry. It's nothing." Dean assured as much as he could but he knew Cas wouldn't be convinced.
"I don't even have one. I have eyes for a certain human and you know him." Castiel said as he healed Dean of the side effects of the poison.
"Dean!! Sam!!" And the brothers were crushed in a bear hug. Sam chuckled and Dean just smiled and patted his back, both of them hugging him back.
No one was there yet. After a few minutes, another car arrived and a woman and a few other men walked out of the car.  Castiel instructed the driver to go closer.
"H-He gave me something. I-It made m-me feel dizzy and no-now I can't stop fe-feeling hot and horny." Cas said and Dean blushed. But Dean heard Cas saying that Justin gave him something. What if Dean hadn't gone there on time? Justin would've- Dean didn't want to think about that cause Cas was safe now, in his arms and Justin dead.
"Nrghh...." Cas was trying to unzip his pants. Dean had to help him because he didn't know what was going on with Cas.
"Oh, that's why it felt familiar." Dean said and got out of baby and both the brothers headed to the front door and knocked.
"Okay go ahead. But don't remind me of you dying again or I will kill you." Dean threatened him. Castiel laughed loudly for the first time in a long time. Dean loved seeing Castiel laugh. He was. glad he made him laugh.
: General Knowledge. This was compulsory for all and they had to write it no matter what. Dean didn't understand the need to write that in college but he didn't have a choice now did he?
"He's not going anywhere with you. Can't you get the hint? Go away." Dean was getting angry, Castiel understood. If Dean gets more angry, his eyes may turn red and his fangs may come out.
Castiel looked up at the tall guy and titled his head to the side, confused. "Like who Sam?" He asked innocently. Sam chuckled a little.
"Castiel. I know this is too early but I can't hold it in anymore.You know me. You know the real me. You understand me like no one else can. I'm a vampire. And you know that I have a mate." Dean told him. Cas had no reaction. It was as if he was sad. Dean was confused.
Garth and Bess were smiling at the couple and Garth gave a thumbs up when Dean looked at them, Bess smiled at them lovingly.
Dean looked around. He saw no one so continued. Cas noticed this. "My mom and dad are both vampires. My brother studies in the same school I studied."
"I want answers Cas! You broke every working thing in me when I woke up and you were gone! My mom told me you left me because you were done using me, for a second at that time, I believed but thinking about it, it just doesn't make sense."
"Hey, Sam. It's not you're fault okay. You were just helping me and.....Dean. Don't blame yourself. Dean wouldn't want that." Castiel says as soothingly possible at that time.
Dean started laughing as he saw Sam. His hair had turned pink. He had no clue how but it was damn funny.
Castiel nodded. "Yes, I died. And was brought back. I don't by who. Maybe God. I didn't remember anything except for the lingering foreign sadness and hurt. I used to hear whispers every night. Now I know it was you." Castiel stooped to look at his beautiful freckle-faced boyfriend. Dean blushed remembering how badly he wanted Cas back. Dean leaned forward and kissed Castiel softly.
"Sam, you know I don't sleep," Cas responds. Sam chuckled and sat a little too close to Castiel. Sam had come out as bisexual last month, Dean had no problem with it nor did Cas.
Dean was in a bad shape and just when Sam stepped forward to talk to Dean, his phone rang. The caller ID showed "Garth". Sam smiled and picked up the phone.
Jody sighed, giving up. "Anyways, why was there no call from you both? Were you guys hunting?" She asked
"Sure, Ca-Steve. I'll meet you there." Sam says and exits the shop still shocked to see their Cas there.
"I would never ever hate you or leave you. Remember this forever. Don't be scared little angel. I'll always be with you." Dean kisses Cas' each eye telling him that he loves him again and again.
"Oh so only Winchester can call you that ? Hmm? you're mine." Justin leaned near Cas neck and licked. Cas tried pushing him away but no luck. Justin was stronger than him.
"Castiel. That's a nice name." Charlie said with a wink. That girl made it her life goal to make Dean jealous.
"We were under the bright blue sky, pointing out different shapes of the clouds and you said I left you when you told me who you were and before you could complete the sentence, everything changed. A woman with white hair stood and she told me to take care of you and never to hurt you. She told me you are precious to her and I got up and saw that you weren't there. I thought someone took you away."
But how had this happened? The last time was because he had Leviathans inside him. What was the reason now?
They sat outside, on the bench. Cas was still crying. Dean didn't understand what happened. That's when he smelled a different smell on Cas. Justin. That bitch. Dean calmed himself for his boyfriend. His angel needed him now. He couldn't get angry.
"Did you guys hear that Justin got beat up pretty badly so much that his nose is dislocated?" Castiel looked down, Dean had hit Justin because of him.
Dean follwed him outside the cafeteria and sat at the place under the huge tree. The both boys sat at the corners turned to each other with food in between them.
He had an idea of where they would be and went there. He saw his boyfriend smiling happily and singing to some Chinese song.(he better not tell that in front of Cas. Lol)
He saw Sam and Cas standing in front of each other as if they had fought for a good one hour. Dean was confused. What was the reason his brother got angry and that too on Cas? He was scared.
Sam suggested that he'd drive, Dean agreed still thinking about what happened to Cas. Will he come back to him? Dean was emotionally weak, after seeing so many of his loved ones die, he was not ready to see Castiel's lifeless body.
"It's not you, Lis. It's me. I don't want to hurt you in the future. I don't want to lead you on even though I don't feel like before towards you. Please forgive me. I'm sure you will find someone better than me. Good night, Lis." Dean kissed her forehead one last time and smiled at her and walked back to his building.
They both plopped down on their respective beds watching the ceiling when they heard a knock. Cas looked to Dean, who recognised the smell as Lisa. Dean made a mental note to break up with her as soon as possible, as it would be safe for him as well as her.
Four of them sat at their usual table and Dean and Castiel took the same dinner as before. Charlie got an ice-cream. God knows why there was ice cream for dinner. Lisa took a burger.
"Yeah, I do. He's hurt, Sam. I do not understand why he doesn't admit his feelings but I guess he has reas-" Castiel couldn't finish when he felt physical pain. He didn't disappear this time, he ran to Dean's room worried, Sam following suit.
"Her college was taking them on a trip and this girl here didn't go and instead found a case here and I'm assuming you're here for that too."Jody said still not okay with Clarie being here.
"I just wanted you! And you are following him around like a lovesick puppy as if he loves you. Because newsflash, he doesn't. It's just brotherly love, try learning to differentiate between them." She said with a hopeful glint in her eyes.
Castiel held Dean's chin and made him look at him and gasped. Dean's eyes had turned red from green. Castiel didn't know about the colour changes.
"Uh Garth, you said you had them a few days back but they already look like 3 years old." Sam asked. Garth just laughed.
"Good. And wipe your..." Cas said pointing his lips indicating Dean should wipe the remaining blood on his lips.
He got up shakily and tried standing in one place. Dean had seen Cas like that millions of times before and whenever he touched him, he would fade so this time he didn't dare take a step forward. He stood put. Dean saw Castiel snap his fingers making the others in the room conscious. The others slowly stood up.
"I'm losing my grace. Only a little bit is left in me. I lost most of it when.....I um...was being.... tortured." Castiel took a deep breath. Dean was looking at him shocked. Castiel was losing his grace? Dean didn't care if Castiel had his grace or not, whether he was an angel or a human because to him Castiel will always be his angel.
"Yeah. My mom invited you too. So I wanted to ask if we could go visit them before going to your parents'?"
Cas hugged the other. It had been a long time since they had any physical contact. In fact a very long time.
He felt a stray tear rolling down his face and wiped it quickly. He couldn't hide the tears anymore and just cried.
"I'm sorry Cas." Sam's voice broke. This was never his intention. He felt like killing himself for doing this to his only brother who cared about him.
"Morning, I guess?" Dean said laughing nervously. Sam could see the slight anger and jealous lingering in Dean's eyes, he was surprised that Dean hid it pretty well.
"Didn't he once tell you that he wants to adopt kids after you both get a job and have a stable income. Bitch it might not be his."
👉Since I have no idea how the college's are, I am creating an entirely new universe. So it might be completely different that the real life.
"He told me his parents told him about our kind. He helped me when I felt the thirst towards Lisa when she came over." Dean informed.
Castiel had changed his full attire. He had gotten rid of the trenchcoat, his everyday clothes. He was dressed in brand new black jeans and a white shirt which was not tucked in, a tie was loosely hung from his neck and that hair......godamnit, was gorgeous. Dean was left speechless by seeing Cas. He walked up to Cas who was standing there and waiting for a reply from the brothers.
Dean had his art class before the second break. It was an exhausting class, but Dean liked it. They were given a project of drawing a picture of the thing or a person that makes you feel special. Dean had someone in mind and so did Charlie. The teacher told them since it was a joint project with their partner, it has to be unique. The teacher wanted a single drawing which contains the told topic.
Lisa checked her watch, it was 2.03pm and it'll take exactly 15 mins from the park to Dean's house.  She ran to tell her best friend that his boyfriend was leaving him yet again.
"Sure. But how'd you know where I was placed?" Dean asked. Lisa being too near, was dangerous. Even though he was drinking blood, the blood from the vein was more delicious. Dean felt thirsty, thirsty for Lisa's blood. He drank the rest of the bottle in one go and wiped his mouth so there won't be any remains.
"He doesn't love you, who loves a nerd like you. You're just his pass time. He will leave you after he's used you."
He was just standing there watching him sway his hips as he danced with Charlie. Dean was so thankful to have a friend like Charlie. She made his baby happy and he couldn't be more grateful.
"What's the meaning of this?" Dean asked.  "You want to know the truth? Well I can't tell you so I'm just gonna show it to you. Be ready. I'll call you."
"Look after me? Why?" He asked. Sam just kept quiet. Dean rushed out of the room searching for his angel.
Dean dared a step forward to Castiel and the rest was covered by Castiel himself. Now they were standing so close to each other.
"Dean! You can't fucking die on me like this. Get up you assbutt!" He yelled shaking Dean. Sam was surprised and was filled with different emotions, surprised because Cas, an angel of the lord used a curse word. Sad because Cas was yelling at Dean to wake up. Confused because he didn't understand why Dean didn't wake up even though Cas healed him.
"And how would I know that? You didn't exactly spell it out or anything when we arrived here." The redness in Castiel's cheeks was now imminent, and Chamuel noticed his growing rage.
"I better go intervene before things take a turn for the worse. The last time I attempted to wait it out, hair-pulling was involved, and Dea refused to go out without wearing a baseball for a month. I'll… see you both out there in a minute, correct?" Cassie asked as she walked forward before turning around at the doorway to face the two brothers.
Dean wiped his eyes and breathed in deeply. "I know - I know - I'm sorry! It was just so out of left field that I didn't expect it." Dean finally got his laughter entirely under control. "No, Cas, I'm not proposing to you! I only meant that you are as much a Winchester as Sam or I. You're a part of our family, Cas! Doesn't matter if you are an angel or not. Family don't end in blood!"
"Jack wasn't just your responsibility. He was mine, and he was Sams as well. If we had only had seen the signs that YOU saw, Mary might still be here safe and sound."
Deanna slapped her hand to her forehead at the new girl's comment. "Cassie, we've been over this… Die Hard is a Christmas movie; therefore, we only watch it around Christmas time. It's August right now!" She explained.
"I think that it's your pride that gets us into a lot of messes in the first place." He lied again. Thankfully being a hunter also made him a fantastic actor, so despite the pain, he felt in his chest.
"Well, I guess you got a point there." Dean exhaled and sat down on the corner of the bed, putting his head into his hands. "But what does Castiel have to do with any of this? Why did I have to admit all my deep dark secrets to him of all people?" Dean asked.
Whoever the man was, he was very tall, somewhere between Sam's and Dean's height, and he had a slim build. Other than that, Dean could only best compare the man's appearance to that of a much younger, somewhat tanner version of Bill Nye. Complete with the white lab coat and goggles. Which Dean guessed worked for him considering his current task. Then again, all scientists reminded Dean of Bill Nye for some reason. It probably had something to do with how catchy his theme song was but nonetheless.
"So you charge hunters to stay here?" Cas asked, but Dean didn't seem to mind since he had apparently thought everything out in extreme detail.
"Alright, well...here goes nothing!" Dean dropped the jacket covering the flames that went underneath it. Castiel quickly leaped across the jacket and straight into Dean's chest, causing the two men to fall to the ground, one on top of the other.
"Oh fuck man... I'm sorry. I just saw you and Jared, and I have been looking for you for like a half-hour, so when I saw you, I must've gotten a bit excited. Are you gonna be okay? Do you have a concussion? How many fingers am I holding up?" Fake Dean held up three fingers.
"But even after I told you who I was, you still stabbed me!" Castiel replied. He talked about getting stabbed like it was a normal event.
"Nah... He just hates showing any type of emotion other than his typical tough-guy act." Jared proclaimed. "He'll get over it."
"So... what about Jack?" Cas didn't want to ask, but he wanted to know if Jack existed in Dean's fantasy land since he didn't see him at the bar and Dean had yet to mention him.
Dean and Castiel sat in the adjacent seats in the center room and attempted to begin the third round of truth questions. But before Dean could lift a card, a voice came over the hidden speaker system.
Cas wasn't inside the room at all. Instead, there stood some chick with long dirty blonde hair drinking a beer, wearing green plaid pajama pants and a black Metallica t-shirt.
Dean couldn't bear to look at it any longer without actually feeling physical pain in his chest. The moment that Dean looked away though the guilt of what he said earlier seemed to go away and was once again replaced with his annoyance and anger at the entirety of the current situation. He remembered that not only did Cas storm out of room 5 once Dean had practically laid all his mushy feelings out on the table. Also according to Chamuel, Cas was also apparently keeping something from him about why his wings decided to make a guest appearance in this dimension. Which, of course, only fueled Dean's anger all the more.
"Yes, you can... Look, deep down, you knew how you always truly felt. You knew you were never completely straight. You just didn't want to upset Dad or me or anyone for that matter by admitting it. So you kept it hidden."
"What are you talking about? The only way the empty will come for me is if I find true happiness... And the only way for that to happen is if...."
This only annoyed Dean, considering he had a couple of comments and questions about it. Still, he decided that he could always ask later if need be.
"DONE!" Castiel exclaimed, setting the empty cup of water down onto the table in front of him. "Now tell me, what does it do?"
After a minute or two of kissing, both longed for more, but both were hesitant to go any further without discussing what was going on between them. However, that didn't stop Dean from involuntary thrusting his hips up into Castiel.
Dean grabbed his gun from where he kept it hidden underneath his pillow and cautiously made his way out into the hallway.
Chamuel continued speaking, "The clicking sound you boys heard was the unlocking of door one. After each round of questions, a different door will be unlocked. Your goal is to complete whatever task lies on the other side of that door before beginning the next round of questions. Do you boys understand?"
Now Cas was red with rage. "You're mad at me? YOU'RE SERIOUSLY MAD AT ME, DEAN? YOU AND I BOTH KNOW YOU MEANT NONE OF WHAT YOU SAID OR IMPLIED IN THERE! YOU WERE JUST IN NEED OF SEX, AND I'M THE ONLY OTHER PERSON STUCK HERE WITH YOU, SO PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER. BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF, DEAN!" He yelled back at the hunter. Castiel's wings spread out and flapped back and forth. Dean actually felt intimidated by them, but he damn well wasn't about to back down.
"So what happened? You found an earlier flight and decided to surprise me or something like that?" Castiel asked.
"Do I really need to explain my reasoning to you?" Castiel asked, starting to get annoyed at the Archangel's ignorance." You got what you wanted. I made my choice. Now your practice can still exist under whatever ethical guidelines you claim to have a rule over you."
"I figured that I had already sufficiently answered the question at hand and that we should move forward with your turn." Cas said.
"And what the fuck is that suppose to mean?" Dean replied, his tone growing more and more frustrated with the angel's actions.
"But Jensen is me, just me from a different timeline with a less deadly occupation. But still me all the same." Dean stated though he wasn't one hundred percent sure he believed his own words to be true.
"Hold tight for just a second, you two!" a male voice stated, startling both the hunter and the angel. "I will have the house lights on in just one moment. I am almost done - .... And PERFECT." The voice exclaimed.
"You are also stubborn to no end. It's your way or the highway as you humans phrase it. You never see anything from any point of view except for your own which is extremely irritating especially when I know you are wrong."
Dean had finally finished the tedious task of those damn buttons and slid his hands up and across Castiel's bare chest until both hands stopped on his shoulders underneath the cloth of his shirt. Castiel's shivered from the sensation of skin-on-skin contact as he closed his eyes to savor the feeling.
"Well, how do you know you aren't? I mean, you said it yourself that you have a hard time grasping human emotion. So how do you know you truly love this person?"
Just the thought alone made Dean shake with excitement.  On the other hand, his trembling may also be a result of nerves. No matter what happened tonight, this would be a pivotal moment for them, and Dean really didn't want to fuck it up somehow.
"Yes, which is exactly why I have to follow them. I know you don't understand yet, but you will. Take a minute and come see me for your assignment whenever you're ready."
"Did you happen to talk to Sam and Jess to see when they planned to arrive here? I know they were planning on flying, but with Sam's new job promotion and them having a four-month-old to bring along with them, they haven't been able to respond to any of my texts recently."
"I am NOT your friend!" Castiel responded by throwing Theo's hand off his shoulder. "You know what you tried to force me into. You and I are by no means friends or acquaintances of any sort."
"Really? What did I say?" Dean asked curiously. He had no idea what topic his subconscious would focus on while he slept. Dean never really remembered any of his dreams. He only ever remembered his nightmares.
Castiel finally looked back, deeply into Dean's eyes. His pupils widening comically large, like some Disney animated film. "Because he wasn't you, Dean."
Dean was about to ask Castiel to go on to the next memory. However, when the hunter looked over at the angel standing beside him, he found that Castiel was still smiling at the frozen scene laid out in front of them.
Dean slammed a hand down on the table. Making both women jump a bit. "THAT'S ALL HE EVER TRIES TO DO." He yelled and then sighed to calm himself down. "I don't deserve his help... I don't deserve any of your help. So why don't all three of you just head home and focus on your own damn lives? No point in worrying about the one that's already fucking broken beyond repair."
"What, why? We've gone further than this before in your trailer, my trailer, stage 3, and even that one time on the bus." Jensen smirked back slightly.
Neither man said anything. Neither man looked at one another. Both men just stood in silence. They both needed to process different things about what had just happened between them.
"I may not have control over the past, over what happens to Jack, or what happened to mom... So, I have to focus my efforts on what I do have some control over. It's all I can do right now. Therefore, the only situation that I do have some control over is Cas and Dean's altercation. Dean still blames Cas for mom's death, and he is pushing Cas away. Their problem is the only one on the list that I have the capability of altering, and hopefully, if I am lucky... I can fix and maybe even amplify their relationship!" Sam smirked to himself, proud of coming to this realization.
Dean wondered why he was being so honest and straightforward with Castiel, but then the reason became clear; they were still standing in the center room. The one-room where Dean had to be completely honest.
"I know exactly what I am doing, Cas, and it may have worked if you weren't such a stubborn dick!" Dean began searching the room for anything to put the fire out.
Castiel yawned, still obviously waking up, he had hardly gotten any sleep last night, and his face was a testament to that.
Hey guys, so this chapter explains a bit more about the dynamic of the game/the rules of it all.  It is important/necessary to the story and I wanted to make sure that the game was clearly laid out. I tried to make it as enjoyable of a read as possible but it is kind of lengthy. I promise that it will be worth the read though because the next chapter is where things start to get INTERESTING :)
Cas knew what this gesture meant. Dean was separating himself from his touch, signifying that he didn't want this. Castiel came too late. His heart sank in his chest, but just before he was about to take a step back, Dean launched forward and connected his lips with Castiel's.
"Fuck... I know Cas... I know... I just needed a minute, okay! That was a lot to recall." Dean sat down and put his head in his hands.
On the one hand, if Cas choose to remain an angel, he would be stuck in this cave. But wouldn't the empty inevitably be able to find some way in? So picking that would still end in his downfall, wouldn't it? Maybe Chamuel had a backup plan to keep the Empty out, but how could he be sure of that?
"I just meant... I umm I just mean that I Ummm…." Cas stuttered, unable to form the words he needed to say here.
"What about Amara?.... Wait, are you jealous or something, Cas?" Dean said, not even attempting to hide the smirk in his voice.
Dean quickly put two and two together. "Are you kidding me" he exclaimed. "This dude is another angel. What is this a cult? Am I the only human being in this damn cave?"
"Jensen wasn't you, and I wasn't - I wasn't going to be intimate with someone... someone who wasn't the real thing..." Castiel muttered, looking down away from Dean's gaze again.
"Do you remember when I told you about the deal I made with the Empty? The one I made in order to save Jack?" Cas asked.
"Alright, the two main fears I have for the future is that I'll either lose you = and uh Sam of course as well, or that I will unintentionally let you both down... again."
Everyone followed his speech by clinking their glasses together, and Castiel tried to follow suit but ended up spilling his drink all over the table.
Dean stopped chewing the bacon still on his tongue and stared at Sammy with widening eyes. "... W- What?" He stuttered.
"No!" Dean pulled back from Castiels touch. "Look, I didn't want to say that much, but I had no control over it. I don't need your sympathy, so let's just move this thing along so I can have free will for a bit. Sound good? Great." Dean said not giving Castiel a chance to respond before picking up and reading the next card - "Is there anything about your life that you would change?"
'Brother??????" Dean thought. He was even more confused now than when he had first entered the room.
Dean lifted a hand to cover his mouth as he attempted to whisper to Castiel. "So is she more your style, Cas? Did you two do a little cloud seating together?" Dean snuck in a wink at the end.
"We were just in the neighborhood and decided to stop by and see how you boys were holding up." Jodi claimed, standing up to face Dean.
Dean scoffed. "Yeah, right! You wish!  And if you keep asking, I will go right back to ignoring your sorry ass."
Dean followed Castiel over to the card table, and soon enough, they were both seated across from one another once again. Despite Castiel's wings still shaking, they seemed to rest comfortably over the back of the chair, which made Dean wonder if Chamuel knew that Cas' wings might randomly appear or something. The height was a bit too perfect for it to be coincidental.
"Yes!" Castiel exclaimed, looking down at him. "God, yes! Please, Dean!" He begged and practically yelled out.
"Do you really wanna be on my list too, Gabriel? Cause I swear, one more word out of that oddly shaped mouth of yours, and I swear to god I'll kick your ass!"
Dean began to laugh so hard that his stomach started to hurt. He hadn't laughed this hard since he took Cas to a brothel all those years ago. He actually had to lean over to regain his composure.
Plus, Cas didn't want to disturb him, Dean was always an angry sleeper, so it was best for Cas to just admire the sleeping hunter from afar and wait for him to wake up on his own time.
"Ok, come on, Tweedle Dea and Tweedle Dean, let's get started on research while we let thing one and thing two go back to sleep for a bit. I imagine they are both pretty exhausted after performing such an intense spell." Samantha said as she ushered the other five adults out of Jack's bedroom.
"Woahhhhh Woah Woah there, buddy, you are giving me far too much credit. I just spectated it all, and any comment I made in your head was based solely on what your subconscious had already shown me! Everything here has been all you! I just gave you an encouraging push!" Gabriel replied.
Castiel smiled, blush still covering his entire face. "Dean...Are you saying what I think you are saying?" The angel smirked, which made Dean's heart skip a beat.
Once inside, the door slammed shut behind them, but it was only to be expected after this many rooms.
"Well, in your defense, you really didn't admit much of anything besides the fact that you made a deal with the empty to save Jack. If you want to admit more, then go the hell ahead."
"Hmmm, I see. Well, I believe that in this round, the questions will require some visual guidance. So I hope you use it while you still can. Once the round of questions ends, the powers that the pills gave you will be withdrawn. So make use of them while you are still enrolled in our program."
Samantha said, crossing her arms. "Well, I'm sorry, but when you wake up with a strange man beside you in bed, and another man suddenly locks himself in your room less than a minute later, you have to have priorities, Dea!"
"Wait, rip? You mean like when Jack was born and opened up that portal to that war apocalypse world?" Sam asked.
Castiel looked back at him at first with concern before reaching his hand out to wipe a few tears from Dean's cheek. After which, Castiel smiled up at him. "I told you before... Good things do happen, Dean."
"Well yeah...  I guess you have. None of us ever thought you would find someone actually to tolerate you forever, but hey, stranger things have happened."
"Well, I mean, it's purely an idiotic concept. You would never need an umbrella inside because unless you have a leak in the roof, it would never rain inside. If someone opens an umbrella indoors, they must have a lower I.Q. And those with a lower I.Q. tend to take more unnecessary risks than those who are smart enough to see how pointless opening an umbrella indoors is. Therefore, they would be unluckier in the long run due to their poor decision-making.
Theo was shocked. He had never been so disrespected by a human before, but he knew Dean wasn't wrong. Even though Theo wanted to smite Dean on sight, he knew Chamuel wouldn't approve of him doing so, so he decided to drop the topic and answer Dean's question.
"We should probably go ahead and get started on the research. Who knows how long it will take us to find a counterspell." Sami suggested.
Castiel sat on Dean's lap, kissing him anxiously like he was the only lifeline left in this corroding world. Dean kissed him back just as willingly. They both knew what they want. The only question in their minds was if the other truly wanted the same thing. But it had to stay that way. If they wanted to be with each other, neither could know the truth about how the other person felt.
Finally, he gave up on thinking or speaking or any of that elementary school shit, and he walked over to room 4.
Fake Gabriel started chanting "Speech! Speech! Speech!" repeatedly until Fake Chuck joined in. Before Castiel knew it, everyone was chanting along with the two men.
"Jensen! Misha! Hey, it took y'all long enough. Where did you go, Mish? I spent like 15 minutes looking around for you before I gave up." Fake Sam said.
"So then...Chamuel was just a backup? She was locked away the majority of her life just in case yall fucked up somehow?"
Castiel's eyes widened in shock as the scene around them faded out of view. "You... you weren't lying..." He muttered. His wings were fluffed up and shaking in anticipation.
"I didn't think they matched up, but you and Ben were just so similar, and after you left, I wanted to be sure since it all happened the same year. Trust me; I didn't think it would turn out this way either."
"Aw sweety, you should know better than anyone else that hardly anything is actually what it appears to be."
"What am I not getting here?" Dean asked, alternating his eyes backs and forth between the two angels.
So, for four weeks, Dean spent his time gravitating between his bedroom and the kitchen. The only time he would ever leave the bunker was for beer runs.
"AT LEAST JUST SAY YOU'LL THINK ABOUT IT!" Sam yelled back before hearing the door to the bunker slam shut. "He'll think about it." Sam reassured himself while he picked up their two dishes from breakfast and placed them in the sink.  Once he finished tidying up the kitchen, he headed off to Dean's room to clean up whatever mess was made by the unnatural disaster that was his older brother.
As soon as Dean was teleported back into the bunker, the first thing he did was storm into the kitchen to look for the hardest liquor they had in stock. Thankfully the expensive whisky he kept hidden was still exactly where he left it last.
"I paired Castiel up with an honorable angel named Barbiel... Barbiel is known as the angel of October, so I found her and Castiel to be quite compatible with one another."
Chamuel looked genuinely shocked, but only for a split second, then her mannerism went back to her typical stoic one.
Dean dropped his hand to his side and sighed dramatically. "Right now, I really resent ever being related to you!"
Dean still had an hour to spare before he would need to get the suits from the front desk. So he crawled back into bed and set the bedside alarm to wake him up at 9:00.
"First off, don't talk about me like I am property to be claimed. I am not a prize to be won or sold or anything. I am my own man, and that's that. I am not a fire hydrant that you can just pee on and call your own. Secondly, your hand mark went away a while ago anyway, so what does it matter if a new mark linked me to someone else."
Chamuel sighed before continuing again. "As I was saying... Castiel's change of choice was highly influenced by you, Dean. It wouldn't be ethical for me to let him change his mind because of another person's ideology. The good news is that I will allow Castiel to reevaluate his original decision in three months. But until then, you both will have to wait."
"You don't look alright man, what happened to you in there?" Dean's gaze turned towards Castiel's door.
"Well...If you want to talk about it later, I'll leave my hotel room unlocked for you. Room 717. Remember that number, and maybe we can do a bit more than just talking."  Jensen whispered into Castiel's ear before taking a step back and winking at Castiel. He then turned around and headed towards the bar, leaving Castiel standing there.
Dean looked back to Cas, not really understanding why the angel seemed overjoyed at his approval. "I mean, yeah, it's always a good day when I escape certain death, and you know - Amara also brought Mom back, which was something I never thought would happen. So it was two major wins in less than a few hours! You?"
"This honesty spell is trippy, dude. I can't control my tongue, but yes, I did hear you, and sadly you are spot on, but please read the next card before this turns into a sappy moment where I am forced to discuss each of my faults with you... I am sure these cards will make me do that or worse later on. So let's just put this thing in drive and go!" Dean replied hastily. His hands fighting nervously in his lap.
"OH THANK GOD-You're finally awake!" Dean exclaimed as he hesitantly removed his tight grip from Castiels shoulders and leaned back. He let out a brief sigh of relief.
"I assume it's because 7 is a prime number, and prime numbers can be intimidating. Also, you have gone through a lot of trauma in your life, so narrowing them down would be somewhat difficult, to say the least. So 7 is already limiting you a bit. You do have a lot of baggage!"
"How angels work, I guess hell I don't know, man. It's also hard to believe that you only kissed 4 people in your entire eternity of existence."
Castiel figured that he would rather not know because it could go one of two ways if he did know. But, unfortunately, both ways ended badly for him. The first option was that Dean did not feel the same way about Castiel, and thus, confronting it head-on would only bring him heartbreak and pain. The second option was that Dean did feel the same way about him, which would bring him true happiness. And if he became truly happy, then he would soon become truly dead since he had made that deal with the Empty.
In fact, his calendar check got so obsessive that Dean ended up removing the calendar/date from his iPhone.
"In all seriousness, Deany boy, for the rest of the program, you will be unable to lie or even give just partially true answers. For this to succeed, you need to be open and honest with Castiel and yourself. Understand?"
Dean had never allowed himself to admit that there had been times in his life where he had found a male to be sexually attractive. So having to admit that out loud, in front of his best friend and probably a gaggle of peeping angels, wasn't his ideal way of
"Yes, I do, in fact." Chamuel remained calm and didn't seem at all threatened by the angry hunter that stood in front of her. "Have you heard of play therapy? It is typically a therapeutic method used with children who cannot yet verbalize their internal emotions. Long explanation short, I have developed my own type of play therapy for adults in order to help them resolve their conflicts and other types of emotional disputes. So, when I am summoned for a worthy cause, I put together an array of trials and games to solve whatever the underlying issue is."
"I'll see you tonight!" Cas said before running down the hall to catch up with his alternate universe version of his brother.
Cas moaned loudly at the sensation of Dean's flush grinding against his thigh. To see the hunter so needy under his own hands made his cock perk up in interest.
Dean swallowed nervously, suddenly overcome with emotion and nostalgia. "Well... either way, the main point is you were a major part in me and Sammy's epic supernatural journey, and because of that, you deserve a place front and center of my hypothetical memoir that, as I told you before, will never actually exist."
"Oh, can you now? Care to give an example?" Projection Dean asked, leaning in slightly closer to the other man.
Dean ignored Castiels question and instead asked him one. "Do you remember how at the beginning of all this, I asked you to keep what happens here between us?"
love to know." Dean gave extra emphasis to the word 'honestly' and grinned as he watched Castiels reaction.
"There was umm... there was a wedding!" Castiel mumbled. He wanted to be honest with Dean, but human honesty didn't mean revealing all the details. So Cas went with the bare minimum.
"Do you think that if I knew jack was capable of such a thing that I would have kept it from you? Yes, I saw him acting strange. I witnessed him turn a snake into ashes. It wasn't done maliciously; it was cold. Jack saw what he considered to be a problem, and he fixed it. But I had no idea that his weird behavior would lead to any of this."
"You just got back." Sam stated. "So, don't you think we should talk about what you experienced in Chamuel's relationship rehabilitation program?... Also, speaking of, where's Cas?" He asked.
"You don't even know which event I am about to show you, especially considering the bunker always looks like this." Cas opened his arms to gesture at the room around them.
"So you, Donna, and Garth just happened to all drop by at the same exact fucking time?" Dean asked, did they really think he was that oblivious. He knew an intervention when he saw one.
"Thank you, Dean! To be perfectly honest with you, I had hoped that Castiel would decide to return home with you... but despite my hopes, that wasn't the option he picked. In this profession, I have to respect whatever an individual decides... Castiel didn't discuss his decision with you, and I never gave him that requirement. Nonetheless, he made his choice without discussing his options with anyone." Chamuel explained.
"Well... I may be... at the very least.... partially responsible for you being here." Sam mumbled, shifting his left foot across the floor while looking down. He reminded Dean of a child who just got caught stealing a cookie from the cookie jar.
Cassie was rereading the parenting books in her and Castiel's room to find a solution to help Jane feel less lonely when they got back to their own world.
"I am not sure how long it will take for the flames to engulf my jacket, so you need to move fast. You ready?" Dean asked.
The scene around them didn't shift once Cas closed his eyes. Which only meant that this one took place in the bunker too. The main difference now was Jack was sitting at one of the tables.
"I figured." Dean stated, removing his hand from his face. "What's the difference? If we lose, we swim with sharks or some shit like that? Will Cas turn blue? OR will I lose my voice completely?"
Cas nodded. He knew he needed to tell Dean, but this moment was far too perfect to ruin, and Castiel knew that bringing up his previous choice would definitely ruin the moment.
Cas nodded. "After I had noticed that Jack was acting odd like I said earlier, I have been keeping closer tabs on him!"
"Ughhh, I don't know, man... it's just... god... I hate this. Chamuel must have some sort of vendetta out against me or some shit. Also, why the hell do I have to show 7? That's an extremely specific number."
Dean looked at him with an emotionless expression. "Well, maybe he shouldn't." Dean responded, using all his strength to push past Garth and go find Sam.
"Well, you know those awesome movies I sometimes force you to watch with me when we aren't on a case or when we get bored in the bunker?"
"Well, did you tell him he could place his army of rubber ducks in the water beforehand like we told you to do before we left this morning?" Projection Dean asked, sounding more annoyed by the second.
Castiel leaned closer to Dean to reach out and grab the suitcase handle so that he could roll it over to the elevator. Dean blushed a bit from being so close to Castiel. Sure they had been close before, Chamuel had practically forced him to make out with Cas in the cave, but this Cas was different, which made this situation so much more nerve-wracking.
"… Sam, I think that your hair grew so long that the weight is messing with your brain activity! How the hell would that be possible anyway?"
"Oh, my hero..." Dean muttered sarcastically as Castiel walked up behind Dean again. This time however he was dressed, ready to conquer the day. He had his outfit for later packed in a small bag that was over his shoulder.
However, the only sound he could hear was the air blowing conditioning out of the vents around the bunker. In other words, the bunker was eerily quiet.
"Theliel... Theliel is the angel prince of love, or at least that was his role in heaven. He was the commanding officer of all the cupids, and he forced other angels into arranged pairings if they could not find a mate on their own." Castiel said.
Castiel just rolled his eyes. His wings were once again folded up behind his back. "Let's just move on to your experience so you can 'prove me wrong' apparently." Cas said using air quotes for at least the second time in less than 20 minutes.
