“I'm so sorry,” I replied, apologetic.  I crossed to our bay window, where the daylight was trying its best upon this dreary, cloudy day in dark December.  I slid a thumbnail underneath the flap and, probing, withdrew the content.  By this point, Holmes had followed me and was standing at my back with his sharp chin upon my shoulder – an odd behaviour which this past year I had grown used to – to the best of my ability.  The card depicted a merry winter scene, snow-laden countryside, a frozen pond and skaters, and small dogs yapping on the bank.  At the crown of this picturesque view came the greeting:
Holmes took it, read it over.  His expression changed but slightly.  He looked up to me, to Victor, then to the ceiling.
He joined me, having first scanned all about him, fearing other hikers in the vicinity, I supposed.  But there were none; we were alone here for the moment.  I felt his arm around my waist, his other hand ruffling my hair, tugging just lightly.  He lowered his mouth to mine; we kissed.
.”  And he nodded, quite beyond himself; a wanton idol still yet clinging to the pedestal I'd placed him on.  And fingers now, first one, then two, a gentle breach and pistoning, and driving him to rattling the window with his craving.  He came, then, shuddering; clenching around me, head thrown back, shouting my name.  And I was with him, with my free hand fast around my own stiff member, with no control, just both in glory, making a dreadful row, and coming down but slowly, oh, so gradually.
I saw the corners of his mouth twitch, and his hands begin to recommence their flutter from the safety of their pockets.  “Yes,” he said.  “I think I am.”
“It is just how he is,” I whispered.  “Do not fret yourself about it.  Holmes will reveal all when he is ready.”
I thought of all the times that we had walked here, passed this very spot in companionable silence or happy, disputatious talk.  I remembered all our favoured routes, the stalls that we might stop by and the vendors we might greet.  These all were precious memories to me; I hoped that Holmes might think so too, if he should think of them at all.
Holmes waved a hand to brush the awkward question far away from him.  “I didn't hear a smash,” he said.  “I was in the middle of a
“A rendezvous, just prior to the lady's demise, which may or may not be related.  And these cigarette stubs.  Are they of true importance?”
it's very cold.”  I returned to the fire and a glass of fine brandy, and smoked a cigar while my friend sat in thought.  “Do you miss Baker Street?”
“How very strange,” I said.  I turned to Holmes, whose face had pulled an odd expression.  “What are you thinking of?” I asked.
I held him fast, this six-foot vulture, claws and wings and beak and all.  I stroked his hair.  “Stop complaining.  Twist yourself a little just this way... yes, that's much better.”
“Wait here,” he said.  He disappeared, but presently returned.  “All right.”  He took his seat.  “I had a letter from old Stamford, do you know, before you came back with your silly note.”
We stood there, kissing, as young lovers, in the middle of the room.  The neither of us wished to leave our nest, it seemed, and yet it should be soon.  At length we separated, took up our hats and bags and, stepping out, clicked soft shut the Blue Room door behind us both.
come with me on these jaunts.  You would be in your true element.”  He winked.  “And you'd be useful.”
Victor was still obediently sat by the window as we traipsed to the gate a full half-an-hour later.  He met us at the door, with his expression telling us all we wished to know.
It was a Thursday morning in late spring, and the sunshine, startled and drowsy from its full eight months of slumber, set to splay upon our sitting-room at 221B Baker Street.  The warmth was pleasant, and we sat, my friend and I, at the small table on which our breakfast had been laid, and eaten, and set aside.  I turned the pages of
Dissatisfied, at least, until the telegram.  It was from Mr. Sherlock Holmes, inviting me to 221B Baker Street, pertaining to the murder of the Hon. Cole Ramsey.
“I do want to do this, you know,” said my friend, a mind-reader as always.  He squirmed, and placed a kiss to my temple.  “I never thought I would tire of London,” he mused.  “I feel quite choked by it now.  It is time.”
“If you are resolute on poisoning us, then I admire the stalwart effort,” said Holmes.  He leaned forward in his chair.  “What is this all about, Pike?  I am referring to the
I followed Holmes into the passage.  It was narrow, dark, and smelled of damp neglect.  It carried on for some small way in a straight fashion, then curved around and on again to a dead end.  Holmes pushed a lever, and a further door appeared.  He disappeared through this.  I craned my neck and hovered, undecided, on the threshold, peering in.  It was a small room, sparsely furnished with a sofa, chair, and desk.  There were some books piled on the floor, a tattered rug, a stack of unused cups and plates.  Set high upon one wall was a small window, dirty, curtainless, through which an errant sunbeam struggled through.  The room was thick with dust; it agitated in the air with Holmes's movements, as he turned around towards me.
“I do not like Pike,” I said then, my thoughts in a jitter and northbound from Surrey.  “I do not care for any man who would take pleasure in others' trouble.”
I leaned to capture him, to cup his chin, to kiss his luscious mouth.  “I love you as I've never loved before.”  A cliché?  Never mind.  I held him to me, and he nestled close.  We watched the specks of dust float in the air for senseless minutes, endless time.  We left the secret room on tip-toe, closed the doors, fastened the catches, to the study, and the hall again.  Wouldn't you know it, Mycroft Holmes was there, just exiting the library.
“We are quite settled in that way,” I said.  “We have a lady by the name of Martha Oaks, who lives nearby and helps us out.”
All we could do then was wait.  It was unlikely we would hear anything before the evening or the next morning.  A simple meal of cold meat, bread and pickles had been laid out upon the dining table.  We sat and piled our plates and poured cold beer from a carafe. Our talk remained subdued, each of us lost in our own thoughts.  I was barely listening when Gregson, tongue broadly loosened by the beer, commenced to spread gossip of the Yard.  At the first mention of '...
“How generous,” said my friend in an even tone.  “We should be interested in a short appointment with this remarkable object.  Might you tell us the fee?”
“Holmes,” I said, amused and quite delighted, “I have a card!”  I paused a moment to reflect.  “I don't usually receive cards.”  I scooped up the envelope to examine it, frowning at the script.  “I don't recognise the writing.”
Our friend cast a pair of anxious eyes to me, then to the window, to the outside and the lawn and back again.
In the sitting-room, we watched a game of Bridge play to its end.  (Mycroft was marvellously talented at cards, I had discovered.)  We drank some brandy, just a little.  I think we both were rather putting off what was to come, but in the end, Holmes yawned, peered at his watch.  “And that's me done,” said he.  He bid us all good night.  It broke the dam; most of the guests now trickled off to their own rooms, and I was not among the last of them.  A scant five minutes later, I had joined Holmes in our room, where he was sitting on the bed, smoking a cigarette.
I had him hoiked and down upon it in an instant, and it was as if there were no interval at all, between the evening and the morning, for we were kissing quite as deeply, and my hands were in his hair, and Holmes's own were at my hip.  I lay on top of him, his legs apart and raised.
“Good god.”  I reached a hand to stroke his cheek; he nestled into the soft touch.  “I've never felt this way before.”
The sun was poking through the clouds as we spilled out onto the street.  We strolled a little distance, arm in arm, and it seemed that gradually my friend recovered his good humour.  I had feared his altercation might have set him in the dumps, for it seemed somewhat unlikely that Lestrade should now see fit to bestow us with anything of interest for the next month.  Yet our conversation soon turned towards the theatre, and with plans to dine at Simpson's, and soon we were both smiling with little thought to spare for taciturn Inspectors with their paper piles and chaos.
“No, but she may as well have done.  What is the difference, whether we bleed on the outside or the inside, my friend, eh?  Watson, didn't you hear
I rubbed at my nose.  “You must give the poor woman a chance,” I replied.  “It could be she is nervous.  As for 'nips and tatties', she must mean 'turnips and potatoes'.”
.  So I'm glad that you have risen from your death bed.  We must do something nice to celebrate.”  He tapped the stem of his black clay against his temple in deep thought.  “Let's go to dinner, then, tonight.  My treat.  Have you
“John, you surely know me well enough to realise that I never guess; it is a shocking habit.  Where are these facts that point to murder?  You must see that there are none.  Let us go over what we have learned from Victor's letter, then, at least.
“I declare that you just provided me with the most exquisite imitation of a sucker-fish,” Holmes declared.  “I trust you enjoyed it?”
There was a loud clang from the kitchen, as that of a saucepan descending to tile.  A muffled screech, a stifled oath, a pause, the sound of running water.
Holmes raised his chin and smiled most curiously.  “It's hard to say,” said he.  “I think I'm still acclimatising.  Ask me again this time next week.”
is why I brought you here.  For privacy.”  His hands roved down to clamp my backside once again.  I groaned.  He squeezed.  I yelped.
“Oh!” I was delighted.  “Oh, Holmes, that will be marvellous.  Are you sure that you can manage?  Do you have everything you need?”
“You are happy that I am wrapping a brooch for Mrs. Hudson's birthday?”  Sometimes I could scarce believe or understand the logic of the man.
Breakfast on Sunday was spent alone, for Holmes was still abed despite the lateness of the hour.  I had consumed three cups of coffee and two generous helpings of ham and eggs before his bedroom door drew open.  My friend appeared surprised to see me, for some reason, for he started, before moving to the mantel to collect the plugs and dottles for his first pipe of the day.
“Your ideas of fun are questionable, Pike,” I said, my temper boiling.  “What's your true motive behind this?”
The fellow thanked us, shook our hands, and shuffled out.  Holmes closed the door and turned to look at me.
“Brr,” said my friend, rubbing his hands in a pique.  “I should have thought we had seen the last of this, Watson.”
And he stood, still holding on, 'til we were near to eye-to-eye.  As near to it as I may ever be.  For I am five inches shorter at the least.
.”  He jerked his head around in agitation, as if in fear that we might yet be overheard.  But our small patch of grass was quiet and isolated; we were safe.  He inhaled deeply.  Then: “I like you,” he said, frowning.
“THIS CURL,” he boomed.  His eyes narrowed.  “It just appeared,” he explained.  “When you ruffled your hair.”
But then – a darting movement from the other side; a figure gliding rapidly towards him.  It was Miss Cooper, dressed in purple, with a bustle that might have harboured a small child had she so wished it.  She came to rest in front of Holmes; they exchanged words.  I heard her laugh: a shrill cacophony, much as a laying hen might make, or worse.  I watched them stroll away, her arm in his.  I felt a pang of jealousy so sharp and bitter that it pooled upon my tongue.  I stood there, numb, behind my tree, and remained so for minutes more until I spurred myself to move, retrace my steps onto the lawn.
“Victor, don't be noisy.  I am still collecting data.  Data, data, data,” he continued, in a sing-song fashion that was almost to himself.  “Please be patient, my dear fellow.  You may pull the curtains if you so wish.  Now, then, shall we turn our thoughts towards something a fraction more diverting?  I propose a visit to that inn with the ludicrous name, to sample their ale and most excellent pies.  I fancy that an evening in convivial surroundings would do us all the power of good.”
“I used to come here as a child,” said he, “to hide.  Mycroft's forgotten all about it, I shouldn't wonder.”  He swiped a finger through some dust.  “I liked this room.  It was so quiet.  I could sit in here and think.”
I improvised.  I have no recollection of the words I may have said, if they bore any faint resemblance to my original care-wrought speech, but at any rate, I improvised.  I may have babbled.  I do recall that both my palms were clammy, and my eyes rolled in their sockets.  I accepted my award at last, and bolted to my seat.
Holmes groaned and shook his head and clapped his hands against his ears.  “La-la-la-la-la, can't hear you, la-la-la-la-la,” he piped.
Spencer lived a carriage ride away.  It took us thirty minutes to arrive in Pinchin Road and to locate the number eight.  A modest little house it was, squeezed tight between two others as if it had no room to breathe.  We stood beside a lamp post, watched the stream of passers-by.  I had no idea of my friend's intent; if he should knock upon the door or merely stand by as a sentry.  I was nervous, I'll admit it, and I cursed myself for being so.
“Then why, in the name of heaven, did you say... oh, never mind.”  I wiped my hand across my forehead.  “Why did you ruin the door lock with acid?”
“I lost my key and I couldn't get out.  It didn't work, by the way, so I can't see how Mrs. Hudson can tell me it's ruined.”  Holmes smirked.  “I know what you're going to say, Watson.  And yes, I could have used my lockpicks.  I absolutely could have.  The thing is, my dear fellow, --”
, the respected volume written and published in 1882 by Dr. Algernon Flyte, once more lay displaced from the bookshelf.
Holmes raised himself upon one elbow.  “Well, I'm glad too.”  He touched my face.  “To think, I might have lived my whole life through without knowing this.”
“Watson, I would not become over-excited,” said Holmes, stooping closer to look all the same.  “This is, after all, an antiques shop.  Items are put up for sale and then sold.  Such a knife, had it been used, given its age would have left a debris in the wounds that Scotland Yard could not have missed.”
I looked at him, into that pale, clear face, and I sensed light, if light were dawning, and the terror of it struck me like a blade.  “You would not want to know,” I said.
He shook his head, but smiling now.  “Another time, perhaps.”  He rose and tidied up his paperwork, returned the volumes to the shelf.  When all was clear, he nodded briefly and, without a further word, walked to his bedroom door and disappeared within.
And gradually, my guilty feelings – and the other – relaxed and lessened, and my thoughts turned to tomorrow, optimistic for results.
“I am recovered, yes,” said he, in a soft Spanish lilt.  “But as I am sure you must appreciate, your news came as a terrible shock.  Mr. Holmes, I swear to you now that I did not harm my mot--” (and here he stopped himself and winced and then continued) “-- my mother,” he determined, a little proudly but with a little guilt between.  “My
“Oh, for goodness sake,” said Holmes.  “Those bloody paper-thin walls.  Shut up, Gregson, you imbecile.”
Two minutes, more, ticked by, and then, the door swung halfway open.  Holmes emerged.  His expression was undefinable.  A trifle horror-struck, perhaps, with a soupçon of fevered delight.
“Please, Mr. Bruce, you must not blame yourself,” said Victor Burroughs.  He rose from his chair and walked across to his wretched cousin.  “My aunt was not in the best of health.  It could have happened at any time.”
Gregson chuckled.  “You would make a terrible liar, Dr. Watson,” said he.  “I checked those drawers the very first thing this morning.  They contained no address book then.”  He moved closer towards me.  “Did you remove the book yesterday?  Take it away from the premises?”
Holmes passed a thoughtful moment casting complaint in sotto voce.  His face took on an impish look; he seemed intent on making mischief.
We turned onto our sides, facing each other.  Holmes's eyes were warm and gentle, scrutinising.  I closed my own, and breathed him in.  The scent of soap, still, and cologne.  I filled my lungs with him; imagined he was in my arms and wanting.  I felt a touch upon my cheek; opened my eyes to find his hand there, softly stroking with his thumb.  My own laid anchor on his hip; I felt the jut of bone, the leanness through the cloth.  We inched together, 'til our noses were just touching.
Sherlock Holmes yawned widely, stretching supine on the bed.  Quite naked, still, from our endeavours of the previous half-hour.  I cast a warm eye across his frame, relaxed and softening in lambency.
Holmes lay there, still and quiet, his grey eyes blinking, and it took all of my strength to step away, to draw a breath, to take a suck upon my pipe.  I heard him shuffle to his feet and step a small distance away.  “You'd better leave,” he said.
“I don't believe she was aware that it had vanished,” I said.  “She seemed very distraught.  Well, Holmes, what do we do now?”
Holmes stooped beside the blood stains on the floor where the body had lain.  He examined the marks intently and then rose and moved across to the sash window, whereupon he thrust his head out and slowly turned it in all directions.  I joined him there, and peeped out below.
I stared at him, horrified.  “I have absolutely no intention of drugging our landlady,” I said.  “Whatever is wrong with you?”
“You're very kind, Holmes.  Merry Christmas!” was quite enough.  My secret stayed with me.  My secret, filled with sentimental bits.
”  His tone was strident, aggravated.  “Watson, you're madder than a hare.  I am doing no such thing.”  He wagged a finger in my face.  “That is what happens when you
,” said Holmes.  “No, thank you.  If I might have a scotch whisky, please.  John will have one too.  Victor, have you heard anything at all from the Coroner's office?  I have no wish to distress you, but I really must know what we are dealing with here.”
I felt down to the marrow that somewhere here there lay a greater unsolved mystery, but I had to acquiesce.  We tramped back home and lit the fires, and cobbled up a meal together that if not quite a gourmet dish was at the least, quite fairly edible.
“Do stop saying that.  It's tiresome.”  He sighed.  “I've known Miss Alice since my childhood.  She was seeking my advice on some small matter, that is all.”  Holmes lit a cigarette, and offered me the case.  “So, then, you want to prig.”  Tilting his head, he blew a coiling wreath of smoke.  He raised an eyebrow.
“Very well explained, Watson,” said Holmes dryly, with a roll of his eyes.  “I shall certainly know what to buy you for Christmas.”  He sat in his chair and set his chin in his hand.  “The housekeeper provided me with a detailed description of the skull.  It is a red jasper, of course, as we both know.  It also happens to have a large 'vug' at the back, and an agate inclusion in the forehead.  The poor woman had to dust it quite often enough to remember its characteristics.  You don't know what a vug is?  Well, look it up.  Dawkins, Dawkins, Dawkins...  Ah!  Watson!  I think that I have it!”
We passed a quiet evening and enjoyed a sound night's sleep.  Or – at least – we slept.  For I had dreamed, and tossed and turned, as the strange forms filled my sub-conscious.  My nightmare compelled the former PC Spencer through the foggy London streets.
Thursday was the sunnier by far.  I rose quite earlier than usual, took my breakfast, and descended to my office before eight o'clock.  Whistling, I stacked my books and papers, straightened up my chairs and tables, and so prepared the day ahead of me.  Presently, I heard Miss Marsh within the other room, and then there she was, to say
“You've changed your tune all of a sudden,” he remarked.  “For god's sake, man, stop jittering, and sit.”
“I have heard a little, but the results are not conclusive.  The Coroner seems not to suspect any foul play.  There are one or two tests they have yet to perform.  How slow it all is!  They insinuate that it was due to a weakened heart.  But, oh, Mr. Holmes, the
,” became two hours at the least.  The afternoon drew to a close; I washed, and changed my clothes for dinner.  I was fiddling with cufflinks when Sherlock Holmes entered the room.
, a rash desire, or what you will.  God, how I wanted him!  I regarded my reflection in the mirror, my pale and anxious face, and wondered what the merry hell I might or should not do.
“What a to-do, then, eh?  But my Victor's a brave lad, he's doing well.  And he tells me that you think it a great mystery, Mr. Holmes!  Well, the best of luck with that.  I don't see anything so odd.”
“Oh, by a woman.  'Her' name is Marybelle LaRoux.”  Holmes laughed again.  “If Mycroft knew that I had found them, and had read them all, I don't know what he'd do.”
Shoulder to shoulder, as we were, felt oddly intimate.  The corner of my eye sought out his profile, any inch of him I could.  I watched his hands, those long cool fingers, as they moved gently to the music, and I felt him shift and shuffle in his seat during the rousing bars that Wagner, I was finding, was inordinately fond of.  And so the evening passed this way, with my attention quite divided – but the happiness I felt could scarce be matched.  Some hours later, we rolled out into the night, the concert over, but with what catalyst to come?
Holmes nodded solemnly.  “On Thursday.  I was threatened with a black eye and a broken nose.  He may not be aware, though, that I am a clever boxer who could fell him without taking half a breath.  It didn't come to that,” he added, “he scuttled off before I had a chance to tell him so.”
And still he sleeps (it is a miracle), and I cannot find the heart that would disturb him, for the day that is to come may be a long one.  So I settle for a spot that is as close as I might dare, and then I listen to the clock-tick and I watch the second hand.
Holmes pulled my arm in the direction of the dining room.  The other pairs were drifting off towards the drawing room and gardens.  We came up trumps, with three small eggs for our straw basket, hidden cleverly in lampshade, drawer, and soup tureen.
“Meanwhile, Stone wrote the note, pretending it from Barker, and packed the skull to deliver it to Dawkins' Curiosity Bizarre.  He made no mention of this to Barker in her revised hypnotic state.  Perhaps he did not think it of importance.  The result of this, of course, was that Mrs. Barker appeared forgetful and defensive and unsure, and so incriminating herself.”
“Holmes,” I began, but he had skittered to the dresser and was picking out a tie.  Ignoring me!  Oh, two could play at that game.
It seemed as an eternity.  I confess I fell asleep, and awoke some one hour, two hours later, with the room now bathed in gloom, the merest sliver of a lamp light shining through from Holmes's room.  I heaved myself up from my chair and set to making light within the sitting-room.
,” I replied.  We set to chuckling again.  “I wouldn't care a jot if I never set eyes on him again – and yet I must do so tomorrow.  Pray for me, Stamford.”
How many similar wounds had I attended to, these past four years?  Stitches sewn and cuts wiped clean and neatly bandaged.  My friend held scant regard for his own safety or wellbeing, and this gave me cause to fret rather more often than I liked.
“Whatever for?” my friend enquired, allowing me to drag him nonetheless.  We tilted down the single path, so steep and narrow, to the beach.  The man was throwing driftwood for his pet to chase.  We watched them for a minute.  I felt all of a sudden that I should rather like a dog.  I was about to voice this thought to Holmes, when the fellow turned and waved to us.
The phials were dry and empty; the syringe bare of its needle.  I drew a large sigh of relief.  I closed the case and replaced it inside the drawer.  I looked around me.  Sitting on the bed, my eyes alighted on the shirt bunched in a ball.
“All of a high denomination,” said he.  “Aunt Augusta clearly held little respect for the humble street bank.  John, there are a great many thousands of pounds here.”
, from what I have read--” (and here again my friend snorted) “-- a crystal that is carved into the image of a skull carries more, er, power, shall we say, than its uncarved counterpart.  Er...”
“I like a man who is prepared,” I said.  I paused to add a little to my fingers.  I leaned over, kissed his mouth, caressed his flesh; became distracted by his succulence.  At length, we separated.  I rolled off the bed.  I stripped, without self-consciousness.  Holmes watched me with avidity.  As I removed my underwear, his eyes popped in his head.
He took me by the arm, and together we strolled the London streets as two old friends might do, who have no special place to be, nor any hurry to arrive there.
“It's best you speak to Sherlock Holmes about him, then,” replied Lestrade.  “If he won't tell you, then it's hardly my right place to sit here gossiping.”
We shook hands firmly, and he flitted off.  I took the other path and hailed a hansom, and so travelled back to Scotland Yard to finish up my day.  I thought of Holmes all of the way: the arch savant; the vain aesthete.  I hoped and prayed that he would contact me as promised, for I realised in my eagerness I'd not procured his own address – and how to do so, now, without suspicion?
Rarely had I ventured this invasion of my friend's privacy.  But in this case, I felt it purely justifiable – for I could not bear to think of him distressed, reliant on the needle.  A dress shirt was lying on the floor, discarded.  I went to his bedside cabinet and, hesitantly now, opened the drawer.  A small bottle of some headache cure; a snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid; a handkerchief; a signet ring.  And there, close to the back and tucked away, the accursed case.  I removed it from its confines, undid the catch, and...
, I'm physically attracted to you, Holmes, do you expect me to deny it?  Do you think so little of me that you'd assume I'd merely class you a
“They want me to give an acceptance speech,” I said.  “I had better start work on it after breakfast.  There will be hundreds in attendance at the ceremony.”
Lestrade,” said he.  “Oh, for goodness sake, everywhere I turn there's another idiot.  Go away, Gregson.”
(The previous week, when in pursuit of a low ruffian close by the Thames, my friend had gashed his leg upon a razor-shard of metal halfway protruding from a dockside wall.  Upon reaching home at last (the criminal safely apprehended) and with my having cleaned the wound, I found it needing ten neat stitches, which I performed while he complained at volume and hissed between his teeth.)
Mr. Sloan took a deep breath and then exhaled.  He examined his umbrella, and gazed upon the trail of water that lay in wide concentric circles, so chronicling his tour about the room.
“We shall see Pike tomorrow,” said Holmes.  “But tonight, let us not dwell on the negative.  We shall dine at Marcini's and drink more than we ought.  And you will
Holmes nodded curtly.  “Yes, I think so.  Thank you,” he added.  “I hope to receive a reply to one or more of my telegrams.  There are other things besides.  It is too late to do anything now.”
I pushed him backwards to the sofa and, dust or no, I laid him down, and then I lowered myself slowly to the length of him.  I ground, experimentally.  He whined.  I ground a little more.  He muttered an expletive.
Holmes made no move towards the table, nor any further comment even; remaining curled upon his chair and sending intermittent puffs of thin grey smoke into the air.
“All right.”  Resigned.  I shrugged myself into my coat.  “Holmes, once I have... cleared things up... we'll meet again, and...?”
“I think I might, Holmes, if you wouldn't mind.”  I climbed the stairs, and there they were, unmoved from early morning.  I sat cross-legged at the first one, and set to leafing through the documents.  Old policies and statements, pinned invoices, remittance sheets.  “This is all dull,” I said.  “I can't see anything of import.”  And then I stopped.  And Holmes beside me stilled in accord.  I plucked a bundle from the middle of the box.
His mouth on mine, demanding, hot.  My arms around his back and holding on for my dear life, and pressed together as we were, sharing our halting breath, we lost all sense and courtesy.  He pushed me to the sofa, laid me down, and set to worshipping my neck with tongue and teeth.  I moaned, delirious, mussed his raven hair to madness, panting curses in his ear.  At length he raised his head: his face was flushed; his eyes an intense burnished silver that consumed me to the core.
“Good gracious, no.  Mr. Mycroft Holmes is far too occupied to grace us with his presence.  He has his staff to do all that, if necessary.  Oh-ho, you don't know much about him, then?  He's rising rapidly in government, quite powerful, considering his years.”  Lestrade looked closer at me then.  “Why do you ask?”
.  If she possessed a poor memory, then surely she would have had difficulty in recollecting with such precise detail the peculiarities of the skull.  Also, of where she was and what it was her intent to purchase when she last encountered her errant cousin, Eugene Dawkins.  Besides other things.  Her memory appears only to malfunction around the time of the murder.”
“I think too much, you know that,” said my friend, twisting his head around to peep and smile at me.  “I shouldn't want us to ever be parted.”
Wouldn't you know, but the next day my friend was called away to Cambridge on a case.  In rank dismay, I read the telegram in which Holmes indicated days, if not a week before he might return to London.  I stomped around the house at Upper Wimpole Street.  I did not want to be there, and if I did my best to hide that fact, I fear I did not do it very well.  Miss Marsh adopted an expression that was pained quite early on, and my housekeeper steered well clear of me.  I telegrammed to Holmes most every day, with declarations of an escalating fervour.  He was distant in return, which only anguished me the more.  On the sixth day, I got notice he'd be returning by the evening train, and heaven knows the other half of London must have heard my whoop of joy.
“But not a single thing?” he asked, in seeming hope that our landlady might remember a small sackful in the hallway, by some miracle.  His face was so downcast that I was much amused, and ducked behind my newspaper for fear that he should spot me and turn sullen.
I set down my paper and looked across at him.  “Stop it,” I said.  “Just stop with all this now.  I have a bottle of oil that will remove the paint from your hands.  Stop behaving like a child.  Mrs. Hudson does not smell like a turnip,” I added sharply.
I sat down next to him, and lit my pipe.  “You know, Holmes,” I said, “I am quite confident that you will be swamped with cards tomorrow.  You must give your friends the benefit of the doubt.”
The early summer of 1884 was – I declared to myself – quite too hot, and still only in June.  The London streets were scorching, steaming; the air hung sullenly in layers, so that the taller man might prosper rather better than the short with his ability to cast his head above the choking parapet.
I drew back slightly.  I allowed him time to breathe.  “You're sending out conflicting messages,” I said.
“You will be happy, right enough,” said she, her chin raised high, determined.  “It will be a lovely little home for you.  You will be taken care of.”
“My head is swimming,” he said, sweetly.  “From too much wine, and all the rest of it.  But I will tell you here and now, that I will win whatever hand you choose to play.”
“My goodness,” I said, “that feels so much better already.”  I beamed up at Curtin, my man with the scissors.  “So what news are you able to share with us, Mr. Curtin?  Has your wife managed to find any relief from her symptoms of palsy?”
“Well, very little,” he replied.  “Ramsey was the rummest sort.  I met him, once or twice, some time ago.  The type of fellow who attracts the foulest flies.  Always in some great fix or other, and entirely of his making.  If it's suicide, however, I'll be most surprised.”
I do,” said Mr. Holmes.  He seemed a little agitated.  “There is legwork, and there's chemistry,” (he cast a scowl in my direction) “and there's piecing clues together.  It's complicated,” he finished proudly.  “You really wouldn't understand.”
He eyed me warily.  “All right.”  He transferred clothes – the few he had – to the spare hangers.  I turned away towards the window while he changed his shirt and collar.
I am,” I said, still huffing, “in my wish to not cause harm to any animal, either direct or inadvertent.  It is for health reasons, also,” I added.  “Holmes, I am a doctor.  I have made a study of the benefits.  I may tell you, there are many.”
“How should I take you?” This concerned me still.  We frotted, and we mouthed each other's sweating skin, the salt, the bitter tang of it, and I had never known a more exquisite taste or blissful feeling.  Holmes flipped me over once again; he was now underneath.  He drew his legs against his chest.  “Like this,” he said.  “You'll take me just like this.”
I watched him as he walked away towards the Pinchin Road.  I took a table in the window of the Tabernacle Tea-Rooms, and made my order for a large pot of Earl Grey and a roast beef sandwich that I could not taste at all.
We sorted through the mail pile as we waited for the tea to brew.  There was a letter from our young friend, Jacob Jones.  He was excited to inform us that his dog Bess expected pups, and if we wanted, when the day came, would we care to take our pick?  Holmes grunted non-committally.  I resolved to twist his arm nearer the time, for I had long yearned for a pup of any breed to raise and train.
it all,” my friend exclaimed, catapulting off the seat, “I had forgotten all about it.  Where's the basket?  Oh Watson, really, we are doomed, I tell you,
He took my hand and led me to his bedroom door, which was ajar.  He pushed it open, stepped inside, and watched my face as I stood looking all around.  “I can't believe I'm here,” I said.  “I thought you'd keep me waiting until Christmas.”
“No,” said he, “it is more than that, and something unexpected.  Watson, you asked me a moment ago if I had reconsidered Talmadge's problem.”
He sat back in his chair and fixed me with a strange regard.  I wondered what he might be thinking, if it was not about the toast.  Holmes sipped his coffee and refused the ham and eggs.  After an interval, he rose up to light his pipe.  He stood there at the mantel, sucking in that noxious residue and appearing in a quandary.
“Oooh,” said the man.  “She's a deader, that one.”  He rocked back on his stool.  “As a dodo.  And such a pity.  What'll become of it now?  The gardener fellow, you say?  No idea, son.  No idea.  And what's that?  An old woman dressed all in black, with a hood?  Ha ha ha!  Are ye sure ye weren't dreamin'?  Never seen sight of her either.  Ah'm missin' out on the fun.”
“Yes, yes, I know,” I said, impatiently.  What the devil was the matter with the man?  I thrust the note into his hand.  “Here are some things that must be done to keep the lady comfortable.  She informs me that she has a friend – a Mrs. Turner, I believe? – but that friend is out of town and not returning 'til the weekend.  Therefore, she asks if you might be so kind?”
“As long as we are together, then the future will be heavenly,” I told him.  “But what a question.  Why did you ask it?”
We set back – the smallest fraction – to regard our hot, flushed faces, and we smiled as if it were the most amusing thing, to be this much affected by a kiss.
a tomb.”  He took a step towards me.  “John,” he said.  And then he paused.  “You will allow me...?”
Rose Lane was quaint and picturesque.  Tiny, stone-built cottages, with chimneys puffing whorls of smoke, and scents of fresh bread baking from the open kitchen windows.  Number-three's gate was wide open.  I stepped inside and looked around.  A pretty place to live, albeit needing some attention: the grass was overgrown; the wood sills crumbling and flaking.
“No, John, I could not have,” my friend replied in indignation.  He set down his Stradivarius rather more roughly than it deserved.  “I do not misread things.  I need to find out how many 'E. Bruces' are living in Surrey at the present time.  Hence the telegram I have to send,
He nodded.  “Yes.”  He pushed me gently on my back and sat astride me.  I looked up at him; his beauty held my breath.  I told him so.  He flushed and turned his head away.
We both were laughing then.  We straightened and we buttoned up reluctantly.  “I've wanted you so much,” I said.  “You've no idea.”
“Gregson,” I said, haltingly, “I am sorry for intruding.  I thought you were alone.”  I stopped.  The stranger stood before me was now eyeing me askance.
“Humpf,” I said.  “More is the pity.”  I filed my records and did a little paperwork.  The afternoon was stultifying.  By four o'clock I claimed defeat and retired upstairs to my rooms.  I washed and changed, and took an early evening meal at a small restaurant nearby.  I had made plans to meet up with an old friend for drinks, and therefore I made haste to not be late.  At half-past six I knocked upon his door, and found myself within his cosy sitting-room not many minutes later.
We had our interlude under the sun, and then we rose to have our picnic, before the ants could take the most of it.
It was not Mrs. Hudson who made the first rap.  In fact, there were no raps at all.  The first we came to know of it was the sudden, looming appearance of a broad-shouldered fellow, late middle-aged, with right hand on the door knob and the left clutched to his pate, as he stared around with wild eyes at the two of us.  His pepper-salted hair was distressed in a mad fury; his dark brown suit was several sizes too small and his boots were too large.  The round-rimmed spectacles he had clamped upon his face were crooked at a sharp angle.
Why in god's name had I sat down?!  I should have retired to my own bedroom, where I could take care of this wretched--
“I'm recently reformed,” I said.  I yanked him closer and we kissed a second time.  It was as heady as the first.
Mr. Holmes looked at my hand as if it were a rancid cod.  Rancid cod or no he shook it anyway, but dropped it promptly.  “Have you settled in?” he asked.  “And where is Sherlock, do you know?”
The question confused him.  He scratched at his head with his unfettered extremity.  “It doesn't hurt,” he said.  “It just felt bad.  That round white thing.”  The recollection made him shudder.
“Yes, you did,” said he.  I heard him move and rustle on the bed.  “That is my business, though, and little of your own.”
And he sat and smoked, and I unpacked our bags, and we looked forward to what must be later and the grand mystery in waiting.
The hallway ended in a door, which Mr. Holmes now briskly opened and went through.  I followed, meanwhile noting the quaint décor of the parlour: an older lady's sole abode, all lace and cushions, books, and sentimental gewgaws.  A smaller bedroom to one side, which I was chivvied through.
been done after the fact, then had the criminal scaled the pipe a second time, to regain entry to the study from outside?  But for what reason?
Holmes chuckled to himself.  I felt my cheeks flame red.  But then a greater sense of relief that the case had been concluded, the true criminal apprehended and all now well – except, of course, for the late lamented Jack Talmadge.
“You are not in any trouble,” my friend replied.  “We only wished to learn the cause, and now we know, and that's the end of it.”  He paused and looked to Victor in silent question.
I was about to turn, to leave again, when:  “Holmes,” I said – for it had slipped from my mind – “what of the case?”
“Oh,” said my friend.  He sounded thoughtful.  “The letters stop in 1882.”  He paused once more.  “Thank you.”
“Holmes,” I said, “I have been desperate.”  I dared not step into the room more than a fraction, so I hovered at the threshold, watching anxious for a sign.
“Yes.  Awful, terrible things.  Messages in my dreams.  Messages!  That something awful and very terrible is going to happen to me, Mr. Holmes!  And there was another one today, in my afternoon nap!  You have to help me.  I am out of my mind.”
“Mr. Holmes,” puffed Mrs. Hudson, as she pushed our door half open.  “Another visitor for you.  This gentleman is a Mr. Sloan.  He says it's most important.”
“Remove your clothes.  Over there so I can see,” I said, pointing to the amber of the lamp upon the table.
Mr. Sherlock Holmes was sitting at the table with the bottles and the acids, and he sprang up as we entered after knocking on the door.
“I do hope so,” I said, throwing him a look.  He caught it blinkingly, and nodded, before turning to the door and stepping out.  The door clicked shut.  I was alone again.
I took the jug and ventured downstairs to the kitchen, where to my pleasure I found the cook already preparing a large breakfast for us all.  Affable, she soon had me on my way with steaming water and the promise of a feast if we might descend in twenty minutes.
It was the Thursday morning, early.  And despite the looming inevitability of our meeting with the odious Pike, we were enjoying a generous breakfast of kippers and eggs – which danced an internal quadrille with the fresh seafood platter from the previous night.
“I promise, you will have your own set of hives one day,” I said.  “But I could hardly begin to imagine Mrs. Hudson's face if you set up in her yard.”
“Well, let's forget what I was going to say.  It doesn't matter now.”  He pushed the chair back, rose, and strode towards the door.  He turned to look at me.  “You'll never know, you bloody fool.”  He left.  The door yawned widely in his wake.  I stared long after him, expecting him to have a change of heart.
“Oh, yes, it had indeed.  My father was an archaeologist, you know.  He found it on a dig in Guatemala when he was little more than thirty.  He always seemed very fond of it.  It remained in his possession for all that time, and now it sits upon my bedroom shelf and stares at me, and I don't know what to do.”
I stared at Holmes, uncomprehending.  The lady seated 'twixt us let out a gasp, which sallied to a moan.  When she spoke at last after a tortured interval, her voice was deeper, rougher, by a little, not so notable, then fairly unmistakable.
There was a little bakery on the main road passing through.  I purchased pastries, a jam sponge cake, and a bag of chocolate bits.  The baker's wife was pleasant, and we shared a friendly chat.
Later, we would visit Scotland Yard and bid adieu to our good friends, Lestrade and Gregson.  I could predict what would take place: the verbal jousting, and the shoulder slaps;
By the time we had completed all our shopping, the rain was falling from the sky.  We sought out shelter in the coffee house I'd visited that morning, and we sat over a slice of cake for two.  My heart was full of hope; our conversation flitted like a merry thing.  I found that Holmes was humorous and thoughtful, quite delightful when distracted by a notion or surprise.
so, else I'll be wearing this rag dress all weekend long.”  She huffed, and squinted at me then.  “You are a friend of darling Mycroft?”
The next morning, I slept late.  It was nine before I dragged myself awake, to find the will to wash and dress and comb my hair.  My head was spinning – not from wine, but from the state that I now found myself within.  Wanting a man.  This ardour, suddenly a searing flame, a
“Perhaps not, then,” I quickly amended.  I improvised wildly: “Mr. Hoggerty is simply more aerodynamic?”
“I am not a total loss,” said he.  “Yes, I have the tools, and yes, I have some wood, and mesh.  It can't be all that complicated, surely.”
“Well, now there you are, John,” said my friend.  He leaned back in his chair.  “I suppose it is she.  The snow muffled her boots.  Go on, then!  Before she turns 'round and escapes.”
He caught me by the cuffs then, held my chin and kissed me fiercely.  This succeeded for some minutes, and I could not help but feel this was my friend's way of re-staking his sole claim to me.  We ended up in quite some disarray, entwined and bothered on the sofa.  I had a fistful of his shirt, and his full lips were at my throat and wreaking havoc on my decency.
“Good god, old man,” said he, “it seems I've talent as a writer, eh!  That didn't take you long; what did you
“Then you must tell him,” I said.  “Do not hide how you feel.  And it is absolutely possible to be discreet, as Holmes and myself are.”
My fellow made to lay an arm across my shoulders, but I squirmed out of his reach and made some business with the kettle for a pot of tea.  He followed me, and spun me round to face him.  “John, what now?  Why can't I touch you?”
Holmes was all of thirty-one years old, back then.  Somewhat over six feet in height and unnaturally lean, he paid little heed to the encouragement from myself and Mrs. Hudson that he should eat more than a few mouthfuls of any meal.  His diet was of the sparest, and if only I could say likewise of his other, less favourable habits.  The tobacco I could tolerate – for I was little better – but my friend inclined towards the use of some random foul narcotic when he found himself with time to spare and a black mood closing in.  I gazed at him now for any sign that he might again be so indulging – for his casework these past weeks had been a measure less than fruitful.
“How terrible,” I said (while not confessing that I too, upon occasion, was rather fond of wasting money on the track).  “But the position of the body?  And the open drawer?”
“And then we'll talk things through,” he said.  He laughed a little at my face, crestfallen as it surely was.  “To
A week had passed.  Holmes had been busy with his work, and the few hours that he deigned to spend at home were spent distractedly and taciturn, immersed in books and business.  For my own part, I had contracted a foul cold, and laid abed for several days for the sole purpose of a wallow in self-pity.  Oh, a man when he is ill is not a happy sight, and I was not a happy man, denuded of the company I desperately sought.  I sulked far more than was appropriate, and I snapped at Mrs. Hudson, to my shame, when she brought cups of steaming-hot honey and lemon up two steep flights of stairs and into my cross hands.
“Spencer was in Surrey, then,” I hissed – for I must speak now or burst a blood vessel in angry indignation.  “And little Rusty
After an interval, the meal was on the table and we set to with alacrity, for we had eaten very little since the morning.  The pie was good, homemade and hearty, and with some left for the next day's lunch, our housekeeper informed us.
“We shall leave, yes, I think,” replied Holmes.  “But you must contact us again, without any delay, if you or your staff see either person again.  I shall make my own enquiry back in London.  Do not lose hope, my boy.  We are working on your side, and shall return before the weekend.  Oh, and by the way, might we trouble you for a bowl of water for our friend?”
We breakfasted in silence, perhaps each thinking of the day ahead and how we best might fill it.  A long walk to shake the cobwebs, or a visit to the bookshop might be in order.  Mrs. Hudson brought up the papers and set to clear away the dishes, and my friend picked up the morning's
Sherlock Holmes was there, re-sprawled across his bed.  He raised his head as I came in.  I remained silent; crossed the room to my own space, and picked my novel from the table, sat myself amongst my pillows and commenced to read.  The corner of my eye saw some activity.  Holmes was watching me covertly, twisting slowly round to gain a better angle for the purpose.  I ignored him, all the same.
“No, I did not,” said my friend, “for what good would it do?  To fill his head up with nonsense, when we ourselves know so little?”
“I brought you cake,” replied his brother, which he now drew from a dark recess of a pocket.  “A jam sponge, because you like it, and because you'd shout if I brought fruit-cake.”
Chuckling, I left him to his rattling of the wardrobe, and so retired to my own room to wash and dress.
It amounted to the pair of us turning right into St. James's Street at a little after nine.  The club doors were propped wide open.  We entered through the arch and took the few steps to the desk.
Gregson looked from left to right.  He leaned in closer to my side.  I assumed that he wished to impart a previously unknown piece of data.
“Perhaps.  Although I felt no sense of danger in his company.  He's more of a damp squib – quite literally.  Our poor wet carpet.  If his message held a shred of truth, it was not brought to us with malevolence.”
“I love this room,” I said, “I always have.  It's so large, and light, and cheerful.  My own's a tomb; perhaps you'll see it some day soon.”
There was a silence while his finger traced the pattern on the coverlet.  “Was this your intention all along?” he asked.  “The reason why you offered me your room?”
“To others; not to me,” said he.  He glanced up at the clock.  “Watson, it's late, you'd better head off home.”
My education seemed of far greater importance then, as Holmes explained the murder – for that it was – and the sad circumstance.  I saw the crumpled, bloody body in the front room of the house, upon the dusty, broken boards, and I asked questions as appropriate, and watched Holmes as he scoured every inch, inside and out, with running commentary.  I found the process fascinating.  I made a brief examination of the corpse for Holmes's benefit, and some sixty minutes later we were outside once again, and Holmes was speaking with Lestrade.  He joined me presently, and cosied me away.
A small clearing up ahead, and Holmes was standing at the edge of it, his back against a tree.  His wave of jet black hair had been disgruntled by the breeze, to lend him something of a rakish air.  His features, in repose: exquisite elegance and poise.  I could not tear my eyes away from him.
The wine arrived.  We humoured the sommelier: the uncorking of the '68, the pomp and ceremony; and we swirled and sniffed and sipped and, thus approved, were left in peace.
(I discounted this, although not without a skimming of the chapter.  It was, of course, the usual dour dissection; well-meaning but misguided, as expected) ...
“And she has never heard of William Eldritch.  She admitted, however, that she had recently read for both Flowers and Sloan, and was most surprised to learn that each had come to talk with me.”
“What do you say now, eh, my boy?” chuckled Holmes.  He rubbed his hands and closed the door.  “Although it's not so very deep.  It will have melted by the afternoon.”
At the earliest, I hatched escape, to bathe and change my clothes before I swallowed a small supper and headed out to Baker Street.  I timed it well; Holmes should be home.  If he were not, then I would sit out on the doorstep, quite as stolid and as stoic as a brass bootscraper...
“Well, if you are absolutely sure,” said Victor, still doubtful.  “I am thankful that the room is clean, at least, for Jane has been working on the upper rooms all day at my request.  The sheets might need to be changed...”
The door swung open, nary a knock or scant a warning, and the huffing man himself propelled his feet into the room.  He shot a rheumy glare upon the both of us.
“On holiday,” I repeated, glaring.  I exhaled long and loud.  “A severed arm, indeed.”  Then, with a concluding sigh:  “You are exasperating.”
I left him to his work and returned inside the house, rubbing my hands against the chill.  The library and its maelstrom kept me busy for a while.  Within two hours it was bearing some resemblance to its name, the books shelved neatly in good order, and our writing desks prepared.  Satisfied, I checked my pocket-watch: four-thirty.  It was nearly time for Mrs. Oaks to pay us her visit for the evening.  Of course, that set me back to thinking of the morning – which I had successfully forgotten to this point.  I wished I might forget it more.  I lit the lamps, and stepped outside to the back yard, the air a nip, the sky a woven web of murk.  I poked my head around the door of the outbuilding.
My friend smiled.  “This was Stone at his very cleverest.  But we are jumping three steps ahead.  Let us retrace.  Stone, with his existing and considerable talent as a hypnotist, had found a wormhole in Mrs. Barker.  On his first visit, he ascertained her susceptibility to hypnosis.  Having proven so absorbent, Stone had set the wheels in motion.  Placing Mrs. Barker in a remote hypnotic state, he determined information and so placed his next instruction: for Mrs. Barker to lace her master's evening meal with some mild sedative that should not be detected.  And then, that night, for her to murder him in his drugged state, and to reset the room as if the killer had absconded through the window, the room itself securely locked.  Mrs. Barker, still under the influence of her hypnosis, would then take the skull and pass it to Stone who was waiting outside in a predetermined location.  The deal was now done.  Jacob Stone removed all traces of the memory of her crime, but fed her a false set of movements for the duration of the evening.  The lady returned inside and resumed her normal duties.  And so, a short while later, the discovery was made.
The small percentage of restraint that I had left to me, resisted such an impulse.  It was midnight.  I should travel home, see to my pup, and go to bed alone; attempt to sleep (that felt unlikely), or what else?  To think of Holmes within the doorway of his bedroom, cast in shadow, speaking those words that crackled fiercely down my spine:
paint had now dispersed, at least, thank goodness.  Holmes stood in the plum centre of the room and looked about him.
“I have so many things to do,” said Mrs. Hudson, “that I can't stand sitting idle.”  She leaned the closer to me then.  “Mr. Holmes sat with me yesterday.  He's been very good, you know.  But goodness me, he talked my ear off about you.”
And so it was that Victor learned of the contents of the safe box.  His large blue eyes could scarce believe it as he picked up first one bundle and the next.  Securing his own future, and the future of the gables should he wish to set some permanence within it.  Never had he imagined that his dear eccentric aunt should have so carefully squirrelled away a trove while living in such modesty.  We listened to him babble as he expounded on all the things that he might do:  Repair the structure!  Refresh the décor!  Give up his humdrum job, follow his dream, commence to writing his first novel!
“It is dated just one week ago,” said Holmes.  “The next note may have been the one burnt in the hearth.  John, what can you deduce from this handwriting?”
Having reassured our landlady that we needed nothing further, I closed the door and took my notebook, sitting ready to make record of what our mysterious guest might have to say.  Holmes leaned forward in his chair, his elbows resting on his knees, his fingers steepled.
“Nothing really of the sort,” he said, “but upon my word, you know, my world's been jiggled upside down.”
“It is she!” he exclaimed, quivering visibly with indefinable emotion.  “It is that woman, Mr. Holmes!  I would put my life to it.  And a middle-aged gentleman, too, whom Jane recognises.”  Here our friend's eyes were downcast.  “They believe I am fetching my aunt.  I suppose you should go down and see to them instead.  I shall follow you in.”
Later that day, once back at home, I made a critical decision.  I would take a leap of faith, and I would court Holmes.  I would woo him.  Whatever hyperbole might fit the mark.  I wanted him – and in a way I'd wanted no-one else before.  The feeling dazed me, made me reckless.  I bought two tickets in the stalls for a Wagner night at Covent Garden that weekend.  And if he turned me down – at least then I had tried, and I would try again.  I spent a restless night, anticipating all the words that he might say to put me firmly in my place, wriggle away, declare himself aloft, aloof, uninterested.  By the morning I had worked myself into a colder sweat than I felt pleasant, but took a cab to Baker Street, clutching my tickets, firm in resolve.
.”  I took him in; I licked around him, and I teased him with light flicks and ministrations, and he arched and wailed and flexed.  I arranged him with his legs tight to his chest, and his face puzzled, not yet fully understanding, and then “
A raggle-taggle terrier bounded up from out of nowhere.  Excited by the two new friends within its province, it jumped and barked and showed great sport, its scrufftail wagging hard enough to set the body to mad tremor.
her heart, Mr. Holmes, as they suspected.  Well, well.”  He hung his head.  “I fear that I have wasted your precious time.”
“Bless Mrs. Hudson,” said my friend.  He locked the door.  He came towards me, and he put his arms around me, and he thrust his nose behind my ear and held it there, just breathing, in and out.  “You smell of ambergris,” he murmured, and the body of me shook with want and need.  I clasped his back, and ran my fingers down his spine.
“Yes!  Think back, Watson!  Something that Dawkins said.”  Holmes reached for his coat and hat once more.  “I must go out.  I don't know how long I shall be.”
He did not look at me while saying this.  Rather, he agitated at the coffee pot, and rattled with his spoon.
The two men stood regarding one another for a moment.  Then our friend held out his hand and shook the other's as in wonderment.
Home was frigid, unsurprisingly.  I lit a fire, and settled down beside it with a book, but scarcely had I read a page when a light knock upon my door pulled me away.  I couldn't think who it might be; surely not Gregson (his was more forthright), nor my neighbours, whom I knew were out of town visiting family.  I hastened up and called
Holmes raised his glass.  “Well, we should drink to it,” he said.  “I think next time, we'll dine at Simpson's.  Their roast beef is very good.”
“Doctor!” said she.  She retracted her hand.  “I came to clear the tea-tray and to enquire as to what you both might care for your lunch.”  The good woman sniffed and frowned, craning her neck into the room.  “
“It's seven-thirty!” I exclaimed.  “I'd no idea it was so late.”  I scrambled up, to the dismay of my attendants.
“I'm a little itchy,” he said sullenly, in answer to my eyebrows which had raised above my hairline.
We finished breakfast, and said farewell to the friends and family remaining, then took our bags and strapped them to the waiting carriage which would take us to the station.  We spoke little on the way there, and once ensconced in our compartment, we spoke a fair deal less than that.  Once we reached London, and the train had called a halt, we called to action.
I heard him exhale.  Nothing else was forthcoming.  The atmosphere had soured and I had not the faintest notion as to why.  Eventually, I made my excuses and retreated to my bedroom for some respite.  It was barely half-past-five and I was already dreading dinner.  Holmes's moods were so mercurial, impossible to predict.  As I lay there on the bed, I heard him tune his violin and set to scraping some discordant twelve bar dirge.  This repeated for some minutes, each more erratic than the last, and I hoped that it might end soon.  I raged quietly at the futility of loving a man who could never return the emotion.  A man who only spoke of the softer passions with a gibe and a sneer.  A man whom, despite all of that, I still desperately loved, so forsaking all others.  I brought my hands up to cover my eyes and considered myself as the sorriest chump.
“Wait just a moment,” sang Sherlock Holmes, as cheerily he might in view of the glass shards underfoot, “I will be with you, er, um, yes, in a New York minute.”
In two days time, we would be gone from here, as ghosts, as dust, or ether.  And left behind, familiar furniture and drapes, lampshades, carpets and old picture frames.  What might become of them, well, only Mrs. Hudson knew.  I wondered who should live here after us.  New souls, new lives, with quirks and habits, standing there by the bay window, looking out – upon their view of the city, now; no longer ours to keep.
“A tour of healing, of meditation,” shrugged the old man.  “I have not planned it through just yet.”
We were quiet for some moments.  Oaks came to clear the dishes, and we listened to him clatter in the kitchen and around the house, finishing his chore-work.  Looking from the window at the front, my eyebrows rose to meet my hairline, for there again, as like some pale insistent ghost, was Mr. Parrow, by the hedge.  I started sideways for the door, my temper rising at the impudence.  Holmes by this point had observed, and was closely at my heels – although confound it, he was smiling at my spluttered stamping folly.
, as the Romans might say.”  Holmes sat up again.  “John, please, don't look like that.  You've no idea what it's taken for me to tell you this much.”
I climbed the stairs up to my room and shut the door.  I lit the lamp.  I stood there stupidly, not knowing what to do.  I set the poker to the fire for some pale warmth to fight the chill, then I undressed and got into my bed.  I sat, with back against the board, my knees up to my chin, the blankets wrapped around me.
“It's February,” said my friend.  “That is what February does.”  He flicked the ash tip of our cigarette, and wrapped an arm around me.  “We'd do well to keep each other warm.”
– who could tell where he'd end up, apart from somewhere at the bottom, soaking wet, and likely dead?”
I frowned and looked across at Holmes, who was flipping through his notebook choosing to pay us little mind.
A minor trifle that involved a trip to Surrey kept Holmes busy for the following two days.  It was successful, by his own account, although his knuckles had been barked and his suit jacket had been torn.  The latter went to Mrs. Hudson for repair, whereas the former came to me at my insistence, and I assumed my doctor's hat.  Holmes sat before me patiently while I fussed with salve and bandages, and scolded him for recklessness.
“I love you desperately,” I whispered in his ear.  “And I have wanted you for so long, longer than you'll ever know.”
“Ah, it was Mr. Holmes.  I understand.”  The Inspector nodded.  “All the same, as I am sure you must be aware, it is highly irregular.”
.  Afraid of feeling.  Afraid of losing all I've worked for; being vulnerable.”  He paused to breathe.  “You barely know me.  I'm obsessive.  If I admitted you, I'd never let you go.  You'd suffocate.”
“As we should hope,” said he.  “Upon my word, I pray the boy has a modicum of writing talent, otherwise we should have kept the money for ourselves.”
“So what's all this,” said he, taking a chair, accepting a large whisky.  “This is two days on the trot, I feel quite honoured.  Oh I say, this is good stuff.”  He took a second sip and beamed at me.
My earlier faux pas now quite forgotten – so it seemed – I watched him with amusement as he rummaged in his drawer for a clean shirt.
We wandered slowly to the hall, and peeped into the library.  From there we found the dining room, and further down, behind the stairs, the billiard room and music room.  The kitchens led away through to the back, and so we ventured past the study and the sitting room, and up the stairs to roam the bedroom corridors and storage rooms.  Eight bedrooms, all in total, with seven occupied at present.  The house was beautiful and dignified; an emblem of good housekeeping.  A further set of stairs led to the attics, I supposed, but we did not go so far in our adventures, and returned to take a stroll within the grounds around the front.
Somehow we made it down to breakfast.  I was pleased to see that Adams and young Dooley were still looking very tight.  Newton Cooper and Miss Alice, on the other hand, were prickly and obstinate.  I wondered what the matter was, and if it had some bearing on the meeting in the woods just yesterday.  The weather outside was still glorious: the sun was shining through, the windows open, a light breeze puffing the curtains, and the scent of fresh-cut grass was quite divine.  I swallowed down some toast and coffee, and by gradual degrees I felt myself regain some semblance of humanity.
We spoke of music; of the violin.  I complimented him on his sure touch with it; the music I had heard.  He glowed with pleasure, and he promised he would play my favourite airs, if I might tell him what they were.  I said I would, yes absolutely, yes, I would.
I had loosened my bow tie, removed my boots and jacket both, and was now lying on my bed across its width, as Holmes sat on the edge of his.
I read the slip inside the envelope, and frowned.  I rose and strode towards the door, poking my head around.  “Miss Marsh,” I said, “it seems I must go out to see a patient.  Might you look this lady up inside our records, please?”  I hastened up into my rooms above the surgery, to collect my hat and coat.  I checked inside my bag, threw in some items, and was just fastening my buttons when the receptionist delivered me the file.  I read it quickly, nodding.  “I will be an hour or two,” I said, “no more than that, I hope.”
“You are wearing a new pair of trousers?”  I chuckled.  “If so, they are quite ruined, for you have covered them in butter.”
I felt a pang.  “Don't tease like this,” I said.  “You say that, but you flinch if I move near you.  Was it the whisky and the brandy that made you feel that way last night?”
I gaped around me at the mess.  There were peppermint humbugs by the dozen, a hundred pennies, and a wild array of hairpins, and then somehow, for insane reason, one whole round fruit cake, bashed and dented.
Holmes turned his head.  “Not very long.  The rent is steeper than I'd like, but the location suits me well.”
“To what purpose?” I enquired.  What was the fellow's name?  I looked him up and down.  I felt a frisson that I did not care to classify.
At extreme close quarters with our landlady, I took two steps back from the surprise.  Her hand was raised, outstretched to make her rap upon the door; it froze there now as if debating what to do.
It was, in fact, quite worse than that.  The lumber room at Baker Street was filled to great capacity with stacks of books, newspapers, chests and furniture.  It stretched towards the ceiling and it cluttered on the floor.  The room was large; it made no matter.  We had stuffed it full regardless.
“And I don't need a pudding,” said Holmes, quite contrary.  He flounced away to the sofa and threw himself down upon it.  He glared up at the mantel.  “I don't need cards either,” he mumbled.
We lay together, skin on skin, caressing slowly, kissing often.  We cupped each other, stroked and played until we both were hard and wanting.  I slithered down the bed and touched him with my tongue; he jerked and gasped, clutching my hair.  “John,
“Victor, we are going into the village for an hour.  While we are gone, I must ask you that you take watch by the front for that old woman.  You must not glance away for even a second.  If you should see her, she
“Yes.”  He smiled, and rose to pick his shedded clothes up from the floor.  He brushed them down, and shrugged.  He took my hand and helped me up.  “Go fetch your coat, John, if we're going out.”
“I would have burst,” I said.  I took him in my arms.  I took his mouth.  It tasted sweet, of peat, of spirit, yet of love.  His tongue caressed mine, and we teetered, quite off-balance, 'til I pushed him back, seduced his neck with fevered, white-hot presses of my lips.
.  What shall I do with you?  You drive me to the limits of my patience.”  Mycroft Holmes transferred his gaze.  “Are you discreet?  I warn you, doctor, if you drag my brother down, then I shall--”
Holmes plunged in a hand to draw out a tight bundle of bank notes.  And another, and yet more, and he placed them about on the bedspread.
“Yes.  He was not so especially interested.  His concentration is fixed on the murder.  He has taken an interest in Talmadge's address book, and is at present harassing the poor fellow with the two broken legs.  He will not listen to me.”
I followed him, of course, after a moment's deliberation.  His long legs had set a pace, but I broke into a trot and caught him hailing down a hansom.
“A long time ago.  I miss him very much.  I still have his pocket watch as a small keepsake.”  (I withdrew it, for a second, from my waistcoat, for Holmes to see.)
Meanwhile, 'The Queen' sat in his chair at 221B Baker Street, smoking his pipe, and thinking who knew what about the thirty-year-old doctor in the surgery on Crawford Street.
“Yes,” my friend replied.  “Oh, Watson, you're really very slow, on today of all days.”  He lunged, and snatched a singlestick from a rack upon the wall.  He proffered it to me.  “Here you are.  Go on.  Have a whack.”
And so much green around us!  Budding trees and bushes, flowers, tall grass, my friend's new ear-flapped travelling cap...
A look of horror passed Holmes's face.  “Good lord, I hope not,” he exclaimed.  “The less he knows of you, the better.  He knows that you
“It's a passage!” I said, thrilled.  I clapped my hands.  My friend looked pleased.  “Where does it lead?”
“I deduce that a pale linen suit was perhaps not the best choice for a Spring walk through the country,” I said.
The bell jingled as we entered.  The shop was sprawling, aisled, chaotic, quite fantastic.  Glass-topped counters all around, each one displaying its themed treasures.  There were no price tags.  I extended my startled admiration to an African mask pinned to the wall, framed by four sharp and gruesome spears.  We passed by paintings, some hung, some not, and glanced at porcelain and glassware.  We excused ourselves around three customers conferring in an aisle, and marched up to the counter at the far side of the room.  Behind it sat a gentleman of some fifty years of age, with rather more than a trace of the cadaver about him.  His thin face, although smooth and unblemished, was pale, almost ghostlike.  His hair was a side-thought of tufted grey curl.  The spectacles perched atop his nose were small enough to be of little use if he should have a need to focus.  The high stool that he was balanced on creaked in an agony as he leaned to rest his elbows on the counter.  His smile was broad, his teeth were few.
“My dear Watson,” said Sherlock Holmes, “if you have suffered a flea infestation, then I must beg you to at least have the decency to admit to it.”
Victor Burroughs took three steps into the room.  He held out his hand to Holmes, who grasped it firmly, held his shoulder, murmured his sincere condolences.  I did the same, and inadequately I am sure, but our friend seemed grateful and most moved.
“Don't joke about it,” he said warningly, “you know, or I just might.”  He sat down on the bed and looked at me.  “Will you be standing there all night?”
He shook his head then, flapped his hands, as indication that the subject should be better kept for later.  He swept out to the hall and picked up our bags – for the maid had departed – and beckoned us on to and up the stairs.
“--Oh, well, never mind,” said my odd visitor, stuffing the gloves away.  He peered around my neat consulting room.  “So this is where you live.”
I handed in my notice with the Yard on Monday morning, and I set the wheels in motion for my venture with Anstruther.  The latter was a stout and jolly fellow, with a charming wife and daughters, all of whom lived on the premises above the foundling surgery.  The rooms on the ground floor were clean and spacious, furnished well, and already with a bustle and a hum, as transferred patients came to introduce themselves and their infirmities.  Anstruther was insistent that I dine with them that evening, and I accepted.  All these things to fill and please my time, therefore, and very glad I was to have them, otherwise I should be maudlin.  But no time for that!
temper when she saw me.  The moods of women are so unfathomable.  Anyway, I managed to shoehorn my way into the house for another quick round.  I enquired after her health, and if she was consulting any practitioner at present.  That galvanised her, Watson!
“Oh, later,” said he, with a flap of his hand, springing up from his chair.  “You are always wanting to do things at the most inopportune of moments.  I have to go out now to pester Lestrade.”
“Thank you,” said Holmes.  He looked around.  “Is it always as quiet as this, at this time of the evening?”
My friend's face went through several changes of expression, neither one of which made any sense to me.
Jacob Stone drew the red curtain, unlocked a door and led us through to a small room.  A round table in the centre, laid with lace cloth and, on the top of it, a lustrous, large red jasper skull.  It seemed to reflect all of the light within the room, and the expression on its face – if I could even call it that – was cheerful and benign.
“I didn't want the old skull!  The master had said it, once or twice – oh, he was teasing, I was sure of it – that he might make a gift of it to me.  And I was scared of it, with those huge red sockets for its eyes and those unnatural, grinning teeth.”  The lady shivered.  “But I can't remember.  It was there before Mr. Talmadge got... well, before what happened to him, bless his soul.  And then the next thing I knew, it had gone, sir.  That was when you told me, in fact, sir.  I didn't know before that.”
Midnight, and the two of us had each retired to bed.  Holmes, quite half an hour before, and I, only just now, having banked the fading fire.  I shivered in the moonlight as I shuffled into bed.  I knew I should not sleep that night, so many thoughts and wants inside my head.  I thought that I might read; I turned to take my book for just one chapter, maybe two – and then I realised I had forgotten it, indeed had left it on the sofa in the sitting-room.
“Then perhaps it is likely he has a sounder knowledge of London, and therefore is more familiar with his escape routes than, er...?”
“Hum,” said Sherlock Holmes.  “The top letter is postmarked from Surrey.  A gentleman's handwriting.”
We spoke with the clerks and the counter assistants.  Holmes exchanged words with the various good people as they went about their day with shopping baskets, sacks and barrows.  We rambled along the leafy lanes and stepped aside to clear the way for three young lads astride small ponies as they clattered off on morning exercise.  We learned of the neighbouring towns from the crimson-faced postman, out doing his rounds.  He, as the others, claimed not to know of any gardener, nor old lady dressed in black per our description.
My friend laughed.  “I caught him writing one, one day.  He was quite horribly embarrassed.  (I'm very nosy, John, you see.)  They always start off just the same:
“You've made some progress,” I persisted.  “Look, I have brought you your tobacco – and just in time, it seems.”
This conversation was becoming quite as torturous as the one I'd had with Gregson.  (Had Gregson cared for me at all?  It didn't seem so at the time.  Perhaps I was not very good at all of this.)  “What is your history?” I asked him.
“She mustn't keep her key, John,” said my friend.  “Otherwise, she'll just be in and out and buzzing in our ears all day.”
I massaged his neck and shoulders, the taut sinew and muscle beneath the thin cotton of the garment.  I leaned down to kiss his clavicle; butterfly pecks up to his nape.  He shuddered.
I leaned back against the headboard, lit a second cigarette, and dreamed of nothing for a while.  At length I rose to wash and dress; my crumpled shirt would have to serve another day, and I cursed roundly at my reasons for not folding it.  I fashioned a cheese sandwich from a somewhat stale and sulking loaf of bread, and roamed the flat.  The threadbare life of a staunch bachelor: the rooms devoid of decoration, the bare minimal; the grime of the small corner with the stove, the makeshift cookware, old chipped crockery.  And empty whisky bottles lurking underneath the table, and the books that scattered everywhere as if in fright and fleeing from their reader.  All this I contemplated, and I thought it not so different from my own concern, if truth be told, for a police surgeon's lot was not so very lucrative, and London rent was steeper now.  (I kept a better pantry, though, and kept my books on shelves, and owned more baubles than I strictly had the space for.)
“I want you terribly,” I said, my voice a hush.  I reached a hand to touch the paisley of his waistcoat, and he jerked, and froze, and stared at it, as if it were a spider set on wrapping him in silk.
“She could not possibly be as bad as Mrs. Turner,” said my friend, as he heaved himself up and away.  “I am quite certain that that woman would feed us the same dish as her dog might get.”  He winked at me.  “We can only be grateful that we do not lodge next door, eh, John.”
“Yes, and other places.  It should save time.  I don't much fancy traipsing footsore around each one.  You are back sooner than expected, Watson.  Well, at any rate, I shall see you later.”
We had been walking for ten minutes before Holmes glanced back behind us.  He began to chuckle.  I turned, to see our furry friend had followed us, was standing still and waiting, both ears cocked, tail wagging.
“Yes, I saw her.  Try to be patient, John.  I had to ask for directions to her kiosk, for it is somewhat off the main stretch of road.  I found it – with some trouble – and the lady.  The Gypsy May Baron is an amiable old woman, articulate and lucid, with an atrocious sense of dress.  We had a pleasant conversation.”
to know,” replied the slight inspector.  “What he gets up to in his spare time, I really couldn't say for sure.  He's a more private chap than most, but very helpful in his way.  He'll seldom take the credit for any casework he assists with.  That's odd, because he's not a modest fellow – as I've no doubt you are aware, if you've spent time with him, ha ha!”
“Sshh, lower your voice, do you want Hill next door to hear?  I mean we're over.  Whatever 'thing' we had, it's through.  It's not your fault.  I'm in a stew, and I just need to work things out.”
“There is no law against singing sea-shanties at eight in the morning, that I am aware of,” I said.  “Let Mrs. Oaks have her fun.”
magazine holds an annual awards, with the winners voted for by their subscribers, and I have won within my category.”  I smiled now.  “Isn't that marvellous?”
“She is in the kitchen,” Lestrade replied.  “I suppose you wish to speak with her?  Follow me, then.”
“That I will,” my friend replied.  And so our talk veered back to topics that excluded that fair gentleman, and by and by I felt myself relax, and conversation seemed a jolly thing, and whisky sodas better, and by the time the clock struck ten I felt my head begin to spin, and I bid Stamford a good night, my two feet reeling me from chair to door to street and, by some miracle, back home again.  My rooms were cool; unwelcoming.  I sighed, and hooked my coat onto its peg.  I stretched and yawned.
“Yes.  I queried Dawkins about this, just to gauge his reaction.  The fellow became most enthusiastic.  He confirmed that he was practised in the art and had, in fact, held tutorial classes as a means of earning a little extra money on the side.  He would teach his students of the methods and the words that one might say, and the ways it might be used to cure various phobias and afflictions.  The pendant was his favourite tool, to suspend and swing from side to side to hypnotise the patient.  He was fond enough of the quartz point to keep it close to him to double as a jewel of adornment.”
He smiled, and looked at me from eyelids partway closed.  I felt a pang; an urge, a yearning, in my chest.
“I have a great many bad habits,” he continued, sucking now on a malodorous clay pipe stuffed full with shag, “and a few lesser, better ones.”  He smirked.  “I'll leave it up to you to ascertain which ones are which.”
“It was an interesting ten minutes, at least,” replied Holmes.  “Now, whatever was I doing before all of that?  Watson?”
I would scold him but half-heartedly, for I could tell he bore no malice but a general disinterest.  If the world were filled with men and men alone, that would well please him.  He was a solitary creature though; I saw no chink between his plated armour.  I might tap away a little at it, hoping to reach flesh some day.  I'd seize the golden opportunity!
I'd made a blunder then, perhaps.  We spoke of nothing for a moment, and the fire filled in the void with anxious crackles, spits and flame.
Eva Worthington was Mycroft's lady friend, I was informed.  She was a bonny thing, and barely five feet tall, with raven hair in ringlets, and a blue dress trimmed with lace and crystal jewels.  We exchanged pleasantries, and watched as Aunt Rufina spied her husband from the corner of one eye, so thus to scurry off, her high-pitched trill berating him at volume.
“What is troubling you?” he enquired.  He kissed my cheek and placed an arm across my shoulders.  “You must not worry.  Cast this whole business from your mind now.”
Holmes had been more than usually introspective this past week, and although he professed it made no difference now, as to whether he resided in the city or the country, and declaring he was quite finally exhausted of the former... and yet...
My friend wrenched me away down the hall.  I knew better than to scold him for his rudeness, for it would do little next to no good.
“Yes,” I said – my face rigid with horror as the monologue grew – “I have no doubt that you will, Holmes!  I have no doubt at all!”
Holmes sighed and linked my arm once more.  He drew me back towards our cottage, and we were quiet as we huffed through the white ruffle at our feet, and quieter still as we stepped in and shook our coats and stamped our boots.
He smiled a little, his eyes a slit.  “Oh now, I see that Mr. Holmes failed to reveal to you the details of our meeting of a month ago.  How discreet he is.  A gentleman.  There should be more of his ilk around.”
And he, while sitting there with his great smoke, and chattering of violins and their position in the orchestra (of which I had not the faintest interest, but listened rapt regardless), could not have dreamed of the huge roil within his friend sat closely opposite.
“We should make enquiries at the village about that old biddy,” I said.  Then:  “We have hot water, Holmes, for shaving.”
“Just making the place pretty, John,” said he, with a grand gesture.  He came up to me.  “Your room is ready.  You'll have everything you need in there.  Ho ho!”  He rubbed his hands.  “We'll soon have everything like clockwork, just you see.”
I scratched my head.  “I have read of some success within the field of hypnotism – but, Holmes, what connection does this have with Talmadge's murder?”
Holmes was standing in the centre of the room, arms hanging loosely at his sides, his head held high.  He fixed me with a haughty stare that fooled me not even remotely, for he was shaken just as much as I, and fighting with quite everything he had to best conceal it.
My friend scowled.  “Don't play reverse psychology with me.”  He sipped noisily at his coffee.  One eye dawdled up to peep at me.  “Thank you.”
By the evening, and after dinner, we had gravitated to the sofa side by side to sip our brandy.  The room chill again, the fire had been lit, the orange glow extending out to touch our faces with its comfort.
“Now listen here, Watson,” said Holmes.  He removed from his pocket the tan-leather address book.  “While I talk with the housekeeper, do you think you could take this back up to the study?  It belongs in the upper-right desk drawer.  There were only four addresses inside it.  Four!  That may be better suited for our purposes, but it says little for Mr. Talmadge's social life.”
“Well, that's good for you at any rate,” I said.  I watched him as he ripped open the first letter from the pile.
I threw our bags into a corner of the sitting-room, and raised the windows open.  The air no longer sweet with scented flowers, stock and shrub, but rather heavier with fug and city odour.  I collapsed into my chair and felt around for my clay pipe.  Holmes joined me in my smoke, with one hand waving high the post.
On Saturday I dressed absurdly early for the concert, then sat twiddling my thumbs, all of a fidget, until the clock said I might leave.  My heart was spinning as I made my way as quickly as I could to Covent Garden, where the buzz of eager patrons bound for the theatre and the halls rang as sweet music to my ears.  The Wagner hall was popular; the lobby was a maelstrom, and my eyes searched frantically, my mind now spinning doubt and fret.  But there he was: by a tall pot plant that he still dwarfed by comparison, and smoking a thin cigarette, and seeming most at ease (unlike my anxious self).
He raised his head, and oh, what depth and hope behind those eyes.  “Give me a drink,” said he.  “You surely must have something here.”
“I remember this,” he said, struck by nostalgia, his hand emerging from the tumble with a wooden child's sword.
days.  I am a little jealous, I'll admit.  Isn't that ridiculous?  After all the years we've been together.  If the letters hadn't been so wretchedly
I dozed, and dreamed of wardrobes: an entire room of chipped mahogany spilling great piles of fur and lace upon the floorboards, neverending.  Of my trying to fill my arms with all of this and some of that, and to push it back inside each cabinet to no avail.  The clothes kept falling, spreading out, an endless task.
Now, illumination may strike its mark at any moment, and it so happened that the moment was this one.  I watched my friend with interest as his expression changed once more: his grey eyes narrowed, his lips were set, his chin was raised in silent umbrage.
Two days later, and the sky was grey and threatening to torrent.  The chill air nipped us in our overcoats, as we stood there on the pavement looking up at the old building.  So it was time.  I looked at my keychain with a dull, stupid surprise: the absence of several, but the addition of more – the keys to our farm house and all its outbuildings.  They felt strange to me still, and weighed heft in my palm.  And somewhere I heard a clock strike on the hour, and then I knew that we must fly or miss our train.  Holmes's arm slipped through my own.
I was behind him in a second, but a second is occasionally too long.  Beyond the door there was a further empty passageway.  I reasoned that my friend could not have reached the other side in such a short expanse of time, therefore he must have darted in one of the offices.  Methodically, I peeped in every one, growing more desperate with every puzzled face of every stranger who stared back at me.
I licked him clean.  He moaned the more.  I raised myself upon one arm and looked him over.  “You are quite wrecked,” I said.
“I am her son, that's true,” said he.  “I knew her for a month and then I lost her.  I don't lay any claim to anything, because, you see, that's not the way I was brought up.  I don't take things that I can't rightly call my own.  Whatever would Augusta think, god rest her soul, if I did something that she never would have wished?  I have already ruined one life: hers.  I have no desire to ruin yours as well.”
His hand was cool and soft; I felt reluctant to release it, but let go of it I must, or else latch on like some wild python and alarm the both of us.
“I'll have the same,” said Sherlock Holmes.  He thrust our menus at the waiter and, with elbows on the table, focused all his concentration on the cutlery in front of him.
And Jacob Stone leaned low to look the skull squarely in the socket, and then he placed both of his hands upon its crown and closed his eyes.
,” he read.  The dog wagged its tail all the more.  Holmes looked up at me, eyes squinting from the sharp glare of the sun.  “John, for goodness sake, why do you smile like that?”
“I've earned their loyalty,” said he.  He touched my arm.  “Watson, I'm all yours now.  Where should we go?”
“Why are you sorry?” I enquired.  I glanced swiftly to my friend, but he was mute, his face inscrutable.  “Mrs. Oaks is a good lady, and a better cook.  She made us a fine breakfast this morning.”
It may have taken minutes, although in fact it felt like hours, but at length the piñata buckled, split, tore asunder, and gave way.  All of these things at once, in fact, for its contents sprang to freedom like fifty cross jack-in-the-boxes.  We cowered to deflect the mighty onslaught of our prize.  Eventually, the tumult came to its climax, and we stood up straight again.
He shook his head.  “Not that.  Another reason.”  And his lip set firm; his eyes took on a distant glaze.  “That is all that I can tell you for the present.  But Mycroft is tied up in it, and that is why I had to see him at Pall Mall, and it is why I'm in the temper that I'm in.”  He stubbed his cigarette and smiled at me.  “It all happened for the best, perhaps.  See here, now I'm with you, and Baker Street is so much nicer, and I'm sure that everything will be all right.”  He fretted with a fraying cushion tassel.  “Don't you think?”
And we lay there, in the bed, at peace, and dreaming in our own and separate ways of a bright future, that was promising,
Inside our room again, preparing for the short walk to the inn, I pressed my friend upon his secrecy.
“You're a cuddler,” I said.  He kissed my chest.  “The more you know.”  A thought occurred to me.  “That document!” I said.  “We never found it.”
Pike's hair was longer than before, if such a feat were even possible.  His mouth flapped around his face as if it might wish to fly away just to escape its narrow confines.  He was dressed in an extraordinary outfit: some dark green velvet, a tapered collar, an absurd white ruffle at the cuffs.
I held still as my friend took a quick and neat snip.  He exhaled in deep triumph, and between his index and second finger held my severed curl aloft.
Sherlock Holmes lit his pipe while I all but hopped in impatience.  He leaned back in his chair, crossed his legs, closed his eyes and began.
And so, then, that was it.  At some juncture – two weeks later – the fellow Hoggerty was captured; if not aerodynamically, at least by a Scotland Yard inspector.  Holmes remains quite taciturn on the subject of his legs, and perhaps that's for the best.  He is scratching less, these days, at any rate.
“Pshaw,” said my friend, “I have little patience for the ethereal, with which our man was full to bursting.  Did you take notice of his face?  Yes?  It appeared to be under such vascular effects as might embarrass the heavy drinker, did it not?  And then there was the mention of his memory loss, and his lack of co-ordination.  I am surprised that you could not deduce that for yourself.  And then you plied him with brandy, tut tut, my dear fellow.”
“There is a drainpipe,” said my friend.  He leaned out further.  “It seems secure and has not been wrenched apart from its fixing.”
And here we were, at last: the moment.  I pressed inside him, slowly, achingly.  He whimpered, breath in shocks, lowered a hand to take control.  “Bear down,” I said.  He did so; dragged his nails across my shoulders, clamped me the tighter with his legs.  Oh, god, the feel of him; the heat, the sweat, the
A further telegram arrived while Holmes was out.  I set it by his chair.  When he bounded into the room ten minutes later, I made a point to it.
“You are a block of ice,” I remonstrated.  I stroked his cheek.  “Leave all this now, and come inside.”
“And aggravate the wound into bleeding again, very likely,” I said.  “No.”  I removed my scissors and my tweezers from the bag.  “Holmes, if you could just...?”
“Why, the fact that Spencer is using the back doorway.  It is a shop that he must visit very often, and feels some shame in doing so.  He does not wish to be observed and judged by others.  Hence, the back in preference to the front.  No!  Don't get too close.  If that terrier catches sight of us it will be too bad.”
I looked up at his window as I stood upon the street, and he was there, framed in the curtains, and he was still there as I turned the corner, taking one last peep.
“We were together for a year, I think, then I was invalided out.  The same fate befell poor Everett shortly afterwards, only he did not return to London.  He was scooped up by his family and sent to live abroad to best recuperate.  We wrote to one another, as you've seen by all the evidence.  Perhaps we hoped that time would find a way to work things out.  But then I met
He disappeared from view.  After a moment, I heard sounds of splashing water from the bathroom.  I took the opportunity to pad down to Mrs. Hudson to request a pot of tea.  It arrived with us and was brewing when my friend at last emerged, his face yet pinker than before.  En route he had shucked his garments to his trousers and his undervest.  He patted his damp hair, smoothing it down, a sheen of black.
the son who was the gardener, then who was that old woman who stood lurking by the gate?  And why were all of the notes written in a woman's hand?”
I took a cab to Clayton Street.  I banged upon the door; heard the confusion and the muttering within.  At some great length the door creaked open just a fraction, and that scoundrel's face emerged.  “Whatever is the... John?”  A frantic blinking, and a nervous glance behind him.  “Do you even
“Why, you egotistical --”  I threw a cushion at his head.  “And what am I?  Chopped liver?  I'm your biographer!  Your
The younger man, tall, strong and brown from the sun, stepped forward in query.  His brooding, dark eyes flashed from one to the other of us.
It was brief and succinct.  It was tear-stained and blotted.  It almost impressed me.  Not fully, but almost.
He sighed, in great pain, for the latter came hard to his bohemian soul.  He thrust the sheet into an envelope, addressed it, and then held it out.  “Go on, Watson, I implore you.”
I stood up.  “I need a moment.  Just... a moment.  I'll just be...”  I motioned to the door.  Somehow I stumbled out without a backwards glance, and met the ice-chill of the landing, where I held onto the banister.  It took me several moments to compose myself, to steel my own resolve.  I marched back in.  Holmes was still sitting in his chair, but his whole body was hunched over and his head was in his hands.
“Yes,” I said, “but look.  Do you recall that Lestrade informed us the murder weapon had a thin, broad blade?
me.  His success rate has improved a hundredfold since I've been helping him.  And precious little credit do I get for it, but never mind, that's really of no import.”
“As it turned out, the lady had recently met and fallen to talking with a particular gentleman who promoted himself as some form of a miracle 'healer'.  So persuasive was he, and so convinced was Mrs. Barker by his spiel, that she asked him for his assistance with the 'mysterious pain' in her back that her doctors had not found the root cause of.  She had booked a series of appointments with this gentleman; the last of which was on the day of the murder.”
I was beside him in a second.  As we kissed, I threw my jacket and my waistcoat to one side.  To my delight, I felt his fingers in my shirt, undoing buttons, then the coolness of his palms upon my skin.  I pressed him down upon the counterpane, and, with some mutual wriggling, attained the middle of the bed.  I lay on top of him, and gloried in the feel of tensing muscle, heaving chest, and curling limbs.  Wrapped around me as he was, I whispered in his ear “Opossum!”.  His vivid face wreathed into smiles.
Upon the odd occasion, it was the habit of our landlady, Mrs. Hudson, to refurbish and redecorate our rooms to some degree.  Whether a freshening of the paint, or of the wallpaper at the landing, we bore these changes fairly stoically for the most part.  Left to our own devices, I knew full well that we would alter precisely nothing; would be content with living adjacent to the same tattered rugs and curtains, with jaded paints and paper coverings, until their ultimate decay.  And I doubt – even then – if we should notice.
I shook my head, and opened up my envelope.  A Christmas card, another pleasant scene: a snowman and a little robin redbreast side-by-side.  I read the message and the signature inside.  “Oh!”  I looked up.  “Holmes!  It's from you.”
“John, I love you,” he said clearly.  “I never thought I'd say those words, but here they are, and they're surprising me as much as they must you.”
“Oh yes, old Newton,” Adams said.  “He had this grand idea to marry Alice off to poor old Dooley.  Little did poor Newton know – ha ha!  He hadn't got the foggiest!  Kept pushing them together.  Alice, of course, kicked up her heels, and was very cross about the thing, but Newton couldn't get it through that thick bone-box of his.”  He eyed us carefully.  “Now I know you're decent sorts, the pair of you.  I know you won't cause any trouble over this.”
Holmes twists around to look at me.  He is smiling, his eyes are bright and full of tenderness.  He releases one arm from the sheets and reaches out for a handful of me.  My right hip.  He squeezes, experimentally.
Perhaps she knew.  I think she did.  She exhaled a shaken breath, and shuffled through and to a chair.  We sat on either side, Holmes calm and passive to my puzzled state.
“We haven't moved a thing, Mr. Holmes.  Everything remains as it was.  Well, apart from those damned books that I just knocked over, but my eyes can't be everywhere at once.  The rug here is rather rucked, as you can see, but no, we found no traces of a fight or anything like that.”
Victor was waiting by the gate.  We made him promise that he should meet with us in London very soon to update us on his progress with the gables.  Sally and Jane would retain their posts; Victor was about to go to inform them of the news.
“There is a fellow by the shore,” I said.  “He has a little dog, how grand.”  I tugged at Holmes's sleeve.  “Let's go and say good day to him.”
a jumped-up 'scallion.”  He sighed.  “But lord, you know, I liked that.  I think that's why I was so blunt with you.”
The little rat-faced Inspector was already at his desk, surrounded by papers when we rapped upon his door.  He craned his neck over his lamp to assess the intruders on the threshold.
Neither of us mentioned what was foremost in our minds.  We washed and dressed and made our way downstairs.  We opened curtains, peeped outside – fresh snow! – and found each other in the kitchen.  Holmes was staring at the coffee pot as if it were an eight-pronged beast.
We accessed the rear gardens and were admiring the fine structure of some tall, sweet-smelling mass (and here I cannot be precise, for flowers never were my forte), when Holmes hove into view.
“You could do a lot better than running around in circles at Mr. Holmes's heels,” said he.  “It makes you look like a stray pup following a lamp post, ha ha!  Does he have any work on at present?  No?  Well, shame.  No doubt our Inspector Lestrade will put him straight.”
I thrust my tongue in him, to shut him up.  I pulled him by his elbows; he resisted at the doorframe.  With my saliva on his chin, his hair a shock, his braces shucked, he gasped and scrabbled and regrouped.  “I hadn't planned on this,” he breathed.
“Not so fast,” I said.  Manoeuvring, we switched about.  I pinned him to the bed.  I kissed his mouth; I traced my tongue across his chest and abdomen.  I licked and wetted the soft mound of pubic hair.  I took his prick into my mouth and lapped it gently, teased and nudged it to attention.  He was wailing, baying, making such a noise, that I held pause.  “You have to
“I have something of yours,” said Sherlock Holmes.  He reached into the linen bag that he was carrying, and brought forth a box, one, two, three, four, and set them out upon the table.  He unlatched each lid in turn and looked to Pike for his response.
“Ah,” I said, “you think that the skull may have been stolen to be sold by this fellow?  Do you believe that may have been the true motive – or was it an opportune theft?”
He flushed in pleasure, might have answered, but for the sound of singing then from the direction of the kitchen.  It was a shanty, of the sea sort.  It was half-cracked and derailed, with a top-note of the preposterous.
And Holmes sprawled backwards on the rug, his legs tucked underneath from kneeling.  But as opposed to feeling wonder at this clinical deduction, I could only see the tautness of the fabric at the thigh, and of the pull around the midriff, of the barest hint of skin between the buttons of his shirt.  Fair overcome, I felt the strongest urge to kiss him and, moreover, felt the need to place my hands on him, the tautest point, that fabric at the thigh, a hint of paradise above...
“It is a letter from Langdale Pike,” said Holmes.  “In green ink, yet again.  Or rather, this time it's a warning.”
I rose, and finished buttoning.  I combed my hair through quickly, and moved over to the window to look out across the dappled grass.  I frowned, then, as I focused on the bushes near the gate, for a dark figure was half hidden there, but oscillating, hesitant.
He tutted softly.  “I just explained.  Must I repeat myself?”  He paused then and took pity.  “It is my business,” he said gently.  “I am...” (and here, a longer pause) “... a consulting detective.”
“So it happened just yesterday evening,” Mr. Sloan continued quickly, “that I paid one of my occasional visits to an old friend of mine.  You won't have heard of her, I doubt, for she is the Gypsy May Baron who works near Charing Cross.”
“What trouble is there?” I asked, baffled.  “Mr. Dooley only has to make it clear that he's not interested?”
We each laid eyes upon the other, and at precisely the same moment.  If time stood still, it over-balanced.  If the air seemed thick, it was a strangling pea-souper.
“Gallantry runs in the family, I see,” said Holmes with a smile.  “May I ask what your plans for the future will be?”
The morning came.  We proclaimed silently, and looked out at the street, where passers-by walked on, oblivious, and Mrs. Hudson clattered saucepans on the lower floor, oblivious.
I poured us both a whisky, and sat us down beside the fire.  Holmes, leaning forward, gazed long into it, the silence that we nurtured only broken by the snuffle of the pup, and the low crackle of the coal.  At length, he leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes.  “I fell in love, at university,” he said.  “It ended horribly.  I swore to never fall in love again.  The fellow played me for a fool, and I declare, I was the greatest one.”  He twitched one eye to squint at me.  “I'm sure that you were wondering.”
Holmes followed me into our bedroom, where he sat down upon the edge of the bed to watch as I packed.
“It's a pleasure, and he's no bother.  He's an angel, aren't you, Max?  Oh, you doctors, with your working hours, and all those overnights!  You must be worth your weight in gold.”
“If some of our past clients could only see you now,” I said.  “I think they'd have a rare conniption.”
Our group of three marched on.  The birds sang in shrill harmony around us.  The air smelled sweet.  And how enjoyable a walk it was, despite the heat.
Once home, my friend curled himself up with a city directory, and notebook and pencil.  By now it was late morning, so I called down to Mrs. Hudson for some sandwiches and tea.  This whole affair had me quite rattled – not least the adventure with the window – and I wondered how on earth Holmes might proceed in tracking down the mystery visitor.  I dared to ask him as much, as he leafed through the pages.
was the house directly looming, and now here we were, the horse hooves clipping at the gravel, and now settling to stand before the double oaken door.
He corralled me, much as a sheepdog might, towards the stairs and out.  We paused politely to shake hands, and then I faced the street alone, the wretched bustle of the day.  The abruptness of our parting hurt me keenly, yet I knew I was to blame for this small fracture.  All that blasted intimation – when Holmes was very plainly immune to whatever 'charms' I had.  Was he an invert, yet, at all?  I couldn't even tell you that.  Perhaps he kept a string of women at a rakish, equal distance, and my slight tug upon the slack had horrified him.
“Tired,” I complained.  I peered down at my watch.  “Ugh.”  Then:  “This reminds me of Franton, for some reason.”
The wound was on the outer thigh, and healing nicely.  I set to work.  Holmes's skin was cool and goosebumped.  He was quiet now, his attention fixed to a vague spot on the wall.
is in a current state of hysteria.  Hum.  They give the address of the property as 9 Peregrine Way.  Well, this is far more in my line.  I fancy that we pay the house a visit, Watson, what do you say?”
We left the back street, passing by the foul-smelling butcher's shop and heading, I supposed, in the direction towards Baker Street.  This seemed not to be the case as Holmes turned back.
“I regret that I have nothing.  I could, however, take your details, and if such an item should come in...?”
“I applied your own methods,” I chuckled.  “I don't want you trimming my hair.  Not after the last time.”
I am atop the sheets.  I roll over, as close as I can to him.  He turns his chin up, accepts a soft kiss.  A kiss that will deepen and render us breathless.  I know for certain that I shall never tire of this: his kiss, his skin, his touch, his love.
To his dismay my friend discovered that he could duck his head no lower.  One eye peeped up, afraid, alone, and quivering in its socket.
We stopped all of a sudden then, and listened to the sound of singing coming from the far end of the house.  The most curious timbre; both cracked and forlorn, with a top-note of glee.
“Go back to that silly fellow, then.  The one on Oxford Street.  The one with the gammy leg and the mutton-chop whiskers.  It's no wonder you like him.”
“I remember everything,” said Holmes.  He pinched my nose.  “Please unpack our bags now.  I need my toothpicks.  Thank you, John.”
Of course, that had him panting, and I stripped him to the sound of it, then I was full upon him, and his legs were tight around me, and my spit-slick fingers in him, and goodness knows whatever noise that I was making by that point.  His face was creased as I made headway.
“Not remotely.  I was tired.”  My head felt heavy, as if a hundred small lead weights suspended from it.  “I was reading about--”
Our young friend nodded, smiling weakly.  He took a long draught of his ale.  “And that makes it better,” said he, with a wipe of his lips.  “Delicious.”
“I was only sulking,” my friend explained, “because I wanted to be the first person to send you a card.  But that arthritic nitwit got in there before me.”
We set off at a slow pace, keeping well hidden by the jostle of pedestrians and street carts.  Spencer's route was not meandering, but headed straight for the lower and popular commercial quarter.
We sprang up from our seats, and Holmes stepped forward to our guest, whose head was inclined just through our threshold, peering around, eyes wide and curious.
Sherlock Holmes ruffled his plume and drew himself up to full height – which was considerable – and scowled at me.  “I doubt that
I looked at him: every inch the sulking child in a poor temper for no reason.  I knew full well that the festive season was prone to bringing out either the very worst or very best of any man.  In Sherlock Holmes, there poured forth both in equal measure; and today, rather unfortunately, more of the former.  There was still some coffee in the breakfast pot.  I poured a fresh hot cup, dropped in one sugar cube, and ferried it to the sofa in the hope of faint appeasement.  Holmes accepted it, begrudgingly and silently.
