So long, I'll miss you forever.
One of the Avengers gets diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor, this is the story of how everyone else deals with the fact that one of their own is gone.
-Natasha
IT IS WITH GREAT SADNESS THAT I BID THEE FAREWELL. I HOPE THAT YOU ARE IN VALHALLA INJOYING THE FINE MEAD. I SHALL TELL OF YOUR BRAVERY TO EVERYONE, SO THEY MAY KNOW HOW BRAVE A MIDGUARDIAN CAN BE. I WILL ALWAYS BE GREATFUL THAT YOU CALLED ME FRIEND AND GAVE ME A HOME HERE ON MIDGUARD. ONE DAY WHEN WE ARE ALL GATHERED TOGETHER IN VALHALLA YOU MUST TELL ME OF YOUR BATTLE WITH THIS CANCER, IF IT COULD DEFEAT YOU THEN I HOPE THAT IT NEVER COMES NEAR MY JANE, FOR I COULD NOT BARE TO LOSE HER THE WAY WE LOST YOU. SO LONG MIGHTY WARRIOR, MAY WE MEET AGAIN.
Some master spy I am that I didn't even know that this was happening until it was over and I kind of hate you for that, yet at the same time I can't find myself to stay mad at you. It's funny how we all expected it to be anyone but you who would die first, yet you were the most human of us all. I don't know what else to say except thank you, thank you for giving me a family and a home when I never thought or expected to find one at all. We will all miss you.
AKA Iron Man
-Steve
As I stand here over your grave, I somehow still can’t believe that you are dead; yet there it is your grave marker with your name on it:
There is some cursing in this chapter, please read at your own digression.
-Tony
I'll miss you and love you forever,
I don’t know why you would have me do this, type this up for someone else to read at your funeral, but you always did call me your greatest creation, so I guess you just wanted to give me a chance to say goodbye to you if not in ‘person’ then in the form I knew how, so thank you for giving me this chance to ‘say’ goodbye sir. I’ll miss you for as long as I run this tower, and yes I promise that now that you’re gone I won’t go all ‘skynet’ on everyone else. Goodbye Sir.
-Pepper
I don’t know what to do here, I’ve out lived almost everyone, yet I’ve never been to a funeral before, much less to a funeral for a friend/teammate. I brought you flowers, though something tells me you would have preferred coffee grinds. I’m still not used to talking about you in the past tense, I probably will never get used to it. I still can’t believe that none of us noticed, but you were always good at hiding things; but still I can’t figure out why you didn’t tell me. I’ve run all of the scenarios in my head and can only guess that if you told me I would have thought you a liability. Why did you do this then? Why did you allow me to fall in love with you? Why did you have to die? Why did you leave me with everything? Why did you leave me here with all of these unanswered questions? My god Tony, Why?? Why did it have to be you? I never even told you that I loved you Tony. So here is my confession over your grave, I LOVE YOU! I love you and I’ll miss you for the rest of my life.
When he closed the front door Tony was standing in the doorway to the bedroom. He looked terrified and on the verge of crying.
“David again?” He question.
Story is not beta read so all mistakes are mine!
Tony focused on the floor not meeting his eyes. “David…” He whispers. “We fought and it got out of hand.” He ads.
“Looks like it.” Tony chuckles. “Maybe we can meet for lunch for tomorrow? Since you are in town?” Tony asks his friend. With him being in the marines it was too long between seeing each other and he was never certain if he would see him again. So when he was in town they made sure to see each other as much as possible. “I could bring David.” He suggests.
“Oh god!” He pretends to sound concerned. “I am sure that Tony will come around and be home soon.” He assures David on the other side.
Kudos and comments make me happy! I hope you enjoyed it! :D
“Oh really?” Tony taunts again. He hears a loud smack and feels the burning sensation across his butt. A cane he thinks as he whimpers from the pain. “You should have considered that this afternoon.” Tony repeats. Another hit with the cane across his butt making him wince. “So how about that punishment? How many times should I use the belt on you? What is a reasonable number for disobeying my orders?” Tony asks voice hard and cold while he was soothing where he hit with the cane.
Steve groans into the shoulder. “You make it sound like I am clingy and needy you know? And I am fine I told you last night.” He argues even though he secretly loved the days they spent together being lazy on the couch and order in food and just watch movies. A day to just be a couple without any interruptions, it didn’t happen too often.
The soft curve of his lips was a contrast to the sharp lines of his goatee, his nose had small bump in it from being broken when he was 17 and got into a fight with a jock that had insulted Steve. ‘
“He doesn’t hurt me.” Tony replies to hard, to fast. Because she can’t possibly know what is going on. She was crazy David had told him. He only had crazy exes and David had tried to make it work Tony knew that because that’s what David told him.
“No.” Howard didn’t like that answer. He was still under the belief that Tony feared him and wanted to please his father something had worked through years ago with the help of Steve and a lot of therapy. He didn’t need his father’s approval. He had a family who wanted him and loved him unconditionally. Blood didn’t make a family. Love did he had learned that while being with Steve.
Again Tony smiles and ignores the glaring bruise that was screaming at him. Instead he goes back to his bedroom and picks up his phone and start typing a text message to David.
“Doesn’t make it okay Tony.” He holds on to the first aid kit harder than he had intended but if was literally the only thing right now stopping him from running out the door and hunt David down and kill him slowly.
“I want to see it for my self!” David demands and tries to move inside the but Steve doesn’t move an inch. He was not letting this man inside his own home.
He thinks to himself but smile when he joins them at the table. “Hi! I am Steve, Tony’s best friend!” He holds out his hand for David to take it.
“It’s your company… Shouldn’t you be there every day?” Steve wonders knowing Tony had practically lived there before David and he had loved every second being in the presence of other equally creative people, not as smart as him not by any means but it is very few who could match Tony’s intelligence. The man had three PhD’s for god’s sake.
“I am not nagging! You always complain about your job and if you hate it so much you should just quit and get a new job!” Tony replies as calmly as he could knowing very well that David was a ticking bomb and would soon just explode and take it out on him. “And I am sorry if that upsets you but you should think about it.”  He continues.
Tony’s heart broke. “Babe… We never really talked about it you just mentioned it like it was...” Tony tries to find words. “… something everyone goes through when its not. Something traumatic happened to you and I just want you to be happy.”
“That’s because its true and I know you, teaching is your calling. You are meant to teach, so stop doubting yourself and just be you.” Tony encourage as he press a soft kiss to Steve’s mouth.
“Yes please!” He groans out. He received a smack by Tony’s hand for that comment.
I hope you enjoyed and as you notice I am not a slow-build writer I wish I was, I admire people who can build everything slowly but I can't so I hope you enjoy it anyway!

"What, um -, what do you think is written on my face?" Steve cocked his head.
Steve looked down and softly replied, "Do you mean like you were actually living it?"
"And I wish you wouldn't be," Steve continued. "I love everything about you." Steve tightened his hold on Tony's waist, leaned in and whispered into Tony's ear, "And you are more beautiful now than you ever have been."
“I remember you tried to stop me from taking the orb, but it was too late. And when we broke contact, you returned here. So it wasn't a dream." Tony surmised, "But, I just don't see what the point of it all was.”
"Thank you for dinner, Tony," Steve reached up and stroked Tony's cheek. Tony watched as Steve looked up to see Natasha still standing in the room. "I'll call you tomorrow?"
“Peter,” Tony called out from the kitchen.
"Yes, it's me, Petey."
"It was always you," Steve as he walked back in the room and up to Tony's side. Steve curled his arm around Tony's waist, "I knew it then," Steve nodded towards the photo, "And then when you showed this picture to me for the first time, I knew I couldn't hide it from you any longer. How could I? It's written all over my face."
Tony sat like that on Steve's lap for a moment, enjoying the closeness, enjoying the feel of Steve’s skin under his fingertips and the warmth of his touch as well.
Steve cocked his head at Tony, "And did you sit on your ass and eat bonbons all day? I'm pretty sure you watched Peter all day. You made breakfast, lunch
Tony smiled, bursting inside thinking of the vision that had the potential to come to fruition. Loki had truly given him a gift.
Five years later,
“What happened? Is this about Justin?”
Tony calls over his shoulder, “Don’t be so hard on yourself. Give yourself twelve percent of the credit.”
The door is still unlocked so he lets himself in. Tony, who is fiddling with the cash register, glances up when he walks in. There’s a flash of anxiety across his face before he tucks it away beneath a cool veneer.
It’s not the first time he’s heard the number, but it might be the first time it really sinks in. This had never been like SHIELD, one shady government organization with its own agenda that changed depending on who Fury was talking to. This had been well over half the countries in the world, all managing to agree on this one thing: the Avengers need to be put in check. And he hadn’t even managed to listen long enough to hear them out.
He starts the shut-down procedure as he begins, “Once upon a time, there were three robots named U, DUM-E, and Butterfingers. They worked for a mechanic named Tony, who loved them very much.”
“But how many of those people would have shown up without the discount?” Tony shoots back immediately.
He’d fucked up. Bucky was right. For three years, Steve had thought that he and Tony were on the same page. He’d thought that Tony knew better than to push him like that, to insist on more like he always had when they were dating. Tony had always wanted everything he could get, greedy for affection, for Steve’s time, for love. Steve didn’t know why he’d thought Tony would be different this time around. But he had. He’d fallen for Tony’s lies, let him take Steve home, fucked him and been fucked, thinking that they both knew what this arrangement was. And all along, Tony had—what? Been building his case for why they should try again? Known that he was going to try to push Steve for more than he could give?

Next time I see you man, my fist is hitting your face so hard that you’ll be black and blue for two weeks. You left my best friend down here heartbroken, so if I remember correctly I’ll owe you at least that, and yes this counts as you hurting him because you’re gone and he’s never going to be the same without you. Even though I kind of hate you for breaking my best friends heart, I can’t be mad at you because you loved him with all of your heart, so thank you for loving him and showing him that he didn’t have to give up the past he just had to look at the future as a new life and I can’t tell you how grateful I am that you gave him that new life. Now I’m going to have to try to give him something else to live for, because he’ll do something stupid in order to join you up there sooner and I know that you wouldn’t want that, you’d want him to find some dame and settle down and have lots of kids, but I don’t think that’ll happen; I’ll keep him here for as long as possible because he’s needed right now, but as soon as he’s not I’m not going to stop him. So goodbye you bastard and don’t get too comfortable, because once Steve’s gone I’ll be up there to kick your ass.
Well, at least this time you didn't destroy anything while you were dying. I noticed that you gave everything (except for the company) to Steve, not that it'll do any good; the man is heartbroken and no amount of money or buildings is going to change that. I'm gonna miss you man, the world is definitely darker and quieter with you gone. So I guess this is our final goodbye, and I don't know how to say that to you, so I'm not going to say goodbye, I'm gonna say so long and I'll see you again and even if you don't believe in heaven, I know I'll see you up there.

You god dammed fucker; I can't believe that you didn't tell us that you were going to die on us! Then again, I can see why you didn't tell us, you probably thought that if we knew you would have been benched and we would have treated you like you were made out of glass and would break at the littlest thing and you were most likely right, but you still should have told us you bastard. Fuck it, I hope that where ever you are you know that we will never be the same without you, you gave us all a home and now that home is short one very important person and it's no longer a place to go home to at least for me it isn't. I'm going to miss you, you bastard.
I know that I didn't know you all that well, but it feels like I did. Thor always spoke of you and his other comrades in arms in such fond tones that I feel that we would have gotten on fabulously. I don't even know why you wanted all of us to do this, but I don't know what you want me to say here, except that you will be missed greatly and that the world is a darker place without you in it.
P.S. Steve, I'm so sorry I never told you I love you.
A Friend, a Teammate and an Inventor
You are going to have a lot of people angry with me, but then you always did delight in making my life miserable. I still can't believe that I didn't know what was going to happen to you until two days ago, when you came into my office and swore me to secrecy, then proceeded to tell me about your illness and handed over all of your requirements for your funeral. I should have never agreed to that, but they do always say hindsight is 20/20, now I just got to watch my back even more closely in case one of my former super spies decides to take my silence on your illness out of my hide. I won't miss you at all.
Everything is to quiet now that he's gone, it's like the light and sound went out of the world when he died; yet before he died, I could swear that he was never happier than he was in that last year. People always say that you don't know what you had until it's gone, but that is so not true; we knew what we had we just didn't know that it was going to end so soon. When I got the phone call that they found his body I half expected them to tell me that he died in the line of duty, but no they told me that it was cancer. I still can't believe that after everything cancer took him away from us, not a bullet or a Doom Bot but CANCER, and the worst part of it is that he never told us that he was sick. I never even pictured losing him this way, I'd always thought that he would have out lived us all, so maybe that's why he never said anything; all I know is that I never told him about our news, mine and Happy's I mean and I know that now is a really bad time to announce it but I'm pregnant and I'm thinking of naming the baby after him, like use his first name as a middle name or something. God, why is this so hard? I just hope that all the pieces that he left behind can be fixed.
“What’s going on?”
Still stuck on the bed, DUM-E beeps dubiously. Tony gets the impression that the bot still isn’t convinced. Tony doesn’t blame him. He’s probably threatened to take him offline enough times that DUM-E completely believes him by now, even though he’s never serious about the threat. He wouldn’t do that to DUM-E. Sure, he’s got issues, but that just gives him personality! Besides, Rhodey adores him, even if he claims otherwise. Tony can’t just get rid of him.
“One of—but not yours?” he directs to Tony.
They stop beside the energy converter. Steve can immediately see what Tony means by there being something wrong with it. The converter is made out of some sort of transparent material—Steve doesn’t know what—so he can see right in to where something is twisted in the converter itself, partially fusing the door shut. Even Tony, with all his abilities as an Aurum, can’t reach into an active energy converter without burning his hand to ashes, and the converter has to stay active or they’ll be dead in space, so they’ll have to stop somewhere where he can make the necessary repairs.
“I know, I was taking a big risk on our safety. I should have said something.”
Without thinking about it, Steve tucks the gun into his waistband and opens the door. Tony is standing there, looking pale and trembling and very,
Steve’s mind does
Steve: Tony—
He pauses. Really? That’s not something he’d considered. Just like Tony, he’s never been called subtle a day in his life. It hadn’t occurred to him that Tony genuinely hadn’t known. “Tony really didn’t know?” he asks cautiously. “This wasn’t his way of letting me down gently?”
“So what is it then?” Bucky demanded.
The door is locked when he gets to the store and he fishes his keys out of his pocket to unlock the door. There’s music playing over the speakers when he steps inside, something classical but he’s pretty sure he recognizes it as being a cover of some old rock song. At first glance, Tony doesn’t even seem to be in the store, though Steve knows he wouldn’t take a day off this close to the launch.
“Didn’t she tell us that neither of our advice was helpful and she’d solve it on her own?”
“Betty dear, this is Steve. Steve, Betty,” Tony said, clasping a hand onto Steve’s shoulder. Steve shrugged him off. They weren’t tactile, or at least, he tried to insist they weren’t tactile, though Tony rarely lived up to that.
She shrugs. “Sure there is. Won’t means there’s something personal holding us back. I could go back now, if I wanted to. I did sign in the past. I’ll have to answer for leaving, but I could still return. But I don’t want to yet. I don’t want to have to account for what I’m currently doing.”
“Yes,” Tony said again slowly, thinking about it. The song was slipping from his memory even as they talked about it. “Only… it wasn’t like any television song I remember.”
He exchanged a worried look with Tony, wondering if there was a way to verify—without Rumlow knowing—if Focus on the Family had in fact given Pierce an ultimatum, but before he could lean over and say something, Pierce swept in, smiling as broadly as he always did. And as the meeting progressed without any mention of Focus on the Family or
“Absolutely,” Tony says solemnly, though there’s a twinkle in his eye that speaks to his amusement. “We definitely planned this out after I met with you this morning to make sure I would never embarrass myself in front of you again.”
“Hey, Steve?” Tony asked, his voice loud in the otherwise quiet room. Steve bit back a wince. He really thought they were past Tony asking him to stay.
“Oh,” Tony says again. There’s a moment where they’re both silent, the only sounds coming from the cat purring and Tony tapping his fingers on the glowing thing beneath his shirt. “So, why are you here, then?”
“I’m not actually a mind reader,” she says dryly. “If you want me to know something, you have to tell me.”
“I’m not
But that didn’t seem to be what Tony wanted. And he knew that Tony had said it was just a joke, had said that this was the best job he’d ever had and that he wasn’t just going to give it up, but didn’t every joke have a kernel of truth to it? Wasn’t there a possibility, however small, that Tony was completely serious?
“Sorry?”
Tony’s expression is simultaneously soft and a little nervous. Steve wants to soothe that, wants to reassure him that this is everything he’s wanted since the first time he saw Tony in Luis’ office.
“We do,” Steve says again. He sounds rueful and Tony frowns.
“Okay.” She raises her hands in surrender. “I’m just saying, don’t wait too long to figure things out. I don’t want to see you lose this opportunity too.”
, we’ve got time this morning. Let’s take it slow.”
But worse than Steve avoiding him is that Steve hasn’t said a single word about any of his courting gifts. He hasn’t refused any of them—not that Tony was expecting him to because he gives the
to do that in front of an audience, especially one that consisted of Tony. “Get out of my way.”
“It’s gonna be okay, buddy,” he soothes. “I’m gonna make it better.”
“How’s the new team working out?” he asks as Tony digs into the food.
members?”
Tony: Did you?
They leave for Wakanda the next morning. Steve’s heart feels as though it’s in his throat; he’s so nervous. He hasn’t seen Bucky since he went back into ice. He doesn’t know how Bucky will react to seeing him, if he’ll be happy to see his old friend again, angry that they’ve been forced into hiding… He doesn’t know and that scares him. He risked so much to make sure Bucky would be safe and he doesn’t think that he’s owed anything for that, not in the slightest, but—but he doesn’t want to find out that he gave up Tony for nothing.
“—go first,” Steve finished. He rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly, glancing to the right to avoid looking too long at Tony, who looked like he was about to start laughing. “Ah. You first.”
For anyone concerned about the unhealthy relationship tag, don't worry. Steve and Tony aren't in great places mentally at the beginning of this story, but I do promise a happy ending by the end of the fic
He wondered for a moment if he had pushed Tony too hard, if that was what would make Tony decide it wasn’t worth it. But Tony just nodded and bit him again, harder this time. It would probably leave a bruise, but Steve couldn’t bring himself to care. He knew he was already asking a lot by asking Tony, who was so tactile, not to touch him; he didn’t want to insist that he couldn’t even mark him, the way he knew Tony wanted. He didn’t know
“Hey, Stark Apothecary is your baby. You get to open the doors.”
Steve insisted, “Tony doesn’t want to get back together.”
Steve blinked at him. He hadn’t realized Tony had been paying so much attention as to notice when Steve’s friends were in town. “I, uh, yeah, they are.”
Tony looks up at him. “Can I come in?” he murmurs. “I have—there are things I need to tell you.”
, whether that’s comms, mechanical, or even medical. Tony does it all. According to Natasha, Tony, who’s one of the few nonhumans on the ship, was once a member of high society on his home planet, Aur’a, but left it all behind to join the
Tony shoots him an amused look. “Ana used to say that if you were making a home-cooked meal, you should
Steve shook his head and reached behind him to close the door. “I was upstairs, shaving. Didn’t hear you until you started caterwauling.”
“Mmhmm. Only a few things that could be. Probably need to tell the One-Eyed Pirate though that we have to stop on Xandar instead of Knowhere. I don’t think Fujikawa will have what I need. Steve, don’t let me forget to tell Fury the course change.”
Wow. That really sucks. But… “And the shower cap is…?”
They have a good day, productive, busy, and Tony’s smiling again, so that’s something at least, even if he
Tony turns to his pouting daughter and crosses his arms. “Now that it’s just us, why don’t you tell me what’s going on, Miss Morgan?”
Or she can do her “Wonder Spy thing,” as Tony calls it, and know exactly where he’s going and who he’s going to see while he’s there.
Tony glances away and then back at him. What is he thinking right now? What thoughts are running through his mind? If Steve knows Tony, he has a million of them, all contradicting each other.
Tony shoots him an unamused look.
“There it is.”
,” Steve interrupts firmly. “I’m not offended.”
and he won’t deny that they’re useful.
“Just a second, Tony,” he muttered. “Let me catch my breath and then I’ll take care of you.”
“She said—Tony, do you know where Geraldine lives?”
Damn. Steve had been so distracted by the thoughts of what Thor was buying and what it would be used for that he’d completely forgotten about the expiration date on it. “Think I should go after him?” he asks gloomily.
“Honey bunch, please, ‘had feelings’ sounds so old. Use something else.”
“So we’ll do that then.”
“Mmhmm,” Tony hums breathily, eyes fluttering closed. “So cold.”
“No, gentlemen, let me handle the Ladies Association my way. You don’t see me getting mixed up in any of your soirees, do you? Wanda, backstage.”
“Tony?” he calls, dropping his bag off on the counter.
“I’ll see you tomorrow.”
[From
“No sense in crying over spilled milk,” Tony tells him when Steve mentions that to him. But Steve knows him better now. He knows that Tony wishes things could have been different too. The Avengers mean the world to him, just as they do to Nat and to Steve himself. There isn’t a lot he wouldn’t do to have them back together.
“Wideawake?” Steve asks. “I don’t remember seeing that in the Accords.”
He barely noticed Tony drive off, too preoccupied with Sam sweeping him up into a bearhug. Steve gave as good as he got though; they were both out of breath by the time Sam let him down. Bucky’s hug was just as fierce, though he seemed a little more distracted, still staring after Tony’s car.
Is he just imagining the wistful look on Tony’s face or is that something that Tony actually wants to do? “Yeah.”
“We could, maybe, go tonight? For your birthday?” he suggests, voice cracking in the middle of his sentence. Wow, he hopes Tony doesn’t catch that.
“You can’t blame yourself, Steve. Emotions were running high, we’d just found out we weren’t the only kids on the block with powers, you made a decision based on the information you had.”
She tilts her head, thinking about it. “I thought we needed to have one hand on the wheel to give us a small bit of control so that worse things weren’t done to us. I know that there were things in the original drafts that had even Tony worried, but he never told me what they were.”
Okay, so it definitely has something to do with a special event then. And it’s probably something that Howard and Maria forgot that they shouldn’t have. Seeing as how Tony isn’t married and doesn’t have a kid, he’d be willing to bet it’s
“Oh no, darling,” Tony laughed, getting up and extending a hand to Steve. “You’re going to join me.”
“Janet,” Tony interrupts, the lights flickering as his temper flares. “Out of the three people in this room, two of us have business degrees and one of us has actually owned and run their own store before, and
“I’m good,” Tony assures him. “Very green.”
“That’s me: mechanic and professional menace,” Tony says cheerfully.
He plucks two ice cubes from the bowl. One of them, he places it in Tony’s bared navel. “Keep it there,” he instructs. “Don’t let it slide.” The other cube, he traces around Tony’s nipples, alternating between using the cold ice and his warm mouth. Tony pants his name, hands clenching and unclenching in the sheets, but he stays still, keeping the ice as still as he can while it melts.
have a son.
Tony started to laugh as he slid off Steve's lap to sit next to him, "Subtle, Nat. Really subtle."
"Remember to find out who it is before you answer the door," Tony yelled at Peter walking out of the kitchen.
"Missed you too, Papa. We made pa-sketti," Peter carefully said.
"Not only did he not have to pick up his toys, he milked you out of an extra story," Tony shook his head as he continued to pick up toys. "Smart kid."
"Hmm-hmm." Nat gave them both a sly look.
“Good morning, sweetheart,” Steve reached up and stroked Tony’s arm then quickly rolled over to shut the alarm on his phone off.
One more chapter, then the epilogue!  Thanks for reading and for all the kind words!  You're the best!!
It took a few minutes for Tony to become accustomed to the sensation of Peter nursing to allow Tony to relax and return his thoughts to his dilemma.
Tony burst out laughing, "Wait a minute. You rewarded him for
Tony decided that it would be best to play along with whatever world he had found himself in until he could evaluate his position. And since this version of Steve seemed to find it perfectly normal to wake up next to Tony, it was unfortunately not
Steve took a deep breath. "Tony, I -"
"I don't think he understood the point of you coming to dinner," Tony quietly laughed, his insides home to a thousand butterflies.
Steve winked at him and broke into a large grin, "Be right back."
“Nervous?”
doing his chores?"
Tony pulled himself up into a sitting position. Why would Loki show him these things? Was he taunting him with things he couldn't have or truly offering him a gift of knowing what could be?
"It was good," Steve gave another kiss to Peter and set him down, following Tony into the kitchen. "I think I finally convinced Mr. Dominic to let me move forward with the virtual tour concept."
"If anyone can do it, it's you," Tony swatted Steve on the arm and gestured towards the salad, "Why don't you take that to the table and then grab your son to clean up for dinner?"
Tony laughed at himself, lifting Peter to his nipple. Sure enough, Peter knew just what to do and quickly latched on to eat.
"Go. Spend some time with your son. He has to go to bed soon. I got these."
"I told you from day one that things are going to go at your speed. I already know my feelings," Tony said as he let his hand run down Steve's arm.
"But one screen - one screen caught my eye. The one I'm looking at in this picture. You see, someone must have caught you on video walking in Times Square and it was being broadcast on that screen.
"Natasha gave Peter Spot shortly after we moved in here. Peter was having trouble sleeping, probably from all the moving around that we had been doing the month before. She told Peter the reason she got the giraffe is because they only need 5 to 20 minutes of sleep in 24 hours, so that meant Spot could guard him all night long and he could sleep. And Petey has had Spot the guard giraffe ever since."
Tony turned Peter around and lightly swatted his behind, “Get your shoes.”
Thanks so much for the kind response to Chapter 1.  You are all so kind with your comments and I love it!!!  I will try to update every couple days.  Thanks again for reading!
Steve.
Tony knows that Steve asked him a question, but for the life of him he couldn't remember what it was or even if he had already answered it. All he could see was Steve's pink lips a few inches from his own.
Tony looked to the side with a half grin and nodded slowly. It was the one photo he was drawn back to when he was there - the same photo he had stared at everyday here - the same photo that the Steve of his dream confessed that 'it was written all over his face'. But only Steve himself would know what the thousand words that particular picture was worth, that is if Loki were to be trusted.
"I don't know if I can put a label on it. But whatever you were looking at made you so full of happiness." Tony looked down saying to himself,
Tony looked at Steve in surprise, "You too?"
"Hmmm," Steve hummed in Tony's ear again. "That's better. You smell like honey just before your heat." Steve pulled back to look Tony in the eye. "Let me get Peter so you can nurse him, and then I can take care of
The little giggles that erupted from Peter filled Tony with pure joy. Tony looked down at the baby blue eyes that were now staring back at him, "He's so beautiful."
Tony shook his head, "A woman and an orb -"
Tony knew all too well what Steve was talking about with eyes, but it wasn't in relationship to Peter. Tony stared into the original set of blue eyes that blessed his life and began to melt. He knows that he promised himself that he'd let Steve make the first move, but his resolve was almost gone.
"I'm coming in the apartment now," Natasha's voice bellowed out from the hallway.
"Just like you," Steve kissed Tony on the cheek, "I'm going to take a quick shower while you feed Peter, okay?"
"Natasha really is a good friend. You and Peter are lucky to have her," Steve said as he started walking over to the couch, "By the way where is Natasha?”
"What do you remember?"
Tony put his hand on Steve's, and a wicked grin crossed his face, " Have you ever seen Titanic?"
The next five seconds would be engraved in Tony's brain forever. Tony looked into Steve's ocean eyes and saw all the love that had been there once before. The guardedness, the uncertainty, gone. He watched as Steve's gaze moved between Tony's lips and his eyes and how Steve started to lean in towards Tony's lips for a long overdue kiss.
"Papa," Peter yelled from the living room. "It's time for our video call."
There were a few hand drawn pictures adorning the walls and a half dozen photographs scattered about the room. The drawings were cityscapes of various places around New York- a skyline view from the penthouse, a sketch of the statue that had been erected by the city depicting all the Avengers, and an ink sketch of the Brooklyn bridge. The fourth sketch had obviously never been meant to be displayed like this. Its frayed edge along the top of the sheet suggested that it had been ripped from a sketch pad and then framed. It was a simple drawing of Tony, lying naked on a couch, replicating the infamous scene from Titanic. The portrait was definitely drawn with loving hands - and somehow Steve had managed to even make his scars look alluring.
"When she found out that my class was canceled and she didn't have to watch Peter, she called a couple of her girlfriends for a movie."
"I can get it," Tony waved Steve off. "You worked all day."
"So, I'm the reason that these toys are still on the floor in the first place. Go sit down." Steve ordered and pointed to the couch.
Thanks again for all your positive comments and kudos...I love them all - you guys are the best!  Hope you enjoy this chapter!!
Steve, the man he had been dreaming about for five years was sitting on the couch next to him, with no 4-year-old in between them. They were alone for the first time since that day so long ago.
Tony's head was pounding and his heart was racing once again. But this time there was no beeping. Tony took a deep breath and started to open his eyes.
Steve nodded and looked Tony in the eyes. "I remember that I was in bed with an alarm going off. So I open my eyes and I, uh-," Steve avoided eye contact with Tony.
Once again, thanks to all my beautiful readers, commenters, and kudo leavers!  You are the best.
“I’m making a grocery list because Papa’s coming for dinner tonight.” Tony kissed Peter on the cheek and gave him a quick hug, “So I need you to get your shoes on so we can go to the store.”
Pictures? He saw a lot of pictures in his vision, but which one was Loki referring to? The drawings? The photos? Tony started to catalogue it all in his head. Tony let out a slight chuckle and started nodding to himself when his mind reached the last picture he saw before returning here.
Peter rubbed his stomach, “Yummy.”
Tony began to search his mind for any explanation as to what happened between the woman appearing in their kitchen and this moment, but nothing came to him. Was he dreaming? Was he in an alternate timeline? Or could he not actually remember what events led him to be sharing a bed with Steve?
"I was only out for a minute. I - uh," Steve stuttered, "I guess because I didn't directly touch the orb, just your shoulder when you touched it, but you've been out for about an hour."
"Nat already bathed him so he will be ready for a nap once he eats," Steve set Peter in Tony's arms. "So you better eat up little man," Steve gently poked Peter in the belly, making him squirm with laughter. "Aunt Nat is waiting for you."
"Then why didn't you?"
Tony turned to her, "I'd say so."
Dream or reality? Tony couldn't tell. His eyes searched the room for clues, when he remembered - he felt the ring finger of his left hand and found nothing and his heart sank. How could he be heartbroken over a dream?
See you next time!
Steve moved forward and sat on the floor with Tony helping with the plastic blocks, "I know, here let me get that."
"Ah." Steve paused, "I am sorry about not making Peter put his toys away. He just gives you those eyes." Steve sat down on the couch next to Tony and turned to face him, "You know what I mean? About his eyes?"
Tony punched a few buttons on his phone, "So, I saw you before you saw me and, um, you just had this look on your face - so I snapped a picture of you." Tony turned the phone to show Steve, "This picture. In my dream, you told me when I showed this to you," Tony nodded at the phone, "You knew that you couldn't hide it from me any longer. That it was written all over your face. Does that mean something to you?"
"Hey Petey, I missed you." Steve pulled back to look Peter in the face.
"I think so, um," Tony took a deep breath and dug his phone out of his pocket. "Remember a month or so ago when we met for lunch in Times Square?"
"Tony?" Steve softly called his name.
Tony brow furrowed, waiting for Steve to finish his explanation.
"I know, I know - Is that you Papa?" Peter asked the door, making Tony roll his eyes.
Lost in thought, he was startled by the noise that came from the living room.
"Spot?" Tony smiled, thinking of the giraffe that Peter slept with every single night.
Steve's head jerked up and then he nodded again, "Yeah. I only saw you for a few seconds and then I was back here next to you in the kitchen - then I carried you in here."
Steve smiled
Tony loved the time they all spent together and the flurry of activity that each weekend brought, but it wasn’t often that they were able to enjoy a quiet evening at home, just the three of them. It was so domestic and it made Tony feel like that someday this could be his forever.
Tony knelt down to pick up the stack of Legos and put them in their container. "He has you wrapped around his little finger."
"You're both going to turn into noodles," Tony said as he approached the twosome, giving Steve a chaste kiss on the cheek. "How was your day?"
he was, was pushed aside and taken over by pure bliss.
Tony remained starry-eyed as he watched Steve head down the hallway.
Steve walked up to Tony. “Somebody looks ready for his nap now. Here, let me take him back to Nat," Steve reached down and scooped up a yawning Peter. "And don't worry, she's letting JARVIS monitor her apartment while she has Peter. He'll let us know if there's anything wrong."
"So you've never told me. How did a giraffe become Peter's nighttime guard dog?"
Steve put his hands on his hips as he looked back at the bedroom he had just put Peter in, "Damn."
"Just a dream," Tony said fondly. "The most vivid dream I've ever had."
Tony could feel his pulse begin to quicken, trying to think of how to respond to Steve when Steve pulled Tony down to lay back on the bed and cupped Tony’s face, rubbing his thumb over his jawline.
Tony nodded, not able to take his eyes off the bundle in his arm when Steve left the room. From the chubby little cheeks to the soft brown hair on Peter's head, Tony was completely in love.
Tony leaned his head forward until their foreheads met, "Me too."
“You know, this is going to be your first heat since Peter was born and I know you’ve been -” Steve rubbed up and down Tony's arm. “Well, a little self conscious about the baby weight.”
The last thing Tony remembered was standing in the communal kitchen next to Steve, reaching for a cup of coffee, when a being had materialized on the other side of the room. The entity had appeared to be a young woman, and she had made eye contact with both Tony and Steve, a smile ever present on her face and warmth in her eyes. The intruder had said nothing when Steve and Tony had attempted to communicate, but rather had held out her hand, which contained a golden ball floating above her palm. Tony had been immediately intrigued by the mechanical looking sphere and had reached for it. He could vaguely remember Steve attempting to stop him from reaching for the object by placing his hand on his shoulder and pulling him backwards, but Tony had been drawn to the ball and could not resist it. The moment the ball had made contact with the palm of Tony’s hand, there had been a flash of light and then everything had gone black.
"Figure it out?" Steve looked hopefully at Tony.
Tony tried to return as much love in his eyes as he was receiving from Steve. Tony leaned into Steve turning the chaste kiss gradually into something more desperate.
Only the epilogue left!  Thanks to everyone who has read this little adventure!  You're the best.
"Are you sure?" Tony could tell that it wasn't really a question.
"Be right back.”
Tony brought his attention back to Steve, "What happened?"
“You are going to turn into a noodle,” Tony laughed knowing that Peter would always ask for spaghetti for dinner.
Tony looked up at the clock, "Peter, it's 10 minutes to bedtime. Start cleaning up."
“Can we have ‘sketti?” Peter hopped off Tony's lap and turned to stand between Tony’s legs.
"I was looking at you on that screen - knowing you were coming to me - and I realized how much you've come to mean to me.” Steve moved his hand to Tony's cheek, "And thinking that I might be falling for my best friend."
Peter's eyes grew, "Mine, too."
Thanks once again to everyone that left kudos or comments!  They all kept me very motivated!  I hope you enjoyed their little follow-up!
smile at Tony and put his finger under Tony's chin to lift his face in Steve's direction. "I remember that day - I remember waiting for you in front of that diner, looking around at how much everything has changed, all the flashiness of it all. At least a dozen different scenes all being broadcast at once.
of those people are you, so do you think you can take all those fancy terms you’re learning from your textbook and fuck off for a second?”
“Oh.” Tony looks like he’s puzzling through that. “You know she doesn’t do it on purpose, right?”
“So I’ll meet you at the motel in an hour?”
Who’s Justin? He stays quiet, hoping his silence will invite Tony to explain. He’s not disappointed.
Tony rolled his eyes but let the argument drop, taking his own seat across from Steve and motioning Betty to the only empty seat at the table. Steve, knowing from his research that she’d never appeared on a radio show before, waited for her to look over at him before he pointedly picked up his headphones, put them on, and then pulled his microphone closer. Betty quickly followed suit, shooting a quick grateful smile, and with thirty seconds to air, they were completely ready to go.
Tony: Okay, let me get this straight: you and your husband work at the same place.
“Don’t wanna go to bed,” Morgan insists stubbornly.
Yeah, Steve had no argument with that part of the rumor either, only with Pierce cancelling their show with no warning.
Tony: Hi, thanks for calling in to
“Janet, I get that you’re trying to help,” Steve starts, thinking that maybe this critique shouldn’t be coming from Tony’s sister.
“No. I’m too hot.”
Steve beamed at him. “That’s my boy.”
“Tony—
That’s news to Steve, though since he hasn’t heard from Bucky in a while, he supposes he can’t be too shocked. “Yeah?”
“You sure?” Clint asks. “I don’t mind.”
“Good,” Captain America says. He sounds bewildered. “We needed you to come anyway. SHIELD’s going to want to debrief with you.”
For whatever reason, that’s the conversation he’s thinking of when Nat shows up at the team’s safehouse three days after Steve breaks the team out of the Raft. She’s welcomed with open arms, hugs from those closest to her and a friendly wave from Scott, who doesn’t know her at all. Even Steve hugs her, murmuring his thanks for coming to join them.
“I don’t like them,” he grumbles, slowly climbing out of his snowbank. Even so, he concentrates hard on making a set of clothes appear, the same colors as his scales. They pop into existence, covering him from view. He scowls at the constricting feeling, but reminds himself that he has to have clothes on if he wants Steve to look at him, which he does. He always wants Steve to be looking at him, just like he always wants to look at Steve.
He nods quickly. At the moment, Natasha doesn’t seem like the kind of person to disagree with.
“Hi!” Steve said cheerfully. “Don’t you two look adorable!”
“I can’t—I have to go.” He snatched his bag off the chair, not caring that it was still unzipped and things were falling out of it. “I can’t talk about this with you right now.”
“I know,” Tony murmurs. “But my parents are still dead, Steve.”
who can’t possibly be legal, smiling at him in a pair of leggings and an oversized hoodie with the hood drawn up to protect him from the rain. He’s carrying a small duffel bag at his side and Steve’s mind blanks at the realization of what’s inside—at what
It was the beginning of the end. They’d argued for months, about Steve’s proposal, about Tony’s job offer, about long-distance relationships, all the way up to their lease expiring, and when Tony moved, he told Steve they were done.
Tony: I told you about that in confidence, you son of a biscuit eater!
Steve: That sounds like they’re being really controlling. Have you—
“I’m not much of a kid anymore.”
“You went back in
“Tony’s not a dick,” Steve replied. “He’d probably let anyone stay over.” He didn’t add that the reason he never took Tony up on the offer was because
But this is Tony’s choice. He’d be well within his right to let Howard drown in his mistake, gods know the man has never done a thing for him, but he cares too much to let that happen. Steve wouldn’t like him so much if he didn’t.
“It is, because we’re here together and I love you.”
He startles, not having realized that there’s someone else in the store with him. Turning, he sees a pretty, petite brunette in a bright yellow sundress standing a few feet away from him, hands on her hips.
“Watch me,” Tony grumbles, but he turns off the computer and agrees to join Uncle Grant and Aunt Peggy for a movie. He’s glad they decided to stick around the mansion with him for the summer instead of jetting off to Paris with his parents. Tony doesn’t mind when his parents decide to take off for a romantic getaway—they love him, he knows this, but he also knows he can be a lot—but rattling around the mansion by himself for almost a month can get kind of lonely. He’s excited for the fall when he goes off to MIT. Hard to feel lonely on a campus with thousands of other people, right?
Tony nods. “Got it in one.”
She turns pensive, looking back out at the sunset. “Are you thinking about signing?”
getting hurt. But I take that back now. I really hope you’re right that Tony isn’t interested in getting back together cause really, Stevie, that was just low.”
. There are shelves of potion ingredients, as well as fully-finished glittering potions that softly glow in the low light. There are a series of cauldrons along one wall, two of which look like they have potions bubbling away in them. There’s a spellbook on a stand in the corner and a small plush couch beside it. And Tony himself is standing over the spellbook, elegant fingers trailing down a list of ingredients.
“Steve,” Tony said flatly. “I
His silence must have caught Tony’s attention because the laughter suddenly dies away. Something warm grabs onto his hands in his lap, and when Steve looks down, he realizes that it’s Tony’s own hands. Tony squeezes them, smiling up at Steve warmly.
Steve blinks at him. “Are you—”
“What’ve you been up to today?” he asks Tony’s shoulders, unable to look any higher than the tiny straps he can spot underneath Tony’s shirt.
Tony’s face lights up, breathtaking and beautiful and so close Steve wants to reach out to touch, only he doesn’t know if he’s allowed to. “Steve, I don’t know how long you’re going to be running. I don’t even know if you’re ever going to come home, but Steve, I don’t want to waste this chance. We’re working on building something better, we talk, and yeah, we don’t always agree, but really who does? Neither of us needs an echo chamber, I’ve got plenty of those on the board and they just make me miserable, but
had issues with letting people know when he wasn’t happy with something. He was one of the most dramatic people Steve knew. He didn’t know why Bucky was so convinced that Tony was trying to make it more than it was.
Laughter sounded again, much closer that time and continuing for much longer than Tony felt the joke needed. He wanted to look around but found himself nodding instead as though it was fine (it
Steve nods, taking the rebuke stoically, even as he’s impressed by the fact that Tony apparently has three degrees. He can see how his comment would have made Tony defensive. “Sorry, I stand corrected.” He glances around the room, taking in all the boxes and half-unwrapped potions and the way Janet seemingly hasn’t even broken a sweat. “You know, if you need help, I’m happy to offer my services.”
“I don’t know why you listen to their podcast.”
By the time Luis stops chatting, it’s late evening, the waffles have gone cold, and Steve has definitely lost his window for calling Tony about the business license. He grimaces at the cold waffles and resigns himself to thoughts of dinner at the café, just as soon as he gets all the paperwork done. Most of it absolutely had to get done today and he was counting on using the afternoon to finish it all, and maybe get ahead on tomorrow’s workload, but it looks like he’ll be working late into the evening instead.
Trying to move on from that awkward moment, he says, “Here’s an easy one for you: a brief description of the business.”
“Thanks, Thor,” he mutters.
“People actually want these?” she asks.
The crowd cheers.
Steve’s car was already in the garage, so he must have gotten home from the studio early that day. Steve was an artist, an incredibly talented one who’d sold multiple paintings to big galleries in New York, though he’d been having a stroke of rough luck over the last week. Things just kept going wrong every time he tried to ship one of his paintings out of Westview. Tony couldn’t figure it out.
Steve smiled. “Anytime,” he said honestly.
“Welcome home, Sir,” JARVIS says in the background, sounding just as muted as the rest of the city. He doesn’t know how JARVIS is still working through the blackout, but he suspects Tony must have housed the AI’s servers somewhere off the main power grid. Steve turns, just as Tony trudges into the kitchen. He’s sweaty and filthy, his suit pants streaked with oil and grease, the expensive white silk shirt he’d put on that morning nearly transparent in all its sweat-soaked glory. Steve finds his attention catching and holding on the shirt and whatever red… something, Steve can’t tell what, Tony is wearing underneath.
“—these?” the redhead is asking as Steve steps inside.
Ana continues to whisper her story to the boy, stroking his dark curls as Tony settles back down. It’s only a few minutes before Tony is fully asleep again, and Ana bends over his crib to put him down. She lingers for a moment, brushing a sweet kiss across his forehead, and Maria is reminded with a pang that Ana and Edwin had tried for years to have a child. Well, it’s clear that Tony adores her just as much as he does Maria, and if there’s enough love in that boy’s heart to go around, then she thinks she can learn to share her bright boy.
“Hey, hey, none of that,” he murmurs and pulls Tony back in. “’m not angry with you.”
“You can safeword out,” Steve points out mildly.
“You look that determined,” he corrects. “Only determined people drink black coffee.”
Steve is a man of simple pleasures. He knows what he likes and what he likes is Tony in the expensive lingerie he so clearly prefers to wear under his suits instead of the briefs Steve wears.
“But you stopped it,” he clarifies.
“So what are you going to do?”
She smiles tightly. “Not back then I didn’t. I don’t regret what Clint did, but if he’s stopped to think for a minute instead of acting on his instincts, he would have known to shoot instead.”
Steve smiled sheepishly. “No, maybe not.”
Steve woke to something—some
Steve: There’s no “in confidence” in radio, Tony, and I’m going to tell my mom you said that about her.
“You know, that’s not exactly a ringing endorsement,” Steve says dryly, but Bucky brushes him off.
“Sir has spent most of the last two days in bed. He came down with a sinus infection yesterday.”
He carefully shifts Tony off his lap and stands before bending down to scoop Tony into his arms. It’s hard, trying to get back through the open window and into Tony’s room without dropping him, but he manages it. He’d never drop Tony, not this darling boy. He adores him too much to let any harm come to him.
Tony nods slowly, but thankfully he looks more amused than offended. “That’s really nice of you to say.”
“Happy to be home?” Steve asks, softly enough that it won’t disturb Morgan.
him!”
funny, I just got caught up in my head.”
“Sure it is! It’s my
They did end up going to the shelter later that afternoon, choosing to walk since it was such a beautiful day. Turned out they weren’t the only ones who had animals on the brain. Wanda’s two boys were playing in the front yard with what looked like a dog of their own.
“Alright, darling. Guess we need a shower, don’t we.”
you wearing a shower cap?” Steve interrupts. Up until this point, he’d just thought Tony was wearing an odd hat, one of his many interesting sartorial choices, but now that Natasha has pointed it out, he doesn’t know how he missed it.
“So they catch bad dreams?”
“Strange,” he admits, almost without meaning to but then again, Carol has that effect on people.
“Guess you’ll just have to make it up to me next Halloween, huh.”
Tony watched him nervously, not saying that they didn’t have to, but Steve knew that he meant it all the same. It was obvious in the way his fingers drummed against the wood next to Steve’s head and in the way his other hand twitched on Steve’s hip like he wanted to reach for something (his sunglasses, Steve’s mind provided, like he had when they were younger and might still; Steve wouldn’t know, they only spent a few hours each day together).
was what he’d been trying to tell Bucky. This was what he’d thought Tony had known all along, and now that they were on the same page. “If you’re really sure, I—Tony,
And for the first time since he met Tony Stark, Steve finds that he can breathe easy.
“Good, cause, you know, some people don’t know that and—it’s not like Janet does it deliberately, and it really hurts her when people assume she has to use her abilities to get dates. She really tries not to but she ended up missing the whole part of her classes about learning how to use them because she was in Libya and it was this whole thing. Anyway, she’s catching up on most of the classes she missed in high school, but there’s only one school in the world that works with succubi and that’s in France, and well. We obviously can’t afford to send her to France these days so—”
“Hi, Tony.” Is he imagining it or does Steve’s smile turn a little shy when he sees him? Excited, Tony can’t help that he bursts into flames. Steve just makes him feel like that. Steve laughs. “Oh, it’s like that, is it?” He conjures up a pile of snow.
For a brief instant, Tony had a flash of a much smaller Steve, one whose thin chest heaved every time he coughed. But the image was gone as soon as it had appeared in his mind and his strong, healthy husband was back. He leaned in and nuzzled Steve’s nose, gently nudging against it until Steve huffed and kissed him softly. They lingered there, breathing in each other’s air for a long moment.
Steve frowned. That—that couldn’t be right. Babies didn’t just magically age ten years overnight. Tony had to be misremembering it, getting Wanda’s boys mixed up with someone else’s kids. That was the only logical explanation. And yet… As Steve thought about it, he could remember—rain falling indoors, a black and white lamp… Tony, young and beautiful and not Steve’s at all. And—
Tony jams his hands in his pockets. “I know. I want to hear what you say when he’s not standing right there.”
Tony rescues the robot—affectionately named Dummy, of course—and hands it back to her. “A real one, huh?” He knows so many: stories his mother told him or ones from Ana and Jarvis or that he’d heard from Aunt Peggy or Rhodey or Steve. He decides on one he thinks he remembers Ana sharing with him once. “There once was a great rabbi, who had a dream one night.”
fic, which means that it's being written to one person's likes and one person's likes only. I'm not going to change what I've written just because you're not happy with it. I'm sorry that some of you seem to think that Steve is the only one who can fuck up in a relationship or that Tony being hurt means I should make Steve hurt just as much, but I'm not going to write that. If you're not enjoying this story, you're not required to read it. There are plenty of Steve-bashing fics out there for you to read and enjoy. There's no need for you to come onto my story and leave me hate.
“Look,” he says, cutting Tony’s rambles off, “these are all some really great buzzwords, and you seem pretty clear on what you
“I could,” Steve said. “If that’s something you’d like.”
Steve: Anyway, so you make this grand gesture, except you forget that she’s allergic to strawberries. And the chocolates have to be eaten within a week in order to be good, except they arrived a month before your anniversary. And as for the giant bunny? Well, that’s just plain weird.
. Now, I want everything to look perfect, and if you’re only going to complain about my hard work, then I think it would be best if you waited for your husband backstage.”
“He probably—”
“Thanks for telling us,” he said hastily, before Tony could do anything drastic (like throttle Pierce). “We’ll get out of your hair.”
thinking about women, not to get caught up with another one. He takes another step away, ignoring the way Janet pouts. Tony snickers, quickly schooling his face when Janet turns her glare on him.
“Just tonight,” Tony murmurs. “We can pretend we’re not fighting, pretend it’s like it used to be in the tower.”
“You can—”
A little furrow appears between Tony’s brow. Steve has the strangest urge to want to smooth it away. “Janet isn’t here today,” Tony says instead.
Steve hums, reaching into the freezer long enough to grab a few ice cubes that he dumps into a bowl. “So were you able to fix any of the generators?”
In the ensuing ringing silence, Tony cautiously raises his head. “Did I get him?” he asks, only to spot Captain America staring dumbstruck at the fallen Loki.
“That’s not a unilateral decision, that’s the logical next step after dating for three years. I’d been bringing up rings for months. You
“Relax Tony,” Steve says. “For one thing, Natasha knows you’re with me. If I was going to murder you, I’d pick less suspicious circumstances.”
“Okay,” Tony says slowly, clearly thinking it over. Steve tries not to fidget under Tony’s piercing gaze. “In that case, thank you for your—investment offer, right? You’re investing in this?”
Steve was fine with that. He didn’t want their house to turn into a museum either. He just sometimes wished Tony had a little more pride in how their home looked. So maybe they didn’t have people over very often and they weren’t trying to impress anyone. It was still a point of pride.
More of that laughter.
Maria, I would shop here, even without the irritating sense of obligation.”
“Yeah,” Steve says thoughtfully, tapping his tablet against the palm of his hand. “Something like that.”
Six months later, Steve steps off the quinjet, his team following him, to greet the Accords committee waiting for them at a small folding table off to the side of the landing platform with four copies of the Accords waiting for their signatures. Bucky signed a week ago, having decided to stay in Wakanda for the time being. The committee steps forward, passing the four of them their copies. Sam’s copy, Steve notices, is considerably lighter, as he won’t be joining the team as a full member for a while, if ever. Steve glances behind the committee to see an older man in a wheelchair—that would be Professor Xavier then, going off of Tony’s descriptions, here to take Wanda back to his school so she can get the training she deserves. And standing beside him—
“But I want you to be,” Tony says confusedly.
Steve had been finishing up a contract with a morning radio show when Alexander Pierce had approached him about jumping ship to his station, Hydra Programming. He’d floated the idea of two hosts, called Mr. Right and Mr. Right Now, who would argue with each other about the best way to handle relationships, offer advice for those who were unlucky in love, and generally provide entertainment for listeners about their conflicting opinions.
Tony was a night owl, Steve was an early bird. Steve kept everything neat and orderly, Tony didn’t understand why the floor couldn’t function as a second closet. Tony wanted to have people over every single weekend, Steve just wanted to study. In their first month of living together, they’d racked up combined seventy-three complaints about each other and the RA was at their wits’ end. Steve had been ready to put in a request to change roommates; fuck, he would have paid
—warm draped over his chest. It took him a moment to realize what it was. There were dreams lingering in the corners of his mind, nightmares of people turning to dust before his eyes, of aliens pouring through a portal in the sky, and always that oppressive grief that he couldn’t shake away, no matter how hard he tried. But there were softer, sweeter dreams too, dreams that felt so real, he thought he could reach out and touch them—a fresh-faced young man holding his hand out and cheerfully saying, “Hi! I’m Tony,” an older woman who reminded him of himself smiling warmly at him as she kissed his forehead, someone hugging him in all the chaos of people reappearing.
“So, Steve, tell me, what brings you all this way from across the street?” Tony asks nonchalantly. This is more familiar territory for him. This is just Tony teasing him, and he can handle that.
He’s still thinking about it that night when he gets into bed. He’s still wondering if he did the right thing. There’s no doubt in his mind that signing the Accords, as they are right now, would have been a bad decision but he thinks about Tony and he just…
Uncle Grant makes a sound like he doesn’t believe him. Tony just counts himself lucky that Uncle Grant can’t see him. He’s got a great poker face to everyone but his family. His uncle, especially, has always been good at figuring out when he’s not telling the whole truth.
This chapter is pretty much nothing but smut, so fair warning for the smut-averse ahead. Feel free to pick back up after the first line break
“Actually, I played them for a few friends of mine. Thought they might like to hear them.” He thinks Tony might actually choke at that so he breaks into an easy smile and says, “Tony, relax, I’m kidding. I just played them for me and Luis here.”
“No,” Steve automatically denies. Then he grimaces. “Maybe. I—we didn’t even really get a chance to understand what we were saying no to.”
As Thor leaves, Tony turns to him. Steve thinks it’ll be about his birthday but instead Tony says abruptly, “Isn’t Jane’s birthday in two weeks?”
“Fuck,” he swears.
U’s personality—just like DUM-E’s, Butterfingers’, and JARVIS’—has a backup stored on an offsite computer at SI’s facility in Switzerland. Tony will need to fabricate another personality chip, but at least the coding he uploads onto it will be the same lovable, clumsy bot it’s always been. The problem is, he doesn’t know when he’s going to make it out to Switzerland.
He wants to ask about the clean mouth comment but Tony clearly isn’t paying any attention to him. And even if he is, it’s more fun to bug Tony by not asking when Tony clearly wants him to. Instead he just lifts the water bottle to his lips and drinks, trying not to think that Tony had his mouth right where Steve’s is now. He doesn’t quite manage it though, especially not once he notices that Tony is openly staring at him.
He finally approached her, offering that crooked smile Tony used to love so much. “Hi,” he said, maybe a little awkwardly but at least most people seemed to take that as endearing.
friend—”
“And thanks, by the way. Definitely couldn’t have done it without you.”
“You want to see something cool?” Tony asks. Steve barely manages to nod before Tony has extinguished the lights with a wave of his hand. A beat passes and then the store lights up with a thousand tiny galaxies, drifting through starlit space.
“Yeah?” Tony asks, gratefully seizing on the subject change. “What about them? You read them?”
“Pizza? I could get it delivered?”
“We’ve had a visitor,” T’Challa says, turning to walk inside once they’re alone. “I thought you would be interested in seeing him again.”
Vision went white. “I’m not,” he stammered. “I’m a very hardworking employee.”
He just—he didn’t know why it was bothering him so much. So Tony was thinking about moving on and finding a different show; who cared? So Steve was going to lose his convenient relationship and would have to start all over again with someone else; who cared? So that someone would be someone new that Steve didn’t have a history with and wouldn’t know his history and definitely wouldn’t know how he took his very particular coffee order and—no.
He hopes, though, that it has something to do with the way Steve smiles at him sometimes, shy and a little thoughtful, mostly because Tony sometimes smiles at
Out of the corner of his eye, he thought he saw something flash red but when he looked, all he saw was the gray nightstand as always. His next thought was about his very productive day at work, and when he looked over at Steve again, his only thought was how right it felt, how it felt like they’d always known and loved each other.
“Preparing?”
“Well, the UN’s not going to let her out if she can’t control her powers.”
“Because I brought coffee,” Steve reminds him. “That was the rule
Steve sets his bag down and when he looks back up, Tony is standing right in front of him, so close Steve could count every long lash blinking at him. “Uh,” he says, wondering if he should take a step back. Tony catches hold of his arm, keeping him right there.
Maybe that was why Tony was thinking about leaving. Maybe he didn’t think he’d ever be able to get over his feelings for Steve—ironic, when he couldn’t wait to get out of there when they were actually together—so he wanted to leave the show. But—but they were friends. Surely Tony knew that. Surely he didn’t think he had to run away just to get away from Steve, even if that was what he’d done fifteen years ago.
U chirps quietly, and while it doesn’t sound
“You think?” Tony asks. “I wasn’t sure, since Howard liked it.”
Tony hums. “At a glance, yes. At least more reasonable than what Ross has been trying to bring to the table, and I think that’ll relieve the committee a bit. But I don’t know how much will manage to get passed. People get hung up on the craziest things sometimes, and I don’t want to promise you something I may not be able to keep. Have you thought about what you’ll do if these
we should be worried about.”
“And she loved him?” Tony whispers.
Steve is.
Tony let out a yelp that he would absolutely deny later and whirled around. “I thought you were outside!” he said, poking a finger at Steve’s chest accusingly. Something flashed red in the corner of his vision, but he was too distracted by Steve to pay much attention to it. “Why didn’t you answer me the first time?” He poked him again.
“What he did, what he’s
, inviting Steve to come play. There was a time when Steve would always come out to join him when he invited him, but Steve doesn’t do that now. He just turns back to the human leader and asks her another question. Tony can’t sigh in this form, but he wants to. He curls into a tighter circle and closes his eyes, wishing that Steve would leave the village. He misses talking to him.
about Tony that makes Steve’s breath catch in his throat.
“Yeah, see you then,” Bucky agreed. “Don’t think we’ve forgotten about Tony.”
Well that’s a little hurtful. What is Steve, chopped liver? Except… he knows that Tony compartmentalizes people. The vet can’t be Tony’s friend because he’s already Janet’s. Rhodey can’t be his friend because he works with Howard. Steve can’t be his friend because they’re already business partners. Steve knows why he does it: it’s an attempt at minimizing the hurt when someone does something deliberately cruel. If they weren’t friends, it won’t hurt as much, right? Not for the first time he wishes he could punch everyone who’s ever made Tony feel bad about himself.
Unless something goes wrong.
Tony groaned again and tilted his head back to the ceiling. “I hate Focus on the Family,” he said grumpily.
Steve exchanged a confused look with Tony. “Not that I can think of,” he said slowly. “Strange how?”
Caller: Yes, that’s correct.
They both turn toward the door at the same time. The knock comes again, followed by someone saying, “Mr. Stark? Mr. Rogers? Are you in there?”
“You are at that.”
“Yeah, except your breakup was so bad, you guys worked on opposite sides of the country for ten
He allows himself a fond smile. “I’d like that.”
“Let’s start with the name of the business,” he suggests. The first part of the form is actually personal details like Tony’s name and birthday but Steve is too curious to know what Tony plans on opening to start with those.
Bucky was wrong.
“I’m fine,” Steve said.
“Yeah, that’s enough, Tones,” he says quietly, pressing a quick kiss onto Tony’s hair. “So—uh—I was reading this short story for my literature class. You wanna hear it?”
“I found something for you,” he tells Steve instead. He fishes around in his pockets—the only good things about clothes—for wherever it went to when he summoned the clothes. “Aha!” He pulls it out and holds it out for Steve to take.
this will be okay?”
She doesn’t even startle at his approach, sneaky spy that she is. She just leans her head against his shoulder. “Like is the wrong word,” she says eventually. “I didn’t like the Accords. I still don’t like them. But the Accords were going to happen either with us or to us. There was no escaping them, no Tony mocking them into submission, no funny quips that would make the UN drop the whole thing. And I thought the idea of accountability was a good one.”
With that thought firmly fixed in his mind, he pulled his fingers out—perhaps a little earlier than he should have, but he liked the sting—double checked the condom Tony was wearing, and sank down on Tony’s cock. It took a moment—Tony’s cock wasn’t overly long, but it was
“Would you like a ride back to your place?” Tony offered. “I won’t be much faster than the subway, but at least my car is less crowded.”
Aw, fuck. Tony’s spent most of his life dodging SHIELD, wanting nothing to do with his dad and aunt’s pet organization. But of course Captain America got wrapped up in it. He’d be willing to bet they’re the ones who fished him out of the ice and, for lack of anything else to do, he joined up with them.
“What?” Bucky asks, puzzled. He looks between the four of them. “Why do you need my opinion?”
to lose hope—but it’s rough every time JARVIS sends him a notification that he’s crossed one off the list because yet another Steve has found their soulmate. He’s happy for them, really he is, but he’d like to know where
He said he was going to stop thinking about that and he is. He just needs something to do. Like going through the checklist he’d prepared earlier in the month to make sure they would be Opening Day Ready.
“Pretty sure.”
“Shut up,” he hisses at his husband. “You’re no help.”
“Me neither,” Tony said. “Sounds better than sitting around my apartment though.”
Peggy scoffs. Of course he does, like Howard has ever behaved a day in his life. What is he teaching this boy? To try to live up to some impossible standard that no one, not even Steve, could ever keep? She suspects she knows the reason—it’s the same one that makes Howard keep pushing his son into the spotlight. He sees an heir where he should see his son.
“I’m sorry,” he says again. “I don’t know that I’ll ever be able to make up for it—”
Steve: [pause] Yeah. Yeah, I guess I would.
Like a once-in-a-century storm that causes the roof to cave in. Or robbers. Or a fire. Or—
They were halfway through the movie when Steve abruptly said, “We should go to the circus tomorrow.”
over, but Tony has never once complained, only just made easygoing jokes about bulls in china shops and told him that the pipes are built to withstand forces a lot stronger than Steve. It had gone a long way toward helping him feel comfortable in the space and now he spends a lot of time down here, talking with Tony about the mechanics of the ship, even though a lot of it goes over his head.
But he couldn’t do that. He knew what would happen if he let himself go back to Tony’s arms. If he stayed the night, it would lead to breakfast in the morning and that would lead to dinners together after work and
“What?”
“What, you can’t wash the stains out?”
He scrolled through his twitter tag, laughing at a picture someone had posted as “incontrovertible proof that stony are dating,” which was very clearly a photoshopped picture, and not a very good one at that. For one thing, neither he nor Tony would ever be caught dead at a Yankees game. Steve liked the Dodgers too much to betray them like that and Tony didn’t like baseball, period.
Steve should listen to his gut more often and Tony should listen to his friends.
“No, I am not locking you in our closet. Why do you ask?” Steve finally gets out.
The rest of the drive was silent and passed by quickly and soon enough Tony was in his bed and fell asleep before his pillow hit the head and he could forget about this awful night.
He moves down to his abdomen and let the leather hit there two times in a row. He takes in a sharp breath at the stinging sensation. Then Tony came into his space again and let one of his fingers trace around the nipple still being quiet and he isn’t sure if he likes it or not but there was something about the tense silence between them and just let their breathing and the sound of the leather hitting his skin that made Steve’s mind just go to mush it could also be the fact that he was in subspace and everything was nice and the only thing existing in his mind was pleasing Tony and making sure that Tony was proud of him. “The peak of the human species beneath my fingers and you would let me do anything to you right now if you knew it would make me happy wouldn’t you sweetheart?” A slight taunt comes through Tony’s lips and he knows deep in his core that Tony would never go outside his limits so he knows he can play along without concern about the consequences. Tony would bring him to the edge over and over again but never pushing him over the edge.
“We have
“And if you do decide to try a long-distance relationship, there’s a few ways that that can work. Celibacy and expensive plane tickets aren’t the only answer here. Maybe you two—or more, we don’t know what your relationship is like—talk about it and decide that an open relationship is the way to go.”
Steve hides a smile and stands, passing his pieces off to Clint, who’s losing worse than either Steve or Natasha. “Here, you can have mine. Not sure how long I’ll be down there.”
“Now, Rumlow tells me you might have heard some of the rumors about your show,” Pierce said, as though they could have somehow missed them.
“At the vet. It’s shots week.”
Steve groans good-naturedly. “Do we have to?”
“Bedtime would be a nightmare with or without the candy,” Steve said from the doorway. Tony turned to see him leaning up against the frame. “Seriously, have you ever met a kid who actually liked to go to bed?”
No dice then. This just isn’t his morning, huh? “Yes,” he lies, hoping Tony doesn’t push the issue.
“Rich people don’t worry about things like cultural appropriation,” Tony recites archly like it’s something he’s been told before, though his nose wrinkles, demonstrating his distaste at the whole concept of being too rich to care about other people’s thoughts.
“You wanna watch a bad sci-fi movie?” he asks, hoping to wipe that look from Tony’s face. “I won’t even complain when you make fun of the science.”
“Oh, I’m so sorry! I didn’t realize.”
“Thor?” Steve repeats. It’s been nearly two years without word from the god. He had assumed Thor was still traveling the Nine Realms, looking for word about whatever had so spooked him during the battle with Ultron and the Maximoffs. “He’s back?”
“Probably the same thing you’re doing,” Steve says, dropping down to sit beside Tony on the floor. “Couldn’t sleep. Figured I’d come in and do one last check before tomorrow. May I?” He gestures at the open water bottle next to Tony’s right leg.
Before he knew what he was doing, before he could stop himself, he had dialed Tony’s number. As soon as Tony picked up, Steve spat, “You’re a fucking piece of work, you know that, Stark?”
