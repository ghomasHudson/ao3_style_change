Dean was laying on the backseat of a strangers car but Dean was too tired to resist anymore he just let the strange person take him.
"She went missing two weeks ago, and nothing unusual happened, she went to stay at a friends house." Sam nodded at every piece of information he was given from the woman. Who Cas comforted every time she got upset. Dean just laid on the floor looking out the window.
Dean felt a wave of hurt sweep into the car like a cold draft. Remembering someone as special as Eileen wasn’t an easy thing to accomplish because with her memories, came the stolen glances and happy face Sam would make when she texted or called. The way Sam’s demeanor changed completely to a welcoming glow when she would visit them. And now that he had that same damn look on his face from talking about the blonde, Dean didn’t fight it.
Castiel’s look of utter amazement from the intrusion was prolonged even after he spun around and the water’s ripples flattened. “Dean!” he cried in his gravelly voice that curled the younger man’s toes. “How long have you been sitting there?”
Thoughts of what? Of him?
Actually chuckling, he shook his head and glanced out the window. “Your Social Security Number, you adorable idiot.”
“I can understand, Dean,” Castiel’s smile affected his entire face from the other man’s concern. When Sam and his brother gaped in response, he shook his head and chuckled. “Hanna, my ex-wife, suffered from a severe throat infection in her younger years. Therefore, all of her voice was lost, so naturally, signing was most efficient.”
As handsome as he appeared, apparently the tables had turned. He wasn't handsome enough to tempt Castiel with his arrogance and complete disregard for other people's feelings.
“Cas, before you go,” Dean touched his forehead and felt conflicted. The other man stalled by the small wooden bench and turned around. “I don’t mean to bring this up because I know that it’s…well it’s not really a good topic of discussion but you and I, we tell each other stuff regardless. And I don’t want to keep things from you because you wouldn’t do that to me.”
“Maybe you would be, Cas—”
“That’s not what I meant,” Castiel sighed although his cheeks dusted pink and after finishing his soup, he rested the bowl upon the tray, then reached for the paper bag by his feet. “In fact, I came here with the main intention to tend to you in the best way that I can. And here you are believing otherwise. Whatever must I do to prove to you that your worth is substantial, Dean?”
He wanted to feel something other than sadness. Perhaps anger would have sufficed. But in that moment, all Dean experienced was his heart literally being ripped to shreds. He felt so awfully sick to a point where the flu was considered. But he didn't have the flu. Dean was fully aware of what he was experiencing.
Both of them clicked SEND, holding their breaths and when their phones beeped at the same time, Dean felt like he was about to explode. He couldn’t undo anything now. He was literally hanging off a cliff, ready to fall into the depth of anything at that point because there was no turning back. As much as he tried, he couldn’t anticipate Cas’ reaction and most of all, everything would change between them now.
"Hey, do you remember Aiden?" Dean really couldn't shake the memory from his mind at all. "I was like fourteen. You were about nine." Why did he suddenly want to explore this person from his tainted past?
"Oh, I'm not judging," she laughed and stared at him incredulously afterwards. "Man, look at you getting all the action you always wanted. You're beginning to smell like him even. And before you know it, you'll be finishing each other's sentences and saving water by showering together. Not that I’m complaining." Ellen's eyes rested on Dean's happy form beside his brother. "Hey, day after tomorrow is Christmas. Bet you got him something nice."
"Yeah, and she knew before I did, really. That I was in love with you. She could see it from the first time she met you and we hugged. And ever since then, she couldn't stop…nagging at me to embrace myself and my feelings and I always shut her out. Then one night, it was like she knew she wasn't going to be around long, and she came into the kitchen and gave me this look. Kind of freaked the hell out of me. Especially when she took her ring off and said…'when the time comes and I know it will, when you propose to him, you put this ring on his finger. And you put all of your love into it. Your mind, body and soul. And you love him until you stop breathing'."
“It’s already late,” the senior’s voice was so hoarse.
Their eyes never left each other. They were holding onto that feeling and chasing it. And as he chewed, Dean rubbed his thumb so seductively over his lips, slowly and certain. Castiel’s eyes fluttered close as a soft sigh escaped his body.
Then just as he reached for the knob, Dean grabbed Castiel around his waist and flatted him in one smooth move upon the door.
He never really thought of his inexperienced disadvantage before, possibly awkward to envision the whole thing but now that his brother pushed the idea into his head, Castiel sat on the window seat. And he thought about how Dean possessed a wealth of information under his belt, literally whilst
Sam’s laughter in the background was followed by him asking who was on the phone, possibly believing that it was a girl more likely. And when Castiel remembered that Dean’s younger brother was also his friend in class, the one who shared notes with him and discussed topics clearly showing his thirst for knowledge and their aligned interests in pursing As, he felt a little relieved.
"Okay, so how about I just go over there and talk to him?" he asked a bright pink Charlie who was scowling at him, hands planted on her hips. "I mean, he said that I
Cas came down the steps slowly, taking tentative steps and his eyes were only locked on Dean's emerald ones. Only Dean. Eyes that were shiny from tears. Both pairs refusing to divert to anything else, to consider anyone else in the room. And in that moment, if Cas could sum up what he was feeling in one word, he would have labelled it as TERROR.
The hunter sighed into the kiss, feeling his toes curl under the sheets. "I love you too, Cas," he whispered. "And I can't wait to start a family with you. With the state of mind I've been in since you came back, I'm ready to do anything with you. And I mean…anything. When I saw you with those two little girls that day…"
“Maybe?”
The Bentley crawled away and left blue eyes with enough room to wander guiltily.
"Yeah?"
“Yup,” he collected his phone from the brown oak vanity and headed towards the door, Charlie following with a frown. “Suddenly my life has become a big joke. My ex-girlfriend Jo showed up today.” He related the news about his friend wine and dining and acting as a benefactor, all the while trying to keep the anger at bay.
“I’m so sorry, Cas. The things I said just came right out of me being hurt.”
But there were no other words. Nothing at all but the silence and the pain and Dean's refusal to turn around and look at him.
When Dean came through the double doors, he wasn’t alone but was accompanied by Annalise. And although Castiel never really wanted to place weight on their bond, he immediately felt a pang of jealousy because the two of them were laughing gaily with their hands around each other.
Cass goes into Dean’s bedroom a lot to
who was purported to be a terrible witch in disguise that kidnapped children and ripped their heads off. Her eyes were severely black, mannerism stiff and spoken words very few. She also floated around like a spirit and so she did in their direction, which caused Dean to stare in bewilderment and before he could escape, Castiel reached for his wrist and squeezed.
Dean gazed into blue eyes that appeared mellow after connecting with his emerald ones. His fingers twitched from resisting the urge to just reach out and touch the older man’s arm and perhaps it was rather unfortunate that restraint wore thin after a few seconds.
"What's wrong, Cas?" he asked quietly, knowing since earlier that a storm was brewing in the older man's mind. "Talk to me, man. What's going on with you, huh?"
"I'm serious. My throat aches more than my ass. Is that normal?" Cas turned a pair of innocent blue eyes on the hunter. And what he discovered, was a man who was on the verge of biting in a bout of heavy laughter. "Dean. It's not funny!"
“Yeah, well, it wasn’t amazing,” Dean admitted after remembering the feeling of drowning in his denial. “Most of it was painful and I cried a shitload of tears but after I almost kissed him the other night—”
Castiel sat there and stared out the window.
“I never thought about it that…way,” Dean frowned, “but there’s no one that I’d even consider to be interested in me at this point…” There literally was no one would who seem remotely attached to him as an object of fascination. And he couldn’t determine why his friend would appear to be troubled by the thought.
“Don’t be regretful about it. You deserve it. I’m just asking you to let me love you and show you some more of me before we go
“Um, I’m here to actually grab two smoothies,” Ruby’s eyes shifted to find the regular cashier, tucking her hair behind an ear.
She melted in his arms, burying her face into his maroon colored winter jacket and remaining there until the anxiety and tension within her friend dissipated. And then when they were slowly walking towards the fence, admiring their deep boot prints in the white snow, the decision was made to settle on the bench. From there, the two of them huddled together and simply gazed at the Novak's mansion; its roof frosted in white and the concrete walls painted the same color glistening in the sunlight.
an option," Dean shook his head and his tone sharpened. "Dammit, Cas."
By the time they were standing by the wooden fence painted green and Castiel’s gloved right hand lingered on the opened wrought iron gate, a silence settled between them again. The cold was too bitter to gnaw at Dean’s bones and wrap his heart into a solid icy fist, therefore he could not continue to drown in the kind of warmth that their nearness provided. It was something that he craved more than anything else, possibly breathing and because Castiel remained with his back facing him, his only decision was to stand there in anticipation.
“Who?” naturally any kind of attempts to continue conversation with Ruby resulted in a full-fledged debate these days.
“You can go ahead and end me now,” Dean whispered through his tears, hands trembling and knees still weak. “Because I deserve it.”
Castiel sighed, sipped some more wine and favored the fireplace crackling across the room. “You might be surprised.”
"Why are you doing this?" Castiel’s words tumbled over like water bubbling in a stream. “Dean?”
Tuesday. It was a Tuesday, he was in a class and it was almost 11am, which meant that the next one after lunch would involve a test. Focus.
"I find that placing my body in a horizontal position to achieve the depths of sleep is quite…uncomfortable," Cas squinted at Sam in the rearview mirror.
He nodded and cleared his throat. "Yeah, his name's Dean."
“You done now?” Dean blinked at the fire and offered a small smile because he understood her admiration for the older man, as many other women oftentimes found Castiel absolutely appealing. "Sounds like you have a little crush on the dude."
Dean on the other hand was studying his brother with the kind of saddened look that was reminiscent of someone who wished for the same thing but couldn't quite admit his feelings out loud. And when he remembered the only unwrapped gift nestled close to his right thigh, he reached up, pinched the bridge of his nose and tried to gather composure.
Choking on a mouthful of smoothie, Dean doubled over the table, then after composing himself, he threw a glare at his brother and sighed.
“You know, she could be so much nicer if she would just drop the bitch attitude,” Ruby remarked with a frown. “Look at her face. It’s like trying to smile makes her look constipated as fuck.”
I frowned, feeling my chest ache terribly because it seemed like he was dwelling on what I had said earlier. The world was so unfair sometimes and I didn’t want to contribute to that logic. “You’re allowed to have feelings. None of us are perfect. We’re all flawed.”
“Dean…” Castiel stopped him by taking his arm gently and he implored a further explanation. “You can’t just sidestep what we were talking about. It’s not –”
“Hi baby bro,” Gabriel said cheerfully, smiling from ear to ear with a bag tucked under his right arm. He sucked on a bright green lollipop that reminded me of something I didn’t want to remember. A pair of eyes… And then he came forward for a hug. “Don’t look so happy to see me all at once.”
Dean slowly exhaled the last smoke into the cold air, puffing up like a small lost cloud before disappearing with the wind and he quickly flipped his stub out of the window.
“Are you comfortable?” Castiel’s voice was too soothing as he returned the cork to the jar. “Do you need me to adjust your pillows?”
“Nah, it’s not him,” Ruby frowned and handed over the phone. “It’s some other number. Go ahead, I’ll just try to sit here and mull things over.”
"Come on, man!"
"I’m at the end of the rope here, hanging on barely. And all there is, is pain and confusion and guilt. In more ways than one, I can't sort this out on my own and he's not making it easy. But love isn't supposed to be easy, right? Maybe you're going to say that this kind of love isn't supposed to happen because he's…not a woman. And me about to ask you to give me faith might not be such a good idea. But there's nothing left. I…" Dean squeezed out tears through his closed eyelids. "I love him so much, that it hurts. It…hurts so damn much. Does this mean that it's not right? Should I turn away because it might take me a long time to get over the way I feel about him but it's not like I asked for it. It's not like I understood what it meant or I wanted to wake up one day and fall in love with another man. I just didn't see it coming and it hit me so hard that now I'm trying to catch up. And the worst part is, that it feels like I'm suffering from jet lag, because whilst my heart has been racing ahead and realizing that I've probably been in love with him for a long time now, my brain is trying to catch up. And it's not fair. It's not fair that I feel like I was brought on this earth to be with him. We complement each other so perfectly, you know?"
Sam said nothing.
By the time they were bundled into the gold carriage and drawn down the streets of London by four majestic white horses, Dean’s waving game was still strong after half an hour. But Castiel, after some time, discovered that a smile was enough to display his contentment and so he continued to offer that gesture whilst the man at his side waved like crazy.
“School’s out today,” Charlie idly wrapped the black strings around her mittens and pouted. “You know, it’s funny but I feel so bored already without them. It’s like we’ve grown so close, I feel like they’re my own kids in a way. Like just yesterday, they did this whole thing for me where they pooled together their money and bought me a really nice winter coat and a pink satchel. I felt so super adored.”
"Now it would be weird. I totally get it," Charlie huffed out a sigh, arms folded, and she stared at the fire. "He's so amazing though, like, super cool to be around and he gives me this fuzzy vibe of knowing exactly how to treat a lady the right way. You know what?” she turned on the chair and stared at him, “this is why he suits you, Dean. He can cook, play the piano, paint, look after his gardens, he’s a freaking genius. All of this I learned from talking to him and I bet that he has so much more qualities that even I don’t know about but you do.”
No one seemed to notice the unsettling conversation, except for his father who was silently considering the arrival of Castiel at his corner of the room. And when John sent him a quizzical look, fishing for the cause of the separation, his son could only respond with two things.
and winked. “He ages like fine wine with a fine ass and a fine pair of eyes.”
“Dean, you can’t be serious right now,” Sam turned to offer his brother a confused look. “Do you really think that after you’ve been like a dad to me since I was born, I’d trust anyone else? If anything happens to me and Eileen, I want you and Cas to take care of Salena. And we plan to have two more so gear up to be their god parents too.”
And suddenly, Sam knew. He had become familiar with the daunting face of depression because he had suffered through it. He understood that the emptiness within his brother's green eyes was consumed with dangerous thoughts. And Sam honestly wanted to hug him.
“What’s that?”
“I feel like you are wrongfully judging him.”
Cas, turned sideways and propped up on his left elbow, dared to seek out what he had been missing for so long by driving his hand upwards and inside Dean's tank. And he could feel how breathless the other man was, even as Cas searched for Dean's heartbeat and discovered that what he wanted most in that moment was to kiss him. He wanted to. And so he did, leaning down slowly and pressing their lips together in the softest kiss possible. And when they connected in such a subtle way, it was almost too blissful.
He remained silent, absorbing all the new information as he realized that he really was clueless about his older friend’s past in more ways than one. Just when he was told on a prior occasion that Castiel only entertained less than two romances, here he was being advised otherwise. And maybe it wasn’t supposed to be hurtful that the secrets between them kept piling up, but he felt pained enough.
look. Of course, I remained silent, staring at my keyboard. I was so thankful for the distraction though because how dare she try to sabotage me like that? After I trusted her, relied on her as a mentor, Ruby insinuated that I had sexual relations with the CEO, who was my boss, the owner of GENTS and a guy who obviously would never think of me in that way.
Charlie studied his soft smile and gasped. "Oh my freaking god. You two are screwing each other every chance you get, huh?"
"I threw up," he lied and weakly raked his fingers through his hair, offering a wry smile, "must be the long hours on the road or some pretty messed up coffee we had. But I'm all good now."
"Of him covered in sewerage and looking like a rat?" Dean scrunched up his nose. "Not ever. Feels like he's one of the worst kind of monsters we've ever come across."
“It’s good that they have a father who is quite obsessed with Disney movies as much as they will be,” Cas smiled at Mala. “He’s watched Frozen at least five times.”
The pain though, was something new and he understood where all of the determination arose from, deep down inside Castiel that was hurting, that was still bruised. But there was something else buried inside the older man though, something which drifted to the surface now that he was intoxicated…a new and dominant side. The wilder side which suggested that he wasn't so sophisticated to the core, but very much open to lovemaking which entertained roughness by pining Dean's arms down to his side as he sucked and trailed kisses.
Dean’s response was to stare back without revealing anything but the clear intent to torture and tease. And it was the usual mode of flirting between them; the lack of playfulness during foreplay but the abundance of passion fueling a game of trying to dominate the other.
Castiel’s chest burned when Dean slipped under the table and out of view. “I think you caught me at a bad time. Can I call you back?”
“Claire,” Jody warned, eyeing Charlie joining them on the couch cautiously. “Don’t overstep. We have a visitor.” The last bit she whispered frantically, hoping that the newcomer couldn’t catch onto the conversation.
The absence that made the heart grow fonder, the highly determined streak to excel at his studies, the passionate glint in those green eyes to love and adore those close to him. And Charlie soon realized that as much as she loved Dean as a brother, Castiel spoke so lovingly about him like he was far more than a friend or a family member.
Wings, real wings unfurling and stretching close to ten feet with definite substance. Feathers of darkened shades of black, then grey, fanning out into white ones and majestic, beautiful and
When the party did end up separating, quite the contrary was achieved as the
in case you didn’t notice, my best friend is a dude,” she widened her eyes at me, “and my other close friends like you and Jack are dudes too. I don’t want to be ignorant. I like learning about things so shut up and listen for your own good. My pep talks are free.”
Even though Charlie kept waving him over, Dean could not gather up the courage enough to join because something was clearly happening between himself and Castiel that he could not understand enough to digest. Thus, he was left to feel completely prickly and pained as the three women focused on topics that intrigued him but very soon dulled to light words that held no significance. And sitting in one attitude for over two hours soon fatigued Dean that he was immediately relieved when they were all called in to help themselves to the buffet.
“That you, brother?” fitted into a black suit which immediately placed him as a distinguished federal agent, the childhood friend Dean was most fond of through his years at school stared back in awe.
“Good night…”
"Right," prodding his neck still and pouting, "go ahead and leave with my blood on your fangs. In some cultures, you could be hanged."
"To what?" the young woman with wild blonde hair asked, her blue eyes darkening. "To try to control me? Huh? You know, you can be so ridiculous sometimes. It's like you just can't help yourself, can you? This is my life, okay? I'm allowed to live it how I want because that's what I've been doing since mom died."
He didn't chase after him, just as he had been pursued though. And he hated himself for feeling the worst kind of pain as the distance between them lengthened. As Dean walked away in his black tuxedo and polished shoes with his hair ruffled by the wind. As he never looked back but climbed the steps and disappeared inside.
“Stop,” he croaked as his chest heaved uncontrollably and Dean still continued to grind their dicks together in his hand. “Dean,” it was so painful for him to say his name in possibly the most hurtful moment.
"Aliens, huh."
He wanted a wife with a dog and a bungalow in the middle of nowhere. Law school. Kids. Not hunting with someone like you. Someone who is heartless and a murderer. Someone who cares about people who don't care about him. Someone who saves people who never remember him. And Cas…
He never witnessed the demise of the older man in such a fashion, where he simply gave into the feelings ravishing him and uprooted the belief that he could be stronger than most people. Castiel was always the one who stood tall with certainty, composure that resembled granite, lack of tears even when sad news enveloped their family, and the ability to build Dean up when he was the one that constantly crumbled.
Bobby looked him up and down in disbelief. "You don't give them your number, you idjit. You collect theirs. Thought you had more sense than that. Always thought you were born feet first. Doing everything backwards in this world. But then it ain't your fault that you got a mind that can be your worst enemy."
“It’s the small things that go unnoticed,” Ellen offered warmly with a smile. “But then Dean knows nothing about simple things because he’s spoiled rotten.”
After realizing that adrenaline was pumping and there was no turning back, he rested his thumb on the button again. "I'm falling in love with you, huggy bear," Dean said softly, tears clouding his eyes. "Sweetheart, darling. I'm falling so hard for you that it's happening so fast and I can't even catch my breath. In your words…I am
Dean tried to swallow his surprise but failed miserably because the statement contained so much confidence. “Wow, Cas. So, you trying to tell me that you remember exactly when that happened? You two didn’t screw around any other time? Come on.”
"Dean, we are not the same anymore," Cas pressed on, "we will never be the same again."
Dean bit back his tears and felt his throat ache terribly. "Sometimes…I just feel…like I deserve it, like I need to feel what I've put you through all these years."
It wasn’t easy for him, never was. And because he faced a hurdle and couldn’t jump over it, he began to cry. He cried because it was what Rowena wanted him to confess. All of the words narrowed down to a phrase that held so much power, Dean couldn’t give in that easily. But when he thought of losing Castiel, and never having him back, he let go of that power just enough to feel triumphant over the truth.
“He’s in love…with me,” blue eyes became mellow when the wind caressed his face and the view from the fourth floor provided nothing short of everything breathtaking. “I still can’t believe that he still wants me.”
“We can’t,” Castiel warned in a whisper, capturing Dean’s hand that tried to slip into the front of his pants. Their lips danced together, breaths warm. “If we do, we will have to change our clothes and then everyone will definitely know that we fucked.”
, so real. Dean studied the expanse of something he only believed would exist in brilliant CGI and with parted lips, he stepped closer. But when he did, Castiel blinked, lips trembling as he became deeply affected by the distance eaten up between them.
"Wait," Castiel's tone was softer now. He sighed again and rested his head against the wall, blue eyes distant and unaware of the twinkling stars above. "Wait, I didn't mean to sound so bitter. Given the circumstances. You did manage to yank me out of sleep. I'm slightly irritated."
"I'm pretty sure that a human can't hurt you at this point, Dean," Cas actually smiled. "You've fought all kinds of monsters and won. I'm a good fighter too. Violence is not something to fear."
"Geez, I always miss out the good stuff. So like how many souls were there?"
Dean searched the rooms one by one until he began to hyperventilate, leaning onto a wall next to a beautiful watercolor painting of the White Mountains and trying to catch his breath. This wasn't happening. Not when he was overflowing with love and craved the sight of the older man to deposit all of it onto him, not when he wanted to be touched and kissed and craved for conversation. He became so needy that relying on his dreams, Dean pushed the door into the room containing the indoor pool and found Balthazar doing laps instead of his brother.
None of the disgusting things he thinks of help calm his boner, no matter how much he wants them to. He thinks that maybe he can wait Dean out, but it hurts. He tries again, and again, but Dean will not let go of his arms. Cas sighs. He didn’t want to wake him, but he has to.
Bela Talbot is a dangerous woman, Castiel suspects. At least if she's not on your side.
He’s cut off as Dean pushes back against him and screams, come exploding from his cock.
“And the sex?”
“Well, I’m sure I must be keeping you—”
He steps out at the same time as Dean, who freezes when their eyes lock. Dean’s scared, Cas realizes, probably even more scared than he is.
“Wow,” Dean murmurs.
Gabe wishes Cas were a little more like him, unafraid to speak up.
In the morning, he sees Dean only briefly as he gets Beatrix set up for class, but they wave to each other and Cas shoots him a wide smile.
Dean whimpers. Cas restrains his own whimper at the loss (and the pain of his scraped penis).
He continues:
“Yeah, well, maybe I have a one-night type,” he admits. “But there’s a difference between a night and a lifetime, you know?”
“You’re the brat.”
“I get that.”
Crowley fiddles with something on the counter, then shoves his mug next to Cas’, the infuser in his cup filled with what smells like an English Breakfast tea. “So, you’re not your sunny self. What’s got your knickers in a twist? It can’t be Dean. Dean in your knickers would make you blush like a schoolgirl.”
Dean’s making a choice for himself, and he’s choosing this. It gives Castiel a stupid little thrill, even though there’s nothing that will come of it.
“Awesome.”
“Come on,” she laughs. “Let’s see what we can do for you.”
there any pie left?”
“Noooo…don’t wanna go back out.”
“You’d be on your way to gettin’ busy right now if him bein’ your whore was really workin’—”
It wasn’t Cas.
They started with a road trip—just them and the open road, no one telling them what to do or how to do it.
“Hey, Mr. Novak. How are ya?”
“Okay. Anything else? Maybe something you wanted to do last time that you didn’t get to do?”
But just because he wants that doesn’t mean it’s easy to give him up, and it doesn’t mean he’s going to give Matthew to just
Looking like the proverbial deer in the headlights, Cas nods. “Um, okay.”
He opens it.
“I—I am cured,” Cas rasps, his voice low and thready from deep-throating. “My desire has finally been quenched. I thank you.”
as Dean approaches.
Guess that’s what good sex does to people.
“So I’ve heard,” Cas grins.
“Well, it
Dean grins back, clearly more relaxed. “I like this side of you. And I am more than happy to make whatever amends you think I need to. Any amends you want.”
Vaughn rolls his eyes and folds his arms. “Yeah, I guess…”
—then clicks over to the messages tab to double-check the date of his parent-teacher conference. He knows it’s in his correspondence with Bea’s teacher, Mr. Novak.
Also, all of you who said that Lee would tattle...ding ding ding!
Matthew wakes as they’re finishing their cleaning, ready for a change and feeding.
“No.”
“That’s what the salesperson said. Does it look nice?”
He looks up at his very coy husband. “Just fine,
For the next twenty-four hours, Cas continues to shut up while Dean takes care of him. He doesn’t argue with him when he takes the day off his own classes and job, he doesn’t argue when he makes him eat, and he doesn’t argue when Dean makes him a nest of throw blankets on their loveseat while the linens of their beds are in the laundry. When Dean sits on the loveseat with him and pulls him against his chest, Cas does the opposite of arguing—he sighs and sinks into the embrace, wiggling his arms around his back and squeezing until his body falls lax and heavy with sleep.
“Maybe,” he mouths back with a smirk.
“Come over here and tell me about this,” Castiel insisted, the last couple of bites of their food left at the table as he dragged Dean to the couch.
they are. They sit on the same side of the table, sharing a Pu Pu for Two and a Scorpion Bowl, talking about everything except their asshole roommate.
Dean grins.
There were a few days when he got hopeful. He had an entire supernatural library around him, after all. There had to be a way to get to the Empty and get Cas back, right?
“I’ve forgiven you.”
He dips his head in acknowledgement. “True.”
Dean places the bag in the mailbox.
Both boys freeze on the spot, their snickers dying as their faces pale. “What?” the one on the right says.
“He means I won’t agree with him,” Cas explains, then turns back to Dean. “If we face it the way I want to, the light won’t shine in your eyes in the morning, which you hate.”
Dean grimaced. “Yeah. Sorry.”
“Yes! Yes! There, please!” He grips the covers under his hands, kneading them as his breaths quicken. It feels so good.
“You stayed through my shit. I trust you. And I love you, and you love me.”
There will be nothing tame about this roleplay.
He knows the officer wants him to stay put, but he didn’t actually
Dean shrugs.
“Now do somethin’ about it.”

“Uh, no, I mean, I’m not interested in her like that.”
“Monday.”
“Yeah, yeah. You just wanted an excuse to spend more time sucking face.” Cas and Dean had been spending a lot of time at their new house, scrubbing and painting and replacing floors and yes, probably doin’ the dirty. Given where he’s found them at this house, he wouldn’t put it past either of them to end up against a counter.
“I think I’m going to be having sex with you every week. That’s enough for me. If you’re decent at it, that is.”
“Just the formula,” Castiel explains. “He was hungry.”
But what if—
Gabriel, peeking in at the scene, comments, “Wow, that’s love, man. You should keep him, ‘cause I sure as hell wouldn’t eat that.”
“I guess. Not like I’ve had reason to use them.”
“Cas.”
“Good.”
“I have a grasp of soup and sandwiches,” he replied with a shrug.

the couple scenes. They made him feel secure and wanted and loved, even if they weren’t real. He wants that, for real. Always has.
Dean meets his eyes, those soft, sincere blues regarding him with such love, a look he’s seen hundreds of times. Cas has never lied to him. “Yes.”
A spark of magic lights Castiel’s eyes a cerulean blue. “Ready, beloved.”
The softness in Dean’s voice is nearly unbearable. It sneaks under his defenses, penetrating his heart. All the depictions of Cupid’s instrument being an arrow are wrong, Castiel is convinced. It’s not an arrow. It’s a tender voice, a fond smile, a deep gaze, a soft touch. “You think so?” he whispers.
Dating in a time of quarantine...how long will they go before they break and see each other?
“Not everyone’s out to get you, you know.”
“I’m sorry, Cas,” Dean murmured.
brother hurting Dean?”
“Uh huh.”
“Yes.”
“Out of those pants and onto my bed.” Cas pulls him away from the door, then lifts his own shirt and slaps his side. Dean shoots him a questioning look until Cas says, “Now. Don’t make me slap your ass again.”
Cain’s brows crinkle in question, Cas’ brows raise in answer, and Cain seems to get it. “Oh,” he smiles knowingly.
His grip is firm—a little too firm—and Dean’s glad when he lets go.
,” Cas hissed, uncaring that he surely woke his brother.
He shakes his head as he trembles harder and tears up. “Matthew—”
“Confidence is the most attractive thing you can wear,” Cas murmurs.
The ice cream stand had truly been a surprise. Bobby approached him the other day and told him that they had more money than they’d expected at that point, so if he wanted the dream list, he could have it. Castiel could hardly believe it.
As Dean was just about to go out John stopped him "Dean, when are you going to actually talk to another Alpha? You can't keep swimming around in circles, because you're not going to get anywhere. Be more like Sam." Dean clenched his fists but just nodded at his father, who had an old family friend round. Which Dean used to call him his uncle Bobby, obviously Dean told Bobby what John did to Cas, which didn't do the situation any better as it made John lash out more at Dean. Making Dean feel like the useless Omega he actually was meant to be.
“You’re a good boy Dean,” Castiel praised the boy who beamed up at him, making a grabby motion at him once again. Castiel picked him up easily letting the small being in his arms nuzzle his head in the crook of his neck, hearing him mumble “Mine” Castiel felt a sense of pride flow through him. Nodding his head slightly turning off the water stepping out grabbing a towel before heading out towards the bedroom knowing Dean wasn’t going to release him anytime soon. Dropping the boy on the floor on his bedroom Castiel forcefully dried Dean off as he kept wriggling around. “Dean, behave!” Castiel snapped after a moment of Dean continuously wiggle around, sighing as he felt his boy stop moving Castiel managed to dry him without a problem.
You could tell Dean wanted to pounce on your body, but couldn't since Sam was in the room who soon made an awkward cough to bring your attention back. "You guys done?" Dean snapped his head in Sams direction.
Castiel opened the door there was the girl laying on the table, her feet and arms had been strapped down as her big blue eyes staring right at the two men.
"Arrow, calm down OK? Just breathe." The face of his teacher soon came into view as well as the body with a white sheet over it. "W-What happened?" Arrow weakly asked. "We don't know but I need you to put your clothes on so I can take you to your dad who is outside, got that?" Arrow numbly nodded, reaching his clothes that had been waiting patiently for him like an hour ago.
"I Said maybe because people don't wanna be friends with the freak, also most people in the school are homophobic so of course, I'm gonna just tell everyone I have fags for dads!" Jensen stormed out the room, knocking his chair over.
"I don't care if you my Guardian Angel just stay the fuck away from me alright? Cas-ti-el." Dean sighed walking away from Castiel.
"Third rule; you got to tell us if we are being to rough or it's something you don't like, we'll stop." Dean was now wondering what they would do, he really didn't mind. "Okay, is that gonna be it?"
Two days later Sam and Dean were woken up by the bunker making a racket the alarms were going off. "Cas!?" Sam and Dean called out walking towards the war room with Castiel and Jack standing beside the table. "What the hell is going on?" Dean asked while Sam walked off to turn everything back on. "I have no idea but something big could be happening." Castiel tried giving useful information but it only irritated the eldest Winchester more."So, looks like we wait and see what happens." Sam came in to release some of the tension between them.
Connors' eyes snapped open he was facing Dean who was also looking at him, one of his legs were over Deans. "Someone was having a nice dream then?" Dean chuckled as Connor tried detaching himself from Dean, but he really didn't want to move. "Daddy.." Connor squeezed his eyes shut, why was that the first thing out his damn mouth! "Wow, really was a nice dream!" Dean bursts out laughing.
He pushed his cock in you slowly, you only showed discomfort on your face for a second before it went back to your neutral expression while you slept. Castiel began moving slowly you only shifted slightly as he did, what you didn’t know was the promise he kept was one slowly breaking within.
It was a few good hours before there was a small voice in the room, "Daddy, her eyes are closing." Dean poked the girl who was slowly slipping away from them. Lucifer had completely ruined her body with the knife almost treated her like a pig going to the butchers. "It's ok Dean, we can always find another." Castiel patted Deans back gently biting his lip as he looked at the boys little bottom. Standing so he was behind Dean pulling him to his chest.
Cas watched him leave into his apartment, once he disappeared Cas sighed slowly, turning around to the empty apartment... Dean was right it is boring being on your own.
Dean growled trying to get Cas out from him.
One instantly stood when she saw Dean. "Why you let a dog in?!" Dean stayed by the door while Sam and the blonde girl walked towards them. "He's friendly, I swear," Sam reassured the girls who relaxed when she knew Dean wouldn't be coming any closer.
"Winchester, my mom wanted me to keep it for some reason as it remembered her of someone, but I guess it was you, right?" Connor looked towards Dean who had moved so he was crouched in front of him.
But they soon came back to each other, as Dean knew that it wasn't worth losing an argument. He could lose an argument but he couldn't lose his Castiel.
Jensen stepped forward picking Dean up. "I can make this easier for you," Cas placed two fingers on Dean, making his entire body go smaller. "CAS!!" Dean squealed when Jensen nudged the plug. "Well it is easier, Dean. You fit the part now." Jensen and Cas both rubbed their hands over Dean, who was just relaxing against Jensens chest, making pleased noises.
The flames were hot, and the smell of burning of wood, paper, and other things that were burning made Dean grin while looking at his man.
Dean jumped turning on his heels, Cas was right in front of him "Cas, warn me next time!" Cas apologies quietly taking a step back.
Dean watched the back of Castiel walk out the door, he strangely missed the man and the warmth of his hand on his thigh, throwing his head back
"Dean, I want you to be mine, I want to look after you, I want you to be my little boy, omega?" Dean shudders against the alpha he was pressed up on, was he allowed to speak? Should he agree? If he did then he would be free from his father, and stop all the beatings he gets.
Castiel mumbled his agreement under his breath as his watched his brothers get in their car and drive off. Sighing turning around seeing Dean glaring at him.
"You're a pathetic boy, man up!" His stepdad hit him six more times before Connor pushed past him running up the stairs, but moving faster than his feet couldn't keep up falling on the stairs as his dad dragged him back down by his legs. "You're just as dumb as your mother thinking she could run from me," Connor was confused, but couldn't do much before he was turned into a human punching bag for his stepdad.
Dean opened his eyes that he didn't know he had shut, seeing Castiel smiling "nice song Cas," Dean quickly shut his mouth as the last word left his mouth "Cas?" Dean looked away embarrassed but Cas let a hand touch his cheek "I like it." Dean turned seeing Cas smiling "oh, you do? but you a teacher and its weird right?" Cas looked around the park "Well are we in school?" Dean shook his head "then, we are friends in school I'm your teacher, outside school I'll be whatever you want." Deans body shook at Cas' words "Kiss me, fucking kiss me!"
Sighing as Dean got several drinks from the kitchen, strolling back to his room. His laptop was waiting on the bed on the same pornsite he left it on, but Dean was feeling curious tonight.
Dean and Jensen have been sneaking around. Their twins. Nobody knows their little secret until...
There were feathers everywhere, a mix of golden coloured feather and black coloured feathers. Dean and Sam stood back from the bodies that had just appeared.
-----
Jensen wondered into an old barn on his own, Misha had also wondered off on his own. There were three standing around in the barn Jensen had clearly been out of practice, as all three zoned their attention on Jensen. Teeth and claws came out as they charged at Jensen who quickly went to defend himself, forgetting that these were so much stronger then your regular Vampire or Werewolf.
“Stay…” Was the only word that made Castiel grab a blanket that was on the back of the couch wrapping it around the omega before sitting down next to him letting him rest his head on him.
I'm seriously struggling with this! D: Help me....
I had a bit of a break, but hey here is a chapter! It won't be as good so I apologise.
“Dean, what is wrong?” Castiel was reading in bed next to Dean who was tossing and turning in every possible direction. “Nothing is wrong Cas, leave it.” Dean snapped, making Castiel lower his book.
Castiel flapped his wings hoping to get away quicker but Dean was somehow faster. "Sixth time Cas! Sixth time you've appeared when my hand is wrapped around my dick!" Dean snarled showing his fangs at the Angel. "I only appear as I sensed a longing from you, but I don't check if its desperate." Castiel truthfully explained.
"Your lips look so good wrapped around my cock, Dean, so fucking good!" Jensen had started to slowly thrust into Deans mouth. Which Dean relaxed his mouth so Jensen could fuck his mouth how he wanted, moaning around Jensens cock Dean felt him tense up.
Deans heart started beating faster shit, does he know about my real job is?They had stopped in front of Cas' door.
Castiel ground down into Dean who gasped, grinding up to meet Castiel. "Such a good boy Dean," Cas mouthed at Deans' neck gently nipping groaning at the boy's hands on him.
Chase, Sam and Dean didn't seem to be getting along well, and Chase was stuck in the car with them going to work on a case. The first thing they did was get a motel room, they were planning on getting two so it wouldn't be awkward, but all three boys were stuck in the same room. "There are only 2 beds?" Chase looked towards the brothers.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Alright Cas, sign this then you can start tomorrow, if that's alright with you.."
This human (me) has had barely any sleep, please be gentle with them.
"Daddy!! Papa threw me in!" Henry screeched swimming over to the rocks. "Oh, naughty papa." Dean playfully flicked his tail splashing Castiel with water.
Castiel seemed hurt but he didn't show it as he sat down on the old couch waiting for Deans return.
"I wish you didn't have to leave so soon, you know." Sam breathed out as he picked his bag, closing the trunk gently before heading inside.
"Ah, when did you sneak back in?" Sam was the first to wake up, Chase shoulda guessed it would be Sam up first. "Just a few minutes ago," Chase gave Sam the coffee he brought with a content hum from Sam. "Thanks, take it you had fun last night?" Sam smirked around his cup. "Shut up, I've never done anything like that before, but yeah I guess I had fun." Chase shrugged at Sam when he gave him an odd look, while Dean groaned from the bed.
Chevy, Dean's mare, was a shiny black horse, her mane would flow in the wind whenever Dean rode her, and one with a lively attitude. Riot, Sam's stallion was a brown colour coat with a black tail and smooth flowing mane. The two dismounted and handed their reigns to Jo, they trusted her to look after them.
"Do you want me in your family?" Dean asked the little merman. "Yes please, you smell like safety and home," Jimmy snuggled closer to Dean as possible. Dean and Cas had been together for at least two weeks after their, mating and bonding time. Dean smiled when he rubbed the back of his neck, the bite from Cas, his best friend who turned into his mate.
Barking happily to himself as Cas hopped the bed gracefully. Dean not so much, landing with a thud as his paws hit the floor as well as he body. Sam was still sound asleep, well he was until Dean decided to give his brother a nice waking up.
The three Alphas stayed at the bar for a good few hour but Jesse got bored standing up and leaving the table once he spotted a pool table. Wondering over he noticed nobody was playing, making him actually perked up knowing he could play and get the hang of it without the pressure of being watched.
(See the end of the chapter for
That got his attention what was the other thing?
Dean picked himself up giving one good flick of his tail, catching Jimmy in his arms. "Gotcha!" Carrying him back, flopping down by Cas. "He's a quick one," Cas chuckled, pulling Dean close with Jimmy. "So, are we having another child?" Cas looked over to Dean, who gave a smile that brightened Cas' day. "Hell yeah! I went and did a lil test, it came out positive so... we're gonna have another nightmare swimming about in nine months!" Cas could smell the happiness and excitement coming from Dean. "hmm, looks like we got some baby names to think of, and a lot of other stuff to think about."
So that's how Dean was stuck inside the one house that Dean didn't want to be in. Sitting awkwardly as Cas was doing his own thing somewhere in the house, Dean got up to look around. Well until Cas appeared out of nowhere.
"Oh yes, Gabriel will treat his toy right this time!" Gabriel clapped his hand while being guided out the door. When the front door closed Castiel sighed, turning around he saw the most vulnerable little boy standing right in front of him.
"Well last night you didn't offer me help! You just told me to be a good little boy and go home, well I'm going home it's up to you if you want to help me or not." Connor got out the hold Dean had on him shoving him out the way, to run out the door. Connor knew they were going to follow him, but at least they didn't rush about doing it. It gave Connor sometime to prepare himself for the guy that could possibly be possessed by a demon.
“Hmm. Well, you’ll have to convince me.”
Cas rolls his lips together. “I might’ve had tabs already open just in case this ever came to be.”
“Her telling you what?”
Dean is at work right now, and is due home around 4:00. They’re supposed to go to the Alliance party tonight. Cas is in no mood to party. Maybe he can fake an illness, he thinks.
It’s probably time to leave, Sam thinks. The snow will be coming soon and the couple would probably like to enjoy their new house alone.
Dean nodded. “The irony of it all is that I only took that job and stuck with it so long for you.”
Jack turns the page. “Then one day, Claire saw Dean on his balcony. Her dad wasn’t around and he was trapped, so Claire figured it was a good time to finally talk to him.”
“I really have to disagree.”
it would, but still, I wondered if—”
It strikes him then that Dean doesn’t have any friends here except for his brother, perhaps Gabe, and...well, him. A gregarious sort like him must feel lonely. “Do you want to come to a potluck tonight?”
“I wondered where he was getting off to,” Cas continued as he dropped Dean’s hand with a lingering touch, “so I followed him the other day when he thought I was gone and he came here. I followed him a couple more times and he kept coming back here, so I figured this was his second home and the reason for his recent weight gain.”
“You’re gonna be great. It’ll be fine, okay?”
The embarrassed nurse leaves, Alex reads his discharge instructions into his recorder, and then Dean is alone with Cas once again.
“Oh fuck, you are
They play a few rounds of Blackjack, but Dean can’t concentrate. He’s excited. Nervous. Happy. Oh, and horny, too. He won’t even
Cas snickers. Dean grins.
Cas is in a simple white toga that Dean also made. It’s draped over his tanned, fit frame, cinched at the waist with a gold rope. He’s wearing sandals that Dean bought on Amazon and had shipped two-day to make sure they’d arrive on time. His hair is combed down, a la Julius Caesar, and the fringe on his forehead gives him a completely different (hot) look.
,” Dean pouted.
Cas pauses. Dean stares at a yellow strand in the rug.
“Let’s go dancing tonight,” Cas says on a beautiful late May morning. He jumps up and clicks his heels together.
“We did! You didn’t need to drag people into our mess!”
Dean licks his lips and shrugs, then nods.
Vaughn doesn’t say a word when they emerge, but he eyes Dean and shakes his head. With that one disapproving look, Dean feels his anxiety threaten to break him apart.
But then again, it was unusual, and his own reaction to the stranger was unusual, too.
“We have been pretending to date,” Cas reiterates to their stunned guests (and smug roommate).
As Dean turns his attentions to his phone, Cas attempts to talk down both his brain and his dick.
“Well, I know you could talk about Baby all day, but I do have to feed Matthew, try to squeeze in a shower, and get to work.”
“Well. As I explained, Dan, this will be a nude session.”
“Nope. No one ever made me dinner, either, never mind a candlelit one. I mean, we were in dorms so I guess that would’ve been tough, but still. You and I managed to make all kinds of things in our dorm room.”
“I will do as you command.”
“Right.” Dean pinches the top of his nose. This is not what he wanted his senior year to be. He already has so many classes and labs as a biology major, and he’s working besides. And he fucking
joke.
“What.”
“Are you? That’s good in some situations, not in others.”
“Cas, you
“No problem. You know that. Remember when I got mono?”
The first night they slept together was in a tiny bed in Lafayette. Dean had wanted to make the entire trip in one go, but dying and coming back to life did a number on a guy. He barely got the chance to enjoy seeing Cas by his side before he fell asleep, though, and both Cas and Sam were up and about by the time he woke up, precluding any sort of lazing around Dean might’ve wanted to indulge in. (Cuddling, okay? He wanted to cuddle.) They were on the road for twelve hours the next day and Dean collapsed into bed when they got to the bunker, exhaustion once again winning out. When he woke, only Miracle was by his side. He frowned. Clearly he had to teach Cas a few things about being in a relationship—not that he had a
Sounds like they’re moving into some real relationship stuff here...for better or worse. 😂 Poor Dean.
“Ohhh,” Nightmare murmurs instead of just saying
“What, are you saying I’m slacking off on my workouts?” Dean teases, and before Castiel knows it, he’s sitting and Dean is sitting on top of him.
As the couple chats casually about their bedroom activities with their fascinated friends, Cas’ attention drifts. He watches them, sitting close, clearly enjoying each other. They’ve been married for a while now. They even have a little girl, Gertie, and Bess is pregnant again. They seem so vanilla, and yet look at them. They’ve somehow found a way to keep their sex lives interesting. Cas is sure they have their moments, their times when they don’t feel like having sex or they’re too busy or even when the sex is sort of ho-hum. But through all that, they still have each other—to spend time with, to be close to. Cas sighs.
"C-Cas?" Dean slowly opened the door seeing Cas in his bed but he looked asleep, but that didn't stop Dean going over to climb on Cas just to straddle his waist. "Cas!" Dean whined in Cas' ear but the man beneath Dean didn't move an inch. "CAS!!" Dean yelped when he was thrown to the other side of the bed. "Dean!? W-What?" Cas looked at Dean who giggled.
Chase growled at himself when he woke up not bothering to check the time, seeing himself still in his clothes and not actually in the bed making him groan, getting off the bed to shed his clothes off, apart from his boxers, before getting under the warm covers. Trying to ignore the semi he had in his pants.
Waiting patiently for Cas to show to tuck him in bed. It was only a few minutes until Cas showed at the door smiling, walking towards Dean. "Come on, get under the covers Dean." Dean happily followed Cas' order slipping under the covers as Cas brought them up to his chin.
Another trail of tears left Deans eyes. "Cas, can you help me? Can I stay here forever? Can I l-l-o-v-e you?" Dean stuttered over the damn word but all Cas did was turn him around putting his face in his hands. "Yes.
9th Month:
I can't just have random wall sex popping up into this!
Dean was close to cumming, Cas was close as well Dean could tell, his thrusts got faster, Cas reached around wrapped his hand around his cock.
Arrow snaked a hand in between Cas' legs wrapping a hand around his cock, hearing a grunt from above him, moving his head seeing them both looking down at him making him freeze, moving his other hand to wrap around Deans cock watching his eyes flutter going back to kiss Cas with a filthy moan. Arrow licked his lips at the sight, moving nearer to Deans dick, giving a small lick startling the hunter above him.
"Shall we go my pet?" Castiel held his hand for Dean to take, leading him down to his special hobby room for the next few hours.
Jensen Winchester.
When Castiel came Dean didn’t. He stayed on the table hearing Castiel move around the room putting everything in the proper places, he didn’t want to move from the place he was in, he only moved when the lights were turned off and Castiel had left. Dean shuffled his way around the house he knew he looked a mess but didn’t acknowledge it until he was standing outside the bathroom door looking at the wooden door like a lost boy.
Castiel had one of the worst nights when he presented as an Alpha, he would throw up three days before his rut actually started everyone he was around didn’t smell all that great so he had to be kept in a special room to wait for his rut out.
It took another two hours before Castiel got them home, Dean actually had been good once all the bags were placed inside Castiel grabbed Dean by the back of his shirt pulling him back his back collided into Castiel's chest. "You better be on our bed with fewer clothes you have on now," Castiel growled into Deans' ear, chuckling when Dean ran up the stairs.
Deans mother didn't even bother asking, as Dean stormed in and ran upstairs and got the information she needed from John, Dean was getting castrated.
"Oh I see, I'm still here Dean, I never left." Castiel moved to place a hand on Deans shoulder but Dean pulled away. "Don't you do that, just don't!" Dean stormed off out the house leaving Sam with two naked angels.
"This bitch needs more, damn.." Misha pulled away, as did Cas. Jensen sat back down again, getting Dean to sit on him, lifting his legs up before popping his cock into Deans tight heat. "Why the fuck you so big..." Dean slowly rocked himself on Jensen, his back was on Jensens chest, Cas was standing in front of Dean, just watching Jensens cock disappearing in and out of Dean. What Dean didn't know was Cas, Misha and Jensen had a plan. since after a few moments Dean felt another cock splitting him open even more, it was Cas'. "O-ohh no!" Dean tried moving away from Cas but he wasn't that successful as Jensen stroked his hair, and stayed completely still inside Dean while Cas was still trying to enter Dean.
"Dean, come on man, you're starting to worry me!" Jensen stood at the end of the bed looking at Dean who was laying back. His shirt had lifted a bit revealing a tiny bit of tanned skin.
PART ONE. PART TWO WILL COME OUT LATER!! the wall sex will show up I promise! I just have to find a way to place it in to the plot.
"Daddy, may I show you a room." Dean sat in his Alphas lap on the couch "hmm, sure baby. Are you unsure with it?" Dean nodded at his Daddys question while taking his hand in his to take them both to the door.
The discord: Supernatural Family: https://discord.gg/suyZQfC
Sam, Castiel and Dean are on the road once again. Having a call from Bobby telling them where to go and what was happening. It was a place Dean hoped he would never see again.
Today Cas wanted to buy some furniture so he could actually have somewhere to sit and sleep.
Sam was staying quiet, where Dean would constantly try to get someones attention.
"Well, well, well. She's a pretty little thing," Lucifer smirked his hand trailing down the small girl's arm, a whimper was let out as Castiel ripped the tape off her mouth. "Like to hear them scream, Castiel?"
Then just when he thought that he was entirely spent, Dean’s orgasms rippled through him with such force like never before, that he tumbled forward and buried his face into Castiel’s neck whilst their bodies emptied all of the pent-up passion from sitting too close, or gazing too intently.
Dean though, wasn’t exactly considering any of this as he pawed around in his wardrobe, because his mind was far, far away. He wanted to bleed because the pain forced him to feel something unlike the discomfort of losing the man he loved. He wanted to feel things differently, even for the first time, to worship their bond because it was a miracle, to come together again and explore until they breached boundaries. All of a sudden his thoughts were so wild that he moved towards the bathroom and flipped on the light before staring at himself in the mirror.
"Will it be painful to lose your wings?" Dean cringed from the thought. "Because Sam said—"
"Does being like this ever become easier?" Jack offered a frown and sighed, "or does it just get more difficult? What's it like for you…being gay and in a relationship with another guy?"
After he supplied the evident appearance of Lee Webb in town, the younger man collected the plate and cups and he retreated to the kitchen to clean up the wares. Lending an ear seemed to be unavoidable, since his father was always a loud conversationalist, and he oftentimes decided that every single person in the room needed to listen to him. Dean had gotten accustomed to these flaws that settled on his father's character, and he wondered whether he would ever learn to be parted from such a loving person in his life if the situation arose.
“I can handle myself,” Dean said in an uneven tone but firm enough to deliver the message, one that cracked Castiel’s heart. “I don’t need anyone to look after me.”
But as he kept wallowing in his own thoughts on the patio, Cas curled up in the window seat and gazed at the storm coming their way. For a while he hadn't really been able to decipher his feelings in regard to Dean. He hadn't really gotten a chance to sit down and abundantly ponder on the damage done to such a precious thing. Because this was so much more than any of them and Cas was slowly beginning to wonder if he was the one at fault. And as he had been traversing the world, sitting on benches and beside rivers, most of his energy had been spent on shutting out what had occurred between them.
“You just can’t help it, can you?” Dean turned around and connected their eyes as he smiled in disbelief. “You’re always dishing out these lines so smoothly. It’s almost as if you’re a natural tease.”
He could have seen the world in those wide blue eyes.
"Wow," Claire stared in awe. "That's harsh. Sounds exactly like what Jody told me a couple weeks ago when I told her that I couldn't let Amy go."
to you. If he says he's in this for the long haul then you best believe he is. Ain't no other man or woman out there who's going to look golden in his eyes, if you get what I'm saying. Because there's just you and once you're young and things get this serious between you and someone else, once I started hearing him talk about marrying you, youths don't go that direction if they don't mean it." She nudged his shoulder and he cast a saddened look in her direction. "He walked in the damn house crying today and I hauled myself upstairs to get whatever it was out of him but he wouldn't talk."
“Anyone else here?” Sam rubbed his hands together to generate some warmth as the snowflakes fell lightly onto Littleton after much anticipation.
"What look?"
"Dean, we need to stop this right now," Cas warned. "Before we expounded on our feelings for each other, you fell in love with me without realizing it. And I have always been an angel. I have always had these…crappy ties to Heaven. If you can stand in front of me and judge me for the bad decisions the rest of the angels and Chuck have made, then I really must ask you to reassess your feelings for me. Because you claim to not care whether I'm human or an angel. But right now, it feels as if you'd rather have me only if I'm a human than when I'm an angel who has ties to your worst enemy."
The wedding was quite spectacular indeed, as all family gatherings were. John had a little too much to drink which left him tipsy and spreading jokes all around the crowd that now dispersed all in good spirits. But the tremendous weight of losing another member of the family who resided inside the house was more of a tragedy than a happiness altogether for Dean. And no matter how hard he tried to suffocate the guilty trip of feeling entirely dissatisfied, nothing could cheer him up.
“Dean, I am your brother, and I deeply care about you holding in your tensions which should be released by a suitable girlfriend…or
Blue eyes were as wide as saucers.
“I’m too young to be your girlfriend but keep saying nice things to me.”
It was like leaping off a pier, believing that the water promised so much warmth, only to pierce the surface and realize that the temperature was below 0 degrees. He was freezing, literally and losing himself by never being really sure about what to do. What to say. This wasn't going to work at all if they kept taking steps backwards instead of purposely forward. And if they couldn't pass through this cloud of doubt and change, then Dean was afraid that either of them would really have to walk away for good.
"Damn," Dean whistled in amazement and he glanced at the older man who smiled at the mountains, "first of all, you could swear every second when you're high. Secondly, didn't know I had a uterus but if I could make your babies, I sure would."
He stared at himself in the mirror before ascertaining that the ring would stay in the leather jacket's pocket for many years to come because they always seemed to drift backwards after leaping ahead. Was it always going to be like this? Was Claire's statement about Castiel being overly sensitive really something of truth? Surely he seemed to be like that at times, but then Dean realized that he wasn't different either. He was a lot more sensitive and a lot more embarrassing by exhibiting symptoms of someone pumped with estrogen or at least that's what his father would have thought.
“He told us that hunters don’t do pets,” Sam piped up, folding his arms on the seat and leaning forward. “He waited till we were asleep and took the dog out somewhere far. When Dean woke up, I think he cried for more than a day.”
"Remember when I asked you earlier if me being a man physically makes you uncomfortable?" Cas tried again, fearing that he might wound their bond. But he needed to broach the topic.
She couldn’t ignore the excitement rushing through her body after remembering the papers Dean and Cas has presented her with. Even though she was above the age of eighteen and didn’t need to be adopted, the two of them had gone out of their way to ‘claim’ her as their daughter. They had said so many nice things to her that night. About how she was so kind and brave and so grown up already. They admired her willpower and wanted her to live with them in the bunker. And she had treasured those papers with their signatures at the bottom. It made her feel like she was finally belonged not just to Donna and Jody, but to Dean and Cas.
Dean wasn’t so sure that the good times would even cement the belief in Castiel’s mind that he wouldn’t wander into the arms of someone else. And that was the contributing factor to his anger, because he couldn’t decide what to do to justify the abundance of his love and the loyalty which seemed like the surest thing.
"Hello?" he hoarsely answered without checking the screen. Blame it on his fuzzy mind and the absence of flowers. And kittens.
Dean groaned, tossed his head back and tried to shut out her nonsensical rambling because Castiel’s behavior was so unsettling. The last time he felt backed into a corner and questioned in such a manner was many years ago when he entertained the likes of Lisa, and even then the intrusion by his best friend wasn’t so heavy as it was earlier. Flushed cheeks and an absolute silence? Why was Castiel so troubled by the notion of a match between himself and Charlie when he should be absolutely thrilled and supportive? Or maybe Dean was reading the conversation wrongfully by assuming that his friend was displeased when he was in fact generously ready to supply a celebratory spirit if such a match existed.
"We just made out, in your car," Cas laughed and the sound was like music to the hunter's ears, "for the first time. Do you realize that? Baby has fond memories, doesn't she?"
"Cas, you have no idea what this means to me."
Then when he started to play
“He told me all about panicking after you called,” Ruby said, then ruffled my already disheveled hair that never could be tamed. Afterwards, the lioness handed her boss a folder of pending documents for him to peruse and still I felt her aura was off. “Cas is what you’d call a Jack of all hearts. He catches the eyes and hearts of everyone.”
"How could anyone want to hurt him?" Charlie said two days after when they continued to give Dean a bath as best as they could because he couldn’t manage one on his own. "How could anyone hurt such a precious and beautiful person like him, Cas? He's so amazing, he's the nicest person I've ever met. And those guys thought they had the right to do this. How could this world be so fucked up? How could you look at someone and just decide that you're going to hurt them because of who they're with? Because they're different?"
"I'm not sure that sounds quite comforting." Castiel felt a dull pain inside his heart and swallowed down the paranoia of sarcasm delivered by the other man. He must have been overthinking those words but then the slight grimace from the severity of Dean's wounds didn't quite provide any clarity to soothe his worry. "Is it supposed to be comforting?"
"Anywayyy," Dean swallowed and shifted uncomfortably on his seat. "I've been doing some thinking. Like for a while now and I was wondering…I mean, weddings…what are your thoughts…Cas, would you stop looking at me like that?"
Sighing, Dean threw a glance at the other woman across the table: Cassandra. And he shook his head. "Sorry about this," he admitted in a soft tone. "Bet you didn't come over here to hear my life story."
Sam led a glowing Eileen, Adam and Carlie followed; a ravenous redhead from Scotland. And then Dean stiffly joined his brothers with Annalise in tow.
His brother made a face. Obviously. But when he was simply told that switching up seats for the long ride home allowed him more time to read and sleep, Sam obliged to Cas. He shrugged, glanced at Dean and after there were no objections, the taller Winchester fitted his lanky frame into the front seat and barefacedly pushed in the damn mixtape.
“Just don’t,” he turned away from her glorious stare. “Okay? Just stop being so damn good at getting into my head and pretend nothing’s happening.”
Dean actually chuckled as his chest prickled from all kinds of emotions. "To go home and drink away the big disappointment I am to you. I can't flirt, remember?"
“I’m never going to be like them and do you know why?” Castiel captured Dean’s face between his palms softly, his fingers curling into the soft tendrils. “Because for the first time in my entire life, I’ve found someone who looks at me with eyes that don’t judge my flaws or my past. Or my peculiarities in my attire. I’ve told you before, Dean, and you’ve shared the same sentiments; that we’ve always been searching for someone who shared the same love for Jane Austen as we do. And it’s not just as simple as it sounds.”
In two days, Charlie was seated next to a daytime teacher in a classroom, with the main intent to observe and learn about the many subjects. Therefore, when she related the news to Dean over the phone, his first reaction was a loud cheer followed by an exceptional assessment of her strength and character. He was more than pleased to support her in anything she needed and matching his enthusiasm and passion, Castiel couldn’t contain his excitement after she showed up at the Novak’s estate.
“What?” Dean’s eyes showed nothing but utmost amazement because he couldn’t have heard correctly.
“Oh, really?” Castiel laughed hoarsely and seemed impressed, “you just flew over the terms boyfriends, soul mates, even lovers, and delved right into fuck buddies. Quite astonishing how your mind works all of a sudden. Leading us constantly into intimacy when you actually used to favor our long conversations more than anything else in the world, as I can recall.”
“Please don’t walk away from me,” Cas suddenly said in a wounded tone as tears glistened in his blue eyes. “Dean, I don’t want us to crumble anymore. This is me begging you not to hate me because I—”
Bad decisions and then forgiveness.
“How’s the wine, Dean?” Castiel slipped in between John’s ramblings. “You’re taking it slow and by far that’s the best decision to savor the quality.”
“Yeah,” Dean nodded, trying a smile but failing miserably. “Yeah, let’s do that.” Still fearful.
"Of course, she did," Castiel hugged himself and fondly assessed the warm countenance of the younger man. "You didn't realize it was missing for almost a week, did you?"
The title was so…definite and felt so real.
"Who is John McKinnon, the other victim," Sam had a headache from the links in the case. "So Kelly was the first victim, then we had John, then Miranda."
"I'm sorry, but regardless of those, you're the most handsome man I have ever cast my eyes on."
It was like two unstoppable forces about to blast into one another; one obviously aimed to scold persistently and the other just wishing to jump in his car and drive back to the dorms.
“Babe,” Cas collected Dean into his arms and hugged him tenderly. He pressed a kiss onto the other man’s forehead. “I’m going to love you until I fix all your broken pieces back together. And whilst I’m doing that, I’ll try to fill every void in your life.”
A/N – This is a heavy 'Dean' chapter.
"Well, it's good to know that I can prove you wrong," Dean picked up the baby from the floor and twirled him around, the soft giggles warming his soul. Then resting the fat bundle onto his right hip, he sought out Jess in the kitchen by Ellen's side, the two of them instantly beaming at him. "Three days away from this place and I missed it so much."
For ten full minutes the two of them didn't return, the kitchen door pulled shut and everyone else resuming their actions prior. But Dean was distracted and he almost forgot that he was tasked with scoring until Sam demanded that he pull his attention back into the game. Those green eyes constantly flicked towards that part of the house though, where a conversation was obviously occurring and he was clueless what the issue was. Could it be him? Was something happening that he wasn't aware of? Was it Crowley?
As they hopped into the car, Dean thought about how selfless Cas was. Of how he focused on the good instead of the bad. Throughout their lives so far, nothing ever stopped Cas from protecting someone he believed the world in. Like Dean. If anyone tried to compromise Dean’s existence, Cas blasted them without sparing a second.
Five houses more and Dean could literally feel his chest exploding from so many conflicting emotions hammering away all at once. The injustice of families broken by sibling rivalry, alcohol, drugs and death. The income of one member of the family having to maintain an entire house of six. The early promise of death for a woman who was losing her husband because of cancer and there was nothing she could do to save him, nor could she escape the faith of having to work two jobs to tend to their three children. And by the time he accompanied Charlie into the last house, Dean was on the verge of tears, heavily burdened by his own life compared to those of others and feeling like a failure in so many ways.
Slowly, Castiel reached for his right hand but then he pulled back after second thinking the bold gesture. It was enough to force the two of them to divert their gaze, and as the absence of words remained like ice between them after revealing so much before, there was nothing left to do but stand in each other’s company.
Rolling my eyes, I slid open the doors and welcomed the gush of cold air that immediately was replaced by a growing warmth from nervousness. Weak in the knees was never my sort of thing. Women especially couldn’t achieve that reaction and most times they never managed to get me to open up until after the second date. But so far, Dean was so close to unwrapping my inner thoughts that the possibility of becoming so exposed frightened me. Clearly this was a man, a
in between herself and Castiel. And immediately, he decided that he would not enjoy the movie because to sit next to a man who distrusted him to spare the truth wasn’t something that he favored. He thought that they were close enough to be honest with each other and obviously secrets still resided between them.
Dean at first offered a distant look and then he blinked. "Head over heels. Smitten, if you'd like to call it that. Dammit, I probably sound so corny right now."
“Dean there?” he asked gruffly, holding his dripping wet umbrella in his left hand, and his hat in his right.
And the way he smelled; Midnight and Two; a mixture of sandalwood and lavender, Irish Spring, fruity shampoos, whiskey, his breath warm and minty.
"Okay, so you feel that it's fair for reporters to do what they do to me?" Dean sounded as worked up on the moment too.
Most of all, Dean favored the older man's neck, delighting himself in sucking on the weak spot right below Castiel's right ear as he reached between them and tugged down their slacks. Very soon, they were deprived of those and left with nothing on but their socks whilst the sheets twisted and their fingers entwined and as Dean moved slowly, grinding their hips together, Castiel lost himself. Those blue eyes became listless, focused on the ceiling and lips parted enough so that the younger man kissed them tenderly. And with their cocks slotted together, he weakly sat up, thighs clamping the older man's hips between them, and he slowly began to roll a rhythm that was too blissful for silence.
"Why do you keep going back there?" Sam was curious as he sat down, reaching for a potato chip from the bag. "Are you looking for Nessie?" He offered Cas an amused expression.
I think I may need to change the title as they are not really little anymore, but i'm keeping it for now!
But he felt the bed dip as Cas came back, he jumped at the contact Cas made with his ass, but Cas made him relaxed quickly.
But hey leave a comment if you want, and feedback that's also appreciated. :)
Dean packed his things away while Castiel walked to his desk at the front putting all Deans work, in a nice file it was green. Dean smiled to himself as he waved to Castiel as he left the room, he walked to his dorm walking in on his friend naked dancing on the bed with two other people.
"I-It's my pee-pee..." Dean moved the pillow from his lap allowing Cas to see the problem. Dean saw Cas move further away as he let the pillow fall on the floor. "Oh, well I think it's time for bed Dean, can you do it by yourself or do you need me to help with getting dressed?"
Five hours Jensen was stuck with Chris again, luckily Jensen told Dean not to bother picking him up, since he wanted to be with friends, but really Jensen had football practice. That meant being stuck with Chris again.
Sam would’ve screamed if his mouth wasn’t full of his brother's cock as Lucifer forced into Sam’s unprepared ass, eyes tearing up before Dean let go of his head allowing Sam to breathe. “Mmm, Good boy Dean.” It was weird hearing Lucifer praise Dean, Castiel instantly decided he didn’t like anyone other than him to praise the young boy since he growled out his reply.
“I wanna stay,” Dean replied slowly watching Cas stand up and nod before walking off to the stairs and disappearing up them leaving Dean with just a “Goodnight Dean.”
I'll go in to more Sam, Gabriel and Lucifer next chapter!
"Will.. can...Can you fuck me?" Jesse blushed making Dean laugh at him.
Alpha Castiel
Looking towards Dean who was looking at Jensen confused. "What?" Jensen was prepared for the fist coming from Chris so he just moved away, pissing Chris off more. "Seriously Chris lay off, just cuz I stopped ya getting excited by punchin a nerd." Jensen didn't miss the fire in Chris' eyes light up as he tackled Jensen, bringing him to the floor. "At least I'm not a shit little faggot with two dads!" Chris growled as he tried punching Jensen. Until he was pulled off by Dean, who had walked over. "Whats going on between you two!?"
"Misha, I'm gonna fuckin come..!" Jensen growled out, but groaned when he saw Misha's eyes close and hummed around him when he came. "f-fuck!" Jensen panted, while Misha pulled off. "You good there Jen?" Misha licked his lips, only to crawl over Jensen as he planted a kiss on his lips, Jensen only nodded to answer while they kissed each other. Until a knock on the door made them jump and pull the covers up to hide.
Sam and Gabriel are slightly appearing in here as (they're married!)
Dean had woken up all hot and sweaty, he was now regretting coming back everything else was fine, but as soon as Dean saw his dad he soon figured out how useless he actually felt.
Castiel pretended to think about it, flipping them over Dean back on his back under Castiel. "Anything for you Dean." Castiel kissed Deans lips softly before pulling away to go in between Deans legs that opened up for him instantly.
Everything was going good, between Castiel and Dean, they mainly just made sure they had sex over every surface in the house. While dragging a female back to slit her throat.
Dean glared at the man who was staring like a deer in the headlights, with small steps Dean reached the table with the knives lifting the sheet from the top revealing everything to the man. Picking up his favourite blade twirling it around in his hand while he walked to stand in front of his mother's killer.
The stranger smiled. "The names Castiel, but you may call me Cas!"
"Alright, where were we?" Castiel perched Dean on his hip while looking over the information Sam had gotten the first day he and Dean changed.
I'm going to be changing a few things around, still supernatural related but not just Castiel/Dean.
"So they don't come back as ghosts and kill us." Dean put simply as he walked past letting the body burn. "Um, Dean.. your not... never mind." Connor looked towards the fire, Sam looked between the two as he walked off to give them space. "What's your last name?"
"Shouldn't Dean get to choose for himself, Omegas are allowed to do that are they not?" Castiel calmly stated as he backed away again calming the wolf inside him.
There was a pause before Dean text back.
Arrow being Arrow he had been asking around beforehand so he had a few odd numbers that could possibly help, one, especially from an older man who came into town a few months ago, took Arrows interest as he was asking around about a suspicious bear attacks, a random hunter, he'd been polite enough until Arrow started asking a too many questions, but before he left he gave his number as well as another number saying he would be able to help Arrow more.
(See the end of the chapter for
Arrow was a 16 year old, his mother and father both happily married, a normal life but Arrow being the curious teen he was started searching for creatures in the dark, he had been wandering around town asking older men if they knew about monsters, some told him to piss off, others seemed interested until they got bored or too drunk.
Dean looked around it was just them in the hallway until they heard footsteps, it was the principle and he looked pissed. "Get to class Now!" he pushed Dean to the classroom he was meant to be at, and it was the English room. The class had already started as he sat down at the back "Winchester? You're late," Deans looked up, and holy shit his friend was right...
Dean spent weeks trying to forget what happened at the store but he couldn’t. He couldn’t forget the guy's scent. None of his friends, family or coworkers that actually talked to him mentioned his weird behaviour.
Everyday after that everything was going good, until other Demons came walking around his town. The town Dean was in was owned by the Knights of Hell, he had fit in with them so they took him in trained him to be a good enough soldier.
"Why does this have to happen to me?" Jensen whispered into Deans' shoulder, trying to ignore the growing pain in his back.
"Did you fuck?" Cas snapped at Arrow who shifted towards Dean. "N-no... Jay and I just talked and got drunk then he jerked me off as I... uhh... anyway I did it to get you both to stop ignoring me." Arrow didn't look up curling up against Dean rubbing his head on his chest. "There are other ways of getting our attention," Dean muttered but Arrow rolled his eyes. "Jay knows tho... about the whole uhh thing."
"Saw your car, now let us in." Dean snapped as Jensen opened the door wider to let them in. "Why, you here thought you doing your own case?" Jensen perched on the table. "That was three weeks ago, we came home to an quiet bunker and you weren't answering your phone, so tell us what the fuck is going on." Dean wasn't having any bullshit today.
Mistakes and badly written smut thing will appear. possibly a confusing plot, but Again I'll fix it when I can!
Dean was driving to work with Cas following behind in his car, Dean was going try get Cas a job at the place he worked, mainly because he wants Cas to be the one.
"Morning sleeping beauty!" Chase was purposely being cheerful. "Oh! Naughty boys back!" Dean stumbled his way over to them both, snatching the coffee and food off Chase. "Hey! That was rude!"
Standing up, with a noise of protest from Dean, but Cas quickly shushed him tracing a finger around the wet, tight, heat of Dean. "You sure?" Dean bit his lips pushing back on Cas' finger. "Yes sir." That was the only approval Cas needed, kissing the back of Dean neck while pushing his finger inside Dean. "Cas.. I think you need to lube up remember.." Cas groaned pulling out his finger, walking over to his desk, Dean stayed still.
"Sam! Fucking slow down there!" Dean would let go of the chair but he was scared he was gonna fall, looking over at Castiel and Gabriel who had silently joined the room wouldn't be much help. So Dean just bared with the roughness of Sams' hand before jumping and moaning at the sudden warm mouth around him. "Dammit Sammy," Dean opened his legs wider allowing Sam more room.
"You're going to cum on my cock you got that?" Castiel whispered into Deans' ear, biting at his neck. "Y-Yes Sir," Dean hiccuped and moaned as Castiel rammed into his prostate over and over again, getting closer Dean growled biting Castiel causing him to moan as a metallic taste came inside his mouth, as he came in between them both.
Castiel sighed slowly as he rubbed Deans back slowly to calm him, Castiel knew Dean would need time to adjust to him and his new life with Cas. "You do know you're safe now, whenever you're with me nothing bad will ever happen. My arms will always be open to you, and I'll always come when you call me. You're mine now Dean. My mate."
Cas had decided to get up to go to the spot Dean really wanted to go, with the help of Cas, they both got there sitting down on the cold grass, cold air hitting their faces Dean shifted closer to Cas, the sun had set an hour ago, which was good because all Dean could see when he looked up were stars, and a planes flying. "What are you thinking about?" Dean turned his head so he looked at Cas "just life, problems... hey wanna make a wish on that plane?" Dean pointed to a low flying plane going past, with a nod from Cas, Dean noticed that he had closed his eyes.. Thinking of a wish Dean saw him and Cas, happy.
But now he was happy but lonely, sighing to himself as he waked over to the lift pressing the button to go to the ground floor. Once he was out the lift he walked to his parking spot where Baby was. Once starting her up he started driving to his work place.
Hissing as Castiel cock was removed he slowly slipped off the stool looking up at Castiel frowning at the cock that was covered in blood before eyes widening in surprise and gasping “That was kinky!” Dean giggled putting his arms up to Castiel.
Jensen quickly took Misha hand in his running off to his room, slamming the door behind them.
"Sammy? Sammy!?" Sam blinked not realising he was spaced out, Jensen had his hand on his shoulder, the grip wasn't hard or anything but it made Sam have a warm feeling surrounding him. "Yeah?" Sam looked towards Jensen, who looked worried and confused. "You good, me and Dean are gonna get some food ya want anythin?" Jen asked Sam. "No thanks," Sam wanted to be alone right now to sort out his little problem down below.
"Good, see you both later, for another movie night." Castiel stated as he walked out the kitchen back up the stairs to Dean, who was lying on his back snoring once again.
"Alright, you're not here to hurt us?" Tall and long haired man asked he was clearly weary of Shay. "Why would I harm you, you haven't done anything to harm me so there is no need. But if you are worried about what I can do then I will hold my powers back until you find me somewhat trustworthy enough." Shay didn't find these humans as a threat even if he was currently tied to a chair. Shay saw them looking at each other before the pretty man stepped forward untying him.
Also would help if y'all would give me some stuff like what you would like to read and yeah.
"So you just going to leave me alone, well with Misha?" Jensen looked up to his dad who was growing taller standing at Deans chest. "Well bet you could find something to entertain yourselves?" Jensen sighed after the list of things Dean was rambling on about "ok, we'll be fine, but you will try and call every night right?"
Sooo how was that??
"So what we gonna watch?" Dean sat at the furthest away from Cas as he picked the remote up to select a movie for them both to watch, together.
Castiel did, however, have a job, he was a high school teacher, so every day he would always be scanning his classes for his next victim.
Dean was woken with a loud thud and on the floor. "Oof, ouch." Dean rubbed his head as he stood Castiel was still in the bed with paper scattered around.
I actually forgot about half the stuff in the tags so I'm sorry.
Dean rolled his eyes at the text, but he has a point..
"Lets just kill this stupid son of a bitch." Dean grumbled grabbing his keys as he stormed out the door.
Sam thanked the three girls, as he headed towards the impala, Dean hopping into the front seat with Cas tucked under him. "Cas, is really good at being a kitten. Hell, you would of thought he was an actual kitten," Sam spoke to the animals who he knew couldn't talk back.
Dean woke up remembering what he and Cas had done over the phone, smiling to himself as he got himself up to get cleaned up, ready for the day. Well the rest of the day.
"How come you don't groom your own wings?"
A few more tears fell from Deans eyes. "Dean, whats wrong?" Cas held Dean tighter. "Don't let me go Cas, I don't wanna break again!" Dean let himself sob into Cas' shoulder. "Dean, you don't have to worry about that. I'm always going to be here. I think its time for you to tell me whats going on in that dark part of your head of yours.."
"Ahh, I've heard about you, you've been in plenty of scenes! Kicky ones too," Cas was now looking at the floor embarrassed.
Dean was smiling as he was sat in his alphas office, his heat was still going but Dean didn't care, his alpha had already knotted Dean over his desk.
Anyway comment, it makes me happy and makes me wanna write more, so yeah, I'm not demanding or begging for comments, they just make me smile on a bad day.
It was hard to block out that voice's screams as he slit Dean's throat.
, before he was happy that the little guy was alright in his new home. "Now where in my angel?" Dean mumbled walking to their shared bedroom, seeing Castiel laying watching the TV.
"What were you doing on the side of the road?" Castiel asked wanting to know how would leave a kid like this on his own on Christmas for god sake!
Dean didn't even get a good look at the guy, maybe next time, smiling to himself as he got himself some dinner waiting for the place he needed to go tomorrow.
Sowwie i'm not feeling good... but hope this little updates good enough.
Dean groaned rubbing his head looking up towards Cas, he still felt small but not childlike "am I back to - What the fuck is wrong with my voice!?" Dean stood looking down at himself, throwing his hand in the air placing them on his hips glaring at Cas. "Why am I a girl!?"
"Misha? I'm gonna sound like a teenage girl, do you like anyone at school?" Jensen looked at Misha, his blue eyes were twinkling in the low light of the moon. "I dunno, well there's this guy, he's kinda hot you know? With his green eyes, pink lips, and a nice sharp jawline that I would love to kiss along." Jensen didn't miss the pink of Misha tongue licking his lips, all while looking at Jensen. "Jen, you know who I'm on about?"
"I heard your mind calling me, it seemed desperate so I came." Castiel stood awkwardly in the room, the scent of aroused Omega still was hanging in the room. Dean could never smell Cas' scent, didn't know if he was and Alpha, Beta or Omega.
Castiel moodily threw is clothed on walking towards the living room, his grumpy look left his face when he saw Dean decorating the tree, with their children, they had picked the tree out with their little girl. "Starting without me?" Cas lent against the doorframe with a soft smile.
What Misha just did isn't what 'Friends' do." Sam said while Dean glued his eyes on the road. "Shuttup... He just wants to hang out, right?" Jensen sat up right, letting his arms rest in the middle as he leaned forward in between Sam and Dean.
They waited four more days to actually come up with a plan, and used the time for Jensen to heal a small bit. "Are you sure that'll work? I mean what are they weak to?" Jensen was sprawled out on the bed with Misha looking down at him. "Well, normal vamps ya just cut their heads off right? And werewolves you have silver bullets?"
"Oh, you the guys he sent, thought you'd be... older?" Arrow walked slowly towards the car. "We'll take that as a compliment, but yes we're the guys he sent so wanna tell us what's going on?"
"Don't worry your safe from John," Mary said to calm Dean. Cas was hiding away in the kitchen as Dean let his mother and brother settle in.
Dean was past the point of getting embarrassed right about now he grown used to walking around naked in front of his brother it just became another one of them things now. But the feeling of being on Castiel’s hardening cock inside him and the sight of Sam bending over in front of him made his cock twitch in the hand of Castiel, both of the other brothers had joined the room now.
Upon waking he was in a barn? Hissing as his wings were in the most painful position they could be, not being able to do anything about it as his legs and hands were chained together, two Demons were staring at him smiling. "Hey hybrid, lost your powers hmm?" The demons snarky comment made Shay roll his eyes. "Not very talkative are we?" Same Demon made a gesture to the other, as he walked around the back his fingers lightly touching Shays wings making him twitch. "You tell us what you're doing here, and we won't hurt you or you little angel friend over there," The Demon standing in front of Shay forced his head in the direction of Matthew who was chained to the wall, blood was on his feathers. "Please... D-Don't..." Shay whispered but the Demons ignored him twisting his wings causing Shay to topple forward screaming in pain.
Sam: 3 year old
"Arrow? Do you need to go to the nurse?" The principle was at his side, with Arrow shaking his head. "No, I'm fine. I'm... fine." Arrow whispered. "Arrow, your mother told me to ta-"
Arrow gulped as the man became demanding.
Few years after everything seemed to be going great, after his 35th birthday he quickly was in the darkest parts of his life, he went from working at his office to working from home. Only leaving his house to go shopping for what he needed to get him through a few weeks.
So, what ya wanna see Dean and Cas turn into? I've got Puppy, Baby, Kitten and that's it, but if you got anymore I'll pop it in as an idea!
Castiel watched Dean stare at the blood trailing down the girl's chest, he knew Dean enjoyed biting and rough sex, but he never thought anything from it leaning towards Lucifer to whisper into his brother's ear. "Lucifer, I wanna test somethings out with my boy toy, undo her left arm for a moment." Lucifer glanced over to Dean also seeing him in a trance at the blood, only for his head to snap up as Castiel cleared his throat.
"Is it that enjoyable?" Cas asked the Demon as the tail flicked in interest "You've never.. wait.. of course you haven't your an Angel! But yes it's enjoyable, try it sometime when you're not busy appearing on me." Dean finished his rant, and a sound of a zip. Spinning around seeing the Angel about to put his hand down his pants. "Whoa, whoa, whoa! Not now!" Dean rushed forward grabbing the wrist of the Angel before it disappeared in his pants.
Then again, he’d imagined confessions and making love, too.
Life has been busy in the two months since they’ve become a couple. Besides work and reveling in (and getting used to being) a couple, there’s been a change in their living situation. Dean’s no longer renting the home on the ocean, instead living in Castiel’s one bedroom rented cottage with him because his new home is being remodeled and they agreed that his money was better put toward that. The place that Debbie the realtor found him overlooks the ocean and has its own private, sandy beach and an expanse of lawn that’s ideal for gatherings and “for Matthew to play around on without getting shells in his knees.” It’s absolutely perfect. Bobby’s crew is working on it now and expects it to be done by October. They still go there to enjoy it, though—Dean’s beach and his lawn and his rooftop deck with panoramic views and his built-in pool. Castiel has enjoyed having some input—lots of input, since Dean proclaims he’s “no good at these things.” He’s excited to spend as much time there with Dean as Dean chooses. And though he doesn’t want to assume, he certainly hopes that when it’s done, Dean will want them to live with him.
“I think Daddio would say yes if you asked.”
“Totally,” Dean says with mock seriousness. “You shouldn’t be left unattended.”
Cas shakes his head and pulls back.
Dean flicks wide eyes toward Cas and sees the same wide-eyed look sent back to him.
“I didn’t even know we had food here.”
to), but Dean told him over and over that he was “fucking hot” and would beg him to do it time and again until he stopped being embarrassed. Of course, he’s embarrassed himself countless times in front of Dean, but Dean always laughs it off, so it’s stopped being mortifying and started being funny. Dean’s embarrassed himself a number of times, too, he says, but Castiel can’t think of any occasions (though they have laughed together a lot at some of the things Dean’s done or said). Love is blind, perhaps, or just accepting.
“Yes. I’ll eat and then come up with a distraction.”
“Oh, sorry, I don’t make oodles of money like you, Mr. Male Model. If that
“I hope so.”
“Bitch, please, we both know you’re better.”
“Damn, Cas, baby, you are so fucking hot,” Dean gasps, nosing his earlobe.
She stares at him as he glares at her. “What? What the fuck do you mean by—”
“And I can’t even tell them how nice they look.”
“You’re willing to lose the chance to have more with him? Seems like that would be worse, to me.”
