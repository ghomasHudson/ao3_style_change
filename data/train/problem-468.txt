Sherlock sighed in relief and sat on the bed. He thought his knees might have been shaking. And here John was, walking in like Sherlock hadn't just had a panic attack.
Sherlock's voice washed water over the angry wound, cleaning it for the moment of spiked irritation and those barbed words that tasted like battery acid and left a bad taste in John's mouth.
As the train began to leave, as Sherlock glimpsed a flash of Mary's face, half-hidden in shadow, as the two of them headed onwards with John passed out, exhausted from his drug-induced meltdown, his mind raced.
, after I buried you and came home to find you sitting in my flat three years later like nothing happened, that gives me the right to know when you're thinking of trying it again!"
“I’ve heard that, too.” John said with a raised eyebrow, but Felix let the topic fall away, changing the subject as they turned onto the third floor.
"No, John, you're not dead, and neither am I for that matter. You are, however, kneeling in dirty water in a very busy street, and I would feel much better if you were sitting in our flat where it's safe and, in general sense of the word, clean. So, if you don't mind, that's where I'm going to take you now."
Anderson looks to Lestrade as if he has any say in the matter and he shrugs. He'd rather not alienate Holmes so soon, not when he's the best chance at catching whoever murdered Rachel; not if they're still on the loose, maybe out to kill again.
!" John yelled, waving his gun towards the door. Sherlock didn't like the look in his eyes, a calm determinant anchored in the deep blue. "You need to get Mary and get out of here before more of them come."
"You asked me why I did it. I still can't tell you why, mainly since I don't really know myself." John paused, wincing as an old bandage was peeled off. "I was alone, I needed the money to stay on Baker Street and the clinic just wasn't enough since I had to pay the whole rent. I…I was hired because of an accident—only it wasn't really an accident—and they sent me through training." Sherlock began to wrap gauze around John's arm and he lifted it up so he could wind it all the way around. "It was a lot like the army actually. I think they were looking for people like me; someone maladjusted and lonely with a history of military experience—"
“I never doubt that you love me, but there were days – there are days – that I believe you forget. You forget what we are to each other, that we’re a partnership, not a one-man crew. You try to pull the levers and turn the gears yourself, and I don’t think you remember that I’m there to help you with all of it, transport and everything. You’re making me feel like I’m rolling some great boulder up a hill and watching you do it too, and neither of us can help each other. So, yes, to answer your question, maybe I was going to go. Maybe I was. I don’t know. I guess I won’t ever know, not really, because you found out, and I can’t look you in the face and say I’ll leave you. I don’t have the ability or the desire to do that.”
Sherlock's chest is heaving as if he's run a marathon and Mycroft considers himself lucky that nothing heavier was within arm's distance.
With that one gunshot, Sherlock thinks that he has lost John after all, which wasn't fair for many, many reasons, but mainly Sherlock thinks it's unfair because, as much as he hates to admit it, if John were to die, he would rather it be by Sebastian Moran himself, and not by some stupid, scrawny street git who works for him.
Dazed, he rises to his feet and stumbles to the window. Through the haze, he’s remembered that lightning doesn’t make that sound. Only one thing makes that sound.
"I knew what I would be doing to you. I knew, and I'm sorry. You have to believe me, John. I've been—I've been quite inhuman since I left. I did things I'm not proud of, I hurt people because I couldn't control myself, I even went on a hunger strike because I thought some poor old woman in Hong Kong was trying to poison me. Turns out she just thought I liked tofu, and she was correct. I wish she had just
“Will you please focus on the amazing sight before you?” Sherlock snaps. “Or do you see angels all the time walking around London?”
"Why did you do it?" Sherlock asked, pressing more gauze to one of John's wounds. They seemed endless, like staring up into a starry night, blood smeared across the heavens. "Let them recruit you?"
“Not by mortal standards—” She glanced up from her glass and smiled. “Ah, our most beloved immortal has awoken. How is his Highness feeling today?”
"You could not have Jim Moriarty or myself more wrong than you do in this moment." Sherlock began lowly, fingers clasped together. "You think Jim Moriarty is a man of principle, a man with rules, like me. You think Jim Moriarty is a man of decency and propriety. You think Jim Moriarty is a man, but he is not a man, John, he is a beast. An absolute beast, a monster that lives in the dirty veins of London, a pathogen that snatches cells up and swallows them and turns them into viruses. Jim Moriarty is a cancer, a gangrenous limb that needs to be sliced off before infection can spread."
"Her name is Hanne." Sherlock said calmly. "I lodged with her family in Syria. Vacationing Norwegians. With my conversational knowledge of the language, I fit right in. Perhaps a little too well…" He added, eyeing Hanne, who was still red in the face with anger.
The bathroom door shuts in Sherlock’s room and his eyes flicker to Mycroft before he continues to read, ignorant of the events three days prior.
He doesn't look like an angel, or at least not from what Sherlock can see from his position, but everything in him, around him, about him, screams at Sherlock that this being in front of him must be one.
. It wasn't an assent to a promise that John, in their line of work, couldn't possibly keep. It was an acknowledgment that, if the time came and John's gun was pointed at him, Sherlock would accept it, knowing that John loved him, that John would have his reasons and Sherlock would trust him absolutely and completely.
Moran was going to make him clean up Sherlock's body. He'd always wondered who had gotten Moriarty's off the roof; in the ensuing grief, he'd never thought to ask, but it was incredibly obvious. Lestrade had once mentioned the lack of a body, but John hadn't been listening. He'd never been listening, not when all he could hear was the crunch of bone and smell the wet pavement. He heard it every day, every night, right up until the church bells chimed and the crunch never came but shattered on the floor at feet of Sherlock Holmes and John could hear everything again. He heard his deep breaths as he tried to breathe, heard his soft sobs, heard the fabric of his jacket scrape against the rough brick as he leaned against it and asked himself if Sherlock's hair had always been that dark, had he always been that pale, or was John imagining things again?
John sobered instantly, tapping his knuckles absentmindedly against Sherlock’s breastbone. “Irene…and what did she have to say about all of that?”
"None would do just as well." John said, his arms crossed as he stared down into the inked and divided city.
He stepped into Enlightenment just as he slipped into sleep, though he didn’t realise it until he woke up in a sweat. The room is immaculate, dark wood shelves that filled the spaces from high vaulted ceiling to the gilded balconies, to the floor, crammed with items of interest and information. His trophies. His treasure pile, his and his alone, like a great black beast upon a mountain of stolen gold, pickpocketed from the unsuspecting and snatched like a hungry thief from the stalls of mundane and ordinary lives. His cold little museum, where everything had its place.
"No, my personal best is one hour and five minutes. Once after a trip to Scotland I came back, refused him lunch and then insulted his latest girlfriend."
This was their punishment then: a stalemate. John did not want to go forward. He wanted to withhold something he had complete control over, without ceding any ground. Sherlock understood, and had reacted in a way that many who knew him wouldn’t have ever believed: he obeyed.
There is a noise from upstairs, a scrape of something on the wood floors. Not something falling, something—
"No, no, Bruges was for Jim. Those wounds you bear are for Jim, so that every time Sherlock fucks you, he'll see them and he'll know Jim put them there. He'll know they'll never fade, never go away, and that he caused them with his arrogance, his plastic invulnerability, and he'll know that he is every bit as mortal as you are because he hurts."
“But then I would sound like an idiot.” Sherlock continues, as if Lestrade hasn’t spoken. “She knew everything about Richard Brook and nothing about Moriarty, so she would be no help to you, even if she told you everything she knew, because it was about a man that didn’t exist.”
"I'm fine by the way." He croaked hoarsely. One look from Sherlock told him that the boy had a bruise forming on his side where he'd been kicked and a cut to the cheek from glass shrapnel as the window was smashed from the outside, but that he was otherwise uninjured. There were worse injuries; gunshots, stabbings, a good mangling-
“Yes. If you’d been injured, if you’d died, I don’t know what I would have done. I don’t know—taking you with me was never an option. You were safer here.”
As a child, Sherlock had never had patience for art. He saw nothing remotely useful or of interest to him in splashes pretending to be despair or boring English landscapes dotted with horses or vaginas masquerading as flowers or any other ridiculous means of expressionism. He liked symbolism, he liked detail, that much was true, but he never saw any value if it was splayed on a canvas.
The garage is glowing and he feels like he knows what it is to touch the sun. He’s running and it’s all around him and it’s hot, too hot, but John is there, beside him, so everything must be okay.
A hand grasped him on the shoulder and he turned sharply. John had barely enough time to react, leaning back in an attempt to keep his wine from spilling.
John stands in the doorway, slack jawed. Sherlock can't blame him. Emma isn't present, which is a relief. John said he felt bad enough breaking off their date to bring her back, and rightly so as no woman would want to come home with him and see this.
He takes another breath, as muddled and disgusting as it is. It has to be oil, has that greasy unmistakable smell. He looks back up to the train car, noting the fire damage—it's not recent, at least a decade old, so why this fresh burnt smell? And this particular one: it's the only carriage in the yard with this kind of damage. The others are all certainly out of date, but nowhere near as decimated as this.
Honestly, he felt like shit. Like he had slept in a rubbish bin full of liquid putrefaction that clogged his senses and had only woken when it was being compacted in the back of the truck, squeezing his head so tightly it felt like there wasn't even space for his own brain anymore. Sweat dampened the hair by his ears; he could feel the uncomforable warmness prickling under his clothes where it had already dried.
"I know you did it with the best intentions, but I—whoa—Christ—" John suddenly swayed back in the chair, his body relaxing as the rigidity bled out of him. It felt like his blood had turned to air and he was rising out of his seat, yet he knew gravity was still working as it always had. He felt himself falling, but then Sherlock was there, catching him, and somehow he and Mikheia managed to get him back into that fucking spare bedroom that he had been burning in all night and all day.
"Your brother asked me to convince you of my treachery." Mary smiled solemnly. "Do you really think he would hire someone that didn't know how to bluff?"
“I met with your Mr. Hoare not a month ago.” Vladimir began. “I believe that’s how you made the acquaintance of our prince, here?”
“They’re not saints.” John corrects, irate at the thought that somehow the man who had kidnapped him and then begun a psychological torture session decided he had the moral high ground to remark on anything that Sherlock or Lestrade did in a time of crisis. War had no rules, nor fingers to point with.
The fourth was entirely practical, not joyless, but more a matter of efficiency. And yet each time, it was Sherlock who asked, and each time, it had been no more planned or expected than the others that came before. John had come to learn not to consider it too deeply; they both knew what the answer would be, that it would always remain so.
He froze, slowly bringing his eyes up. He’d heard it too, the low, quick sound of an elevated heartbeat. Glancing up through his lashes, he watched as a doe came to the edge of the water, slim pink tongue dipping into the pond as it drank.
The silence wasn't screaming at Sherlock like it had before, when it was all white noise and static screeching and pounding in his head, pulsing and prodding like a black current underneath the frozen
"Did you always know how to do that," Sherlock's voice came calmly through the steam and empty whirring of the rusted machines. "Or did your employer teach you?"
The ambassador had not been the true target. The real target was his assistant, the true culprit of the crimes, all done in his name. John had had suspicions from the beginning, and he could tell forgery when he saw it.
Five minutes in with that yellow light, he couldn’t think properly. He could hardly say he was even able to when it started, or since he’d been wherever the hell they’d taken him. The flu, the drugs, the deprivation…it wasn’t as if that all added up to his health and good fortune.
He sits back, mulling his answer for a moment. "I think I will. She was just so young, Sarah. And her body—the brutality of it—it's just hard to take in. Hard to accept that it happened here, of all places."
"Sherlock." John said gently, firmly. "Sherlock, look at me." Sherlock let John's fingers guide his chin up. "I will never leave you. Ever. In any circumstance. And maybe you will kill me one day," John admitted, like he was saying there was a chance it would rain today, "But I'd rather it be you than anybody else."
The man pauses, looking over him again. "Your left hand has an intermittent tremor, along with calluses which indicate consistent gun use. You're far too tan for this climate, so active duty must not have been so long ago. Considering the ongoing withdrawal of American military force from Iraq redirected into Afghanistan, I would have to say the latter is more likely for you to have experienced intense and recent warfare.
Sherlock rushed around him, trying to hoist him up from under his arms. John screamed and Sherlock set him down. His hands were bloody.
The watery light of morning could barely drag its fingers on the floor, blocked by the thick curtains of a sparsely furnished room as the sun pulled itself from the foggy dregs of night, opening its great eye upon its sleeping side of the world.
"Unwise." Sherlock scoffed. "Many people's favourite ice cream flavours are Neapolitan. I need something more substantial."
John knew very well what Moran was planning to do. He was too smart to fire into a crowd, not because he might hit a civilian, but because he might miss. He was a trained sniper, accurate from a distance, not running across bumpy cobblestones that might jar his aim.
They let it wash over them, let it course through their veins and burn away the dirt and grime that had accumulated in their blood, clogged by loneliness. As it burned, it left them hot and fresh like rain on summer pavement until steam began to rise off them and their bones turned to jelly. The fire settled into their hearts as it grew and pulsed, stoking the coals like a furnace until sweat was drawn from every pore and it felt like they were in a sauna and not some inconspicuous hotel room in an inconspicuous city in a conspicuous country, not knowing the fate that quiet city held in store for them.
Right now, he was chasing that grey, that fucking grey, through the market as if the devil was on his heels, and perhaps in a sense he was. Bystanders turned briefly to look at them or yell, but they all passed by in a blur, becoming sparser as the crowds thinned and the market ended.
One day in, and he’s more interested in cracking the patina of this idyllic town than he’s been in anything in months. Bar fights, a biker gang, and a murdered prom queen addicted to cocaine.
He sighed as he chewed his gum, the taste already losing its flavour and reminding him that he was essentially chewing a piece of rubber. He had been perched on the balcony of the house for a good half hour already. The target was late.
“You’re an addict, Sherlock.” He said plainly, looking up at him, his face illuminated by the oil lamp on the table. “People don’t become one by being happy or content with how their lives are going. There is something within you that you need to address, and it all depends on if you want to. It will be hard – it might be the hardest thing you ever do –  but if you do it, if you agree to work on this, then I will be there with you. Not because I feel guilty or because you need looking after, but because I love you and I want to see you happy. It won’t happen overnight, but one day you’ll come out of it better than you were before, and you won’t find your existence so burdensome.”
He is speechless, because he has no clue what brought John to him, but he knows that he will let nothing on this earth take him away.
A pulse of cold fear panged through him as he realised who John was chasing, a man clad in grey that Sherlock knew with unflinching certainty was the same man from Mycroft's photograph.
He takes advantage of Moran ducking down as John returns fire, running as fast as he can down the ramp and behind the side of the elevator shaft, out of Moran’s sight.
Mikheia nodded. Mary stepped forward and hugged John before kissing him on the cheek and leading Mikheia out the doors and into the night.
passed as a silhouette; the bundle of hay draped with a blanket that they’d leaned against the saw horse counted even less so, but John had been relying on Moran’s blind desire for vengeance. He knew he wasn’t the kind of man who would wait if he was certain the odds of his victory where in his favour; when it was so close, and when he’d come so far, he wouldn’t hesitate.
Sherlock had never played nurse before, but he knew instinctually what to do. Taking an empty pewter canteen with him, he stalked the streets, quickly finding and baiting a young girl into a dark alley. He tasted her blood to be sure first, and she was clean, so he drank from her, filling the bottle as necessary and dropping her off, still alive, to be found in one of the pedestrian-heavy paths.
He slid across the floor, hastily opening the fridge, reaching into the crisper drawer. He grabbed at the tall container, opening the lid, but feeling its light weight and already knowing with a horrifying certainty: empty. In her warm welcome and by filching some to take to the bar, Harry had drained it all.
"He is an ancient evil." John says quietly. "Cunning, smart, and just bored enough to put them to use. He talked his way out of Sheol, if that tells you anything."
As the flames rise, bursting upwards like bright shoots in spring, Moran draws his gun and aims at Mikheia, and John trains his own pistol on Moran.
“What else?” Sherlock asks, interest bubbling inside him for the first time in eons. “What else could stop him?”
The door opens up to a blindingly white foyer bedecked with gold and black décor, every surface immaculate and spotless and so alien for Sherlock, who is used to ugly chairs and tacky wallpaper and mismatched stacks of war novels and science journals and boxes of slides littering every open space.
And suddenly, as he stumbles through barely visible underbrush with an angel under his arm and a friend holding him up, Sherlock knows that he will not live without John. He can survive, sure, but he will not live. He won't, and it will be his death. He was halfway to the grave before John came. He'll throw himself in if he leaves.
"What praise." John huffed, rolling his eyes. "If you don't mind, try to say something nice on my epitaph to memorialize my mediocre mind."
"The third time?" John asked, looking down as water streamed down the sharp angles of Sherlock's face, so pale against his considerably tanner skin. It drizzled into his eyes but he made no move to wipe it away.
The journey up the coast took the better part of the day, and the two, hemmed into the darkness and the rocking, said little, more comfortable in silence than small talk. Sherlock sat opposite, an intense look of concentration settling over his face as he stared at his mate. John ignored him, slowly flipping through his book until he couldn’t stand the feeling any longer; an irritating feeling, like a new bruise being poked at.
He ducked behind a wall as the lights flashed off and waited for two more officers to stride past him on their way to the wing where he had been strapped to that hellish bed. There was no use wasting the darts he had on them. They weren't a threat if they didn't notice him.
"Dammit, Sherlock!" John sighed, running a hand through his hair. Mary and Mikheia appeared out of the crowd, "Just…just stay out of trouble, yeah?"
"You told me that Mycroft removed Mary from the Kremlin. Then you said that you told her to. Which was it?"
"Please tell me there's a bomb or a packet of anthrax in it or something so I know I was justified in risking my life for it."
"What game are they trying to get me to play, Mary?" He asked, tossing his bag in a chair by the door and tearing off his cap.
John was opening the door to his Kaaba, his Holy Sepulchre, his Wailing Wall, and he was not there to stop him. He wasn't there to lay a hand on his doorknob and proclaim to John, as he once did (he only warned once), that his bedroom was
But the agency had taught him to take those details and read into them. Something Sherlock hadn't had the time for before his departure (it was just a departure, John told himself when he ate alone, worked alone, woke alone).
Sherlock glares at him until he concedes. “His sister’s, naturally. Normal people do tend to visit relatives in times of emotional strife.”
“Blasphemy, John?” Sherlock says dryly before John all but yanks his limp arm from Sherlock’s hands.
"How long will she be buried?" His mate asked. A boat sailed through the lagoon, and they could hear the clink of crystal glasses, the pour of the wine, the vital heartbeats of all the living on board.
Sorry for the delay and shortness! I'll be out this week, but the next chapter's already been drafted so have no fear!
“Then I am sure he will understand. You gave him this courtesy, and he will repay it, once you find each other again.”
“Right,” He says, breaking the tense invisible chord wound between the two as he sits beside John. “We’re about twenty minutes out. Where are we going once we get back?”
John deafens to the outside world as he slowly sinks into the book, a remedial one by Sherlock's standards, and he only jolts back to the surface as the train brakes screech and Sherlock tosses his bag in his lap.
“You’re not going to like what happens next, but you will listen to what I say and follow it exactly, alright? Alright?” John repeats, the soldier bleeding into his voice because Sherlock hesitates far too long to indicate agreement or compliance.
Sherlock and Mortimer look to each other, each willing the other to explain to the angel what exactly a Christmas tree was.
“Correct, Captain John Watson. No echoes. The walls are made from tiles that absorb the vibrations that sound makes. It’s been called the quietest room in the world. Of everyone that enters, no one lasts more than 45 minutes. Do you know why this is?”
? The neutrality of your response negates your argument." Sherlock scooted closer out of the excitement of explanation. He liked the look in John's eyes as he
"I got shot at, jumped in the Thames, swam 30 metres in water that may has well have been ice, and got sick for a…tiger."
to, John, have some patience please." Sherlock huffed. "And, as I understand it, foreplay pays off quite well in the end—"
"I never wanted to leave you, John." Sherlock begins, and tries to clear his throat of the invisible obstruction that's choking him. "If you should be sure of anything in this life, it's that I could never voluntarily leave you. I couldn't. I can't."
Sherlock took a step back, his omniscient eyes taking in everything; John's hunched posture as if he wanted to collapse in on himself, the emptiness of his voice, the darkness in his eyes, the sudden twitch in his leg, everything. He knew in that moment that he had done irreparable harm to the person he loved most and who loved him and he knew in that moment that the one seemingly insignificant breath he had blown all the way back in Bruges had hit them both like a gale-force wind and sent their house of cards crashing down.
His mind races, trying to focus on anything and everything but the numbing sensation that's spreading through him like his circulation has stopped, but his heart is back in that alley, with John, where it belongs, and it feels a thousand miles away. He can almost see John now, rain dripping down that face concentrated in utter stoicism as he continues to draw blood from that beast that he seemed to know so well.
"It's called fascia. Dense, flexible tissue comprised mostly of collagen. Kind of like latex, I guess. Keeps everything in place for the most part; its track record of preventing disembowelment is, unfortunately, complete shite. Why'd you want to know?"
“There’s nothing wrong with your eyes. Never was.” What am I saying, why, please let this end, this needs to be over
"I was assigned a businessman and then an investor that night," John began softly, "and it went well enough, even though the investor never showed up. The first one was clean. He didn't fight me like some others did. The agency had told me to get his phone if I could. His passcode was easy to get, but the agency wanted his travel plans. He was going to Novgorod." John looked up at Sherlock, confusion on his face. "Why was he going to Novgorod?"
His hand flailed up, as feeble as a fish fresh out of the river. With a kitten-weak grip, he latched onto John's lapel, dragging him down. As he spoke, John could smell the whiskey on his breath, the tobacco juice, the brown, decaying teeth that would fall out soon, fall out when he would not feel them any longer, plinking down to join the rest of his bones.
“Nevertheless — I would have come here first, if only to eat or change clothes. I imagine you would have left it on the desk?”
"I also want to meet Stanley." He mutters as he lays his lips against Sherlock's forehead. "And your parents, I suppose, since that's the proper thing to do. But mostly Stanley."
I can only assume that you’re entertaining the idea simply because it makes you feel powerful, when in reality you’re addicted to poppy blood and wasting away in a sad tenement house because you don’t want to face your own mistakes. Irene told me you needed the truth and I can’t believe I had to cross the continent and fight with you half the night to give it to you, but there it is. After all our words and our arguments and this insane fantasy you have about world domination, we’re right back to where we started when I got here. It’s—”
He had always been a hunter. There was a reason John had never turned anyone – he preferred to kill them quickly rather than make them suffer through a slow death or their transformation. But he had once loved it, fascinated with the blood, the slow leech of light, the difference between an open eye and an unseeing one. He did not torture overtly, but he would admit that in his time he’d most likely brought suffering to more than a few. He didn’t like it about himself, he knew John didn’t like it about him either, but in his earlier days he hadn’t been able to help the morbid curiosity, and the knowledge that no one could stop him unless he wanted them to. It was a power trip, he could fancy himself judge, jury, and executioner, and he had enjoyed it. He could blame the monster inside him, but if were honest he the man had just as much a part in his experiments as the darkness did.
"It is currently 4:10 in the afternoon at the scene of the crime. The location is a disused train car about ten miles from town. There are numerous blood splatters indicating that the victim was struck multiple times with a heavy object; the clawed end of a hammer, then. In front of me there is a golden necklace with a ring hanging on the chain; there is a green stone inscribed with what looks to be a diamond shape between two triangles converging in an M shape.
Mycroft pulls a netbook from his bag and hands it to Sherlock, but before he can take it his brother draws it back with a pointed look.
Mycroft stares down at his little brother, high as a kite and nearing the emotional meltdown they both knew was coming. It was only a matter of time.
The grin on Moran’s face falls as Mikheia swings the wrench, smashing the oil lamps on either side of him, the scattered flames falling to the hay below, soaked not with dew, but with oil and saltpetre, stored in drums at the far end of Georgiy’s home, forgotten for decades until John and Mikheia had rolled them out to the barn earlier that morning under the guise of feeding the animals, who they’d released out into the pastures after dinner. They’d agreed to allow Moran to believe they weren’t expecting him.
John collapsed in the back seat of whatever care the agency had conscripted to get him out. He didn't care if it looked good as long as it had an engine and wheels and could get him as far away from that place as possible.
"S'gave me something." He slurs. "Capsule. Think w's hydrocortisone, high cortisol level m'ybe...'m not sure."
question, alright? If a third body turns up and you're in the mood to mouth off or disrespect my team, I'll be in a mood to haul you to the Yard, keep you there, and send pictures of John and I having the bloody time of our lives at a crime scene you're not at, is that understood?"
"Would you like some tea?" John asks, uncrossing his legs. "Sherlock had the last of the Earl Grey, but I think we have some vanilla chai left; wonderful stuff, tea—"
John looks at him for a moment, a hand on the door. His eyes are heavy with some unseen burden, lined with sleep and sickness.
“The vents!” Sherlock bursts out irately. “Moran must have some form of sodium metal available to him at the Yard and he mentioned mould and water damage—he’s going to blow up the Yard and all he has to do is turn on the sink in his cell—”
He sorted through the pile of papers on his table, passports, money, travel documents, credit cards; a colorful array of past lives and present possibilities.
The man on his left scratched his chin when he was about to bluff. Black residue under the nails — not oil. Ink. Editor of the Baker Street Herald. Several hundred dollars in debt. Wife about to leave, judging from the bags beneath his eyes and the compulsion to twist at his ring every time the bet was raised. Not one late night at the press, but many, stubble left to grow long past five o'clock.
." Jim breathes with fascination. "How adorable! Are you always like this? Do you come in another model?"
“You think you might have waited for me to give instructions first?” John growls, holding his arm to his chest with his elbow bent out like an L. “I am a doctor for god’s sake! For all you know you could have made it worse—”
Sherlock sighs, pocketing his phone in the inner pocket of his coat, near his heart. He shrugs his coat on and hears footsteps thunder down the hall. He rolls his neck, checking for the small bag tucked next to his phone.
Thinner fingers wrapping around it, he lifts the bowl out and away, sweeping back to his room without a word, shutting the door just as softly as before.
John sighed, leaning back in his chair. Sherlock had been adamant about going alone. Whether it was for John's safety or his own, John didn't know, but he had assured Sherlock twice and twice again that he was carrying his gun and would use it if he needed to. He'd certainly been gone long enough, but John was certain that if there was trouble, Sherlock would text him.
"You can be as thin and tall as you'd like, Sherlock, there's still no way we'd both fit in one chair."
He’d never liked that string though, tied around the axis pole. He never quite forgave what it was: an enabler. He’d always loathed them since he sat down Christmas morning and realised through trial-and-error that no matter what he did, he’d never get the wheel spinning without winding the string around it. A tedious business, certainly, but it ruined the wholeness of the thing, it tainted the idea that perhaps he had found something that could move itself without anyone’s help, something that could spin off all on its own, forever, self-perpetuating and independent. Wouldn’t that just solve everything, if the string was out of the equation forever?
“He’s not alive again, is he?” Sherlock asked dryly. “The number of times that man has been resurrected at this point would displease a Buddhist.”
“You have myself, Sherlock, that is true, but you also have Gregory and Miss Hooper and Mrs Hudson. Do not allow your grief to limit your perception. John was not, and will not be, the only one that cared for you. In his own way, perhaps he was singular, but in other ways, he was excluded. No one will love you as a brother as I do. You’d do well to remember that.”
"Word is he's still in Anagni. We could pop in for a bit on the way back. If you could see the things he gets up to, at his age..."
"Are you sure about that?" John bit. He didn't know where these words, this anger, was coming from, didn't know from what wound it bled out of and he couldn't staunch it.
"Moriarty didn't kill you tonight because he was sending a message to me." Sherlock turned, looking John square in the eye. "He was telling me that he can kill you whenever and wherever he wants, and there's not a thing I can do to stop him. The only thing in his way is whether he feels like it or not."
They collided before they hit the ground, the impact of John’s body forcing them both downwards. He followed the natural motion and struck, forcing Moriarty’s arms behind him and landing a rain of strong punches to the other man’s back, kidneys, grabbing his hair and slamming his face headfirst into the pavement.
“It’s fine, Molly.” Lestrade says, a bit chipper as he pats her on the knee. “We’ve put him in a cell for a few hours with that friend of his, maybe that’ll cool them down. Do you want to press charges, John?”
Sherlock's wet hair curling against the pillow, his skin still damp from the shower, water dripping in rivulets over his chest as little wisps of steam curled off his pale shoulders into the cool air. John's hair was matted to his head like papier-mache but it couldn't conceal the pale red scars about his left ear.
She turns and looks at Sherlock, into his hard gaze as he stares back at her, a man with madness in his face.
The song ends and skitters over the bumps of the record player’s needle into the recognisable ‘Intermezzo: Addagio’, another brooding hour favourite. Sherlock turns away, thinking of a different kind of needle point and split open books and the misted windows of weekend mornings spent in his bed in his dorm room. He’d often shot up at the climax of classical songs. It had made him feel powerful.
“Harry—it’s…good to see you.” John replied, taking a moment to look at her; her blonde hair styled into a bob, eyes lined in thick winged eyeliner, a fashionable shaggy shrug jacket thrown over her thin frame. She looked exactly the same as ever.
“The watch won’t even be aware of what’s hit them until well into tomorrow morning.” He huffed, then, as if to make a point, set all his gathered tomes and sheaves of parchment on the table so hard John imagined it would buckle under the sudden weight. “We’ll have this conversation now.”
John sighed, bookmarking his page. He reached into his jacket and pulled out the telegram, wrinkled and worn out from travel.
He reaches into his coat pocket and draws out a small glassine bag and holds it in front of his brother's face.
Quinn strides to the double doors and goes out to lean over the balustrade to see the doorway. As soon as he was over the threshold, Sherlock springs up and shuts the doors, grabbing a broom and sliding it through the handle so Quinn was locked out.
“Beautiful, isn’t it?” He says as he stares out into the powdered, untouched distance. “Like a painter’s canvas waiting for the brush—”
“‘Safe’?” Sherlock spits out, grasping at his hair as he paces at the foot of the bed. “‘Safe’? I never wanted to be
Sherlock took a moment, going through his mind to fit these places with their history. Military service had always affected John, no matter what war he was in. It took a great strength to not only enter a battlefield, not only to be surrounded by blood and bullets, the calls of the dying, but to act as a medic, to save the lives of soldiers as they bled out, all the while resisting his own nature to drain them dry himself.
"Yes, tighten the leash, Lestrade. That always makes the dog stop whining." Morn taunts. "Hit him on the nose with a newspaper while you're at it. Lock him out before he puddles on the floor."
John had been wrong. So wrong. That passion in her eyes when she talked of Mumbai, that was the darkest kind there was: fanaticism. Utter belief in one's convictions.
Sherlock burst into the factory warehouse just as the shot rang out. How many more would he have to hear thinking that John was at the other end? What if—
As he passed beneath a bridge, he spotted a figure on the banks, cloaked in dark layers against the morning cold. It raised a hand, hailing him over. He steered to the side, and held the gondola still as the figure stepped in.
John stepped away, going to the window to look down into the street. People hurried home in the night, walking quietly past one another, around couples, groups of arguing shopkeepers, drivers gambling on the seats of their rickshaws, drunken Englishmen hobbling down the road. He would never know what it was to feel entitled to reign over them, or even contemplate it, but he knew that his husband did, and he knew that he was capable of fulfilling it as well, with as cold as his intelligence could be. Sherlock was not heartless, but he could be apathetic, and in that apathy become calculatingly destructive; he was good at finding weak spots, whether he exploited them or not. John bit his lip against the words he wanted to say, but in a moment remembered all of what Irene had told him, what Mycroft had reported, and he felt a low burn bubbling up inside of him.
Sherlock stares at her for a moment, gaze darting to John before a look of abject terror passes over his face, soon replaced by dark fury.
Sherlock’s head swam, his thoughts trickling away, disconnected and slow. He’d heard John, heard all the things he said, he just couldn’t make
"Thank your boy over there." Lestrade says, gesturing to Sherlock. "Texted me your 'coordinates'. Said if I wanted to ask you anything you were free."
Mikheia presumably does just that and Georgiy laughs before replying. Mikheia pauses a moment, sparing a long glance at the man before turning to John.
"I'm sure she does, too. I'm sure it's quite good and explains exactly why she left me with those fuckers, why she
?” Sherlock interrupts disdainfully. “As if I’d pick something so numbingly massive, there’s no grace to it, I may as well be hacking away at an elephant carcass with a string of floss—”
Tears began to drip down John's face. Why now…why ever? But he didn't stop them. He didn't want to. He had never given Sherlock the opportunity of seeing him like this, he had been careful to hide it, so why stop now? What stood in his way?
“Are you alright?” John calls hoarsely but he doesn’t answer. John hauls him to his feet, covering his smaller body with his own as he rushes them out of the barn. Bullets ping above them, dangerously close, but the smoke is too thick for even the best marksman, and the two barrel into the wet, cold night.
“And you were willing to risk your personal safety and health to make sure I came?” John shot back, frowning. “I told you why I wasn’t going to stay.”
Sherlock had thought their shag this morning had been the hottest shag in the history of hot shags, but he also had nothing to compare it to. Something that would remedied shortly.
His assistant soon appeared in the mouth of the attic hatch, bearing a bottle for each of them. He took it with a nod of thanks, smoothing his hair back into place before uncapping it.
Sherlock chuckled and John smiled as he tossed the jacket to the floor before returning to his previously occupied spot. He let his hands roam over Sherlock's face and felt like a blind man reading braille from the way he could feel Sherlock's pain and sadness and quiet loneliness and tense pleas that had been hardening layer over layer for the past three years.
and he steps into the cold, wet night to help his only friend, the only person that really mattered.
John laughs at that, at the absurdity of their lives now, laughs at the sheer craziness of the man before him. Sherlock smiles, not letting his hand leave John's face, even as it fades.
“John, John, are you alright?” Sherlock asks, scrambling up to his side as John writhes on the floor. “Talk to me. Tell me you’re alright.”
He turned back to the water. He doubted it would strike here, among such an obvious crowd, but stranger and more improbably things had occurred. A party would be to their advantage, certainly. Lowered inhibitions, carelessness, reckless decisions, anonymity. Yet all the other victims had been those who would serving this crowd rather than among them. Men: dock workers, a carpenter, a stable boy, all below the threshold of true sexual maturity. The most recent had been an attendant at the fish market, no older than 30. Perhaps there was a type, perhaps it was just opportunity, or perhaps they were simply the ones who would not be missed. He had not decided yet.
Sherlock hears voices as he awakens. His eyes open slowly to a dark room. Distantly, he wonders why it’s his but he doesn’t know why. John must have tucked him in. Why does his head hurt? It aches with a dull pulse, like the whole of his skull is a tender bruise being prodded. He tosses the covers back and swings his feet over the side of the bed before standing on unsteady legs as he heads towards the voices. Neither of them sounds like John. Odd. He must be watching and not have anything to say. He does that.
With a cascade of water, the shapeshifter stands, her pale skin shining under the overhead light. Every inch of her is smooth and porcelain, gleaming like shined marble, curving softly in all the right places. Sherlock can appreciate aesthetics if anything, and she's pleasing to every eye.
” His voice cracks from stress. “You couldn’t send a text or an email or call me or have your bloody fucking brother tell me? Or Molly? Yes, I know about her, Mycroft told me, which is more than I can fucking say for you, you utter posh fucking
Walking slowly back to the den, he loaded the bullet into the chamber, coming around the sofa and Sherlock, who hadn’t moved a muscle. John looked down at the gun, then held it out, pointed towards his own heart, so close he couldn’t possibly miss.
I am. And sometimes you are such an absolute arse that I think I could leave you and not look back, but I stay. Why?"
John watches as Mikheia converses with the old man at the mouth of the barn, smiling and joking as he takes an old oil lamp and a covered tray from him. Goats bleat in the distance, the land quiet as it gets ready for bed.
—?” He glanced up towards his mate, but found nothing except the breeze passing through the empty threshold. He reached out to feel at their bond, but it was still closed. John had been here when he woke; that was a start.
Something had been cut in the brawl. He whipped his head to face the source, teeth already lengthening within his mouth. Cadorin was holding a cloth to his head, where a light wound now bled freely into the fabric, soaking it through. He swallowed against the sudden sight, when a hand grabbed him roughly around the arm, leading him away—
He hadn’t been to Dutch country since he had left four hundred years ago. He had no present mind for the streets or the culture or its people; he’d only wanted to find John. Eventually, he tracked him down to a tiny apartment in Molensteeg, climbing in through an upstairs window when no one answered the door.
"Can you stop with the exposition and just kill me?" John asked, not knowing where the words were coming from. Did he have a death wish? Some pseudo-attack to provoke Moran into a fight? It felt like a combustible cocktail of both.
"Right. I'm going out." He says, turning and heading back to their room, where the majority of his clothes are, have been since before he left and returned.
The rudder fell from his hands as he was suddenly grasped from behind, and he felt something sharp sting his neck. Rearing back, he grappled with the man as he struggled, feeling wetness run down to soak his shirtfront. The man tightened his hold, and he could feel—God, was that his
"I remember reading about that hospital, Bart's." The man said with a smile. "I thought it sounded odd. Didn't seem like you were the type for suicide." The contact's eyes glinted. "So, what happened?"
Then he imagined John dead. Even if he did fake it, even if he had the cruelness to manage it like Sherlock had with all the best intentions, that image sat in Sherlock's head like stagnant standing water. Blood on John's face. Blankness in his eyes. Stillness of his chest. Sherlock could feel cold fear prickle underneath his skin. He couldn't even bear the thought of it, even if John sprang up and shagged him senseless, the image of him dead would distract Sherlock the whole time. All the colour, any he might have had, had drained from his face and left him looking an ashy, whitewashed grey.
Sherlock's begun to work through the video files to find any trace of Moriarty. John doubts that he will, especially after today, but keeps his opinion to himself. He'd rather not have a row before bed.
He shuts his eyes. It is a pronounced and terrible moment when one realises how vastly their mistake stretches, as if they could reach into that cold spot inside themselves and rewind time so this horrible moment ceases to happen.
Sherlock closes his eyes. He's not going to thank anyone specifically, but he feels such an intense relief that he feels like he should send out one big engraved thank you card out into the universe.
He frowned, that cold feeling curling inside him again. “Space? You’ve had ten years of it. Surely that would be enough.”
“I’ll say – here I am thinking I’m a world traveler when you’ve got me beat by miles! I mean, I thought you were in Morocco last I heard; I didn’t think I’d have to project myself all the way over to bloody Pakistan! Really, John, you couldn’t have picked some place better? Without so many flies?”
When he was 29 and had finally emerged out of a drugged seven year stupor that he liked to call Lost, he dreamed of heat and sweat and red-but-not-blood. Just red. He met Greg Lestrade four days later, walking in on him during a criminal investigation at a Tesco and saving him the time of figuring out the culprit before he directed him to the skip out back where a video surveillance tape was stashed, indicating a regular customer that liked to stop by at 2am and hold up the place.
Christ, his head hurts. He tries to self-diagnose as well as he can in his condition. His bet was on a nasty knock—his captors most likely cared that he was alive, not that he was unhurt, at least until they were done with him—or a slight concussion. Judging on how he’d been slipping in and out of consciousness, he thought the latter was more likely.
He stumbles out of the room, flailing feet dragging against the rough stone as his captor hauls him down a hall. He can hear laughter somewhere. He can hear screaming somewhere else.
He feels soft hands lift his head, drawing the burlap over his head. Once more, he is shrouded in darkness, a blessed darkness.
That weasel-nosed insidious bastard. He'd already wormed his way into the investigation, bribed or threatened some dull employee to show him the evidence locker and he'd stuck his elephantine paunch where it didn't belong, just to calm his histrionic notion that Sherlock would start using again because of a speck of cocaine.
"You know, you're the second person to tell me that today and the first couldn't keep their promise."
For one wrenching, heart-stopping moment, he believes that he’s been blinded. He believes that he will never see again, never see his hands or Sherlock’s expressions or what clothes he will wear for the day as he picks them out. For one moment, he is afraid that such a life changing event has happened so suddenly and irrevocably without him noticing, without him witnessing the significance of the act itself.
John kisses him against the night and the backlit castle, kisses him for endings and beginnings, for snow falling softly over Bern, for tennis balls smacking against the walls in Prague, for a shirt’s patterns only printed in Stockholm, for close calls and long nights, and for just friends to everythings.
But he didn’t care now. All the longing, the pent-up emotions, the silent, solitary nights he spent travelling with emptiness beside and in him, he felt it now. He’d missed the great idiot.
A wolf, a huge fucking wolf that just fucking killed him, just swiped his fucking head off, turns and looks at her.
But…in all their escapades, had he ever waited for John if he had fallen behind? Truth be told, he hadn't even noticed when John wasn't there until he arrived at his destination. His mind had honed in on one goal—
Sherlock's hands pushed past John's shirt and grazed over the bandages on his back, thickly applied and properly secured by the doctors in Berlin, much stronger than their makeshift clinic in Mycroft's guest bedroom.
Sherlock’s eyes dart over his, searching, collecting data, analysing. Mycroft is using John’s tactic. He’s learned.
. It's begun to rain, a light sprinkle that will soon turn into a downpour, but that won't help them much.
Harry rolls her eyes and for a moment he feels a keen pang at the familiarity; she looks so much like him. “An obice is a sort of barrier, like a shield almost. It’s a physical object that prevents the entry or re-entry to the world of whomever the caster names.”
," She says, scrambling to catch the toppling object. Tentatively, she sets it back upright and grins up at them. "Well that was fucking close, right?"
"Someone must have hated you, then." Sherlock mutters dryly and John smiles. "Still doesn't explain what you are though. Have you considered that you're a fallen angel? The punishment seems fitting enough; being my handler. Only a vengeful god would have that kind of humour."
"He's like nothing else on this earth." Irene said, staring at him from across the room, and for a moment it was as if she were his mother, crowing over the uniqueness of her child, proud over something she had a part in making.
Azazel stares at him for a moment, his eyes blazing amid the mused blackness coating his face, and spits at him.
Sherlock swallowed. John couldn’t see his eyes through his sunglasses but he knew he had closed them.  “John, it’s not –”
"Be that as it may," Sherlock said with a slight grin. "It is not my well-being that I care most for. And you're willingly choosing to stay in Bruges, I can't even imagine your suffering, it's like purgatory-"
“Yes,” Mortimer answers, “I believe he still exists somewhere else. You say that you suspect his demise was foul play?”
"It's not hard, you know. All of our kind has that perception, not just John. Plus it's written all over your face, genius. For someone so awfully proud of seeming infallible, you're awfully shite at hiding when you're feeling weak."
"Shh, John, grown-ups are talking." Moran hushed before his gaze snagged on Sherlock's clenched hands. "Going to fight me over your bonnie lass' honour, then, Holmes?" Moran smiled through a bloodied lip.
John’s brow furrowed. “Are you saying this was revenge? Getting back at me for something you sat on for
He was dreaming of gold hair that melted in his fingers. These days, it’s usually something to do with him; something that was his, or belonged to him. The other night he dreamt of bloodied cable knit jumpers, and the night before that he dreamt of a soft strong voice and the cold touch of fingers that all led to a stethoscope in place of a body, but he knew who it belonged to. There was only one answer to it, only ever one answer.
There was silence, still, cool, soft silence like the air that billows out from sheets when they're falling over a bed.
John Watson. Such an odd little man. Moran had known him briefly when their tours intersected, but didn't remember if he had thought anything of him, which told him all he needed to know about his feelings towards him. Insignificant. Not heavy enough to leave an imprint. This made him unable to understand Jim's obsession with John's demise at first. Why would Jim lower himself to pay attention to the end of such a minor man? And furthermore, what did that mean for Moran himself, that Jim would no longer even give him the time of day unless it benefited him, dedicating himself instead to rather lower investments?
John’s fork clatters to his plate and he sends an irate glance into the universe, as if it was the one who annoyed him and not me.
He hears the banging of crockery as John rummages through the cabinets and he shuffles to his feet. Whatever awaits him in there, it can’t be anything good, but it’s
John feels his wings flare, breaking through his control to cast shadows over the two men he's protecting.
Artemisia, as I'm sure our art lovers would know, is Artemisia Gentileschi, the famous Italian Baroque painter. You may know her portrayals of
“I dunno,” John shrugs, toying with a cruller. “I found it earlier tonight, in the dirt outside my window. I thought I saw a face outside, so I went to check it out and there it was.”
He’d never liked that string though, tied around the axis pole. He never quite forgave what it was: an enabler. He’d always loathed them since he sat down Christmas morning and realised through trial-and-error that no matter what he did, he’d never get the wheel spinning without winding the string around it. A tedious business, certainly, but it ruined the wholeness of the thing, it tainted the idea that perhaps he had found something that could move itself without anyone’s help, something that could spin off all on its own, forever, self-perpetuating and independent. Wouldn’t that just solve everything, if the string was out of the equation forever?
. Not now.” John snapped before he took a deep breath through his nose. “You were going to leave, and kept me in the dark. What do you think I would’ve done?”
Slowly, their laughter died down and they sat in silence as the wind blew the sand past the moon, low in the sky.
“Sherlock? Sherlock!” Lestrade follows him through the gathered officers and out the door into the busy street. “Wait!”
With a low growl, he launches himself at John, crouching over him with a knee on either side. He claws at John's eyes—damn them—and John cries out, trying to throw him off with the arm that's not plastic and straight like the Action Man, with the arm the arm that's pink and he lands an elbow in Sherlock's stomach, knocking the wind from him.
“Everything is not fine. You have been together for over three hundred years; if everything were fine, I suspect you would not have come here unless I invited you. While I am appreciating your unannounced visit, do not think me foolish enough to presume it is only for the pleasure of seeing my face. Now, we are speaking the truth, yes? So, begin.”
“British, French, American, European…you all look the same to us. Unless you are a seven-foot tall Nigerian with a flashing sign attached to you, you may as well be invisible here.”
"Is that all you came here to do, Mycroft?" Sherlock snaps, turning to glare at him. "Rub your ferrety snout in places where it doesn't belong? I haven't used any sort of anything in almost a year, no thanks to you."
And a student of alchemy. That was interesting. Although anyone with an internet connection or nearby library could look it up and call themselves an expert. Something about the idea of change appealed greatly to this person. They were dissatisfied with some aspect of their life, most likely their invisibility to the audience they wanted. There certainly wasn't an age cap on learning, but judging by their background they'd most likely be in the middle of adulthood. If they were younger, they would still have the optimism so common of youth, and if they were older, they would be too jaded to act. No, they were Sherlock's age, or thereabout. He knew the feeling all too well. The internal screaming telling you to be noticed, the rage at being unappreciated when you knew you should be. The disappointment that turns bitter and poisonous and so very, very potent if you directed it at something that could be destroyed. This killer, they didn't have a John Watson or a Greg Lestrade; someone who offered the necessary tools to keep their mind occupied. A basic presence to cancel out the acidic rage.
Sherlock sees the droplets of water on the soft feathers and they look like ink in the night. Like atramentum. Like blood. He traces the curve of John’s shoulder and raises his hand to the light. There, in the soft night shine, his palm is dark, slick with blood that isn’t his. There’s a hole in his shoulder. Why is there a hole in his shoulder? Why hasn’t it healed? Why is there blood—
“Keeping our secrets, are we? What’d you do, John? What deal did you make to get that piece of meat you wanted so badly? You haven’t even bedded him yet. Makes me wonder what was so important about him that you had to forsake all of us, tripping over our bodies in the dark so you could get your cock wet.”
He snatches the lighter from me before I can spark a light. He doesn’t say anything. He hasn’t said anything, but I knew that would get some kind of reaction out of him. I need him to
"I'd like to see you try." He responds. "Let's see how well you do after your angel abandons you, after you've served your purpose and he leaves you to be fodder for the wolves. I'd never do that to you, Sherlock, never. John, however…let's just say he might not be what you think he is."
During the day, he never thought he'd smile as much as he did, or even tolerate someone else so much.
Sherlock shuts his eyes, adjusting to the new darkness and information that yes, John is here too. He hadn’t wanted that. He’d wanted it just to be him, wanted John to be miles away in their rented room, looking for him, worried but safe at least. The gyroscope doesn’t need to be restrung just yet, if it’s still turning and he just can’t see it.
He felt a vibrant, lush sensation in the back of his head and irately shook it away as if dusting a cobweb; he had almost forgotten the feeling, like brushing against velvet warmed in the sun.
His mace, wrapped tightly in his fist, is getting colder, icy to the touch as it sticks to his warm palm. He scans the black sky as he coasts through it, an antigen in a blood stream, yet he knows it will do him little good. Azazel doesn’t fly the way he does. He appears, usually when unexpected, as it benefits him.  When he attacks, he’ll make sure to catch John off-guard.
have good reason to pop Seb one, but that doesn’t mean you have to. And your aunt’s not too happy that she had to bring you in herself.”
"When you were a boy, you believed in angels." John murmurs softly, his whisper almost drowned by the sound of the kettle. Mycroft nearly thought he hadn't heard him correctly. "You would read outside under a tree as you watched over Sherlock as he did what he does best, investigate and discover, and when you'd feel the summer breeze—it always came along so coincidentally— you liked to think that it was the brush of angel's wings as they flew past. You wondered if they had chariot races." John says with a huff of laughter. "When you lost something valuable—or usually when Sherlock did—you would pray at night for an angel to find it for you and if it would turn up you promised to always believe in them. You always found those lost things, didn't you?"
The black lines seem to form a pattern, a picture, perhaps. She's supposed to represent something. The slashes look oddly familiar, overlapping each other in pert, layered triangles. An angel—but no, if this were religious in nature there would be other signs. No one leaves a body bare when they want to send a message.
Her chest has been sawed open, an empty red space in the cavity where her heart should be. Sherlock sympathises.
But what really convinced him to travel to America, what convinced him to tell John to pack his bags, was one word, one single word this man had uttered that had sent his mind reeling and his stomach dropping.
"Well, you two make a right pair, don't you?" John asked with no mirth in his voice, only an acidic sharpness. "The Holmes Brothers: helping the helpless, but only if it's convenient. The slogan just writes itself—"
." He gave a rather harsh tug to John's hair and his brain lurched unpleasantly in his skull and he felt like he was about to get sick.
John sleeping beside him, talking to him, kissing him, loving him, that was something he couldn't quite name but he could
"It's dark, but there is no night. No dawn either, just…heat." John says, his eyes unfocused as he recalls the memories. His wings twitch. "Sheol is a place where you forget the lightness of being, of your own existence, where happiness evaporates into the air like water. There's an inescapable fire, like you've been stuffed in an oven. The bones of your family rot around you, bleached from the sun. As soon as you forget how hot it is, you remember again and there's no shade anywhere, so you can only know yourself enough to recognise that you're suffering…" His voice is empty, hollow and blank from thinking of a life once lived and Sherlock doesn't want to hear it anymore. Hopes he'll never live it again.
The space her abdomen had occupied was now empty, the squared chunk of flesh cleanly cut away, laying now at her feet.
“Mary—Anthea—she tried to stop me.” Sherlock answers, opening his eyes to gaze at John, who looks just as real as he ever did. “She slowed me down. John, you have to know, you have to believe me, if I’d known what was going to happen—”
"The prisoner." Mikheia replied nonchalantly. He was remarkably calm for having faced down a potentially crazed, armed, and drugged man hunted by the government. An animal backed into a corner. Sherlock noted the tremble in Mikheia's fingers that he most likely didn't even notice himself.
The third time, he even may have enjoyed it. It was the same feeling as putting your bare feet on the cold floor, but now he has slippers on. When the thought first came to him, John thought it was stupid, but now he feels that it was appropriate in the simplest terms. He doesn't feel shocked by it anymore. He doesn't feel
“A statement rich in hypocrisy. Is this equality why I’m only learning of your plan to leave me now, and not when it first crossed your mind? It’s only
The lights are blinding. There must be water in my lungs by now. Am I out of the cellar? It was flooding, I couldn’t get out—
John scrambles away, tripping over the tangled sheets they had laid in together just an hour ago and lands badly on his injured shoulder. He stifles a cry of pain and struggles to his feet, clutching his dangling arm to his body as he runs from the room, into the darkness.
“Mr Holmes,” Mortimer begins with trepidation, “You are a smart man. You’ve got intelligence radiating from your pores. Why did you come to me? Surely all of this had occurred to you.”
John put the cap back on. Called the morgue to send someone up and get the body. Called a cleaning crew to mop up the blood. Washed his hands. Watched the blood sluice off his palms and dye the water a pale red before disappearing down the drain.
“What have you got?” Sherlock asks, pretending for the both of them to not notice the absent space beside him.
, a slightly pathetic pun on Vasily Dokuchaev, a Russian geologist who founded the idea of soil science—so she must have been the life of the party—please tell me something that I might find
. So alive and wet. The sounds of their heartbeats are purer than the trumpets. And the noises they make when you fuck them? Beautiful.” His smile fades as he takes in John’s solemn countenance. “Don’t tell me the two of you haven’t—oh John, you prude, you’ve got all the right parts, you don’t know what you’re missing—”
They caught a show. A local band, nothing too ostentatious. Billy met them at the bar, beer in hand, and they sat at a table in the corner, far enough away for privacy, all three wearing sunglasses to hide their eyes.
He takes his arm away from her, but made sure to let his hesitation linger long enough to cultivate her attention.
Heaving himself up on unsteady elbows, he slowly began to crawl back towards the house before two hands wrapped around his ankles, dragging him back as he had hoped they would. It was a mistake to grip an opponent in a spot where they still had availability of motion.
There will be a moment in certain nights to distinguish them from the rest. He’ll be reading, and the words will begin to blur together. He keeps on reading, but not registering the words. The pages start to get heavy. His eyes shut for a moment, then open. He’ll look over at John, who sits unresponsive. Something will hurt in the heart of him, throbbing like a touched bruise somewhere deep. His lip will tremble, but he never knows why. Despondency laps at the edges of thought. He is overwhelmed by the idea that John might always be this way, and there’s nothing he can do to change it. He wonders if what he did was for the best, bringing John back. Wonders if he’s damned him to a crueller fate than whatever it was he came from. He asks himself if what he did even saved him from anything.
John can't suppress his smile, rolling over as he turns to face the man beside him. Sherlock's hands move to cover his shoulder, tracing the round scar on his shoulder. He leans forward and presses a kiss to it, his lips soft against the rough and uneven tissue. John noses into his hair, slowly inhaling the sweet, earthy scent as he kisses Sherlock's temple.
Mikheia straightens up, looking around the frozen yard. He moves to pull on his discarded boot and head into the walnut groves, when he hears Georgiy call his name.
“That would explain why he came here so late, then.” John says gravely. “He was trying to find us in London first.”
you can cause sometimes. And that's the worst part. Whenever your plans are involved, I'm already being set up to fall."
John's war journal sits on the mantle, propped up against the skull. Sherlock had read its last entry, dated just after John returned to London with his injury, his invalidation letter wedged in the back pages, and then he went out and bought enough heroin to keep him high as a kite for the rest of the weekend because it meant he'd think about how odd it was that air was now visible instead of what John's burned body looked like. He hadn't planned on Mycroft's little visit, but he supposes he should have. That was big brother for you. Always watching.
Artemisia raised her brow, but said nothing; she had a small smile on her face. “I have a dissenting opinion. If you will allow me to say it, as an old friend who wishes well for you, I believe you do not want to talk about this, not because of etiquette, but because you have no desire to address the problems within your relationship and your current sexual incompatibility with your mate.”
“I don’t want to talk about it anymore.” He decided then, because he had nothing more to say. “I am…grateful that you came here. I wanted you to. Not like this,” he added at John’s sudden frown of consternation, “but I want you here with me, always, John. Always. I am sorry I ever made you feel any differently.  I’ve suffered, and I’ve made us suffer, I hope not irreparably.”
"I'm still waiting for you to push me away." Sherlock said quietly. "To tell me what I did to you was terrible, was the worst thing anybody could do, that I'm damned in your eyes and you'll have no part of me."
"Well, Doctor Watson, what are you to do now? Kill me, hurt me if you must, but won't be getting revenge. Not really."
"Really, Lestrade," Sherlock scoffs. "Women are just as capable of becoming killers as men are. Widen your horizons, would you?"
.” He kneels and holds out his hand as the dog drops it into his palm. Under the dirt and slobber, he can feel grooves so he grabs a fistful of melting snow and rubs it over the abandoned fruit until the red shines through. Someone’s carved something into the face.
. Dark curtains muted the shaded lights inside, but sound spilled out into the cool air along with the sweet, burnt syrup smell of flower smoke and the sour, stale smell of spilt beer.
“Same thing, technically.” He says and then groans at the pain as Mikheia prods at his side, picking out pebbles and splinters of wood that have lodged in the deep cut that runs along his ribcage. “But let’s go with stitches. Might be a chance of debridement, don’t want to risk infection…”
He sighed, knowing this would come eventually. “Sherlock, don’t make me feel guilty about wanting to see more than our corner of the world.”
Their teacher swallows nervously, pulling on a shaky smile in an attempt at calming the class. "There will be an…announcement soon, from the principal."
This Not-John was a greater yet more terrible John. He was more beautiful in his fury, in his marble skin, but he was crueller, far crueller, far more brutally honest than His John.
The room was empty, nothing but the sparse furniture and the dawning morning to fill it. There was no trace of John, not of his clothes or bags or anything.
Sherlock found his throat tightening like someone was clenching it in their fist, like he couldn't breathe from the weight of it all.
"Just thought you should know." He shrugged then winced at the ensuing pain. "Certainly been keeping it to myself long enough."
“A radiant compliment coming from you. I thank you.” She turned to John and smiled. “It has been a long time, no? No one is coming to see me anymore in my old age.”
He ducks into a middle pew, not too far away to be suspicious, but appropriate for one cowed by arriving late to the service. Someone muffles a cough behind him, and the bench creaks amid the choir’s song.
John stays silent. The knives will come soon, or something painful, or some other hurt. He just has to wait them out. He knows it’s inevitable. War is never happy, or clean. War is pain. And he’s chosen his battles, hasn’t he? It was worth it—Sherlock was worth many things. He was worth it all, for that look John saw in his face that day in the street, when he thought he’d died. For that palpitating moment when he saw Sherlock on the news, right there in front of him—unmistakably, remarkably the same. For that day on the Thames, in the sand and the mud and dirty water, when Sherlock said
He’s being dragged, strung along. He can’t breathe; his chest feels wet, full of heavy lead that presses down and in. Blood gets in his eyes (and his mouth, he can taste it).
. And not only because their relationship was unconsummated; there were scores of lovers that had relationships that went without consummation for very long periods or none at all. It was just that the term connoted two people who had nothing else to do
The first time Sherlock had proposed, it had been said almost as an afterthought. The air was full of the smell of brackish water, burnt gunpowder, woodsmoke, the dull waters of the Thames lapping at the bridge as the two of them prepared to breach the Tower of London.
Calmness flows off Lestrade, cool and light like cream and laundry detergent but warm like baking sugar. The people around them feel similarly; tangs of sea breeze and leather and cedar. To John, there is nothing better. If only he'd known before that not all of this world was like London where everyone smelled of a pervading dampness like wet towels and he felt crushed under the heavy soot and charcoal scent. He laughs at the end of one of Lestrade's stories, and in the soft peace he feels a warm glow and looks to it. A woman meets his eyes, then looks away. Her core undulates, shifts and splits in two, and he knows she's carrying a child.
Lightning arcs across the sky, flashing down upon the world for a brief moment. Thunder sounds not three seconds later. The storm is passing.
The term sounded clunky to Sherlock, because he was sure that, of all the things he and John were, they were not
“No need,” Harry announced, pulling out a flask. “I brought my own.” She took a deep swig, ignoring the pointed looks from across the table.
“After I took you to the Yard you said you didn’t feel well. That’s nothing surprising considering Anderson was there, but you’re
, of course they’re related, they share the same eye colour, not to mention the attached earlobes and the slightly deviated septum—before setting down his spoon into a nearly-finished bowl of creamed polenta.
He glances around and stifles the disappointed frown. They all have a light to lead them, and he has himself. He has his clues and his deductions and they have their faith, which, essentially, are the same things.
!" Sherlock shouted, his voice echoing through the silence. He raised his gun, easy enough to obtain, and even easier to steal. He'd have to thank Mikheia later for his suspension of good conscience. "Why don't you come out and face me and stop hiding in the shadows?"
?" John sits up and takes the rag off his face then instantly regrets it as light pours into his eyes and to him it may as well be molten lava. When his vision clears he sees that Sherlock has placed a worn-out, raggedy tiger in front of him that smells of the dirt and dampness of the Thames. It looks innocuous enough, sitting on its rump with all four legs sprawled in front of it. So John takes the scientific approach.
“Would you rather we stay and risk another attack, another visit from dear old Jim, or would you rather we be on the move, where he’ll be looking for us instead of finding us?”
He's carried somewhere by thin arms that are stronger than they look. Sherlock's scent is all around him, the light and heady smell of his aftershave, the smell of cigarette smoke and soap.
"Ah, Lestrade, how fortuitous of you to join us. I was just about to share with John the contents of the substance on this Jane Doe's palm; lovely that I won't have to repeat myself. Is that Molly's report?"
“I haven’t felt better since Switzerland.” John admitted, and Sherlock felt his heart drop into his stomach.
The woman who answered the door comes in, collecting the sundried abandoned coffee mugs and plates into a stack on a tray, a dishtowel slung over her shoulder.
He looked around for his clothes, which were nowhere in sight. He sighed and moved to stand on the cold linoleum before his legs promptly gave out from under him. He groaned and reached up to grab the metal gurney, pulling himself back up. He wobbled on unstable legs.
There's a short silence. Sherlock is waiting for John to realise something but John's not sure what epiphany he's currently supposed to be in the grip of.
An unimpeded and clumsy smile of satisfaction churns over Sherlock’s face. John was usually quite impressive. That was no new information, but it was nice to be validated.
John sighs, closing his eyes. He's counted the repeating pattern of the wallpaper twice now. There's only so much longer he can stay in this flat.
He'd known the instant he'd seen John again that he would leave Mikheia behind. It had been a sudden realisation, a tiny little epiphany like headlights flashing across a dark road before moving on.
Sherlock takes a step forward, crowding into John's space, but John doesn't back down and they are left standing almost chest to chest.
Smoke drifts from the lit end as he exhales, staring across the street at the restaurant with the basement that becomes a gambling parlour Tuesdays and a fighting ring every other night of the week, except Sunday. Everything’s quiet there on Sunday. A small part of him, one of the raw reflexes from before his fall, wants to break in on Sundays and see what the hell happens there, since a place that’s quietly, illegally busy every other day of the week won’t bother to rest on the last; Tokyo is not a place that sleeps. Another part of him—a part that sounds suspiciously like John more and more every day—tells him that’ a bit not good, and that he has other things he needs to worry about.
It’s frightening, to think this might be the last night they have. The last time he sees the moon or breathes in the cool air; his last sunset might have already passed him by and he didn’t even know it. Frightening, but damn it all it if it's not
"Anyways, my undermining of your perfectly adequate mental capacity did nothing to quell how I felt about you, as well as your superiority. Your unworthiness of me morphed itself into my unworthiness of you, and I told myself that you would never truly feel the way you do for me. I felt like I could live like Atlas if it meant I could see you every day. After I left, I felt like everything had collapsed onto me, the whole universe, and I managed to pull myself out of the wreck even though it meant leaving you behind. I think I may have died on some level, but of course that's insignificant since I'm breathing and talking and all that…"
John wobbled on his legs, unsteady after the sudden impart of velocity through a stationary object. Billy had shot from below the waist, upwards. The bullet would have embedded itself near the bone of his scapula.
He can’t speak. His head is swimming. Focus…focus! Sherlock is talking to him, it’s Sherlock, and this might be his only chance to hear his voice for the rest of his life, if he can’t get out, can’t escape this—
A hand shot out to steady him, but its grip on his arm was tight, too harsh to be friendly. That grip knew where his still-raw injuries lay.
Felix stepped up to him, laying a slim hand on his shoulder as he stared down into his eyes. The prince was tall and whipcord thin, and his blue gaze reminded him of someone he couldn’t afford to think about at the moment.
"John and I will be gone in a few hours." Sherlock said, his voice cold and clipped like a knife buried in permafrost. "I anticipate that in the next few days a man will come here. He won't tell you who he is, but he will ask if you know me. You will tell him no, but I don't need to tell you that, do I? You wouldn't say yes, because even though you are angry at me you don't have the nature to seek revenge on me or on John since you think maybe one day you can join us like you're hoping and you don't want to ruin your chances."
causes of my greatest failures?” He snapped, then froze at John’s expression, open-mouthed and blank.
"Well, I just took him up here to meet you." James says, standing. "We'll let you get on with your bath."
anything. It wouldn't bring me back. It'd make you feel worse and you'd have two bodies to explain to Greg." John fell silent, his voice cooling. "Donovan once told me that there would be a day when there'd be a body and that Sherlock Holmes would have put it there. Technically that day has already passed, although you weren't really dead. But I don't want that day to come when it's someone who threatened or killed me. I can't have that blood on your hands."
Sherlock nodded. "If you feel like I am trespassing, you have the full ability to leave me and never look back."
Footsteps. The light blaring into his vision turns to a cherry red. He shuts his eyes against it, but it burns through his eyelids; just like looking towards the sun with your eyes closed.
He looked beside him, where Sherlock was lounging on the ground. Certainly an odd sight to see since Sherlock rarely ever
Mycroft, upon being alerted by his reconnaissance team, finds the flat empty. He’s almost impressed by how long Sherlock has lasted.
. It is wonderful to see you again.” Their host said, laughing as she grasped him by the shoulders, taking him in. “Time has done good work. You look much better than you used to. No beard this time, I see.” Her gaze swept over to Sherlock, and she stepped forward, offering her gloved hand. “And I believe we have this man to thank. Good evening, Sherlock Holmes.”
"One of your little spies?" Sherlock intones dully, supremely uninterested in anything Mycroft has to offer.
He turned his head to look up at John, craning his neck. “Time goes too quickly, yet not fast enough.”
"I told you, I had it handled—" He began, but was cut off as John went behind him and grabbed the end of the rope, dragging him back towards the tree.
John brings his mace to the demon’s temple and unceremoniously knocks him into an otherworldly unconsciousness.
—and everything blurred away into obscurity until it jutted back into sharp focus when it mattered to him again.
"While you're in this state of discovery," Sherlock says, scrolling through his phone. "Might I ask what sights you want to see?"
“I came here at some point…and we ended up…at a bar?” The images begin to align with their ecliptic significance the more he concentrates. “We were at the Roadhouse? Why were we at the Roadhouse?”
“You told me you’ve been through this before.” Sherlock says, poking about his plate with the edge of his fork.
His hands are fidgeting, thumb running over the curve of his fingers. Why is he fidgeting? Who does he possibly have to fear here?
something in that basic act, enjoyed something in being able to meet John somewhere he felt they had always belonged.
, why doesn't he see, he's moving so slowly, can't he go faster, there's no time for this, he's doing it on purpose—
He rolls out of bed, chest covered in a thin sheen of cold sweat, and staggers to the window. He throws open the blinds and cards a hand through his hair, leaning against the sill as he digs in the pocket of his pyjamas for his lighter. Snatching the box of cigarettes from the dresser beside him, he shakes one out and lights it with trembling fingers.
“Yes, well, it doesn’t have my brother’s paws all over it, and you can be quite determined when you decide to be.”
. Something inside me shifts. This thing I’ve been carrying for three years, this thing I’ve packed in salt and preserved so I didn’t have to think about it, it’s coming to the surface like patches of brine and it—and I am…I am afraid of it. I try to push it back down before John can see, before he
"Not one." Sherlock answers, staring down at another camera feed. "I've narrowed it down to three months where he could have possibly visited and still influenced this man to kill his family. I'm almost through with the video archive and there's still nothing. No sign of Moriarty or Richard Brook or even one of his little insects he employed."
myself as a test, yes. Do keep up, unless that trip in the saddle has scrambled what's left of your brains."
How could he know, as he was sent to fall after it in a burst of light that swallowed his breath, swallowed his whole being, that he’d hurt someone, hurt him grievously, and most of all.
“I thought I did.” He said evenly, and John had never seen this Sherlock before, so cold to the world, cold to his mate, swept into the dark tide of his own feelings. John had an image of them on the grass at Dartmoor, the look in his eyes, the moon banished from the night, and John knew what Sherlock’s worst fear in life was when he had said
—" He didn't like how his voice sounded, so full of shaking instability, so…insecure. For once, he wished not to be burdened with an intelligence that knew the outcome of the situation. "No—John, I—you can't leave me. You swore, John. You promised—"
For the first time in years, decades, perhaps since he had looked at John over that fire in Germany, so many centuries apart from their initial meeting yet somehow with the same feeling, he felt like crying. He felt crushed under John’s weight, the heaviness of his seminal love and dedication. He felt terrible, a beast, for making John think he wanted to leave, separate the two of them forever, yet the darkness remained, lingering somewhere in the bony depths he couldn’t touch, couldn’t see, festering away in cruel gestation.
John opened his eyes. There was something heavy, something blurred and distant that Sherlock couldn't quite place.
He was awake now, and that meant no going back to sleep. He had always had that problem, ever since Afghanistan, spending countless nights waking up in the middle or near the end and staying up until his day was supposed to begin, getting by on hours of sleep when he needed more, always needed more.
. But he doesn't, for once listening to his own better judgment. He hesitates, searching for the words that will make John believe him, and he knows that he can't plan the right words any more than he can convince John that the way he feels is real and genuine. If John could die, then there is no world left that Sherlock wants to be in. He
They both downed the sake and she drew a kit from her side, opening it to reveal bottles of ink and a pack of sterile needles, waving over a tattooed man from where he hovered in the corner.
it. You'll die one day, as certainly as I will. And you're older than I am and you have an absolutely impertinent habit of sacrificing yourself for my safety, so it may very likely be before I do."
"Sure, I reckon you thought you had it well in hand up until you met your maker." A dark thought crossed his mind, the shadow of a cloud passing over the valley. "Unless, you know, you were looking to..."
“Quite.” Sherlock agreed, moving his remaining rook. “I believe that’s checkmate.” He said, picking up the king and setting it aside with the other pieces he’d captured.
Azazel’s face furrows, and when he speaks, his voice is raw and John knows he’s speaking with more honesty than he’d ever had before.
.” He punctuates each word with a further invasion of Mycroft’s space until by the last one their noses are nearly touching.
When he was six, he dreamed of murky water and old wrinkled eyes and steel and cold wind that burned straight through him and felt like sadness. The next day his father died. Sherlock didn't notice his absence until three days later, when he noticed the curtains were drawn and he saw his mother striding through empty halls swaddled in black. He still didn't know how he felt about it.
“My apologies for the interruption.” The man says, his voice as calm as before. “We’ve had some last minute changes to our scheduled programme.”
With that oh, with that finite little word, Sherlock realised what he should have known all along, a habit he had formed with matters concerning common sense, a habit that he needed to break as soon as he could.
That’s when he sees it, by the light of the gun: movement. Clever really, hiding behind of the cars, making him think he’d fled—
." Sherlock began to pace the room, grabbing at his hair roughly. "The night before Bart's, when you first met Moran and didn't realise how lucky you were that you survived the encounter, I told you that I would never leave you. Do you remember?"
Sherlock's Enlightenment Room of his Mind Palace is inspired by the eponymous wing of the British Museum I visited last month, pictured above. Keep this room in mind, it becomes important later! I believe the picture even contains something vitally important, so do keep an eye out.
"Uh, yeah, I can't have his lot following me around everywhere just because my texts were a bit terse or I misspelled a word and he thought I'd been attacked mid-sentence."
Sherlock shakes his head and says nothing, wiping the flannel slowly over John’s arm, easing the water over dry and heated skin.
"Hopefully not." Sherlock answered, his gaze lingering on the door for a moment before settling back on John. "You shouldn't drink on an empty stomach."
Before they could react, he drew his gun, wrapped his forarm around their neck, and aimed it at their temple.
A pub, one night, bright and cheery yet managing through its odd magic that all good English pubs possess to also be gloomy and muted. He’s laughing with a friend, with Lestrade because he remembers the grainy hair and the easy grin. He’s drunk. He’s stumbled outside and someone’s leading him to a cab. Their hands aren't gloved and he wishes they were someone else’s but he can’t think of whose exactly he wants them to belong to. He remembers staring out of the window, the glass comfortingly cold, at London’s wet, blurred face as he passed by it, and he remembers wondering if anyone would miss him if he disappeared. The dark streets are tar, sucking him down, preserving him, fossilizing him, keeping him whole, keeping him in a womb of quiet stasis, keeping him waiting, waiting…waiting for what? For whom?  He knows he’s been waiting, waiting for…
As John walked out of the door, he muttered something in the hall that, propelled by that air from the closing door, floated to Sherlock and settled neatly on the table in front of him.
There are great slabs of the day where everything is utterly silent and still. Sherlock will settle into the chair opposite of where John sits in the bed, awake but unmoving. The light will break over the horizon in the morning and move unbroken across him before the shadows begin to climb his face in the evening. He never blinks. Sherlock will get up, make tea, get a book, check his email, do
And now a gap of three years lay between them with no means of getting to the other side, no words to start stitching the wound with. So much to say and nowhere to start.
"But that wasn't healthy for me to think that, so I tried not to, but I still felt it, like you try to forget about a healing wound but you still
“I want many things from you, John, but you are not amenable to granting me them at this point. I doubt you will any time soon, and I understand.”
he’d just thrown it all away, hadn’t he? He’d let himself be fooled by a demon cleverer than he was, let himself be caught off-guard and now John would never be back, never be in his life to say such lovely fragile things again, and it was all his fault, all his fault—
"You deserve every kind of hell, John Watson." Moran breathed, standing back up and kicking at John's still twitching leg. "This is the kindest one I'm offering. Addiction. You see, clonazepam embodies everything that forms an addictive substance. It takes the pain away. Makes you…dependent. Makes you think you need it to feel normal. Makes you see problems where they aren't any."
The phone is removed from beside him. It’s done. He’s done. He’d said what he wanted to say, and now they could do whatever they wanted to him. Kill him. Torture him. Break him. It didn’t mean anything now, now when he knew Sherlock had heard him.
Upon the letter’s arrival, they needed no prompting to pack up their things and find the first night coach available.
“Thank you.” She says gratefully, and he mimics zipping his mouth shut, popping the imagined key into his drink.
Sherlock said nothing, but moved his hand over the scar on John's shoulder. He shut his eyes. As he exhaled, John felt his breath skim along Sherlock's neck, arched in front of him like a column of white marble.
Is that what John's looks like now? What do burned skeletons even look like, for that matter? The skull is made of calcium, yes, but does it burn away?
"If you don't mind," he hisses, "please don't destroy our only chance of getting John back until after he's here!"
"You've never been a sidekick, John." Sherlock said, his silvered eyes meeting John's. "You've been a friend,
John turns to look at him, his eyes hard. Sherlock knows he’ll plunge into the darkness, if he has to. Sherlock also knows he will follow him, because he needs to.
"Why the long face, Holmes?" Moran barked. "Your bonnie lass' lights going out then?" He didn't have the chance to finish before Sherlock was upon him in a vicious blur of movement.
He scanned the rooftops across the grand canal. Piloerection was more likely to be caused by something behind him rather than in front—the fear response warning him of a predator approaching a vulnerable area. Nothing in the eaves, dark as they were. No disturbance in the crowds, milling about their tethered boats and sidewalks on the other shore.
The crowd was thick at the hour. John was just short enough that if Sherlock looked back in a glance he wouldn't stand out, but there was no mistaking that tall, lean frame for someone else.
It rang out through the empty night, freezing Sherlock in his tracks and sending a flock of crows fleeing into the quiet darkness.
"We can't stay here for long." John said, breaking a brief silence. "The agency knows where I am. I'm surprised they've let us stay this long."
"Ah, Mr Holmes don't think your priorities aren't so transparent. Back away from him or I send two in his skull."
An arm grabbed his shoulder and turned him away, back towards the room. John hissed, baring his teeth, and reached up, wrapping his hand around the thin gold chain on Sherlock’s neck and pulling, snapping the necklace off along with the ring strung onto it. With the other hand, he reached into Sherlock’s shirt pocket and withdrew the folded envelope.
After they’d sulked off tail-tucked and cried to her, their gang boss sent out some underlings to break in and found Sherlock licking his wounds—or stitching rather, as it’d been messier than he’d anticipated; he’d blurted ‘Ninkyo’ through a mouthful of blood, holding up his hands, before they laughed, stopped beating him, and taken him into the heart of Kyoto to face their boss. He’d been thrown to the floor, his head held high as he looked at her, absolutely certain that he was going to die, and he didn’t see the beauty of Kita Seong-Eun before him, he saw his fingers running through short strands of golden hair inside his head, and he imagined what it would have felt like without feeling the pain of the knowledge that he could only guess. But instead of shooting him and leaving him to die, however, she smiled at him, and offered a hand to help him up; she knew, as he did, that it was better the tiger was kept in your cage, and not someone else’s.
"Dying doesn't mean that I'll leave you." John said quietly. "You should know that well enough. You never left me."
"Oh, nothing less than our ultimate demise," Sherlock answered. "Mine in particular. I imagine he's still quite cross that I tried to kill him, and thought I'd succeeded. Although which bothers him more is debatable."
