Sherlock dropped his eyes, lashes grazing against John’s skin as he waited for John to continue, a swallow shifting down the man’s throat.
“Yes.”
responsibilities!”
“I-I didn’t mean-”
John tightened a glare at him for a blink, making no promises.
!” he panted.
Several fellow shoppers whirled around at the racket of John’s laughter, but Sherlock grinned down at him, watching the puffs of his warm breath swirling through the biting air. “No, I suppose it isn’t,” he chuckled, shaking his head, and then turned thoughtful, brow furrowing at the pavement beneath their feet. “Who would I be?”
“You were right,” Lestrade replied with a long-suffering sigh and tilt of his head.
“Something happened,” she said slowly, eyes narrowing even further as they focused back on him, and Sherlock swallowed, eternally perplexed by how someone who looked like the wind could snap them in half managed to instill so much fear. “Since yesterday. Something between you and John.”
“There are two end pieces, Harry!”
“Don’t you get to decide if the team gets new jerseys?” Sherlock asked coyly, looking back over his shoulder to lift a brow. “You just put in a request, or you don’t, don’t you? Captain?” he added, drawling over the title, and John was coming down with yellow fever or something, he was sure of it, he had to call in sick for the rest of the day.
His father’s face had done something strange for a moment, an alarmed sort of curiosity passing across his features, but then his mother had cleared her throat, and he had quickly smiled, looking up at her with a small nod before handing Sherlock back the prized paper possession.
“Um…pig,” Sherlock replied, wondering how
Wordlessly, she nodded, and Sherlock simply gaped at her a moment before blinking himself back to reality.
Sherlock sighed, but lifted his hand, fingers covering John’s for a moment as they replaced them, and he cleared his throat against the lump that appeared at the contact. “What precisely is this
John should have been back at least five minutes before him, even accounting for a cabbie taking the long way to squeeze extra money out of someone who didn’t know the area, but Sherlock had been back for—he checked the clock on his phone again—seven minutes, and there was no sign of him.
The man shook his head, face remaining downturned as he flicked a pale hand between them. “Just water’s fine.”
“I meant a
“Safe?” John echoed, half chuckling with incredulity. “Sherlock, I never would’ve been safe. I was going to join the army after graduation, you know that.”
“Molly was telling me you two started the business in university?” he asked after a time, and Sherlock could feel a shift in the air, like the space within the cabin of the car was shrinking as Greg inched toward his point.
She smiled at him and nodded, retracting her hand to pull the class’ textbook out of her bag.
“No, I- You were the one practicing in front of a
“And you’ve lost three,” Mycroft countered with the small, dangerous smile he favored. “I didn’t come here to argue with you-”
“Ah, yes, the twilight years of the bowl cut,” John sighed, nodding in feigned recollection, Lestrade silently shaking his head at his side. “End of an era, really. That was the same year you were in the Christmas play, wasn’t it?”
“And you, dear,” Violet said, dipping her head as she released him, a thoughtful frown creasing her forehead. “Watson… Are you the one Sherlock’s been staying with?”
Sherlock hissed a laugh, turning his eyes out over the room, a faint pang he’d been trying to stifle all day worming through his chest as he regarded the sea of faces, dreading a familiar one.
Apart from a few heart garlands draped around the color-changing bar, the space was largely devoid of decorations, which he could appreciate, but it was full of people, the dance floor throbbing to the pulsing bass of some endless electronica cover. The space normally reserved for maneuvering around the mob was stuffed with patrons talking as they worked their way to or from the bar in varying stages of drunkenness, and Sherlock drew in a shaky breath, his steps slowing as the group moved toward the bar.
“Will you hold still!” he barked, but John was still caught up in narcissistic amusement, forcing Sherlock to buzz around him, tugging this way and that at the fabric until it finally pulled free.
It was the longest second of Sherlock’s life, watching the smirk unfold on the man’s face, his arm slowly stretching out, pistol barrel levelling toward Sherlock’s head, and, with the kind of clarity only panic can bring, Sherlock simultaneously formed a plan and knew it wouldn’t work.
Sherlock frowned, reaching out to place his coffee on the table before peering over the arm of his chair. “What do you mean, ‘my stuff’?” he asked, tugging at the top of the cardboard box, and the flaps came loose, revealing his scarf haphazardly spread atop a stack of familiar books. He blinked, making to slide the scarf aside, but something firm met his touch, and he swatted the folds of fabric away to find his skull wrapped tightly within. “This-” he stammered, eyes darting between John and his possessions, “This was at Victor’s.”
“Now,” Irene chirped as she latched the door, “what can I do for you, Sherlock? The usual?”
Resolving himself to not let Molly see his schedule next semester, he begrudgingly weaved his way through the shelves, finally finding the source of his urgent errand, and then racing to the nearest checkout desk, not wanting to accidentally be drawn into conversation with the type of people likely to be mingling about the poetry section. As he approached the counter, his mobile chimed in his pocket, and he withdrew it, placing the book and his student ID on the ledge.
“He doesn’t get paid for this or anything, ya know,” she continued, her deductive skills apparently not registering John’s furious glare. “He
“Exactly.”
“What?” he muttered, and Irene sighed, rolling her eyes as she drew close to Sherlock’s side.
Sherlock shuddered—actually
“I’m serious, Sherlock.”
“No, really, I wanna know. I mean, not about the wedding,” the man muttered, tipping his head at the amendment, “but- Well, I
Sherlock chuckled, shaking his head down at the spectacle. It was a closed session, technically, but it seemed one could walk in just about anywhere on the heels of a prince, though they did have to stop at a security desk briefly for Sherlock to pick up a badge from an elderly man John greeted by name—Ali. A few heads had turned to him as he made his way to a central spot on the balcony, and then more as those few alerted their fellows, their faces distant but the confusion clear, and he’d heard John mutter what he assumed was an explanation and a lie, catching only the words “Mike” and “assistant”. Whatever John had said, it was boring enough not to be questioned, and business as usual had commenced, Sherlock tuning in and out as they prattled on about budgets and elections and infrastructure and similar words that made him yawn.
“You would know.” He smiled, tucking his phone back into his pocket.
“Think fast!”
“Er- Um- Guy?” John stammered, gripping his Sprite can so hard, it crinkled.
“I DON’T NEED YOUR HELP!” Sherlock’s hands were shaking at his sides, his eyes burning, and it was hard to focus on John’s face enough to glare at him. “I don’t! I never did, and I don’t now, so you can take your kitchen backsplash and-”
to do it for me!”
“Nobody actually takes those things seriously,” John countered. “They’ll just go down the line and check all the ‘Excellent’ boxes.”
The question now was whether it would stay that way, Mycroft already in the process of delaying the reopening of the school a few extra days, but, once their time was up, if Moriarty hadn’t revealed himself, if John was still playing dead…
John half laughed, half wept in mournful disgust, and Sherlock cringed, rattling his head as they continued down the stairs, a pact to never speak of that again formed silently between them.
It didn’t, of course, because Mr. Tyson began reading, and it didn’t sound like English at all. They then began an analysis of the first stanza, and John dove into his bag for a mechanical pencil to jot down the translation. His hand bumped into a larger, paler one, and he snapped his fingers back just as Sherlock’s pulled away.
Sherlock glared, sliding his hands into his pockets as he turned defiantly to face her. “You’ll forgive me if I don’t take advice on relationships from someone whose boyfriend just got engaged to someone else.”
Sherlock smiled, curling his fingers to slide between John’s. “Even out your karma?” he mocked, and John huffed a laugh.
“Alright,” he muttered, turning away as he moved to his own desk, pushing aside a crisps bag and collecting his book, “well, try to stay that way. Mary’s probably gonna wanna talk about her date.”
“I’m sure,” Greg chuckled, and then bit at his lip, wringing his hands in his lap, “but that’s not quite the situation either.”
“Oh, Sherlock, you won’t mind if I steal him for dinner, will you?” she asked, and Sherlock glanced at John, waiting for the subtle dip of his head before smiling.
He leaned back from the safe confines of his metal box, acerbic retort perched on the tip of his tongue, but he swallowed it down as the beaming face of Mike Stamford met him, the man weaving his way against the flow of between-classes traffic to reach his side.
The detective came up short, looking around John as he tried to see through the window in the door behind him.
“Well, you know, apart from the fact that someone is
Sherlock’s hands fumbled with his mobile, the plastic suddenly seeming greased as his eyes met unexpected but unmistakable blue ones.
Sherlock shook his head, frowning as he paced across the front of the table. “No, not a partner. A mastermind.”
Sherlock shook his head, hope creeping its way back to life from the pit in his stomach.
“It was my dad’s,” he said, turning the weapon over in his hand. “I- Mum kept it. In the house. When I left at-at Christmas…I took it. I-I didn’t want- I didn’t wanna leave it with her.” He shook his head down at the gun cradled in his hands. “I wasn’t sure-“
“Yeah, she’s here,” John answered, pointing behind him to a ridge some ways off. “Her and Harry. We were just about to go to Speedy’s.” The sun reappeared in his irises, his whole demeanor brightening around a grin. “Do you wanna come too?” he urged, and then turned his eager gaze out to the three of them. “We can all go! I already invited Sherlock, so-”
John couldn’t show all his surprise on his face just in case Sherlock had superhuman eyesight on top of everything else, but his brain thoroughly short-circuited for a moment, and he blinked dumbly into the faint light from the lab across the hall. “I, um- Why?” he muttered, clearing the remaining grogginess from his throat with a cough.
It was strange how easily John had fallen into being comfortable with Sherlock, but strange in a way one didn’t notice right away, the sort of strange that only became clear halfway through a story about how your mother got you a bike at 13 that was the same color and brand as the one you’d wanted when you were nine and she couldn’t afford it, something John belatedly realized he’d never told anyone before. He couldn’t quite pin down what it was about Sherlock that made talking to him so easy, that made John confident he wouldn’t judge, but he was still sure of it somehow, and Sherlock seemed at least just as comfortable, describing his own strained relationship with his brother when John mentioned something about him and Harry drifting apart. It was also odd how second nature the physical contact had become, their legs and arms frequently brushing together as they talked, the touches no longer inspiring spine-shivers and rapid heartbeats, but John didn’t think that was a bad thing.
Sherlock followed his path with his eyes, and, when he looked back to the house, Mrs. Watson was gone, the door closed as a shadow moved across the front windows. Closing the passenger seat door, he backed up a few steps, opening the back one on the same side, and climbed in next to John, or as next to him as he could get with John’s bag firmly—and probably strategically—placed on the seat between them.
you!”
John batted a hand at him. “He’s joking, don’t worry about it,” he muttered, turning to better face the detective, and if he made up for the severed contact of their arms with a slight brushing of knees, Sherlock didn’t seem to notice. “So, whadya got?”
“There’s nothing for it, John,” Sherlock interjected sharply, slipping his hands into his pockets, and then pushed up a soft smile, John snapping him a concerned look. “I mean, of course I don’t
He was quiet, staring at John’s fingers and wondering why he didn’t remove them, as well as being very grateful for that fact. It was anchoring, somehow; a warm weight that tethered him to this place, this moment, and made what happened in the shadows of the pitch seem far away, unable to reach him wrapped in John’s duvet on the floor of their fluorescent-lit bathroom.
“Aye aye, Captain,” she muttered, flashing a salute as she turned.
“Don’t worry, I’m not going to kill you today,” he said, smile dripping venom. “But, if you even
He tapped at the edge of his phone, willing it to beep with a notification, but the arrangement of metal and plastic remained stubbornly silent, just like it had all week.
“They will,” he assured, and Sherlock scoffed, toeing off his shoes. “It’s only been a day.”
“Oh, god,” John groaned, rolling his head back. “I don’t think we can be friends anymore if you like candy corn.”
“Seriously?” he blustered, but the man only lifted his brows, and Sherlock dropped his hand to his back pocket, fishing out his wallet.
John might have gasped if there had been any air left in the room.
“God, you’re useless when you’re drunk,” Sherlock snarled, and John just laughed harder.
“Or you’re severely underestimating it,” John countered, grinning smugly at his own line, and Sherlock was quiet a long moment before awkwardly clearing his throat.
a capable candidate,” he surmised, and Sherlock smiled as he nodded, a rare gesture of impressed approval that burned hot over John’s heart like a badge of honor.
“Right.”
It was now 10:53, and, feeling he had been more than generous—as well as being thoroughly exhausted with fielding Mrs. Hudson’s attentions all on his own—Sherlock was waiting for John to rouse. He was going to be scolded for this, he was sure of it, but, for the moment, he couldn’t bring himself to regret it.
John tilted his head, confused, his mouth opening for what promised to be a snide comment, but then he hesitated, lips closing back together as he swallowed. “I-” he stammered, mouth twitching around more words that never came. He then set his jaw, stubborn anger creasing his brow once more. “You know,” he muttered, “now tell me what-”
The castle was just as grand on the inside, but less austere, a warmth emanating from the stained wood details, plush rugs, roaring fires, and Christmas bursting from every flat surface or hook. The foyer was an alternating starburst of black and white marble, but the remainder of the castle was mostly hardwood with the exception of the bustling chef’s kitchen—which he doubted he would ever find again—bathrooms, and the grand ballroom, where ornate golden chandeliers reflected on pale swirls of marble, the curved back wall of the room entirely glass to overlook the twinkling town and towering mountains, the world seeming to stretch on forever from their gilded perch.
“Holmes!”
“Golly, did you ever!”
“A thing?” Molly echoed. “What kind of thing?”
John blinked, his eyes shifting over to Taylor before settling on Sherlock with a soft smile. “You really have no idea how sweet you are sometimes, do you?”
solve a jewel heist here last year.” He held John’s eyes, watching the doubt give way to something else, something closer to what he’d seen in the lobby, a sort of lost exasperation.
It took three trips, but they managed to get all the plates to the terrace, dragging the table over beside the fire pit, whatever dish they were currently working on resting on the surround in front of them, reaching off the edge to avoid being melted by the flames. Just as they shifted from starters to desserts, the bell began to chime, and the crowd below them erupted in cheers.
to call me in-”
John stepped out the bathroom door, a roll of first aid tape, half-spent package of gauze pads—Sherlock broke a lot of beakers—and tube of Dettol cream in his hands. He was looking down at the cream at first, eyes shifting as if reading the microscope print on the back, and then opened his mouth to speak, the sentence dying on his tongue with a hiss of breath as he lifted his gaze to Sherlock’s. He stalled at the mouth of the corridor, lips closing as he fidgeted with the gauze packaging, and then stepped forward with a swallow, eyes on the coffee table as he placed the materials on the dark wood. “There,” he muttered, flicking a hand down at the spread, “that-that should take care of it.”
“How long did that take?”
Sherlock’s hands fell away from his chin, thumping to his desk as his lips dropped apart. “What?”
John chuckled. “Maybe next time,” he offered, and Lestrade nodded, John taking it for a farewell as he turned to hurry after Sherlock.
It was a ploy, clearly—whether by Moriarty to distract him, or by Victor to bring him back in—but that wasn’t the part that bothered Sherlock, wasn’t the reason he could feel his stomach slowly being eaten away inside him.
“We?” Sherlock inquired, flipping his scarf around his neck as he followed John out into the corridor. “I was with you?”
“Sherlock?” his father said, his voice strangely watery to Sherlock’s ears. “What are you doing here? I thought you were staying after school to-” He stopped, catching sight of John at the head of the bed, and Sherlock certainly hoped he wasn’t that red too.
John watched him, smile widening whenever the raving reached a particularly comical fever pitch, and slowly worked at his latest blog entry, consulting the notes he had taken to scribbling at crime scenes. It was an odd normal, but it was theirs, Sherlock muttering away about blood spatter while John typed on strangulation marks, and the smile never quite left him, even when it was probably inappropriate—nothing charming about petechial hemorrhaging, after all. As the timbre of Sherlock’s voice lulled on into the wee hours of the morning, John’s thoughts turned to bees, to the years that stretched out in front of him—most of which would likely be spent in various derivatives of this moment—and, though it was nothing like the white picket fence, 2.5 kids, and dog he had always been told to strive for, he couldn’t bring himself to anywhere near regret it.
“Your Christmas present,” John repeated, smiling even as his stomach rolled with nerves. “It’s technically gonna be a bit early, but it’s the only time I could do it.”
!?” she shrieked.
“Can I- What?” he stammered, too distracted by the room to take in her words.
“Did you make any more progress on that homeless case after I went to bed?” John said, knowing that was the source of Sherlock’s distress.
The man tilted his head, eyebrows furrowing in an inquisitive frown, but John only shook his head, waving a hand in silent promise to explain later.
“Remind me not to leave you in the dormitory alone,” he chuckled, shaking his head.
“Snitch,” she chuckled, tossing her napkin to land neatly atop his head, and Sherlock laughed, tugging the linen free before balling it up and throwing it back at her, the table slowly calming down enough to return to their meal.
“Nothing,” he finally managed to chuckle. “That’s just...so appropriate.”
He dropped his eyes to the Parliament building, a heavy sigh rolling through his shoulders.
The man’s brown eyes widened fearfully for a moment before he turned away, quickly bustling past Sherlock without a glance, which was probably for the best as Sherlock was glaring at him.
John turned, smiling across at the man as they slowed to a stop at an intersection. “You sound surprised.”
“Proving you wrong,” John replied, Sherlock’s mouth opening to reply just as he freed the contents, a tan hand holding up a large plastic ball. “It’s a Magic 8 Ball,” John explained, shifting the enlarged black billiards ball between his hands. “Mum said it was the last one in stock. Apparently, it can tell the future.”
Sherlock chuckled, hesitating a moment as he glanced down at his pressed trousers, but weighed the novelty of getting a peek into John’s inner circle to be more important than his dry cleaning. He settled down beside Kavi, stretching his legs out and crossing them at the ankles, planting his palms on the floor behind his waist to prop his torso up.
“I-I guess,” John murmured, still not entirely sure how this was relevant to his histamine reactions.
“Who, us?” he bleated, waving a hand between him and Sherlock. “We would
“We’re going out shopping after lunch, Sherlock,” Mrs. Hudson interjected from where she was needlessly tidying the few things John had dropped on top of the dresser the night before. “If you’d like to come.”
much more difficult,” he said disparagingly, and Sherlock laughed, the blond chuckling along, and then, once again, they were just staring, smiles still lingering on their faces. John dropped his eyes first, teeth scraping over his lip as he looked down at the table, and then abruptly lifted his head, drawing in a breath. “Sherlock, I-”
“Oh, yeah,” he said, swallowing thickly as he adjusted his bag on his shoulder. “Just transferred in this year.” He smiled stiffly, mentally kicking himself. Of course he just transferred in this year, that was the whole point of being new, idiot!
“At the law offices of Strattan and Foley,” Sherlock replied, forcing John to jog a few strides as he charged toward a narrow gap between two of the buildings. “They rent the fifth floor of this building,” he added, indicating the structure on their right, and John blinked up at the wall of dark windows reflecting streetlights in watery streaks.
On to the teaser!
Three hours later, John was just drifting off, his eyes closing longer and longer with every blink, when the dormitory door opened, a familiar tousled shadow stretching across the floor. “Sherlock?” he murmured, pushing himself up to sitting against the wall.
for this pathetic excuse for a holiday.”
“Oh?” she asked, and Sherlock nodded. “What program?”
! Honestly, Sherlock, you’ve done some barmy things, but this may take the cake.”
“Oh?” John teased, still drunk on immediate forgiveness. “And you can assure that, can you?”
“Jesus!” Mycroft hissed, and Sherlock almost passed out from the shock of hearing that in his brother’s voice alone. “Sit down,” he urged, guiding Sherlock into the chair by the shoulders, and he couldn’t even muster a show of impudence, willing to admit that, just this once, Mycroft’s idea wasn’t abysmal.
“Do you have the budget reports for the hospital fundraiser?” John asked, turning to Mike, who dove into the satchel at his side and produced a small stack of papers pinched together with a binder clip.
He straightened his spine, stepping back to pick up his bag. “But, I guess you were right,” he said, voice cold steel as he met Sherlock’s uncertain gaze unflinchingly. “You don’t have friends.”
“John!” he practically begged, but John wanted the proper stuff, and swirled his tongue around each of Sherlock’s balls in turn, watching the resulting muscle spasm shaking out across the man’s thigh. “Fuck, John!” Sherlock cried, and John wondered if he was doing that on purpose, knowing full-well that the fact that he cursed almost exclusively in bed was inexplicably one of John’s turn-ons, but then… “Please,” he whimpered, tugging at John’s scalp. “Please, John, ple-“
Sherlock centered himself on the sofa, making sure the card was splayed to cover the entirety of his face, and then stilled as the living room door opened, the soft padding of John’s socked feet coming to a halt beside him.
He wanted very much to take it, to twine his fingers with Sherlock’s pale digits that held an almost supernatural strength, but he couldn’t, not here, so close to prying eyes and unshielded by tinted windows, and the lie of it sent a potent shot of bile up his throat. He had been the one to tell Sherlock it would be alright, that they would figure it out, but now that he was staring down the barrel of reality, he was not nearly so certain.
“Well, look at that,” the woman quipped, flicking her brows at him. “A gentleman in this day and age. I was beginning to think you’d gone extinct.”
“It’s okay, it’s okay!” urged a familiar voice beside him, and Sherlock turned, meeting John’s concerned gaze from where the boy perched on the edge of his mattress. “It was just a dream,” he assured, and Sherlock blinked hard at him, wondering why John’s face refused to come into focus before he realized there was something cold rolling down his cheek, and he lifted a trembling hand, fingertips brushing against the still-damp tear tracks on his skin. “You’re safe now,” John continued, reaching a hand out toward Sherlock’s thigh. “There’s nothing to be-”
“No,” he murmured, pulling his legs in as tight as he could.
John chuckled, shuffling his feet on the ground. “I didn’t really doubt you,” he admitted with a small shrug. “I just- Well, I’d never seen one before. A fireworks show, I mean.” He kept his eyes fixed on the sky as he watched Sherlock turn to him in his peripheral vision. “From a distance, sure, and the odd one that the neighbors set off, but never…never
“Stop doing that!” he snapped, flapping a chiding finger at the man, who only chuckled, pushing up to standing now that his dramatic entrance was complete. “I’ve almost been killed enough tonight without you finishing the job!”
“Nothing, just...is this tie too much?”
“Mrs. Hudson!” he snarled, and the woman tutted back into her flat, the door creaking closed a moment before John’s footsteps started up the stairs.
out for Saturday.”
“Maybe,” she admitted, smoothing the sequins on her dress, “but I can’t get sloppy drunk and dance with strangers here.”
John smiled, looking surprisingly quite grateful for something he didn’t need. “Thanks, we’ll check it out,” he assured, nodding, pulling Sherlock into this with a glance.
The sun was stretched in through the open window, catching on dust before coming to rest in John’s hair, glittering prismatically off the flaxen strands. His brow furrowed while he searched, tongue sticking out between his teeth as he wriggled a package loose from the confines of his clothes, and then turned back to Sherlock, haggardly wrapped bundle in his hands and triumphant smile on his face. He looked up, meeting Sherlock’s eyes, and then blinked, tilting his head with a small frown. “What?” he muttered, confused smile slowly lifting up his lips at the corners.
“What?” Sherlock whispered, a wary ridge beginning to form between his brows, and John quickly shook his head to assuage his fears.
“Know him from rugby,” John explained, pausing at a pedestrian crossing as a group of students wobbled past. “He lives with some other guys on the team.”
“Some might call that a hint.”
“We have all night,” John continued, filling in the space. “There’s food and coffee. And no one’s supposed to be in until 7 tomorrow.”
“Yes, you are,” John retorted, and Sherlock did look at him then, likely ready to spit out another denial, but stopped short, eyes taking in the absurd grin on John’s face.
“Sherlock, I am
“But you-” John argued, but Harry shook her head.
“So that leaves…” He trailed off, turning his fingers toward Sherlock, a question in his lilting brow.
Mrs. Hudson’s lips pursed with skepticism, her brow furrowing as she narrowed her eyes at John, as if already blaming him for Sherlock contracting the plague.
“Ya made it!” Thank god for Lestrade, striding up to them with arms stretched wide, a beer bottle in one hand. “Thought I was seeing things for a second there! Nice wig,” he said, nodding at John’s head.
“I will leave you here.”
“I don’t mean to,” Sherlock murmured, running a thumb along the rim of his cip, and John stopped on his way to the kitchen, spinning around on his heels.
as John placed his cup on the table beside his chair.
“Yes!” John exclaimed, voice high with exasperation.
“That is...something of a long story,” Sherlock replied with a sidelong glance, but John only shrugged, curling the corners of his mouth.
John brightened suddenly, halting his advance and standing up straight, a giddy grin on his face that sent Sebastian into a spasm of wincing. “So,” he chirped, clapping his hands, and the man jumped, “any questions? Comments?”
Sherlock sniffed, shaking his head. “No, tell him to go back to his midnight buffet,” he said, Lyle ducking his head with a smile and typing out no such thing.
“Yeah, well, I tried not to!” John countered helplessly, and Sherlock leaned back against the counter as he laughed, bracing himself on a palm. “Easier said than done, it turns out.”
to 25
There was a rustle from behind him, a clicking of glass on wood, and John remembered with a start that Sherlock was still in there, clearly trying to alert someone to his presence before the conversation went too far.
, Sherlock!” his father spat, roughly throwing him off, and Sherlock’s hand planted flat on the corner of the table, barely catching him from falling to the floor. “I have to do this!”
The woman—Sandra, he saw, glancing down when she dropped her head—huffed a short laugh, her bright pink lips lifting in a fragile smile. “I don’t know if I’ll ever be comfortable,” she said, and Sherlock took a breath, steeling himself for the inevitable hand-holding portion of the meeting. “After the divorce, I threw myself into my work. Trying to get this account or that office or the next big promotion. Then, earlier this year, I made partner, and I realized…there was nowhere else to go.” She shrugged, her youthful face weary with regret. “I’d run out of room to climb, but it still wasn’t high enough.”
“To everyone but them,” John grumbled, rolling his eyes as Sherlock chuckled.
“Why does everyone keep saying that!?” Sherlock interjected as he spun back, startling honks from the swans as they beat their wings and scuttled back over the surface of the water. “Why do you think I know
“No, don’t worry about it,” John assured, shaking his head, voice already a little slurred. “I like listening to you.” John smiled up at him, and Sherlock hoped the dim light and John’s half-closed eyes were enough to prevent the flush flaring up his face from being visible. John sighed, tugging the blanket to his chest as he shifted, bouncing and wriggling further into the furniture, his eyes closing. “Play it, Sam,” he said with about as much grandeur as someone can muster speaking halfway into an armrest.
“18, and I can’t be expected to explain the depravity of mankind.”
“Sherlock,” John said—a question, a warning, a plea—his grip tightening over Sherlock’s hand, and Sherlock took a deep breath, lifting his chin, the helplessness in John’s wide eyes steadying him somehow, “what-what are you-”
(See the end of the chapter for
“What are you- Oi!” John tried to wriggle away, planting his hands to the tile for leverage. “What are you
him, well on his way to telling a proper joke, but John was too frustrated to be proud. “But it was my idea!”
Sherlock nodded, following to the small queue.
“I-I asked about scholarships,” the blond muttered, and Sherlock turned to find him tapping anxiously on the side of his cup. “I wasn’t sure if I should, ya know, in case they didn’t think I could pay for it, but…well, I
“Sherlock!” John trumpeted as he twisted toward the door, but they were, for the moment, safe from any hooded figures wielding blood-spattered axes. “We have to get out of here!”
Aborted sexual assault. Nothing graphic, but there's emotional aftermath.
They all looked toward the voice, a petite woman with shoulder-length blond hair breaking the wall of people in front of them, waving with the hand that wasn’t towing a taller redhead.
is the boxes of
He tentatively took it, pulling it up to his face. “Oh, the kidney bean!” he announced, pointing down at the mobile as he handed it back.
“Get Peters!” Mycroft shouted, turning his face to the men hovering behind him, and they bolted out the door, practically racing one another down the steps.
“How do you know?”
“Sherlock!”
“See, your mouth says no, but the fear in your eyes says yes,” he taunted, smirking as Sherlock swallowed. “Come on,” he cajoled, nodding toward the door, “I wanna get there early. I had a dream last night that the building kept moving and we had to chase it all over London.”
“Don’t,” John said, eerily calm all of a sudden, his eyes blazing. “Don’t put that on me, Sherlock.” He shook his head, lowering a steady finger down toward him, his voice dripping with venom. “Don’t you
Sherlock slid down the back of the chair, coming to rest in it properly, and tapped his fingers in waves on the armrests. All the time he had been alone, the years and years of practice, and now a few minutes without John had his teeth on edge. He was bordering on sentiment, and he knew it, and he gripped the leather firmly as he mentally vowed to get a handle on himself.
“We get it, you went to private school,” Sean bemoaned, rolling his eyes to the ceiling. “Now, will you go back to trying to stab one another like civilized gentlemen?”
“But you don’t have to,” he ranted on, head shaking erratically, a bubble of hysteria spreading out across his chest. “You don’t have to, because I can fix it! I can figure it out, I know I can! I can beat him!”
“You could come in, you know,” Sherlock muttered, eternally irritated by John’s unnecessary propriety requiring him to shout through the door.
Sherlock nodded, still looking at what appeared to be Lestrade’s shoes.
John held his gaze, blue eyes shifting between grey ones, and Sherlock’s inside squirmed with nerves under the skeptical scrutiny. “Did you take anything?” he asked finally, his fingers twitching against the tile.
, John? He’s special. The first of his kind, a new breed, the consulting criminal to my consulting detective.”
“But why would I be there at all?” John asked, opting for directness, trying to phrase the question so clearly, it was impossible to wriggle out of an answer. “This is when you retire, right?” he asked, and Sherlock nodded even though John barely paused for an answer. “That’s not for years yet. Decades!”
John’s hand stalled in delivering eggs to his mouth. “What?” he asked with a frown.
“That is
John remained silent, watching intently as Sherlock sighed, stretching his hand across his forehead to knead at his temples.
Personally, Sherlock didn’t see the point of it. It was a meaningless holiday, a pink and sparkly monstrosity of capitalism that required the purchase of sweets no one ever actually got around to eating, and, even at 7, he was already far too old for it. He didn’t like the horrible heart-shaped chocolates and chalky conversation hearts the teachers always passed around, nor the tedious process they were always put through of constructing their “Valentine Mailbox”, a piece of cardstock folded and stapled together before being decorated and taped to the front of their desk. There was never anything in his anyway, not apart from the baby-animals-themed valentine from the teacher with some horrible sentiment of “You’re purr-fect” or “Terrier-ific!”, and he always threw that away with his undecorated mailbox the second they were permitted to leave, getting out ahead of his classmates as they struggled with their bursting parcels.
“Yeah, well, I had a thought…”
A heavy hum of silence followed, unbroken until John shifted on his bed.
done this; I-I don’t even know
He choked on a laugh, taking a couple steadying breaths as he looked up at Sherlock, the amusement draining from his body in a rush of cold. “W-What?” he stammered, straightening up against the fridge.
John blinked, his eyes softening for a moment, and then he smiled, giving Sherlock a quick nod before they both turned back to the window at the sound of the door opening.
John was silent and still, but Sherlock didn’t dare look up to read his face. He must have at least somewhat believed him, however, because he stepped away slightly, breaking the contact with Sherlock’s legs. “What did you mean about Molly?” he asked, more curious than angry. “About her not fancying you anymore.”
He was
“Because, if I just hold it, you’ll hit me,” John quipped, flashing a grin down at the detective before returning to his task, tongue caught between his teeth in concentration.
“What’s going on?” Mrs. Hudson interjected, shuffling up to John’s side, her eyes wide and frantic as they fluttered between them. “Where are you going?”
“Really?” John drawled skeptically, and Sherlock shrugged, lifting his eyes to blue ones.
“Fucking hell.” A man appeared at Harry’s side, rattling his head in annoyance as he turned over his shoulder to look back at the crowd. “Thought I’d never find you in here! Why is it so bloody crowded? And why didn’t you reply to my text?” He lifted up his phone, a blur of message bubbles on the screen as he flashed it at Harry.
Two weeks was an
“I didn’t mean it, you know.”
“Clearly,” Prince John scoffed, and Sherlock turned his chin toward him.
“She’s a drama major.”
“It wasn’t that,” Sherlock interrupted, folding back down to shake his head against John’s hair.
“We tried that before, remember?” John answered, his breath smoking out as he turned, cheeks reddening more every second. “He forgot, and the entire team had to run back up to the school to get dressed.”
1) This chapter has time jumps in it, indicated by the rows of ********* because I thought making you click through to a new chapter would've broken the thread a little too much
“What if he suddenly
“What name did he give you?” Sherlock asked, mind palace cataloging every word.
John lifted his brows, bobbing his head in agreement. “I got the feeling,” he remarked, and then simply smiled at him, Sherlock not entirely sure how long he stared before realizing what he was doing, hastily blinking his eyes down as he wrung his hands on the cold metal table. “What happened to your hand?” John asked, nodding down at the appendage when Sherlock looked up with a frown.
Sherlock’s breath caught, body thrumming with anxious anticipation as John let the sentence fade into the crackling air, closing his eyes and dropping his head.
Sherlock smiled, slow and deadly. “Positively crystalline,” he hissed, beaming innocently as Mycroft glared. A second later, the sarcastic cheer disintegrated, giving way to a cold glower. “Now get out.”
Lestrade snorted, flicking his eyebrows, and then his expression turned puzzled as he stretched his neck to peer around John. “Did those dominos spell out ‘fuck’? In script?”
“But it doesn’t
John chuckled, but it quickly withered as he pondered the genuine possibility. Apparently there would be no violence today, though, because Sherlock strode out of the door in front of them just as John and Greg reached it.
Sherlock smiled, chuckling softly as he shook his head and turned back to the phone. “One day and you’re already solving crimes together?” Sherlock recited, overdramatic in his imitation, and John beamed. “Should we expect a happy announcement soon? A white, winter wedding at the Dorchester?”
, but he could hardly be blamed for orchestrating it now and again, not when John didn’t seem to mind. Trouble was, now that he’d started, he couldn’t stop.
“The only way,” he echoed bitterly, shaking his head as he felt the embers of anger being stoked back to life in his chest. “Three days,” he hissed, turning a blazing glare to his brother, whose eyes widened as his approach stalled. “You let me- Three
Below them, John hoisted the ball in the air, spinning around in celebration before being unceremoniously swept off his feet by a tidal wave of teammates, flashes of blue shorts and neon boots the only thing distinguishing the men from the snow and mud of the ground beneath them. The game wasn’t over, however, and they gradually broke apart, John reappearing at the bottom, hoisted to his feet by a tall black teammate Sherlock thought he remembered as Marcus. They started toward the center of the pitch, Marcus nudging John on the arm, both of them laughing in some shared joke, and then Marcus jogged on ahead, John lifting his head to scan the crowd as he continued at a slower pace. It didn’t take him long to find them in the stands—Sherlock credited Molly’s highlighter-hued hat—and he lifted a hand, waggling his muddy fingers in the air.
John smiled back so warmly, Sherlock saw the stutter of his own heart play out across Alice’s still-four-years-older face. “You’re welcome,” he answered, nodding gently, and then turned back to the door, Sherlock and Lestrade reaching the exit of the observation room at the same moment.
“I don’t need to know everything about her, Sherlock,” John interrupted gently, his smile fond.
Sherlock blinked, mouth agape as he stared down at John, who was now turned away, shoulders squared and eyes darting over the wall. “I beg your-”
John’s eyes narrowed at the dripping condescension. “I’m not going to spy on my roommate,” he said, firm and final.
“No,” Sherlock grumbled irritably, because it did bother him, although not remotely the way John meant.
“I know what you meant.” He entered the room with a laugh, shaking his head at Sherlock’s sour expression and passing him down a cup. “I’m sure you’d come up with a much more original pet name than ‘honey’.”
John looked down at the silver watch clutched in, of course, his
“Yeah, that’s right!” Taylor was shouting again, his head nodding disjointedly in rage as he looked between Sherlock and John. “Get your little boyfriend out of here before I-”
“Stop,” Sherlock interjected, rattling his head as he lifted his hands between them, staggering a step back. “What-What are you- What are you
John nearly dropped the box, stumbling on a step in surprise. “I-I didn’t- That wasn’t a date,” he spluttered, and Irene chuckled, shaking her head as they rounded the second floor landing and started up the next flight. “And this isn’t either, I’m just...helping out.”
“Alright,” Sherlock mumbled, embarrassed, but John had offered, his brilliant grin not seeming at all troubled by Sherlock’s instant attachment.
“But it’s alright for you to do it,” he snapped, waving a hand out at the man without meeting his eyes. “You can collect first dates like stamps, but, when
“Found something?” John said, and it was all Sherlock could do not to jump through the ceiling at the proximity of it. John was standing at his shoulder, athletic shorts now in place and completely bereft of a shirt.
“What?” His father lifted his hands in a shrug, and Sherlock sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose and shaking his head at the floor.
“Oh my god, Sherlock!” John pleaded exasperatedly, but there was a hint of a laugh in it that Sherlock could not comprehend. “Will you stop reciting the bloody dictionary and answer the question?!”
“I’m serious,” John assured, nodding emphatically. “Show me what it is you see here,” he continued, sweeping a hand over the pictures. “Maybe I can help.”
When he pushed open the door, Sherlock was lounging on his bed, feet lolling off the edge, and John knew he was caught the second those grey eyes looked up, not having bothered composing himself as he had expected Sherlock to be in the lab. Sure enough, Sherlock lowered his book to his lap, tilting his head with furrowing brows.
The man glanced up through his lashes, scanning him. “Heavy metal?” he teased, and Sherlock smiled, drawing a subtle breath through his nose to steady himself.
Sherlock smiled, shifting a bit in his seat, and John actually missed the first few of his words due to being momentarily overwhelmed by a more deliberate brush of his elbow. “-shouldn’t be much longer. I’ve got most of them made already.”
“Yeah,” John chirped, a little stilted, the tone of someone clearly only agreeing out of politeness and really praying that you never called with a concrete plan. “Yeah, that’d be fun.”
to see the look on his face when Lestrade- MMPH!”
For a single, terrifying moment, Sherlock thought he had ruined it, that he had finally proven every bad thing John had no doubt heard right, that he had shown beyond a shadow of a doubt that he was just as irredeemably insane as their quarry. He opened his mouth, ready to assure that he wasn’t homicidal, no matter how many elaborate ways he had thought up to kill Mycroft, but John seemed to sense something had gone awry in Sherlock’s head and intervened.
It was technically day two of moving into 221B Baker Street, but, considering they’d spent most of the first day at Speedy’s catching up with Mrs. Hudson, it was really more like hour seven. They were nearly done though, only the finishing touches left, and Sherlock settled his pillow on the bed just as Mrs. Watson whipped the duvet over it, a simple forest green where John’s was dark blue.
Sherlock’s heart stopped, jaw dropping open. He quickly gathered it up, however, though not quick enough if John’s rising brow was any indication. “I- No!” he spluttered, shaking his head. “That’s- Why would you-”
Sherlock flicked his wrist a little harder than before, the swans having to double back to fetch the morsel. “So
Mrs. Hudson had cooed over her neck pillow, insisting Sherlock go microwave it for her right away, and then had sat in her chair for the remainder of the presents, demanding hers be brought to her lest she disturb the relaxation process by moving.
A figure stepped out through the door, looking side-to-side before heading across the pitch, and John took a step forward, mouth opening to call out to the groundskeeper before the shout died in his throat.
“Five?” John echoed, moving around Sherlock’s back. “There were at least a dozen files in that box.”
“Well, I-” John began, diplomatic as ever, but Sherlock intervened.
“Okay,” John chirped, the cheerful tone edged with frustration. He began eating, focusing intently down at his plate so he didn’t have to know if Sherlock was still staring at him.
Sherlock blinked.
Rattling his head at the absurdity of allowing such a thought to even take up a fraction of the valuable space in his brain, he spun open his combination lock, flinging the locker door out to block the gruesome scene as he rooted amongst his books for the bottle of aspirin he always had on hand for the literal headaches of academia.
“Yeah, just…work on something else for a while,” he suggested with a small shrug. “Clear your head a bit. Maybe, if you take a step back-”
“Are we going to stand here chatting all night,” Irene interjected, sharp eyes darting between them, her hands on her hips, “or is one of you going to make me a cuppa?”
He remembered his tiny Christmas tree in his office in London and almost laughed, thinking back on how Molly had had to sneak even that much Christmas spirit into his space, and here he was stepping into a holiday card. And that was just the
get around to it!”
So Sherlock settled for pouting, but whether it because he was going to be force-fed chicken, or because John had stopped pushing him along, he wasn’t sure.
A corner of Sherlock’s lip twitched, and he sat, the glow of the fire softening his features as he stared into the rippling flames. There was a heaviness in his gaze, eyes distant and searching from their sunken seat, and John noticed for the first time how tired he looked, the waning hour stripping away all arrogance to leave only a man grasping at straws just as desperately as he was.
“Why, John Watson,” he drawled, cocking his hip against the glass once more, “I thought you’d never ask.”
He jolted up to find silver-blue eyes glittering at him from the doorway, an irritated scowl spread across the mouth below.
!? Mike Stamford, I have never stolen a thing in my life!”
“What are you hens clucking about?” Sean asked, his helmet removed and tucked under his arm as he stepped off the mat.
“Did you…need something?” Sherlock prompted, closing the door as he quirked his brow, and Mike blinked, dropping his face as he twisted his backpack around to his side.
“Methamphetamine,” Sherlock replied, shrugging a shoulder as he flicked a glance back at the slide clamped within his microscope. “At the lethal dose.”
,” he mused, shaking his head perplexedly as he stepped forward, Sherlock matching it with a retreat. The blond man then moved again, shifting back toward the center of the room, blocking off Sherlock’s path to the door, and Sherlock swallowed, his hands beginning to shake with adrenaline. Moran’s gaze tracked down his arms, his lips twisting as he saw the quaking digits, and then he lifted his eyes, brown sparkling over the taunting smile. “Well, how ‘bout it, Sherlock?” he quipped, tipping his head as he lifted the gun in the air beside his face, twisting it pointedly in his hand. “Let’s see if gods bleed.”
With that rather clear dismissal, John pocketed his phone. The script of the conversation drifted back up into his mind, and he tried not to smile too widely to himself as he entered the restaurant, a bell tinkling over his head.
“You eliminated everyone without blond hair,” Sherlock interjected, and Irene beamed at him.
loyal.”
“Yeah, it’ll just be a second,” he assured, dropping his face to finish adorning the beverage, but the girl spoke out yet again.
Sherlock found himself nodding. “Alright,” he muttered.
Donovan’s eyes narrowed sharply. “You’re one to talk,” she snapped. “I’d rather be run over by a lorry than be Sherlock Holmes.”
Molly rolled her eyes, bumping his side with her shoulder. “Too modest for your own good. That would have made an excellent pickup line.”
a park a couple blocks away. And Mycroft was
“Please, let me.” Greg swept back in to her side, placing gentle fingers over hers on the plastic handle, both of them freezing a moment before Molly slid away, tucking her hair behind her ears and going from pink to red as Greg took over the steering. He cleared his throat, neck looking a little sunburned all of a sudden. “Follow me,” he said, and started toward one of the exit doors, Molly pointedly looking anywhere but Sherlock’s smirking face.
John opened and closed his mouth a few times, faint, choking noises drifting up his throat, but he eventually relented, closing his lips and smiling softly before turning his eyes to the passengers. His eyebrows furrowed and unfurrowed several times as he considered the options, blue turning sharp as it scanned. “Kendall?” he said after a time, his voice rising with uncertainty.
to the practices,” he teased, smirking as John sneered, “if-if you wanted- Well, you might as well come to the show.” He shrugged a shoulder, smiling softly as John blinked at him in surprise, having fully expected to at least be given the cold shoulder for a few days in retaliation for the breach of privacy. “I mean,” Sherlock continued, scratching at his neck, “you don’t have to. I just thought-”
John’s expression was a practically audible ‘Oh, please’.
trust me!”
John nodded, and then their earlier conversation drifted into his mind. “Oh,” he muttered, not entirely comfortable voicing his wonderings, but Sherlock seemed the type to prefer to get these sorts of things out in the open. “Boyfriends, then?” he asked, trying to remain as casual as possible, but it was ruined as Sherlock raised an eyebrow at him. “Which is fine, by the-”
“Er, yeah,” Sherlock muttered, and John’s hand clenched to a fist against the towel. “Yeah, sure.”
“Hi, you’ve reached John Watson! Obviously, I can’t come to the phone right now, but leave your name and number, and I’ll call you back the second I can.”
“Unconventional?” John asked, because, apparently, inflection was a lost art.
It looked like just an ordinary house, nothing distinguishing it from any of the other row houses on the block, but, to those who knew, it was known as ‘The House’, the matching piece to Irene’s ‘The Woman’. The interior was all dark wood and rich rugs, nothing obviously unseemly, but the rooms were almost too neat, too fragrant, the kind of clean that always covers up the ugliest of dirt.
He panted as John released him, tongue soothing a stripe over the flushed skin, and Sherlock wanted so desperately to see it, to carve the image of John’s brand into his mind, and just the thought that it was there, a prickling sensation on his skin in the shape of John’s mouth, sent a spike of arousal rocketing through his gut. He’d always been jealous, always been possessive, always been the one to control, and, if anyone had told him he’d be dizzy with lust over being on the receiving end, he’d have told them they were crazy. Nevertheless, he couldn’t deny the tremors in his fingers, the pounding of his heart, and, as John traced back up, lips brushing chapped against Sherlock’s ear, his hips jerked involuntarily, making it impossible to hide just how deeply affected he was.
“I don’t know what it is,” he spat, opening settings for the third time that week. “John just keeps personalizing his text alert to it.”
He wanted John to feel guilty, which he clearly did. He wanted John to apologize, which he had. Sure, he wanted to leave John dangling for a while, petty as that may be, but he’d never intended it to go on forever, or even for this long.
“I didn’t want to worry you,” Sherlock offered, but it was a weak excuse, and John huffed a laugh.
Sherlock’s mouth twitched as he blinked a few, quick times, and then an imperious eyebrow slowly rose. “Are those two things related, or…?”
“Case?” John asked, craning his neck to see over where Sherlock was leaning against his shoulder.
He staggered a couple of wobbly steps backward as Victor’s words from weeks ago washed over him, hazy in the dim world that existed outside of the liquid glistening within the glass. His breaths were coming in short gasps, the fact that he could hear them the only evidence that he was breathing at all. His lungs burned with the lactic lack of oxygen, and he wondered how the same sensation could feel so unpleasant now compared to when he had been with John.
“It’s sort of corny,” he said with a tip of his head, “but her other idea was Gatsby, so we didn’t have much choice. Either way she gets her green light, I suppose.” He laughed, Sherlock chuckling along as he made a mental note to ask Molly what the hell he had missed. “So, basically, you wear different colors based on your relationship status,” John explained, rolling a hand through the air, and, though it may have been a mere trick of the light, Sherlock thought John’s cheeks darkened a shade. “Red if you’re taken, yellow if it’s sort of an ‘it’s complicated’ type situation, and green if you’re single.” He shrugged, looking down at the invitation in Sherlock’s hand. “I’d tell you you don’t have to participate, but it’ll be mostly us there, and we all have to, so it might be a little awkward for you if you don’t.”
“Why are you doing this?” Sherlock’s voice was small, eyes brimming with hot tears he couldn’t be sure came from fury or frustration as he shook his head down at his lap. “Why are you- Is it really that ridiculous?” He lifted his face, suddenly so tired, tired in every sense of the word, and, liquid courage or not, he wasn’t letting this go on any longer. He couldn’t. “That someone might actually
“Then what?” John pressed, and Sherlock was nearly hyperventilating now, sending potent wafts of John’s shampoo coursing through his nostrils and firmly not helping the situation. “Why are you- MMPH!”
“A friend, eh?” Angelo echoed, adding in a wink to prove things could always get worse. “Well, always nice to see a fresh face. Get tired of looking at this same lot every weekend,” he quipped, his booming laugh easing the tension somewhat. “So,” he continued, clapping his hands together as he smiled between them, “what can I get ya?”
“Really? You’re going to try and bait me with
, John; she’s always half naked.”
“John, dear?!” Mrs. Hudson’s voice drifted up the stairs outside the kitchen. “Can you come down a moment? I need your help with something.”
Sherlock snapped his head up, staring at John with wide, almost fearful eyes, and a few gasps from down the hall confirmed just how loud that had really been.
“I think the Shakespeare’s gone to your head,” the detective murmured, shifting their linked arms as he swung his hand to tap teasingly against John’s side.
, down—beneath your ‘I hate everyone’ exterior, Sherlock Holmes has a heart.”
Mycroft sighed into the middle distance, and then shook his head, fixing Sherlock was an unusually soft gaze. “I suppose one would have to call it”—his eyes lifted toward the end of the table—“faith.”
Sherlock was still a moment, staring at the space John had just occupied as he tried to piece together what was happening. Was John mad at him? Did he think Sherlock had had something to do with that man flirting with him? But surely it had been obvious Sherlock hadn’t had any interest, and John had said unwilling participants. He hadn’t done anything wrong, he hadn’t, and he was all ready to defend himself when John came bursting back in, closing the door behind him before twisting around.
“Oh, for the love of- Let him alone, Irene!” John snapped, the table rattling with the impact of his mug. “If he’s not ready, he’s not ready!”
It started as a chuckle, puffs of mirth bursting up his chest, but quickly grew into the kind of laughter he hadn’t experienced in a long time, the type that made you shake and lift a hand to your mouth to cover your idiotic grin. Evidently, it was contagious, because Sherlock’s low chuckles soon joined him, and he looked down to find the boy laughing down at the table.
“I’ve known him longer than that,” she explained, her voice dipping to a hiss. “He’s in the med program. We’ve had classes together. Not many, mind you; he’s a few years older than me,” she added, shrugging a shoulder, her neck now starting to redden as well.
John sighed, and Sherlock could picture the frail smile in it now. “No,” he breathed. “No, I didn’t.”
“Chemistry, history, and English lit,” she replied, smiling softly as she pulled a green notebook from her backpack. “How about you?”
“I don’t know!” the girl huffed, rolling her eyes as she whipped her arms in a frustrated gesture. “I don’t know, alright?! All I know is that it’s sitting at 65 degrees and dropping, and we don’t have near enough bodies in here to make
“See ya after dinner,” he called, and Sherlock was left at the mercy of Mrs. Hudson and her iron grip.
“Don’t,” Irene interjected icily, a shiver running down Sherlock’s spine at the threat. “We both know you wouldn’t mean it anyway,” she added, slightly softer, but Sherlock still felt shame prickle at his throat, his eyes dropping away. Irene hovered a moment, shifting uncertainly, and then stepped forward, nearly pressing against his side. “Sherlock, are you-”
“No, I- It’s- I don’t mind,” he muttered, and Sherlock blinked just once in surprise before quirking a smug brow.
Sherlock glanced at Molly, lifting his brows in wordless query, and then turned away as she gave him a single nod. “I love thee not, therefore pursue me not. Where is Lysander and fair Hermia? The one I'll slay, the other slayeth me!” Sherlock began, storming across the front of the classroom, Molly hot on his heels in the planned pantomime. “Thou told'st me they were stolen unto this wood; and here am I, and wode within this wood, because I cannot meet my Hermia. Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more!”
The microwaved whirred on in the silence, the steady sound somehow seeming to amplify the tension between them, and John licked his lips, swallowing hard as he struggled for conversation.
Six out of the dozens of hearts had numbers written on them, always the same sets repeating,
“You expected them to leave,” Sherlock offered, and John twitched a grateful nod.
Sherlock grabbed John's hand by the wrist, pulling it away, his other hand untangling from John's fingers to latch onto his hair, pulling him down and leveraging himself up, swallowing John's gasp as their lips collided, because good
John dropped his mouth, and she laughed, their hands disentangling as she went back to her coffee. “You said it was good!”
“I’ll be back in a couple hours,” he said as he started off, still looking a bit wary, and Sherlock smiled, nodding in an attempt to reassure. John’s answering smile was hesitant, but there, and then he was gone, darting across the pitch toward the gathering group.
Two? He had…two?
Sherlock rolled his eyes, the haughtiness of the gesture greatly diminished by the amount of soot in his hair, and John’s lips began to quiver as he removed his goggles, revealing their outline against his powder-blackened skin. “If you would stop bringing me food I didn’t ask- What?”
“Well, I’ve never had any trouble with it,” Sherlock answered, smiling as John laughed, pulling open the back door and waving the taller man ahead of him.
“What’s this?” John asked, lifting Sherlock’s palm to hover a finger over a dark fleck within one of the wounds, and Sherlock swallowed, collecting himself enough to bring the object into focus.
He winced as he heard John shuffle behind him in the doorway. “No, I-I haven’t made any more progress.”
His phone lit up on the table beside his drink, and he glanced over to find Irene’s good morning message scrolling across the screen—because
He had heard Mike and Sherlock come up the stairs at around 9pm, their mingled voices and laughter muffled through the walls before twin doors thumped closed, but John had waited until nearly 10 before venturing out himself, his restless legs longing to wander along with his mind. He’d paced the ballroom window for a time, meandering into the kitchen for a cup of tea, and then retired to the library, starting the fire himself and graduating to scotch, tomorrow now a mere ten minutes away from the creeping hands of the mantel clock.
“It was more than that, wasn’t it?” John asked, feeling terrible he hadn’t heard, but also fairly certain she had said something much longer.
on us!?”
Sherlock blinked, head tilting as he puzzled over John’s face, and then turned away, a vain attempt to hide a smile as he walked ahead onto the fifth floor. “The mobile he used to communicate with his mistress,” he explained, pointing the torch down a narrow aisle between the rows of cubicles. “The number on the account he shared with his wife showed nothing unusual, but a woman at a Vodafone near his building said he’s been coming in to top up a phone for months.”
“You’re a terrible liar,” Sherlock snipped, shaking his head disparagingly.
“Alright.”
“10:12, and immaterial,” Sherlock rebutted, and John turned quickly to the window, biting his bottom lip to keep from snorting. “That’s clearly not the first late night call from jail you’ve received, and the request would’ve been met with bitterness had the previous calls not come from someone for whom you have affection or feel some duty of care, thus the younger sibling, evidently one with a propensity for law-breaking.”
Sherlock frowned in unconvincing confusion. “Of course,” he quite apparently lied, “why wouldn’t I be?”
“But, anyway, he’s
“Why, what are you doing?”
John Watson was new that year, his mother moving into London after a divorce from John’s father, something Sherlock only knew via the air vent in the corridor over the sitting room where his mother gathered with some of the other parents on the music committee. He never faked an injury in PE, was always the first to put his hand up when they were working on science, and was the only student the class rabbit—a small brown spawn of Satan named Cinnamon—would allow to hold her, everyone else getting a truly vicious barrage of kicks to the abdomen for their trouble. His hair sparkled in the sun like straw spun to gold, his irises constantly shifting between glacier ice and just-broken dawn depending on how interesting you were being, and Sherlock had said no more than 20 words to him since the school year had started, most of them wispy and stuttering.
He hadn’t done much research in the day afforded to him before he’d been swept off to foreign climes—or, rather, hadn’t read much of what Molly had provided for him—preferring to get his impressions firsthand so as to form as pure an opinion as possible, but a few bits of advance information had been necessary.
He sat down in the upholstered chair beside her, folding his hands in his lap as he looked around at the pink-plastered room. Or was it mauve? His mother would know.
“That part,” said a voice from behind them, he and John whipping around, “I’m taking the credit for.” Irene Adler leaned against the opposite end of the counter, waggling her fingers at them as she smirked. “Hello, boys! You disappeared awfully early last night,” she chirped with a suggestive flick of her brows, eyes lingering on Sherlock’s sweatshirt he promptly matched the color of.
“Of course, Your Majesty,” he said, smiling as he nodded again. “It is my honor to be chosen to assist you.”
“And you snuck a peek at her bra size while she was finishing the job?”
“Sir!?” she hissed, but Sherlock could only shrug, having seen just as much of this movie as she had and unable to answer any questions.
“Oh, shut up,” John grumbled, crossing his arms and turning away to look out the window as the coach began to move.
“I’m- Nothing,” he muttered, shaking his head as his gaze found John’s again. “I-I’m not doing anything.”
Sherlock stared through his wine glass for a time, tapping the stem with a fingertip as he considered his reply. “I’ve often wondered that myself, ma’am,” he mused, turning his eyes up to her. “I know what I’m looking for, of course, but, to put it into words…” He trailed off, shrugging a shoulder. “No matter how thorough a personality test or algorithm, people have a vested interest in being deceptive in my line of work. Not intentionally—not often, anyway,” he added. “They’re simply trying to put forth the best version of themselves. Which is usually not themselves at all.”
“Victor?” John said, stepping to Sherlock’s side to complete the rather narrow triangle. “The guy I saw-”
“It’s the Superman symbol,” he’d attempted to explain, nodding down at the injury. “The only thing that can hurt him is kryptonite, so I figure his plasters have gotta be the best.” He smiled, bright and bold and genuine, and Sherlock’s tongue was paralyzed, unable to muster a response as John shuffled a step back. “Well, er, I’ll…see ya in class,” he’d muttered, and, though all Sherlock had managed was a nod, John’s answering smile was brilliant as he flicked a hand and darted off to join a group of other children at the swings.
“Well, if he’d kept up his conditioning over the summer,” he muttered bitterly, and Lestrade laughed.
“No, you won’t,” John said, the quiet murder of his tone sending a shiver down even Sherlock’s spine, and he couldn’t blame Victor at all for the visible tremor that ran through his body.
Sherlock leaned forward as John shifted over him, clutching his right hand firmly while wrapping the other arm under his shoulder and across his back.
He was wearing clothes by the time John came out of the bathroom, however, but John might have preferred the sheet, as his boyfriend’s current attire had him stopped dead in the doorway of the kitchen.
“I told you,” Sherlock muttered, shouldering the door open and stepping inside, pushing the wood off his fingertips for John to catch it as he followed, “I’m not paying for any of it.”
Sherlock opened his mouth, a distant memory of an article on the benefits of sleeping on hard surfaces tickling at the edges of his mind, but the pull of exhaustion was stronger, and he sighed, slapping both hands down into John’s and allowing the man to hoist him to his feet. His head swam at the sudden shift, body wobbling, but John’s arm was fast and tight around his waist, guiding them sidelong through the door and down the corridor.
he’s still fighting Nazis.”
Suddenly, the ground beneath him shifted, and he stumbled, his eyes darting down to see the floorboards burning away to ash. Frantic, he lunged forward, diving for the door, but his fingertips fell just short of the handle, and then he was falling, limbs thrashing as he was finally able to scream into the smothering darkness.
.” He blinked benignly at Sherlock as the brunette choked.
to dinner?”
“Here,” John said, lowering himself down to the tile in front of the sink as Sherlock took the cup. “Guess the chip’s weren’t the best idea after all.”
“Wait.”
“No, no, no,” she fussed, swatting her hands at him as she urged him out the door. “You go on. I’ll finish putting your things away.” She paused, a nervous glance passing between him and his open bag. “I mean, if that’s…alright,” she added, eyebrows lifting as she watched him.
He looked down to find John smiling brightly up at him, a clear attempt to diffuse the tension their staring peers were creating, and Sherlock felt a rush of unfamiliar fondness toward him for the gesture. “No,” he replied, his shoulders relaxing somewhat, “sport is…”
“Wait, what?” John attempted to object, but he might as well have been invisible, Molly not turning around, and Irene merely humming thoughtfully as she scanned the overhead menu.
“Found one,” the man said, hurrying to Sherlock’s side, not seeming to notice Sherlock’s distress as his eyes remained fixed on the pattern he had created in front of him. “Oliver Stewart. He was homeless, that’s why he didn’t flag at first. We assumed it was just a fight gone wrong, but if he’s connected to ours, then- Sherlock?” He stopped, the file closing in front of him as he moved up closer, but Sherlock still couldn’t look at him, could barely even hear him through the maelstrom of fear racing through his veins and scrambling his brain. “Sherlock, are you alright?”
Sherlock opened his mouth, but his tongue failed him, lolling around uselessly behind his teeth. Whatever force of god or fate that had thought dropping John Watson into his life would be a good idea had clearly overestimated Sherlock, because all he could manage to do was stay standing and just barely avoid blurting out something ridiculous about how blue John’s eyes were. There was a word for this, a word that had prickled around the edges of his mind for weeks, months even, but he couldn’t bring himself to say it, not even in his mind, because that was the sort of thing you couldn’t come back from, and at least half of Sherlock’s brain was still resolutely certain John was going to call the whole thing off every time he opened his mouth.
“Fair enough. So, what are you up to?” he asked, leaning forward as he lifted his chin to read the open page of Sherlock’s book.
“Sherlock,” John tried to intervene, but the detective was gone, far from the reach of John’s voice, and a wild panic grew in his eyes, driving his words on with quickening cadence.
Blue eyes twinkled hopefully as John looked up, shrugging. “Just people, Sherlock. Some are even asking you to look into stuff for them. I was gonna bring it up soon, actually, because some of them sound pretty interesting.”
John couldn’t help it. He stepped forward, standing at Sherlock’s right shoulder and peering down at the table. His eyebrows furrowed as he looked down at the piles of…crisps?
a date and I sat here texting someone else, what would you think that meant?”
“I-” he started, dropping his chin as he swallowed, and then set his jaw, straightening up as he stepped further into the room. “The bomb squad cleared the package,” he said, and Sherlock blinked, having completely forgotten about the mysterious parcel they’d been en route to the day before, less than 24 hours and a lifetime ago. “No prints, no fibers, nothing,” Lestrade continued, pulling an evidence bag from his pocket and turning it over in his hands. “The entire package was clean. This was the only thing inside.” He extended an arm, the crumpled plastic bag cradled in his palm, and Sherlock stood up, taking the bag from him before walking closer to the window, a sliver of light still striping through the drawn curtains.
“Oh,” Mrs. Hudson murmured, head tilting with a frown, a glint sparking in her eyes and making her look twenty years younger and ten times more dangerous, “so…you’re not married, then?”
“I’m going out,” the dark-skinned man continued, twitching at his earpiece. “Probably grab a takeaway on the way back. You want anything in particular?”
“Oh, no, this is mine,” he said, shaking his head at Irene’s frown. “I mean, obviously, it was John’s
John’s eyes widened momentarily in surprise, and then he smiled. “Good,” he said with a sharp, official nod, turning away and grabbing his mobile off his bed. “Shirts too.”
“Not you too,” Sherlock groaned, leaning back in his chair and tipping his chin up to roll his eyes at the ceiling. “I found him perfectly tolerable; we did not exchange numbers; we do not have plans to see each other again; does that about cover it?”
“I know, I know,” she assured, a faint flush to her cheeks, “but, as an example. If this
“And he convinced me to stay,” Sherlock clarified. “For the week, at least.”
It was impossible to go to public school and not have a cursory familiarity with the sport of fencing, but Sherlock had never seen fit to increase that knowledge, able to recognize the white attire John had donned and little else, left only to assume the various medieval-looking weaponry hanging or encased on the walls between elaborate tapestries would not be involved. A large square mat had been rolled out over the dark wood floor, the contrast of John and three other white-clad figures on the black making it appear as if a game of lifesize chess were about to begin, and Sherlock wondered if there was hope to steer the afternoon activities into that more familiar territory. Hanging by the hilts in a rolling stand at the edge of the mat was a collection of shining foils, the three strangers testing their options with a series of swipes and jabs, muttering to one another about distinctions Sherlock was certain would seem as arbitrary to him as tasting notes in wine.
“Molly,” Sherlock chided, and the brunette chuckled, leaning down to unzip the top of her bag.
Irene blinked up at him, frowning like he’d spoken another language. “What was what?”
to kill people; I was merely acknowledging his originality, and the fact that it will be very difficult to catch him.”
“What did I do wrong?”
“No?” Sherlock inquired, and John shrugged.
Sherlock rolled his eyes with a snarl. “I
“The receipt was on the inside cover.”
John just chuckled, taking the tea Sherlock passed down to him as he perched on the arm of John’s chair, but the detective shook his head, frowning as he blew down into the lid of his takeaway cup.
“Well?” he prompted.
“I don’t wanna talk to you,” Sherlock interrupted, voice cracking like a whip, and John leaned back, holding his breath as he felt himself physically shrinking. Sherlock stepped into the room, the filtered light from the streetlamps outside casting a pale glow on his tortured expression, though his eyes were on the floor between them. “But-” he stammered, throat clicking with a swallow, “but I need to know you’re here.” Slowly, he peered up through his lashes, meeting John’s eyes for only the scantest of seconds, but it was still somehow almost too long for John to bear.
“Did you even
“That’s this evening?” Sherlock asked, not looking up, but his forehead creased.
“Mary!”
They were silent as they walked up the steps, the brothel strangely quiet around them, and Irene waved him into their usual room, closing the wooden door behind her as she followed.
Mary smiled shyly, her fingers tapping against the edge of the table. “You like him, huh?” she murmured, looking up at him through her lashes.
“I’m serious, Sherlock,” she clipped, so like John in that moment, stubborn and unwavering, and, just like he always did when faced with that reaction, Sherlock simply nodded.
“Any flavor shots in that?” he asked, but he could see Sherlock smirking out of the corner of his eye, his face flaming under the stare as he marked the hazelnut addition on the professor’s cup, and he knew, clear as anything, that this was the beginning of his end.
“Shut up,” John scolded, swinging an arm out to swat at him, but he was grinning now, hand falling down to Sherlock’s leg before tangling with his pale fingers. “Hey,” he muttered suddenly, turning to frown down Sherlock’s body, “weren’t you supposed to go to the Yard? Get those files?”
“Would just one of those have been believable to you?”
“John, John, calm down,” Mycroft urged, and John heard himself laughing without any real awareness, a strangled sound of high-pitched hysteria.
A coy hum vibrated through Sherlock’s lips, earning him a tight glare. “Well, I’ll pass your floral compliments along to Molly. I have no head for those sorts of things, I’m afraid,” he added with an apologetic look to Mike, who smiled, shaking his head.
He jumped, embarrassingly so, and turned to see Coach Powles’ large figure approaching. “Yeah, Coach?” he replied, Mike echoing him.
“They are,” Mike insisted, stepping forward as Sherlock made to turn away, damned box still held between them. “The order came in this morning.”
“No, I-I couldn’t,” Sherlock breathed into the vacuum of the room, his own voice frail competition against the roar in his ears.
“SHERLOCK!?” Mycroft exploded in after his agents, his expression downright animalistic in its terror, and Sherlock didn’t know what was more alarming: that, or the jarring degree of realism his hallucinations had obtained. Mycroft’s eyes found him them, scanning briefly over his body for injuries before lunging forward, kneeling to the ground and yanking the table aside. “Sherlock!” he panted, grabbing onto his arms and gently helping him to standing. “Thank god! Are you alright?”
Which just left someone else he’d given cause to dislike him. Which left the entire school.
“How badly did you wanna be doing the singing telegrams, be honest?”
said, but you insist on making me repeat myself-”
“What happened?” she asked, nodding down at the injury, and John looked past her to find Sherlock rolling his eyes.
“Wait,” he bade, and John paused, turning back as the brunette pulled something from his back pocket. “I- Mycroft insisted on having someone stay…with your mother,” he explained, flashing a steady look out through his lashes as John’s throat clamped shut. “She doesn’t know, of course, but, just for added security-” He tapered off, tapping at the screen a few times before passing the phone to John, expression uncertain as his eyes darted between the mobile and John’s face.
“Something like that.” His hand stopped, overlaying Sherlock’s, their fingers loosely slotted together. “Now you tell me something,” he said, nudging Sherlock’s shin with his foot.
“Um, well,” John mused, looking thoughtfully out at the street ahead, “she said something about that being all, and then we stood up and I thanked her for her time—threw in some sycophantic nonsense about it being a pleasure,” he muttered, and Sherlock chuckled, “and then she said the usual ‘of course, no problem’ bit, and then…” He paused, a wrinkle forming between his brows, shadowed by a streetlamp as they walked beneath the yellow light. “She said ‘I’m sure you’ll be hearing from us very soon’,” he concluded, staring ahead a moment longer before nodding to himself, as if confirming his own accuracy, and then looked up, expression turning confused at Sherlock’s grin. “What?” he pressed, smiling perplexedly as Sherlock started to laugh. “What? Why are you laughing? Sherlock!”
Of course, he’d forgotten Molly was behind him.
“Of an ass?” John suggested, smiling as Sherlock sneered.
It was a large room, the walls lined with black-clothed tables displaying cliché colors of drinks and snacks, and there were a handful of high-top tables scattered around the interior, providing a place for smaller groups to gather and not have to hold their drinks. There were flickering candles—LED, John noted—placed haphazardly around the entire space, redundant in the still-fluorescent-lit room, and small bowls of imported candy corn stared up at him from every angle, apparently intent on ruining his appetite on sight alone.
He looked away, this not being the time or place to have that conversation, even if Sherlock was able to figure out what it was, and turned back to Molly, who was hovering awkwardly on the fringes of their discussion.
Sherlock bristled, shifting his shoulders under his coat as he scowled. “Of course I do!” he snapped, chasing his eyes across the section again. “It’s-It’s a film series. About outer space. Wars fought in outer space.”
“A tragedy,” Mary said, Irene glaring at the mock sincerity, but their server arrived before she could give profane voice to the expression.
The neighboring flat door was open, and John wandered inside, heading toward the bathroom.
! There was so much time left, so many people and places still ahead in the vast ever-evolving landscape of life.
Mike was already frowning, searching over the living room before craning his neck back to look up the staircase, but Mary met his eyes briefly, giving him a soft smile before she too turned her attention to scanning the flat. Both of their gazes eventually landed on the cup set out in front of John’s armchair, Mike’s expression instantly shifting to relief, but Mary’s brow furrowed, her head stretching forward on her neck to get a better view of the nonexistent contents.
“Yeah, yeah, fine,” he murmured as he lowered himself to the ground, and he thought he may have heard Sherlock’s low chuckle amidst the final snaps of silver. Another rocket burst into the sky, prompting John to lie back as he followed its progress, head pillowed on his forearm as he bent the limb behind him. “Wow,” he breathed as a large purple plume stretched out above them, tinting the landscape, a shower of red and gold sparks emanating from the center a second later. “How do you get the purple?” he asked, flicking his eyes briefly to where Sherlock was still sitting above him, legs outstretched, arms locked to hold him up as he leaned back.
“You were questioning whether Ms. Jones’ wound could still have been self-inflicted in spite of being on the right side of her head,” Sherlock stated stiffly.
Rob just continued smiling, but the amusement was gone from it now. “No, I suppose not.”
“So, what do you think she’ll know?” John asked, steps hurried next to Sherlock’s mercilessly long strides.
Sherlock gave him a withering look. “John,” he sighed, frustrated, and John laughed, a little wild with relief.
John wasn’t quite prepared for just how much it would affect him, watching this woman,
“You reckon they’re watching?” he murmured, and Sherlock smiled, angling his chin down.
“John?”
“A wall?” John parroted. “What were you doing hitting a wall?”
Sherlock assumed he was leaving, the general reaction speaking to him inspired in people, but then there was a scrape at the tree to his left, and he snapped his head around, finding the boy lowering himself down to the dirt beside him.
John disappeared from his side, dropping his bag and bolting across the hardwood floor until he reached the rug, where he leapt up, spinning in the air to fall onto the bed with a muffled thump.
“Sherlock.”
Devon shook his head dazedly. “That’s- That’s-”
A whistle blew behind them, the three rugby players turning instinctively at the sound to find the team drifting away from their warmups to the sidelines, the game about to begin.
John laughed with that contagious abandon again, compelling Sherlock’s lips to follow. “And, they used to set you up a lot because…” John prompted, and Sherlock bought a few beats of time with a slow sip of his wine.
“Better,” he admitted, tipping his head side-to-side, and they both chuckled before the now-familiar silence descended onto their shoulders once again, but, at least to John, it didn’t feel quite so heavy now.
“Ten minutes,” Sherlock replied, looking to Mycroft again, who quirked his head slightly to the left. “Maybe less,” he added.
“Alright.” Sandra stopped in the doorway, turning around to look at him, her smiled frayed with worry at the edges.
“Mr. Holmes?”
Sherlock closed the door, eyes narrowing toward Mrs. Hudson as he approached. “Did she wake you?” he asked.
“John’s laptop has a keystroke reader,” he hastily explained, tapping through the applications on his phone until he found the hidden file. “I emailed him a virus ages ago. Wanted to test it out.”
“Love?” he mimicked with a scoff. “No. That’d be even more absurd than the dying alone bit.”
- mentioned that he had mentioned the Halloween party to me last week; caused John to do that thing with his jaw that always means I’m going to be getting a lecture
“Is it like wool or something?” the boy continued, lifting one side to scan over the drape.
“I’ll go get Victor for you. Jim,” he added as an afterthought, and, as the man beamed at him, Moran couldn’t help but feel being Jim Moriarty’s friend wasn’t unlike making a deal with the devil.
If Sherlock hadn’t been putting all of his effort into restraining himself from shouting at the man every time he pulled or prodded or twisted something that made John wince, he may have found it funny, John blustering on about being perfectly alright while periodically hissing in discomfort. As it was, he didn’t even so much as smile, let alone speak, and merely watched on in silence until the EMT left, ordering John to stay there and keep the blanket tight. He watched the EMT as he retreated out of sight, knowing what was coming.
A massive castle stood on the hillside, the beige-gray stone and slanted navy roof seeming carved from the mountain itself, innumerable windows glittering in the afternoon sun to wink down at the village below.
!?” He roared, pushing up on the mattress and snapping to sitting, glaring down at John’s wide eyes. “I don’t need this...this...
“Oh!”
It was too late to do much of anything but drink and go clubbing—neither of which he, let alone Sherlock, was inclined to do—but John so wanted to get out of the flat, even just to walk down to the 24-hour Tesco and get junk food they didn’t need. He was opening his mouth to say as much when the doorbell rang throughout the building, and they turned to one another, confused.
“You got help,” John continued, something Sherlock dimly registered as bitterness edging his tone. “That’s all that matters.” Pain tugged at the skin around John’s eyes, but Sherlock knew now was not the time to ask where the sympathy toward addiction was coming from. It wasn’t personal, certainly, but it was definitely there.
“Shh!” Sherlock hissed, interrupting John’s protest, but John’s indignant retort was cut short by a voice behind him.
“How would you know, I was awake before you,” John snapped back, and then some of the anger unwrinkled from his face as he realized what he might have revealed, but there was no way Sherlock could
my first party,” Sherlock snapped.
John’s mouth just sat slack, eyes focused somewhere around the embroidery over Sherlock’s heart. “What?” he wheezed, and then lifted a fist to cover a quick cough. “No, you-you can’t. I’m not having my rugby jacket hung up in a closet that would probably light up like Guy Fawkes Day under a blacklight.”
They did not speak, just held one another tightly a moment, Sherlock and Clara both shuffling a bit to give them some space. When they broke apart, John’s arms returned to his sides, but Harry’s lingered a moment, hovering at his shoulders.
John closed his eyes, gently resting his skull on the headboard and tilting toward the ceiling as carefully as he could without jostling his sleeping roommate, because this must be a dream, and, if he just went back to sleep, he would wake up being completely straight again. Because that made total sense. John sighed as quietly as he could while still letting out his frustration. He wasn’t gay, he was still sure of that, at least. He had never been attracted to men, not in the slightest, but Sherlock wasn’t exactly a man, was he? He was something…more, something transcendent, something that defied any construct or label. He was like one of those galaxies he didn’t care to hear about on the Discovery Channel, a spiral of energy perpetually spinning in on itself, too far away to touch, to ever truly understand.
John blinked, Sherlock was nearly bending his fork as he glared, and Mrs. Hudson looked just as confused as John for a moment until she straightened up, eyes and mouth stretching wide as she looked between the three of them.
With Mrs. Hudson gone, the air rapidly grew thick again, but John couldn’t quite be sure how much of that was genuine tension, and how much of it was his own private discomfort.
“Close your eyes.”
“I do trust you!”
“Now, now, Sherlock,” Mycroft sighed, tapping his umbrella against the carpet as he traversed the room, dropping the brace onto a side table as he went. “It is hardly remiss for me to be concerned when I hear you’ve been involved in a shooting at Scotland Yard.”
“She is quite impressive,” Sherlock said honestly enough, nodding to himself. “Very accomplished.”
Anderson blinked at him, lowering his camera in front of his chest. “Seriously?” he breathed, and though Sherlock
“Process of elimination,” John suggested with a playful shrug.
John was dying, he was sure of it. Something—probably an icepick, but he couldn’t rule out an axe—had lodged itself in his head, and someone was clearly still pounding on the back of it to drive the point all the way through to his eyeballs.
John frowned up at the side of Sherlock’s face, the moonlight setting his pale skin in stark relief against the backdrop of the night. “Wait, are you- You’re saying you think someone snuck into her window to drop a hair dryer into her bath?”
John glanced up through his lashes. “I should hope so,” he muttered, tapping his papers into some semblance of a stack. “It’s my job.” He started away down the corridor, and Sherlock rolled his eyes at his back, making a note not to try
Sherlock laughed again, shaking his head across at mirror-John’s morose expression. “Don’t give her any ideas,” he chuckled before giving John a nudge with his elbow, bobbing his head toward the door.
“Preferably not,” Sherlock snapped, pulling at the collar of John’s jacket, “as your usual tends to involve wasting a lot of my time before getting to the point.”
She rolled her eyes again. “Yes, but you didn’t
phone,” John replied as if it were obvious, his forehead furrowing in confusion.
“Didn’t come up,” she mumbled around the sugary orb, Sherlock rolling his eyes while Molly laughed. “We’ll find someone better for him anyway.”
“By getting you sloshed?”
“What are you giving him? Maybe he just doesn’t like it.”
The wireless part was true. The data plan…
“Of course,” Harry replied over a frail chuckle. “I mean, you practically
Sherlock’s mouth floundered for a moment around a series of choked-off sounds before his eyes flittered away and he swallowed. “I had thought it was obvious,” he snipped, but this was too important, too heavy to leave with a mutter and a glare, the answer too significant for John to translate it himself this time.
know I only drank half the can,” John muttered, shaking his head in disbelief.
“And you’re going to help me, are you?” Sherlock asked, and John could picture his mocking smile from the smug lilt of his voice. “Why? Why should I trust you? Why should I even
In other news, this chapter is quite long, and the one after it will be long too, so there might not be a update tomorrow in order to give me time to get that next one up to snuff.
“The world can’t handle one of me.”
John waited, blinking unseeing down at the pages, and then lifted his eyes, realizing Sherlock had fallen silent. “What?” he asked, finding Sherlock looking down at him with raised brows.
John chuckled, but his eyes remained far away. “Well, tea is very serious business,” he joked, smiling distractedly again, and then turning his head away toward the window, leaving Sherlock blinking confusedly at the side of his face.
The man puffed a laugh. “I’m John.” He stretched out a hand, ironically wrapped in a striped fingerless glove. “John Watson. I volunteer at the shelter.”
“John,” Harry interjected, and John fell silent, Sherlock’s fingers freezing on his mobile screen as he failed in stopping himself from listening. “You don’t have to tell me, but don’t expect me to believe she had some miraculous epiphany either.”
“No,” he barked, and Sherlock started, alarmed at the veracity of the man’s tone. Lestrade’s eyes were flashing, not quite with threat, but with an intense sort of urgency Sherlock was far too scattered to parse out at the moment, and the sergeant shook his head, leaning back into the car where he already stood outside his door. “Stay here; we don’t know what this is yet. Mycroft’s gonna take you home, and I’ll be by later to-”
Sherlock scoffed, pushing his hands into his pockets as he looked pointedly past John’s shoulder.
Dimmock nodded, and John watched him write about two words to all of Sherlock’s.
The blond moved away, and it was then Sherlock turned, taking in the girl as she approached. She had auburn hair—a bit stringy, if you asked him—and a spatter of freckles over her pale face. Her eyes were a pale blue/green, and sparkling happily as she wrapped her arms around John’s shoulders.
Once again, however, there was no one, and he tentatively opened the page, blinking in alarm down at the familiar lines, this time printed off a computer in simple black type.
The red light of the provided alarm clock shone a scarlet wash over the room, reflecting off the polished and glass surfaces and illuminating a stretched version of John’s profile on the wall to his left. Turning away from the light source, he stared at the wall, watching the rise and fall of his own shadow’s side as he breathed. Gradually, the rhythm slowed, and his breaths evened out to match the time signature of Sherlock’s violin drifting up through the floor.
John turned to him, shocked to see the man doing anything even
Sherlock chuckled, shaking his head around a slurp, sloshing the water around in his mouth before leaning forward and spitting into the toilet, too tired to be embarrassed. “Don’t think it would’ve mattered,” he admitted, taking a proper drink before leaning back against the tub, adjusting to place the cool surface on the bare back of his neck. “I drank...so much,” he groaned, eyes closing with a wince as John laughed. “So much.”
“What?!” Sherlock spluttered, rounding on his friend, who was grinning with stunned delight. “No! I- These are different clothes!”
“Do you know what a phoenix is, Seb?” Jim interjected, and Moran blinked, watching the immobile sliver of the man’s sharp face.
Sherlock couldn’t stop shaking his head, his hands waving outstretched before him, echoing the denial as he tried to push himself into the wall, through the wall, popping out the other side and away from questions he couldn’t answer. His mouth was metallic, nausea roaring violently in his stomach, and he was dizzy with the circles his brain was running, going over and over the same rhetoric that had kept him sane, kept him safe.
“Hero-worship!?” John exclaimed through a rage-fueled laugh. “
Leaving straightening the corners to Mrs. Watson, he crossed to the closet, double-checking that he’d removed all of his clothes from the boxes, his fingers running over the familiar folds of fabric. He’d been skeptical whether even the combined force of Mrs. Watson and Mrs. Hudson would be enough to convince his father not to put up a fight about him moving out, let alone letting them take some of his things, but he’d never make that mistake again, the women returning with the entirety of his room crammed into cardboard boxes in the back of Mrs. Watson’s car, as well as smiling assurances that his father would not be causing trouble for them anymore. Naturally, Sherlock and John had, in perfect unison, asked if they’d killed him, but, apparently, they’d only been “very persuasive”. Either way, Sherlock had made a mental note to never get on the bad side of either of them, although he doubted that was likely to happen even if he tried, considering the tearful welcome he’d received at both the Watson household and 221B.
Sherlock snorted, taking the phone from his tan fingers, warm static leaping from where they brushed. “It doesn’t look hard at all,” he muttered, scrolling down the truly horrendously long list. “We sit on the floor and eat sweets.”
Sherlock hummed affirmatively, and then they fell quiet, Sherlock’s rhythmic tapping of the eraser against the floor the only sound in the silence that was steadily growing awkward.
Greg was already outside when he arrived, rubbing his hands together against the cold as he waited beside the valet stand. He lifted one of those hands when he saw Sherlock approaching, waving it in the air, his whole body seeming to shake with the effort, and Sherlock couldn’t help but smile to himself, Greg’s enthusiasm unavoidably contagious. “They’re just pulling the car around,” he explained, waving a hand toward the circle drive, and Sherlock nodded, adjusting his scarf to cover his chin.
- mentioned half-term break was coming up; caused John to become upset
Still, no one moved apart from their eyes darting around to avoid meeting one another, John just about to break and put an end to the shortest acquaintance and longest farewell of his life when Sherlock’s voice cut off the thought.
“Why would I need you?” Sherlock spat before he could think better of it, a familiar flare of fury making yet another sudden and irrepressible appearance.
“Who said I’m going to her place?” John challenged, but did unfold his legs from the chair, placing his feet on the floor and empty cup on the table. “And how do you even know where her place
“Yeah, for the play,” she explained, Molly coughing pointedly from where she was cleaning the espresso machine behind him. “We’re all in it. Well, not
Sherlock blinked at him, growing more and more puzzled with every shift of his eyes between John’s hand and face. “I- You still want me to come?” he asked, and John tilted his head.
“Oh?” he inquired, getting, if possible, more embarrassed at the strangled sound of his voice. “What subject?”
“No, I’m not saying- It’s just, isn’t that a little…significant?” he muttered, blushing furiously, a condition only made work as John lifted a teasing brow.
“Hmm?” Sherlock hummed, leaning back against the table beside John’s seat.
John glared at the door, letting his arm collapse to his side, a few strands of grass falling from the jersey with the motion. He watched them flutter to the grey bathmat, turning his palm up as he considered the uniform in his hand. With a wicked smirk, he quickly balled it, clenching it in his left hand as he jerked the door open with his right. Rugby-passing accuracy put to possibly the best use yet, John shot the shirt across the room, hitting Sherlock square in the face as he twisted his chair at the sudden reentrance.
He closed his eyes, his head dropping as he fought the lump in his throat. This didn’t happen to him. He didn’t do this, especially not in front of other
“Are you sure you’re alright?” he pressed, and Sherlock finally settled his mask firmly into place.
!” Sherlock retorted, childishly holding the tool aloft.
“Mrs. Hudson!”
Mycroft raised an eyebrow. “Kent?” he asked, tapping his handful of papers on the cherry wood to straighten their edges. “What could you possibly have to do in Kent?”
“Have anything for a romantic dinner for two?” he asked, pulling his blue shell suitcase from the carousel and plopping it down next to his feet, Molly’s face a beacon of pink when he looked up.
“You think this was some sort of
“Nothing,” he muttered, twisting back to the whiteboard as he continued writing. “As I was saying, today we’ll be talking about the thalidomide tragedy to further our understanding of optical isomers. I’m sure you all read the article in your book, but I printed off a few supplementary materials as well.” He moved to his desk, lifting a stack of white paper off his desk, and then crossed to the edge of the room, counting out pages as he distributed small piles at the end of each row.
“Right, right, sorry,” John interrupted, lifting a hand to halt his argument. “
“Go to sleep, Sherlock,” John interjected, not unkind, but not up for discussion either, and, with a sigh, Sherlock tucked his head back into John’s chest, counting the beats of his heart until John brushed a kiss against his hair and distracted him.
Sherlock blinked at him a moment, and then dropped his eyes to the grass between them, nodding at the flattened brown blades. “My mum died,” he said, and it was the first time he had, the first time anyone had, and, though he couldn’t quite understand why it came out beneath this tree to a stranger, it felt right somehow, like a weight he hadn’t known was hanging from his heart was suddenly cut free.
Sherlock dropped down onto the cool leather, leaning over his knees as he kneaded circles into his right temple. “Mike doesn’t have a clue,” he muttered, Mycroft nodding at the expected, “but Mary and Molly are suspicious. And Dimmock needs a raise,” he added, and Mycroft huffed a laugh, John smiling down at the hardwood as he shifted his weight between his feet. “Other than that, everything appears-” He broke off with a hiss, jerking his hand away from his head to see he’d somehow reopened the cut, a shallow river of blood winding its way down the delta of lines on his palm. Cursing under his breath, he made to get up, intending to go to the bathroom to fix the wound up properly, but his head swam as he started to rise, and he collapsed back into the sofa cushions, blinking blearily at the spinning living room John was suddenly no longer in.
“I- Nothing,” John replied, shaking his head as he dared a step closer. “I mean, nothing in particular, I just- I just wanna know what you’re thinking.”
“I’m just saying-”
“She’s not a client,” Sherlock growled, rather tipping his hand, and John beamed. “I’m not jealous!” he spat, moving forward again, but John kept pace at his side.
“Yeah, I always find my food’s better when I pick up a takeaway rather than having it delivered,” John said, and Sherlock laughed, John’s mouth straining at the corners as he grinned along. “But, yeah, I’d-I’d like to come along,” he continued, pulling the conversation back in line. “If- I mean, if you don’t mind.”
What was he going to say?
Slowly, he lifted a hand to his cheek, swiping across the tear-slick skin, and then blinked back up to his brother, a sob steadily climbing up his throat. “Mycroft?” he whimpered, unsure what he was asking, or how many things he was asking at once, but, regardless, his brother didn’t seem to have an answer, his expression crumpling with pain as he lifted a hand to the back of Sherlock’s head, pulling him in to his chest.
mad at me,” he urged, hands stabbing through the air. “I mean, what!? What do you want me to do!?” John was still shouting, but there was no anger left in his face, no frustration in his voice. He stared up at Sherlock, desperation laid bare in his bloodshot eyes, and Sherlock had to look away, swallowing hard as he turned his face toward the bedroom door. “Sherlock,” John whispered, shuffling closer across the hardwood. “Sherlock, please, just- Just tell me what to do.”
“Mhmm,” Sherlock hummed, and John could tell he wasn’t listening, probably hardly even knew there was another person in the room.
What was he supposed to
John was back in a moment, sitting on the edge of the bed beside Sherlock. He took the ice again, wrapping it quickly in a towel before gently pressing the bundle to the back of Sherlock’s head. “Hold it there for a while, yeah?” he advised, the ice clicking together as it shifted against Sherlock’s skull beneath his fingers.
“Where, then?” Molly asked as Sherlock picked up the page, stretching his fingers as he pushed it open to read the hastily scribbled words.
“The pirate?”
Greg sighed, dropping his head as he ground his fingers into his forehead. Muttering to himself, he turned around and headed back into the office, passing John where he stood frozen and dumbfounded in the foyer.
“I-” he began, and then looked up, drawn by the rising volume of Sherlock’s voice.
Sherlock forced a smiled, clearing his throat around the lump lodged there. “No,” he said, blinking down at the rippling black surface of his drink, “though there might be one less cabbie willing to pick you up.”
“Well, if you didn’t pour three different chemicals in at once-”
A beat of John’s heart wandered off, a stiff swallow clicking down his throat. His chuckle was a touch too shrill. “Aren’t I supposed to be lying on a couch when you do this?” he teased, but Sherlock didn’t so much as glance at the misdirect, a frown wrinkling the space between his brows as he leaned forward over his knees.
“Cheers.”
“I’ve got time,” he answered, holding Sherlock’s gaze as it searched him, a small smile flirting with the edges of the man’s mouth before he launched full-tilt into the narrative, his hands rolling and slicing through the air as he talked, the cuffs of John’s jacket riding farther up his forearms all the while, but, if Sherlock didn’t notice he was still wearing it, John wasn’t going to bring it up.
They went up several floors, weaving around from escalator to escalator, John pointing things out all the while. He seemed particularly enamored with the employees who were demonstrating products, excitedly twisting Sherlock this way and that as he waved toward the whirling helicopters and “magic” hovering balls spinning with lights and glitter. Sherlock, for his part, didn’t look at the products more than enough to be able to make an appropriate comment of acknowledgement, but the smile never left his face regardless, a permanent quirk of his lips pressed into place by John’s rabid joy.
“Greg!” John shouted again, stepping forward, but the only person who heeded him was Sherlock, turning from his work to scan John’s face with a curious frown. “Mycroft!”
out loud while Sherlock pretended to be looking over his data sheets, but his eyes had long-stopped moving across his notes. He grinned back at Molly when she smiled at him, giving him a nod heavy with meaning, and tried incredibly hard
“Even better!” John chirped. “Always like to know they’re going to a good home. Why don’t you fill out that section and I’ll make the calls while you finish.”
laughing at?” he spat, cheeks pink, and John shook his head, lifting his hands in pleading.
“Yeah, I suppose it might have looked a little weird,” he murmured, and then slowed, his heels kicking at the snow. “Do you- Does it bother you?” he questioned, shooting up a sidelong glance. “Hiding it? I mean, I- If it did, we-”
“What, when?” John blurted, and Sherlock gave him a withering look.
“A burglarizing teenager.”
Welp, it's a cliffhanger again, but the next bit got a lot longer than I expected, and I didn't want to make you wait that long. Enjoy a whole lot of my only daughter: the incomparable, illustrious, sometimes inappropriate Irene Adler.
get Sherlock to so much as hint at taking ballet. The man seemed to have changed his practice hours in order to spend time with John during his shift, making claiming to have spotted him anew out of the question, so John had instead gently pried as to how the man had come to live with Mrs. Hudson, but the detective had changed the subject, muttering something about her being lonely before asking John about a crossword clue. He’d asked what he was doing this weekend, knowing full well he would be occupied with the spring arts celebration, but Sherlock had only said he was busy, citing his chemistry project, but shaking his head when John had offered to come by yet again.
Mycroft stepped forward, his face shrouded in darkness, but Sherlock could read the purpose in the set of his shoulders, and swallowed to steel himself, forcing his body into a sitting position.
long time…
John didn’t say anything, but his hands slowed in their movements, the heartbeat Sherlock could feel across his cheek stuttering a moment. “Okay,” John agreed, nodding against Sherlock’s forehead, and Sherlock’s fingers hooked firmer into his jumper as he steeled himself.
John was quiet behind him, Sherlock shuffling at paper inside the desk to avoid turning around. “You have to act like I’m dead,” he finally said, though the words were barely more than a whisper. “Like you- Like you’re lying about it all.”
“To answer
it is. There is a post up there right now with the song and lyrics to "I'm Your Man", which is referenced in this chapter, and later today or tomorrow I will be putting up a Teenlock playlist inspired by this fic, so be on the lookout for that. I'll link it into the next chapter though, if you just wanna wait.
“I didn’t want to lie to you, Sherlock,” he murmured, and Sherlock’s hand clenched, his fingers leaving imprints on the bread. “Every day, I- But it was the only way,” he urged, shaking his head helplessly as he moved forward another step, but Sherlock only scoffed, wrenching off a strip of crust and whipping it into the water.
“No,” John hastened, earnestly shaking his head. “No, I-I want to.”
“Seriously?” John muttered, lifting his brows at the man. “You do realize you just set me up for one of those corny ‘I’m not most people’ lines, right?”
A second later, he was spinning, twisted around and pushed backward to collide heavily with the closet door, but he didn’t even get time to gasp properly before John was atop him again, tongue pushing past his teeth as it swirled against his own. Sherlock pressed back, albeit a bit less skillfully, his mind somewhere a little further south, but John didn’t seem to mind, hand sliding in a slow firm press down Sherlock’s side.
“Yes, she loved her room. But I told her, if she changes her mind, there’s plenty of room up at the castle.”
“Don’t be. You were tired.” He shrugged, disappearing into the kitchen. “You just have the one exam today, right?”
“It was only the second story,” he argued, Sherlock’s eyes narrowing in disapproval. “And I landed on a hedge.”
They talked on the way to the restaurant, or, rather, Mike and John did, Sherlock listening long enough to declare it immaterial and gazing out the window instead.
“Like...you need a bucket?” he asked, but John shook his head, though only fractionally.
“You boys ready for supper?” she asked, smiling between them as she wiped her hands with a dish towel. “Meatloaf and potatoes. And I chopped the onions finer this time,” she added with a wink to Sherlock, who felt all his blood rush to his face.

While Sherlock had escaped Irene for a time, one never could hope to entirely evade her, even if they didn’t have a class with her later that day. Of course, Sherlock did, and, as Irene walked into the chemistry lab, eyes piercing as they locked onto where he stood by the window, he wondered if he might have been better to leave the running until after the final bell had rung.
Mary chuckled, dropping her eyes to her shoes as they progressed down the stairs.
John’s lips were cold and chapped, his probably no better, but they warmed quickly enough, John tilting his head and twisting his hold in Sherlock’s hair in that way that always sent a shiver up his spine, and his throat decided to whimper entirely on its own.
John jerked a thumb to his left, indicating Sherlock, and Devon’s eyes passed between them with that same, curious expression. This time, however, John noticed. “You two gonna flip for the bed?”
Sherlock rolled his eyes, the effect no doubt diminished by the shudder that ran through his body as an icy drop of condensation snaked down his neck. “Believe it or not, I managed to work that much out for myself,” he said tonelessly, and John sneered good-naturedly at him. “No, I was referring to the title you gave the Gravin case, ‘Winged Cupid Painted Red’.”
He settled on black, but not his most formal black, that one preserved for the ball, and paired it with a dark purple shirt, somewhat inspired by his accommodations, he supposed. The soft curls of his brown hair had dried a little more haphazard than normal in the drier, thinner air, and he grabbed a bit of some hair cream Molly had recommended and then just bought for him, taming the ends as best he could. After holding up several options, he settled on a thin black tie with just a touch of sheen to it and simple silver cufflinks, needing to exude confidence without crossing into showy, misdirection the mark of an insecure man. He was just slipping his dress socks into his polished black wingtips when there was a delicate knock on the door, Sherlock stepping toward it before realizing he’d never locked it, feeling a faint rush of panic at the near-miss of being in his robe earlier before calling, “Come in.”
“Aren’t you supposed to be acting like John?”
. I’d like to know how you
“I’ll clean the loos for a month!”
“Sherlock!”
“Well, of course you are!” he chimed, Sherlock matching his approach with another retreat. “Me!”
John felt a rush of air pass across his neck, and Mr. Tyson’s gaze flicked in his direction. John hadn’t thought a sigh could be a facial expression until he watched the tired resignation pass across the man’s features.
“I don’t
“Ben’s fine,” he said, and Sherlock nodded, stepping down the line for the next introduction.
“Trauma?” Sherlock repeated, incredulous even as the rage that had been simmering just below the surface for hours started to hiss steam through the growing cracks in his facade. “Trauma is car accidents and bank robberies, not people being
“Wha-What did you say?” Sherlock breathed, lungs not seeming to have the oxygen for full-bodied words in spite of the fact that he was borderline hyperventilating.
A laugh drifted back to them, John looking up to see Molly swatting playfully at Greg’s arm. “Yeah,” he mused, smiling as he nodded at the spectacle, “I think I know what you mean.”
and help us tailor-make the experience as much as possible.
“Jeans?” he manage to murmur.
“Sherlock?” he said softly, peering around the door.
Something was being implied, something about those two bedrooms in the upstairs flat, something involving him. Was he supposed to stay there? During uni, maybe? After? But two, why would he need two bedrooms?
“As if you’ve got any room to talk,” she snapped, bobbing her head at the room over their shoulders, and they turned, realizing with identical wide-eyed looks of horror that their combined bed was in plain view. “So,” Harry quipped, lifting a smug brow as she folded her arms, “which one of you sleeps in the wet spot?”
“Unlikely,” he muttered, smiling when John sighed, “but I can.”
John grinned, pushing off the bed and snatching his jacket, not even bothering to lock the door behind him as he grabbed his phone and ran down the corridor after the beckoning voice.
John shook his head, smirking, and Sherlock glared at him a moment before sighing exasperatedly.
“I’m sorry,” John muttered hurriedly, tugging at his shoelaces now, unable to meet Sherlock’s eyes for this part. “I- I shouldn’t have yelled.” He didn’t dare look up to see what Sherlock was doing until he heard a soft sigh.
“I have to,” John urged, matching Sherlock’s retreat with a forward step, even as his face looked physically pained with the effort. “I
“Lock it?” Sherlock finished, giving the keys a single toss before pocketing them. “Of course I did. I’m you, remember?”
“What the hell…”
“I was...scared,” he whispered, shaking his head in wonder, as if still coming to terms with it himself. “I thought—and not just with you, I mean, I
he doesn’t like me?”
“I never
John had answers to that question, answers Sherlock already had, had already explained, but they weren’t the answers he really wanted, wouldn’t answer the question he was really asking, so John didn’t offer anything at all, just looked back at Sherlock as a tear broke loose from the man’s grey eyes, his hand lifting automatically to smear it away with a thumb. “I’m sorry,” he whispered, sliding his hand further back over Sherlock’s jaw, formality forgotten. “I’m sorry,” he heard again, feeling his lips move, but having no control over what they formed, his focus fixed on lifting his other hand to push a curl off Sherlock’s forehead, combing it back into the others as Sherlock’s eyelids fluttered closed, tears still leaking out from the stitches of his lashes. “I’m so sor-”
“Fine,” Irene muttered, flicking a hand in the air, “I wrote their information on graph paper, but-”
“-he’s been a bit gun-shy,” she concluded, looking back at him with a pitying grimace that Irene matched.
?” he parroted. “You
“Thank you, sweetheart. Now, hurry up.” She hooked her arm through her husband’s, locking him to her and guiding them back toward the crowd. “If we don’t greet them soon, it’ll seem like a slight.”
“You did?” John said, coughing as he croaked, propping himself up on an arm. “What happened? Who was it?”
“Look, I- I’m not good at this sort of thing either, okay?” he continued, voice quivering, a self-deprecating smile twitching at his mouth. “But I-I feel like we have a couple choices here.”
“Oh, sorry,” John said, dropping his gaze. “I’d forgotten. I’ll-I’ll get it to you right after lunch, sir.” He smiled apologetically, nodding in promise.
Sherlock beamed, leaping down from the chair and following after him. “With chocolate chips?” he gushed, and Mycroft laughed, throwing his head back as he swung open the painted white door.
“The Bart’s thing then?” John continued to guess, and Sherlock could hear his own heart in his ears. “Because I didn’t think that was a secret. I mean, you told Mrs. Hudson and Mycroft.”
Sherlock chuckled, pinching his thumbnail between his teeth a moment before responding, his heart gradually rising to lodge at the base of his throat.
“You’re not moving out?”
“Cold?” John asked, propping himself up onto his elbows.
“How the hell do you-”
Together, they supported the limping boy’s weight, the remainder of the team hissing with concern as they followed. Taylor let out a pained yelp as they gently deposited him on the bench, the school medic pushing through their group to his side a moment later.
I'm stealing the notes again for my own purposes, sorry. Just a reminder to you all to expect slightly less frequent updates for a little while because of all the craziness detailed in the previous chapter's notes, and to thank you for the overwhelming amount of support and encouragement I have received. If I'm being honest, I thought I'd get a bit of hate for not updating as quickly (and that has happened to me in the past) but you have all sent me nothing but well-wishes, and I'm really quite touched. Four for you, Teenlock fans! Four for you!
“Sherlock.”
“Really?” He checked his watch, less than half an hour left to choke down some semblance of lunch. “Why?”
“Sherlock?” John prompted, and the man sighed, scraping his teeth over his lip as he twisted his hands together in front of him.
“With chips?”
had that come from!?
“But, if you were,” John barreled on, lifting a placating hand, and Sherlock folded his arms, glowering across at him, “you wouldn’t have to be.” He smiled softly, and Sherlock’s glare slowly faded, eyes dropping to his lap as he self-consciously twisted his fingers at the hem of his jeans. “I mean, yeah, I have friends at school,” John continued, scratching at the back of his neck as he shrugged, “but they’re not- I don’t- None of them are my
,” he added as John failed to suppress a wince. “Not in the way you think. I was curious
If it hadn’t been exactly what Sherlock wanted to see, it would have been embarrassing to watch. Even Molly was blushing slightly, looking down at the table and biting her lip.
“You want anything?” he asked as Sherlock hit the lift button, leaving it ringed in red.
“If it’s what the queen wants,” Mike chimed in, stepping forward, “he will do it, absolutely.”
“They’re mutually exclusive?”
them, have you?” John asked, eyes actually damp with mirth, and Sherlock ought to have been even more furious, but instead felt a strange sense of pride. “You probably don’t know who that actually is.” He waved a hand at the black-cloaked figure, prompting Sherlock to turn around.
“So, I suppose it’s obvious, but you two are each other, right?” he asked, pointing between them.
“Where are they?” John demanded, emboldened by the lack of argument.
!” he whined, Sherlock’s grin broad as he chuckled. “Who knew being shot at was such a workout?”
*****************************
“Sherlock, please,” he begged, and it might have worked if Sherlock wasn’t already decided, might have tugged on his heartstrings if there were any left unbroken. “I know Mycroft will have people following you and everything, but- Well, they can’t plan for everything; they can’t watch everyone. It’s safer in here.”
Irene swung open the door, dressed uncharacteristically—in that she was dressed at all—in blue jeans and a white jumper, and, the second her eyes alighted on Sherlock, passing over the empty air on either side of him, her face snapped into a scowl. “You haven’t told him,” she said, and Sherlock considered feigning ignorance for all of half a second before he realized it was a lost cause, Irene’s eyes glinting with knowing.
He looked around the room as he made for an exit, tall enough already to scan over most of the “adult’s” heads. Had John left him here? Left him to rot in this detritus that passed as the police force? No, that’s something he would do, not John. So then, where was he?
“I- I call,” he countered, and John sniffed.
“Wait, what?” Émile spluttered. “You did not tell me that!”
“Clear!” a loud voice interrupted, following swiftly by a more familiar one.
Lestrade was probably one more 3am text message short of killing him himself, Moriarty be damned, but Sherlock could hardly help it, having to share every potential lead the second it came to him. When he reached the point of having them break down the components of the glue on the ends of the laces of Carl Powers’ trainers, however, even he had to admit he was getting desperate, and the hidden contents of his desk were growing more and more tempting every day, seeming every bit the light at the end of this ever-darkening tunnel.
John chuckled again as he stood, and Sherlock tried not to beam too inappropriately as the thrill of the sound rushed through him again. “Maybe tomorrow,” he said, bending his elbows back as he stretched. “Right now, I think I just need to sleep.”
“The least you can-” Sherlock started, frowning at the woman as she turned to face him, and then caught sight of a second figure leaning against the brick wall behind her, everything suddenly falling into place.
“He always does, dear,” Mrs. Hudson sighed, popping the rest of her coke bottle into her mouth. “He always does.”
Mary lowered the play to her lap, smiling eagerly. “That was really good,” she chirped, and John huffed a sharp laugh.
John huffed in weak amusement, dropping his head for a moment. “No, nothing like that. I guess I just thought… Ya know how people say they can see evil? Like there’s just something about a person that they know is off, even if they can’t quite put their finger on it?”
Sherlock nodded, not bothering with the feigned smile, the man’s back already turned, and then listened to his heavy footsteps bound down the stairs, the door banging shut behind him. Moving to the window, he watched Lyle’s back retreat down the street, the man giving a friendly wave in at Speedy’s as he passed, the owner kindly offering the occasional free coffee to the “workers”.
, I misread…something, so I’m just gonna—”
“Oh, well, in that case, please”—he waved a hand toward the bedroom door, which was cracked just enough to see a shadow moving beyond—“don’t let me interrupt.”
“Okay.”
John didn’t take it out, just went back to staring down at the page, his head slowly beginning to shake. “Why?” he finally asked, barely a whisper as he looked up. “Why did you- I applied other places. You-You didn’t have to-”
“-from that time your picture was on the main page of the school website for a month.”
John smiled, elbowing Sherlock on the arm. “Maybe it’ll have that effect on you too.”
He was tall, Sherlock noted as he stood, what little black hair he had left slicked back on his pale skull and a sharpened smile peeling over stained teeth. “Your Highness,” he said, even his words somehow greasy as his swept his hands out in an elaborate bow. “How wonderful to see you again.”
“She went to bed at 1am,” Sherlock said, standing up again as he folded his hands behind his back. “Just like she said. I suggest you take urine and blood samples; I think you’ll find she’s been drugged.”
It happened, as most life-altering things do, on an entirely unremarkable day.
Sherlock blinked, momentarily alarmed, and then simply frowned, tilting his head at her. “You can’t drive,” he countered, and Harry’s mouth dropped open, the girl just beginning to shake her head at him as John drew up beside them.
Lifting his chin, he looked around, finding himself abandoned by the company he hadn’t wanted, and frowned, pulling out an earbud in some paranoid notion of missing an early warning siren.
“Nature of the job, I’m afraid. Though he can get a bit…carried away.”
“Because,” he began, wriggling his right hand into the leather, “the bathroom window was open, and the hair dryer in question was practically an antique, meaning there was no ground fault circuit interrupter built into the cord.”
“Sherlock,” John cautioned, just the slightest expense of breath, but Sherlock could not stop, could not allow what he had known was the entire reason for Taylor’s approach to happen to the designated target.
With that, they left, leaving he and Molly alone in the kitchen, the brunette silently staring at him even after the front door closed behind the trio, and Sherlock’s hands curled and uncurled with entirely authentic discomfort.
know. And I think you’ve known for a while.” Her blue eyes bored into him, unmoving in their knowing, and John swallowed down the knot of panic rising in his throat.
Sherlock merely nodded, rolling his eyes.

Instantly, the voices downstairs fell silent, and John winced, imagining he could hear Chopin’s funeral march playing as he descended the steps, trying to avoid the squeaky spots. The door into the living room was ajar, offering a slim peek of the room beyond, John’s view stretching just far enough to see a single socked foot resting on the carpet in front of where he knew Sherlock’s chair would be, and he sucked in a steeling breath, closing his eyes as he blew it out and pushed open the door.
“I was wondering if you’d show up,” she said, red lips curving up in a smile that immediately set Sherlock on edge. “John was starting to get restless. And Kate owes me ten quid.”
“John, I’m not a
“Yes,” he said brightly as he climbed in after. “Just wait til New Year’s. I plan to hire an assassin.”
Sherlock’s palm dropped a few inches, fingertips curling as a breath hitched on his lips.
Mrs. Hudson chuckled, and then her forehead creased, eyes panning up and down. “You must be freezing in those old things,” she fussed, waving a hand over the borrowed ensemble. “These windows are
“Mr. Holmes,” the man crooned, reaching past John to take Sherlock’s hand, his palms clammy. “Lord Chaplin. An honor to meet you, truly. I read your interview in
“Ah, fuck!” the blond hissed, dropping the hot toast onto a waiting plate as he swatted his hand in the air, and Sherlock bit his lip to hold back a snort, not quite ready to give up the appearance of cursing the ground John walked on, but it was probably ruined a second later anyway as John turned around with a start. “Jesus!” he spluttered, blowing out a breath as he pressed a hand to his sternum. “I didn’t hear you get up.”
,” he added, wrinkling his nose in distaste at the word, and Sherlock chuckled, lifting his face.
John nodded again. “I know.”
John Watson smiled, a fragile thing that seemed to expect to be broken, his hands lifting from the pockets of his navy suit as a swallowed bobbed down his throat. “Hey,” he breathed, a whisper Sherlock more read from his lips than heard, and he stepped forward, dismissing the porter with a nod.
“Dammit, Sherlock, will you take this seriously!?”
Sherlock winced and took a half-step back toward his lab, eyes fixed on the ground.
“Undergrad interviews,” he explained. “They kind of take over the place afterwards. We have a hard time keeping up.”
“Well, I’ll, er- I’ll leave ya to it,” he muttered, clearing his throat as he waved a hand down between Sherlock and his coffee, and then beat a hasty retreat, disappearing back toward the counter.
John shook his head as Sherlock trailed away, opening his mouth to reassure him it was fine just as Irene appeared between them, slinging her arms around their shoulders.
“Oh?” the woman inquired, tilting her head as she stepped to the threshold once again. “Where do you work?”
Tension rippled through John’s limbs, his arm tightening around Sherlock’s waist, and Sherlock summoned all his restraint to move slowly, sliding his palm up to rest over John’s hammering heart, because this wasn’t last night, wasn’t a clumsy thing born from pain and desperation, it was a
John was standing just inside, fingers still wrapped around the handle as he hesitated, expression unreadable, and Sherlock couldn’t do it any longer, the shaky scaffolding holding him aloft finally giving way, and he crumbled into the sea with a gust of a sob.
“This is a ‘real case’, Victor,” Sherlock spat back, prompting the blond to roll his eyes. “It’s going to trial next week. That woman accused of killing her stock-broker husband.”
It had been three weeks since Valentine’s Day—which was the only way John would ever refer to that evening, everything else far too awkward—and, for all the time they’d taken crawling along in their relationship, they had no problem sprinting now. Oddly enough, it was Sherlock who seemed most eager, tackling each new step with the same shrewd focus normally reserved for his cases, but John wouldn’t say he minded. That’s not quite the way he would word it, at any rate, but it was no secret that he was struggling with things more than Sherlock was, although not on his own part. He was worried about Sherlock, worried about pushing him, about applying pressure in some unconscious way, and he knew it was driving Sherlock mad, the man actually offering to sign an affidavit if it would mean John would let him finally reciprocate a hand job, and that was just far too embarrassing for John to say no to. That was as far as they’d gone, however, but John knew it was only a matter of time, Sherlock never one to be content where there were still variables to explore, and, true to form, the boy wasn’t wasting any time, shuffling down John’s boxers and uniform trousers to take his cock in his palm.
“But it was nice paper,” he crooned, grinning as he lifted his face. “Really smooth finish.”
Sherlock let the awkward moment go, shrugging a single shoulder. “If you are. Mrs. Hudson will likely be awhile yet.”
John blinked at her, utterly perplexed, but, luckily, it was exeunt time. “I will, my Hermia,” he said stiffly, brow furrowing even further as Mary sighed in contentment. “Helena, adieu: As you on him, Demetrius dote on you,” he concluded to Molly, who smiled at him before he was dragged across the makeshift stage by Mary, their part of the presentation concluded.
“Ya know, if you wanna tell me,” he mumbled with an awkward shrug. “I-I don’t need to know, really.”
In the time since Victor and him had broken up, dating and relationships had been the furthest thing from Sherlock’s mind, his hatred for Valentine’s Day cemented in the following two he’d gone through comfortably alone. He had assumed he had evolved past such base feelings and desires—attraction, companionship, romance—and none of the men he’d encountered since had given him any reason to question that assertion.
Nothing appeared out of place, but John was sure something was missing, scanning the cluttered tables and shelves with a hazy nagging at the back of his mind, and then a voice drifted up the stairs to his left, his eyes shooting wide as the previous night crashed over him like a bucket of ice water.
After several minutes, he started typing, the words coming in rushes and lulls at first, and then flowing, a steady stream of recalled details. He got up at one point to lock the door, a habit he was trying to set for himself in spite of the unlikelihood of intruders all the way down here, and fetched a notebook and pencil from his backpack to jot down the things he thought of before he got to that point in the narrative. Before he knew it, the door handle was rattling, and he started, snapping his laptop shut as he leapt from the bed.
“I beg to differ, Inspector,” he pronounced, tugging his jumper down before rattling his arms into the sleeves of the long coat Sergeant Donovan had thrust at him. “If you start doing your job, I’ll be able to stop cleaning up your mess.” He smirked, the corner of his lopsided lips drawing up like the point of a knife. “Gentlemen,” he bade, nodding at Lestrade and the sprinkling of officers still loitering around the foyer. “Donovan,” he added flatly, and was sweeping away before she could reply, turning his collar up to dance against his jaw as the bulk of the coat billowed out behind him.
his words creeping over him, like clammy hands pushing him aside and grappling at Sherlock. “We had so much in
“I suppose we can stop by and pick up the books,” he conceded, his stubborn pride still intact, but there was something about the smile John gave him that suggested he knew Sherlock wouldn’t dare rush out as simple as that.
John just smiled back, stretching up on his toes to tap a brief kiss to Sherlock’s mouth, one of his few sentimental gestures. “Text me?” he asked, grinning brightly as Sherlock nodded. “And don’t be too late,” he said over his shoulder as he snatched up his bag, opening the door and stepping out into the corridor, “or I’ll have to call Mycroft to scramble the jets. Or whatever it is he does.”
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed as he tilted his head. “Is that so surprising?”
Mycroft and Lestrade both glanced at John, a mixture of pity and encouragement wrapped up in their weak smiles and creased brows.
“New hire. And he asked her—”
“What?”
me. Don’t misunderstand me, Sherlock, I’m not on your side,” she said, draping herself back in the chair. “I’m on mine. My best interest is my only interest, and, right now, helping you is the best way to help myself. So”—she quirked an eyebrow at him, foot tapping aimlessly in the air where her legs were crossed—“do you want to know who you’re up against or not?”
“Ah, over then.” Irene sighed with faux commiseration, shaking her head at the ground. “Oh well.” She shrugged, pressing her spine back into the chair and draping her arms over the armrests. “Plenty more fish in the sea, as they say. You know, I have a friend—well, I say friend—who recently got out of a relationship, and she’s always had a bit of a
“What?” Sherlock drawled, shrugging his shoulders, the small movement drawing John’s attention to the flashing silver cuffs around his wrists. “Was it something I said?”
see you again,” he paused, trying to force the threat of his words through his eyes, “I will kill you. Without hesitation, without mercy, and without leaving anything large enough to identify your corpse, is that understood?”
Sherlock nodded, watching as his mud-caked roommate retreated toward the locker room. Tugging his coat tighter around him, he turned, heading out between the stands. A crack of a twig to his left made him stop, and a second’s worth of deductions had him closing his eyes, steeling himself against the brittle rage that curdled his blood.
A flip of a lid later, there was a low whistle behind him, and Sherlock watched over his shoulder as John wriggled the silver watch from its case, darting his gaze back to the suitcase before the blond could catch his eyes.
“I- I suppose so,” Sherlock muttered, his narrowed eyes still disconcertingly scanning John.
“Sherlock, stop,” he tried again, breaking their lips apart as he pushed at the man, but, once again, Sherlock ignored him, his hand sliding further and further down until his palm skimmed John’s belt buckle. “Sherlock!” John cried, planting his hands and shoving hard at the brunette’s shoulders, rattling him back far enough for John to escape to the side, nearly toppling over the ledge of the bathtub as he retreated. “Stop! What are you-“ He stopped, anger faltering as he finally got a clear look at the boy’s face.
you,” he answered, not daring to even blink—at least, not until Mary did, “but he won’t be able to call. Used up all his minutes for the month talking to his mum and sister after the explosion.”
He leaned his head back, hitting against the metal table leg with a heavy thunk, and the mournful vibrato shook down to his core. He was doomed, he knew that much. Doomed to light touches and brief brushes and haunted daydreams of more. Doomed to watch and see and
John sighed, turning to trudge after Sherlock into what turned out to be the kitchen. It was simple enough, with adequate cupboard space and a glittering, glass, blue and green backsplash that looked freshly installed. A long, wooden table took up the majority of the room, lit by an overhanging fluorescent light which glinted off the beakers that still remained on the surface, no doubt remnants of a past experiment.
“Really?” he pressed, trying not to look too relived when John nodded. “I thought- Molly said you were taking requests.”
“No, please,” Mycroft interjected, straightening his jacket with a flick as he stood. “Come in, Mr. Watson.”
“Sherlock,” John tried again, regaining his higher brain functions, but the detective twisted away from his reaching grip and began to pace, hands waving erratically.
“You could always set up a PIN code.”
“The one Lestrade asked me to look into.”
“Perhaps, with updated equipment-”
“Thanks for coming,” John said softly.
. A small, disgusted sound spat from his throat. He was
Sherlock glared at him, the startled thundering of his heart fading into a steady thrum of fury. He’d tried to get John back all night, drifting in and out of vivid nightmares as the looping voicemail played out darkness and heralded dawn, but he’d never reappeared. Not until now, anyway, and seemingly only to tell him off. “What do you know?” Sherlock snapped, and John chuckled as he pushed free of the doorframe, sidling into the room.
Sherlock waited, watching as Harry swallowed, her eyes momentarily dropping to where her fingers twisted in front of her.
“Yeah,” he muttered, just skimming a snarl, “I saw it. Nice setup you’ve got there.” He waved a hand, an airy sort of gesture that somehow only made him look more dangerous as he ambled along the bottom of the bed. “Didn’t even know there
Sherlock shook his head. “No, it’s not,” he chuckled, and John sighed, dropping his head in resignation as he climbed up the mattress to flop down next to Sherlock.
The man had pulled a black ring box from his pocket, his hand still draped over it as he spoke to the shocked woman across the table, and then he stretched out his arm, sliding the closed case over the tablecloth to rest in front of her plate.
“Er, yes,” Greg muttered, rocking his heels back into the carpet as he cleared his throat, “you see, I was under the impression that the queen would be informing the prince of your arrival before you…arrived.” He rolled a hand at Sherlock to indicate the obviousness of that sailed ship. “But, it would seem I was…misinformed.”
“Sherlock,” Kavi said, calling his attention back. He patted the hardwood beside him, his smile broad and glinting with charm. “Join us. It’s a little chilly, but you get used to it.”
“Sherlock!”
. “Let me give you some advice. Stay away from Sherlock Holmes. Get out, and fast.” She took a half step forward, leaning into him. “While you still can,” she added ominously, her eyes burning her point into him.
Sherlock snorted, a frail façade that wouldn’t even have fooled Anderson, let alone John. “That’s ridiculous,” he dismissed, rattling his head as he looked away to the wall. “You must have been hearing things.”
“Shut up,” Mary snipped, swatting at his side, and John grinned down at her, chuckling as she blushed. “So, what about you?” she asked, bobbing her head toward the tall brunette. “How long’s it been?”
Mike just nodded, a small smile toying with his mouth.
John lifted his eyebrows, but did nothing else, not rising to the obvious goading.
Sherlock’s mind scrambled to find something to do, something to say, somewhere to hide, but John was already there at his shoulder, Sherlock’s window of opportunity closed now that his dulled senses had failed to identify his approach.
“No, I just…had a few things to finish up,” Sherlock replied, forcing a smile, but he could see Irene’s brow rising in his peripheral vision.
John awoke rather roughly to the sound of a book slapping to the floor, his mind swirling with that usual mixture of fear and confusion that comes with waking up somewhere new. A familiar smell drifted in with his deep, waking inhale, and his nerves immediately began to ease, even before his mind caught up to identify the scent. Opening his eyes, he blinked rain-scented, dark curls into focus, and then lifted his head warily to survey the scene.
John’s lips clapped closed, a tense swallow moving down his throat. “I-I don’t-”
- Sherlock!” he cried, but the call went unheeded, Sherlock disappearing through a door near the end of the hallway without so much as a backward glance.
Sherlock popped open his mouth to protest, but John crossed his arms, eyebrows lifting in a smug dare, and the gesture prompted Sherlock’s throat to malfunction, words evaporating into a garbled wheeze.
“Exactly!” Sherlock exclaimed gleefully, turning back to John as he reached the top of the flight. “We could name it something abhorrent like Fluffy or Snowball or Oreo.”
“Hmm,” John hummed, entirely oblivious, and it still hurt, even after all this time, to know he was perpetually breaking that unquestioning trust. “Well, I suppose finding a mole in the department would make him a little paranoid,” he said, quirking a shoulder as he moved across the room.
“Well, I should hope not!” she urged, crossing her arms as she smirked. “So, what’s 24 in bisexual years?”
“So that would make you the clinical psychologist,” John said, and Irene blinked, looking wrong-footed for a moment before laughing, nodding in defeat. “I already know Mary is studying medicine”—he pointed at her and then steepled his fingers, tapping the point to his chin as he looked between Sherlock, Molly, and Greg—“and you said ‘they all,’ so I assume you weren’t included”—he dipped his fingers toward Greg, who nodded in confirmation—“so I’m going with…Molly for medicine undergrad.”
!?” John bleated, moving to his shoulder, so Sherlock turned his back, catching the shaft of light that was Mrs. Hudson’s door opening in the corner of his eye. “Moriarty probably has people watching the flat!”
,” Lestrade replied off-handedly, but then his voice turned more fervent. “Don’t tell him I told you, though. And don’t get him a present; he hates presents.”
“Hiya!” The man stretched a hand back to close the door as he moved to meet John in the corridor. “Sorry, is this your room? Must’ve got turned around. I’m looking for someone. Sherlock Holmes?”
Sherlock’s father chuckled, a throaty sound John had no way of knowing was disingenuous, but the hair on the back of Sherlock’s neck lifted in warning. “That would certainly be unwise,” he agreed, and Sherlock slid off the bed, stepping between them.
Which is where John will find it after they graduate, unpacking the box labelled “bedroom” when they move into 221B Baker Street. He’ll insist it fell out when he was putting it up on a shelf in their closet, but Sherlock will know better, and stubbornly suggest he might need to move into the downstairs bedroom after all if his privacy is going to continue to be invaded.
Lifting his face to the mirror, he watched the water run down his cheeks, small independent rivers he smothered with a towel, and he held his own eyes in the glass, fingers gripping the edge of the counter on either side of the sink as he breathed a slow steadying breath. Watching the shift of determination in his own gaze, he nodded to his reflection, straightening up and striding out the door, decided that, just this once, he was tired of thinking.
The door swung into a short corridor with high ceilings, a long narrow table stretching along the wall with a blown glass bowl for keys and a tall vase filled with fresh flowers displayed on the surface. A large mirror hung over it, set in an elaborate gold frame that might have looked ostentatious if not for the bathroom it reflected, and Sherlock popped his head around the doorframe, gaping side to side. It was a full bath, which was surprising enough, but it appeared sculpted from a block of marble, black and gray swirls covering the floor, shower stall, and the top of the vanity. The only thing, apart from the toilet, that wasn’t marble was a deep clawfoot tub set against the wall, Sherlock’s travel-weary muscles begging him to reconsider his “baths are for toddlers and dogs” stance. He caught his own wide eyes in the bathroom mirror, and schooled his expression into something more dignified, stepping back into the corridor and continuing into the main bedroom area, where his jaw promptly plummeted through the floor.
“Two months!?” John spluttered, eyes widening at the man sitting inside his transparent prison. “How does he
Sherlock did not reply, firmly exercising his rights against self-incrimination, but Ben seemed to guess, a long sigh drawing out of him.
; it’s- I-” He snarled, a sudden fit of irritation that sent John startling back, and then flung his head back into his hands, panting down at the floor.
Mycroft shrugged, leaning back in his chair as he crossed his legs with an airy wave. “No particular reason,” he muttered, and John focused intently on the syrup pooling in the golden divots as he felt the beginnings of the tension sparking off of Sherlock.
“Father? No, parents wouldn’t seek revenge, not when the dealers are so young themselves. Brother, perhaps. Older, definitely older. Younger brother? Sister? Impossible to say; I’ll need them all.” He was muttering to himself, pulling his phone- Wait.
“With Lestrade,” he reminded, shifting his weight between his feet, “but yeah.”
He had known it was coming, of course, had mentally prepared himself for days, but now, driving up to the gates of Langley on that dreaded Sunday afternoon, John found himself seized with a terror he didn’t have words to explain.
“Apology accepted,” he chirped, reaching through the railing to clap him on the shoulder, and John chuckled, watching the man as he moved toward the front door. “I was just about to run to Tesco,” he said, hand hovering on the doorknob. “You guys need anything upstairs?”
John’s eyebrows twitched in surprised bewilderment. “I-spy,” he repeated, as if that would make it any clearer. “You’ve never played I-spy?”
For a second, it stung, a twinge of rejection flitting sharp and cold across his chest, but he beat it back, reminding himself that John didn’t mean it that way, wasn’t doing it for that reason, and, tentatively, he pressed against the set limit.
John turned his hands up in the air in a helpless gesture, and then mumbled in a vaguely rhythmic sort of way. “I’ll take your hat, your hair looks swell.”
“As much I would enjoy dining with you all for the remainder of the afternoon,” John said, making a spectacle of turning his watch on his wrist, “I’m afraid duty never stops calling.”
Devon laughed, and Sherlock flicked a small smile at him reflexively.
and help us tailor-make the experience as much as possible.
“I-I’m tired,” he muttered, wincing as his head swam with vertigo. “I think I should-”
Sherlock looked genuinely confused for a moment, as if he thought John might be looking forward to an engaging conversation with the microscopes, and then flushed through a whole spectrum of reds, the entire reaction sweeping all the competition away for most adorable thing John had ever seen, and his previous girlfriend had had a fondness for YouTube cat videos. “I-I-” he started to stammer, but their attention was drawn away by a noise inside the flat, slaps of what sounded to be slippers along with a muffled voice.
“You should go check your mailbox,” she said, leaning down as she dropped her voice to a conspiratorial stage whisper. “I’m pretty sure someone dropped a special surprise in there for you.” She winked at him, and then grinned, her eyes sparkling as they poked through her wispy fringe, but Sherlock only lifted a brow.
“Mr. Holmes?”
Sherlock shrugged against the mattress, the shift of his shoulders lifting his hands to brush John’s, and he left them there, stretching the digits to rest the ridges of his fingerprints against John’s knuckles. “I don’t know. Something about you.”
“Of course,” John answered, “and, you know…your opinion… Well, it’s not always entirely useless.”
“An oldie, but a goodie,” Mary acknowledged, and Greg dipped a bow over his empty plate.
John held his gaze a moment, and then a corner of his mouth twitched, followed quickly by a shrug, and, a second later, they were all laughing, uncaring for the sharp glances of strangers as they wiled away the dreary afternoon behind the café glass.
. He wasn’t worthy, and if, in the end, he turned out to be just a pit stop on the path of John’s life, the tacky tourist trap giant ball of yarn or transportation museum where John stretched his legs before moving on to bigger and better things, well, he’d count himself lucky to even get that close. And, as he’d tried to tell John countless times, he really would be better off without Sherlock. Everyone else seemed to come to that conclusion, anyway.
His lips snapped shut, and Molly laughed, tossing a triumphant smile over her shoulder as he blinked.
obvious—Sherlock pulled out his mobile, taking a moment to compose what he hoped would be an interest-piquing text.
“God, you’re clingy,” John teased, and he heard Mike huff faintly on the other end of the line. ”Just a sec,” he said, locating the folder and awkwardly flipping it open onto his lap one-handed. “I’m in Kingsley. You?”
“Are-Are you sure?” he pressed. “Because, I mean, we can just forget I said it. Well,
“Really?” John muttered flatly. “He ‘insisted’ on giving you the room
last year was smaller.”
“Wait, you broke into his flat?!” John interjected, light drooping as his arm shifted in surprise, and Sherlock dropped his hands from the door, turning around with a frustrated huff.
“It varies,” she replied. “Sometimes it’s 20, sometimes it’s closer to a hundred, but 50 or so is about average.”
“People come in for a series of interviews and personality tests, and we run algorithms on their social media. We feed all of that into our system, along with our personal notes and recommendations, and”—he shrugged, bag bouncing against his side—“see who matches up.”
“Look, Irene, I don’t know what to tell you; they said they couldn’t get the posters done until Thursday.”
look at him now, “and I- Well, I want you to be…happy. Or, at least, as close as you get,” he murmured, and Sherlock chuckled, the jest easing the tension somewhat. Lestrade moved forward, pushing into the corner of Sherlock’s eye, and Sherlock turned a sidelong glance to find the sergeant smiling gently down at him. “I’m proud of you, kid,” he asserted, and Sherlock needed John here to explain the lump growing at the base of his throat. “You’ve come a long way. And John-”
Molly huffed through her nose with amusement, rolling her head to smile up at him. “Sherlock, I’ve known you since primary school,” she said tenderly, and that was all she said.
“It was late, and we got hungry, so we found the closest place still open and got takeaway. From that Chinese restaurant.”
“What?” he muttered, stroking two fingers down the side of her snout. “I can’t look?”
“Night, Sh’lock,” he murmured back, a low chuckle the last sound he heard before sleep swept him away.
Sherlock smiled, bright and mischievous, and John was returning it and walking back toward him before he was even aware of wanting to.
The bark was cool and rough through his jumper, a crisp whisper of wind tugging red leaves down in a shower of sparks, and Sherlock shivered, plucking one off the page of his textbook and wishing he’d thought to layer.
Mary made a sound of disgust, rolling her eyes to the ceiling as her tongue protruded past her teeth, and John laughed.
“No,” he nearly squeaked, mind concocting a list of every horrible possibility, bile rising all the while.
she’s not telling us, and I need all the information I can get.”
He chuckled, looking up once again to the group of wannabe crooners, and then the smile slipped from his face, eyes beginning to dart around.
to break up with her,’ Sherlock had challenged, and John had turned away, running a hand through his gnarled hair. ‘What’s the point in having rules if following them makes you miserable?’
“Why?” Sherlock asked, pulling his coat off and practically tossing it onto a hook. “Wouldn’t we stage the scene if we were pretending he was still alive?”
He hadn’t truly watched much of the show after that, answering Sherlock’s few questions from the memory provided by multiple re-watches already, and had instead been focusing on regulating his breathing, on not giving anything away. He had at least vaguely come to terms with the fact that he was attracted to Sherlock, that he could find another man aesthetically pleasing, but feelings? Feelings were another thing entirely, a dangerous, deep, dark thing that beckoned to him in his dreams at night with conjured images of what could have happened if he’d just angled his head a little down, brought Sherlock’s chin a little up. He had wanted so,
John snapped his head up with a glare, but Sherlock merely smirked and bobbed his head to encourage him to continue.
People leaving never hurt if you didn’t care.
“No,” John said, rolling his head with exasperation as he moved closer. “The other ones. Astronaut? Fireman?”
“Do you want any help?” John asked, both because he did feel like a bit of a freeloader crashing the Holmes and Hudson Christmas, and also because he didn’t think he could stand just sitting around the manor all day.
“I should-”
John narrowed his eyes, a look he hoped conveyed a stern reminder it was about to be Sherlock’s turn at this, and then turned once again to Mary.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Only technically,” Sherlock countered, shrugging a shoulder. “He’d already been stalking me for months.”
‘This won’t end well, Sherlock,’ he urged, softening his tone, but not Sherlock’s defenses. ‘You’re making a huge mistake.’
“Sir Lestrade,” the one who appeared to be in charge greeted, bowing slightly as Greg stepped out, and Molly whipped her head over her shoulder.
team!?” Sally gasped. “As what? The mascot?”
The work is all that matters.
“Most people prefer them. At least until they get comfortable with the process.”
“I want an Irish coffee.”
“First time for everything,” he quipped, and Sherlock’s mouth snapped shut.
Sherlock’s fingers tightened slightly on the edges of his book, but his face remained impassable. “I’ve had ample opportunities to attend parties; I’ve just never found the idea of watching people descend into even further idiocy with the combination of alcohol and moronic music appealing,” he muttered, perfectly aloof.
John blinked, dumbstruck, and yet, somewhere in the back of his mind, he supposed he had known this was coming. There was a reason he hadn’t thought to get her a present. “Mary, I- I
“To know I’m not a dentist?” John quipped, and Sherlock chuckled, shaking his head.
“John!” Mycroft barked from the doorway. “It won’t matter that the dishes are clean if they walk in and see you
“I can-”
“Not that I would’ve done anything differently,” he snipped, and the prince opened his mouth, stepping forward to reply, but seemed to think better of it at the last moment, pressing his lips tight and looking back to the queen.
“Oh, for the love of-”
Sherlock considered calling the whole thing off, but even he could see that was childishly spiteful, so he searched, scanning the coach and motion-blurred windows. “I spy”—he paused, eliminating the eye prepositional phrase entirely—“someone who is currently breaking up with their girlfriend via text.”
“Oh,” John muttered, not knowing quite what to do with himself. Another glance around the living room revealed a plate of sandwiches sitting atop a couple stacks of books on what was probably supposed to be the dining table, considering the one in the logical place—the kitchen—was overtaken by science. “Mrs. Hudson left us food,” John said, grabbing the glass plate and reading the scrawled, black writing on the paper wrappers. “One roast beef and one ham. You have a preference?”
I be acting? In your
Sherlock blushed somehow deeper, and the anger followed suit. “It isn’t
Moran’s jaw twitched, and he barely managed not to gulp as he nodded.
“Oh, yes,” John chuckled, nodding deeply. “Yes, indeed. I probably won’t continue at uni. Keep all my teeth and whatnot.”
“The prince will come around,” Mike assured, smiling at Sherlock’s climbing brow. “He just…takes a while to warm up to things. And he’s never appreciated being told what to do.”
“The blue one stays, Reggie,” Greg was saying, pointing toward the boot of the car as yet another man—Reggie, apparently—began unloading the luggage. “And I don’t need the car checked either, if it’s okay staying here a few minutes. I’m just going to run in and get Molly settled.”
carefully, Victor,” Sherlock growled, proud of the wince that passed across the dealer’s face. “If I
“This way,” she beckoned, nodding as she began to climb the steps, and Sherlock rolled his eyes at the exaggerated swagger of her hips.
“What did Mycroft tell you to do?” Sherlock interjected, impatience sharpening his tone, and John swallowed, continuing with a barebones approach.
“It’s not enough.” John shook his head, pulling a folder of photographs from the bottom of the pile in front of him. “You’ve all seen the same pictures I have. Modernizing the existing facilities to the level required would be a complete tear-down, and, at that point, it amounts to the same thing.” He tossed through the plastic sheets of photos, Sherlock squinting but unable to clearly make anything out. “We
to keep this from you?” Mycroft demanded “That I
It wasn’t often Sherlock needed to be introspective, that he needed to stop and examine his motivations. When he lied, he lied, decisively and unashamedly, but this… It felt ugly, like a sickness growing inside him, creeping stealthily over his internal organs, and it
About half an hour later, the ring of a gong interrupted their merriment, the four of them looking between one another in mutual befuddlement before turning to the source of the sound.
“It’s-It’s nothing, I-I just- When I was in secondary school—like, early secondary school, I was 13—I sort of- There was this…boy,” he murmured, grimacing up at John as he curled his shoulders protectively, “Seb Wilkes, and he-he was on the rugby team, and we- Well, we weren’t exactly- Nothing ever
Sherlock huffed a laugh, shaking his head as he dropped his hand away from it. “Okay,” he replied, lifting his hands in a gesture of surrender, and her glower cautiously waned. “I’m sorry. Won’t happen again.”
John fluttered his eyes away, watching his thumbs twisting into his cuffs.
John brushed at Sherlock’s jaw with the bridge of his nose as he moved his head back up. “It’s okay,” he whispered, sounding just as destroyed, and then dropped his chin, placing a suddenly tender kiss to the corner of Sherlock’s mouth. “It’s okay,” he repeated, words brushing against Sherlock’s bottom lip, and Sherlock broke, shattered, pieces of him flying out like shrapnel as he came.
“What’s the play?” Devon asked earnestly, and the rest of them formed a tight circle of anxious silence as they waited for his response, and John realized with a fluttering jolt that he was effectively acting-Captain for the moment.
What did his sister know about picking out cologne, anyway? It could be a notoriously awful brand, or one of those scents that immediately conjured up images of linoleum floors and shuffleboard; John would never know the difference. If he’d been around, John would’ve asked Mike, but, alas, he’d tried on all three pairs of his jeans and four jumpers by himself before picking something and hoping for the best, spraying on a regrettable finishing touch of the cologne Harry had gotten him for Christmas just before rushing out the door.
