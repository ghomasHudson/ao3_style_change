, Tony was going to
just sex with me."
"Yeah, Shellhead, I got you, baby," Steve murmured, coaxing his mouth open with his fingertips. "Now just relax and let me do all the work." And Tony wanted to whine
—Steve was dripping with sweat, his hair clinging to his forehead and his face twisted up in despair, but perhaps the most surprising thing of all was the positively
, and Tony tried to shrink away but Steve held him tight.
"I know, I know, big boy, they're your colors," Tony whispered hotly, nipping at the side of Steve's throat. "God bless America," he murmured, and this time Steve was laughing, pressing kisses to Tony's face as he slid the ramp under Tony's chest and hips, and
"Y-you said-" Tony stuttered out, thighs trembling as Steve began to crook his fingers in, "y-you said that you'd b-be able to-"
Even the thought of it made Tony flush.
, he hissed at himself. "Cancel one of your dates. We'll box."
"Yes, well, I'll still be more comfortable once we wash this stuff off us," Tony said, inspecting one gauntlet surreptitiously. There wasn't a way he could really wipe any of it off, not before they got into decon and hosed down, but it didn't mean he was happy to be running around in the stuff.
"Fair enough," Tony whispered, and let himself sink into the bath. He turned onto his side, the water swirling gently with him. "Could you help me out with this then, darling?" he asked over his shoulder, let his lashes flutter shut under the warmth and exhaustion weighing on him.
Well, Tony had mastered the art of burning his life down around him. Maybe Steve needed to learn a thing or two about how good the fire felt as your life came crumbling down.
He’d given Tony a look when they entered for the first time since the remodel, but hadn’t asked him if he was responsible, so Tony took it as an acceptance of his peace offering, so to speak.
Team. That was a joke.
Tony tenderly stroked the creamy background, the paper courser than he’d imagined. He was careful not to smudge any of the charcoal, lest he mar something so perfect.
Steve’s hands trembled slightly as he reached for the book. He couldn’t believe Tony had forgotten it, but he hadn’t been acting at all like himself at the time. He’d clearly been too preoccupied on getting away from Steve.
Tony had his fair share of practice with kissing. Most of it good, some of it great, a few regrettable experiences too. He could tell Steve was inexperienced. He lacked the finesse and calm that Tony had perfected over the years. But god, he made up for it with intensity. He kissed Tony like his very life depended on showing just how badly he wanted, no, needed him. There was something unrestrained in the way he grasped onto Tony’s hip and shoulder, as if desperate to find a way to show him how badly he needed him. It left Tony breathless, knowing that Steve could become that unraveled because of him. Well, and it didn’t help that Tony had hardly come up for air since Steve had first initiated the kiss.
Steve,
That made Steve’s blood boil. He was poor, yes, but his mama had raised him with manners and he had come fully prepared to offer to pay for Tony’s meal in addition to his own. He told Tony as much, his hands shaking as he gripped onto the cheap laminated menu.
I always thought myself a smart man, not the brightest, but I could get by. And then I met you. And you dazzled me. Your greatest weapon always was your mind, Tony. And I’m realizing more and more each day what an idiot I am.
The last sentence made Tony’s eyes flutter open. They were clouded and hazy. Tony nuzzled into Steve’s neck, seeking out comfort after taking his punishment patiently. And Steve loved the gentle mewling sound Tony made as he caressed him.
Steve frowned. Tony had always been a little obsessive when it came to his work. Okay, a lot. But usually it in went in cycles. He’d stay up for a few days on a quest to perfect whatever his current project was, and then they wouldn’t see him for a day or two while he slept off the exhaustion.
Tony eased back into his chair, let his heartbeat calm a bit, and then gratefully accepted the coffee. Steve had slid it across the table to him, knowing he was uncomfortable being handed things. It was yet another way Steve showed he paid attention. The other Avengers forgot half the time, and Tony was pretty sure Clint intentionally found reasons to hand him things just to fuck with him. But Steve was always careful to set things down and slide them to him, every single time. It was one of the numerous reasons he had fallen for Steve, not that he’d ever admit to it.
There weren’t many times he felt uncertain, but this was definitely one of them.
He managed to catch Tony’s eye when he’d wandered into the kitchen to grab lunch. He gave a friendly wave and a nod. Tony looked weary, but offered a small smile in return. It made Steve feel a glimmer of hope that he hadn’t completely ruined things. Tony had smiled a little brighter when he noticed the book in Steve’s hands.
Basically, Steve’s mind was a super computer that had just missed a few updates along the way. But it pained Tony to know that Steve was floundering when it came to things like the self checkout at the grocery store, so he’d started offering to help him, to teach him things. At first Steve had politely declined, said he was getting along just fine. But Tony kept offering, and eventually Steve started accepting his help.
Steve had to sip his juice to hide the smile forming again on his lips. “What kind of project?” He had never been very good at keeping a straight face, and now was no different.
Tony shook his head, trying to jar the distracting thoughts from his mind. He settled into his workshop and cleared space to start working. But they lingered in the back of his thoughts, right next to the idle debate about what to have for lunch, and how to approach studying the xenofluid. He was good at compartmentalizing. Probably too good for his own benefit. He could tuck that thrilling set of mental images away for now. They could always be revisited later, he reasoned. Now just wasn’t the time for those kinds of ideas. He had work to do.
Friendly concern, that’s all it was.
“Tony’s fine. He has his phases, but he gets over them,” Sam reassured.
I’m gonna try this again. Call it a rough draft. Maybe I’ll clean this up and actually get it sent your way. How do you even mail a letter to a superhuman fugitive? If anyone could figure it out it would be me.
He needed Tony on his side. Needed his brilliant mind and creative problem solving. But Steve wished he didn’t have to worry about Tony’s ability to keep himself alive, let alone thrive.
By the time the food was ready to be plated, everyone else had shown up. Even Tony, fresh from the shower with clean clothes and water droplets in his dark locks. The sight made Steve’s breath stutter. ‘How does he manage to clean up so well?’ Steve thought to himself. He had to shake his head to clear the thought. ‘He’s Tony. He’s not into you like that. He’s not into any guy like that.’
Steve bumped him playfully with his foot. “Only a little. So what changed?”
“Very much so,” Tony paused in the open doorway to kiss Steve sweetly.
So for now, I’ll keep writing. And I’ll keep filing them away, in that box you liked so much. The one with the silver clasp.
“Are you ready for your reward? You’ve been so good for me.” He could feel Tony nod eagerly into his neck.
And then Steve was kissing him. It was cautious, almost afraid of what might come next, but to Tony it felt like what he imagined heaven must feel like. Not that he’d be going there after all the things he’d fantasized about doing with Steve.
Tony looked embarrassed, and then collected himself. “All the more reason to, then! Now get on with it! I haven’t eaten for at least 30 hours and I’m starving. I want that Rogers’ famous All-American Breakfast.”
-Steve
Tony rolled his eyes. “Not like that that Cap, you gotta remember, these are xeno-lifeforms. Their biology is totally different from ours. That’s the best words I have to describe it, but it’s not gross at all, it’s kind of beautiful honestly, like if you or I could manifest liquid mercury and control it with a single thought. And besides, I’m going to synthesize it. I don’t think there’s a lot more of these type of symbiotes out there, but I have some theories about how to replicate it with a little help from this guy,” he tapped his chest, and Steve looked down to see the soft blue glow of his arc reactor. Tony could have sworn Steve’s eyes lingered on his chest, before he swallowed and turned his focus back to Tony’s face. “I need a huge power source to pull this off, and thankfully I just developed a new prototype for Mark VII.”
“I’m here,” he says quietly. “I’ve got you, Steve.”
“God, I wish I had your superpowers,” Sam mutters once he’s gone, taking a second bottle from the cupboard under the sink and filling it from the tap.
Barnes doesn’t know how he’s supposed to react, but he thinks, for once, that not knowing how to react might actually be normal in this situation. He takes another sip of his beer, and pushes himself to keep making eye contact with Clint.
"Aye-aye, Captain."
“What the hell, Thor?” he just about manages, his voice coming out strangled. “You assumed- What?”
Despite the fact that the former brainwashed assassin in the room has picked up on Tony’s attempts to divert the conversation away from him and Steve (he’s not worked out why, Tony doesn’t think, but he’s definitely realised it’s happening), Thor seems to be completely oblivious. It’s not exactly surprising, since the concept of keeping things quiet seems to pass Thor by a lot of the time, but Tony really would like it if Thor would notice the very obvious
Perhaps this is it, where they punish him for attempting to leave, and the asset will be stuck in here until the Avengers decide what they want to do to him.
to have been shut down before the call connected; someone is getting one hell of a scolding as soon as Maria's finished managing this crisis. Still, this information is hardly intended to be confidential from the Avengers, so Maria offers Banner a curt nod in answer to his question.
"But aren't you the one who said it?"
"Good news," Sam says, breaking into a grin as he relays the half of the conversation Steve wasn't with it enough to overhear. "Stark's on the way back to the Tower with Barnes. No one's injured, and JARVIS has a jet on the way to collect us."
"I know," says Steve. "I also know that there are almost as many jerks today as there were before the law changed."
It was a fuck up, Clint knows that.
“I was captured once,” Stark says, so close to silent that Barnes wouldn't have heard it without his enhanced hearing. “Afghanistan. Took shrapnel to the chest, woke up in a cave with a fucking car battery wired into me. Worst three months of my life, still have nightmares about it now, and the things I read in your file make it seem like a fucking five star resort. I would've done exactly what they wanted me to, if the shit they gave me to build them weapons hadn't been what I needed to build the first suit and escape. A few weeks in a cave with guys who never made it past chapter two of
Her memories of the Winter Soldier might have undergone some editing, but there is no reason why they would have wanted to remember him as the one spot of kindness in her childhood. All this time, she's let herself believe that much was true, that for a brief time there was someone who saw her as a child to be protected rather than a weapon to be honed, and she's not ready to say goodbye to that delusion just yet. “I can't, Clint. There's things I haven't told you.”
“Oh,” Clint adds, as Sam heads for the elevator. “Can you tell him I said
Barnes doesn’t smile, even though Natalia said he should. “I killed your parents,” he says.
He doesn’t know if Bucky remembers
He doesn’t know if Bucky remembers what was done to him and what he was made to do between ‘45 and 2014.
Tony might be winning when it comes to book smarts, but his heart is a fucking idiot.
In short, as much as Bruce wishes he was the one to help his friends come to terms with their assorted issues, the chances of him making things worse are infinitely higher than the chances of him making them even slightly better.
, Tony thinks. He’ll graciously accept Steve breaking up with him, but he’s not going to let him do the
“Hey,” Clint calls from the doorway, only then looking back over his shoulder. “You coming, Barnes?”
!” Tony answers, his cool well and truly lost. “You- No one is
At this, Tony turns around, full on glowering at the photo of Steve staring at a lizard sculpture currently occupying the holoscreen. "Okay, so, first off, not all of us spent the day pissing around looking at pretty sculptures, second, we worked very hard to obliterate a Hydra base before anyone even thought about swanning around, and thirdly, you don't even live here half the time, how were we supposed you hadn't just ambled off somewhere?"
Instead, he tells her about the projects he's been working on: the issues with the new StarkPhone that cropped up in beta testing; the prototype wings he's been building purely to prove he can do it and do it better than whichever idiot built the EXO-7; the changes he's considering making the next time he rebuilds Rhodey's armour.
“Oh,” Tony answers, relief hitting him so hard he feels winded.
“Sorry, what?” Sam asks, sort of assuming the clack of the plates he’s just put away has made him mishear that. “He told you that?”
letter is going to make everything better."
He accepts Clint Clint Barton’s hand, though he lets go as quickly as he can, immediately taking a step back.
"Sir? You are in Avengers Tower, in your workshop. It is January 17th, 2014, and the time is 01:32," JARVIS is saying, when Tony resurfaces from the memories triggered by hearing about the surgery removing what remained of Barnes' arm (the worst part was that they'd actually
Steve's blood runs cold, and it's suddenly very important that he not let on that he's awake.
“I did not believe you would, Captain,” JARVIS tells him. Steve chooses to believe he sounds approving, even if his voice is exactly as it always is, because the thought that JARVIS approves of him is very slightly comforting. “I will, however, remind you that Sir has a tendency to hear what he expects to hear. I would strongly advise you to be very straightforward with him, when he arrives.”
Steve's given talking enough of a chance for one day.
The blueprints are awful, indescribably so, but it's not until he reads the initials in the lower right hand corner of each page that Tony vomits right there on his workshop floor.)
“Yeah, well, it’s how Tony does them,” Steve says, more heated than he intended. He makes himself take a breath, then starts over. “It’s not exactly what I hoped for, but it is what it is. I tried to ask him if he wanted to go steady, back when we started out, and he shut me down before I could even get the question out. He wanted to be
It’s only a few moments before the doors open again, and the asset steps forwards just as cautiously as he left his room.
"The translation is complete, Sir," JARVIS tells him; Tony waits for him to begin reading the file, but he doesn't.
“You’re not drinking that, right?” he asks, pointing at the coffee Tony prepared for him. It’s apparently a rhetorical question, though, because he picks the mug up before Tony can point this out and, still grinning, says, “If you’ll excuse me, I have an idiot to yell at.”
“No, Yasha,” she says. “I remember many dancing instructors, but only one who was ever kind to us. You had just as little in the way of freedom as the rest of us did, and you still treated us better than anyone who chose to be there. You have
"Hey, no," Steve interrupts, because it's taken him this long to realise Tony is Tony-apologising for what, as far as Steve is concerned, basically amounts to the fact that he's a human being with feelings. "I wasn't trying to make you feel bad, Tony. It wasn't a complaint."
"Are you giving me a choice?"
As much as Steve has a reputation for being courageous to the point of foolhardy, he’s an utter coward when it comes to feelings.
He's interrupted by Bruce clearing his throat, his demeanour more than a little uncomfortable. "I don't need details, Tony," he says.
He'll get with the program eventually, now that's he's standing on his own, and the hotel will make for a lot better location to have the conversation he and Steve are very much overdue.
, Tony Stark won't make him suffer too much before he kills him, even though a quick death is better than he deserves.
, and they never cared whether the operative in question was old enough to vote or not, but the thought of his spiderling in the chair they used on him makes Barnes nauseous. Natalia was seven the first time he saw her, sixteen the last (before they sent him to kill her, at least), and that monstrosity would have dwarfed her at any age, pale skin and fiery hair cast in stark relief by all that black leather, screams echoing in the cold concrete room the chair lived in.
Because Tony's just realised exactly what it is he'd forgotten.
“How’d you figure that?”
There’s a bag of bagels and a box of doughnuts on the table, clearly bought in, so Sam sticks around, pouring himself a glass of orange juice before getting a clean plate and knife from the dishwasher (turns out, an AI-butler is good for making sure the dishes get in the machine cleaned, but not so great at getting them back into the cupboard afterwards, and Sam is
"Is that it?" Tony asks, flipping up his faceplate to glare at the closest barely conscious body on the floor. "You called us in just for that?"
All of a sudden, the determined confidence she used to chase Steve out of the apartment is gone, and the woman beside him looks an awful lot younger, and something very close to vulnerable.
Bruce smiles, not happily, more like he's just trying to be supportive, and then shakes his head. "I'm finding it hard to believe he'd do something like that," he says softly.
Steve looks down at his terrible, mindlessly chosen breakfast plate, and sighs, standing up.
He shouldn't. He should turn around, go back to his room, order some food and then go to bed. His own bed. Alone.
"Tony," Steve says quietly, carefully, when the last of the creatures is down, the spider-abductees have been recovered, and all that's left is keeping an eye on the clear-up and making sure Hulk sticks to trampling spider corpses rather than civilians. It's the first chance he's had, what with Tony refusing to acknowledge him on the call from Hill and then flying down here in the suit rather than taking the quinjet with Bruce and Clint and risking a conversation with Steve after they picked up him and Sam on the way. "I just wanted to say thank you."
"On a number of occasions, I have sent Captain Rogers what I had deemed probable locations for Sergeant Barnes," JARVIS confesses.
The bastard has just blown up Tony's world with the truth about his parents' deaths, and then he goes chasing after their murderer.
“Maybe,” Steve teased, “But what are you going to do about it?”
Steve opened his door, hopeful that he’d be gifted another Tony sighting today, and immediately collided into something firm and fabric covered. A book clattered to the floor, and as he bent to pick it up, his hand brushed against another hand. Tony’s hand, to be exact. Steve’s eyes darted up, and he could easily read the look of embarrassment on his face.
Tony looking at the viewer with earnest eyes.
So he steeled his nerves and spoke aloud. “Come here often?”
Tony’s eyes widened, wincing as Steve gently touched the spot he’d been hit, and Steve was suddenly very aware of how close he was. He could smell the musk of Tony’s expensive cologne, mixed with engine grease and probably a little sweat. It should have been gross, but instead it smelled comforting. It made him feel safe. It was the smell he dreamed about sometimes, as he dozed off after a long day of Avengers missions. It was Tony’s smell.
All he knew was he couldn’t wait until next Tuesday’s appointment.
So he stared at his phone, contemplating trying his luck to sneak past the nurse on guard duty. They’d already caught him trying to sneak back once a couple of weeks ago, and made it a habit to have someone on the lookout now. They was annoyingly supportive of Rhodey’s wishes.
Steve slumped into the door frame against his back, hands covering his face in embarrassment. “So much for deciding when to tell the team.”
He imagined commanding Tony to strip naked, and kneel, hands behind his back, as Steve tied them together. He’d check to make sure it wasn’t too tight, but there was no way Tony would break free. Steve had spent years learning how to tie perfect knots as a boy, and they would certainly come in handy for what he had in store for Tony.
“I’m going full Tristan in Number 23, taking you back to my room and having my way with you.” Tony said, leaning in close enough that Steve could feel his warm breath on his skin.
He gingerly left the sketch book on the page it had been open to, and turned off the light, a soft giddiness rising in his belly as he made his way back to bed.
Steve gave him a couple more hits, the last one perhaps a bit too strong from the way Tony’s voice pitched up higher, and then gingerly lifted him up and back. He was kneeling once more, and Steve wrapped gentle arms around Tony from the side, murmuring in his ear that he’d been so good, had taken his punishment so well, and would be rewarded now.
Instinctively, he ran towards the commotion, his mind ruling out different possibilities for what could have caused such a loud noise. He found himself in front of Tony’s workshop, and could hear the creative and crude words Tony was spouting. He hesitated, unsure of what to do, but then there was another clattering, and Steve was worried Tony had hurt himself.
Tony smiled up at him as they sipped their coffee. Steve had perched himself on the desk, his full lips curving into a sweet expression as he drank from his mug. He looked freshly scrubbed and delectable. Tony could see the water droplets still shining in his hair and the slight flush he always got after emerging from a steaming shower. It was adorable and made him want Steve all the more.
When he finally received the email notification that his package had come, Steve scrambled down to where the incoming mail was collected, and grabbed up the parcel. It took a lot of willpower to not rip into the packaging on his way back to his room, but he remembered that anyone could walk by and see what he’d ordered. It was easier to open it in private than risk Natasha or Sam prying into things.
-Steve
“Yes! Bacon and eggs would be great. Why don’t you start on it and I’ll go get changed?” Tony sniffed at his shirt, “I’m pretty sure I’ve been wearing the same clothes for days.”
Tony didn’t waste a second, “Hey, didn’t you say you’d help Clint with setting up his outdoor target practice? I think I heard him get up a while ago, you should probably go help him with that, you gotta deliver on your promises, Steve. That’s what Captain America is all about, right? Keeping promises. Gotta get a move on!”
Tony pressed the page to his chest, feeling warm and happy and very okay in this moment. He typed Steve’s number into his phone, saving him as new contact.
He heard Steve let out a huff of air, and from the corner of his eye could see him running his fingers through his hair, clearly flustered.
“So that was a fucking mess,” Tony sputtered out.
I’d rather be writing this on paper, but you’d probably think it old fashioned. So I’m trying. I’m trying to show that I can change. That I can admit when I’m wrong.
“I like this version of you best,” Tony said, eyes fluttering closed. He shifted on his side, opening his eyes again to peer up at Steve.
The production assistant shook her head angrily, and Steve could hear Tony tell her, “I’m not fucking doing this any more! I was told all I had to do was show up late, pretend I was mildly bored and make sure the conversation was a little awkward. I wasn’t happy about it, but there was no way I was going to pass up that much money. This, however? This is just downright cruel! He’s a really nice guy, and he doesn’t deserve any of this! God, I hate myself that I let it get this far. No amount of money is worth fucking with someone’s head like this. I’m done. I’m done with your fucked up little game and I’m done being an asshole to a really sweet guy who has absolutely no clue what’s going on.”
They stared at each other, neither one knowing what to say.
Tony laughing as he did routine maintenance on Dum-E.
Dear Tony,
“Well it worked. Took me an embarrassing long time to catch on, but it was worth it. Besides, I wouldn’t mind seeing you in that robe again someday.”
“We changed,” he repeated back softly.
“I think our dear friends may have caught on a little earlier than us that we like each other, and were placing wagers on it,” Tony explained, glancing to Nat for confirmation.
Tony wanted to kiss him until he was panting, begging for more. And then he’d fuck him roughly, slamming into him so hard that they’d risk breaking the bed.
He hesitated again, before responding with another, “Yes.”
Steve grasped onto him, delicate and sweet in the most Steve way possible. But then that naughty glint in his eyes returned and he started stroking, and fuck fuck fuck. Where had he learned that? How could the literal beacon of wholesome American values be so goddamn incredible at stroking him off?
The living room was dark and peaceful. Steve settled onto the couch, eager to find out about the results of a local election. He finished that story, then one about proposed school bus drivers’ salary increases. And then one about a hit and run that happened in broad daylight.
“I, I think part of me wanted you to find it. I knew I’d never get the guts to show you myself. Part of me wanted you to know though.” Steve’s voice was gentle as he spoke, and Tony felt a sprig of hope nestle inside him at the words.
Despite their many differences, and man, there were a lot, Steve just understood him. Could anticipate what he needed before he could voice it. They clicked in a way Tony didn’t with most people. And he had a feeling Steve felt the same way. He’d had a hard transition into the modern world. He was good at faking it, but Tony knew better. Knew he’d felt stupid and slow when faced with simple things like an ATM or microwave settings. He was one of the smartest people Tony knew, but he was at a huge disadvantage for not having grown up with modern technology.
“Hi, I don’t know how much of that you heard, but please know I am so so sorry for what I said earlier.” Tony was talking fast, almost too fast for Steve to follow, but he didn’t interrupt him to ask him to slow down. “This isn’t a dating documentary or whatever horseshit they told you. This is for that awful Disaster Date show, or whatever it’s called. I was supposed to be an intentionally bad date, and however long you stuck through the date was how much money you’d win at the end. I honestly had no clue it’d be like this. I guess that’s what I get for not researching what I’m signing up for, but I want to apologize for how I treated you. That wasn’t okay, and I feel awful that I let myself get blinded by how much money they kept offering me. Every time they told me to do or say something mean, they kept upping the cash prize, and like I said, I’m desperate to pay for school. That part was real, everything I told you about myself was real. But I couldn’t do it anymore, couldn’t stand to hurt you like I was clearly doing. I’m so sorry, Steve.”
Very private fantasies that just so happened to be about the man who was holding him, sucking on his bottom lip and groaning into his wet mouth in the most deliciously obscene way.
He swallowed what he wanted to say and picked up a menu, ignoring the cruel words. Steve pretended to read it, not really able to pay attention to anything printed on the page, and glanced around for a waiter.
Every.
Tony thought.
That had earned him a lazy punch to the shoulder from Sam, and he breathed a sigh of relief as the conversation moved on to Rhodey’s new love interest. Nat was being especially nosy about finding out who she was.
Steve let out a reluctant chuckle, “That’s true, when I first got the book set in the mail I had to lock myself in my room to read them because I knew one of them might burst into my room and catch me reading them.” He leaned down to kiss Tony, savoring how good he tasted. “Could get used to this,” he mumbled.
So Steve decided to do some research. He left the book where he’d found it, taking care to nestle the dirt-stained corner back into the potted soil, and went up to his room to use the computer, leaving the newspaper half-crumpled on the couch.
Tony was a fucking disaster waiting to happen. Sometimes Steve worried the man had little-to-no sense of self-preservation. He’d walk into dangerous and unknown situations, cracking jokes all the while. He’d shrug off injuries that made Steve wince from how bad he knew they must hurt. And he’d go on days-long binges of coffee and junk food when he was working on his projects--that is if he ate at all.
He glanced one last time in the mirror, adjusting his tie, and left to go have breakfast.
Steve grasped onto Tony’s cock, loving the gasp he let out at the sudden touch, and began pumping. Tony was achingly hard, sticky and wet with desire. He stroked up and down, teasing the head just enough to get another whine from him, all the while grinding his own cock against Tony’s thigh. He kept whispering in Tony’s ear as Tony nuzzled him. Steve told him how sexy he was, how proud he was for Tony being so patient and compliant, that he was such a good little cockslut. He knew Tony would get weak in the knees from all the dirty talk, and soon he was supporting Tony’s weight, holding him up in their kneeling position while he rubbed up and down Tony’s length, faster and faster.
He burst through the door, searching the cluttered room for any sign of Tony, and spotted him lying on the floor, on his back. Tony was glaring at the Iron Man suit hoisted above him in the air, and threw his wrench on the concrete floor, muttering about metal parts being ungrateful.
The slime dripped on Tony’s shoulder, green and viscous. He shuddered from the chill of it, and raised a hand to wipe it away.
He collected his food and left the kitchen, leaving Steve wishing he’d said something. Steve was tired of these tiny interactions. He wanted Tony all to himself. He knew that was presumptive, but maybe he needed to be a little more like Sawyer. He needed to be proactive, because Tony didn’t seem aware of message Steve was trying to send him.
Tony’s breathing was frenetic as he pumped into Steve’s hand. He took one last shuddering breath before giving in to his orgasm, a thick stream of wet come splattering on Steve’s hand and chest. He panted, collapsing into Steve’s arms, His cock twitching in response to Steve rubbing the head, tiny aftershocks that made him gasp.
Tony blinked, unsure of what to do next, so he reached out a tentative hand to cup Steve’s face, hoping he could communicate some level of reassurance that he felt the same way.
Tony sputtered, making another grab for the hardcover book, and Steve couldn’t help but give him a sheepish grin as he handed it over.
Steve had spent hours at a time fantasizing about it. About pinning him to the ground and seeing Tony, eyes wide with surprise, following each and every order Steve gave.
I can’t begin to apologize for everything that happened in a single text. But know that I’m sorry. Know that it keeps me up every night. Know that I would take back so many things if I could.
You always knew how to draw me back from the edge. You knew how to push me right up to that point, and pull me back. I half hated you for it, but it’s what I needed. I needed to be reminded that I’m capable of mistakes.
Tony had disappeared pretty quickly after Steve entered the kitchen, presumably to shower and change like he’d said. And about halfway into the cooking process, Sam and Nat had wandered into the kitchen and offered to help.
“I guess so,” Tony mused.
Steve chuckled in spite of himself. “Somehow I think you’ll survive. Besides, you have me. And you love antagonizing me.”
He was surprised, clearly. And then he took in Steve’s outfit and his frown turned to an open mouthed gape. He blinked up at Steve, and it almost looked like a flush was forming on his neck and cheeks.
“Sure, Steve, I’d be happy to lend it to you, and the ones that come after it. Just let me know when you’re ready for the next one.”
It he was being entirely honest, his fingers itched to get his hands on it again, but he settled into his work from last night, reviewing where he’d left off and what his focus today would be.
Maybe one day something will remind you of what your life used to be like when I was in it.
And if Steve happened to be too stern after missions, or wanted to analyze the video footage to show Tony just how reckless he was being, who could blame him? Nothing seemed to get through to Tony, so he’d had to resort to being more brash about things.
Steve’s eyes widened in shock, before rolling back just a touch in a look of pure pleasure. He was so reactive, Tony realized, every touch like electricity to Steve. How long had it been since he’d been with someone, he wondered.
He was itching to get back there and ask Helen about Rhodey’s progress, but even Dr. Cho seemed on board with barring Tony from coming back with Rhodey. She’d given him a gentle smile as she had explained that while the hospital was incredibly grateful for his generosity, that part of his friend’s recovery process was letting him do things on his terms. In the most polite way possible, she basically told Tony to fuck off until Rhodey was ready to let him be more of a part of his rehab process.
This gorgeous guy had the same blank, pained expression that Tony imagined he probably had whenever he was in this waiting room, and he cleared his throat, wanting to speak but uncertain.
“That doesn’t sound like the words of a man who’s earned his pleasure, does it now?” Steve drew out the words, voice lilting as he teased Tony. “It sounds to me like our sessions aren’t doing much good. And here I thought you were learning to listen to me when I told you to be quiet.”
Please let me know what you thought of it!
Fuck him. God, sometimes Tony wished he could. He wanted to shove Steve up against the wall after a frustrating mission and take out all his anger. He wanted to pin him down until little bruises formed on his gorgeous smooth skin. They’d start fading almost immediately. Fucking serum. He wondered how tight he’d have to grip onto Steve’s hips to make the marks last more than a few minutes. How hard would he have to bite to leave marks on his chest?
Normally he’d be fully invested in whatever he was reading. It was one of the things he’d preserved from his old life—sitting in the morning to read the paper. But something was stuck in the back of his mind. A distraction that wouldn’t go away.
"I mean, you can," Sam agrees easily. "But
She loves knowing that she is steering this ship, and that every cent the share price increases by is just a little more proof that she deserves her place at the helm.
, because Tony interrupts him. “He’s on your floor,” he says, that alone, and promptly looks away, making a show of rummaging through a pile of what seems to be junk on the bartop next to him.
He's not great at apologies, but since Tony's a whole hell of a lot worse it looks like Clint'll have to be the one to take the initiative.
"You know that's legal now, right?" might not be the right answer, but it's probably not a million miles from it either.
"Two outings in one day, JARVIS?" she asks; in the days when Tony spent more time out of the house than in it, this wouldn't be at all unexpected, but given how reclusive he's been of late, Pepper is a little surprised. Still, if JARVIS says Tony's on his way out again, he probably is, and Pepper isn't going to miss him because she's waiting for an explanation rather than taking the elevator up to the roof.
"J, put this in chronological order, then get me a translation on anything not in English, yeah?"
Unfortunately, he also knows from experience just how much Sam won't be swayed by that argument.
But JARVIS stays quiet far longer than it should take him to process Tony's request, and then, hesitantly, says, "I'm not sure that's wise, Sir."
At that, Steve falters again, because even if he has been an idiot with demonstrably poor interpersonal skills, at least in this much Bucky is wrong. “Buck, he doesn’t feel like that about me. We’re not- we’re just fooling around.”
"This afternoon?" Bruce says, inflection very definitely making a question of it, like somehow Clint is supposed to have the answer already. "I got back about ten minutes before you did."
“Oh,” Natasha thinks again, this time aloud. “It’s okay. He can call me that.” She pauses, trying to reign in the childish sentimentality she should definitely be above feeling. “Give me a couple of days, I’ll find a flight home.”
Sometimes, he thinks he'd readily go through Steve if that's what it takes.
Did they
And then Steve crumples, collapsing in on himself like a car hitting a streetlight, a full on concertina that ends with him sitting on the floor, his head down and shoulders shaking. He's completely silent, the way he was after the fight that revealed the Winter Soldier's identity, and Sam does exactly what he wishes he could have done then.
Steve throws a final punch, sending the bag flying into the wall about six feet from Tony. It’s more the thud than the proximity that makes him flinch, because even when he’s as angry as this Steve is still completely in control, but the reaction alone is enough to make Steve look terrible.
This cell is by far the largest that the asset can remember being kept in. One wall is floor-to-ceiling windows, and although they don’t open, there are no bars, nothing to prevent the asset from smashing through the glass and escaping. The other walls are painted pale cream, with monochrome photos of the city at semi-regular intervals. It’s furnished with a bed, soft and far bigger than necessary, particularly since the asset sleeps on the floor under the oversized writing desk in the corner furthest from the door (the writing desk makes less sense than the bed, since the asset can neither read nor write, though he thinks maybe he could before).
Either FHD has impeccable taste in kitchenware, or he's properly tooled up, and Clint thinks he can probably guess which one it is.
There's only an inch of scotch left in the bottle he's been steadily making his way through since Bruce's visit earlier, and there's no point at all putting the lid back on it at this point; Tony throws it back, leaves the empty bottle on the desk for DUM-E to take care of, and stumbles over to the elevator.
"My apologies," JARVIS says, over the sound of the assembled Avengers exchanging greetings and questions about each other's well-being while they wait for the others to join the conversation. "I am having difficulty reaching Agent Romanov."
“Good evening, Sergeant Barnes,” the voice in the ceiling says, as calm and polite as he is when he talks to Steve and Sam, and the asset is relieved.
, and you kept swearing the whole time you were sneaking out of there.”
"Sure," Tony agrees, going back to his screen and carrying right on with what he was watching like Bruce isn't still standing right there, like Bruce was never even here in the first place.
wouldn't have gone amiss.
Fuck.
Still, he passes Steve both glasses before joining him on the bed, sprawling out against the headboard and patting the mattress next to him. "I told you to make yourself comfortable, Cap," he says. "Balancing precariously is not comfortable. Plus, as nice as the view of you from behind is, it's much better when you stand up, so if you want t- Yep, that's exactly what I was talking about, if you could maybe bend over now as well, maybe wiggle a bit?"
"Oh," Steve answers, very definitely surprised, but apparently he decides against looking a gift horse in the mouth; rather than asking the very legitimate question of why Tony's suddenly decided to talk to him again, he just says, "Okay, I guess we'll see you later, then. Thanks, Tony."
"I can take those, Mr S," she says, motioning towards the two huge bouquets he has. "Director Carter is in the sunroom, if you'd like to join her there."
"And?"
JARVIS is just programming. He is not capable of and has no need for faith.
Sadly, it’s too late for Sam to try beat some sense into him; the elevator doors slide open, and they both step out. Sam pushes in front of Steve (because, as the person prepared to shoot if they’re attacked, he is definitely the one who ought to go first, even if he’s not as durable as Steve is), and enters Steve’s living space with an appropriate level of caution.
, but, knowing Tony, it's every bit as likely that he has no idea what his subconscious is doing.
. Counsellor or not, Sam really doesn't think he's capable of handling a fraction of Steve's issues, but since Natasha has vanished into the ether in a somewhat ironic effort to find herself and the
face (and, hey, at least in this case Tony knows it's not just some line to wring a confession out of him; if Bruce was angry, they'd all know about it). "So…?"
“Okay,” Tony says, giving in. Hell, he survived with a heart full of shrapnel for four years. What’s a little more eventual heartbreak on top of that? “Okay.”
He’d sort of expected Steve to go about it in a similar way, with the notable exception of the L-word, but apparently not. Apparently, Steve wants to know his drink order. “Wine’s okay?”
, Tony," Clint answers beseechingly. "Of course I don't think they deserved it. But, judging by the way he beat the shit out of his oldest friend, it doesn't look like the guy was ever given a choice."
Tony half-laughs, this dry, uneasy kind of sound, then picks up and promptly puts down a spanner. "Really isn't, though," he says under his breath. "Plus, it helps to be working, keeps my mind off- I mean, I just, look, this."
[JARVIS just needs to have faith.]

"Oh," Clint says. "I'd assumed you and JARVIS were helping him look."

brigade, he realises, as a plate of pasta slides into his fairly limited field of vision, and Tony offers them a slightly begrudging, “Thank you.”
The asset drops to his knees and disarms himself, placing his right hand upon his head and his left hand as close to it as he can manage (stupid thing hasn't been right since the fight where he found the archer, and Hydra never wanted the asset to be able to do his own repairs).
Besides, her words have reminded him that there's still one more question he wants to ask, and it should hopefully be innocuous enough not to cause her distress. "Was Bucky a good man, do you think?"
As such, he's the first to notice Clint's arrival, and the first to greet him, even if his tone turns words that ought to be a joke into something decidedly less friendly. "Well, look what the cat dragged in."
is the second thing on the team's List of Rules for Peaceful Cohabitation, right after
“Look,” he explains, because talking is what Tony does best, and if he’s the one who says it then at least he doesn’t have to hear it. “I figured we were done for good as soon as JARVIS told me he’d found Barnes, so everything since then has been a bonus. You don’t have to be sorry, and you definitely didn’t need to do all this. I’m not going to make a fuss.”
“Shit, no, that wasn’t what I meant,” the archer says, urgent enough that the asset pauses. “Stay, any friend of Steve’s is a friend of mine.”
It's only the next visit of the

to do right now he's pretty sure there's a part of him that will regret it in the future.
There is no evidence that the masters have any idea where it is, or even that they might be looking for it.
It is, she decides, time to call in the troops.
Translations into French were provided by Chalenmimi, and the English is below:
"W-what?"
He steps closer, then goes to his knees, folding Steve into his arms, and does his very best to hold him together.
"Thanks, man," he says, since the guy has set him free rather than knifing him, even if a
He expects the voice to hesitate while he confers with anyone still awake, but the response is almost immediate. “Certainly, Sergeant Barnes,” he replies. “Would you prefer the roof or the exit to street level?”
Pepper moves clear of the jet, then waits on the roof long enough to wave them off. "Back to my office, JARVIS," she asks, once she's back in the elevator. "One crisis down, another eight to go."
"Sir has not provided me with any instructions forbidding it," JARVIS answers, which is basically a yes in Clint's book; smiling grimly, he murmurs his thanks and asks JARVIS to take him down there.
personal best.
He should leave Tony the hell alone, is what Tony will say, and Steve can do that without having to hear it from him.
without wanting to go public. As though he thought Tony wouldn’t be planning to hire a sky-writer and buy out all the front pages and do pretty much anything it takes to show that he also likes Steve. A lot a lot a lot.
Given that Steve was expecting to encounter at best some broken furniture and at worst a full panic attack, he thinks he’s allowed to be a little surprised by this, though he’s still not sure that excuses the fact that it takes him thirty seconds to come up with a response. Even worse, that response is only a concerned, “Alien?”
Tony needs to know that, Steve thinks. He already feels more than enough guilt over the legacy Howard left him, takes on far too much in his efforts to make amends for Howard's wrongdoings, both accidental and otherwise. Steve can't let him believe that his father was the kind of person who could do this, not for the sake of Howard's reputation but because Tony shouldn't spend a single day thinking something like that could be in his genes. Because Tony shouldn't feel responsible for fixing this as well.
It’s familiar, wonderfully so, and Tony gives it his all, throwing himself at Steve with an eagerness that borders on desperation. Steve’s hands seem to be everywhere at once, threading through Tony’s hair, pushing his tee-shirt halfway up his chest, curving under Tony’s ass, and Tony reads that last one like the cue it’s always been, trusting Steve to hold him up when he pushes himself off the ground and wraps his legs around Steve’s waist.
"I understand, Sir," he answers eventually, which of course he damn well does; JARVIS is omniscient enough to make God Himself seem ignorant, so there's no doubt he's understanding things that even Tony doesn't realise he's thinking. "Do you wish me to stop assisting Captain Rogers?"
Tony has Bucky, and it's not come to a fight. Neither of them is hurt, and none of Steve's worst imaginings about how the first meeting between his best friend and his b- well, whatever he and Tony were have come true. They're both okay, or least as okay as they can be, given everything they've both had to deal with.
“Indeed,” Thor agrees readily, because Tony just isn’t that lucky. “However, I was speaking of your romantic relationship. I assumed you would still be enjoying your honeymoon, and therefore uninclined to spend time apart.”
"Can I not keep my stupidity to myself this once?"
"Fucking assholes, goddamnit. I don't care if he was saving the world, this is all fucking Steve's fault, Jesus Christ."
“You too, buddy,” Tony answers, returning Thor’s rib-cracking thumps on the back with ones that are far less powerful, though not for lack of trying. “Don’t suppose you could put me down, could you?” he asks after a moment.
"Sure. Because an
"What the hell, JARVIS?" Tony interrupts, specifically angry with his AI for the first time in quite a while. "Read."
“Want me to try get in touch with her?” Clint offers. “Might take a couple of days, but I’m happy to do it. She’s been off-grid for a while now, actually. About time she came back again.”
"Captain Rogers said he received the file from Agent Romanoff," JARVIS continues, when the pause after his words passes unfilled by Tony. "Based on my analysis of her previous actions, I consider it highly probable she will have also made a copy."
Bruce shakes his head, looking downhearted, before saying, "Just tell me we're heading back to the jet now."
; her expression gets just a fraction more emphatic, and Tony caves.
[JARVIS has instructions against interfering in Sir's romantic endeavours, but as such a ruling is in clear contradiction to his instructions to ensure Sir's well-being first and foremost, he has no qualms about ignoring them.]
"That's not necessary, Tony," Steve protests almost immediately. "JARVIS, please don't worry about us."
,” Natasha answers, only just remembering to keep her accent even as her carefully constructed persona slips away. She'd hoped by giving Stark the unredacted Winter Soldier file, he might understand enough to assign blame where it belongs. No part of her thinks it's fair to expect Tony to offer sanctuary to his parents’ murderer – even Steve wouldn't ask that of him, and Natasha has seen first hand just how far he would go for Bucky Barnes – but she'd thought maybe, given enough time to come to terms with it, Tony might be willing to leave Barnes in peace. “
‒ seems to be waiting for him as well.
Thor looks surprised, if only for a second, but thankfully has the good sense not to say
“It isn’t?” Steve asks.
“Okay,” Tony says again, then takes a deep breath. “Did you ever see him around? After you, you know…”
"Fucking hell, JARVIS!" Tony shouts, not entirely able to come up with words to express how angry he is. Or, well, he's got some words, but they're very much not ones he'd use in front of a family audience. "What the fucking
Tony fails entirely at scoffing at that. "Pretty sure
Unfortunately, finding an opportunity to talk Barnes without Steve seems to be damn near impossible. Sure, the two of them are a couple of floors apart at least five out of every seven nights, but since that’s because Steve is with Tony, they don’t exactly count as an opportunity.
“Well, in that case…” Stark answers, looking back down at the table in front of him. “What is it?”
in comparison to what they did over the years it took to turn Bucky Barnes into Hydra's prized assassin.
"Fine, yeah, whatever," Tony agrees, picking up his unfinished dinner and heading for the elevator.
? He’ll know what it’s about.”
"Sorry, what?" Tony asks, then directs his next question elsewhere. "He's not actually holding hostage the beer that
“Figured I’d let you get it,” Clint says, nodding at the bottle and holding out something in his other hand. “I’ve got the opener here, if-”
. He waits there for some kind of alarm to go off, for the voice in the ceiling to say something or for agents to come pouring out of the woodwork and shut him back in again, but there’s nothing. Aside from Sam’s snoring and the almost imperceptible hum of the heating, the room is silent.
Love to you all,
Steve jumps, much to Sam's amusement, but he justifies his surprise on the grounds that he turned his phone off before they went out and hasn't yet turned it back on again. His phone should not be ringing.
So, yeah. Sometimes he forgets that he hates the Winter Soldier.
Peggy does a good job of keeping up, asking the right questions at the right time, every bit as supportive as she was when Tony would run to her or to Jarvis and Ana for all the attention Howard wasn't giving him.
Tony doesn’t know if he’s supposed to nod or shake his head, so he settles for grinning and heading back over to where he left his coffee.
Still mute, FHD jerks the gun at him again, and this time Clint takes it from him. It's instinct to check the number of rounds in the magazine (four, and a fifth in the chamber, not ideal but Clint's done more with a lot less), then thumb off the safety and stand to one side as FHD opens the door.
happening," Tony repeats. "J, find us somewhere local, four rooms, you know what I'm looking for."
Tony looks gobsmacked, which is about when Steve begins to wonder if he misread the situation. “I didn’t mean it like that,” he says quickly. “I didn’t even
"Hey, as long as I'm dead, you can do what you want to me," Tony tells them, while Bruce grimaces at the suggestion. "Until then, maybe stick to Chinese."
Stark looks at him for an uncomfortably long time (in fairness, anything more than about a second tends to feel damn uncomfortable to Barnes). There’s no expression, at least not one Barnes can decipher, and he doesn’t know if he should start begging or arguing, whether there’s any point in doing either – from what Steve’s said about him, Stark can be impossibly stubborn, and if that’s not the pot calling the kettle Barnes doesn’t know what is.
Sam peels himself away from Steve’s back, then pokes him in the ribs until he moves aside far enough to let Sam see something other than his far too broad shoulders. Namely, he sees Tony Stark, standing behind the bar, resting on his elbows in a way that Sam suspects is intended to look casual but in reality seems anything but.
It is predator as a dog is predator. It has its orders. It sits when it is told to. It fetches what it's told to. It begs for scraps and plays dead in its little ice coffin and kills whoever they tell it to kill.
So Tony can't be furious with him, not really, but in the absence of fury all he feels is… absence.
"Sir," JARVIS says as the last of the Mark 58 clicks into place around him. "May I ask what it is you're planning to do?"
But Steve still hasn’t said anything by the time Tony reaches his mouth; again, the first kiss is a light one, a tease, and then Tony finds himself crushed against Steve’s chest, being kissed to within an inch of his life.
"Oh, you know," she says, patting his hand as he sits back down. "How are you, Tony? Tell me about your life."
He hears Steve leave the floor only moments after the asset closes his bedroom door. He doesn’t come back again that night.
The second door leads to a bathroom as oversized as the bed, the bedroom and the closet all are. The bath could fit three of the asset, the shower could fit five of him, and if he turns the taps left instead of right, the water comes out hot.
Barnes shakes his head, still not sure what he’s supposed to say or do here. It’s therefore reassuring that Clint doesn’t seem to be expecting anything in particular, still relaxed in his perch atop the couchback.
The asset learnt caution at the hands of its former masters, and it learnt its lesson well.
Barnes frowns, though since he’s only doing so now rather than a few moments ago Tony decides to believe it’s because he’s trying to remember rather than because he’s offended. Tony doesn’t try to hurry him, figuring he’d rather get the very slow, considered answer that Barnes is sure about than a rushed one he might later change his mind about.
at the hands of a man Steve wants to defend.
“This’ll do it,” Tony says, closing his designs and pulling the plate towards him and digging in. He’s not eaten since JARVIS told him he found the Soldier, hasn’t a home cooked meal in quite a lot longer (it’s Bruce’s turn to procure food this week, and he says he doesn’t have the patience for cooking; Tony’s pretty sure it’s just an excuse to get out of it, but not quite sure enough to say anything), and it gives him something to do with his mouth and hands that isn’t talking or touching Steve. “Come on, you know I don’t do thank yous, Steve. We’ve talked about this before.”
“That's not-”
and I as good as broke. Seventy years of hell, and they were still frying your brain to get you to do what they told you.”
“Oh, more than,” Natalia answers, giving him a look so thoroughly approving that Steve blushes. “Off you pop, boys.”
Barnes nods, and he and Natalia both watch as Steve joins Sam in the elevator, glancing back over his shoulder at least every other second.
you pose an immediate danger, I promise to do what I have to in order to stop you. And that better be good enough because you’re not getting any more than that, understand?”
Peggy smiles a little vaguely, patting his hand again, the anger of a few moments ago forgotten like so many other things. "You're a good boy, Tony," she says as he stands up.
, and if maybe he focuses slightly more on a particular part of himself, it’s only because it’s working extra hard to make his argument for him. “All the evidence would suggest so.”
A soft glow fills the room, gentle enough not to leave them squinting, and Steve tries not to squirm under the oddly familiar look Tony's giving him.
Abruptly, Steve feels the need to sit down. “I didn’t-”
When it comes to the mission, the asset can only run.
“I thought that was what you wanted, and if I pushed you’d refuse,” Steve says. “So I settled for what I thought was all you were prepared to offer me, but if everyone’s right then, maybe, we were both on the same page after all.”
Unsurprisingly, FHD doesn't answer. Clint looks up to see if he's nodding or shaking his head or something, but his mysterious rescuer has vanished. He stands up and moves down the hallway to the door at the other end, looking up and down the street outside for any sign of the man. He's gone, though, disappearing so completely he might as well never have been there.
The elevator arrives before JARVIS can reply, and Pepper strides out onto the roof wearing her most determined expression, getting there just in time to see the armour fly up the side of the building and into the quinjet.
“Yeah, oh,” Tony agrees, straightening up again. “Don’t worry so much, Steve. He’s got the same basic access rights as everyone else, so as far as I’m concerned Barnes can go where he likes, okay?”
-Steve
Tony found himself humming the song Steve had been whistling, and they passed the hours peacefully once more.
Tony grinned at him but turned back to Steve, suddenly sad that their conversation was at its’ end.
But you’d hand me a cup, and I was always grateful, because it meant I didn’t have to mess with that stupid machine that would get clogged half the time. You stopped me from ripping apart the coffee machine more than once to rebuild it. And that was probably for the best. I absolutely would have overloaded it with special settings.
Yours, Tony
Steve could feel his insides relaxing. He could do this. He had to do this. It would be okay.
“Brought you some food and coffee. Figured you’d be here all night and would forget to eat,” Steve’s voice was low and calming, but it startled Tony all the same. “Sorry Tones, I know you get caught up in the work and don’t always hear us come in.”
“I’m here for my best friend Bucky. We served together. I made it back unscathed, but he wasn’t as lucky. Been coming here ever since we got back to the States,” Steve offered, turning in his seat to better face Tony.
“Bizarre. And gross, did you just use the words secretion and discharge Tony?”
He groaned, wanting more. No, needing more. He’d spent so fucking long thinking about this, never expecting his fantasies to be acted out. And fuck, this was really happening.
He wanted to tease him so mercilessly that Steve couldn’t take it anymore. Edge him until he was sobbing, desperate to finally come. God that would feel good. To unravel him so deeply that Steve broke his word and acted impulsively.
It’s idiotic, but I half wish you were here. You knew him. Knew what he was like. Not fully, not the way I did, but maybe you could catch me. Tell me if I’m veering too much into Howard territory. Some days I can’t tell what’s really me, and what’s me running from him shadow. You never were afraid to call me on my shit. Some days I miss that. Guess today is one of those days.
And Steve’s breath hitched, warmth spreading in waves. “Something like that,” he managed to mutter back.
“And what have you done to earn more?”
Steve, apparently satisfied with Tony’s lack of reaction picked up the book, flipping to the next clean page, and plopped down into the chair.
Tony told him about his current designs for a clean energy source, and just as Steve was in the middle of asking him about when it would go into its testing phase, a rather bizarre expression came over Tony’s face. It was almost as if he was listening to someone Steve couldn’t hear. His eyes went distant, and he glanced nervously at Steve before zoning out again for a moment. Steve didn’t know what had just happened, but maybe Tony was just as nervous as he was, he reasoned.
The next day came far too soon for Tony’s liking, the sun’s glare beating in through his half-open blinds.
And just maybe he’d think of Tony as he stroked himself, groaning into the sensation of tight pressure building in the base of his gorgeous, huge cock. He’d chase after that feeling, letting himself get just up against the point of release, but then back down, slowing the tempo of his strokes, lightening the pressure of his hand. Steve was such a fucking smart-ass when he wanted to be, and it wouldn’t surprise Tony at all if he loved to make a game of it, to toy with himself and challenge himself to see how long he could last through the delicious agony of it all.
“Can I borrow a fine liner, Tones?” His voice was soft and gentle, and it made Tony melt a little inside.
I always did like to rile you up. The way your neck would rise with heat. And your jaw would lock into place. And the vein in your temple that would pulse. I still see it now. See the way you’d square your shoulders, straighten your back. I guess old habits die hard. You always looked like a soldier in that moment. Not the Captain everyone else knew you to be.
One of these days I might finally send something. One of these days I might stop writing these. I can’t decide which would be less painful.
This was all was part of their routine.
Tony wanted to see him plead for mercy. Because of course Steve would be good. If Tony told him not to touch himself he’d listen. He’d be a good boy and would do whatever Tony told him. And that pissed Tony off too.
Tony never knew what Steve drew, never felt comfortable asking, to be honest. He’d been tempted more than once to glance through the book when Steve wasn’t there, but no, he’d be respectful of Steve’s privacy. If he wanted to show Tony what he worked on in the workshop then he would, but until then Tony would do the right thing and resist. Even if it got mighty hard to resist temptation sometimes.
It would be worth it. To fuck that smug look right off his face. To make the perfectly perfect Captain America beg for more. Beg to be allowed to come. Because of course, Tony would edge him on. Wouldn’t let him have any release until he had earned it.
Tony gave him a little nod, and that was apparently all Steve needed to know before letting his fingers nimbly undoing the button and zipper on his tight black jeans.
So he stormed into his workshop, cranked up his stereo and rummaged through the pile of parts he’d been working on for days.
There was a clattering in the hallway, and a distinctive woman’s voice yelling, “I knew it!”
Tony’s eyes darkened, “Now you’re just toying with me. You know I loved that scene when Tristan finally admitted he loved Sawyer.”
Although to be fair, this one was already starting off rough. The camera people seemed irritated to be standing around not able to film any usable material, but one of the production assistants had insisted that his date, Tony, would be there shortly. Apparently he’d gotten mixed up on the time and was rushing to arrive. Steve briefly considered asking if he could just go home, but he really needed the cash, and it was getting towards the end of the month.
Tony’s mind was already racing on how he could build a better arm than what was on the market right now. Hell, he could probably make them a lot cheaper than any other too. He hadn’t even met Steve’s friend yet, but his fingers were itching to start drafting an arm that could fix the issues Bucky had been having with fine motor movements.
The more he visualized the encounter, he could pretend it was real, that it was really happening.
I miss you.
He settled into his chair at the workbench and picked up the jar of acrid green Symbiote slime. It almost seemed to pulse, but Tony couldn’t tell if that was just his imagination. He knew there was nothing left of the Symbiote it had once been secreted from, he’d immediately run tests to check that when they returned to the Tower. But there was something odd about this stuff. And he wanted to figure out how it worked.
He repeated the question, and Tony gave a clipped response, looking annoyed, but there was also something Steve couldn’t quite place. A shade of embarrassment perhaps?
“Uh, gotta go. JARVIS is waiting on me for his systems diagnostics.” And in a beat Tony was gone, halfway down the hallway back to his workshop.
That made Tony let out a huff of surprised laughter. “Who knew Capsicle had a sense of humor?”
It lay open on his stuffed chair, and Tony hadn’t meant to see it, hadn’t wanted to pry, but it was what was drawn on the page that truly made him take notice.
Tony froze for a second. Even his breath seemed to have halted. He looked up at Steve, and then shoved the book behind the chair he was sitting in.  “Just suit stuff. Trying to improve the thruster output for my jets. It’s not quite as efficient as I’d like.” Again, that would have seemed perfectly reasonable, except he’d set the book into a plant pot behind him. Tony was fiercely protective of his stuff, especially if it was related to his work. He’d once griped for days when Bruce had accidentally spilled coffee on some of his notes. He’d banned anyone from bringing food or drinks into his workshop ever since.
The pink book.
I don’t know why I keep writing these. I never send them. Maybe one day I’ll be able to actually hit send. Today is not that day. It won’t be that day for a while.
I know you thought I was choosing Bucky over you. I guess in that moment you weren’t wrong. But in my head there was no you vs. him. There was just me, always trying to protect my friends. And when the world was coming after Bucky, I did what I always do, and looked after him.
So Steve would drag it out, silently gathering supplies for what he planned to do next. He’d cross the room and let his fingers drag across Tony’s spine as he sauntered by, delighting in the visible shudder Tony couldn’t restrain. Or he’d bend down and kiss him, keeping his palms planted firmly on Tony’s shoulders, setting a physical boundary between them, even as he deepened the kiss, driving Tony desperate for more. Just as Tony started to whine against the lack of closeness, Steve would pull away, tutting with a sly smile. The look of hunger and need in Tony’s eyes would be all Steve needed to know how badly he wanted this too.
I mean, I know, but fuck. We don’t need to delve too deep into that. It’s already fucked up enough that I’m writing these to you even though you'll never read them.
“You like that series too, huh?” Steve could feel the pink rising in his cheeks.
He got lost in the work, didn’t hear when Steve finally got out of the shower, didn’t hear the rest of the team coming back from the mission they’d been out on during the Symbiote fight Tony and Steve had responded to. Didn’t even hear when Steve padded barefoot into the workshop with steaming cups of coffee and a grilled cheese sandwich.
Occasionally Tony would emerge out of his workshop to lay on the couch and read. Steve always loved those peaceful afternoons. Even though they were in their own little worlds, he felt connected. He loved being able to turn to Tony and ask him about a plot hole or laugh about a funny line. It reminded him of that day in the bathroom, weeks before. It was quiet. It was just them, just Tony and Steve.
Granted, ever since he’d gotten serious about Iron Man, Tony didn’t seem to have any interest in that old lifestyle. But Steve assumed that was just him growing up. He knew Tony and Pepper were a couple at some point, but had never asked too many questions about what happened in the end. At the time it all seemed too personal to ask a coworker.
Tony told him about SI, about how he’d rather spend his days developing new technologies than trying to please elderly board members in shareholder meetings. He’d been thinking about offering the CEO job to Pepper anyway, and that was starting to seem more and more appealing.
“So the books, huh?” Tony asked as they walked to the door of his workshop, clearly trying to sound casual. “Did you start reading them before or after that morning in the living room?”
-Tony
And then he dismounted from Tony, regretting the long moments without contact while he selected his implement. A paddle would do nicely. This one was pliable and would deliver a delectable sting, thanks to the leather surface. He gripped it in his hand, then walked the brief steps back to Tony, who had been silently waiting for him to return. He saw Tony’s eyes were still closed, and his breathing had steadied once more.
Love, Steve
Love always, Steve
Tony. He had to find Tony, had to talk to him about this. His mind was racing as he stepped onto the busy sidewalk. Where was Tony? He couldn’t have gone too far yet. He had to find him.
But before Tony could finish his sentence, Steve cut him off. “I know that this is hokey and weird, and that we’re both doing this to pay our bills, but I was having a really nice time with you, and I thought you were too. It seemed like we have a lot in common, despite having totally different career paths. You seemed genuinely nice and smart and funny. But it turns out you’re just an asshole. I should have trusted my first impression of you. I thought you were more than just the rich guy who shows up late and doesn’t deign to apologize for it, but I guess not. Now, I am gonna go find a waiter in this godforsaken restaurant and we are going to order food and finish this atrocious date, because there’s no way I’m letting you be the reason I can’t pay my bills this month.” Before Tony could reply, he stood up and strode towards the kitchen, intent on finding someone to take their order.
“Yes sir,” the AI system responded, and Tony swore there was a hint of judgement in it’s tone.
, and he luxuriated in the strong smell of Steve, so close the base scent of him: something spicy and a little earthy and warm. When Tony relaxed his throat, let his fat cockhead knock against the back of it, Steve swore furiously, a sharp "
"Yeah, you're a trooper, aint'cha Stark?" Steve murmured, and it sounded almost
as soon as this stupid tumor eats through the more delicious parts of my brain matter, so you sitting here trying to make me feel better is little more than you martyring yourself on the cause of waiting for Tony Stark to kick the fucking bucket." Tony clenched his jaw, bit back a very visible sob, and finally opened his eyes so he could look wearily up at Steve. "Is that what you want to do, Steve? Just sit here and watch me wither away until I can't control w-when I piss or breathe and finally suffocate myself in my sleep? Is that what you want?"
Steve hummed. "Good," he purred, sliding a finger down to play at the loose hole of his ass, even as Tony tried to tighten it around him. "Mmm, someone needs a plug, I think," Steve murmured, reaching off the bed and into the top drawer, where they kept most of their toys. "Gotta keep all that come in you while I get you off, I think."
"Steve!" Tony called out, nearly spilling his drink; Steve gave a full-body jerk and spun around, his shoulders heaving as he stared at Tony. He was gasping for breath, and his hair was plastered to his forehead from the sweat, and it took him a few seconds before he could talk.
It was a little different, Steve could tell, even without really knowing the concrete details. He could take in the details of Tony's face as he beamed down at Steve, lubed up his thighs, guided Steve's cock through the slick, tight heat of them. "He was my butler," Tony murmured some time later, so soft Steve could barely hear it. "He raised me. I never got to say goodbye, you know? So why should I have to?" He reached down between them to stroke Steve's dick and everything turned dizzyingly hot and hazy. "I'm dying anyway, so if I want to spend my last months pretending that Jarvis is still alive, then I damn well will."
"Then just lay with me," Steve said sincerely, and Tony met his eyes in the mirror, all wide-eyed wonder. Steve smiled, pressed another kiss to his brow. "I'll get you some soap."
, Tony was a
Luckily, he'd only migrated back to the treadmill, but he was already sprinting, his arms pumping back and forth, his chest heaving. It was almost like he couldn't decided if he wanted to stare off into space or look at everything around him, his eyes alternating between a soft, glazed appearance and his pupils darting back and forth across the gym.
They'd officially passed the forty-eight-hour mark.

—" someone shrieked, and there were hands pulling at him. Steve grunted and ripped his arms free and threw another punch. The man took it, seemed more concerned than anything else, and Steve had to clench a curse back behind his teeth. He kicked a leg out, tried to swipe the man's feet from under him, but he dodged Steve easily enough, his hands raised placatingly, his words little more than buzzing in his ears. "He's going to

) to even now, how he talked to Steve, how he treated Steve, when he would touch Steve in the company of others. He was always so— so
"I got you, Tony, I got you," Steve swore, holding Tony up with one hand and using the other to scoot himself closer, drag Tony that little bit closer to him. His hand bumped the half-hard swell of Tony's cock, usually hidden behind so many layers, and both Steve and Tony moaned in surprise at the motion. "Tony—"
—" He shuddered and came practically dry, clenching and spasming around Tony's hypersensitive dick and dragging his own orgasm out of him.
"Don't stop," Tony moaned, sobbed almost, pressing his hot, slippery with sweat forehead to Steve's collarbone. "Don't stop,

Tony moaned before he could help himself: shocked, almost, at the intensity of the lust he felt, deep down in his belly and his balls. He suckled at the head of Steve's cock,just sucking at the salty-sweet precome there while Steve gently rolled his hips over Tony's face, like he was trying to psyche himself up to the act, even though Tony had given him explicit permission, signed, sealed, and personally delivered. When Tony dropped his jaw, let another moan slip from his mouth, Steve gasped and fucked his hips forward, his dick shoving further in and bumping against the back of his tongue. It made the back of his throat twitch, almost like a spasm, and another burst of precome flooded his mouth as Steve's dick jerked between his lips. Tony hummed, sliding his hands up to Steve's ass and pushing on it, trying to get the message across that
"Tony, Tony, Tony," Steve moaned, a constant mantra in his ear. He clutched at Tony's face, bumped their noses together, panted into Tony's mouth. "Oh, baby, that's so good," he whined, sucking at Tony's lower lip. His toes flexed against Tony's back, his legs starting to shake. "Oh, baby, just like that, please— Tony, oh good
, his mind chanted dishonorably, like the goddamn traitor it was.
Tony sputtered. "Are you kidding me?" he said, biting his lip against a giggle.
"Give me a minute, darling," Tony murmured, slipped further down into the water. "I'll be out in a second."
Steve thought desperately, fisting a hand in Tony's hair and pulling his head back.
Tony gasped, shuddered under the weight of it, the way Steve was still lazily rolling his hips in and out of Tony's ass. Steve smiled, massaged along the outside of Tony's thighs, spread them wide enough that Tony could feel the stretch in his hips, felt the way his stomach released its tension all at once. Steve hummed, sliding his hands up and around so he could cup his big hands on either side of Tony's stomach. Tony moaned again. "That's a boy," Steve whispered, rubbed at his round, protruding belly. "I knew you could do it, look at you - all perfect n' full'a me."

person—would be trying to find someone Steve would actually want were he capable of consenting, not— not thinking about offering himself up on a silver platter for the man. A good man would go find a nice good girl for Steve to fuck, and then another nice girl when the first one got tired, and so on and so forth.
"Darling, you know I like it when you throw me around," Tony teased, shuddering when Steve stroked his dick just right, dug his fingers into the thick meat of his back; Steve sped his pace up again. "O-oh—
"How's my fella?" Steve asked eventually, when Tony felt himself finally start to go soft and sweet again. The blanket felt heavy over them, warm and weighted and perfect for coming up after a scene. Tony blinked leisurely up at Steve. "Did'ya get what you needed, hm?" he asked, thumbing against Tony's lip.
Steve was still shaking. "O-o-okay," he stuttered, squeezed his thumb hard on his cock, just under the head. "Yeah, okay, Tony."
Praise from Steve had been... stilted, at first, Steve torn between wanting to keep his hard demeanor intact and give in to this softer side, and so Tony had moved to take the reins back — whispered dirty filthy things in Steve's ear, put his tie in Steve's hands to choke him with, swallowed Steve down to the root and tried to make himself gag on the girth of it. But Steve always slowed the tempo down during those times, made his touch gentle, careful, like Tony was something precious and loved, and pressed tender, soft and doting kisses to the edge of his brow and called him
"I feel like this is too good to be true," Tony whispered eventually, lips barely brushing the fabric at Steve's shoulder. Steve hummed, let his fingers drift up and down the far-too-prominent knobs of Tony's spine. "I'm not hallucinating, am I? Did I knock my head on the floor in the bathroom and give myself a concussion? Am I dreaming right now?"
Tony conked out in his chair, mouth open and what appeared to be drool dribbling down his cheek, embarrassingly.
‘This is just for research,’ he told himself. ‘I just need to find out what kind of guy he’s interested in.’
What will my pickle and peanut butter sandwich be? I hope it’s black coffee. I always did love the way you scrunched your nose up when I offered you a taste.
He made it through breakfast with minimal commentary on his wardrobe choices, even after Sam and Nat came back from their morning run. Sam seemed more preoccupied with the fact that Steve hadn’t been joining them recently.
He switched on an overhead light and found his gunmetal grey watch exactly where he’d thought it had been left, and made short work of putting it on. The heavy chill of it felt comforting. He was turning to walk back to his room when something caught his eye.
Except sometimes I think I do. Maybe you knew it would break me just a little. Maybe you were scared to own up to the truth. Maybe you care more about him than you ever cared for me. Maybe history counts more than I thought. Maybe none of this makes any sense.
It was a shame, really. They hadn’t wanted it to end this way. Tony knew it was possible for Symbiotes to live peacefully with their chosen human hosts. Eddie and Venom were proof of that. But their case seemed to be an outlier. From his understanding, most of the Symbiote population viewed humans as a resource to be sucked dry and thrown away when they’d served their purpose.
Good.
Steve couldn’t stop thinking about how good Tony looked. He was clearly still tired, but his face lit up when he laughed at something Thor said. And then there was the way his shirt hugged his shoulders. It made his stomach feel warm and tight and nervous. Steve knew this kind of thinking was self-destructive. They were friends and coworkers, and nothing else.
But a part of me hopes you miss me too. I know that’s selfish. I know you don’t owe me that. But I still hope.
And Steve showed he cared in little ways. Maybe that could be enough for now?
Steve looked around for a clean cloth, and lightly dabbed at the blood on Tony’s temple. Tony, to his credit, didn’t complain, even through Steve was sure it stung.
Tony laughed and said he understood that; that he was a PhD student at MIT and needed money for school. He grimaced, and Steve could tell there was a deeper story behind that. They talked for a bit about Steve’s art and Tony’s studies, and he was delighted to find out that Tony was just as interested in art history as he was, though their specific areas of interest were different. Steve was a big fan of the Impressionists and Baroque painters, whereas Tony knew about architecture and modern art. Still, it was nice to find out they had things in common.
“After,” Steve admitted reluctantly. “I may have gone back to find out what you were reading and gotten some inspiration”
“That I do,” Tony agreed. “Besides, you’re way more fun to tease. You get this lovely little vein on the side of your temple when you’re trying not to laugh, look, there it is!” He pointed with a goopy green finger at Steve’s forehead, unintentionally smearing the stuff onto his soft skin when he misjudged the distance between him and Steve. “Oops?” He grimaced exaggeratedly as it clung to what had previously been clean skin, and Steve sighed, grasping onto his wrist to remove Tony’s finger from his temple.
Tony had come to every appointment.
This was probably all going to crash and burn, and everyone else on the team would have a good laugh at him over it. But he had to try. Tony was too important to not try for.
This has become a bit of a habit. When I’m stressed I’ve started composing letters in my head. Sometimes it’s just shouting. Sometimes I say things I could never put on paper. And sometimes I write it down. Like now.
Steve grimaced, and noticed the thin line of blood running down Tony’s temple, “That looks like it hurts.” Without thinking, he crossed the distance between them and crouched down to examine the wound.
Steve laughed again. “Admittedly, that was a pretty fucked up thing that just happened, but I know what it’s like to feel backed into a corner, like you have no options. I felt the same way in there, that’s why I stuck it out. Well, that and the fact that I was having a really great time with you until they started feeding you all that stuff you had to do and say in the headset. Plus I like to think I’m a pretty forgiving guy, and you clearly felt awful about it.” He paused, debating on whether he wanted to include the next part. “And, it’s been like 3 years since I had a date, let alone anyone I liked, and as much as I do enjoy spending Saturday nights binge watching tv and cuddling with my cat, sometimes it would be nice to have an actual person to binge watch those shows with.” He smiled sweetly at Tony, who accepted his outstretched hand, and pulled Tony up to stand next to him. He didn’t let go of Tony’s hand as they walked back onto the sidewalk. It was warm and much lighter than his own, and he found that it fit perfectly.
