“The family served him with papers this morning,” Gabriel says, sauntering over with his hands in his pockets and a huge grin on his face. “They’re suing him for malpractice and wrongful death.”
Feathers didn’t immediately start typing again, and Dean worried for a minute that even that relatively innocuous question was pushing the envelope too far into personal territory for Feathers today. Then he figured the guy was probably doing the same thing he’d been doing-- trying to eat and type at the same time. He said he’d just sat down with his dinner, after all. Dean’s moment of panic passed quickly, as Feathers began typing again.
Rowena shrugged. “I did consider it, but it seemed unsporting. Plus one should never meddle directly in matters of love. The couple in question typically resents it after the fact, and it blows up in the witch’s face. And I don’t think there’s anything either of them wouldn’t do for you, so I thought I’d give them a little nudge through you. I hope you’re not too upset with me,” she said, frowning while Sam worked through the implications of what she’d done until she lost patience with him. “Is it working yet?” She asked, casting a slow glance through the window at Dean and Cas sitting huddled together at the booth inside.
“What were you worried about saying?” Cas asked, wondering himself if this had truly been a good idea.
Dean had Cas all ready to go, coffee ready in hand, with a few extra minutes to spare. By the time they got to the hospital and Cas had gotten most of that coffee down, they were both as prepared as they could be to face whatever fallout of the last week might be waiting for them.
“Rowena, right?” Dean asks, and then frowns disapprovingly. “Weren’t the two of you supposed to have a date tonight? You didn’t ditch her for work, did you?”
“Well, if you’re ever interested in having an audience, I’d happily read anything you’re willing to show me.”
They talked about the music, and the next several songs that played while they ate, and Cas silently thanked Impala for educating him enough to not sound like a total fool in front of Dean. Conversation eventually drifted back to writing, as it inevitably did between them, but this time Cas was more cautious. He deflected from talking about his own projects, and instead let Dean bounce a few ideas off him. Cas had been writing Unnatural fic for so long that it felt like a refreshing exercise to talk through some of Dean’s original ideas. One about an airline pilot falling for an aircraft mechanic who was afraid of flying sounded particularly interesting, and Cas couldn’t help but imagine it as an Unnatural AU fic. It hardly seemed fitting to ask Dean if he’d consider letting him write it that way. It was only after they’d been tossing ideas back and forth for several minutes that Cas even registered the fact that Dean was discussing a modern queer romance story, and not at all a fantasy that he claimed to write.
He made it exactly four steps before a second wave of feelings pounded into him. Sam immediately regretted that metaphor as he processed exactly what he was sensing. His duffel bag slid from his shoulder and hit the floor while he stood there, both mortified and stunned by the intensity of the emotions. He caught fleeting images of hands and mouths and eyes, but he’d been rendered immobile by the profound and overwhelming wonder and awe and… and
Dean slowly came back to himself, hands balled into fists in his lap, and sent one final plea out to the universe, to Jack if he was still paying attention to these sorts of things and not busy inhabiting raindrops or whatever. As he unclenched his fists and considered getting out of the car, a light drizzle began to fall. For some reason, it made Dean smile.
, before returning to his task. He’d finished quickly, at least, while Dean puttered around pretending to tidy up the bathroom. When Cas finally left, Dean slipped into the shower to carefully commit the lines of Cas’s naked back and shoulders to memory under the scalding spray.
They fell back into their morning routine as easily as they had their evening routine. Everything was easier and better than before. Cas had bolted off to his room and returned by the time Dean was able to drag himself out of bed, and before Dean could even begin to panic over why Cas had disappeared on him. He returned with his toothbrush and a handful of other personal items and a change of clothes wedged under one arm, an apologetic look on his face as he stood frozen in the doorway while Dean rubbed his eyes and then stared at him.
Cas is unruffled, his attention never wavering from his task. “I had to give myself nine stitches once. I believe I can handle a common bandage removal.”
“Yeah, guess he’s still got the angel memories in there,” Dean said in a hollow voice. “You gonna be able to handle it?”
“You been stalking me or something?” Dean asked, but from his smirk, Cas knew he wasn’t upset, even if he did still look a bit concerned.
“Uh, yeah, that’s right,” he said, hunching over the computer without even bothering to find a chair to sit down on to record what he needed to. That done, he stood up and stretched until his spine popped. Lydia was still standing there like she was expecting a longer answer. He wasn’t sure he even remembered the question anymore. He rubbed a hand over his face, trying to brush away the late afternoon fatigue, and sighed in the effort to suppress a yawn. “Sorry, it’s been kind of a long day.”
: Hey, Feathers. I haven’t started yet. The queen was giving me a pep talk. She says hi, by the way.
Charlie laughed at the soft and wondrous tone of Dean’s voice as he said that. “You just realized you’re actually gonna get to see him face to face for the first time in a week, didn’t you?”
Cas nods, and Gabriel pushes by him again. He pulls out several of the drawers in the dresser in succession. There’s multiple pairs of brand new socks, a package of plain white t-shirts, a pair of sweats with the tag still on, and half a dozen sets of hospital scrubs folded neatly.
It’s over an hour later before Dean wakes up again. He feels a strange tickle against his chin as Cas shifts against him, and he can’t help the impulse to hug him tight. He’s rewarded with Cas nuzzling into his neck, making happy little noises as he wakes up with a yawn.
Dean huffed out a laugh and pushed himself up as Cas reached to unfasten his pants and wriggle out of them, sliding away from Dean up the bed.
“What?” Dean asked him when Cas had stopped eating and was just sitting there staring at him. “I got something on my face?”
Pamela just smiles at them all, pleased for having been able to bring them all to this point. “It’s starting to sound like what we need here is a party.”
As for the film crew, they stood outside their camper watching this impromptu football game with abject confusion for a minute or two, until Sam finally sent a carefully aimed throw right over Dean’s head immediately followed by a slightly panicked shout of, “my bad, my bad” directed toward the stunned onlookers. They parted as Dean barreled toward them and made a perfect leaping catch a few feet in front of where they’d been standing. It had been exactly the opportunity they’d been hoping to engineer.
file. With good reason. He quietly hoped that Ed’s research skills had improved in the intervening decade since then and chose to focus on the facts at hand.
“Huh,” Dean finally says, pulling out his phone for maybe the twentieth time that day to see if Cas has replied to him yet. For the first time all day, he’s rewarded with half a dozen new messages. He decides to hoard them for when he’s finished talking to Sam, so he packs away his relief and his phone. “Guess that’s why he never got back to me this morning. Guy’s been busy.”
Cas shook his head and smiled. “I arrived the day before yesterday. Spent an afternoon walking around and familiarizing myself with the relevant departments and their proximity to the Cuban coffee vendor in the north elevator lobby. They have a superior guava pastry.” Cas pointed to the elevators in the north tower on the map, adjacent to the emergency room. “You should probably notate that for future reference.”
“You did it,” she said, clutching her wounded shoulder and trying to sit up. “You beat him, but he’s not dead.”
“It was kind of flirtatious,” Jack chimed in from the back seat. “But it didn’t feel uncomfortable or inappropriate to me.”
Cas hummed, considering that logic. “Kansas doesn’t have a basketball team, either,” he eventually replied.
“You’re welcome any time, Charlie. You get sick of watching sunsets over the ocean and feel like watching sunrises over the ocean, you know where to find me.”
Dean shrugged and got up from the table. “Hang on a sec.” He ran back to his room, rummaged through his bag of gear until he found the radio unit he’d modified to connect to his recording rig, and fiddled with the controls as he walked back to the library. He set the radio on the table and they all flinched and cringed as the unit squealed and squawked until they finally picked out the faint sound of voices between the static.
Dean blinked at him for a moment, but then nodded slowly. “I think writing’s a part of who I am, too. I don’t think I could stop if I tried.”
“We still had a lot to do before we could actually answer you, and we weren’t sure what Cas would choose for himself,” Jack replied, still not clearing anything up. “We didn’t want to give you false hope.”
He frowns at the road ahead of them and grips the wheel tighter. At least he’s not the one buying the car today. It doesn’t matter what the finance jackass at the dealership thinks of him. He’s just there for moral support. It’s Sam that needs to look like a responsible, upstanding citizen to qualify for the car loan.
: He’s just a friend who’s found himself in a predicament similar to our own. It’s just that I’ve never even considered telling anyone I know irl about the solution that you and I seem to have found to satisfy our respective need to tell stories. It’s rather a daunting proposition to expose myself like that to anyone. I thought if anyone would understand, it would be you.
Dean just nodded at him in approval and commiseration as they made their way to the library. It was gonna be a long night.
Heart palpitations was right, Dean thought as he struggled to compose himself in the face of Castiel’s quiet amusement. And wow, he was having an entirely different sort of palpitations as he took in the fact that Cas was fucking
If someone had used that line on Dean, he’d have a dozen snappy-- if entirely inappropriate-- comebacks at the ready. He wisely chooses to employ none of them in this situation. This poor woman has already been traumatized enough for one day.
might be too strong a word. I swapped out his old defective hip for a shiny new one last year, and he seems to think he owes me a favor in return. So I asked him if he’d ever be willing to drop everything and move someone for me on an emergency basis, and he’s game.”
Cas looked at his fingers again, and then back at Dean as he carefully cupped Dean’s cheek and then slid his hand down Dean’s neck and shoulder. “Does this help?”
“Yeah, and I’m just a random dude she knows in real life. Not a fandom friend, as far as anyone who saw the pics was concerned.”
“Uh, yeah, yeah, I am,” Sam says, letting go of his injured arm with a hiss of pain and reaching into his pocket for his wallet. “Third year law school.” He hands over the cards and then leans heavily against the counter as he begins filling out the paperwork.
Dean’s other eyebrow goes up and he turns to Donna for confirmation. Jody also turns a surprised look on her. Donna just shrugs.
Jack shook his head again. “No, Chuck is human now. When he dies, he’ll go to Heaven like every other human.”
“I’ve been writing since I was a kid, too,” Dean said, glancing around to make sure they were truly alone before going on. “Used to make up stories to tell Sammy when he couldn’t sleep, and after a while he’d start asking for specific ones. I’d maybe change a few details, or rework the plot, and Sam started commenting on which versions he liked best. I guess he was my first editor. Or maybe my first critic.”
“There was just a moment where the reflection in his eyes disappeared without explanation. It’s difficult to tell in such low light, but it appeared that his eyes flashed black.”
it happened. Cas always came back. Now that he was human, just like Penthia would be in a couple days, Cas had finally chosen not to leave in the first place. He chose to stay because he
: I admire your tenacity, but I hope doing that much editing at work didn’t negatively impact your job performance.
Sam’s eyes widened and he slowly turned to look at Dean, who just kept staring out the front window. Cas chose that moment to break into their conversation, leaning over the front seat between them.
Donna had been as in on their relationship status change as clearly as Jody had been. Sure, it had made any sort of awkward announcement of that fact a moot point, which Dean had appreciated. But he couldn’t help feeling just a little bit excluded.
“Yeah, well, I can’t kiss that until it’s healed a bit,” he says, pointing at the tattoo to avoid looking at the blush he can feel burning across his own cheeks in the mirror. “You like it, though?”
With a resigned sigh he knew right then he’d be forwarding a copy of his draft the moment he got home from work. No matter how rough it was or how naked it might make him feel.
“That doesn’t explain the logic behind pushing Naomi up to the top of the list. From the looks of it, she’s one of the more upstanding members of her family, and from what I can tell she practically runs this hospital behind the scenes. Why would she put all that at risk just to please one relatively obscure member of her extended family?”
Dean looked mildly disappointed at that, but then shrugged. “Yeah, if we’re gonna get snowed in, we should find a motel next door to a diner or something.”
Dean had built up a mountain-- ten years’ worth of pushing it all down-- and it took a while to let it all out. They stood by the counter for what felt like years, feeling every pent-up emotion freed to tell their story through the rise and fall of a thousand tides. They frantically devoured one another, ebbing to gentle caresses of lips, before another tsunami of overpowering need would crash over them. Eventually the storms passed, and they were left holding each other, as calm and content as an undine floating in the still water of her pond.
: Write first, then read. So go write the last chapter. As soon as you’re ready, I’ll send you the link to mine. We can both be equally traumatized over submitting to the ordeal of being seen for our shitty first drafts.
“Stop this now,” Jack said, feeling Amara’s encouragement and doing his best to sound authoritative when all he wanted was to run to Cas and offer him comfort. “He doesn’t deserve this. And I’m here to fix everything I broke and fulfill our promise to let you go back to sleep.”
He sat there staring at his empty mug and his closed laptop with a growing sense of nervous anticipation. There really was no way for any of this to fall out on Cas, at least. Dean had given permission to Charlie to share his own contact information with the editor in case he needed to clarify anything for the article, but she hadn’t even given them Cas’s name. It was the very least he could do to protect Cas, even if any of this did somehow have fallout within the department.
“Wow, that really sucks, Cas,” Dean says, his frown growing into a hint of a smile. “But if you got Pamela on your side, you’re gonna be fine. She’s fucking terrifying.”
“This is all a little surreal,” Cas said as he slid under the spray. “Everything is backward from my room.”
Dean sputtered out a laugh. “Yeah, if I start telling anyone how I Dr. Phil’ed God and his sister, just punch me in the face or something.”
“Now he’s got my number, too,” Dean said. He’d been about to put his phone back in his pocket when it dinged in his hand. The reply read, “Thank you.”
“Um, yeah, so,” Sam says, and then clears his throat. “So Rowena offered to help explain the sciencey parts of this case to me. Then we’re gonna head out for lunch. Sorry I didn’t let you know, but it sorta came up last minute.”
“Unless they’re also staking the place out, even after they bothered to file for a filming permit, then probably not,” Sam assured him. “Are most of their videos similar to the one you sent us?”
Cas blinked up at him and then threw an arm around his neck and reeled him in for a kiss just before they both toppled over the edge, gasping and moaning their pleasure into each other’s mouths. When they were both thoroughly spent, Dean collapsed in a sweaty, panting heap atop Cas as Cas idly ran his hand up and down his back.
It was the most Cas had volunteered about his family, and Dean’s mouth seized on the logical follow up question before his brain could veto the suggestion. “Your dad’s a doctor too?”
They were closing in on their destination, and Dean wasn’t about to leave Cas hanging in his floundering state on their first day. He casually threw his arm around Cas’s shoulders and gave him a rousing jostle. “It’s okay. We got plenty of time to figure it all out. So are you gonna introduce me to these pastries you promised?”
He trails off, studying Cas for his reaction. Cas knows he’s just blinking, mouth open in shock, but Dean seems to take that as encouragement and pushes off the counter. He walks right up to Cas, sidestepping around him with a hand on his shoulder, guiding him toward the door. Cas assumes they’re going down to the shop, but Dean leads him down a hall and into his bedroom. He walks right over to his desk and opens a sketchbook to the image of an angel hanging in a heavenly sky, silhouetted by the too-large moon. It’s a slightly different image than the one Dean had sent him the other night, more detailed. Dean lets him look his fill, and then without another word flips to the first page in the book. The idea behind the image is the same, but it’s rough, and there’s no angel. That version of Heaven is empty but for the moon and stars.
“To be fair, that was my worst case scenario. What I feared, more than what I believed. So really, you never wondered about me outside of the fandom?”
Cas followed after him as they walked toward the library. A few frazzled parents sat at one of the tables letting their younger children page through picture books, most likely while their older siblings attended their classroom orientation with their other parent. One child’s mother looked up at Cas, contrite, and asked if it was okay that their children had removed a few books from the shelves. Cas nodded fondly.
Dean chuckled as Cas regained his balance and made a futile attempt to comb his unruly hair into submission with his fingers.
Dean snorted and grinned at him. “Okay, then you’re on my team,” he said as they walked right past the Impala to Cas’s big silver pickup truck.
“What were we supposed to say?” Dean replied with a shrug. “At first we didn’t want to say anything because it was weird and new and we were still figuring it out ourselves. Then we didn’t want to say anything because we were always running out for a hunt, and you were worried about Rowena, and we didn’t want it to be weird and uncomfortable, or a distraction. It didn’t seem like the sort of thing you just throw out there causally and then go chasing after monsters. It’s not casual, and it’s not something we’re ashamed of or trying to hide. It was just too important
Cas takes over unbuttoning his own shirt. “I think I should do that, or we might end up missing the rest of the party.”
“Mmmm, I’m really looking forward to it, then,” Cas replied, finally opening his eyes and grinning at Dean. “Seriously, this is delicious.”
“I think I got it under control. If this goes according to plan, I’ll be home by this time tomorrow.”
Gabriel’s implied drinking binge to drown their sorrows never comes to pass. He asks the bartender for the check after their second round of drinks, and Cas gives him a disbelieving look. Gabriel signs the receipt and pockets his credit card, but doesn’t miss Cas’s skeptical glance.
Dean chatted with a few of the teachers as they all milled around exchanging pleasantries, but eventually found himself drifting over toward Cas, who’d taken a seat in the very last row at the back of the room. He’d sat there, watching everyone else with a contented smile on his face. Dean sighed and slumped down in the chair beside him, and turned to Cas with a smile.
Donna shrugged. “No idea yet, but we’re gonna find out. It’s the only way we’re gonna get our lives back.” She looked eagerly at Dean and Cas. “And neither of you have any idea what it could be about?”
They managed to escape around lunch time long enough to pick up sandwiches in the cafeteria, only to receive texts from Jody and Cas from the Argentinian barbecue place they’d all been wanting to go to but never had the energy or time for after work.
Cas snorts. “There weren’t any available spots out front. I don’t think anything I did after leaving Gabriel’s can be chalked up to smart anything.”
“I wanted you in my life however you’d have me, and the stupidest thing of all is we probably wouldn’t be here right now if it hadn’t been for two obsessive nurses who wanted us for themselves so bad they tried to fuck over an entire hospital department to get us.”
“Couldn’t resist the allure of the stage?” Mildred asked with a smirk as she set a folder down on the podium and opened it to organize her own notes for the morning’s program. “It’s not quite karaoke night at the Drafthouse, but you’re far less likely to have beer nuts thrown at you here.”
“You’re gonna pick out a boring car that looks like every other boring car on the road, aren’t you,” Gabriel asks with a disappointed frown. “What happened to that cherry Mustang you were looking at last night?”
. There’s obviously something between them, and from the look on Cas’s face, he feels it too. He’s told Cas stuff that he’s never shared with anyone, including Sam, and he’s fighting down the turmoil churning in his gut that’s both begging Cas to just get it over with and touch him, while not wanting all of this to come crashing down over something as trivial as a tattoo he got when he was eighteen years old and too dumb to argue with some kook who thought he could see the future. He’s suddenly reminded of the message he’d sent Cas when he was half asleep.
Cas peels the rest of the bandage off and studies the dark, sharp lines of his tattoo still mostly obscured beneath a smear of goopy ointment. “My first lab partner in medical school accidentally stabbed me with a scalpel,” he says, leaning back to point out the barely visible white line of a scar on his side. “I wasn’t about to let that clumsy oaf stitch me up after that, so I did it myself. The professor was impressed with my tenacity. My lab partner didn’t fare quite as well. I believe he’s a mortician somewhere in Iowa now, or Idaho. Maybe Indiana.”
was her wingman, surely. He couldn’t even conceive of how the two of them could’ve met. Dean had only lived here for a few months, and he’d told Cas again and again that the only friend he’d had in town before he’d moved there was a woman named Charlie… Charlie, as in a nickname for someone named Celeste, or Charlotte. Like the Queen.
She smiled at him and raised an eyebrow. “You’ve been living with them like this for what, a decade? Did you really think they’d ever figure it out on their own?”
Cas had already seen his message, and even replied. There’s no reason to panic, at least not yet, right? He can always brush it off, tell Cas he didn’t mean anything by it, if he asks about it. He was mostly asleep when he sent it anyway. That’s a fair excuse, in case Cas doesn’t appreciate the-- maybe subconsciously intentional-- endearment. At least Cas hadn’t laughed at him for it, but he’d been mostly asleep at the time, too.
“Because you can!” Dean said, slamming his empty glass down a little harder than he’d intended before taking a deep breath and pouring himself and Cas each another measure. “Because maybe this isn’t what you signed up for when you hung up your halo. Because somewhere out there is someone who won’t argue with you about what kind of coffee to buy, who won’t drag you around the country killing monsters and sleeping in scuzzy fleabag motels and forcing you to try the pie at every crappy diner in America.”
Cas frowns at that. “That would’ve been highly unsanitary, and would’ve unnecessarily traumatized Gloria the cashier.”
Sam poked his head out of his room and pointed at a small door on the opposite wall. Dean gave him a dubious look, but went to check it out. Toilet, sink, mirror, and a clawfoot bathtub…
“It looks different now, somehow,” Cas added. “Smaller. Which is strange considering I was so much larger the first time I was here.”
He hears Sam and Rowena leave a little while later, finishes up the piece he’s working on for a client due in later that afternoon, and then heads downstairs to open up the shop. He doesn’t really have regular Sunday hours, but he usually tries to open up around noon anyway, even if he doesn’t make a fuss about it. Jody, Donna, and Claire have the day off, so it’s just him and the two clients he’s got on the schedule.
Dean gave him an awkward but genuine smile and nodded. “It’s a date, then.” He patted Cas on the shoulder as he walked by, and wished him a good night. It wasn’t until he was most of the way back to his room that he realized he’d actually said that out loud. And then the panic set in.
They stood for a moment longer, waiting impatiently as the indicator numbers ticked down to the ground floor so painfully slowly. When it finally dinged and the doors glided open, they carefully lumbered inside, Dean quietly hoping that they didn’t exceed the maximum weight limit of the elevator now. Cas struggled to raise his arm high enough to press the button for the second floor, and heaved a sigh of relief as the panel registered his selection and the doors wooshed shut.
Dean listened to their entire exchange, wondering if it might be time to put some of his buried truths out there. Well, not at that exact moment, but he thought back to waking up with Cas curled around him, and he was already looking forward to the end of the day when he could crawl back into bed with Cas again. It was definitely not the right time or place to let his mind wander that far into the future, but Cas’s words made him think he might not be alone on that particular train of thought. He cleared his throat and brought the conversation back around to their case.
Dean gives him another demonstration that leaves the mirror nearly as steamed up as their not-hot-enough shower did, and then pulls him back into the bedroom. He fishes out a couple pairs of flannel pajama pants and his oldest, softest t-shirt from his dresser. Dean tosses one pair of pants to Cas, who catches them and raises an eyebrow at Dean. Dean just shrugs at him.
Sam shook his head, but once again, Cas beamed at him while Ed watched on, taking mental notes. They ate in silence for a few minutes before Ed finally spoke up again.
In a fit of frustration, Dean pushed himself back from his desk and stood up. He snatched up his empty coffee mug and set out to wander the halls under the pretense of looking for a refill. Rather than heading directly to the staff room and it’s surprisingly decent coffee, he took the long route around the halls of the school. Mostly he was hoping inspiration would strike him out of the blue.
“Okay,” Dean conceded. Their lives had been anything but easy, and he couldn’t imagine any point where they honestly could’ve come to this moment sooner. It might’ve happened, but it wouldn’t have been anything like this. The universe may have kept throwing them together, but it had also had a nasty habit of tearing them apart again. Dean decided right there and then that the universe could go fuck itself for all he cared. They’d made their choices, and suffered the consequences, and finally everything had balanced out in their favor. “Sure, but we got a lot to make up for now.”
Cas thinks about that for a moment, shutting the laptop and standing up and stretching. “I think I’d like to walk, if it’s all the same to you.”
“So sunshine, you want some breakfast? We got a busy day of hunting something and not eating or drinking anything while we’re in town. We should fortify.”
“You’re not so bad yourself. You remember when we met and I just kinda stared at you like a total idiot?”
They’d never really seen Ed at his hunting best, but had to trust and assume that if he hadn’t gotten himself killed in the last six or seven years, then he probably wasn’t going to be a liability. Dean figured at the very least he was qualified to set up the tech stuff without putting all their lives in imminent danger. For the rest, he’d reserve judgment until after they all made it home safe again.
Dean smiles fondly at him and steps up into his personal space to finish sliding his tie off before undoing a few of his buttons. Cas sucks in a deep breath and then leans in to kiss Dean, pushing his hands away in the process. When he leans back, he’s smiling at the pleasantly dazed look on Dean’s face.
Cas stared at him over his slice of pizza and shook his head. “You may or may not have noticed, but I am not your little brother. I also went to med school, and I have been reliably informed that it would take a lot more pizza that we have on hand to accidentally administer a fatal dose.”
“So it’s really you?” Dean asked. “How the fuck did that even happen? How did we both end up in the same djinn dream?”
Dean frowns down at his phone. He really doesn’t know enough about what Cas is going through to be much use, but he says what he can.
Cas looks up from the sandwich in his hands, confused at the sudden shift in topics. Gabriel clarifies for him.
“I begged her not to mention any of that to you,” Cas assured him. “I didn’t want my feelings for you to negatively affect our relationship. She swore she’d keep it our secret.”
After setting his bottle of shampoo on the ledge in the shower, he couldn’t resist testing that water pressure Cas had mentioned any longer. He’d planned to at least finish unpacking before throwing in the proverbial towel. The promise of the luxury of a hot shower and a long nap after nearly a full day behind the wheel was too tempting, though, and unpacking everything else would probably go a lot smoother with a clear and well rested head. He had all the time in the world to organize himself now that he was there. With that thought, he pulled off his boots and socks and eyed his freshly made bed one more time before committing to washing off the dust of the road and the last twenty four hours first.
“It gets more difficult once school starts and a hundred children a day come through here rearranging everything, I suppose,” Cas said, reaching for another book.
A chill runs down Cas’s spine, and in a fit of panic, he shuts off his phone entirely, and then tosses it in his closet and slams the door, as if that will block the GPS signal more than switching the power off already did. There’s no way in hell he wants to be caught home alone by Nick, if he actually did manage to trace his location before he shut off the phone. Cas isn’t even sure that’s possible, and he’s about 90% sure he disabled the GPS tracking function in his phone anyway, but he’s not willing to take the chance that Nick knows some secret way around that now.
, out of place with no way to make it right. Three decades of pain and grief left behind by what I’d always believed were my own selfish choices, and nothing I ever did could fix any of it.”
The second group had been mostly his non-doctor friends who had no idea that a resident barely had a life at all outside the hospital, let alone a
“Good,” Dean says, swallowing hard and dropping his pants, kicking them out of his way and stepping into Cas’s space, nudging him backward toward the bed with his hands on his hips.
“This needs to change,” Cas said, completely breathless and flushed, but staring at Dean with an intensity he’d never seen before as he tugged at Dean’s shirt.
In a few short weeks, though, his entire life had been upended. He hadn’t once come home from work and holed up in his room alone. He hadn’t once gone out just to get out of the apartment for a few hours to have time to himself. Dean and Cas had effectively spent all their free time together, sharing the same activities, having all their meals together, and even showering at the same time so they could sing together through the thin wall between their respective bathrooms. What if Cas had had enough of all that togetherness?
He knows it sounds ridiculous, but it’s the truth, and he doesn’t bother trying to explain any further. Dean’s eyebrows jump at that revelation, but he smiles and Cas is almost sure Dean’s cheeks have gone a bit pinker than they were. Dean’s hand squeezes reassuringly down on his shoulder as he turns to glance back at his client. She pretends she hadn’t been trying to eavesdrop on their conversation, and Dean rolls his eyes as he focuses back on Cas.
Cas dropped his bags at the front door to their apartment with a sigh of relief and the excuse that someone needed to get the key out and unlock the door. Once inside, and finally completely unburdened, they began putting away their groceries and contemplating the future yet again.
He offered the man the best exhausted smile he could muster under the circumstances and shifted in his seat enough to offer his hand. “Dean Winchester, nice to meet you.”
“Yeah,” he replied slowly, trying to make sense of anything while too many disparate thoughts tumbled through his mind. As usual, it was food that he was finally able to latch on to. “Yeah, how about we order pizza and get cleaned up?”
“We’ve been dating for years, Dean,” Cas eventually said, with the same awe in his voice and in his eyes that Dean was feeling.
Jack looked down at his feet as the tentative hopes they’d both begun to harbor slowly circled just out of reach. They still had just a bit more work to do before they could even think of giving voice to those thoughts. He smiled up at Kelly and shrugged. “We’re working on it.”
Dean sighed, rubbing his hands over his face. The fact his feelings for Cas had seemed to steadily intensify after the last few days apart had only served to prove to Dean how real they were.
Jack watched Mary smiling at the memory version of himself, unaware back then that she’d felt so much fondness for him, that she’d begun to consider him her own. He knew in that moment he’d picked the right place to start, but he almost didn’t want to interrupt the tender moment, for his own sake as much as Mary’s.
Sam opened the door and glared at her as he got to his feet and she stepped quickly out of his way. “You did this? The other witch, the case? All of it?”
people,” Benny says, dropping his voice. “He’d taken in a new crop of residents every year, rent them rooms in his house, like your boy in there, and he’d pick a favorite. Mess with their mind, gaslight ‘em until they practically drove themselves off the rails.”
“We’re just us now. As far as we can tell, Amara is human, and I might be about as powerful as Rowena, but we’re both permanently cut off from cosmic power now. And so is the rest of creation. It’s a self-sustaining habitat now, but…” he looked to Amara again for encouragement, and she gave it with a little nod. “But we’re hoping that now that we’re both effectively human, that we might impose on your hospitality, at least until we figure out what to do with our lives.”
“So you don’t think every nurse in the department will have us figured out by the end of shift tomorrow?”
“I’d say that was enough praise to suggest going out for a round of celebratory drinks, but I don’t think I could drag myself farther than my bed right now,” Dean said, pushing off where he’d been leaning against a table and heading for the door.
They were actually taking a break from their GBBO marathon to have dinner when Sam finally called back. The connection wasn’t great, and it didn’t help that Sam sounded like he was fighting through a massive headache to talk.
“Good, because you ain’t even seen the cosplay shit yet,” Dean says shutting the closet behind him and redirecting Cas’s attention from it with a smirk. “So what do you feel like eating?”
Lorna looked as if she was considering marching over there and doing just that, but a tap on her shoulder from one of the cameramen, Zane, had her settling her ruffled feathers and giving Dean her best customer service smile.
Dean couldn’t help the laugh that bubbled out of him. “Cas. Feathers. Please, think about it. What have we sorta been doing for years now?”
“This is fine,” Sam replies, pulling the chair with his dinner closer and twisting around so it’s between his knees. “Would you mind getting me a glass of water, though?”
It was Dean’s turn to go quiet. Not only had he not really figured out what his feelings for Cas actually meant, the man in question was just in the next room and could theoretically hear anything he said. He lowered his voice even more and hoped Charlie could still hear him, and glanced down the hall to make sure Cas’s door was still shut. Dean took a deep breath and sighed, rubbing his eyes as he spoke.
“It’s impossible to tell if there’s any bruising through the black ink, but I think it’s safe to assume there will be some minor swelling after a fall severe enough to bring you to the emergency room.”
“You mean the blue car?” Cas asks, craning his neck around to look for the car. It definitely stands out among the sea of run of the mill cars, and he quickly spots it a few rows over. Someone’s bent over it, hands cupped to the window trying to get a better look inside. “It looks like it’s already got another admirer.”
Dean slowly released his grip on Cas and bent down to untie his boots, glancing up at Cas as he did.
“So you probably already know what I’m trying to say, here, right?” Dean said, bringing Sam’s attention back to him.
“I guess that’s as much as I can hope for,” Mary replied, giving him the same tone he’d heard Jody once refer to as her mom voice, as if she understood the turmoil of his current situation and the exact dilemma he and Amara were facing. “Just know that if you fly off to do God things and don’t remember to come home for family dinner at least once a week, it’ll probably annoy Dean to no end, and you know how he gets when people he cares about miss dinner.”
“No, your secrets are safe with Mr. Ramirez. He merely confirmed my guess as to your identity,” Crowley replied. “And in turn I entrusted him with my own role in putting you on the scent for the story in the first place.”
Cas turned and looked at the clock on the wall. It had finally passed midnight. He got up and went to the fridge, and pulled out a small white box pastry he’d hidden behind the beer. He slowly slid it on the table in front of Dean and then took his seat again. Dean looked up at him, confused.
“Jody and Donna will be fine on their own for a day,” Sam assures Cas. “Pamela expects Dean to be there anyway.” Again he turns to Dean and gives him a significant look. “She’s bringing Benny along with her.”
“I’m free! Thank you so much for that. If you hadn’t been here to stop it, I think I would’ve had to do something drastic, like stealing Dean’s car and going on the run. Anything to stop him and Cas from talking to each other for five minutes.”
As he pushes open the door to the staff room, fishing Dean’s card out of the pocket of his coat, he can’t help but smile at the one thing that seemingly went right today. Anael’s on her way out the door as he’s walking in, and she startles him out of his daze.
Cas didn’t move. After a moment, he asked quietly, “Is that what you think? That eventually something bad enough will happen and I’ll be convinced that I’ve made a terrible error?”
Cas frowns and grumbles out a sigh. “I’m not entirely satisfied with that plan, but it seems like the best we can do for now.”
“The only way the supremely rich ever get stopped from doing anything,” Charlie replied cheerfully. “Bad PR.”
Dean risked a glance over at him, keeping his gaze firmly at head height and not allowing himself to peek any lower. Cas was still frozen in place, looking a bit deer-in-the-headlights as well. “That worked out great, since we’re both here now.”
Cas shook his head as they reached their building. He unlocked the door and held it open for Dean. “I didn’t feel right about prying. She was practically in tears as it was. I figure we’ll know soon enough. The new schedule goes into effect on Friday.”
He drove to his favorite little Irish pub and ordered a shepherd’s pie and a beer. It was about as different an environment he could find from his bright, cheerful library, and it always helped him relax. If he kept Impala waiting a little longer while he shed the burdens of his day job, it would be worth it. By the time he’d paid his check and headed home, he was ready to face whatever Impala would bring him.
“Jack, you know you’re always welcome here. This is your home, too. You’re family, and you don’t gotta ask if you can have your old room back, okay?”
Cas frowns and tries to think back over every conversation he’s ever had with the man, and draws a blank. Thankfully, Gabriel answers at least one of Pamela’s questions for him.
“So if Charlie knows you through the fandom, you must be close with her in order for you to spend your free time with her. And you just admitted to writing fic, so you’re likely one of the regulars in our writing discussions.”
The Who were the better band of that era. For Dean, it wasn’t as much about the music as it was everything that had made him the person he was. It had felt more like an insult to his entire identity. He wasn’t sure he could handle it if Cas said anything so brazen about his collection.
“Hey Cas, chicken’s cooking. Don’t touch anything until at least 6 pm. Called to work. If I’m not back by then, bon appetit. PS the rest of the groceries are in the trunk of my car. Mind bringing them in? Dean”
“This is just as good the next day,” he said, poking at a plantain with his fork. “We seriously owe Maricella flowers or something for recommending that place.”
Dean had flipped a coin the previous day for who got the bed and who was resigned to the admittedly comfortable sofa beside the fire, so Cas wasn’t surprised to find himself tucked beneath the down quilts on the bed in the far corner of the cabin’s only room, even if he couldn’t remember exactly how he’d gotten there. He called out to Dean, but got no reply, and so he cautiously climbed out of bed, blinking away a bit of wooziness as he got his balance. He stood in stocking feet on the braided wool rug beside the bed, feeling a little chill and already missing the fluffy quilt. His t-shirt and flannel pants weren’t enough to keep him warm that far from the fire.
, and dismisses it instead. It rings again only seconds later, and again he dismisses the call. A minute later, a voicemail notification chimes and despite being fairly certain he doesn’t want to hear whatever Nick has to say, he knows he must. He pushes play on the message with a sinking sense of dread.
: How about you, you’ve never been to a con, but from reading this I believe you have some experience with horse ranching, which I hadn’t expected.
Dean had barely made it back to the kitchen when the oven timer dinged, and their pizza was ready. Out of sight, out of mind, or that’s how it seemed to go. They settled on the sofa and let the television play quietly in the background while they largely ignored it in favor of talking about anything and everything other than Dean’s poster collection. It hadn’t even been awkward, and Cas had been true to his word. He hadn’t seemed offended in the least, happy to carry on chatting about various coworkers and ridiculous patient stories both recent and in what now seemed like their distant past from their respective previous lives. They talked about their plans for the following day, and for the following weekend, as Dean began scheduling out a week’s worth of dinners for them that didn’t involve quite so much takeout now that they had a fully stocked pantry.
Cas nodded at him as if he understood exactly what Dean meant. “I did, as well. And then I checked the calendar. I assume you know what today is?”
“A ruptured appendix waits for no man,” Gabriel says. “It’s all good. Mildred filled me in. And speaking of being filled in, I’m kinda in the mood for donuts.”
Gabriel nods and turns back to the computer, but continues talking while he types. “So if you give him notice you’re terminating today, since it’s already November, you either still owe him next month’s rent, or you can walk on your deposit?”
: Oooooh! Are you gonna tell him all about your sexy librarian? If you do, let him know I’ve got dibs on the novelization.
Sam lowers his eyes and slumps down in his chair. “I didn’t ditch her. I called her this morning and we rescheduled for tomorrow.”
Dean still looked disappointed, frowning slightly even as he nodded his acceptance. “Okay, I can live with that. But don’t let yourself get all broody and weird sitting home alone all day. I’m always on call for emergency writer paranoia, if you need a friendly ear to chew for a while.”
“Probably wing it,” Ed replied with a nervous laugh. “Show up and pretend it was entirely coincidental that I was making a documentary about the ley lines in the area or something.”
And with that, Cas logged off, shut his laptop, and laid his head back against the cushions. He’d only known Dean three days, and he’d only begun pushing his boundaries with Impala for the same amount of time. How the hell had his life become so complicated in less than a week?
Amara gave him a fond smile and hooked her arm through Jack’s. “So, tell me all about this Crunch Cookie Crunch.”
They spent most of dinner talking about what to order for the rest of the week, until they had a chance to get to the grocery store and stock up on what Dean called
“No pics of your family?” he asked, the smile slipping off his face as he turned back to Cas. Dean hurried to try and make his intrusive question seem less awkward. “You know, you as a kid, something to keep you from getting homesick?”
“Dean, what’s wrong?” Donna asks, standing up from the little table. Jody’s by her side in an instant.
“Yeah, I don’t think she would, but it was too much to ignore the connection between them,” Jody agreed.
Wulf nodded. “Not so much a letter, as a book. Billie looked at mine and read my ending. Turns out destiny can be rewritten.”
This attitude didn’t win over Lorna, but earned him a tiny smile from Wulf. Of course that would amuse the creepy dude in the black turtleneck with the ornate silver cross hanging around his neck. Lorna sputtered at him for a moment before finally composing herself and taking a different tack. She straightened her shoulders and came at him like a lawyer, which Dean did his best not to laugh at considering she was five foot nothing and dressed like she shopped exclusively at the Hot Topical’s post-Halloween clearance bin.
They’d had their standing lunch dates, and their standing brunch dates, but neither of them had actually called their relationship what Dean suspected it was growing into. Sure, he could use the distraction of an afternoon walking around town with Cas, occasionally pausing to have a few drinks and some light snacks to take his mind of Pinefest claims, but he’d also been quietly hoping to turn the excursion into a real date. If Cas was amenable to that, of course.
Ed shrugged. “Mostly. My sister helps out with research occasionally, and I’ve teamed up with other hunters here and there. Still got the camera equipment, though.  You would not
“So I’m gonna get to work on this, but I expect more frequent updates on your thrilling social life.”
Dean finally tore his eyes from his own hands white-knuckling on his knees and saw the fear and confusion and hope on Cas’s face. Maybe everything wasn’t going to hell in a handbasket. Maybe he needed another drink to cope with this revelation in case this was just one last push up the hill before it all went careening over the cliff. He grabbed the fresh bottle off the table, cracked the seal on the cap and took a swig before handing it to Cas. As long as they were swimming in shark infested waters, he might as well start paddling. It’s not like this conversation could prove any more devastating than he’d already expected.
“So, you’re not part of the technical crew?” Dean asked. “You leave the sciencey stuff to the nerds?”
Dean shrugs a little uncomfortably. He’d dismissed the entire notion when Mick first explained his idea for the handprint, but that hadn’t stopped him from going through with it. He’s always wondered if anyone’s hand actually matched perfectly. If nothing else, it had made for some interesting conversations over the years, and more than a fair few disappointed lovers who felt slighted when their hand didn’t quite match up. So he’s both terrified and weirdly hopeful when Cas keeps looking him right in the eye.
“He offered to tattoo me,” Cas says, holding up the card. “I suppose that qualifies as a date in some circles.”
He pulled out his phone and sent her a completely non urgent text, asking her to give him a call when she got a chance. He received a reply a few minutes later that read only
“But,” Sam says loudly cutting Dean off. “I think you really like him, so you have my stamp of approval. Flirt away.” Sam holds up a finger before Dean can object. “Under the condition that I’m not directly subjected to any of your weird mating rituals. Got it?”
“The sacrifices we make for art,” he says, holding a soapy hand up and waiting for Cas to give his permission.
: It hardly seems fair you’ll get an hour or two head start on editing yours, but I accept your terms nonetheless.
“So this isn’t awkward, or anything…” Dean started, checking one last time that he and Cas were even in the same book, let alone on the same page.
The two women were stirring now that the djinn was dead. Dean gave him a little nod, and they finished what they’d set out to do. They administered the antidote to speed the womens’ recovery long. The moment they were both freed, they pushed past Dean and Cas and ran to one another, embracing like they were holding on for dear life.
Dean’s fear that Sam would not take this specific curse well after his history of demon blood-related psychic trauma. Cas’s fear that Sam would simply be overwhelmed by psychic information and suffer as a result of the sheer volume of thoughts assaulting him from all sides. Yeah, they both worried about him, and in a strange way, it actually warmed his heart and bolstered his spirits. But there were other thoughts, as well. Thoughts that he really, really wished he hadn’t been forced to overhear. It was bad enough that he’d been watching their…
“Great,” Dean replies, and then taps a finger on her license. “Stick that thing up on the wall with ours and you can run the front desk today.”
“Just put them back on the cart by the circulation desk when you’re finished, and I’ll reshelve them for you.”
Sam shrugged a little awkwardly. “I’m sure we’ll figure it out, reverse the spell. Or maybe it’ll just wear off on its own.”
“Nah, dude was married. He’d meet his wife there and the two of them would do this whole intense workout every damn day. He used to rave about it. Dragged me there once.”
Sam looks up from his paperwork, then glances at Mildred just in time to accept his cards back from her. She gives Cas a fond smile and then turns a professionally blank face on Sam.
They lay there for a long moment, Dean’s forehead resting against Cas’s, eyes closed until their hearts slowed and they could breathe again. He opened his eyes to find Cas studying him with wonder. Dean tried to slide off of him, out of the sticky mess cooling between them, but Cas held him there and refused to let go. Dean was okay with that plan, too.
As Cas unlocked the door, Dean stood behind him, shifting around anxiously. Once they were inside, Cas kicked off his shoes, shuffled over to the sofa and flopped down like all the air had been let out of him. Dean stood in the entryway watching him with a fond smile. Maybe there wasn’t anything to be nervous about. After removing his own shoes, he headed toward the hallway before turning around to catch Cas watching him.
“Nah,” Benny says easily. “After Pamela called me yesterday and told me it was for your new beau, Andrea practically shoved me out the door.”
He sat up with a groan and glanced over at the clock. Quarter to ten, and whoa. He wasn’t sure how late it had been when he’d fallen asleep, but by all accounts, if Sam hadn’t stopped overnight to sleep off his weird curse, he’d probably be home any time now. And Dean had no fucking clue what was up with him and Cas anymore.
He closed his eyes and concentrated for a moment, and Amara appeared beside him. She patted herself down, checking to make sure she was all there, and then grinned at Jack.
“I don’t think I’ve thrown a party of any kind since my ninth birthday,” Cas replied, deadpan. “My father hired a clown, and one of the children spent the entire party locked in the bathroom refusing to come out until the clown left.”
Charlie grinned at him. “You could just keep carrying on like you have been, and try to keep your fandom life secret from Cas, and your real life secret from Feathers. No risk, no reward, though. Nothing would change, and you’d probably continue being miserable over all of it.”
“You might as well come to us, then. It’ll save you having to sleep in your van, at least. I’ll text you the address, and we’ll meet you outside. Parking’s a little tricky.”
Cas sucked in a shocked breath of air and blinked at him for a moment, before a grin broke across his face, lighting up the gloomy, dusty haze in the barn. “I love you too, Dean. I’m so glad I’m here with you.”
Cas laughs outright at that. “So you’re definitely brothers, I see. But Mildred will still need your ID to generate a visitor’s pass for you.”
Dean snorted at that. Neurosurgeon comedy tickled Charlie’s funny bone. It was fun catching up with her, though. She brought him up to speed on all the news from home, as it were. He wondered when he’d started thinking of LA as home, and wondered how long it would take before Miami felt like home to him. Probably longer than he’d like if he didn’t get their schedule mess sorted. So far, only Cas had really felt like home there, and he’d already lost that part of his life less than three weeks after finding it.
Cas swallowed, nodding slowly as he worked through this. “So even if my fumbling efforts are disappointing in light of your fantasy scenarios and prior experience, you won’t regret having crossed this line with me?”
“It won’t,” Dean said with a shrug and a cheeky grin. “We’re gonna make enough for them to have for lunch tomorrow.”
Cas didn’t reply right away, and for a minute or two Dean worried that he’d actually grown impatient and gone out for a drive anyway. He’d probably be fine if he didn’t go too far, but Dean let it go and gobbled down the rest of his lunch before rushing back to work.
Jack patted her hand, smiling gratefully at her and nodding. “Thank you for that, but I can admit I was at least in some way responsible for what happened.”
“Next weekend I think we should find a home store with a garden section, and set up an herb garden on the balcony,” Cas replied, looking over the variety of fresh herbs Dean had bought at the grocery store. “We could save a lot of money, and have fresher ingredients on hand if you’re going to be cooking like this all the time.”
