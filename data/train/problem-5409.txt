Anyone else could have come here, told me this and it would have been fine. But you, you of all people - the great Pretender - being here is too much. Collecting heros in you tower to make up for for your lack of heroism. Acting like you belong, acting like everything is right. It's not.
. The furniture was all wood and everything was done in soft muted browns, greens and blues. It was simple but elegant. It was exactly what he wanted if he had the time to do it himself. He was glad to find that the bed was reinforced with steel. He checked by bouncing on the edge of it for a bit. He watched as the movers placed the boxes just outside the elevator.
Jet was not looking forward to today. He figured by now Thor's friends would be in town. He really was not looking forward to meeting them. He did not want to get his hopes up. He did not want to let them down as well. He figured their friend must be really important if they were going to be driving down to see if he was actually the person Thor thought he was. The strangest thing about all this was the fact that the man called him 'Man of Iron', but never by the name of his friend. It was strange, but even stranger was that he had no desire to look up anything about the man. He did not want learn anything before today. The man was strange enough, with his peculiar way of speaking and mannerism. And what was with the hammer?
"I will give you this one pass, Rogers. But that's it. Stark is part of the team and that means that you respect him like you would any other solider. If you continue down this path…well Bruce, Pepper and I will have to sit you down and have a long talk about Tony. I can guarantee you once we are finished, you will feel only regret and guilt." Natasha spoke in an even tone, as if she was speaking about the weather. He swallowed and nodded in agreement. He wasn't sure as to what they could say that would make him regret his words. But he wasn’t one to cross Natasha. She could likely figure out a way to overcome his increased healing ability. He walked slowly towards the flight deck to catch his flight. To say he felt even more like an outsider was an understatement. Everyone was siding with Tony. Everyone was protecting Tony. Where did he fit in if he didn't fit in with the Avengers?
Jet was elbow deep in a truck, working on it's shotty motor. Seriously, people needed to learn how to take care of their cars. It didn't help that his upper arms hurt and his back. But that was his fault. He had been mean in his words and it made sense that Zac would snap like that. Zac was right, he was stupid sometimes. He couldn't do anything right. But he couldn't let the man touch the thing in his chest without fighting tooth and nail to get Zac off him. It had led to a vicious fight and many...many bruises. In the end they decided not to talk about it. Their relationship was too young to get into the emotional crap. Jet knew they were using each other. Jet was using Zac's looks to make himself feel...something. He felt more when he was with Zac than he did alone. At least it was a semi-happy feeling. Not the crazed and scared feeling he got when he was alone. He did not feel safe, except when Zac was there. He felt a little safer with the blond. He could not explain it, but he did.
But he did notice the change in Tony’s expression when he mentioned Howard’s name. “You weren’t close to him, were you?” he asked.
The genius was completely in shock. Not because he didn’t want this, this is all he wanted for the past two years. He just didn’t think that Steve would want to spend the rest of his life with him.
When he regained his composure he said flippantly, “Donate the shield to the Smithsonian, I’m sure they’ll go crazy over it, and keep the body safe from prying eyes as to protect the serum.”
He channeled all the mind power he had left to connect with his soulmate. He was unsuccessful. That’s when he felt tears rolling down his eyes. How worse could his life go?
“Ah, hey Tony, it’s good to hear your voice.” Steve said with a certain gentleness that made the genius forget all about his previous worries.
“It’s okay, I’ll take the stairs.” he replied heading for the communal floor. After a little more than an hour he went to the terrace. Tony was sitting there alone with slumped shoulders, looking down. The blond carefully sat next to him. Now that he was closer enough, he could tell his boyfriend had been crying. It broke his heart to see his lover like that.
responsible. Anyway, he came over today to check out the new compound. Did I tell you I’m making a new compound? It’s really nice. So, I showed the kid around and he was so fascinated. Then I took him up my lab and I swear to God, that kid’s a genius. He even helped me to solve a problem with Widow’s bites!” he started rambling.
Morgan furrowed her eyebrows comically. “But what about your new friends?” she asked in a tad more demanding tone.
“They can take care of each other and they can protect you and everyone else from the bad guys out there too, don’t worry.” he cut her off.
“I-I can’t-“ Tony said suddenly. His hands shaking were shaking. “Can’t fix it- I thought I knew how to but I can’t-“ he stammered.
Steve felt a sharp pain in his heart, realizing Tony may have felt the same after all. Despite everything Steve had done to him, after betraying him,
“Well, I finally finished my first PhD and I just applied for my second, so I’ll see where that takes me. I brought home many of the SI designs I’ve been working on and I’ll probably have them finished by-“
Admittedly, Steve seemed to be having fun chatting with his friends and doing Clint’s ridiculous dares. Tony hadn’t seen him this happy in a long time.
He had classes all day, so he felt pretty much dead. While going to his bed he noticed Rhodey had already fallen asleep face first into the mattress. He chuckled thinking the other guy probably just dropped on the bed, when he came home. Tony felt like doing the shame.
“I was trapped in the ice and around me I could see everyone I lost. My mum, Peggy, The Howling Commandos, Bucky, Erskine, Howard. But I couldn’t do anything because I was trapped and it was cold, so cold.” Steve mumbled.
The use of the word ‘futuristic’ confused the boy. He did make more advanced stuff, but he wouldn’t really use that term. Steve must have seen a robot again; at least on the news. Nevertheless, he decided not to comment on it.
There was this idiot, who for some reason decided he was smart enough to go to a physics event and had the audacity to disagree with Pe-the Kid’s point. He said that gravitational force was stronger than nuclear? Can you even believe it? His argument was that no creature can disobey the laws of gravity. Ridiculous, right?
This isn’t the end for him, it isn’t the breaking point. He has been through hell and back, he fought the fight of his life and survived. That’s what he is, a survivor. Because no matter what life threw onto his plate, no matter the struggles, he always managed to survive, adjust to the change.
“I’m very glad you have your soulmate to help you get through these hard decisions, Anthony. You know you can always come to me for any problem you might face. I’m relieved you got rid of that toxic man, as you deserve the best and that’s definitely not him then.” he said never taking his eyes off his cooking.
Thankfully, a few moments later Maria opened the door. She looked down at the broken glass, then quickly checked Tony for any injuries and turned to her husband.
He hardly ate, he hardly slept and he felt like a piece of him was missing. Now he fully understood what having a soulmate meant. It’s a constant warmth in your heart, a feeling of security, the belief you’re cared for. It’s the first ray of sun on a cloudy day, the feeling of a wave grazing your feet in the sand.
He figured alcohol couldn’t numb his feelings at this point. He just wanted to feel nothing, was it too much to ask for? He just wanted to will the pain away, to stop hurting, but he couldn’t ‘cause they were dead and he just couldn’t-
And then Natasha, beautiful strong willed Natasha with a heart bigger than she let people see. She gave without taking and had become one of his closest friends in this century. His heart ached with the loss of the two people he loved very dearly, each one in a different way.
“I was never the person to show up to galas and shows. I remember feeling so uncomfortable during the USO tour. But I’m okay with it. It’s just-“ he took a deep breath and then continued. “I see all those people dancing inside and I remember- There was this girl, Peggy. Right before I fell into the ice I promised her to take her out to dance.” he said.
But instead he said “If I remember correctly, you’re half Italian, so maybe you can help me with that last one.”
“So, during those times I go up here and I look at the night sky, because many things may have changed in this century, but this hasn’t. Maybe the buildings are taller now and the air is more polluted, but I couldn’t really see the stars back then either and that’s kind of comforting.”
“I get nightmares that I accidentally killed you.You know, when I hit your arc reactor with my shield. That you are dead and it’s all my fault. That your blood is on my hands. I killed you. I did that. I-“ Tony could hear Steve clearly hyperventilating.
Tony didn’t even recall getting out of his bed and running into the bathroom. He sat down, back slumped against the door. He put his elbows to his knees and held his head between his legs.
Tony felt his blood freeze. How old was Steve? If he died when he was twenty five then he was dead long before Tony was even born. How was that possible?
“I send you to a goddamn boarding school and you can’t even be on the top 3? What am I even paying for?”
He hadn’t told his parents about him, scared to face their reactions. Howard would have probably announced it on the news or some shit, just for the good publicity. Although he sure as hell wouldn’t be pleased his son had a male soulmate. So, definitely not telling his parents any time soon. His mother maybe... one day.
His mind had completely blanked. 1918. Even if Steve was alive today he would have been 70 years old. What the everloving fuck.
“I-I had a fight with Steve a couple of weeks ago and I... I had my reasons to be mad, but I think I was more cruel than I should have been.” he admitted closing his eyes in shame.
“Tony..” he said nervously. The smaller man just hummed for him to continue, his sole focus on the sight before him.
“Fourth place? Are you fucking kidding at me?” Howard spat out and pointed his whiskey bottle towards his son.
. Tired of always fighting a war, of using it as a coping mechanism as to not deal with his problems. He has grown and he has finally made a man out of himself.
Tony couldn’t help but feel flattered. He knew the Captain cared only for his father, but still; his childhood hero reading articles about him? It felt like a dream come true.
He walked out of the ballroom to the balcony and stopped in front of the railing next to Steve. For a moment they just stood there and even though they never were really close, the silence was surprisingly comfortable. Steve closed his eyes when a little breeze passed by to savor the feeling. He looked tired, Tony noticed.
At one point the song switched to Thunderstruck and Tony started dancing all around the workshop, head banging and mouthing the lyrics. With incredulous dance moves he went towards Steve, who was laughing with an adoring look in his eyes.
“Steve?” His head was buzzing from confusion. How was Steve alive, he died in World War 2. Steve is Captain Ame-ohh okay so many more things do make sense then.
Suddenly, he got jarred out of his thoughts by a little tug he felt on his pants, somewhere near his thigh. He looked down and saw little fingers grasping one leg of his dress pants firmly.
He just sat next to him and put his arm around Steve’s shoulders as to provide him some more warmth. Steve leaned his head on Tony’s shoulder.
He felt anger boiling hot in him. How dare he say what Tony should and shouldn’t do? He’s smart and old enough to make decisions for himself.
“I never got to tell her goodbye.” Bucky said, his voice breaking and tears collecting in his otherwise serious eyes.
“I still get nightmares about everything too; Bucky falling, The Commandos, the ice. Sometimes I wake up thinking I’m still in the 40s. I even make JARVIS tell me the date every morning, just to make sure this wasn’t all just a twisted dream” Steve huffed.
"Holy shit it's you!" Tony exclaimed before the rest of Steve's sentence caught up with him. "Excuse you, I'm pretty sure I'm the one winning right now."
Steve quickly opened the ring box back up, showing Peter the ring once again. Like always, Peter looked at the ring in awe and ran his finger over the diamonds. Once Peter took his hand away, he opened his mouth to say something, although he never got to say what because the screen door to the cabin was being pulled open.
Figuring it had to be Steve coming to pick up his cake, Tony tried to put on a happy face and boxed up the cake before walking out towards the front.
Tony just looked down at their sleeping boy, nothing but contentment, happiness, and love spreading all throughout his chest.
It took a while before Tony’s brain caught up. All day he had thought that Steve was asking someone else out and all along it had been him? Steve wanted to date
"Yeah, yeah I would love that. But let's make things a bit more interesting. The winner gets to pick our first date." Tony says, his heart stuttering when Steve smiled as wide as possible at him.
"We did good, right? Like he seemed genuinely happy and no longer upset about missing the trip?" Steve asks.
"I know it might have been an invasion of privacy, but there was one day a few weeks ago that I had come in here with the courage to finally ask you out face to face. Of course, Rhodes was in here instead of you, so I couldn't actually ask you out. I had tried to walk out of the bakery in hopes that he wouldn’t see me, but that didn’t quite work out and he caught me,” Steve rambles on and on, Tony listening and trying to take it all in.
“Wow, that’s amazing. I’m an artist myself, actually, I do a lot of art commissions, so seeing something done differently like this, it’s incredible.” Steve compliments, trying to hide his smirk to himself when the bartender ducked his head again.
"What's on your mind, Little Bug?" Steve asks once he realizes that Peter wasn't going to come right out and say it.
That's what caused Tony to look down at the chessboard sitting on the coffee table, staring at what looked like an abandoned game. It had to abandon, there wasn't even a check or checkmate sitting there.
Steve was having the time of his life, being able to teach Peter all of these new things. He loved watching how excited the little boy got when he took him fishing for the first time - although it didn't end well when Peter realized that they were going to have to eat the fish afterward - and how the boy's eyes lit up with wonder when Steve taught him how to make smores for the first time.
"Yes, I know who he is. His name is Steve, he's an artist and does commissions for a living, he's currently on a business trip, and he's desperately single." Peter informs.
Everything about the bar and about Tony seemed to intrigue Steve, and he couldn't resist coming back for more.
"See, I told you. Sometimes I think he does it on purpose. I can't tell you how many ill-suited times he's wanted to be fed." Tony light-heartedly grumbles as Sarah begrudgingly hands the baby back over.
The whole time they were walking down the pathway to the falls, Steve couldn't get out of his head. A million different thoughts were racing through at the moment.
All during that time, Tony and the stranger continued to pass notes along to each other. At first, it was just to talk about the game, but then it slowly grew into more.
"Hey, don't give me that look. You're the one who offered to work the night shift." Peter says while throwing his hands up in a placating gesture.
Sarah couldn't help but watch with a fondness as Steve helped Tony get situated so he could begin feeding Peter. She has never felt more proud for the man Steve had become than she did right there at that moment.
It was almost a month later and their game was still going on, with Tony only managing to get one check before the stranger was able to move his rook in protection.
"Waterfalls? Like the ones from Peter Pan?" A tiny, groggy voice chimes in, making both men look over at the other bed that contained the slowly waking toddler.
"Well, possibly soon. I mean, we have been practicing so." Steve blurts out nonchalantly, making Tony spit out the bite of his soup that he had just taken.
Steve didn’t know what he was expecting, but it sure as hell wasn’t what he actually saw when they bursted into a bedroom.
"Petey, the answer is still the same answer I gave you five minutes ago. What’s got you so antsy back there?” Tony questions, getting an exasperated huff out of the toddler. Lord help them when he becomes a teen.
Fortunately, Steve was distracted from the awkward feeling when Peter began coughing and all the attention was promptly put onto him.
Once they finally managed to pull away again, Steve grabbed Peter and tugged him into their hug, causing the little boy to giggle.
Tony truly was interesting, and Steve loved being able to talk to him in between other customers. And yet, every time Steve learned more information about Tony, the more he felt the bartender was a complete mystery.
"I know you're having a tough time, and I know you really wanted to go out with all of your classmates to have fun, but I promise, Papa and I will make it up to you. But you have to get better first, okay?" Tony continues, Peter actually managing to calm down and nod his head.
Tony sighed loudly and dramatically as he stared at the empty coffee shop, the noise settling in the air unheard.
Soon after, all three of them went ring shopping while Pepper kept Tony busy at work, and both Rhodey and Peter helped him pick out the ring that they all felt Tony would love the most.
It had been a week since the stranger had played him back in chess and Tony was beginning to get bummed out about it. So much so, that Peter even began noticing it whenever they saw each other in passing.
Tony had just finished the cake and was contemplating smashing it when he heard the bell on the entrance door ring.
"You do realize you ask a lot of questions and that you could have the answer to them all if you just wait for a few seconds, right?" Steve teases, smirking as he finally pulled out a lighter and began lighting the candle on the cake.
Not only did Steve think he was attractive, but he wanted to get to know him better! It was something straight out of a movie, Tony was sure.
"Oh, yeah? Well, how about, if you and Steve are both good, I'll take you boys out for ice cream? Does that sound good?" Tony offers, chuckling when Peter cheered at the idea and ran straight for the car.
”Nope. No one else I would rather be with.” Steve reassures, sending a heart-melting smile Tony’s way.
"Well, hello young man, what would you like to eat today?" Steve asks once they walked up to the cardboard stand that they had made, a fake menu stapled to the side of it.
"No. Me and Steve are making breakfast." Peter sternly says, stunning Tony into silence. When Tony glanced over to Steve, Steve made sure to shrug, hoping that Tony won't question it too much. If he did, Steve couldn't go over the game plan with Peter, and that could lead to a disaster like having the whole surprise blown.
Steve couldn't help but look over his shoulder one more time, smiling at the sight of the sleeping toddler before turning back towards Tony and taking in his sleeping face also.
“Here, Tony, go call 9-1-1, tell them I’ve already started CPR,” Steve instructs, already going into action and starting chest compressions.
“Yeah, I did, actually. It was just one of those ‘spur of the moment' things and it’s actually helped me a lot. Whenever I need to, I can just look at it and it’ll put my mind at ease.” The bartender explains.
Steve didn't even bother breaking the silence until he felt his phone vibrate in his pocket, signaling that their plan was officially in motion.
"Alright, then, let's go to our own personal star building," Tony says, allowing Steve to scoop Peter up before they began to make their way up to the roof.
"We see, Bambino. Isn't this so cool? Now you get to have your own persona; zoo. And whenever you're ready, we can go inside and go to the concession stand just like you would at a real zoo, how does that sound?" Tony says, effectively amping up Peter's excitement levels even more.
"Because this whole pining thing you're doing isn't it," Peter says, getting an affronted squawk in return.
“Nice to meet you, Steve. I hope to see you around here again sometime.” The bartender says before beginning to walk down towards the other end of the bar.
They both made their way into what appeared to be an apartment - which was where Tony probably lived when he wasn’t running the bar - Steve blindly following Tony into one of the bedrooms there.
"So, uh... I was going to do this while we were having our picnic by the water, but seeing you in front of this beautiful sight with Peter, I'm seeing my entire world and I couldn't wait any longer. These past couple of years have been
"Morning." Steve returns the greeting, not caring about morning breath and pulling Tony in for a kiss after.
"You're silly, Papa." Peter giggles, "I would like soup and popcorn." Peter declares as if those weren't the only two things on the menu.
The next couple of minutes were spent with Steve getting both him and Peter dressed for the day while also gathering everything they needed to make breakfast. Steve couldn't keep the butterflies out of his stomach as much as he tried to.
Today was supposed to be Peter's very first field trip at school. The little boy had been talking non-stop about it to both of his Dads for weeks.
Sure enough, Steve was standing at the front desk with a wide smile on his face, looking as dashing as ever.
"Uhh, well, there probably won't be mermaids at the waterfalls we're going to because it's freshwater. Mermaids have to live in saltwater." Steve says, hoping that Peter was still young enough to not realize him talking straight out of his ass.
Deciding not to dwell on it any longer, Tony decided to get back to his nightly cleaning ritual in an attempt to forget it all. The stranger would probably be back tomorrow anyway.
"He's- They're taking him away. I gotta- I gotta go with him." Tony weakly points out, slowly wiggling out of Steve's arms.
Shrugging, Tony began moving some of the pieces around so that there was a checkmate was in place and smiled when it seemed to scratch the itching sensation in his brain.
Every time someone would walk into the shop with similar characteristics as what the stranger told him about, Tony would get beyond excited thinking that this was it; that he was about to meet the stranger and they would be able to go on a date and be happy together.
"And that's what I'm here for. To help you and Tony out. And to also get my own fill of baby cuddles in. If anything I'm just bribing you both with food so I can get Peter all to myself." Sarah continues to tease, smiling even more to herself when she could physically see the tension begin to bleed out of her son.
Even though she had to listen to her son ramble on and on about his sex life just to prove a point to his husband.
Tony stared at the board longer than needed, just to make sure there wasn't a move that he accidentally missed somehow. He even went so far as to check the picture on his phone; he suggested a while ago that the both of them start taking pictures of their moves just in case someone messed with the board so they could move everything back to how it was before.
"Sorry, we got a bit distracted." Steve apologizes, making sure to give a half-truth. Tony always knew when he was lying and, even though he technically was lying by keeping secrets, it made him feel slightly better and made him seem not so obvious this way.
"Alright, now, if you both will follow me," Tony says, opening up the gate and leading everyone to the backyard.
Out of all the shitty birthdays Tony has had, having to make something for his crush to use to ask someone else out really takes the cake; pun fully intended.
excited! Daddy, are we there yet?" Peter once again questions, thankfully distracting Tony enough to give Steve a bit of breathing room.
"We appreciate it beyond belief. Not that I would change it for anything in the whole world, but getting through this past month has been the hardest thing I've ever had to do." Steve sighs, plopping down at the kitchen table and allowing the comforting smell of his mother's cooking settle him.
Thankfully, EMTs quickly began to swarm into the room, all of them pushing Steve aside so they could get to the boy.
"I don't know, Bug, why don't you read it and find out." Steve nudges, watching with amusement as Peter began to slowly sound out the word written up at the top.
"Don't tell me you were in your usual 'La La Land' again." Peter teases, grabbing his apron and putting it on as he walked behind the counter.
Cringing as a shrill cry filled the house, Steve quickly ran to the front door to answer it while Tony ran upstairs to get Peter.
"So, when do you two plan on giving me another grandchild." Sarah jokes, watching as Tony scoffed and began eating with his free hand, Peter tucked firmly into his other arm.
“Are you usually this plain and boring in real life?” Tony asks, leaning forward on the bar with his elbows.
"What the fuck, Steven?" Tony wheezes out once he was able to stop coughing and choking long enough to speak.
"Petey, I know you're upset, but you've got to calm down, Bug. You're making yourself feel worse." Tony gently says, his heart breaking right in two when Peter let out a particularly loud wail.
It was the second most beautiful sight he's ever seen, and he was fully ready to paint it and begin to add waterfalls to his commission 'can do' list. The first most beautiful sight he's ever seen was standing next to him with Peter sitting on his shoulders, both of them staring at the giant waterfall in awe.
Once Steve had the money he handed Tony Peter's bowl of soup and bag of popcorn and the two of them made their way into the living room; Steve slowly tagging along with food for him and Tony.
After staring at the previous photo on Tony's phone, it was confirmed that there wasn't a move made.
It was rare for either of them to sleep throughout the night without being woken up at least once, but, looking over his shoulder and seeing the little four-year-old still fast asleep, Steve figured that their trip might have had something to do with it.
Steve held him tight and close as cheers began to ring all around them, pulling Tony away only long enough to give him a searing kiss.
"Now, here you go, Pete, here's ten dollars so you can buy whatever you'd like to eat, okay?" Tony says before they walk into the kitchen, handing Peter a couple of dollars to make the experience more real.
"Yeah, right. I would rather deal with the compost for the next month than do the night shift. No one comes in at night."
The guy knew where Tony worked and when! Plus, Tony gave him his name, and the fact that he's also the only one to ever work the night shift should also make things a bit obvious, but apparently not.
Tony wrote back, chuckling to himself when he folded up the note and slipped it back underneath the game board.
Looking across the grass and towards the communal showers, Steve made sure that Tony wasn't coming before opening up the ring box and showing the ring - once again - to Peter.
Inside were a bunch of blankets and pillows made into a little lay area that would be comfy enough for all of them to sleep on if Peter were able to sleep outside tonight.
Sometimes the stranger would talk about the type of drink he ordered - which was weirdly never coffee despite this being a literal coffee shop - and Tony usually would respond with recommendations for new drinks.
“Then in that case, I would love to go out and eat some dinner with you before coming back and cutting into this delicious cake that I so selflessly baked.” Tony lighthearted teases.
Their talking quickly turned into flirting as well, which was kind of odd considering neither of them knew the other and Tony didn't even know this guy's name. The only reason he knew the stranger was another man was only because their conversation somehow led to them telling each other what the other looked like.
"I figured you guys would be going through it right now, so I decided to make a surprise visit and help out a bit," Sarah explains as she begins to make herself at home in the kitchen, setting out and warming up some of the food she had brought.
That's why, when a blonde adonis of a man walked into the shop, Tony was so distracted with his own daydreams that he didn't think much about it. He just absentmindedly wrote down the guy's order and took his money.
That was around the same time that Peter came in to relieve Tony of his shift, so Tony left the coffee shop - with only a small amount of teasing Peter - actually excited for what was to come tomorrow.
Steve gasps, "A ticket? Wow, I wonder what for!" Steve pretends to ponder before looking back at his son. "Wanna go find out?" Steve asks, making Peter nod his head excitedly; previous bad mood forgotten completely.
Tony looked at the door and took a deep breath, trying to calm his heartbeat. He place his hand on the handle and abruptly stopped before opening the door.
“Do you still get nightmares about this? About what you saw in the wormhole? I know you used to.” Steve asked carefully.
Hii I know this is a sensitive topic, so if you think I handled it incorrectly please please tell me so
“How are you holding up?” he continued while laying a hand on his friend’s shoulder as a sign of support.
Steve himself didn’t overshare, but he did talk about his childhood for the most part. He admitted he didn’t really have the knowledge to underhand all of Tony’s ‘science talk’, as he would call it, but he did prove to be a quick learner.
Tony nodded. “I am sorry, too. I only knew you from my father’s stories. I should have given you a chance to get to know you, Cap.” he said.
The previous day, a mission had gone wrong and Clint had jumped of the wrong side of the building. Because of that Tony hadn’t been able to catch him on time. Fortunately, it was only a two-story building, so he only acquired three broken ribs, but the memory of him falling was still fresh on everyone’s minds.
“I need you to promise me something.” he said and she looked at him with a curious expression on her face. She gave him a little nod.
For Tony it was highly unusual to have someone that actually cared for him and not his money and wanted to help him, so it did take him a while to trust Rhodey, but he was glad he did in the end.
His heart will always ache for the people he lost, for all the chances he missed. But deep down he knows that the best thing he can do is move on.
Steve looked even more exasperated and suddenly stood up. “We could go somewhere more quiet though.” he said hopeful.
An hour later, an hour full of talking about their insecurities and laughing about their most random thoughts, they decided it was time to head to bed.
“My name. I would prefer it, if you called me Steve. Everyone here sees me as Captain America, treats me like I’m Cap. But we’re not the same person. I prefer being Steve Rogers, just a kid from Brooklyn.” he continued.
He started pacing again, so trapped in his own thoughts he hadn’t even noticed that the called had connected.
He gingerly took the bowl out of Yinsen’s hands. He brought it up to his lips and drunk some of the soup-looking liquid. He gave it back to the other man and put his hands closer to the fire to get some warmth.
Ten months and nine days. Thirty six minutes since Tony began staring at Steve’s location in his lab.
He turned to Tony abruptly and engulfed him in a crashing hug. “I love it.” he whispered softly. “Thank you.”
“You-you are right, Jarvis. I should apologize for my words and let him explain his reasons.” he agreed.
“Ugh, I gotta go. Pep’s coming for a visit and- ugh... we haven’t really talked, you know, heart to heart and that middle school crap, since the break up.”
So, to calm him down I took him to that ice cream place he was nagging me about. That was fun. He told me about that girl, Michelle, he has a major crush on. I mean he won’t admit it but he’s definitely whipped for her.”
The sound of the toaster snapped Tony out of his daze. He opened his eyes, quickly wiped his tears away and went to finish his breakfast.
, went unsaid. “It’s not the same without Mommy or the others. I want all of them, and so would your friends,” she said stubbornly, her eyes glistening with unshed tears.
If Sam noticed the open flip phone next to Steve’s head when he found him in the morning, he didn’t mention it.
, not one. Like, we had a marathon. Rewatched all the Star Wars movies ‘cause he hadn‘t seen the prequels. I know, that‘s unacceptable! Even
They never actually apologized for the insults they spat at each other in the hellicarrier, although Steve did try to talk to him about it once or twice.
He said and suddenly he felt sober again. He tried to reach for a bottle of tequila on his left, but it was too far away and he didn’t want to get up. He didn’t think he could get up at this point.
That kiss was nothing Tony had ever felt before. He obviously had plenty of experience from the past, but the love and care Steve poured into it was unparalleled. Of course he lacked Tony’s practiced ease, but his excitement and eagerness made up for it.
"Steven, just know, that I get your mother when we get divorced," Tony says, making Steve whip his head over towards him.
could have offered to join me," Tony says, frowning even more when Peter all but scoffed in his face.
"Steve! We're not at our picnic yet! You were supposed to wait." Peter admonishes, although there wasn't much heat behind it since even Peter could no longer hold in his happiness.
Tony was a bit curious about who was playing with the board considering it hasn't been touched since he's started working here two years ago, but that thought quickly went away the longer he stared at the board. It kind of really bothered him, seeing the game unfinished like it was.
“Well, then how about this weekend you and I go on a real-life-” Before Steve was even able to finish his sentence, a high pitch ringing noise began to blaring all throughout the bar and the artwork behind Tony was no longer showing bouncing colors, but a straight line of them.
"You're thinking too loud. Go back to sleep." Tony mumbles, sleepily batting at Steve's chest, causing Steve to chuckle.
She loved this little family they had and felt so incredibly lucky that she was able to have all of this; to have two sons and a grandson. She could never bring herself to wish for anything to change.
On it was just a plain grilled cheese with some tomato soup, and while Peter was thankful for it, he was still too upset to do much else other than to begin eating.
"Why do you look like someone replaced the sugar in your coffee for salt?" Peter finally questioned one night before Tony was even able to get his jacket on.
But Tony guesses that's what he gets for starting a game with a stranger and only being able to make one move a day.
Only thing was, every time he got his hopes up, the person he got his hopes up for wouldn't bring up the chess game. They would just order and then leave without so much as to a hint that they knew Tony.
"Can I see it just one more time? Pretty please?" Peter hounds Steve, using the bigger man's knees as leverage so he could jump up and down.
Even if he had to meet with a customer in a completely different city, or if he was at his office for the whole day - which also happened to be half an hour away - Steve came back. And every single night, Tony was there working and waiting, Steve’s beer ready and on hand for when he walked in.
He had just got done working with one of the most difficult customers he’s had in a really long time; with said customer hounding Steve about doing a completely different art commission than what they had agreed upon originally, only to get widely upset when Steve told them it was going to cost more if he were to do so.
While Peter was distracted with everything outside, Steve snuck back inside to make sure everything for dinner and "the concession stand" was all set up.
"This paper under your pillow. What's it for?" Steve continues to question, trying not to smile and give everything away as Peter turned around and reached for the slip of paper.
They both had been working hard for hours, trying to figure out how to get a bunch of cardboard boxes to look like a huge iceberg. Thankfully Tony was really good at building and was able to manipulate everything into the shape they needed and Steve was amazing at painting so he could get it to look as realistic as they needed.
And, yeah, maybe they should have focused on getting Peter to only eat healthy food while he was still under the weather, but they figured plain popcorn with no butter or seasonings would fine just this once.
They would write messages about each other day - the stranger talking about what kinds of art commissions he did that day, what kind of customers he talked to, and Tony talked about everyone's weird coffee orders and how slow it usually was at night.
"That's pretty smart, though. And really creative, also." Steve compliments, only feeling slightly weird for kind of flirting at the moment.
He was in an area that he wasn’t all too familiar with since he offered to meet up with the customer somewhere, so whichever bar he saw first was the one he decided to stumble into for the night.
Steve didn’t even know how long he was there, doing CPR on this random child, all he could focus on was counting to thirty as he did compressions, giving two breaths, and continuing that whole process once more.
Steve couldn't resist tugging both of his boys into his arms, sighing in contentment. Steve was almost a hundred percent sure that there was nothing better in life than early morning snuggles with these two Stark boys.
"I'm glad. Now, let's finish making breakfast." Steve says, smiling and ruffling Peter's hair before turning back to the griddle.
It didn't take long for the EMTs to get the small boy onto a stretcher and to begin hauling him out of the room, but as soon as they did Tony seemed to snap right out of the stunned daze he was in.
The few minutes after Peter had finished eating were spent with Steve and Peter cuddling in silence, both of them content to just lay there and relish in the contact.
It didn't take too long for Peter to fall asleep, but Tony continued until he couldn't anymore, not wanting to burst the wonderful little bubble they had created.
Knowing that he probably shouldn't read someone's personal note, Tony almost just went and threw it away, but his boredom and curiosity got the better of him and he opened it up anyway.
"Sorry, Love, but I think I'm up for the day now," Steve admits, knowing that once he was awake, he was awake, and wouldn't be able to go back to sleep.
"Uhh, Steve, you do know people usually put the candles on the cake once they get to the party, right?" Tony questions, watching in confusion as the other man began to place the candles all around the frosting words.
Steve just gave him an amused look in return - thankfully - however that still didn’t stop Tony from feeling the need to defend and explain himself.
Sure enough, though, it only took about three mouthfuls of soup for Peter to begin crying. Even he couldn't resist the tempting smell of Sarah's cooking.
Well, okay, he didn't actually forget it. He couldn't. He already thought about it for hours on end earlier in the day and was still dwelling on all the information Peter had given him; even going so far as to daydream about scenarios that involved him and Steve. Yes, he already knew he was pathetic, and he apparently didn't care to make it worse with false hope.
“Don’t sweat it, I was actually just admiring your art piece there. It’s really interesting and eye-catching. Did you create that yourself?” Steve asks smiling a bit behind his beer bottle when he saw that he managed to make the bartender duck his head in - what Steve assumed - was a shy move.
"Hey, Bear," Steve quietly knocks before walking into the room, "I heard you were up so I brought you up something to eat," Steve says, gently placing the carrying tray onto Peter's lap.
"You are, and it's disgusting. But at least you know now and can be prepared for when you meet him."
"Oh. Kind of like dolphins?" Peter continues to question, crawling across his bed to hop on Steve and Tony's bed.
Steve just took it all in stride though, alternating between rubbing Peter's back and helping to wipe his runny nose.
Sheer anger burned in his veins. All his pain turned into wrath. He got up from the floor and kicked the bathtub. “Why can’t I have anything good in life?” His voice broke as he shouted.
“You know what?” Tony said breaking the silence. “I should probably give you your present, I left it in my room.” he continued while getting up and heading for his room.
“I-I’m fine, Morgan, just a little sad.” He answered calmly as he sat down onto the grass next to her in order to be closer to the little girl‘s height. She sat next to him, her small hand still holding onto his pant leg for dear life.
So, when Natasha saw Tony that morning, she only gave him a pointed look and opened the cupboard to get herself a box of cereal.
He clearly received some instruction, because he nodded and turned back to the party. “The Boss is on his way. In the meantime, everyone is to sit down and shut up, or you’ll be sorry.”
He saw Natasha nod at Steve out of the corner of his eye before she and Bruce left, closing the door behind them. Steve was fiddling with the edge of his blanket, his eyes anywhere but on Tony.
Tony loved him, he realised. This big, bashful blond who was awkward and sweet, and witty, sharp and strong in equal measure.
“Maybe I just wanted the opportunity to see you bent over the table,” Steve smirked with a wink. His cheeks were a little pink though, which told Tony the boldness took a little more courage than it seemed. It was pretty cute.
Tony listened to the comforting babble as they walked down the street, taking Peter’s hand tightly as they approached the busy intersection, feeling the familiar panic in his chest. He still tensed at busy roads, as soon as he smelt the heavy scent of car exhaust, unable to shake the memory of when Peter had first started walking and had darted across the street when Tony had been distracted. He’d gone weak in the knees with fear at the time, and now he made sure to keep him close.
Stíofán decided to take a chance, dropping to his knees his hand holding steady in its movements. Tony seemed none the wiser, too caught up in the feeling, and so Stíofán looked his fill, seeing where the slick and his own spend covered that pretty entrance. He leaned forward, brushed his tongue against it.
“You’re just playing hard to get,” the alpha said, and Tony felt his hand on his thigh for a second time. Unlike before though, he didn’t freeze. Instead, he kicked out his foot, striking the man hard in his alphahood, and making him howl in pain. “Why you little--”
“Peter’s sick,” she told him, with no preamble, which he appreciated. “Tony’s with him at Doc Banner’s place. You need to go on over.”
As Tony winced when the alpha stepped on his toe, the big blond blushed red as a tomato, muttering apologies.
“Happy, definitely happy,” Stíofán rumbled - it was hard to get the words out. “I didn’t expect...but it’s good, it’s-- it’s everything I ever wanted.”
“So what’s with you always comparing me to a pig when you’re upset?” Steve asked, and Tony snorted. He felt Steve’s chest shake as he started to laugh too.
“And so modest,” Steve replied with a grin. He took a long drink from his beer and Tony found his eyes drawn to the foam it left on his top lip.
“And uh, I guess I kind of developed a crush on you from then, one that I obviously never thought would come to fruition, for obvious ‘you-crashed-in-to-the-ocean-seventy-years-ago' reasons, but then you were found, and well, it really took off.”
“I can’t,” Steve said, and for a moment he hated the way he could take charge and hide himself away because he desperately wanted to show Tony how much he didn’t want to go, but what good would it do? It wouldn’t change anything. “I’ve appreciated your kindness.”
She settled in to finish the rest of her pancakes. As she cleared the plate, a picture popped up of Sif in her new room.
He could hear Tony’s irritated calls as he failed to get up in time to give chase -- which S’Teve had no doubt he would -- and he darted into the turbolift, feeling a sense of relief as the doors closed. That would be the end of the matter, he would not need to think of it again.
“I’d love that,” Tony told him honestly. He liked Steve’s voice and he was eager to hear it, and he loved that Steve had thought about what might entertain him. “But please, let me clean up. It’s my job after all.” Steve had been generous so far, but Tony couldn’t afford to start off on the wrong foot.
“Yeah, it was. And after that, I’ve just been worried. A lot. About everything that can hurt him. But I’m trying. That’s partly what the dog thing was about, I wanted to let him have fun and prove to myself I could let him run around without being on edge the whole time.” He gave Steve a self-deprecating smile. “I haven’t quite managed it, but you’ve helped a lot.”
Clint brandished the magazine at him and Tony raised an eyebrow. “Wow Cap, guess you beat me out this year.” The machine beeped and he grabbed his mug. “I better up my game next time.” He gave Steve a wink, and it took everything in him not to blush.
This is the final chapter of the main story, but worry not gentle readers, there are THREE bonus chapters/mini sequels in production and on their way - the first will be out in a week or two so make sure you're subscribed to
Peter swung an arm trying to reenact it. “It was so neat. Mr Bull pinched my ear hard, and it hurt, and I didn’t even do anything!”
Tony felt the relief sweep through him as everything fell into place. They were going to do it! And god, how had he not thought to ask if Alpine could do it? She was perfect. The stress must've gotten to him more than he thought.
“People like us? That’s not very friendly.” He gestured with his gun. “Take a seat. The boss will be here soon enough.”
In the afternoon he grabbed his broom, Jarvis burrowing into his robes, and flew out over the city, out into the rolling green hills. It was beautiful out here, the smell of grass heavy on the air.
She huffed as a smile broke out on her face. “Thanks. You can message me tomorrow so I can check yours – make sure you don’t look like too much of a small-town hick.”
“This isn’t even difficult for you, is it?” He poked Stíofán’s arm muscles. “These have gotten ridiculous.”
“I need a job done. Tony said he’d help out at the bakery, so he can do this for me right?” Sam raised a brow at them both questioningly.
It sounded so simple when he said it. Just do what makes you happy and not owe anyone anything. It’s a nice thought.
“Still all alone?” The alpha purred, his scent almost predatory. “Shame to leave a pretty little thing like you here. How’s about I walk you into town? I’ll show you a good time.”
“Even if that were true, I think the human half of you knows how to lie pretty well. Spill. Or we’re taking chocolate shots until your tongue loosens up a bit.“
Steve quickly followed, holstering his gun and grabbing his hat. He wondered what was happening. The new shop owner had seemed polite enough when he’d come to town at the start of the month, hardly the type to cause a fuss.
Five minutes passed. Then another ten. The station emptied until it was just him and a few porters. He felt a shiver of panic.
He’d wanted to give her the flowers when she’d been sick with a cold, he remembered, as he stepped forward to hug her tight. “I can’t either.”
“Alright, shall we go? We can get you something from the saloon to nibble on until we get home and you can have some porridge.”
“You are a good father,” Mr Rogers said firmly. “I have worked with families where the fathers barely took an interest in their children, but you dote on him, listen to him, and make sure he knows he’s loved. It’s very admirable.”
Tony seemed to thrive with work to be done, making friends easily in the kitchens and always making sure Stíofán was given the best of the offerings.
He stormed over to the tent, ripping back the flap. If Hodge had hurt Tony in any way, Steve was going to tear out his throat and -
Tony raised a confused brow but moved closer to see. Oh, he understood what the guy meant. The dirigible was caught in the strong winds, thrashing against its ropes. There were scores of people trying to hold it in place. There were also a lot of stressed-looking higher-ups pointing up at it, and Tony could sympathise. Launch Day was tomorrow - something Tony knew because Steve wouldn’t shut up about it - so having it go wrong this close must be a nightmare.
Sure enough, the guy bounced back up, tangled in some sort of netting and still screaming his head off as he rose through the air on a cable, out of sight. Tony stared, his brain not really processing the situation properly.
He was cut off by the arrival of Mrs Aberforth, a widow herself and one who had long thought herself the next Mrs Stark, despite it being well known Tony had no interest. She claimed him for a dance, and unable to say no without causing offence, all he could do was give Mr Rogers an apologetic smile as he was tugged away. He longed to know the end of the sentence, even though his heart feared what it might be.
“You horny devil,” Pierce laughed. “Well, you can get your chance. Rumour is the spares will be sent to the red light district. You can have your fill if you can afford it.”
Stíofán didn’t manage to stifle his grin, he was too excited but he did lean down to give Tony a long kiss on the forehead and a nuzzle. He got a nuzzle in return so he figured he wasn’t in too much trouble. “Waiting on you hand and hoof, we agreed. I’ll go fetch some.”
stories because he was too good at sad eyes and after an argument, he lost about letting Dodger stay over on his bed -  he and Steve walked back into the lounge.
And it was all Tony’s fears at once. His kid and a dangerous thing in close proximity, his knees almost went weak with the panic that shot through him. But instead of freezing like he had with the cars, this time he shot forward tugging Peter behind him and getting between the kid and the grumpy reptile.
Honestly, he should’ve turned around and left as soon as he saw the guy. He was so clearly a douchey finance type and Tony had already been turned off by him bragging about his job perks.
But the other part, the pushier part that was keeping his stomach in a constant tangle, was that he and Tony hadn’t made up after their recent dispute.
Deciding he was tired of being on the back foot, he stepped forward, wrapping an arm around Tony’s waist to pull him close, and pressing their lips together.
“You can see the ropes straining at the posts, and the ground crew is trying to secure them,” the reporter’s voice said over top. “It’s being battered by the gusts, and if you see there--” the camera zoomed in on the cockpit, “we can see the crew in the cockpit are looking very nervous.”
Rhodey stared. “That’s some high level of Special Ops at least. I don’t recognise the model, and I had pretty high clearance.”
The omega blushed, and it delighted Steve that even after years together he could still garner such a reaction with a simple compliment.
Well. Wouldn’t do to be seen ogling tower visitors. But maybe he could ask around later: see if anyone knew of a sexy blond who had signed into the building. Maybe. Tony took a sip of his coffee as his phone beeped, letting him know Pepper had noticed his absence. Back to the grind.
When they were done, the room was spartan but tidy, and Tony flopped onto the bed feeling a sense of accomplishment. He let himself have ten minutes, just letting the feeling wash over him, Jarvis curled up for a short cat nap on his chest, before he pushed himself up and went to help in the bakery. He was going to pull his weight and make sure they knew how grateful he was if it killed him.
“Hodge!” a low commanding voice barked, and the alpha jumped in surprise. Tony peeked around to see another alpha approaching them, his face like thunder. “I know I didn’t just hear you harassing an omega like that in my town.”
She wanted to call them back – feeling the certainty deep in her bones that if she called, her parents would turn the car around and come back no questions asked.
Steve sighed. “Yeah well, I’m not sure it was worth it.” He gestured and JARVIS helpfully brought up Twitter. “Lot of people, calling for me to resign.”
“Spear. Wanna see?” She tossed the spear to Carol who caught it, giving it a twirl and extending it with ease.
He looked through the stores. Much of the food he had no idea what to do with, but there was a recipe for soup that seemed easy and that told him he could use whatever vegetables he could find and a bone for the stock. There was a bone in the icebox with some meat still attached, and so he boiled it, salting the water diligently. Then he cut up and tossed a fair amount of the vegetables he could find, cooking them until they were soft. When the broth was done, it smelled good, though for some reason it was awfully bland. He poured the soup from the pot into a large serving dish anyway, since he worried adding much more salt would just make it even worse. He was just picking it up to place it on the table when the door swung open, and the sudden movement gave Tony a fright, making him jump.
His father came over to pat him on the shoulder. “I’m sure you’ll do great son. Stick to the magic people like and you’ll be settled in no time. Supply and demand, that’s what makes you successful in business.”
He was...cute. Very cute. The aforementioned blue eyes, blond hair, a slim frame that was shorter than Tony’s own, and a pretty blush covering the sharp cheekbones. He was lovely.
His friend Arnie from the old neighbourhood. Mr and Mrs Kowalski who had lived across the hall. Mr Collins who owned the Grocer’s. Father O’Malley from Saint Patrick’s where he and his mother had gone every Sunday. Even just a lot of the singers and stars of the silver screen he’d grown up with.
“I was thinking that since it’s probably a little too late to make supper again, that maybe we could cheat a little.” He brandished a plate of warm sliced bread, butter and some preserves in a little dish. “It’s blackberry. One of the omegas in town makes it: he’s famous for it.”
and he collapsed forward, Antonius huffing beneath his weight as his strength, which had been so prominent since the fight, left him.
He came in to land in a field next to an old wooden farmhouse, feeling the familiarity of the country wrapping around him. He’d forgotten how quiet home was compared to the bustling city, and the sudden silence felt like a breath of fresh air. Actually, so did the literal breath he took: no smog from cars or stagnant water from the sewers, just grass and the faint smell of rain. He looked where there were dark clouds gathering in the distance. Hopefully he’d be fast enough to miss those on the way home.
“What’s going on here?” Tony recognised the voice of Deputy Barnes and felt a surge of relief. At least there was someone with authority who could back his plan instead of standing around gaping.
It was possible Tony was not interested in Vulcans. Unsurprising, since humans tended to find Vulcans cold and calculating, given their unparalleled control over their emotions, but Tony had always treated S’Teve kindly once they’d overcome their initial disagreement when they’d both joined the crew of the
“Mostly just the shop. Rhodey runs the cafe, and I handle the books. It’s my shop. I’m the Stark above the door.”
Now Tony was confused. “No. No, that’s not what happened. We don’t do it because I ruined it for you by getting emotional, and you didn’t get to knot. Alpha’s want it all the time, and you didn’t want me after that, so it was my fault.” He felt like he was sounding a little panicked, because this had eaten at him for months, and it couldn’t be because he’d misunderstood. It couldn’t.
Bucky sighed but dutifully ducked out from behind the camera. He reached over and placed one of Steve’s arms on the back, and then rested the other on his thigh so it hid some of what was on offer. “There, now it looks like you’re teasing him.”
Her eyes flitted to her pops’ and she could suddenly see resignation there. He’d already worked it out, and she felt the guilt settle in her stomach. She looked at him, her breath catching for a moment, and then he smiled at her, a touch of sadness dropping it at the corner.
He was tired, but somehow so awake, something twitching under his skin. Steve had brought them home, tucking Tony under a blanket on their sofa and heating their casserole from the previous evening. He’d made sure Tony was taken care of, well-fed, and warm, and it had made Tony feel safer and more loved than he’d been since he’d been cared for by Jarvis and Ana.
He looked down at Peter, who was staring at Tony’s departing figure, mouth open in surprise. He turned to Steve. “Papa, daddy shouted at Mr Bull! And hit him with a spoon!”
"Well, I hope whoever the lucky person is they say yes." Tony tightly says, giving a short smile. A night in with Rhodey eating and watching absolute trash sounds better and better by the second.
"Tony," Steve calls out to get the man's attention, slowly lowering down on one knee when the scientist turned around to face him.
Tony was full-on sobbing by the time Steve got to the end of his speech and all he could really do was wheeze out a, "Yes!" before throwing himself into Steve's arms.
"I do too, but this is also a good lesson for him to learn, as much as I hate to admit it. It's good for him to realize that there are times where things just come up and plans can't always happen; even though I would have liked just as much for him to have been able to go." Tony shrugs, huffing a bit at himself for turning this into a life lesson.
They both have been running themselves ragged while they tried to get used to being new parents. Although, neither one of them would change any of it for the world.
It took all day, with the two of them going back and forth before the customer agreed to pay the extra that Steve was charging her. Steve was so mentally exhausted from the whole argument that all he wanted to do now was sit down, have a couple of beers, head home, and go straight to bed.
Peter nodded eagerly, not even bothering to take his eyes off the top of the tent so he didn't miss a thing.
“Oh, thank God.” Tony eventually breathes out once his body and brain was able to function once again. Although it wasn’t functioning enough for him to stop himself from actually saying that out loud.
"Alright then, Mr. Stink Face, I guess I won't help with breakfast then," Tony says, making sure to give a fake attitude just to hear Peter's giggles in return. "Make sure Steve doesn't burn the cabin down while I'm gone." Tony teases, lessening the blow by planting a kiss on Steve's lips.
"What time is it?" Tony asks, grunting in annoyance when Steve shifted so he could grab his phone and check the time.
Thankfully, when Tony got back to the shop later that night for his shift, the evening rush hour was still going on so he was able to keep busy for half of the night.
“Sorry about the wait, had to open up a whole new case.” The bartender apologizes as he comes back, handing Steve his bottle.
”We’re just really, really excited to get there; right, Pete?” Steve asks, hoping if he got the boy excited enough he would start rambling and take the focus off of Steve for a while.
It looked similar to a painting, but it was on an all-black canvas. On it was neon lights that moved up and down, almost similar to an electrocardiogram. Every time one colorful line would bounce to the other side of the canvas it would change colors and continue to do the same.
Peter was so beyond excited to be able to go to the zoo and see his favorite animals - penguins - only to then after go to the planetarium located in the zoo and look at Peter's favorite thing to learn about; the stars.
When they got to the gate leading to the back, Tony was there waiting for them, standing underneath a gigantic cardboard sign that read
”Promise that we’ll hunt for mermaids. Sorry I kind of promised that we would search for them while we walk on the path just in case there’s some freshwater mermaid we don’t know about.” Steve quickly cuts in, giving a small and nervous smile when Tony gave him a strange look.
“Do you ever think about trying something a bit different while you’re here?” Tony asks one night as he hands Steve his third Sam Adams of the night.
"So you know who he is?" Tony questions, Peter rolling his eyes at the sheer ridiculousness of it all.
When the boy had woken up with a stuffed-up nose, sore throat, and a fever that was a little too high to send him to school with, the hopes and dreams of all of those things that the poor kid had gone straight down the drain.
It was a lot. Although, not enough to scare Steve away. In fact, it was the opposite, now Steve was even more curious about Tony's life and wanted to know more. He always found he wanted to know more about the bartender.
Steve reached into the cooler and pulled the ring out, completely disregarding his previous plan to do it over lunch.
It didn’t take long for Steve to connect the pieces and figure out that it wasn’t actually an art piece but it was a heart monitor, and whoever was connected to that heart monitor was flatlining. But, by the time Steve had actually made that connection, Tony was opening one of the side doors to the bar and booking it up the stairs that were behind it.
Just thinking about talking to Peter about what was going to happen was enough to send a wave of nausea through Steve; even though the toddler knew exactly what was to come. Maybe it was just the concept as a whole. Either way, Steve felt like throwing up he was so anxious.
When Steve woke up, it was slow, and for once he actually felt well-rested. Steve gently peeled his eyes open and looked around the one-roomed cabin, smiling when he saw his boyfriend still sleeping in his arms.
Looking the man up and down, Tony noticed that he matched almost every single description the stranger had written in their notes to each other; except he left out the fact that he was smoking hot.
Steve couldn't be blamed for what he did next; how could he not do what he did when Tony looked like
While that thought was supposed to be comforting, it really was anything but, and it made Tony feel sick to his stomach more than anything else.
But, she also couldn't help resist teasing the two boys in front of her. After all, Steve didn't learn how to be a troll all by himself. Someone had to be there as a role model for him.
After the funeral ended, Steve walked around in the field close to the Stark mansion. He didn’t feel like he could stay in the building any longer. His heart ached for someone that just wasn’t there anymore.
It was in that moment when Steve realized that the genius had come out there only wearing his blank tank top. He promptly removed his sweatshirt and handed it to Tony. The other man stared at it for a second and then accepted the offer. Steve couldn’t deny how good his clothes looked on the shorter guy. A sort of possessive feeling overcame him.
Of course, Tony knew that about Steve from early on in their friendship. The Avengers had to attend galas from time to time for the press, so all of the team would be there.
“Since I was born, all I've been for him was the person that would continue his legacy. He didn’t see me as a child, definitely didn’t treat me as one. He saw me as a genius, so he sent me to a boarding school and then to MIT without caring about what
With his mind made up, he just stared at the peaceful lake. His focus drifted back to the memories with Tony, to all the things they said to each other
All the guests seemed to be having fun, now having finished their meals, they crowded the impromptu dance floor. Thor had brought his girlfriend, Jane, and tried not to step on her feet while she laughed absentmindedly. Clint had actually improved his skills and now danced with Natasha, or any female guest available, with ease. Bruce still wasn’t feeling the concept of dancing, but gave in under Darcy’s insistent nagging and granted her a dance. After his mandatory dance with Pepper, who was now swirling around with Rhodey, Tony sat down at his table again and looked around for Steve.
“How about we go back inside? I’m sure your mum is really worried about you. Okay?” the blond suggested.
He took a deep breath and slowly zipped down the top part of his uniform. He swiftly located the wound, which, even though it had almost completely healed, was still red.
To be honest I don’t like Extremis per say but it was the only way for everything to make sense. I used my knowledge on it but I may have made some mistakes. I am not really gonna explore into it though.
By the time Tony stopped talking, Steve had already taken care of his wound and had his eyes closed and his head resting on the cushion, just listening to the genius talk.
“No need to go to Nick for this one, I’ll guide you to the Captain.” she said as she walked towards the elevators.
“No matter what happens, always remember your dad gave up his life to save us all, to give you a future. Please never blame him for leaving you, it’s the last thing he had ever wanted. He loved you with his whole being, he would never ever want to hurt you on purpose. Okay?” he continued.
“I’ve travelled to one too many places, but Italy has to be my favorite. Maybe I’m sentimental like that.” the genius admitted.
At this point, Steve was used to Tony knowing his location at all times. It secretly made him feel a little safer, in case things took an ugly turn.
He could volunteer, teach drawing to the elderly, help in dog adoption centers. He hadn’t even thought there were so many possibilities before deciding to go back to the past. His mind had been clouded with grief, a sharp pain that wouldn’t dissipate from his gut.
Steve loved Tony’s Italian background. Not only because of the sweet melodies he would sing to the blond, but also from the excitement he got when he went to Italian restaurants or when he cooked a traditional dish himself. Steve did know some Italian from his time in Europe, but every time Tony spoke the language, he was absolutely gone for the guy.
“Anyway,” Fury said pointedly “we did manage to explain everything to him or at least as much as we could, although he did seem more accustomed to modern life than we would have expected. And since then, he’s been asking for you.”
His eyes were focused on the old sketchbook in his hands. “I thought I had lost it when I woke up after the ice.” his voice trembled. He turned the yellowish pages and saw his old drawings.
“I’m in love with you, too” he whispered to the sleeping man beside him. Little did he know, Steve had actually heard him.
Tony knew what he meant by the word ‘together’; that they have been bonded for 18 years now. But he still felt warm all over when Steve said that.
“I used to hate you, you know. Howard would always compare me to your greatness and talk about your achievements and how little I’ve done. You were the favorite child, even though you weren’t really there.” the genius continued.
He, also, found out that soulmates could supposedly sort of sense each other’s feelings. Although Steve’s side of the bond always felt cold.
As Tony finally walked into his apartment and headed towards his bedroom, he continued bantering with Steve.
“He never showed me anything remotely close to affection. I remember, when I was four, I made my first circuit board on my own. I showed it to him and for once he seemed happy. Next thing I knew, I was surrounded by the press, who wanted to take a photo of the Stark heir. And after the press left, my dad took the circuit board and shoved it in the trash.” he continued.
“I don’t think Agent Hill would be pleased with us leaving the gala.” Steve replied, a small smile playing on his face.
They weren’t exactly friends, more like friendly teammates. One sure thing is, that Steve started treating him differently ever since he fell through the wormhole. Maybe with more respect.
The night before the wedding day, they had slept separately, because Steve insisted that they should follow the tradition and not see each other before their wedding. Tony called him old fashioned, but followed his words. The genius stayed in a mansion his mother owned in the region with Rhodey and Pepper, while Steve and most of the guests stayed in a hotel nearby.
Then he remembered why he was in his room in the first place. He could feel tears threatening to spill from his eyes. He climbed on his bed, got under the covers and closed his eyes tightly.
“No- no... Nat will need it and- and what if her bites aren’t ready and she has to go on a mission and-“ the other man said, his voice audibly shaking.
He walked to the kitchen and sat on the counter. Jarvis, without even looking up, said “Get off the counter or you’ll get hit with a plaster.”
“That’s-that’s why i don’t really like movies about the war, the past. The melancholy comes back to me at full force. You know, Sam helps me with this kind of stuff, being a PTSD counselor and everything. But, to be honest, I preferred when my therapy was watching space movies with you on the communal floor.” he whispered that last phrase.
He looked around at all the bottles he had consumed. He barked out a bitter laugh; like father, like son.
“I don’t think that void in my heart he left when he died is ever going to heal. I can’t believe he really is gone.” he said with his mind replaying all the events of the fight.
“It’s okay, I get it. I‘m glad you called, Tony.” the blond said with his smooth voice and the genius ended the call.
“Okay, so yesterday the kid invited me to his physics presentation. Have I ever told you that this kid’s a genius? He really is. He might even be able to compete with my intelligence, who knows. So, his presentation about strong nuclear force was obviously impeccable and everything went smoothly until the time for questions came.
The whole time they were looking into each other’s eyes, beaming and hardly realizing that there were other people around them.
“I’ve been here for three days and I can attest it really is magical.” Steve said and Tony bet he looked around at the scenery at that moment.
He cried and spent away all his pent up energy that way, he even threw up at one point. Rhodey found him in the morning laid in the bathtub looking at the ceiling, his eyes dry by the time the sun had risen. He pretended he was hangover, and if his roommate caught on his lie, he didn’t say.
He was so focused on the other guy, he didn’t even notice Rhodey sitting down onto the stool next to him.
He felt bad for hanging up so abruptly, but something told him he would hear from the captain again, anyway.
Tony pulled away from the hug enough to look at his boyfriend his hopeful eyes. “Really?” he asked in a small voice.
“Whatever it is, I’m sure it’s great. You didn’t even have to get me anything, the party was enough. Hell, you letting us stay at your tower was enough.” The blond replied and proceeded to open the box.
A breeze of melancholy passed through the air and Tony decided it was enough emotional talk for one night. “Okay, how about we ditch this place and go get some cheeseburgers?” he suggested.
Without even realizing it, they had both moved towards each other. It was as if there were a magnetic pull between them, that mended their souls and couldn’t keep their bodies apart.
He could still remember his eyes and the wrinkles that appeared around them when he genuinely smiled. That beautiful brown that had a special glint when he came up with a new idea. The way he moved his hands as he was explaining an elaborate plan. Tony always spoke with his hands. It was a sly reminder of his Italian background.
The following two and a half weeks Tony grieved his soulmate’s loss. He was convinced Steve had finally passed the threshold to other side as his part of the bond felt warm, whereas it used to feel cold. Tony supposed that warmth came from his side of the connection.
Sometimes, when his nightmares got pretty bad, he would put his head on Tony’s chest or he would take a hold of his wrist, because his heartbeat calmed him down.
The fond smile on his face when he spoke about the people he loved. The firm way he used his hands when he was hugging someone and the warm and welcoming aura that was always around him.
“My mum was Italian. Her maiden name was Carbonelli and she used to live with her family in Sirmione. She has a beautiful mansion there. Well, I suppose it’s mine now, although I’ve never visited it after her death.” he finally said.
“I-I was just too busy studying for my exams that I didn’t have any time to prepare for my quantum mechanics contest. I-“ Tony took a sharp breath and tried to stop his lips from trembling.
He took his hand off the handle, removed his sunglasses instead and placed them on the pocket of his suit; he didn’t want to seem cold or arrogant.
He cared and he always tried to make sure Tony was healthy and happy. He knew how to calm him down and sometimes they understood each other’s feelings without uttering a word.
Once he remembered everything that had happened, Peter sat up to rub his eyes, a pout planted firmly on his face.
"Come on, I'm not stupid. You've stopped complaining about how bored you are at work now, you constantly stare at the chessboard over there, and the same man comes in every single day and has now officially become a regular when he wasn't before to also stare at the chessboard the entire time he's here." Peter explains, which makes sense if you're stuck in the shop all day and have nothing better to do than noticing these things.
Eventually, Peter's hunger outran all of his excitement and Tony was finally able to convince him to come inside so they could eat.
"I don't look like that. What makes you think I look like that?" Tony tries to deny, consciously schooling his expression in a neutral one.
Almost as if Tony was wishing magic into the air, a knock on the front door could be heard throughout the whole house.
"Why are you telling me all of that. It's none of my business what he's doing." Tony says, making sure not to show the relief that he felt when he found out that the stranger - Steve - was only on a trip for work.
"Exactly like that." Tony agrees, pulling Peter into his arms and snuggling up with the young boy for a bit.
Steve made his way into the bar late one night, all but plopping down onto one of the stools and sighing heavily.
”Uh-huh. And you’re sure that’s all it is? Because the two of you are now acting like you drank three pots of expresso without me knowing.” Tony says, his voice laced with suspicion.
"I found a way to connect it to his heart monitor. So I could always keep an eye on him even while I was at work." Tony explains.
"Oh, thank god you're here." Steve breathes out once he opened the door, revealing his mother on the other side, arms full of - what he was hoping - was a bunch of food and goodies.
Tony stared a bit more curiously at the board, wondering why anyone would abandon a game after only the first move when he saw a small slip of paper underneath the board.
There were a lot of unsaid's while they were talking, but Steve never pushed, feeling like it would be too far since he has only just now become a regular and has only now started to get to know the other man better.
Tony smiled after reading the note, the idea of playing a game of chess with a complete strange like this intriguing to him.
Whatever possessed him to agree on taking the night shift for the next couple of weeks alone he'll never know. All he does know is that he was completely and utterly bored.
"Well, we'd better hope so, or else now he'll know we're planning something." Steve light-heartedly points out, making the small boy giggle at the realization. "Now, come on, Bear, let's get dressed and we'll talk about our game plan."
“Alright, what can I get you?” The bartender says, pulling Steve’s attention off the surroundings all around him.
Although, Steve wasn't quite as worried about Peter self-combusting as he was about himself. He had no idea how he was supposed to get out of the car and actually enjoy the whole scenery around them when all Steve could think about is what was going to be happing afterward.
But, of course, just like last night, it only lasted until about five in the morning, and Tony was once again left to his own devices after.
"Okay, okay, one last time. But we need to be quick so your Dad doesn't see." Steve concedes, struggling to pull the ring out of his pocket since he was sitting down on the bed.
Steve let out a slow breath, trying to stop shaking long enough to get the ring box out of his pocket so he didn't drop and lose the ring.
"Hey, Steve, perfect timing, I just finished the frosting. Just make sure to get it to whoever quick because I didn't have time to freeze it." Tony greets, just wanting this whole exchange to just get over quickly so he could go home and wallow.
By the time the movie had ended, all of their food and snacks were gone and Peter was beginning to get sleepy; the small boy completely boneless in Steve's lap.
As soon as the bartender gave been the slightest of nods, Steve was bustling both of them out of the apartment and into the car where they began to follow the ambulance.
"Poor guy. I feel so bad for him, he was looking forward to this since his teacher brought it up." Steve whispers, sighing and lightly brushing his thumb over Peter's limp hand.
Without thinking about it any further, Tony happily moved one of his pawns also. After his move was set and he was happy with the moves that could come after it, Tony grabbed the note from before and began writing underneath the other's person's message.
"He's been sick for as long I could remember. Has something to do with the way he was born. There were a lot of complications to get him here." Tony eventually speaks up, startling Steve a bit.
"Alright, enough of that now. You trade me the baby for the soup." Sarah says as she brings a big steaming bowl over to the table.
"Deal." Tony agrees, instantly passing up Pete in exchange. "Although, fair warning, he hasn't eaten in a bit so he may not stay content for very long," Tony warns once Sarah had a firm grip on the babe.
The only thing that could break up this moment was hearing Tony's stomach growl almost as loud as the bears outside would.
A couple of weeks ago, Steve had begun to realize how ran ragged he and Tony were getting - between Steve's commissions and horribly uncompliant customers, Tony's thousands of meetings coming in one after another, and Peter refusing to sleep during the night in his own bed - and came to the conclusion that a vacation desperately needed to get added to the agenda.
"Hey, hey, it's okay. I'll take you, okay? I'll drive. You're in no state to." Steve offers, waiting only for a second for confirmation from Tony.
"I can take a shower after we eat and help you with breakfast, babe." Tony offers, making Peter whip around and basically stare him down.
But, of course, Steve couldn’t help but feel intrigued. It probably didn’t help that Tony was beyond attractive and Steve wouldn’t mind taking him out on a real date sometime.
What he did;t love was the fact that he somehow managed to form a crush on one of his regulars; Steve.
"What am I going to do with you two?" Tony fondly asks, walking over and planting a kiss on both Steve's and Peter's cheeks.
"Are you still going to do it today?" Peter excitedly asks, watching as Steve laid a few strips of bacon down on the griddle to cook.
"Yeah," Tony whispers, almost worried that confirming it any louder would cause Peter to snap right awake. "God, what I wouldn't do for a pizza to just appear right now. I'm starving." Tony huffs, rolling around so he was laying on his back instead.
"We know you did, Pete. But all you can do right now is relax and get some rest so you can feel better, and all Papa and I can do right now is help you get better and promise that we will take you later." Tony says, gently easing Peter back down in bed and brushing some of his curls out of his eyes.
Steve knew it was a conversation that was going to have to come up sooner or later, but Steve always figured that he would have time to talk about it with Tony first before bringing it up to Peter.
"But-But-But, then we- we were going to go see the penguins, and after we were supposed to go to the building with the stars." Peter cries, only managing to make his stuffed-up nose even worse.
"Well, it's kind of hard to tell when we can only make one move a day. And I just got back from a trip with work and am still a little keyed up from the drive so I decided to stop in and see if you were working and if you would want to finish our game once and for all. Maybe get to know each other a little bit better while we're at it. I mean it's not every day you get to play a game of chess with someone as beautiful and clearly as bright as you are." Steve offers, and Tony couldn't believe anything that was happening right now.
Tony had thought that that was it, that the exchange was over, and was fully ready to go cry in the backroom as he waited for his next customer to come, but instead, he was frozen to his spot when he saw Steve start to open up the lid to the cake.
"You guys still aren't ready?" Tony lightheartedly asks, making Steve sigh in relief when his tone of voice didn't sound accusing.
was what was going to get Steve's heart started again. Thankfully, Peter just continued on like what he just said was nothing huge and life-changing. "Can I see Daddy's ring again?"
Steve was actually a bit surprised when he managed to find the campground they were at. They had a bunch of one-roomed cabins to rent, it was extremely kid-friendly with a park and even a pool, and it was deep enough in the wilderness that there were so many beautiful places to go sightseeing at.
It wasn't the greatest, to be honest, and it probably wouldn't fool anyone older than twelve, but all of that didn't even matter. What really mattered was the fact that Peter believed it and that the familiar spark in his eyes had returned.
Laying on the bed in the room was a tiny and frail little boy, who couldn’t have been much older than ten. The poor little guy was connected to so many different wires and machines and was pale as a ghost.
"Hello, my two favorite people. Are you ready to go see some penguins?" Tony over-animatedly asks, making Peter bounce on his toes.
"I wanna go on my trip." Peter snivels, hiccuping while he wiped the tears and snot off of his face and onto his shirt sleeve.
Instantly a bunch of stars and constellations began to flood the tent, Peter gasping at the sight before him. His eyes were moving a mile a minute as he tried to take the whole roof of the tent in all at once.
Looking around at the bar, Steve had to admit it was a quaint little place. It was small and thankfully not packed, and looked like a place that regular would come into and enjoy themselves for the night.
“Nope, not really.” Steve plainly replies, smirking when Tony playfully rolled his eyes in exasperation.
But, there was no new message written under the previous one that he left. The stranger must have just not shown up at all.
"What's the name for the order?" Tony asked, getting ready to write it on the cup even though there was no need; there was no one in there anyway.
The two superheroes could tell that Peter was excited about it also when he crawled in, but his cold and exhaustion was beginning to catch up with him so he couldn't do much more than give a small smile as he got in it.
"Wow! Look at this, Daddy! Look at all the penguins! Look, Papa!" Peter excitedly shouts, trying to take everything in all at once while also trying to get his fathers to do the exact same.
Then, Tony was thankful that Peter had enough stuffed animal penguins to practically fill up an entire zoo so they were able to place all of them up and around the giant fake iceberg to make it resemble somewhat of their habitat.
