"Molly, we're leaving," John says calmly. Both Molly and the Alpha with her stare at him. John realizes belatedly that the Alpha is the same one Jim had admired earlier, during their first robbery.
.............................................................
"Thank you," John states. "That's very sweet of you, to notice that I was hurting and to do something about it."
"Moriarty drugged him," John answers.
John turns red and studiously avoids Sherlock’s gaze. “Being a doctor is the most wonderful thing I can imagine, right up there with that feeling of completeness that washed over me the second Mycroft told me you were my Perfect Match.” He clears his throat, feeling a bit embarrassed. “Anyway, you said that Mycroft is both your friend and your arch-enemy. Why the second?”
"Rule three: we don't hurt anyone, ever," Molly says, "we just steal."
"You can't buy me. I won't like your brother just because you buy me things." John's words are purposely antagonizing. He wants to see how much it will take before the man hurts him.
"They're bringing in a domestic violence case. Omega woman. The Alpha was arrested, but she's understandably pretty traumatized so I'm going to help calm her. Stay here."
"What? You don't get to-"
'Sebastian, Murray, and Gregson stop
"May I massage you?" he asks me.
"That was ONE TIME!" Sherlock shrieks. "I'm fine. Just a bit of a disagreement in my stomach. It's settled now."
"Not tonight," Jim answers politely. "We'd prefer to be with him."
"Mycroft! John we have to go, we have to go now, he'll be so upset-"
"Do you?"
"Oh! It's beautiful!" He reaches into the box to pull out a gold pocket watch, caressing it gently. "How on Earth did you buy this for me without me noticing? I get all of your credit card statements!"
"Y-yes," Mycroft stuttered.
As soon as Lestrade gets back in the car, Sally is gaping at him. "Did the Freak just hug you?"
Silence. "What do you want?"
Vaguely I hear our front door. Gregory is home. He walks into the room. Before I can go over to him, I hear the leader snap, "Mike, Molly, we're leaving now!" I instantly deduce his thought process and leap in front of the door before they can leave.
"Not yet," John replies. He moves to the window, giving an experimental tug. It opens easily, making John smile. He leans out the window, then gulps. 'Don't think, just do it.' He pushes himself onto the windowsill, balancing precariously. He takes a deep breath and launches himself off the sill. For just a second, he is flying weightless, then the ground rushes up to meet him with unforgiving strength. There is an audible snap, and John is howling- way too loud, he knows the Alphas heard, and Jim is screaming in his ear, scared, but he can't stop screaming to reassure his friend.
I lift my head to realize that instead of being cradled in Jim's arms like I thought I was, I am in Mycroft's. I launch myself out of his arms, stuttering apologies.
"Lead the way," John offered with a sweep of his arm, and Sherlock hustled out to flag down a taxi.
"I set an alarm to remind myself to feed you lunch. I won't remember otherwise."
"I will."
"Then that's what we'll do," answers John. "You go ahead downstairs and tell your mother what happened, and tell her that I'm staying with Mycroft for the rest of the day. I'd like you to stay with everyone, though. Mycroft's not out of the woods yet, and it's not going to be pretty as he comes off these drugs, and I'd rather you not see it. Can you do that for me?"
"John," she whispers, "don't let my life distract you from yours. Just because I had a cruel mate doesn't mean I think you should stop your plans to be bonded. Are you truly in love?"
"John," Mycroft says, getting onto the floor with me. He takes both my hands and tilts my head up so I'm looking at him, "Stop. It's okay."
"Excuse me, sir, can you show me the way to Buckingham Palace?" The tourist speaking is a Chinese man who is smiling ruefully at Johm, clearly lost.
"No."
“Hey, you’re awake!” Sebastian exclaims, looking pleased, as he enters the room.
Now that Sherlock knows my past, I'm able to let go of some of my reservations and actually be friends with him. We work together up in the lab, with me playing assistant since I can sit for a while if my healing body decides to pain me.
“Our new flat!” John stares at the screen for a few minutes, hums as he scrolls through the pictures, mumbles a bit in agreement, and dozes back off. Clearly John has a low tolerance to pain medications, seeing as how he’s going back to sleep. Then again, sleep is probably better for him right now, with how much pain he’s in, so Sherlock leaves him alone. Rather than bother John, he types out a long email to his brother to thank him and tell him that they are coming back to London. He tells of John’s getting shot, and asks his brother to please look into doctors for them. Mycroft emails back a list of doctors, and the brothers rocket correspondence through cyberspace for the rest of the flight. By the time the warning has come on to fasten their seatbelts, Sherlock and Mycroft have found a physician and physical therapist to work with John, and Sherlock has found no less than three new cases that, from the descriptions at least, look like they could be at least a six.
He finds the clothes he wants and takes them in to Sherlock. "Here."
"Yes, I do believe you're right. You're a good boy, Mycroft," she says, cupping his cheek and kissing him again. She kissed Sherlock, then John, and left the room. As soon as she was gone, Sherlock made a face and began scrubbing at his cheek.
"Hello, I am Mycroft Holmes. Would you like to see John?"
The next few days were a bit chaotic. They had found Van Coon dead in his flat. Though the Detective Inspector in charge of the case had believed it to be a simple suicide-which John had personally agreed with-Sherlock's brilliant deductions proved them both wrong. Detective Inspector Dimmock was forced to reexamine the case, and Sherlock was given free rein-though dubiously.
John leads Sherlock into the bathroom, sitting him on top of the toilet. "Right then. I'll grab you some clothes. They definitely won't fit, but I'm not letting you parade around naked while you're waiting for your clothes to dry."
"Tense, nervous, ready to know the sex of our child," Sherlock bites out.
"Wha' 'bou' me?"
"No," he mumbles, "Don't want you to touch me. Just John." Having said his piece, he nuzzles into John's neck, still shaking a bit.
"Clearly, John. I actually didn't know about the existence of this house, I'm impressed, Mycroft."
"Yeah. Listen, we're heading into the countryside today. Young Omega kid got lost. You remember the one that watched us train last week? Kid went missing the same day; brother only reported him missing today. Well-to-do family though, so everyone is panicking."
His words halt everything- my anger, my sadness, everything. "How can you possibly think that after what I just told you?"
“I don’t avoid him. I just see no reason to involve myself unnecessarily with the Detective Inspector. If the level of communication which we currently master is sufficient, why should I upgrade to physical confrontation?”
“Detective Inspector Gregory Lestrade. The Alpha whom you avoid at all costs.”
"Why?" Sherlock shakes his head again. He either can't or won't talk about it.
Sherlock pales. "Something is wrong. He'd never be gone that long."
"No, it's...fine."
Softly, John tiptoes cautiously down the stairs. He hears voices, and grabs a poker by the fireplace. He promised Molly they wouldn't hurt anyone, but desperate times call for desperate measures, and John will do anything to protect his pack.
“Spaghetti, Sherlock! I left you alone to cook spaghetti, and you nearly burned our flat down!” John jumps in.
"You got bonded?!"
“It’s not here, we haven’t found a case,” Lestrade repeats.
"Good luck," I say.
"I love you, John Watson, my mate, my Omega. I love you."
"I don't just care because he's my boss, you know," Anthea tells him.
"John, I'm going to move you." I can feel my body being lifted, and I'm in someone's lap. There is a comforting, familiar, safe scent there which automatically calms me. I nose against the scent, and feel hands wrap around me in response. "I'm here, John. We're here." Other hands rub along my spine, and I calm more.
"Smell so good. I want you."
"Hi, Big Brother. Listen, you may want to come down here. Your brother has bloody chucked someone out of a window, multiple times."
Greg folds his arms into a no-nonsense posture. “I wasn’t asking.”
"Hello Mummy."
That was a week ago. Since then, they had returned to London. Sherlock promptly ran into his room and squirreled away. Mycroft hadn't seen him since.
Without a word, Mycroft stands and vanishes into the darkness like a vampire.
John had just stepped away to discuss Sherlock's changes with Doctor Sawyer when he feels a growing sense of panic through the bond. The sense of 'other, alien, but respond and protect all the same' alerts him to the fact that Sherlock is awake. He excuses himself and runs down the hall, knocking on the door in warning as he blasts in.
"Hello, Sherlock," Angelo greets. "May I take a look at your Omega?" It doesn't take a genius like Sherlock or I to realize my biology-is-only-transport brother has fallen slave to his biology and feels the drive to protect John.
"John? John? Earth to John, come in John."
.............................................................
Now they were home, and it was obvious that someone had entered their house. “Sherlock, get behind me!” John ordered, Alpha growl creeping into his voice. Surprisingly, Sherlock follows his directions without complaint.
Mycroft still stares at his screen. "My eyes are the same color as yours, Mummy. If you truly forget, I suggest you look in a mirror. Furthermore, my job doesn't wait on me, and this email must be sent within the next two minutes."
"I can't just go away, Sherlock. We bonded, remember?"
"Sixteen. Mike's sixteen too. Molly will be sixteen next month. Jim's seventeen."
"I'll walk away," Sherlock threatens.
After dinner, Sherlock and I went into Mycroft's office with him and Greg to talk. We both wanted to be sure they knew they could come over any time, but that we wanted space as a newly-bonded couple.
"My father. Reinforced by Mycroft."
"We've been waiting for literally the past hour," informs Jim sassily.
Our conversation leaves me so disconcerted I mob Greg as soon as he comes home from work. After all, he's had a soulmate for a bit, maybe this is just the natural flow of things.
He stumbles into his house, fumbles his way up the stairs, and collapses into his bed and immediately drifts off to sleep, before changing into bedclothes or even brushing his teeth.
“Hmm? Oh, I do. It’s just annoying the way he can always figure out your life history. So I call him a freak to even out the playing field a bit. There’s not much else I can do to defend myself, his tongue is like an acidic sword.”
Greg doesn't come to his bed at all in the night, and from what he tells me in the morning, he never will again. "Mycroft asked me to move into his room with him!" Greg tells me joyously.
I wince as he stands me up. My muscles have been tight for three months, but this takes the cake. I notice Sherlock's sharp eyes on me and try to cover my grimace.
A sharp snarl is his only response.
"Sherlock's brother?"
"Yes, to the hospital, and no, they won't tie you up. I won't let them. Can you trust me with that?"
Mycroft's eyebrows climb higher as I speak, nearly disappearing into his hairline. "Did you talk to Sherlock at all?"
John is on watch and fairly happy. He’s left Sherlock with Sebastian for the time being, and all he has to do is finish this watch-which will be over within the next twenty minutes-and he is done with the Army and can bond Sherlock. After a short, three-day mini-heat for Sherlock to bond John (it’s a little hard to bite someone with a bonding bite when you’re unconscious) they would fly back to England and get settled into their new life in London together.
It's Christmas Eve, and John is woken up early by a knock on the door. He rolls out of bed with a fond smile at his sleeping mate and answers the door. A workman of some sort is on the other side, holding a clipboard and looking bored. "Hello, is this the Watson-Holmes residence?"
"Not to the hospital, don't take me there, they'll tie me up again!" begs Sherlock.
"Yes, and he invited Lestrade to dinner through me. So it'll be you, me, Mummy, Mycroft, Lestrade, and Anthea."
We head outside. I slide John's jacket on, though it's three sizes too small, in hopes of warming it for when we find him. "John? John if you can hear me, answer me!" I throw all of my Alpha strength behind the command. If John is anywhere in the vicinity he will be compelled by his Omega biology to answer me. He doesn't.
However, Sherlock is nesting again, and he's not too pleased with the strangers and the scents they bring into his flat. He snarls at them, generally snapping and making a nuisance until they agree to leave him and John to their own devices.
"I know it is," retorts Sherlock defensively.
“I thought Eddie Van Coon might be one of the people being notified through the graffiti. He was a new trade banker, recently been to Hong Kong. He’s as good a starting place as any. I also lifted his address book off his desk, it’s got his home address written in it. We can start there.”
Now, for the first time, the boy looks surprised. "It is?"
"Oh." Three hours? This surprises me. Then I realize something else. "How do you know how long I was learning?" It's Sherlock's turn to look embarrassed for once. "And while you're at it, why don't you tell me why the table keeps moving?"
"What?"
.............................................................
"Okay," John replies, and he sets off to make tea.
Sally takes it in stride. "Was it your big brother? Lestrade talks about him sometimes, how he watches everything. If it's him, it will certainly be more difficult to get you away from him, but it's still doable."
Lestrade follows them, though he's not invited, knowing that if Sherlock finds anything that resembles a bomb he is more likely to try to detonate it than to call someone to actually deal with it safely.
Instead, his wife was nowhere in sight. His eldest son was reading a book while simultaneously dueling his youngest in front of the fireplace.
"Yes sir," John agrees, jogging off. He runs to the phone and dials the number.
He hears a voice demanding, "Did you jump out the window?"
“Sherlock, ice isn’t going to-“ Sherlock lights the candle, and John suddenly realizes what he’s going to do. “Don’t you dare!” he protests as Sherlock climbs atop his hips.
"You're still wearing the vest, get it off John, please take it off, I can't stand to lose you John, please, please," Sherlock says in a litany.
Approximately three hours and fifteen minutes after Sherlock first left his flat, he has his answer in his hands. "Pregnant," he whispers to himself in wonder. "I'm pregnant." He keeps whispering the words, hoping that if he whispers it more frequently to himself he will start to believe it. "I'm pregnant. I'm pregnant." His hands cradle his flat stomach as much as possible, curving around nothing. "Hello baby. I'm pregnant. Can you believe it? Now we've got to go home and tell your daddy. Oh my god. John. Does John want a baby? I mean, it doesn't really matter, seeing as how you're already here, but does he want to raise children, or will he make me give you up for adoption? Adoption might be better, I'm not really parent material, but for you I could learn." This quiet monologue keeps him busy for the entire trip back to England, and consequently makes other people shoot him weird looks and avoid him, which is even better.
Laughing, Jim allows himself to be pulled away.
“I mean, eventually I would like to have sex. It doesn’t have to be today. And you always have a right to say no.”
One glance at him breaks John's heart in two. Sherlock is staring at him in shock, looking as though he's been betrayed. It takes John a moment, and then he realizes what Sherlock seems to believe-that he, John, is Moriarty. Desperately, John looks down at the readout from Moriarty, hoping there's something for him to say. Fortunately, there is.
"Yes, my brother Mycroft."
"Morning," Mycroft says politely.
"Shut up, just shut up! You don't know a thing about me!"
John turned so he could see his bonded fully. "I keep hearing you say that, who taught you that?"
“Where are we going?”
“Guess I did win. Listen, I need you guys to give your statements. Sherlock, you still maintaining that you didn’t see the shooter?” At Sherlock’s confirmatory nod, he says, “Great, I’ll just write that, and you almost went into shock, so your deductions failed us. Bummer. John, you didn’t see any signs of the killer, right?”
"Sherlock! It's alright, it's okay," he continues babbling, not even sure of what he's saying, but knowing he needs to reassure his mate.
.............................................................
"Then most people are idiots."
"Anthea is on her way. Are the Americans still with you?"
"You're a doctor, you should also understand consent. This is me consenting."
A couple bangs pull him from his reverie about an hour later. He goes downstairs to find John is making tea, completely undressed.
"I want to be Daddy."
“I see,” Mycroft says when Sherlock had finished. “Do you have a picture of the markings?”
They are still curled around each other when Mycroft's trusty umbrella is heard on the stairs, and a moment later the government official steps into the room for the second time that day.
.............................................................
Mycroft goes beet-red, which is fascinating to John, though he doesn't know why Mycroft is embarrassed.
"I don't want a better Omega," John responds sincerely, hoping Sherlock can read the truth in his body, "only you."
I digest that for a moment. "I think I might be gay. I fantasize about kissing Sherlock way too much to be straight."
"John is my mate!"
Mycroft rolls his eyes, and his lips purse very tightly together as Sherlock removes the piece with ease. In a few moments Sherlock has all of the pieces out, and Mycroft has not gotten one. Sherlock gets up, grinning, and he pulls his brother to his feet as well. "Presents now, c'mon, Mycroft, c'mon John!" Mycroft gets yanked down the hall, and John follows the brothers, laughing to himself. Inside a different room is a huge Christmas tree, probably eight feet in Sherlock's estimation, that Mycroft has had Anthea decorate with Christmas decorations. Sherlock laughs once. "Do you still hate Christmas so much, Mycroft?"
Morning dawns brightly and entirely too early. Sherlock is up and raring to go, so after chugging a quick cup of coffee John is out the door.
Anthea climbs into the car and shoots him a look. “You can’t avoid him forever.”
"Five and a half,"Mycroft answers.
“Hello,” he greets her smoothly, deftly snagging the teapot from the air as the startled Omega woman drops it during her tea ceremony. “Careful, those are ancient relics.” He smiles at her then. “I’m Sherlock Holmes. This is my mate, John Watson. We’re here about some graffiti, and we think you might be able to help us.”
"It's fine." The two lapse into silence again for several hours.
"Good."
'No, I'm not. You would jump at seeing us either way. -SH'
Sherlock's eyes widen a bit, and he goes red. "John," he exclaims breathlessly. "You- I'm cooking!" he sounds scandalized.
"Of course. I always wanted a soulmate. You get one and you're not even sure you want him. Plus, Sherlock was my celebrity crush."
"I know," answers Sherlock. He leads me gently into the dining room and helps me sit, thankfully not picking me up completely. As he does, Jim, Mike, and Molly stumble into the room, wiping sleep from their eyes.
"Put that thing down, darling," she scolds lightly, standing and pressing his hand down toward the floor. "Let's talk business."
"Got it," he finally says, exhaustion coloring his tone. "Remind me again why this couldn't wait?"
"Mummy called. Father died. It was a hunting accident. Ironic, all the times I wished him dead, now he's dead, and I can't properly enjoy it because Mummy is traumatized. The gun went off in the living room as he was cleaning it, so Mummy witnessed the whole thing." He sighs. "I should cancel my meeting. I'm going to do that now. Come along, Sherlock, John."
"We can catch the killer," Sherlock insists.
Lestrade clears his throat. "Right, that's a bit scary," he chuckles. "The body is over here, if you wanted to have a look," he tells Sherlock, sweeping his arm. Sherlock swoops over like an overgrown raven, moving about the body and instantly rattling deductions.
“Sebastian! You don’t look like a crab.” After making this announcement, he happily launches into “Under the Sea”, slurring all the while.
“That’s brilliant!” John interjects.
Mycroft Holmes is ready for a break. After a long day, and night, and now morning again of arguing with the Chinese, a solution has finally been reached and international crisis averted for the moment.
"Mycroft? What are you doing?" Sherlock asks as he stares at his brother's tense back.
"Nobody!"
"Hey." John can feel a lot of turbulent emotions through their bond, so he sets aside the cookies he was in the process of wrapping. "What happened?"
John hustled out of Tesco's, carrying the groceries he and Sherlock would need for the rest of the week, as well as the pastries and tea for himself, his mate, and Dimmock.
Mycroft is already seated and dressed to the nines. He's methodically eating a grapefruit. I watch Greg grab his arm and yank him in for a kiss, which is entertaining. With the way Mycroft looks right now, I wouldn't want to touch him, much less kiss him. Greg obviously doesn't think the way I do.
Mycroft is sitting at the Diogenes Club when his cell phone rings. Fortunately he is in his inner office where talking is permitted, so he promptly picks up. “Anthea. Is Detective Inspector Lestrade being recaltricant with the case information? Tenacity is an admirable trait, but I believe he may take it too far on occasion. Just reassure him that we actually do need access to the case, smooth his feathers a bit so he doesn’t think we’ve trying to undermine him, and phone me again as soon as we have those files.”
"Thank you," Mycroft replies, grabbing his laptop. He navigates effortlessly to the CCTV cameras, bringing up the one in front of 221B since that is the most logical place where Gregory would be. Snow has started to fall, drifting large fat flakes into the man's silver hair. He looks ethereal, like a Christmas angel come to Earth. "To you as well," he tells the man generously, allowing some of the Christmas cheer to overtake him.
He bursts back into the room where they had first met Soo Lin, and goes pale as he sees her lying there dead. He swears again, guilty and angry.
"Shhh John, go back to bed. I just wanted to see if Mycroft is dancing to my CD."
"If the two of you are done, we can do Christmas presents," John interrupts.
"I know," Sherlock tells him, smirking. "Now if you'll excuse me." He moves past them, working his way to the door.
"I don't know who would, but I can guarantee you the British Government would pitch a fit," John answers. He moves so he's blocking Sherlock's body, making it clear that a threat to Sherlock is a threat to him, and he will protect Sherlock unto death.
“He got shot.”
"People don't apologize to me."
"Please," Mycroft begs.
"How could I not? Running away, escaping your father, forming your own pack and surviving for three months on your own- do you see the strength that took?"
"John!" Sherlock gasps, tugging frantically at John's jumper. Once he gets it off, he hurls it haphazardly across the room.
"John, you are not allowed to go on any more dates," Sherlock announced.
"I just wanted to wish you a Merry Christmas."
“God yes! I just didn’t think it was enjoyable for you, since I made you stop.”
We were also going to move out. Sherlock found a nice flat on Baker Street. The landlady is very sweet, too. She knew Sherlock-he helped make sure her husband was arrested and received the death penalty- so she was positively overjoyed we'd be moving in. Didn't even care we were gay, only wanted to discuss wedding dates because "Mrs. Turner next door has married ones," whatever that's supposed to mean.
He wakes to the doorbell echoing through the house. A quick glance tells him that it is six o'clock in the morning. 'Who comes to the door at six in the morning?' Wiping sleep from his eyes, Sherlock stumbles to the door and swings it open.
John reacts like I've electrocuted him. He stiffens and jerks away simultaneously. "What?" I have enough time to regret my words before he smiles and requests, "Say it again, please?" so timidly.
John turns back to human and goes to Sherlock. "Are you okay? Did they hurt you?" The boy doesn't answer, but stops trying to scramble up the wall and throws his arms around John and doesn't let go. "Sherlock, did they hurt you?" John persists.
"Oh." The two mates glance at each other and burst into giggles. When John finally gets himself under control again, he asks, "What are we doing here?" Seeing Sherlock about to give a sarcastic answer, he says, "No, seriously, what? Here to see the Queen?"
"Clearly." Sherlock's gaze shoots her up and down, deducing her, though John can't tell what he sees. At one point, Sherlock's gaze swings over to him, and John stares back at him, confused and utterly out of his depth. Sherlock's gaze swings back to Irene.
Sherlock goes over to John's laptop-conveniently located by John- and very nearly crawls into his mate's lap as he's checking the flight details. "Flight double oh-seven," Sherlock mutters. "There's something familiar about that." On the case now, he pushes himself up so he can pace. He makes it all the way to the mantel, replaying a scene in his Mind Palace. Mycroft had come, had answered the phone, and had returned to the room saying, "Bond Air is go." The words replay in Sherlock's mind, but they are enough to make his blood run cold. If Mycroft is involved in this, he has just made a grave error.
John morphed back into human, glancing up at the two Omegas who were watching them impassively. If you ever wanted to find a way to convince a bunch of military men to show off, bring Omegas that smelled like the ones before them. Gorgeous.
"I'm not blackmailing you," Dimmock argues. "I'm simply speculating on a possible course of action that is very likely to occur in the future."
"Well I'm sure that's encouraging," Mycroft says lightly. "We eat dinner around 5, please come down then." He shuts the door and John hears his footsteps travel off down the hall.
“Whatever are you doing, Brother Mine? Or perhaps, since it is obvious you have broken into my house and are currently searching through my information on code-cracking, you would explain the case that you need help with?”
"Why is his name changed?"
John stares at him. Sherlock is hunched in on himself, looking significantly smaller than he did in the bar a week ago. He looks uncertain and vulnerable. "I'm not like that. Not everyone is out to get something from you. I'm going to get you clothes now."
"So, yes or no?" Sherlock asks.
"I'm not upset," he tells John quietly. "What does that mean? Am I not normal?"
Sherlock huffs and whirls around, grabbing supplies off the shelf and tossing them at John before mumbling, "I'm going to get the banoffee pie supplies," as he walks off.
"I love you," Sherlock says again, leading John out of the bathroom and into their bedroom. They climb in together, Sherlock still wrapped in the robe with his hair shining like diamonds with water droplets. Within moments, John is asleep. Sherlock stares at him for a while, tracing over his features with a light touch, watching this man he loves. Eventually, he too falls asleep.
“Mr. Holmes, do you think I’m stupid?”
"Sure. In the morning though, it's too late now."
I begin pacing around anxiously. I know Mycroft has gotten out of the car too, and that Jim has moved to the side, watching me with anxious eyes, but I can't stop to assure them I'm okay.
Lestrade sneaks out of his office as the two kiss. He shuts the door softly, and looks up to meet the eyes of his entire division, plus Mycroft Holmes.
"Did John hurt you?"
“I’m not supposed to do that though! This stupid body never does what it’s supposed to, and I hate it! It’s so-so-so…John, my body never does the normal thing. My brain whirls around, lighting on things that are important for a half second before it zips past. I don’t have friends because I have no filter, I blurt out every private detail about people like I’m their own personal advertising billboard. My heart doesn’t work because I don’t care much for people, and I don’t care about the dead bodies that Lestrade and I work with, and that’s why I’m a sociopath. Now I have a mate. Do you know how many people told me I wouldn’t have a mate? People hate me, John, they hate me, and now I’ve gone and found a mate, and I screwed it up because the second, the second I actually found someone who was literally perfect for me in every way, I ditched him at a crime scene! Not only that, but I ditched you when you were in pain, and you didn’t know how to get home, and I just abandoned you! I’m not supposed to be able to abandon you, I’m supposed to nurture and care for you!”
John serves up plates, and he and Sherlock go to find the rest of the family. Mycroft is in his mother's room, holding her hand. Neither of them are saying anything, and it seems Mrs. Holmes' tears have run out, for the moment.
"Sherlock?" the woman echoes, and the gun in her henchman's hand is leveled at John. "Come out, Mr. Holmes, or we will murder your mate!"
"That's a relief," he tells me, lips descending on mine. We kiss for a while, his tongue caressing mine lovingly, and I'm squeezing against him begging for more-more kissing, I adore this- when Jim yells out to us.
"Hey, I just heard you're off to London on an emergency. Is it Harry?"
"Come on, we're getting out of here," Mycroft tells his brother.
Mycroft's ever-present limo drives us over to Baker Street. We exit the car together, Sherlock's thumb rubbing circles around my hand.
"Sorry."
I do, feeling Jim settle behind me, and I grab his arm for support. "What happened, John?"
"Well, this is a nice turnabout, isn't it?" John reads monotonously. He makes sure the device is where Sherlock can see it, and tries not to feel offended at the look of utter relief that crosses his mate's face. "I've stopped other's hearts, I can stop John Watson's next. What should I make him say next? Gottle o'geer, gottle o'geer..."
John comes over. "I want to marry you, John," Sherlock says, sliding the ring onto John's finger.
"Sure, John," Sherlock said, with a glance at the cab driver, and that's all that was said about that topic.
John isn't in the clearing, but there is a large log that might be hollow, so I run over, drop to the ground, and wriggle in.My soulmate is lying in the log, shivering.
"I could happily murder your father and not lose any sleep tonight," Jim tells me. "I'm glad your mom was there to keep you safe. Mine wasn't. You're not alone, and you're stronger than you know. Your Alpha is right about that part," he tells me. He leaves then, and Sherlock and I are left alone.
"I kissed Greg!" I exclaim.
"We are not breaking into that museum."
"Yes. It's due back soon, but I'll renew it."
"He texts Greg sometimes. How does he not know he exists?"
“It’ll be fine, trust me.” Sherlock answers as he lights the candle and passes the needle through it. Once he is satisfied, he threads the needle. “Ready?” He doesn’t wait for an answer as he begins to sew.
"That's a bold move," Lestrade says. "I decided that I would just grab a veggie and fruit tray."
The man is completely unprepared for John's attack, so he loses the gun. Unable to free himself as a human, John morphs into wolf form and wriggles quickly out of the ropes.
"I can walk by myself."
I leave the two of them at it and go upstairs again. I find Mike and Molly in Molly's room, bent over math homework.
"He already has," I say firmly. "We're going to be bonded, tonight. Because he loves me and I love him."
In the meantime, Sherlock and John have taken a taxi to an area near Irene's residency. They climb out of the taxi and Sherlock straightens his clothes. "How do I look?"
"Thanks Mom. I'll talk with Sherlock and get back to you."
"Mycroft? What is it?" John questioned, concerned. Even he knew this was abnormal behavior for the government official.
"Oh, a soldier!"
He feels a pang of sadness as he thinks of his brother and how alone he is. Mycroft doesn't realize all the good that comes from having a mate, he sees only the bad. Sherlock hopes that someday his brother can find someone too.
As Greg goes to talk to the Alpha who’s intimidating Sherlock, the stranger ducks into his fancy car. After a moment, the door opens for a woman to climb in. The car sits there for a moment, the woman rolls down the window and calls out, and then the window is put up and the car rolls away.
"Because he's MY mate!"
Sherlock smirks a tiny bit, but it fades abruptly. "I refuse to be slave to my biology."
"Isn't he smart enough for you?" Sherlock continues on relentlessly.
"Oh my god," John whispers quietly.
John smiles. “You should be nicer to him.”
The paramedics look to John now in confusion, waiting for a command to override his wishes. John gives them his best Captain glare. "You heard him, don't touch him." One of the paramedics sheepishly offers him a shock blanket, and then they all back off an appropriate distance.
"I got cash out of the bank and went to France, same way as I did with the pregnancy test. Do you like it?"
"Myc, dear, how many times have I told you-no laptop at the table?"
John was running through medical drills with his friends when a fellow captain came running up. "Watson, phone!" The man barked, handing him a slip with a British phone number written on it.
He dumps a pile of snacks onto John's bed. Surprisingly, he grabs a piece of chocolate, unwraps it and pops it in his mouth, still jabbering a mile a minute.
Once they leave, Sherlock glances at John. "Thank you. For not telling them I threatened you."
They continue along this vein until they hear a voice call out, "Hello!"
“John? What are you doing here? Mmmph!” Sherlock protests as John crosses the room, tugs his mate up from the floor, and kisses him, pouring all the love and relief he felt at seeing his mate still alive into the kiss.
John finds himself feeling glad for the break, because it both gives him time to heal and gives him time to get to know his mate better. After the first ten days, he gets his sutures (stitches) removed from his shoulder and he gets to begin physical therapy that same day.
"Is Mycroft okay?" Anthea asks as soon as they make it out to the patio.
John winces internally. "He stopped by while you were sleeping."
He glanced around the room curiously at the silence meeting his proposal. "John?"
Sherlock emails and they all hear the chime of a notification over the video. Mycroft clicks a pen and begins writing the numbers onto a pad of paper.
Mycroft's mouth twists into a condescending little smile. "Very good, John, looks like Sherlock is rubbing off on you after all. Irene Adler is a dominatrix."
"My look?"
Another graffiti mark and dead body later, and John somehow found himself where he was now-fighting valiantly to stay awake on top of a stack of books. The books were stacked in their flat to the point that 221B looked like it should appear on the American TV show 'Hoarders' because Sherlock was hoping that the code fifteen and one related to books, the fifteenth page and the first word, and from there-well, John wasn't really sure.
"Twice," Irene emphasizes.
"Alright. John, I'm pregnant."
"Mmm, good. Glad he's carrying on life as usual. Caring is not an advantage." Seeming placated, Sherlock collapses back onto the bed. "Get these tubes out of me, then go away."
"Never play stupid with me, Molly. It's evident you'll be seeing your boyfriend later tonight."
"Sherlock," John begins, but then he turns to his mate and sees the tears streaming down his cheeks, "oh darling, it's okay. He's going to be fine."
"Wait!" Sally cries. "I need you to look over something for me!"
"Soo Lin began defining the code. The shooting began before she got the chance, so she must have begun translating when you ran off to find me." He holds up the paper from the table which has a couple words written by the graffiti. "She gave her life to help us, to give us the translation of this code. We can't let that go in vain."
When he wakes again, he is in some kind of tunnel. He's tied to a chair, he can tell that from small twitches. No way to tell if he's alone. Cautiously, he cracks his eyes open.
"John? This shirt doesn't really fit," Sherlock reports, wandering into the kitchen.
Mycroft finds one in the gardener's shed, and promptly lays into the floor with such a fierce expression John and Sherlock both back up reflexively. After a few minutes, Mycroft speaks. "John, why wouldn't you allow the hospital nurses to release information to me?"
1) Harry was supposed to put the dishes away.
John has evidently heard it too, because he stops brushing his hands across Sherlock's ribs, freezing like a deer caught in the headlights. "If it's that woman again-" John mumbles, fire in his eyes as he untangles himself from his mate.
"They're all sweet in the beginning, you naïve boy," my father tells me. "Just you wait. He's got his claws into you, he'll show his true self soon."
John wakes abruptly to a loud shout. Fumbling beneath his pillow for his gun, his eyes search wildly for the threat. After a moment, he realizes that- 1.) he has fallen asleep on the couch, so his gun is not beneath his pillow, and 2.) they are not being attacked by Moriarty or his minions, Sherlock was shouting at Mycroft and has his arm wrapped around his wrist. Mycroft looks embarrassed, Sherlock looks confused and scared.
“Are you alright now that you know about your wife?” Sherlock asks, settling into his chair to make it clear he’s not leaving yet.
"The shy one is a little girl."
Murray, Gregson, and Sebastian also teach Sherlock how to play “party games”, meaning they try to get him to talk about his life and his relationship with John. After they find out through Never Have I Ever that no one has EVER done anything that Sherlock has (“He says he once broke into a morgue and stole a skull. Just drops that in there like he expects we’ve all done that in our life. And he hasn’t drank, done drugs, slept with anybody, kissed anybody, like I swear, John, you can’t play Never Have I Ever with that kid, you’ll stay stone sober all night,” complained Murray later) they quickly give up. They attempt to teach Sherlock how to play Truth or Dare, but after Sherlock vehemently turns down a dare to kiss John, they decide to end that, too. Sebastian jokingly suggests that they teach Sherlock Seven Minutes in Heaven, which everyone quickly vetoes because they all value their lives too much to have to tell John that they did any kind of anything with his innocent Omega. After that, they go back to poker.
"A little, yes," I answer truthfully. "I really wish you would have spoken to me regarding this whole issue. But I can't fault you for trying to be experienced for me once you made the faulty assumption I was also experienced."
John shook off that distracting thought, throwing himself into the drills.
"Sure, I'll go after you."
“We’re here, mate.”
“Then quit humoring me. We both know that you only want the case information so you can destroy evidence-mainly the ballistics report if I had to guess. After all, it sure would be a shame if anyone looking at the information were to connect the dots and realize that it’s awfully odd that Jeff Hope’s killer used a military-grade weapon, and the Omega being threatened at the time had an Alpha who had very recently been discharged from the military, one whose Alpha hormones were running rampant due to a recent injury and of course, the threat to their new mate. Fortunately, that information has already been disposed of, so if you don’t need anything else I will wish you good day and thank you to leave my case with me, sir.”
"No, of course not!"
I am so so sorry to all of my lovely readers that it has taken this long for me to post! Excuses time: I had two tests (one a major final) and tonsilitis within the past few weeks. On the plus side, all that crap is resolved now, and I graduated, so I should have more time to write again.
"He's real," Anthea reassures him.
"I know."
"Wait, a smuggling ring?"
"Shouldn't that be Sherlock's job?"
Mycroft smirks. "I don't threaten, I promise."
"Before that?"
The cry of sirens breaks the air, and Lestrade and his team run up. Sherlock stares at him, mystified. "Ask and you shall receive?" he jokes. John smiles in response.
"I'm a sociopath. I don't have feelings."
"I pick whichever is the cheapest, or whichever brand I like the best."
Sherlock arches one eyebrow, a condescending technique he copied off his big brother. "Did you ask me in here just to insult me?"
"Yes. A situation has arisen which requires your expertise. You are to fly back to London immediately. There is a flight leaving the base in one hour. You will be expected to be on it. I will meet you at the private airport as soon as you arrive. You will be briefed on the situation and sent in. I'll see you then."
Sherlock glares at him. "Quit being stupid, it's beneath you." Mycroft closes his mouth with an audible snap, though it's clear even to John he still has more he wants to say. "Shut up!" Sherlock reprimands.
My Alpha frowns. "I think you have PTSD," he tells me.
Mycroft and Sherlock leave, and I lie there and stare at the ceiling until it's time to get up.
"You'll want this one. It's Sherlock Holmes." Lestrade leaps up and jumps into his car, Sally right on his heels.
There is a sleek black car waiting once John's helicopter comes in. The tall Omega man who John recalls to be Sherlock's brother leans against the car propped by an umbrella.
After a long indeterminate pause, Sherlock nods. "I'll help," John offers, and Sherlock just nods again. Together, the two men strip Sherlock of his hospital gown, John being mindful to cover his Omega with blankets before his entire body is exposed to the Detective Inspector.
"Yes, it was good, thank you."
"A girl. One of each," John whispers reverently.
Sherlock shrugs. "Not tomorrow. It's Guy Fawkes Day. Did I tell you Mycroft is hosting a dinner?"
“I’ll text Big Brother.” After a moment, Lestrade has his answer. “221B Baker Street. Donovan, stay with John, I’m going to flag a taxi. You can take my cruiser. And so help you if you call Sherlock a freak one more time.”
John slips into class quietly, sneaking with his head down to the back row, ignoring the hot gazes of alphas on him. He has his hoodie up, a small defense to block out the world. He feels someone move into the seat in front of him, and has never been happier in his life to hear his omega buddy Mike Stamford say, "Okay, John?"
"In the future, I would suggest you stay off other people's tables when feeling particularly...amorous," Mycroft says, glaring at his brother.
"Do you want my help or not?" Lestrade answers. "And my name is Greg."
"Sherlock, you are being slightly irrational right now. If you want, you can come with me to the store, but we can't go hungry because I was kidnapped yesterday."
"Right, I'll call this in and we'll-"
Out in the main corridor, right by the entrance, Greg is trying to soothe an Omega woman. My legs grind to a halt, watching interestedly.  "Here, ma'am, if you'll just follow me into here-"
"Who did, then?" John questions. "The scars didn't come from nowhere."
He shakes his head, inhaling deep breaths and wondering why the whole flat smells like an Omega in heat. "Sherlock, what have you done?"
John drifts off immediately after. Sherlock stays awake fretting for a bit longer, but eventually he too succumbs to sleep.
“Of course she did! I just explained to you that the splatters on her tights make it obvious that she was pulling a case behind her.”
"Rule two," Jim responds, "we're only going to steal from rich Alphas. They have materials to spare. Otherwise we don't touch it."
A few more months passed since the disastrous Irene Adler incident. Sherlock had recovered fine from his drugging, and the next day he was back to normal, bouncing around the flat and loudly proclaiming his boredom like a drama queen. He had gotten his Belstaff back somehow, and much to both John's and his dismay, had found Sherlock's phone programmed with a new number: that of the dominatrix. That in itself wouldn't be a problem, if not for the fact that she had changed the text alert to a woman receiving pleasure, and seemed to take a perverse amount of pride in texting Sherlock consistently, though he never responded.
"Yes you have," Mycroft tells me in a no-nonsense tone. "But John, you can fix this. You're already trying, which is a good sign. You have to actually talk to Sherlock, you know. Tell him what's happened."
The first thing he does is to pull of the scarf and make his bite from earlier a bit brighter, then make a larger mark above the scarf so it can't be hidden.
"No."
"I-" my hand flies up to cover his mouth.
"It's fairly rare. It is more common to run in families, though. Are you bonded, Mr. Holmes?"
“She didn’t have a case.”
When we get into the driveway, I leap out almost the instant the car stops. Sherlock clambers out behind me while Greg and Mycroft exit the other door and hold it open for my mother, who takes Mycroft's hand and comments about true gentlemen. She pats Greg's cheek, reassures him he's found a good Alpha, and dutifully follows Mycroft inside.
"Okay, show me what you've got."
'I will -SH' he answers, then he turns his phone off and slips it into his pocket. He prays Mycroft believes him, but even if he doesn't, he cannot be there for approximately two hours. Hopefully, that is enough time to research pregnancy tests. Sherlock flags a taxi and has them take him to the nearest library. From there, it takes forty-five minutes to decide that there is literally no "better" pregnancy test, and he resigns himself to the drugstore.
"Because my mother was right there."
"Yes, they're all fine. I'm a father, Mycroft."
He turns to Sherlock then, sniffing him curiously. 'Is he bleeding, is he hurt, is he afraid of me now?' He whimpers softly at that thought.
They reach Lestrade's office and he ushers them inside, shutting the door behind them. "There are a bunch of suits looking into the bombing near your house. I think your brother might be involved," he says. Sherlock nods without saying anything, glancing around the office to deduce anything new about its owner.
"I've got to get back," Lestrade tells Sherlock, "but you've got my number, don't be afraid to use it."
"I think so, yes," Molly answers finally. "There HAS to be someone out there who can love me, besides you guys."
John nods, suddenly feeling exhausted. If Moriarty is on the loose, he will bide his time, then strike again. They are not safe; they may never be safe again.
"Shut up, trying to think," Jim answers, scratching the list. "Anyway, I'll go beg some money today, see if I can get enough for another one."
"What?" John cuts in. They had never talked about this before.
Donovan rolls her brown eyes. “Yes, he’s in with his wife, which means you are not to go in there. I just explained that.”
"John? You're with us. It's okay. We found your soulmate, so we all moved in," Molly answers. The response, though disjointed, is enough to remind me of what happened. I try to move, but it shoots horrific pain through my body. Has my soulmate hurt me already?
"Christmas shopping, John."
He swings open an office door. The interior is significantly larger than I might have imagined anyone of his age to have. I can't tell if he decorated the interior or not-the room is detailed in the dark colors Mycroft seems to prefer, with no personal touches to denote its owner. But then again, Mycroft's house looks much the same way.
Lestrade laughs. "And how'd you know that? The way I buttoned my shirt? Position of my paperweight?"
“The one and only.”
John does.
"Boss of what?" Dimmock asks.
He smiles, taking her hand. "We're at a new stage in life, my darling. We're grandparents now."
"How do you know that?" Irene questions, captivated.
Mycroft takes the obvious distractor with grace. "With luck, never. Or perhaps, if I'm not lucky, when she's on her deathbed."
Sherlock smiles triumphantly. "So they are in this room. Thank you. John, didn't you want to return that bowl, or were you planning to hold it in your hands forever?"
"Great! So where can we find-"
"She's dead. The Woman."
The man detaches his lips from Mycroft's with a growl, dragging in air, body heaving. "Beautiful," he intones in a deep sexy voice. "You're so gorgeous, Mycroft."
.............................................................
Sherlock rolls over and rubs his sleep-filled eyes. "Why is your superior calling at six in the morning?"
I don't realize I've spoken aloud until Mycroft answers me. "Do you need people out?"
'Trust me.' The words ring in John's ears, and he decides to follow Sherlock's advice. He pulls back his fist and punches his mate in the face. "Oh! Are you okay?"
“We’re under attack. C’mon, kid, let’s go.” Sebastian calmly walks to the door, hand on Sherlock. Cautiously, he opens the door and peeps out. “Keep close.” They dart out into the shadows, moving swiftly but surely through the night.
The man looks shocked. "Detective Inspector, I appreciate your concern, but I have trained for moments like the one I ran into. I am no standard civilian."
'That's strange,' John thinks. It's not until he finds the bag of clothes, warm winter clothes, all nicely folded that he becomes truly alarmed. He pulls out the shirt on top and holds it up, moving over to the mirror. It would fit perfectly. As John deftly refolds the shirt, his fingers brush over a piece of metal. John grabs it. A metal tracker gleams from between his trembling fingers.
The first thing Sherlock does is to grab a knife off the mantel, currently next to Billy, stabbed through some papers, and cut into the box. He holds the phone up, recognizing it instantly as Ms. Adler's camera phone. She must be in incredible danger to gift it to him for Christmas, because that camera phone was her life. In fact, there is a good probability that she will be found dead before the day is out if he is being given this present. He pulls out his own phone to text Mycroft. 'Irene will probably end up dead before the day is out. -SH'
"On second thought, I don't want the sledgehammer."
"Hello, Sherlock."
John says nothing; he's smiling so much his face hurts but he can't stop. His children, their children, are moving! He drops down and presses a kiss to Sherlock's abdomen. "Hi, little girl. Hey there, little boy. It's your Papa speaking."
"When we first met, I told you I was married to my work. You are the most critical part of the Work, John. Obviously, I am married to you."
Sherlock breaks into a grin. "She'd love that. We'd better deliver that invitation to her in person though, otherwise we might get beat with a purse or some other such nonsense. We can hand-deliver Lestrade's and Sally's, too."
"Nothing new, really," Sherlock remarks flippantly.
She smirks. "No, you're not. You're rejoicing on the inside. I'd make a sociopath joke, but the honest truth is that I'm rejoicing on the inside, too. He went back to his wife, and I'm just done with him now."
"What?"
The stranger leans down and begins licking paths up and down Mycroft's abdominal muscles with his tongue, tormenting Mycroft.
"Yes, it is," replies John.
“Yes, sir.”
Sherlock seems surprised but he quickly recovers. "Doesn't matter. You?"
"Oh." Sherlock drops his brother's hand and sits silently as Mycroft meanders to the bathroom. Once he is safely sequestered away, Sherlock glances at John. "Sorry I woke you."
“My father for now, but it may change later. Do you have any limits?”
Now Mycroft is truly at a loss. His eloquent words are rendered useless, his cigarettes are ignored, he has no idea how to comfort his brother anymore. "Merry Christmas," Sherlock says, and he vanishes back toward the morgue. Mycroft pulls out his phone and dials John, knowing he will be a far better comfort than Mycroft.
"Thank you."
“I couldn’t remember if I actually knew how to cook spaghetti, so I was looking in my Mind Palace for the directions. I just forgot I had the oven turned on and water boiling. There was no need to call the fire department, it’s just a slight bit of smoke.”
"Now I know I'm hearing you wrong," John says, "you and Donovan hate each other, why would you want her to be your child's godmother?"
"And the politically incorrect answer?" John teases.
"What?! It's been a long day, I've been fighting with the Chinese-pretend I didn't just say that- what could you possibly need from me at one in the morning?" Mycroft looks like a wreck, and John feels bad for him. He has bags under his eyes, his hair is mussed, and it looked like he had been roused from bed-or possibly not gotten there yet.
Sherlock throws himself next to me, which makes me jump. A quick glance at him makes me realize he's not attacking, he's pouting.
It is cold outside, but Mycroft seems impervious to the cold. Sherlock doesn't wait or try to talk Mycroft down, he grabs his brother's arm and hauls him down the ladder. John catches him before he can be hurt.
"Just saving her time. Isn't that kinder?"
"Let me know as soon as you come up with something. Greg, we're going to have to communicate between the four of us and get this thing planned. Babies are lots of work, and baby showers can be overwhelming too. Don't worry," she says, turning back to Sherlock and John, completely ignoring the panicked look Lestrade is shooting her, "our goal is to make this as effortless for you as possible." She walks away muttering about color schemes.
"Oh god, yes," John responds. He picks up his mate and carries him off toward the bedroom bridal style.
"Mycroft?"
John clears his throat. “Feel better now that you got all that off your chest?” he questions as Sherlock turns to leave.
"Mycroft, it's John. I know you're mad at me, and you have good reason to be. Don't be mad at Greg though, I kinda forced him to-"
"Coming," John agrees, grinning affectionately at his mate. He ruffles his hair as he passes, which causes Sherlock to yelp and retaliate.
"Just last week he had his first."
I shrug. "Sure." We sit in silence until I fall asleep. In the morning when I wake, I am nestled safely in my Alpha's arms. And although a large part of me says I should fight this, I nuzzle in closer until my Alpha stirs.
"Sally, we talked about this!" Greg growls, slipping into Alpha mode like a second skin.
Once outside, he realizes that Mycroft is probably watching his credit cards, so he can't just go to the store and buy a pregnancy test. First stop: the bank. Once Sherlock has one hundred euros in his pocket (hopefully that will be enough, it's not like he's ever looked at the cost before) he jumps onto the tube. The tube takes him to Dover after about an hour, which is perfect. He's told John he had a great idea for an experiment, and not to worry about him, so he can probably be gone all day before John and/or Mycroft start to worry. It's possible, anyway.
"That smart look. Seeing through you, he's got that look too. Even with him looking tired I can see that."
"Can you just stand here and watch me? Help me stay focused? Because otherwise I'm going to end up leaving these supplies to do my experiments."
Cautiously John agrees. "Fine, but let me know if you run into any trouble."
"My shirt hurts my skin." Sure enough, John can see Sherlock has a bit of a rash breaking out on his otherwise clear creamy skin.
John does as he's told, though his mind is whirling as he tries to find a solution that will allow him and Sherlock both to walk away from this. He walks out into the pool, and hears his mate's shocked, "John?"
"For God's sake," Sherlock snaps, and he hauls off and punches John.
Mycroft wanted two things right now, his brother and a high place to think things over. Fortunately, he could have both at the same time- since he had helped pick 221B Baker Street, it had been a stipulation of his own that the place have a 'high ground' area for him. When he had emailed Sherlock to mention it had a second bedroom up the stairs, his brother had offered that he could use it to think whenever he wanted.
"What are you thinking about?" he asks John.
"My father. He hurt Mycroft too, he's got scars from being thrown into the fire, but once he left for the government job my father started hurting me a lot more. He didn't like me because I was too smart and impolite. I didn't tell Mycroft because I knew he'd come back and I didn't want that to happen, he deserved to get away and be safe."
"Did it hurt when he bit you?"
"Yes it did. Your father broke you, John, but you've picked up the pieces and mended yourself. You're not broken, John, and you are certainly none of those other words either, any more than I am the words bullies slung at me. They do not define me, and your father certainly doesn't define you."
"He saw a couple signs of abuse, falsely presumed they were your handiwork, and banned you so you couldn't hurt me again," Sherlock replies.
"Mycroft?" Greg's voice is full of shock, and it makes me turn to the door. Mycroft stands there looking like he's going to be ill. "Mycroft, I-"
"If that's what you want, then do it," John tells him supportively.
Alright then. Clearly John needed to word things a bit differently to get any kind of answer that would make sense. "What I mean is, why am I here with you?"
"Good Samaritan."
"Yes we're all so overjoyed," I hear my mate drawl behind me.
“Immmmm hurt.”
Abruptly, John leans forward, on high alert. “Murray, did you see that?”
"There's your mother and father, but I believe we can combine them, and Harry and Clara will want one too. That's two. My side of the family is my mother and Mycroft, so that's four. Mrs. Hudson, Molly, Lestrade, and Donovan should all receive an announcement too, which takes the total number to eight. Then we'll send to your Army friends: Sebastian, Gregson, and Murray will all get sent cards, so that's eleven. Did I forget anyone?"
“Okay, calm down. Donovan, Anderson, get in the car. C’mon, John. Grab the laptop and get in the front seat, I’m going to need you to navigate.”
"Sherlock!" John finally yells back.
"This one?" he demands, holding a pill bottle up so his brother can see. Mycroft grunts in agreement and Sherlock hands it off to John.
There is silence for literally five minutes. I can only assume the precocious Omega I spoke with is relaying my message to his friends so they can decide together the best course of action.
"Not my division," he answers, frustrated at being called for something that is so clearly not what he was trained for.
John awakes at around seven in the morning to find Sherlock has curled up with him. His mate is tucked around him cautiously so as not to injure him, which makes John smile. He wants to get up though, so he carefully picks Sherlock up, attempting to move him without waking him up. Of course, his arm gave out with a sharp lancet of pain the second he picks up his soul mate, so he drops Sherlock.
"Shut up and kiss me, John," Sherlock protests.
"Yeah sure," John says distractedly. "I'm off."
Meanwhile, Sherlock and John have made food. Sherlock heated tomato soup while John made grilled cheese and tomato sandwiches.
I remember my friend's sadness my first day here that Mycroft wouldn't let them share a room and I'm excited for him. "That's wonderful, Greg!"
"Of course. They are our friends, are they not?"
"My brother. I live with him." John arches an eyebrow. Stranger and stranger, this Sherlock Holmes. Omegas typically aren't permitted to live anywhere other than with their parents or a bondmate.
"Well, when I saw Mycroft for the first time and the only thing I could think of was that I really wanted his mouth against mine, that helped me realize it."
Sherlock goes upstairs, carrying the food. To his utmost delight, Mycroft is sitting up and his eyes are open. "Mycroft! You're awake!"
He throws himself at her, growling. She threatened to destroy his mate, and that means she needs to go. He rips her throat out in a haze of red.
Mycroft turns red. He hadn't expected to discuss Sherlock's sex life or lack there of. "There was one. Rescued him from other Alphas, took him back to his house, protected him throughout the duration of his heat. Never bonded him, refused all advances-the stereotypical fairytale Alpha most Omegas only dream of."
My brain stutters to a stop, and while it's offline I ask, "Does Mycroft know you have someone over?"
"When I was growing up, my Father liked to drink a lot. He often got angry when he was drunk, and he was drunk all the time. When I was young, like newborn to four age, my Mother was able to either distract my Father from me, or to keep me quiet so he basically forgot I was there. It worked out pretty well."
I realize a niggling instinct  is bugging me, informing me John is in danger. Probably emotional trauma, he is more susceptible to that than most people due to his history of abuse.
Mycroft visibly shrank a bit. "Yes, sir."
John nods. "Okay." He springs at Sherlock, catching the boy off-guard, and carries him to their bedroom.
It’s no surprise to Sherlock that he wakes in the Army hospital, because he can remember everything that happened up to the point of him passing out. What does surprise him is the fact that he no longer feels like he’s going into heat, and the fact that when he sits up he can’t see John anywhere, which doesn’t bode well for him. If his mate is dead, well, he’s not sure what he’ll do, but it’ll be drastic.
"Pips. It's a sign that the bombing will happen again."
His phone chimes, and he stares at the new text flashing across the screen from an unknown number, taunting him. "If you ever want to see your mate again, Mr. Watson, come to this location." It's followed by an address, one Sherlock knows well from his homeless network.
"Are you ready to go home now?"
"Hey, it's John. The twins have been born. They're healthy and beautiful and Sherlock is doing wonderful. Will you be stopping by Baker Street?"
“Why not?”
"Who?"
"Which ones do you want?" John counters.
"John, let's go have a look around!" Sherlock calls.
"Wonderful. We'll see you soon." John hangs up.
There’s an email from Mycroft, letting him know that he did indeed find a flat. 221B Baker Street is the address, according to Mycroft, and the best thing is that Mrs. Hudson is renting 221A, and she loves Sherlock because he found the evidence to get her husband killed when he blew someone’s head off. The woman was also willing to give him a discount, which meant he and John should be able to afford it with John’s Army pension, Sherlock’s cases-when he felt like taking money for them, which wasn’t often- and Mycroft’s bank account. Mycroft also let him know that he had already put down a security deposit and the first year’s rent, and he had moved in Sherlock’s things as well. He also included pictures that Anthea had taken of the flat in question.
Mycroft turns to my father and his eyes narrow. "So this is your father?"
At their laugh, Molly looks up and gasps theatrically. "John and Sherlock are beneath the mistletoe! Snog him, John!"
"Right, I was. So he's living with his brother, but he has clear signs of abuse on his skin. Burn marks and other scars, you know. He wasn't conscious at the time, so I banned his brother just to be safe."
Once dinner is finished, we sit around talking for a while. I lean in close with my mother, catching up on what's happened with my family since I left. Harry got bonded, though my mom says they fight all the time. After she left, my dad got a lot worse, eventually getting to the events of today when a well-meaning neighbor called the cops.
"Flight leaves at eleven. Two and a half hours for security makes it nine thirty. Driving time adds on another hour, so eight thirty. And it's six now."
"I'm not fretting. I just get to see you so rarely, and you're always engulfed in that computer. I forget what color your eyes are."
“Why don’t you like Sherlock?”
"Hello?"
John jumps on the man, tearing into his leg with a vengeance until the man releases his mate. Sherlock scrambles away, out of reach of the wounded man who is reaching for him again. John snaps at him, throwing him to the ground and killing him too, but not before ripping his arm off as a warning to anyone else who might try to hurt his mate.
Dead silence. John can tell that they are thinking about how to respond, which he appreciates. No snap answer or cliché, his friends are thinking about how to respond.
As he works, I watch him. He moves with a surprising amount of grace and can make even this look beautiful. I watch him for a while until he glances up at me. "What?" My face goes red, but I can't figure why.
"Great job, buddy," Mike tells me as he hugs me.
"Boys, please, not here," reprimands John.
"Where's Mycroft?" John had really been hoping to avoid that question. How to explain to the boy that John had had him banned due to the signs of abuse Sherlock exhibited? "He had a government thing," John offers in explanation.
"I'm standing right here, talk to me, not about me," Sherlock snaps.
"Yes," John answers for them both, reaching over to take Sherlock's hand.
"Yes, nice job, you've done well," Sherlock reassures him, staggering away with a hand to his face.
John nearly jumps out of his skin when the roof access door is slammed open. A Detective Inspector with graying hair runs out onto the roof.
Irene startles awake suddenly. "Sherlock," she purrs in greeting, stretching out her arms above her head. "Good morning, handsome."
"I'll help you contact him, but I need you to get off that ledge," states Lestrade calmly.
“Still in surgery.”
"What more do I need? We're not even dating! I need you to ask me out, then you can propose, then we can be married. The standard way a relationship works!"
"Yes, James Moriarty sends his love." Unbeknownst to Sherlock, Irene is on the plane. She has obviously entered behind them. John decides to place the more obvious threat to his front and shoves Sherlock out of the way yet again so he can protect him from Irene. Mycroft is angry, yes, but ultimately John trusts that Mycroft will not hurt his brother. Irene is a wild card, and John doesn't trust her.
“How is he doing? Did we get to him in time?”
Watching Sherlock in the kitchen isn't that bad, John decides as he sees his mate begin gathering materials and mixing them together. In fact, there's points like now, when Sherlock is bent over to grab a pan from a lower shelf, that John realizes he would gladly watch Sherlock for hours if he was asked. Sherlock straightens and grins at him. "See something you like?"
Sebastian looks up from reading the telegram and jogs off for the phone, eager to hear about his godchild and their sibling, and of course his best friend and his mate. He dials the numbers excitedly, pacing anxiously as the phone rings. He puts the phone on speakerphone as Murray and Gregson catch up, all of them eagerly surrounding the phone.
'See you whenever. -SH'
Soo Lin shoves him out of the alcove. "Go! Find Sherlock!" John runs off, heart in his throat. His heart regains a normal-ish rhythm as he sees Sherlock up ahead, clearly not shot.
Sherlock's eyes snap open angrily. "What do you want?"
Gregory's eyes widen a bit with surprise.
"Something new," is Sherlock's completely unhelpful answer.
"Russia," Mycroft rasps. "They're allowed bigger doses...over there than here...I use these."
"But Mike and Molly-"
"See you tomorrow," he says, squeezing John's hand impulsively.
"Yes, sir," his driver answers. Mycroft grins in the privacy of his car where no one can see him as the car speeds toward Baker Street.
“Very well. Good day, Detective Inspector.” The click in Lestrade’s ear signals that the mysterious elder brother has hung up.
After Sherlock got over his conversation about sex with Mrs. Hudson, he seemed to decide he didn’t mind a little bit of affection in their relationship. John would often wake up to find Sherlock next to him in the middle of the night, though the young Consulting Detective still didn’t sleep very much, much to John’s chagrin. However, John's Alpha saw this as the boy feeling safe enough to be vulnerable with him, which was wonderful progress given his history.
"Oh, shut up!"
"Sherlock?"
Sherlock tells John that he googled some more party games on his own, and found one he thinks he’d like to try. “Twenty Questions, John. That’s the name of it, but the idea is kind of stupid. You think of something and people have to guess it within twenty questions. My research suggests that some young people use the game to ask twenty questions about whatever they want.”
"Sherlock, sit down, we are going to talk about this."
"Let me see your foot, Mycroft," Angelo tells me, so I sit down and let him inspect me. John's poker didn't break my bone, but I do have a small hole in my foot which is treated. More papers are given about diet and signs of infection, and Dr. Angelo finally leaves with a whirl of his white coat.
“The body?” John questions. Something about that seems relevant, though his drugged mind refuses to work fast enough to tell him what it is.
*End Flashback*
Sherlock doesn't answer. "I'd like the sledgehammer now."
Sherlock gets done faster than John, and paces around the room anxiously. Appearing fed up, he shoves John's plate out of the way and climbs onto the table. "John," he whispers, fingers coming up to trace John's face. John leans forward to connect their mouths, intent on keeping it chaste. A soft gasp from Sherlock and his resolve is flying out the window. His tongue delves into Sherlock's mouth, tasting the lunch he had just eaten, the taste of decaf tea, and underneath it all, the uniquely-Sherlock taste. Sherlock groans beneath him, and John surges up, pressing him back onto the table. He climbs up a bit, settling on either side of his mate. Sherlock cants his hips desperately, gasping, "John, John, John, yessss!" John's hand is just traveling up Sherlock's abdomen, tracing the home of their children, when two sounds interrupt him-breaking glass and a clearing throat. The breaking glass can clearly be attributed to their plates, which are now shattered into pieces on the floor thanks to Sherlock.
"Hope he's okay. Call me when you know anything, alright?"
"You are my heart," answers Sherlock.
"There's nothing to forgive," Mycroft says lightly. "It wasn't you."
Mycroft straightens himself out again, glances at John with a self-conscious smile, and then places a hand on his brother's back, almost the Ice Man once again. John moves a bit so he can touch Mycroft too, physically reassuring the man he doesn't hold him responsible for the meeting with Moriarty. Mycroft looks shocked, but he doesn't move away.
"I was so scared," Sherlock gasps. "All I could think was that I don't want him to die."
"Um, no," they both answer together again.
"Yes, but is that what you want? It's our children, John, believe it or not the sociopath does value your input," he jokes.
"Sherlock, it's nothing to be ashamed of, I promise. If you're scared of him, I can call Gregory-"
"Oh, you're rather good." Sherlock cannot help but be the tiniest bit impressed by this woman, despite everything. Begrudgingly he offers her the real phone, their fingers brushing the tiniest bit as she takes it from him.
“Yeah, we did.”
“If you’ll excuse me, I need to take John and Sherlock’s statements from that case yesterday. Please see yourself out.” Lestrade turns to Sherlock and John. “Hey guys, give me a few minutes here to pull up the information about the case and I’ll be ready.” As his wife sees herself out, he begins typing at the computer. “You were right, you know, Sherlock. Not really a surprise is it? You normally are.” He laughs humorlessly. Then he straightens, and types at the computer again. “You have got to be kidding me! Sorry guys, someone’s locking me out of the case information. Give me a few minutes…”
John laughs. "You shouldn't tease your brother," he reprimands. "Let him figure it out for himself."
Then he stands up. "Mycroft, goodnight. Come along, John." He leads him down a flight of stairs, through a hall, and pushes open the fourth door to the right. "Welcome to my room."
"My god, really?"
"Uproar looking for you," reports Sebastian. "The guy you came with is panicking that you're dead."
"Do not make your mother do your work for any reason. I expect better from you!"
"No. It was Sherlock Holmes' older brother. He was vague, so I don't know what is actually wrong."
"I think he will be."
Sherlock rolls his eyes. "Don't be."
“Wassit?” John questions, having woken up to Sherlock’s exlaimation.
Sherlock is sitting in his chair, grinning mischievously, as John enters the sitting room. He pounces, growling playfully at his mate. Sherlock is quickly pinned to the chair and John straddles him.
Mycroft leans forward, unable to keep the smile off his face as he tells his driver, "Sherlock has had the twins. I'm an uncle."
"Lestrade, we've had a break-in at Baker Street."  "Send your least irritating officers and an ambulance." He listens to Lestrade's prattled concerns, cutting him off rapidly. "Oh no, no, no, we're fine," he reassures him as he continues to glare at the American. "No, it's the-the burglar. He's got himself rather badly injured." The American stares at him, confused. "Oh, a few broken ribs, fractured skull," Sherlock tells Lestrade in response to the man's question of what, exactly, is wrong with the burglar. He fully intends to ensure these injuries are present by the time Lestrade arrives, and he makes sure the American knows it. "Suspected punctured lung," he continues. "He fell out of a window." Then he ends the call. In an instant, he has the American pulled to his feet and hurls him, still tied up, out the window.
"What exactly does he do again?"
"You're right. In the future, we'll use your office instead," Sherlock says, patting Mycroft's arm as he walks past.
He hustles outside and begins pulling weeds with a vengeance. He hates Harry for provoking his father, hates his father for hitting him.
.........................................................................
“It’s the only way to save Soo Lin’s life, John! The killer’s closing in!”
Sherlock frowns in clear disagreement, but shrugs again. "Whatever you feel like making, I guess."
"Your brother called us a painter to get the nursery done as a Christmas present to us both. He also set up things to do around London all day so you're not affected by the paint fumes. Then we're to spend the night at his house, and come back the next morning when the paint is dry, which he says will be in time for our party."
“I have no idea what you mean.” The unspoken message is clear: we’re not discussing this. Not now, not ever.
John gently dumps the Omega onto the bed, then turns and literally bolts out the door like he's running a 400 meter for the Olympics. He pulls the door shut behind him, then grabs his gun and settles in front of the Omega's door. He will keep his Omega safe.
“We’re in the hospital.”
"Go home," he tells Sherlock and John.
Sherlock is already darting back inside the house.
“You yourself are fine, you simply fainted from being over-stressed as you went into your heat. Your body began a sympathetic connection to John, and when he passed out, you passed out shortly thereafter. We gave you a bit of IV fluids, and you will be fine. We also gave you heat suppressants. It forced you out of this heat, and we suggest you continue taking them until John heals enough for you to have a three-day heat and properly bond him.”
John turns off the alarms, lowers the bed, and crawls in, tenderly undressing his Omega. The first thing he notices, besides the overwhelming skinniness, is the round cigarette burns in odd patterns on his torso. John growls. Abuse, clearly, probably from Mycroft. Once Sherlock is bonded, John will make sure his brother has to stay away. His Omega will not be hurt again.
"Like the cutesy little safari scenes?"
"No Sherlock, sorry," they chorus together.
To John's shock, the man doesn't even bat an eye when Sherlock makes his request. He requests to be shown the bedroom, and immediately begins sketching on the walls. "We will lock up before we leave," the man assures him as a river begins to take place under his skilled fingers. "Mr. Holmes demanded it."
John gulped, but ran out of his room. "Yes, sir?"
"Thank God," Sherlock says, "it's about time you realized she was cheating on you again."
"You too, Mycroft," they call. The two men link hands and travel up the path, climbing in Mycroft's car to take them back to Baker Street.
"No! I don't like you, I want my brother!"
"Top floor," the woman tells him kindly.
It's eleven o'clock and John is just finishing his first beer. He's been out for a few hours at this point, but drinking slowly because he knows he's a lightweight. His friends are either very drunk or on their way there.
The man has never looked more relieved to see them in all his life, Sherlock notes. He doesn’t look murderous, just sad, which is probably good, because Sherlock wasn’t too sure he would be good at talking Lestrade out of a murder.
