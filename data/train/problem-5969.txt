“Sounds a little too sweet for me,” Tony sighed. “How bout a black coffee with two shots of espresso,” Tony said with the first bit of confidence he had in a while. “Oh and your favorite pastry.” Tony smiled and was back to his charming usual self.
There was one person who might be awake. He felt bad about resorting to this but he really didn’t want to be alone right now. Peter picked up his phone and scrolled through his contacts at about half the speed he normally would until he found who he was looking for.
Steve muttered something under his breath, but Tony couldn’t quite hear it. He did notice Steve pulling him in closer. “You’ll get sick too,” Tony said before turning away from Steve to sneeze. Steve seemed to ignore Tony’s concerns and went to unlock his car.
“My ma used to make them all the time when I was a kid.” Steve’s face turned a subtle shade of pink. “It’s actually her recipe.”
A short walk later he ended up at the cafe. When he walked up to the counter he could’ve sworn that Steve’s face lit up.
Tony had decided that he had worked enough for today because it was the weekend, and the best part about being your own boss is picking the hours you work.
“Just grabbing dinner with my roommate, Bucky.” Steve gestured to the boy beside him, who mustered a quiet greeting. “How’s the rest of your day going?” The blond finished.
coming up!” Steve was cracking himself up. Tony couldn’t help but smile. “That’ll be $3.83.” Steve continued. His laughter had died down now but he was still giggling to himself.
“Tony,” he smirked. “Pleasure to meet you uh …” Tony realized that he didn’t know the worker’s name.
Once he had a route in mind, he pulls out his phone and dials the number for Jarvis. “Hey, Jarvis I need you to send one of the self-driving cars over to Peter’s apartment. As fast as you can please,” Steve said firmly while running.
After what seemed like a hike across campus, Tony and Bruce finally reached their dorm room. Bruce placed his backpack neatly on his chair. While Tony just threw it and hoped it landed near his desk. Luckily for them, their dorm building was close to the dining hall so there wouldn’t be much walking.
Steve nodded and kept driving. After about five or six minutes he reached Tony’s penthouse. Steve got out of the car and helped Tony get out. He offered his weight for Tony to use as support and they walked into the building together.
“I’m Tony Stark, and of course.” Tony turned the charm up to eleven and hoped that Steve would use his number for other non-class related conversations.
It all started when Tony woke up. The sun pouring through the windows was too bright for him. Tony sighed as he went to close the curtains. His head pounded, it felt like someone had shoved a wad of cotton in his head. He felt awful.
If Peter heard Tony say that in any other context than right now he would have been mortified. But right now he didn’t really have the energy to fight Tony on it. A shower did sound really nice. Peter was pretty sure that he had been sweating for like the past four hours. Peter nodded his head and Tony helped him stand.
When Tony finally got back to his dorm room it seemed that Bruce had already left for class, leaving him alone for a few hours. Tony was getting a little hungry so he decided to make a cup of ramen and watch a movie until his next class.
Normally, he would’ve given Steve a hug but Tony couldn’t risk getting him sick as well. Now that Tony was closer he could see that Steve wasn’t writing, but he was drawing on the napkin. Tony couldn’t quite tell what it was but it looked good. Once Steve saw that Tony was there he shoved the napkin and pen into his pocket.
“Well, you know that I was just standing up for someone who couldn’t stand up for themselves.” Steve shot a look at Bucky.
“I understand. Just try to be on time for the rest of the semester.” Mrs. Greene said as she continued going over the syllabus.
“Order four bags of my usual coffee,” Tony replied as he was getting ready to go out and find his much-needed caffeine fix.
Tony read Steve’s messages and grew excited. Part of him couldn’t believe that Steve would want a second date with him. But, he shoved those insecurities deep down and responded to the messages.
“That doesn’t sound too good,” Peter piped in, almost like he didn’t know that they were talking about him.
“Tony, you’re warm. C’mon let’s get you out of here.” Steve’s voice was low and almost pleading. Tony nodded and they walked out of the diner together.
After what seemed like an eternity Tony made it to the diner. When he got inside, he saw Steve already sitting in a booth. Tony was only able to see Steve’s top half which was covered in a dark grey shirt with sleeves that ended just after his elbow. He looked like he was writing something, but Tony was too far away to be sure. He began to walk over to the booth and Tony suddenly became really hot. He quickly unzipped his jacket and sat across from Steve.
While Peter was adjusting himself into the couch, Steve grabbed a couple of cold towels and put one on Peter’s forehead and one on the back of Peter’s neck. Peter smiled at the gesture softly mumbled: “Thanks feels nice.”
“Oh my God, Tony! You walked here?! Like this?!” Steve was shocked. Tony flinched at the volume of Steve’s voice. “We can take my car,” Steve said much quieter. “Do you think that you can lead me back to your place.”
Peter was sick for the rest of the weekend, but he was glad to have Tony and Steve taking care of him.
Soon the elevator doors dinged open. Steve was once again astounded and at the same time very insecure. The living area of the penthouse was lined with pristine white walls, a giant plush couch, and a massive flat screen TV. There was also a connecting kitchen with a sizeable fridge and every state of the art device to make anything and everything.
Once they finished the first movie Peter insisted on a Disney movie marathon. Tony and Steve had no objections, just simply enjoying their shared time together on this lazy Saturday. Peter fell asleep about halfway through Hercules and Steve was asleep not too long after that. Tony decided to get some work done, but it only took another hour or two and Tony was taking a little snooze.
It was a beautiful day in New York City, the sun was out but not too hot and due to how early it was on a Saturday, there weren’t that many people out and about. The coffee shop Tony had in mind was surprisingly close. He had noticed the cafe opened a few weeks ago. Tony had been meaning to check it out but work got in the way.
Once the movie ended, Steve ever so carefully got up from the couch without waking Tony. He began to clean up the kitchen and searched for a plastic Tupperware to place to leftovers in. After making a moderate amount of noise, Steve finally found a container. He looked over at Tony, who was out like a light. It was pretty cute.
It was finally Friday! Tony thought this day would never come, the week seemed to drag on. Tony even managed to go full speed on his work so nothing would get in the way of his date. Pepper even commended him for his effort and unusually productive mindset. Or so he thought. Unfortunately, life had other plans for Tony.
It's been a few days since Tony had last been into Steve's shop, so obviously, that needed to change. Once inside, he spends some time with Peter and Tony asks Steve an important question.
Once again that proved useless. Peter decided that maybe some water would help. He mustered all his strength to try and make it to the kitchen. Peter attempted to stand but he immediately fell to the floor, and it was too much effort to stand back up so he crawled to the kitchen. After what felt like forever, Peter finally made it to the kitchen. Using the fridge as support Peter lifted himself for long enough to get a water bottle from the fridge.
Tony walked into the large science hall before class started and looked for Bruce. Once he found his friend he sat down and class began. The two boys spent the whole class time goofing off and writing little notes and doodles in each other’s notebooks. The class flew by. Mainly because neither of them were paying attention. The pair of friends got out of their seats and started to walk to the lab building where their next class would be held.
Peter and Steve laughed as Tony joined them on the couch. Tony ran a hand through Peter’s hair and ruffled it. The three of them settled in and watched the movie.
“Well, I should uh get back to work. I really do hope you come back.” Steve smiled as he walked away from the table and back behind the counter.
“Is everything alright with um … that kid … it just seems like … “ Tony’s voice trailed off and got quieter. He didn’t really know how to finish that sentence. Hopefully, Steve wouldn’t take offense. Normally, Tony wouldn’t even ask something like this, but there was just something about that kid that he connected to.
He checked his phone one last time and saw that Steve texted him a simple thumbs up. He pulled a jacket out of his closet and left the penthouse. He picked Lou’s because it wasn’t too far away and he figured he shouldn’t drive in his current condition. Not to mention that the food is pretty good.
Steve found the bottle of medicine and grabbed it. He quickly shut the cabinet and went back into the living room.
Steve came back with the towel, a pair of Iron Man pajama pants, and an old AC/DC shirt of Tonys. Tony smiled at the choice of clothing. “Do you know if we have any medicine for him?” Tony asked as he helped Peter out of the shower.
While Tony was waiting for his drink, he took in the surroundings of the coffee shop. He was watching a boy work, wiping down tables and sweeping. Tony got a better look at the boy when he walked towards him. He couldn’t have been more than 17. Definitely overworked, hopefully not the coffee shop’s fault. His face was rather pale making the bags under his eyes stand out. This kid was also quite skinny, it was a bit concerning.
At about half speed Tony strolled out of bed and scavenged the bedroom floor to find a suitable shirt to wear. After a few moments, he found one of his iconic band t-shirts and put it on.
But that didn’t stop Steve from doing what he wanted. Rarely anything ever did. What had sparked this particular desire was Henry Cavill rocking a mustache. Mind you, it was a mustache with a major five o’clock shadow that sucked the ickiness out of it. Steve had immediately gone all “I’ve never had one. I must live all life experiences. Commence objective grow porn whiskers.
He leaned his back against the warm stone, and pulled his legs up to his chest. At this point, he really didn’t care what he looked like. This was a kind of grief he hadn’t felt since his parents.
“Oh, sorry. Just a Mikey hotdog for me.” Before Steve could do his stupid chivalry thing Tony pulled out two twenties and handed them over. “Keep the change.”
They had talked about this particular kink exploration ad nauseum. Despite Tony having done it before, Steve couldn’t help but be cautious. They had established boundaries, and both promised to speak up with their designated safe words if they were in too much pain, or just straight up hating it.
Steve didn’t say anything. He seemed to be on the brink of passing out, and he was using every last bit of his strength just to move his feet.
The two men tangled tongues, seemingly attempting to see who could devour who first. Steve clutched Tony’s ass, one cheek in each hand, and spread them apart. It made Tony moan lewdly into the kiss that soon had to end in favor of oxygen.
Abruptly, Steve drew back to straddle Tony’s waist and survey his work. He apparently came to the conclusion that he’d missed a spot, because he dove back down to remedy the situation.
Uncharacteristically, Steve’s hand dropped and he returned to resting his head. It was worse than Tony thought then. He grabbed the water bottle and poured some over the wound to get a better look. The skin around it was an angry red, and there were early signs of infection.
There was a time that Steve would have continued puzzling, and asked Jarvis why he was deliberately not listening. They’d been together long enough now that instead he fixed Tony with a glare.
“Okay, perfect. We’ve got this. You just hold on. A little bit longer. We’re almost there.” Tony comforted, even though he had no idea if what he was saying was true.
“Incredible. Yes. Fucking hell yes.” Tony panted. He craned his neck to look behind him, eyes dopey in post coital haze. A small nick appeared between his brows when he looked down Steve’s body.
“Your turn, babe.” Tony growled as he quickly unbuckled his jeans. As soon as his dick hit the air he wrapped his hand around the both of them and began pumping. Before Steve could say anything for or against the development, Tony’s other hand wrapped around Steve’s throat.
Tony huffed, “it’s on mine.” but didn’t push the issue. The outcome would be a stalemate anyways. One of Steve’s large, capable hands worked its way through Tony’s hair, combing it and scratching his scalp. The touches were exceedingly gentle, and the last of Tony’s thoughts of resistance disintegrated.
The circuitry blurred and Tony leaned closer. At this point his nose was almost pressed directly against it. It did nothing to help his vision and he cursed, jamming his hand welder back onto its stand, and then madly rubbing at his eyes.
“Uhhh. Hey, Shellhead.” He lowered the painting and faced it in towards his leg, trying to take the focus of attention off it.
Steve mumbled something back at Tony who got to his feet and then hovered over Steve anxiously. He pushed himself to his feet well enough, but there was a sway to him, and a dazed look to his eyes that put Tony on edge.
“Did you calculate that in the two seconds it took you to do exactly the opposite of what I said?” Steve spat.
Even after excessively scrubbing, Tony’s hands were stained with the evidence of his work. Steve watched them elegantly glide his button up off it’s wooden hanger, and then vanish into the sleeves. They pulled and situated the well pressed collar, and his fingers were precise and quick in their practiced task of fastening each button.
“Mmm. Airways feel minty and crisp.” Tony let his head roll to the side to gaze at Steve through heavily lidded eyes. “Can airways feel minty?”
It was fuzzy, no. It was too bristly to be fuzzy. Whatever, it didn’t matter. Either way it resembled a dark blonde caterpillar who had made it’s home on Steve’s upper lip. Literally on it. His pretty pink cupid’s bow hid behind the curtain of hair and Tony wanted to knock the damn thing off Steve’s face.
“Congratulations. Your testosterone has taken on a visible shape.” Tony growled back before he swept his arm over the work table he was now staring at, sending papers, pens, hand tools, and snips of wire across the floor. It didn’t matter to him who was pitching, as long as it was fast and hard for both of them.
Tony flinched as if Steve had struck him. He recovered quickly, and sneered, “well then we both might have died, but you know who wouldn’t? The innocent civilians. Or are you putting our lives over there’s now, Captain America?”
The contents of the letters were always perfectly scribed in slanting, gorgeous cursive. Because of course Steve still wrote in cursive. The language was flowery, precise, well thought out. And so what if the first one had Tony sitting on the edge of his bed with tears in his eyes. How could anyone resist being spoken to, spoken about, like that? It was more romantic than any modern day gesture he’d ever received.
Curling in on himself, Tony squeezed his eyes shut. The grief and rage swirled together deep in his chest, and then rushed up into his throat and he nearly choked on it.
Sam nodded in understanding, and the two strolled over to the first kennel on the left hand side. The canine was undoubtedly adorable, but according to the profile hanging in a sheet protector, he wasn’t a fan of men, which he then vocalized to them with a low growl.
Meanwhile Steve didn’t think that Tony even kept them. Tony was a sentimental person despite all his assertions that he wasn’t, but Steve just couldn’t imagine Tony keeping a trove of letters. If anything he probably scanned them into a computer or something. Hard copies weren’t Tony’s thing.
Everything went still, their presence and entrance apparently shocking, and then commotion exploded around them.
Pet name. Nickname. Tooth rotting fluff. Sweet. Soft romantic Steve. Soft boys. Clint is a little shit.
“But then Sam told me I should rescue one instead, because you’d like that better, and of course he was right. So…” Tony finally stopped jabbering and took a deep breath. “Yeah. He’s yours. Hence the bow.” Tony held it up, smiling weakly. Now that he was trying to explain himself, he wasn’t sure it was a good idea anymore. He’d bought Steve a freaking dog!
Tony opted to rumble his own muffled, “mine,” while he worried Steve’s flesh between his teeth, refusing to let go.
“Guess I’ll have to go finish shaving it off, huh?” Steve sighed dramatically as he knocked his shoulder into Tony’s.
More tension seemed to leak from Steve. Whether it was from the adoration Tony had just looked at him with, the smell of food, or both, Tony didn’t know or care. He strode over and set the bags on the storage ottoman at the end of their bed.
“And not enough hours in the day.” Tony added, and massaged Steve’s left thigh. It was like a rock, and when Tony dug his thumbs into the muscle Steve winced ever so slightly, which meant it hurt a lot. “And if you want to help as many as you can, you gotta take care of you too.”
Tony pivoted back around, eyebrows raised incredulously. Sam was crouched down in front of the Yorkie, sticking his fingers through the chain link. When he finally noticed the stare of judgment he scowled.
His sleep was always interrupted by the same nightmare; freezing cold filling his lungs, and puncturing his skin with needles made of ice. He can’t breathe, and it’s dark, and then he’s on a train, and it’s Bucky falling into the dark instead. He always comes to clawing at the air and gulping for breath.
The moderate pace lasted longer than Steve thought Tony was capable of. When they reached an open field he came to a halt, and then dove down towards the swaying grass. Wildness expanded in Steve’s chest, and his heart pumped it’s own erratic drum solo. Even as the ground grew closer he didn’t dare close his watering eyes. At the last possible second Tony pulled out of the dive, and hurtled upwards again, the action accompanied by Steve’s holler of appreciation.
It had not been a good night. He’d only had not good nights since waking up from the ice. And as much as Steve would rather not sleep, being a super soldier didn’t take away that necessity.
Determination and desperation urged Tony on. It didn’t even feel like he was telling his body to move anymore. It just was. He clenched around Steve while frantically working his hips and legs. The angle wasn’t right though, and Steve knew that. Which Tony had just enough presence of mind to realize was intentional.
The workshop fell suffocatingly quiet after that. Steve stayed inside Tony, his hand braced on the small of his back and head bowed as his chest heaved. Tony lay boneless on the desk, breaths puffing against the glass, heavy lidded eyes focused on the mess he’d swept onto the floor.
Even though he knew Steve would be looking for him, and if for some reason he couldn’t Rhodey definitely would, as the next few weeks drew on his hope trembled.
Sometimes Steve would just watch Tony do things. It didn’t matter if it was a complicated task, or menial. He just liked watching the way Tony’s fingers moved.
Their water had long since run out, and the sun was rising steadily. Sweat soaked and muscles screaming, Tony pushed forward, his eyes aflame with determination. There was no way he was going to fail Steve. He couldn’t.
Tony let out a low chuckle before pressing his lips to hers. “Well, in that case Ms. Potts I am incapable of moving forward with our discussion. The level of distraction is too much for my perverse mind.”
Calloused hands took hold of Steve’s narrow waist, and Tony began moving Steve in addition to his snapping hips, slamming him back onto his cock as he thrusted forward. Moaning, Steve’s hands scrambled for better purchase against the dresser. It pounded into the wall to the rhythm of their movements.
Tony groaned and leaned away from Steve, pulling uselessly at the hand the other man had trapped in his own. “Nooooo. Nat needs her suit upgrade! It’s got a weakness to acid! What if the acid spitting spiders come back?”
Then a few weeks later he opened the cupboard in the communal kitchen only to be faced by three ancient looking, paisley and floral patterned mugs. He wrinkled his nose at them, and pushed them aside in favor of a Pac Man one.
It wasn’t often he had enough time, and their schedules matched up, for him to watch Tony get ready for the day. When it was possible he would lounge on their bed with Tank, and pretend to be looking at something on his tablet. In reality he would be following Tony’s every move.
There weren’t many options at two in the morning, but he had the channel that played cartoons memorized and turned it on. Eventually he nodded off on the overstuffed couch to the sound of Tom and Jerry’s shenanigans.
And slow he went. He lifted one hand and landed it on Tony’s left cheek in a soft, uncertain slap. The usually snarky genius didn’t comment on the hesitance. He was fully aware that this kind of play was new to Steve, and he needed time to warm up and orientate himself.
Clint draped himself theatrically over his chair. “Oh, Tony, you are such a doll.” He pawed at his arm like a schmoozing elderly lady.
The rest of the team plus a few others were already waiting for them. Pepper checked her watch in thinly veiled surprise, proving that Tony was never so timely.
Steve tore himself out of the daze he was in. “What? Wrong?” Steve laughed. “Tony, this is amazing!” The way Steve’s face lit up reminded Tony of the first time he’d taken Steve to The Met. It was an expression Tony hadn’t seen on Steve’s face for far too long, and he grinned back.
The two boarded the elevator, and arrived in the lobby a minute early. Which was probably a record for Tony.
In a disconnected corner of Tony’s mind he knew this is when he needed to back down, to meet Steve in the middle. It was clear that Steve was mad because he’d been scared. Not because Tony had challenged his authority. But instead of the, ‘I’m sorry. We should work on a compromise for when situations like this happen’ that should have come out, he declared a flat;
Steve stands at the threshold, and looks back to the safety of the wine cellar. He could go upstairs, collect his coat, and go home. That would be the smart thing to do.
“Hey.  You’re here.”  Steve smiles and his face protests the movement.  It’s painful but that doesn’t mean he stops.
It does smell like rain in the air. He wants to take Steve to bed and make love to him as water and wind thrashes and rattles the glass of his bedroom windows, as the waves churn below and thunder and lightning rages across the sky. He wants nothing but Steve’s warm skin against his as they become a tangle of limbs, as he makes Steve fall apart under his hands and mouth, his cries swallowed by the squall outside.
.” Natasha interjects, throwing a sugar packet across the table and hitting Tony in the face.  They both snap away from each other and look around.
“You’re ridiculous and adorable.”  He grabs the things from Steve and tosses them back down on the table, not caring that the hardcover tumbles to the floor with a thud.  “Leave it.”
“Yeah, that.”  Tony nods, agreeing.  “Big project, big deal, you’re exactly right.”  He bumps Steve’s hip with his own, his smile widening over Steve’s faint blush.
“I am under no obligation to make your snooping easier for you.  It’s not my fault Fury downgraded your clearance level.”
“Hey Carol, did he tell you I've been fucking Steve?” Tony asks loudly. Carol's gaze snaps back to him, and to her credit, she is nothing if not cool and collected.
“Yeah, but I’m exhausted and I could only come up with Beardy McBearderson and I think even you would’ve seen through that.” Tony leans against the doorframe and rubs his hands over his tired eyes.  Maybe it’s the conversation he just had with Pepper, but the day is suddenly weighing him down like a ton of bricks.
“Do you remember when they couldn’t stand each other?” Clint asks no one in particular as he snaps a picture of his food with his phone, then leans over to take a couple photos of Natasha’s plate as well.  He makes a noise of approval at the finished shot and nudges Natasha’s food back toward her.  “I think that was better, when they couldn’t stand each other.  Definitely.”
“We’ll have to agree to disagree,” Pepper states as she opens the heavy door to Tony’s new office, pausing to let him enter first. She closes the door behind them, listening to hear the latch catch shut. Sighing heavily, she looks down at the schedule as Tony circles around the large mahogany desk and sits down in the expensive handcrafted leather chair he’d had shipped directly from Italy. “He is expecting to see you in half hour’s time.  Shall I cancel?”
The others must expect him to break down the door and get in there with them, but that’s not who he is or how he does things.  He’s stubborn and determined, but he’s not thoughtless, or dumb.  They don’t get that his only option is to wait until Tony opens up.
“I don’t remember much of that, really.  I was talking to Peggy and then the plane hit the ice and then…nothing.  That is ‘til I woke up in Fury’s poor idea of New York circa ‘44.”
Steve looks at his reflection in the full-length mirror in front of them, Jan standing just beside it in her own smart black pant suit. He runs his fingers over the soft fabric of the tuxedo; it's not silk, but it's just as luxe.
Steve runs his own hands through his hair now, trying to hold onto the memory a little while longer.
“What, telling me over the phone doesn't have the same punch?” Tony finishes his drink, the liquor smooth and easy going down, and rises to make another. “Glad I'm here too, honeybear. It's nice to be a best friend in person sometimes.”
“Been waiting all day for you to get back.”  Is the only preamble to him slamming Steve to the wall and kissing him for all he’s worth.
“Pity. Regardless, we need someone with a commanding presence; this one, I keep expecting to call me Daddy and beg for a spanking.”
“I hardly feel like this was entertaining.”  It’s unbearably awkward; maybe they should shake hands or maybe he should just let Steve wander off or maybe he should walk him to the exit, he doesn’t know.  A long elevator ride to the ground floor sounds like a terrible idea.  Way too much time for him to say something else wrong.
Tony wonders if maybe Bucky has come once before this, rode himself to orgasm on Steve’s thick dick and then kept right on going. Bucky had said Steve’s stamina was almost too much for one receiving person to handle, but Tony figures Bucky’s recovery time probably ain’t that bad either.
The phone rings then, and Tony’s heart jumps up into his throat. He steps toward Pepper hopefully. She holds a finger up as she answers, warning him off.
Tony pushes his black horn-rimmed glasses up his nose as his lifts his head, looking toward Steve like he’d felt the weight of a studying gaze upon him.  He tucks the phone into the front pocket of his black pea coat as Steve closes the space between them.
Since Natasha’s wearing nothing but an oversized Captain America t-shirt, Steve can’t say as he blames her.
A half-empty bottle of cough syrup and a broken blister pack of throat lozenges sit on the coffee table next to a rickety stack of books, perilously organized with smaller paperbacks at the bottom and a massive hardcover on top. A rumpled copy of the New York Times is folded open to the crossword puzzle, half-finished in two different styles of handwriting and with two worn down pencils lying on top of it.  There’s also an abandoned game of chess, and a now-stone cold cup of green tea bleeding a ring of moisture onto one of Steve’s sketchpads.
“Not a problem, Cap.”  His gaze flicks away for a moment and then darts back, something like panic building behind his eyes.  Steve tenses because something’s clearly gone wrong, and he’s about to ask what when Tony moves, adjusting his grip in Steve’s hand and turning away.  “Hey, spin me.”
“Did you all miss me?”  Tony cackles.  This feels great.  It’s like riding a bike.  It’s actually easier than riding a bike, more natural.  It’s like breathing.  He’s finally breathing.
Pepper hadn’t been too thrilled that Tony insisted on Vegas, and she had gone on to Malibu without them, so Steve figures Tony must be doing his work in an attempt to smooth things over.
“I don’t know what you want me to say.” Steve’s very quiet, his voice so low that Tony could’ve missed it had they not been twined so closely together.
Steve opens to him easily, melting in his arms. Tony can feel the tension ebbing from Steve’s entire body, taut muscles relaxing underneath his roving hands. He sighs softly as Tony angles his head deeper, slides his tongue inside, and presses closer.
“I need even less shut-eye than he does.” He nods his head toward Steve, who shifts a little in his sleep, tightening his arm around Tony’s middle and nuzzling his face closer to Tony’s neck. Bucky’s gaze rests heavy on the two of them together, and Tony thinks back to the moment where Bucky got possessive, how he claimed Steve and then Tony as well.
“I’m a mess,” Steve nods his chin down to his chest, toward the ridiculous display of his clothing shoved every which way and the obvious evidence of their activities cooling thickly on his stomach.
“Of course it’s an illusion.”  Steve looks at him straight on and blank-faced.  It leaves Tony frankly puzzled and frustrated.  He takes a breath and puts his palms together, pointing his fingers toward Steve.
They wind down slowly, easing off as Bucky relaxes.  He slumps to rest his forehead against Steve’s, murmuring something too low for Tony to hear.  Tony stands stock still as Bucky laps up the evidence of his orgasm from Steve’s skin, starting at his neck and working his way back toward his mouth. The two men begin to kiss, a few rather chaste pecks in-between whispered words that evolve into longer, deeper exchanges, mouths working leisurely and tongues tangling and pressing as if Steve and Bucky are still trying to climb into each other, merge into one.
The only rush that comes close to this is the first time he flew the suit. He rests his weight down against Steve, naked bodies flush against each other. All his angles and curves meld to Steve’s, slotting together perfectly.
, and his chin and throat are shiny and slick with come and lube and spit. It should be gross but all Tony wants to do is kiss him, and kiss him, and kiss him some more. Tony closes his eyes against the overwhelming urge and re-doubles his efforts on Steve’s cock. Steve throbs inside Tony’s mouth and the taste of him spreads over the flat of his tongue, drips down his throat. Steve’s fingers clench tightly in his hair, pulling just enough to feel too good.
“Here.”  He gives the water to Bucky and moves clear from Steve and the bed.   Bucky looks at Tony askance and then gives Steve a little shrug before helping him to drink.
Tony turns back to his breakfast, already over his goat cheese and spinach omelette and eyeing Steve’s gluten free vegan French toast.  He contemplates how long it will take Steve to notice his wandering eyes and offer him some.  It won’t take long, it never does.
Steve runs his hands up Bucky’s taut arms, feeling the muscles shift under his touch. His fingers slip under the loose short sleeves of his t-shirt and find the curve of Bucky’s shoulders, then slide back down the cords of his tight biceps on one side, and cool steel on the other. Now that he can, he just wants to keep touching him.
“Tony,” Steve greets him carefully, setting down his bottle of water and trying not to wonder aloud why the hell Tony is here.
“Please tell me you can count cards.  Because that would be amazing,” Tony asks hopefully as they pass the black jack pits.
Steve thinks back to when they first met, shortly after the war. He’d been such a mess, all jumbled up inside, and Sam had invited him home for supper. By the end of the night, Steve had felt like they’d been friends for years. He certainly had opened up to Sam, unexpectedly letting loose some things he’d been holding tight.
“Well, from what it sounds like it seems like maybe you all needed him?” Sam points out. “I’m sorry this last stretch has been so rough, man.” Steve closes his eyes, resting his head back against the top of the seat. Sam is so kind, he thinks idly. It’s too bad he couldn’t have fallen for someone like Sam. It’s too bad Sam doesn’t like men the way that he likes men. But it’s easier for Sam that he doesn’t, so Steve doesn’t wish it too hard.
“I really don’t understand this,” Bucky says, slightly broken, and Tony wonders if maybe he'd made the wrong choice in handling it this way.
He’d asked Steve to move in with him the very next day, realizing he wanted Steve to hang and linger on everything he owned. He’d let Steve in, still half-expecting him never to stay, and even then he’d never been happier.
“Such etiquette!”  Clint reaches over and ruffles Darcy’s long hair, messing it into a tangle.  She groans in dismay.
The plan of attack is his to develop.  The weaknesses in Captain America’s defenses are his to find.  Killing the enhanced soldier will not be easily done; it’s not a simple matter of a bullet finding the right place at the right time.  It’s going to take more than that, and this is something Pierce understands.
“You want to…wanna sit?” Bucky gestures to the couch, and Steve nods, following Bucky quietly. The couch is light blue, extra long and overstuffed, and he’d been with Bucky the day he’d picked it out. He’d helped Bucky with most of the stuff in his place, now that he thinks about it.
!”  Bucky shouts a reminder as he hurries out.  Tony rolls his eyes, not so much at Bucky but the whole situation.
“I’m not going to –” Steve starts angrily. As if his body is deliberately out to prove him wrong, a fierce cough takes hold of him just then; he curls in on himself, the hand around the soup involuntarily tightening. The flimsy plastic curves under the pressure and the force of his cough shakes the liquid violently. Hot broth splashes over his fingers and wrist, drips down to the blankets and onto the couch.
The hot liquid runs through the ridges of his fingers and seeps over the granite, pools on the tile floor.
She licks the rest of the yogurt from her spoon before bothering to reply.  He tosses the magazine onto the counter beside her, going about his business as if unexpectedly finding a highly trained assassin in his kitchen at ten a.m. isn’t the slightest bit jarring.
“Something’s going on at the tower.” Natasha informs him and Pepper starts.  “JARVIS sent out the alert.”
Nick Fury places both hands flat on the bar top as he stops in front of Steve, glaring at him with his one good eye. Steve sits up straight, rather surprised by Fury’s unexpectedly harsh greeting. He opens his mouth to defend himself – against what, he doesn’t quite know – when Nick gestures in a circle around Steve’s body.
He can’t possibly get any closer to Steve but he keeps trying. He feels like he’s taking and taking and Steve’s saying yes only by not saying no. That’s not the same.
Tony straightens his tie, now a pale blue instead of the bright red he’d grabbed this morning when Steve had awkwardly watched him begin to dress. His whole outfit has changed, and Steve can see smudges of oil and dirt that weren’t there before staining the sides of his fingers.
“What point would that be, Cap?  That our team leader avoids team headquarters at all costs?  That he ignores nearly every request to take part in social gatherings of any kind?”
He remembers that night in Malibu when he woke to find he’d called the armor in his sleep, terrifying Pepper enough to leave him sitting alone in bed, soaked in his own sweat and trembling in fear and panic.  He couldn’t blame her for walking away, but that moment hangs in the back of his head as some kind of warning that this may be the one thing she can’t handle.
, even though he'd much rather not. It verges on disdain, but not quite. Even disdain would require more effort than Tony was willing to give.
“Guess now I need to swig some cologne.” Steve releases Tony’s hand with a smile and Tony sits up, not giving a damn, and chases the taste that lingers in Steve’s mouth.
“Well, I brought the wrong person to Vegas, clearly,” Tony comments.  Steve starts to get up, figuring that they should go if Tony’s not enjoying the concert, but Tony pulls him back to his seat.  “No, no, sit down, you big lug.  I think she’s about to wail out that song from
“I know one thing we could get up to.”  Steve runs a hand through Tony’s hair, and it feels more amazing than it has any right to.  Even so, Tony’s not fool enough to hope that the next thing out of Steve’s mouth will be a lewd suggestion.
“He’d be hard against me. Against my back. Sometimes lower, rubbing between my…” He hesitates, and Tony fills in the blanks. He can imagine it vividly, Steve cradled against Bucky’s broader body, the only thing separating them the thin fabric of their worn cotton boxers. Steve stirring to the feeling of Bucky’s cock pressed close, the hard length of it nestled between his cheeks, and Bucky rocking his hips just enough to get friction, arms tightening unknowingly around Steve in his sleep.
“Hmmm.” Steve smiles faintly at that, tilting his head to lean on Tony’s shoulder at Tony’s encouragement.
“Looking forward to slathering this all over you. Who said being sick wasn’t fun,” Tony quips with a lascivious leer and a playful wink. He gingerly helps Steve lie back against the couch cushions and then stands. “I’ll go run the bath, I got one of those sparkly bath bombs that Pepper used to like in here somewhere –” He’s digging through other bags now, and Bucky’s frankly boggled that Tony went shopping himself and didn’t send one of his Stark Industries minions.  “We’re gonna smell like a vanilla cupcake, or a ‘moonlight breeze’ or whatever that means. Ah-ha, here it is – ‘Lavender and Chamomile’ – and hey, it’s
,” Tony scoffs.  He belatedly realizes how that must have sounded and he quickly shuts up, fearing that what he might say next would be even more embarrassing.  Cap doesn’t need to know right now the beneath the outer, ever-thinning layer of resentment and antagonism and the second layer of tentative friendliness, there’s still a bit of fanboy love at his core.
“I thought that this was a business dinner.” Even as Steve says it, he knows that’s an utter lie. The second he’d seen Tony walk into the lobby that evening, the pretense was rendered useless. He’s here because he’s attracted to this man. And Tony, Tony doesn’t really care about Steve being in his movie. It’s all lame excuses made in order to sit across from each other and vaguely flirt while looking their fill.
With his socks, shoes and suit coat gathered in his arms, Steve leaves Tony in the dressing room and makes the long walk down the narrow hallway toward the living room. He sits down on one of the armchairs and puts on his socks and shoes slowly, wondering if Tony is going to come back out and speak with him, maybe say good-bye, before he goes.
“I suppose it does.”  Natasha opens a panel on the wall that Tony hadn’t even noticed, and hits a button.  Part of the wall slides right, revealing a viewing window into Barnes’ cell.
Tony bites his bottom lip and runs a finger teasingly down the center of Steve’s bare chest, dipping slowly lower and lower. Steve’s too anxious now to find this anything but cloying.
“Nah, I’m bushed, I should hit the hay.”  He sets the folded newspaper down and runs a hand through his undoubtedly messy hair.  He’ll need a quick shower before sleep – he’s disgusting.  He feels like he’s been wearing the same black tee and pair of jeans for days.  Maybe he has.
“Never know until we try,” Steve says quietly, and Tony loves that Steve’s willing to consider it, though he really shouldn’t be surprised.  If Steve weren’t miraculously flexible and adaptable, game to try new things, his life would’ve gone completely sideways by now.
Tony needs time, and space, to work up to some things.  He doesn’t like labels; he doesn’t like boxes and Steve knows better than to force him.
“So…tonight?” Steve asks. “I can drive up right after we wrap for the day, maybe we can have a late dinner.”
And Steve’s never understood that either.  But now’s probably not the time to get into it, especially since he’s sure Bucky’s answer will be the same as always.  His friend’s stubbornness is second only to his own.
“Tell me how it was,” Tony murmurs. He’s not entirely sure what he wants to hear. He’ll take any bits of the truth Steve can bear to part with.
She knows that upon meeting Steve, he’d been ready and willing to hate the man; she doesn’t know that he’d secretly hoped Captain America would be everything Howard said he was and how disappointed and hurt he’d been when Steve Rogers turned out to be just another guy, and one who didn’t much care for Tony either.
“What was that then, a good-bye fuck or just a token reminder of how good you are, for comparison’s sake?” Steve asks, and lord, Tony had forgotten how Steve’s words could cut like knives when he wanted them to. It’s been awhile since they’ve had a fight but it seems Tony’s just started one.
The stifling heat doesn’t seem to bother Tony in the slightest as he lets himself in, bouncing up the steps and into the small dressing room. While he’d left no fans running, Steve had at least remembered to pull the shades, so the dim room is not nearly as sweltering as he imagined. It’s still warm enough to make his head feel foggy.
James starts getting sloppy, leaving breadcrumbs so obvious that they’re more like freshly baked loaves sitting on kitchen windowsills. He’s trying to lure Steve in.
“Natasha—“ Steve starts, making like he’s going to come help, but Natasha shakes her head sharply at him.
“About Steve Rogers' existence in relation to my existence? Yes, she’s aware. Does she know that Steve and I literally destroyed a bathroom in the Chateau this morning with our out-of-this-world fucking? No, she doesn't know about that.”
,” Jane gestures around them in a circle. “This is not a blind date.” Jane takes Darcy’s cigarette from her, stubbing it out in the glass ashtray on the center of the coffee table, next to the candy dish.
Fury shifts his stance, managing not to act the least bit surprised that Captain America is keeping it together.  He shouldn’t be; the man’s seen him muster through before.
Steve’s whole body is reacting to this sudden turn of events, his heart racing and his skin warm.  He’s achingly hard and he can’t bring himself to feel embarrassed.  Kissing Tony feels so right that he almost can’t believe they’ve never done this before.  The whole tangled mess between them just seems to fall loose, everything straightening out.
“What?” Steve exclaims. “Are you joking? You’re saying you broke it off for my own benefit? How gracious of you to decide what’s best for me without even asking me what I want.”
Steve snaps his head up so quickly that he nearly wrenches his neck, whipping to his left to find Tony leaning casually in the doorway. He’s dressed in a charcoal grey suit with a bright red tie, suit coat off and casually draped over his shoulder. His goatee is impeccably trimmed but his hair is slightly a mess; it’s the kind of calculated mix of artful imperfection that Tony is so damn good at.  Steve's stomach drops to his feet and his heart strangles his throat.
"So, you clearly have plans for our next outing, but where exactly are we going now?"  They stop on the block between Washington Place and West 4th and Tony looks around as if trying to decide where to go.  There’s a subway near here, Steve can smell it wafting up through the sidewalk grates, so he angles toward 6th Avenue.  "We should probably head back.  The game ended hours ago, at the very least Sam will send out a search party."
There’s a bit of a to-do when Olivia De Havilland and Montgomery Clift finally arrive to set, their stand-ins gratefully ducking out to go find some shade. He smiles when Thomas looks back at him for his reaction; he’s probably supposed to be impressed, just as he was probably supposed to be awed when he shook William Wyler’s hand, or when they crossed paths with Claude Rains earlier in the day on a different set.
Tony raised his voice enough to speak over Steve, “and two. Do you really think I would deny you the comfort of familiarity? I’m not that much of an asshole.”
The jangling sound behind Tony had him fortifying his position, bracing himself for the inevitable; the angry too much sex they both craved and needed right now.
While they waited they chatted, and flirted, and it was getting increasingly difficult for Tony to keep his hands to himself. Their relationship was public, but Tony was pretty sure if he shoved Steve down right there on the sidewalk and started dry humping him, that would be crossing at least one of their lines, and most of the unsuspecting bystanders’.
As he had with his hand, he started with a practice swat, and steadily built up the strength behind it. When he reached a certain amount of power Tony moaned, and tilted his head back. Encouraged, Steve used more force, and Tony’s hips bucked and he cried out. Despite having seen that reaction before for other reasons Steve froze, fearing that it wasn’t a pleasure reaction.
Sometimes Steve was wrong, and sometimes he just cared too much. And sometimes Tony couldn’t get passed his own ego and issues with authority.
The action forced Steve deep down Tony’s throat, and Steve held him there, until Tony was choking and desperate for air. Then he pulled him back, fucked his mouth a bit more, and did it all over again.
It had been two weeks since the thing had grown in completely, and Steve still hadn’t gotten rid of it. Despite Tony’s requests/demands, and the media having a field day claiming that Tony had poisoned Captain America so deeply that he was going into the porn business, he wouldn’t do it. Between his patent Captain stubbornness, and the pleasure he got from torturing Tony, the later doubted he’d ever shave it off. No matter what Tony said, whether it was pleas or rational reasons, it didn’t matter.
After spitting into the sink, Tony turned his head to look over his shoulder. “Make ‘em blueberry and we got a deal.”
“-you are still so selfish! This isn’t about-” Steve’s tirade was cut off when Tony launched himself at him, smashing their mouths together so fiercely Tony cut Steve’s bottom lip.
Implementing his stealth skills honed by his time as an Avenger he crept across the room, sticking to the shadows so as not to interrupt any light sources. Just in case. Steve was a freak.
“Today you made it, but what about next time? Or the time after that? You say I’m the boss, but you treat my commands like suggestions!”
With each passing minute Steve relaxed a bit more. The movie was halfway over by the time the hand in Tony’s finally went limp.
“Nope. Terms of Code Kissing the Choo Choo can’t be violated. If either of us deems the other as pushed to the limit and compromising themselves, we have the right to intervention. We shook on it.” Steve didn’t wait for Tony’s undoubtable repeated refusal. He slid an arm around the smaller man’s waist and moved to scoop him up. Tony knew what was coming and went dead weight in a last ditch attempt. Of course it was pointless, and Steve easily threw him over his shoulder like a sack of flour.
Steve lifted his head, pupils blown wide, lips pouty and debauched. Tony looked blissed out and wrecked, just the way he liked him, the way he wanted him. Goal achieved, he released his hips and smoothed his palms up his sides.
Biting/bruising/marking. Possessive Steve. Possessive Tony. Strong sexual content. Horn dogs. They are both little shits.
“Oh, so you know who is to blame for the slow floral takeover then? And you have not chosen to divulge this pertinent information to me?”
Steve’s eyes flashed and he walked forward, head tipped down so they were nose to nose. “Yes. You did. No one knew what you were doing. What if their reactions put them at risk too? What if Natasha had tried to offer you aid, and she got taken out? What then?”
Tony smiled at Steve. He liked that Steve was sticking up for others it was quite a noble quality. Tony tried to hide the newly forming blush on his face by looking at his phone. As he was checking his phone a reminder for an assignment that was due at midnight came onto the screen. An assignment which he had yet to start. This became the catalyst for the two pairs of roommates to stand and stretch, about to split paths.
“Next,” the attractive stranger called out trying to get Tony’s attention. This did not work and Tony remained where he was and stayed in his daydream. “Excuse me … sir?” the man tried calling out once more.
“Well, they are divine.” Tony complimented. Steve’s face grew pinker. “Can I uh … ask you something?” Tony’s voice wavered
Tony’s alarm violently woke him up. His eyes slowly opened to stop the horrendous beeping. It took him a minute to adjust to his new surroundings, Tony and his friend Bruce just moved into their dorm yesterday. Tony rolled over to see his roommate typing away on his laptop, the subtle glow was the only light in the room.
Tony smiled at the note. It was sweet of him to leave one. Tony decided that he should go visit Steve at work. It was the least he could do.
While Steve was cleaning the kitchen he found a notepad. There was a pen nearby, so Steve decided to leave Tony a note before leaving. Once he decided that his note was sufficient, he left it on the table so Tony would see it when he woke up. Steve grabbed his belongings, said goodnight to Tony, and then he left.
Tony took a sigh of relief. He reached over to grab his phone, and somehow he felt worse. Pain shot through Tony’s body. Looking at his phone, Tony did have a message from Steve.
“What’s your favorite thing on the menu?” Tony’s voice wavered but he was glad he came up with a response.
“Hey Friday, can you take uh-” Tony sneezed interrupting his train of thought. “Take uh-um Advil and Dayquil together.” Tony’s voice was hoarse, he was taken aback by just hearing it.
“As you wish Mister Stark.” Friday’s voice came down from the ceiling, startling Steve. He was so startled that he almost spilled soup on himself. Tony looked over and chuckled.
Steve didn’t buy it. He reached out and put a hand on Tony’s arm. It was pretty warm. Steve could only imagine how hot Tony’s forehead was. Steve saw that Tony’s cheeks were flushed, he quietly laughed not knowing if it was his doing or if it was Tony’s probable fever.
“Which-um-which-which floor are you?” Steve stuttered quietly, he was all of a sudden very insecure about his financial status.
“He definitely has a fever and waking up and going back to sleep.” Steve placed a hand on Tony’s back to try and calm him down.
Tony finally snapped out of his fantasy and walked towards the counter. “Hi … I’m uh … so sorry about that.” Tony was freaking out and his mind went completely blank. He didn’t think it was possible, but somehow the man behind the counter looked even better from the front.
Also, Fantastic Mr. Fox is one of my brother's favorite movies (If you haven't seen it you should check it out.)
“You woke up just in time! Are you ready for some of my world famous chicken noodle soup?” Steve flashed a cheesy grin and placed the bowl on the table closest to Tony.
After a few minutes, Steve was over at the counter with Tony’s tea in hand. “Thanks for everything.” Tony shot Steve a flirty look. “Oh, and by the way, your note was cute.” Tony winked before leaving.
Not wanting to look at himself anymore he pulled the mirror back revealing a collection of various medicines. Jackpot! He found what he was looking for, Tony grabbed the jar of Advil and the bottle of Dayquill and placed them on the sink.
Tony was annoyed. Of all the days that he would have woken up early on, it had to a Saturday. Tony tried to go back to sleep. He didn’t even know why he’d bother it was useless.
Peter sat up against the fridge. The cold metal feeling nice against his back. He slowly drank water hoping it would help, but it didn’t. Somehow the water made him feel worse. Peter felt a headache forming. Everything around him was starting to spin. He placed the water bottle down next to him and closed his eyes hoping the spinning would stop.
“Don’t want it,” Peter’s voice sounded small and sad. Steve was pretty sure that he could’ve started crying on the spot.
Leaving his bedroom, Tony wandered into the kitchen to make some coffee. He passed by a mirror in the hallway and say that his hair was sticking up in every which way. Tony didn’t care. “
“I don’t understand why I even need an art credit?! I’m a goddamn mechanical engineering major!” Tony huffed as he fiddled on his phone.
As much as Tony would like to stay here all day, he had work of his own to do; Stark Industries was not going to run itself. So, he quickly finished his cinnamon bun and got ready to leave.
Tony placed his phone down with a big smile on his face. He was beyond excited for Wednesday. This date was surely going to be better than the last.
Steve smiled at the boy as he decided now would be a good time to finally shower. With the amount of running, he did today, so much for taking it easy. He passed by a clock in the hallway and saw that it was now almost 8 o’clock. As he entered the bedroom, it was no surprise that Tony was still sleeping, he went to bed pretty late last night and it was the weekend so he could sleep in.
Steve went down the hall until he found the master bedroom. Tony’s bedroom. Steve felt himself blush. He looked over and saw the California King sized bed. Steve’s face grew even hotter, he started imagining Tony and him in the bed together. Cuddling, sleeping, and doing other things too.
Tony was about the furthest thing from a morning person anyone could imagine. So when the only mandatory art class left was at 10 in the morning he was less than pleased. Tony was also annoyed when it was a studio art class. He was awful at pretty much all things art. The minute he signed up for it he knew he would regret it.
“Stay,” Peter said so softly that Tony was sure if he had been any further from the couch he wouldn’t have heard it.
When Tony woke up the following morning, the sun was shining and Steve was gone. Tony felt much better this morning, which was a relief. He slowly sat up. Tony eyes darted to the piece of paper that he was pretty sure wasn’t there before, he picked up the paper and saw that it was a note from Steve. He had beautiful handwriting.
Tony gestured for him to sit. Steve handed Tony his coffee and the box. Tony opened it and found the most perfect looking cinnamon bun inside. Unconsciously, a smile crept onto Tony’s face.
The four boys became fast friends and stayed in the dining hall talking well after they were done eating. All of them were enjoying each others company. At one point in the conversation, it turned from getting to know one another, to spilling embarrassing stories about themselves. Bucky had no problem with this. He had known Steve since childhood and had plenty of stories to make the blond turn red with.
Tony was actually surprised at how much work he had gotten done today. Occasionally while he was working his thoughts would slip what Steve and Peter were doing but nothing more. Tony was also glad that he suppressed the urge to stop in at the coffee shop when he went out for lunch.
“Classes are finally over. I’m also here with my roommate, you guys should come and join us.” Tony smiled.
Tony just rolled his eyes at his friend as they walked into the lab building. Once the two of them got into their classroom, they sat a lab table. After a few minutes, the lab began. Since it was the first day, the lab was quite easy. Tony and Bruce finished the lab quite quickly so they were dismissed early.
“I’m Steve Rogers, and I was wondering if I could get your number just in case I miss anything in this class.” Steve seemed a little nervous, he stumbled over his words.
“Better now,” Tony said stifling a cough. Even when he was sick he still found a way to be charming.
Thank god Steve had decided to take a new running route this morning because he was able to make it to Peter’s apartment in about fifteen minutes. When arrived at the complex he breathed a sigh of relief that the very out of place looking car was waiting for him in the lot.
Tony went back home feeling quite good about himself. He checked his phone to see that it was only 11:21. He still had plenty of time to be productive.
Tony paid and as usual, he left a large tip. He walked over to the pick-up counter and leaned against the wall. Tony knew that if he sat down at one of the tables he’d be there all day.
“Probably something about wanting you to be a well-rounded student.” Bruce’s tone was condescending.
Steve was a little confused and that tone was very clear in his voice. But when he heard the soft cry of Peter’s voice asking him for help he stopped his run and started internally mapping out what would be the quickest way to get to Peter’s apartment is.
Ten minutes went by and Tony’s now least favorite sound disturbed his slumber for the second time this morning. He reluctantly sat up, trying to be more awake.
He grabs the stout green glass bottle of Agua Lavanda from Steve’s dresser top and unscrews the top. He gargles a swig of the cologne and then spits it into Steve’s trash, not having any other options. It’s hardly a toothbrush and mouthwash, but it’s something.
“I mean…whatever that means. If it means talking it out and braiding each other’s hair until you are back to being best buds and put those romantic feelings to bed…then, good. If it means that you both need to act on some…old desires made new, and bed him instead, then, uh, also good. We’ll deal with whatever shakes out when I get back.”
That doesn’t really clear anything up.  He gets a good look at her as they come to a stop beside one of the three helicopters; the hangar is empty of personnel but she keeps looking over her shoulder, expecting that to change at any moment.   She’s tall, with long dark hair, a soft jaw line, full lips and eyebrows; there’s a fierce elegance to her that overrides the panic in her blue eyes.
to tell any of you a goddamn word of this.  We could’ve just as easily kept Barnes under wraps.  I am giving Cap here the common courtesy of the truth.”
“Don’t know why you’re down here then,” Tony mutters and to Tony’s surprise, Steve rolls his eyes and sticks his foot out, kicking the edge of Tony’s rolling chair and sending him a few feet back.
“So what do you want me to do?  Show up and jog his memory?”  Steve snaps, looking up from some strange diagram of what appears to be an electronic arm of some kind.  “How long has he been here?  How long have you known?”
There’s a knock at the open doorway, and they both turn to find Natasha standing there, amused. She looks pointedly at Steve in his state of half-undress and then at Bucky, still holding Steve’s clothes in his hand.
“I do not mind them now,” Wanda replies lightly, expertly smiling and waving cordially at another studio executive as he passes by. She lowers her voice. “Although I must say that I am not much looking forward to sitting through our film again.”
“It’s yours, you can slap your name on it if you want,” Steve murmurs, halfway to sleep as his eyes drift closed.
“Yeah, I know, that was stretching it, even for me.”  He picks up his mug of coffee and offers her a bitter toast.  “Dance it is.”
Bruce actually looks startled, taken aback enough that his own anger fades in comparison to Tony’s.  He takes a deep breath, setting his lips into a firm line.
Steve is slowly dragged up from the depths of slumber by the feeling of someone’s fingers trailing delicately over the curve of his spine. The touch drifts down to the small of his back, up again to the sharp, jutting lines of his shoulder blades, and then retraces that path once more.
“When are you going to let me see the improvements you’ve made to your own little project?” Rhodey asks, pointing to the hangar across the way. Its doors are firmly locked and they’ve been that way for quite some time. Tony follows Rhodey’s gesture but just as quickly looks away. His lips pull into a tight line.
“It would’ve been nicer if you’d picked up your damn phone and didn’t leave me here hyperventilating for so long.”
Steve looks at her, leaving that list growing ever longer out of the corner of his eye, filing in line after line after line.  And Natasha, of all people, is looking back at him with her grey eyes shimmering with unshed tears, vulnerable with pity and concern.  It’s just wrong, all wrong.
Bucky pushes at a jagged slice of the broken mug with one of his flesh-and-blood fingers, the rough point digging into his skin and drawing blood.  Natasha takes it from him, wordlessly gathers up the other shards into another clean towel and then shakes them all into the trash.
He wants nothing more than to open his eyes and see Tony there.  It has to be Tony, because even though he has no idea where he is, he feels safe.
“I came up shortly after you did, but you were sleeping,” Tony replies simply.  If he’d picked up on Steve’s nightmare, he’s kind enough not to bring it up.  “I had some work to catch up on.”
“JARVIS, cut the hipster indie nonsense, would you?” Tony calls out, and Steve’s music abruptly shuts off.  “Come eat, Picasso.”
“Creation and destruction.  That’s what Starks are good for.”  When he continues, he speaks quietly and intensely, getting so close that their bodies touch.  It makes Steve’s temperature rise.  Tony refuses to let Steve look away, following his gaze wherever it goes and getting in its way.
If someone had told him that night that right now he would be feeling so worried at the prospect of seeing Steve, he would've found it unfathomable.
“Caught me on a good day,” Bucky jokes, but he doesn’t smile.  “I’m not who I am all the time, Steve.  Might not be me tomorrow.  Might not be me ever again.”
“I have the rest of the week off,” Steve explains, counting the days in his head. Yes – it is in fact Wednesday, so there is still a ‘rest of the week’ to be had. “They’re shooting some scenes with Wanda and Grimm, and then we’re basically done. There will probably be some re-shoots, pick-ups, what have you. Or so I’ve been told. They didn’t do that with the Cap reels; once those were in the can, they were in the can.”
“What would you do, after he left?” Tony asks. The question takes this conversation somewhere else that Tony hadn’t intended, but he can’t deny that everything Steve is saying isn’t having an effect. On any ordinary day, merely listening to Steve’s deep voice turns him on—sometimes he seriously has Steve read aloud to him as foreplay, the evening usually ending with Tony prying the book from Steve’s hands and crawling into his lap to kiss him senseless. Hearing him recount these sexually charged yet ultimately frustrated, futile moments with Bucky has left Tony with a confused but excited feeling twisting frantically in his gut and his cock thickening between his thighs. “Were you hard, did you touch yourself?”
“It’s probably not much use to practice on something that doesn’t hit back.”  Tony clears his throat and speaks loudly over the whump-thump-thump of Steve’s fists hitting sand and leather and vinyl over and over again.
“It’s just that I’m really not that hungry, and Tony’s going to come back here any minute and drag me off for that bath of his.” Steve is attempting to sound disgruntled, but it doesn’t quite succeed. It still genuinely surprises him that Steve’s protests with Tony are more token than anything; that he might not even
Tony locks the door behind him and sinks to the tile, burying his head in his hands. Pepper knocks and begs and pleads, but he ignores her concern like the ungrateful cad that he is.
A strikingly elegant redhead in an emerald green dress is approaching the club just as Steve exits, but it’s the rakishly handsome man on her arm that makes Steve’s steps stutter. Thinking quickly, he tilts the brim of his hat low across his brow and ducks his head, looking away as he courteously holds the door open for the young lady.
“Let's just say his best friend found out and he wasn't as open-minded as you, and leave it at that, shall we?” Tony lets his hands rest on the keys, the sound faint and discordant.
The alcove is decorated in a circus theme, outlines of trapeze artists, jugglers, and strong men dancing along the walls with giraffes and birds. A few chairs made in the shape of abstract human figures line the curved wall opposite the chrome and glass display case of the candy stand.
It’s a beautiful sight, but Tony tears his gaze away to take in something else just as pretty. Steve’s dick is hard and warm in his hold, though it had already been standing at attention on its own, pressing urgently up toward Steve’s stomach. He’s impressively long and thick enough that Tony has a moment’s pause about his earlier declaration – but only a moment. Steve’s going to fill Tony up so deep and stretch him so wide, and god, does Tony want that. Steve’s balls are full and tight to his body and frustratingly as symmetrical as the rest of him; his hair is a much darker shade of blonde than what’s on his head, and it’s well-groomed, carefully shaved and trimmed in a manner that leaves Tony wondering if Steve came to meet him tonight hoping for this to happen. It thrills him to think so.
When Tony went to coffee shops he usually got the same thing: black coffee with five shots of espresso. Some might say five shots is overkill, but Tony has a lot of things to do and needs the energy.
When Steve left the tower he decided to take a different route than he usually does. Today he’d be taking the scenic path. About twenty minutes into his run, his phone started to ring. For some reason that Steve couldn’t figure out, the Bluetooth in his headphones wouldn’t tell him who was calling, a robotic voice started to read out a phone number. Steve picked up the call.
Tonight is Tony and Steve's date! But something goes wrong because of course, it does. Hopefully they can still make the best of it.
Steve’s face grew warm. “Well slow down, you don’t want to waterboard yourself.” Steve and Tony both laughed.
A few hours later Bruce came in to drop off the medicine for Peter. When he went to go put the bottle on the coffee table he saw a sight that would make any heart melt; Steve, Tony, and Peter all snuggled into each other while the credits of The Lion King were on in the background.
I hope you liked the chapter! Just a little warning the next chapter might take a little time because I've got a pretty crazy work week coming up!
“Okay so there’s this beautiful man in my art class and I sat next to him and got his number!” Tony’s excited laughter got a chuckle out of Bruce. “I just don’t know how he was awake at such an ungodly hour.”
Tony decided to take it easy for the rest of the day. He had a light breakfast and kept a surplus of tissues at his disposal. Tony figured a nap would make him feel at least somewhat better. He flipped the channels to some sitcom and took a nap.
“Wait, before we leave let’s take a picture.” Steve called out. Steve pulled out his phone and snapped a photo. “To the first of many dinners together.” he smiled widely.
They entered the dining hall and each grabbed something to drink before finding a table to sit at. Then both boys went their separate ways to scour the buffet style layout of the dining hall looking for something to eat. Tony decided that pasta was a sufficient meal so he headed back to the table. On his way back a voice caught his attention.
“Mister Parker’s fever has gone down to 101.1. It would appear that Mister Parker has the flu.” Jarvis said and both Tony and Steve breathed a sigh of relief.
“I’ll be right back. Just relax.” Steve’s voice was soothing. Tony took Steve’s advice and closed his eyes and let himself sink into the comfy couch.
“Hey Peter, I know this might not taste the best, but it’ll make you feel better.” Steve poured the contents of the bottle into a small cup and handed it to Peter.
Tony walked over to the mirror and decided that he was too lazy to change out of the tank top he slept in and threw on a pair of shorts. He reluctantly packed his bag with the various supplies that the class required and slowly left his dorm room.
The boys filled their walk with basic small talk that you’d expect pretty much every college freshman to be asking each other with questions such as: “What’s your major?” and “Where are you from?” Although through this Tony learned that Steve was an art major and from Brooklyn. While Tony wished to continue the conversation, unfortunately, Steve’s next class was held in the same building.
While Mrs. Greene was going over the syllabus Tony kept sneaking glances over at the blond. He was literal perfection. It was if his face was perfectly sculpted, with every detail carefully placed to create the world’s most attractive man. His hair was perfectly tousled and the light from the window made his hair look like literal gold.
His journal entry wasn’t anything too fantastical, it was just a recap of the day. Alongside his messy handwriting, there were some little doodles just to fill the page. But most importantly, he taped one of the copies of the dinner photo into the book. The other printed copy would be for the wall next to his desk.
“Here you go and keep the change, as a thank you for dealing with me.” Tony handed Steve a twenty dollar bill and went to sit at an open table.
Steve quietly went into the bathroom and turned on the water. While he was waiting for it to warm up, Steve grabbed a towel and began to strip. The hot water felt nice against his skin. He’s had a pretty crazy morning, but he’s glad Peter is in the tower where he and Tony can look after him.
Tony turned to see that Steve and a dark-haired boy were walking towards him. “Hey, Steve! What’s up?” he smiled.
“Feel sick … please help … home alone.” As Peter was on the phone with Steve he started to crawl through the living room so he could unlock the door for him. “Please … hurry.” Peter managed to unlock the door before he eventually decided that the living room floor would be a good place to take a nap until hopefully, Steve came.
Once he entered the kitchen Tony grabbed a mug from the cabinet and placed it next to the coffee maker. Next, he searched through the remaining cabinets looking for anything to make coffee. Tony was more annoyed then he probably should be. “Jarvis,” Tony called out to the A.I. in the ceiling.
Peter was not able to get sleep. He lazily reached for his phone to check the time. Peter flinched at how bright the screen was. It was currently 5:23 am.
Suddenly they heard a retching sound. It could only be Peter. Steve and Tony both stood up. The two men entered the bathroom where the found Peter laying on the ground shirtless next to the ground. “Oh hey, Tony … when did you get here,” Peter said faintly, trying to sit up but he ended up falling back on the floor.
The sun shone brightly as the light crept in through the large windows in Tony’s bedroom. Tony groaned as he rolled over to see what time it is.
After the movie ended Tony mentally prepared himself for his back to back class and lab. Luckily for him, they were both with Bruce. He quickly brewed another pot of coffee knowing that he would need it. While the coffee was brewing Tony got his bag ready for the rest of his day and made sure the left in the notebook that he would become his journal. The coffee machine beeped and the caffeine addicted student refilled his thermos for the second time of the day.
“I know what you’re cleared to work on and what projects you have checked out.  There’re no flesh-eating viruses or crazy genetic mutation experiments lurking about.”
Steve breaks his pace with a quick-footed grace, stilling the bag immediately and turning to face him.  Tony’s never seen a smile so fake, and that counts the millions of his own he’s thrown out there, the ones that have been plastered on magazine covers and have placated talk show hosts.
and it can’t be sunshine and roses forever – but right now the only issue is remembering that Steve’s far more reserved than it ever occurred to Tony to be.  They may practically live in each other’s spaces and trade in small touches all day long, but Steve would blush bright red if Tony suddenly leaned in like he wants to and licked a hot trail up the length of Steve’s neck and along that sharp jawline.
He doesn’t know how much time he lets pass before he speaks but she waits patiently, knowing that he’s eventually going to have something to say.
“Barnes, where the hell you wandering in from?” Clint asks, smashing the silence.  Bucky steps all the way inside, shaking a few dead leaves from the bottom of his boots before walking further.  He’s carrying a large paper bag that seems heavy and is near overflowing.
“We’ve got movement two floors up,” She states, eyes trained on the ceiling like she can literally see the enemy through two stories of reinforced concrete.  She slides a fresh clip into one of her guns; Tony doesn’t know where that came from.  “Hill and Fury were moving Barnes, but that’s no guarantee they got out.  We should go.”
a time when they couldn’t stand each other?” Bruce inquires, leaning back in his chair to allow the waitress to reach over him and fill his coffee.  Tony gives Bruce his attention, curious, because he can certainly remember a time when he and Steve were at each other’s throats constantly, kept from writing each other off only by a shared group of friends that necessitated moving in the same circle.
Falsworth is his second in command on the crew, and Steve often relies on him as the go-between for set design and art direction. He’d do it himself, but with his own artist’s eye, he frequently finds himself perturbed by the horrible aesthetic choices being made and unable to hold his tongue about it.
“You sure seem fine.” Pepper’s tone is bone dry. She picks up Tony’s discarded phone and holds it out to him. “Call him back and call it off.”
He wakes the next morning and finds himself safely tucked into bed and the empty bottles of Jack carefully placed in the trash.  He takes the aspirin and drinks the water left out on his night table, and mentally lists all the people in his life who he’s managed
“Heeeeyy, Brucie…” Tony waves a hand in front of Bruce’s face but nothing disturbs his vacant gaze.  He can’t manage to hold Bruce’s attention, the other man seemingly willing to drift off into his own thoughts or a brief nap at a moment’s notice.  Tony snaps his fingers a few times, as noisily as he can.  “Hello, anyone home in there?”
Bucky leans down and kisses Steve once, softly. Then he pulls back slowly, eyes carefully locked on Steve’s face, and positions himself at Steve’s entrance. Steve stares up at him, their exchange wordless but clear, as Bucky finally guides his cock in with a slow, steady push.
“I think…this way?” Tony mumbles, pointing in any old direction.  Steve follows him, but surely he must have caught on by now that Tony’s slipping.  It has to show, because he’s sweating and his breath is coming in short pants.  Extremis is monitoring his heart rate, his body temperature, and he curses the thing for not being able to make this all stop.  But it’s mental, not physical.
Tony walks in first, pulling Steve along gently behind him. The doors slide closed behind them and Tony clicks the gate into place. As he presses his finger to the button for his floor, Steve puts a hand tentatively on his hip.
“Cap, if New York is the city that never sleeps, Vegas is the city that dropped acid and hasn’t realized it’s been awake and staggering the streets for three days.”  He takes his own tie completely off, but then walks to Steve and reaches to tighten his tie.  He smoothes the fabric down the center of Steve’s chest, hand running down and back up.  Steve’s breath catches a little.  “Every place is open, and there’s any kind of food you could want.  So name it, we’ll find it.”
Bucky traces idle patterns through the mess on Steve’s chest, purposefully not looking up in order to give Steve and Tony a moment to themselves. Steve meets Tony’s questioning gaze head on.
Behind him, the door to the balcony opens and slides closed with a mechanical whir. Bucky doesn’t have to turn to look to know that it’s Tony. It's his place after all.
“Please don’t take offense. Sometimes I think uncomfortable is my natural state.” Steve feels his face heat, only proving his point. “I’ve never been all that great with people.”
Steve looks at him over the top of the menu, with its exuberant illustration of seagulls flying and waves crashing against rocks splashed across its front. He stares at Tony for a long, weighted moment, the joy of their brief touch slowly ebbing away.
Steve sinks his hands into his hair, grip just this side of painful, but Tony loves it.  He loves the way Steve tastes, the way Steve feels, the way he sounds.
Steve glances down and is surprised to see that Tony’s not lying, his cock beginning to thicken. His own arousal stirs and he quickly averts his eyes from Tony’s body.
Steve’s blue eyes are blown black with arousal and his usually pale lips are plush pink and kiss-swollen.  His cheeks are rosy and there’s a delicate sheen of sweat beading over his broad chest.  If Tony breathes deep he swears he can smell the heady scent of sex, and his fingers twitch as they hover over Steve’s zipper.
.” Steve insists, trying not to be bothered by Tony’s harsh judgment. “Face it, Tony – Paramount’s renting you the space, the equipment…and they’re giving you the shittiest, oldest stuff they have, just because they know you don’t have a choice here. Lang’s doing the best he can with what he has to work with.”
“No…” Steve holds back a laugh, biting his bottom lip, and Tony feels a little victorious at almost earning a smile from the man, who is clearly in a terrible mood.  “But I did finish the New York Times Sunday crossword.”  Steve pauses, looking at Tony sideways.  “Those are still known for their difficulty, right?  They were a relatively new thing when I left the city.”
“Jesus Christ,” Tony mutters to himself, yanking down his zipper hurriedly and pulling himself out with shaking hands.  He’s going to come right here, from nothing but watching them fuck.
“Fancy running into you here.”  The small furrow between Tony’s eyebrows is the only sign he’s as caught off guard by Steve’s presence as Steve is by his.
From the moment Fury told him that some Russian oil tanker had discovered Captain America deep in the Artic, frozen but against all odds alive, Tony should have counted on this happening.
to know that by now.  Tony had spent long enough learning how to say it, to keep saying it, despite being programmed from birth to keep his cards close to his chest.
He has his arms crossed over Steve’s chest and Steve lifts one of his hands to rest on Tony’s right wrist. His long fingers are colder than the rest of him, poor circulation taking its toll.
He eyes the Pig‘N Whistle Café next door, wishing he could escape all this, grab a burger, and go home.
.  He supposes the man’s so used to being misunderstood that it’s going to be a long time before he stops with the constant pushback, the insistence on acting the outcast even in a room full of outcasts.
“Captain America, in the flesh.” Tony forces a smile through the disappointing revelation that the man who has held sway over his mind all day long is in fact the one man he’d wished to avoid. “No one seems to know what happened to you, after. You’re still an actor?”
“It was fine,” Steve mumbles, looking down. “I made Italian. We listened to some music, played cards, drank some wine.”
Steve moans as Tony gently kisses and licks around his sensitive hole, his back arching off the bed, pressing himself closer to Tony’s mouth. The pressure of Tony’s lips and the rough prickle of his goatee hurts, but it’s a good kind of hurt -- a pleasurable pain. He gets his hands in Tony’s hair and holds his head as Tony fucks him open with his tongue.
“I…” Steve starts, looking unsure, and Tony knows there’s an apology coming at him sooner rather than later.
He doesn’t hide his fascination as Bucky’s thrusts slow to a stop and his dick, still hard and wet with slick and come, slips out.
“I want to talk to him,” Barnes directs this request to Fury, gesturing toward Tony with both hands, zip-tied at the wrists.  Hill keeps a firm grip at his elbow.
Tony slowly cards through Steve’s myriad sketches of random street corners, storefronts, restaurants, parks, subway stations…all the little things that are different from seventy years ago.  The koi pond at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, the piers of the Southstreet Seaport, Gramercy Park beyond its closed gates…they’re all in there too, a little familiar and a little foreign. Tony pauses at a drawing of Grace Church, down on Tenth and Broadway.  He shoots Steve a puzzled look.
“That’s more like it, darling.” Jan's hand playfully curves over his hip, her manicured fingernails raking just a little too low to be wholly innocent. She circles around him and tugs lightly at the fabric covering his backside. “It's such a pleasure to dress a man with a real nice behind.”
Steve’s own reflection in the glass looks no better.  He hasn’t slept, he has barely eaten; he can’t really bring himself to care.
“Tony thinks it’s funny.” His dry, chapped lips crack as he forces a weak smile. “Actually works real good as a neck pillow, keeps me propped up.”
Not having to curse himself for loving the feel of Steve’s taut abs under his touch frees up a lot of time to consider other things.
“Then we answer those too. Not asking doesn't make the questions go away, babe. We'll figure it out.” He pulls Steve into a hug, feeling relieved when Steve lets him fold him in his arms and hold him tight. “Promise me you’ll talk to him while I’m gone.”
“Oo, don’t forget the processed cheese!”  Darcy races out of the room and returns victorious with a green and white canister of what Steve thinks is
“Yeah, yeah, I know. He says jump, you say how high. I’m goin’ inside.” He yanks open the door harshly and lets it slap closed behind him. Tony frowns, eyes tracking Bucky as he goes.
Steve is standing in the roundabout drive, hands in his pockets. The security lights have flickered on, casting a broad circle around him, but he’s turned away toward the shadows.
“We’re not leaving the city.”  Steve answers her unspoken question.  “We’re just looking for a new apartment, is all.”
in the future.  Apparently it'd really punch up the scene where Hamlet confronts his father's ghost."
Tony automatically turns his whole body toward the open warehouse door, his responsibility to the guided tour utterly forgotten as he watches the man’s muscular frame shift and stretch underneath his sinfully tight white undershirt. He turns and bends to lift up a long, heavy backdrop roll – singlehandedly – and the curve of his ass beneath his dark denims is spectacular. A tool belt is slung loosely around his slim waist, and doesn’t that do something to Tony, he doesn’t even know what.
From behind them comes a loud clatter. Lensherr has thrown the slate down on the ground, two broken pieces skittering across the hard cement. The black-and-white top of the clapper skids to a stop a step away from Steve’s left foot.
Whenever he gets annoyed, Steve focuses on them – on their lives, their wives, their growing families – and suddenly quibbling over a shade of blue on a wall on a movie set doesn’t seem worth the anger.
Steve ducks barely out of sight behind one of Tony’s sports cars and strips off his wet clothes efficiently and without much care for modesty.  He emerges moments later clad in a black hoodie and sweatpants, shoving on the sneakers as he makes his way toward the garage’s exit.
quite out of his realm of expertise.  He turns his attention toward the beautiful dinner laid out before them.   “Tasha, this all looks wonderful.  Thank you so much for everything.”
“You’ve heard about the stage shows, then.”  Steve mumbles, disappointed, and Tony shifts in his seat, feeling like he just kicked the family dog.
“Hey, Buck,” Steve says, and even the simple greeting sounds different when the feeling behind it is entirely honest. Along with all the thoughts of Bucky that come rushing back to the fore, also comes an enormous swell of gratitude and love for Tony for encouraging him to finally face this head-on.
would be a helluva distraction but might be too much for Steve to handle at the moment.  A walk on the High Line would be too peaceful, a beer garden in Astoria too pointless, and anything in Brooklyn, anything at all, is obviously right out.
The car disappears from his view as it rounds the final bend up toward the house. Tony considers going down to greet Steve and Happy both, but that seems too overeager, too forced. He wouldn’t do that for anyone else.
Tony kisses him once more, leading him backward into the tunnel with the promise of his talented mouth. Steve lets the kiss break. He needs a moment without Tony’s touch in order to properly think this through.
One look at Bruce though, and Tony can see the man’s willing to do the same for this Betty, whoever she is.
“Pepper…” Tony starts to argue, but he doesn’t know what to say.  Pepper stares at him, waiting, and all Tony can do is sigh.  “Call me when you land and let me know that you’re all right.  Please.”
Tony and Jane exchange airy, fake kisses to both cheeks and then Tony deposits himself on the loveseat that lines the far side of Jan's fitting room. He spreads out lazily as if he has every right to the space.
“Didn’t ask for a shoulder to cry on,” Steve points out. “I believe all I asked for was a gin and tonic.”
“When did you get home?” Steve asks, covering Tony’s arm with his own and twining their fingers together. Their bedroom is dark, but he’d fallen asleep much earlier than usual. It messed with his sense of time. “I wanted to meet you –” He yawns, unable to stop himself. “I meant to be up.”
“I really think I should come along.”  Bucky is following after her, evidently continuing a conversation that had begun behind closed doors.
“This part is half the fun,” Steve replies, pausing in the cut he’s making.  If Tony stopped complaining long enough to work, he’d be long done with the cleaning and onto the carving already.
Leaving his mess of bags scattered across the living room, Tony grabs a couple bottles of something or other and then bends to kiss Steve on the forehead.
“Well, I don’t think this will be as tasty as hers, ‘cause I ain’t no kinda cook, but it should do the trick. We’ll have you feeling top notch again in no time, pal.”
Tony’s relieved to say he pays Happy more than well enough, so he was able to buy Pepper a ring worthy of her without taking too deep a ding in his savings. He would’ve gladly given the man a loan had that not been the case, but that most likely would have been one of the most awkward conversations imaginable.
“And I’d say you’re the kind who’d want to find out which.” She slinks toward him, a knowing smile curling at the edges of her full lips.
At least that was where Pepper said he was on Monday when Steve finally caved and called Tony’s office, under the pretense he had some question about withholdings in his paycheck. He’d paid for his lie when Pepper transferred him to Phil Coulson and he spent the next fifteen minutes discussing tax law with one of Captain America’s biggest fans.
Tony stares at Steve, that first moment of shock settling into something much harder and unforgiving.
“This is all for me?”  Steve sounds more bewildered than honored or grateful.  Bucky stops beside Tony, shoving his hands into his pockets and rocking back on his heels.  He lets out a low, impressed whistle.
“Stay like that,” Bucky mumbles into Tony’s ear, and starts rolling his own hips. He’s not going to fuck Tony, Tony knows he would’ve asked permission and carefully opened him up for that. But his cock rubs and catches against Tony’s entrance as Bucky thrusts forward and up. His movements are small and they rock Tony into Steve, gentle but insistent.
“He’s not supposed to have those birds.” Sam cares nothing for Tony’s rule, and Tony keeps threatening to let Fiorello loose in their cage.
Tony throws off his touch and storms out, slamming the door behind him so hard that the glass wall vibrates.  Glances are exchanged across the table until Bruce takes his glasses off and carefully puts them in the front pocket of his tweed blazer.
“And they used you to try and reverse engineer the serum,” Tony interjects again, apparently unable to stop.  “They also used you as a guinea pig, testing and injecting you with god knows what, trying to figure out what you could withstand, what you could fight off.  Torture in the goddamned name of science.  They kidnapped Dr. Ross to help them do it, and she did
“Know what?”  Tony hedges, taking a step toward him.  Steve can’t tell if the innocent look on his face is real or faked.  It’s probably a put on.
It takes far too long for it all to make sense again. By the time it does, Tony is bent down in front of him, hands outstretched but carefully not touching him.
In the first frame, Bucky is giving Steve bunny ears because they’re apparently giant dorks, and Clint is doing his best Blue Steel.  A simple round magnet mostly obscures the second frame.  The third shows Steve hearing, Bucky seeing, and Natasha speaking no evil, while Clint, his fingers out in devil horns and his tongue wagging in a way that would make Gene Simmons jealous, apparently
He has no idea what time it is when an unfamiliar woman approaches their table and frowns down at Tony, but the restaurant is almost entirely empty of both customers and wait staff.
“Sure, that’s fine.” Bucky rolls over the top of the bag; the paper crumples satisfyingly in his fist. He forces a smile for Steve’s benefit and repeats the lie to himself, as if saying it one more time will make it stick.
Tony studied Steve for awhile. He hadn’t known him long, and even he could tell his delivery was off. There was something more to this impromptu road trip than he was letting on.
Naturally, Steve woke up around 5:40 am. His eyes slowly opened to embrace the subtle light coming in through a crack in the curtains. It seemed like a nice morning for a light run. It was the weekend, after all, he could go easy on himself. Looking over to the right he saw Tony peacefully sleeping. Steve gave him a light kiss on the forehead. As quietly as he could, he got ready for his run.
,” Tony thought as his eyes quickly scanned the menu hanging overhead. There were way too many options and he didn’t even know what half of the items were. His mind was slowly starting to go back into panic mode as he seemed to forget how to be a normal human being.
“Keep going straight and then make a left, it’s the big white and grey building kinda hard to miss.” Tony’s voice was choppy and a bit hard to hear.
“I’ll be there soon,” Steve’s said ending the call with reassurance. But Peter didn’t hear that part because he had already passed out at this point.
As soon as Peter got within an arm's reach of the couch he immediately flopped down on it. Tony chuckled and started walking towards the kitchen to make a pot of coffee.
“My research shows that there are no side effects of taking the two together.” Friday’s voice cheerily responded.
“Oh yeah, that’s Peter.” Steve’s voice became quiet before continuing “He and his aunt live in the same apartment building as I do and his home life isn’t really the best. He’s such a great kid and this is the least I can do.” Throughout speaking Steve’s voice was a bit shaky, he clearly cares for Peter, and Tony thinks that’s sweet.
Steve carried out the tray into the living room and set it down on the coffee table. “Peter, I know you just want to sleep but you should probably drink some water,” Steve said softly while opening a bottle and handing it to Peter.
“Bruce! This is Steve, from my art class and his roommate Bucky.” Tony tried to emphasize how he knew Steve without making it sound too obvious, just in case Bruce said something potentially embarrassing.
“Dude it was literally ten o’clock.” Bruce said cackling. “It’s a completely normal time to be awake.”
By luck would have it, Tony’s dark eyes met the stranger’s brilliant blue ones. They both quickly looked away and he hoped that he wasn’t blushing. After that Tony kept the staring to a minimum and did his best to focus on what the professor was saying.
“I’ve been babysitting this kid since day one.” Bucky lightly punched Steve’s shoulder. “He’s been getting himself into fights that he couldn’t win well before he beefed up.” Bucky stuck his tongue out and Steve just rolled his eyes.
Tony turned on the TV so he could at least try to focus on something. He settled on some cheesy 80’s movie and zoned out.
“Exotic dancers.”  He takes the bag from the counter with a muttered thanks and heads outside.  Despite the late hour, it’s still too warm; he pushes up his sleeves again, trying to balance his bags and the phone as he does.
“You’ve been worrying something in your hand all night long, you keep taking it in and out of your pocket. It's clearly not a lighter," she jokes lightly. "So, what is it, a good luck charm?” She’s dialed back the flirtation a bit, but not by much. At least this seems more of a question borne of actual curiosity than the set up for another coy tease. A question about his hand in his pocket could easily have gone somewhere a lot less innocent.
He wipes sweat from his brow with the corner of his white tank and then finishes pushing one into place.
He never would’ve guessed he’d come to personally know not one but two generations of Starks, much less receive direct orders to bunk under their roof.
“I tried to find Dr. Ross earlier.”  Steve is choosing his words more carefully now.  “I went to the main lab, but everything was dark.”
.” Rhodey says pointedly, glaring at Tony in emphasis. Tony ticks his gaze from Jim to Carol, who has suspiciously found a place on the ceiling very interesting to stare at. It's entirely unlike her to avoid looking him in the eyes.
Tony comes back to himself with a shaky gasp, startled by the force of the simple daydream. His lips are tingling as if the kiss were real. His heart beats wildly in his chest; sweat breaks over his skin. His cock is blindingly hard, bulging insistently in his trousers, but that seems desperately beside the point. He reaches back behind him, finding the edge of his desk in order to steady himself.
“Where were you tonight?” Steve asks. “I was going to call but then I realized…I don’t have any number to reach you. Only have your damn office number.” His laugh has a bitter tinge to it that Tony doesn’t like. It stings like a thousand tiny pin pricks. “Hell, I don’t even know where you live, now that you’re not at the Marmont.”
“I know. And you’re good at it, or I wouldn’t have hired you. But you could do more. We could do more. Together.” Tony drums his hands on the edge of the table and then points at him. “Much more.”
Home, it is then. Bucky and Natasha will appreciate a hot meal, he’ll cook for them instead. The thought of a typical night at home is a let down when he’d been expecting to be with Tony, but dinner with friends…that’ll be fine.
“Bucky always said it wasn't going to play.” Steve murmurs as he pulls on his other shoe. He had agreed with Bucky then, even if he'd kept his trap shut about it at the time. It wasn't his place to comment on dialogue. “He and Natasha could take a pass at re-writing it, maybe, if you want them to? Bucky had ideas.”
“Nothing’s ruined, Steve.”  He states and pops the door open.  He ducks inside and Steve hesitates before following him, once again unsure of where he and Tony stand with each other.
“Movie critic,” Tony frowns.  “I feel like we might be falling down a rabbit hole here, maybe we better leave
“Everyone get down.” Tony announces, red circles lining up and locking in his field of vision, targets acquired.  His missiles don’t miss and the field is cleared for a moment, allowing everyone to catch a much-needed breath before the next wave reaches their choke point.  The explosion is beautiful.
“Look.  I know ten feet outside that door it’s a different world.  That’s pretty hard to ignore.  Not kidding myself, Stark.  But here…it’s one place at least that doesn’t feel
“Nothing, punk.” His anger sapped, he reclaims his seat alongside Steve, and glances toward the coffee table where the matzo soup sits untouched. “Guess your soup’s pretty lukewarm by now, after all that. Want me to heat it back up? It’ll just take a minute.”
“I…thought you were one of them.”  Steve says, even though he’s not entirely sure what he’d thought, if he’d thought anything.  She doesn’t seem to understand him anyway.  She pushes through the doorway as soon as it opens and the scene before him seems eerily familiar.
“1.” He finishes belatedly, both pleased and exasperated by Tony jumping the gun. Tony shrugs, unapologetic, and wraps his arms around Steve’s neck, pulling him back down.
“You’re planning to stay in the movie business, then.” Steve still hangs back in the doorway. “I thought what with your prolonged trip to New York, that maybe you were getting out.”
“C’mon.”  Tony breaks the moment by patting Steve’s cheek, pulling away.  “If I was cold before, I’m fucking freezing now.”  He stands up and waits for Steve to follow him.  “That pond’s dangerous, I should fill it in with concrete and dance on its grave.”
He’d touched and he’d kissed them, but he hadn’t asked about the scars that cover Tony’s chest, the ones that make his skin look like glass someone hit dead center, sending cracks spidering out in every direction. He doesn’t need the full story to guess that Tony has experienced some awful things in his own life.
“Steve Rogers, I think sometimes you were put on ice just so you could wake up now and become my new best friend.”
“More importantly, why ya here now?” Bucky follows up, words snapping from his lips and his Brooklyn accent creeping through.
“I’ll just go put this in the fridge.”  Pepper’s tone is bone dry.  She doesn’t seem to be her usual collected self, her face drawn and her posture prim.   If the two of them have in fact reconciled, things don’t appear to be going all that well.  It bothers him a little that he’s a bit glad.  His unkind thought gives him a moment’s pause.  Whatever has happened, he doesn’t want Pepper
As Thor continues to praise his breakfast meat, Natasha spears a piece of cantaloupe on her plate and wordlessly drops it onto Clint’s beside his cottage cheese.  She hates the orange melon while he loves it.  He gives her his watermelon in trade; it’s a system they have worked out.
Tony doesn’t oblige.  He stands there quietly, his mind clearly working a mile a minute behind his dark eyes.
Bucky bites down at the juncture of Tony’s throat and shoulder, than laves the mark with his tongue.
It feels like someone took his heart in their hands and twisted.  Bucky.  Alive.  Tears sting his eyes.  He quickly blinks them away and tries to focus through the tightening in his chest.
-- but maybe…maybe I thought you’d change your mind? That you’d be angry I actually did it.” Steve knows that sounds terrible. If he thought those things, he shouldn’t have gone through with it. But the truth is the fear didn’t strike until after it was done and he was back in his and Tony’s apartment, alone.
