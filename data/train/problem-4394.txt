Dean just nodded and inhaled deeply, trying to calm himself, and it definitely helped when Cas gently pressed his lips to Dean's neck. Not so much a kiss but it was oh so comforting.
“three, he’s… he’s three. I…” Cas found he was only able to stutter broken sentences at the moment, “You got him a gift?”
"If you say so, Dean,“ and he walked in. There was another note on the tv right where the last note had said it would be, so he read that one, "I knew you would end up wandering around, bored with nothing to do. So I cued up a new Netflix series for you to watch, there’s also beer in the mini fridge, and snacks for you in the cupboard above it. When I get back, maybe we could have a movie night? Haven’t had one in a while. Dean.”
Everyone nodded at Dean, impressed, then Gabriel looked at Castiel and it did not miss Dean’s eyes when he very obviously mouthed, “Marry him!” causing Dean to blush a very deep shade of red.
It was just around a month after Dean had met Jack that they were having dinner at Cas’s house. Everyone was there and it was Dean's first time meeting Cas’s dad and youngest brother, Gadreel, and everyone was having a wonderful time. Cas was glad that his entire family liked Dean as much as he did.
“I bet,” she nodded, still looking around.
“Is everything alright?”
"Dean Winchester! Where the hell have you been?!" Though it wasn't exactly the warm welcome Dean had been hoping for, he was still happy to have this nonetheless. "I haven't heard from you in ages, and now you just randomly show up on my doorstep, unannounced, on a Sunday afternoon? And those…" She looked down to the two car seats, one in each of his hands and pointed to them, "Are… are those babies? You have babies?!"
The car ride home was just as silent as it was on the way there, just as weighted, and just as hollow. Dean reached his hand across the seat and laid it on Cas's knee who covered it with his own. Neither said a word, both knowing how the other felt, how Gunner had truly changed their lives for the better, how much he would be missed and always loved.
"I'll miss you too, and thank you again for taking Jack. I promise we'll be home as soon as we can.”
Cas walked over to his bag as Dean sat back against the mirror at the front to take off his shoes. He grabbed two bottles of water out of his bag and tossed one to Dean.
And Cas and the boys watched him leave the house, practically skipping down the driveway and to his car.
Sam let a chuckle escape him, “You guys are too much sometimes.”
When he got there Sam was in the kitchen, showered, dressed, and stirring a pot of spaghetti sauce he was making for dinner. And just as Dean had expected, there was a fresh pot of coffee made and a plate of bacon, eggs, and toast waiting for him on the counter.
A few seconds later Jack had made his way around the table while showing off his hair, and was now tugging on Dean’s pant leg. He looked down and smiled, “Yeah, buddy?”
His nerves came back a bit now that Cas was gone, he could still see him but not having his hands on him was unsettling him again, and even more so when he heard Chuck and Metatron on the other side of the curtain, addressing the audience before the show would start.
“You can if you want,” Natahsa said as she pushed the computer towards Sera, “it's not finished but you can read what I've got, and I can work on my math homework while you read.”
The boy nodded, “He's not answering, which also isn't like him.”
As soon as Dean spoke, Jack pulled himself further behind Cas and hid his face completely. Dean pulled back, worry etched across his face, “I’m sorry, I didn't mean to scare him!”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Agents,” the Father they were waiting for walked up to them, “how can I help you this fine day?”
Sam rolled his eyes and leaned back in the chair. He knew what was coming, he knew he was not going to get to finish this movie, he was going to explode and Dean was going to get his way. And that's exactly what happened when Dean suddenly let out a very loud moan, and Sam turned just in time to see Cas grab Dean by the thighs, and flip their positions so that he was now on top, settled between Dean's legs and sucking on Dean's neck. Dean's hands then wandered down Cas's back to his ass, he pulled him closer then wrapped his legs tightly around Cas's waist to pull him flush against himself, and Cas let out a quietly groaned, "Oh, Dean." But it was loud enough for Sam to hear, and that was the last straw.
“Exactly one year ago today, we both stood here and let Gunner go, into that forest,” Cas pointed, “why did you bring me here?”
“Seriously?!”
“Yeah,” he stepped forwards with a shrug, “there's more than enough room, we have all these resources here to help with our hunts, we'd all be together, and it's much better than never knowing where you're gunna be sleeping next. It's also protected and warded, safe.”
“Cas, I want you to like me, to give me the chance to show you that I am a good man, and that includes your son. He has to like me too in order for this all to work out.” Cas just stared at him, mouth gaped. “I told you I would take you as you are, that also means your son, and I love kids so it's all the better!”
He gently laid Cas down, peeled off a few of his outer layers, then after doing so himself he crawled in next to him. As soon as Dean was under the blanket Cas immediately curled into his chest and wrapped himself around Dean, and Dean held him there tightly.
Cas stood and turned fully towards Dean. He was on one knee, a small box held up in his left hand, “Cas,” he started, soft and slow while Cas made shuffling steps towards him, “I've loved you for a long time, so long, and thanks to this guy right here we were finally able to be together. We've been through so much, pulling my sorry ass out of hell, your fall, purgatory, and everytime we always end up coming back to one another. And this past year and a half with you, with you and I finally being together, has been the best time of my life, I am finally happy.”
"Dean," she held up a single hand to stop him, "you know I do not work for free, not even for the Barbarian King.”
Crowley then knelt down, same devilish smirk on his face as before, and looked into Chuck's car seat. "Well, now little ones, how about Uncle Crowley helps Daddy get back your other Daddy and Uncle Moose?"
~~~~~~~~~~~
"Yes, that's correct, Dean." Gunner let out another high pitched wine as he answered.
“And I know that dad always loves having you in the office to help out, and working from home for all but one day of the week isn’t good for you. You need to start getting out and actually having a life. You’re not the only one in the world in your current position and I-”
“But there's no way it could have been human, Dean,” Sam scratched his head, “no one was out of their room or able to get past the front desk to kill Jerry.”
Dean smiled with a shake of his head and leaned down, "Get out of there, Cas."
“I am,” he blushed, “but how was Jack while I was gone?”
Dean just rolled his eyes and backed away to let him in. "You could have just snapped your way in like you usually do."
"Yeah, or at least I thought I was. Turns out I was just in some sort of Chuck induced fever dream for four years."
"If you can get Cas back, and Sam, I'll help you get whatever you want."
“Yes.”
"And I see you have chosen to teach yourself the role of Clara."
Sera stared at him for a second before her eyes went wide, “I think I know why…”
"But you're gunna save him right?" She asked, then turned a wide smile on one of the babies as they cooed at her.
He stood there long enough to watch them seal their joining with a kiss, and when it was obvious that they weren't going to be separating anytime soon, he decided to slowly back out of the room and let them have their time together. Besides, while they were distracted with each other, he had some work to do.
"And you've got his bag?"
"That's probably why he does this every night," Dean said," he wants the warmth and the comfort of sleeping with his mom."
~~~~~~~~~~~
“Sure thing, honey.” Dean smiled at her as he handed her a twenty and told her to keep the change, and he was sure that she was the same lady who had worked the counter even when he was young.
(See the end of the chapter for
"It's not me," he shook his head looking at his hands, "I'm being forced back. Dean I-"
“What?” A small surge of panic shot through Dean.
“We need to get out,” Sam said as the creature began advancing on them again, “now, Dean!”
“I… I can’t dance in front of people, Cas! Are you insane?!” He shook his head, breathless with nerves. “I’m a closeted dancer, not even my own mother or brother know that I dance! And now you not only want me to dance in front of the people in my own town, but then also travel around with you and dance in front of people nationwide?!”
"I missed you,“ Cas admitted, "the pillows and blankets smell like you.”
“You want me to spike it?”
Dean grabbed all the notes and placed them on the bedside table, then opened the drawer to reach in and grab the pad of sticky notes and wrote out another one. He laughed as he peeled the note off the pad and moved his hand between them to stick it over Cas’s heart. Cas tucked his chin down to read the note upside down and smiled from ear to ear, “Property of Dean Winchester.”
Jack clenched his fists together and growled out, “Yes!” then ran off through the house.
“It does…” Jack seemed to be contemplating the idea.
“He's still in the same place he was when you last saw him.” Dean's eyes went wide and Chuck lifted his hands. “Not as you think, I didn't leave him to rot down there. I froze all time on Earth.”
“I mean, those are the main events I guess,” Sam replied as he rubbed the back of his neck.
“We should let Sam know that we are married now,” Cas added as they exited the church and made way for the car, “but after our mini honeymoon.”
"You… what?!"
Dean couldn't help but laugh against Cas's lips and said, "Me too, Cas, me too," and closed the gap between them. Dean was pleased that everything had turned out better than he had ever thought it would, and that the ballet had been a winning performance, but of all of that the only thing that he really cared about was that the man in his arms, currently kissing him absolutely senseless, was finally all his. His very own Nutcracker Prince.
"So they told me."
He moved around Dean and lead her to the other booths as Sam and Dean followed, much to Dean’s disapproval.
~~~~~~~~~~~
“He may be small, Sam, but he is as fierce a warrior as any other viking I know,” he slapped his hand down on Sam's shoulder again, stepping closer and staring intently in his eyes, “worry not about Gabriel’s safety and more so about getting him into your bed.”
As they slowly drifted through the night he let his thoughts wander back to his vision, to the mark on his arm, to the man the handprint belongs to, the man with the piercing blue eyes. His hand slowly wandered to rest over the mark, he could not wait to find this man, to see what splendors the Gods had in store for him not too much farther away.
He turned to the familiar voice with  a smile, shaking off his thoughts, and walking to meet her. “Ellen, are you ready to take my place while I'm gone?”
“Yeah, let’s start there,” Dean nodded and they made their way towards the elevators.
“Take your time and do what you gotta do,” Dean then turned to the rest of the group, “I’m just sad you guys are missing the annual Winchester family reunion barbeque.”
"Shall we get this final rehearsal on the road then?!" Metarton waved his hands in the air and everyone started running around them. "Places people, places!"
"You dumb son of a bitch! Let me go and leave Sam out of this!"
The woman placed a finger over her mouth stopping Sam, then looked over to the girl, “I’m sorry, I don't want her to know.” Sam nodded as the woman moved around the desk to talk quietly with them. “Vincent did tell me about three agents that had stopped in yesterday, but I'm not sure there's too much else I can tell you. It seems that everyone is stumped and no one has any new leads.”
“It could be, people are nuts,” Dean nodded beside her as Sam continued, “but I told Bobby we’d take a look anyways, we can head out tonight.”
“But that's just the thing Jody, I can't do that anymore,” he gestured to the two little ones in front of him, “I have these two now, kids, I can't go running around all reckless like I used to. I have to make sure I’m there for these two, I have to be a good dad.”
“What game?” She asked, all kinds of excited now.
Vincent nodded still looking at the floor when his phone went off in his pocket. He pulled it out and then looked up at the three of them, trying to keep his composure as best he could, clearing his throat. “Well, I must be off. That's Carter letting me know that the guys are here to set up for tomorrow's convention. If you agent’s are finished here I can walk with you.”
~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~
Four came around all too quickly for Castiel and at the sound of the doorbell ringing right on time, he got up with an exasperated sigh and slowly walked towards the door. Both of his brothers were there today, lined up and waiting for him.
The brother’s had left early that morning to take down a vamp nest in a nearby town. He knew they wouldn’t be back till late, and there was the possibility they wouldn’t even come home until tomorrow, so Cas had taken the opportunity to sleep in. But now he decided it was time to get up and not waste the entire day. So he forced his still exhausted body to get out of bed and venture out into the bunker.
“At least let him show you what he can do. Let us dance the finale together. Once you see his skills and our chemistry, I promise you will change your minds.”
“Because you could not bear to see so.”
“Thanks Dad,” Dean placed a hand on John’s shoulder, “it means a lot to me that you're taking this as well as you are.”
“Let me get this straight,” Chuck took a few steps forwards, taking a second to rub a hand down his face before asking, quite annoyed, “you want us to let some random man off the street, someone I've never even heard of before, not only join our highly respected and prestigious ballet, but also play the lead?!”
Dean just smiled, as happy as he had ever been in that moment, and wrapped his arms around Cas. They laid like that for a minute before Cas moved his hand from where it was rested on Dean’s chest, and a second later, he brought it back up and stuck the entire pile of sticky notes he had collected all day to Dean’s forehead. Dean chuckled, shaking Cas on his chest who also laughed. Then he brought his hand up again and placed the confession note over Dean’s heart where his hand had just been resting.
A few weeks had passed now and Sam was more than overjoyed with Dean and Cas’s progress with each other. More often than not he would see them sitting together on the couch, Dean's arm around Cas and Cas’s legs draped over Dean's lap, the baby sprawled happily over them. The biggest cuddle fest Sam had ever seen.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once he was settled, he stepped off to the side to wait for his food and pulled out his phone. A few people after him had ordered, but there was a certain voice that pulled him out of his thoughts, a gravelly, deep voice he had never heard before that sent a shiver through his whole body.
“You see, Dean, it wasn't you who died, it was Sam.”
“My youngest brother’s adopted.” Cas looked up and met Dean's eyes as he explained. “Also not under the best circumstances. My dad’s a cop, and when I was eight and my little brother Sam was four, my dad came home one night with Adam. He was one at the time, and his family had been involved in some kind of accident. I don't remember exactly what, but he had no other family to go to so my dad brought him home, said he could stay with us for a while. And of course we all ended up loving Adam and with my dad being chief of police it was easy for them to officially adopt him a few months later.”
The sound of a fork hitting a plate was heard over the sudden silence in the room, as well as the comical sounds of Gabriel faking a heart attack, and it was Chuck who spoke first, “This Dean must be a very special man,” he nodded, digging back into his food, “I can't wait to meet him.”
Castiel laughed, “I will make sure he knows. And what do you and your family do, Dean?”
And he did. They performed the entire dance together and Dean had never in his life felt so connected to anyone, so open and vulnerable yet so free to be completely and wholly himself. And before he knew it the night had passed. Hours had flown by in a flurry of roaming hands, hot mingled breaths, lips brushing skin, noses touching…
Dean had lived in lawrence, kansas his entire life. Born and raised. In his twenty-six years in the beautiful city, he lived a wonderful life surrounded by the amazing people who lived there, many of them becoming family over the years. After high school, he started working for his uncle Bobby at his mechanics shop and fell into a comfortable routine. He still lived at home with his parents, John and Mary Winchester, and for the foreseeable future, Dean had no intentions of changing that. Until he saw him.
"Oi! Someone open up will ya!"
When they finally pulled apart, Dean pulled Cas against his chest again, tucking him perfectly against his body as he was before, running his fingers up and down his back. Then he started thinking, as he was staring up at the ceiling, with Cas finally in his arms, and as usual his brain started running wild. He suddenly became nervous and began shifting under Cas.
“No, no,” Vincent shook his head, “everyone loved Jerry. Wouldn't hurt a fly that man.”
“We were, she was like family to us.” As he continued on with the story Cas found himself thoughtlessly stroking his fingers over Dean’s knuckles, it was comforting and grounding. “When Kelly went into labour she was at our house. We were in the backyard sitting by the pool when it happened and instantly I knew something was wrong. I know childbirth is a painful experience but it was different, she was in more pain then she should have been. So we rushed her to the hospital and the doctors allowed her to bring me into the delivery room. She wasn't in labour for long before she gave birth to Jack, and he was only in her arms for a few moments before alarms started going off and I could tell she was fighting unconsciousness.
Henderson Castle, Kalamazoo, Michigan
Dean pulled up to Cas’s house and parked the car, then he jumped out and ran to the passengers side to open his door for him and help him out.
“Anytime, Dean, now off to bed.”
Cas squinted at the bottom of the paper, Dean had written something but scribbled it out completely. Then it looked like Dean tried again, “I… Cas…” Then more scribbles, and more, until he was at the bottom of the page.
~~~~~~~~~~~
“More importantly,” Sam groaned as he rolled over to get up, “why did it leave without even attempting to finish us off.”
"And thank you," Cas said and Dean smiled at him knowing exactly what he meant, "if it weren't for you we wouldn't be where we are today, together. Now off you go, we love you."
“Yeah, it was. We’ll call and thank him later, but right now I just want to get you to that hotel room and get this honeymoon started!”
"That's our boy!" The two of them seperated and ran at Gunner who turned and ran through the living room. The three of them chased each other through the bunker, around Sam who was still watching from the map table with a huge smile, until Gunner hopped up on the couch and Cas and Dean were skidding across the floor towards each other. They slid, socked feet, right into each other's open arms and hugged as they cheered again for Gunner, "He's walking Dean, he's finally walking."
Then the sound of crying caught his attention and pulled him out of the dark hole in his mind, and had him instantly on guard. Still clutching tightly to Sam he turned to look behind him. No one was there, the barn was empty, but then it happened again. The crying, and then… he looked down towards the ground.
“Dean, I really don't want to be here.”
He shuffled closer to Sam, got up on his knees on the couch, and leaned across the back of the couch behind Sam. He grabbed Cas and pulled him closer so he could get at his neck, and Sam was now sandwiched between the two of them.
"I have done it."
And with those last words everyone around them ran off in different directions.
The sun was just about to go down, Cas could see the mixing pinks and oranges taking over the sky through the green canopy above. The air was becoming chilled and hitting the bared arms of his now fully human vessel, causing him to shiver slightly as Dean turned to him.
He got out of the car, breathing in the sweet Sioux Falls air he loved so much, and walked to the back doors to start getting the babies car seats out of the back as Jody drove up and parked beside him. He got both seats out of the impala and placed them on the ground, watching as Jody pulled the new double stroller they just bought out of the back of her van, and pushed it over to Dean.
If there’s anyone out there who has been dealt the most inconceivably shit hand, time and again; it’s the fucking Winchesters. Their lives have been perfused with tragedy and loss, so much so, facing an Apocalypse eventually became an annual event. Sometimes it felt like they were the protagonists of some long-running aggressively heteronormative horror tv show on a very shitty network. But that never stopped them from persisting, fighting, surviving, and winning. Because in the face of undefeatable odds against ancient evils, they felt right at home.
Dean chuckles, “Was that a yes?”
Castiel followed him out, stood across from the hunter. They were both drenched within the minute. Castiel could tell Dean wanted to say something so he waited, patiently. He had watched the Earth take shape from gasses; he could wait for Dean to form his thoughts.
"We were a couple of dumbasses," Cas concedes, lips quirking up at the ends.
“What’s got you both so happy, this early?” Dean asked grumpily, “Which reminds me, stop being so happy, so loudly in the morning. I mean, don't get me wrong. I’m happy for you guys but- “
“What if we don’t?” Dean challenged, “What if we can’t find jack shit and Jack can’t find a way either. What then?”
“You okay, Sam?” Cas asks upon hearing Sam’s conundrum.
“Oh,” Cas said, looking skittish, like a child reprimanded for getting caught eating ice cream. “I’m sorry- I’ll just…” He began fumbling his way out of the passenger seat. Sam is right, Dean is a fucking asshole.
“Doesn’t sound like you,” Eileen rebuked at the same time as Sam said, “You threw one yesterday over orange juice.”
This time Dean wins, throwing a paper to Cas’s rock. And punches the air in the excitement of his victory.
“Worried. Just worried about you, Dean.”
“It's Claire again,” Cas said checking his phone.
Sam looked at her intently, letting her words wash over him. “I don’t think I would have survived losing you. Not completely. Not again.”
“What?” Dean asks confused.
“Are not!”
Sam watched Dean pull out the milk, so he, in turn, reached up and grab the flour from the cupboard.
He presses on the gas pedal a little harder.
“No,” Dean replies curtly. The answer sounding like a blatant lie, even to himself. “Why? What did Cas tell you?” Dean adds hesitantly.
And another.
Jack smiles because knows exactly how wrong Dean is.
“Um… the police, I think we might be getting arrested. So while we’re on the topic of getting help, could you… come pick us up?” Jack replies, sounding so very small.
“It was,” Eileen said with a smile, “I’ve never seen him jump so high.” Sam snickered next to her.
“Do what?”
“Did you want me to?” Cas looked away.
“Noth—”
The amicable and pleasant silence is broken by sudden shouts from the background.
“Anything?” Eileen asked as she offered him a beer.
“The Antichrist, yes,” Jack nods.
Dean wants to apologize. He is aware he should. He is considering it; he is about to open his mouth but he is cut off.
“I know you want to call him,” Claire almost spits out the coffee from her mouth. After a pause, Cas adds, “It’s okay if you already have.”
“I think… I think I’ve always been in love with Cas,” Dean said, there was a small challenge in his words, as if he was waiting, expecting for Sam to chastise him for it.
And with that he walked off, leaving Dean alone with a bottle of beer in his hand.
Dean feels like words are alien things that he never learned to begin with.
Eileen smiled softly, “Sorry, good looking. You’re a little too… let’s say, emotionally constipated for it.”
“If I don’t get any of this, it is because you don’t care to explain it to me. But have you considered that maybe it's worse because I don't get any of this and it just feels unfair all the same?” Cas says slowly and Dean remembers a moment from years ago, ‘
“It doesn’t count anymore, he’s not even in the running!” Dean says frustrated.
Sam’s face softens. Maybe, Dean thinks, maybe Sam already figured it out.
“Yeah, about that…” Dean began. He fell back into silence for a second, looking down at his hands. When he finally looked up, there was determination in his eyes. He breathed heavily, as preparation for what seemed like a... confession and then, “I’m in love with Cas.”
In an instant, Dean was shielding Cas with himself one hand guarding Cas, the other wielding the Angel blade that was tucked in his belt.
“I too, don’t understand,” Castiel said.
“Samuel?” Sam gaffed. “You’ve met my Grandad Cas, why the fuck would you call me that?”
“I think—No. I know. The week before the Shtriga thing, when we were at Jim’s place, Dad caught me with a boy. We weren’t—weren’t doing anything, but I think he could see it.” Dean laughs, a hollow broken laugh. “I’ve always had this voice in my head, telling me that—that loving Cas was wrong… that feeling that way about another man was so fucking wrong. I always knew it was Dad. I knew it was his voice… Because it sure as shit wasn’t mine… But I never—never knew it actually
Cas looked perturbed at that, “He really was an asshole. Wasn't he? I was merely trying it out. You don’t like it when anyone but Dean calls you ‘Sammy’, so I thought perhaps this could be a bargain of sorts.” He grabbed the jumbo pack of nougat off the shelf and dropped it in the cart in front of him. “I’ve noticed friends have nicknames for each other, I wanted one for you too, seeing as you are my best friend.”
“Two weeks to D-Day. How you feeling, sunshine?” Dean whispers softly into Cas’s ears as the dim lighting of the booth falls softly onto the couple while they sit close together, watching as Sam laughs and Eileen hustles four big burly men for every single penny they’re worth.
Claire knows for a fact that it is very, confoundingly rare to see Cas struggle with words.
proud of himself.
“Huh.” Dean took another sip. “And she was okay with it?”
“We want that as well… just with some adjustments, if you don't mind,” Jack says, as politely as one can to someone who’s currently choking your father.
white men– he never expected it to happen… like this.
The silence broke into simultaneous joyous screams and shouts, filled with ‘
“Yeah! It’s still better than Cas, at least. I feel like he’s actively trying to find out how much sugar Jack's gotta have to get a fucking sugar rush,” Dean retorted defensively as he began mixing the batter.
And then, another.
“If you knew what was his moment of happiness, I think you’d wish he got it even less.” Dean couldn’t bring himself to look Jack in the eyes so he stared at the table instead.
Dean chuckled at that, “Yeah, cause apparently, I’d sacrificed my greatest love.”
“Shall we go save our Angel, then?” Eileen asked with a mischievous smile.
Jack shakes his head.
“Which one’s your favorite out of these?” Dean asked, after a while. Eyes focused on the road.
“It’s better than a bare face and a ‘Don’t do this, Cas’” Castiel replied, amiably.
He rips his arm back and then,
Dean just grumbles like an old man in response. “I just don’t get why he wouldn’t tell me, is all. Could’ve given him the Impala or something.”
“What happened to Amara? Chuck…” Sam asked.
The car remains silent for a moment.
“Why?” Sam asked, Cas just raised his eyebrow in confusion, “You- you wanna move out?” he rephrased.
Now Dean was the one who cut him off, enveloping him in a fierce hug. Jack held onto him just as tightly. “We’ll get him back.” Dean said, ruffling his hair, “We’ll figure it out. Okay?
“Anyway, I hate this. I don’t wish to pick one. I love them both dearly.” Cas adds, running a hand over his face. And then burying his face into his hands.
“No, no. I get it. It's fine,” Sam said with another lethal bitchface and Castiel realized his previous assessment was very wrong. He was sure he was about to run away from the bunker in fear instead of just shuddering, now that it was aimed at him.
“You took my best friend,” Cas accuses with his finger pointing at Sam.
“Yeah, but.”
“Jacks, fine,” Cas saw Dean breathe a sigh of relief, “it's… it's my mother.”
More to come friends! Let me know what you think <3
“I…” He looked up at Cas, then just shook his head, “I don't know.”
His phone buzzed on the bed beside him, then again. There were two new messages from Cas, one reading, "And this is how crazy you make me, Dean."
On one end of the living room Dean was pating a hand on one leg while squeaking a toy in the other and calling out, "Gunner! Come to mom, come on! Just walk on over here and this toy is all yours. Come on, buddy!"
He was just about to open his door when a little yellow piece of paper caught his attention. He took the sticky note off the door and read it aloud, “Cas, you’re human now, so don’t forget to eat. Dean.”
“But that's the thing,” she moved in to whisper to them, “playing the game keeps us close and keeps us inside the building once it's locked down. That way if anything happens, we’re already here and we don't have to fight our way inside and waste time.”
“Cas-”
“But there is no minister to officiate the joining.”
"I uh… I looked for you too," she closed the book but kept her hands on it as she looked to them, "I didn't start looking until about a year ago. And I found you. You were working a case in Massachusetts."
He nodded, "That is acceptable."
"Wait," Sam tried to hold back his laugh but couldn't manage it, "why are you the mom? Why can't you both be the dad?"
“I’m Sera,” she pointed to her name written on the registry paper, “it says so right there.”
Cas chuckled, gravely and hoarse. "I promise I will make more of an effort to come home more often. I do miss you greatly."
Sam was the first to act and grabbed a few sticks that he could use to splint the baby's leg, Dean even gave up his jacket for Cas to wrap the baby in. When Cas had the baby settled in his arms, Dean led them back to the car, the sun now completely left the sky by the time they made it back.
“Do you know something?”
"All aboard!" They both looked over to the car now filled with all of his brothers and dad as Chuck yelled and waved Cas over.
“Dean,” she stopped him before he could hug her and instead pushed him back, confusing him, “I… I looked for you for years!”
He just smirked over at Dean, and said in a smooth, deep voice, just barely above a whisper, "Every night," with a wink.
He was instantly washed over with a calm in the house of the Gods, something he had not felt in years. The woes of his people had taken a great toll on Dean, and he could only hope and pray that the Gods would give him the help he so desperately craved. This was his last chance, his people's last chance for survival. If the Gods had nothing to give him then all of Nazareth would surely die.
“Dean, I…” Cas began with a shake of his head, “you do not have to do this, please don't feel obligated. And… and you've never been alone with Jack before, I've always been with you-”
It was of no surprise to Sam when he woke up the next morning to find Gunner not in his crate, and figured that Cas had thrown in the towel on the war, and taken Gunner to bed. What he didn't quite expect was to knock on Dean's door to let him know breakfast was ready only to have him angrily whip the door open and whisper yell at him, "You gotta be so loud, Sammy?! Cas and the baby are sleeping!"
“Nonsense, you will be fine, Ellen. The people will follow your lead, I have great faith in your guidance.”
“It doesn't sound like your father is still in the picture, unless that's too personal an inquiry. If so, please feel free to ignore it.”
“Yeah, this way.”
“No,” he shook his head, “Cas said they wanted to get in, hear her out, and leave. But…”
“Good night, Dean.”
When he walked in the door, his brothers were in the same place they always were, with Gabriel baking some kind of sweet thing in the kitchen, while Balthazar hovered and ate them as fast as he could make them. Their other brother, Gadreel, who worked on their father’s construction crew, always got home later in the day and so Gabriel would have to hide a separate container for him, or else Balthazar would leave none for anyone else.
He stumbled backwards down the stairs, watching as his body turned into exactly what the old woman had said, a beast. A hideous monster that had everyone in the hall running out of the castle in fear. Though he could pay them no mind as the pain of the change shot through every ounce of him, until finally he was no longer man. And when he saw his reflection in the glass of one of the windows, the monster inside now out, staring back at him with cold dark eyes, he let out an earth shattering roar that echoed through the now empty castle.
When Dean finished he took a deep breath and waited for Castiel's inevitable explosion. It was only natural that he would explode, afterall Dean was taking advantage of Garth's position, using the facility for free, and was now interfering with the practice time of a member of the state ballet. But instead, all he did was nod. He didn't say anything, didn't even really look at Dean, just nodded. Which in Dean's mind was worse than having him yell at him.
“Hopefully we shouldn't be too long,” Chuck said with a sigh, “I don't want this to drag out any longer than it needs to.”
“Jody, I can't just move in with no notice like this, I don't wanna impose on you.”
The sky was dark and starless as Dean pulled the impala into the empty parking lot behind the old brick building. As soon as he cut the engine he felt the instant drop in temperature hit his exposed skin, enticing him to quickly grab his bag and dart across the parking lot as fast as he could. It was coming into fall now, and it was an unseasonably cold September night as he stepped out of the car. The back door was left slightly ajar as it always was, the bright yellow mop bucket propping it open as Dean snuck inside and closed the door behind him. Once he was inside the warmth of the heated building, and his shivering had subsided, he smiled while he watched for a moment as the janitor shimmied across the floor to the beat of the music pumping through his headphones. With a slight chuckle he walked over and gave the man a light tap.
When the white finally faded and he was able to open his eyes again, Dean found himself back in that barn. He sat up and slowly looked around. The bodies of several vamps scattered at his feet, and to his left…
"Are you close?" Dean was met with another moan instead of an answer and he let out a breathy chuckle, "Me too. Now, keep stroking yourself nice and slow, Cas, just like I do, and bring your other hand down to play with your balls. Trail it down your chest slow, Cas, pretend it's me touching you."
“And the kid?” He asked, not taking his eyes off the young boy.
Dean took another step closer to Cas, laying his head gently on his as he asked, “So, do you want to marry me, Cas?”
“Are you excited, little brother?” Dean asked with a smirk over his goblet, “Your wish comes true. We travel across the seas to new lands, just as you wanted.”
“Yes, yes! Just let him sleep, the poor lamb. Jack is fine here with us.”
Curious, he slowly rolled his sleeve back and his breath hitched when he saw what now lay there. A scar, but not just any scar, it was a perfectly shaped hand print. There had been no injury, nor anyone else with him in the temple, not to mention it was completely healed. The only explanation Dean could think of was that it was a gift from the Gods, though why they had given it to him he did not know.
And he was gone. Dean was alone again, Sam was still dead, he didn't know what to do, he felt like he could barely breathe let alone come up with his next step.
Dean also laughed through his tears, "We love you, buddy, come visit your old folks once in a while, alright."
Cas gave Dean a confused look as he knelt down to be eye level with Jack, rather than towering over him.
“Oh,” the man nodded, “perhaps I shall have to try it someday.”
Jack lead the way down the hall towards the bathroom and Dean followed. Halfway there Jack turned and looked up at Dean beside him and actually reached for Dean's hand and took it, pulling him along.
“Dean, please,” she leaned forward on the couch and looked into his eyes, “I want you here, and this isn't something you should have to go through alone.
~~~~~~~~~~~
“Why?” She turned back to Sera, “I have to finish homework.”
"Oh…" Cas nodded, and turned slightly into Dean, "I guess you're right, it's been about a year since we found him. All the books said that the baby's only stay with their moms for a year and then head off on their own. I guess… I guess she's right, it's time-"
“Saving me?! Dean, I was devastated! Sam left, then you, and I was alone." She turned away from him wiping at her face, "You never even came back."
"Yes, Dean," he grunted again.
“And he seemed so sweet,” Gabriel pulled the tray of cookies away as Cas went for another, trying to ignore them, “he doesn't even want to go on a date, he just wants you to talk to him.”
Chapter one:
After a while, it seemed as though Gabriel’s shivering was getting worse, and just as Dean was about to jump down to do anything to warm the smaller man, Sam's hands reached out from under his furs and across to Gabriel. He grabbed him and pulled him towards his chest, settling him as close as he could against him. Gabriel opened his eyes with a squeak of shock, but upon realizing that he was being pressed into Sam's chest, he immediately settled and wrapped his arms around Sam, burying his face into Sam’s heat.
She said nothing, just stood and stared at him. He tried again, “Ma’am, are you in need of some assistance? I am the night manager, perhaps I can help you.”
He watched the two of them together over the last week they had been taking care of the baby. Dean would rush home from a hunt to be with them, would run to the store for anything and everything the baby needed, and spent the majority of his time doing research about how to make the baby's recovery as smooth as possible. Amelia had even called Sam a few times with a laugh in her voice to tell her that Dean had stopped by the clinic, again, handing her a note pad filled with questions about how to properly raise and rehabilitate the baby. As tragic as the whole situation had been, Sam was convinced that maybe they needed this, maybe Cas and Dean were meant to find the baby and do this together.
The first was the tickets Dean had been given by the directors of the ballet, the ones that were meant for her and Sam. The second… was Dean's tights.
~~~~~~~~~~~
“I can't wait!” Dean turned to look at Jack, still sitting and waiting patiently in his stroller, and took Cas by the waist, “Lets get him to the park before he changes his mind, and I did promise him ice cream.”
Dean smiled at Cas, “My folks are good people, and we love Adam.”
“His wife died five years ago, they never had any kids, and the rest of Jerry's family has been passed for over ten years now. I was all he had left.”
“This,” Castiel began and shook his head slightly, “this is very odd, Dean.”
“And you're sure there's no way she could have found out on her own?” Sera asked, still scrolling through the section of writing she was looking at.
“Tomorrow sometime,” Dean thought, “probably the afternoon. I’ll take Cas home in the morning and come back with Jack after they've left.”
“He's an amazing dancer,” Cas repeated, enunciating every word.
"Mom," he laughed as she came running through the parting crowd towards them, nearly crashing into them, "stop freaking out, it's embarrassing."
"But I'm a ballet dancer, Sam! Not some crazy cool hip hop dancer that you're probably thinking of, no, I dance around the stage in girly tights!" He slammed a fist down on the table, making Sam jump a little. "And the tickets Mom found in my bag, along with my tights, were for the performance I am going to be in. I am part of the Kansas State Ballet's rendition of The Nutcracker."
~~~~~~~~~~~
"I'm sorry, Dean, but I have to send you back." Though Dean was certain he wasn’t even the least bit sorry, for any of it, "I need to restore reality, put you on Earth where you're supposed to be, and bring Sam up here where he’s supposed to be. Restore natural order. It's the only way that Amara and I can live our one last life as humans. And you, Dean, you will help us do that. After all I've done for you over the many years, it’s time you owed me. Time to go back to reality now, Dean.”
~~~~~~~~~~~
Dean placed his goblet on the table at his side and leaned over, elbows on his knees as he spoke to his brother. “A life of peace and happiness,” he smiled, thinking back, “and as you saw in your dreams, me with children, so many beautiful children!”
Sam's eyes went wide and Dean could see excitement in them, but also perhaps a little fear. “What is it?”
Cas nodded, his nose rubbing against Dean’s as he did, and Dean leaned in closing the gap. He touched his lips to Cas’s and kissed him softly, sucking lightly on his bottom lip. It was slow, and gentle, and perfect, filled with years of love between them and Dean couldn’t think of anything better than this. He had never been happier.
The guard held up a finger to him, then turned a few steps away from him to speak quietly into a mouth piece on his jacket. After a few agonizing moments and the sudden worry that maybe he should just turn and run, he finally turned back to him. "Dean Winchester, you said?"
“Guys, I think we should register!”
“Of course it's the most popular,” she chuckled, “is there one for Sam?”
Just to drive his point home he lifted his hips to grind against Cas once more. He could feel Cas's arms shaking where they were placed beside his head, holding him up. And Cas let his head fall into the crook of Dean's neck, letting out another moan that shook Dean to his core as he did it again.
“Sam! Sam!” He came running up and stood between them, though Dean noticed much closer to Sam than he. “I have more supplies for our trip to the new lands! Food, furs, and more weapons. Which boat should I put our furs in, Sam?”
“Are you going with him?”
The next day Cas waited with baited breath as four pm came and went. Obviously he was right about Dean and that would be the end of the flowers and propositions. After a hard days work in his office, he made his way out to the kitchen to see what kind of treat Gabriel had made today and stopped when he saw his brothers leaning up against the wall by the front door.
~~~~~~~~~~~
“That was very honourable of your family.”
“Then who?”
Cas leaned in and smirked, “Do you wear a blue jumpsuit and come home a little dirty sometimes?”
“Can’t it?” she shook her head, “you seemed to have no problem leaving loose ends the last time one of us walked away.”
“How did it go?!” Balthazar was practically jumping on the spot waiting for an answer.
He had been in this situation before, him staying behind while the brothers went on a hunt without him, and every time he hated it. He hated being alone in the bunker with nothing to do, and to top it off both Dean and Sam had taken their laptop’s with him to prevent him from attempting to do anything other than relaxing. As he recalled, Dean’s exact words on the matter had been, “No work, no searching for cases, nothing related to hunting, period, while we’re gone. You just sit back, relax, and focus on getting your strength back.” And so now here he was, bored, with nothing to do and no one to talk to.
He couldn't help it if he blushed a little, or a lot, at Cas’s words, and just after that their food arrived. With one last wink sent Dean’s way, and a deeper shade of blush covering his cheeks from it, the two of them ate their food and continued their night locked in conversation.
Sam looks over at Cas waiting for him to blow up or at least look pissed, but he’s met with nothing but resignation. When Sam keeps staring at him, Cas finally sighs.
Cas sighs deeply. “I’m sorry, Sam. That was misplaced. I think I’m…”
“But in the end, he got it, right?” Jack asked gently, “His moment of happiness… I wish he hadn’t though. Isn’t that cruel?”
“Then what do you want?” Sam asks.
“Why would I want to end it?” Dean asks confounded.
May 2
He is seething with anger, “Yes, I fail to grasp all these human emotions because I haven’t experienced them, but I do understand how it feels when you reject me. When you avoid holding my hand in bars or when you flirt with the waitress at the diner or introduce me as anything but your partner—”
All three of them stood for in silence a moment, smiling with relief, taking in their win. Their big, unbelievably terrifying win.
“Pestering me… as always.”
Cas’s looks so fucking hurt,
“Are you okay?” Jack asks.
“Listening to music?” Cas replied, taking off his headphone. It was almost a question as if Dean wasn’t going to allow him the luxury.
He was so sure when he got there, he’d find his angel-
When the Nephilim came into existence, the world had fallen into chaos. Heaven was afraid of what destruction will be wrought upon the world by the Son of Lucifer while Hell waited impatiently for him to wreak havoc. However, the woman carrying the child knew beyond the shadow of a doubt that her son would be nothing but salvation for mankind. She could not have been righter if she tried.
Castiel made a small slit at the bottom of his throat and his grace wafted away. The Empty tried with futility to catch it somehow but it blew away.
“Oh my god,” Amanda moved to sit in the chair behind her desk.
Dean gave Cas a smile then looked back at Jack for a moment to say, "That's a good little man! Now let's go get you a bag packed for the weekend," and the three of them hurried inside together.
"Oh, Dean, you should know by now, after all this time, you can't kill God."
"Why not, Honey?"
The man nodded once more in thanks, then turned away from Dean to face the counter again.
They both laughed, not able to hold it in any longer as she shouted back, “You won't stop me, Dean Winchester!”
He lifted his arms up to Cas and when he was up looked at all the different flavors.
~~~~~~~~~~~
“Deal.” He gave Dean's arm a light smack, then as they watched Castiel beginning to gather up his things and ready to leave, they both turned away from studio two and walked back down the hallway together. “I'll walk you out, man, and I better see you tomorrow night.”
Beside him Dean continued to work in the early morning. Sam watched as over and over again Dean pounded his hoe into the ground with every inch of desperation he had. Sweat was dripping off his face, trailing down his chin and nose, soaking into the useless soil beneath them. He paused a moment and took a deep, heaving breath, before leaning down to sift a hand through the dirt. Nothing. Not even a dead root to prove seed had even been planted there.
“No, you can't…” Sam gave Dean a quick glance before looking back down to the hunter in front of him.
"Sam-" He began with a sigh.
“Actually,” he shrugged his bottom lip, “by my count you owe me at least a couple dozen lives.”
Before Gabriel could finish the doorbell rang, all three boys snapping theirs heads in the direction of the door, and with a sigh Balthazar stood from his seat.
Sam eyed Gabriel over Dean's shoulder. “He is not a spy, Sam, but at least I know with him looking after you it's less likely that you will do anything stupid.” Sam continued to eye Gabriel, then Dean brought his face back to his with a hand on his cheek. “Why do you push him away? He dotes after you.”
It didn't last long, but it was more than enough for Dean at the moment, and when they parted he couldn't help the face splitting grin that covered his face as he watched Cas walk inside.
The man’s eyes, and Dean’s for that matter, both went wide at his words as the man stuttered, “Did… did you just ask me out?”
"Why is this utter fiasco being blamed on me?!" She turned on the director. "Why don't you tell your precious golden boy here to properly learn the steps!"
~~~~~~~~~~~
“Enough!” Chuck raised a hand and suddenly Dean found himself frozen in place along with Jack. He couldn't move, arms tucked tightly at his side, feet planted. “I didn't come here to have you think you know better then me. I came here to talk and you are going to listen.”
Jack looked to his daddy then back to Dean and said, “Thank you, Dean.”
Dean didn't answer and instead just smirked at Sam with a wiggle of his brows, then turned back inside the room and closed the door. Leaving Sam to have his own silent victory party out in the hall. It was about damn time.
Cas followed him through the halls of the bunker with a confused look on his face, and right into Dean's room. Cas stood awkwardly by the door as Dean got in bed and settled the baby in the middle, pulling the blanket up and over him, then turned to Cas.
He made his way through the first floor, stopping by the bar to check in, then wandered up to the second floor to circle the halls. All seemed quiet so far.
Dean softened his devilish smirk into a genuine smile, and placed both his hands on Sam's shoulders, “When will you admit it, brother? Just love the boy already. It's obvious you feel for him, and he for you. The Gods will smile upon your union.”
Dean blushed, and Cas stepped towards him to bat his brothers hands away, "I don't know if they introduced themselves or just groped you, but it was probably the latter. These are my brothers, Gabriel and Balthazar. Sometimes they don't know how to keep their hands to themselves."
“They all agreed that they would go and hear her out, despite what she did to them when they were younger,” Dean continued as he shifted to slightly turn towards his dad, “it's going to be harder on the older ones though, since they spent the most time with her before she took off, and will have the most vivid memories of her.”
“Nothing to be sorry for,” he shrugged then turned slightly towards Garth to ask, “why's he here so late? I mean, I know why I sneak around the studio at ungodly hours, but he doesn't look like he's ashamed of being a ballerina. He's clearly taken classes, so why be here alone at three in the morning?”
“We all were,” Balth added with a frown.
"I would love that, Dean, now you just need to hurry home.“ He added that note to his collection and walked over to the cupboard. Inside there was a bowl with all of Cas’s favourite snacks, he then grabbed a couple beers, and walked over to the couch. He placed the snacks and beer on the table, grabbed the remote and turned on the tv.
"You're dead, you son of a bitch!" His whole body was shaking, fists clenched at his side's.
“Go get it, change backstage, and meet me center stage when you're ready.”
“Well, if this is any indication, I think he might actually come around to you and eventually maybe even talk to you!”
"Dead."
When she took the rose from him she held his hands in hers for a brief moment, "A gentle soul you have, young prince, that of your mother's." Then she turned back to where the eldest prince was now standing by the throne, "But you. You have the blackened soul of your father and only malice in your heart."
They gave the kid a nod and Sam leaned over to push the button for the second floor.
"And if anything happens or you need me for anything, just call me and I'll come straight home."
He looked Cas over once, noticed the claw marks on the arm Cas was holding against his chest where the wolf had nicked him, then sighed and said, “Alright, let's head back, get that looked after.”
“Why not?” She shrugged.
Six episode’s, one shower, a bowl of pasta, and three bags of candy later and Cas was starting to feel tired again. He tried to wait up a little bit in hopes that Sam and Dean might come back tonight, but it was nearing midnight now and he assumed that they had decided to find a motel for the night. He would call them in the morning to make sure.
"I will," he pulled the blankets up to his shoulders and rolled over towards where the phone rested beside him on the bed, "I love you, Cas."
“I do not think I can.”
“Great!” Dean gave Jack a thumbs up then asked Cas, “Should we walk? It's not far.”
"Gross to both."
He looked up to her still calm face, eyes remaining closed, he could not read her intentions. Why this? Why did she wish to see his gift from the Gods? What could it possibly do for her?
“For one night only, those who have registered for the hunt will be locked into the building. Once the building is locked we are going to turn off the key card senors to the elevators so that the players can access the upper floors as well.”
“Yes,” he nodded, “though it was under horrible circumstances.”
She nodded to Sam, “I had to stay late that night to get some paperwork finished, but when I left Jerry was still alive.”
Cas finally nodded, letting out a breath he hadn't realized he had been holding, “Okay. Okay, thank you, Dean,” and he collapsed into Dean's chest and cried some more.
“That would be nice, I hate sneaking around, I hate hiding something that I'm so passionate about,” he looked up at Cas, “to finally be free to be myself.”
“Okay then, let's do this.”
Dean chuckled, “I wouldn't expect anything less.”
Sam had not only taken the time to decorate the outside of the car, but also the inside. There was more confetti and streamers in the back seat, along with bottles of champagne, several cases of beer, and a very unnecessary amount of condoms scattered all over the back of the car.
She shrugged and much to Dean’s protests behind her, she followed Chuck back inside and into the ballroom where they were slowly starting to set up.
He did as Dean said and crawled backwards out of the crate. Dean then crawled in himself and lifted the baby out nodding to Cas for him to follow, "Come on "
"Please, young prince," she spoke as she tilted up to look at the prince, her voice broken and waivered, "the winter is strong and I have no place to shelter from the bitter cold. I beg of you, please grant me shelter on this dark night."
“Whenever you want,” Dean held a hand over his chest, “I promise.”
“I think so too,” Jack says and the smile on his face is almost audible.
“Stop calling me that!” Cas says exasperated, throwing his arms up. “I don’t think you marry your ‘buddy’, Dean!” Cas uses those air quotes he likes so much and Dean smiles softly and steals a quick kiss.
“Sap,” Dean chides, but he is wearing a soft blush.
“With your words?”
“I still am quite human, despite my powers,” Jack replied.
“Of course.”
decided to leave like that. And I’m not trying to ask you to forget that. I’m just—I just… It’s just that in this life, it’s very rare to find someone who loves you as much as you two love each other. And maybe Dean fucked up, maybe it’s beyond repair, but I wish you guys would talk, just once. He sounds just as broken as you, you know? And—I—I just want you both to be happy.” She exhales slowly, “I don’t… I don’t want you to talk to him if you don’t want to talk to him but if there’s a part of you that thinks it can be fixed, I’m asking very, very selfishly if you could try?”
“Quit fucking doing that, kid! My cholesterol is too damn high already. At least let me make it to 50,” Dean exclaims.
“I don’t know. I- I guess I’ve always been worried about that, you know? When you had your mojo, you’d just woosh away without a word–“ Dean added.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Dean’s still balking.
Sam’s not there but he thinks he knows Cas enough to know the smile on his face right now is priceless, “I guess you’re right,” he replies softly.
“I’m fine here.”
“Can I pick what we watch for movie night?” Jack cut him off.
“We raised Lucifer’s kid, the last King of Hell was a friend of ours, the new Queen of Hell is my mentor and you're absolutely smitten with a man-shaped angel; um, yeah. He would’ve handed us our asses back on a platter.” Sam answered.
Sam was too shocked to reply. Wow, Dean and Cas were definitely a match made in heaven if they were
Cas’s jaw would have to be screwed back on, if it opened any wider, “Really?” Cas sounded so shocked.
“I didn’t see a point.”
“Something like that,” Sam said. And because Dean was in his own room far enough away, and because this was Eileen, kind, unjudgmental, loving Eileen, he added, “And maybe because he made Dean happy. I think I wanted him around because he gave Dean hope, and made Dean smile and… I guess he was the only person who could make Dean even consider being… himself, completely.”
Who would’ve known that that man, would not only defeat Lucifer and God and every other awful thing that was thrown his way, only to emerge victorious as one of the kindest and most compassionate people ever? His brother, probably. And a certain angel, who might have started out thinking him broken only to become his best friend.
“Are you drunk too?”
it thick and sticky and palpable with fear and hate and
Dean brings a hand onto Castiel’s cheek, caressing gently, patiently with love and care and devotion. He looks Castiel in the eyes, “This? This is the bare fucking minimum, Cas… And you? You deserve the whole fucking world, and then some. I want to give that to you. Please, help me give that to you. Like everything else, I can’t do this alone, so help me out here, man. Push me, not too much, but a bit, I need to get out of my comfort zone. I need to do more, or I’ll never deserve you. And I want to, Cas… I want to deserve you so fucking bad…” Dean wipes a tear off Castiel’s cheek, pulling him closer by the neck, their lips brushing, “Cause you’re mine too. You’re my religion too, sweetheart.”
Dean gets up and walks over, cutting Cas off, “No, sweetheart. Come on. That’s not-“ Dean runs a hand through his hair, breathes deeply and then adds, “I want this to be as true as possible, too. Okay? I do. So… we’ll find a way to make this big fat Greek wedding legal as fuck, alright?”
They were lying on the bed, in only their boxers and nothing else, in the room that used to be Dean’s but had now become
