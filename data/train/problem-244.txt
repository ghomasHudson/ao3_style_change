A girl with long brown hair and a smile on her face opens the door. “You must be one of the new guys!” She says in a cheery voice and John just smiles at her. She steps aside to let John in. “Please come in. Kevin would like to see you.” John awkwardly walks in and looks around. He was standing in a slim hallway with on the right an opening towards what John suspect is the living room. On the left side are three doors and at the end of the hallway are two doors labeled ‘toilet’ and ‘bathroom’. John makes his way over to the living room. The room isn’t that big either. It has a rather large sofa, a tv, a small dresser and a diner table. The guy who gave him the card was sitting at the table, reading the newspaper. He looks up when John enters the room and smiles.
“No thanks.”
“It’s been 2 weeks! How can he still not have any information!” Sherlock complains as he walks around the living room. John tries to read the morning paper but with Sherlock pacing around like a trapped animal he can’t even finish the first sentence. He puts away the paper with a sigh. “He said he would call Sherlock. Give it some time and for gods sake can you sit down please!”
“We should get you some clothes. Mine don’t exactly fit you.” He looks at Sherlock who pulls up his legs and his ankles became visible. John stares at them for a bit too long and when he looks back up Sherlock was looking at him. John licks his lips without even realizing.
The man stares at him for a second too long before thanking John and telling him he could go. John gets up, wishes the man a good day and got out. He went to the first toilet he could find and locks the door. He leans against the wall, taking some deep breaths before grabbing his phone. He has given Sherlock an old phone he had lying around somewhere and taught him the basics. He quickly sends him a text.
“You’re still okay?” He asks when he sees Sherlock holding the blanket tightly. Sherlock opens his eyes and looks at John with a smile. “Never been better.” He answers, his voice all rusty. John leans forward carefully, trying to keep his fingers in place, and gives Sherlock an openmouthed kiss. Sherlock lets go of the mattress and grabs John’s hair instead, holding him down. John start’s moving his fingers in a scissoring motion and Sherlock moans in the kiss.
Just when John wants to say something a voice behind him asks. “Do you got the pizza already? We’ve decided on the movie.” John turns around and sees Greg’s head popping around the corner. When Greg’s eyes fall on Sherlock he walks up to them.
“Why won’t you talk to him?” She asks in a soft voice and Sherlock avoids eye contact.
"I know a better way to warm up." Sherlock says with a soft purr in his voice. He takes John's cup and puts it aside together with his own before leaning forward. John grins and automatically reaches out to put his hand on the back of Sherlock’s head. He leans in the last bit and kisses Sherlock on the mouth. Just softly and slow. There is no rush, no time limit. Just the two of them, together.
John gets the man inside and makes up a story about an unstable building collapsing. Sherlock is still outside and John walks up to him. “We should get you checked as well.” He says. “I’m fine.” Sherlock replies while looking in the distance. John keeps looking at him till Sherlock finally looks his way. “Just a check up. Please.” He almost whispers and Sherlock sighs before walking inside the hospital. John smiles and follows him.
“Oh before I forget. I’ll leave a note on the table for you tomorrow. On it will be a code for the small safe that’s standing outside the door. It contains a spare key. Use it to open the door and just put it back for the next person.” John nods and continues eating.
“Kevin wants me gone.” The boy whispers and John looks at him.
They are photos of his old home. Through the window you can see his father standing in the living room. The next photo is zoomed in on the window and you can now see a kid standing in front of his father. A young boy. The next one is zoomed in on the boy and you could clearly see bruises and cuts on the young boy’s arm and neck. John holds his breath once again when he looks at the next photo. His father is hitting the boy. John quickly puts them all upside down and takes a deep breath. He feels like he’s gonna get sick.
“Everything alright?” John asks and Sherlock nods. “Fine.” Sherlock opens the laptop, clicks a couple of times before he closes it again and places it back on the table. He walks to the bedroom and comes back all dressed. “Can you say nothing to Kevin about anything you just heard?” Sherlock asks while he grabs his stuff together. John looks up confused but nods. “Y-yea sure.”
John pinches the bridge of his nose. “Sherlock, What are you doing…?”
John smiles, even in his texts Sherlock sounds so mature. John starts getting dressed for work and just hopes the week passes fast.
“If you won’t then I will send him something~” She says with a grin on her face while she starts typing. Sherlock quickly turns around and snatches the phone away from here, turning it off. He turns once again with his back to her, holding the phone close to him.
John looks down at the necklace that is hanging around the man’s neck. It is shinning even brighter then before. Could that be because of the water? Or maybe because Sherlock is wearing it. John starts to wonder that if he wears the necklace he can transform like that. Maybe he can get a tail like that and breath underwater.
“That’s very smart of you. One last question. If I may ask, what made you run away?”
“You’re still here?” Kevin asks and Sherlock nods. “I’m staying for the night. I’ll leave in the morning.”
Sebastian looks at Jim for a while before giving him a small smile. He liked Jim like this. He was so fascinated by the sea and whenever he was talking about the creature that may or may not exist he looks so.. himself. That’s the best he can describe Jim. As himself.
“People get away with rape on a daily basis. It’s not fair I know. But it happens.” Just then John noticed what he had said and he looks away. Sherlock was quiet and just looked at him. The silence was interrupted by Sherlock who walks over to John and sits down next to him. “I’m sorry…” Sherlock softly whispers.
The car ride is quiet. John looks outside the window to the houses and people passing by. It is softly raining and the the water drops on the car window manage to calm John down a bit.
“So he hasn’t called yet?”
“I’m leaving. I’m out, that’s all I needed you for.” He says, not turning around or stopping. “So I don’t need you anymore.”
At one side John is relieved Sherlock came back. He wouldn't know what he will do without him. His life would be so boring again. Coming home to an empty house instead of Sherlock laying upside down on the couch while holding his laptop in front of him. He would have to sleep alone again, and to be fair he doesn’t think he can do that. His apartment would be so silent. But on the other side. All of Sherlock’s family and friends are gone. John does not know if they had died or were just gone. But Sherlock seems really upset. It must be horrible to lose the people you care about. John himself lost his mother. He remembers how horrible it felt. However he had the chance to say goodbye to her. To tell her all the things he wanted to tell her. Sherlock did not have that chance.
“Comfortable love?"
His mother doesn’t seem so sure about it but Jim jumps up with a small smile. “Don’t worry, we won’t get to close to the water.” He says and his mother can’t help but smile back.
It soon became Saturday and John’s mother has taken Thomas out for dinner so John and his friends can watch a movie. Greg and Irene are discussing whether they should watch a Marvel movie or Mean Girls when the doorbell rang.
When he says Sherlock’s name Thomas quickly looks around the room. When his eyes fall on Sherlock he smiles. “Sherlock!” He says happily and leans forward. John walks over to the bed and puts Thomas down. “You know what, why don’t you stay with Sherlock while i’m getting a shower.” John says and he looks over to Sherlock who just nods and turns his attention to the boy.
"John, come here and take a seat," He ordered sitting down himself.
"Hello Sherlock," She said smiling walking over to us, "How are you?" She asked but didn't get a reply.
"Oh hello John, I was wondering where you were. What's wrong?" She asked walking over to me concerned.
"I would do this with you lying down somewhere but I don't particularly want blood stains everywhere so..." He said and a moment later I heard the crop fly through the air and felt it cut into my skin. I couldn't help a groan of pain escape my lips and I leaned against the door as the hit made me weak and also to try to absorb the shock. Again and again I felt the crop slam into my skin with increasing strength so by the fifth I was crying. I felt tears stream down my face but as much as I tried to stop them they just kept flowing. When the crop hit for the seventh time I couldn't help a scream escape my lips as my knees gave out under me so only my wrists supported my weight pulling on my shoulder. Shakily I stood back up and got back into the position Sherlock put me in although I didn't stay like that for long. Each time the crop hit my knees gave out causing me to fall and scream. On the last hit my remaining strength failed, I couldn't even move my head to stop the door slamming into my nose. I stayed like that hanging by my wrists blood pouring from my broken nose making it hard to breath; even though I was breathing through my mouth the blood pouring into it from my nose meant with every breath I got a mouthful of blood.
"Go into my room," Sherlock ordered.
"Mrs Hudson, shouldn't you be making tea or something?" Sherlock said looking to her.
"First, I need to see if my brother is aware of what's going on. Come on John," Sherlock said walking towards the door. "And don't forget your scarf!"
I kept my head down and didn't reply not knowing whether I should or not seeing as the question was directed to Sherlock and not myself.
I snapped the thing around my neck and was about to continue tidying up when Sherlock called, "Come here," I turned and walked to him. "I assume, being a new slave, you don't know how to act." He said looking up at me.
After I was sure I could stand I went and walked over to him and took a seat. If Harry was dead what would become of me?
"And you John, when were you going to tell me you were Sherlock's slave?" He said turning his attention to me this time.
The cab pulled up in front of 221B and an icy coldness spread through my body as I felt the blood drain from my face. I knew more punishment was coming I just didn't know what. That thought alone made my muscles stiff and unmovable, as hard as I tried I couldn't get my body to obey what it needed to do. I had to get out the car or the punishment would be worse but still I couldn't move. I was filled with dread, I didn't know what punishment awaited me inside and I wasn't anxious to find out.
"Sherlock, can you hear me? SHERLOCK!" I said half in panic. He didn't reply, I didn't think he would but from what I could see there was nothing wrong with him, physically anyway. Despite that I did a thorough check to make sure but I was fairly certain. It was only then I noticed a faint trickle of blood coming out of his ear. There were a number of things this could mean but nothing seemed to fit right. Giving up I left Sherlock's side to find a phone, I had to get help. I had only just reached the door when I heard something change. I turned to look and was relieved to see Sherlock was no longer silently screaming. In fact it looked as if he was sleeping. Filled with a whole different panic I ran back to Sherlock to check, he couldn't be...
“Murder, nasty one. Obviously I’ve got my best men on the-”
"I'm sorry I couldn't help you. I'm sorry for not recognising that you were unhappy. I'm sorry for being, probably the worst flatmate imaginable. I'm sorry I never asked. I'm sorry I drugged your coffee at Baskerville. I'm sorry for the experiments in the kitchen. I'm sorry for the body parts in the fridge. I'm sorry for always waking you at 3am with my violin. I'm sorry I ruined so many of your dates. I'm sorry I couldn't save you."
"Yes, Mrs Hudson. But why wouldn't he tell us if it was something important?"
Sherlock's voice was so quiet that John had to turn to him to hear him properly. He wished he hadn't. He had never seen Sherlock in so much pain. He looked completely heartbroken.
"So, seeing as you panic at the mere idea of me departing, and the decision to let you lead your life without me, actually reduced me to tears." John had choked on his food when Sherlock admitted to him that he'd been crying to Mrs Hudson. Sherlock, crying? It was a combination that didn't sit comfortably in John's mind. "We clearly have no option but to stay with each other. Which means, we need to sort this out."
She stayed with John for the rest of the day. At about 4pm, John began to feel confined, so he popped out to get some air into his lungs, and Mary watched over Sherlock again. John returned and before he stepped into the ward, he saw Mary leaned on Sherlock’s bed. She’d pulled her chair right up close and her head was laid on her folded arms. Her mouth was moving, talking to him, and John opened the door slightly to hear what she was saying.
“Amazing,” sighed John, who had been stood to the side of the room, eyes never leaving Sherlock.
John wanted to punch something, something breakable. He wanted to tear his hair out. He wanted to scream. He wanted to create a scene right in the middle of the hospital. He wanted to throw the chairs. He wanted to burn the piece of paper that said Mary – his Mary – was going to die.
“Sherlock, why on earth would you think that. And I’ve told you, please, call me Mary.” She smiled fondly at him. But upon seeing the faces of John and Sherlock, her face dropped as she turned from one to the other.
“No shit. Where are you? Are you safe?”
(See the end of the chapter for
There was a new tension between the two men, uncomfortable, unwanted. It felt like there was a string between them, attaching them to one-another, not pulled tight enough to snap, but tight enough to be digging in on either side. An invisible cloud hung over the two inhabitants of 221B, a constant reminder of the past two months. Whatever this new feeling was, neither liked it. What used to be a comfortable routine now seemed forced and bland. Simple things like making a cup of tea seemed like a chore.
“Do I look like I’m planning to do it again anytime soon? What a waste of a question…”
"The East Wind?" John's brow furrowed in confusion at Sherlock's ambiguity.
If it had been quiet before, after Sergeant Carter had slapped him, it was nothing compared to the silence that descended upon the room after Sherlock dropped this bombshell.
John wanted to know what Sherlock and Mary had talked about when Sherlock had first visited.
Sherlock registered Mrs Hudson walk away, but did not turn, he did not even move. He just continued to stare at the grave - John's grave.
Sherlock sighed, "Just do it, I will explain in the car."
"Give me the scarf," Sherlock ordered, I had almost forgotten I was wearing it.
Sorry this chapter is a little short I have been busy with my GCSE mocks but even if I uploaded this months ago it would still be this short because if I where to continue I would be going into the next chapter and that makes my life harder. Hope you enjoy it.
"Yes the arms tell us when this person died but we all already knew that, the next killing will be at 9 o'clock tomorrow it only makes sense because first 12, then 3, now 6, but it is where they were killed that's interesting." Sherlock said excitedly, "Its the location! Oh there is nothing I like more than a compulsive serial killer who just wants to get caught. Look at a map, our killer is basically telling us where he will kill next, he is drawing a square! But anyway I haven't asked John to examine this body yet so..." He said gesturing to the body but I had, had enough.
"I have an idea but the problem is proof." Sherlock looked frustrated so I didn't push him. He raised his hands to cover his face and scrunched up his eyes.
"We are going to a crime scene!" Sherlock replied barley containing his joy.
After I was satisfied with everything I decided it was about time I took a tour of the house. I discovered a bathroom next to what I guessed was Sherlock's room and a small empty bedroom upstairs which I assumed to be were I would sleep.
"Who are you and what have you done with Sherlock Holmes?" I asked with a smile and at that I felt him bite my neck and start to suck. I let out a moan as I felt the pain of the bite mix with the endorphins creating something euphoric that sent my mind crazy.
"What are you doing, Master?" I asked looking at him concerned. Sherlock ignored me. I decided it was not my place and stepped back. Sherlock knew full well what he was getting himself into and I wouldn't be able to stop him.
"I want soup. You don't look to be the cooking type so look on my laptop over there," He said pointing, "You can search up the recipe and instructions." And then he left again walking into his room and slamming the door behind him.
"John, I want you to know that my mind is still better then anyone's with or without a hangover. Even when I'm drunk I live in a world of goldfish so I can certainly tell you are aroused." This was so unexpected that  I dropped the spoon I was holding.
"Hello, I believe we haven't been formally introduced. I'm Mrs Hudson and you are?" She asked politely. Obviously she hadn't seen the collar yet.
"Never came up in conversation I suppose," Sherlock answer slowly dragging out each syllable. I kept my eyes down cast and tried not to draw attention to myself.
"Pain off, activate control," As soon as the pain shut off I looked at Sherlock who seemed furious. "John, get up." Sherlock ordered, I barely had a chance to register what was happening, I found myself standing up and getting of the chair. So much for not moving.
Each time I tell myself I am mad. How can I feel that way for someone who beats me and owns me?
"First, I need to see if my brother is aware of what's going on. Come on John," Sherlock said walking towards the door. "And don't forget your scarf!"
"Its addressed to me, it says, 'Come and find me Mr Holmes. Tick tock.' So evidently he will kill again." Sherlock said looking jubilant. "This is fantastic, its like its Christmas!"
"That includes you too Anderson," Sherlock added disdainfully. Anderson shot Sherlock a look of hatred, his eyebrows coming together and his lips pressing tight together to form a single straight thin line, before striding out the room angrily.
"Fine but keep the noise down!" She said leaving crossly muttering to herself.
Sherlock hadn't said anything more because he physically couldn't. His head was thrown back in a silent scream, his back was arched off the bed, and his eyes were tightly closed. He was in agony. It was then I noticed new blood on the bed; new, fresh, blood spreading slowly from where his hands were. His fists were closed so tightly that his nails were cutting into his skin. Suddenly, what ever weariness I had vanished only to be filled with concern and fear. Jumping off the bed I ran around to Sherlock's side so I could reach and examine him better.
The doctor then helped me up and out of my clothes so I was naked. I was too tired to feel awkward and exposed and the doctor had a calming air around him so I was just as comfortable naked in front of him as when I was when clothed. He helped me into the shower and washed the blood off me. My wounds were still bleeding so to stop it from going everywhere he got an old towel and wrapped in around my waist to catch the blood and gave me a tissue to hold to my nose again. He helped my out the shower and sat me down again.
Sorry this chapter took a while, I wrote the others during my holiday but now I can only write and publish on the weekends; sorry for the inconvenience. I have tried to bare the tips in the comments section in mind while I write but I can get a little carried away and forget but I am trying and if there is anything else you can say that will help please leave a comment. Thanks :)
Eventually the pain dulled enough to understand what was going on. I looked around at the doctor but he stopped me. "Don't move. I'm stitching up your back so keep biting that leather."
After a minute the pain dulled and I nodded my head to Sherlock to say he could continue. He started to thrust into me, first gently but he picked up speed. Each time he slammed into me I half screamed half moaned in pain and pleasure.
"I thought I told you to stay in bed next to me," Sherlock said sounding almost back to his normal self.
Once again if you have any advice constructive criticism is welcome. :)
"I hope Sherlock doesn't go to hard on you," Mycroft said with mock sympathy before he left leaving me alone with Sherlock.
Okay after this chapter it picks up a bit so please bare with me. If you have any advise, anything I can do to improve please leave a comment because I really want to improve my writing. Thanks :)
Now my trousers were uncomfortably tight and I was itching to be rid of them but my hands where tied, literally, and I could do nothing but whimper. Sherlock seemed to notice my discomfort because he drew back and I felt him undo my trouser. He was being antagonisingly slow but more infuriating than that was that he was refused to so much as brush my...
He seemed to understand immediately that something was wrong because he directed me to the sofa and said, "What's happened?"
"Pain off," I heard Sherlock say before the torture stopped. I stood up straight but kept my head down, I couldn't stop shaking. I can't believe I let that happen, I had actually started to believe Sherlock was my friend.
"Alright, you will get ten lashes from my riding crop and try to keep the noise down I would hate to get a headache." Sherlock said. I tried to turn to see him but before I could I felt Sherlock pull me away from the door so my arms where straight and my back was exposed at a slight incline to make hitting me easier.
As much as I tried sleep wouldn't come. Ideas and thoughts tormented my mind making it impossible to clear my head enough to sleep. What would Sherlock do? Would he go too far? What would my punishment be? Ideas of the most ludicrous punishments crossed my mind making me laugh because I knew it would never happen but contrary to those thoughts where the most realistic ideas that were so terrifying it brought tears to my eyes and made the blood drain from my face making my skin as cold as ice as if the weather had betrayed me turning summer into winter making my room feel cold.
"Oh no, not yet. You are not to come until I tell you," Sherlock said above me and I could just imagine his smug look. A moment later I was flipped onto my front, so my arms where crossed, and my legs where  pushed under me so I was on me knees with my upper body lying on the bed. I felt Sherlock lean off the bed and to grab something and a moment later a wet substance was applied to my opening.
"Master?" I asked through the door but there was no reply. I rolled my eyes and went inside. "I have coffee." I informed him and was relieved when he sat up and accepted it. A memory of undressing came unbidden into my mind and I felt the blood rush to my face. I very quickly left the room and hoped that he hadn't noticed. He can't have seen that, he has a hang over.
Before we got to there another man came striding out. "Glad you made it Sherlock, he's right inside." The new man said gesturing to the house but then paused looking at me and pointing, "One sec, who's he?"
"Um, yes, I think I am." I said slowly.
I looked around, "Where..."
About 10 minute later Sherlock came out of the bed room with his hand up to block out the light. He stumbled over to the curtains and shut them darkening the room slightly.
"Heel John," Mycroft said after my outburst.
"Hmm?"was all I got in response.
I sat there for a moment trying to take it in, Harry couldn't be dead, my sister was the only reason I was putting myself through this. My first emotion was grief but then it very quickly got replaced with rage, anger and hatred. Mycroft said she would be looked after, he lied.
After half an hour the kitchen was finished, all plates had been washed and all rubbish had been put in black bags which were on the floor. Now was as good a time as any to see if there was any food in the fridge or in the cupboards. I was expecting worse upon opening the fridge, considering the state of the kitchen I was expecting mouldy food and things well past there use by date, all I found were a few shrivelled old carrots which I promptly threw in the bin. The cupboards were a lot better containing a few cans of hot dogs but other than that there was nothing to eat. Sighing I turned and picked up the two black bags at my feet.
"Umm..." I said unconsciously and Sherlock smirked. I was sitting up in the bed when he gave me a hard look. I knew what he was saying but ignored him. Sighing he walked over to where he had dropped the bag and went through it. I couldn't see what was in the bag my I felt my cheeks go red as he pulled out two handcuffs.
"Okay, Sherlock. I think you have had enough." I knew I shouldn't call him by him given name but I didn't want to remind him that I was just his slave, that would only make my life difficult.
I didn't bother replying I just took the wallet and left.
"I assume it's because of you." Sherlock said looking deftly forwards.
I looked at the body to try to find the pattern Sherlock was talking about but couldn't see one. The body was laid on the floor like the others with its arms in awkward positioned. One arm was above his head the other by his side so it looked like he was saying 6 o'clock. He had a knife threw his heart with a note attached that said 'ITBNEMTOORGIRWLENESOCTGDHK' and he had a similar complexion to the other victims.
I took a deep breath and entered the room. It was large filled with crates, large and small, and in the centre of the room stood Mycroft behind a table.
"Hello John, I don't want anything to eat but feel free to get yourself something." Sherlock said to me turning away.
"No, no, no! You're not asking the right questions!" He almost yelled before throwing his legs off the sofa, standing up, and started pacing back and forth up and down the room. I stood to match him but stayed where I was with my arms crossed.
We arrived back home at about 9:30 and the first thing I did upon entering the apartment was make myself a few slices of toast.
I knew all the way home that there was more punishment awaiting me and it made me shiver. I didn't want it to happen but I could see no way of avoiding it. The only thought that settled my mind was that Sherlock had never punished me that bad before so maybe he cared. Just maybe he cared enough not to go to far. I turned to Sherlock and saw his blank expression, I wasn't going to get much information from looking at him, so I turned to face the window and tried not to think about what would happen when we got back to the apartment. I had to escape again surely I can come up with a better plan.
. Our lives had everything, friends and now a family of our own. But one night, she didn't come home. I stayed up all night, worrying, waiting. I got the phone call at 3am. Her taxi had been hit by an intoxicated driver. She'd died on impact, and so had the baby. My wife and my baby, John, all in one night. My whole life had collapsed. I had
Holmes reunited with Watson, the detective and his blogger. Greg smiled and the world seemed to right itself. It was still a pretty messed up situation, and not one he would ever have included himself in willingly, but something about seeing both Sherlock and John together again seemed to make all of that irrelevant.
A few minuets later Sherlock came though the front door threw himself on the sofa and fell into his thinking position before saying, "Thank you, brother mine, good bye,"
"Not now Mrs Hudson," Mycroft said cutting her off and walking in. I followed up the stairs and he stopped outside a door.
I stood still for a second deciding what to do. My stomach grumbled, first thing's first, I had to eat.
The way he said it made it hard for me to stifle a laugh but I managed to contain myself.
"I am well aware of whom you were speaking to Sherlock," Mycroft said to his brother who didn't move.
Then I went to bed trying not to disturb Sherlock. I realised as I got to my room that I didn't have any clothes other than the ones I was wearing. Walking to the wardrobe I looked inside to see if someone had thought to give me any. I didn't expect to find anything so was surprised to see a few days worth of clothes hanging there. Smiling I thought to myself, "This might not be so bad," before collapsing on the bed and drifting off into peaceful sleep.
I left the room quietly and carefully shut the door behind me not wanting to disturb Sherlock. I headed to my room and sat on my bed in thought. Did he really mean it? He can't love me. For one we are both men but then again when has Sherlock ever done something considered normal. If anything he tries to do the complete opposite. I suppose it is only natural that he would love someone in a way that went against social conventions; even though it is a little bit more normal now, meaning loving another man was no longer illegal but loving a slave on the other hand was. I sighed and laid down; I could think about it more in the morning.
Only after the pain was shut off did I realise I was shaking holding my head in my hands.
"I need to go to the shops to get food but I haven't any money," I continued warily.
"Activate control, John go to sleep." Mycroft said to me and a moment later I was consumed by the black nothingness of unconsciousness.
"Don't worry John, Sherlock is on his way. You see I knew what you were doing straight away but I was curious to see what Sherlock would do so I came here and waited for him to realise. Turns out Sherlock knew almost immediately, it was what he expected you to do, so we let you have a head start before coming for you. I had hoped you would try and run to some abolitionists so I could arrest some traitors at the same time, two birds with one stone I think some people call it, but Sherlock seemed to think you would try and get the tracker sorted first. Turns out he was right but that didn't stop me from hoping. Anyway, when I caught you I knocked you unconscious as you probably remember now, arrested that friend of yours, then brought you back here." He said quickly like when Sherlock when he does his deductions, then he sarcastically added, "Did you enjoy your little moment of freedom?"
"Well I better let you get on with what you are doing, I wouldn't want your master to punish you on my account." With that she left leaving me looking after her in confusion.
"On my way!" He said gleefully before leaving the house. I was just about to see if there was anything left to do in the house when I heard Sherlock yell "JOHN, LET'S GO!"
"Dear God, what is it like in your funny little brains? It must be so boring." Sherlock said looking around at us befuddled.
Slowly the pain receded and I became aware of my surroundings; I stood up shakily and looked around to find my saviour. Mrs Hudson was standing in the hall way, her hands covering her mouth, "Oh Sherlock, why did you do that, what could John possibly of done to..." but was cut of by Sherlock jumping to his feet.
"Being whom I am, they decided it best to deactivate the chip so I could give an unbiased opinion on things. They couldn't have my opinion clouded, it would defeat the whole purpose of having me here. Now, even if I tell you to leave this alone I know you won't. I'm not going to help you, I can't, but I might answer some questions." Mycroft said before turning his back and walking back to sit in the chair behind his desk.
The cab pulled up in front of a brick house surrounded by bustling police. Red and blue flashing lights from cars dominated my vision causing me to blink. You would of thought that someone had been murdered with all this attention around a random house.
"Well," I started forgetting my place, "I love you," I said at a whisper. I hadn't thought Sherlock had heard but a second later he had closed the little distance between us and his lips were on my mouth.
"He is through there," She said before turning around and going back the way we came.
"Put this on." Sherlock ordered handing me a long blue scarf that appeared seemingly out of no where and, not wanting to cause a scene, I obliged. As soon as the cab came to a stop Sherlock got out and I followed intrigued.
I breathed out a sigh of relief then I let him get to work.
'BANG' I heard the door get blown off its hinges, my eyes flung open, a moment later I was surrounded by special forces police and Mycroft who was walking up to me.
"JOHN- PAIN SETTING 10!" He yelled at me over the noise and once again the pain started.
"Remove your shirt," He ordered walking over to me. As soon as I had the purple checked shirt off and in my hands it was snatched away from me then my view went black. Sherlock had wrapped the shirt around my head over my eyes blocking out my vision and I was just reaching up to remove it when I felt Sherlock grab my wrists and pinned them above my head. A moment later I felt cold hard metal around each of my wrists a hand cuff was secured around each of wrists then attached to the top of the bed. Wait, there was nothing to secure them to so what were the handcuffs attached to. I felt Sherlock then grab my legs and pull me down the bed immobilising me.
"I see you broke the gift I gave you. He may be physically able to do what he should but now he is as boring as ever; you have broken his spirit. I did think it would take a little longer break him but oh well." Mycroft had said condescendingly to Sherlock who kicked him out.
"W-w-what...?" I asked not able to speak properly. I got no reply but I felt something push itself into my hole. I realised Sherlock was preparing me and I couldn't help from clenching. Sherlock tried to force another finger in but I was so tight that he couldn't. He pulled out at me and... growled?
Sherlock walked over and heaved me onto the toilet seat so I was sitting up and knew what was happening. He left a moment later leaving me alone with my thoughts. I felt hopeless and weak, I couldn't even stop the only friend I had from beating me. No, not friend, master. He owned me and could do what he wanted with me. What was the point of running, I wouldn't be able to escape anyway, I should just accept my fate and who I was. I am a slave and my purpose in life is to make my master happy.
Eventually I managed to get out the cab and walk inside. I felt myself switch onto auto pilot and I became unaware of my surrounding and as a consequence of this I found myself inside the apartment, in the living room, with no recollection of how I got there. I looked around for Sherlock and he was no where in sight. Walking further into the apartment I noticed Sherlock walk out the bathroom and come over to me.
"Good. When we go out, if I deign to let you come, the rules don't change and you stay near me in case I need something, you must wear that collar at all times, unless I tell you otherwise, so people know you are a slave and finally you must always address me as 'master' or at the very least 'sir'. Understand?" He asked turning to face the TV turning it on.
"What a ridiculous question, what do you think?" Sherlock said in his usual I'm smarter than you voice but it was quiet and strained. He didn't elaborate any further but I could guess.
"Have you finished?" He said to the doctor.
"Master?" I said walking over to Sherlock.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Breakfast and tea is ready, Master!" I yelled loud enough for him to hear. Sherlock came out a few moments later with a grimace on his face.
"Okay what have you got, we need to catch this killer!" Lestrade said desperately looking at Sherlock.
In the back my mind I pondered what this could mean, does he have a thing for me, is it just my imagination, am I interpreting this the wrong way? If it was only lust then he could take me when ever he wanted because to the world I was little more than furniture; I would become a pleasure slave if my master asked for it and I would have no say, as always. The puzzling thing is that he hasn't take me yet so could that mean he cares about me? These thoughts and more go through my head every time I look at Sherlock but as always I dismiss them knowing even if I was correct, nothing would ever come of it. I was a slave and he was my master; any other relationship would just be wrong. Every time I dismiss the thoughts but before I do I ask myself the same question. Do I reciprocate the feelings? And even though I try not to answer, my reply is always the same.
The phone rang cutting Sherlock off, "Where?" he asked quickly then hung up and headed to the door, "Come on John."
"Hmm anyway Sherlock your five minuets is up, thank you for your input," The Inspector said then walked away to talk to Anderson who was standing in a corner probably making sure we don't contaminate the evidence.
"No, other that I should only speak when spoken to and I should do everything you say. Your brother said you would elaborate." I told him wondering what else there was.
"I have a theory but I not sure yet. Don't call for the doctors, that's an order. Just..." He said but he seemed too tired to continue. I knew what he wanted though. I walked over to the other side of the bed and laid down next to Sherlock. I wanted to call the doctors, I had to call for help, but I couldn't, so I laid next to Sherlock and waited until he was asleep to help him myself. It didn't take long. After a few minutes his breathing became even, I slowly moved off the bed to the bathroom to get supplies and walked quietly back to Sherlock. I wanted to wait a bit before I did anything; I didn't want to wake him. I set the things that were needed on the floor and, as soon as I thought I could do it without waking Sherlock, I started bandaging up his hands. He stirred a few times but other than that remained asleep. Breathing a sigh of relief when I was finished I sat on the floor next to the bed and watched Sherlock. The night dragged on but soon it was morning and I could see Sherlock starting to wake up.
"It's like a micro-chip." Sherlock said turning to me and walking closer. "When we are young we don't understand what is going on, we don't even really have an opinion. We believe what our parents believe, we think as our parent think. When you are young you are not your own person. As you get older these things changed. You start to get your own opinion on things. But the government can't have this. If children can think for themselves then they can start to oppose the natural order of things, slavery being a big issue. We are brought up with slavery all around us, but what if the children didn't agree. 10 years down the line slavery gets abolished because too many people have an opinion. The government can't have this, no, no, no, no. They make far too much money from it. The only way to tackle this is to change how these children think before they become older. So all children aged 7 or over get an operation, much like yours, where a... um micro-chip, gets implanted in their brains to adapt the way they think. Slavery is a good thing they are made to think. Of course these chips are disabled when you are about to become a slave. There is no point having them in slaves because they are not meant to have an opinion anyway, there is nothing that they can do; it would just be a waste of money. Anyway, all things have a fault. The micro-chips are meant to make us agree with slavery and all it stands for, but what if we go against it, even without meaning to, what if someone with the micro-chip loved a slave. Last night I admitted my love to you. The microchip tried to change my mind but failed and broke. While it was trying to change my mind I was in agony, when it failed and broke, it released me. The blood coming out of ear just proves it. I have had this idea for a while but my mind would always be changed, almost against my will, I have looked into it but then was forced to stop. Then I was freed and could think about it all I want. It's the only thing that makes sense. I feel different now. I no longer feel the need to punish you for going against the rules, or to command you to do things. I don't feel like you are my slave anymore, so while we are in private you can act how you want but in public we need to keep up the pretence." Throughout his whole speech I was rendered mute. I couldn't believe it.
"But how could Harry die, I did everything you asked." I asked Mycroft confused.
It was a Thursday and just after lunch Sherlock received a phone call that made him very excited.
"You say you can't shut it down." Sherlock said leaving the rest of his sentence to be inferred.
I saw Sherlock smile and get off the bed. I was already missing his warmth and I shivered despite still being fully clothed. My eyes followed Sherlock as he removed his shirt and I felt my mouth hang open when I saw him. I knew Sherlock was doing something like exercise when he went out but I just assumed it was him following a lead or something. His abs where slowly revealed as he undid each button and I felt my mouth go dry.
"Mghhh!" He moaned annoyed but opened his eyes.
I raised an eyebrow when he downed his first glass immediately and got a refill but I stayed in my place even though I was itching to stop him.
Mycroft strode into the room and I followed shutting the door behind me. A man with curly brown hair was laid on the sofa eyes closed with his hands together under his chin as if he was preying.
"What have you found out Molly?" Sherlock asked blanking her completely. Molly looked slightly upset but walked back over to the body.
"I have a theory but I not sure yet. Don't call for the doctors, that's an order. Just..." He said but he seemed too tired to continue. I knew what he wanted though. I walked over to the other side of the bed and laid down next to Sherlock. I wanted to call the doctors, I had to call for help, but I couldn't, so I laid next to Sherlock and waited until he was asleep to help him myself. It didn't take long. After a few minutes his breathing became even, I slowly moved off the bed to the bathroom to get supplies and walked quietly back to Sherlock. I wanted to wait a bit before I did anything; I didn't want to wake him. I set the things that were needed on the floor and, as soon as I thought I could do it without waking Sherlock, I started bandaging up his hands. He stirred a few times but other than that remained asleep. Breathing a sigh of relief when I was finished I sat on the floor next to the bed and watched Sherlock. The night dragged on but soon it was morning and I could see Sherlock starting to wake up.
"No, I'm not, if that's your final choice I have a number of forms for you to sign" He said.
"Well, maybe I could ask the right questions if you told me what the hell was wrong!" I said starting off normal and ending up yelling taking a step towards Sherlock.
"Sherlock, I need to know what happened last night." I said to him in a pleading manner. I needed to know, I had to know. If there was something wrong with Sherlock then he had to go to the hospital, or at the very least his brother. I cared for Sherlock, even after he beat me that first time. Granted things weren't the same between us since but I could help but care about him.
"Your haircut says military, of course that could be just a preference if it weren't for your tan. Stops at the wrists and around the collar so not sunbathing, no one would sunbathe in a shirt or say a military uniform. Then there is the way you hold yourself, proud but with that thousand mile stare that only someone who was or is in the military would have. There are only two places were the army have been sent recently that could have caused that sort of tan. Hence the question Afghanistan or Iraq." Sherlock said quickly and sharply before turning away.
"The name is Sherlock, and unless we are in public with your collar on show, that is how you should call me." I was taken slightly aback by this. I couldn't help but get the feeling that something had changed. Sherlock walked into the kitchen, grabbed both of our plates before sitting down at the table putting my plate on the table by the seat next to him. "Sit and eat. I can't stand the noises your stomach makes when you are hungry." I hesitated, but only for a second before sitting down. I waited for Sherlock to start eating before digging in myself, something had definitely changed. I decided to ignore it for now but if anything else changed I would ask. I watched Sherlock eat out of the corner of my eye. Usually he didn't finish his food, or eat at all for that matter, but when I next looked over at his plate it was empty. Putting it down to needing energy from last nights activities, I dismissed the abnormality of the act and continued eating. After I finished I washed up and Sherlock assumed his thinking position on the couch. I kept an eye on him while I tidied. I wanted to confront him about last night, about everything, the good and... the bad, but it wasn't my place. I didn't know how things were going to change. So I was keeping to what I knew; being the invisible slave, the furniture. But I wasn't anymore. Sherlock said he loved me. He showed my last night. So what was I now? All these thoughts swam through my head as I appeared to look busy, finding dirt in everything and insisting that it needed to be cleaned. I was procrastinating. I needed to talk to Sherlock, but first I needed to know what happened last night to cause... I looked over at Sherlock and saw him staring at me. Feeling daring, I walked over to the chair by the laptop, picked it up, brought it over to the sofa and sat down in at so I was more on level with Sherlock. I was daring him to say something, willing him to show me if anything had changed. He didn't say a word. He just kept looking at me.
As we left the police fell silent again for a second then the noise started up as if nothing happened.
"Follow me," Sherlock ordered stiffly walking through the living room and kitchen to the bathroom not bothering to look at me or even tell me off for breaking his rule of not sitting on the furniture. I felt my body comply although I told it not to and felt my legs drag me to the room.
Slowly I felt him move into me. It was all I could do to keep from screaming. I heard him chuckle behind me.
"Follow me John," Sherlock ordered and walked out the room.
I smiled and laughed but didn't respond hoping that would satisfy her.
I looked to Sherlock unsure what to say but he seemed to be to preoccupied with his work to notice. In the end I decided on the truth seeing as Sherlock hadn't told me to hide my collar this time and Molly wasn't the police. I lifted my hand and pointed to my collar so it was unmistakable and looked at Molly to see her reaction.
Then at 4 o'clock Sherlock got another phone call from Detective Inspector Lestrade.
"Haven't you noticed the pattern?" Sherlock said impatiently, "There was no need for me to even be here; you could have sent me a picture of the note to decipher which by the way says 'I'm getting bored now Sherlock' and I could have told you where and when to go to catch our killer."
"Okay everyone out please!" Sherlock yelled, "I can't bare being in such a busy room. It makes for far too much stupid at once." He said, it would have made me laugh if it wasn't for the fact I was having a very bad day.
"Best make a start" I murmured to myself.
"No," I said and walked out the room quickly. Technically it wasn't an order so it shouldn't bring me any pain and I was correct. I managed to get outside where loads of officers where standing and tried to get to the main road but before I could I heard Sherlock's voice behind me.
My only sunshine,
John had grown used to Sherlock's oddities, but there was one particular habit that made John feel uneasy, and John couldn't put his finger on why. It was probably because he simply didn't know the reason behind it. He knew about everything else. The violin at God awful hours of the morning? It was because it helped him think. Not speaking for days on end? That was Sherlock delving into the depths of his mind palace. Peculiar and often dangerous experiments on the kitchen table? It was Sherlock's childish love and obsession with science and expanding his knowledge that prompted him to continue with this. But this particular oddity? John just didn't know.
She started violently, turning forcefully in her chair. Wen she realised who it was, she immediately relaxed. Then, she proceeded to hit him over the arm with her tiny, yet surprisingly forceful hands. The sensation of her hits seemed familiar, yet unwelcome. Sherlock caught her wrist in his own hands and held them out of hitting range. She pulled her hand out of his grasp and folded her arms across her body.
So John dropped the subject and focused on an even more pressing issue. His wedding.
They spent the next few minutes repeating the same exercise as they had done before in the park. It took a shorter amount of time to calm Sherlock than it did John. Everyone shifted where they stood, not taking their eyes from the two men, waiting to see what would happen. Sherlock nodded as John spoke, acknowledging his instructions.
The driver ignored him, continuing to drive along their route and not turning around to even acknowledge him. Cartoon clouds appeared over a blue backdrop, and the screen faltered momentarily. When it returned, there was a face, smiling manically out at him. The screen faltered once more.
"Jesus Sherlock, watch it!" Sherlock ignored this and grabbed John's arm, looking at him straight in the eye, as if what he had to say was the most important thing in existence.
He turned to face Sherlock, hoisting his bag up to his shoulder as he did so.
"Thank you, Sherlock. This means a lot to me."
John only noticed him at the last minute, gun held in both hands, taking aim, pulling the trigger.
He focused on breathing. In, and out. In and out.
By the time Sherlock returned to Baker Street, John was already packing. He was leaving Baker Street to go and take care of Mary. She was refusing to stay in the hospital. She said the bed could be given to someone in more need than her. She wanted to spend her last few months at home. John would have rather died a thousand times over than see any harm come to Mary. But the universe did not care what John Watson would rather have.
“I’m fine, I’m safe."
No, a more accurate description would be that they supported each other, as they always had since the Sherlock had asked ‘Afghanistan or Iraq’. And, as they say, some things never change.
John let out a sigh and hailed the next available taxi. He told the cabbie where to go, and slumped back into the seat staring out the window. An ache began in his chest, and unpleasant thoughts flashed through his mind.
Mrs Hudson smiled fondly at the detective and shook her head at him. “When a certain young man waltzed into my life and taught me some very valuable lessons, and hopefully, I managed to teach him just as many.” She gave Sherlock a quick wink as she drained the rest of her tea and began to tidy up. She placed the two cups, on empty, one full but now stone cold, into the sink. When she turned back, Sherlock was watching John sleep again.
"I should have realised that he could never just get over the PTSD, the depression."
John felt his eyes widen.
For a while, Sherlock just stood there staring at the gravestone, obviously trying to hold back his tears. But then Sherlock did something that completely broke John's heart. He knelt down in front of the grave, leaned forwards and pressed his lips to the head of the stone.
John closed his eyes again and leaned his head back. She had expected him to get over Sherlock's death by now, but that wasn't going to happen. John was not ready to let go.
Sherlock had spent most of his days locked in the large manor house that belonged to his parents. They never had much time for him, only concerned with their own affairs. But to ensure that Sherlock never got into trouble they would keep the doors shut, and the windows open only slightly, although not enough for a young, deprived boy to make his escape. That’s how everything began for Sherlock Holmes, stuck in the same manor house everyday. He had no-one, nothing, and usually that would drive a person to insanity, but not Sherlock. He spent his days looking at things, observing, guessing, deducing. And young Sherlock found that the longer he spent looking and observing, the more he learnt. He learnt that the ugly vase atop the mantle in his parents’ room had once belonged to his great-grandmother by looking at the painting technique and the paint used. He deduced that she must have left it to his mother shortly before she passed away. And so he went on like this. He deduced that whole house, until the time finally came for him to go to school. At the age of 6, the customary age for a Holmes to begin his education – away from home so their parents didn’t have to involve themselves with the trivial affairs of their children’s education.
“Well, I best be off. You seem to have made a promising start, but you know what they say, the road to recovery is a long and difficult one.” John tried not to think about the double meaning, focusing entirely on the recovery of Sherlock’s memory, and not Sherlock’s possible relapse. John didn’t move as Mycroft walked out of the flat. He remained in his armchair, thinking. He could hear Sherlock moving around his room, possibly looking for something. John did not know, nor did he make any attempt to find out.
John raised his hands to Sherlock's face, his thumb running back and forth across Sherlock's cheekbone. Sherlock couldn't feel it, though how could he feel something that wasn't there?
“Awake?”
"Excellent work, Doctor Watson. Where is Alvarez now?"
But John needed him, needed him to stay strong.
"Sherlock, I'm not going to pretend to understand what you've been through, but I'm sorry, I'm
She took a few moments to collect herself, before looking up at Mycroft with her wide and tear filled eyes, looking utterly helpless. “
"You're the bloody genius, you figure it out." John finished stuffing his clothes, and closed his bag. He stood there for a few moments, trying to breathe deeply and get control of his anger and frustration.
And then Sherlock left early.
“We’re not naming our daughter after you.”
It made him sound like a love-sick teenager and he regretted it almost immediately. But to his surprise, seconds later, his text alert went off.
But as John looked closely at Sherlock, he saw a shadow of fear cross his face. Fear for letting himself become vulnerable? Fear for never recovering, and never knowing the stranger who stayed with him and tried to help? Fear of his own emotions? Any of these seemed likely. When Sherlock spoke again, his voice was softer, and he looked almost apologetic that he had been so harsh – a small part of the man John knew coming back to him, but not enough – never enough.
Neither John or Mycroft had actually let the hospital since Sherlock was admitted after his encounter with Moriarty. John was incredibly grateful to the eldest Holmes brother. Mycroft had sorted out all of the paperwork and had spoken to all of the doctors and consultants regarding Sherlock, whilst John stayed with Sherlock to make sure he did not do anything stupid. It was the most logical arrangement. Sherlock was most likely to listen to John and Mycroft was the most likely to have an influence over how long Sherlock was required to be kept in for observation. Having the British government as your older brother certainly was useful sometimes, and although Sherlock would never admit it out loud, John knew that he was grateful that Mycroft was here.
There was no need for Mycroft to elaborate. Greg knew exactly whose grave it was that Sherlock apparently visited on a daily basis.
It started about a month after John had jumped. One day Sherlock had just woken up and there he was, sat in his armchair as if he'd never left. Sherlock had run to him, but as John stood to greet him, Sherlock passed straight through him.
“Just remembering something.” John looked away, unable to hold Sherlock’s gaze whilst he was smiling like this.
He wanted to wake up in the morning and see John there, in his bed, with him. He wanted to protect John and in turn know that John would protect him. He wanted to hold John close, and be held close. He wanted to show John off to the world, so everyone would know that John belonged to him and that he belonged to John. To finally show that someone wanted him as everyone wanted to be wanted. He wanted to share everything with him, and in turn learn everything there is to learn about John Watson. He wanted to kiss John, to claim his mouth with his own and show John just how much he meant to him. He wanted to take John apart, and wanted to be taken apart by John. He wanted everything. He had never felt this way before, and had never considered any of this with anyone else. He wanted to share is ambitions, his life, even his name. A future without John was not a future Sherlock wanted.
“There is nothing more important to me than Mary. Did you hear me? Absolutely
Conclusion: he was not dreaming.
Sherlock threw his arms up. Yep, definitely the worlds biggest Drama Queen. John pinched the bridge of his nose and tried to breathe deeply. He'd lost his temper far too many times in a hospital for his liking.
He could feel his pulse quicken and his breathing became heavier and faster. Inconvenient? Inconvenient! How dare Sherlock do this to him!
“Sherlock? Are you still there?”
Mrs Hudson moved aside and ushered her boys in.
“And, has it worked?” John tried to keep his voice steady, but was failing miserably.
Sherlock knew that Mary suspected him. She obviously realized that Sherlock loved John, but Sherlock was determined to ignore this. So, apparently, was John, who chose to believe that Sherlock was simply in denial about them losing their close friendship. John had tried to reassure him of this on the case of ‘The Bloody Guardsman’, but Sherlock couldn’t stand to listen to John, who obviously didn’t actually realize what Sherlock was experiencing. At least that conversation Sherlock could walk away from, so he did exactly that. The topic was never brought up again.
Sherlock continued to sob into John's shoulder. He had never seen the detective so broken. He and Mrs Hudson had assumed that Sherlock had never had to cope with loss after the apparent death of Irene Adler. But Sherlock had suffered loss, one of the worst losses that John had ever heard about. He hoped that he would never have to experience that, and was sorry that Sherlock ever had to.
But she’s changed since ‘the accident’. Molly was more reserved now, and was standing up to Sherlock a lot more. Clearly, something must have happened to make her like this. What it was, Sherlock could not figure out. And there was nothing Sherlock liked more than a puzzle. His intention had been to acquire a new set of kidneys to experiment on, but the kidneys could wait. This was much more interesting.
“Sherlock?” John kneeled next to him, panic rising in his chest. It was not uncommon for one or both of them to be injured in a chase, but this was different. “Sherlock!” The panic seeped into John’s voice. He examined Sherlock, checking for a pulse – a wave of relief crashed over him as he felt the faint flutter of a heartbeat - and then searched for the cause of the damage. Impact to the back of the head, forming a large and ugly looking lump with purple bruising beginning to blemish the pale skin, knocked him out like a light. There was a heavy looking pipe just next to Sherlock’s lifeless form, so that’s what he had heard. The murderer must have hit Sherlock with it as he turned the corner. John looked up, but the murderer was long gone.
“Why, Mycroft? You weren’t keen on me being here when I first moved in, so why am I suddenly needed so badly? Why not just let Sherlock get on with his life without me? It wouldn’t have made any difference.”
Not breaking eye contact, Sherlock replied. Meaning every single word.
“Didn’t know what?”
“You utter, utter
"John, do you not think that if my brother wanted to disclose this information to you that you would have already told you?"
Molly’s shoulders slumped in relief, and a tiny smile graced her features. This was wiped away soon, as she regarded Mycroft worriedly.
John smiled at Sherlock from across the table, before returning to the newspaper in his hand. The paper was blank, why on Earth would an imaginary paper need information? It wasn't as if Sherlock was going to read it. An imaginary paper to accompany the imaginary man.
“No, I don’t want to bother you boys. You’re probably very busy saving the people of London.” She smiled sweetly and sincerely at John. She truly was fond of the man. He was good for her Sherlock.
"Oh?" John raised his eyebrows, bringing up his drink to his lips.
The past would always haunt John, he knew and accepted that. But that’s exactly what it was – the past, a mere shadow on John’s existence. For now, John needed to look to the future, and that future was here, in Baker Street, with Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock had gone through just as much as John had, if not more, and yet Sherlock had supported John the entire time.
"Promise me, John. One last promise." She opened her eyes again, they were still shining with tears that were threatening to spill over. It was obvious that she was scared. 'Bloody terrified' was how she had worded it once the time limit had been given. How could John say no? He simply couldn't.
John’s first date with Mary went well. Sherlock hadn’t even tried to ruin it. She was much like her sister in the fact that they both possessed a razor sharp intellect which impressed Sherlock far more than he let on. That and also neither of the sisters had been particularly offended or angry about any of the deductions Sherlock made about them. In fact, Mary had laughed with glee and asked him to do it again. Sherlock – the arrogant, spotlight-loving git – had obliged immediately, only stopping when John insisted that he and Mary had to be going because the restaurant he had chosen would not hold the reservation for them if they were late. John and Mary had chatted, laughed and John realized that he was enjoying her company immensely, and allowed himself a glimmer of hope that maybe, just maybe, this could work out.
"What?"
“Anything good?”
John could never have anticipated the shot. Despite being on high alert and taking in as much of his surroundings as he possibly could - which was surprisingly a lot, Sherlock would have been proud of him - he failed to see the assassin hidden in the shadows of the abandoned warehouse where his latest encounter with a high-status Serbian associate was being held.
There was a shuffling outside in the corridor. Sherlock turned his head towards the door only to see his brother walk through, watching him wearily, as if afraid he'd collapse or start a riot if he wasn't careful. Sherlock supposed that this was the end of his dream. Odd. Sherlock did not often dream of Mycroft.
But John either wouldn’t, or couldn’t speak. Sherlock believed it was the latter, as John had struck him as a man who knew what to say in most situations. He’d always offered Sherlock reassurance when he’d needed it in these past months. He’d always known exactly what to say, even when Sherlock was trying to make life as difficult as possible for the army doctor. He regretted that now. All John had done was continue to be a friend to Sherlock, and Sherlock had shut him out in favour of sulking and wallowing in self pity.
This caught John off guard. He always assumed that Mycroft and Sherlock were similar in their emotional aspects. But Mycroft had just shown John that he was wrong. Despite all of his prejudges’ and assumptions that Mycroft was – as that Adler had put it – an Iceman, Mycroft did have a softer side, a side in which Mycroft did care for his brother.
John hung up and left the building, just as the rest of his team moved in to deal with the mess John had left behind. He collected his minimal belongings from the safe house, and made his way to the airport. He had an appointment in Romania. As the vehicle Mycroft had sent took him to the airport, John closed his eyes and allowed himself to hope that maybe this time would be the last time, and soon he'd be able to return to his best mate.
Sherlock's eyes snapped up to her raiding an eyebrow at her reactions.
Sherlock was allowed into the woman’s flat (much to the reluctance of the forensics team, although they all seemed to be more wary of the consulting detective). The flat was small, cramped, barely enough room for two people. It reminded John vaguely of Baker Street. It looked lived in, comfortable, with an eclectic arrange of furniture and ornaments strewn haphazardly across the room. But it wasn’t untidy, far from it. The light shone in from the window opposite the wall, illuminating the room and allowing Sherlock to see everything he needed. They had been inside for all of two minutes before the deductions, observations and conclusions began to flow from Sherlock’s mouth.
“You’re mumbling again John.”
Sherlock couldn’t remember a time when he had spoken so long. He could feel his voice on its last legs as he concluded his story. He had never moved his eyes from John the entire time, apart from when he told John why he fell. He didn’t want to see the reaction on his face. John’s face looked quizzical, awed, shocked, sad and confused in one expression. Sherlock cleared his throat.
"Call me Liz, please Doctor Watson." She smiled up at the army doctor, extending a hand to him, which he took immediately, shaking it. As he did, a few strands of hair fell out of her bun. She tucked them behind her ear with her gloved hands.
Without waiting for a response John slips out of the room, locking the door behind him so Sherlock can’t get out. This guy seems to be stubborn so John plays it save around him. Well as save as this situation can get at least.
John looks away quickly, a faint blush spreads across his cheeks. The man swims towards the stairs, climbs out of the water and walks down, towards John. John looks at him, trying to focus on his face. The man looks back at him for a while, mumbles something that sounds like ‘thanks’ and walks towards the door. John quickly runs past him, blocking the door.
“It doesn’t have to be big. We can all bring something to eat and drink and just hang out at your place.” Greg continues. John sighs and looks at the group of people who have became his friends throughout this past two years. Molly is one of them. She’s the only one who knows about him and Sherlock and John had asked her to not talk about it. She understood and never said a word about the boy ever again.
John puts his head in his head but Sherlock grabs one of his hands. “No John, look at me.” And John does. “I can help you stop him. Make sure he doesn’t hurt any other kids. But I need, no I want, your permission.” Sherlock looks him in the eyes and John slightly nods. “So I have your permission?” Sherlock asks to make sure and John clears his throat. “Yea, but I want to come along…"
“You sure Kevin is okay with that?” John asks as he watches Sherlock walk towards the couch. His long legs sticking out underneath the oversized shirt. John can’t help but look at him till Sherlock turns around. “I’m sure it’s fine. I borrowed shirt’s from him before.”
“Sherlock already got caught once, I simply wanted to keep him save.” Mycroft says and Sherlock crosses his arms. “I’m perfectly capable of doing that myself.”
“Is something the matter?” John asks and Sherlock looks at him and then surprised at the plate in front of him. Like he didn’t notice it was placed there. John looks at him while he waits for a response. “No.” Sherlock replies a couple seconds later. “I was just thinking.” He picks up his fork and starts pocking the spaghetti in front of him. John takes a few minutes to look how the man was pouring around in his dinner before he speaks again. “I know you’re worried. But it will be fine.” John gives him a gentle smile and Sherlock nods, taking the first bite of his dinner.
It strokes back his hair and looks up at John. There is a short silence before he speaks: “Okay, i promise i won’t hurt you. Now give me the damn necklace.” John can hear the irritation in it’s voice. He throws the necklace in the middle of the reservoir and while the creature elegantly turned and swims towards the sinking jewelry John makes his way down the stairs. He can see the creature grabbing the necklace, putting it on before he says something John can’t hear. There is a bright blue light and John has to close his eyes. When he opens them again the creature is no longer there. Well it is there but it is no longer a creature. It is a man. With feet, legs and-
“The usual I presume?” The man asks while he takes a small package out of his bag. Sherlock hands him over some cash but the man shakes his head. “Price has gone up."
When they were finished John cleans up and Sherlock went back to the laptop. John took a shower and then grabs a  spare blanket and pillow, placing them on the sofa. He also places an old shirt and some new pants on top of the blanket.
More then a week has passed and Sherlock still hasn’t returned. John has send him texts but no answer. With every day that passes by John feels more worried. His shift for the day is finally over and he grabs his stuff. When he walks out of the back door he sees a familiar figure standing on the other side of the alleyway.
It is getting darker and John’s stomach starts to rumble. But he does not move. He stays on the stone, looking at the sea. The rain has stopped but a strong wind is blowing now. Cooling John’s body temperature. John shivers but again he did not move. He stays on the same spot, waiting for Sherlock. It is dark now. His phone rings but he doesn’t pick up because he simply does not care who is calling him.
Sherlock is sitting in the middle of his bed, legs pulled up and a laptop in front of him. Shinning a faint light all over him. Sherlock’s eyes flick up for a second but then focus back on the laptop. John walks in, holding up the shirt. “You forgot this.” He says and hands it to the boy. Sherlock takes it and throws it aside. John looks at him a while and then sighs. “Look I didn’t mean to anger you or anything. I just rather wait a bit.” He says and Sherlock looks up at him in silence. Then he closes the laptop and puts it away so John can take place on the bed. Sherlock, who is still sitting all curled up, just looks at John. There is a somewhat awkward silence and John wants to break it but Sherlock was faster.
She sighs and lays down behind to him. “Is he the guy you talked with me about?” She asks but Sherlock doesn’t respond. She places her hand on his shoulder. “Come here.” She whispers and Sherlock puts away the phone before turning to her. She takes his hands and looks him in the eyes.
Sherlock takes a bite and smiles. “I know people who have been cooking for themselves for years and they can’t even bake an egg."
John scratches the back of his head. “I don’t have one. I use public transport.” Sherlock gives him an ‘are you fucking serious’ look and groans. Then he walks away.
Not much later John and Sherlock are sitting in a cab on their way home. The ride back was as quiet as the one to his old home. John glanced over at Sherlock who was looking out of the window.
“I’m not going back there. I quit it all."
“That’s not the point.” John says. “Just the idea on its own. I already get shivers down my spine when I think about it.” He locks the door behind them and walks next to Sherlock towards the exit.
The cab stops across the street. Sherlock pays the driver a bit more and says “Stay here till we’re both in got out of the car.” The driver just nods and grabs a newspaper he has laying around. Sherlock turns to John. “I’m going in first. Do not come out of the car until I tell you to okay?” John wants to ask why. He wants to ask a lot of questions right now. But all he says was “Okay.” Sherlock gives him a kiss and exits the car, making his way over to the front door. He grabs the key behind the flowerpot John told him about and disappears inside.
“He’ll contact me."
do last night?!" John's heart starts to beat faster. Does Greg know? But how? He locked the door and left no traces at all about what happened that night. Or did he? Shit! Did he forgot anything? John’s head starts spinning while his thoughts fly through his head.
“What are you doing in my bed?!” John pulls the blanket over his lower half. He was wearing pants, but still.
"You're going to help me." The creature suddenly speaks in a deep, smooth voice. John is a bit surprised that it can speak. He sees it is waiting for a response but John can't think of a single thing to say and the creature continues.
John clears his throat and Sherlock looks up. “I got a two days off next weekend.” He says and Sherlock puts down the book. “We could go to the sea if you like.”
“Morning…” John says a bit awkwardly. The boy murmurs something back that sounds like ‘good morning’ and John just makes his way over to the kitchen to make himself a cup of tea. When he walks back in he notices the note on the table and he reads it before placing it with his phone on the table.
The man holds up his hands in defense. “Just having a chat. Something wrong with that?” John glares at him. “Not many people just talk to a homeless guy.” The man’s smile still hasn’t left his face. “Well i do.” He says as he grabs a business card out of his pocket and hands it to John. John, curious as he is, takes the card and looks at it. A house for homeless kids? He looks back up at the guy.
John shivers. “I don’t like the sight of this…” he says as he follows Sherlock inside. The building was indeed abandoned. There was graffiti on the wall and here and there the walls have holes in them. They arrived at the pool area and it looks even worse then the rest of the building. The pool itself was still intact and filled with rain water that came from the giant hole in the roof. There was moss growing everywhere and it makes the floor a bit slippery. John looks around but theres no one to be seen.
"Is there anything I can do?" He asks and John shakes his head. "I'm good mate, you can head home." Greg smiles and waves John goodbye.
It’s been two years since he has last seen Sherlock. It all feels like a bad dream right now. He snaps out of his thoughts when he suddenly feels something pressing against his side. He looks over to see Sarah leaning against him and he smiles. He met Sarah in the cafe. She just moved here and got a part time job as waitress. John has thought her everything she needs to know about the cafe and the neighborhood. They have been hanging around a lot lately and John has starting to like her.
Sherlock grabs a piece of paper and a pen from the table and writes down his phone number, giving it to John. “If you ever change your mind about that you can contact me.” John looks down at the number and then back up at Sherlock. “You make it sound as if you’re going to leave."
He opens his eyes and above him is a man. Well not really a man. The creature has the appearance of a pale man with black wavy hair and piercing ice blue eyes. But he has big fin-like ears and deep gills in his neck. John has to stop himself from gasping because this creature is gorgeous.
“It’s not.”
Lestrade’s expression hardened, a look of fierce determination on his features as he shook his head.
God, he felt like a teenager, he felt pathetic, how much could a man cry in one lifetime? John Watson felt like he was crying for the rest of mankind. He fished his phone out of his pockets and dialed the number of the only person he felt like talking to, because they would not pity him, they would let him cry. They would make everything better, because they always did.
He climbed out of bed and reached for his clothes. He dressed slowly, the disappointed feeling in his stomach was still festering. He knew it was silly to be disappointed, but it wasn't something he could control. It wasn't the only thing he couldn't control lately.
He moved back into his chair by Mary’s bed, and recaptured her hand between his own. He’d been so focused on Sherlock’s memory that he’d neglected to realise that his wife was suffering form something far more serious. Sherlock could live through amnesia. Mary could not live through this. And John could not live without Mary. And John could not live with the fact that he’d failed her. After having vowed to protect her in front of an entire church full of their closest friend’s and family, he had failed. He would never forgive himself for this, and he wouldn’t blame Mary if she didn’t either.
“Stay?”
With extraordinary effort, John managed to open his eyes, only to be instantly assaulted by a blinding light. He blinked a few times as he adjusted, and a shadow moved across his vision helpfully blocking the intrusive light.
So, she'd heard rather a lot. But she didn't look at him with pity, or fear, as one would assume someone would if they'd just walked in on you talking to a hallucination of your dead friend. She just looked sad, and if Sherlock had been paying attention, he would have seen the underlying guilt that shadowed her face.
And that’s what he did. He mirrored Sherlock’s earlier movements, although perhaps with not as much grace and agility – seriously, every movement that man made wouldn’t have looked out of place in the royal ballet.
“John,” it sounded good, hearing Sherlock say his name again – made everything more real, “John, please understand that I wanted to come back sooner, but Mycroft wouldn’t-”
"And what did he say?"
He pretended not to see the pity in the eyes of their shared friend’s and acquaintances.
Without taking his eyes off of his sleeping friend, Sherlock replied, “If it’s all the same to you Mrs Hudson, I’ll get changed, but I won’t be sleeping. I want to be here when John wakes up.” Mrs Hudson gave his shoulder another squeeze, to show she understood. Sherlock rose from his seat and turned to Mrs Hudson. There was only a moments pause, filled only with the sound of John’s heavy, sleepy breathing, before Sherlock stooped down and enveloped Mrs Hudson in his arms. She wrapped hers around his back and hugged him back just as tight. From somewhere just above her right ear, she heard Sherlock whisper.
“That’s because I love you, you daft sod!” She laughed lightly. John noticed how her smile seemed to light up her whole face. He had always love that about her.
"Jesus, I'm sorry. It's just- I just-"
“Sherlock,” John stood back up, still keeping his firm grip on Sherlock’s hands that were now squeezing his back just as tightly, “Sherlock, love, don’t say anything.
Not dead.
Mycroft stared at him with such an intensity that it almost made John feel uncomfortable. Almost – the man had lived with Sherlock for God’s sake.
“You know damn well it’s important Sherlock Holmes! You’ve put me through enough already, the very least I deserve from you is the truth. How badly were you hurt?” This outburst caught Sherlock quite by surprise. Only John had ever been ale to achieve this. His looked back at the doctor, whose eyes were fixed on him with such intensity it made Sherlock actually feel uncomfortable, again, something only ever achieved by the man sat across from him.
"Letting his henchmen do all the dirty work for him!" Liz's eyes lit up in realisation and understanding.
“There was a man, his name was Jim Moriarty…”
"What about that woman there? In the green coat."
Alvarez was sat opposite him at an identical chair, eating some sort of local dish which John didn't recognise. They hardly lavished him with expensive and well made food whilst he was imprisoned.
John shifted in his sleep, the blanket fell off him awkwardly, leaving him exposed, even though he was still fully dressed. Sherlock moved over to him and replaced the blanket with caution, trying not to wake John. He looked peaceful as he slept, younger. Sherlock’s mouth twisted into a fond smile as he continued to watch John. He sat back in his armchair as silently as he could. He removed his skull from the fireplace and held it at eye level. He didn’t say anything to the yellowing bone. He simply looked. He remembered all the one-sided conversations he’d shared with the thing. But then he turned back to John.
They were well beyond the boundaries of being just ‘flat mates’. Indeed, Sherlock would now label John as a friend – the best and only friend Sherlock had. Sherlock Holmes had a friend. One that did not shy away from his social abnormalities or the body parts in the fridge and the experiments in the kitchen, no. John would never do that, because he was Sherlock’s friend. And God, did it make him sound like a silly, over hormonal teenage girl, but Sherlock found himself incredibly happy and proud that he had managed to gain what had always out of reach. And apparently, this was registering outside as well.
Mrs Hudson never missed as trick, especially when it came to Sherlock Holmes. She thought something seemed off when she heard him rushing out of the flat earlier in the afternoon. She moved around the kitchen, going through the motions of making tea. She collected two mugs from the cupboard above the sink – which was full of petri dishes. She’d usually tell Sherlock off, playfully, for making such a mess. But given the way Sherlock was now looking at his sleeping flatmate, she thought it best not to mention it. She had always been fond of the youngest Holmes boy, ever since she first met him.
John opened his eyes to find that there actually was something wrapped around him. A pair of arms had wrapped themselves tightly around his shoulders, and his face was now pressed into a thick mass of fabric that made up Sherlock’s well tailored jacket. He buried his face into Sherlock, as sobbing began to accompany the tremors. His hands fisted in Sherlock’s shirt, so even if Sherlock wanted to pull away, he couldn’t.
And that same face was the only thing between him and his not-dead friend.
“Was.” Sherlock corrected. John could feel the tears burning in his eyes at such a simple word. He continued to attempt to make the tea, although his hands were shaking so much that half the contents of the mugs ended up getting splashed of the kitchen side.
They sat in silence together as the car pulled away and began their journey to wherever it was that Sherlock disappeared to on these Sundays. Considering what happened the previous evening, John had an uneasy feeling that it had something to do with his deceased wife.
Here, Sherlock was stuck. Why did he and John do that? Ever since they first met, they’d constantly saved each other, but why? The first time John saved him, he didn’t owe Sherlock anything. So, why did John do it?
“You showed how much you cared about me when you abandoned your
The sound of his phone stirred him from his thoughts, and Sherlock turned his attention to the incoming text.
"Come again?"
It was the only thought rushing through John’s panicked brain as he combed the streets of London. It had already been 3 hours and there had still been no sign of Sherlock. He’d promised himself, for the sake of Sherlock’s dignity as well as his own, to not get Mycroft involved, but now it was getting ridiculous. It was no longer dark as dawn had begun to break at about 5am, just a sliver of light along the horizon. But now, London’s skies were streaked with reds, oranges and pinks, the blue of the daytime beginning to weave it’s way through the other colours to gain it’s dominance in the sky.
"And what was that?"
The gentle babble of voices that had filled the room died immediately after Sherlock and John entered. There was a smash of china, not dissimilar to the one John heard on the night of Sherlock’s return.
The door opened. John stood there as a familiar figure strode into the flat.
Sherlock was already tapping away at the keyboard – deducing the passwords into the most secure computer in Britain – looking for all the world like a young boy who'd just received the very thing he asked for on Christmas. John heard Mycroft sigh heavily and watched him roll his eyes behind Sherlock's back.
“Yea?"
Now it is the creature’s time to look John over. He does it a bit quicker. He looks down and back up and seemed to already know all the information he needs to know. He grabs John by the arms and pulls him back up. His tail swings powerfully in the water.
“I’m fine. Lets get out of here.”
“Please answer me.” John types and he presses send. He hasn’t seen Sherlock in almost a month and he stopped responding to John’s texts. John sighs and puts down his phone.
Sorry it took so long... Life's a bit shitty right now and I lost a big part of my writing because of a computer error. I'm trying to get back to it but it's a bit hard now. Hope you guys understand :)
He comes back later with two plates spaghetti. He places one in front of Sherlock who immediately got up. “It looks pretty good.” Sherlock says as he sits down on the floor next to the coffee table. “I had to cook quite a lot so I know what I’m doing.” John says, sitting down across from Sherlock.
“J-John… I…” Sherlock pants and thats all he can say before he comes. The semen spilling over John’s and his own stomach. John only has to thrust a couple more times before coming himself. John slowly slides out of Sherlock who keeps holding on to John.  Their breathing returns to normal and John lets himself fall next to Sherlock. He grabs the cloth and cleans up Sherlock’s stomach before cleaning his own. He rolls off the condom, wraps it in the dirty cloth and puts it aside. Sherlock pulls the covers over them both.
“Then don’t think about it.” Sherlock responds simply. John sighs and just walks in silence. They are careful, making sure no one sees Sherlock. John even pushed Sherlock in the closet when two trainers walked by (Sherlock wasn’t so pleased with that). When they finally got out of the park John sighs in relief.
“I just thought we had something together… After what we’ve both been through…"
John sits down and looks at the boy who still hasn’t payed any attention to him. “So…” John starts. “Are you my roommate?” The boy looks up confused. “Roommate?” John nods. “Yea. Kevin said that the room was free. But I don’t mind sharing it.” The boy looks at him for a while before continuing with whatever he was doing on his phone. “Great, because it is my room."
“Do you know the boy?” Sherlock asks and John just shakes his head. “I… I have never seen him before…” Sherlock takes a sip of his coffee and John tries to do the same. But he’s barely able to swallow. “When were these taken…?” John asks softly and Sherlock takes the photos back. “Yesterday.” John closes his eyes and takes another deep breath.
He wants to grab John’s arm but then noticed the bandages around his wrist. He grabs his hand instead, pulling it up to take a better look. He then looks worried at John. “John…” He starts and John looks down at his wrist and then quickly looks back up. “Oh no it’s not what you think! I had a small accident while cleaning out my storage closet. It’s nothing to serious, but I thought I should wrap it up anyway before it gets infected.” John gives him an assuring smile and Greg looks at him before smiling back.
“So say that Moriarty guy has them,” John says. He is more thinking out loud then talking to the brothers. “We have to get them out of there somehow.”
Jim turns around with a dark smile. “There are creatures in the water, creatures that can swallow you whole. Or that will rip you apart. Some will drown you first and others will devour you alive.”
John bites the inside of his cheek. His fridge was mostly filled with leftovers, milk and beer. His cabinets aren't actually filled with useful things either. Just some spices, tea and some canned food of which John isn't certain if it is still good.
John cleans up a table in the corner of the cafe when the door opens. “Welcome!” He says but when he looks up his smile drops. Kevin and Molly are standing in the doorframe. Molly puts on a happy smile and waves at John but Kevin looks serious. They sit down at one of the table’s and John walks up to them.
“What?” John asks confused. The boy continues. “It’s my room. Has been for over two years."
“Amazing!” John says and Sherlock looks surprised. “You got all that from just looking at me?”
“Can I what?”
He holds them still again so Sherlock can adjust and John slides his other hand over Sherlock’s stomach.
“Let’s not talk about it now.” Sherlock says and he turns his gaze back to the window. John sighs and decides to look outside as well when he suddenly when he suddenly felt something on his hand. He looks at it and Sherlock was holding it. John smiles and squeezes it once.
“But still, it’s wrong, illegal and just straight out disgusting.” John says and Sherlock just simply waves it off, walking down the stairs.
John pushes Sherlock back and sits upright but Sherlock still stays on his lap. “It’s a three years difference Sherlock. You’re still underaged. We should wait till you’re at least eighteen.” John says and Sherlock just looks at him before he steps out of bed, making his way to the door. John wants to stop him but he’s already out of the room. John sighs and lets himself fall back down. He stares at the ceiling for a while and then turns on his side. He finds Sherlock’s shirt next to him and gets out of bed. He takes the shirt with him to Sherlock’s room and softly nocks before he opens the door.
When the boy closes the fridge he turns around and looks at John. They stare at one other for a while before the boy walks past him, shoving John aside. John stands there confused and then makes his way back to bed. He freezes in the doorframe when he sees the boy undressing in his room. He takes off everything except for his pants and a shirt and gets into the left side of the bed John was just sleeping in. John blinks a couple of times and the boy gets up, leaning on his elbow and he looks in John’s direction.
“Can you really though?” John asks and the Sherlock tucked his head to the side.
“John, do you have any medical supplies?” John turned his head back to him. “What happened?” He asks worried and Sherlock holds up his left hand. There was a cut in the palm of his hand and blood was streaming down his arm. John jumps up, despite his head protesting in every single way possible, and he grabs Sherlock’s hand. Taking a closer look.
“Do you got fish?”
He is cold, hungry and his eyes are getting heavy when all of a sudden something came out of the sea. It is a man. John jumps up, his body stiff from sitting in the same position for hours, and takes a few steps forward. When he could recognize the pale skin and black curls he runs up to him. Sherlock stumbles out of the sea, head low and slightly shivering. John stops in front of him and Sherlock looks up.
“Friend of yours John?” Greg asks as he holds out his hand to Sherlock. “I’m Greg.” He says with a smile. Sherlock shakes it and introduces himself.
Sherlock takes a deep breath and says “I’ve been to your old house."
The man leans back, crossing his arms. “Who are you talking about?” Sherlock slams his hands on the table and John holds his breath for a second. Sherlock looks really angry. John hasn’t seem him like this before. “You know damn well who i’m talking about Mycroft!”
He quickly grabs John by the arm and pulls him in the water. Just a second after they’ve hit the water a loud explosion is heard and stones and wood flies around everywhere. A white light appears and John closes his eyes. He can feel sharp nails growing out of the hands around his arms. When the light disappears again John opens his eyes and the first thing he sees is Sherlock. Sherlock is holding him close while he dodges the rocks that are falling. John does his best to hold in his breath but when he’s almost out of air he squeezes Sherlock’s arm. Sherlock gets the hint and blows some bubbles John’s way.
Kevin types something on his laptop. “Well John, How old are you?” John looks over at the laptop. “Are you writing this all down?” He asks and Kevin nods. “A lot of people come and go here. I like to keep track of who was here and for how long.”
Greg shrugs. "A bit yea, but not enough to put my job at risk.”
He puts his chin against his chest and looks the creature over. It's chest is as pale as his face and a pair of fins are sticking out the side of his torso. Around the navel his skin starts to change in a fish tail full of dark blue scales. John slowly looks back up and a bit of air escapes from his mouth. Just when that happens be realizes he is almost out of air. John starts to panic and tries to escape from the creatures touch, but it doesn't let go of him. Instead, he opens his mouth, revealing two long, sharp fangs, and he blows some bubbles in John's direction. John is confused, but opens his mouth anyway, catching the bit air that is blown his way. The air tastes fresh, almost minty.
Sherlock looks up at John. “Taking a bath, what else?”
“Okay.” Kevin says as he picks up the grocery bags. “Molly is staying at a friends so you can sleep in her bed.” He takes the bags to the kitchen without making further eye contact.
John leans on his hands to get up, but stops the moment he feels a burning pain in his wrists. The blood falls down on the iron platform and it starts to mix with the water. John sighs and gets up, looking into the water once more before walking down the stairs and out of the room. He makes sure the door was locked and walks over to the changing room. He lets the water from the shower run over him. The burning feeling in his wrists became stings and John looks at them until they stop bleeding. He takes off his suit and lets the water run on his face. He isn’t sure how long he is standing there, but he doesn't care. The warm water is nice and it clears his mind.
“Oh I see. Well I’ll put you on sick, you should get back to sleep. It’s not good to be sick for long this early in your new job. I have to get back to work. I’ll see you around!” With that Greg hangs up. John lets himself fall on his back, groaning. When he looks to his left he notices Sherlock was not there. John gets up again, slowly this time, and he stumbles out of the bedroom. When he walks through the hallway he could hear a sound coming from the bathroom. He knocks once before slowly opening the door. He freezes in the doorway when he sees Sherlock sitting in the full bathtub, tail hanging over the edge and his laptop on the laundry basket next to him while he was typing.
Any idea when you’ll be back?
He waits until everyone is gone and slips back into the room with the creature. He looks into the reservoir, but sees nothing. It is in the rock. He carefully walks up the stairs, keeping his eyes on the big, hollow rock. When he gets all the way to the top he is surprised that nothing happens. He kneels on the edge, splashing the water around a bit.
“John, you did good.” Sherlock whispers as he takes the gloves off John’s hands and stuffs them in a plastic bag in his backpack. He puts a hand on John’s shoulder, he notices he is slightly shaking and Sherlock looks concerned. “John…?” he tries and John looks up slowly. “I… I killed him…” He whispers and Sherlock sits in front of him, taking his head in hands and forcing John to look him in the eyes. “It had to be done John. Just think of the kids you saved.”
“This could sting a bit.” John says while applying the rag on the wound. Sherlock doesn’t respond. His expression stays the same, looking at how John treats his wound. John was surprised. He has never saw anyone not having a reaction on this. Most people tried to pull away or at least say something about it. John puts aside the rag and wraps bandages around Sherlock’s hand.
The man looks over at Sherlock who took place on top of the table and then back to John. “Answer me!” John almost screams as he puts his fist in his fathers stomach. The man coughs a couple of time but still doesn’t answer. Sherlock grabs his backpack and unzips it. John looks over at him and sees he takes out a pair of gloves, a hammer, a pair of sharp looking scissors, a pocket knife and as last, a gun. A gun with a silencer attached to it. Sherlock looks at John with a serious expression on his face. John takes a deep breath and puts on the gloves. Just when he picks up the pocket knife there is a sound of the front door closing coming from upstairs.
If everything goes alright I’ll be back next week.
He always had a big interest in underwater life. Especially dolphins, killer whales and sharks. So when Greg told him they had a job available, John didn't hesitate. He had send out his CV, got called in for a talk and got the job. And now he was here. Swimsuit on as walks around while Greg was showing him the basics.
John pulls back. “Sherlock I’m sorry. A lot has happened today and I’m really tired.” Sherlock keeps tugging at his arm. “I know, but the water is nice and warm. You’ll like it~” He says and something in his voice pulls John over the edge. He starts taking of his trousers and pants. “Fine but you gotta change. My bathtub is not that big.”
John can’t help but smile. “That’s just fantastic.”
“How are you planning to get anywhere. You don’t have any money, no ID, nothing! It’s not like you can just walk to the sea. It’s miles away from here.”
“I see.” The girl says as if it doesn’t surprise her. “Any particular reason for it?” John bit his lip and the girl quickly continued. “If you don’t want to tell me it’s fine! I was just curious.” John gave her a small smile. “That’s fine. But I rather keep that private.” Molly returned the smile.
They spend a couple more minutes just looking at the waves before Jim grabs the other boy his hand. “Let's go to the rocks! The view is better there!” He wants to pull Sebastian along but the boy doesn’t move.
He tries to recall what happened last night. He remembers Sherlock cutting his hand, John treating it, Sherlock kissed him and then-
“Oh thats a shame. Well maybe I’ll see you another time then.” Greg says and he waves Sherlock goodbye before walking back to the others. There is an awkward silence till Sherlock says. “I’m sorry."
Once they reach the surface John coughs. The creature grabs John's wrists and pins him against the side of the reservoir, his tail wraps tightly around John's legs. John looks it in the eyes again.
When Sherlock slides his hand in John’s trouser John suddenly breaks the kiss and grabs Sherlock’s hand. “W-wait…” John says and Sherlock frowns. “What’s the matter?” He asks and he sits upright. John leans on his elbows and bites his lip. “I… I’m just not in the mood right now.”
“I’m sorry Sherlock. I’m so sorry this had to happen to you.” John pulls him in for a hug. “You can always stay with me if you want.” He whispers and Sherlock hugs him back. Then John takes his hand and starts walking. He walks into a hotel that is nearby the beach and up to the reception. Some people are looking weird at them since Sherlock is still soaking wet and it starts to leak through his clothes. John gets them a room for two and a coin for the washing machine. He brings Sherlock upstairs, takes off his clothes and puts him in bath. While Sherlock is in the bath warming up, John walks back downstairs to let Sherlock’s clothes get washed. He writes down his room number so a maid can bring it up once they are done. He gets back to Sherlock with two cups of tea. He sits down next to the bathtub as he and Sherlock drink their tea in silence.
John hands Thomas over to his mother and walks over to Sherlock, taking his hand. “I haven’t seen you in more then a week. I’d love to spend some time with you. Doing normal things.” John smiles and Sherlock looks up before smiling as well. “Fine, I’ll join.”
Apparently John progresses everything a little too slow for the creature because he can feel the pressure around his legs and wrists increase. The tip of the sharp nails dig into the flesh of John's wrist and he can swear he feels blood drip out.
“Well… Father isn’t coming back.” John says and the boy looks curious. “Why not?” He asks and John bites his bottom lip while he thinks of an answer.
John looks the other way. “It’s fine, nothing happened."
“Wait here.” He says to Sherlock before he walks towards the sounds. He finds a police officer laying on the ground. John quickly makes his way over to him and kneels down. There's a small stream of blood on his head. Something must’ve fallen down on him. John helps him up and puts an arms around him for support. They stumble back to Sherlock and John gives him the man’s phone. “Get us a cab.” He says and Sherlock nods, putting his attention to the phone while managing to walk outside without tripping.
“I see sir. I’m sorry to hear that it has been stolen, but i know nothing about it.”
“Why would you help me even more?” He asks when he was standing in front of him again. John puts on a smile. “I like you.” He simply says. Sherlock pulls up and eyebrow while John starts walking towards the station, Sherlock follows him on the foot.
“I’m going home.” Sherlock says eventually. John’s hold around his wrist became tighter. “Are you coming back?” John asks and he lets out a shaky breath. Sherlock grabs his hand, releasing his own wrist. “I don’t know.” Sherlock lets go of John’s hand and walks in the water. John just keeps standing there, starring at Sherlock as he disappears more and more into the dark blue water.
“Sherlock.” John says to get the boys attention. “About what happened…” Flashes of his father appeared in his mind. Old and New ones. He bites his lip and looks the younger one in the eyes.
“I miss you” Is the message that pops on Sherlock’s phone screen. Sherlock looks over to his phone with hazy eyes. A girl with long blond hair picks up his phone and looks at it.
“But there is nothing to do about it."
Of course Sherlock bloody Holmes had to jump into the thames to go after a killer when it was almost winter. And of course he had to drag John with him. And since they were soaking wet non of the cabs would take them.
“What are you doing here?” John asks and he crosses his arms while looking at the younger boy. Sherlock stands in front of John, coat collar turned up against the cold wind and his scarf covering half his face. Sherlock takes a small, gift wrapped box out of his pocket and hands it to John.
The creature drags John to the ladder and pushes him out of the water. John hisses when his head hits the iron railing and he gets up, rubbing the back of his head. When he looks down into the reservoir he can see the end of a tail disappear in the dark hole of the big rock.
John is surprised when he sees Sherlock is taking off his clothes. “What the bloody hell are you doing?!” John says loudly but Sherlock ignores him. “You’re going to catch a cold like this!” Sherlock just continues and when he was just wearing his pants he walks towards the sea. John stands there for a while, looking surprised, before walking after him. Just when Sherlocks feet touch the water John grabs him by the wrist. Sherlock turns around and notices John was looking scared.
“Back so soon?” The man asks and Sherlock just nods. A cold wind blows through the alley and Sherlock puts his hands in his pockets.
“I see. Well I’m 19.” John says and again Kevin types. “Okay so you’re not underaged anymore. You finished school?” John nods. “I waited till I finished my school."
“Did he do something to you?” Again silence.
“It’s to dangerous.” He simply said and Jim shakes his head, putting on a smile. “Don’t worry about that. We’re together. Nothing will happen.” Sebastian gave in and walked along with Jim. They climbed on the rocks and carefully made their way towards the water. Jim kneels down and looks at the waves with a smile while Sebastian just keeps standing behind him, keeping an eye on the younger boy.
Sherlock didn’t take his eyes off the books. “You got quite a collection here.” He says as he picks up one of the older books.
Sherlock nods and John gives him a smile before grabbing the lube and pouring some in his hand. He warms it up and then puts it on Sherlock’s hole. Sherlock throws his head back as John makes little circles, relaxing the muscle before slowly sliding one finger inside.
"No. I've refused to do anything until I've spoken to you."
Turning in his bed, the sound of his hair against the pillow momentarily blocking out the beautiful music, and leaning towards the clock on his bedside cabinet, John saw that it was in fact 3:08am. John flopped back onto his pillow, closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose, breathing deeply as he tried to bottle his frustration. This clearly wasn’t happening, so he kicked his legs out of the bed, and jerkily swung his body around so he ended up in a sitting position on the edge of his bed. It was pitch black, apart from the tiny sliver of light that was slipping through the gap that the slightly open door left.
“Sherlock, you’re awake, thank God! We were all so worried.”
“William Sherlock Scott Holmes.That’s the whole of it – if you’re looking for baby names.”
It took twenty minutes for John to eliminate everyone in the building. Once he was certain there was no one left, John removed his left shoe, taking out the insole to reveal a hollowed out hole with a small mobile phone concealed inside.
"You're making that up. There is no way that's true." John wiped tears of mirth from his eyes, stopping his laughter enough to catch his breath.
John needed to escape, but something, loyalty or duty, kept him exactly where he was, still keeping a firm grasp on Sherlock’s hands.
“John.”
John moved quickly. He grabbed the gun from the guard, swiftly putting two bullets into Alvarez's head, and one each in those of the guards at his sides before he could even react. Two more guards ran through the door at the sound of the gun, and John didn't hesitate to shoot them on the spot. Knowing he'd run out of bullets soon, he picked up the guns of the two guards most recently dead.
Consciousness returned to John slowly, and the realisation of his location even slower. Hospital. Ugh, John hated hospitals when he was the one regaining consciousness on the hospital bed. The lights were often too bright and let off an irritating buzzing noise that never seemed to stop. John could just hear it above the sound of the monitor that was measuring his pulse. He could feel the tug of several needles in his arms, probably some sort of pain relief – most likely morphine – which was why he wasn’t feeling any pain at the moment. Coming down from that would be absolute hell later, but John was grateful for it now.
