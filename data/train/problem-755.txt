"Here, breath into the bag," the detective said softly. "Please, just calm down, please, calm down, John. I came back half a year ago. We had this conversation already."

"You mean... today? You were looking for something to... today?" Sherlock asked.
me... It's obvious I should have just died."
Sherlock had lied. He said that this hadn't happened before. He said that they hadn't fought about this. John shook his head, tears threatening to start spilling over again. "And...?" He swallowed. "What happened?" He spoke without looking up. He felt betrayed. He knew this had to have happened... He knew that they weren't always as happy as Sherlock had said.
"John please..." He lifted his hand to touch John's shoulder softly. "Please calm down, okay, honey? Please. Don't panic. It's alright. Everything's alright, okay?"
"After you were released from the hospital. You came back to Baker Street, punched me and kissed me against the door."
"Yeah..." Pete stepped back from John slightly and held out his hand. "Pete Kent." He smiled. "I've been anterograde for almost 12 years, I think."
"It's just I can't promise to tell you everything. I can't promise that, because I can't... I can't bear the thought of hurting you. Besides, whatever I lie about is just going to be forgotten anyway, right?" John laughed, trying to keep the mood light, while in fact he was getting more and more sucked into the old feeling of helplessness again.
"Oh God, the cabbie." John smiled as he ran his hand through his hair. "D'you think Lestrade knew? That it was me, I mean?"
Doctor Watson kept up the house, mostly, while Holmes started tending bees.
"You don't want to change my life with me stopping my cases, but I don't want to change your life with putting you into a ward... Don't you see why I don't want to put you there? Even if It's just part time. I don't want your life to be changed that much." Sherlock shrugged, looking down at the ring and the dog tags. "I don't know."
"No, I didn't move anything. But maybe you did. Try the cupboard next to it."
"You are not going to a ward, John. You are not. No. And I won't stay here." Sherlock got his suitcase out and started packing.
John reopened the fridge and pulled out the eggs as he laughed. "Yeah, the experiments..." He started putting his breakfast together, breaking two eggs in a bowl, and mixing in spices. He poured the egg mix into the pan and pulled a cheese out of the fridge. "So tell me things... How's Lestrade? How did you tell him that you're alive?" He put some cheese on the omelette and covered the pan so it should melt, and turned to face Sherlock. "Did he punch you as well?"
"Holmes."
As well as certain revelations and ANGST.
Sherlock\melted into it, moving his lips with John.
But you hated me today. SH
John rolled his eyes as he stood up, wiping his hands on his trousers. "Whatever." He pouted as he stumbled out of the room to the sitting room, and threw himself down on the couch, crossing his arms. This wasn't fair. It just wasn't fair. After a few minutes of sitting and thinking and feeling the room spin around him, he stood up to look for his laptop. He
"Yes, I know, I know." He nodded and leaned back on the chair just slightly. "It's just... It worked for six weeks. Six weeks you remembered everything, like I said we thought you were finally cured, but then today happened." Sherlock shrugged. "After I explained and you saw the pictures and everything, do you remember anything from that?"
He took Sherlock's hand gently, running his hands over his fingers, coming to rest on Sherlock's ring, feeling the other man shiver in response to the touch. "I have an idea."
"Stop it... Stop it. Stop it." Sherlock repeated over and over again. "Just stop it. I love you. I will
." He stepped back and sat down on Sherlock's bed. "Perhaps this is something we should sleep on?" He bit his lip. "Who's going where and all that?"
"I'm just reminding you, so you won't keep your feelings or thoughts to yourself, because you think they might hurt me or something like this."
John bit his lip as he smiled and wrote down "29th June" near the 2, quickly doing a bit of calculations and writing "11 days" near it. He skimmed through some more journals, smiling every once in a while and getting choked up at some things. He noted down a few dates on the list. So far it was looking a bit confusing to him. Sherlock had said that he forgot 6 times... But the dates weren't making sense.
I'll shut my phone again -JW
Holmes chuckled softly and started playing something slow and soothing.
John gazed up at the building and took a deep breath before stepping in resolutely. They were a little surprised to find a random man walking in to the facility, but he slid them a paper with Dr. Morstans' number and information, explaining the situation. It took a while, but eventually they gave in. A session with a random psychiatrist later, John was shown to a room.
Not hungry anyway. SH
Their lives were completely blissful.
"Why would this make you feel better?" Sherlock asked, turning his head.
John shares a bit of himself with Sherlock that he never did before and a very heavy discussion is had.
to trust you." He sighed. "Why did this have to happen?" He paused. "I mean, why did I have to be an idiot and mention the suicide thing? If I hadn't, none of this would have happened... I wouldn't have mentioned the ward, you wouldn't have suggested it now, I wouldn't have gone to talk to Greg..." He groaned and rubbed his face roughly. "I just hate everything right now."
"What?" He stared the taller man down.
For what, again? -JW
So you're being an idiot. -JW
John stared at him and sat down in one of his ratty armchairs. "How?
Are you at home? -SH
He remembered the whole lifetime with Sherlock, but this was different. They both had lives again. Granted, they weren't great lives, but they couldn't just fall right back into where they had left off. Even though they loved each other.
John deals with the fight on his own while Sherlock packs.
"It is not easier this way, John. Maybe for you, because you can run away and don't have to deal with Sherlock. You can lock yourself up in a ward and take medicine which is going to turn you into a slavering mess. Maybe another attack is going to hit you and you'll think that Sherlock is dead forever. This is running away. And the John Watson I know would never take that possibility. You're making progress. It's been longer since your last attack. It keeps getting longer."
want to be in a ward." His brow furrowed. "I feel like it would only make things worse."
WHAT IS THIS MADNESS
Sherlock just smiled and stepped in after him.
John passed the violinist every day, and each day he stopped to listen. He felt a certain pull to the dark-haired violinist.
"My mode of dress is no business of yours." Watson growled. "I would thank you to keep your experiments limited to your closet. If you would like to walk around all of London in a mere sheet, go ahead. But do not impose that on me."
There was Franklin, a young man who was suicidal as well.
Sherlock stared at the ground and sighed. "Yes, this is real. And yes, we are. Look at your photos."
"You doubt what?" Sherlock asked. "And you are too."
"Ow!!!" John immediately retaliated with a bang on Greg's head. "Why'd you hi' me if i' was Sherlock?" He shook his head and swallowed. "How c'n that even work?" John sighed. "If we have kids, it'll be a nightmare! C'n you imagine what it'd be like with me forgetting?"
"Yes, I do remember. The signs on the phone. It was obvious. But it wasn't because of her drinking problem?"
Sherlock took the cup and cupped it between his hands. "I have a place."
"On your birthday of course." He explained. "I never explained the thing I had, right? I just told you that I would be busy. Well, your birthday was after the fall."
Thank you? SH
John chewed the inside of his lip worriedly. "I probably should let my doctor know I had another episode?" He shifted in the chair slightly. "And maybe call in to work that I won't be there for a bit?" He rubbed the edge of Sherlock's ear absent-mindedly, as he gazed down at him. "Do they know?"
"What happened?" Greg asked, taking a sip from his bottle. "I mean, of course, I know what
you."
John pulled his phone from his pocket, opening up his text log. After a few moments, he looked back up at Sherlock. "This... is real?" He swallowed roughly. "And we-?"
John sat up quickly and grabbed Sherlock's hand. "I love you. Even though I don't remember it, I
Yes. -JW
"It's okay... You should be asking questions. And besides, I'm used to it." Sherlock smiled back at John and sat in silence for several moments before continuing, "What do you mean? The first time you forgot?" He asked as he took the tea as John handed it to him took a slow sip.
John looked over at Sherlock. "Because I
John stared at the man in front of him. "I know you." He said quietly.
He glanced down at his paper:
Watson kept his room upstairs, and they continued taking clients as usual. They kept up the front of being eligible bachelors, while in reality they were both in a very committed relationship.
John shook his head quickly. "No... No it wasn't." He smiled. "I meant thank you for thinking of it that way." He took Sherlock's hand, touching where the ring was. "I don't mind if
"I meant to give them over to you for your birthday back then, but I... Well, I was unavailable. And we weren't together at that point, were we?" He paused. "I was going to ask you with them, actually." He shrugged and blushed at the same time, while staring at the floor.

"And this is better, is it?" John huffed and rolled his eyes. "If you'd just have told me..." He paused. "It wouldn't have been good, but at least I wouldn't have to double-think everything you're saying now." He lay down on the floor next to the bed, staring up at the ceiling.
"Yes," a voice came from the other side of the room, a mere murmur. "Still under the bed."
"You did." He said firmly. "You very clearly did. Now, as I was saying-"
Nice -JW
John set the kettle down on the stove, heating it up. He reached around in the cabinet for the teacups, and placed them on the counter. He turned to face Sherlock as he waited for the water to boil. "It's not like I forgot you, though... I still remember everything about you... before you came back." He bit his lip. "I doubt if you were to move things around in the flat I'd know where they are. I know the flat because it's exactly the way it was before. I know Mrs Hudson because I knew her before... and I know

of that." He pulled Sherlock's hand down to his lap and looked down at it, playing with it and interlocking their fingers. "If you'd have been on a case... Or if you had been, I don't know, too busy to have seen my text, I would probably have done it." He looked up at Sherlock, trying to keep his voice steady, "And that could happen again." He sighed shakily. "I can't do that to you. I can't risk killing myself." John picked Sherlock's hand up to his mouth and kissed it gently. "We don't know when I'll have my next attack... I need to be watched. And the only place that can be done is in a ward."
"I know..." Sherlock said quietly. "But I'm afraid every time that you'll forget me in your next episode."

Greg held the door open and smiled at him. "Apologize to him. Try not to throw up on him. Alright soldier boy? You're an idiot but somehow you're cute."
"Watson?" Holmes's head felt like it was split in two. "What happened?"
"I don't want you to go!" John shouted down. "I want you to have your life!" He turned to look down the flight of stairs to Sherlock. "
Sherlock is picked up by Mycroft and brought home to Mummy.
John was upset to find that the violinist wasn't on the street-corner for nearly a week.
"About an hour."
John pulled away slightly, letting go of Sherlock's ring, and reached up to play with his own, his expression slightly distant. "I can't help that, can I? I don't want to hurt you... I don't want you to-" He didn't know how to verbalized how much he would hurt if he ever
Sherlock had his eyes closed and just tried to push any thought away, taking deep breaths when he heard the ping of his phone, informing him that he received a new mail. He wanted to ignore it, but Sherlock was too curious so he took his phone out. He tensed as he noticed that the email was from John. Sherlock read through the letter quickly, breathing out only when he finished. So Greg had told John everything, even about the drugs. Maybe it was now too late to get their things together. Sherlock didn't know how or what to respond. He moved out of his hiding spot and sneaked into the living room, seeing that John was already asleep. Sherlock took the laptop away and adjusted a blanket over John's sleeping form before going back to his spot underneath the bed. He read the email over and over again but decided against answering it. He thought it would be better to talk about it later.
Sorry this is so delayed!

"You kissed me, Watson."
"I wasn't!" He snapped. "Stop pushing at it. I'm going to bed."
John bit his lip slightly, listening to Sherlock speak, and nodded. "I'm working towards that." He smiled. I think I'm going to take a quick shower before-" He paused. "I take it that I don't sleep upstairs anymore?"
"No. I won't." Sherlock pulled out of John's grip. "You don't need to be in a ward. You have Mrs. Hudson here to watch out for you... And Lestrade will help you. Will save you. And Mycroft will definitely be keeping an eye on you."
You can't be him, he's dead... -JW
"Not about cases, no." Sherlock explained slowly. "You keep your journal there, though, but no one is allowed to read it besides you."
John smiled. "Where's my ring?"
John pulled his hand out of Sherlock's and shook his head, looking down. "But if that happens..." He swallowed. "If I don't know you... If the last thing I remember is coming back-" He looked back up. "Don't you realize how finding out that I missed 5 years of my own life would effect me?" His voice shook. "If that happened..." He cleared his throat. "Put me away?" He took Sherlock's hand now. "Promise me. Promise that if I forget you, you'll put me in a ward."

John laughed softly as he uncovered the pan, and flipped the omelette in half. He slid the egg onto a plate, and placed it on the table next to Sherlock, and stepped back to the counter to get a fork and knife. "And Mrs. Hudson? How did she take it?"
"One cube of sugar. I remember."
Saw whom? -SH
"Believability?" Sherlock repeated, his voice tight. "Do you think I'm lying to you? I'm not holding you hostage or anything like that." He said stiffly, turning his back.

Thank you, John? SH
"Because...Why would I come back? Why would I come back if you threw me out before? Why would I come back with the knowledge that you don't want me anymore, John?" He asked and shook his head.
John rubbed his head against Sherlock's shoulder briefly and smiled. "This is going to be okay, I think." He bit his lip. "I think it could work... I just need to ease back into it, you know?" A small frown flashed across his face. "I definitely do

"Oh... I see. I never thought that you would think of me as your best friend. But I never thought of you being my boyfriend."
"Should I take that as a compliment?" He chuckled and looked up with a smile.
John ran his hand through his still-wet hair, and tilted his head. "Mary?" He squinted, working hard to remember. "I think..." He frowned and shook his head. "No... Nothing." He sighed.
"Well look at that..." John bit his lip, grinning widely. "I never thought you were so romantic, Sherlock Holmes."
"You don't want me...What?" He asked and turned his head to watch John closely. "I can't have you lying to me, John. Whatever it is, you have to be truthful. I don't want to look at you and deducing that you are lying to me."
I'm waiting. -JW
"Yeah, m' drunk." John walked over to the bed and tried to bend down peek under, but only ended up tipping over and falling on his face. "Oops." He laughed as he turned his head to look at Sherlock under the bed. "Why're you down here?"
"I was

for God's sake." Greg hit the back of John's head with his palm. "You're not going to throw this away, John"
John cleared his throat. "It's not that-"
Holmes, it turned out, was ridiculously romantic. A year after the first time they slept together, Watson found a piece of sheet music with a little scribble on the top that looked like it said "John". The next day, he asked Holmes to play it for him.
"Because of society, you daft man. If people got wind... our lives would be ruined. I'd be lucky to be allowed to continue practicing, let alone on civilized people."

"Yes. It happened. You left him. You couldn't deal with it anymore. Just packed a bag and stormed out of the flat without an explanation."
Sherlock shivered at John's contact and then looked over at him. "I don't know." He shrugged, looking lost. "What do you want to hear?"
Yes, that three word phrase -JW
Right. SH
I am on my way home. -SH
Sherlock took a drink from his tea and sighed heavily. "When I came home, here, I found you in my bedroom. You tried... tried to kill yourself. You swallowed sleeping pills with alcohol. When I came up here you had already stopped breathing. I performed CPR as best I could and called Mycroft to get you to the hospital."
John rubbed his hands together as Sherlock spoke, and some tears overflowed from his eyes. He sniffed, laughing slightly at his stupid crying, and rubbed his face roughly with his hands, getting rid of the wetness. "I'd do that, wouldn't I?" He chuckled. "I honestly would have punched you know, if not for the fact that apparently we've done all this before..." He reached for the other man's hand. "How many times has this happened?" He cleared his throat. "How many times did I forget you?"
Would you guys like me to post a calender of what's been shown so far? (it would take editing on my part, but I could see if I could do it)... Then maybe I'd post it periodically with updates of what has happened (and been revealed) since.
!" He hiccoughed. "The only thing I know is that I can't keep doing this to you..." John looked up and bit his lip, his eyes swimming. "The look on your face yesterday when you walked in..." He jumped as the kettle started whistling. "I'm only going to do that to you again and again and again..." John repeated as he turned and shut the flame.
ME SH
John reached out and hugged Sherlock tightly. "I hate this so much..."
John sat down next to Sherlock, not letting go of his hand. "You used to be..." He searched for a word. "...Rougher." He looked down at the other's hand, and started running his thumb over the creases in his palm. "You used to be a bit..." He looked up, unsure of how to put this without hurting Sherlock. "Unfeeling."
Sherlock smirked and stood up, heading down the hall without a word.
John nodded slowly as he took another bite. "Do I still...?" He mimed typing to indicate the blog.
...Oh... You forgot again? -SH
John shook his head quickly. "No... The conversation started, and it needs to be finished..." He smiled shakily. "Besides, you probably should know what you're getting into if you plan to marry me."
So this is a game, then? -JW
"Well, then he is an idiot too. But I don't think that he meant it like that." He explained and hit John's head again. "You are an idiot and you go back to Sherlock, live with him, marry him and have cute little babies."
Actual actions show up in the next chappie
There was an empty feeling in his chest the whole time, and he kept wondering if it was better or worse than when Sherlock was dead - He paused in middle of folding a shirt and crooked his head - Sherlock... was dead. He bit his lip as he quickly put the shirt in the suitcase and felt for the dogtags around his neck, his breath short. Once he felt the metal, he breathed a sigh of relief. Sherlock wasn't still dead. He hadn't imagined the last two days.
Oh. SH
"Holmes." He whispered.
Oh, look, he's developed manners -JW
John sat up and rubbed the back of his neck. "I don't know, Sherlock. It's not just that. It's the fact that by all rights I shouldn't know you. That you're just some man off the street-"

It was the most beautiful piece Watson had ever heard, and after that, he had Holmes play for him every night.

"That was
It took a few moments before Watson sighed. "I did."
Sherlock tilted his head, letting John take control of the whole situation.
"First time it was Harry." He looked up at Sherlock. "The first time we met, you guessed that the reason we're distant is because of her drinking or her breakup... Remember?"
John jumped as Sherlock shouted, and the tears started spilling out again. "I'm-" He swallowed. "I'm gonna go." He backed out of the room, and quickly shot out a text to Lestrade, asking him if he would be able to meet up.
"I texted her earlier to tell her we might not make it in. It's fine, John." Sherlock explained as he moved a bit more on the bed, closer to John.
Even in the dark of the morgue, he knew he was in trouble.
Update?!?!?!?!
Because you were being annoying -JW
John sighed. "I know." He looked at Sherlock. "I know. I don't want to lose you."
It was a long while before John drifted to sleep, and when he finally did sleep, his night was peppered with strange dreams. After a restless night, he woke up at 6 AM... A habit he hardly ever broke. He wondered if he woke up later than 6 the day Sherlock had brought him to the hospital... Those sleeping pills must have made him sleep longer. He shook his head angrily. He felt a strange emotion well up in his chest... It was hate. He hated the circumstances. He hated that he knew that eventually he was going to forget this all again, and he hated the fact that he knew that what Sherlock was going through was probably 10 times harder than what he was going through. He quickly dressed, and glanced out the window to check the weather and frowned when he saw that it was still dark. Well... apparently it wasn't summer anymore. He chuckled as he realized that even while 6 months passed in the relationship between himself and Sherlock, 6 months passed in the year as well. Noting that it was now winter, he pulled on a jumper before leaving his room to go downstairs.
"I don't know. A couple of weeks." Greg took another sip from his own beer, working slower than John. "Don't make the same mistake, John. You're made for each other. Don't throw it away."
"You made me to love them." Sherlock scrunched his nose slightly, before chuckling. "I missed you too."
They retired to the countryside just after Watson's first white hairs made themselves known.
Sherlock nodded stiffly and turned around, walking back into the flat.
I know. I entertained you. Return the favor. SH
, he loved him.
the one with the problem here, Sherlock,
John forced a small smile. He was definitely not as observant as Sherlock, but he could see that the other man was upset, and rightly so. He just didn't know what to do to change it. "I guess I'll look for it after breakfast." He started walking towards the kitchen. "I haven't started letting you cook, have I?" He remembered how Sherlock's cooking used to be, with accidental mixing of experiments, and he silently hoped that he didn't change his stance of "No Sherlock near the food pots" over the past 6 months.
But... I don't understand SH
"Don't be sorry. I'll manage. It's okay. So don't worry. I'm okay." He smiled sadly at John and looked down. "Maybe I should move my ring up to my chain too."
JOHHHHHHHHHN SH
But you would choose someone different. SH
, Greg." He leaned over and tapped Lestrade's forehead with his finger. "What's lost is lost. Can't come back." The bartender brought over the new beer and John took a sip, working through this one slowly, feeling a bit of a buzz coming on. Now he was just drinking for the drink, not the feeling. He was just waiting for the real feeling to hit.
But this was different.
"What?" Sherlock looked at him and was confused for a moment, before his mind was able to process what was happening. "No. I never said that, John. You're not a burden to me. But it's painful for you to go through it over and over and over again."

John groaned and forced himself into a sitting position, leaning against the bed. "'s too early t'go t'sleep."
"I already called your doctor on my way home. We should see her tomorrow morning." Sherlock explained and looked up. "And yes, Sarah and everyone else knows about this, because you had an episode at work. I wanted to visit you and you... Well, you attacked me."
"No, we are not going to talk. Not while you're drunk like this. Your breath makes me dizzy." He sighed. "Maybe when you're sober again."
Basically I just wanted to tell you guys that I will TRY to update again soon (try be the operative word)
Sherlock followed John out of the room, but stayed downstairs, looking up after him. "I don't want to move out, I just... want to give you what you wanted. I'll come back as soon as want me to, as soon as you feel ready to trust me again."

see him again, but now, with everything coming to light... He definitely couldn't fight to keep him around. When he got up to the point where Sherlock said that if he forgot he wouldn't come back, he felt a flare of indignation. John didn't care. He didn't care if Sherlock never came back. He honestly didn't care. Except he did, obviously. He hated that Sherlock lied to him because he loved him. He scrunched the letter up and stood up and walked back to his bedroom. For most of the next 2 hours, John researched nearby medical facilities and settled on one that sounded good. The next morning he was going to pack up his things and commit himself. He wrote down the address and shut his laptop. After giving his room a once over, he changed into pajamas and head to sleep.

"John, I've meant what I was saying. I was crying after I read them. They weren't cheesy, and I didn't hate them."
Sherlock rarely looked up when he was playing, but he did one day, and his eyes fell on a blond man watching him. He missed a note, his violin screeching. Watson. His Watson. Watson was here.
"Heeeey..." Sherlock reached up to cup John's face. "It's okay, John... Don't apologize, John. Never apologize. For anything." Sherlock wiped away some tears from John's cheek. "What do you think...? About getting into a ward...? Now?"
Sherlock nodded. "I know. I've had this

John squeezed back. "How are we going to do this?"
"It's always too early for you, you git. This can't happen again. We need to go slower."
"Stop it, Sherlock." John spoke firmly. "You're acting childish." He shook his head. "You need them too. You stay here where they can keep an eye on you and make sure you don't fall back on bad habits, and I go to a ward where they can keep an eye on me to make sure I don't kill myself."
"I am busy, Watson."
John pursed his lips and took a sip of his tea. "Oh? Where?"
"When was our first kiss?" John asked in between kisses, slightly breathless now.
"No no no no no..." John muttered quickly, stepping closer to Sherlock instinctively. "I didn't mean it like that... I'd never think-" he sighed. "I just meant that it's helping, that's all."
"I don't care about them. I can take cold ones, solving them at home or taking you with me whenever you're feeling up to it."
John smiled. "I guess you have a bit of a bigger family than you thought."
Then you could go find someone else to love and you wouldn't be stuck with me. You deserve better than me. And I can say that I'll do better, but I won't. We could have ignored it if I hadn't said anything. Now I can't take it back and let you find someone else. SH
I'll continue annoying you at Sarah's. If you come home, I may not. SH
"I can't do that to you... You need your cases."
John shook his head. "Come home with me. Please."
"It'll be easier for
"I refuse to ruin your life by making you stop your cases." He smiled sadly. "Besides, you would probably end up killing one of us out of boredom within a week."
I love you too -JW
John smiled softly. "I missed you..." He whispered as he gazed into the other's eyes. "Another question..." He paused. "How much do you like kisses on your nose?" He smirked as he turned quickly to plant one.
"Do whatever you want. It's not like it matters what I say, apparently..." Sherlock turned around and kicked against chair, shouting angrily and indecipherably.
I really did go mad, didn't I? -JW
"Here. You need to drink this."
Holmes finished with a flourish. "Any requests?"
John shifted on the bed for comfort and swallowed roughly. "I don't want to be ill, Sherlock." He shook his head. "I don't want to be an invalid."
- bedroom. Sherlock lay himself down on the bed and inhaled deeply, trying to calm himself down. He fidgeted with John's ring absently for a few minutes, before he moved it onto his nightstand.
"Oh not again..." Greg shook his head and sighed, taking another sip from his beer. "Did you tell him that you're not able to love him like he does and whatnot? And that you want to leave him?"
"Don't..." He laughed and shook his head, pointing at Greg, "Don' call a soldier
Stamford smiled and introduced him to Holmes, who rattled off practically Watson's whole life story after just a glance.
John looked at him. "I... I have a whole other life."
"PTSD." Sherlock said, watching John closely after he sat down. "You have a tendency to react like this. And it's nothing to be sorry about. At all." Sherlock said with a slow shrug and leaned back in his chair. "Maybe you should lay down and get some sleep."
"And you even proposed? How cute you are." Greg giggled. "You can't break up with him."
JOHN SH
Sherlock looked at John, almost annoyed about the loss of John's lips, but then he smiled. "That wad almost poetic. Okay, let's go then."
John shook his head slowly. "I wish I did." He frowned. "I really,
Sherlock huffed out a response, not turning his head to look at his mother, who continued to sit there. She sat close to him and moved her hand up to Sherlock's shoulder and squeezed it gently. "Everyone has a domestic once in their lifetime. And everyone lives apart from the ones their love, Sherlock. It's normal to feel pain and it's normal that you don't have any hope at the moment, but I know you and John and I know that you two will get back together."
"If you say so. Play me something?"
JoHn SH
"Oh, John. This would never change my view of you. Never. I am surprised, yes, but only because I wasn't expected it at all. But I don't think any different of you." Sherlock sighed and moved a bit, moving his hands up to the table and showing John his scarred wrists. "I know what you're talking about."
"Because I liked you before, you idiot." He smiled sadly. "I always liked you."
John jumped and turned to face Sherlock, holding the picture-frame tightly. "Good morning. Slept well?"
"I know, John, but that doesn't mean I just stop being afraid. I just fear that something changes and you'll forget about me too."
Sherlock looked at him. "You're not my parent, John."
I can just steal from Mycroft. SH
I added a paragraph because it would be weird anywhere else... ehehehe
walkway in front of 221B to discuss the fact that you have
"No, but I know you. Sometimes you freak out because you feel so guilty." Sherlock sat. "But It's amazing that you remember everything else. You know Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson, you know the flat, you just don't know me." He looked down.
I'm going to a motel so you don't have to go bother Sarah -JW
Not a derivation of Thank You -JW
Looking at that man, standing over a corpse, his hair slightly mussed... Speaking to him, with that deep, baritone voice.
Okay, so I couldn't stay away... Another update in the same day.

"John... We don't have to talk about it if you don't want to... It's clear that you're uncomfortable."
I was annoyed -JW
"No. I mean... When we first met, I never thought that you would want to be my friend. When I realized my feelings for you, I never thought you would consider me worthy enough to be my boyfriend. I never expected any of this to happen."
Come home. SH
A short while later, John stepped out of the bathroom wearing his bathrobe. He looked around the room anxiously, afraid that he wouldn't be able to find Sherlock, when his eyes fell on a figure on the couch. He stepped towards Sherlock slowly. John didn't want to leave the flat to go upstairs. He didn't want to leave Sherlock for fear of him disappearing, but he wasn't going to feel right sharing a bed with him just yet... He knew they must have slept together, but he didn't remember it... and it would feel
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO SH
"Don't be. It's okay." Sherlock sighed and closed his eyes for a moment, completely leaning against John's hand. "I'm used to this by now. Your last attack was six weeks ago, this was the longest time between two attacks. We already thought you were cured." Sherlock murmured as an answer.
"An idea...? What are you talking about?"
"I'm not." Sherlock sat up as well. "I'm not just some man off the street, and you know that."
Found my cigarettes. Rubbish hiding place. SH
Sherlock thought about his for a second, before he sighed. "Mostly you. When you come out of the shower, after a chase, after our first kiss. The first sex. After you shot the cabbie."
Overall, they had good lives together, for the time they were in.
After Holmes passed, Watson maintained their country house and the bees, doing everything as he knew Holmes would. He lived ten more years before a heart attack took him.
But I want you to come /home/ SH
John cleared his throat. "How late are we for the appointment at this point?"
tags. He chuckled, realizing that his would actually look a bit more worn than the ones in the box, besides for the fact that these were thinner. He quickly put down the box and the journal, and examined the tags. "I thought these were mine for a minute." John bit his lip. "But this is loads better." John felt a small flutter in his stomach as he looked at the other man, and quickly looked away, pulling on the dogtags. "I'll wear them always." He swallowed. "This way, next time I forget, these'll hopefully remind me."
want you!" John looked up at Sherlock with puffy eyes. "And you know it. You know that I want you, so you know that if it works out just right, we could be together... If I get selfish... If I stop caring about
"I would not call that a suit." Holmes muttered under his breath.
John nodded and leaned into Greg, walking to 221B unsteadily. "I think..." He smiled and stepped away from him. "I think I'm good from here..." He leaned against the door as he pushed it open. "I c'n get upstairs m'self." He didn't want Greg there when he got back into the flat. He had a lot to talk about with Sherlock, and while it seemed that Greg knew a lot, he also didn't know that John had proposed... He probably didn't tell him everything after all, and this discussion with Sherlock was going to be a whopper. "Thanks f'r the drinks, the walk back an'..." He chuckled. "The pep talk."
"Your bed is still up there, as are some of your clothes. We kept it this way, because you always sleep alone on the first night, after an episode, so everything's ready for you."
"About the stupid letters, I mean." He chucked. "They were cheesy... I know you probably hated them ."
John rubbed Sherlock's hand with his thumb and whispered. "I love it."
Watson was doing his best not to react, since he knew that this was how Holmes thought best. Though it definitely could grate on the nerves. After nearly a half hour, he set down his paper. "Would you
John nodded into Sherlock's shoulder. "Okay." He pulled away, his face stoic again. "We'll talk about it though... It- it needs to be discussed."
It was a moment before John heard Sherlock's voice, a bit muffled, "Bedroom."
John groped around in the second cabinet, and smiled triumphantly when he found the box. "Got it." He showed it to Sherlock before taking out two bags and placing them in the teacups. He reached into another cabinet and pulled out the sugar, spooning a bit into each cup. "What was it like, the first time?" John asked. "I'm sorry I'm asking so many questions," he turned to face Sherlock. "I just.. I feel like I need to know."
"Shit..." John sighed. "Do you think she may have an opening later?"
"So are you working on a case now? Or is it downtime?"
"But I wake up and it feels like that when you forgot me, like I've lost a part of you again. What if you don't trust me one day? What if your amnesia goes further back and you'll forget completely about me?" He asked, shrugging, before he stood up. "I think we have to go to your appointment."
Sherlock listened and nodded, his expression softer than John ever remembered seeing before. "I never expected this, John." He said quickly. "At least not in your youth. That you tried after Afghanistan... That could have been expected. What stopped you...? Or were were found early enough?"
Because you're beautiful, mysterious, and you have, quite possibly, the most sexy voice I have ever heard. -JW
[delayed] Get me the rice. -SH
John sat down next to Sherlock as he blew at his tea to cool it a bit. "Yeah, the first time I forgot... I mean, this time... It's already happened six times now, so you're used to it... But the first time...?" He bit his lip and swallowed roughly to clear the tightness in his throat. "Did I punch you again?" He smirked as he took a sip of his tea, slightly burning his tongue.
John let out a shaky breath, and took a sip of his tea. "God..." He lowered his head. "I just... That must have been awful." He took another drink from his tea, breathing in the sweet smell. "What..." He didn't know how to phrase his question, so he just went with whatever came to mind first, "How did I... wind up in the hospital?" He looked down briefly, and then into Sherlock's eyes. "What did I do?"
(See the end of the chapter for
John chuckled and bit his lip. "Kinky." He took a swig from his beer and sighed. "S'not that I don' love him... I do, I really do." he paused. "But he d'serves more." He frowned. "There's nothin' t'examine, Greg. Sherlock said i' was brain damage tha' started the Ante-" He paused, the word all of sudden too big to come out right. "-Started that I can't form new mem'ries."
to just do that now that he only just found out that Sherlock indeed liked him back, on his side of things, at least. "Will you wake me up before I need to go to the doctor?" He frowned. "You said it was a she? What's her name?"
John led Sherlock into his small flat. "Please... don't mind the mess. I'm barely home."
John gets back to 221B completely drunk and tries to talk to Sherlock.
"I mean..." He paused awkwardly, trying to figure out how to put it. "I'm coming into this relationship with a blank slate..." He clutched the ring in one hand as he pulled the dogtags back over his head. "I'd feel better if we can start at the beginning." He fiddled around with the chain for the dogtags, opening it and sliding his ring on it. "I don't
So you're more like my doctor in a box. SH
John sighed. "No..." He shrugged and pushed off of the table. "Well, she does have a drinking problem, you've seen it." He paused. "But that's not why we don't get on." He sniffed nervously. "She found me with..." He swallowed, and noticed that his hands were shaking. He clenched them and laughed nervously. "She found me with my..." His voice rose. "Razors." He shifted on his feet slightly and swallowed. "I made her swear not to tell our parents, but-" He pursed his lips briefly. "They took me out of school and sent me to a ward for a bit." He rubbed the back of his neck. "I know she meant best, but still..." He looked down. "She'd promised, and I trusted her."
." He bit his lip. "I promise."
Greg... I guess we've done this before? I forgot, and I need... I don't know what I need. Can we meet? -JW
"I'm sorry, Sherlock." John closed the clasp to the chain and pulled it back over his head. "I really,
Because I do. SH
John smiled and said goodnight, glad to have someone in a similar situation as himself to talk to. He walked around the hallways a bit on his own before finding his way back to his own room. Before heading to sleep, he added a journal entry for the day:
It was a few weeks before the conversation was breached again.
John nodded quickly. "That might be best." He picked up his tea, now slightly colder, and took a long sip. "I don't want to forget again..." He said quietly. "I don't want to lose you again." His brow softened as he looked at the ring on the table, and he picked it up, examining it. After a few moments of silence, he tried it on, but found the feeling odd and slightly foreign. He pulled it off and put it back on the table, hoping he didn't offend Sherlock. He took another drink of his tea, and looked over to the other man. "How did I propose?"
?" John pushed away from the bed to peer down at Sherlock. "That's probably the worst thing you could have done! How am I supposed to trust you now?"
"But so much could happen, John. You could just forget to text me, I could just not get one of your texts, because I've got no signal. Anything could be wrong." He said with a sigh. "I have to live in current fear that I'll come home to find you dead."
Again, this is an RP that I'm polishing up into one perspective (even though there will be parts of Sherlock's perspective.) It's still a WIP at this point, so I'm posting this in chapters.
"There is no need for you to explain yourself or justify yourself. Really. It's quite alright. You didn't want to wear it, so It's fine." Sherlock was obviously playing down the hurt he felt, and John didn't know how to fix it.
John forced a smile and quickly turned away. He had been about to share that part of himself with Sherlock, but when he had thought he already told him... It shocked him, and now that Sherlock may not know... He swallowed and grabbed a cup from the counter, quickly putting it in the sink to fill it up.
JOHNNNNNNNNNNNN SH
Captain John Hamish Watson had been a doctor during the war in Afghanistan, and did his best to continue working the field after getting shot, but he was forced home due to his hand tremor. No one needed an invalided surgeon.
He couldn't help but sign it so formally. He half wanted to just sign it "Watson" and be done with it, but he kept in his first name. Before leaving, he called the clinic to quit. Thankfully he got the message machine and he didn't have to try and explain himself to Sarah or any of his other co-workers.
JOOOOOOOOOOOHN
He sighed deeply and rubbed his face. This was absolute madness.
John bit his lip as he nodded, feeling a rush of contentment at Sherlock's expression.
"Have you not heard a thing I said? He wouldn't go on and have a normal life. He wouldn't continue with his cases and save the world. He'd most probably start to take drugs again, slipping, he'd kill himself without you with the drugs and you know that."
Fine. SH
"I'm sorry, John." He said quickly, entwining their fingers with John's. "And I'm very glad that you like it."
I'll never forget you." He sighed and looked down, squeezing Sherlock's hand slightly. "I could never forget the man who saved my life."
a Doctor, maybe not a specialist in amnesia, obviously, but she understood." He said softly, sounding like he had said this all before, which was quite likely.
JOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHN SH
"I don't mean to be hard. But don't promise such things, John. You can't be sure." Sherlock smiled sadly.
"God..." Sherlock's words hit him like a sack of bricks and he covered his face with his hands. "God, you're right..." He muttered into his palms, "If I hadn't texted you..." He turned to look at Sherlock, his eyes tearing up, "You're right. " His breath hitched a bit as he started crying quietly, "I could have killed myself, and you-" He stopped, "-Oh God..."
... It feels off."

." He shook his head sharply. "I feel like an idiot... Nothing makes sense."
"John..." Sherlock turned to look at him. "Calm down." He breathed out again and sighed. "I won't put you in a ward. You'll get suicidal there, and I don't want that to happen. No."
Greg chuckled as he leaned forward to look at the ring. "That bastard. He didn't tell me anything! I thought you two were acting differently, but I would have thought you'd tell me. Well congratulations then. You're engaged to him. Do you really want to break this up?"
"I know, I know..." John muttered and lowered his head in his hands. "It's just-" He sighed. "I know."
He cleared his throat. "I was fourteen, and yeah, I was sent to a ward. My parents..." He sighed. "They didn't really understand that the worst thing to do is send your suicidal kid
"Me too." John leaned in, his eyes locked on Sherlock's. "I quite like you, Sherlock Holmes." His heart skipped a beat as he spoke.
"Well, if that happens, I'd probably wind up dead." John stood up as well and started towards the door.
John swallowed roughly as he finished reading the entry and quickly jotted down "16 June - Attempted suicide" on top of the list of numbers, and added "18 June - forgot in the morning. - 1 day" by the 1. He sighed as he closed out of the journal and skimmed through a few others, trying to find references to when he forgot. He opened up the entry from 30 June:
"I meant if I'd be stuck in a ward without knowing you're alive." He bit his lip. "If you'd visit though..."
Holmes's face soured. "That is a very rare occurrence."
When Sherlock got down the stairs, he hesitated and looked at Mrs. Hudson's door, but he remembered that she wasn't at Baker Street but visiting her sister. So it wouldn't make any sense to go in and explain himself, she would have to deal with his departure. Sherlock stepped out of the building, closed the front door behind him and took a deep breath. It felt strange. Just like two years ago, when he knew that he was leaving Baker Street. But back then he was sure that there was a chance of coming back, but right now, he wasn't so sure about himself allowed to come back at all. Sherlock had a really strange feeling inside his gut... That this was his last goodbye to Baker Street.
Captain John H. Watson had been a doctor during the second Anglo-Afghan war, and even though he had been injured, he managed to stick it out until his company returned to England. He returned with a medal for his service and a cane for his limp.
in my mind since I was a child."
He glanced at his phone on the counter before he shook his head and left the flat to finish packing. He didn't need that. He really didn't need it.
"In my nightstand. I put it there yesterday. Why are you asking? What are you planning, John?"
How on earth would I forget Sherlock coming back? -JW
John heard Sherlock's voice strain a bit, and he frowned, holding on to the chair for support. "I don't want to leave you... I just need to think." He bit his lip, not looking at the other man... His fiance. "I... It's just, I wanted you all those years from a distance, and I never thought you'd noticed... I didn't think there was a chance. And then you died, and now you're back, and all of a sudden we're-" He motioned towards his ring on the table, "-engaged, and I don't know..." He was breathing rapidly, starting to hyperventilate again, "I don't... know how to... react."
"Oi, don't look at me like that." Greg shrugged his shoulders. "You two were miserable. You were on my couch, crying without an end. And Sherlock? Well... He got himself to a drug den. Got himself a whole lot of drugs in order to be able to forget you. Mycroft found him early enough. Luckily."
The tall brunet continued playing his violin, his lips pursed as he stared back at John.
"Good morning, Holmes." Watson grinned at the bleary-eyed detective. "You seem to have missed out on some hours last night."
Bored SH
, John thought, but he gulped and nodded. "You deserve a normal life. A normal boyfriend, and I'm not that." Lord, he didn't want to break up with him, but he couldn't... He couldn't do this to him. "I can never love you as much as you love me..."
And because you can't chose who you love -JW
"That he's my best friend." He leaned his head against the bed. "You are, Sherlock. Even if you're my boyfriend or fiancé or eventually husband, you will always be my best friend."
Sherlock shivered slightly and smiled shyly at John. "That's good. I'm happy."
"Nothing! I-" He turned off the water and took a long drink. He looked at Sherlock briefly and pressed the cold glass against his lips as he turned his head to look away. "I just..." He sighed shakily. "That wasn't the first time I tried." He mumbled quickly and then pursed his lips, not daring to look at Sherlock's face.
"He..." John sighed and took another swig from his beer. "We..." He frowned. "I don't even know..." He sighed and looked down at the beer he was holding. "He deserves someone better."
"You need a bit of air, I know. It's like this every time." Sherlock sighed and lowered his head. "Usually you walk around and meet with Lestrade in your favorite pub to calm down."
"Yes, I know. But the last hours you weren't yourself and now you're starting to be my John again." Sherlock blushed and looked down.
What are you talking about? -SH
(See the end of the chapter for
John looked down briefly and then looked back up into Sherlock's eyes. "You've changed, you know..." He paused. "Since two -
He set himself up a small practice, and had a steady income, but he was bored with his life. He missed the war. He missed the action. Helping old Mrs. Kimberly with her arthritic tendencies was nothing on the excitement of the war. Of the battles. The rush of his blood at the sound of a gunshot. He needed more.
John took an extra large bite from the egg and put his fork down, thinking. When he swallowed, he turned his head to face Sherlock. "It didn't offend me... Not nearly. It just..." He paused. "It scared me." He looked down at his food. "It's just the reality of it all... The fact that I made such a big decision-and action- and that I forgot it."
Sherlock stared at the door where John had been standing just several moments before. He took a deep breath and pressed his eyes shut. No, no, no, he wasn't going to cry.
"Yeah..." He nodded slightly. "But I mean... I would be away from you." He swallowed. "And I don't think that would help in the least."
"You have the look of a lovesick puppy." Holmes said, stopping to play. "Who are you thinking about?"
Because you're Sherlock Bloody Holmes -JW
John! SH
He lived through his early childhood forcing himself to slow down, but once he reached his teens, he couldn't anymore. He missed Watson. He
"That's what I am, John. Childish." Sherlock shrugged his shoulders and moved back, leaning against the wall. "I'll go to my parents. Stay there. They'll keep an eye on me, so you don't have to worry."
And? -JW
"No, that's not what I meant. I knew that you wouldn't have a problem with me being gay, I knew that you'd never judge me for that, but I was afraid that if I was going to tell how about my feelings, you'd leave."
You read crime scenes, I read people -JW
Sherlock ducked his head and quickly packed up, practically running from the blond man.
If you wouldn't have said it, I would have carried on loving you and being angry at you for never saying it -JW
Sherlock closed his eyes, feeling relieved as he heard John leaving the room. He really didn't want to have to deal with a drunk John who would just tell him that he was going to pack his things and leave him, break up with him. He didn't know what a drunk John Watson would say, and he would rather deal with John when he was in full control of his faculties. Sherlock listened to the sounds coming from the living room and relaxed. He heard the footsteps coming out of the living room and he tensed for a moment, because he thought that John would come back, but the footsteps wound up going upstairs. Sherlock knew that he was being a tad unfair to John, that he should be nicer, but he really didn't want to deal with him when he was drunk. Most probably, drunk John would do something that sober John wouldn't approve of. Something like forgiving Sherlock.
"To be honest, I don't mind the violin as much as I sometimes act like I do."
John leaves Baker Street and checks into the ward.
John clicked save and ran his hands over his face as he reread the entry. Yeah, that was basically it. He didn't feel like it really encapsulated the feeling he had right then, but he didn't want to remember it if he'd forget. It wasn't a good feeling. He just felt betrayed. He sighed as he clicked out of it and looked at the long list of journal entries. There seemed to be a LOT. He checked and there seemed to be over 80 entries. Well.. Reading all of them was definitely out of the picture. He clicked on one at random ("Journal 10 July") and started reading.
"Okay, if you're sure." Sherlock shivered again as John touched his hand, particularly when he reached the spot where the ring had been. "It feels so odd. Without it, I mean. But I'll manage."
Holmes glared at Watson. "But? I don't see anything to change that. I care about you. You care about me. Why should we not be together?"
"But this is just- this'll be the only time." John swallowed. "One fell swoop." He sighed. "I'm not deciding against you, I'm deciding
I know my name -JW
Sherlock shook his head. "I had to live without you for so long. I know how it is to be without you. And even if you keep forgetting me over and over again, spending time with you is better. I just shut my mind down and ignore it."
Money is boring. SH
to me, Sherlock."
"It was your idea. When I came back, I found you almost dead, I brought you into a hospital. When you first woke up, you just stood up and punched me, immediately kissing me after. We had a very kitschy moment and talked about our feelings." Sherlock looked up and smiled at the Doctor. "Why I put up with you? Because this is not too hard for me to deal with. Because I have you. And because this is nothing compared to the loss you had to endure. It's like payback." Sherlock shrugged and moved closer to John. "And well, because I love you."
Greg shook his head. "Honestly, you're probably the biggest lightweight I've met. You usually just have a beer, but it
John deals with his hangover and the memories of the revelations, and Sherlock deals with John.
Sherlock brushed his fingers up John's cheek. "It's 2019, John. Men can marry men."
A separate three word phrase -JW
John. SH
John nodded. "I got it in October, yeah." He finished up his egg and stood up to put his plate in the sink. "Greg said that he found a few things of yours in the office, and brought them over to me." He stuck the plate into the sink and turned on the water, pouring a bit of soup onto the plate. "When was I supposed to have gotten it?"
Sherlock packed it into an envelope and closed his suitcase. He left the bedroom and looked around, trying to find the best place for the letter. Eventually, he placed it on John's armchair before taking his violin case from the floor near his own chair. He changed into his coat and put his scarf around his neck, checking to make the dog tags and the ring were still there even though there would be no reason for them not to be. He took a deep breath and then went down the stairs, leaving 221B for what felt like might be the last time.
John shook his head slowly. "But there is the question, no?" He chuckled. "Tennyson. 'Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.'" He sighed. "If I'd have had you and
I need my own life too -JW
John took out the journal and smiled widely. "This is..." He looked at Sherlock, a sincere expression on his face. "It's perfect." He looked back in the box and saw the dog tags. He tucked the journal in the crook of his elbow and picked the dog-tags up gently by the chain. "You..." He paused. "You kept them."
Sherlock sat down on the ground near John, facing him, and the doctor had the feeling he was watching to make sure he wouldn't have another panic attack. "If you don't believe me, if you need more proof, look on your phone. There are messages and pictures."
John pulled away, smiling. "A lot of punching from me..." He laughed as he kicked the covers off. "I guess you're lucky that this time I was to surprised to use a right hook." He stood up from the bed slowly, biting his lip and turning to face Sherlock.
"I don't want to, but I think it would be better so you won't be reminded every time you look at my hand, you know?" Sherlock removed the ring from his finger, quickly attaching it to the chain he was wearing around his neck.
Sherlock chuckled. "I am glad that this doesn't seem to change. No matter how often you forget me. You still like me."
John smiled as he heard Sherlock's key in the door. Kind old Mrs Hudson from downstairs had been kind enough to help him cook for this dinner. Their first date, of sorts. In this life, at least.
"Yeah," John said softly. "I am..." He swallowed. "You are as well, I take it?"
I faked my death. -SH
Why do you need me home so badly, then? -JW
the one who needs to leave!"
I added a paragraph to the last chapter, so yeah.

Sherlock's voice wavered, "Yes, please. A cuppa would be nice."
"Holmes!" Watson gripped his hands tightly, glaring at his friend. "Will you
Sherlock took John's hand and moved a bit, looking at the other man. "John... be honest. Don't think about me this now, only you. And then tell me are you really sure you would make it...?"
He poked at his egg with his fork as he bit his lip to stop crying. Why was he crying? It wasn't like anything specific right then triggered this... except the picture. And betrayal. He cursed and emptied the rest of his egg into the garbage bin and washed his plate quickly, leaving it on the drying rack along with his fork and knife and the pan.

They took advantage of out-of-London cases to take vacations together, though they always had to be careful to keep their attentions to each other restricted to inside their rooms. But they got by.
Haha. -JW
"It's wrong."
He got them a cab to Sherlock's "spot", and the taller man went out, retrieving his things. He wanted this. He would get clean without fuss if that meant he had another chance with his John.
"Stop it, now." He said, taking the empty glass away from John and glanced at the barkeeper for a moment. "You are really stupid you know that? You don't want to hurt him? You're a real saint, aren't you? Don't you realize that leaving him would actually break his heart? You know, that thing he keeps acting like he doesn't have?" Greg blurted out. "This would destroy him. And you know that." Greg sighed, taking another sip from his beer. "And why is it so unlikely that you would start remembering?"
Who is this? -JW
Sherlock looked up at John and smiled softly. "It's just you are so much better."
"It was pretty romantic. I wasn't able to deduce anything, you even made me cry." Sherlock admitted with a soft blush, clearing his throat again.
what he had wanted to see. Not at all. He was still trying to figure out a word to explain how he felt towards Sherlock at this point. Angry was way to rational and understated. Upset? Yeah right. Furious was getting closer, fuming as well.
. We don' like it." He smiled as he closed the door and stared up the stairs. They were a bit harder to scale than he remembered, but he made it up to the door to the flat without incident. He pushed open the door slowly, the room spinning a bit. "Sherlock?"
Sherlock got out from underneath the bed and stood up, stretching his back with some groans of pain. "Of course. I'll pack my things and leave as soon as possible, don't worry."
"Open it." Sherlock answered with a smirk.
John smiled sadly. "Things could have been so different, don't you think?" He shook his head slightly. "Just imagine it..." He suddenly felt a pang of sadness. "I probably would still remember you." He paused for a moment. "Or... not."
"You said a ward would make you suicidal. So even if It's just part time who can say that you wouldn't want to kill yourself when you realize that you're in a ward again."
am." He smiled sadly. "But otherwise it's just too... sudden." He fiddled with the ring on the chain, and held it out a bit. "I'm still wearing it, and when I'm ready to move further, it'll find it's way to my finger..." He stepped towards Sherlock. "Just not yet. Not today." He shook his head slightly.
Please. SH
"I did not." He insisted.
The doctor pursed his lips at that. Holmes had never called him by his Christian name. It was Watson or something even more formal than that.
John stumbled to the bedroom slowly, and squinted as he looked around. "Where're you?" He giggled. "You said y're in th' bedroom."
We can get paid for cases. SH
"Twice." John replied, blinking rapidly. "First time was..." His voice cracked, "I was younger. A jock found out I had a boyfriend and-" He took a drink. "And told the whole football team." He chuckled sadly. "It was hell." He cleared his throat and looked down at his cup. "That's why I... I don't really share that I'm bisexual with people."
John woke up the next morning at 6:30 feeling depressed, but he didn't know why.
What isn't there to understand? -JW
"If you consider to end our relationship, then do it now. Don't wait for a suitable moment, tell me now, so I can pack my things and leave." He announced, not looking at the other man, while he tried to remain calm. "You don't know if you're doing it over and over again. Maybe it was your last attack. The time between this one and your last one was longer than ever. It keeps improving."
John flushed deeply. "Sherlock, I-"
When he got back in the car, he reluctantly sent out a text to Mycroft to ask for his assistance getting into a facility, and for money towards it. His brother had always chased after him to get clean, so he knew he would help, no matter how many times he had pushed him away before.
"Do... Do you really think so little of me, John? I didn't take cases for the last while and we seem to be pretty fine..." He sighed. "You wouldn't ruin my life, but I'd ruin yours with putting you in there."
Sherlock blushed. "I love you too... God, stop it, you're making me blush."
DAHN DAHN DAHN cliffhanger
How old were you...?" Sherlock's voice was unsteady. "You were sent into a ward, into therapy?"

And he got more by way of one Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective.

The song was heart-wrenching. The song felt... familiar, too.

The flat isn't /being/ anything, it just /is/ -JW
Watson was sitting in his chair in the sitting room, reading the paper. Gladstone was at his feet, and snoring as he tended to.
He took the box from Sherlock and examined it curiously. "What is it?" He looked at the other man and smiled. "And apparently I'm not the only one who's forgetting things now..." He flicked his tongue out momentarily as he smiled, teasing Sherlock. This was comfortable. This was good. It felt... right.
John nodded, but made no move to stand up. "You're a good kisser." He smiled widely. "There's nothing quite like a first kiss."
Sherlock nodded. "Milk, one-"
*whispers*
Just got out of the tube station. -SH
While Sherlock was in rehab, John worked with Mycroft to find a safe flat for Sherlock, and by the time Sherlock and his treatment team believed he was sober and not at dire risk for a relapse, he was released. It took some discussion and arguments, but in the end, Sherlock agreed to living in the flat without John. As ironic as it was, they had to do it for appearances sake, after a life of doing just that.
"Then I make it look like we just met, that we just ran into each other. I don't know." Sherlock breathed slowly, obviously trying to keep calm. "A ward? Why would I put you in a ward, John?"
((Also, the texting is only an intro. There's actual action in the rest of the chapters))
Why wouldn't I love you, though? -JW
The man stopped playing, lowering his violin slowly. "John-"
"You were unconscious."
new memories!" His voice cracked as he spoke, "I'm just going to forget this argument, anyway, so why does it matter?" He sat down at the table resignedly. "How do I even really know that you haven't left before?" John laughed sardonically, "I don't know
"I am not going to let you kill yourself, John. I promise." He stepped closer to John, opening up his arms as an offer to John, and John smiled shakily, tears spilling over as he hugged Sherlock. Tightly. He held on for far over 30 seconds. He just held on, his face damp. There were no sobs emanating from his lips, but there were definitely whimpers. "I'm sor-" John pulled away suddenly and swallowed roughly, wiping his face. "I'm sorry. That was..." He breathed shakily. "That was a bit much, I think."
He headed up the stairs from the underground, hearing strains of violin waft down from street level. That was a horribly beautiful song. He got to street level and his eyes fell on the performer. Clearly homeless. But oh, so handsome. He stood there, mesmerized with the performance. He listened for a few minutes before pulling out a few pounds and dropping it in the artist's violin case and continuing on his way.

For not saying something in particular -JW
John frowned. "It took me a while, but I got some sleep... I've had better nights, though." He turned the picture-frame so that the back, and therefore the post-it was facing Sherlock. "Who's idea was this?"
"That's
Sherlock turned and grinned at him impishly. "Don't worry, John. I'm going to wash myself off. It's been a while since I've taken a good shower." And with that, he disappeared into the bathroom.
John stared at the screen a bit. It was disconcerting to read his own writing without any memory of writing it. He scrolled back up to the beginning of the entry and squinted his eyes. "Eleven days since I forgot now." That would make it 6 November when he forgot that time. John bit his lip as he thought for a bit and stood up quickly, holding his laptop in one hand and grabbing a pen and paper with the other. He sat back down on the chair and scribbled out the numbers 1 through 7 - Sherlock had said that it was 6 times before this that he forgot, making yesterday number 7. He checked the date and wrote down "18 December" by 7 and jotted 6 November in the corner. He shut the journal entry and opened up the first one he had written, dated 20th June.
I'll go to Sarah's and annoy you there. She'd love you for bringing along your mad flatmate SH
John took a deep breath and rubbed his face, trying to figure out exactly
But I'm pretty sure that you can behave that way enough -JW
Forgot what? -JW
Sherlock nodded without hesitation. "I was prattling off information on the shooter to him. I didn't know and I stopped as soon as I noticed it was you, but he looked at you and sighed. I think he knows. But I think he would have done the same, and he knew you did it to protect me."
Sherlock lay back down, his voice soft. "Yes, see you tomorrow. Goodnight."
I have a whole lot more, but I'm taking a break from polishing it up... Another chapter should be up soon. Probably once a week or something.
As he was falling back to sleep, he felt a soft peck on his forehead and a squeeze of his hand.
John ran his hands over his face, breathing shakily. This wasn't possible. It was completely mad. He felt a knot in his throat, and he shook his head quickly, trying to clear it. He rolled his mobile between his palms and sat down in his chair slowly, glancing down at it as he felt it vibrate.
"Nah, man, that's cool... That's why you're here, you know?" Pete stopped walking and motioned to the door behind himself. "This is me."
When Sherlock came into the bedroom, their bedroom, his own bedroom, he closed the door and nearly collapsed against the wood of it. He sank down and just let the tears come freely. He allowed himself to cry like this because he know he needed it. He knew that he destroyed their relationship by lying to John, but he didn't understand why John wasn't able to see it was just to prevent him from any pain. Sherlock took a deep breath, before standing up again, continuing to pack his things. He didn't actually notice what he was packing he just sort of threw some stuff into the suitcase. He didn't care. He just wanted to snap his fingers and heal John... Fix him... Make it so that that he would be able to go upstairs to sit down next to the other man and fall asleep together. "No," Sherlock murmured to himself. "Shut up." But the thoughts only continued to get louder, pressing in around him and telling him that John would never return.
But he didn't know him.
SHERLOCK! -JW
"Then the decision's made. You're going back to Baker Street. I'll say it again; I won't allow you to break up with him and even if I have to handcuff the two of you together." Greg said, taking out his wallet to pay the bartender before he downed his beer. "Ready to go?"
John sighed, rubbing his thumb against Sherlock's hand. "Christ, I'm sorry..."
John smirked and bit his lip. "I'll bet..." He chuckled as he pulled out a pot and poked his head in the fridge, looking what supplies he had. "Is an omelette okay with you?" He turned to the other, still holding the fridge open. "Or would you rather something else?" He paused, and slowly closed the fridge behind himself. "Or... would you rather cook?" Supposedly he liked Sherlock's cooking now... he may as well offer to try it, for Sherlock's sake at least...
Sherlock sighed. "Me too. Unbelievably so."
... -JW
"Why am I crazy? It's the truth. You're warm and caring and lovingly. You're calm and loyal and good. You step into a room and everyone looks at you. You smile, you make a joke and everyone falls in love with you."
John quickly reached his hand up, turning Sherlock's face back to look at him gently. "You'll never lose me, Sherlock." He swallowed. "Don't you understand? I may not remember everything about you, but I am always and forever
What? -JW
gah I love drunk John
"Jesus, John. How did you even manage to get through med school and the army with that alcohol tolerance?" Greg got him out of the pub and supported him as they walked slowly back towards Baker street.
Sherlock just shook his head to all three questions. "I am not hungry." He stated, leaning back on his chair and watched. "And you don't know about my cooking. You're always worried that I might mix food up with experiments, even when I moved everything to 221C... But no, I don't want to cook today. You're not certain you'd want it."
Until Holmes got sick. Influenza. It had been covert for longer than it should, and by the time they caught it, it was too late for anything Watson could do for him. All he could do was ease his way.
Sherlock tilted his head and leaned into John's touch and locked his gaze with the other man. "But...I'll be able to visit you any time, right? You're able to come home, whenever you want to. And you won't hide things from me."
I'm asking nicely. SH
"You said that last time, John." Sherlock cut him off, "And I'm through with that nonsense." Sherlock cupped his cheeks gently. "Captain John Hamish Watson." He smiled softly. "I love you. I love everything about you. I love your smile. I love your voice when you just wake up. The way your voice gets just a little bit lower when you say you love me. The way your eyes sparkle when you talk about medicine..." He brushed his thumbs over his cheeks. "I love your limp, when you have it, and I love your tremor, even if you don't." He swallowed. "I love you, and I don't want to spend another moment apart from you."
"But I
"Yes, obviously not when you're half-asleep. At least do me the favor of eating a proper breakfast, Holmes?"
"Oh!" His eyes widened as he remembered. "Right... You, uh... You found me after... I tried." He coughed, trying to cover his slip-up.
." He spat out the last word as if it were detestable.
John's brow softened as he sighed. "I don't want you to have to change your life around me..." He frowned as he took another bite, now halfway done the egg. "I know how much you need your work, and I can't bear being the reason you aren't doing as much."
You can have one. Tomorrow. SH
"Are you sure?" Sherlock asked, locking his gaze with John's. "You could just stay here and maybe get another hour of sleep."
one more word -JW
Holmes smiled from his seat in his chair, working on the strings of his violin with resin. "I know that, Watson."
Sherlock smiled widely as he nodded and moved his hand to reveal John's dog tags he had under his shirt. "I never took them off. They're around my neck for every day since you gave them to me. So I thought it would be only fair if you get one with my information on it."
John looked up quickly, his eyes red. "I-" He swallowed. "I can't do this to you again, Sherlock." His voice cracked and he stood up, everything spilling out, "I can't have you live with someone who doesn't know you.... You deserve better than me." He felt warm tears start flowing down his face. "You should just put me away and let me think you're dead." He sniffed and wiped his face with the back of his hand. "You should find someone new... Someone who could love you back like you deserve." John's breath grew short as he started crying... Really crying. "You... You should have just let me die... You would have gotten over me, and you would have had a normal life." He swallowed and turned away from Sherlock, kicking the leg of the table. "You shouldn't have
John stared at Sherlock for a few moments. "I love you too, Sherlock..." His voice shook a bit. "But we can't. If anyone knew..."
Sherlock grunted and turned over, looking at John. "Too early."
Sherlock smiled softly and took John's hand, giving it a squeeze. "You won't lose me."
John ran his hand down the side of Sherlock's face and kissed him gently. "Tell me about yourself." He smiled. "All this time I've been asking about me, and I have hardly thought to ask about you." He lay himself down next to Sherlock gently, his hand resting on his chest. This felt so right.
"Read then. Watch telly. Whatever." Sherlock sighed again, taking a deep breath. "I don't want to talk to you when you're like this."
So, are you sorry? -JW
Anyway, yeah.
Sherlock shrugged and looked down. "You were mad st me for taking a case and not caring about you. I didn't want you to be mad, I wanted to be there. It's fine. I... I need you more than the cases." He said hesitantly.
John shook his head and swallowed roughly. "It's easier this way." He said flatly, and looked up at the bartender to ask for another beer. "This way it won't be a constant." John snorted. "Am I the
"So it was disturbing you...?" He asked, looking at his now ringless hand.
I have work, Sherlock -JW
I came back half a year ago. -SH
"Wind up dead...?" Sherlock repeated with a frown.
Sherlock was nowhere to be seen. John frowned as he glanced around. "Sh'lock?
John nodded tightly. "I'm heading upstairs... I'll see you tomorrow?"
"First time you tried...?" Sherlock repeated softly, looking at John with a confused expression before he exhaled an 'Oh'. Sherlock took a deep breath and cleared his throat. "When was the other time...?" His voice was hesitant.
Happy now? -JW
But you forget that over and over again. -SH
John nodded, looking down. "I..." He looked up, meeting Sherlock's eyes. "I think..." He said slowly, barely meaning what he was saying, "I think we should..." His voice descended into a whisper, "Go for a walk..." He bit his lip. "Get some air..." He swallowed. "You know?" He still hadn't looked away from Sherlock's eyes.
John brought the tea over to Sherlock and handed it to him before sitting down in his own chair. "You're- um." He cleared his throat. "You need a place to stay."
John closed his eyes, savoring the moment, and then pulled away slowly, his hand still on Sherlock's face. He rubbed his thumb along the other's cheek. "I don't need sleep. I feel like I've been asleep for all these six months."
Sherlock. -JW

John sighed happily, and reached down for Sherlock's hand. "Thank you." He smiled sincerely and squeezed the other's hand. "It's perfect." He paused for a moment, and shrugged slightly. "Even if it is two and a half years late."
"Oh!" John smiled widely as he realized that they weren't actually
John smiled. "I would like that." He paused. "But I meant the ward... If I were to be in a ward, I wouldn't be with you. And the next time I forget..." His voice cracked and he swallowed, looking at the wall without blinking. "I don't want to do that."
need to-" He pushed the door to Sherlock's room open and saw that it was empty. Sherlock had gone. John cursed under his breath as he stepped back into the sitting room and paced around a bit. It was then that he noticed the envelope on his chair. He quickly picked it up and ripped it open, sitting down slowly as he read. He didn't know what he wanted at this point, honestly. He just knew that he couldn't look at Sherlock. He couldn't bear it. He didn't want to
"I can come with you. To your therapist I mean. I won't come into the room, but I can stay in the waiting room, if you want me to."
John shook his head roughly and took a few deep breaths, forcing his breathing to get back to normal. "I'm fine..." He shook his head. "I'll be fine." He raked his hands through his hair, and looked at Sherlock pleadingly. "I'm sorry you have to go through this again." He threw himself back down in the chair. "I'm sorry..." He shook his head and rolled his eyes at how he was sounding. "I'm a fucking idiot... I've been to war. Why is this so much harder?"
John shook his head, staring up at the ceiling, feeling the headache slowly recede. "If anyone's going, it's me, Sherlock." He felt his chest constrict and reached up to play with the ring.
"But don't you see that this here is putting me through much more pain than any attack would be able to? This is you deciding against me, when you forget me it just...happens." He breathed out again.
Sherlock tilted his head and furrowed his brows. "You did get the video only in October? That was a bit too late."
(don't get used to it... Eventually I'll get caught up to where we're up to in the RP, and you're going to have to wait.)
John and Sherlock speak over breakfast, and Sherlock gives John a gift... Which leads the doctor to accidentally mention something he had been hiding.
"Why not? It's calming me down and keeping me sane at the moment." Sherlock shifted under the bed, turning his back to John. "What do you want? Go to your bed and sleep. Take an aspirin. You'll have a hangover tomorrow."
"Make it... What do you mean?" John tilted his head, slightly confused.
"Maybe I got inspired by one of your emails to your former girlfriends. I used to log in to your account and I've read all of them." He chuckled as he sat up, leaning his head over to John.
John paused and put down his fork, turning in his chair to face Sherlock. "Do I make life that interesting?" He smiled slyly and bit his lip. "That you don't get bored now, I mean?" His smile eased up a bit as he said, "Or is it the condition that keeps the boredom away?"
John chuckled through his tears as Sherlock described his "normal" life, and sniffed, wiping his face with his hands. "I don't

amnesia. Meaning there's an issue forming and keeping new memories. Everything from before the incident that caused this is safe." He blushed, "Including my crush on you..."
John swallowed. "Attempted suicide."
(I just realized that I should probably tag angst.)
"But it's not yours either. You are just telling me that I need a normal life, that I need a normal partner who loves me more than you are able to do, without knowing that you are the most perfect man for me. The only one I want in my life." Sherlock sighed as he started to pace around the room.
"Well, you were the only think keeping me alive for that year and a half... And then when you were gone, it was only the reminder of how I felt when you left that kept me going. I didn't want to do that to the others, though it got really hard near the end." He ran his hand over his face. "If the last thing I remember is coming home from-" He cleared his throat. "I wouldn't be able to do it." He sighed. "I mean... now, I knew you already... So your showing up and telling me that we're together isn't that big of a leap... It kept me from trying it again." He bit his lip. "However, if I wouldn't know you to begin with..." He looked down and swallowed roughly. "I was in a bad place then... and if someone were to show up and tell me that we'd been together for a year or something, and that I had forgotten 5 years..." His voice cracked, "If there's an actual edge to sanity, I think that would push me over, most definitely."
, because I knew you before." He leaned back on the counter, folding his arms. "I just don't know
John bit his lip gently as he tilted his head. "I am only getting to know you this way now..." He whispered, "Of course I'd be shy." He leaned in again, slower this time and kissed Sherlock again. This time, he stayed for longer, savoring the taste. He loved him.
MORE UPDATES
John took another bite as Sherlock spoke and motioned to the egg after he swallowed.
"I have no idea." He smiled and leaned in, putting his hands on Sherlock's shoulders, pushing him gently downward. "I just know that I don't want to leave Baker Street." He kissed him gently. "I don't want to leave you."
He met Holmes in the morgue of St. Bartholomew's hospital. He had been visiting an old friend who was now teaching in the very school he himself had learned his trade, and he mentioned to Stamford that he was looking to move to a better neighborhood, since his business had improved in the recent months.

For not saying it sooner? -JW
John snapped his laptop shut, his lips pursed. He threw his laptop on the bed and took a few deep breaths. Sherlock had lied. Again. He had said 6 times. He had said they were happy. John didn't even know what to think at that point. He was just fuming. He felt like if he were to go downstairs, he wouldn't be able to control himself and would probably physically assault Sherlock. John clenched his fists angrily as he stood in the center of his room for a few minutes, thinking. After a short while, he shook his head and yanked his door open. He didn't care what he was going to do to Sherlock now. If he knocked him out, honestly, he deserved it. He stormed downstairs. "Sherlock!" He called as he slammed the door to the flat behind himself, "You

romantic." He chuckled and sat down next to Sherlock, still making sure that his legs touched the other's, savoring the physical contact. "I think you missed your calling as a poet."
"I already did when I tried to kill myself." John stared down at his now half-empty second beer. "There's no way this could work..." He took another long drink, aiming for a buzz to take the edge off. "I'm a fucking invalid, and I can't do that to him..." John looked back up. "I'm gonna check myself into a ward so I don't bother you..." He took another drink. "All you have to do is keep Sherlock away from the drugs until he gets over me."
