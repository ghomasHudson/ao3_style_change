“Immediately.”
Sherlock moved out the shadows into the small office.  Molly was hunched over her desk, filling out paperwork with the most lurid pink, fluffy pen he had ever seen in his life.
“John,” Sherlock said, standing up straighter.
“It has to be, who else has-” John stopped. This was why they did it, so that John could experience the same “Got it!” moment as Sherlock did, albeit at a slower pace.  And what a moment it was.  Because if it wasn’t Sherlock’s that had
messily far too quickly.
That he was going to keep deliberately
Practically, it needed to withhold being hurled across the kitchen with some of Sherlock’s more explosive experiments, so too much plastic was out.  Bright colours were out too- their kitchen clashed enough without adding polka dots or striped appliances into it.
) and either the chase would begin or Sherlock would sulk all day about the lack of imaginative crimes until the process repeated itself the next morning.  If no people emerged then it was up to emails and texts and badgering every known detective at Scotland Yard, and if
“Hey.  Yeah, no worries.  Sorry.  I was just going to say something’s come up, so I’ve got to cancel on our plans.  Sorry it’s late notice but-” he gestured towards his door and backed away towards it.
The laughing stopped.
The rainy afternoon slipped into a clear night and John’s eyes started to protest at the attention he was paying the screen.  It was when his mouse hand had gone numb from the lack of circulation he realised that if he did not move soon, he may never move again.  When he stood up to wander round, he just stopped himself from falling straight over, as his legs had decided to go to sleep and his joints seized with the inaction.
The coldness of his room couldn’t dissipate the crackling energy he felt, flowing through his fingers and toes.  He sprawled out on his bed.
He thought of this and other times when he was at his worse, reminded himself of how much he adored Sherlock, how much they'd worked to make this possible, reminded himself that it was all worth it.  That didn’t stop the nightmares though, the very real panic as his brain supplied images of what Moriarty would have done to him, his friends, to Sherlock-.  It was at this point he normally woke up, the sight of those pale eyes staring blankly at him, lifeless still imprinted into his mind until he could find the real Sherlock again, either curled up next to him or out in the living room playing his violin, alive and breathing.
“Patience is a virtue.”
“Hi, everyone!”
, John thought, smiling too.  Working together made his life easier, and who knew, maybe they’d be friends by the end of this.  He glanced up and down the road, the questions about the case still rattling in his head.  There was no doubt Sherlock would work it out but there was no harm in thinking about these things.
"Exactly."
“I need you to find someone for me.”
Sherlock huffed.  “Fine.  But you’re telling Mycroft.”
“I can’t go back to the Above.”
“And you know, stop the apocalypse from happening.” Sherlock shrugged.  A secondary concern but if that’s what it took for them to get on board.
A few weeks went by.  Many began to drop out, believing it was one question that would never be answered.  However, a few braver and steadfast participants decided to carry on, thought their attempts were often short-lived and unsuccessful.  Many began (and ended) like so:
Mrs Hudson merely sighed like this was something that happened a lot.  “Oh Sherlock, you haven’t told him?”
“About me?”
It had been Tuesday and John was lying on the sofa because, for once, Sherlock was not occupying it for his mind palace and, although he’d never admit it, John was curious about what the fuss was all about.  He may have fallen asleep as he awoke to Sherlock sliding up next to him, nuzzling into his neck, an arm wrapping around his waist, and really what else was a man to do when his gorgeous boyfriend sighed sweetly in his ear and whispered to him what he wanted doing to him.
“So, what’s on your mind?”  Friendship also included small talk apparently, which was a difficult on two fronts.  One, John was not great at small talk but Greg already knew this and considered these questions a training ground of sorts.  Two, how to explain that most of his thoughts had been taken up, in some way or another, by a mysterious Fallen that swanned about in a long coat and kept on turning up in the same places John happened to be.
Don’t think about it.
as Mycroft put it.  It turned out there would be a person sat in between them.
.”  John looked two seconds away from storming out the room and punching the older angel in the face.  As much as Sherlock wanted to see that however and as happy as he was for dodging the blame, he wanted to keep John to himself for a few moments before his brother inevitably came to split them up again.
Annoyingly, Raz’s eyes softened into understanding.  “Yeah, I heard what happened.”
People didn’t quite understand John Watson and Sherlock Holmes relationship.  They couldn’t care less, so long as they had each other, and the light, paper and pens.
There also seemed to be a weight pressing down on him, pinning him to the bed.  What the hell had happened last night?
So John did what he always did when his mind tricked him.
“Well there you are then.  Such a nice man,” she said, as if that settled everything, as if the entire universe would bend to the word of a Senior Guard and the will of his landlady.  Although, if he had to pick one person the universe may consider listening to, Mrs Hudson would be high up on the list.
He was still telling himself this when he couldn’t move out of bed the next day because his core muscles had seized up.
“Only,” John said, turning as he reached the bathroom door to lean against the door jamb, “I seem to remember you telling me about a dream you had.”  Sherlock could feel himself blushing deep red but John wasn’t finished.  “And I’d quite like to see how it plays out in reality.”  Here he winked and slipped into the bathroom.  Sherlock heard the sound of the shower starting up but was still in bed, stunned speechless and apparently motionless.
The receptionist glanced between him and Lestrade, who simply nodded, resigned.
Sherlock grinned as he appeared in front of him and he smiled shyly back.  It took a minute, for him to get a feel for the rhythm, the push and pull of the song.  Once he was there he started to dance.  Slowly, maybe not as fluidly as Sherlock, but dance nonetheless.  It was easy to believe this was a private space, that it was theirs, which made it easier to relax.  No one else mattered really, each drawn in to their own dramas.  The beat shifted, slowed.  More people joined the floor, so they moved closer together.  Just a step.  And another.  A nudge made John stumble forward and Sherlock caught his elbow.  Dragged his hand across his forearm.  Slipping across his hand.  Fingers briefly interlocking before falling.  His hand was left tingling, sparking.
Apparently the Committee of something-or-other was holding a Ball or a Banquet or something else exceedingly dull to congratulate or commemorate a thing, and the only part that mattered was that both Sherlock and John had been invited.  Well, less invited and more their presence was mandatory to keep an eye on the proceedings.  All this was enough to make Sherlock nearly cry with boredom but it was only when he found out the event would be happening in Kent, rather than in London, he flat out refused to go.
“Yes!” Sherlock hissed gleefully.
and you can stay on the case.”
“It’s nothing.  Seriously.  Just been having nightmares again, that’s all.” John tried to make it sound casual, hoping Greg would leave it.
“Look Sherlock I can’t just allow you to waltz whoever you like into the scene-”
“N-No sign of him on the other side.  Van parked across the end of the street aaaaand- drives away, gets lost in the traffic through here and disappears.  Dead end.  As expected,” he gave the keyboard a shove and thought about hitting the computer as well.  Fucking useless.
How he hadn’t noticed it before was beyond him.  Perhaps staring at them for so long had made his eyes immune to them, skipping over them like so many parts of his route.  Perhaps the lure of coffee had blinded him to all else.  Now he had noticed it, he went through his mental checklist.  Sherlock would be proud if nothing else, and it was a way he could justify the trip.  Practical re-con or something.
Yeah, they were sweet Lestrade decided.
was amusing to watch.
Raz nodded.  “Sure I-”
“Do you think Gladys killed him?” Sherlock interrupted.
John felt the same mix of curiosity and exasperation from their first meeting, this time tinged with a pleased note which he was doing his best to ignore.  He walked over to block the doorway, which was ridiculous if the room had windows, but it was the best he could do to secure the Fallen and to a lesser extent the arm.  The Fallen looked up, as if to yell at someone, before he spotted that it was John.  Because he didn’t want to think the Fallen looked happy to see him, because that made it sound as if John was expecting to be recognised, all John would allow himself was the acknowledgment that the Fallen didn’t look as if he wanted to yell about someone anymore.  This should not have made him as happy as he did.
“John.”  Victor winced.  How could one voice contain so much relief, so much happiness when it was tainted with so much hurt that it sounded broken?  Hell, John had only been missing for one morning; Victor couldn’t imagine what would happen if something worse was to ever happen.
“You can just call me Lestrade,” said the angel, on reflex, before registering Mallory’s grave expression.  “What’s happened?”
“He was being polite.  He’s the sort of person who’s polite.”
“Different handwriting.”  Sherlock tilted his head towards John, keen as ever to hear his attempts at observation.  Both were stood nearly leaning on the wall, John not daring to risk either of them moving further into the room, Sherlock using the vantage point to sweep for objects of interest.  “The writing up until now has been fairly similar, small variations, but this,” he pointed.  “This is more…slopey.” God he wished he was better at words.  Sherlock nodded charitably.  “If we could find out how many people are tagging, by using their handwriting, we might have more of an idea what we’re up against.”
“You were handing out body parts?” John jumped in.
The only indication she had to put effort in was the twitch of her muscles and the sweat.  Her face remained oddly calm, pure focus driving her every move.  It was strange to see the usually docile Molly looking so...lethal.
On the other hand, his options were severely limited and it was four in the morning.
.  No, he was irritating.  Look what dedication and fondness did for you.
“Oh no.  That’s not what I meant by not friendly, I mean sure it’d be nice to get a decent conversation now and again but I don’t think anyone’s malicious, or at least I don’t know of anyone-“
“Found another one boss!” said another, holding Sherlock by the scruff of his neck like a naughty puppy.  Sherlock looked distressed at the havoc it was wrecking on his suit.  Then his focus honed on the man stood between them and his eyes lit up.  Of course now he has a fucking deduction to make.
“Can you show me?”
Besides maybe his case work would be improved with a higher level of fitness.
Lestrade sighed.  “Apparently pressure makes him turn to melodrama.  But that is the long and short of it.  John’s gone missing and we think it’s linked in the case we’ve been working.”
“How do
“Look, I’ve said before, I’m always-”
“There are a million tells you are military: the hair, the stance, the way you hold your wings.  But guard-duty means you are no longer in active service.  When this lot were going to stay put, you went to put up your left hand but winced and quickly shifted to your right.  Your shoulders are tense and there’s no other obvious sign of external injury, so left shoulder injury.  You really
Neither of the Holmes’ spoke. There was at once too much to say and too few words to express them.  Mycroft’s eyes never left his brother though, as if he would disappear should he look away. Sherlock’s gaze was fixed out the window, tracking the streets as they slipped away.
“Honestly?  Be you.  I mean that’s who he asked out after all.”
Sherlock stood and stared for a few moments at the scene before him.  John knew that he must look slightly mad, his clothes askew and his hair plastered to his face.
So, without thinking too much about it, he thought about Sherlock, thought about their near-kiss, what it would be like to kiss those soft, full lips, and allowed the energy to creep up his toes to his knees, his hands to his forearm.  Knees that had knocked together, a forearm which Sherlock had caressed.  The feel of his hands on him, the fabric of his clothing the only barrier.  Now sparking with gorgeous, heady energy, expanding over him.  They would be soft kisses at first, so gentle, fragile, but building, growing bolder.  He could imagine pushing him up against a wall, licking into his mouth.  All so strangely human, so grounded.  Running hands through his hair, curls slipping through his fingers, like their fingers earlier.  Moving one hand down to stroke through his wings, Sherlock’s strong hands on him, Sherlock moaning, all his senses narrowed down to this glorious focus point, their energies meshing together, pulsing with light, and he was drowning in it, drowning, and
Victor was already waiting for him, leaning against a broken phone box outside the building.  The area felt vaguely abandoned, with several of the shops either shut or in need of refurbishment.  Litter was scattered across the cracked pavement and the sound of sirens was never far away as if the place was in a permanent state of emergency.  Victor didn’t seem to fit in with the image.  Crimes however, did.
“One has to take all the small pleasures life offers us Sherlock.  Now, unless you’d like to spend the rest of your life in my spare room, I suggest you open your eyes so you can begin.”
“Not yet,” John teased, and he resumed his exploration of Sherlock’s body, sinking lower and lower.  Sherlock bit his lip as he imagined that mouth around him instead of kissing his hip, trying to stifle the needy sound.  However, frustratingly, John kept going lower, sitting up and resting back on his knees so he could lift Sherlock’s leg up and kiss the inside of his ankle.  He tenderly made his way back up, pausing at the places that made Sherlock whimper the most, small abortive thrusts thwarted.
“You’re kind of proving my point here John.”
obvious?  There was no mistaking his expression.  He was in love with whoever was behind that camera and it was then that Sherlock decided he’d had enough of patience.  Was this why John was avoiding him?
“By proving you were in fact breaking and entering in another part of town.  You still had to go to prison,” Sherlock corrected, as he did every time.
“Yes.  Fine.”
“Unlikely.  I can see-“
“Wh-” Victor was perplexed. “Why wouldn’t he be worried?  You up and leave without telling him and then don’t come back?  Anything could’ve happened.”
Climb the stairs, up, up, up.
They only realised their problem when they met up in the hallway to make their way downstairs.  Sherlock, as usual, looked effortlessly suave in black, form fitting suit and crisp white shirt.  The only change to his look was he had let his hair run riot a bit more than he liked, as he knew John loved it.  John, however, looked nothing like himself.  A world away from the jumper he had been sporting earlier, his body was wrapped in a grey three-piece, white shirt and, unlike Sherlock, a navy tie.  It was this last item he was still fiddling with as he exited his room.
“On the way?”
“Well I’ll be crying if we stay here for much longer and trust me I’m worse to deal with.”
He was glad of the darkness. Even at this late hour, the city was still a myriad of noise and light but the tinted windows dulled it to a faint buzz of sound and flashes of light. In his absence, alleyways and bridge arches had become his friend once more.  Secluded, dingy, no questions asked. Simple. But his precautions had come at a price and now his first instinct was to shrink back from the exposure of the window. He was too much of a target in the open and there was too much at stake for him to risk it. Apart from now the threat had been eliminated. Here he was, back in his City that he has missed, pined for, wanted so badly it was like a physical ache in his stomach.
John nodded, desperate to right this.  “Okay.  Good to know.”  Sherlock nodded once and then went to curl up in his chair.   Tension still hung in the air though, in the way Sherlock had turned his back, in the locking of his muscles.
Unfortunately he was not the only one watching.  Because of Sherlock’s annoying habit of taking whichever laptop happened to be closest, John was often left to scrounge for wherever the other had been chucked.  This time it was under the sofa,
Sherlock stopped just outside the library building’s doors and turned to see a familiar brunette grinning and jogging towards.
“Not really.  You’ve been avoiding me,” he accused, innocently looking up through his lashes.  It was John’s turn to look at the floor.  It was a shade of rough-faded beige which he hadn’t noticed before and he had to say, looked particularly awful.
And run they did.  Straight into someone waiting at the opposite end of the alley.
Mike shrugged.  “I wouldn’t say handing out.”
From the way Lestrade opened the door and let them fall out onto the pavement, he was not feeling the same
“You’re making this up.”
1) Thank you for the great comments- you are all the best :D
Where the hell was he?
in his training gear.
Instead Sherlock's pupils were blown wide and his jaw was slack as if he couldn't believe what he was seeing.
? “good.  You know, still working things out but good.”
John glared at him and added, “Fine.  No tea for you,” before marching off in the direction of the student’s cafe.
This was the reason why 10 minutes later he was sprawled out on his living room floor play wrestling with the stupid ball of fluff.
“Tease,” Sherlock accused, his lips pouting.  John just laughed at him softly, and kissed him, licking into his mouth and sucking on his bottom lip.
“I don’t know.  I’m thinking of taking an image of someone, monochrome it all, and then pick out the distinct colours in it? Prove it’s not black and white at all?  I don’t know, it might to be too cliché.”  To avoid saying anything else he shovelled more pasta into his mouth.
“Hey you,” John said, eyes not leaving the page but a hand running up to ruffle Sherlock’s hair and pressing a kiss to the top of his head.  For a moment Sherlock let himself soak up the sweetness of it.  However, as John continued to only partially pay attention to him, it was time for some more direct action.  He began by slowly moving his hand across John’s stomach, ostensibly to cuddle closer.  Then, he moved his hand up and down John’s side, rubbing his head slightly.
“An admin error?” Lestrade asked suspiciously.
“Why?” John jumped in.
Sherlock cracked an eye open.
“Oh whatever,” John sighed, making Mike laugh.  He’d never hear the end of this one.
Raz looked upset at this revelation.  “Yeah, well they’re all twats anyway.  And I won’t anymore.”
John felt like his heart had stopped dead, somewhere in his throat if his difficulty breathing was a judge.
didn’t work then the experiments would start up.  John could honestly say every day was an adventure.  And every few nights, when the cases weren’t forthcoming or Sherlock was thinking which meant he was formally dismissed, he would climb the stairs, pretend to go to bed, change into his black body gear and steal out the window.  On the rare occurrences Sherlock noticed his absence, he feigned ignorance and said that Sherlock probably didn’t realise he’d left.  It worked perfectly.
B) Lestrade having someone to watch the football with and complain about life to.
“They’ll be handcuffed obviously.  Can’t imagine they’d be walking free after yesterday.”
“From you?” he asked.
,” Sherlock said, running his hand from jaw up to the base of his skull, tangling up in the hair at the nape of his neck.  He rested his forehead gently on John’s.
This kiss was thrilling.
"Okay then as in let's see if I can be promoted to friend."
“I could say the same thing,” Sherlock replied smoothly, trying to focus on the knot, rather than using it to pull John in closer.  When he finished he tucked the ends into John’s waistcoat and admired his handiwork.
When he'd imagined this moment, briefly, always briefly, he'd thought of the two of them lounging in their chairs beside the fire. The room was only lit by the mellow colour from the flames and the small lamp on the side table. It was quiet and peaceful, each person content. Their feet were dangerously close to touching, always pushing the boundaries of personal space. John would smile at him and get up from his chair. He leaned over and there would pause for a brief second before their lips touched.
“Look at you being so generous.  Ooh, what is everyone’s in on it?  Like in a spy film when everyone files out and it’s just the hero and villain left?”
And anyway what did she even know about dating?  Apart from that date she went on.  He’d never found out who the mystery person was.  Then again did it really matter?
“It means
And then John smiled.
The major thing bothering Sherlock was the fact they didn’t bump into each other like they use to.  For a few weeks it had felt like he couldn’t move around the university, around London even, without accidently coming across one John Watson.  Now however there hadn’t been a sighting for days, not even on the corridor they both lived on.  This was what made Sherlock think he was being avoided the most.  Not texting might have been a mistake.  This was active evasion.
“It seems to be a symptom of Fallen’s moving through a portal.  Not a well-known by-product but pertinent none the less.”
No. “Yes.”
Sherlock shrugged but made a mental note to warn real-John when they found him.  It wouldn’t do to save him from certain danger only to have Lestrade murder him straight afterwards.
John was confused by this.  “But we know it’s Faber,” he said.  Then a thought occurred to him and he took a punt.  “Wait, do you think it’s twins?”
Sherlock took the time to observe Jake.  Medium height, slightly longer hair than average but nothing extravagant, innocent-looking brown eyes, pleasant to the customers but there was a shy resistance to small talk.  In other words there were no distinctive traits that would lead anyone to assume his life was in imminent danger.  Perhaps this was simply his natural state or possibly by design.  After all it was much easier to move around when you knew people would forget you after a few weeks.  It was obvious he’d moved to the flat recently and, with his few possessions, it wasn’t a giant leap to imagine he’d moved around before.  The question was why he had to move around in the first place.
“Completely,” Sherlock said with some pride.  It had taken less time than he thought to return the kitchen to its previous state of distress.  Mrs Hudson was going to be livid.
“John.”
“I know!  Crazy huh?  So, as you will see, this is not my fault.  Also I want a compliment on my deduction skills.  And you haven’t said hello yet,” John smiled, secretly adoring the look of confusion on his boyfriends face.
“When’s Mrs Hudson’s birthday?”
Fists clenched.  One foot after the other.  Find the faux-river.  Watch the storm clouds roll in.  Stomping footsteps and a rolling stomach.  Don’t think about it.  How
“Tried and tested.  Wouldn’t have got your hopes up otherwise.  Now, come on,” he said, pulling Sherlock’s sleeve so he was stood directly in front of the portal.
“Thank you,” he said automatically (and since when was the automatic?) before his brain registered the start of the sentence.  “Wait, fine with what?”
Yep, that would do it.
“Nice to see the Guards have finally admitted their reliance on guess work.  Does help lower people’s expectations.”
“Genuine question.
“-But you think it’s something similar.  Something you can do at a party or other inane gathering, something you can be given?”
“No one was going to try so they would have been fine anyway.  This case is time-sensitive.”
“You said you owe everything to me.  Your affection shouldn’t be the price for that.  I don’t want you to feel obligated to love me.”
John wished to protest that only one of them ‘stropped off’ but instead simply said, “We just talked.  Get your mind out the gutter.  We’re just flatmates.”
“What?!”
“Sherlock, in a way, revealed his true gender under his own volition.”
But there was still the pressing question of John.  As had proved the case throughout the investigation, the issue of his flatmate and object of the unnameable feelings swirling through his mind was the only thing that could finally make him move.  The text had said ‘home’ so home was where he headed.  As he approached the front door, the image of Mrs Hudson, alone in her flat, appeared and he clenched his fists tighter.  He was worried about John, terrified something had happened to him, but logically Sherlock knew he was a fighter who had been to war, an angel with powers to protect and defend him.  Mrs Hudson was plucky, yes, and handy with a kitchen knife, but human nonetheless and for all her talk of being careful, was as prone to run head-long into danger as her tenants.
“Just flatmates my arse,” Lestrade said to him quietly.  He was clearly struggling not to laugh.
Sherlock didn’t want to smile.  However there was a certain comfort in the consistency that was his brother, even if that consistency was constantly being an arsehole.
He came moaning into John’s mouth.  He gentled his kisses but continued moving his hand until Sherlock stopped shivering and collapsed into his pillows.  He was vaguely aware of John’s hands caressing his sides, and his weight shifting to swipe at both of them.  A duvet was brought up over him and he grabbed onto John’s wrist, managing to open his eyes and say, with a hoarse voice, “Stay.”  John shushed him with a kiss and a reassurance he wasn’t going anywhere before sending him to sleep by playing with his hair.
“Molly?  Hi, it’s John, I was wondering if Greg was in?”  John almost smiled at Molly’s nervous introduction; it was nice to know that some things hadn’t changed.
Sherlock turned to him, suddenly serious.
Kitchen?  No.  Bedroom?  No.  Upstairs?
“Thank you. Thank you so much Sherlock, seriously, I owe you.”
“Fuck off John,” Lestrade said good-naturedly.  He sighed.  “It’s too early for this.”
He took a deep breath and reached out.  Aura colours were always a bit temperamental and the tension in the room was an overwhelming navy layering everything.  He ignored the tumult of Sherlock’s emotions next to him too with another breath.  Mr Holmes was his focus.  His disapproval was clear, as was his doubt over Sherlock’s play.  Other subtler emotions were a mess and John cursed his lack of power.  He couldn’t think about that too long however.  Change what he could; hope that it would be enough.  Emotional changes were difficult as it had to be done without the subject being aware of being changed.  First he began slowly , so slowly, drawing back the scepticism.  However, the doubt had to be replaced with something so he began talking.
Raz just winked.  “Didn’t need to.  Right, I’ll see you later.  Or maybe not.  Just talk to the man for me won’t you.  Tell them I’ll be good as anything.”
“The database would flag up if someone wasn’t meant to be here, it’s why we have it in the first place.  Plus the taxi company would eventually flag up Faber had gone rogue, they would have been trying to contact him about jobs.  They needed to become these people, live their lives.  Solitary people would be targeted meaning someone from inside is helping.  As for staying here, I would suggest something bigger is on the horizon that requires their presence here.”  Here Sherlock’s eyes caught John’s calculating something.
“You drove me to it you know.  And that Greg is such a lovely man, you should be nicer to him.”
Slowly, he stepped down the stairs, assessing the terrain, the two tracks silent.
Sherlock took a deep breath.  “He’s going to be fine,” Sherlock repeated, reluctantly.  He had to believe it.  There was no other option.
“Lust in the moment is not equivalent to love John.”
.  Lestrade did not even try and hide his eye roll.
“What?” Sherlock asked, distractedly, trying to look under the seat without touching anything.  It was a strange angle to be holding a conversation at.
Lestrade winced.  “Oh no.”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes and tilted his head, reminiscent of cat, but he didn’t look
The first workout, with the endlessly perky Victoria, was brutally paced but mainly billed as cardio mixed with weights.  This, in contrast, was ultimately slower, based on focussing tightly on muscle groups which ironically made it high-intensity.  The aim was for people to use their own body weight rather than rely on weights so naturally there was a lot of push-ups, sit-ups, and planks.  Glancing around Sherlock was fairly sure he should not be shaking as if a magnitude 6 earthquake had hit his mat but despite his quivering he was not going to give in.  Not while John was watching anyway.  God his muscles hurt.
“That must mean Greg took it instead.  Good, hopefully he’ll buy a suit jacket that fits.  And he’s right by the way, it’s a much quicker route.”
Since that first lecturer the boys had sat next to each other in most of the lectures and practicals, exchanging notes if they couldn’t talk.  Victor lived with his family in an area of London that wasn’t too bad but not terribly great either.  Both his parents were veterinarians and he had an older sister who was a waitress and a younger sister still in high school.  Much more importantly to Sherlock however, was the fact that Victor enjoyed mysteries and not the stupid ones that were on TV all the time, but actual mysteries that happened to actual people.  None of the people Mycroft had picked would talk to him about mysteries.  Victor therefore reinforced Sherlock’s view that the other people were idiots and so was Mycroft.
Well how could he refuse that?  It was lucky the bed was only a few feet away otherwise they would have never made it.  John began by kissing him once more, making it brief but filthy.  Sherlock was gasping at the end as John trailed biting kisses down his neck to the buttons on his shirt.
It was all fucking fine.
John kissed him quiet and shifted his weight so he can push an arm down between them.  “Quiet now,” he says, resting their foreheads together as he wraped a hand around both of them.  He dragged his hand up and down a few times, spreading their combined pre-come and making glorious friction.  Sherlock knows he’s babbling, knows he’s making no sense, mixing “oh” and “John” and “please” and “yes”.  John moveed his hand as quick as he can in the limited space and Sherlock’s back with that heat built up in his abdomen, growing and growing in intensity.  Everything around him is John, his smell, his taste, his heat, his noise, everything, everything and he can’t hold on any longer.
"One was taken before the robbery, one after if that helps."
Often when he was drowsing between sleep and wake, not yet awake enough to pretend to be above emotions but not dreaming either, Sherlock thought of all the moments since the start of term, thought of the way his life was almost perfect now.  Yes, things were pretty fantastic indeed.
“None.  I met him, yesterday.”  It struck him again that he really didn’t know this guy he was moving in with.  “Why do you care?”
.  So Sherlock did the adult thing.  He started to get drunk.
“Oy!  Come here you-”
Despite everything that he knew before about the possible murderous-intent and the rebellion and fall, it was this smile that made John hate Raz.  Just in a split second his emotions changed from ‘Whatever’ to ‘I would like to send him back to the Other Place in a damn box.’  He didn’t get to smile.  He was in Guard custody.  Unsurprisingly, John’s restraint on these new-found emotions were about to be put to the limit by what happened next.
“Because I’ve just spent ten minutes talking about how much I love you, that’s why,” John said, frustration bleeding through.  “What I meant is that I shouldn’t have kissed you without explaining properly.  About the wings situation.  It’s just-”  He struggled for a moment and looked out, towards the lush garden.  “When you said I love you, I just wanted to pretend for a bit.”
Anyway, all this is to say, it was Friday.  By this point, Sherlock launching himself through the door with a sense of urgency was not unusual.  It was also noted that normally he stalked off to his room, or the kitchen, or threw himself over the sofa and didn’t speak on such occasions.  Despite this,
So here it is, the final chapter! Thanks to everyone who's commented, you're all amazing, and so encouraging :) To everyone reading, I really hope you enjoy this chapter.  As a thank you for being patient while it was written, it's nearly double the previous chapters at 5,500 :P
“I won’t let you,” Sherlock said, hands shaking, eyes narrowed.
“I should probably get to work.  Just lock up the room, I’ll clean up.”  And without waiting for a thank you she ran out the room.  John looked at Sherlock.  Sherlock looked back and shrugged.  They both turned back to the screen.
Sherlock pursed his lips for a second.  “I was concerned about the motivation for your actions,” he said haughtily.
“Oh, I didn’t say I trusted you.  Just that I don’t think you’re capable of a war crime.”
not see it, you that tells everyone in the goddamn universe to simply look closer?”
To his housemates, Sherlock Holmes was fairly easy to pin down.  Not easy to be around by any stretch of the imagination but he wasn’t as mysterious and brooding as he liked to pretend to be.  No one could deny he was smart (there was a reason he was at Cambridge after all), his tall stature could be quite intimidating and he wasn’t known to spare anyone’s feelings while on a deductive streak.  However there are things you cannot keep from people who are the first people you see in the morning and last you see at night.
Sherlock looked a bit sheepish.  “Fine, I concede the point.  But I have never, not once in my life thought of a pink elephant,” he declared grandly.
"Oh, for God's sake, Sherlock. Just take it." She moved across the kitchen and yanked open one of the drawers, then pulled out a zippered plastic bag. "Here. You can put it in your coat and it won't leak on you. Just ask him. Okay?"
“John, are you okay?”
“Really? That’s not what people usually say?”
“Uh yeah sure.” John said, walking to the front of the class. “Hi, I’m John Watson, and I just moved to London last week.”
Luckily, John’s parents agreed on Sherlock’s family staying in their house. Sherlock’s parents, and Mycroft (Sherlock’s brother), got the living room, and Sherlock could share a bed with John (John had gotten a double bed when they moved, he liked having a big bed).
So, that afternoon, after going by John’s house, they went on to Sherlock’s house, to work on some experiments. John didn’t really approve of everything, like, Sherlock actually had real eyeballs, and he PUT THEM IN THE MICROWAVE! But most experiments he liked, and he really enjoyed himself. He had to go home for dinner though, so he couldn’t stay too long.
“Here, you can read it for yourself.” John’s dad said, and handed him the paper. The murder scene ended up being only five minutes away from the Watson’s home.
John also missed sleeping next to Sherlock. He thought he’d be glad to have a bed to himself again, but instead it felt empty and cold. He just wished he was back in London, and with Sherlock.
“Did you just cum?” the doctor asked. “I didn’t give you permission to cum.”
John’s hand had travelled up the detective’s thigh and was now fully covered by the soft cloth of his shorts. A simple movement was all it took for him to reach under Sherlocks’ boxers and grab hold of his cock.
Fumbling with his keys as he ascended a couple of steps outside of 221B Baker Street, he entered the building and took the flight of stairs leading to the flat he shared with his boyfriend. Trying not to make much noise as to not to alert the landlady that he was home, Sherlock hoped that Mrs Hudson would not find it necessary to come out and bother him.
“You always want more,” John teased.
Manoeuvring his other hand between Sherlock’s legs as well, John managed to slick up a few of his fingers with saliva.
John didn’t even make it a full half an hour before he was under the blanket.
“Keep your eyes shut. I have a treat for you. I’m sure you’re going to like it.”
Biting his lower lip, Sherlock trembled as John pushed one of his slippery digits past the ring of muscle.
The clap it made echoed against the walls of the room. The detective heard it before he felt it, the sting. And it did sting. So much so that it brought a tear to his eye.
John was stunned by the intensity of Sherlock’s gaze and the rawness in his words. It was about one of the hottest things he’d ever experienced.
“A horror film!” John pointed out for about the fourth time.
John took note as he switched to rubbing that firm bubble butt beneath his hand. However, he did not stop verbally degrading the detective.
Sherlock doubted he had ever heard a more beautiful phrase in his entire life.
Sherlock moans were starting to turn into small broken sounds and his mind began to race. “
Basking in the sensation, Sherlock was almost startled when John smacked him once more.
Pulling the soap from the wall-mounted dish, John glided the slippery white bar across Sherlock’s round cheeks; repeating the motion until the detective’s ass was covered in suds.
The way John'ss fully articulated the ‘ch’ sound at the end of bitch sent a strange twinge up and down Sherlock’s spine. Sure, there was an element of pleasure but also one of fear. It was utterly delightful.
“Okay,” John relented, finally.
Oh, no. He was not going to get to play the alpha tonight. John had already determined this and let him know with his reply. “Nothing, bitch. Now shut up and watch your stupid film.”
Humming appreciatively, the detective was once again quick to comply.
Whether or not he was asking for relief or continual punishment, John didn’t seem to notice and continued his with his fucking and the dirty talk. Either way, Sherlock hadn’t used their safe word so the meaning behind his pleas did not matter.
Obediently, Sherlock stood and watched as his lover gently glided the shower head over his chest, his arms, his abdomen, his upper thighs, and, finally, his aching cock. But this last bit was excruciatingly brief and over far too soon as John pulled the nozzle back and directed him to turn around.
“Yessir,” Sherlock replied.
The detective’s eyebrows shot up in surprise. Ever since Sherlock confessed that a bit of submission made him weak at the knees, he worried that John would be disappointed in his partner. Instead, the doctor took it in stride and he and Sherlock had been dabbling in the world of dominant and submissive role-play on occasion. However, the detective never imagined his boyfriend would actually get up the courage to take the lead.
“John, stop,” Sherlock pleaded as he tried to slide from his boyfriend’s grip.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Wait?” John replied as he reached further down and grasped the detective’s cock. “Wait for what? Is my bitch going to cum from a few spanks and dirty talk alone? Or do you want me to help you along?”
Sherlock whimpered, eyes flickering between lips and eyes, unable to choose one.  He leant up to try and capture John’s lips in a kiss but John moved back with a soft laugh.
Sherlock wanted to hit him.  “And you never mentioned this?”
All this is to say that when a strange, cute, blonde boy turned up at their door, the last thing they expected was for him to ask to see Sherlock.
“I’m sure you’ll be able to work that out.  Now answer my question.”
“Why not?”
That being said, John would admit the flat looked better for having a Sherlock in it, more complete somehow, and he grinned when he saw the angel perched on the far chair, wings folded neatly and tight on his back, knees tucked up so his feet balanced precariously on the seat of the chair.
Because this was it.  Once he handed over the paper, he would be able to find his own answers.  He’d never been afraid of a question before.
He moved into the centre of the room to give the space a chance.  It was a bizarre room, messy probably with the previous occupant’s things, but not off-putting.  Victorian wallpaper, the darkness of which should have made the room claustrophobic but which made it feel cosy, like a den.  Two armchairs, mismatched, one squishy, one modern.  More tables than necessary, coffee table by the sofa, square one by the windows that seemed to be partially desk, one by each chair.  A mantlepiece above an actual fire had a random collection of things, a skull for one which was strange considering
It was because he had to find out how Sherlock had done it.
,” he said incredulously, his shoulder falling.
“It means you’re lucky your brother was there to help you.  And that sometimes things really are just bureaucratic errors.”
“Look, what am I supposed to say?  ‘Hey Sherlock, so, weird thing but I dreamt you were horribly tortured by a dead madman.  Pass the sugar.’  Not exactly the best morning conversation I’ve ever had,” John let out a breath.  “I can’t put that sort of pressure on him Greg, not now that he’s finally happy with his life.  He’s got his classes, and his friends, and a case, and
“Six months ago, I leave to attend to urgent business in the mortal realm-”
Sherlock could tell where John’s thoughts had gone.
Not an easy question to answer when he was certain ‘investigating crime’ would not go over well.
His phone was on the table next to him.  8:33 am.  Excellent.  10 and a half hours to go.
"So you mean to say that all that time I've spent trying not to flirt with you has been wasted because you were also trying not to flirt with me?"
However, like Sherlock, John had realised that avoidance was the best possible way to prevent any possible non-platonic behaviour.  Platonic John would have talked to the pleasant, pretty woman who was sat next to them and so he did.  Every time he looked at her he could see Sherlock behind her though and that was distracting, so he ended up doing a weird thing where he would glance up, get distracted, glance back down at his food, feel rude, and so the cycle went round.
“No thank you,” Sherlock replied in mock-politeness.  “So, you know victims, where and how.  Why do you need me?  Surely even this isn’t outside your realm of possibility.”
Yes, this chapter is late but more plot! More domesticity! More swearing (not sure how that happened)!
sometimes,” Sherlock said, turning towards him with a smile.  It was such a lovely smile.  John felt his own lips twitch in response.  Then he remembered he was probably smiling because of Victor.  The sick feeling came back.
“Hey.  You should think of a career in the secret service you know.  I saw you back in the library, looked down for two seconds to grab my phone and then you were gone.”
“Your photography,” was a surprise opening sentence.  He hadn’t realised they had been taking notice.  “It’s good sweetheart.  It’s really good.  And you obviously love it.  So I was thinking.  Maybe, if you felt up to it, you could get a qualification in it?  That might help make it into a career for you yeah?”
Eventually, he plumped for a sleek black thing, that didn’t look like it would buckle under the rigour of chemical burns and wouldn’t be an eye sore.  As he was wandering around, looking for an exit to the kitchen section which seemed to have expanded to the size of a galaxy, with signs that contradicted themselves tying him up in knots, he noticed a mug with an anatomical bee on it, labelled in old-time handwriting.  He didn’t think too much about it as he snagged one for Sherlock.  After all, it would be good for him to have at least one mug that hadn’t been used as a chemical mixing pot, and something about the idea of it sitting next to his own mug, detailed with the war-healer emblem, made him smile.
“Yes.  It’s him.”
The kiss was perfect (all of John’s kisses were perfect) but the angle was not.  Kissing your boyfriend should not require physiotherapy after for neck strain.  John gently nudged Sherlock until he was on his back and then a thrill ran up Sherlock’s spine as John straddled his waist.  He gasped as the kiss deepened and he knotted his fingers into sandy blonde hair, pushing up into the solid weight of him.  Without breaking the kiss, John pulled Sherlock’s shirt tails out of his trousers and snaked a hand under to caress his chest and abdomen.  The sensation of the soft touches mixed with the bruising force of the kiss was heady and electrifying, a complete relinquishing of control.  John gripped his waist and moved down to bite kisses onto Sherlock’s neck and fuck that felt good and…
“Oh shut up.  What about you?”
She dropped the makeshift weapon and started to smile before actually looking at them and scowling.  It wasn’t clear whether it was from concern for them or for her lab.  “What is it?”
“Technically it’s her flat, you’re just renting it out.  Plus she has to live underneath you and all your goings on.  It’s a wonder she’s lasted this long without ringing in for reinforcements.  Just be glad it was me she called and not your brother.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Don’t you judge me,” he whispered and then shook his head.  Was he going hysterical?  Why?  It was just the dog walker, here to walk the dog.  Completely normal.  Should he have tidied up more?  No, John had been here before.  He’d probably seen it in a worse state.  Oh no, that can’t be good.  What did he think of Sherlock?  Did he think he was a responsible dog owner?  Did he like the flat?  Were the experiments too much?
“Such confidence,” Sherlock said, rolling his eyes.
“Couldn’t hack it anymore.  Said you were driving her crazy with all that banging and crashing about,” Lestrade shook his head, imaging only too well what havoc had occurred.  He was suddenly quite thankful that he had the option to only deal with Sherlock in case-mode.
“Be weird if we hadn’t heard anything, it being so close,” John pointed out and Sherlock smiled at him.
He spent the first few hours in Sherlock’s company tense with worry about when he was going to piece it together and wondering what the hell he was supposed to say in response.  Hopefully he could stay in the flat for a little bit, it really was better than his bed-sit, and he was fairly certain Sherlock was not the type to blab to the papers.  But instead what happened was they ran around London on a wild chase that sparked the same feeling he had while on his ‘outings’ (he refused to call them missions, there weren’t any orders from on high, just coincidence and good timing).
“Peachy,” came the dreamy reply.
Sherlock was so focussed on the task of getting John out of the restaurant and onto the nearest flat surface that he didn’t even stop to be annoyed at the knowing wave and wink Angelo gave them as they raced out of the restaurant, although a small part of him thanked the universe that his bill was, as ever, waived by the owner.
It wasn’t John’s idea to have sex on the sofa.  Again.   The fact he went along with it was surplus to the argument.
Without a word Sherlock walked towards the lifts and John wondered if he’d heard what he’d told the elder Holmes.
He braced for an attack.
“Thought you wanted my hands,” John said, and Sherlock opened his eyes to see John watching his face as his hands coasted down his chest, his stomach, until they hit his cock.  Instead of stroking him however, John’s hands coasted to his inner thighs and over his hips.
“Yes you are.”
“No squatters, no rubbish, no graffiti.”  The three tenants of the abandoned building.  “This place is literally a blank canvas.”
“Handsome bastard,” John muttered, dropping the tie as Sherlock stepped closer.
“You alright?” John panted at Sherlock.
Sherlock’s mind finally,
Several things happened in that second.  Guards crashed through the barriers and appeared at the upper level of the station, above the platform.  Moriarty stepped backwards with a look of shock freezing his features, as if to run.  Sherlock stepped forward to intervene.  But before any of them could do anything, John swung round, hands raised.
.”  Here he visibly shuddered.
“You live a tube ride away.”
Sherlock made a noncommittal noise, so John took out his phone and tapped out a text.
, “a brilliant brain.  Actually the blank background is a good idea, so bring your face over here where the light’s better.”  John nodded over to where the door to the tiny kitchen was propped open and the natural light shone through.
“No, I was just going to say thanks for doing this.  Hope it wasn’t too horrific,” he laughed uneasily.
A few things happened in quick succession.  Jack lunged at Sherlock, grabbing a pen-knife from his pocket before he sprang.  Both John and Sherlock noticed this.  Sherlock froze for a second before jumping away and bracing for the sting of the cut.  However, this didn’t happen.  Instead, Jack was sent sprawling as the full force of ex-army Captain, current fitness instructor, and the possible love of Sherlock’s life, John Watson slamming into him and restraining him on the floor, knife clattering uselessly to the ground.
There were roughly four streets between Angelo’s and Baker Street.  This was somehow far too long, and they only made it halfway down the first street before Sherlock felt himself being dragged sideways into an alleyway and pushed up against a wall.  John’s hands clutched his hips and a knee pushed his legs apart as he hungrily kissed Sherlock.  Surprised but not to be outdone, Sherlock pushed back, twisting his hand into John’s hair, the other running over his jaw.  John moaned and pulled back panting.
He spent a few moments trying to calm his breaths and closed his eyes. The memories that were hazy cleared in light of this new information and John finally understood what had happened last night.
Sherlock did not want to admit to being a shallow man.  He was not a shallow man.  Intellect was as striking as handsome features.  That being said...
.  John didn’t know if he wanted to stare at him forever or rip the suit off him right then and there.
“We have to start again?”  He didn’t intend to sound so crestfallen.  At this proximity it was impossible to not notice Sherlock’s eyes soften.  They really were quite lovely.  Even if he was looking at a complete moron who had managed to fuck up the biggest investigation he had ever been allowed on.
He was beautiful.
Sherlock shrugged.  “Bit obvious.  Mysterious disappearance?”
“Yep,” Sherlock replied, his peripheral vision locked onto a pretty brunette already eyeing up John from across the foyer.
this guy?
, but all that meant he could damn well listen to music as loud as he liked thank you very much and Sherlock had no right to tell him otherwise.
put John in danger.  More danger.  It didn’t help that every time he tried to think and push his mind forward, his brain would flicker to images of John, of his hair, his eyes, his laugh, his smile, seeing John sat in his chair, in the morning making tea.  Static noise.  Too distracting.
In all honesty he hadn't really had anything in mind.  All this was a lot further than John had ever thought he would get.  One idea came to mind however...
Sherlock’s only acknowledgment of his arrival was passing him a pair of gloves from the depths of his pockets.  He may go rogue sometimes, but prevented anything from compromising the investigation.
“But that’s impossible?”
Mycroft and John seemed to stay locked in a silent argument for another moment.  However, John was the one who relented, slumping back into the sofa.  He also removed his arm from round Sherlock’s back which was inexcusable.
“Council?” Lestrade asked.
you promise to fully reform your ways-”
The club owner and the two henchmen.  Everything stood still for a second.
The Fallen sighed.  “I was given it.  You’d be able to tell that if you actually looked.”
“Sherlock, why am I here?” he asked, for once hoping for a straight answer.
He groaned, swung himself up and his legs out of bed in one motion, having to pause as the blood rush made him dizzy.  The walk to the bathroom was not one of his most elegant states but he managed to stumble in and turn on the shower.  As he waited for the water to heat up, he leant his back against the small patch of free wall space, and took himself in hand, panting as the room steamed up and he stroked himself lazily.  Slow and light, only teasingly, but enough to stop the skin crawling feeling of unattended arousal which was humming through his groin.
“You are going to be the death of me,” he said, his head dropping dramatically back onto the pillows and Sherlock laughed.  There was a rustling and then Sherlock’s breath was in his ear and his weight was back on him his barely contained arousal began to spiral again.  John moved his hips lazily in time with Sherlock’s thrusts and their combined precome meant the friction only verged on painful.  He was babbling a mixture of “yes” and “like that” and “so beautiful” as Sherlock’s breathing became more and more erratic, their thrusts quickening.  John twined his hands around the bedpost for more leverage and Sherlock hissed slightly as the new angle dragged in a different way.
And it was that look that had them arguing about the third moment.  Sherlock still maintains he had no idea what his body was doing, how it had drifted closer until he was stood in front of his best friend.  But that term didn’t seem to fit him anymore.  John was
This kiss was
“Is this because he wouldn’t bring back that poisoned plant for you?  Because as discussed, it was highly toxic, and you aren’t a part of the force.  What we are doing now is following a lead.  Like proper detectives.”
“Yes, because repeating the name really does help me remember this thing I’ve never heard of before.”
“Yeah course.  What, none of you thought to ask me so I never said,” Lestrade shrugged at Sally’s anger.
Mycroft left shortly after that and Lestrade and Molly retreated into the kitchen to eat their dinner. Sherlock considered continuing to rage against the unfairness of the situation, but he knew it could be worse. They'd be at Baker Street tomorrow, and once they were home he could get around Mycroft's security measures if the need arose.
"Go see if Donovan's found any more fingerprints for you, Anderson," Lestrade said. Anderson grimaced but disappeared back into the flat without argument.
"Go show that unqualified technician out there how to hack the Crawfords' phones so we can see if there's anything useful on them."
"Are you doing this with your other clients?"
"You've been focusing pretty hard on this case." John plucked another apple from the bowl on the worktop and rinsed it under the tap. "Sometimes that makes it easy to overlook the obvious."
"His shirt got dirty," Sherlock said.
Sherlock didn't reply—maybe he really was able to ignore her. He'd written her out of his head completely for over three decades, after all.
Sherlock and Rosie both called out to greet him when he entered the flat, but neither got up from where they sat on the floor near the Christmas tree, which had been erected in its usual spot in front of the window behind Sherlock's chair. They had a half-dozen tubes of gift wrap spread out around them and seemed to be in the middle of—oh, that was what had happened to the empty ornament boxes. They were wrapping them to use in their decorative displays. Clever, but then John expected no less from them.
"It's all right," Sherlock said. "Are you okay?" He'd never known John to react so emotionally to a patient or to a crime scene.
"No need. You'll be on your hands and knees, not breathing in my direction."
Sherlock was still sitting in his chair in the living room. John assumed he hadn't moved at all since he'd left, though he did look up questioningly now.
"I thought you'd be taller," Sherlock said. He'd never stood this close to Moriarty before, only seen him at a distance after he was arrested and tried for his crimes all those years ago.
John opened his eyes to glare at him, then tightened his hand around Sherlock's cock and began to move faster. "You can't do it. You can't be quiet, I know you can't."
"Why are you afraid of what you're feeling?"
"No, probably not. She'll always be a step ahead of me. But I'm trying to find out where she's been."
"I thought he was supposed to be locked up forever in that secret prison I'm not supposed to know about."
Eurus's lips pursed for a moment before she answered, though not the question he had asked. "I got tested after I knew for sure I was pregnant, and again at 24 weeks."
for all your help with this fic. And thank you to everyone who has been reading and commenting along the way--you kept me writing even when it seemed like I would never be done!
"It's from a different IP address," Sherlock noted. "What's it say—oh, you've got to be joking."
Sherlock spun around, wondering what Mycroft was on about. Mummy, Daddy and Mrs. Hudson had all appeared in the living room and no one was making any sense at all.
"John was a much more effective assistant, Mummy."
John could hear her soft exhalation of awe, then she spoke, quietly, as promised. "That my baby sister?
"Her name is Eve," Sherlock said, without moving from the purposefully casual pose he held in his chair.
Sherlock wrinkled his nose. "You'll have to get past Mycroft's guards."
"Hmm." Sherlock cracked his neck and swung his arms a few times, trying to stretch out the stiffness. "Wait. Molly. You don't think—"
John glanced up at him, surprised. "You don't have to do that."
John was silent for a moment, then said, "You fantasise about me not being paralysed."
"I don't remember that. How do you know?"
"I didn't put it near her, don't worry. I just needed it to be as far away from me as possible. And if I went into the bedroom to get it and saw her, I thought maybe it would stop me.... " He trailed off, swallowing.
"No, don't." Sherlock reached the doorway and fought with his coat until he managed to sit, leaning back heavily against one of the fans from the hospital's ventilation system. "We want Mycroft's people here first. They'll ask fewer questions." He pulled his own phone out and tapped out a quick text.
"And yet you've had time to shower, and John's had time to make a significant contribution to the disaster that is your kitchen table." Mycroft sniffed. "Congratulations, John. You've now lived with my brother long enough that you've completely abandoned your own standards of kitchen cleanliness and adopted his."
"Sorry, what?" Sherlock swooped in and squeezed between John and the swing, putting his hand on the button to stop its motion. "Jaundice?"
"Moriarty. And wedding rings. This case is way too personal."
—John suspicious of him and other Homeless Network members and would react poorly if he discovered their involvement
He made himself unclench his jaw and moved to sit down on the sofa, close enough to Sherlock that their legs almost touched. He wasn't sure exactly what he was supposed to do. Just sit here, and be a friend? Had his presence alone kept Sherlock from getting high in the past, without John even realising it? "So, erm. Do you want to...talk about it?"
"Yes, you can."
He closed his eyes and swallowed. A bit not good. Sherlock had only been trying to be kind, by letting him borrow the shirt. He would doubtless be appalled if he knew the direction John's thoughts were taking as he wore it. He had accepted that his life with Sherlock would never include everything that he wanted it to, and he shouldn't let himself fantasize about anything more. But maybe it would be okay if he didn't rush upstairs to get changed into his own clothes. Maybe he could let himself enjoy this feeling, even if it was only for a little while.
"Oh, Stony, hang on, just a minute. Let me get it out of the bag for you at least." Mrs. Hudson tried to push the dog out of the way, but John had to pull him back so she could enter the flat.
He reheated leftovers from their Friday night dinner and Rosie ate everything he gave her—at least she wasn't as picky an eater as some toddlers. In fact, she was less fussy about what she ate than Sherlock was, though she liked sugar just as much. When they were done eating, he made sure to lure her upstairs immediately with the promise of reading her favourite Thomas the Tank Engine book, even though he hated reading Thomas the Tank Engine. It worked, though—she ran to her room without a second glance at the pile of baby items in the living room.
"Of course you're not." Sherlock laughed. "It's dangerous—there's risk involved. Of course you'll want to do it again."
Sherlock heard a rustling sound but before he could warn her not to mess up his organisational scheme, John abruptly turned and rolled his chair back out into the living room. "Not those, Mrs. Hudson, don't touch those papers. I'll take them, please. I know it's cluttered but we really don't need any help."
John gave him the most non-threatening smile he could manage, so Sherlock would understand that he wasn't being teased. "It's okay. Really."
(college basketball AU).
He could still hear her, though. "That's right, Sherlock. Open him up a little more. Do you think he's ready for you yet?"
John shrugged. "I trust your judgement—you're the genius."
"You could have married her and had a whole family of tiny blond children."
Sherlock passed her over and took his tea cup over to the worktop to sip while he prepared a bottle of formula.
John felt Sherlock moving to kneel behind him, and then a different sensation, the latex of the condom brushing against him instead of just Sherlock's fingers. Again, his body tried to tense up, a natural reaction in its excited state, and he had to make himself release instead of clench his muscles. Sherlock's cock was between his cheeks, and he could feel his knuckles, as well, as Sherlock held himself, guiding his way into John's arse. John's own cock throbbed beneath him, and he wished he could touch himself, but he knew he wouldn't be able to support himself for long on only one arm. Instead he shifted his hips backwards, relishing the noises he elicited as he sent Sherlock deeper inside.
John raised an eyebrow but did as he was asked, sitting up to drag his legs over so he could lie at the edge of the narrow bed, flush against the metal rail. Sherlock slipped out of his shoes and tossed his coat onto John's empty wheelchair, then climbed onto the mattress to lie on his side next to him. He hadn't done this the last time John had been in hospital. He'd been too afraid of causing more damage while John was confined to bed, waiting for the swelling in his spinal cord to go down.
"Pwize!" Rosie demanded. She climbed up onto the low mattress of her toddler bed and reached for John's phone as he ended the call with Molly.
"What? You want more of this?" Sherlock brought one hand up again and lowered his mouth to John's chest. He was on John's right side now, so he closed his teeth on the flesh around the unpierced nipple while he played with the ring with his fingers.
There was a knock at the door and Sherlock met John's eyes, seeing the brief moment of panic he felt reflected.
Rosie tugged on his hand. "Daddy, see Sh'wock and baby now."
"Why?"
Sherlock stopped several steps above where they stood on the landing. "Hello. John. Mrs. Hudson. Rosie. I was just having a nap, but I woke up and decided I should come down and check on Eve."
She saw him almost immediately. "Mr. Holmes!" She ran a few steps towards him, then stopped to push her hair back into place. "I've been informed that James Moriarty has escaped from prison and has now killed at least five people. Will you make a statement?"
"So you asked your nurse to give you a tomato plant?"
"A little girl," he said, wiping her nose and mouth clear so she could bawl even more loudly. "She looks perfect."
John smiled back at him. "Come here and give me a real kiss. I have to get going or I'll be late."
"No, I'm not all right," she gasped. "What the hell is wrong with you? How could you possibly think I'm all right? It hurts!" She drew out the last word, nails digging grooves into her thighs.
"Prove it." John moved his mouth from Sherlock's lips to his ear, licking and tugging gently at the lobe with his teeth, as his hand moved ever faster. He kissed his way down to Sherlock's neck, murmuring still. "I want to see you come without saying a word. Without making a noise that anyone could hear outside of this bed. I want you so quiet the dog doesn't even wake up. Show me you can do it."
"I was." John pressed his lips into Sherlock's hair.
Of course it had to be Moriarty. Who else would be sending them mysterious messages? Though including Mycroft was a new twist. He pulled his legs up so he was sitting cross-legged on the bed, then opened the message and hit play.
John was right. Mycroft's agents descended on the coffee shop to find no one even close to Moriarty's description anywhere in the vicinity. When they checked the closest CCTV, they saw that he had indeed been there some twenty minutes earlier. He had waved to the camera and then disappeared into the crowd headed towards the tube station.
The ice was no problem, but finding a bag to put it in was more of a chore.
John was in much the same position as he had been when Moriarty had ended the broadcast, but his arms twitched when Sherlock called his name. Sherlock skidded to a stop, kneeling next to him. "John," he repeated, softer this time, and put a hand out to touch his face. John turned his head into the movement, eyes blinking, but it couldn't be said that he actually awoke. He gave a moan of discomfort and shrugged his shoulders, rattling the handcuffs that held his hands behind his back.
"Anthea. Of course." John shook his head. "All right, well. What's that, seven people? We'll have to sit over there in the back, won't have a good view of Rosie but we should be able to hear just fine."
He must have spent too long staring blankly at the corner where he'd thrown his bag, because the next thing he knew he felt a hesitant hand on his shoulder.
He led her upstairs and set the food out on the coffee table. There were only two chairs in the kitchen, but plenty of space for the four of them to gather in the living room and neither Mrs. Hudson nor Mrs. Holmes seemed fussed about dining in the non-traditional space. John sat at the desk so he wouldn't have to hold his food on his lap, while Sherlock chose his armchair, balancing his container of rice and chicken on his knees. Mrs. Holmes and Mrs. Hudson shared the sofa. John had never seen them together before today, and he wouldn't have been surprised if there was some animosity, given how often Sherlock complained to Mrs. Hudson about his mother. But they were surprisingly chummy with each other now. Mrs. Holmes spent the meal regaling them with stories of her children as toddlers, carefully avoiding any of the more gruesome details that John had heard about Eurus as a child.
"At this point, she can only see a few inches in front of her face, Mummy. I don't think it matters what colour the walls are painted."
"No. Sherlock. Listen to yourself. I'm not letting you shuffle me off with a bunch of senior citizens."
"What—no." John barked a short laugh. "No, Sherlock. I just think we shouldn't.... We shouldn't celebrate or condone killing just because it's for reasons we decide are justified. We need to bring Rosie and Eve up to believe killing—or any violence, really—is wrong. I know we've made light of it in the past, but we shouldn't. We have to raise those two girls right, and we should live what we teach them."
"Oh, I hope he put some shoes on," Gram said. "It's chilly out there tonight."
"Mm-hmm." Sherlock rolled so he was lying half on top of John. "Moriarty killed the Crawfords because they refused to have sex with him. You sure you don't want me to do anything for you?"
"I think you've mistaken me for someone else."
"There's some extra rice if you want some."
Sherlock glanced once more at Rosie's little home-school corner, then turned to examine John, who had closed his eyes and let his head fall back on the chair. Understandable. He had done most of the heavy lifting of the move today. Sherlock had tried to do his fair share, but ended up spending most of the day wrangling Rosie, who was also eager to help but tended to create more chaos with her efforts. Hiring movers would have been the obvious solution, of course, but he and John agreed it was not a feasible option in the midst of a pandemic.
"That will not be necessary," John said.
"So...?"
Rosie not wanting to sleep in a room alone at Gram and Grandad's seems to be a tradition, since she's not quite 2 in this one and not quite 4 in the one earlier when the power goes out. :)
"On the contrary," Sherlock said. "I always need you here. I can always use your assistance, and—"
“If they’re watching this channel, yes.” Mycroft stepped away, speaking rapidly into his phone.
Dad ignored him and said to Rosie, "She's killed a lot of people, probably more than we even know about."
"Shh." John cut him off, bringing a finger to Sherlock's lips. "I don't need a pill, especially not if you're willing to be a little rough."
John hadn't kissed him in over two days. Fifty-seven and a half hours, to be exact, and that last kiss had been just a quick peck on the cheek before John left for work. When he'd come back home that evening, he'd started in with his social distancing lectures and refused to kiss, touch or sleep in the same bed with Sherlock. They were still sharing a flat, however, and it had only the one loo, which meant there was no practical way for them to avoid contact with each other completely. Not to mention that it was entirely possible that one or both of them had been exposed to the virus days or even weeks ago, which meant they'd likely already exchanged germs and there was no point to staying away from each other now.
for that. Too moral." He spat. "You're on the side of the angels, and it's boring, Sherlock."
"Hang on." John turned his chair to head back out into the hallway, returning a few moments later, shaking his head. "Nothing."
John glared at him, his jaw working as he tried to come up with a rebuttal, then he threw up his hands. "Fine. I'll help you change the sheets and then I'm going home." He dropped his med kit on the desk by the window, then turned and stalked back down the hall, into the bedroom, softening immediately when he saw Eve asleep in the cot.
Today, Sherlock had been gone for nearly six hours—was this the day when he wouldn't return? John tried to tell himself he was overreacting, but couldn't escape the escalating thoughts of disaster as he fed Rosie dinner and got her ready for bed. Would he and Rosie stay at Baker Street if Sherlock died at Sherrinford? He swallowed and told himself he was being ridiculous—of course they would stay here. No, that was wrong—of course Sherlock wasn't going to die at Sherrinford. He would be home soon. John didn't try to text or call him. There was no reception on the island and he couldn't deal with the ambiguity of not receiving a reply.
"I am absolutely certain that is not true. No house is that big." Sherlock groaned and laid his head on the table atop his arms.
Now, even with Sherlock's arms around him, he couldn't stop shaking. Sherlock didn't shy away, though, just held him with the exact amount of pressure that he needed. John hated it: he hated that he needed to be held, and, if he was honest, hated that the only time they ever touched each other like this when one of them was upset beyond words. But most of all, he hated the shaking. The shuddering, full-body tremors that he could do nothing to control. Less because they were a symptom of the panic attack enveloping him than because they served as a reminder of the tremors that had ended his career as a surgeon.
John smiled. "I think it's because I like you. So I say nice things about you."
Anthea emerged from the car behind him, much more restrained. She followed Mycroft's gaze to Sherlock and John and nodded, then turned to glance briefly at Mrs. Hudson, who was sitting in a chair on the pavement a few doors down from Speedy's. Her bodyguard—Leon, according to John—must have borrowed a seat from Speedy's for her. She had also acquired possession of Stone, who was currently sitting expectantly at her feet, looking up at Leon. As Sherlock watched, the bodyguard withdrew a treat of some sort from his suit pocket and gave it to him. Leon had obviously been well-prepped for his new job.
John stepped out from behind the tree and Sherlock felt even worse. Or maybe better. There were a few silvery flakes from the garland that had attached themselves to John's jumper, and his hair glittered silver in the soft rainbow light of the tree, as well. Sherlock wanted to get up and sweep him into his arms and kiss him until they both couldn't breathe, and he also wanted to sweep Rosie off her feet and make her giggle until she begged him to stop. How could he be expected to function while living in the same flat with two people who made him feel that way?
"I wouldn't have objected to new windows. For the whole building. Would've helped with insulating it better, too."
Sherlock snorted. "Given that Moriarty was able to slip a camera into your own house, I'm not sure that staying at one of the safe houses you've got scattered about the city will be any more secure."
"You were opposed to making any substantial changes in the bedroom, if I recall correctly."
Now he just needed to escape from the flat. He could say he was going to the dry cleaners down the street and then slip out the back door of the cleaners' shop, but the guards downstairs would notify Mycroft as soon as he left the building. And he didn't trust the dry cleaners or any of the other neighbouring businesses not to sell him out to his brother if pressed. Which left one other way to exit the building. Still not secretly, but he could hide his tracks for a little while, at least.
Sherlock scoffed. "Mycroft's not as smart as he thinks he is, either."
"Did she mention anything at all about who the father may be?" Mycroft asked. "She's been out for 44 weeks and three days, so I assume it wasn't anyone she encountered at Sherrinford."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Perfect. Let's go put these in your school corner so they'll be all ready for tomorrow morning." Sherlock escorted Rosie out of the kitchen.
"Because he's doing as much as he can to interfere with your life. That's the reason for everything he's done."
"Something like that." He rubbed at the back of his head, and glanced at Sherlock's bed. "I think...I think I'm going to sleep upstairs, if you won't be going to bed anyway. Rosie's used to me being up there with her."
While Sherlock inspected the bodies, John slowly made his way around the living room, looking at family photos and the flat's other decor and announcing his findings to Sherlock. "Looks like she was a teacher. Little kids. Not sure about him...maybe something in an office?"
"Do I?"
John made a noise that was supposed to be an acknowledgement that everything was fine and sat back on his feet, trying to act as if he had some reason for kneeling on the floor.
"We can't let some random man raise her, Mycroft. As you also said before, she has our family's genes. I know she'll be fine, but we will need to keep a close eye on her. She'll be far too intelligent for a normal person to handle."
Mummy wouldn't have opened it herself—she didn't want to intrude, after all—but that bedroom door never did latch properly, and at some point in the night it had drifted open nearly all the way. Well, enough for her to see in, at least. And, of course, it wasn't her fault there was a nightlight on in the room. That caught her by surprise, until she saw Rosie was asleep in the bed, too, sprawled on her back between Sherlock and John, her head mostly on Sherlock's pillow.
"Yes," Sherlock breathed, and tightened his fist around himself.
"That's a good way to hurt yourself," John told him. "You know this door was reinforced in the renovation."
"You didn't know that I wanted you?"
"Yours isn't any better."
"I understand, Rosie," John said. "I'm sorry, but...." He trailed off, unsure of how to explain to a two-year-old why she would never have a sister.
"I know, it's just.... They shouldn't have—" She looked up at him without finishing her sentence.
"Yeah." John picked up the stack of a dozen or so papers and tapped them on the surface of the nightstand to straighten them together.
"You're not working today. It's Friday."
"Oh, is that a raincoat he has on?"
"Of course I wasn't, Mummy. I was simply too busy to stay."
"It's not a murder," Sherlock added. "I discovered that this resort has more than one gift shop."
"No, it would not be easier."
"Did you remember to wear your mask?"
if you are interested in seeing what I might write next. Thank you!
"No, it's fine, Molly."
John's smile widened as he tucked his lunch bag into his work satchel. "I'm glad you finally figured out the connection with Moriarty. I feel a lot less guilty about going to work now."
"I look dangerous right now and, as much as you've tried to fight it, that's the number one quality you enjoy in a partner, male or female."
John shook his head. "It's okay. Let's go home. I'll brush my teeth and we can take Stone for a walk and we can kiss in the middle of the park if you want."
"Lovely!" Mrs. Hudson clapped her hands together. "Oh, I know! We can stop down for pastries at Speedy's! Mr. Chatterjee would love to meet you." She tittered and beckoned to the guard, who followed her out of the kitchen.
John laughed, with only a slight turn to coughing at the end. "Okay. Give me a few more days. I'm sorry I brought this home to you. Just one of the hazards of my job."
Lestrade opened the door and Mycroft entered the flat, followed by two large men in black suits. "It's not a betrayal, little brother. He simply shares my concern for your safety. John." Mycroft looked down at John, and Sherlock had to push back an urge to physically jump in between them to keep Mycroft away.
John didn't laugh. "Take Stone outside while I'm in the bath. And take your time, let him run around for a bit."
John twisted his head to watch over his own shoulder, and saw Sherlock drop the bottle of lubricant into his jacket pocket, then tear open the condom wrapper.
"Right." He wanted to grab Sherlock by the arm and pull him into the kitchen so they could chat, but instead his eyes were drawn again to Eve, who continued to sleep contentedly on her mother's chest, oblivious to the awkward tension engulfing the adults in the room around her.
"Oh, that's great to hear, John. I was worried."
Sherlock heaved himself up to sitting, rubbing at his eyes. "I already brushed them, before you showered."
He continued his inspection of the rings: 14 carat gold, not particularly high end but not inexpensive, either. No names or initials inside, just a date engraved on each one: 18-6-2011. Wedding date, obviously; it should have been helpful but wasn't. June was the most popular month for weddings. Only married five years, with an anniversary coming up next month. So the couple might be fairly young; the average age for marriage in England was 32 for men and 30 for women. He and John of course skewed higher than that average.
"Not at all." John lifted his head to meet his eyes. "I mean, okay, individually, sure, we may each be a bit rubbish. But together.... Even apart I think we're both better than we were, and together I think we're just about perfect."
"Our first case. I was afraid this might be our last, once I realised what was happening."
"Yes." The lump of tension in John's chest started to dissolve. "That's what she said. I'd like to have dinner with you, as well."
Moriarty raised his hands to his mouth. "I forgot! You didn't invite me to the wedding."
John got home from work on the first of December to find that someone had decorated 221 Baker Street from top to bottom. Several someones, it appeared, given that outside the building there were fairy lights strung across the balcony railings and wreaths hung above the windows, at a height that only Sherlock could have reached. Once John opened the door and went inside, he saw that Mrs. Hudson had clearly been at work, as well. He could smell the scent of ginger and molasses baking, and the armchair and table in the entryway were both draped in green and red crochet.
Sherlock scrambled up from his seat. "Why would you do that?"
She wrinkled her nose at him but stayed silent and let him take her blood pressure. When he was done, she asked, "Will I survive, Doctor?"
Mycroft inhaled loudly and made a show of adjusting the laptop screen in front of him. "I must insist that you stop this now and concentrate on the more urgent issues facing us. There will be time for you to talk about your feelings when Moriarty is behind bars and you're alone together once more. Please."
"What is it?" John came out of the kitchen, lifting his chin to get a glimpse of the article in Sherlock's hand. "Oh, hang on. Don't read that—" He reached out as if to snatch the papers away, but Sherlock raised them out of his reach.
John shook his head. "She's fine. They're both fine. I don't think you need me here any longer, and I should really go get Rosie from Molly's—"
Sherlock nodded. "I know. I know. I'll...figure something else out." He spread his hand out over Eve's stomach, covering her from feet to neck, and looked up at John again. "I'm sorry."
"Knowing how to express one's feelings doesn't come naturally to everyone. Eurus has changed." Sherlock swallowed visibly and shifted his hold on Eve against his chest. "Mycroft, you were wrong about her before, and never allowed her the chance to have any life outside of Sherrinford, and you're wrong about her now. I won't say she's perfect, but she deserves a chance."
"Okay. I won't." Sherlock slipped his jacket off and reached for a dressing gown. Lestrade could Skype him from the crime scene instead.
"Would've been easier to just sit on my arse and drag myself up," John said.
"No. Don't." John grabbed Sherlock's right hand, glove and all, and squeezed his fingers so tightly Sherlock couldn't have broken the grip if he'd tried. "I'mmm—" John leaned forward slightly, left hand moving furiously, until he suddenly stilled, too, and Sherlock watched over his shoulder as John's climax spattered across their antique rug.
