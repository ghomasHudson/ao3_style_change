“It's the least I could do, right?” She shrugs simply.
Anything for a reprieve from the endless, all-consuming boredom slowly driving him mad.
“Time's nearly up,” he reports.
Sherlock smiles up at John tremulously in response, even while, inside of him, his Omega deflates pitifully at John’s words.
“You’ve been trying to put her off all night,” the young man whispers back quickly, carefully keeping his face turned away from the approaching woman as he does. “Clearly without much success. So I’m helping you. When it seems the right moment, tell her that I have six months to live.”
“Look,” John winces, “it's not something I can just turn off. Believe me, I've tried. But I swear it won’t—”
“Where’s John?” He questions, casting an inquisitive eye about the room.
“Well seeing as her interest in you lies primarily in your status as an Alpha doctor, your appearance is little more than a pleasant fringe benefit. Frankly, you could show up in a clown suit and she wouldn’t be deterred,” Sherlock sneers and John finds himself taking an involuntary step backward in surprise. Sherlock’s always been casually disdainful of the women John’s dated, but there’s a flash of spite in his eyes this time that John’s never seen before.
And he squeezes his eyes shut.
should fill Sherlock with horror— but instead, his eyes roll back and he cries out as his cock spasms, hot fluid splashing up between their bellies. John lifts his head to clumsily mash their mouths together in a kiss as they ride out the aftershocks, shuddering against one another helplessly.
He doesn’t know the damn code, and John is going to
“Can we have a moment alone?” The nurse nods and quietly absents herself, easing the door shut behind her as she leaves. “Look Sherlock, I won’t sugar-coat things for you. The doctor met with Mycroft and I while you were sleeping— ”

is certainly one way to put it,” John quips, and Sherlock squirms a bit at the unexpected praise. He’s well aware that, as an Omega, his penis is markedly smaller than an Alpha’s, or even most Beta’s. The proof of that is quite apparent between them after all.
“What?” He freezes, turning to John in surprise. The doctor is cradling his chin thoughtfully in one hand as he considers the evidence scattered across the desk, but when Sherlock turns to him, he glances up and smiles. Sherlock ignores the odd flutter that the smile triggers in his belly, drawing his eyebrows together and frowning instead.
, and yet so affably...
“Ah,” John muses, realizing then that he’s gone about this all the wrong way. For all his posturing, Sherlock is nonetheless young, inexperienced omega. Full of urge and instinct, but innocent to the act of lovemaking. And, above all else, he’s
“Look,” John rubs the back of his neck self-consciously. “I know this will probably come as a bit of a surprise, but well… we’re, um… expecting—”
that Sherlock had confessed to engaging in with Victor at University.
“Of course not!” Mycroft huffs with affront and reaches up to straighten his tie.
Lestrade follow’s John’s gaze and the grin of elation melts from his face. Before the DI even opens his mouth, Sherlock feels his stomach swoop in unpleasant anticipation.
“You must be John,” the doctor smiles, as he approaches, politely holding out a hand in greeting.
worse — that the sire isn't absent at all.”
my bed partners keen.” He murmurs reassuringly, and Sherlock turns to nuzzle into a palm, his eyes falling shut in bliss as he breathes in the warm Alpha scent. John lets him scent for a few moments, then his hands slip down to cup Sherlock’s shoulders and gently press him back onto his pillow.
of it, love.” John laughs, reaching out to rest his hand on Sherlock’s upper thigh.
embarrassed about in this whole sordid mess, it’s that.
Thankfully John is more than amenable to assuaging the ache.
“Brixton, Lauriston Gardens.”
“Beauty sleep, eh?” Lestrade flicks his eyes over the the doctor consideringly. “No offense mate, but it doesn’t look like it did you any good,” he informs John with a cheeky grin.
They lay quietly, staring back at one another across the duvet, only the gradually levelling off of their breathing disturbing the silence.
“But…” John sniffs the air repeatedly with a frown, turning his head this way and that, not unlike a hound catching a scent. “It absolutely
It all happens very quickly; before he can question their intentions, they duck their head down and press their soft lips gently against his. As the momentary sense of alarm subsides he closes his eyes and leans into the kiss; forgetting himself for a moment in the simple pleasure of human touch. When the warm tip of a tongue extends to hesitantly trace his lower lip he opens to it willingly, reaching up to slip his fingers beneath their hood and into a soft cloud of curls.
Not much later, he cradles it in his lap while he slumps morosely on a cushioned bench; directly across from John and his current companion, his eyes trained on them grimly. Every now and again, John locks eyes with him as he sips his drink, nodding along inattentively to whatever his admirer is chattering about. After the third time, Sherlock offers him a small smile, and John turns to inform his date of something before placing his drink on the table, and easing himself from the booth. He heads toward the toilet’s without a backward glance, and Sherlock immediately rises to follow him.
Two days and two more successfully unnoticed cuddles later, he decides to join John on a trip to Tesco’s to do the shopping. John makes a frankly offensive fuss over the decision, which Sherlock magnanimously chooses to overlook, in favour of enjoying the admittedly plebeian, but nevertheless strangely alluring, interlude of content domesticity.
” Pulling a photograph from the pile, he slaps it down and pointedly spins it about to face Lestrade. "
“Rather difficult to do so without a mirror,” Sherlock replies, arching coquettishly and turning his face to mouth at John’s palm.
“No you couldn’t,” Sherlock insistently contents. John is momentarily affronted by the implied slight to his virility before realization dawns on him suddenly. Oh— omegas are notoriously sheltered, and Sherlock is just barely out of the schoolroom. Perhaps he doesn’t realize how…
a baby.”
But something within him needs to say the words, unwise as it may be. And with this masked stranger in particular he feels a strange sense camaraderie. "In the interest of being entirely truthful; my heart belongs to another.”
“I see.” Mycroft murmurs softly, a strange sadness to his tone.
“It was an acci—” He pauses, looking up just in time to catch John’s warning glower. “It was a singular occurrence; I had an unexpected heat, and John provided his assistance. Due to a small error of judgement I am now carrying our child.” Sherlock sighs heavily. “Now, can we

Sherlock tenses his jaw and reaches up to grasp the door handle. Mycroft throws up a staying hand and quickly taps his umbrella twice against the floor of the car. The moment the car glides to a stop alongside the kerb, Sherlock wrenches the lever and immediately throws the door open.
And that’s when, of course, everything goes to shite.
John props himself up on one elbow so that he can gaze down at Sherlock, lying stretched out alongside him, entirely unashamed of his nakedness. He reaches out in wonderment to stroke a gentle hand over the small, firm swell of Sherlock’s abdomen, made all the more noticeable by his supine sprawl.

“Now, I’d say at this juncture that it’s quite obvious that Marie was never kidnapped. The two of you arranged for her to disappear in order to throw us off her scent, and give the impression of the involvement of an outside party,” Sherlock announces pointedly. "Pity that it backfired; if you hadn't attracted so much attention to her, we might never have discovered the pregnancy and narrowed in our focus." With that, he pulls his mobile from his pocket and begins tapping away at it, his interest in any further interrogation apparently concluded.
Thankfully he doesn’t have to, as the Alpha sets back to it immediately. From the first few slightly awkward bobs of John’s head, and the way that he fumbles to coordinate his hands at first it’s obvious that he has no experience at it. But he takes to it quickly, and before long, he has Sherlock writhing and moaning helplessly beneath the twin sensations of his mouth and the steady twist of his fingers inside. The urgency of the feeling builds quickly, until Sherlock’s startled to realize just how close he is to climax.
John’s words die on his tongue when a figure emerges from the shadows amongst the control panels, and Sherlock feels the bottom of his stomach drop away.
Which seem frankly a bit accusatory in John’s opinion, but Sherlock kicks up surprisingly little fuss over it, so John holds his tongue.
“Obvious!” The omega hops down from his perch and advances on John, eyes bright with excitement. “Your cane isn’t an affectation like so many alphas favour, but rather a necessity. Despite what everyone assumes, however, your leg suffered only a minor injury; it was the wound to your shoulder that nearly killed you. The leg is merely the most noticeable of the two. Regardless, obviously wounded in battle. But where?”
Until Irene Adler's interference, he’d managed to go

John leans against the kitchen doorframe and levels a long look at him. “Oh, okay then,” he agrees dryly, “
“We can look to your person for clues. Your complexion is far darker than befits a member of the beau monde, and your hair is clearly several shades lighter than it’s natural hue, which only further exaggerates your colouring. Frankly, as my Aunt Violet would say; you’re brown as a nut.”
an unbonded couple. Terribly scandalous, didn’t you know.”
“Then, Dr. Watson, I believe you have yourself a deal.”
And then, that night, on his own foolhardy suggestion, they venture out into Dewer’s Hollow with Henry, and his newfound, cheerful contentment shatters apart in a torch-lit instant.
“Oh my god...” John breathes with complete and utter wonderment as his heartbeat ratchets up to a rabbit's pace.

“That isn’t— I mean… Perha—”
Frowning down at the pretty blonde Omega, Sherlock taps his thumb against the edge of the photograph as he contemplates whether to notify Lestrade of the acquaintance. He discards the notion almost immediately. He never gave a fig about her one way or another, but there’s a possibility that Lestrade might take him off the case because of it. No, he’ll definitely leave that little tidbit unmentioned. He tosses the photo aside decisively and continues on.
It would only encourage her.
Christ, but he’s a mess.
“Very well,” Mycroft sighs heavily. “While this is
“So about this marriage…” John ventures, and Molly takes a drink and smiles sheepishly.
Life is still nuts, so writing continues to be a little slower going than I'd like, but thank goodness for the weekend and being able to pull incredibly late-nighters!

Sherlock grimaces and shakes his head with vehement distaste. “When you, ah
A few days later, he and John host Christmas Eve at the flat. With the fuss of the Cavendish case, and everything
Now, perched on the closed toilet lid, he venomously curses all six of the small plastic sticks lined up along the sink in front of him. The alarm on his phone beeps, and he blows out a sharp, steadying stream of air before reaching out to flip the last of the tests over. The results are positively

“Once you’ve ruled out the impossible,” Sherlock murmurs softly in response, “whatever remains– however improbable–
“No,” Sherlock shakes his head decisively. “I wouldn't.”
Despite John’s mild embarrassment, it was really quite convenient actually. Besides providing the much appreciated spot of tea, and it had given John the opportunity to concoct some excuse involving the flu that would provide them privacy for the remainder of his heat.
“No, I'm, uh- I'm engaged. I have a fiancé. She's called Molly.” Sherlock explains in a rush, and John frowns at him in bewilderment, casting an eye about as if Molly might pop out from behind one of the cars parked nearby at any moment.

Sherlock lets out an irritated huff and slaps his notebook shut, giving up on whatever the hell he’s doing with his goddamn microscope for the time being. Propping his elbows on the tabletop, he presses his palms together, prayer-like in front of his chest and angles his chin up at John haughtily.

“I’d say those things will kill you,’ John breaks the silence, “but that wouldn’t exactly be the truth around here, would it?” Sherlock chuckles, then sighs, looking downward as he taps away the ash.
Despite their original plans not to go abroad, they impulsively book a last-minute honeymoon to Grenada, and the day before their flight he gets the 3 am phone call from Harry he’s been expecting for some time. He rubs a hand over his face as she tearfully informs his she’s just walked out on her long-suffering wife, and considers whether it’s worth the energy to rewind the booking.
“Sherlock?”
“Deduce that, did you?” John laughs drily, but with no real bite to his tone. As he speaks, his brings both hands up to ruffle through the hair at his crown in a rough, self-conscious manner. Sherlock watches the action from the corner of one eye, and finds his own fingers twitching with a sudden desire to slide through ashen blonde strands. Instead, he presses his left hand tight against his thigh and keeps his eyes trained intently on the ceiling above them as John continues. “That’s one way of putting it. I got in after a late lab to find her and one of my flatmates, Liam O’Donnelly, shagging each other blind on the sofa of the shared lounge.”
“Pregnant.”
With an aggravated shake of his head he stomps off in the direction of his own car, gesturing for John and Sherlock to follow him. “Just get in the car and lets go.”
“No, of course not,” he murmurs, frowning down at the game pieces.
“Why didn’t you say,” John quizzes him suddenly, at just about the halfway point to Baker Street, “that you and Marie Cavendish knew each other? You must have recognized her the moment you saw name and her photograph in the case file.”
“Fair enough,” John giggles good-naturedly, leaning close to nip playfully at Sherlock earlobe. “I have been keeping you rather occupied, haven’t I?” Sherlock chuckles low and deep, wrapping a long-fingered hand around John’s nape to redirect his mouth upward and bring their lips together for heated kiss.
“Shit, sorry, did that—“ John stammers apologetically, pulling his hand back to hover above Sherlock's chest. Sherlock blinks in surprise; he distinctly recalls that being a remarkably

“Has he been here?”

“Have I…?” John looks momentarily befuddled, then smirks and laughs. “Given how much time you’ve spent haranguing me about the time I spend with girlfriends, I think that’s fairly obv-” Sherlock abruptly interrupts him again in exasperation.
“Gave you a bit of a scare, did he?” The beta medic neatly bandaging John’s arm smiles up at Sherlock while she works. “Mine’s just the same. Alphas,” she shakes her head good-naturedly, “they're all alike. Luckily, they’re also built like brick houses. There we are, right as rain.” She pats John on the knee as she finishes off bandaging his arm. “You stay out of trouble now— your poor mate’s got more than enough to worry about while he’s carrying.”
It’s different this time, than that first accidental heat, when they conceived their son, or all the times they’ve made love since. This time is deliberate and carefully prepared for— neither of them have any desire to provide Alfie with a sibling, after all.
“Mrs Hudson leave Baker Street?” Sherlock questions sternly, wrapping an arm about her shoulders and tugging her close in a playfully protective gesture. “England would fall.”
John lets loose an uproarious laugh, and a smile creeps across Sherlock’s face before he slowly joins in with a chuckle of his own. It starts off a wavering, as if rusty from disuse, then settles into a steady, confident rumble. As their laughter dies down, John realizes with a jolt that their hands are still loosely grasped between them.
John stops short in his tracks, gaping over his shoulder at Stamford in disbelief.
John pointedly ignores the warm, embarrassingly

A brief shadow crosses John’s face and his grin falters.

“Oh, come now,” Stamford bolsters him with the nudge of an elbow. “Despite Harry’s best efforts to tarnish it, the Watson name still has it’s worth. And you know as well as I that, in the end, the title will fall to your heir— if not to you directly — what with Harry’s choice of wife.”
“Might be hungry.” She posits with a mischievous quirk of her brows.
He pages through the bundle of documents briefly, then sets to copying the contents of one onto a fresh sheet. “You will of course receive my brother's dowry, in addition to the property I had intended to bequeath to him in the event of his marriage. The lion's share of his marriage portion will, however, be deposited to a trust in his name, from which you will receive a monthly stipend. I will settle any personal debts that you have incurred separately, as well as those against your family seat; providing that your sister sign the property over to your name post-haste.” He glances up from the page to look down his nose at John. “I do understand that to be the primary motivator of this endeavour.”
Sherlock’s hand rises to clutch tightly at the back of John’s skull, long fingers scrabbling in ashy-gold locks. His free hand grasps John’s, pulling it away from his hip to tug it downward, pressing it against the fall of his breeches. John mindlessly follows the direction, groping at the small, hard ridge straining against the fabric, muffling his own groan against the warm neck beneath his lips as Sherlock responds to his touch with a broken moan.
might have been the one to make the realization. Which is a particularly horrific scenario to imagine. The other signs he’d disregarded entirely up until they were neatly itemized in bullet form over an appalling pink background on his mobile screen, having so long divorced his mind from the lesser discomforts of his transport.
“Twice, “ she reiterates fervently, entirely undeterred by Sherlock’s denial, and the stricken Alpha inside of John howls.
Pulling away from him.
While it’s clearly enormously titillating to some, he doesn’t give a toss what sexual shenanigans the members of the royal family idiotically choose to involve themselves in. When one lives under the microscope of an entire nation, it’s excessively foolhardy to assume you’ll be able to keep that sort of thing hidden without paying through the nose for it. He tells their man as much when he questions whether they’ll take the case.
“Wait, Sherlock!”
“I know what he likes,” she acknowledges with a careless shrug, “and I needed to disappear.”
I’ll just clean him up a touch first.”
“Looks like we’re having a baby.”
Dilated pupils, flushed skin, lethargy, perspiration, and a slight tremor. Exhibition of uncharacteristic behaviour, and euphoric response toward positive stimulus. Easily attributable to various combinations of recreational substances, most of which Sherlock has at least a passing acquaintance with.
A little boy, or girl, with Sherlock's curls or his eyes; his infinite curiosity.

“What would you like to do?” John angles his face up to regard Sherlock. “That you've never done?”

John pauses and pulls back just enough to lap at the head of Sherlock's cock as he asks teasingly, “You sure? I could stop.”
“Of course not. Don't be ridiculous,” he dismisses the wildly unacceptable suggestion. “I'm in the middle of giving birth to our child, and I’m not above admitting that it’s a— “ Another contraction hits, surging through his body like a wave, and he pauses to pant through it. He crushes John’s fingers with his own, only letting up as it retreats. “Deeply uncomfortable experience,” he continues as he catches his breath. “So, I would much prefer you carry on exactly as your doing. I don't give a rat’s arse what she thinks.”

“Oh! Hello Mycroft!” Molly beams amiably. “This is John Watson, Sherlock’s friend.”
“There’s plenty of time for that,” he promises. “All the time in the world.”

“You realise this is a tiny bit humiliating?” John informs Sherlock peevishly through the laptop screen.
"J-John, John, John."
One less thing to take care of, in any case.
“If you don’t already know what The Quagmire is, you probably don’t
“John,” he tries again, his mouth practically against the man’s ear.
He’s had glimpses of course; the dangerous nature of their work has occasionally required him to assist John in cleaning and dressing a wound, and on occasion John’s wandered about in his dressing gown after bathing.
John reaches down and unhooks the fastener of Sherlock’s trousers in a deft one-handed move that makes the blood fairly evaporate in Sherlock’s veins. The wool slithers down his legs to pool on the floor, and he steps out of them seamlessly, keeping his body pressed close to John’s as they make their way across the kitchen floor together.
“But that's mad!” Sherlock exclaims unintentionally before reigning himself in and trying again. “That is... What I meant to say was-
not even when his own life’s been at risk. He wants nothing more than to tear their throats out with his teeth, but he can’t risk John’s safety.
It’s nearly the end of the Season when the Duke of Westminster himself hosts a ball at his townhouse off Grosvenor Square, to which John’s startled to find an invitation delivered to his apartments. He and the Duke hardly travel in the same circles, and John will certainly not flatter himself to think that the Lady Stamford’s support has elevated his own social status to quite such a degree. Sherlock must have arranged it somehow.
Without any conscious thought, he reaches out and clutches at John’s hand, then realizes his mistake and starts. Just as he’s about to carefully retract his hand — in the hopes that the gesture has gone unnoticed in the excitement of moment — John squeezes back, turning to shoot him an exuberant grin before gluing his eyes back to the monitor.
better things to do with his time; he’s hardly in a mood to charitably assist the man still carrying around a humiliating video of him bumbling about pathetically under the influence of The Woman’s sedative. He can just be on his merry little way.
“Out of proportion? Have you
A pleased smile takes up residence on Sherlock’s face, and stays there for the rest of the drive.
As he stands on the kerb while John lugs their bags to the waiting taxi, Sherlock can’t help but feel a bit as though they're headed away on holiday. The sort of short mini-break a happily bonded pair might venture off on, before late pregnancy makes travel too uncomfortable.
“Hey! Why did you run away?”
“Yes,” she acknowledges begrudgingly, “but I don’t understand it. “
Every atom of his of his being, Alpha or otherwise, longs to tear out her throat. It takes all his willpower to turn heel and force himself to march away instead. When she calls after him as he’s storming away, asking him what she should say, the strained tether on his fury finally snaps.
“We're not discussing this,” John informs him sternly, avoiding the question entirely.
“Is he alright?” Molly questions anxiously while Sherlock continues to dry heave helplessly.

How curious, the depth of sentiment that such a tiny, half-formed being can elicit.
“You berk. Fair enough.” John huffs, hitching Sherlock’s knee up over his right arm as he braces himself down on his left. “Suppose we can always roll over it gets too much.” Sherlock wraps his arms around John’s shoulders, pulling him close, and lifts his legs to encompass his waist.
“Alright?” He mumbles against warm skin.
He laughs— properly laughs— for the first time since Afghanistan.
Sherlock's eyes fly open and snap to John, body tensing in alert, as though surprised by someone else's presence in the flat.
“Like this.” Sherlock hears himself pant, clutching John’s sides insistently and trying to coax him forward. “I want to see you.”
change things.”
quite particular about the Holmes lineage.” He drops dramatically back over the arm of his chair to sprawl across it delightedly.
“So I’ve noticed.”
“Yes,” Sherlock breathes, eyes glazed and molten. “Alright.”
Sherlock is a thirty-two year old man who delightedly dives into the underbelly of London on a near-daily basis; not some sheltered Omega boy just out of the schoolroom. Admittedly, the Alpha-Alpha dynamic is somewhat interesting at least. John certainly seems to agree, if the way that his eyebrows have flown up into his hairline are anything to go by.
“Ah. Well. I suppose that may have been worth retaining.” He grants begrudgingly. It’s a rare occasion that he regrets deleting wholly uninteresting data, but he admits that perhaps, in this case, it may have been somewhat imprudent.
“Jesus, Sherlock. I shouldn’t have- I just… I’m sorry.” He breathes deeply through his nose and blows it back out again sharply. “So whatever happened to him? Please tell me something terrible.”
‘No, I- I just haven't had it in a while,” Sherlock fibs, quickly taking another sip. “It's good.”
“You don’t think it was murder?” She asks dubiously, and he sighs heavily, which makes John smile in amusement.
John laughs at that, shaking his head fondly.
“But you’ve acquired something that’s more danger than protection.” Sherlock leans back in his chair with a disinterested roll of his eyes. “Do you know what it is?”

It’s been an age since he’s had any reason to venture up into the teaching labs, and he loiters by the doorway when Mike shepards him inside, marveling over the gleaming worktops and high-end equipment. There’s a posh young man stood at one of the worktops to the side of the room — a graduate student perhaps — who glances up briefly from his pipetting as they enter before returning his attention to his work.
“Well, if you insist.” John buries his fingers in Sherlock’s riotous curls and pulls him down to suck his lower lip into his mouth. “I suppose I can oblige.”

Except apparently it
For a moment they simply stare at one another, the weight of silence hanging heavy between them. Then John snaps his mouth shut with a sharp shake of his head, and turns to continue up the stairs, grumbling inaudibly all the while.
“Pull over.” Sherlock snaps, and Mycroft looks up from his phone in bewilderment.

“Yes, yes,” Sherlock readily agrees as he blows on his drink to cool it. “But I’d prefer to tell him myself, rather than via a medical report appearing on his desktop.”
“Father had been firmly against suppressants
He’d awoken to find John watching him, and the moment that their gazes had met, the unease had struck; not unlike a punch to the gut. John had stared at him in wide-eyed silence, and he hadn’t known what to say himself, so it had seemed better to say nothing at all. So he’d clutched the edges of the topsheet tightly against himself and fled to the loo without a backward glance.
“That’s very dedicated of you,” Lestrade leans forward to commend Eddie with an affected air of camaraderie. “Must’ve make it hard to find an Omega of your own though

“Okay,” John agrees with shaky nod, panting slightly before he captures Sherlock’s mouth again with his own, tangling their tongues together again. They strip each other’s clothes off frantically, wriggling and thrashing about until they’re skin to skin. Sherlock rolls them so that he’s on top, relinquishing John’s lips to smear hot kisses along John’s jawline and neck, slowly working his way down and over his chest. John sighs happily and settles back against the pillows, quite content to let Sherlock explore.

“Well, would you look at that,” Lestrade marvels, tracing their son’s profile with one fingertip. “Looking like a proper person already. He's got your nose Sherlock. Everything alright?”
With little more than a growl he turns on heel, snatches his black jacket from the wardrobe, and yanks it on before storming down the stairs.
No, hopefully he’d been too occupied with wrangled a decidedly insensible Sherlock into bed to have noticed them. And it
“What case? Pay her, now and in full. As Miss Adler remarks in her masthead: ‘know when you are beaten’.” As he moves to reach for his coat dismissively, Mycroft pipes up.
As soon as she’s out of sight, the two collapse against each other in a fit of giggles.
“Yes, he's been in touch.” Mycroft acknowledges sourly in reply. “Seems desperate for my attention,” his voice sinks, taking on a substantially more ominous air, “which I'm sure can be arranged.”
“I thought as much,” he states, vaulting out onto the sidewalk with a swoop of his coat, anger lending him entirely more grace than should be reasonably possible at this point in his pregnancy. He pauses, gripping the door to lean back in for a moment. “Do avoid contacting me for the foreseeable future Mycroft,” he fairly snarls, then heaves himself backward and slams the door.
“Of course,” John agrees, forcing a smile of his own as his traitorous mind immediately drifts back to the garden, and the thoughts of Sherlock that had flashed through his mind.
“It's been a pleasure to meet you,” Sherlock announces, offering his hand to John rather formally.
He’d said, tentatively meeting Sherlock’s gaze.
“You know I'm just a visitor.”
“Yeah, no,” John grouses, “trust me, I remember her. But you must have imagined it when I was out at the pub. I didn’t even know you were expecting then! Why on earth would I have been…”
absolutely
Determined to wrest some kind of response from the detective, John tries again, asking the question he doesn’t really want to know the answer to. Sherlock’s always been especially good at telling him what he doesn’t want to hear. “Do you think you’ll be seeing her again?
“For the last time Mycroft, I refuse to be para—“ The young man begins irritably. He freezes in wide-eyed embarrassment as he turns his head toward the doorway and registers that it isn’t, in fact, ‘Mycroft’ who’s encroached upon his domain. “Oh, Stamford! My apologies. Hello,” he stammers and blushes prettily; a faint dusting of pink blooming across his cheekbones.
“Sherlock is a
Well, no bother. With the stakes so low, and no lives at risk, it’s unexpectedly thrilling to be outwitted for once. He does so enjoy a challenge, and Irene Adler has proven herself to be just that.
Sherlock drops his head back against the pillow and groans brokenly, nodding. He’s vaguely aware that, had he currently greater command over his faculties, he’d be absolutely
“Those were exemplary situations!” Sherlock throws his hands upward. He narrows his eyes to slits and draws himself up to his full height to better tower over John. “Don’t presume that you have the right to tell me what I can and cannot do just because I'm carrying your child! As you’re always so quick to remind everyone;
John shakes him off, climbing into the driver’s seat of the Jeep and starting it up before he throws it into reverse. Sherlock stands, limp and dejected as he watches him drive away.

And then, finally, they’re home; and in rather rapid succession, in their bed.
He’s deep asleep when he’s jarred awake by a shadowy figure climbing over him in his bed. He starts violently, reaching up to grasp the figure’s arms, grappling them off his chest and to pin them against the mattress.
He tosses himself onto his back restlessly, the presence of an Alpha beginning to intensify the prickle of heat beneath his skin. The fabric of his shirt chafes unbearably against his nipples, so he shamelessly unbuttons it. “I apparently miscalculated the speed and severity with which they would arise.” Over the lean line of his belly, his eyes catch on the increasingly noticeable bulge in his trousers and a giggle escapes him. “Pun

Sherlock smiles tightly and pointedly wanders away toward the front of the pub, leaving John to handle the situation as he sees fit. Playing the role of the submissive, pliant Omega certainly has it’s moments of usefulness.

“It's not just sex!”
“Yes, just- I need…

“Hey,” John ventures tentatively from his perch at the top of the ladder. “Please tell me you got your pain slider set to zero.” Sherlock turns his eyes back down toward the street wordlessly, then gives the slightest nod.

Before he can formulate a response of any kind, John’s waving jauntily as he exits the flat. As Sherlock comes back to his senses, he scowls at the realization that his face is frozen in an embarrassingly obvious expression that Mycroft will pick apart immediately. He drifts over to the window in avoidance, peering out through the curtains onto the street below.

Which leaves them holed up for the second night in a row at NSY, poring over the case files with a handful of officers for any in sort of clue as to where he might have gone, a drowsy hush is settling over the room as the hours creep by. John perches on the tabletop next to Sherlock, legs dangling as he sips at his third cup of coffee and pages through a dense folder. His thigh brushes against Sherlock’s elbow with every gentle sway of his leg, and while Sherlock’s aware that it

How intriguing— the oestral aggression toward perceived sexual rivals apparently carries over even to the imaginary. That’s considerably more significant than his research had implied. Twenty years after the fact, and still; the absurdly illogical Omega side of him wants to grab the girl by the hair, and yank her unceremoniously off of
He strips Sherlock out of his pristine white wedding suit, laying kisses upon every inch of newly exposed skin as the omega shivers delicately beneath him. Despite his eagerness all those weeks ago, Sherlock is oddly shy now, with the light from the fire and the candles on the bedside table as baring him fully to John’s eyes. Ivory thighs tremble slightly when he parts those long, colt-like legs, and he stops, propping himself up on one elbow.
He should march up the stairs this very moment, burst into John’s bedroom and plainly announce that they are, however unexpectedly, expecting a child.

John arrives home unexpectedly early from his shift at the surgery, and immediately bustles him out of the flat with a sly grin.

And he is. He’s been managing Harry ever since her questionable gift first made itself known, just after her fourteenth birthday. Him barely a year younger, spending his weekends helping her wobble home from whatever party she’d landed herself at that time round. Back when he still tried using his own gift to stop her.
“Wait,” John’s face scrunches up in confusion. “What are we doing that you need to smell like an authoritative Alpha for?”
Mike beams.
He just barely manages to hold back his laughter at Mycroft’s mask of barely controlled revulsion. Of course! He’d forgotten entirely how overpowering the mixed scents of their copulation must be to Mycroft’s unaccustomed nose.
He’s drawn to the slight layer of cushioning over John’s belly as if magnetically; hands unable to resist stroking, mouth unable to resist nuzzling. It feels perfect beneath his cheek (firm but somewhat yielding) when he pillows his head on it as they lie in bed, John rhythmically petting his curls until he drifts off to sleep.

Sorry for the ridiculous wait on this one folks. I took a bit of an unexpected hiatus there for various reasons (including the cardinal sin of getting distracted by writing something new). Thank you all so much for all the lovely comments and kudos and for subscribing despite it appearing I'd abandoned this— they definitely made me push through to try and finish this off despite everything. If I never replied to your comment, my apologies! Each and every one of them are deeply appreciated, despite my less than stellar response skills... I just get a bit overwhelmed (nottoolateforthegame, if you're reading this-- your flood of comments was an absolute treat!). I was trying to hold out on posting this chapter until I was finished the final one as well to avoid any more big gaps, but I'd like to get this up to motivate myself to wrap things up. Like I mentioned, it's unbetaed, so please do let me know if you notice any glaring errors!

Two armed men burst into the room; one Beta and an Alpha who’s clearly his superior. The Alpha holds his gun steady and level as he coolly commands Sherlock to place his hands behind his head, and Irene to kneel. Sherlock gapes as a second Beta ushers John into the room at gunpoint. John peers up at him as they enter and sheepishly apologizes.
Just because he’d… helped him-
“Oh, is that how it’s going to be now?” Sherlock demands. “You think you can just make decisions for me now?”
“Couldn’t we just go to a café?” John queries the woman in a playful tone as she leads him wordlessly through to the upper levels. “Sherlock doesn’t follow me
“God, there’s a horrifying image,” John grimaces in a deliberate attempt to distract from the small burble of unease creeping up inside of him at the thought of
“Yeah?” Lestrade's eyes harden. “And if you come along and something happens to you? You think that wouldn't be front page news by morning? And that's my job there— yours too. We're lucky Mycroft ever gave his permission for you to consult for us. That’d all go up in smoke in a blink.” Lestrade crosses his arms mulishly and raises his brows.
A hike up Brixton High Street and a short tube ride later he's back at his flat in Clapham. watching a rather unappetizing looking plate of leftovers rotate in the microwave, when his phone buzzes in his pocket. It buzzes again insistently as he’s pulling it out.
“Hardly,” Sherlock smirks. “Besides, I already knew you started up again two weeks ago.”
“My betrothed. It was to be announced at the culmination of tonight’s festivities. But, oh dear,” Sherlock looks down at his dishevelled garments and splotchy, reddened neck as if in surprise. “It does appear that I’ve been quite thoroughly ruined. I suppose now you’ll have to insist that I marry Captain Watson instead, Mycroft. Unless of course, Lord Wycombe, you’re content with possibility of a cuckoo inheriting the family seat.”
Logically, he’s aware that John’s never exhibited any interest in a fellow Alpha; female or otherwise. But he’s also never met

He’s yet to meet the infamous ‘Consulting Detective’ who haunts the labs and mortuary of Bart's like a particularly inquisitive ghost; though, judging by the stories he’s heard, that's quite fortunate. He’s been hard pressed to understand what has sweet, considerate Molly so beguiled. A pretty face goes a long way in explaining things.
“Do what?” John gently taunts as he crosses his arms, turning to lean his hips back against the countertop. Sherlock takes a small steadying breath and steps closer, right into John’s personal space.
Though he does pointedly light the candle on their table with a grin, and brings out a lovely bottle of wine for them; “on the house!”

?” John leans close to whisper irreverently in Sherlock’s ear as they follow the man through the front hall. Sherlock snorts quietly, biting his lip to contain his amusement.
John seeks out the library immediately upon his arrival, determined to enjoy every last moment he has with his friend to the fullest. As expected, he finds the omega already awaiting him, curled up indecorously in one of the reading chairs by the mantle, staring distractedly into the flames.
“We already know where she is,” Mycroft replies with a disinterested sniff. “As you were kind enough to point out, it hardly matters.”
“Well,
it that no one ever expects John's stubborn streak? He may be recognized as an Alpha, but his inclination to behave like one seems to be constantly underestimated.
omega; much less Sherlock.”
How easy it would be for Mycroft to send his goons to bundle Sherlock off to some blandly elegant, tightly controlled facility tucked away in the Alps, never to see John again. Not unlike his ultimate solution to Sherlock’s drug abuse. And perhaps to Mycroft’s way of thinking this
“I confiscate it.” Sherlock counters, as though that settles the matter. And for the moment it does. Completely inexplicably, Irene begins to question them about the death of hiker, leaving Sherlock uncommonly flustered, and before long, John is being ordered from the room.
“Ah,” John nods understandingly, then settles back, his shoulder pressing comfortably against Sherlock’s. “She’s not a bad bird- I feel like a bit of a arse. Met her at The Quagmire, so-”
And then, just as he’s begun considering giving the phone over to Mycroft and washing his hands of it, an unfamiliar woman appears at their doorstep and whisks John away with her.
John refuses to answer. This is a road that he cannot allow himself to trod upon; one that only leads to heartache. He sits up a touch straighter and warily clasps Sherlock’s hips, gently applying a forward pressure in a renewed effort to unseat the omega.
“It’s commonplace for alpha’s attempting to seem more authoritative to use scent enhancers. When it’s applied heavily it’s mistaken for that, and disregarded without further thought. In the unlikely case that they
All things considered, he thinks he’s doing a rather excellent job of affecting nonchalance, especially given the veritable miasma of anxiety wafting off of John. At least one of them has to keep up appearances if they have any hope of manipulating Mycroft into agreement.

Sherlock shudders with arousal at the explicit instruction and it’s juxtaposition with John's usual propriety, a bloom of heat twinging low in his belly as he rolls his hips downward in a slow grind. The motion makes the blunt head of John’s cock rub
“Listen, I have to be quick,” he begins without preamble. “I spoke to Molly.”
“Good. Now, I'd like a few moments with my brother, if you will.” He dismisses her, and she scurries from the room, eyes firmly clapped to the titles while he crosses over to stand at Sherlock’s beside. “Well brother mine, I hadn't thought that my days as the svelte one would be quite so limited. I hope the recent ban on my presence doesn’t extend to these circumstances?”
“I believe that we’ll be quite alright for the time being Mrs. Danvers. Thank you,” Mycroft politely dismisses his housekeeper when she inquires as to whether any tea or refreshments are required, preemptively cutting Irene off just as she opens her mouth. With an amused lift of her brows, Irene pointedly places the camera phone down on the table top between them.
“No, never with a man,” Sherlock confesses with a small smile, then hesitates for instant before he adds, “never...

well, it was entirely possible that it he would be discomfited enough by it to move out. And Sherlock would do anything to ensure John’s continued presence. He’d decided then and there that he would carefully archive his newly collected data regarding sexual desire and copulation away in his mind palace, and immediately resume his appropriate suppressant dosage. That would resolve the matter neatly, and keep John where he belonged: at 221B.
“No Sherlock. These feelings… it’s biological, just as you said. They’re very natural, and there’s nothing wrong with them, but they would be better suited directed toward someone else.”
“God, that’s such bollocks.” John scrunches his face in distaste. “Well, I did know some, but I only ever dated the one actually. Tisha Hughes. We met at Uni; she was close friends with one of my flatmates, and training to be a nurse, so we had some common ground. It wasn't that we never slept together— I mean, it was university, and we were both young and fit. But sharing a heat seemed a bigger step, y’know? Because I was an Alpha instead of a Beta, and neither of us had done before, I think we thought it might be harder to resist the bonding urge. We’d been dating maybe six months when... she meant to surprise me. Or, at least, that’s what she said afterwards…” John snorts and concedes sarcastically, “Mind, I did get quite the surprise.”
very unlikely Sherlock — Very bloody unlikely. You're practically carrying a National Lottery winner.”
“Thank you,” Sherlock softly replies.
Sherlock laughs this time, full-bodied and unselfconscious; he knows an olive branch when he sees one.
“Oh.” Sherlock blinks rapidly in response, awkward silence stretching out between them as the minutes tick by without him saying anything further. John's just beginning to seriously contemplate throwing himself out of the moving vehicle and making his own way back to London when Sherlock suddenly breaks the silence with a sudden flood of words.
“You had no right!” Sherlock thunders as he bangs into the flat, John close at his heels. He snatches his scarf from where it hangs around his neck and whips it furiously across the room at his chair. “None whatsoever, interfering like that!”
I liiiiive! My sincerest apologies to for the extremely late update! I'd expected I was going to be a day or two behind thanks to Canada Day, and the craziness of my new position at work, but then my Mum landed herself in the hospital on top of it all. Needless to say, writing has been the least of my worries lately! I've been plugging away whenever I've had the chance (or the energy), but it was embarrassingly slow going. Thank you to everyone who's been commenting, leaving kudos and subscribing!!! I logged in for the first time yesterday to find that this has more than 100 subscribers now, which sort of blew me away. You're all wonderful and I appreciate you joining me on this little experimental venture of mine and hanging in there with me while life made it's own plans!
He frowns down at the sight that greets him when he pushes open the door.
“And yet here you are,” Sherlock replies. A crooked, bashful smile of his own tugs at the corners of his mouth, as the first hesitant stirrings of hope start up inside his chest. John tilts his head agreeably, his grin growing impossibly brighter and warmer. So bright, in fact, that it’s almost painful to look at.
In his brief bursts of energy, he finds himself either fitfully composing a new lullabye on his violin, or attempting to crack the passcode of Irene’s mobile. The later is especially unsuccessful, which only serves to frustrate him further.
“You’re just what?”
The corner of Mycroft’s mouth quirks up in a genuine smile, the likes of which Sherlock hasn't seen in years.
As Mycroft’s eyes make their way down the page, his eyebrows rise further up into his browline.
Though John seems terribly distracted by the thought of the photographs in question, Sherlock’s quite thoroughly disinterested. Blackmail?
“An admirable trait,” they respond with a smile as he fits the mask to his face and efficiently ties it in place.
He tosses his coat carelessly over arm of the sofa and drifts to his room in a fog. Shrugging out of his suit jacket, he lets it fall to the floor— his entire outfit will need to go out to the cleaners before he can wear it again in any case. Unless he cares to run about stinking of Omega in heat.
“I really don’t see how that’s any of your business,” Mycroft scowls stiffly.
He hadn't honestly expected to have been able to keep it secret for this long; he’d been so concerned that John would catch him out too soon. But here they are at twelve weeks, and John remains resolutely, steadfastly

“Mary,” John states, as if that remotely answers Sherlock’s question whatsoever. “That's... My wife's name was Mary,” he elaborates, staring out across the beach at the water. “She died just two years ago. So we had the opportunity to stay, in St. Juniperus. Pass over. She didn't take it. Didn't
After what feels like an age, Sherlock’s hands finally trail lower, to where pale gold grows darker and coarser. He gives a pleased hum and shuffles backward slightly, to rest his bottom on John’s thighs instead. Long fingers don’t hesitate as they unfasten the falls of John’s pantaloons, and peel the fabric down to expose the Alpha’s thick, engorged member for the first time. His eyes widen at the sight of it.
Neither of them make any attempt at the customary polite conversation as they navigate through the steps of the cotillion, but he is left with no doubts as to the focus of their attention regardless. Their gaze remains fixed on him all the while; boring into him intently from behind that glittering black mask. The focus is almost hypnotic; he finds himself so driven to distraction that he even forgets to look for Sherlock in the crowd. As the last notes of the dance fade away, he finds himself in loathe to yet bid his mystery partner adieu.
so long as his mouth is otherwise occupied.”
“Yeah?” John beams across the table at him elatedly.
“A Consulting Detective? What does that mean? I’ve never heard of it before.”
“Alright,” he announces upon his return, setting the two steaming mugs down on the table top. “But we

A silver car-like vehicle creeps up slowly alongside the kerb beside them, it’s doors sliding open to reveal it’s driverless interior. The nurse takes the man’s cane as he climbs in, gingerly easing himself into one of the passenger seats. She passes it back to him once he’s seated, and he smiles gratefully as she plunks herself down next to him.
She frowns in dismay and looks to Sherlock, who keeps his face carefully blank, despite the twinge of hurt that spikes in his chest at John’s words, smiling blandly in agreement as he plucks another biscuit from the plate.

He opens his mouth to argue, but John rounds him off before he can.
“No, absolutely not,” Lestrade interrupts, clapping one hand down on Sherlock’s shoulder when he goes to rise. “
He doesn’t have to wait long; the next contraction gripping Sherlock’s muscles within a handful of minutes. Once it’s over, John gives his hand a comforting squeeze and tips his head up to grin at him.
He wraps a hand around himself and hisses, his hips immediately bucking involuntarily upward.
“Oh!” Irene exclaims as if just having recalled something of importance, “Jim Moriarty sends his love.” Irene announces with a delighted sneer, and Sherlock raises his head attentively in his seat.
“Sorry?” The man stares up at him in startled confusion.

“I’m flattered.” She continues, her grin growing ever-wider at over John’s ignorance.
“An experiment?” John questions, heart beating loudly enough in his ears to nearly drown out the sound of his own voice. Sherlock nods, continuing to avoid John’s eyes as he continues, reaching between them to fiddle with one of John’s buttons.
Sherlock frowns and looks down in surprise to where his hand has instinctively come to rest, in a protective gesture, over his abdomen.
Sherlock fingers still and he looks up apprehensively as John trails off.
“Um…” she bites her lip anxiously, suddenly wide-eyed. “Maybe we should go get tea?”

In a busy server bay at HLMS Systems, a small fleet of robotic arms work diligently, transferring cylindrical memory cells into permanent storage. The walls of the bay twinkle like the night sky, the lights of thousands upon thousands of cells flickering in the walls of their system housings. A distinguished older gentleman leans on an umbrella at the end of the corridor, overseeing the installation of a new consciousness into a panel of the casing labeled SAINT JUNIPERUS 1895. The newest cell, SJ 221B - 1023, plugs neatly into it’s place on the panel, the LEDs ringing it’s faceplate oscillating in a circuitous motion all the while.
In his armchair, Sherlock cringes internally at the unneeded reminder.
Sherlock looks across the table to John, who offers an expectant lift of his brows.
“It is,” Sherlock tips his head toward John in confirmation.
“Good,” John croons approvingly, rocking his own erection against Sherlock’s hip in a leisurely motion. He works his fingers inside of Sherlock faster. “Does that feel good?”

He can see John retreating further and further into himself by the moment— his shoulders tensing and pulling together.

“No,” Sherlock grants with a sad smile. “Father died quite suddenly in a traffic accident when I was sixteen, about a year after I first presented,” he reveals, the words still triggering an ache of sorrow in his chest, even all these years later. “Mycroft became the Holmes Alpha Familiae and, to everyone’s complete surprise, he immediately arranged for me to begin taking suppressants. It had been expected that he’d simply carry on in Father’s footsteps

and which did you guess?"
“Yes,” Sherlock confirms, dropping his eyes to stare intently at the fabric of John’s waistcoat; the only tell of any sort of self-consciousness. “I hadn't intended it as any sort of trickery,” he rushes to add. “I'd only meant to use the disguise to gather some observations on the influence of perceived anonymity upon social behaviour. But then you didn't recognize me and… It was only meant to be an experiment.”
"Come,” he beckons, pulling John backward toward the bed with him. When the backs of his legs bump up against the mattress he drops to sit, and John steps into the welcoming vee of his legs seamlessly. He pulls John down for another kiss, as his hands creep between them, setting to work on John’s belt. When he finally pushes aside the files of John’s trousers and palms the growing erection tenting the front of the plain, serviceable cotton pants beneath, John pulls back with a hiss.

He enters the pin into the real mobile as he walks back toward the table, then stops and stares incredulously as the phone beeps in his hand just as the dupe had. He raises his eyes from the screen to find Irene smirking triumphantly up at him with crossed arms.
“Quite.” Sherlock agrees with a smirk. “Well, that's all for now,” he declares with a decisive clap of his hands. “I'm off then.”
“Hamish,” he announces suddenly from his seat at the desk, and Sherlock turns to him in confusion

He shouts, bending forward to cradle his head in his hands and tug ruthlessly at his hair. The older woman sitting across from him startles, shooting him a scandalized look across the carriage. “Sorry, sorry,” he offers, shamefaced, before he gets up and makes his way up the aisle to wait by the doors as they arrive at the next station.
John merely blinks back at him dumbly, and Sherlock finds himself babbling on in a fluster.
John breathes deeply through his nose and takes a measured sip of tea to keep himself from showing any reaction. Sherlock’s eyes flicker rapidly back and forth, the way they do sometimes when he’s thinking, snapping toward the kiss for the barest moment before he begins to speak. He rapidly delivers his conclusion in a tone that, as always, implies it to be painfully obvious and then lifts his eyes from the screen to focus in on John expectantly.
“When?”
“No. Well- I, um -” Sherlock shakes his head spastically, fumbling for the right thing to say and John takes pity on him.
Five weeks after what he’s privately come to think of as ‘The Absolute Worst Mistake of His Life’, John Watson meets Irene Adler and summarily curses whatever higher power it is out there that- as he’s long suspected, but is now sure- has it in for him.
John cuts Sherlock off with a roar. “I was with her for forty-nine years. You can’t

him once again. And every time, he cuts those thoughts off as abruptly as they arise, thoroughly disgusted with himself. Contrary to his own inclinations, John had obliged Sherlock in a moment of need, and rather than being grateful, Sherlock was scheming as to how he might persuade him into doing so again? He was behaving no better than the worst stereotype of a grasping, manipulative Omega.
Most people who take him for a beta are idiots; easily fooled by a liberal application of scent neutralizer, his seeming independence, and the confidence he wields without hesitation. Molly's never counted amongst those.
It's a good feeling.
When John takes his red herring about taking out a safety deposit box at face value, and quickly concocts a delightfully thorough plan to deliver the flat, Sherlock can’t help but feel a little swell of pride in his chest.
one bearing the Holmes name — is another thing altogether. A niggling anxiety lurks insidiously at the edges of his thoughts and churns in his gut. He's assured John that Mycroft will agree to go along with Sherlock’s scheme and grudgingly accept the child as his heir— but what if he's

to Irene Adler- and found wanting. He’s so thrown by it that he checks out of their witty little repartee until Irene taunts him back to attention with four little words.
“Now let’s see just what our elusive Mr. Goldritch has been up to.”
“Go on. Impress a girl.” Irene says, leaning over Sherlock’s shoulder to press a kiss against the perfect curve of his cheekbone.
“Yes, I did,” John replies firmly. “I don’t care if you’ve heard it before or not. You shouldn’t have to hear it at

would suffice. For someone so otherwise demanding Sherlock is always so recalcitrant when it comes to this.
He’s saved from having to elaborate any further in their current, awkwardly semi-public setting when the cab comes to a sudden halt, pulling up to the kerb. Taking a closer look at their surroundings, Sherlock’s startled to find that they’ve arrived back on Baker Street without his notice.
“I told you–” she grins wolfishly, “I misbehave.”
” John declares contemptuously to the ceiling as he flops back bodily against his pillow with a huff.
Wordlessly, Sherlock arches sideways over the arm of the chair, and reaching down to retrieve something wedged beneath it. As he brings it up to eye level, the object resolves itself by the light of the fire to a familiar black, feathered mask. The breath catches in John’s throat. Sherlock
“Sherlock,” he cautions sternly, “I told you. We can’t.”

The anger dissipates almost instantly; replaced instead by exhaustion.
“And precisely how long ago did this
John can be in the midst of something as innocuous as making tea or washing dishes, and Sherlock needs only look over to find himself recalling those small, confident hands pressing him down and taking him apart. He’s spent more time holed up in his bedroom over the past several weeks, breathlessly wanking, than he’d ever done as a teenager. It's
“Thanks for seeing us on such short notice Mr. Cavendish,” Lestrade shakes it politely, then turns to gesture at John and Sherlock in introduction. “These are two of our consultants, Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson. They’ll be joining us for the interview if you have no objections.”
Sherlock’s last coherent thought is that the only thing more delightful than the
“Jesus. Sherlock, I could have attacked you! Pray remember, I was a soldier.”
“I suppose I’ve no choice but to try and meet your demands, Mr. Holmes,” John growls. He hitches Sherlock’s top leg higher and diligently sets to the task of dismantling Sherlock’s higher thought processes entirely.
about you,” Sherlock argues with a confused frown, as though John has just suggested something entirely preposterous.
“There’ll be more of them.” Sherlock ignores the question, trotting out of the room and out the front door. He can’t relax his guard quite just yet. “They’ll be keeping an eye on the building.”
“You left it in the pocket of your second-best dressing gown, you clot.” She laughs, resting her head on her hand tiredly. “I managed to sneak it out when they thought I was having a cry.” He gawks between the two of them, completely bewildered as Sherlock thanks her and tosses it in the air jauntily before tucking it into his coat.
Ah, well. Something like this was

for pity’s sake!
“Okay Sarah, this is just not on- do I have to red light you?” He questions, spreading his palms out in supplication.
When John simply barks a cold laugh in reply, and offers her a napkin to cover herself with, something inside of Sherlock curls up and whimpers. The rejection stings more than he thought it would, and he sneers internally at that pathetic Omega part of himself in an attempt to dampen the feeling.
“Sherlock, can you hear me?” John’s words filter through to him fuzzily, as if from a distance. Squinting up at him blearily, Sherlock attempts to reply in the affirmative, but it comes out as more of a senseless groan. From somewhere nearby, Irene’s voice cuts in.

Never let it be said that there isn’t a significant flair for the dramatic in the Holmes blood.

The Alpha begins his count.
just as the pistol in the safe above him fires. John’s would-be executioner is struck in the chest and Sherlock’s Omega crows in vicious triumph, even as he disarms the Alpha and violently smashes the butt of the gun into the man’s face. Irene neatly dispatches her own captor in the meantime, and while she’s distracted, Sherlock slips her mobile into his pocket.
The back of his neck prickles as he shifts restlessly from one foot to the other. His own feelings on the subject certainly don’t help matters. He hates how much he
“And what she said, about Mycroft spoiling you...” John begins and Sherlock huffs impatiently and cuts him off.
He flounders for a moment, searching for something to say that won't have him inadvertently laying his heart at John’s feet. Nothing he thinks of seems especially safe, and so, he awkwardly launches back into exposition instead, as if they’d never veered off on a tangent to begin with. “It’s a synthesized reproduction of Mycroft’s scent; a formulation of my own design. Incredibly useful for getting into places normally off-limits to Omegas. I originally devised it in university, to enable myself to safely loiter in… less than savoury places.”
He wakes up again to John gently shaking him awake.
“Oh Captain Watson!” she smoothly attaches herself to his arm and informs him happily from behind the flutter of her fan. “I’ve discovered several lovely prospects for you to consider. I’ll ensure that you’re invited to all the necessary engagements coming up, so that we can introduce you to them all.”
more,” she snidely promises Mycroft, holding that thrice-damned cameraphone up to face him. “On this phone I’ve got secrets, pictures and scandals that could topple your whole world. You have no idea how much havoc I can cause and exactly one way to stop me… unless you want to tell your masters that your biggest security leak is your own Omega dependens.”
As John nears completion, he feels his knot swelling and dithers, slowing his hips. While he knows it to be his responsibility as an alpha to bond his omega to himself, he's never done before, and he hesitates to cause his lover any pain.
His body's grown used to John’s, and all the lovely things that it does to it. But he grits his teeth and follows through, refusing to allow John to continue to slavishly subject himself to his selfish desires. No— he’s above such neediness and physicality. He's lasted years without John's touch, and is perfectly capable of abstaining from it again until he's returned to a less ungainly state. It’s all just transport after all.
“But…” John scents the air thoroughly in confusion. No, he's definitely not mistaken. “It absolutely

“Officer in need of assistance!” A garbled voice shouts over a frenetic background din. “All units respond! Suspect headed toward the east exit of the building— armed and extremely dangerous!”
John hums in approval and leans back in slot his lips against Sherlock’s again. The kiss starts chastely, but before long his tongue is teasing against the plump swell of Sherlock’s lower lip, seeking entry. Sherlock moans unthinkingly as he opens to it, and shuffles his knees forward, giving himself over to the frantic drive to press himself against the solid Alpha body before him.
“I do apologize; my meeting ran over,” Mycroft sighs long-suffering, closes the folder in his hands and sets it aside, then looks up and starts. While he’d most assuredly kept up his usual surveillance of Sherlock during his absence, it’s apparent that the grainy CCTV footage hadn’t quite translated the extent of the changes in Sherlock’s form. The child has grown exponentially in the past few weeks, as evidenced by Sherlock’s now prodigiously swollen middle.
“So; we know that you’re a soldier, injured, and only recently returned to England, with lightened hair and darkened skin. The Empire has been engaged in an ongoing conflict against Napoleon’s forces on the Iberian Peninsula, with it’s markably warmer climes, for some years now. Which brings us to my original question: Spain or Portugal? Perhaps you would you be willing to answer a few questions for me. I’ve been trying to get my hands on more details about the conflict, but Mycroft is a
In another place altogether, a young man in a red convertible speeds down a winding seaside road, the wind whipping his dark curls into a riotous halo. He screeches to a halt outside a neat row of townhouses along the beach, laying on the horn mercilessly.
After John’s knot had finally receded, he’d clambered out of bed to retrieve both the agreed upon condoms, and a damp flannel for Sherlock to clean up with. Sherlock hadn’t protested in the slightest, his limbs by that point quite uselessly numb from the pressure of John’s body on top of him.
“Thanks, mate. That would be great.” Lestrade calls back, settling down across from Sherlock in John’s chair. Sherlock pulls his dressing gown tighter about himself with one hand and pointedly ignores him.
“They tell me three months. It's spread basically everywhere,” John explains matter-of-factly. “Though, they’d said three months about six months ago. So, who knows?” John reaches out to steal the cigarette from Sherlock’s fingers, lifting it to his lips to take a puff. “Doesn't even taste of anything,” he marvels, staring down at it as he breaths out.

“Soon as he’s figured out... whatever it is, he’ll just sort of… switch back on again.” He informs her as he strides back into the sitting room, shrugging into his jacket. “He doesn’t have any concept of time when he’s having a think like this, though, so it’s anyone’s guess when that’ll be. But generally he just starts up, mid-conversation.”
there?”
“Oh.” He has no idea what to say to
“I like women too,” John’s quick to point out, and Sherlock gives a mild huff of irritation.
In concession to the change of eras, he switches up his wardrobe and appearance slightly. The wool trousers swapped out out for close-fitting dark denims, and his shirt for a more casual striped cotton number, the first two buttons undone. His hair he wears shorter; the better tamed curls giving him an oddly boyish appearance.
“We’ve been listening. She said she told you,” the Alpha asserts without so much as a trace of uncertainty in his expression, and Sherlock feels the first flutter of trepidation in his gut.
It may have been years, but he still recognized
"Sorry?"
“D’you just carry on talking when I’m away?” John’s amused voice ponders through the laptop speakers, entirely unperturbed by Sherlock’s outburst. The fondly indulgent nature of it makes Sherlock’s heart flutter discomfitingly. He shrugs flippantly as he turns back to the screen, the corners of his mouth twitching upward despite his attempt to remain aloof.
“Yes. She is.” Sherlock puzzles, not at all sure where John is going with this.

“Oh yes— how remiss of me!” Sherlock scoffs icily. “However did I overlook the

Everyone’s heads swivel to the doorway, where Mycroft stands framed in the light from the hall looking faintly aggrieved.
John has him on his side in bed in an effort to accommodate his ever-increasing bulk, pressing close and driving into his body from behind.
“I spoke with Mummy yesterday,” Mycroft breaks the silence. “I couldn't help but note you haven't yet shared your happy announcement with her.”
“Ah yes,” Stamford winces. “Come to think of it, I did hear she had some recent misfortune at the gaming tables. Dreadful business— Is it really so bad as that then?”
Again, the frown.
“Yes,” John urges, “that’s it my love. That’s it.”
The Alpha narrows his eyes and waits a beat before addressing his men. “You two, go to the car.”
Just because some ridiculous, backward la— ” Sherlock cuts him off with a staying hand before he can work himself into a lather.
Sherlock’s eyes flick toward him, softening momentarily.
"Mmm, yes."
He’s never been more sure of anything in his life.
John laughs at that, than quiets down and gives Sherlock a thoughtful sidelong glance. “Why didn’t you tell me,” he asks, “about Mycroft?”
“Well, don’t just bloody
“You knew that they were meeting here.”
the slow descent and bob of Sherlock head, rather than pulling.
“You become remarkably religious when you’re irritated. Did you know that?” He announces, and John’s soft laugh sends a shiver through him. “Is there anything that could stop it?” He asks plaintively, partly out of real desperation, and partly to distract from his reaction to John’s touch.
He tucks his chin in contemptuously, not unlike that of an offended turtle. He’d assumed from her silence throughout the drive that his scent hadn’t yet grown distinct enough for her to detect through the small openings in the safety partition. Clearly, however, he's progressed somewhat farther along than he’d gauged.
“Hello, Doctor Watson.” Irene Adler purrs, and Sherlock’s own surprise is mirrored in John, who answers in a low angry growl.
Finally, John slumps on top on of him, face buried in Sherlock’s neck and chest heaving from the exertion. Sherlock lets his legs go slack about his waist, but leaves his ankles crossed loosely, to avoid jostling them where they’re joined. John’s somewhat heavier than expected, but Sherlock finds the warm weight pressing him down into the mattress to be oddly comforting rather than stifling. He hums contentedly and absently rubs his palms over John’s back.
“Um, sampling the trial version, more like,” she amends. “I've only known him the past three years... We talk- on the comm box. He told you how he ended up quadriplegic? And how long he's been that way?” She asks as she helps John to his seat, and he shakes his head. She places her tea down, and hesitates for only a moment. “One night, when he was eighteen and home on break from uni, he came out to his parents. They’re quite conservative; Thatcherites, you know. They told him they didn’t want a…,” she blushes crimson, “
“I’m aware of it,” Mycroft acknowledges snappishly.
For once he and his inner Omega are entirely in agreement, and it’s all that he can do to keep himself from panting with lust. It’s truly a wonder he doesn’t spontaneously combust; if he weren’t already pregnant, he’s fairly certain that the level of arousal would easily have sent him into a faux-heat, suppressants or no.
“More unusual than you miscalculating, even. When was the first day of your last placebo pill cycle?” John asks in the no-nonsense, shameless tone of Doctors everywhere, despite the unquestionably intimate nature of the question.
Sherlock's expression is endearingly bewildered; eyes blown wide and fixed in on her as though John doesn’t even exist. The Alpha inside of John positively seethes, and it takes everything he has to keep it hidden below his surface. He makes some childish quip about
“Excuse me?”
So it’s a welcome enough diversion when an old schoolmate calls his name in the park, in spite of the humiliation of being seen as he is now; a crippled shadow of his former self.
Sherlock waits a few moments for dramatic effect before letting out a short hum and coolly announcing, “I’ve always assumed that the bother of heats and breeding was all just a distasteful inconvenience. Thank you for confirming that for me.”
“And after a couple of months, then what?”
If Sherlock didn’t know better, he’d almost say it was bitterness.
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock draws himself as upright as possible, “what is
pick up a hint of my own diminished scent beneath the artificial one, they’ll assume it’s the scent of a bond. I’m sure I wouldn’t pull anything over on a perfumer or pheromonist, but the general populace is hardly so discerning.”
“Alright, alright! I’m up! Just give me a moment,” John pushes himself upright and scrubs his hands over his face and hair to rouse himself properly. Sherlock watches as he hurriedly stretches, paying special attention to his bad shoulder, then shrugs into the jumper tossed over the foot of the bed. A thought materializes without warning in Sherlock’s mind, and he blinks rapidly, momentarily shell-shocked by it.
The next few weeks pass sluggishly. The morning sickness comes and goes in waves throughout the day, making the consumption of anything more substantial than toast and tea
“Very well,” Mycroft offers a repentant nod. “I do apologize for the insult Dr. Watson. But I do believe we’re getting away from the issue at hand.” He turns his attention back to his brother and gives a supercilious sniff. “Am I given to understand then, that the use of…

“Oh.” John remarks somewhat dumbly, and sinks down onto the sofa beside her, an oddly intrigued expression on his face. He asks her about policemen and she responds with something tiresome about detectives and brainy being the new sexy that’s clearly meant to be provocative. Sherlock’s too preoccupied with their nearness, and the little smile John quirks at her quip to care.
In his seat, Sherlock squeezes his eyes shut with a grimace, a rush of pained mortification making his gut contract in a disagreeable manner.
“Well, it’s hardly his place, is it?” Eddie replies incredulously, an agitated flush beginning to creep up his neck in reaction to the scent of a hostile fellow Alpha within his own territory. “Surely you don’t think that it’s

“That’s brilliant; it really is. You never cease to amaze me,” John comments as he rolls down his window. The crisp countryside air is an immediate relief from both the overpowering stench of Alpha and the retroactive, protective anger simmering inside him. He sucks in a deep lungful of it gratefully. “But did you have to use so
,” Sherlock whinges.
surprising.
“Waiting for someone?” She fishes with a winsome smile. John looks up and runs an assessing glance over her form before he shrugs casually.
The Alpha gestures casually to his subordinate man to hold off. Sherlock suppresses the urge to grimace. He has less desire than ever to play her idle games, but he'll do whatever it takes to save John's life. He pulls up an image in his mind, carefully analysing it as he turns slowly back toward the safe. He can’t afford to make a mistake. With no small degree of apprehension, he reaches out and haltingly punches in six digits.
” John persists.
It isn’t until he gets up to his room that the violin starts up again; soft, and achingly beautiful this time, instead of the discordant screeching of before. He tries desperately to cling to his anger and resentment, but his resolve quickly melts away under the warmth of the unspoken apology carrying up the stairs.
John helps with what he can, mildly distracted the whole while, then heads back home to the flat. He thinks at first that it might possibly have something to do with the case- the Omega and her lack of freedom, perhaps- but they’ve had plenty of cases with Omegas, and Sherlock’s never seemed affected by them before.

“Well then, I'll leave you to it.” He pats the bed rail once and gives a curt nod. Then he turns sharply on heel, and leaves the room without a backward glance.
“There’s more

Are you guys ready for these two fools to admit their feelings? Because I sure am!
“But it’s far more diverting to defile the sitting room, brother mine,” he offers smugly as he belts the robe shut over the small swell of his midsection.
And of course, that’s when all hell breaks loose.
“You have a passcode to open this,” Mycroft’s states calmly before his tone drops, taking on the menacing quality of barely contained Alpha threat. “I deeply regret to say we have people who can extract it from you.”
“Thank Christ I’d at least thought to put on my dressing gown before I headed back down,” John concludes with wry appreciation as he finishes off the last of his tea. Sherlock burrows his face into his pillow, shaking with laughter over John's harrowing account of dodging Mrs. Hudson’s motherly attentions on the landing.
Not the violitle, energy-expending gamble that it actually is.

“Oh my god, you ridiculous creature,” John's calloused hands cup his face and drag it downward, where chapped lips are waiting to press against his insistently. After a moment he pulls back, combing his fingers through Sherlock’s curls as he peppers lingering kisses along edge of his jaw and down the length of his neck. “I don’t think I
“There’s no misunderstanding,” the nurse interrupts waspishly. “Mr. Watson, you need to leave immediately. And
“Thank you, yes.” Mycroft murmurs without lifting his eyes from the paper.
John merely stares back at him for a moment then turns to his gaming partner and loudly announces, “Men’s room,” before hopping off the platform and taking off through the crowd.
“We reviewed the security footage from the grounds around the house,” Lestrade clears his throat suddenly, breaking the silence. He turns the folder about on the table and flips it open to reveal the capture of Eddie climbing the trellis. “We know that you returned to the house that night, Mr. Cavendish
He forces a pained laugh to disguise his unease. “Could you put something on, please? Anything at all,” he scornfully offers her the napkin in his hands. “A napkin?”
“Oh my,” she frowns, her free hand coming up to flutter against her breast in disbelief. Like her husband, she recovers quickly. “Well! If that’s the case, leave it to me to be your first line of offence,” she smiles and winks, “I’ll lead you safely into battle.”

“Sure.”
of John is very nice. His fingers brush over the dusting of tawny hairs beneath John’s navel, trailing down until he reaches the thick nest of curls that surround his erection. He wraps his hand around the scorching hot appendage and squeezes lightly. John moans unabashedly, then reaches down and draws Sherlock’s hand away.
“It was dark and scary…”
“I think that we may need to go to the hospital.”
“No reason at all.” John replies, the edge in his voice even stronger this time.
He’s just in the midst of suggesting that they begin investigating the comings and goings of the larger housepets in the area when Sherlock interrupts him with the rather startling announcement that he too had caught a glimpse of Henry’s demon hound.

Sherlock spreads his legs welcomingly and John settles between them, with a contented sigh into Sherlock’s mouth. He reaches down between their bodies to guide himself into place, rubbing his cock over the wet slit a few times, before finally pushing forward to sink in with a deep groan.
Try as he might, he can’t find it in him to even be irritated with Sherlock over their infiltration of Baskerville.

Sherlock looks oddly lost at that.

“Then you should be paying more attention,” Mycroft snipes. “She’s been at the centre of two political scandals in the last year, and recently ended the marriage of a prominent Alpha novelist by having an affair with both her and her beta bond-mate. Separately.”
“Oh yes. Ensuring the continuity of the family name, given the dangerous nature of his position, and his lack of a bondmate in his advancing age,“ Sherlock swirls his free hand about in an encompassing gesture, “All that rot.

Alpha, who managed to breed him in only one mating. He shifts from foot to foot disconcertedly as he tries to rein it in, but finds it far more difficult than usual to subdue it.
He can’t help feeling as though he's waiting for the other shoe to drop.
“Always.”
“You're not so bad,” Irene smirks back up at him, her lips curling artfully; the very picture of a preening, seductive Alpha. They stare at one another intensely, their faces entirely too close, and John half expects her to try and mount Sherlock any moment.
“Hey, I know you from somewhere...” she muses, squinting blearily up at him, “oh- Bart's!” she frowns taking unhappy swallow from her drink. “
“Oh, Mr Holmes...” she sighs breathily, “...if it was the end of the world

“Mmm,” John murmurs against the pale arch of muscle, as his fingers come up to work open the buttons of Sherlock’s shirt. He slips off the arm of the chair to kneel on the floor, rearranging Sherlock’s sprawled limbs for better access to his body. “You're really determined to put your brother's goodwill to the test aren't you?”
His mind fills with thoughts of Sherlock, he pulls back immediately, gasping.
The rattle of the fire escape draws Sherlock’s attention, and he casts a look over his shoulder to find John cautiously peering over at him, his face a mask of alarm.
“John,” Mary sighs heavily, “the first time you met her, you sat next to her for fifteen minutes without noticing she was there.”
"And I'm afraid that I am overdue to meet them,” he announces abruptly, rapping his heels together and offering a brief decorous bow. “I apologize for any unintended offense."
“I don't want you to,” Sherlock clamours to interrupt.
"Which bits?"
Sherlock growls in vexation. “You’re thinking far too
tell Mycroft I was excited to take the case.”
“Never.”
He freezes as his eyes adjust to the dim light provided by the smouldering remains of the fire in the hearth, and he realizes the identity of the intruder.
Quite the opposite.
Clearly the doctor, John, and now even Lestrade think nothing of it; but deep down, he can't deny the niggling sense of failure over the issue. He's such a miserable excuse for an Omega that he may be unable to bring his son into the world the proper way.
“Sounds like he takes after you, love,” John whispers into Sherlock’s ear with a giggle.
“Yes, well, that is generally how pregnancy works,” Sherlock snipes in reply, self-consciously tugging the edges of his coat together over his bump. “Don’t worry — you can go back to being the fat one soon enough. ”
John opens his mouth as if to say something, and Sherlock lowers his bow expectantly. He braces himself for something cruel and biting. Something to help snap him out of this pathetic infatuation.
“Ever since
It’s an arduous trek to Sherlock’s bedroom from there on out; hands moving to grapple clumsily with one another’s clothes while their mouths stay locked together. There’s a precarious moment, when they both attempt to toe off their shoes and socks at once, that they nearly end up in a tangle on the carpet, but they manage to keep one another upright by pausing to take turns. There’s a crash from somewhere by the dining table when Sherlock sends a shoe flying with a kick, and he pauses with John's earlobe pinched between his teeth as he deliberates whether anything especially concerning has been knocked over.
Interacting with
“John, you
He hasn’t even a mate or Apha Familiae here to supervise!”
“If I wanted to look at naked women, I’d borrow John’s laptop.” Sherlock counters with deliberate disinterest, stepping away from her with averted eyes to instead discreetly examine the mantelpiece.
Even more curious is Sherlock’s frequent aborted attempts at…
And that these meetings of theirs will then immediately cease, for propriety’s sake.
“Oh,” Mrs. Hudson collects herself and resumes filling their cups. “Well, you two always do like to do things a bit differently, don’t you? I’m sure you’ll sort it all out in time.”
John and his nurse make it back to Battersea Place before the travel pod is even due for return.
He squeezes the arms of his chair rhythmically beneath his fingers, in an effort to contain the anger roiling just below his deliberately placid surface, and watches silently as Irene triumphantly swans across the room to seat herself near the head of the table.
When he arrives at the address in question, however, he's thrown off guard by the bubbly older woman who greets him at the street door and directs him upstairs. He doesn’t quite know what he was expecting, but she most definitely wasn’t it. Far and away from some looming thug, she puts him more than anything else in mind of his Great Aunt Kitty.
He promptly lowers himself down again to resume mouthing at Sherlock’s neck. “It's called foreplay,” he adds, punctuating with a playful nip at taut muscle.

“Oh! And these,” Lestrade adds, digging into the bag again to pull out a number of salt and vinegar crisp packets. “John said you've been absolutely barmy for them lately. And they had them on offer when I nipped into Tesco Express for lunch.”
He’d attempted to brush it aside as he did the various irritating demands of his transport, but it had hatefully persisted until he’d finally grown agitated enough that even
As expected, Sherlock’s comfortably ensconced in front of the crackling fire in the hearth, staring contemplatively into the flames as he cradles a tumbler of amber liquid. John settles into the vacant armchair alongside the preoccupied detective, and sets to filling him in on Henry's well-being (not that Sherlock gives a damn), and the mysterious morse signal that he’d spotted earlier on the moor.

“And somebody loves you.” She announces snidely, and his eyes cut to Sherlock in alarm. He’s vaguely aware of her leaning forward in his periphery, but is too focused on gauging Sherlock’s reaction to care. The pronouncement doesn’t seem to register as important to Sherlock, thank god. But when John turns back to Irene and meets her mocking eyes he feels peculiarly vulnerable.
“Oh, you're lovely,” Sherlock professes, swaying infinitesimally toward John. For a brief, golden moment he considers it. “I can't.”
nights then.
He walks hesitantly, pausing now and again to peer into various shop-windows with a slightly overwhelmed expression. Behind him, the strains of a man and woman arguing grow closer, and he turns curiously toward the noise.
In his hand his phone sighs, and the sound rings out loudly through the empty corridor.
They arrive at the sleekly modern long-term care facility at the expected time, and a smartly-dressed young doctor is waiting to greet them just inside when they enter.
And John does too, if the moan that he lets out when he presses two fingers deep inside of Sherlock’s body is anything to go by.
“Mm, don’t worry,” he reassures the alpha with a chuckle, reaching down to palm his groin. “Not

“I'll be right back, love.” John murmurs with a small squeeze of his hand, and gets up. Sherlock nods settles back against the pillows, watching with slitted eyes as John disappears through the doorway and their newly cowed nurse slinks back in.
Eddie pales, one hand coming up to splay over his mouth.

The rest of the lacerations remain consistent with the use of a small, sharp-edged blade, just like the last one.” With hardly a pause, he switches back between subjects. ”We weren’t doing so before, and haven’t since the heat during which we conceived.”
It makes everything Alpha inside of him recoil in revulsion, his cock immediately going soft as he fights against the urge to gag.

“Yeah!” She agrees, bobbing her head before she babbles on cheerily, “I think it's lovely that you’ve come down here in person before he passes over! Even his parents don't come visit anymore. His brother does; but well... Sherlock doesn’t appreciate that very much so...”
remains unfussed. To say that one of their nurses is a touch unfriendly would be an understatement.
Sherlock knits his brow and forces himself to calm and focus. He scans John carefully, taking in every infinitesimal detail and tell that he can. As he does, John frowns, his eyes darting to Irene then back, and then he softens, smiling hesitantly up at Sherlock.
John remains utterly unfazed by his sudden display, and gives him a small, somewhat self-conscious smile as he raises his free hand to scratch lightly at his nape.
“Rest assured Captain; would it not attract considerably more scandal than the situation already at hand, and irreparably ruin my brother, I would not hesitate to call you out, as befitting of a scoundrel such as yourself.”
The working title of this chapter was “Shag City", nuff said. (And fair warning— we’re cutting straight to the chase right out of the gate.)

And he’d thought that John would hare off the moment he found out.
Ah yes, that’s why.
“Why?

to shag you?”
at him right now, the game will very immediately be up. Considering Mycroft’s likely reaction would be, the gesture would hardly end up being very comforting to John at all. So he keeps his hands and eyes to himself, and listens impassively to Mycroft as he continues blathering on.
The words rush through Sherlock’s mind, synapses firing at light speed.
“So it went easier this afternoon than I expected,” he comments, plunking himself down next to Sherlock on the sofa as he begins tucking into his food. “In the end, at least.”
“I want to,” he affirms, murmuring the words against John’s lips, “I want all of London to know that I belong to you."
“How?”
More importantly, he’ll be able to expand exponentially upon John’s wing. He has approximately seventeen minutes before John rouses. No time to lose. He raises a hand to stroke John’s hair and begins with itemizing all potential sexual acts and positions that John would likely be amenable to.
Sherlock stiffens.
“Is this your Alpha?” She disregards his advice, tilting her head curiously at John to consider him instead, her eyes flicking appraisingly over his form. “Interesting match.
“You know,” Sherlock elaborates, waggling his head, “two men, dancing.”
He’ll do anything, say anything, so long as John resumes what he was doing.
He bursts out the doors of the club, looking up and down the street as he crosses it for any sign of the taller man. “Have you seen a man?” He beseeches a young couple, chatting amiably up against the side of a parked car in front of him. “Mid-20s, dark curly hair, poncy black overcoat?”
he sneers the pronouncement of sentiment with a derisive curl of his lip. Lestrade peers at him with a strange expression while John stares fixedly down at the desktop, as if avoiding his eyes.
"I don’t know the code.”
But it hadn’t been.
“Of course I did,” he confirms with a wrinkle of his brow. “How else was I to have you?”
Sherlock looks up from his breakfast, expecting to see the light of understanding in John’s eyes, but instead finds his blogger staring at him blankly.
“Mmm,” Sherlock hums in agreement. He quite likes the idea of that. His own pheromones— compounds composed of infinitesimal molecules of himself— slipping up inside of John and triggering a surge of dopamine and serotonin, intoxicating him. Not unlike a cocaine high, but unfathomably better.
“Please John.” Sherlock repeats himself quietly, leaning close to press soft, featherlight kisses against the curve of John’s resistant mouth. Hearing his Christian name from Sherlock’s lips stills something in him that’s never before quieted. With a final wary glance at the door, he tightens he buries a hand in those gleaming chestnut curls and pulls.
Once John finally makes his way all the way up, he stretches out along Sherlock’s side, bracing himself on an elbow and leaving one leg draped possessively over the omega’s thigh.
He sighs and turns the screen back off without replying, dropping it back onto the coverlet before he foists himself up off of the bed.
John gapes at him momentarily before cautiously attempting a response. “Um, look, Sherlock, we have to be rational about this, okay? Now you, of all people, can’t just…” He hesitates briefly as Sherlock sucks in a sharp breath of air through his nose. “Let’s just stick to what we know, yes? Stick to the
With an irritated huff, Sherlock speeds through an in-depth elaboration of his deduction, then rises from to hand the phone back to Irene. “Please don't feel obliged to tell me that was remarkable or amazing,” he informs her tetchily, “John's expressed that thought in every possible variant available to the English language.”
“Curious? Why’s that curious?” John scowls across the table at him. Mycroft lifts his eyebrows with a mild look of surprise.
As they make their way to Brixton, John watches Sherlock out of the corner of his mind in the back of the cab. The younger man sits stiffly upright, collar turned up against those flawless cheekbones as he stares out the window at the lights of the city that streak past. A long stretch of silence passes before the curiosity gets to be too much, and John can’t resist any longer.
“The feeling, I can assure you my dear Dr. Watson, is entirely mutual.”

“You’ve met him,” he expounds dryly. “How many friends do you imagine he has?”
“Mm,” Sherlock hums noncommittally while John’s eyes linger helplessly on the omega’s middle.

“John, please can you check those flight schedules, see if I'm right?”
She seems entirely unsurprised to find Sherlock awaiting her in the exam room, perched uncomfortably up on the table, wrapped up in the folds of his coat. She’s surprisingly sympathetic to their situation once John explains it, offering little more than an amused lift of her brows in response.

“No, I think he knows exactly where.” Irene rises in turn, not taking her eyes from John’s for an instant as she struts past the proffered Belstaff. She stalks right into his personal space- a tacit challenge to his territory- then reaches back to accept Sherlock’s coat smugly, wrapping herself in Sherlock’s scent. The gesture makes John’s eye twitch, and he struggles to maintain his composure as his inner Alpha snarls furiously. “I’m not sure about you,” she quips at Sherlock, haughtily turning away from John.
John nods tightly, then takes a few steps to stand before Sherlock, lifting the wrung-out flannel up toward Sherlock’s front. “Just need to

The blonde just blinks back at him, in wordless bewilderment, before something over the young man’s shoulder catches his eye. Sure enough, the redhead who’d followed him in from the street has appeared through the crowd, and she flutters over to them the moment she spots John. The young man settles back into the booth with a smirk as John sighs heavily, momentarily casting his eyes heavenward in irritation.
“Please, John,” Sherlock rolls his eyes with false bravado. “Imbeciles have children all the time. In fact, I’d never thought of it before but, while the Philip Andersons of the world run about reproducing without thought, my own

“Uh, yeah, sure,” he accepts, just barely managing to keep the disinterest from his tone. Oblivious, she gestures for the bartender and slides onto the stool beside him.
It’s deliberate of course. John knows full well that Sherlock is perfectly cognizant of the fact that John is hanging on his every word. But if John would like to play out this little fiction, very well. Sherlock is happy to indulge him this once, in exchange for this diversion.

Has John realized then; about the baby?
reveals his cock.
“Are you sure? I mean- you just told me all about how you don’t really go in for this sort of thing.”
Sherlock puts him out of his misery the best way he knows how; he presses his palms to either side of John’s face, leans in, and crushes their lips together.
“Don’t be like that— you were just finally resting, or else I would have insisted you be included.” John sighs heavily. ”Things aren’t going great—”
“It's a bit different, I guess- but also not really? I mean, yes, you’ve got a cock instead of a clitoris, but otherwise…” John observes affably from between Sherlock’s thighs. He props himself up slightly on his elbows and his tongue peeks out to wet his lips as his features take on a sly, determined cast. “Now, let's see how well those anatomy lessons paid off.” His fingers swivel deliberately, searching carefully for something along Sherlock’s inner walls. Finally, they stroke over a small bundle of nerves, and Sherlock
“Bright young things, like we used to be,” he jokes about his pupils. “God, I hate them!” They both laugh and shake their heads, as if wondering where the years disappeared to. “What about you?” Mike asks then. “Just staying in town ’til you get yourself sorted?”
“Oh?” John cocks his own head in confusion.
according to the facial recognition software, is one Mr. Edward Cavendish.”
“Does that mean that I’ve taken a bullet for you,” he asks flirtatiously, rubbing his thumb in gentle circles against the smooth curve of Sherlock’s hip.
Any lingering remnant of vigilance fizzles out when John reaches the top of the stairs and finds Sherlock stretched out on the sofa in repose, eyes closed, and very much so not in danger. He allows himself to relax and admire the space with its tall, elegant windows and charming Victorian mantle. He lets loose a low whistle of appreciation. "Nice location this; lovely little place. Must be expensive."

“It is,” he acknowledges.
When she clings determinedly, he flips back over to face her again, trying desperately to grab hold of her wrists. They roll about briefly, each vying to get the upper hand, and the blood from his still-gushing nose smears over both their hands and fronts. John and Lestrade flutter awkwardly around them, attempting to separate the two without having their legs knocked out from under them.
John’s anger dissipates, replaced by a small bubble of hope that rises in his chest as Stamford catches sight of his wife and shepards John in her direction. With Lady Stamford’s support, he may just have a chance at securing a decent match. With her breeding and vivacious personality, the circles in which she moved were far elevated above John’s own, despite having been rendered a mere Baroness by her marriage.
He manages to toe off his shoes and socks before collapsing gracelessly onto the duvet, asleep as soon as his head hits the pillow.
And it only gets better; John pressing reverent kisses all along the arch of his neck, and thrusting into him hard, and fast, and
“I don’t care,” John interrupts him decisively. “It doesn’t matter to me that you're an Omega. I’ll run after you if I damned well please, and anyone who thinks I should do otherwise can go hang.” As he dabs at particularly stubborn smear of blood on Sherlock’s chin, John’s fingers brush against the swell of his bottom lip. Sherlock struggles to suppress a shiver at the touch, squirming slightly in his seat. “My being an Alpha has nothing to do with our relationship. I don’t need my choices
And so he does.
Or so he hopes.
” John stares back at him, eyes like dinner plates.
He generally tries not to think about the drugs; to picture Sherlock as one of the sad, desperate junkies he dealt with in A&E during his residency. Thankfully it doesn’t come up often, despite his and Mycroft’s established protocol for ‘danger nights’.
“Miscarry, yes. A prolonged separation from the pheromones of the siring Alpha prior to the the third trimester results in spontaneous termination in approximately ninety-seven percent of cases.”
“Yes,” Sherlock blinks up at him as though that were an entirely unremarkable course of action. After a beat, his tongue darts out to lick at his plush lower lip, and he pants slightly as he shifts his hips beneath John’s. Realizing then that he’s still pinning the omega down against the mattress, John rears back onto his elbows, releasing Sherlocks wrists as if burned.
friendly enough, it's still the countryside, and the last thing he wants right now is to deal with some dramatic moralizing and being tossed out on their arses. He looks to Sherlock for help, only to find the berk has already wandered away to nose about the pub.
Sherlock gasps, his own groin throbbing with an answering rush of desire.
The baby is another matter altogether.
The Earl bustles out immediately, muttering indignantly under his breath as he departs, but Lord Fitzmaurice steps forward, advancing upon Sherlock instead.
himself from the investigation and basically fled.
When he arrives back at the flat, John is waiting for him anxiously; pretending to read in the glow of the fairy lights, a mere hair's breadth away from wringing his hands. Thankfully, there’s no sign of Jeanette anywhere, and the rest of their guests have clearly long departed as well.
He raises his brows in reluctant admiration as he stares down at her. “Oh, you're rather good,” he admits as he offers her the real mobile.
The thought has his pathetic inner Omega smarting with rejection, but he harshly quashes it, and pointedly directs his attention back to John. Or, more expressly, his hand where it trails possessively down the smooth expanse of Sherlock’s chest.

Staring across at her in an abandoned power station, John pushes down the bubbling rage inside himself and feels a certain exhaustion and defeat settle in his bones. He doesn't know why he says what he does- to convince himself perhaps, or salvage what little bit of dignity he has left as an Alpha- but the words spill out of him anyways. “Who... who the hell knows about Sherlock Holmes, but – for the record – if anyone out there still cares, I'm not actually interested in Omegas.”
He allows himself to enjoy the fantasy of it for a moment: the two of them a year from now, fresh from the triumphant completion of another case. Hurriedly nipping out to the shops, whilst their child naps at home in 221B, under the watchful eye of Mrs. Hudson. He’d make John laugh, just like now, by dissecting the less pleasant or especially interesting of their fellow shoppers. They’d return home just as the little one was stirring, and John would set to preparing dinner, while Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson would take turns helping and dandling the baby on their knee, so he or she can watch everything with inquisitive little eyes.
“Please,” Sherlock whines plaintively, tossing his head about on the pillow. “Come inside.”

It’s another week before Sherlock finds himself at Bart's again, hunting for John. After an hour has passed and his search yet remains fruitless, he leans over the bar to catch the bartender’s attention.
Humiliating? Whatever does John mean by that? Sherlock glances down at the sheet wound about his nude body to ensure that he hasn’t inadvertently exposed himself. Hm, perhaps John means the improvised toga in general.
“Oh, ta” John interrupts with sardonic grin. Sherlock clears his throat delicately. Ah yes, it’s undoubtedly not the best time to cast anything resembling aspersions on John’s intelligence. Best change tactics.

“Wait,” John interjects with confusion. “How do we know that Edward has his own flat?”
“Yes. It was… It was his brother, Mycroft’s, idea actually. He’s the original founder of St. Juniperus, y’know- the mastermind behind it all. He’s absolutely brilliant; could have run the country, probably, if he’d set his mind to it. But he chose to go into virtual reality development instead; probably horrified their parents. I think he did it… well, they can talk about nostalgia therapy and Alzheimer's all they like, but… I think the
“You’ll have a matching set of black eyes for a day or two,” John observes as he releases Sherlock’s chin, then settles back into his own chair, “but it should heal up just fine.” He blows at his tea before sipping from it, keeping his eyes trained on a unremarkable spot on the rug somewhere by Sherlock’s feet. “So then… your upbringing, it was, uh… unpleasant?”
astonishingly oblivious though he usually was— had noticed. When the DI had peered over the rim of his coffee cup to ask with a concerned frown if he felt unwell, Sherlock had accepted defeat. Having absolutely no desire in the slightest to elaborate upon his current state, he’d hastily made his excuses and fled, claiming a touch of flu, before the actual situation could become any more obvious.
“Do we now?” Sherlock questions dryly, the scandalized façade dropping from his face in the blink of an eye, “How good to know. And how did

John laughs at that, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he snorts in amusement.

The club is just as noisy and crowded as the last time, when Sherlock trudges inside. He stuffs his hands in his pockets, his eyes immediately combing over the throng for a familiar blonde head. He catches sight of him, perched at the bar next to a pretty brunette with a frizzy, abundantly teased perm, just as John asks her something and they move toward the dance floor.

He’s breathtaking.
“When you say a few hours, what do you mean by that?” John asks calmly as he eases his fingers out from Sherlock’s grip and rises from his chair. He cuts around the table and kneels at Sherlock’s side before taking his hand again. “And how long and how far apart are they?”
“No!” Sherlock yelps, unintentionally loud, and John flinches like a kicked dog. Sherlock flushes scarlet and takes a hesitant step forward, lifting his hands plaintively as he scrambles to explain. ”I meant— I don't want you to control your… feelings.

No. This— this is is nothing at all like he ever imagined. He’d always assumed that giving himself to an Alpha would be a surrender: a loss of self, a subjugation. But with John it’s anything but. Rather than a master he has a

it.” Sherlock corrects. As if he needs John wasting any more time than he already does viewing pornographic material or the ridiculous cat videos forwarded along to him by his sister. Between John’s hours at the clinic; his rugby nights; pints with Lestrade; and the time he spends chasing after strange Beta women in an effort to land himself in their beds, he’d have hardly any time left for Sherlock at

He’d resumed his suppressants that very morning, and while he found himself unable to

John’s own simple sort of observation, while nothing at all like his own, is so often charmingly clever in it’s own way. “I began taking suppressants shortly after I presented, and the dosage has always substantially subdued my libido. Later, the addition of more...
Then he returns home to find Sherlock ensconced in the loo and puts two and two together; the great Sherlock Holmes is indeed ill after all, but too embarrassed to concede his humanity. He tries to offer his help, but to his complete lack of surprise, is roundly ignored. So he fixes Sherlock a cuppa and leaves it outside the bathroom door before heading upstairs for a nap.
“Your Grace,” John presses his palms to the smooth edge of the tabletop, and leans forward with grave seriousness. “I would write it out in my own hand.”
“Uh-huh,” John nods, already dragging a stunned Sherlock in the direction of the dancefloor without waiting for an answer..
The boy's features are an odd jumble that shouldn’t work together in the slightest, but combine to give him a somewhat fey appearance. Quicksilver— almost cat-like— eyes, plush bow lips, those cheekbones, and a milk-pale complexion; all topped off by a riotous jumble of dark curls. Not as terribly young as he’d appeared at first glance, but still rather newly out.
— you’d finally found the one for you! Someone who appreciates you just as you are. A bit unseemly that you haven’t bonded yet, of course, but these things happen,” she natters on with a wave of her free hand as she begins pouring out. “Plenty of time for that after the baby is born! Why, my cousin Edith had her first when she was only seventeen — terrible scandal at the time — but-”
“Yes, I do believe so.”
“A suppressed Omega doesn’t attract the same attention, nor do they have much drive of their own to engage in any sort of...

“Why? Are you feeling exposed?” Irene taunts flirtatiously, and Sherlock can’t help but notice the way that John’s eyes struggle to remain trained above her shoulders. With that, he decides he’s had quite enough indeed.
All in all, it’s an interesting social experiment, and regardless, the Omega in him is thrilled, as always, to be mistaken for John’s mate in public.
, Sherlock. If you want to do this, we'll do it. But we're doing it right. You can’t keep going on the way you’ve always done and not expect it to have a seriously detrimental effect on the baby’s development.” John purses his lips and set his jaw mulishly, as if readying for a fight. “We need to establish some ground rules.”
“Is that so?” John moves the phone to his shoulder as he surveys the sparsely populated fridge of Harry’s new flat for dinner possibilities of his own. “Should I be worried Mrs. Watson?”

“I’m not.” John states matter-of-factly, and Sherlock’s heart thumps anxiously against his sternum over the neutral tone.
It’s almost impossible to imagine, despite the fact that he stood next to Mycroft Holmes, in a ballroom crowded by the creme of the beau monde as the man had announced — to the shock of all in attendance — the engagement of his brother to Captain John Watson.

“We should call the police,” John urges as he follows closely on his heels.
She excuses herself to the loo as soon as they get in, which gives him entirely too much time to fidget alone in her sitting room, desperately trying to ignore the leaden weight in his gut. He halfheartedly welcomes the snog she initiates when she finally joins him on the sofa, trying his damnedest to convince himself that the overwhelming sense of wrongness is nothing more than nerves.
“He’s so… deliciously above it all, isn’t he?” She leans forward, as if to let him in on a delightful secret. “The ones who seem like they’re untouchable always taste the sweetest once they crack.”
“London,” John smiles and nudges against Sherlock again pointedly.“So come on, I showed you mine. Where are you? You know I can just look it up.”
“Why didn’t you trust me?”John tediously interrupts, scrubbing a hand roughly over his face. “Would you have even told me at

If the gesture exposes his throat anyway, he tells himself it’s merely a happy accident.
” John cuts himself off abruptly, eyes tracking back to Mycroft with a sudden mortified awareness as he realizes what he’s saying. His cheeks bloom a particularly lurid shade of scarlet, and Sherlock lets loose a low rumble of laughter.
They incline their head in silent assent one last time. And with that he pivots sharply and retreats. When he hazards a final glance back over his shoulder, those shadowed eyes remain unwavering, intently watching him go.
“You’ve spent the last five years fighting on the peninsula; a world away from the townhouses and assembly rooms of London. Were it not for my slight… misadventure, had I come out when I was meant to, our paths might never have crossed that evening in the library.” His mouth quirks into a crooked little smile. “I find that I cannot bring myself to entirely regret my actions, given the outcome.”
“People still have

“Hi,” Sherlock offers quietly, stuffing his hands in his coat pockets.
“What was it?”
“Don’t be absurd John,” Sherlock scoffs, unable to resist smiling at the well-shagged picture John makes: rumpled and flushed, the hasty drape of the afghan across his lap leaving very little to the imagination. He'd almost be jealous of sharing the sight, if he weren't utterly certain of Mycroft's complete lack of interest in… well, any of that. “Mycroft's known since practically the moment we fell back into bed together.”
’s bags as well as his own, but try all he'd like, he’s unable to deny the absurd tingle of Alpha pleasure. Something about taking care of both their things and herding Sherlock about, undeniably feels like nothing so much as one of the little mini-breaks he’s taken over the years with girlfriends past.
“Oh, do stop being noble,” Sherlock rolls his eyes and mulishly pushes back. He cups John’s face between his hands, stroking it pleadingly. “I love you. And you return the sentiment; I know that you do. Please. For once let me have what

in intimate relationships.”
He casts his eyes away self-consciously and moves to head for the exit once again.
It seems rather wonderful in fact, and makes something clench pleasantly in his abdomen as John appears in the doorway. Sherlock peers up at him from the delightful mound of the pillow, a pleased little smile blooming on his face without conscious thought. He lets out a small, warm hum of greeting, which only seems to slightly unnerve John; or so the way he frowns back at Sherlock would seem to indicate.
Yes, he most definitely he is.

“Oi! It wasn't like you weren't plenty
He does as John asks of him with little fuss. Pecks hesitantly the meals placed in front of him without complaint, regardless of his obvious distaste. And, most surprising of all; inches slowly closer to John on the sofa in the evenings while they watch telly, until his feet end up resting in John’s lap, or tucked under his thigh, or his head settles against John’s shoulder. He’s obviously trying desperately to be furtive about it though, so John deliberately pretends not to notice. He’s actually not even sure if this is one of those instances where they’re both
“You were dead on a slab,” John aggressively states the obvious in his usual manner, “it was
“I’m sure that something could be arranged,” a posh voice cuts in suddenly from behind John. A tall, white-haired man in three-piece suit, with an umbrella hooked over his arm appears as if from nowhere, and pulls a third chair up to their table.
John’s hand falters in its stroke as he tenses and Sherlock lets his eyes fall shut, his fingers tightening on the lip of the bin.
“Do you think so?”
your pardon!” Another, decidedly feminine, voice chimes in affrontedly from the window of the ground level flat.
Once again, Irene ends up wrapped up in Sherlock’s clothes and nothing else, though this time it’s his best dressing gown that she wears like a badge of honor. It has her scent intermingling with Sherlock’s, in way that’s reminiscent of that of a bonded Omega. The whole time they’re questioning her, John can’t help but distractedly think that it’s what Sherlock might come to smell like, if he were to bond with her.

“Very well.”
I offer no excuses other than the simple fact life is well, crazy and overwhelming. But here we are again! i hope everyone is as safe and well as can be expected in these interesting times.
“Yeah, okay,” John inclines his head in sheepish acknowledgement before he continues, “so I take it then, that your father was… more, um, traditional than Mycroft?”
“Hilarious John,
As soon as the door silently falls shut in her wake, Mycroft jabs a finger toward the camera phone where it lies between he and Irene on the table top.

been tangled in the embrace of some alpha that night, just as he had dreaded.
“As you command,” Stamford draws himself upright and taps his heels together in a mock salute. He cocks his head toward a nearby doorway. “This way Watson. The library here is well-appointed, and open to all, though most forgo it in favour of dancing and gossip.”
“You're a good woman.”
He twists them, pulling them out slightly before pushing back in again, crooking them in a come-hither motion as he does. Sherlock moans, squeezing his eyes shut against the sudden flood of pleasure. It’s almost too much; red-hot sparks of pleasure crackling along his nerve endings, making the soles of his feet tingle with heat and toes curl. When he convulsively moves to press his thighs together, John hooks a leg around his calf, pinning it down and holding him open. The move makes him gasp and arch, throwing one arm out over John’s flank to clutch at it encouragingly.

“A pregnant Omega dependens and the suspicious absence of an obvious sire? Mycroft would never risk

The only condition of the exception is that John accompany Sherlock on his rounds, in order to ensure that none of the funds are

“You didn’t have to do that,” Sherlock offers quietly while submitting himself to John’s ministrations. “It wasn’t anything I haven’t heard before.”
“I’m well aware, yeah. As I keep reminding you, I

through his veins.
He tamps down on it quickly, squaring his shoulder and raising his chin like a good soldier.
What John had mistaken an insecure need for comfort had been nothing more than misplaced nesting instinct. And now that was going to end,
That, soon enough, Sherlock himself will inevitably wed a suitable alpha; far wealthier and more titled than John Watson might ever hope to be.
“Well his eyes and nose are hardly going to do him any good if I ensure he doesn’t have an opportunity to use them, now are they?” Sherlock hisses impatiently back.
John makes to move off the omega’s prone body, but Sherlock quickly winds his legs about his hips, halting the motion. His long long legs, John’s baser instincts helpfully take note of. John swallows, shifting his weight to hold his groin as far away from Sherlock’s as possible, desperately willing his eager cock to subsist, to no avail. As it had in the library, he feels his resolve slowly crumbling… until his nose catches the faintest hint of a familiar scent. He stiffens.
“You’ve been very… thorough,” Mycroft sighs heavily as his eyes skim over the sheet once more before he folds it shut. “I wish our lot were half as good as you.”
Someone calls out his name and he tenses, forcing himself to plaster his best approximation of a polite smile upon his face as he turns about to face them. He relaxes as soon as he catches sight of the Viscount Stamford’s round, jubilant face.
They lock stares stubbornly, glaring at one another across the room.
“I- I- no!” Sherlock stutters uncharacteristically as he stares back up at John, panic flashing across his features for an instant before they go carefully blank and, releasing John’s wrist as if burned, he moves to turn away. “Nevermind! Yes, I do think it’s best that you go now.”
“You've been here before,” he observes, and it’s a statement, not a question.

“Wait
,” Sherlock rolls his eyes unrepentantly. “No self-respecting Alpha spends that much time with another’s Omega, family or not; unless they’re having an affair. Or if they’re helping provide cover for one.” Eddie’s face freezes in a rictus of shock, a deep red flush making it’s way slowly up his neck and into his cheeks. Sherlock wrinkles his nose, and curls his lip dramatically as he continues, his words taking a deliberate turn for the crude. No better way to goad an Alpha into betraying themselves than by insulting their Omega.
Some nights he listens to Sherlock ramble for hours about an extraordinary array of topics; from the mundane to the macabre. Others they sit in silence; the omega lost in the fathomless depths of his own thoughts, or stubbornly entrenched in an extravagant sulk. Still others they play games and exchange stories, like children whispering in the dark of the nursery, whilst the adults of the house engage in reveleries below.
