'Yeah, nasty infection. That's what did for me really. If it was just the bullet maybe...' John clenched his shaking hand again. Sherlock took the hand between his own and kissed the knuckles, consciously mimicking John's own gesture from earlier.
‘She’s cleverer than you lot and she’s dead. Do you see, do you get it? She didn’t lose her phone, she never lost it. She planted it on him.When she got out of the car, she knew that she was going to her death. She left the phone in order to lead us to her killer.’
‘Seriously?! This guy, a junkie?! Have you met him?. He could feel John stiffen with anger behind him.
'If it comes to that the alpha' s a bigger risk. Joe grew up with Graeme.' John tried not to snap. From what he'd seen of the young omega he was pretty strong, he'd had to be.
. I had wondered if I could do the same myself in future.’ The alpha looked hesitant. No doubt fearing the wrath of Mycroft. Before he left though he had filled two sheets of hotel notepaper with detail.
‘Some copies of his financials are at my flat. Don't know why I've got them really. Can't make anything of them.’
John let himself in, the scent making itself known in a sudden rush as the door opened. He carefully locked it behind him. ‘Matt?’ He called out softly. Not wanting to startle but knowing on some level that the omega would know he was there anyway. He glanced around. Bill had been thorough.
‘Well, they’ve got it wrong, Sebastian. He was murdered.’ Sherlock said, irritated that Dimmock was every bit the jobsworth waste of space he'd feared.
'Joe, why don't you show John round a bit. Take him up to the flats, these two will likely be looking for a bigger place soon.' The alpha grinned at them. It was the sort of presumptuous, overly personal statement that would have pissed John off even if it wasn't coming from someone who was coldly exploiting John's kind for profit, possibly even just a few feet away. He steeled himself and smiled meekly.
‘So you went abroad put him behind you?’ John said, it sounded more like an accusation than he had planned but Victor only shrugged.
'You're with John, properly I mean. Is he ok?' Joe said. Sherlock startled at the observation till he remembered the party and the fact that heats and bonding heightened senses.
'Come on, we'll have a proper lie down for half an hour, then a quick shower before bed.' Sherlock meekly followed, no danger of that happening at any other time so John enjoyed the sensation of being unchallenged.
The omega, Antonio Lopez, was a Spanish national, here to work on a special commission for a few months. A loner, no alpha, no family, no one to notice, according to his UK agent who had called the police helpline and then made the formal ID. He normally worked on driftwood, gathered near the eco house he'd built on a Mediterranean beach but occasionally took commissions abroad because they paid well.
'They seem to pick on certain types of people too.' John mused noting both the woman they'd just seen robbed and the one writing the review were in their sixties.'
‘You know most alphas would just have told him he had a tiny knot and left it at that.’ John whispered in his ear.
'Will do. He's been looking at some old stuff for me anyway.' Greg said. John, with a pang of sympathy for his friend, remembered this morning and the old case. Certainly put Harry into perspective.
He had a flash of five years down the line. Matt resenting the loss of his army career. John a reluctant GP, bored, maybe drinking a little too much. The blazing rows, the stifling silences. Just like his parents. Anything but that.
Sherlock carefully pulled the wrapping away. It was a silver bookmark with an enamelled bee dangling from a chain. He smiled at the memory of the afternoon he and John had spent wandering through a Kent orchard. It was not long after they started to flatshare and well before John had known about his alpha status. The case was a missing person, easily solved, but he remembered John not only listening to him talking about the dynamics of the hives they came across among the trees but actually asking intelligent questions. Sherlock remembered thinking, for the first time, there was a chance this might actually last.
At this the man glanced over his shoulder and swept a look over John who realised he'd left his stick propped against the bar. He cursed as it supported his therapist’s theory.
John absorbed this for a few moments and something creaked into place in his head as he remembered the first conversation with Mycroft, the insulting offer of money...
' I'll keep a weather eye out. You must look after your sister. Let me know if you're not back by the end of the week. Goodbye John.'
Greg came to sit with them after he'd been checked over by the police doctor and had given his own statement. The blooming bruise on his jaw the only sign of his ordeal.
‘So should you. Replace lost energy and all that.’ John replied running his tongue along his bottom lip in a way that reminded Sherlock of, well, a lot of things that could be very distracting from the work.
He closed his eyes took a breath before opening them to look hard at the man again but he was right. The hair was different of course and the clothes. He had a definite uneven and greasy look which Sherlock suspected was intentional. He couldn’t though quite shake the military bearing.
'John!' He grabbed his coat and ran down the stairs stopping halfway because - nothing. He could hear nothing. 'John?' He shouted again into the suffocating silence. The panic spreading and re-settling.
John took one of his hands, threading their fingers together. ‘Enjoying yourself?.’ John said, with a soft caress to his tense thigh, sounding pretty far gone himself.
John looked at him steadily for a few seconds, checking he was serious. Then the alpha grabbed his coat, walking to the door without hesitation . His whole stance had changed, upright,strong. Sherlock had a sudden image of him in fatigues, stoically shouldering a pack before heading into the dusty desert.
'True. I think we just bonded too young really. I thought when I joined I'd just be a regular cop you know? Not CID, Scotland yard all this pressure. She was lonely and neither of us had the guts for a clean break.'
'Can we move..? Sherlock began, as he held John carefully. Fingers spread across his back as if he had been handed something of great value. 'Only if you want to - it's just because...' Sherlock stopped and glanced down at his injury.
The last proper memory he had was of Sally Donovan. Thrusting her warrant card in the face of an ignorant beta triage nurse who insisted he be removed. That A&E was no place for an omega in that condition.
Thanks so much for all the comments and kudos on this. Sorry about making this look like 1 of 1, it was always going to be longer by it was nice to get so much encouragement!
John took his chance with a decisive dive, knocking over Mycroft so the both fell clear of the bolt that splintered against the sooty wall. The echoes were chased by another sharp crack. Zhu Zhi fell, blood gathering in an inky puddle on the filthy floor. By the time Sherlock had checked on John and Mycroft she was gone.
John nodded. Beta parents reliably meant beta offspring. The genetic anomalies rare enough that the army didn't bother with the expensive tests for beta recruits.
As William eased himself back up between John’s legs shirt buttons were nimbly opened. It was like some sort of inverted striptease, John losing clothes while the man almost in his lap stayed dressed.
'We need to be quick in case your mum comes looking for us.' John said, protesting as Sherlock divested him of his clothing. Now there was a sentence he never thought he'd use at his age.
John must have shifted his weight or something because the floorboards creaked suddenly. Piercing eyes snapped open, panicky for a second before resting on John. He then stretched luxuriously.
Greg had a general air of pleased with himself. They all, Sherlock realised, had an air of pleased with themselves. After everything they'd been through recently it made a nice change.
The scent invaded his lungs as he caught his breath. It was like his mothers garden on a warm evening, lavender and rosemary. Green, herbal, clean. He realised, with embarrassment ,that even through several layers of clothes he was aware of the alphas penis against his thigh.
'Sorry, I should have gone. I just get so tired after.' Matt arched into a luxurious stretch. Scent blunted somehow by the suppressant.
‘Did you buy this wine? It’s my…’ He shut the fridge door and the question died on his lips. His flatmate was standing at the kitchen doorway.
Sherlock produced a key card and let them into a corridor marked staff only. It was quiet at this time of day,apparently some sort of storage space for the chambermaids. There was a smell of laundry detergent and piles of linen and towels lined the shelved walls.
'I don't want you to hate me. You realise it could have been you that day? If we werent...it might never have happened any of it.'
Greg was waiting as soon as he finished the clinic. Restless in his seat like someone waiting for bad news. John went through his talk with Joe, telling Greg about the erratic heats as well. How it tied him,even unbonded, to the alpha Richard.
'One last thing, I probably shouldn't say this Mr Holmes but you seem so unsure of yourself, it's unusual in an alpha frankly. John, he calls out for you, your connection is obviously strong. I'm sure he'll be well cared for back home.'
John handed him a blanket that was draped over the headboard. ‘That's the only thing about doing it this way, I can't keep you warm after.’ Sherlock threw the blanket round his shoulders. John picking up his hands again as soon as he had done so, squeezing.
'Nothing that I know of, I suppose he just likes the idea of a spare. Apparently I should have known him, son of one of my parents friends.'
John took his hand, realising they’d rather gone in a circle. ‘What about if I tell you what I was thinking that night?’ He took a mouthful of Chablis and Sherlock did the same. Sherlock nodded and John took his hand and began to draw circles with his thumb on the palm. It was the sort of thing that he’d wanted to do for ages and it was hard to be casual about it. ‘See I’d gone there to get off, no complications. I’d never done it before. I thought it would be…’
‘Tea in the pot. There was bread and some eggs left so I did French toast.’ . ‘You'll be hungry.’ He glanced at Sherlock, a faint wicked glint in his eye. It had the feeling of an echo of something long gone and Sherlock felt a little sad for a moment. He arranged himself a mug of tea and took a long fortifying sip of the hot liquid.
Sherlock took a sip of his wine and looked at John stonily fro a moment before a corner of his mouth turned up, apparently against his will. ‘It's not as bad as it sounds. I'm a detective. Consulting detective, the police come to me when they're out of their depth.'
The happy couple continued off on their circuit of the room and they fell into silence for a while. Sherlock, he assumed, watching for his thieves. John mostly watching Sherlock.
‘That’s your dry spell sorted then Watson.’ Jones said with a grin. Jones had always joked that John’s bisexuality was ‘greed’.
'Of course, as you would say the chemistry is very basic.' John smiled at him as he changed into his own clothes. Gratitude from Sherlock was a rare thing. There was another giggle from outside.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, as if there was no comparison. 'Come in John , we have mildly diverting work to do.'
John sighed, he had hoped not to get into this. 'We had a thing-barely a thing-before we went out to Afghanistan. Two days before we leave I find out he's got a wife.' John turned to him, it seemed an awful lot more complicated in his head somehow but that was the gist of it.
.’ The alpha scrubbed a hand across his face. Moving to the edge of the bed. ‘Sherlock I'm sorry. I thought you realised you were done. I
'Symbiotic.' Sherlock supplied. 'Isn't that what a good bond is supposed to be all about too?' It occurred to Sherlock that was probably still private, they'd barely talked about it properly themselves yet but Lestrade seemed unsurprised at the comment.
John's hands went straight to his hair, brushing it off his face and looking at him hard. As if he was trying to remember, to find something. He kissed him gently, pulling back to let Sherlock come to him, which he did, arms winding round Johns neck.
‘Fine.’ Sherlock rolled his eyes. ‘You compose an appropriate response.’ He handed the phone to John (who did a quick cut and paste job (Sherlock had said some very complimentary things so he sent them to himself) and then selected one winking and one cross eyed emoji to send to Irene.
John sank down beside him fingers twining round his. Gentle and hopeful. ‘I don’t think you could disappoint me. Be a pain in the arse yes - but not a disappointment.’ Sherlock felt himself smile a little. ‘Just so we’re clear,’ John leaned in close, his voice dropping to a gruff whisper. ‘This is me asking.’
'I will resist the urge to point out that this was your idea.' Sherlock said smoothly as they got out of the car.
'First I've heard of it, though Mycroft does like to delegate. I did wonder why he was kept in?' John asked.
‘I was referring John to your heat starting. You seem excessively warm, you're in shirtsleeves while everyone else is still wearing a jacket , you…’ Sherlock paused, realising perhaps now was not the time or place for a stream of deductions. ‘I can
Sally indicated the screen. ‘This whole area used to be pretty rough. Nice enough when I was growing up but then the factory closed down. Whole area went downhill, by the time I joined the force it was a no go area. The street they had the house on,  it's been- what's the word -gentrified. Probably why they've finally let it go they'll have made a good few quid. Round the road, it's ten minutes in a car between there and where the party is but if you walk through here,’ She indicated a greenish yellow area with grey splotches of old concrete on the satellite street view. ‘Five minutes on foot. It's the derelict factory site, all grown up with vegetation now. Only locals would think of the cut through.’
'They're stealing to order.' Sherlock said, never taking his eyes off them. Someone else, probably someone in management is overseeing this. The waiters pass on the jewellery keep the cash.
‘No. I looked at some online reviews for this place. Some thefts reported, always at big events like this.’
'What happened with him?' The detective said, his voice tight as he peered out the side window. The car moving out into traffic.
‘To be honest I think there might be something in it. The last couple of years there's been far less chatter about him, until the stories about the omegas more recently. We thought he was just getting more careful with age but maybe…’
'Its not that you're from the wrong sort of family. They don't care about that. In my experience truly old money never does. No, it was the gun.'
'I meant to give this to Greg. Address where they run things from apparently.' Sherlock took the slightly dog-eared card from his hand.
He redressed behind the curtain while Dr Sawyer spoke to him, writing up her notes. ‘No problems I can see and you should get the results back in ten days.’
'It was decided I'd be better off here after a particularly pungent experiment with pig intestines.' Sherlock said matter of factly.
The omega moved closer to him on the bed. Picking up his hand and pressing it back to his hip. Hooking a leg over the Alpha's thigh for good measure.
'Fine. Say eight, that should give us a chance to get the preliminary results from the lab.' The detective climbed back into the waiting car.
John rubbed his hand over his face and looked round at a pretty blonde female omega. Hands shoved deep in the pockets of her lab coat.
John took it with a steady hand. Dropping back down beside him and pulling the bedding into a cocoon around them.
John sat across from his sister at her kitchen table pushing pasta round his plate. He hadn't been hungry but when Harry got like this it was his instinct to enforce a routine. Probably the soldier in him. Harry on on the other hand ate quite a bit, Clara always had been the cook.
So I'm just going to say this-I don't like this chapter. It's been annoying me for weeks. Plot-wise it gets to where I want it to go but-meh.
'I'm sorry about earlier. I didn't mean to scare you.' Sherlock said carefully moving two steaming mugs to the table and dropping heavily into a chair.
'Luckily I've had more success.' His brother dropped a flyer on the table. 'Yellow Dragon Circus, Chinese, one night only. I took the liberty of booking tickets. Immigration records were most revealing.'
Meanwhile John had moved on to his chest, his nipples, then downwards to the sensitive skin of his belly. John's tongue was so close to where he needed it most and the slightest of well-placed licks had him arching up off the bed. John's hands, taking advantage of the gap created by his curving spine, had slid under and downwards to cup his arse. The doctor let out a feral groan as he kneaded.
'Did he bother to bring fruit, chocolate? You know, like you usually would to a recuperating relative?'
'Victor, you must see this awful print.' He said jovially, as if they'd spoken only ten minutes ago. He gently steered the omega's arm and fortunately Victor seemed to have enough residual trust to go along with it. Trust that Sherlock had, frankly, done nothing to deserve the last time they'd seen each other.
' Mine was the same John, didn't look after himself at all.' Mrs Hudson said, shaking her head. John and Sherlock exchanged an amused glance because she was making her usual assumption - but this was the first time it had been sort of true.
‘I love you too.’ Sherlock replied, voice suddenly hoarse with emotion as well as arousal. He was surprised at how natural the sentiment, the exchange felt. ‘How do you feel?’
By the time Greg got up a little after eight Sherlock had been up and dressed for two hours. He'd already phoned the hospital. John was sleeping his temperature apparently suggesting he was past the worst. At the nurses suggestion Sherlock left Mrs Hudson's number as someone who could sit with John once the heat was over but before he was recovered enough to come home.
A few hours later he woke to weak sunlight and a pleasant tickle on his thigh. Sherlock was lying between John's legs. His mouth working upwards from John's knee in licks, nips and open-mouthed kisses. John shoved a hand into the alpha's hair to let him know that he was awake.
John marshalled the thoughts in his head and opened his mouth to speak. To in fact give a speech, because the way he felt was a monologue, not a simple sentence. At the last second though he paused. He had the sudden feeling that the way he felt, unabridged, may terrify rather than reassure, so he spoke the first thought that popped into his head.
John hadn't ever looked forward to a heat, not really. It was an itch to be scratched. This time though he found he was looking forward to the in between. Those brief moments of exquisite, sated quiet when they'd lie and dose in each others arms.
'What does it tell you when an assassin cannot shoot straight? That he is not really trying.' She drawled, looking at Mycroft. 'We wanted to make your brother inquisitive Mr Holmes. We hoped he would find the empress pin for us. Perhaps this will sharpen his mind, taking his brother and his alpha.'
’So, what did you have in mind?’ John squeezed the velvet a little. Thinking, again, of what Sherlock had said about his lack of underwear.
‘Well, the expectation was not far at all.’ Sherlock sat, rather primly. ‘If you remember, our hypothesis was the attacker was impotent. I believed he would show himself for what he was not long after I got him in the room.’
‘Who told you that?’ John said, trying to sound flirtatious but a little thrown that someone had been talking about him. He knew doctor was a fair guess, at this do.
John looked out across the ballroom. The waiters they'd seen earlier were clearing glasses from a table. One of the two engaging the women at the table in conversation while the other deftly removed a brooch from the lapel of a jacket on the back of a chair before dipping his hand into a bag for a folded pile of notes.
‘Not now I don't no, he thinks he does but this isn't about insider trading.’ He made a mental note to pass that nugget to Lestrade for his financial crime colleagues. ‘it's too flamboyant, specific. Someone like Van Coon, he may have had enemies his boss wasn't aware of.’
They fell silent. Lestrade turned off Baker Street into a lane where he could park and they headed for the door of 221, mindful of it being the early hours. Slipping in quietly so as not to disturb Mrs Hudson he'd called her earlier to let her know what had happened, bits of it at least.
There was a few beats of blankness as the salesman looked John over, carefully assessing. 'When you say security?' The salesman was staring straight ahead to where Sherlock was opeing up car doors and running fingers suggestively over fine leather seats.
'We have some time then-to plan. I should go' Sherlock, case deduced, was starting to feel awkward and he stood up, making for the door, head down.
'Oh John you're home didn't Greg get you?' Mrs Hudson bustled in, a pair of Sherlock's pyjama bottoms and a T-shirt draped over one arm.
'I know- it's the hormones. It's why I advise patients not to rely on condoms in their heat. After a couple of hours, some couples, they both want to be pregnant so badly they don't use them. I do want ...to talk about it at least, later though yeah?'
They walked at least twice the length of the flat into a large airy room with French doors that opened out into the garden. It was buzzing with the conversation of about thirty or so people. Mostly older, milling around with champagne flutes and plates of dainty food.
and so on provided alphas aplenty but the thing was, they lied. Lied about their age, height. Worst of all they lied about their
‘Well, I knew you’d find the case. I’m not stupid.’ Lestrade said, crossing his legs and relaxing into the chair.
He found himself bold again. 'Hardly I only realised I was coming yesterday. This was what they had left. It's rather wasted on me-well it was.' He walked towards John and stooped a little to kiss him again. Before they'd been in a cupboard and there wasn't much room to really get into it. Now they had time, space, privacy it was so much more.
'The Spider.' Soo Lin unlaced her shoe and took it off. On her sole, at the heel, was a simple tattoo of a lotus flower inside a circle.
He typed a crisp reply. Advising that he would be there at 2pm. Sebastian could rearrange his calendar if he was keen enough. As he was shutting down the laptop he had another thought.
'I think I'll see Joe home. Catch you up?' John threw over his shoulder to Greg. The alpha nodded and quickly, gratefully, left. John helped the now shaky omega into a cab, chaperoning him to the small flat that had been a present from Jim. Thankfully it was reasonably close by.
'Sort of, it's not so much her I miss it's the bond. That connection to someone. The feeling you're going home at night to another part of yourself. Sorry that's romantic shit.' Lestrade waved his hand dismissively.
He hovered round a display of special edition scotch miniatures. The labels elegant little landscape pictures. The glass of cold Sauvignon Blanc was going down a little too easily in the stuffy room.
He could see the effect he was having on Sherlock too. Eyes wide and dark, cheeks pink and the way he was carrying his coat in front of him-things were obviously progressing.
Sherlock stalked around the crime scene, crouching to examine something now and then, occasionally returning Donovan's glare.
'How would you like not to have? I have a room.' John met his eyes, surprised and Sherlock blushed a deep crimson. 'I don't normally do this. Which sounds like such a cliche, but I don't.'
John took his time, coaxing pleasure from him, encouraging his grip in greying hair. He could hardly believe this soft affectionate thing was the same act he'd associated with dark corners in dubious clubs and a mind fizzing with coke. More than that John was enjoying it too.
'Is she though?' Mycroft said with a smile. 'Think again. Assuming Soo Lin is alive, where would she be?'
'Look, Sherlock- we need to talk about what happened last night.' John said, after a brief pause in the conversation.
He felt John smile against his belly before looking up at him. 'I look forward to it. I'd like to have it in my mouth now though.'
‘Common enough name.’ John said, not wanting to get his hopes up. ‘Worth a call to Lestrade though.’
All of that was derailed when he stretched and his fingers collided with the coarse hair and smooth warm skin of Dr Watsons thigh.
Sherlock opened his eyes to John lying beside him staring. His face curiously satisfied given he was still hard.
Before Lestrade could argue. Sherlock was bent to the lock with his set of lock picks. The inspector looked round nervously but Sherlock knew he was unlikely to be stopped when they were this close to something interesting. The mechanism was simple and it opened into a dingy corridor. The floor suggested it was little used but had seen some recent traffic.
He recorded the last of his scrappy notes for this episode on his spreadsheet and closed his laptop. A post it note he hadn't noticed earlier was stuck to the lid.
The Sherlock felt the ornate plush carpet spongy and almost unstable beneath his feet. It wasn't alcohol, he'd barely managed one glass of red and a sip of champagne for the toast all told. It was the man beside him, the man he'd danced with, the man holding his hand, the man he'd invited to his room. The man now expecting sex.
The pain was sharp and took his breath away, he was vaguely aware of Sherlock's hands coming up to grip his thighs. An instinctive reaction as the first pulse of the alpha' s cock swelled inside him. The pain was soon chased by his own orgasm. He could feel how good it had been for Sherlock in the pulls, twitches and spasms of the body below him. He was glad and proud he'd been the first one to do this for him. He leaned backwards supporting himself with his palms on Sherlock's thighs.
'That's normal- it's good.' John ran the cloth across the surface in slow deliberate swipes. The possessive urge Sherlock had been containing all night suddenly broke free and he stepped closer, when John turned back round there was barely an inch of air between them. They stood for a few beats.
‘Thomson.’ Said with an eyebrow raise. John knew Thomson well, not a bad bloke really but boorish. ‘Look I'm not asking you for a limb. Just to have a lot of sex for a few days. It's fun-from what I remember.’ Bill smiled wryly. He'd married young, nigh on fifteen years ago but it had been a largely passionless affair for the last few years.
He let the hotel know he’d be checking in and then,trying to delay the inevitable, went into Van Coons office on his way.
Frankly Sherlock's first thought was that the yellow paint improved the dark turgid portrait, but the interesting bit was the locked room. Secure door, never opened and the only other means of entry a balcony many floors up on the banks disgustingly phallic shaped building.
.Well intentioned but not what he wanted. He wanted to get off with something other than his own hand. He wanted the frisson of paying for it he wanted excitement.
It had been a long few days. locum shifts juggled with helping Sherlock. Only a house breaking but the house of a cabinet minister containing who knew what secrets. Sherlock found the hole in their security and pocketed a decent fee. A proportion of which he had a agreed to spend on appropriate lab glassware and ‘food only’ crockery and cutlery for the flat. The eccentric use of the kitchen being one of the few things they had issues with as flat mates over the last two months.
As they walked through the half-finished building he answered a question from Lestrade about John's whereabouts with a blush and fumbled words. Grateful when the Inspector started to describe a particularly gory cold case he was working on as a way to cover the awkwardness. It was just getting interesting when they both heard the flap of heavy polyethylene. They looked at each other for a second- the day was windless-before Sherlock took off in the direction of the noise. Lestrade following behind, shouting into his radio.
After John had been knocked sideways by the sight of Sherlock with Victor he had numbly watched Greg have a short, intense chat with Jim Graeme in a quiet corner of the room. The alpha had then found him and asked him to dance, agreed code for when they had what they needed and could leave, their obvious 'issues' reason enough for a hasty departure.
'I know,' john patted his mates hand realising that Sherlock had worked it through the zip of his trousers and onto bare skin. 'I want to see this one through though. By the time Jim comes to trial I'll be due. By the time the police corruption trial starts we'll need to think about asking Mycroft to look after his neice or nephew.' They both smirked at this.
'John is something wrong?' Sherlock shifted in his seat. John realised his arm had wrapped around Sherlock's leg and his fingers were digging into the flesh.
'I have one idea.' Sherlock rolled on to his side and reached into the bedside drawer pulling out a sachet of lube. 'It was a very expensive room.' He said over his shoulder, at the doctor's noise of surprise.
‘You in that outfit, me peeling you out of it. Have you any idea what those trousers do to your arse? Then the fact you wrestled a serial killer to the ground that night, that got me hot and bothered too.’
'Morning.' John replied, relaxing into his touch. He gasped as the alpha's mouth perfectly engulfed his sensitive flesh. He let his hold in Sherlock's hair ground him. He was good at this, neither too rough nor too hesitant, reading him perfectly. John came, crying out,
Molly nodded. 'That's what his records say. The dentition is clearly alpha. We'll look into it of course. Get an expert in for a mould, run it against records but all that takes time. Once I've done the post mortem I'll know more.' she gestured vaguely in the direction of the still covered groin area. She could be surprisingly awkward about such things for a pathologist. ' Late presentation is a possibility.'
Sherlock felt shaky and angry with himself. It had been going so well. His heats managed by a series of anonymous willing alphas, a respectable number of influential private clients and now Lestrade had let him on to a crime scene. Not snuck him in days after but walked him straight in past incredulous (and mostly stupid) colleagues.
‘When you..’ Sherlock started aware, to his irritation, that he was blushing. ‘When you bite, how do you know you're doing it correctly? I mean-so you're not hurting them more than necessary?’ His face burned, he had no one else to ask. His father was too far away and the awkwardness of that was too hideous to contemplate anyway.
'You too. Try and give your ankle a break.' John replied, squeezing harder, because he might be the alpha' s lover but he was also practically his doctor. He left with Greg realising with a stab of reflexive jealousy that
He caught Victor's scent before he saw him. He thought at first it was perhaps an olfactory hallucination. He'd got off fairly lightly in terms of suppressant withdrawal (thanks to John) and he thought this was perhaps it's parting shot but when he turned round Victor was there. Hair a little shorter, eyes when they met his a little more lined but unmistakably Victor. He had no time to think.
They had both showered carefully but now John was thinking about it medically that was never going to cut it. Knotting released hormones that wouldn't leave either of their systems for a couple of days. He was mortified to have let Greg down.
There was a lot said and written about knotting. Pages and pages of the sex guides provided to adolescents were devoted to it, how important it was for strong bonds and relationships. How good it could be with the right alpha. Once the pleasure had passed though Sherlock found it intrusive distasteful. He never ceased to be irritated that ,due to a mechanism designed to give sperm the best chance of reaching an egg, he had to waste his time like this. Somehow John Watson took the edge off of all that. It wasn't anything specific it was just his manner, his presence.
When he woke the clock read quarter past two and the other side of the bed was cold. He got up stiffly and went through to the kitchen for a glass of water. He half expected to find Sherlock asleep on the couch. What he didn't expect was that Sherlock would have made up a bed there. The pillow, duvet and pyjamas all suggesting this had been the plan all along. The alpha stirred and stretched, his limbs absurdly long for the couch. He startled at the sight of John.
'There's nothing much to find, he left abruptly though.' Sherlock said, running his eyes over the workbench.
They chopped and cooked together and talked of other things. Mainly practical stuff for John's heat. Keeping phones on, not straying too far. As they ate John wrote a shopping list. More bottled water, granola bars, laundry soap and, to Sherlock's alarm,first aid supplies from the pharmacy. John explained to the panicky looking alpha that bond bite problems were very rare but could be serious, they should be prepared. After that Sherlock went back to the pile of papers. Within minutes he was lost it his mind palace.
Another chapter so as not to leave them hanging. This is I suspect on the fluffy side for something tagged prostitute Sherlock but that’s the way it goes sometimes.
'Upstairs now. I'll talk to her.' John whispered kissing Sherlock sharply on the lips and nodding his head towards the staircase.
'It is you know, that's pretty much how I deal with it. I've got more of a mind shed though.' The older alpha looked at him with a weak smile. Sherlock nodded slowly and started to look at the results again.
Truth was he didn't know if he would have taken the pill, wouldn't have known until the last moment. He changed the subject.
John loved this bit. Much as he found the great consulting detective in full deductive flow sexy as hell, there was something special about him reduced to monosyllables by nothing more than John's mouth. That big brain on standby for a few brief moments.
'Cleanup time I think.' John reluctantly rolled off and wiped off the worst with one of the T-shirts before going to the bathroom and coming back with flannels wrung out in hot water. He wiped them both, thinking that strangely, cleaning Sherlock was almost more intimate than what had just passed and realising that he'd never felt the inclination with any other alpha.
The scent of anxious alpha grated on Sherlock's already taut nerves as Mrs Hudson showed Raz into the flat.
'Of course we were lucky, John had his service revolver on him, otherwise we'd have lost them.' Sherlock said with a quick private smile to him.
The arrangements for surrogates were complicated, almost a courtship of sorts. They were meant to avoid any exploitation and give both parties the chance to back out at any point. The nearest they could get to the ‘neutral territory’ specified was the awning that served as one of the medical waiting areas. Out of clinic hours of course. Bill had laid on tea and biscuits and the whole thing was civilised.
‘I know. I love you.’ John said his hand pushing firmly into Sherlock's hair, pressing the alpha in place against his neck. Before Sherlock had a chance to reply coherently John pushed back hard and his knot slipped inside. Swelling to fill John who clenched and spasmed with pleasure around him as his teeth, with no conscious thought, broke the skin.
'No one special, hmm. Anyone ' not special' trying that would have got a broken jaw for their trouble.' He defensively pulled his shirt back.
‘I just need to talk about the-the rent.’ Sherlock said, thinking quickly, moving away from Lestrade.
'Care for a little legwork?' Mycroft looked at him and for a moment it was like they were children again, off running through the woods executing some mad scheme.
Lestrade quickly led him back out of the alley and bundled him into the car. His heart pounding in his chest, he was uncomfortably ,humiliatingly, hard inside his clothes. Lestrade got in and silently drove off. Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut and it was a few minutes before it occurred to him they were heading the wrong way.
'I was wanting to speak to you anyway, I'm going to be out of London for a few days – my sister that I told you about. Can you keep an eye on Sherlock? I mean he's got Mrs H and his brother will keep a close watch but taking some food over one night would be a big help. Try to keep him eating something.' John suddenly wondered, given their performance last night (in two rooms), exactly how close a watch Mycroft was keeping on his brother. Probably best not to think about it.
'You police?' He panted. Sherlock took his time with the reply. He could hear Lestrade and at least four others moving closer.
Sherlock stared at his hands. 'We've never been together during his heat I don't know if my response was normal I ...'
There was a long pause which Sherlock longed to fill but his brain couldn't find any form of words that would suffice, other than the ones John longed to hear.
'Scrambled eggs.' Lestrade said finally, as if it was the answer to a question. 'My ex, that's what I used to make her afterwards. It's just everyone talks about energy bars and whatever for during but once it's over you want something solid and you're not really in a condition to go to the shops.'
'Dull.' Sherlock rolled his eyes as they walked out into the shop, the staff were all suspiciously busy around one display with a good view of the fitting room door.
‘Do you want to come back and meet him then?’ John said, not sure it was a good idea, not with Sherlock in the middle of something, but he may as well get it over with. Also, he sort of wanted to show his alpha off.
'You can't see it now but you get a little bit of a river view during the day and lots of light.'Joe had wandered to the window.
'I'm very busy Mycroft.' He said by way of greeting. Not looking at his brother who sank into a chair.
Sherlock had know Lukis had a lot of books but hadn't realised Van Coon had a spare room full. It complicated matters that they had both seemed to favour bestseller list thrillers.
‘Perhaps you can help me persuade Dimmock to let me have a look at this flat?’ Sherlock said with an eyebrow raise.
'I did say as soon as I got you inside.' John grinned wickedly, one hand going to Sherlock's belt but his hand was swatted away, the detective looking over his shoulder with a frown. John turned to see the light in 221a had gone on.
He laid a hand softly on Sherlock's chest, giving him a chance to back away, break the moment ,but he stayed still. John reached up, actually had to go up on tip toes to press their lips together . He felt unbalanced for a moment but then it was fine because Sherlock was, leaning down, kissing him back and his feet were flat on the floor again.
His CO has agreed you can use one of the spare barracks out the far end of the camp. You'd have everything, bathroom, running water, guard - beta obviously.’
He knew this bluster was just part of Sherlock's process. Frankly, when the situation was less dire, less personal he found it hot. Lucy though was getting bombarded with scent from an agitated alpha she didn't know. Trying to fight her natural instinct to run away. She'd need to toughen up in this job, John knew, but there was no reason that they should be causing her to feel this way. 0
'There is someone else, wasn't at the start. We've had to work around it.' There was no point in lying.
Back at Scotland Yard the pace changed significantly and John could all but taste Sherlock's irritation with the dry admin of statements on one hand and the tedious procedure of questioning the Graeme's on the other. He stayed though, for another case he'd likely have been long gone. John found himself incredibly proud of himself and Sherlock when two senior officers came over and thanked them. Very much unofficially - but still.
'CCTV and one guard.' Sherlock replied, staring into the still lit lobby of the building. 'Only CCTV downstairs, that bank of monitors at the desk looks impressive but only covers the finished floor. Once we get in and up the stairs it should be childs play. We'll go in the side entrance while we create a distraction.'
‘Ejaculation.’ The man said bluntly. ‘Sorry, I should have introduced myself before we got down to business so to speak. William.’ He held out a hand which John took, admiring its masculine elegance.
‘I didn't quite believe it till I came in here today.’ He laughed nervously. ‘I mean I've seen you round the base before and I thought you were interesting. Plus, I've always liked, preferred being penetrated but until now…you smell -nice.’ McMillan swallowed hard and took a gulp of tea.
He had wanted to talk to him about the casework he had left but even someone with Sherlock's lack of social graces could see now was not the time. He knew from experience that being undercover was uniquely stressful - if exhilarating when it went to plan.
John sniffed unobtrusively. There was a faint spicy musk in the air, the ridiculous vanilla candles in the fitting room had been masking it.
Molly placed a cup of coffee in front of him and hovered. ‘Is this the last time?’ She ran her fingers down the columns on the screen that related to his last heat. He always let her look at this. Another scientist kept the experimental part honest, stopped things like confirmation bias slipping in.
John was fairly sure he caught Sherlock waving to the security camera as he leaned against the bonnet of the Jaguar.
‘How is it going?’ John said as he walked in. The alpha had obviously had a hard shift at the surgery. It was written in his wrinkled clothes and askew hair (pulled by a vomiting two year old) but he still sounded convincingly enthusiastic,it must be exhausting.
‘I love you.’ John said suddenly, carding a hand clumsily through Sherlock's hair. ‘I wanted to say it now while I've still got a few wits about me.’
‘Private detective?’ John said, imagining him trailing adulterous husbands and wives. ‘The police don't consult amateurs.’
From there things blurred. John ,even though he knew it wasn't strictly true, felt like he was taking Matt's virginity and the first time was slow and careful. John talked him through the knotting, taking pride in the moment when the tension left Matt's body and he moaned with the pleasure of it.
the alpha explained as he handled the pots and Sherlock couldn't help thinking that his own body was a bit like that, that it was something the cold logic of his brain and his insatiable reproductive system had in common.
'I want you too.' John replied quietly, eyes running hungrily over the alpha, willing him on.He watched Sherlock's expression change as the alpha slowly entered him. A slight uncertainty was quickly replaced ( to John's own delight) by surprised joy.
Sherlock's brother had gone to resolve something delicate but unspecified in Panama and, since it was already paid for, given them use of a car for a few days. John had long assumed that the shiny elegant Jags that occasionally abducted him were some sort of official perk. Apparently Mycroft hired them by the day, paying for them out of his own pocket to use for 'off the books' work. Being a drama queen ran in the family it seemed, at least it helped cut down the shocking amount they spent on cabs for a few days.
'Mrs Holmes? John Watson. Yeah nice to speak to you too. Sorry about Sherlock, he's got an experiment at a sensitive stage.'
'It does more than that.' Sherlock said quietly. 'This is the night before Lopez's name was released to the press, a few hours after the ID.'
The mezzanine overlooked the dance floor but heavy velvet curtains and glass partitions meant it wasn't as loud. John recognised Graeme straight away from the papers. Just under six foot with close cropped receding hair and the glow of a man who can afford to spend half the winter in the Caribbean.
As a show home it was furnished and Lestrade was sitting on a rather lurid lime green sofa. A glass of wine in front of him. Melissa sat alongside just as if they were at the party, the one Jim still seemed to be attending on the other side of the waste ground.
'No, she wouldn't dare risk that, not even in her private archive. Chances are though, you wouldn't see much anyway, camera is pointing the wrong way. She must have forgotten about this.'
The doctor was muttering, nonsense mostly, but sometimes his name over and over as he got close. John's orgasm was silent save for a sharp gasp, he went rigid and then there was a warm, wet flood between Sherlock's legs. John collapsed against him.
‘What’s all this then? She said conversationally, sweeping her hand round the room at the paper on the wall, floor,everywhere.
'I didn't like the way he was looking at you.' John sighed, sliding across the car seat and picking up a slim hand, kissing the backs of the fingers.
Was underlined at the bottom. Sherlock realised with a fluttery , queasy feeling that the book was John's. He'd been reading it on and off during Sherlock's heat.
Sherlock now understood, part of it at least. The cabbie, he was here because he wanted to show him the rest.
'Well, I hope we can look after each other.' He said finally.'Try not to do anything too disgusting or, you know, burny while I'm gone - and for god's sake eat something. You can't live on shortbread.'
He purposely looked out onto the street. No sign of anything yet. ‘This is all just transport.’ Sherock gestured at himself.
Sherlock got home after two in the morning on the 21st. He'd not slept or ate in more than a day and barely drank so when it struck him he felt a little ropey he put it down to that.
'I dont.' John lied unconvincingly. He was surveying the detritus of his packing on the floor. Matt deserved more. A bed, a proper date even but their precarious position was only able to give them a series of rushed, if exciting, fumbles in quiet corners. A few weeks quiet should give them the opportunity to see if they had something more.
‘Not my taste mate.’ Barnes broke in. ‘Even if I wasn’t spoken for.’ Barnes tapped his wedding ring. Barnes had been with his (male) partner for fifteen years before his recent marriage.
‘Yeah, he's a detective, police detective. I'll introduce you. He's had a bit of a rough time lately with the divorce and all.’ John finished casually.
‘Better. I'm ready now for..well.’ Sherlock wasn't normally shy of asking for what he needed but in his own living room with someone who'd made him toast it was
' Yes but how...You could live with me.' John's mouth dropped open so quickly that Sherlock wondered latte didn't dribble out. 'What I mean is I've just moved into a flat, there's a spare room, not that is insist on you using the spare room but if you wanted your own space. It's central, near the tube, the landlady...'
'You fixed my leg.' John spoke lightly in an effort to leaven the moment, because in truth he found this stuff no easier than Sherlock. He brought his chin to rest on th detective's chest staring up at him with what he hoped was his best boyish smile.
John had just got settled in his room when Julie showed him in. 'Sorry, didn't know what else to do.' Joe said, heavy, tired eyes meeting Johns.
‘When he died a few months later I dropped out of the course. Went travelling on my own for a bit that's when I first went to Japan.I had enough money to have a go at painting full time.Thing was I missed him John, felt like a bastard for splitting up with him the way I did.’ Victor stopped, smiling at a couple who murmured compliments as they passed.
The mood shifted a little when they got the text announcing Mycroft was half an hour away. Sherlock was silent as he dressed.
He dragged his chair closer to John as the surgeon left. Taking his good hand and kissing the knuckles. 'It'll be alright you know.'
He couldn't decide what was causing his brother greater offence. His latest sample for drug testing or the chunky mugs of tea in which the teabags still floated. Sherlock had deliberately chosen the no frills café for the meeting to annoy his older sibling. Small victories.
'I had to finish ... to finish this work. It’s only a matter of time. I know he will find me.' Soo Lin said, settling the pot carefully on her workbench.
‘It's fine. Give me a minute.’ Sherlock gestured in the direction of the bathroom. His bladder was demanding his attention and he wanted to wash his face, clean his teeth.
'Yeah- he hates the hat, just a newspaper thing.' John said. Sherlock smiled, one of his broad, charming, fake smiles and John felt muscle tense under his hand.
…’ The Doctor stopped and cleared his throat. A shame, when his blood was up John had a filthy mouth. ‘...that I like the idea of you bearing my pups but it's more than that. You're brilliant, I've enjoyed this.’ The doctor stalked closer. ‘You
'Hello! Not coming in there was a delivery. I'll leave you to it.' Mrs Hudson giggled as she descended the stairs.
'Student night.' Greg explained as they got out the cab and moved towards a side door. John was surprised, in spite of their conversation, when Greg gently took his hand.
' You Ok- everything good with Molly?' John said tucking his phone into his inside pocket, noting the pensive look.
Then John could do nothing but lie and listen, each sound all too clear. The rapid footsteps, the shouts in a language John recognised but didn't understand, the sickening click of a weapon ready to fire, the last ditch shouts as Matt pleaded.
The cold case John had brought him in hospital needed leg work, literally, but he was obviously in no state to do that. He could ask John but was somehow reluctant for the omega to go out working by himself. Partly it was because Sherlock was a control freak when it came to the work but mainly it was his alpha brain coming back on-line. He knew, on some level, he wanted to protect the post-heat, newly bred omega. It was distracting nonsense. John Watson, Captain Watson, would have laughed at the notion of needing such protection from him-and rightly so.
He had been lucky, he didn’t feel it. He knew that people with this sort of injury didn’t rejoin their unit, didn’t ever wield a scalpel again. They went home. Whatever that meant.
‘You should. We could split it, remember? Anyway it's not just that. I have a fan apparently. Moriarty is the name. The cabbie told me before he died.’
‘Yes. I would rather tell Lestrade myself. Internal communication in the Met is not all it might be.’ The alpha handed him a top of the range phone, rather at odds with his plain, functional wardrobe.
‘I can’t imagine it’s the healthiest of relationships, given his line of work. The train ticket isn't his, not when he has this’ Sherlock waved a fancy looking car key. ‘A driver's car, he never uses the train.Then there are the receipts, small amounts, food and so on. He has a budget to run the place. If he can afford that car he’s not micromanaging his grocery budget.
John came to sit, in the closer chair this time, resting his folded hands on the edge of the bed. 'Look, I'm sorry. I know I must have been a bloody nightmare, especially for, well, someone like you. Next time I'll make sure I'm well gone out of the flat before I'm anywhere close to starting...'
'You noticed, very good-youll do.' Sherlock rewarded him with an appreciative glance. 'Of course it could just be that they're the ones who have that sort of jewellery, wear it, but I suspect there's more to it. They're people who drink infrequently, are perhaps less savvy about personal security. The thieves can probably pick them out...and that is our cue.' Sherlock watched the waiters disappear through the staff door that led to the kitchens and pulled John along to follow.
So it was that the three of them were travelling home in the unaccustomed luxury of one if Mycroft's cars. Cream leather interior and one of those electric screens between them and the driver. Molly napping between them, as the detective explained the paint flakes.
‘I assume your lot have been to everything they own themselves, checked there?’ John said, walking about a bit to try and wake up.
‘I want to…’ Sherlock broke off embarrassed. ‘When I touched you- the way you filled my hand...I couldn’t stop thinking about it afterwards. After I realised you weren’t a violent criminal of course. After I came to know you.’ Sherlock clarified. ‘I am not explaining myself very well.’
Another thing, if you spot plot holes do let me know. I've still got a couple of things to tidy up in the next chapter but I'm sure there will be a case fic thing I've forgotten.
‘She’s not merchandise not to him, he was standing guard over her until she was able to use this he waved a train ticket. ‘It’s an open ticket, Durham. He probably has family in that area.’
‘As I explained before, not my area.’ Sherlock stared hard at the street outside number twenty two. It should not be possible, he reflected, to have this awkward a conversation with someone whose semen is inside you.
‘Places they know are empty.’ Sally caught on. ‘We can get one-Lucy?’ Sally was on her feet. Coming to stand behind the young omegas computer. Directing her to particular files.
John pushed the knot home with a sharp broken sound, emptying himself in a series of violent pulses. Sherlock,the needy omega part at least, secretly loved this, the sensation of the alpha filling him with semen. The sheer volume a turn on.
Scented and dressed a few minutes later he crossed the room to squeeze Sherlock's hand briefly. Sherlock leaned forward lips brushing his ear. 'Be safe.'
By the way, anyone who's following my other omegaverse story, True Nature. This had not been abandoned, despite appearances and I should be posting a new chapter by the end of the week or thereabouts. This was a first go at case fic and I had written myself into a corner.
Sherlock must have crept in because the next thing John knew he was in the doorway. Leaning on one crutch, staring at John in a way that made his stomach flip.
‘I don’t suppose I could borrow a cigarette before you do?’ Sherlock said, hoping Lestrade would catch on. They had both been on the patches for months.
John was right on both counts. True, even Sherlock had enough sense of propriety not to want to make that sort of a mess in a borrowed car. Mostly though something primal wanted him to be inside John when he came, to fill his mate with semen, John obviously felt the same. It was stupid really, John was taking contraceptives, they couldn't get pregnant, didn't want to (yet anyway) but the natural urge was there.
Sherlock instinctively tightened his grip for a few seconds but nodded against the sandy hair, brushing a damp lock off his forehead.
'Are you alright?' Sherlock passed his brother a cup of what passed for tea in Molly's office. It had been liberally laced with Scotch from a bottle left over from the Morgue's Christmas drinks at Dimmocks suggestion.
It didn't hurt, not really, not when compared to the relief. It wasn't just having something inside him, good, right as that felt. It was the mix of hormones, his, the alphas. An effect that only increased each time the alpha took him.
Joe turned, face flushed and sweating. 'Came on suddenly. First time in ages I've had no warning.' He looked apologetic. John crouched beside him, lifting his wrist and taking his speeding pulse.
'I know, we can see how it goes.' John leaned in for a stroke of his hair. No need to say that ,safe at home, they might hate the sight of each other.
Sherlock got to his feet, smoothing down his suit. He gently prised the mug from John's grasp. 'Will you dance with me?' Sherlock held a hand out. 'Please? We seem to have music whether we want it or not.'
Greg leaned across and kissed John's hair, the colourful lights of the dancefloor behind them reflecting off his face.
He moved to press the older man against his chest, oblivious to the way he was dripping on the floor. He was still getting used to how that felt, being dragged along at the heels of a chemical reaction. His conscious brain unable to keep up with how fast the hormones were bouncing off each other. He knew he was overreacting, that John was in no physical danger, just upset, but he luxuriated in the stirring of his protective side.
'Would it be possible to see his booking form or whatever you use?' Sherlock asked crouching to look under the desk.
‘No, right from the very beginning Lauriston Gardens. John, will you come with me?’ He felt the need of the the soothing presence.
'Thanks. Something's been delivered here you'll want to see-Who is that with you?' As John asked the question he recognised the distinctive voice-
Matt looked up at him and held out a hand. 'Can you come here? Its Like you're a doctor like this. Take your clothes off.'
‘Well, we don't have it. Look, I have to go but if you need anything looked up or whatever ask Lucy that brought you in.’ She nodded towards the nervous young uniformed omega. ‘I won’t pretend I’m happy about it but I’m not too proud to admit you're probably his best chance at the moment.’ Sally left them in the room ,quietly joining the group of officers as they filed towards the lift.
'Right,' Greg said. 'Lets try this one.' A sound file started to play and they all listened intently. John perched on the arm of Sherlock's chair and a hand came to rest gently on his back.
‘Sherlock, I know where Lukis had been, where he was going, it all fits the Chinese connection too...can you meet me there?’
‘Much, for now anyway.’ John's hand rested on his knee for a few moments before sliding up his thigh. Sherlock luxuriated briefly in the sensation before firmly lifting John's hand away.
John gently lifted the hand from his thigh. 'Look Matt, you’ve only just started in the army. You've only just found out about being an omega. You don't want to saddle yourself with me, not now. I'm going to be no use to you for a while.' John glanced down into his lap, trying to keep it light. That was true at least. It was impossible to imagine ever feeling physical desire again. He dropped Matt's hands and pulled back a little.
‘We should have dinner.’ He said finally, practical. ‘I've got some stuff for pasta you can start to this after.’
'I understand the chemistry doctor.' Sherlock almost snapped. The young man blushed and fumbled through the notes.
‘I hope you don't mind, I got soaked in that rain coming here.' The alpha, tugged the collar and smiled broadly.
‘Sorry that was me.’ Sherlock said, wiping his hands on a discarded shirt before offering it to John. John was confused for a moment until Sherlock reached for his phone on the coffee table. ‘Irene. She customised her text noise. Just asking how I got on.’ Sherlock began to type.
Further thoughts were shattered by another kiss. He was kissed by alphas occasionally but it was usually uncoordinated, graceless, a precursor to being fucked. This seemed to exist in its own right, soft and careful but insistent as John's tongue explored his mourh. He felt himself sag into the sensation.
'Well, I think after that it's fair to suggest that your hormones are going back to normal, don't you?' John said smirking. 'Anyway, you never did tell me. What got you so excited in that alley the other day?'
'It upset you.' Sherlock said, a hand coming to touch his shoulder. John sort of wanted to shrug the placating gesture off but didn't.
'How is this going to work then, do I know you or what?' John said, he couldn't pretend that he wasn't the tiniest bit pissed off with Sherlock for muscling in. This had been, for a change, his thing.
'Thanks. You could just have said we were lost. Not made out we were looking for somewhere to have sex.' John said with a sideways look, really trying not to let himself be flattered.
Upstairs it was a little more business-like. Greg was swearing under his breath at a laptop while Sherlock was draped over his chair, tie rakishly undone. Like a bored James Bond.
'These items were found and handed in, we'll be looking for their owners of course.' The woman said smoothly, smiling at Greg with amusement over the little misunderstanding.
She raised her eyebrows. ‘You know what. Those readings are what you'd expect with an established bond. That paper I showed you…’ She started to flick through a pile of journals on a shelf.
to go home smelling of another omegas heat.If he’s a regular, if he’s done this before he might know something. If you taunt him a little about his father-in-law's money he might give something away in anger.’
‘I’m not his date.’ John said a little half-heartedly with a sidelong glance at Sherlock. Angelo, with considerable theatricality, told the story of how Sherlock had cleared his name (he had but only a bit) and insisted his money was no good before leaving them with menus.
'They're cleaning.' Sherlock said, recognising the alpha they'd arrested. The one who was involved with one of the omegas. He was bundling up cardboard while someone else worked with a scrubbing brush and bucket.
He was just telling Greg about how well his sister was doing when the inspector’s phone went. Greg excused himself to take the call and Sherlock, obviously hoping for something interesting, followed him.
‘I'd have done that.’ John said, frowning. Traditionally of course, the alpha took care of an omega during their heat. Sherlock didn't expect it.
Greg answered at an almost whisper, another voice in the background. 'Wasn't expecting to hear from you yet. Congratulations.'
' I have a sort of arrangement with one of my neighbours for her heats but that's all it is.' Lestrade shrugged. 'Its good in its own way. No one's pretending it's something it's not.'
The alpha was already there, still working on his laptop. His scent was pleasant enough, like woodsmoke. He glanced up at Sherlock. ‘How far along do you feel?’
Truthfully it was a lot more complicated than minding or not. Yes his flat mate was attractive but getting involved with his work, his world, had gotten John the excitement he’d been looking for when he’d gone to buy sex in the first place. So he had somehow became friend, flat mate, blogger. It was all fine, mostly fine.
. He knew the voice but allowed himself a few seconds of denial until he turned round, his expression forced into neutral. Jason looked the same as ever, gorgeous. Tall, blonde with a swimmers build.
'Good as new are we?' John said as they came through the door. 'I know that cast came off early. Don't want to know how you persuaded them.'
‘We need to get vehicles, get a helicopter. This phone battery won’t last forever.’ Sherlock stood and paced, Lestrade already on his phone.
The stale alpha fear smell assaulted his nose along with a faint smell of decay as soon as he got inside the flat and he already knew what he'd find as he broke down the locked bedroom door. Ignoring John's shouts from outside.
‘Where did you go?’ John said stirring, muffled by the pillow. He reached out a hand and Sherlock took it, unthinking. John pulled him back on to the bed and into a comfortable pheromone heavy embrace.
There was only ten minutes of visiting left and John knew he should really go but sitting so close he was drawn to Sherlock's scent all over again. Post heat it soothed rather than inflamed and he felt his own drowsiness catching up with him. He rested, just for a second, on the scratchy blanket, his head pillowed on his arms next to the detective, somehow ridiculously comfortable.
The alpha set his cup in its saucer carefully. ‘Well, I've done it before. Lots of times.’ He smiled coolly reassuring. ‘It's ninety percent instinct Sherlock. You just need to let it happen.’
'Its alright, give yourself a minute.' John smirked, Sherlock looked wrecked. 'It won't take much.' He leaned in towards the alphas ear. 'I was halfway there just from the feeling of you in my mouth.'
John stretched out his shoulders in a small celebration. Last night's interrupted sleep was taking its toll and the morning surgery had been busy. An early emergency of an elderly lady who 'didn't want to bother the doctor' with her chest pain had given way to a never-ending line of people with cystitis, flu and assorted tummy troubles. He hadn't even had a chance to think about last night, or this morning, when he'd woken up curled around a sound asleep but obviously aroused alpha.
‘That was the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever done.’ John said, his scent amplified by exertion. Like this he smelt of summer. Cut grass and sun. Sherlock tried to shake off the romantic notion.
'Seriously though, it's been nice. Maybe before I start this job I could come visit you? You could show me the sights?'
' Yeah but not the way you think. I thought about it, lying beside you but I didn't want to take advantage.'
‘John and yes, obviously I want to... I’m open to suggestions. If you..I mean is that part of the service or do you need specific instructions?’ John was aware he sounded like the rookie he was but didn’t care.
'I'm sorry.' Sherlock exclaimed breathlessly, to John's confusion until the omega realised he was looking at John's still hard cock.
He had Sherlock sit on a dining chair beside him. The injured arm resting on the table as he cleaned it. It wasn't as bad as he'd thought once the mud was gone and all that was needed was a proper clean and a bandage. As he worked he became aware of a faint scent, a scent that had to be from the last time Lestrade visited. The alpha policeman smelled lovely and John put it down to his heat because he'd never really noticed Lestrade in that way before.
'Because it's us.' Sherlock supplied. 'Because it's not just about being overwhelmed by pheromones.' The detective turned away and John looked down into his lap.
'You Ok?' John said softly, though it was redundant. Sherlock looked utterly content, eyes closed below him.
‘Next time.’ John was right there with him anticipating the moment when he would feel Sherlock’s semen hit his belly. ‘Plenty of time for that love.’ He sloppily kissed Sherlock’s open mouth. Reflecting that this felt a hundred times more intimate than the last time he’d had penetrative sex and that it would be over too soon. ‘Are you getting close? I know I am. Thinking about you inside me.’ He had a sense of Sherlock’s muscles tightening a notch and the movement of hips and hands losing rhythm. ‘I want to be able to feel you for days.’ John finished with the cringe worthy porn line but it did the trick. Sherlock began to come.
Truth be told he blamed most of his sister's problems on presenting late. John had made most of the big decisions of his teenage years knowing he was a servant of his biology, at least up to a point. Harry was sixteen before the proto-heat that heralded the start of puberty. More than that his parents were already noting with pride the interest their assumed alpha daughter was taking in omegas. They were kindly people who accepted her for what she was but Harry never forgave herself for robbing them of an alpha child, even after they died in the car crash a few years later.
'You have lovely hands-among other things.' John growled relaxing under his touch, allowing Sherlock to handle his balls, bury his face in the crook of his neck. 'I'd like to taste you.' John didn't specify where and, as it turned out, he meant everywhere.
He wanted to say but didn't. He was conscious of the police around him Lestrade at least had the decency to pretend to check his phone but the others took obvious delight in watching the two of them. It was Lestrade who broke the tension.
The alpha nodded. ‘No rush get comfortable and have some tea. I have emails to finish anyway.’ The alpha turned back to his laptop. It was as if they were about to have some sort of meeting.
'Yeah, even I could have worked out that one.' John said, placing the thing among the clutter on the coffee table and going back out to retrieve a shopping bag. It contained milk and a few other groceries along with a tea towel of still warm scones (Mrs Hudson was a saint). At the very bottom was a pile of mail. Bills and junk that could wait but a handwritten padded envelope addressed to him caught his eye.
It was, just as Murray had said, like a posh hotel. Quiet conversations went on all around and there were a surprising number of female clients. The only thing that would tell you this wasn’t a sales conference would be the eccentric (though obviously expensive) clothes some of the staff wore. John sipped a glass of white wine as he watched a woman two stools away in a red corseted ball gown. She was talking to a male customer obviously easily thirty years her junior. She stroked his cheek, whispered in his ear and then summoned another female (presumably the aforementioned Kate) for the deal to be done.
‘Water, get cleaned up.’ He said as he handed John a bottle, the alpha took a deep drink before setting it decisively aside.
Molly checked a clipboard. 'Not at all. He'd been- you know-thawed.' Her mouth fell open as she caught up with Sherlock's thinking. He was left for you. Fuck-who does that?'
It took a further few seconds for John to realise two things. One, Lestrade hadn't been to the flat in weeks and two the scent got stronger the more he leaned into Sherlock, which he was doing unconsciously, his head far closer than medically necessary to Sherlock's chest.
‘They could be coming and going all night-fuck’ Sally swore, gathering up her body armour again and fiddling with her phone. ‘Be ready in five minutes.'
They walked to the side of the building in a casual roundabout way. The lock on the temporary site door was laughably easy.
'You didn't know what it was worth?' Dimmock said doubtfully, holding an evidence bag open for the modest jade pin, only distinguished by the dragon design.
‘It's how it felt. It was more than that though, than sex, he has interesting work, an interesting life.’
They investigated the possibility of the symbol being a bona fide graffiti tag with one of Sherlock's street contacts to no avail.
'Lestrade suggested that.' Sherlock broke in. 'but if it were that simple you wouldn't be here.' He pressed the tips of his fingers together, waiting for a response from his brother.
When his breathing has got back to normal he adjusted his scarf in the mirror. The marks on his throat were reddish though not as widespread as he'd feared. There had been no hesitation, they'd done this before, probably many times. Within the last few days this organisation, perhaps this very individual had killed two, maybe three times. He'd been allowed to live. Why?
‘Of course you can.’ John said,going for his best disarming smile and holding arms away from his body.
‘Yeah. What's up’ When he met the other doctors eye the expression told him it wasn't a conversation to be had in the medical tent. ‘Shall we go for a wander then?’ Bill nodded and a few minutes later they were walking round a quiet area of the base. Only a few soldiers working around the storage containers.
'You did though.' Sherlock was looking at him keenly. John decided he might want scotch instead. He split the difference, splashing spirit into the steaming mugs, before carrying them back to Sherlock's chair and sitting back on the arm, glad he was facing away from the piercing stare.
‘Are you ready?’ John breathed, kneading his hips. He had a sarcastic response, something about a written invitation probably, on the tip of his tongue but somehow a murmured
' I checked, the doctor is coming to see you once he's dealt with an emergency.' The alpha said, lifting his own tea and pushing the paper cup towards Sherlock.
'I should and you are but I'd rather know what you're up to. Make sure you're inside the tent pissing out kind of thing.'
Something about the place was registering with his former self, the one who needed to know where to get drugs in apparently respectable neighbourhoods. The positioning near a wealthy suburb, the security, all rang bells.
'That's not all that goes on between you and your team is it? That's quite a distinctive sliver of foil wrapper on the floor,
‘The doors locked, Mrs Hudson is out. Your flat mate may come back of course…oh no wait, that’s me.’ Sherlock’s lips curled mischievously.
His mouth watered in anticipation as he messily licked the scent gland, an arm wrapping around John's chest.
'I know, that's a myth you know, that you'll burst into flames if you go more than ten miles outside the M25.' John smirked over the rim of his cup.
Sherlock nodded. 'Or perhaps, with your inevitable aggression and sexual frustrations at knowing your omega has been with someone else.' Either way if you're wearing recording equipment you'll have him admitting criminal activity.'
'There's no hurry. Just lie here with me and we'll see how it goes. For a start we've got too many clothes on.' John had his own pyjamas off in seconds and couldn't help but smile at the way the alpha looked at him, hungrily but still slightly anxious as he straddled his still clothed hips.
Sherlock was struck with the realisation that he liked being handled by John Watson. He'd never liked that before, not really. With his few previous partners he'd accepted the all over touching and stroking as the price of the biological imperative of ejaculation. Here he began to understand the term 'foreplay' and found he was participating enthusiastically. His own hands had found their way under johns jacket and were exploring a firm chest. Then, close to the left shoulder, his fingers hit on something rougher and John seized under his hand. He pulled back.
'I've looked at that file, the old one. It's personal isn't it.'Sherlock started, not a question. He sat back down, hands clasped, trying not to meet Greg's eye.
'Look at me.' John shuffled around using his leg as leverage to force the embarrassed alpha to meet his eye.
John was regretting taking this shift now. He'd felt obliged because he'd been otherwise occupied so much recently and frankly he was a bit broke. He'd came straight off the train from Harry's. All he could think of if he dared to let his mind drift was Sherlock's scent and the way their limbs had tangled so naturally together.
'Well, the thing is his brother asked that you be treated as next of kin in his absence.' She raised her eyes and read John's blank expression.
He deleted that, soppy was all very well but he only tolerated smileys from John even his mother didn't get away with it.
'Anthea? I need a favour- from both of you- he once told me he could procure an invite to anything. This shouldn't be too much of a challenge. I will of course need an appropriate plus one.'
'The licensing sergeant turned up, he's talking to Jim now. Reports of selling alcohol to minors apparently . Think we should make ourselves scarce.' Greg said,sliding his hand around John's waist.
He sent the alpha the other instructions for his heat in a series of texts. The explanation of the data he collected and his insistence that this was a one time only
'We processed the workshop and a few people confirmed he smoked outside the fire escape. Anderson spotted a smear of blood on the brick, then they processed the alley too, found another tiny smear on the door you opened.'
'I'm just surprised your weird flatmate hasn't scared them off yet. Night John.' She said, yawning half the sentence as she got up.
Captain Watson had been a skilled battlefield surgeon invalided home at the peak of his powers. A tremor in his hand following a nasty gunshot wound meant he could no longer operate, even in civilian life.
‘Of course you’re sure why. You’re always sure why. You thought that the likelihood was a man visiting a brothel didn’t go there to be buggered. You had me right the first time though, like always, I’d have been happy with a nice hand job. As it is I got something much better.’ Sherlock’s face softened below him and he realised things had gotten awfully soppy for a a sticky fumble.
He was hovering around the hotel room where Lestrade's technician had set up. A powerful telescope stood at the window and a complicated looking laptop was linked to a listening device that was attached to John’s shirt collar. Lestrade himself was waiting at a discreet distance with a phalanx of heavily armed officers, someone senior from serious crimes. It all seemed like overkill to Sherlock.
‘I may be able to help him with that.’ I'm texting him a number, he should mention my name.’ Sherlock said, rapidly tapping his phone. Mycroft, he knew, would help with this. ‘Give him some time.’
The omega's scent was getting stronger as his heat drew closer. Sherlock, while not distracted with the case, was torturing himself with doubts. He worried about being found lacking in some way, about somehow not being enough of an alpha for John. Or worse, about losing control, being too rough. He tried to focus on the task at hand.
John, as the least debauched of the two, went to the door. Almost overwhelmed by the floral scent as he opened it and lifted a huge arrangement of roses and sweet peas inside.
'I don't even know your name.’ The alpha sounded almost irritated but his eyes told a different story he looked awed almost.
‘Could just be billed to the wrong month.’ Harry shrugged, breaking a piece of shortbread. John though knew the look, Sherlock had something.
They left the dance floor again a few minutes later after a slow number. Greg's hand firm in the small of his back. As he leaned in to the alpha John sincerely wished it was Sherlock's touch. He wished they were scented, marked ,bonded. He wished there was no doubt.
. He had pressed the sheet of paper to his face unconsciously and had to pull it away sharply when the technician stepped into the bathroom.
It felt incredibly decadent somehow lying here in a pile of high end pillows as a battle hardened soldier rubbed himself off against you. Sherlock was acutely aware of John's thick length rubbing over his balls, the pressure of each fingertip on his hips and arse.
'Yeah, first murder of any sort actually, if Greg wasn't on holiday...' Dimmock sighed and leaned wearily against the wall. 'What do you want?'
The thought of a heavily pregnant omega was, he knew, a common alpha fantasy but this was rather more than that. It led off into other thoughts about adapting the flat and redecorating and...
Getting John to send the text, showing him the suitcase was all about seeing how far he would go.Sherlock was surprised, impressed. John had been kidnapped, interrogated (sort of) and was now blithely contacting a murderer and concealing evidence from the police.
'Lestrade has got something he wants you to see.' He said, looking strangely at the paper which Sherlock shoved into his pocket.
'You didn't. If you'd scared me I'd have had you on the floor. Broken ankle or not. What was that about?' John tentatively sipped his tea. That wasn't actually quite true, he'd had a few seconds of panic when the alpha towered over him but it was as much to do with his own response as Sherlock's clumsy attempt at-something.
'Besides it's not so bad the way I do it- heat. Getting shagged silly for a few days by a good looking soldier- much better than silicone.' He looked for a scandalized reaction from the detective as he laid out supplies, but his voice seemed to have barely registered-as usual. John knew he was more forthright than most omegas who were brought up to be pretty much ashamed of their heats.
'True, unless one of you cares to open it for us. I don't think this is anyone's first offense and cooperation is looked on favourably. Perhaps my police friend could confirm?'
‘Love one.’ Sherlock took a step closer. ‘I wanted you to see me and think of what happened. What might have happened. I wanted to make my intentions clear because this sort of thing…I thought the clothes, the wine, Would put across what I meant.’ Sherlock paused and inhaled sharply. ‘Say something John.’
