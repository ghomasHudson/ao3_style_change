“I can’t believe you remember that, son,” John shook his head at Dean in disbelief. “We only visited the place one time for a couple of days”.
Dean sniffed, whipped a hand over his face, and nodded to himself in acceptance, he made his way back to the comfort of his impala and crawled into the front seat.
He should have seen Cas’s reaction coming, really. Each time he had woken up tangled in Cas’s limbs Dean had made some kind of shitty comment. “We clearly need to get laid”, or sometimes a simple “Get off me, Sleeping Beauty”, and on the rare and special occasions when Cas still had his grace (and therefore had stayed awake all night, simply happy enough to not wake Dean from where he lay, a cage of limbs enveloping the angel) he’d hit him with something along the lines of “What the hell is wrong with you, man? That’s so creepy”. You know, just to make sure he really let Cas know how safe and comfortable and loved he had made Dean feel.
“Coming for who?” Sam muttered, her eyes continued to look through Deanna as if she weren’t there. D scrubbed her hand across her brow.
“Okay. Okay”, He ripped his arm from her grasp, “Would you quit it and let me do it. Jeeze”. He pulled his shirt off both arms and set it down on the seat beside him before dramatically circling his arm up and slapping it down on the table in front of them, “Ta-da!” Charlie smiled and nodded at his bare arm, impressed, before her eyes landed on Dean’s other arm, just by his T-shirt sleeve. Her smile faded as her face turned to a look of unease.
“Don’ worry about it,” Keven said, trying to hold in a burp. “I should probably make sure she's okay”, he explained before stumbling off, over to where she sat in the corner still playing on her phone. Dean shot the rest of his drink and placed it on the bench. His buzz had finally given him the courage he needed. He’d decided he would go bust up the angel's dumb little clique that they’ve been hiding in all night and insist that they all mingle like adults.
Now feeling more comfortably uncomfortable in her own clothes Dianna pulled the Impala into a parking space. The two sisters paced up and down the long maze of storage containers until finding the one numbered 542 and after sneakily cutting the padlock on the roller door of the storage container and putting the bolt cutters back into the boot of the car Dianna stood back staring at the corrugated metal, wringing her hands.
“Uh, yeah” Sam swallowed, “window at the end of the hall, next left.” Sam sped up, her long legs taking giant strides.
“Son.” John, in his familiar brown leather jacket, stood beside Mary now, giving her a nod as she stepped aside. Dean noticed that the rest of the guests mingled over by the bar, taking seats, and began drinking, allowing their family room to catch up.
“Ryan!” The man stated, fumbling to hold his pen and notebook in one hand so he could then extend the other toward Deanna.
"I mean, yeah. Obviously, I can see way more shit than I could before, and I barely understand any of it yet, but I don't have to take a dump ever again, and this new heaven still gives you the perks of pizza and hotdogs, so I guess it
“Okay, Gordon Ramsey. Well, I’m gonna put on a pot of coffee, you wanna join me?” He asked as he pulled himself up out of the bed, placing his robe on from where it draped over the back of his chair, removing his phone from its charger, and placing it in his robe pocket.
"You still teaching your Hacking... class... thing at the bunker these days, Mr. Robot?" Sam made a face at the reference.
He lathered himself in soap, scrubbing at his skin as his thoughts turned to hell. Alastair cutting into him and pulling him apart just so he could put him back together again and violate him, pumping into him, laughing, while Dean’s screams gurgled as his throat filled with blood.
“It’s okay.” Cas echoed again. “Everything’s okay”. Dean’s breathing slowed until finally, it returned to a somewhat normal pace, only then did Castiel’s grip loosen around him, and was Dean able to swat at the few stray tears on his face. “You okay?” Cas lifted his head from Dean’s shoulder, his voice was gentle. Dean turned to him, seeing the concern plainly visible in his blue eyes.
"It's really great," Jack announced. "It is hard to see all that pain... but it helps to know I'm making a difference." he sighed. "I'm sorry I couldn't make it last night", His tone somber. Cas placed his hand on the back of Jack's seat and turned to look out the back window, sparing a quick look at his husband. He and Dean locked eyes for a moment and an amorous smirk rose up on Dean's face.
"Jack," he said gruffly. He scratched his freshly shaved face, looked up, and stared off into the distance at the now cracked bowl and empty packaging. There was a fourth option, he realized, for if He didn't show. "I'm not leaving," he declared, eyes darting around at the lack of people. "You hear me? I've got nowhere to be!" He smiled and nodded absentmindedly as his eyes started to burn. "I have nothing left..." he shook his head. He hated so much to admit it, that the tears suddenly broke free of his eyes and ran down his face. He was always so certain of himself and his role in the world and fought like hell for the freedom to choose his own life and now that he had everything he'd ever wished for he found himself feeling worse off than ever. He desperately wanted what Sam had. The certainty he exuded. He could feel his brother leaving him behind again and knew he needed to find something to grab on to. He was desperate for something, anything that felt right in this new world. The closest he'd got was his dog and fixing up cars and while that would be enough to keep him alive he knew it wouldn't ever be enough to make him happy.
“I don’t, but I will do it for you”. Cas smiled solemnly. Dean snickered, he couldn’t help but still feel trapped in the small hallway, Castiel merely a foot away.
"Okay, say for argument's sake, I agree with this, then what? Hell, where does a Shadow even go when it croaks?" Dean asked, scratching his face, fidgeting.
Dean’s last thoughts in this life were one’s full of guilt. He considered his brother's face, so completely full of grief and fear and he knew he was the source of that pain. He pleaded with his brother, suddenly completely stricken with the horrible idea that Sam would resent him for choosing this for them both; that Dean had chosen to die rather than watch his younger brother die.
"Did he now?... That's funny 'cause Cas knows my Shrink says drinking is an "unhealthy coping mechanism,"" he began, grinning smugly "And I'm so well adjusted now'days, and so in touch with my emotions, that I'm basically Gandhi." He professed, scratching his face. "Besides, I haven't really wanted to drink since we opened the bar. Watching all the barflies three-sheets-to-the-wind themselves every night gives me PTSD" he joked, brows raised and a smile. Sam pursed his lips at the flippant use of the term before continuing.
“Dean!” Jack called. His voice came out much higher pitch, younger sounding than Dean had ever heard. Jack wriggled frantically in an attempt at an escape and Castiel placed the toddler on the ground. Dean laughed as Jack ran kneelessly toward him, his torso covered by a shirt that read "In my defense, I was left unsupervised". Jack enveloped Dean's shins in a tight hug.
“It’s wonderful isn't it?” Dean’s eyes flicked from the angel back to the foreign stars that blinked from the infinite expanse above him.
pretty,” Dean remarked with an eyebrow pump as Cas flinched at the pain from Jack’s toddler feet pinching his thigh to the grassy floor of the bedroom.
“Can Rebecca play too, Jack?” Castiel asked, causing Jack to peer over Dean's shoulder at the angel sitting at his desk. He frowned and shrunk back down staring at his bear in his hands.
“You certainly haven’t looked worse”. Cas swallowed hard, trying not to think about what he’d just glimpsed.
“What, you need something else?” he asked. Castiel’s chest squeezed again at the sight of him, the youthful look to Dean this new memory jolted Castiel free of his memory’s form and left him down on all fours, gasping for air.
“Welcome me to the neighborhood? What are you talking about?” He asked, looking between the two angels. Gabriel and Balthazar looked at each other in confusion.
“You wanna take a look at that and let me know where the hell it is I’m supposed to be going?” She asked and flicked the indicator, changing lanes to overtake a small hatchback. Sam stared down at the book in front of her.
“D, I’m coming with you whether you like it or not.” Deanna considered throwing a punch then and there; hitting her sister right in the sweet spot and knocking her out for her own safety, then, however, she imagined her sister passed out lying in the muddy concrete in the cold because there was no way in hell that Dianna would be able to move her back to the warmth of the Impala. She sighed.
Turns out that the bar that Charlie had asked them all to meet had a beer garden that spilled out onto the main street where the march was already taking place. Castiel and Dean dodged and weaved through the group of people on the road that stood directly out the front of the beer garden, seemingly held up by the traffic of the other many, many groups taking part in the march. Charlie, dressed in glitter and rainbows head to toe, stood from where she sat at one of the picnic tables and approached them at the gate, yelling at the security guard to allow them in while the crowd clapped and cheered as the march started moving again.
“I’m betting a single splinter would take you out at this point. Kill you for good this time, and as much as I love to find out where you’ll be sent now that there’s no more Empty, I personally wouldn’t recommend being that particular guinea pig”, Balthazar agreed.
“It sort of does. Why-- Why say all of that then?” Dean looked at the wall and scratched at his face.
After they got the information they’d needed, they made their way to (you guessed it) a barn(!) Dean drove up to the ominous wooden building with his stomach twisted. He knew he was at the end of the line and wondered how it was possible for this time to have passed so quickly.
“You were never going to go back to hell, Dean.” Cas pulled himself up to sit beside him, his hand rubbing up and down Dean’s right arm. “And as for the rest of that there's no point in worrying about what could have been, we’re here now and--”
“And that's another thing, how come Jack remembers who I am but, what, he just blocked out all the horrible things I said to him?" He focused on pushing the vegetables around in the pot, lathering them in oil. It was all coming out now. Everything he'd been so careful to avoid talking about; everything he'd been scared shitless to mention, yet, had been eating him up inside for the last two weeks/month(?). "He
“A demon… Mean?” He placed his finger to his mouth as if pretending lost in thought, “Seems somewhat plausible... do, please, go on.” Dean bumped his shoulder against Cas’s playfully and then his smile faltered.
“Luke”. The man stated as he extended a hand toward Dean offering him to shake it. Dean stared at it for a full three seconds before grasping the man's hand in his own, figuring,
“And then have to deal with trying to get him to go back to sleep? Nah. I’ll pass, thanks.” Dean turned as a short, hippy-looking man with wavy grey hair, in long denim overalls, and no shoes appeared from in the hallway.
“He’s found a new vessel. A twenty-three-year-old french man who was comatose from a motorcycle accident, yet, just alive enough to pray for death. It's quite a sad story, but the vessel is now vacant so Michael intends to stay in it for as long as possible. That's another thing The Council encourages; The use of empty vessels rather than continuing to break up families.” Cas rubbed at his eye. Dean could tell Cas was getting tired, his injuries were clearly bad enough for him to need to sleep which Dean knew meant that his grace was fading.
“Penemue is an old friend. He's been on Earth for over a Millenia providing your people with wisdom”. Dean frowned and sat back down, placing his feet back upon the map table, crossing his ankles, and leaning his back against the chair.
“I guess-- it's like,” He felt the heat rising in his cheeks, “I don’t know, like-- Okay. Maybe I don’t have it figured out as much as I thought I did but-- It’s like, when I think about it-- All I know is that I’m done.” He gestured his hand in a line, horizontally, as if metaphorically drawing a line in the sand, “Like, I’m officially calling quits on all of it; Hanging up the hat. Ya know?” He grabbed a pinch of fries. “If something happens and this,” He raised his brows and twitched his head toward Cas, “Doesn’t pan out. I’m...” He laughed. “I don’t know, I don’t even want to think about that. But yeah, I’m-- it’s-- it's only him”. Simon nodded and stared off into the middle distance as if lost in thought, he brought his beer to his mouth and took a drink then replied.
"You don’t get it, do you! You don’t know what it's like to have an absent father!” Dean spluttered out an attempt at a scoff. He was shocked to be on the receiving end of this speech, so shocked that he could do no more but listen whilst shaking his head in astonishment. “To constantly have to work to get a
“Yeah,” Castiel replied, chuckling somewhat breathlessly, “Angel. Thingo.” He began returning the kisses until they became slower and the two’s lips parted again. Dean pressed himself against Cas as their tongues found each other. Their breathing became heavy.
“It’s like five pages in or so, he mentions having a storage container back in Lawrence full of burned shit from the house.” D raised her head, trying to see the book in her peripheral. Sam swallowed, slamming the journal closed. Deanna glanced at her younger sister, confused.
“You’re ridiculous,” he opened his door, exited the vehicle, and looked over the roof to where Dean would appear. When seeing nothing but the gleam of the sun bouncing off the car, he then crouched down and peered back inside the impala. “Come on,” his voice imitated the tone he would use when he lifted Jack from his highchair.
Lucifer, no longer pinning him down, blurred in movement all around Cas, stabbing the blade in at an angle, and plucking at the chunks formed. Cas attempted to break free again only to be pushed to his knees so Lucifer could now start the yet untouched areas of Castiel’s body.
"So--" Dean began, taking a sip of beer and breathing in Castiel's scent that now blossomed throughout the car. "The empty, huh?" Cas smelled like petrichor mixed with a woodpile; like electricity and nature. The smell was just further evidence responsible for putting Dean at ease; proof that he was truly with Cas again. “How was it? Does it make your top ten list of vacation spots?” Cas smiled at Dean solemnly.
“Sammy” she giggled, wrapping her fist on the back of the door. “You gotta come take a look at my poster.” She said, leaning in closer to the door. There was no reply from the other end. Deanna pushed the door open expecting to find her sister asleep in her bed but the room was completely empty; the way it had looked when they had first arrived the day before, all beyond one book sitting open upon the bed. “Sam?!” Deanna called louder over her shoulder as she walked toward the book, her heartbeat thumping hard against her chest. She saw the familiar leather cover framing the tattered paper pages and knew immediately what had happened. She didn't need to see how few pages sat on the right-hand side of the book to guess what entry it had been that Sam had just read.
"You gonna invite me in to see this place or am I gonna have to come back after dark with a flashlight and break in."
"Dean... for you? I can wait an eternity". Cas smiled softly then pressed his lips gently against the tip of Dean's nose. Dean sighed and let his eyes flutter closed, relief spread through him. When Cas pulled back again the last of Dean's bravado had disappeared and he smiled tenderly.
"You could have let me in on what you had plann-" and as promised Dean's fist interacted with Sam's nose so hard it caused his stomach to lurch at the sound. Vomit burned as it pulsed through Dean's throat and onto the floor between the two brothers. Sam grabbed at his now bleeding nose and took a few steps back to avoid getting anything on his shoes. "Jesus! Dean!" Sam exclaimed watching his brother wipe his sleeve over his mouth before cradling his hand and shaking it as if it was an etch-a-sketch and he wished he could undo the last minute or so. "Look at yourself, man! Your drinking non-stop, hiding out here like you're afraid if you leave-"
“Castiel” he called into the sky, immediately cringing at how formal Cas’s full name sounded coming from his mouth.
Sam was waiting by the front door of the Bunker when he saw the Impala pull in. He could make out the three figures inside as the engine rolled to a stop and the familiar creak and slam of the car doors filled the morning air. The ground was still wet, it had rained overnight and the mud clung to the grooves of Sam's boots. He tried to walk over to the car as quickly as he could without slipping. He slid into the back tire and gently eased Jack out of the way, giving him a small, awkward smile, while taking Castiel's arm and lifting him up out of the back seat. Castiel looked horrible. Black leaked from his eyes, nose, mouth, and ears. His clothes were shredded in conjunction with the long, deep cuts into his body. Dean stood beside his brother ready to balance the man between the two of them. Not a word was spoken as the two brothers sandwiched the unconscious angel and pulled him in through the main entrance, Jack in toe, brow furrowed with worry. The boys took Cas into a room by the entry that they had dubbed the "infirmary" and placed him gently down on the cot. The room had mainly been used in the past for patching up small injuries they'd earned while out on a job so that they didn't track blood through the rest of the bunker. "A contained mess". Sam had once called it. Dean didn't mind the idea. He'd dragged in a minifridge to stock with saline, O negative, and whisky, and over the years the brothers continued to slowly add to the place until it became their own little emergency room.
“Alright, well call me if you need anything” he nodded, pausing to wink suggestively at Deanna and circling back through the crowd.
“You mean your homophobic tantrum?” Dean sighed and rubbed his hand over his mouth, he switched the weight in his feet awkwardly and nodded slowly.
“Oh, yes, because you’re famous for accepting the lesser of two shitty options.” Crowley droned, sarcastically.
“She was pissed, it was the middle of the night, and she looked like I’d woken her up... But I guess, she did ask me out to dinner? Said she’d visit Wednesday from South Dakota.” Dean leaned over the sink and spat.
"What do you mean?" Charlie asked, her voice seemed genuinely uncertain. Dean suddenly found it hard to breathe. A voice in his head screamed at him to hang up the phone and throw it at the wall. He imagined how satisfying it would be to watch the glass rain down across the floor as physical evidence he’d evaded a moment of vulnerability.
“Sam--”, Dean repeated in a mirroring tone. Dean threw up his best smirk. “I’m fine... As fine as I can be. Can you just lay off and let me--” he scratched at his face, “Let me be fine”.
The hallway had numbered wooden doors uniformly sitting on either side. A few of the university's students littered the corridor, all of whom were evidently anxious to try their fastest to leave for any Halloween plans they had made. A short girl who was dressed as Mario tied her shoelace out the front of the door marked with a brass the number eight, her two friends huddled a foot away from her as they waited patiently. The man dressed as Luigi appeared to be the first to notice Deanna as she approached.
“Right. So there's Metatron, which honestly surprised me, considering how he was the reason so many of us died, and all of us fell.” Cas considered his words, “Well, I am too, so I suppose that’s a little hypocritical of me. His followers have always been fanatics, I assume they believe he’ll keep heaven relatively conservative.” Cas shook his head, clearly weary. “There's also Gabriel,” Cas evidently noticed Dean’s confusion at this. “He is an archangel so it’s an understandable choice.”
“I don't know, man.” Dean sighed, he turned his eyes to the ceiling and pushed his head to the cold tiled wall, “Only if you actually want to”.
“No way, man! I have my reputation to protect” The two brothers grinned at each other as the door swung open.
Dean shook his head and reread his response. He folded the paper until it resembled a messy square and whistled two tones; one high then low, as he flicked the paper in his hand toward Azrael. The angel jumped and straightened up. Their hair was now sticking up in at least nine different plumes from their head, tied with mismatched hair ties, and their cheeks had layers of glittery animals and flowers stuck to them. Dean lay his back down into the grass as Azreal made the journey from the room and to earth once again.
"Happy Easter," Bobby returned in a far less enthusiastic tone. "You drunk already?" he asked, placing his hands on Dean's green canvas clad arms and taking a step back to study his face.
“Uh, Yeah,” he admitted, walking towards the wall to retrieve the darts and write down his score. “Why? Have you?” Dean passed the three darts to Sam.
“I can’t,” he stated more forcefully this time. “You’ll need to find somebody else. I-- I can’t”. He sniffed. Jack exhaled sharply as if he'd just been the victim of a physical blow.
“Amelia Earhart didn’t run out of fuel. She was raptured after her plane was shot down by the Japanese Army, to spare her an unjustly painful death.” Dean turned to stare at the vesseled Castiel for a good five seconds and as if by magnetic force the free-range Castiel moved from his spot on the floor, content to simply watch Dean’s face journey as he processed this new information.
“Yeah, Cas, see? You’re upsetting the kid.” Dean said, twisting his back to direct his words to the transformer behind him.
He pulled into the parking lot beside a bar that seemed to be simply named “Bar”, according to any and all signage that was welded to the top of the corrugated building. He walked inside and pulled himself onto a barstool. The place was empty, apart from a group of old men in suits with cardigans, chewing on tobacco and smoking cigars. Dean ordered himself a double from the young blonde in a pillbox hat who stood behind the bar. She smiled at him through her bright red lips before giving him a once-over. At his lack of enthusiasm in return, she rolled her eyes and left the whole bottle of bourbon pushing it toward him. Dean scoffed at her and shook his head before refilling his glass, slapping a Ben Franklin on the sticky bar mat. The lady walked over toward the till and brought back ninety-six dollars on a small silver tray. Dean pocketed the change then, dragging the bottle off the bar with his free hand, he headed to the jukebox in the corner.
“And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon, Little boy blue and the man on the moon, When you comin' home, Dad, I don't know when, but we'll get together then, You know we'll have a good time then.”
“I need a drink” she murmured and as if in a trance she headed for the doorway. She turned back toward the room as her hand reached the doorknob. “You guys coming?” Sam asked. Deanna looked to Jesse whose face seemed to echo the concern that she herself felt.
She pulled her phone from her pocket and selected Samantha’s address from the list of most recently searched in her GPS app. She followed the directions needlessly back from where she came, walking slowly and calmly in an attempt not to attract any unwanted attention.
“Great.” He took a swig at the now slightly cooler coffee. Dean’s phone buzzed from inside the soft gray fabric of his robe pocket. He fished it out and clicked on the screen where it read: "(4) new messages from Charlie Weasley". Dean still hadn't gotten around to reading Harry Potter or even seeing the movies but he’d googled the plot after Charlie had changed her ID in his phone, which he figured was practically the same thing.
"Oh. Yeah, very funny" He said with sarcasm while shaking his head at the now building laughter from the back of the car.
“I’m Jack, and I say that we all are going to see a movie at the theater, and mom buys me popcorn, and Dean laughs really loudly at the jokes, okay? Go!”
”. He swallowed and shook his head again, looking Dean over once more with a passionate loathing and deep betrayal. Then Adam faded from the basement, leaving behind nothing but the all too familiar sound of thrashing wings.
“I can see why you can’t just return to life as you had it on earth then, I suppose.” He sniffed and suddenly had a strange gleam in his eyes as if he had just made a scientific breakthrough, “Odd concept, that heaven may be too perfect for you”. Dean huffed out another awkward humorless laugh.
sister, now, however, she appeared to tower over her even in the flat doc martens she had on her feet. The bewilderment in Sam's face caused Deanna's stomach to flip. She licked her lips and feigned bravado.
She shook herself and jumped up and down on the spot, swinging her arms back and forth, and reminding herself of girls from elementary school who would limber up beside her while at the starting line in track. She inhaled sharply. She knew that realistically she really had no other option; Samantha had the right to know what she knew... no matter what she then chose to do with that information, and besides, the best way to ensure her little sister's safety was to keep an eye on her.
“Congratulations! Sticking to it this time?” She asked with a hug. Dean must not have responded to her dig with her desired amount of amusement. “Oh, come on, old man, heaven’s not so bad. None of that here”, she said gesturing at his remorseful face. Dean’s stomach dropped as he looked her over, he still couldn’t help but feel responsible for her death. A weight on his conscience that he thought he had dropped long ago.
Castiel found that he began to bleed apart; he had wandered his regrets over and over in the timeless void of the empty and eventually, whilst inside a dream that he could now no longer recall, that squeezing inside of his chest had intensified until it finally became almost unbearable. Then, he felt himself split in two, away from his memory’s body. He turned to look back upon himself, his true form a dazzling light exploding out of what was once merely another vessel. It was strange, seeing his body move and breathe and live without him inside of it, after years of living within it on earth. He looked down at the hands of his true form and turned them over, simply marveling at them without judgment for the first time in over a decade.
"You're being impatient," Castiel noted as he searched through the channels on the radio trying to find something he thought might interest Jack.
important I just mean--” Cas’s eyes narrowed as he smiled at Dean who was now unable to stop ranting. “With everyone always like… looking at me... you know, with Sam and Bobby and Mom and then all the angels and even Crowley and shit. I felt like it was-- was like, always,” he made pushing gestures away from his body with his hands. “And then I would always feel so damn guilty and like, sick-- physically sick, just thinking about how you-- you didn’t know any better, so you didn’t really, like, mean to be
"Thanks, man. Nice skin suit, by the way. He strong enough to hold you're giant ego?" Dean looked to Castiel beside him in hopes of some kind of positive reaction to his joke but instead found only an eye roll. Dean sighed. "Kidding, man, geez."
Castiel took his regular place on his side of the bed. He watched as Dean gingerly removed Jack's drawing from the back pocket of his jeans. He lay it against the bed smoothing out the creases and placed it upon his shelf by the picture of himself at three years old held by his mom. Then Dean, full of feigned bravado, pulled off his shoes, socks, jeans, and red button-down shirt, and climbed in under the covers, only wearing his black t-shirt and underpants.
“I was just checking!” Castiel laughed. “I didn’t mean to upset you.” Cas rubbed a number of circles on his back again, “Believe it or not I do also get insecure from time to time.” Cas admitted, causing Dean’s anger and sadness to begrudgingly dissipate, “Granted, I wouldn’t exactly want to have to go searching for a new vessel…” Cas sighed, “Though it isn’t “disgusting” as you put it, I am not my body, just as you are not yours; we merely inhabit our bodies.” Dean scoffed, “
“Yeah, I guess it pays to hang out with heavens “bitch boys”” Dean shook his head, “You know you can just pray to any of them, right? You could've just asked if someone could bring Sammy a letter of your own. Angels may be dicks but it's kind of their job to look after humanity… Just sayin’”
“Uh, yeah. Don’t mention it.” The man said, turning and looking back at her as he shut the door behind him, a sly grin upon his face.
“What is--” Cas began then looking at Dean, the shock Cas wore seemed to fade into one of tenderness. Dean chuckled breathlessly and whispered hoarsely.
Cas, looked away, his own smile faded. Something pulled at the inside of Dean's stomach. There was a painful quiet for a moment as Dean sat, watching Cas’s composed features.
"Oh yeah, you're the poster boy for mental health" Sam shook his head. The anger started to rise inside Dean again. He knew that Sam was only trying to help but it did nothing to help quiet the pit of his stomach screaming for attention. He knew he had left it too long to reply with a clever comeback so the silence grew between them. He pushed himself up from the bonnet.
"So, let me see if I got this right." Dean began. "Crowley is now Death... and Lucifer is who's taking care of all angels and demons when they get ganked? Lucifer as in
“Alright... okay.” Deanna pouted when Sam's laughter continued, “Yeah, you’re hilarious, laugh it up”. Deanna smirked, shaking her hair around on her shoulders. Sam’s eyes crinkled in the corners as she caught her breath, sighing dramatically. She pushed on a glass door beside her and into the hallway of what looked like an apartment complex.
"Yeah? Well, I want to," Dean affirmed, playfully patting the top of the dark-haired man in front of him. Cas smiled.
“What’s my prize?” She asked, blinking at the bright light and wiping a hand over the drool in the corner of her mouth. Sam cocked her head to the side and huffed out a laugh.
Castiel found himself sitting on the ground, his back against some cool metal, his breathing was shaky, he watched silently as Dean rushed around, moving various torture instruments and devices around the room in a panic.
“Great actually. We all love what you’ve done with the place,” she said mirroring Dean's exact remark from earlier, as she pulled away from the hug, and placed a hand gently on his shoulder. “This is the boy's dad, John. John, this is Castiel.” She said, seemingly excited, gesturing between the two. John extended his hand.
?” Deanna laughed wildly. “Weren’t you literally only just having a go at me for just reading Dad’s journal?!” Sam smiled.
“You’re supposed to lie.” Cas croaked, as he pulled the blanket around him, causing a smile from Balthazar.
“Just-- Indulge me please, Sammy. Just this one time. I mean how often do we get to go drinking somewhere where we’re not actually working a case, huh? Never. That's when. So I say we use this opportunity to get absolutely hammered and then tomorrow we can finally see what it feels like to be just plain ol’ hungover. No having to talk to witnesses, imitating government officials, digging up graves, any of that. Just-”, he presented his hands as if displaying an exciting notion, “Hangovers”. Sam scoffed and shook his head.
"Pork, really? That's your choice for Easter dinner?" Sam's condescending tone broke through Dean's lull. Sam's lips were somewhere between a smile and a disapproving purse.
Dean wondered for not the first time what Cash had gone through to write a song like this as he downed another glass. He read through the other records in the jukebox as he flipped through them, his mouth parted as he threw up the coins in his hand, bouncing them against each other over and over as he tried to decide which other songs to spend his money on. He clicked the big white plastic button when he came to a rest on Elvis Presley's “First in Line”.
“I--” Cas coughed hard, a completely non-angelic thing to do. His throat screamed at him, begging to be cleared as he attempted to hack it free. After a moment the choking subsided and he was able to breathe again. His brothers stared at him as he pulled his hand away, now covered in splatters of his grace. "I think, perhaps, I need to see Jack,” Castiel stated, as he slowly attempted to pull himself up off the bed, his body barely moving in response. He felt heavy and he suddenly gained tunnel vision for his efforts.
“Cas- uh,” he looked around, somewhat crestfallen at the lack of immediate arrival on Cas’s part. He wasn't sure how to continue, his eyes flicked around him and he set his tongue between his back teeth, shaking his head in irritation.
“You can come in”. He replied. Balthazar entered the room and stared at Cas, shaking his head. He was now wearing a smart, fitted suit, looking at ease in his vessel again.
“Perhaps he should get a middle place. Jack could create a pocket afterlife where John Winchester would be forced to live all alone with only vegan food, light beer, and the musical stylings of George Michael, to keep him company.” Cas smirked, satiated somewhat by his imagination. Dean frowned.
“As a heart attack. Why, do you have somewhere you need to be in the morning?” Dean grinned at his brother before motioning his head toward Sam's shot, gesturing for him to pick it up. Sam sighed.
. That’s something that would never change between them. In the past, when they were merely platonic brothers in arms, it seemed miraculous to Dean that the more he had revealed, the more Cas seemed to accept it all, completely, without an ounce of judgment. They’d both been through horrific shit that they’d regretted and over time Dean had found himself sparing fewer and fewer fucked up details. Cas had seen him as a friggin demon attempting to kill his own damn brother and he still seemed to accept him as a whole. “It was the usual-- Well, the newest usual, it’s obviously been a while since I had any nightmare at all but…”
Hours passed, while Dean focused on nothing but his task at hand, his dream long forgotten. He surveyed the weapons on the counter in front of him. A shotgun, that was all that he had left to clean. He dismembered the gun wiping it down with a rag before reassembling it. He noticed that it was relatively clean already. The chambers even seemed to have no real build-up in them. He finished putting the shotgun back together and placed it down, before absentmindedly checking his watch. It had only taken him two hours to clean every single item from the car, he noted. He got up to get himself a beer and froze, dead in his tracks. Ice ran down his spine as he slowly lifted his watch again. 11:59 am exactly. Dean's stomach jolted. His mouth was suddenly dry. He tried to swallow down the panic rising inside him but he knew, he knew that that was it; that was the sign. How, without even thinking, could he have looked at the time for the first time all day and it be exactly 11:59 am? The dread was too much for him, he had to steady himself. He planted his hand on the table to stop himself from falling over.
Dean thought, suddenly unsure if he was able to go through with his swan song. He didn’t know if he could say goodbye, not again, but he also knew that if he didn’t, Sam would never get the closure he needed to move on.
When Dean’s back first met the wooden supporting post in the barn he figured he’d gone and gotten himself a brand new internal bruise. He found the pain a new flavor of strange. A deep, thick pain that he couldn’t recall ever having felt before, but he brushed it off as he remembered that there was still one last vampire left to kill…
“Okay... well then, on the count of three”. Charlie picked up a shot in one hand and lifted a finger on the other. Dean and Cas raised their respective drinks as Charlie lifted a second finger, and as her third finger flicked up, the three of them downed their beverages. Dean spluttered as he placed his first glass upside down and picked up the second one, before throwing it back and doing the same with the third. He exhaled sharply and closed one eye tight as he tried to keep the burning liquid down his throat. He looked up at Charlie and Cas across from him and laughed. All of Cas’s drinks had been drained, however, Charlie had only managed to drink one of her shots. Castiel sighed. “I’ll sip on it,” she explained, defensively. Dean snorted and Charlie shot her hand up, blocking Dean's face as she addressed Castiel, “So, What have you been up to?” She asked. Cas smiled.
Sam sat staring out the window blankly as tears periodically streamed silently down her face. After a time, Deanna pulled the Impala into a gas station and drive-through fast-food chain. Post filling the car up and paying, they bought breakfast from the reliable chain store and ate together in the car quietly. Deanna turned on the radio before unwrapping her breakfast burrito, one-handed and Sam pulled herself down in her chair, resting her head against the black leather seat, sniffing between bites of her bland wilted salad. Sam pulled herself up once she finished eating and stared at her sister.
“I bet at this point it's just how things work around here. Something changes and “Hey, it must have been Castiel.” Typical".
He pictured that same kid, playing catch with Sam, the two of them with matching haircuts, whoever his wife was, (he didn't want to assume Eileen but he couldn't really picture anyone else) watching on from the front porch. He imagined Sam's house filled with pictures of their family, as he taught little Dean how to do some crazy hard math equations.
“It’s a welcome home present…” He repeated as if exasperated by their lack of understanding, “Can we go home now?” Dean grinned down at the small god upon his lap, his throat blocked with a sudden lump of emotion. He tried to clear it in vain.
“You know, when I reconnected with Castiel, he was bedridden and completely distraught; absolutely inconsolable, because not only had you just revealed to him that you had
Cas wanted things to go back to the way they were? Dean considered, for a moment, the implications of that statement. Did that mean that, in some reality, things would have changed between them? That implied that at that moment before the Empty had taken Cas, he had meant "I love you" as in… "I
“Would you slow down a little, Sam?” she called out into the street while Sam waited at a pedestrian crossing, half a block away. A couple dressed as linen ghosts, walking in the opposite direction swiveled their heads around as they passed, in an attempt to see who Deanna was yelling at. “Yeah, yeah, keep it moving.” She rattled off at them and started to jog to reach the lights in time. She came to a stop at the other side of the road, grabbing her sister's shoulder. “You know if you’re trying to ditch me, you could just tell me to fuck off!” Sam turned and blinked down at her, her eyes full of tears. “Oh,” Deanna muttered. Sam sniffed.
"So..." Dean squinted and straightened his legs out between them, his feet under the bed, lining up with Cas' thighs, "how long were you lying there pretending to be asleep?" He asked, tilting his head. Cas' eyes finally reached Dean's.
“I was thinking, a fancy restaurant, maybe a movie… should have known.” He turned back behind him as he walked toward Jack’s bed and flashed Cas a meaningful grin; one that he hoped conveyed his thoughts as followed:
“Yeah, right. No, I remember.” he turned back to the board and then gently placed the knife down and shook his head, his heart pounding hard in his chest. “I was thinking I could stay here, maybe look after Jack if nobody else is gonna be here.” Castiel approached Dean, stood beside him at the kitchen island, and peered up at him in an attempt to get him to meet his blue eyes.
“I’m-- I’m not, man. Just drop it.” He chuckled in frustration, lifting his coffee and taking another try at sipping down the boiling hot liquid.
Dean staggered into the bunker feeling uncertain and anxious about what he may be walking into. He followed Cas’ frustratingly light footfalls down the stairs and into the war room. The clang of his rubber-soled boots on the metal steps echoed throughout the room. He came to a stop at the bottom of the stairs.
“Dean, I-- Angel’s are kind of rare around here. I don’t know if you noticed but the entire restaurant just crapped itself at the sight of one of them.” Mary’s brows were low “Maybe you can’t really see how strange it is, you had, like, ten whole angels come out to your surprise party”.
Dean awoke, sitting bolt upright in the passenger seat of the Impala, panting with his body drenched in sweat. Joni Mitchell’s voice breathed in contrast through the speakers.
“There’s Michael, obviously.” Dean opened his mouth to speak, Cas closed his, patiently, a smile formed on his mouth, signaling for Dean to continue.
"Granted he doesn't do anything ridiculously stupid, which seems to be asking a lot with you two, there's no reason why he shouldn't go on to live a long, and reasonably average, life". Before he had time to think, Dean wrapped Adam in his arms tightly, slapping him on the back, and let out a relieved chuckle. "Yeah, alright... That's enough".
Dean made his way over to a bar stool, he was only a few feet away from where the angels all huddled. Cas’s muffled voice soaked into the air around him, feeling simultaneously relaxing and irritating. Dean sat, looking out at the crowd of friends and family that had gathered for him, his heart warmed as he took in their faces. Jo stood over by the pool table, cue in hand, as she waited for Pamala to break, pointing out the angle she thought the older of the two women should take. His mom and dad stood talking to pastor Jim and Mick. Bobby and Karen spoke to Ellen and Bill. Charlie, Channing, and Keven sat together laughing at something evidently hilarious.
“Well, Ryan” Deanna began before Sam could answer, “I’ll start with your number, and then maybe we can see about you getting me a tall glass of Sex on the Beach?” Sam rolled her eyes. Ryan’s eyes widened and he glanced around as he chuckled in disbelief.
? We’re coworkers, huh?” He chuckled humorlessly, “Because I seem to remember a time, not too long ago, where we were
“I told you!” She grinned then lowered her voice, “Dean, if you say he told you he's moved on then I believe you but what I don’t believe is that he ever stopped looking at you.” She took another large chomp and smiled at the burger in her hands.
here.” he laughed, astonished, as he watched the world zip by out of the window. Cas sat in silence staring out at the road ahead of them. The car had made its way into a farming area. Barns littered the horizon, lighting up distant paddocks full of grain.
. Did Cas make it out?” Dean bellowed, only barely resisting the urge to punch Crowley in the jaw, Death or not.
Castiel was sitting upright in bed, pulling down what remained of his white tatted shirt as Dean entered. The two men stared at each other, stopping dead in their tracks. Dean's eyes frantically searched the angel's face while he stood there in the doorway, completely taken off guard. Cas stared at him silently, his blue eyes not revealing a single thought, exposing nothing to Dean as to where he should begin.
Dean was able to sneak off to his room rather easily, he discovered. He gently closed the door behind him, trying not to make any sound. Dean reached into his pocket and retrieved a ziplock bag that Bobby had subtly placed into it when they embraced. The bag was full of blood-soaked dirt from the ground where a murder had taken place. The biggest affront to God; man killing one another. He examined the dirt closely for blood and didn't hear the door open behind him.
He remembered Cas, human, stubbled, his bare chest carved open, how small and powerless he looked crumpled lifelessly on the couch.
The acceptance from his brother started to make Dean feel lighter, and with the lighter feeling, Dean noticed, it made it harder to tell just what, exactly, he was saying. Each sentence he spoke felt like it was from a snapshot of time that had passed long ago. He would occasionally find himself surprised that he was still impaled there, at that moment, talking, like it was a dream he had just woken from and now was sliding gently back into sleep. He had started to fade away quicker now. Sam had started looking at Dean differently; he looked really scared, and his fear was starting to scare Dean now too.
Dean’s chest rose and fell rapidly. He felt like he had been cheated. He hadn’t even known that Angels were
Saving lives was what Dean was good at. Isn’t that along the lines of what Cas had tried to tell Dean before the angel had died? That it was in the saving of the lives not the killing of the monsters that had set Dean apart? That he wasn't the hate-filled, revenge-driven man that his father was; that Dean too, believed he had inherited? That he, in fact, was so full of love, that he fought purely because wouldn't ever be able to rest, simply knowing that there were people out there who needed his help?
"Huh." she shrugged. "I feel fabulous" She beamed a fake smile at him. Dean looked everywhere but her face.
“Dean.” Cas’s voice was barely above a whisper from behind him. The hurt in his voice jolted through Dean like a live wire. Dean set his jaw and closed his eyes at the sound. He inhaled slowly and nodded to himself.
“Uhh, so, after you died--” Dean stopped, closing his eyes at the image of her in the bathtub. His heart sank.
Dean was in the kitchen, wearing a grey oversized hooded sweater underneath his apron, rewarding himself with what was roughly a shot of Johnny Walker Blue, straight from the bottle, each time he finished chopping up a random vegetable to throw into the pot of (what he hoped would eventually turn out to be a) semi-healthy pasta sauce.
"I gotta hand it to you man, you really went all out, everything but the actual white picket fence" he placed his empty beer bottle inside the open window of the car, avoiding eye contact. He could feel the anger rise on his face at his brother for starting up about the bunker already. Sam swiftly opened another bottle from the six-pack next to him and handed it to his older brother. "Thanks". He popped the end of the bottle straight into his mouth and took a large gulp.
Dean was filled with a morbid relief that his brother had assumed he was making visits to the basement on behalf of his grief over losing Cas. He felt a guilty comfort knowing that his mourning masked the true reason for his recent stopover at the dank location he had found himself drawn to each night. The basement was the one area of the bunker he refused to allow himself to visit, up until just moments ago. He swallowed hard, trying in vain to bring some relief to the dryness in this throat. Dean shook his head and pushed his chair back, scraping it against the floor.
“Okay, Reading Rainbow. Let’s get this over with.” He snatched up the beer from the table and downed the remainder of the liquid. Cas smiled.
"Why? What's making you so curious?" Michael asked, his eyes narrowing. Dean looked at Cas, a knowing smile exchanged between them as Castiel scrunched the wrapper of his burger in his hands.
“You don’t think I’m "a dick", that I’m "a coward", that I,” Cas air quoted, ““didn’t let you get a word in edgewise”... and you don’t "hate me?"” Cas asked in a clipped voice. Dean nodded and licked his bottom lip.
The song ended and Dean’s second pick began. Dean shoved the rest of his coins back into his pocket.
“Come on, Deano! Times a-wastin', the train’s a-comin'!” Dean flinched as John’s voice yelled at him. “Choose now or I’ll do it for you, boy!” Dean’s eyes remained glued to Emma’s. The daughter he never got to know. The baby who grew up far too quickly and the relationship that was doomed before it came into being. Alistair forced something into Dean’s hand, he ripped his eyes away from his daughters and stared in horror as his hand wrapped itself around the hilt of the familiar weapon and rose on its own accord. Dean tried to gain control of his movement, his arm shook under the strain of attempting to hold himself back but the first blade continued forward until it finally hit home. He plunged the bone straight through the center of Emma’s chest. She choked on a scream as blood gushed from her mouth. John’s hand slapped hard against Dean’s back. “That’s my boy.” Dean turned to his father in horror but somehow standing in John’s place now stood Chuck, grinning up at him far, far too widely. “I always knew you’d make the right choice”. Dean turned back to Emma in complete terror, pulling the blade out as if he could undo his mistake. He gazed up at her face but instead of finding Emma’s brown eyes, he met the burnt, empty sockets where Jack’s eyes had once been, staring blankly back at him.
talking about bringing Jack along, Dean, you were in the room at the time.” Dean swallowed, he nodded and stared at the zucchini. “I’d love for you to come.” Castiel’s voice was soft, he placed his hand upon Dean’s. Dean sniffed, his stomach tightened.
Dean knew this was Chuck’s doing, a nice little breadcrumb path that was supposed to lead to Sam being slaughtered in a barn somewhere. Too bad Jack had caught on and Dean had thrown a spanner at that plan. Dean sipped at his coffee tentatively, while he considered his options for the rest of the day.
“Meaning, I think this place could do with a few indoor plants... And you. All I've ever really wanted, both before heaven and now with you unfortunately here with me... I've realized all I've ever wanted to do I want to do with you by my side". Dean's breath caught.
Dean was drunk. He felt the familiar lack of weight on his chest as he took the roast pork out of the oven. The smell of warm aromatic cooking combined harmoniously with the hum of excited chatter and clinking of cutlery as loaded dishes were placed throughout the kitchen.
Her mind raced ahead, showing to her all sorts of self-indulgent scenarios in which all sorts of horrible, yet seemingly possible things occurred; Her younger sister screaming at her, throwing all sorts of objects, calling her a coward, a fake, a weak and despicable waste of human resources.
“Can it be my turn for attention?” Dean paused and swung around to where Charlie sat alone in a booth by the window, her phone sat in front of her on the table.
“Did we just become best friends?” Penny chuckled, causing Dean to turn sharply. He considered it for a moment.
“I see you still haven't started your painting, Dean''. The angel remarked shaking his head, his long curly grey locks swishing around his shoulders.
Dean fumbled for his phone on the coffee table in front of him and looked at the time. It was 4:30 am. He cleared a space on the floor and placed the expensive-looking black and white striped cushion that he had used as a pillow, under his knees. "Alright," he whispered, his throat itchy from roaring with laughter and yelling excitedly only hours earlier. He put his elbows against the coffee table and cleared his throat as he placed his hands together. It felt strange, it would always feel strange. He closed his eyes and began his nightly ritual "Jack, uhh... God." he croaked. "Dean here. Again." He noted that with his eyes closed the room felt as if it were spinning. He hadn't had so much to drink in a long time. "I don't know if you're waiting for a specific number of prayers from me, buddy, but honestly, it's getting old". He sighed deeply. "Any day you wanna make an appearance works for me." Dean shifted his weight from his knees to his feet as the former started to burn. "Anyway… I'm at Sam's new shack... just in case you choose tonight to roll in. I'll be back home tomorrow, though." He peaked his eyes open and gave the room a once over before correcting himself. "I'll be back home in a few hours. Just…" that damned feeling in his stomach was back. "Just… really... kid, any sign that you're even getting this would be a win for me at this point" he sighed and rubbed his hands on his temples "I miss you… Amen." and with that he gathered up the cushion on the floor and returned back to the couch where he lay, trying to get comfortable, continuously checking his pocket to ensure it still contained a small folded piece of paper each time he rolled over. He ended up spending the next few hours trying not to think and desperately hoping sleep would come.
"I guess it was always gonna start back up at some point" Dean began, shaking his head. "Some leftover vamp or werewolf from the uhhh... " he narrowed his eyes in thought "Thanos... Snap... falls off the ledge and turns someone… who kills someone else…" The car fell silent for a moment. The air was suddenly morose.
“There were speeches, tears, the whole deal. Now, we're done here, okay? I apologized. I meant it. I told you
"Always rushing now'days" Dean responded shaking his head. "You know it's not going anywhere right?" As he said the words he wondered if that truly was his brother's problem. Maybe, after all they'd been through Sam felt as if there was only a short amount of time before the other shoe dropped? What had it been, weeks? Maybe a few months since everything went down? "It's not like Jack- or God... or whatever" he waved his hand gesturing to the world around them "Is gonna come back down and take it all away" Sam smiled without it reaching his eyes. "Hell, if you can find a single big bad for me to slice and dice, I'd throw you a damn parade" Dean downed the beer instinctually and refused to meet his brother's eyes.
?” Alistair rubbed John's hands together eagerly, “The poetic justice of it all!” He grinned, again, far too widely. Dean swallowed hard as Emma’s eyes widened up at him in horror.
"You ready for happily ever after?" He asked, pointing at his brother, before turning to Castiel and lazily bumping his shoulder against the former angel’s. Cas chuckled as his hand reached Dean’s and the two strode from the bathroom. Dean waited, holding Cas’ hand in one hand and the other held the bathroom door open for his younger brother. Sam's smile grew as he watched the two of them. He
"Bobby! Heyyy!" Dean bellowed as he strode through the kitchen to greet the gruff old man in a hug. He gave him two hard taps on the back as Bobby slid his hand down by Dean's jacket pocket.
“Ah, yeah,” Dean sniffed, still grinning to himself, “Not too shabby.” He managed to take a deep breath and pull his lips into a straight line, biting down on them as he drew his brows in and glanced up at Castiel, only for a millisecond; It was too much. “You?” Dean asked before springing up from the bed, swinging his legs over the side, and sitting facing the wall. He wondered if the pounding of his heart was audible as he rubbed the sleep from his eyes. Castiel sighed melodramatically from where he remained seated in the bed with two pillows pulled up behind his back to prop him up. Dean twisted himself around, worry and confusion plastered on his face. “What?” he asked, a touch of venom to his tone. Rather than reply Cas simply smiled, his brows raised as he smirked knowingly at the man in front of him. Dean shook his head and scoffed. “Okay...” he nodded and turned back toward the wall. Dean swallowed loudly, his throat feeling incredibly dry all of a sudden, his eyes darted around as he considered fleeing. He knew there was no real escape now though, nowhere he could run that would free him of his true feelings, not now. He had let the dam wall burst inside him and there was no building it back up. He shook his head again and sighed, then without any warning he threw himself backward, his back hitting the mattress and his head on Castiel’s thighs. “Alright!” he chuckled. “Fine. I’m sorry”. Cas grinned down at him, his eyes crinkling in the corners.
Castiel pushed Dean toward the tiled wall of the hallway so Dean could steady himself then placed his hands on Dean's shoulders and searched his face, bobbing up and down and side to side, attempting to view him from different angles.
"We good?" She asked, raising her brows as if she hadn't heard the couple's entire conversation. Sam nodded but didn't reply and the three continued down the stairs and out into the cold night without speaking. Once outside Jesse was the first who spoke, this time addressing Deanna as she pulled John’s oversized jacket back on.
“I’ve always wanted to go to one of those places that let you paint your own crockery.” Dean shook his head and opened Jack's bedroom door.
“You’re obviously not fine, though.” Sam's voice rose, as he gestured to the vague area between them, where the pills sat, still keeping his eyes on the road in front of him.
"I, uhh, I think that one's mainly on you, actually." He stated, hitting Jack in the shoulder and remembering that Kevin was otherwise doomed to wander the earth as a ghost forever. "That was one of the things on the list we gave you when you... uhh"
“Stuff it down with brown,” he said to himself as he turned the keys in the ignition and set off down the road.
“I’m betting Jack would have let you in on this whole save Sammy deal. So, I’m finding it hard to believe you didn’t know I was coming.” He slowly looked around again.
"No! I'm just saying it seems like you guys have a lot to catch up on. You can both come, have drinks with Brandy and the rest of the guys when you're ready?" He put his hand on Sam's shoulder stopping her and ducked his head, forcing her to meet his eyes. Deanna licked her lips and got out her phone, her background a photo of an old photograph of sam, her mom, and her huddled together when she was four years old. Deanna heard Sam sigh while she unlocked her phone and stared at her apps trying to look busy. Sam looked at her older sister and shook her head before turning back to her boyfriend.
soft, and Cas? Cas is my family, always will be. So if you have a problem with that, you have a problem with me.” he scoffed, “--and come on, dad, let's not act like you actually managed to beat
says because you know you it's not possible to read in dreams.” Cas lifted the tape, turning it towards him, a smile breaking out across his face.
"You don’ have to apologize to me, Dean. The internal affairs of the Bri'ish Men o’ Le'ers were never your responsibili'y. I'm just sorry it took me so long to see that their way of doing things was wrong.” Dean scoffed.
“Cas, not now!” Dean warned, then his face softened. A silver car backed out in front of him and he flicked the indicator up. “Yes!” He pulled the Impala into the parking space and turned the key, exhaling hugely, he twisted toward Cas, watching the angel as he unbuckled his seatbelt. “I stand by this morning's decision.” He licked at his lips and pumped his brows at Cas who turned to him with a grin. Castiel was dressed in his normal get-up minus the coat and jacket, his sleeves were rolled up to his elbows, his tie was missing, and a few of his top buttons were undone. It wasn’t like Dean hadn’t seen him completely naked... but for some sick reason the relaxed, slight show of skin had been driving him mad all morning and he knew that if they didn’t clear the pipes, so to speak, he’d be a distracted mess all day. Now that roughly an hour had passed from their trip up to “the big city”, as it was so aptly named, Dean was already starting to look at Castiel with a considerable amount of hunger again. Cas shook his head.
