And that had been all. He'd refrained – barely – from pestering John, and had received terse details about the service via text. There had been no viewing of the body, merely promession followed by the funeral mass and committal.
, Mr Not My Area."
"Hello?" Henry frowned as a high-pitched, excited voice filtered through the speaker. "Who's that?" A deeper frown creased his brow. "Wh --
Another message came through, this one a photo. Uneasily, John opened it. It was two pictures, pasted together. He enlarged it.
"That's fine. Thank you."
"Relax, you'll get yours,
"Jesus." John pressed the heels of his hands to his eyes.
Heart hammering in his chest, John stood still, letting Mary and Nora's voices wash over him, trying to establish himself in reality again.
Sherlock stepped out from behind the tree before he overheard anything uncomfortably intimate. "John."
Sherlock's safety against England's. Not an easy decision.
"We've got another hour to go," Sherlock said.
Sherlock opened his arms. "We've got a bit of time yet. Let's make the most of it."
“Oh, he’s…he’s fine. I see him at Bart’s a lot.”
"Don't be angry at me."
"I see." The PA gave him another sharp look. "How's filming? Tom said you were in the midst of shooting series two."
---Shit. Shit! Hold him. Where's Malone? Get the nitrous!
A flush crept into John's face. Mary didn't know about the racing. "Yeah. Text me." He and Mary got up to see Sherlock off. "Do you want a lift home?"
When he came back into Lady Howe's bathroom, Mycroft was on his mobile. His head was bent, and he massaged the bridge of his nose with his fingertips. "Very well. Thank you." He rang off and looked bleakly at Sherlock.
John bagged the bindle and labelled the envelope in his tidy block handwriting. "Well. Give them my best. Oh, hey. Erm…Nora was…that is, I was wondering if you'd like to come to dinner. At the house. Nora's anxious to see you again."
He stumbled out of the lab, found the lift, and exited the hospital in the violet-grey light of dawn. Astoundingly, a taxi was idling at the kerb, and he got in, giving Tom's address. He had to find a few more letters; even one would help, if its contents were something other than pure torture pornography.
Sherlock seated himself opposite Kerstin Tresler. "No-one broke into your flat weeks ago, did they? You and Mr Reilly had some sort of arrangement with Lord Moran." He looked into Tresler's opaque eyes and saw her lack of fear, her stony indifference. "But something went wrong, because Mr Reilly's dead now, and you're cleaning your flat. Expecting visitors, are you?"
- in the attic, as a bit of a joke – and every once in a while, they niggled. Also, he happened to know that John kept a physical data file on his laptop, and it would be nice if he finally bloody erased it.
That was more than John had ever had in his life, and it was enough. It would be enough.
A faint scraping noise sounded to Sherlock's left, and he jumped. Moriarty giggled. Sherlock gritted his teeth and forced himself to hold perfectly still.
John laughed a little. "I know. Stands to reason, I suppose. I can't really wrap my head round this, er, Benedict."
"Right. Off to shower."
Benedict blinked. "Sorry?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"You're just accelerating it when you struggle, buddy, but that suits me. Going to have to attach you to something so you don't get too wriggly." He got up and went back to the shadowy piles of furniture against the wall.
Henry slammed a hand over Tom's mouth, then snatched it back with a cry. "You
"There it is," Sherlock said, and reluctantly disentangled his fingers from John's to point ahead. "That clearing – see it?"
"I shouldn't think so," Tom replied, lifting a brow. "What about…." He laughed and raised his glass. "Truth is stranger than fiction."
Mark sagged in relief. "Oh, thank you. Honestly, it's beyond generous –" He made a startled muffled noise as Sherlock dove in and kissed him full on the mouth. He struggled away, backing against one of the toilet stalls, and gaped. "Ben!"
Mycroft frowned. "A racecourse."
scenario?
Click.
"Yes. You did."
"Are you all right?"
"I –"
"He's fine. He's looking forward to seeing you again."
"What did they look like?" Sherlock asked.
," Benedict replied, and leapt to his feet. "I've set things in motion and –" He let out a hollow laugh. "I should have shot him at the pool. Come on, get up." He hauled John to his feet and began to hustle him toward the bathroom. "It's a jump, but you can do it. I can't let them take you in."
"Oh, yes," Sherlock said with a yawn. "The Wing something."
John glanced at Nora before answering. She was rapt, staring at Sherlock with large eyes. "Erm…well, yes, you're right. It's never a good idea to ignore a threat. You've got to be careful – not everyone in this world has good intentions." He gave Sherlock a pleading look.
"Yeah?" He liked watching her pack, the same way he enjoyed watching her cook. She was fast and competent, good at almost anything she decided to do. He always liked watching competent –
Thursday was John's early afternoon, and he planned to savour it. The day was sunny and bracing; he thought he'd put on his trainers and jog in the park for a bit, then head back home for a light lunch and dinner prep – hand-made pasta and his special sauce with bits of sausage and lots of pepper and Parmesan cheese, which Nora adored but Mary didn't care for, so it was just as well that Mary was in Paris. Then he'd collect Nora from school, they'd have a nice supper, and in the evening he'd break out the chess set he'd got her for Christmas and teach her the fundamentals. It was about time she learned a bit of critical thinking. Then he'd work on the RAMC Journal article a bit more before bed.
Moran's head jerked up and he gaped at Sherlock. "Relation? Oh, dear God. You think Seb is Nick Dedalus?" Moran smiled, then began to laugh. "Oh, God."
"A car will pick you up in fifteen minutes," Mycroft said crisply. "Pack a week's worth of clothing  and wait for three bursts of the horn to indicate that it's safe."
An asset disappearing just as yet another US cabinet member stepped down. Was this one quitting or had he been sacked? It was so difficult to keep track lately. He found a number and fired off another text:
Janine came out in a beautiful lilac coat. “It’s just up the road a bit. Come on, it’s an easy walk.”
Mary waited for the door to close and pulled Trish's collar down once more. Her throat closed. She sucked in a harsh breath through her nose and fumbled a tissue from her coat pocket. Tears rolled down her cheeks, and sobs racked her frame.
Last time they'd seen each other was at Mrs Holmes' funeral in early September. It had been a beautiful day, the air unusually warm, almost syrupy – John had been steaming in his suit, sitting beside Mary in the church, watching the back of Sherlock's head from ten pews away. The church hadn't been full – Mrs Holmes' contemporaries were few in number and practically doddering. There had been several academic types, former pupils and junior faculty during Mrs Holmes' time, judging from the muted pre-service conversation. Greg Lestrade had been there, and Molly of course, both of them still in a charming and yet slightly nauseating honeymoon glow despite the fact that they'd been married three years. There were no friends present, it had seemed, for Mycroft – not surprising. In the receiving line, Mycroft had spared John and Mary a razorblade of a smile and an icy nod. Cold bastard. John hadn't missed Mycroft at all in the intervening years. Still, the wintry reception had cut, just a little.
"Lift's clear, sir," Coddington replied.
John struggled with his bonds, but they were metal, felt like strong wire, and impossible to break or to reach whatever held them secure. He pushed at the tape over his mouth with his tongue, but that wouldn't budge either. Fucking hell, he was 0 for 2. He saw the little red dots travelling in short, stuttering arcs over his torso and decided to ignore them. Wasn't as if he could stop a bullet. Furiously, he yanked at the cuffs again and a sharp jab of pain shot up his arms. He was only half-listening to Moriarty's conversation with Ben as he focussed on freeing himself, but then Moriarty said something that snagged John's attention.
John pressed the heels of his hands to his eyes. He had his work, he had Rosie. His colleagues at the surgery had gently encouraged him to start dating. It had been well over a year, and the grief had softened, but he wasn’t ready.
Nora, her eyes red, stayed in her seat, shrinking. "Where?"
Sherlock stood. "That's much better, John. Thank you. Actually, wait. It's too tight."
John pressed his lips together. "Well, that and a few other things. It's difficult to explain." She eyed him reflectively, not speaking, and John, never the confessional sort, found himself saying, "I saw an old friend the other day."
Moriarty watched in evident satisfaction. "Dumb as the whole scene is, the accoutrements come in handy. Thank you, lads, that'll do. Back upstairs with you." The men departed, leaving Sherlock, Moriarty, and Moran.
"All right, just be careful. Don't talk so much." John handed over the cup and picked up his own coffee. It was still hot, but he drank off half the cup in a draught, then ate two biscuits in quick succession. "Fairly typical scare tactic, then?"
"It’s fine." Sherlock leant down to kiss John's mouth. "I don't think I'll be disappointed."
He squeezed his eyes shut. Sherlock meant well, and John appreciated the news. It was just –
"Oh, it's no trouble, dear. Poor Sherlock was so distraught when John was taken away – I'll just let you get on with it. 'Bye!" She twinkled fingers at them both and disappeared. Benedict watched her departure with increasing dread. He didn't want to be left alone with Moriarty, but he couldn't drag Mrs Hudson into this. Oh, God.
"Now I
"Yes. I expect it sounds rather difficult to believe."
“My fault,” Molly said softly, but the knot inside her tightened.  Paul, her supervisor, had called her a superhero a few weeks ago after a difficult and complicated autopsy process. Good old Molly, everyone’s chum, always reliable, guaranteed availability for problem-solving. Superhero indeed. If she was a superhero, her power was invisibility.
Mycroft went back to the sofa and set Sherlock's glass on a tray. "You spent the afternoon with John, didn't you?"
"When did Mr Reilly begin moving looted artwork?"
"Yeah, well – incest doesn't really fly during prime-time programming."
"Okay. Wait. Everyone has his price, you're not that special a snowflake. What's yours?"
Intermingled in Benedict's present tumult of sensibility was a cautious sort of jubilation. He'd been right about John's feelings for Sherlock. Not only physically – he'd felt the evidence of John's arousal against his own (and it was remarkable that Benedict hadn't felt as if he was kissing Martin. No, he was kissing
Sherlock took a step backward, steeling himself for the blow.
"Did they bury Auntie Trish or cremate her?"
"I didn't take you for someone with political convictions," Sherlock said.
Moriarty put his hands behind his head. "You know prison won't hold me."
The front door opened as soon as Sherlock set foot on the step. Mycroft, in faultless evening dress, gestured impatiently. "Hurry. We haven't much time."
"Sit." Sherlock slid off the sofa and knelt between John's legs. He undid the button of John's jeans and slid the zipper down. "Be very still." He tugged John's pants down, letting his erection spring free.
"Yeah," Mary said. "He's wrapped in a tarp out back."
"How? Planning to make me jump off a building?"
"Gone."
Mary came down the stairs, pulling a cardigan on. "God, you're drenched!"
"Henry…I don't know what you're –"
"Yeah. Yeah, I'd like that." John stuffed his hands into his pockets. "I can come back, if you want. If you're busy."
Sherlock pivoted on his heel. "Yes?"
"Can't think why. It's not as if it was his fault your father cheated incessantly on your mother, or that he died under mysterious circumstances. Everybody knew what a bastard he was – there weren't a lot of condolence cards in that cabinet of yours, likely because everyone knew your mother was well rid of him. But there was something a bit funny about the way he died –" Sherlock's last words left him in a rush of air as Moran swung the cane, searing Sherlock's upper thigh.
"Four minutes."
Perhaps –
They'd left him so long that he'd fallen asleep, and he couldn't tell how long it had been – the chemical cosh had done a job on his circadian rhythm. He woke with a start and blinked, disoriented in the darkness. His head still ached, and added to that were cramps in both calves and thighs from sitting still for so long, and burning sinuses from the waterboarding. He needed to urinate, but thought he could hold out for a few hours longer.
"Well, if she's not home, that saves us from having to make conversation."
Well, of course John made sure Cumberbatch was all right and got him to hospital. He was a doctor, and a bloody good one. Competent, intelligent – well, slightly above average, at any rate – courageous, sensitive to the vagaries of the human heart, or soul, or whatever, kept his head in the worst situations, and almost endlessly patient with Sherlock, long past the time that any ordinary person would have packed and left. Sherlock knew that well enough – he'd lost count of the uni roommates who'd buggered off in varying states of pique until the powers that were gave up and wearily assigned him to a new hall of residence with luxurious private bedrooms. But it had been nearly a year that he and John had been flatmates, and John hadn't buggered off. He'd been furious with Sherlock a few times, but he stayed. He always stayed.
Mycroft scowled ferociously, then took a bite of sausage before sending a reply.
Ben took John's hand. "That wasn't convincing enough for you?"
"Excuse you. Christ, that's crazy." John laughed. "Still, maybe I'll find that out for myself."
The clerk lifted one bushy brow.
Tears clouded Tom's eyes, but it didn't matter – it was pitch-black and he couldn't see anything. He moaned, then raised his voice to a shout, but his garbled yelling bounced off the close-set walls, terrifying in his own ears. He tried again, and heard running footsteps above him.
be, if he got the opportunity to go back and tell him all about it. But if he didn't get that opportunity….
"No, that's…that's not what I mean. I mean…how do you do it? How do you love two people at the same time?"
"I didn't say that." Though he'd thought it.
He said none of that, of course, but Benedict felt it, and wanted to turn away.
"Okay. Let me arrange it. Just give me a few minutes." Tim fumbled out his phone – a Dedalus phone, of course – and found his flight app. "Right, okay. Tonight?"
"I've read about you two in the papers." Her voice, a peculiar mélange of Irish and German accents, rasped out of her narrow chest, and her breath smelled of gin.
"Another painting has surfaced in Ireland. In Derry, to be exact, and moreover, there are whispers of more pieces – not just paintings, but sculpture,
"What?"
"Was there…did you see other family?"
"Sherlock, come on."
"Sorry." John winced. Sherlock hadn't said goodbye that night, and John and Mary had been caught up in each other, but John had wondered, nevertheless.
The clerk pointed behind John. "There's the stuff behind you on that table. I made a pot about twenty minutes ago. Biscuits too, in the dish."
"Sherlock, Sherlock, Sherlock. You poor eejit. Don't you keep up with tech news? Dedalus Communications is the biggest manufacturer of sim cards in the world now. Dedalus snapped up optic nerve technology after GCHQ abandoned it. Dedalus willingly opened its servers to the NSA and was remunerated handsomely, and not with cash. Dedalus is the largest aggregator of dark fibre in Europe, North and South America, and Australia. Dedalus is seething with metadata. Good God almighty, how do you think I got control of every bloody television in the UK? And that was ten years ago. Ten years, Sherlock. You have no idea what I can do. I could black out the world, if I had a mind to." Sweat stood out on Moriarty's brow. "And I do, as it happens. But I'm going to let the information out a bit at a time. There are so many little groups of madmen just waiting to be acknowledged, and they're all going to have their day in the sun. And the chaos that will ensue as the world tears itself apart…." Moriarty pressed a hand to his chest and closed his eyes. "Sublime.
"Mycroft kidnapped me today."
"It's true, though, isn't it?" He had to play things down a bit. He hadn't gleaned enough from the Wikipedia article to get a read on Benedict Cumberbatch's personality, and his nervous panic in their little anomaly probably – possibly – wasn't his usual demeanour. Friendly and stupid seemed to be doing the trick so far. "I expect it'd be quite worrisome."
Sherlock dropped the tube and put his hands on TWH's inner thighs, spreading them further apart. He bent and suckled on the tip of Tom's cock, tracing his tongue round the head, delicately touching the slit. He unfastened his trousers with one hand and grasped his cock, rubbing frantically as Tom writhed and cried out underneath him.
he didn't want to. "If you want me to."
"Hell," he said softly.
"Delighted," Sherlock said, eyeing the group warily. "Couldn't be more pleased. Let's chat some more."
John sniffled. "Sherlock –"
"I know."
. There was a card from the Mayor's office. A few addressed to "Uncle Stephen." A card from Dedalus Communications, the front picture Dedalus' logo, a stylised drawing of a winged man, wearing a Santa hat – how droll. Inside, the standard corporate holiday wish, and underneath, in neatly inked capitals,
Sherlock closed his eyes again and rolled them. It had been a while since he'd had personal contact with a serial killer. He'd have fallen asleep if he hadn't a job to do. Keeping Henry talking was imperative. He blinked, shook his head a little as if wooziness was taking over and frowned. "He…he did tell me." He glanced over at TWH, who was sitting bolt upright, the rapid rise and fall of his chest clearly indicating his agitation and fright. Tom met his eyes and shook his head as if he'd wished Sherlock had kept quiet.
It was ridiculous that the smallest stimulation could produce so strong a reaction, it –
"Look at that." John pointed at the pile of shredded photo paper. "Whoever sent that sent it to our house, Mary. That means they know where you live. They know you've got a family. They're probably keeping tabs on you. Whatever this is…however you plan to fix it, you're not doing it while you live under the same roof as my daughter."
"Decent tailors," Ben said. "I think that's the extent of it."
Dr Paisley's mouth curved upward. "Just relax. We won't be long." She moved aside, and two techs came in with what looked like some very expensive and sophisticated electronic equipment. They gently urged Benedict to remove his shirt, then attached sticky electrode bits to his temples, chest, arms, and belly. They wired the bits to the machine.
"Sounds good." It sounded awful, though he couldn't say why. "See you tomorrow."
Though he hadn't even thought about racing in a week or more, he realised.
"Question her about what?"
"I reckon why take chances?" Moriarty asked with a shrug. "This is a private chat – you, me, and Johnny here. Well, you and me. I don't think I'll take the tape off his mouth. It's not like he ever has anything interesting to say anyhow."
Benedict's head hit something soft, and the hand gripping his became corporeal again. His body gave a convulsive twitch, and he opened his eyes.
?" He turned to John. "Moriarty was doing his best to spearhead a terrorist air strike, but he lost a crucial link when I derailed Irene. So he eliminated her." The explanation didn't mitigate the guilt he felt knowing Jim had had her murdered; Benedict wished it had. "Human life means very little to him. Obviously."
"Hm? Oh – oh, yes. Let's go." He got up from the chair and swayed.
"Thanks. It's okay. It's just…." Mary looked over her shoulder. "It's been a bit of a whirlwind." She sat at the table and prised open the beer with the church key John set on the table. "I'm still sorting it all out in my head."
"Mum," Nora said, "why'd she call you Annie?"
"Sherlock is very busy," Mary said, "and I don't want you to be disappointed if he doesn't turn up, Nora. But if he does come, you'll address him as Mr Holmes. Politely. Understood?"
"I'm an
bigger fish to fry." He looked at Moran. "Shoot him."
A distant alarm bell began clanging in the back of Sherlock's brain. He silenced it. "That's quite generous."
And none of them were signed except this one.
"It's not very useful, though, is it?"
Yet another display of infantile petulance. It would be amusing if it weren’t so god-awfully harrowing. But, likely it had little to do with an information systems asset (Mycroft refused to use the word ‘hacker’ – it fell so insalubriously on the ear) claiming knowledge of election tampering and secret servers in Bradford expected in Moscow and failing to turn up. Possibly.
"Ben? Could you untie me?"
"Politics," Mycroft said with a sour smile. "We do not wish to make waves. Some – many, actually – of the pieces were in places and hands best not publicised, and all parties generally agreed that quiet transactions were best."
"You knew. You knew he was alive all along. And you did nothing."
"Excellent name." John guided Nora onto the carriage and found a seat. He listened to her soothing chatter and hugged her close. This life, this routine, was good, exactly what he needed to assuage the occasional unwelcome burning of his heart. He wished to God he hadn't seen Sherlock the other day. It was easier to picture him distantly and sometimes in the papers. Secure in his imaginings, Sherlock could remain a remote, cold figure, somebody he once knew. Seeing him in person, up close, knowing that he'd got on and was continuing to get along, that was a different kettle of fish altogether.
Fuck.
He would see that the grave received proper looking-after and come back in a few years, perhaps, when time had begun its ineffable work.
He took a fresh towel, rubbed it over his hair, and drifted into Cumberbatch's sizeable closet-cum-dressing room. He turned on the light (track lighting, in a closet. Really?), found a nice white shirt, then tried it on and tossed it aside – too large. He tried on three more shirts in succession before finding one that fit him snugly. It was a cream colour with fine threads of indigo blue, and already pressed and lightly starched. Ugh. He pushed suit after suit aside, letting some drop to the floor, until he found one in a deep navy – not quite as slimly cut as his own, but not as hideously billowy as some of them seemed to be, and as a bonus, faintly scented with cigarette smoke. He rummaged through the drawers for a decent pair of underwear and some socks, then selected a pair of shoes, not quite able to tear his eyes from the pair covered with glittering paillettes.
Mycroft's voice resounded in his head, contemptuous and cold.
Sherlock swung the door open onto a darkish room – lots of gleaming mahogany and ebony, plum-coloured sofas, hand-painted wallpaper, heavy, fussy silk curtains, artfully scattered oversized books and magazines on low tables. Professionally decorated, Cumberbatch hadn't been living here long enough to really make it a home yet, and this was his first set of furniture that hadn't been purchased at IKEA, so he was still frightened to upset the balance the decorator had created and probably urged him not to disturb. He'd read the books and magazines, though, but had taken them into another room to read them and then came back to carefully replace them. Cumberbatch wasn't mad about this room, hardly used it at all.
Tom's hand tightened. "Are you all right?"
Sherlock inspected her closely. "You haven't gained more than five pounds –"
"Shut the fuck up!" Moriarty shrieked. "Fucking
"Yeah. You feel like a shower?"
"Biochemistry should do."
Reminiscing:  the first sign of encroaching senility. Only fools and bores reminisced, looking backward instead of forward. But it wasn't the first time he'd done it since all this began, was it?
He pressed his hands to his face. John mightn't be able to fix things, in fact he almost surely would have some sort of furious meltdown were he trapped here, but it would be good to have him close by.
"You arsehole." Tom glared up at him. "That really fucking hurt."
Benedict hesitated, then went back to scraping out his dish. "That's none of your business," he said, hoping a snotty answer would cover any ambiguity.
Heat rose in John's face at that last. "Sorry."
" He got to his feet – one of his knees creaked alarmingly – and took the pillow-case to the window. He opened the window, tossed the fabric onto the little metal grate that probably held flowers in summer, then went back to Sherlock, prising his mouth open to check for vomit. "Good." He grabbed Sherlock under the armpits and hauled him up with a great deal of effort. "Oh, fuck's sake." The case had been loose over Sherlock's head, and it hadn't been ten minutes since they'd parted, so there wouldn't be any irreparable damage beyond some irritation of mucous membranes, probably, maybe nausea and a headache as well. The effects of halothane didn't last terribly long – twenty to thirty minutes at most.
Nora had put down her tablet and was staring at Sherlock in fascination. "Hello, Mr Holmes."
and he said –"
"I'm right here, Mycroft," John said. "You don't have to talk about me in the third person." He never could take Mycroft seriously. He wasn't a patch on Sherlock for flamboyance, but when it came to drama, the pair of them ran neck and neck.
"Oh! Oh, that's – are you two together again? Erm, working together, I mean?" A deep flush suffused Molly's cheeks.
Ben smiled wryly. "I don't have much choice."
Sherlock, positioned across the grave in order to keep a weather eye on John and Nora, pulled his coat more tightly round himself against the wind tugging it outward, and wrenched his gaze away from father and daughter for a moment to squint at the sullen, slate-coloured sky, from which a frigid rain fell, or blew sideways with extreme prejudice.
The journalists and photographers crowded around Benedict, blocking his path to the door.
"It's beginning," Mycroft murmured.
"Bugger." They got into the lift. Sherlock was silent a moment. "Well done, John."
John flushed. "Well…it's a bit –"
"When I got sh – it's been a while." Sherlock didn't meet John's eyes, and John supposed he'd walked into that one. "I do sleep," Sherlock added witheringly, "when I'm undisturbed."
Mycroft's brow shot up. "Must I enumerate? Very well. Your timorous entrance into the house. The manner in which you ate your soup. Your lack of comment on the flavour of the soup – Sherlock detests consommé.  Your lack of comment on the doneness of the chips. Your choice of condiments. Your remark about –"
"I was concerned, Sherlock. Surely that's not a crime? Ah," Mycroft said, nodding as a maid came in with a large tureen. "Thank you, Edith." She served them, ladling what looked like an herbed consommé into shallow bowls.
!" Sherlock ducked into the room with the phone, a book-lined study. The phone, a mid-twentieth-century heavy plastic model with a dial instead of a button-pad, continued to ring. "Damn it," Sherlock muttered, as John skidded to a halt beside him. "I was hoping there'd be an answerphone."
Sherlock lifted an eyebrow and took a drink. "Maybe you shouldn't say it to yourself."
John ground his teeth hard. "Where's Mary?"
"Hm? Yeah, love?"
"Mm-hm. Bit melodramatic." John poured tea and plopped two spoons of sugar into Sherlock's.
Nonplussed, Sherlock went to the desk, spotting John in conversation with another nurse. She smiled at John and leant forward in a confidential manner. "You're where?"
It was the wine, making him maudlin, affecting him the way it did any common idiot. His throat tightened, and his eyes itched.
John shuffled his feet. "Yeah, I reckon so. You look great. Hey, Sherlock told me you were expecting. Congratulations. To both of you."
"Oh my God, she's so cute. That little accent!" Trish turned to John and flung her arms round him as well. "It was
Sherlock gaped.
"Certainly, certainly," Guthrie said, folding his hands on his gilt-edged leather blotter. "We have several hundred such individuals in the UK and –"
Tom began to struggle, but part of his brain couldn't accept what Henry was saying. Those letters – he'd been getting them for weeks. Why now, why Henry – and Benedict, oh, God –
"I know it wasn't the only one you owned, but still. Sorry." John shifted from foot to foot.
"He's affectionate, you horse's arse. That's what affection is like, not that you would know. All you've got is your fucked-up relationship with your brother." Cumberbatch flung Sherlock's hand away and stalked to the outermost edge of the white space. "Oh, and not that you give a shit, but your flatmate is being framed for murder by Jim Moriarty. He stole John's gun and used it to commit a murder in Brighton, where John spent the day. I asked Mycroft for help and he said he would, but I don't think he got to the files in time, I'm not certain. So, you know, cheers for asking about him."
The voice was familiar, but Tom couldn't quite pinpoint who it was. His head hurt so much. He tried to sit up, but his body wouldn't let him and he slumped back down. He couldn't see at all – something soft pressed against his eyes.
Moran gave him the smile that failed to flatter him, ageing him into a prematurely old man, but it still held a politician's soulless charm. "In all my years in Parliament, I'm certain your brother's never hosted any remotely social gathering at his house, and he certainly didn't conduct business there. I've never met him at all, in fact, though I knew him by repute."
Softly, Sherlock closed the door and moved from the dark front room into a corridor, and from there into an immaculate, well-appointed kitchen, sleek, lots of brushed metal and pale-grey tilework. Uninteresting. Tiny bathroom, library – this room used frequently, stuffed with books, new, scarcely used desk, laptop, another sofa, leather, long enough to sleep on.
Sherlock took a step backward. "I'll hit you back."
"Come out, come out, wherever you are!" Moriarty's voice sang out.
"Shapley unit functional."
"Human cloning isn't a medical or scientific feasibility yet. Certainly wasn't in the late '70s, either, despite all that
"We are," Sherlock said, quite patiently if he said so himself, and rolled Tom to his stomach. "Looks as if he wat – oh, for God's sake."
"Ooh, okay." He looked up, past John, his eyes dreamy behind his tinted lenses. John started to pivot a second too late. Something that felt like a brick crashed into his skull, and he saw the gritty marble tiles of the Moran entry hall rising to meet him.
"Oh, bugger, I forgot the – hold on, back in a flash." Tom pivoted on his heel and left the room abruptly.
"Hey." Jim proffered a seven-quid Sainsbury's bouquet of mixed flowers and a pizza. "I'm sorry for dropping in on you like this, but it's been almost a week and I miss you."
"Tom…." Graham said. "Look here –"
"Oh, yes." Sherlock's mouth turned up on one side. "'The Deadly Darts.'"
And now they were talking about Molly, and John, still muzzy-headed, could scarcely gather his thoughts before Moriarty kicked him twice, his foot like a leather-covered brick slamming into his vastus lateralis, a dead-on shot. John gasped and curled up to try to avoid the blows, but it didn't do any good. Through the pain he heard Ben shouting and Moriarty answering, and then he saw Ben rising awkwardly to his feet and pressing his backside against a low wall. John blinked hard and tried to clear his head.
John was jolted back into reality. He'd hardly given Mary's inheritance a second thought while he was with Sherlock, except for that hesitation about telling him. Why he'd hesitated anyhow….
"I'll pass," Benedict said curtly.
"Mm." Ben was curled up in Sherlock's chair, looking a bit shell-shocked.
Sherlock's head struck the doorjamb, and he saw an entire constellation sparkling before one of the stars went supernova and he saw nothing at all. He heard John's exclamation of anger and surprise, though, and the retreating heavy footsteps, out the window, the metallic rush of the fire escape. He permitted himself to grey out for a few moments, undone by weak relief:  John was safe.
" He closed his eyes and breathed deeply, pulling in the scent of peonies from the arrangement on the table next to him. He touched the velvety edge of one bloom, then swept his hand out, sending the flowers and the seventy-thousand pound vase that contained them crashing to the floor.
"Don't," Mycroft said sharply. "Don't try to play me for a fool, Sherlock. You have associates, contacts, informants, allies. You haven't got a single friend who's lasted more than a few months until John Watson limped into your life."
"What?" Lestrade looked from Benedict to John, frowning.
"St. John." Tom brightened. "Well, we'll make it up after dinner. And I've got you the rest of the weekend, at least."
She sniffled again and nodded. "He's in love with somebody else."
John waited until he heard the soft click of the closing door, and then breathed again. He waited a few more minutes, then set to tidying the kitchen, turning the dishwasher on, putting away leftover food, wiping up crumbs. He emptied the rubbish bin of its bag and took it to the large bin in the back garden; Nora would never see the photo, and she'd been taught not to open anything not addressed to her. Of course, if whatever lunatic who'd sent this mailed something to her – well, John would simply have to monitor the post, that was all.
After that it had been easy to establish his patterns, to follow him at will. He'd watched him more than a dozen times on the Tube, to his music lessons (he'd quit at eighteen, following an angry argument with his instructor – Jim had strained to hear but the walls had been too thick), to concerts (it was the only time he'd ever seen those glacial eyes soften, watching Itzhak Perlman), to classes (chemistry, chemistry, chemistry – snore), once to a scary house in Bromley where, hours later, Sherlock had stumbled out glassy-eyed, high as a kite, and it had been a real temptation to catch up with him. Later, he followed Sherlock on a few cases, to watch him work, darting here and there, hands flashing, eyes blazing. It had been impressive, and James Padraic Hubert Moriarty was not among the easily impressed. Only then did Jim think of himself as a fan. The thing with Carl's shoes hadn't been a fluke.
Mary gasped. "Stephanotis! Gosh, masses of them! Sherlock, you are naughty. Thank you so much." She took the flowers from John and buried her nose in them as John had done. "Mmm. Isn't that gorgeous? I'll go find something for them. Would you like a drink, Sherlock?"
Mycroft was waiting outside the gates. Sherlock did his best to sail by despite the shrieking knee, but Mycroft caught his arm. "Sherlock."
"You're a terrible host, Sherlock."
"What pretty hair you've got." Two years ago he might have touched it in casual appreciation; now he only smiled.
"Are you okay?" Mary asked.
Benedict managed to get seven hours of sleep in Sherlock's not-terribly-comfortable bed before the mobile shrilled next to him. Actually, shrilled wasn't quite the word – it played the first eight notes of Beethoven's Fifth. Startled, blinking, Benedict scrabbled for the mobile and answered sleepily. "Hello?"
with emotion. The ordeal was over, the killer apprehended, and Tom was safe, for God's sake – what was there to cry about?
Sherlock obliged with a long-suffering sigh. "You woke me for
, your Lordship? Doesn't she have a name?"
At length John drew back again, his eyes wet. He sniffled, then offered Sherlock a shy grin. "Sorry." A tremor of apprehension shivered through his voice.
"Nothing. So how long did it take you?"
Molly's face screwed up, and for a second Benedict thought she was going to cry. "It's…it's odd, that's all. I don't think I…." She held perfectly still, and her cheeks turned scarlet. "Er…I think I'll just…." She climbed off and sat beside him on the sofa, though not nearly as close as before, wrapping her arms round herself.
!" he shrieked, then giggled. "Just kidding. Of course I expect you to watch. I'm not going to kill you right away. I think Johnny might show up, if you're lucky. And Miss Mary, too. Both armed and dangerous. What if they shot each other? Gosh."
Mary opened the window a crack and listened to the beginning of the dawn chorus in the low clumps of shrubbery that surrounded a hunched-together row of grotty little council flats. She checked her watch – nearly half five. She sipped at her coffee, surveying the flats, watching two sets of young men weaving toward each other, bottles in hand. They talked in too-loud voices, a nasty counterpoint to the birds who were effectively doing the same thing –
"You don't have to ask me twice." Finding his order – spareribs and rice with a side of stir-fried veggies – he dug in happily. They ate and drank in silence for a while. Surreptitiously, John watched Sherlock eat his soup and chicken, watched the bits of food disappearing into Sherlock's mouth. A funny pang overtook him, and a spreading ache.
Sherlock nodded.
"Siblings," Sherlock muttered, and sat up. "Siblings, John! God, I'm an idiot."
funny. In fact, I'm pretty sure it's the
"But you think someone went rogue and took revenge on her," John said. They got into the lift. "That's a pretty nasty way to do it."
"Strawberry."
John pulled it. "Elaine McGregor. Fine. Done and done." He tossed the stack aside, shucked his bathrobe, and climbed into bed. "Freezing."
"He's been with me most of the day."
Mrs Hudson clasped her hands together. "Oh, no." She shook her head. "Well, thank goodness he's got you for a flatmate – you'll sort it out in no time. Do you want some tea, love?"
John was fading; he felt it in his limbs, his suddenly thick tongue, his tired, already-fogged brain. He heard Benedict cry out again, and wanted to help, but he wasn't capable of it. His vision dimmed and his eyes slipped closed.
Proper genius, this Cumberbatch fellow.
me," John said. "Me, and Mrs Hudson, and Lestrade, and maybe his brother. Is that why you did it, Mary? Or were you just keen on the five million pounds? Hm? Sherlock didn't lie to my face for ten years." He pressed his hands together to keep from slamming them down on the table. "You know something? When he tried to tell me – and no way was I believing him because my wife wouldn't deceive me like that, not after doing it once before – I felt like the world's biggest fool. That is nothing,
He ran lightly upstairs and found Benedict in the same exact position he'd left him in. Sitting in the space between the end of the bed and Benedict's curled-up legs, he reached out and gently patted Benedict's hip. "Hey. Slugabed."
John stared at Sherlock. No,
Benedict's heart quickened just a bit. "I'm still in bed, Mycroft."
Sherlock remembered Kerstin Tresler's description of the people who'd removed the painting. "There was a man, too. Talked like cut glass, Ms Tresler said."
"Oh, for fuck's sake –" Benedict hurried to the other door and opened it to see two men, dressed in special-ops black and toting firearms. "Hi."
"Yeah. Yeah, I know. I just thought – never mind. Nora should be down in a bit. She was really excited that you were coming. Her birthday's in a few weeks and she hasn't so much as mentioned that, but your visit was a state occasion."
"The what?"
"Are you concerned about your personal safety, Ms Tresler?"
Unless Moriarty's scrambled Mycroft's phone.
"Would you like a cup of tea? It won't take a minute."
, the brilliant job that Jim Moriarty had done on her head, because she'd seen him at work long enough to know how much of it was true:  his watchers, his muscle, his tech toys. She'd never used a Dedalus phone, no matter how many times he offered – and perversely, never forced on her – and had actively discouraged John from buying one despite their attractively low price and dazzling features that included an array of spyware, of which MI5, MI6, the FSB, CIA, and the NSA were altogether ignorant – especially pathetic because it had become the phone of choice in most of those agencies. What Jim Moriarty didn't know could fill a Post-it note.
"Get up." Henry grasped Tom's arm and pulled. "Up!"
Benedict awoke to a gentle hand patting his face and another chafing his fingers. His whole body sagged in relief. They'd get him to hospital, give him a CT scan or an MRI or something, and everything would be okay again. Everything was okay
"Ye-es, darling?"
May 1990
More glass enclosed the office of Dedalus Communications' CEO, and the door was indeed open, but a hand-lettered cardboard sign on a string hung from the nameplate emblazoned with the name
"Well, to…to aid the police. I'm sure they had questions."
John poured Nora's drink and then his own. "Want some?"
"If you're quite finished?" Mycroft replied frostily. "No, John, they did not apprehend whoever was in the house with you. As you two were fleeing the house with a wrapped parcel, my team made a quick assessment and decided to concentrate on you." He coughed and flushed. "Obviously, they made a miscalculation. Unfortunate."
No. Sherlock would have to escape first. But he couldn't stop every goddamned loaded Dedalus store in the world on his own. "Disappointing, Jim."
John turned his attention to Moriarty. "Why don't you tell me what your business is, and I'll tell him."
"More to the point, who hired him?" Sherlock wondered aloud. "Mycroft upped surveillance on Moran's place in Derry, but…." He gestured imperiously toward his coat, which John had slung over the room's single chair. "Hand me my phone, John."
13 January 2015
"Sorry. I don't like being shut up like this."
"Sherlock."
Mycroft turned to Nora. "Eleanor, isn't it?" Nora nodded silently. "Follow me, please." He led John and Nora down the wide corridor to a sort of parlour, with soft, pale velvet sofas, a crackling fire, and a large armoire that he opened to reveal a television. He handed Nora the remote control and gestured to the sofa. "You can watch television if you like. Would you care for something to drink? Tea, or milk, perhaps? Something fizzy?"
"Right, I'm gone." Sherlock pounded down the stairs, and then back up. He hovered in the doorway. "Mycroft…."
"Don't care."
"It's not the aconitine, it's the perfume," Sherlock said. "Annick Goutal…
"He's in London. Well, he started in Wales, that's where we were shooting, but he's in London now. I can't explain it more than that. I know it sounds –"
“I have no idea. Maybe they didn’t use their hands at all.”
Moriarty's arms unwound from round Sherlock's body. He stepped back and perched on the padded bench, taking his phone out. "I did put a few Wing4s into production," he said. "You wouldn't believe the resolution on this thing, Sherlock." He aimed the camera. "You're on, Seb. Sherlock, this bit's for Seb, just so you know."
"Mn."
"Sherlock."
Henry's phone rang. "Oh, fuck." He let Tom go, pulling the tea towel away from his face. Immediately Tom turned his head to the side and brought up water, gasping and spluttering and sobbing, his throat and nose burning.
Benedict was off-script again, but he didn't care. If Sherlock really cared about John, he should have let him know somewhere, sometime. That was what friends did for each other. Fuck Sherlock and his deliberate obliviousness.
John unclenched his hands. "Yeah, love?"
He turned to John, but John was no longer there. "John? Damn it…." Yanking the cap off the peg, he turned it backwards and placed it on his head. He searched the pockets of the jacket and found a pair of reading glasses. Perching them on his nose, he strode into the hallway and accosted a nurse. "Sorry, sorry to bother you." His accent was Dublin. "My uncle Eamonn was here, Eamonn Reilly? Do you know where he is?"
Her name and address was written in gorgeous, flowing calligraphy, black ink on heavy cream-coloured stock, and a wax seal fastened the back flap closed. Looked like a wedding invitation. She broke it and pulled out the card.
"Has your car got a –" Sherlock twirled his finger.
But there was no going home, not now at any rate. He'd stepped off the stage only to discover another stage, this one world-sized and frightening even as it was familiar. He wasn't certain how long he'd have to keep this façade up; he thought he could manage the Hounds case with some degree of ease, but Reichenbach might prove a little more difficult. Surviving a six-storey jump was going to be problematic, for one thing, as he had no idea how to manage it and Steven had merely assured him that everything would be explained in due course.
"Ciaran!" The woman turned scarlet. "I'm so sorry, I – Ciaran, apologise to Mr Cumberbatch immediately."
Sherlock flapped a dismissive hand. "Relax, John. We've just got to get back on the R238. I'm sure I saw a sign for St Francis Road there."
He pulled Sherlock into his arms again. Between kisses, he made free with his hands, touching and caressing, drinking in Sherlock's body through his fingertips. He tried to be tender, but there was hardly room for tenderness or tranquility. John devoured Sherlock's mouth, stroking warm flesh trapped in crisp cotton, summer-weight wool. Unwilling to break contact, he urged Sherlock into the front room and dragged him to the sagging sofa, lying half on, half off his taut body. His prick throbbed, hard and needful. Sherlock arched his body upward, grinding against John's crotch, rutting.
"There you go. Truth is, I'm not sure. I lost track of her in Switzerland. But I'm pretty sure we'll see her soon. She's not best pleased with me."
Benedict held the phone tightly, his heart hammering in his ears, sick despair and desperate hope washing over him in a vast simultaneous wave.
Excellent.
"No," Mary said. "No, not the entire time."
"Sorry, love. What?"
"Everything all right?" Sherlock inquired.
Nice performance. Sherlock had seen better acting, and better props:  he'd once encountered an eighty-year-old multiple murderer who could produce a blue-faced coughing fit to rival any
Surrey
John had heard that noncommittal noise before. "Don't worry, I'll see that he follows instructions," he said, shaking her hand. "Thanks, Dr Roche." He took a quick look at the X-ray before ushering Sherlock out the door. Christ, life was unpredictable. Best to take the good things and hold them close.
"It's perfect. I've pulled the lasagna out and the bread's in the oven. We should be ready to go in just a moment. Nora!" Mary called. "Come on down, love, we're about to eat!" She smiled at them both. "Want to bring the lasagna in, John? I'll get the salad and vino. Sherlock, have a seat anywhere – we don't stand on ceremony."
He'd been so careful; he used a separate account, and it wasn't much. It hadn't been much. Lately, little amounts had been adding up. Had Mary looked at his phone? She'd always respected his privacy, but….
“In any event, I do appreciate it. If there’s anything I can do to repay it….” Mycroft cleared his throat. “If there’s any favour you might need, please don’t hesitate to ask.”
Mycroft sat and sipped. "And why should I do that? You seem to think I have unlimited power, Sherlock. I hate to disabuse you of the notion because I would hate to lose even a particle of the adoration you hold for me –"
Sherlock touched John frequently, going so far as to grasp John's face. He interrupted John's dates. He never disputed the frequent assumptions that he and John were a couple – that was John's job. And oh, wasn't it witty, but Sherlock never said
"Why, sure," Moriarty replied. "All you had to do was ask. But isn't there another question you want to ask me?"
John knocked his chair over scrambling up from the table. He pushed the chairs away from Sherlock's supine body, grabbed a wooden spoon from the worktop, and knocked the tongs from Sherlock's hand.
"Oh, yes." Sherlock stopped outside Eamonn Reilly's door and spoke
Henry drove at a deliberate speed, but even his minor actions demonstrated his shaken psyche:  he braked far too abruptly at a traffic sign, took the corner too fast, and overcorrected as the Land Rover swerved slightly. Sherlock winced; the headache was a knife slicing into his brain. He'd managed to turn his head and pull back just enough so that his cheek and temple took the greatest impact from the pan, which wasn't all that heavy – not that it hadn't hurt. He'd been stunned long enough for Henry to bind and gag him and had roused himself to full awareness as Henry was in the cellar abusing Tom. Sherlock had taken a moment to orient himself and then had swept his surroundings for something useful. He'd struggled up as quietly as he could, turned awkwardly, opened a drawer, and found a small paring knife – not terribly sharp, but adequate to cut the tape around his wrists with a little effort. He'd tucked it down the back of his underwear and got on the floor again, his head already throbbing. It was easy to feign grogginess as Henry forced Tom up the stairs and pushed him into the kitchen. Henry was in too much of a rush to realise that Sherlock was a full half metre away from where he'd left him, and Tom was terrified and concerned at once. He'd seen that expression in varying light and shade on John's face from time to time, and it never failed to soothe Sherlock a bit even under the most distressing circumstances. John rarely touched Sherlock unless Sherlock was hurt or otherwise incapacitated, and then he was gentle and kind. 	It was a trifle puzzling but not entirely unpleasant that Sherlock's occasional –
Mycroft couldn’t even be bothered to roll his eyes. Violet Holmes, empress of the mixed message. Years of exhortations to eat followed by comments on how tight his trousers had become had weathered his hide to iron.
,” she said firmly. “It’s a room, Sig. And I can’t see why a bit of cheer and colour would distract them. Aren’t they meant to be the best of the best?”
"Kids? Girlfriend?"
Benedict gazed hungrily at the food, but forbore from sitting down. Maybe John had invited one of the strapping security guards in, a little sauce for the goose. "That smells nice," he ventured.
Sherlock stepped inside and thrust a bunch of white flowers at John. "For Mary," he said, then helpfully added, "Flowers. And, erm…some wine." He showed John a bottle of red.
He reached into his pocket for his phone.
Mycroft perched on the edge of the deep copper bathtub. "That's not relevant at this juncture. Let me back up a moment. During that time, the party ended, and the guests departed with no apparent concern that their hostess had disappeared – not uncommon at large events with a great deal of social circulation.  Meredith was known to vanish for hours on end, talking about art with this or that client or acquaintance. It was her great passion. Even the last stragglers failed to comment on her absence. While the guests were leaving, the maid cleaned Meredith up in an effort to restore a bit of dignity, and subsequently felt ill. Georgina called me, I came here and called you. That's where we are."
"I've seen some of your other films too. And
"Why don't you have a shower?" Sherlock suggested tactfully.
A photograph of Trish was inserted into tiny slots on the left side of the card. On the right was a message in the same swirling calligraphy.
sleep. It's the absolute least you can do." He wheeled and marched upstairs without another word.
"Safe," Mycroft snorted. "Does he intend to enclose her in a plastic bubble? Achieve immortality somehow?"
"That's not even your area!"
"This is going to hurt you."
It was hard to believe, looking at them both. Sherlock was so…and John Watson…no, he
"You don't seem to believe me. But I warned you, didn't I, Sherlock? You can't say you weren't warned."
"Come on, tell Daddy." Moriarty's voice had dropped into a low, insinuating murmur. "Confession's so good for the soul. Be fair, now – I answered one of your questions. How long? Or – you don't
Jim let five seconds go by. "Okay," he replied quietly. "Was it something I did?"
Confused, John gaped for a moment. "Huh?"
Tom lifted Sherlock's legs again and got up. His own legs, bare to the very tops of his thighs, were improbably long, slender, but tightly muscled – an athlete's legs. He bent close, and Sherlock found himself imprisoned (and half crushed) by a pair of wiry, very strong arms. "I'm glad you're okay," Tom whispered, and kissed Sherlock's ear. He detached himself and smoothed back Sherlock's hair. "Back in a flash."
"What?"
"Oh, but it is. It really is." Moriarty settled back into his chair. "Want to hear something funny? We didn't know it when we moved in here, but there are seven bodies buried in this cellar. Found them almost by accident. Must have been the mid-80s, because everything was still pret-ty smelly, if you follow, but by the looks of their clothes they were squaddies. The orange kind. Oh, the Troubles, the Troubles." He exaggerated his accent, shaking his head in mock regret. "You think their mothers miss them?"
Sherlock pocketed the silver coin and tossed the sippy cup in the bin. For a fleeting second he thought about fishing it out and returning it to John, but Nora was nine, hardly drinking from sippy cups any longer, so he let it lie in the bin, probably with the powdered remains of milk still clinging to its plastic walls.
Benedict munched on another biscuit, delicious but empty calories. He craved real food. "Look, I don't know what you've got on for the day, but I was wondering…I know it's presumptuous, but I was wondering if you'd mind if we did run round London a bit. I'd love to see
Sherlock hadn't much use for passivity. Even his moments of physical inactivity were laden with purpose and their own peculiar brand of industry:  cogitation, processing, connecting fact to fact, axons to dendrites until order had been established, gathering restorative energy through breathing and digestion and sleep. The very thought of inertia was maddening.
"Yes. Tell me."
"Understood."
"Can't follow someone else's directions," Sherlock said, thumbing the phone on. "No password, John? Honestly."
A tall woman, solidly built and wrapped in a long camel-hair coat stood on the doorstep of Lord Moran's house, impatiently rifling through her handbag.
She swerved onto the shoulder at speed and nearly drove over an embankment. Tears of rage pooled and fell, and she slammed her hand against the wheel.
He scarcely felt the needle, or his body dropping. He closed his eyes and let them take him.
Mycroft turned. "What is it?"
Charming.
John climbed in beside him. "What else?"
"Bogside," Moriarty said, interrupting his thoughts. "God, Sherlock, smoke's practically coming out of your ears. I didn't hit you that hard."
Sherlock scowled. "Yes?"
John moved back another half step. "Me? Not a lot. Sometimes. Why?" He lifted his chin, half-challenging, the defensive posture of the addict:
"Hang on just a minute," Benedict said, closing his fingers over the warm spheres again. "We should have a moment to talk. I…I just wanted to say that I feel like I gained a lot of insight into your life and your world. You really do live on the edge. It's more than my heart can take." He smiled.
"Christ, spare us the grizzling, Graham." Henry tossed back the last of his triple Scotch. Difficult to separate the man from his alcohol if he actually brought it into the loo. "You've had your chance." He gave Sherlock a quick conspiratorial smile. "Sure you're okay?"
Sherlock raised an internal set of eyebrows at Mycroft's familiar use of Lady Howe's name. It wasn't the first time. "Well, Lord Moran's tastes in art are catholic, but as you can see from the photographs of his family's home –" Sherlock took the phone and called up a saved site. "Obviously the most favoured stuff is pre-Enlightenment. And where, brother dear, is his family's home?"
" Henry kicked the other chair over a bit and nodded curtly at Tom. "Now."
"Nick Dedalus was taken into custody following the discovery of multiple detonation devices in all Dedalus flagship and satellite stores," another voice said. Sherlock detached himself from a shadow, leaning on a cane and walking with care. Mycroft nodded in greeting, and Sherlock returned the nod.
Sherlock neatly caught the pair of gloves John tossed his way. "Steenie Moran? Oh, he fled, no question. The house is dark, staff is gone, no evidence of a struggle, his phone is still in the house according to Mycroft – likely he's got a burner phone for emergencies. I think our friend in the luxury SUV tipped him off. Someone must have been watching the house. That, or Mycroft trusts his own people far too much."
"I need a drip," Sherlock said through gritted teeth. "My wounds hurt. And I need to know what room John Watson is occupying. Immediately."
"Oh, it's not nearly as dramatic as it sounds. It's not as if there were secret meetings in jungle palaces with swastika banners and hidden portraits of the Fuhrer. Some of them ranked high, but mostly they were men like my father – functionaries who were smart enough to wriggle out before the Allies caught them. They changed their names, lived quiet lives, died quiet deaths." Tresler inhaled and blew out a plume of smoke that twirled itself lazily into an arabesque, eddied by some unseen ventilation. "And most were never caught. If you look on the left side of some of the entries, you'll see small circles drawn beside them. Those were the ones who disappeared, publicly or mysteriously."
Better yet, somewhere familiar.
"Ow! Hey –"
"Maybe later." Four hours in a parallel universe and already Sherlock was bored out of his mind. If things didn't improve soon, he was going to have to go out in search of some excitement. He wondered who was in charge of homicide and serious crime at this version of the Met and if they'd object to him poking around a bit. Not that it mattered if they did object.
Cumberbatch's voice boomed out, but distantly, as if he'd been yanked backward into a tunnel. "Your hand –"
"Yes." A tear rolled down Sherlock's cheek, then another.
Be well, and back soon, I hope.
She blinked, then smiled in return, taking the mask from his hand. "I suppose so. The strangest thing, Mr. Cumberbatch – you said you touched the cable?" Her voice was soft, with a faint Scots burr. Happily married except for insecurities about her looks, played the guitar in her spare time, recent anniversary judging by the indent on her finger (thin circlet of all diamonds next to the band and engagement ring, too small but too vain to tell her husband to have the ring re-sized).
He was still trapped between belief and disbelief; he didn't know
"Yes," Sherlock said softly. He frowned and straightened his spine. "You're all right? You and John?"
– very pleasant indeed, and he didn't want to alienate John. On the contrary; his companionship was –
---God
"Please." He patted her hand. God, he hated wheedling.
Sherlock looked confused. "But I –"
He couldn't, though – not with Benedict helpless and at Henry's mercy, not even for a minute.
"Give it to me," John snarled, and sniffed at the water. It didn't smell funny. He took a sip himself. Tasted okay. If not, he was fucked, but he didn't think Jim Moriarty would take the trouble of breaking into their flat just to poison them.
"Then why isn't John with you? He's always with you when you solve mysteries."
"She didn't say." Or Mary had neglected to tell him, which wasn't like her.
"Just feeling her out. I don't think she's a secret Nazi, if that's what you're saying."
The upstairs door creaked, and leather-soled shoes began the descent. Moriarty. Then another, Vibram soles, then two more, heavy lug-soled rubber. Sherlock stopped struggling as Moriarty came into view, two litre bottles of water in hand. Sebastian Moran and two other distressingly strong-looking men followed behind.
"How did we get in here?"
Cumberbatch's fault. Maybe he did a brilliant job of styling on his own, but it certainly didn't fall into place the way it was meant to do.
Molly’s ears pounded with surging blood. “You mean…Sherlock fancies John.”
John's mouth went dry. "What?"
Sherlock lifted one shoulder in studied indifference, but drummed his fingers on the table nervously. "Well, it's sorted for the moment."
"No wonder Lady FitzSimmons was so surprised to hear that name. Hardly anybody calls Lord Moran Steenie."
Sherlock felt the edge of the knife pressing against his left arse cheek. That was going to be difficult to explain if Henry saw it, but there was nothing for it now. He was grateful that Cumberbatch appeared to favour rather form-fitting underwear; with a bit of luck it wouldn't slide down his trouser leg. He gauged the route they were taking, out of the tiny village and onto a bumpy, ancient macadam back road. Blinking hard to clear his head – no concussion, but there'd be a hell of a mark – he glanced around the interior of the Land Rover as far as his limited vision would allow.
John moved closer. Her feet were bare. He touched them, distressed at how cold they were. Gently, he rubbed them, looking at them and not her white face nor her imprisoned body. She'd painted her toenails, a vivid, cheerful pink like the summer roses she grew in the back garden.
Grateful acknowledgment to kimberlite and vilestrumpet, my most excellent beta/britpick team. Thank you!
Mary traced a fingertip over the back of the photo and sighed. "It doesn't matter."
Moran swung.
"Mary," he said softly, but she didn't reply.
6-1-5-4.
"How did you know that?"
"Meredith Howe. Lady Meredith Howe. She's – she
"Run!" John shouted, and clawed at the arm that settled round his neck. Something sharp drove into his upper arm, and heat permeated the flesh and travelled outward from the tiny pinpoint of discomfort. He struggled harder, aware that more men had entered the room and were moving toward Benedict, who hadn't run.
"Do you know anybody who works here?"
"Well, whatever the case," John said uneasily, still remorseful and guilty enough to not want to rehash that night, "I'm nervous, that's all. Mary's not the only one I've got to explain things to, and it's…I'm having trouble working it out in my head."
"Sherlock, where do you get your shirts made? Where's your coat?"
"Oh, stop whinging, for fuck's sake. You're all right." Henry crouched beside Tom and untied the rope from round his head. "Come on," he said, patting Tom's cheek. "Get hold of yourself."
, not –"
"Please lie supine, Mr Cumberbatch," Dr Paisley said.
the brain cells got fried." She reached up, cupping his cheek, kissed him lightly on the mouth, and went into the house as Sherlock moved aside. "I'm not staying, I've got a date. But I wanted to see how you were holding up. I expected to find you with all your hair burnt off and your skin blackened, creature-style."
"God, do we have to?" John unwrapped his sandwich, a bacon, cheese, lettuce, and tomato toastie, inspected it briefly, and took an enthusiastic bite. "Mm."
"I'm at the hospital with Sherlock, sweetheart. He got hurt, and I want to make sure he's okay."
"What is it now?" Mycroft's voice said impatiently.
Stephen stood and paced, rubbing his hands together. He hated this flat just outside of Stoke-on-Trent, its views nothing but ugly industrial structures and sagging abandoned factories, damp, dreary, squarely proportioned, utterly devoid of beauty and charm. But it was safe. Thank the Lord for His myriad wonders. "Sorry. The sudden move's got me a bit rattled."
"Yeah, I guess everybody eventually fills their space, no matter how big it is. I'm just sort of relieved we're past the stage of prams and nappy bags and wheeled toys everywhere. Occasionally there's an explosion of stuffed pets, but mostly they're contained." He stuck his nose into the blooms. "That's lovely. What are these?"
"I love you, Ben." Tom kissed him with tender affection. "Love you."
A bit wild, in fact.
He'd been lucky. The people Benedict had trusted with his affections had loved him with whole hearts; they'd never wanted pieces of him – not his pedigree or his money, such as it was; not his growing fame or his looks, once they'd emerged; not his body or his thirst for living as complete a life as he could. But from the show (and it didn't matter who was living out whose dream; the distinctions were so fine as to be pointless) it seemed clear that Sherlock and John needed each other.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "Don't worry."
"Bacon and veggie frittata."
He ordered a coffee – mercifully, the woman behind the counter seemed to have no idea who he was – and slumped at a table. Clearly, he needed a new strategy, one that didn't involve a lot of public exposure. He'd have to do more research.
Nora pulled a face, but John frowned at her warningly. "Sounds great," he said. "Do you need help?"
Also, Benedict was wearing pants.
"Probably wanking in the loo."
"I'm certain," Mary said without turning. "Thank you."
“I’m afraid I didn’t follow popular music.”
John was right.
"Cumberbatch."
Another ten minutes passed before she found the Graham-McCune funeral home; it was pretty, actually, nestled in a few acres of what was probably nice parkland in spring and summer. She parked her car in the near-empty lot, adjusted her hat, and swung her high-heeled feet out onto carefully salted blacktop. Thoughtful. Though if they'd been really thoughtful they'd have left it icy, then they might have had a few more clients. Probably some lawsuits too, though.
"Is that bit of scribbling on that paper in your handbag Steenie's current address?" Sherlock held a hand out, palm up. "That was your notepaper – cream linen, deckle-edged. It's not his writing paper – his is grey, with a plain monogram top centre."
"Hear our prayer."
"An arsehole," Benedict said, enunciating carefully. "They deserve each other."
"It was an accident," John snapped, but Benedict waved a languid hand.
"Besides…it was my fault, John," Sherlock said. "I was wrong."
"I've told John," Benedict said.
"And you didn't ignore me.
"And you're an actor. On telly."
"Oh, come on, you two. Or else Johnny Boy gets a lump of lead in his thick skull."
At length a small, neatly made man with a bristly mustache poked his head out the door. "Yes?"
John stuck his hands in his pockets. "You didn't have any trouble finding the place?"
"Yeah, I know. I wanted to do it myself." John looked round, rubbing his elbow. "Jesus, I don't know where to begin though."
"I'd better stop, or I'll end up mauling you and we'll be late for lunch." Tom grinned. "I don't want to muss you. You look very smart."
Might as well get right to it. "Yes. Specifically, an hour or so before her death."
"Smartarse." John wrapped his arms round Sherlock and nuzzled his neck. "Shut it, or I'll host another drinks party."
"You're here to harass an old lady, Sherlock?"
John sighed and covered his eyes with a hand. "That's not –"
John caught up with Sherlock. "Johann? Really? I couldn't be the bloke just giving you a tour?"
Though looking into Sherlock's eyes that night…who knows, maybe he might have done.
"You're leaving the surgery?"
"Still, I guess Sherlock likes that – you probably never surprise him. It's why you've flown under my radar for so long – you haven't been worth the effort of attention."
"Whatever she's done, she'd never –" John rubbed his mouth. "I'll bring him home, I swear it, Mycroft."
It was galling to actually be slower than the fat, bald git. "Procurement. Is that shorthand for 'thief?'"
"You were about to, though."
Life was good, his bitching about junkets notwithstanding.
She studied his face. "Do you want to?"
“Yeah, of course. Lunch first? My treat.”
No, he couldn't.
"That just eats you up, doesn't it?" John said suddenly. Aware that the gun was still pressed to his head, he turned his head with aching slowness. "It bothers the hell out of you that Sherlock isn't twisted, the way you'd like him to be. That he's got family, friends, people who respect and admire him. And he's never stopped fighting people like you – he's moved on from you, in fact. You thought he'd mourn you, maybe? Obsess himself with solving your disappearance?" John smiled nastily. "You think you're anything more than a problem to be solved, that you actually mean anything to him. You couldn't be more wrong."
"Good."
TWH sighed. "Don't – look, you've told me about it. A lot of people wouldn't agree, but I think some childhood hurts last longer – it can be a deep impression on a tender soul."
Mycroft got to his feet, took off his blazer, and unhitched a pair of bright red braces. As Benedict watched in utter stupefaction, Mycroft unbuttoned and unzipped his trousers. "I hardly think I need to."
"La-di-da." John moved across the hall. "Nice stuff, though." He turned his light onto a marble bust of a man in an eighteenth-century hairstyle and what appeared to be a naval uniform. "So should I be looking for anything in particular? You think Moran sent someone to take the Titus painting from Kerstin Tresler?"
It had taken three cabs ignoring him until one finally deigned to pick him up, and even then the cabbie gave him a doubtful look, obviously not fancying a gasping, sweaty man in a damp sweatshirt and brief shorts stinking up his cab. Tom sat in silence for the ride (only a mile and a half, but he was dragged out) and tipped the driver handsomely for not making any snotty comments.
He'd come. At least he'd come. Sherlock had spent the last fifteen hours sleepless, his heart thudding uneasily, wondering if John would cancel at the last minute. He'd composed a thousand replies to an imagined text from John:
"My name's Benedict Cumberbatch. I'm an actor. I don't know how all th –"
"Who, then?"
"Is that Mr Holmes' father?"
"Sherlock?"
Despite his exhaustion, he stayed awake for a long while, peering unhappily into the darkness.
“That’s an order.”
"Dr Watson." The charter airline's sole flight attendant was blonde and petite, dressed in a short-skirted red uniform vaguely reminiscent of a 1960s stewardess. "I'm so sorry to have to tell you this. We're experiencing some electrical issues and Captain Vaughan estimates that our takeoff will be delayed by an hour." She smiled, professional and apologetic.
"Intracranial haemorrhage," John said. "Same thing that put him in here."
Benedict made sure John was standing exactly where he needed to be, glanced at Irene, twisted his mouth into a sardonic smile, and turned the release on the safe. He dropped into a low crouch as the safe opened, and the gun discharged itself into the opposite wall.
"After an acceptable interval of time has passed, some of the restorations will indeed be publicised, but the origins of the pieces will remain vague. Today, though, I received a disturbing piece of news, and I can't help but connect it with Meredith's death."
Sherlock lay still for a moment, listening to a distinctive set of footsteps. He turned and opened his eyes. "Evening, Donovan. Took you long enough."
John had the feeling that he was meant to feel insulted, but that wasn't the case. Sherlock had told him that he was planning to drop it – and besides, it wouldn't have been the first time Sherlock had to be chivvied into taking a case. Sometimes it required a crowbar, in fact.
was having sex? Well, apparently the majority of people in this universe weren't any brighter than those in his universe. Unsure whether or not that came as a relief, Sherlock shook his head, turned the laptop off, and went to have a shower.
"Ah! Yes, yes –" Sherlock let tears well up in his eyes. "Please don't –"
John's hands settled themselves ever so lightly on Sherlock's chest. "Lie down. She's out of surgery."
"Oh." John laughed, a bit scornfully. "That's Molly, isn't it? She's a romantic."
He took the tea and biscuits back to the sofa and pulled the laptop close. Password protected. Fuck.
Or thought he did, anyway. The notion that Sherlock's casual cruelty had a soft gooey centre was…he couldn't countenance it.
In a welter of confusion, Sherlock moved to touch Tom's arm, but Tom started like a frightened colt, and Sherlock pulled back abruptly.
Benedict was sweating. John had never seen Sherlock break a sweat. And his replies weren't nearly as mocking and confident as Sherlock's would have been. It was amazing that Moriarty hadn't twigged.
"Wait. Wait. I've got to piss. I'm bursting." TWH sniffled, and wiped his cheek against his shoulder.
Inside the chest, grotesquely folded and bluish-grey in hue, was the body of Lady Howe's elusive PA, Georgina.
"How so?" Benedict asked casually.
"Traumatic brain injury. Please. Come on." He stepped backward, into the hall, and held the door open. "Come on," he repeated softly.
"Sorry," Sherlock said again, addressing Mary. A slight flush had appeared on his face.
"If I have to sit on you, I will."
Sherlock was crumpled on the floor.
"Really, John."
"You didn't invite me here for beef Wellington."
The car pulled away, rolling up a few narrow, twisting levels and driving smoothly through a set of ornately scrolled gates. Benedict recognised the area:  Whitehall. He gaped as they drove past 10 Downing Street and through another set of gates into traffic. Beside him, Anthea sat calmly, legs crossed, the toe of one greige high-heeled pump tapping against the wood inlay of the car door. She was texting busily, paying no attention to Benedict or her extraordinary surroundings.
Slowly, Kate reached for her mobile and dialled a number.
Sherlock had been offered a reward as well, and had turned it down in typical scornful Sherlock fashion. Mycroft, however, was more prudent and far cleverer, and had requested a piece from Stephen Moran's fabulous collection of
"Move," Henry snarled, shoving Tom forward into the island. He grabbed Benedict by the arm and hauled him up. Benedict staggered and found his feet. He caught Tom's eye, then glared feebly at Henry. "Right," Henry said in a brisk, take-charge tone. "Change of plan. We're going to one of the tenant cottages, the three of us." He looped an arm through Benedict's and held the edge of the knife against his vulnerable throat. Benedict lifted his chin sharply. "Tommy, you make the least fuss and Benny here gets a severed artery.
"Doesn't it?" Mycroft said, and dropped his cigarette to the gritty stained floor, grinding it out thoroughly with the toe of one shoe. "Seems a bit dull."
"It's not as interesting as you might think."
"God damn it," John whispered. "Motherfucking hell."
"Maybe." Sherlock got up and went to the table, gritting his teeth at the throb in his knee. He probed gently at the woman's feet, bending her toes back and forth. "Third toe on the left foot's broken too. Wouldn't have seen bruising because of the lividity, the downward position of her body."
"What? It's not Ben who's what?"
"How is it?" Tom asked, taking a forkful of his own starter, fresh radish with butter.
"His hand," someone said.
"Good. Good, Sherlock. Yeah, we're still dating. Thanks for not spilling the beans."
– John wasn't an idiot, and until he'd lived with Sherlock he'd never had cause to question his own intelligence, but time travel, or space travel, or whatever, was beyond his capacity to understand in a three-minute conversation.
"What the fuck do you
"Oh." Tom slipped his hands down to cup Benedict's arse.
"You told him not to bother." Cumberbatch's voice was soft. "You utter bastard."
LOCKED
The Under-Secretary nodded slowly. His complexion was a little alarming.
Tom nodded. "You'd know better than I would, of course. Look, it's only – you've got seven hours left before you learn what's happened. Let's go downstairs. I'll make you some tea and toast, and then we can…erm, work out what to do the rest of the day."
Sherlock smirked and kept scrolling. "Wanted to make certain I was still in practice."
Nora's shoulder heaved with silent sobs. She asked for so little, his small quiet sweetheart. She was so brave, so strong, and in that moment he understood Mary's ferocious silence to protect her, to save them all, even if it had meant Mary's life. He understood, and he forgave, but it was too late for that.
"Yeah, I'm just…really tired." He turned to Henry. "I'd better get to bed."
He touched Sherlock's hair, one springy curl, winding it round his forefinger, then traced over the outline of Sherlock's mouth under the wide white bands of medical tape. Whoever had applied the tape had pressed extra hard; even the little teardrop indentation above his upper lip was visible. That was going to hurt coming off, probably.
"Okay, then. You just sleep." John smoothed the blankets up, snugging them close to Sherlock's neck. He let his hand linger on Sherlock's shoulder, just for a moment, then turned away.
on his desk and presence in hospital on a Saturday night. "What can I say – I just think research is really important."
"Hear our prayer," John and Harry murmured.
Still curled up on the grey stone, John shifted and let out a muffled noise.
"Absolutely. Give me two minutes."
"Fuck. Hurry."
"Okay –" John's phone chirped with a text.
Nora's face was the picture of woe. "What are we going to eat now?"
"I do," Moran said. "I have a Strad and an Andrea Amati, but this is sturdy enough for daily use." Moran gestured to a chair upholstered in primrose velvet. "Sit."
"Okay!" She pounded down the stairs – amazing that a small girl could make so much noise – and sat at the table, wearing John's old shrunken jumper. "Can I have juice?"
"Mycroft!"
The man met his gaze coolly.
"I take it the gentleman who spoke to Lord Moran, if that was indeed Lord Moran, is no longer there," Sherlock said.
Sherlock turned, frowning. "Are you sure?"
Mycroft shivered, then primly tied his dressing gown closed and went to select an appropriate dark suit.
"Well. That term's a bit strong, I think. If we're splitting hairs, I only –"
to thank for getting Tom here, Ben. It's all right if I call you Ben?"
How aggressively dull Cumberbatch's life was. A lisp and hiding in the closet were his darkest secrets.
"No, I'm all right," Sherlock said.
Irene stepped away from John, who was breathing hard and who looked furious. "That's mine," she said, holding out her hand. "Give it to me, please."
"Tell him what's happened, if he hasn't already sorted it out. Tell him to the best of your ability, though God knows you'll probably make a hash of it, exactly what happens when we're in this space together, and don't forget to tell him it happens at the same time every –" Sherlock broke off as Cumberbatch's hand flashed out and cracked him across the face.
"He was with you in Derry, so."
"All right, then. Up you get."
"Right." If he tied Tom up, then…touched him a little, perhaps, it would all be over very quickly without any need for hedging or excuses. From the looks of him, he hadn't far to go before orgasm; his cock was nearly flat against his belly and glistening at the tip.
"Rumours of your death are greatly exaggerated." She set a small red frame handbag and the box of treats on the gleaming worktop, untied the ribbon, and opened it, revealing three rows of different-coloured macarons. "Pistachio, rose petal, and caramel. Pick one."
The footsteps returned, and Henry came in with a knife, a large watering can, filled judging from the way he was carrying it, and another tea towel slung over his shoulder. He smiled at Tom.
. That's what you told me, anyhow." What else was Ben hiding? Astounding musical ability, action-hero prowess – what was next, he fucking hunted big game with a blowdart in his spare time?
That stung. Benedict crossed his legs and laced his fingers together over one knee.
"Who's that?"
Sherlock lifted his eyes to the painted tin ceiling. "Yep. She did."
made for great television drama, but it was no way to treat a real human being. "John…don't be stupid."
“I know what you’re thinking. You’re still on kitchen duty.”
It wasn't just that Moriarty was waiting outside the loo – though that was a factor, obviously, and its own entirely different and worrisome and possibly highly poisonous kettle of fish. Benedict had never been excessively modest about his intellectual capacities, but he didn't have Sherlock-level mental gifts, and dealing with a brilliant psychopathic consulting criminal was slightly more than he was capable of even thinking about at the moment. What was more important was that John was right – he had a job to do, in a really weird way, and that John was counting on him.  Counting on Sherlock, but since Sherlock was in Benedict's London possibly fucking Benedict's boyfriend and ignoring threatening letters for fuck's sake –
all right, they look strong and capable, but they're so
"So am I," he said. "But it's too late for that."
The most important matter at hand was that Mycroft didn't know about Mary's involvement with Lady Howe's death (as he certainly would have said so if he did), and Sherlock intended to keep it that way. And perhaps now that Lord Moran had come to see him, he wouldn't need three days to solve this. He could wrap it up tonight.
yourself," Tom snarled. He reared back and spat at Henry, though it wasn't much of an attempt as his mouth had been leached of moisture.
Sig took a kissing sip of the terrible coffee he’d bought at the chippy van and squinted through the hypnotic back-and forth of the wiper blades. The road wasn’t in the best shape, and in the rain it was bloody awful. “I thought she appreciated some of the stuff,” he ventured.
"Mr Reilly knew him well, though, didn't he?" Sherlock demanded.
Chalk Stripe Appalling Moustache melted into sticky pudding. "Oh, it's perfectly all right, Mr Cumberbatch. It's just that another patron saw you and was afraid that you might be ill. I wanted to check, just to ensure that you weren't in need of medical attention. I hope it wasn't the food." He gave a rich, rolling chuckle. "If you're still feeling faint, I can certainly call a doctor, and there won't be any fuss. I can take you to my office."
Mary smiled. "Besides, she knows lots of rich people, some with pull at St Teresa's."
Whoever had sent the letters…they'd taken time to write out horrors, to describe them in detail (and grammatically correct and properly spelled at that) and hadn't neglected to mention Tom's physical and vocal reactions to the varying treatments in the letter, either. Charming. Also terrifying.
"Yeah. What do you want, Sherlock? I mean – what do you
Ella had given him one of those irritatingly perceptive looks.
"In five weeks? When were you going to let me in on that?" It wasn't a dreadful notion; Nora hadn't been abroad for more than a two week spell, and of course her outlook required broadening at some point, but he couldn't understand Mary's insistence, and besides, he'd just begun to reconnect with Sherlock. He didn't want to upset what still felt like a fragile balance between them.
John let out a harsh, dry sob and rested his head on his arms. "Fucked it up. We fucked it up."
"I don't want to be a surgeon anymore," Nora declared. "I want to be a pathologist."
"It's all right." Benedict settled back as the driver went into a blind alley and stopped the car. He glanced at Benedict again, and Benedict met his eyes. "Er – I think you can probably just –"
That, at least, was true. "Yes."
like Benedict. And if he didn't have a concussion and his brain wasn't projecting hallucinations as he slowly bled, he
No point in getting angry at morons. Nonchalantly waving Tom's protest away, Sherlock gave Peter and Henry a smile that didn't come close to touching his eyes. "Ready? Here goes:  she thellth theesh –" Horrified, he stopped as Henry and Peter burst into laughter. Diners at nearby tables stared in puzzlement at their sudden hilarity.
It had been his own fault, though, stopping by and thinking himself invulnerable.
Benedict sat in silence, wishing that he was Sherlock, if only for that moment. Everyone should hear a declaration like that at least once in their lives. He thought of Tom, and though it had only been two and a half days since he'd been stuck here, terrible pain and loss pierced his heart.
"Nora," John said gently, "come say hello to Sherlock." He reached out, caught her shoulder, and drew her close. She nestled shyly against him. "Sherlock, you remember Eleanor."
Sherlock moved back, both hands on John’s knees. “God, I hate when you do that.”
“Step away from the glass, please,” an electronic voice barked. Sig held his hands up in a conciliatory gesture and took two steps back. Behind the glass, Eurus failed to react at all.
"I do, I do. And I had something bigger planned. That offer I made you – it was a good one. We could have had something, you and me. But on the off chance that you'd refuse, I had this sort of scheme hatched – you know all this, I guess. I was going to discredit you systematically, watch you wriggle in the web, and then –" Moriarty held both hands up and snapped them into fists. "It was elaborate, but you know, I had some downtime."
, but great? Hardly.
Moran shook his head and chuckled soundlessly. "Is that what you think?"
"Altnagelvin Hospital. Eamonn Reilly's in…." Sherlock consulted the information Mycroft had given him. "Ward 40, room 312. South wing."
Sherlock tried to process this and couldn't. "I
"Sorry," Tom said quietly. "I wasn't thinking about John."
"Let's go for a walk. I'll call Mrs Pringle; she can sit here for a few hours, and we can –"
sake." Sherlock was breathing hard, clearly furious – but there was a quaver in his voice that sounded like fear. He wasn't afraid, was he?
"Jesus," he muttered, laughing a little.
Sherlock grinned.
"Moran?"
. "Sherlock, you said –" He turned, startled, at a sudden thump.
Mycroft turned back. "Yes?"
"You're aware, of course, that he was Provisional IRA?"
"Oh, you sweet talker, you." Mary wrapped her arms round John and kissed him deeply.
"Hey, you paying attention? I asked if you were feeling okay. We've got to board." Not-John frowned. "You've still got your makeup on. And your costume."
"Police? No, just me," Sherlock said, and darted out of the room and up the stairs. He found a sharp knife in a block, pulled it out, and ran downstairs again. "Here we are," he said, and deftly cut the rope binding Tom's neck to the handle of a wardrobe.
"Dr Watson?"
Jim, dressed in his regular clothes, crossed his legs and gave the guard standing over him a friendly smile.
"Would you…." John hesitated. "Would you look after her? If it is Moriarty, I'm afraid he'll try…try to get at her."
"I won't, though. I promise."
Cumberbatch had no idea how lucky he –
"You've killed me," she whispered. "You know that, don't you?"
"Make me," Moriarty crooned, and kicked John once more, sinking his foot into the muscle of John's thigh. John writhed in pain. "That moment in Bart's when the pair of you met, those show-offy deductions about him – ooh, Afghanistan or Iraq?" Moriarty's face was a twisted mask of rage. "That putrid little meet-cute – did you think I didn't know about that? How stupid are you, Sherlock? Honestly."
"Remember all the good they have done. Lord, in your mercy…."
"Yes, I give up. Tell me where you're calling from, darling."
"Sorry, John," he said quietly, and turned to go upstairs. He heard John sigh and follow him.
"I don't know."
An hour later, he was still reading, skimming through the fiction. Fiction, some of it oddly familiar. Just snatches here and there…so very odd. A Victorian predecessor in this universe, a work of fiction, layers and layers away. Sherlock set the phone on the seat beside him and gazed at Not-John, whose name was in fact Martin Freeman, fast asleep, his hands folded on his chest. Sherlock felt the oddest little pang looking at him, and wondered what John,
John finally twigged. "There wasn't an electrical problem at all."
"Would you like to have a Christmas drink at the club?"
Something in John's eyes flickered, and his brows drew together. "Yeah. Well, for what it's worth." He shrugged and half-turned. "I'd better –"
"A little digging into Lord Moran's art activities. Come on." Sherlock strode in and politely demanded to see the managing director, shamelessly wielding an ingratiating smile and his own name. In moments a small, tidily composed man in an indigo suit and a mustard-coloured tie emerged from a gleaming doorway, his arm outstretched in pre-emptive greeting.
"Yeah. It was weird."
"Yeah, it's, er, brilliant. We're on a few days' break while they work out some electrical issues." Sherlock took a step closer. "Did Tom mention any unusual letters that he'd received, erm – oh, God, your name's on the tip of my tongue."
