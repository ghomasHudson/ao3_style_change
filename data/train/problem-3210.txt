“Cas,” Dean said and waited until those blue eyes met his.  “I’d love to hear it.”
“You like her, like, you like-like her,” Sam said confidently.  He considered that a minute.  “Or him,” he added.  “You lurve him,” he said, teasingly, sing-songing the word ‘lurve.’
“Dean,” Cas growled.
“Yes, and you must be Dean,” Cas said over his shoulder.
It was official. Their furnace was toast. Dean threw down the wrench he’d been holding in frustration. He’d spent most of his Saturday trying to fix the damn thing, but he knew he couldn’t put off replacing it for another winter. Son of a bitch, he thought. Next week was Halloween; he and Ben wouldn’t be able to go much longer without a furnace.
Cas pressed a gentle kiss to his forehead.  “You won’t lose me.  I’ll be up near the snipers, like we planned.”
Dean and Cas looked up at Gabriel as he stopped in front of them, holding his briefcase.
Dean made an aborted motion with his hand.  “Don’t you wanna - cover up?” he asked weakly.
“Nice to meet you, Mr. Winchester. Ben’s a great kid and I look forward to working with him.” He released Dean’s hand, turned on his heel and left him slack-jawed.
During the afternoons, Dean sat Cas in a chair by the window and read to him from his favorite books.  He even found the book of Whitman poetry Cas loved so much he’d practically worn a hole in the cover.  He read, his voice breaking:
For a few long seconds Dean worried Cas was gonna leave it there. But he finally continued, his voice softer than Dean had ever heard it.
Dean nodded. “I haven’t felt this way about someone since - well, since Lisa.”
Gabriel shrugged him off, and pulled a Tootsie Pop out of the inside pocket of his expensive suit. He unwrapped it and then popped it in his mouth.
Cas moved his hand to his knee and pulled his leg up, spreading himself even more.
Dean nodded in the dark.  “Three months back Sam and I caught a lead on Alistair and his gang from another lowlife we’d pinched.  Bobby told us to wait for him and he’d bring backup, but I - well I couldn’t wait, Cas.  Not with the chance of finally catching him.  God I was stupid.”
“Whiskey,” Cas said, “neat.”
Dean ran his hands down Cas’s chest, under his arms and around to his shoulders, pulling him in.  He snuck a hand up into Cas’s hair and pulled his head back, mouthing over his collarbone.  He looked at Cas’s flushed cheeks, his heaving chest and his dark hair in the moonlight.
Dean smiled at the remembered conversation.  He was still worried about Cas, but he’d packed enough weapons and ammo to take down a small army, raiding Bobby’s supply.  They were about a day out from Fort Garland, and so far the summer weather was holding out for them.  Cas was a better rider than Dean had expected.  He and his palomino, Grace, seemed to have an instant connection.  Astride his own mount, a beautiful black thoroughbred mare named Baby, Dean struggled to get himself into a position that took pressure off his leg but didn’t put it onto his ass which was unaccustomed to riding after the bed rest.

“Ugh - Daaad, don’t!”
“Nah, I’m okay, Sammy.  We’ll just consider it payback for that time I accidentally knocked out your baby teeth.”
“What if we destroy the dam up river and flood the bed?” Cas asked.  “With help, we could flank Alistair and drive them into the canyon,” he continued.  “We could position sharpshooters around the rim of the canyon here - and here,” Cas said touching areas on the map, “and there’d be no escape,” Cas finished.
Dean turned away from Cas.  He snagged his discarded pants with a toe and drug them close enough to grab.  He busied himself with struggling to get his pants on.
The moment Dean closed the door, Cas was on him.  Their lips met and Cas crowded Dean up against the back of his own front door.  Dean had no idea why that was so fucking hot, but his blood rushed south so fast he felt dizzy.
Dean didn’t realize he’d unconsciously moved closer to Cas as he was speaking. They were only a few inches apart. Dean’s right arm was stretched across the back of the seat and it would be the easiest thing in the world to cup Cas’s face in his palm and pull him in.
Castiel shivered despite Dean’s body heat at his back.  Dean stirred at that and tightened his arm around Castiel’s waist.  Dean nuzzled the back of his neck.  He couldn’t help moving closer, stretching his neck to give Dean access.  “Cas,” Dean murmured into the space behind his ear.  Dean moved his hand from Castiel’s waist to his hip.  Castiel gasped when he felt Dean hard and moving against him.  He arched his back, pushing his backside more fully against Dean.  Dean moaned.  Castiel turned in Dean’s arms to face him; he wanted Dean to be awake for this.  He brought his hand to Dean’s neck and stroked his thumb over Dean’s cheekbone.
Cas put his hands up in a placating gesture.  “Dean, what’s wrong?” he asked.  He had removed the wings and draped that awful trenchcoat he favored over himself but it wasn’t tied and Dean could still see the shimmer of the gold shorts in the darkness.
Dean passed the items over and watched while Meg pulled Cas’s arm out, shook salt over the inside of one of his wrists, downed the shot, licked the salt off of Cas’s wrist, and then sucked the lime between her cupid’s bow lips.
Cas crushed his mouth to Dean’s, silencing him with a hungry kiss.  Dean moaned and melted into it, parting his lips for Cas’s tongue.
“Hello, Dean,” a deep voice very close to him said. Dean missed the shot by a mile.
*****
“About two months - off and on.” Dean answered, holding Ben’s gaze.
Afterwards, Dean lay on his side facing Cas.  He ran his hand up and down Cas’s side from his shoulder to his hip and back up again.  His skin was so soft after the bath, Dean couldn’t stop touching him.  He trailed his fingertips up to Cas’s cheekbone and down the bridge of his nose, to his lips and down his chin.  Cas breathed softly.  Dean knew Cas’d be drifting off to sleep soon and he also knew he needed to leave before he fell asleep himself.  But he didn’t want to go.  Dean rolled onto his back and threw an arm behind his head; he couldn’t stop thinking about what the next few days would bring.
Cas ground against Dean’s leg and snuck a hand into his front pocket.  Long, nimble fingers sought their prize and grazed against Dean’s cock through the soft cotton.  Dean moaned into Cas’s skin.  Cas withdrew the keys with one hand.
“Is that why he was so nice to me?” Ben asked quietly.
*****
“This town needs you, Cas.  We need you, Cas.  I need you, Cas,” Dean continued his voice breaking.  He fell to his knees and cried, covering his face in his hands.
Cas leaned back as if he’d been slapped.  “Us?” he asked.
*****
“Is that not, traditional?”
Cas laughed so loud and so hard that it gave Dean the giggles, too. They climbed into Baby, laughter-induced tears streaming down their cheeks and drove to Sam’s.
Jess released Cas.
“This is bullshit,” he said, waving the card back and forth.
“Thank you, sir,” he said pouring himself a whiskey - neat.
*****
Year:  1873
“‘M fine, Sammy.”  Dean interrupted. “Can’t get rid of me that easy.”  He winced and curled in on himself as pain throbbed up his leg.  His memory returned with a flash - the wagon wheel crushing down - the sound of his bone snapping - Alistair’s smirk.  He turned his face to the side and vomited.  Luckily Sam was there just in time with a bucket.  When he turned back, Whiskey Voice was tourniquetting his right arm and injecting something into his vein.
“Hey Sam - someone’s at the door!” Dean hollered.
“Good job, Doc,” said Bobby.
“Bitch,” Dean retorted.  He slowed his pace.  “Cas is -” Dean started, “...different.”
“Riding a cowboy. Or being ridden by one,” he added, his eyebrow quirking up.
Dean huffed a laugh into Cas’s hair. “It’s a deal, Cas.”
“You’re just lucky I don’t hold you down and tickle you until you pee like I used to do to Sammy.”
“O camerado close! O you and me at last, and us two only.
“Yeah,” Dean said.
*****
Dean reached Cas’s room and twisted the doorknob.  To his surprise, he found it open.  Damn it, he’d have to warn Cas about that.  You couldn’t trust people.  Dean crept toward the bed and the prone figure on it.  Before he knew what hit him, someone had pinned both his arms behind his back and there was a knife at his throat.
“TWO MONTHS?” Ben shouted. Dean winced at his tone.
“I love him, Ben,” Dean said and heard Sam’s sharp inhale as Ben turned to face him. Dean put his hand on his son’s shoulder. “I haven’t loved anyone but you and Sam and Jess for so long, not since your mother-” he found he couldn’t finish the sentence.
Camerado, I give you my hand!
“I musta been maybe 8 - 9 when the men first started comin’ around,” he continued, “trying to get my Pa to sell.”  Dean smiled wryly.  “But Pa was as stubborn as a damned mule.  We had worked that land, he said, and we shouldn’t have to give it up because some bigshot in New York decided to lay track through it.”  Dean took a deep breath. “When they couldn’t buy us out, they started to threaten.  They killed our dog - left him on the porch for little Sammy to find.”  Dean shook his head.  “Bastards.  And then - then they sent him.”
Dean shook his head. Goddamn it. “Yeah, next time, I’m finally going to beat you.”
Dean moaned and threaded his right hand through Castiel’s hair as Castiel mapped his mouth with his tongue.  Castiel let him pull his head back slightly, both men panting.
Sam sighed.
As he entered the studio space, he noted the beautiful hardwood floor and mirrored wall. Notably absent was and Jess’s maid of honor who he had yet to meet. He had to admit curiosity was getting to him. Dean thought about the few things he knew about her - he knew her name was Cas, which he assumed was short for Cassie or Cassandra, and that she was an accountant who had helped Jess found her own non-profit legal defense organization.
The ball hit Dean square in the face and snapped him out of his wallowing.  He fell to his ass, disoriented and feeling liquid leaking out of his nose.
“What can I say, Cas?  Vengeance is hungry work,” Dean finished, his voice moving from jovial to dire in a single sentence.
Dean shifted his weight from foot to foot.  He straightened his bow tie for the millionth time.  He kicked at the wildflowers and prairie grass that blanketed the meadow.  Sam elbowed him.
“May I?” he asked Cas. Cas nodded, once. Dean took Cas’s hand and spun him around then pulled him close, hands on his hips. He swayed his hips to the music and ground into Cas letting him feel how Cas’s outfit was affecting him. Dean felt Cas let out a breath and he tipped his head back on to Dean’s shoulder. Dean rubbed his cheek along Cas’s neck and breathed him in. Jesus, he smelled good, thought Dean.
All the fight flew out of Dean to see Ben’s defeated expression. He put an arm around Ben’s shoulders and looked at Novak who had pulled over another chair and sat down next to Ben.
Dean handed Castiel his crutch so he could lean against the counter, freeing his hands.  He tore the envelope open with shaking hands.  He looked at Castiel.  “They found him, Cas.” Dean said, his voice low.  He handed the telegram to Castiel.
Ben stayed after school for debate team and Dean had a rare afternoon off.  He came home to find Cas standing in the kitchen in only his boxers.
Warning for descriptions of violence.
*****
He swallowed once and Cas had his hands under his arms and was hauling him to his feet. Cas’s lips met his in a sloppy kiss. He wiped one hand over his still leaking cock and then gripped Dean, stroking him hard and fast and just the way he knew Dean loved it.
Dean’s head spun but the man made him watch as Alistair tied his mother to her rocking chair, her eyes wild and calling for her boys.  Alistair took a torch to the curtains she had made, to the cabin walls, and finally to the hem of her dress.  Alistair stepped through the doorway of Dean’s home and closed the door on his mother.  Dean heard his mother’s screams and Sam’s cries and the crackling sound of the fire consuming his childhood.
Castiel swallowed.  “I don’t condone violence, Dean.”  Castiel’s hands began to shake.  He clasped them behind his back.  “But if you are healed enough, I won’t stop you,” he finished.
“Administrative leadership conference at this lovely establishment. And to think, I wasn’t going to come!” Milton said. “Oh, this is too good,” he added. “You are SO fired,” Milton laughed mirthlessly. “I can finally get you out of my school.” He stepped back and before Dean knew what was happening had snapped a picture of them with his cell phone and walked away.
Dean collapsed next to Cas and pulled him into his chest.
Castiel sat and watched Dean eat.  It was disgusting.  Thankfully, the inappropriate noises Dean made when eating pie were interrupted by the door bells jangling.
“Yes - Meg.” Dean spat her name out like the very taste of it in his mouth was too bitter.
“Honey?” asked Jess, reaching for the small bear-shaped squeeze bottle.
Dean sat back like Cas’s words had a physical impact.
Castiel raised an eyebrow and fixed Dean with a look, “You’re a gentleman?” he asked.
“You didn’t drive here?” Dean asked.
Chapter 7:  Glitter and Gold
Cas nodded. “Dick Roman lives a very lavish lifestyle, a little too lavish for a district judge’s public servant salary,” he continued. “We think he’s taking money under-the-table from the for-profit prison lobby. They want more people, especially young healthy people, incarcerated for longer and longer sentences so that they can profit off of their labor.”
“Fuck, Cas, you feel so good, baby, so good.”
I am become Death and I am damned for all eternity.”
“Dean Winchester.  Don’t be an ass.  That was the hottest thing I’ve ever seen.”
“I stopped sleeping,” Cas continued. “I stopped eating. I got really low and I - well I took some pills,” he said.
“Sorry,” Dean mumbled, looking away and shoving both hands back into the water.
“We’re gonna get him.  It’s a good plan.”
“Calm down?! Why didn’t you call me earlier?”
Sam looked at Bobby.  “You can stay with me, kid,” he said.  “That way we both can check on your brother and give Doc here some relief.”
Dean nodded, his green eyes turned to steel.  “Alright, but I’m gonna hold you to that.”  He looked at Castiel.  “Doc?” he asked.
“Nothing, I just - well I never thought Gabriel would be our ‘knight in shining assless chaps,’” he said.
“Me either, man,” Dean said.
Cas rolled his eyes so hard Dean swore he heard it.  “I doubt that very much, Dean.”
Cas lowered his voice and hissed, “Because is not a reason, Dean.”
“Cas - we need to-”  Cas silenced him with a gesture.
Castiel yawned in sympathy and felt sleep start to tug at him.  “Yes, Dean, it was.” he said.  “Go to sleep, Dean.”
“Alright, alright,” he replied.  “Let’s find a place to make camp.”
“For the bride,” Dean whisper-hissed.  “Last time I checked, you weren’t no virgin bride.”
“Not ready to come, yet,” he said breathlessly.  “Besides, I kinda wanna return the favor.” Dean grabbed Cas’s elbow and flipped him onto his back, kissing him thoroughly.
*****
*****
The music changed and Dean was surprised to hear a slower song. Cas spun in Dean’s arms and clasped his hands behind Dean’s neck. Dean pressed the flat of one palm to Cas’s back and ran tips of his fingers up to the spot between Cas’s shoulder blades that he knew from experience was a sensitive area. He watched Cas’s pupils dilate and felt his chest heave. Dean pulled him even closer and pushed his thigh between Cas’s, letting him grind against him. Cas snuck one hand up and scratched his blunt nails through the short hair at the base of Dean’s skull.
“He needs space, Dean.”
Dean's furnace goes out.  To save up for a replacement, he picks up a shift bartending at a gay bar.  On Halloween.  One of the "performers" captures Dean's interest.
Dean heaved a huge sigh and let himself fall back onto the bed in his and Cas’s hotel room. After all the months preparing, Sam and Jess’s wedding day went by in a flash. Thankfully everything went off without a hitch, even the ridiculous choreographed wedding party dance, which he had to admit was worth it since it brought him and Cas together. Dean had even managed to grab a few moments alone with Sam to tell him how proud of him he was. But with the flurry of activity and the emotional rollercoaster the day had been, he was exhausted.
“Deaaaan -” Cas moaned his name.
Dean looked at Cas.  “Really, you do a Christmas-themed show?”
“Huh. That’s funny, Dean, I seem to remember someone promising me I got to pick the next date after you drug me to that god-awful WWF show.”
“I don’t mind,” Dean said.
“Dean, c’mon, I know you don’t d-”
Here's the happy ending, folks.  Thanks for reading!
Dean pushed the button on his stereo.  He watched as Cas tilted his head, probably trying to place the song.
He met Cas’s eyes and blew gently on the tip of his cock.
Cas rolled his eyes and looked at Dean. “It goes with the outfit, Dean,” he said. “You don’t like it?”
“You want to talk about it?” Sam asked.
“You want to know what to tell Ben,” he stated.
“Son of a Bitch!” Dean yelled.  Castiel released his grip on Dean’s shoulder.
Dean nodded.
“Alright, Dean,” Cas said. “Thank you.”
Dean is annoying.  Castiel loses his patience with his patient.  Smut happens.
“I don’t tell anyone about this,” Dean finished.
Cas blushed.  “I’m not in the habit of spontaneous encounters.”
Dean turned to glare at his brother.  “Not gonna happen, Sam.”
Dean cut him off.  “No man - you were fine.  Better than fine, actually,” he said, smirking.
Sam sat up, surprise written all over his face.  “Wow,” he said.
“Hard work ain’t gonna kill me, Sam.”
“Oh I was mighty ‘interested,’ but I’m a gentleman, Cas.  I didn’t wanna take advantage.”
“Oh no you don’t,” Dean threw his napkin on the table and stood.  “Don’t you dare use Ben as an excuse to get out of this.  If you don’t want to be with me, that’s fine, but be a man and say it.”
Cas paused and cleared his throat.  He flipped to an entry toward the back of the journal.
“Ben, son, you don’t have to admit to something just because -” Dean started.
He saw Cas’s lip quirk slightly and knew he was in for a long, but great night.
Dean slipped a hand behind Cas’s back and pulled him flush, his hand on Cas’s ass.  He kissed Cas slowly, tasting him and stealing the breath from his lungs.  Cas pushed at Dean’s jacket and he pulled back, shrugging it off and flinging it away from them.  Cas pulled at the hem of Dean’s t-shirt, stripping it off his torso but leaving it around his wrists.  He twisted the t-shirt until Dean’s hands were bound.  Then he pushed Dean back until he felt the bed behind his legs.  Cas shoved lightly at Dean’s shoulders and Dean let his body fall back, his bound hands extended and stretched above his head.
They must have fallen asleep after that, he thought.  Cas had pulled the wool blanket he kept in the back seat over them at some point.  Damn it, he thought.  What the fuck was he gonna do now?
Dean waved his hand. “Nah, it’s okay, man. That guy is freaky good at pool. It’s unnatural,” he said, shaking his head.
*****
“The ring, Dean,” Sam said and handed him the simple gold band.
“Much obliged,” Dean answered, “but we’re not allowed to drink when on duty.”
“You won’t fuck this up for Ben.” Cas said.

“To moonlighting,” Cas said.
He felt Cas’s hand in his hair. He sucked Cas down taking all of him in and relaxing his throat. Dean reached a hand up to encourage Cas to grip his hair.
“Because!” Dean shouted leaning toward Cas.
“You know,” Cas said, peppering kisses over Dean’s neck and chest, “everyone in that bar was staring at yours all night.  These jeans are indecent,” he finished, getting his hand around Dean’s cock and stroking.
“You have a great ass,” he said, kneading Cas’s cheeks as he popped the fly on Dean’s jeans.
Dean moved to help Cas up from the chair.  Cas immediately shoved his mouth to Dean’s.
Dean mixed the disgusting appletini, garnished with a green apple-flavored lollipop the way Gabriel insisted it be served.  Dean handed it over and Gabriel left him with a wink.  Dean turned to his right to serve the next customer and it was Cas and his dance partner.  And holy shit ‘The Demon’ was Meg from Thanksgiving.
“Oh Sugar,” she purred, taking note of Dean in his t-shirt with more than a cursory glance. “Call me Peg.”
He worked Cas over, tasting and sucking at his cock, licking the underside and watching to see what got the most response out of Cas.  When he gripped Cas and focused his attentions on sucking the rest of his cock as hard as he could, hollowing his cheeks, Cas’s eyes rolled back in his head and Dean felt his grip tighten on the back of his neck.  He felt Cas’s balls start to tighten in his other hand and he pulled off abruptly.
“Just about!” Dean answered.  “Hey can you grab the extra whipped cream?  Sam never buys enough.”
Chapter 3
“If we’re going to do this, I wanna do it right.”
Cas nodded.  He fixed Dean with a look.
“I did it,” Ben said again, looking up at Dean. “I cheated, okay?!” he yelled.
“Dean - look,” Sam said.
Dean takes Cas home.  Smut ensues.  Warning for all the smut and language. This is mostly doin' it folks, so you can skip it if you don't like that sort of thaang.
*****
“All the books?” Cas asked, his voice betraying his surprise.
Dean groaned.  “Yeah…”
Cas’s eyes snapped to Dean.  His mild expression darkened into something less pleasant behind the Anderson’s backs as they walked away.
It all came down to this: one last shot. If Dean sunk the 8 ball, he’d not only win bragging rights over having finally beat Ash, hands down the best pool player he’d ever met, he’d also win free drinks for their whole group. As their night out had turned into a bit of a wedding party meet up, Dean was pretty motivated to save some cash.
Last official chapter here, but as promised there's a fun epilogue coming.  Wait for iiiiiiit...
Dean stroked him, root to tip, the coating Cas with the lotion.
Dean put his hands on Cas’s shoulders and pushed him back gently.
Castiel got up and looked back down at the scene unfolding in the canyon.  Alistar and his man pointed their guns at Dean who in turn kept his trained on Alistair.  It was hopeless.  If Dean shot Alistair, his man would not hesitate to shoot Dean.  Castiel could imagine Dean wrestling with the choice to sacrifice himself.  He knew what Dean would do.
“C’mon, fellas,” he said, “let’s chat outside,” his voice gentle. Cas threw Dean a look, but he didn’t even have to make eye contact to know this quiet stoic demeanor was out of character for Gabriel.
Oh shit, Dean thought. He knew those eyes - he’d last seen them glare at him a few weeks ago when he’d been late to pick up Ben. It was Novak - Ben’s teacher. Castiel Novak was wearing considerably less than his normal ugly sweater vests and ill-fitting suits. Of course this guy moonlights as a bee stripper, thought Dean. Fuck my life, his mind added unhelpfully.
He stepped toward Ben, willing him to understand.  Ben stepped back and turned away.
*****
He lost track of time and then he felt Cas tug at the hair near the nape of his neck.  He lifted his head from where he’d been panting against Cas’s shoulder.  He met Cas’s eyes.
“And Gabriel is your - ?”
“Ben, son -” Dean started
“Yeah?” Dean asked.
Cas ground against Dean as the music played. Damn the guy must have muscles Dean hadn’t even heard of to get his torso to move like that. He felt so good, Dean buried his nose and face in Cas’s neck, breathing him in. He smelled, honest to God, like honeysuckle. Well - like clean man sweat and honeysuckle - but it worked for Dean and he growled into the space between Cas’s neck and shoulder and pulled him closer, grinding against him. Cas gasped and threw his head back.
Dean knew when he was beat.
Dean held Cas as he sobbed, letting him grieve finally for his lost love.
Castiel inhaled.  He dropped the journal.  “No,” he exhaled and grabbed Dean’s face between his hands.  He crashed his mouth into Dean’s, parting his lips to lick and nip along Dean’s mouth.  Dean gasped and Castiel wasted no time in shoving his tongue in to get a taste of this annoying, beautiful, tempting man.
“Yes,” was all Cas said.
Cas was not a considerate sleeper.  He hogged the blanket, snored, and flailed about randomly, talking in his sleep.  But Dean hadn’t woken up with someone in a long time, and couldn’t help smiling when he realized his sheets were covered in glitter and were going to smell like honeysuckle.  He snuck out of bed and padded barefoot to the kitchen.
Dean sighed and put his cue away and turned back to Cas.
Sam smiled, the asshole.  “That-that makes a lot of sense.”
In the meantime, he and Cas settled into a bit of a routine.  They started eating breakfast at Harvelle’s and checking for word from Bobby and Sam.  They walked a bit after that before Cas went on his rounds - as much as Dean could handle.  And he got stronger.  He started trying to clean up his space and he read every book Cas had.  Dean’s favorite part of the day was evening, after dinner, when he and Cas would play cards or read and drink a whiskey in front of the fire.  He especially loved the nights when Cas would drink a few too many and Dean would have to help him to the stairs.  Cas just looked so vulnerable those nights and all Dean wanted to do was take him in his arms and hold him.
“Water.  Drink,” Novak commanded, raising a cup to his lips.
Dean was dreading Ben’s parent-teacher conference this week.  He hadn’t seen Cas since Halloween.  But he got an earful about how wonderful Cas was from Ben every night or sometimes the next morning over breakfast if Dean pulled a double.  In the two weeks since, he’d been so busy with work hadn’t been able to pick Ben up from school.  Instead Ben took the bus home or took the bus to Sam and Jess’s while Dean went right from Bobby’s to The Roadhouse.  The good news was he’d scraped up enough to get the new furnace installed and even had several months of payments saved up.  The bad news was he was exhausted and plagued by guilt over not having time with Ben and the way things had played out with Cas.
Dean screamed.  And then someone was shaking the living daylights out of him.
“Yeah?”
Cas looked at him for a moment. He really wanted him to say yes, but he knew better than to expect anything and planned on being a perfect gentleman. He just wanted to help Cas out, that’s all, he told himself.
A woman with a bright auburn beehive wearing a long, flowing leopard print blouse over a low-cut black tank top emerged from around the corner. Despite the wrinkles at the corners of her eyes, Dean’s gaze tracked down over very long legs in very tight leggings, more out of curiosity than interest, to the tips of her toes painted the brightest red he’d ever seen and shoved into delicate, heeled sandals, which were covered in rhinestones. She had to be in her mid-sixties, thought Dean, taking in her tanned skin and impressive cleavage on display. Okay, maybe he was checking her out a bit.
Dean shifted to stand up again, leaning on his crutch.  “Anyways...how about we head down to Harvelle’s for some grub?  You two look like you could use a good meal.”
Dean moved to him and took Cas’s hands in his.  “Cas - you saved me.  More than that you probably saved this whole damned wicked town by taking that bastard out.  He wasn’t going to stop doing what he done to our family, Cas.  Think about how many families you saved from my fate.”  He swallowed past the lump in his throat, “I love you, Cas.”
“Fine,” Dean said. “But the maid of honor better be hot, at least.”
Dean groaned, pulled out slowly and then pushed back in, just as slowly.  “My God, Cas, you feel amazing,” he growled, working into slow rhythm that left them both breathless.  Castiel arched his back and wrapped his legs around Dean’s waist, pushing his heel into his ass, urging Dean to go faster.
He grabbed a rag and started polishing the already-clean surface of the bar harder than was necessary.  When he looked up, Gabriel had somehow materialized right in front of him.
Dean hummed around Cas’s cock and bobbed his head faster. He reached down and started stroking himself.
Dean and Cas talk it out over coffee and something Dean thinks is called "combo-chai" but is actually kombucha. Cas explains himself. Later, Dean insists Cas come over for private dance practice (wink, wink).
Meg chose that moment to saunter into the kitchen.  She moved between them and wrapped both hands around Cas’s arm.  “Hey handsome, you gotta come sit with me and keep me company during the game.”
Castiel felt himself sway, the adrenaline rush of emergency surgery leaving him utterly drained.
Dean just nodded. He reached for the bottle of whiskey to pour himself another. The whiskey was burning warm in his stomach and he didn’t feel like stopping.
Dean waited until Cas looked down and met his gaze. Then he ran his hands up Cas’s thighs and pushed the skirt up. He drew in a sharp breath. He wasn’t prepared for what greeted him. Cas was wearing white lace panties with a tiny blue bow at the top. Panties that were stretched obscenely over his hard cock.
*****
He felt Cas suck in a breath.
*****
Cas scrambled to unbuckle Dean’s belt and shoved his pants and boxers down in a single move. He pushed Dean hard and with his goddamn pants around his ankles, he fell back on his ass on the bed.
“So.  When do I get off house arrest Doc-er-Cas?” Dean asked.
Novak - Cas pushed his glass over - indicating he’d like one.
“Cas - stay.  Please, stay,” he heard himself beg.
Castiel sighed happily.  He glanced down at Dean.  He was so hard it looked painful.  Castiel wiped his seed off his belly and reached down to stroke Dean.  Dean shivered as Castiel coated him and pulled him between his legs, positioning him.  He pushed into Castiel slowly.  Despite his post-orgasm relaxation and the preparation, it burned and stretched and felt almost too-much.  But then Castiel looked at Dean’s face.  He would later swear Dean’s face was radiant at that moment, shining and glorious.  Dean bottomed out with a sigh.  He leaned down to kiss Castiel, open-mouthed, tongue demanding.
“What?! No -” Dean started but Cas was already opening the door and getting out of the car.  “Cas!  Cas!” Dean yelled as he stormed off with Dean’s blanket.  “You forgot your antennae,” he finished weakly.
He could tell there was news waiting for them by the look on the clerk’s face.  Dean read it too the moment he stepped through the doorway.  Castiel swallowed past the lump in his throat.  “Well?” Dean asked the clerk, making his way to the counter.
Dean moaned into Cas’s mouth.  God it had been so long since someone else had touched him like this.  He pulled at Cas’s shorts, slipping his hands inside of them and running them to the front to tug them down.  He needed to feel Cas’s dick next to his like ten minutes ago.
“Ung, Dean,” Cas moaned and came.
“Oh thank God,” said the tall man, his eyes sweeping over Castiel.
Sam stopped to look at Dean.  “Oh oh.”  His eyes went soft and he smirked.
Dean nodded.  He wiped the back of his hand across his face.  He looked down again.  Dean could count on one hand the number of people outside of Sam and Bobby who he’d told about his past.
“How, Dean?  How can you love me?  I’m a monster.  What if I hurt you too, Dean?”
“Who’s next?” Dean asked, shouting over the noise of the crowd, his curiosity getting the best of him.
Dean turned his head and whispered low in Cas’s ear, “C’mon Cas, he’s out - let’s go to bed,” he finished nibbling at Cas’s ear lobe.
“Yeah, yeah, I know.” Dean sighed.  “Not that you’re not great company and all, but a fella used to the open range could lose his mind staring at these four walls.”
“And then you’re coming back here,” Cas said. It wasn’t a question.
“Fine,” Dean said, pouting.  He knew that the warrant would require proof of death they’d be unable to attain if Alistair and crew were in tiny pieces. But oh how he wanted to forego the constraints of the law on this one.
Dean turned back to Cas but he could hear women’s squeals of delight from whatever corner Chelsea had dragged Jess and Sam over to.
Just then Dean heard the office door open. Who the hell would walk into this, he wondered. He turned toward the intruder ready to glare him down for interrupting.
She danced around Cas, their bodies intertwining in some crazy parody of couples’ yoga.  As she moved she tore pieces of Cas’s costume away until he was left in only gold lamé shorts.  Finally she ripped the halo from Cas’s head and pushed him down onto his back.  He lay down on the stage and the song ended with one of her stiletto booted feet on Cas’s chest.  Dean felt his cheeks heat up.  He noticed Cas’s heaving chest and the intense stare between the two dancers.  The crowd roared.  Dean saw the woman pull Cas to his feet but he turned away before they could take their bows.
Castiel lost himself in the feeling of kissing and rutting against Dean.  He didn’t notice Dean had been trying to get his attention until he felt a yank at the back of his hair.  Castiel allowed Dean to pull his head up from where he’d been sucking his neck and glared at him.  “What?!” he demanded.
Dean couldn’t help the laughter that welled up out of him. He pulled Cas in for one more kiss and hug.
“Jess found me. She got me help and she even transferred to U of C with me, where I could get financial aid and work to afford tuition,” Cas said. “When she said she wanted to go to law school, I couldn't imagine not living in the same city. My brother - Gabriel - he lived out in California, so it made sense to follow her to Stanford. And well, Gabriel got so used to us cleaning his place when we visited, he said he couldn’t possibly allow us to move out of state without him,” Cas smiled. “She and Gabriel are my family. And I would do anything for them,” he finished.
The runner stood, covered in mud from where he’d leapt into the ditch in order to avoid becoming road kill. He glared at Dean. If eyes could throw daggers, Dean would be pinned against Baby’s door. Dean sighed. Other than being extremely angry and dirty, he didn’t appear to be hurt. “Sorry!” Dean yelled through the glass and gave his best sheepish look. The man pulled himself up, flipped Dean off, and turned and ran back into the woods, his black and yellow running gear giving Dean the impression of a very pissed off bumble bee, buzzing off indignantly.
“I’m all in, if you are,” Dean said.
Castiel inched slowly toward the doorway leading from what served as his operating/examination room to his tiny front room.  If they didn’t know he was here, he might maintain the element of surprise, he thought.  Two - no three - no two - sets of boots scraped and scuffed along his floor.  Castiel gripped the scalpel tighter.
“Damn, Cas,” Dean said. “Looks like I finally got a rise out of you.” He winked lasciviously and nodded at the front of Castiel’s trousers.
Dean shook his head. “Thanks buddy, but don’t worry about it. I’m doing okay. Been getting lots of tips at the Roadhouse,” he lied smoothly. He ruffled Ben’s hair like he did when he was little.
It was one of those nights when Cas broke.  He must’ve had a tough day because he drank more than usual, which was a considerable amount.  As he drained the rest of the bottle they’d been sharing, he swore and threw it onto the stone of the fireplace, shattering it into a hundred pieces.
“Have a seat,” Cas said gesturing to the chair opposite his desk.  Dean sat down and cleared his throat.
“Cas - don’t get me wrong, man,” Dean started, “I want to.” Dean looked at Cas’s lips, ripe and full.  “I really, really want to, but I-”
“Mmmm?”
“Damn, Cas, that was about the best thing I’ve ever seen,” he said.
Dean thought as he read the business card Sam handed him with the name and address of a dance studio on the southwest side of Kansas City. He looked up at Sam.
“What this? I’ve had it for a while. I went a little overboard on my Green Day enthusiasm in high school. In addition to Britney, might have had a thing for Billie Joe.”
He reached out and pulled Castiel back to his chest.  “I’m just getting comfortable,” Dean said.
Dean entered the office and treated the receptionist to his most charming grin. “Betty!” Dean purred, “Did you do something to your hair? Looking good!”
, okay? And you want me to - what, get my Kevin Bacon on?”
“Dean,” he said.
“Cas, are you wearing body glitter?!”
Doctor Castiel Novak was a man whose daily life was bounded by self-imposed routines.  The unruly town of Dodge City, Kansas grew by the minute and was the last stop before homesteaders headed further west to try to claim their 40 acres.  Castiel felt his routines helped contain some of the daily chaos of life on the frontier.
“Please, please Cas-” Dean heard himself beg. “Let me touch you.”
He licked a stripe up the length of him and then took the tip in his mouth. He sucked at the spot just under the head of Cas’s cock where he knew he was sensitive. Dean used one hand to stroke Cas while fondling his balls with his other. He concentrated on how hard Cas was and the noises Cas was making. God he could probably come just listening to Cas moan, he thought.
Cas nodded.  “I see,” he said, and Dean could tell he was trying for serious but he slurred his words and let his body fall limply against Dean’s.
I give you myself before preaching or law;
“I’d like to see you try, old man,” Ben said, setting his can down and already turning to run.
“You bring him in here accusing him of cheating and scare the crap out of the poor kid-” Dean was in full righteous tirade mode.
Dean took it and turned to Cas, sliding the ring onto his finger.  He gulped.  He’d spent hours writing and memorizing his vows.  He forgot everything the minute he locked eyes with Cas.
He tried to be patient, he really did.  But one night Dean finally snapped.  After one of Cas’s iterations of “Go away, Dean,” he got right in Cas’s face.
“Nonsense! Utter bullshit!” Gabriel said with mock indignation. He called over his shoulder “Chuck - hefe - hoss - GOD! - Paging GOD! - get your ass over here!”
Dean glanced down at his watch. He was running late, of course. He put his foot down on Baby’s pedal, letting her open up a bit on the highway before he got to the turn off for Ben’s school. He cranked up the AC/DC tape and sang along, loudly, not giving a damn and stealing 30 seconds for himself before facing the inevitable.
“What the hell are you doing here?” Dean roared.
“C’mon, Cas, I think given the situation the Hippocratic Oath is more of a suggestion, right?  I mean you shouldn’t set yourself up for harm, right?  Dean cajoled.
“No,” Dean said, a single tear slipping from his eye.  “He saved my life, Sam,” he said.  “He saved my life and it cost him his soul,” Dean finished.
*****
“What?!”
*****
Dean had no idea how he’d let Cas talk him into this.  He felt like an ass as he tugged on the hem of his kilt and walked up the steps to the sorority house.  Sure the Delta-Delta-Delta’s spring party was the “social event of the season” as Cas had said but did it have to include a “twist” this year?  Dean recalled how Cas had casually informed him they’d be going and that Dean would have to meet him there because Cas wouldn’t have time to come home after his Thursday night poetry workshop.
Instead of an answer, Dean heard the door open and shut. He lifted his head off the pillow and then sat up so fast his head spun.
“Yeah - hold your horses!”
“I’m sorry, Dean,” he said.
“Well, I can give you a ride,” Dean offered.
“Mph.  You should be so lucky,” Cas murmured into his armpit.
*****
“Dean--this is how you ended up like this, remember?” Sam asked, gesturing at Dean’s bad leg, propped up on an empty chair near him.  Dean could hear the exasperation in his voice.
“Dean you’re bleeding,” Sam sounded anxious.
“Then what?!” Cas demanded.
“Don’t worry,” Cas said and put a hand over one of Jess’s. “This is a pattern, and Judge Roman is not being particularly subtle about showing off what he’s purchased with the bribes. We’ll get the bastard,” Cas finished with a glint in his eye.
Ben’s shoulders shook. He looked up and met Dean’s eyes before looking back down. “I saw the bills, Dad,” he said, his voice barely audible.
An hour later Castiel emerged from the back room completely drained.  His patient was stable.  The tall man read the exhaustion on Castiel’s features, a worried expression crossing his face.  “He’s stable.” Castiel said and made for a chair across from the settee with the intent of throwing himself in it.  Before he could do so, however, the found himself wrapped up in the tall man’s embrace.
, Dean added in his head), and had just accepted an associate professor position in legal studies at KU.
More coming soon!  I'm having way too much fun writing Gabriel.
I give you my love more precious than money,
Cas grunted in response. “None taken.” He paused for a moment and then continued. “I do.”
“Maybe next time, you can wear the bowtie,” Cas added.
A few minutes later, Milton’s door opened. Dean caught a glimpse of his face; it was paler than he’d ever seen it. Milton met his eyes briefly and looked away just as quickly, stepping aside to let Gabriel pass through and then he closed the door.
What I do is less doctoring and more butchery.  I’ve amputated more limbs from young men than I can count.  Sometimes they survive; often they do not.
“Now, Mr. Winchester,” Principal Milton said, “if you’ll just calm down-”
“NOOOOOO!” he wailed.  Alistair turned toward him.
“Cas - I’m fading fast, man, think you can speed things up?” he yelled.
“I don’t want to push you, Dean, but I haven’t been able to think about much else since Halloween.”
“Ah, be right back,” Sam said, following his fiancee with a look of grim determination on his face.
Dean huffed.  “She’s interested in being more than your dance partner.”
“Cas,” he said, gripping and shaking him by the shoulders.  Cas did not look at Dean or respond.  Dean felt his pulse and ran his hands over him to check for any wounds he couldn’t see.  Nothing.  Cas was breathing; he appeared uninjured but he was just - gone somehow.  Dean felt panic well up in his chest.  He pulled Cas onto his lap and cradled him in his arms.  Dean could feel Cas’s heart beating; he could feel him breathe, but his Cas, the Cas he loved, was locked away somewhere inside himself.  Cas lay there limply, seemingly unaware of Dean holding him.
“No, but ah, well I was wondering if Cas could maybe come - live with you and Ben?  Just for a couple of weeks,” Gabriel added.
They didn’t talk much on the way to Cas’s place. Cas gave the occasional direction, but Dean had been driving long before he was old enough to do so legally and knew his way around both Lawrence and Kansas City. It was nice, just having Cas sitting next to him in the passenger seat. Like a fan that helps block out the road noise on summer nights, he found Cas’s presence soothing.
“Yeah,” Dean said, “something else is getting stronger too.” He pushed his leg between Castiel’s, and rubbed himself against Castiel’s cock.
I think I could stop here myself and do miracles,
Ben took a deep breath and looked down, the defiance draining out of his face and voice. “I’m so sorry, Dad,” he said quietly and put his face in his hands. “I just wanted to help.”
“Fuck!” Dean yelled and threw his head back against the wall. Cas moved up to his neck and rubbed one hand over Dean’s crotch. Cas licked and ran his teeth over Dean’s throat. Dean threaded one hand through the hair at the back of Cas’s head and pulled him closer, gripping lightly. He laid the other over Cas’s chest, sliding inside his open button up, feeling his heartbeat.
“Castiel.” Dean tried the strange name.  “That’s a mouthful after callin’ ya ‘Doc.’  What about if I call ya ‘Cas?’” he asked.
In response, Cas wrapped his legs around Dean’s waist and squeezed him.
“For making me listen,” Cas answered.  He stood and extended his hand across the desk to Dean.  “Truce?” he asked.
Dean didn’t need to be asked twice.  He cupped Cas’s cheek and drew him in for a hungry, open-mouthed kiss.  He pulled and then pushed at the lapels of that goddamned trench coat.  Cas shook his arms and it fell, pooling on the floor.  Dean nosed at Cas’s neck, breathing him in.  He ran his hands down Cas’s bare chest.  He hadn’t even put his clothes back on and stood before Dean in nothing but the gold shorts and body glitter.  Cas sucked in a gasp as Dean teased at a nipple.  Dean opened his mouth, biting the juncture between Cas’s neck and shoulder and pinched Cas’s nipple at the same time.  Cas threw his head back and moaned at that.
“What the hell is taking so long?!” Dean demanded.
Sam stood to intervene but Dean waved him back.
“That’s it, Cas, c’mon, baby, I got you; I got you.” Cas opened his eyes and met Dean’s once more. “Give it to me, Cas,” Dean said.
“Alistair - he - he chained me up for two days in the sun.  No food, no water.  Just chained there waiting to die.  He decided he’d teach me a lesson by hobbling me.  He had his second in command Hannity hold me down and he...he drove a wagon over my leg,” Dean finished.  He breathed deeply in and out trying to calm down his panic at the memory of being so helpless and broken.  “Alistair was getting ready for more ‘games’ as he called them when Sam and Bobby surrounded us with back up.  Sam’s a damn good shot, Cas.  I knew he’d be able to hit Hannity if I weren’t in the way.  I nodded at him and he knew.  He shot, straight and clean through my shoulder.  He shot that fucker right in the cock,” Dean smiled viciously.  “I kinda passed out after that,” he said, “and I woke up in your office.”
“Well, well, Mr. Winchester isn’t it? And I assume that’s Mr. Novak on the other side of the doorway?”
“Goddamn it, Cas.” Dean swore and surged forward, his hands on either side of Cas’s face, sealing his lips to Cas’s.
Cas dug his fingers into Dean’s shoulders, nipped at his bottom lip, tugging it between his teeth before letting it go.
“No?” asked Bobby.
The next two hours were a blur of making one drink after another and avoiding being groped by the increasingly handsy customers. Finally it was last call. The bar cleared out but Gabriel talked Chuck, the owner, into staying open to serve the performers.
Cas looked down.  “I’m sorry if I took advantage-”
Dammit, what now? he thought to himself. He knew Ben was struggling lately, but couldn’t get the kid to open up and talk about it. Other than the odd playground fight or injury here and there Ben hadn’t had many issues over the years. He’d been thrilled when Sam helped Ben get into the top high school in the city. He’d been less thrilled about the price tag that went along with private school. Even with financial aid, tuition was more than he spent on housing and utilities combined. But he’d been able to bartend weekend nights at The Roadhouse and had saved up enough over the summer to cover Ben’s first semester.
Then there are the long times of waiting between battles.  These are the worst.  The times when all we can do is wait for the horror to come to us.  We play cards and sometimes practice our marksmanship.  I’m actually a good shot.  I can hit a playing card dead center at 100 paces and I’m a fast draw - one of the fastest the soldiers say they’ve seen.  As doctors, we’re rarely in the field, but the sergeant insists that I carry a revolver for those times when I have to help the combat medics retrieve injured men. Sometimes the enemy tries to ambush us when we assess the injured.”
“Harder,” he demanded.
Dean cleared his throat to release some of the tension. He was used to being checked out by both men and women. Although he tended to date women, he’d been openly bisexual since his late teens, and well, the last time someone looked at him like that...it ended up being a very good night for him.
Okay, thought Dean. He supposed it wasn’t that weird, even if Cas had to be in his mid-thirties, like Dean.
“I think it’s time I show you my bed,” Castiel growled against Dean’s throat.  Dean moved toward the stairs so fast he dropped his crutch and ended up half falling onto Castiel.
Dean tells Ben about his relationship with Cas.  It does not go well.
“Yes.”
Dean had no idea how he made it home without crashing Baby.  He parked as quickly as possible and raced around to Cas’s side to open the door for him.  Cas looked down, the blush on his cheeks deepening as he took Dean’s hand, letting Dean pull him out of the car.  They walked hand in hand up to the front steps.  Dean spared a second to worry about what nosy neighbors might think and then decided he didn’t give a damn.
Dean has some fun with Cas while Ben is away at summer camp.  I wrote this because I think we all feel personally victimized by this gif:  http://jensenpositive.tumblr.com/post/150450514525/stardustsam-because-jensen-in-shorts
Gabriel released Chuck and took the drinks from Dean and left him with a wink. Suddenly he seemed more in control of himself than he had a minute ago, Dean thought. “Alright, everybody - maestro - let’s get fucked up!” he yelled at the top of his lungs.
Dean knew Ben was away at summer camp and wouldn’t be back for another week.  But he still double-checked his room and made sure that all the blinds in the house were closed.  He felt like an idiot.
“Yes, Cas.  I’m doing the damn armed circles.  Although I don’t see what that has to do with a goddamned bullet hole.”
“So...we tell Ben - today?” Cas asked.
Dean sucked in a breath. Dammit, he shouldn’t have left them out. He must have forgotten to put them away the other day before he left for the garage. He cleared his throat which felt tight for some reason.
Castiel watched Dean swallow.  “You know how broken I am, Cas,” he said, “and you didn’t run; you waited.  And after last night...well, I reckon you’re a bit broken, too.”
Cas didn’t say anything but he nodded.
“Ooooh, I can’t wait!!” responded a taller man dressed as a black cat.
“So,” Dean started, “what’s the news?  Did you find them?”
Dean fell back into his chair.  He rubbed his hand over his face.  “I know,” he said.  He looked up at Sam, meeting his eyes.  “I don’t want to lose him, Sam, but I don’t know what to do.”
“Mr. Winchester,” Cas said, and walked back through his door, not waiting for Dean.  Dean followed him and tried not to stare at his ass, his brain unhelpfully superimposing the booty shorts over Cas’s sensible navy Dockers.
He smiled to himself and pulled Cas closer to him with the arm he had draped over Cas's shoulders.  They were curled up on Dean’s couch watching Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.  He couldn’t believe Cas hadn’t seen the trilogy, but now that he could touch him anytime he wanted to, Dean had trouble keeping his hands to himself.  Dean ran his other hand up the inside of Cas’s thigh under the blanket that covered them.
Dean turned to Cas. “Cas-”
The morning after.  Dean and Cas argue for no reason and then get hot and heavy in the kitchen.  Then they have a conversation about their "relationship" and what to tell Ben.
Dean was totally NOT picturing Cas in nothing but the Pilgrim hat and booty shorts.  He cleared his throat.
Dean moved back in and rubbed himself against Cas’s now slick cock, his hand circling them and squeezing them together.
“Maybe-,” Sam cleared his throat, “maybe it’s time to consider Doc Galverson’s suggestion...the sanitarium in Glenwood Springs?”
“It means, Cas, that I’m not gonna be satisfied with a quickie in the alley.  I want to take you home,” Dean licked his lips and eyed Cas. “and spread you out on my bed and worship you.”
Cas just nodded and moved closer. Before Dean knew what he was up to, he slid both of his hands in to the tear, gripped the flimsy material in both fists and yanked in opposite directions, ripping the shirt open. Without missing a beat, he mouthed over Dean’s left nipple and teased it with his tongue before sucking it, hard.
That night, after he’d settled Cas into bed, Dean started reading Cas’s journals.  They dated back to 1858 - Cas’s first year of medical school at Georgetown.  Dean smiled reading 20 year-old Cas’s reactions to the trials of medical school and the bullying behavior of his professors and upperclassmen.  Dean read between the lines of Cas’s blocky, uniform script to pick out details of his first love.  Cas didn’t explicitly address the nature of his relationship with a classmate called ‘Alan,’ but Dean knew with Cas’s description of how irritating Alan was that Cas had feelings for him.  The two men vied for top of the class, trading places term to term.  By their graduation in late 1860, Cas earning the top spot and Alan second in the class, Cas made plans to open a practice in D.C. after his residency, near the hospital where Alan planned to work.  Cas wrote optimistically about their futures.
Dean just sat there, watching the door open, swallow Cas, and close. He was too stunned to be angry.
“Thanks, Bobby. I’ll come in early tomorrow,” Dean offered.
“What’ll it be Cas?” Dean asked, eyeballing Meg running her fingers through Cas’s hair.
Cas never broke eye contact with Dean.  He tilted his head to the side.  “Whiskey, neat.”
“No - don’t put him there.  Bring him back here to my table,” Castiel finished, shuffling out of the way.
Dean cleared his throat as he took in Cas’s swaying form.  “I think it’s time for bed, Cas.”
It was gonna be a long night if Cas kept this up, Dean thought.
“Mmm,” she purred.  “Thanks, Clarence.”
Dean huffed.  If only Sam knew the irony of his statement.  Figures.  First person he’d liked in forever and it was Ben’s goddamn favorite teacher/hero.  “I never stop,” was all he said.
Ack! My bad but the end of this got cut off ; now updated with some important, hopefully funny Dean reactions to their first encounter.
Cas touched his shoulder gently.
*****
“I’m sorry, Dean, I didn’t know,” Cas said desperately.  “Gabriel said we’d been invited to a coworker’s family gathering.  We don’t have family in town, you see.  I only knew the coworker’s name was ‘Sam.’”
Dean shrugged his shoulders.  “What can I say, Sammy, the heart wants what the heart wants.”
“Oh shit!” Sam yelled.  He ran toward Dean.  “Dean!  Dean!  Are you okay?”  He crouched down, his worried puppy expression blurry through the tears stinging Dean’s eyes.
“Ho-ho-ho, have you been naughty, boys and girls?” Gabriel asked.  The crowd cheered.  “Or have you been nice?”  The crowd cheered louder.  Gabriel seemed to consider this.  “Well, I don’t know, kiddies, but this next act is both so naughty and so nice...please welcome to the stage The Angel-” the crowd roared at the mention of Cas’s stage name, “with special guest, The Demon!” Gabriel finished.  He exited through the curtain, bowing.
“Oh. my. God.” Cas moaned.  “Right there - right there,” he said.
Dean pulled the tie off quickly and then glued his eyes back to Cas. He stood there - so gorgeous, eyes blazing, hair a mess, marks on his neck and chest, cock so hard it looked like it hurt, naked - naked except for the bowtie. Dean felt his heart skip a beat as all the remaining blood in his body had to be making one last valiant effort to rush to his dick.
“Damn you, Dean Winchester,” Cas said, but his voice was soft and his eyes crinkled up at the corners.
“Don’t worry about it, kid.”
“Work,” Cas said, and seemed confused at Dean’s irritation.
He shifted slightly, trying to get some feeling back into his arm.  Cas stirred and smiled in his sleep.  Dean couldn’t help smiling too; he was adorable.  Cas slowly opened his eyes and blinked at Dean.  Dean watched his brain come online and then the realization of who he was with and what had happened flashed across his face.
Cas screamed and came over Dean’s hand.  Dean thrust in two or three more times, riding Cas through his orgasm, and came buried deep.
“Song of the Open Road, by Walt Whitman,” he began.
“I thought my parents would support me no matter what.”
“You didn’t seem interested in this last night,” Castiel said, breathlessly.
“Remember that tile work I wanted done in the bathroom?”
“You slept in my bed,” Castiel said.
Castiel considered this, and tilted his head to the side.  “I’d like that,” he said quietly.  “When I’m ready.”  He stepped closer to Dean, a scant inch between their bodies.  “But for now, Dean Winchester, you started something.” Castiel tilted his head up toward Dean’s face. “Are you prepared to finish it?”
Cas cleared his throat.  “Well, you read a great deal more than most students, Ben.”
“Shirt off, Dean,” Cas said as he pulled the suspenders down his shoulders, and slid his own boxers off. And fuck if Dean was gonna refuse Cas a goddamn thing when he sounded like that.
“Now, why don’t you two go home and tell Ben and Sam the good news? Oh and I got you the rest of the week off. Paid, even.” Gabriel said.
“Oh, oh Dean,” Cas moaned.
*****
“Off duty?” he asked, his hand curling around his glass of honey whiskey. Dean recognized it as the one he’d poured for Gabriel. He’d garnished it with a candied orange slice. He knew he was the only bartender to do that. Novak’s other hand settled on Dean’s knee. Dean swallowed, hard. He removed Novak’s hand and placed it back on his own bare knee.
Dean cares for Cas after his breakdown.  We learn Cas's backstory.
They stared at one another for what felt like minutes.  Dean finally cleared his throat.  “Yeah, our dad was a piece of work too.  Mom died when Sam was four - car crash, and Dad - well, he never really recovered.  He hadn’t been much of a drinker before she died, but after…” Dean trailed off.  “He passed about twelve years ago and then Lisa -” he couldn’t finish.
“Jesus,” said Dean.
“Gabriel, I -” Cas started, but Gabriel just waved his hand, his face serious again.
Dean heaved a sigh. He was not looking forward to this, not at all.
Cas looked at Dean, meeting his eyes and tilted his head to the side, considering.
“It’s not your fault Dean,” Cas said, his hand turning Dean’s face toward him.  Cas waited.  “What happened to your leg, Dean?” Cas asked finally.
Long, long shall I rue thee
“Last night was fun, but I know how important Ben is to you and I don’t want to get in the way -”
Cas cringed.  “Is that why you did this with me?!” he asked, suddenly angry.
He smiled to himself as he heard Cas in the bathroom. Dean had waited all day to get him alone but now that they finally were, he felt sleep tugging at him. After toasting Sam and choking up a bit - he was only human after all - he’d deliberately taken it easy on the booze. Cas had looked so fucking good in his royal blue man of honor suit, crisp white shirt, and bowtie, Dean had taken one look at him and had to fight a popping a boner all through wedding party photos. And then, when they’d gotten to the dance hall and Cas had casually slipped his jacket off to reveal fucking suspenders?! It was all Dean could do not to wrap his fists around them and yank him into the nearest dark corner.
“What?! Hell no,” Dean said. “We didn’t really get involved until a week ago because we didn’t want to screw things up for you.  We only got more serious now because you’re changing classes after break.  It’s my fault,” Dean gulped, “I can’t be just friends with Cas, Ben.”
“You’re completely gone on him, aren’t you?” Sam asked, softly.
Dean saw the door open over the guy’s shoulder and Peg walked through. She looked up and clapped her hands together.
“Another,” Cas panted, wiggling his hips.
“What?” Dean asked, curiosity getting the best of him.
The lights dimmed and the show started to rousing applause from the crowd. Dean snuck peeks at the acts between frantic drink mixing and slinging. Before he knew it, it seemed it was five to midnight.
Cas looked helplessly at Dean over his shoulder and mouthed ‘help me,’ as Meg drug him out to the living room.
The following week, Dean had to admit he was actually looking forward to the dance lesson. He hadn’t seen Cas since the impromptu get-together at the bar the week before. Of course, he wasn’t without some anxiety about being physically close to Cas for the better part of an hour. Fortunately, this time he’d not had to come straight from work and had scheduled a little “Gentleman’s time” in the shower before driving over to the city.
I think whatever I shall meet on the road I shall like, and whoever beholds me shall like me,
“I wish it was that easy, Sam,” Dean said.  “But, it’s...complicated.”
“Cas, I wanted to explain -”
*****
They moved to sit on the patio furniture and Sam ran inside to get some ice and an old towel.  Dean wiped his face and held the ice to his nose.
The sun beat down brutally as Castiel stood alone on the ridge above the dam.  The task of igniting the dynamite had fallen to him.  Castiel checked his pocket watch:  a quarter of eleven.  He was to push the plunger down on the blasting box, igniting the dynamite and blowing the dam on the top of the hour.  Dean, Bobby, Sam, and some of the backup men they’d recruited would drive Alistair and his men from their camp into the bottlenecked canyon at high noon.  By that time the dry bed would have flooded, cutting them off and trapping them.  Ryan and MacLain, two of their new deputies and the best long-range shots, were already in position around the rim of the canyon.
Cas rolled his eyes.  “It IS a wedding, Dean.  Flowers are customary, I believe.”
“Afoot and light-hearted I take to the open road,
*****
“Huh? Oh yeah, okay,” he said.
“Wow, that was exhausting,” Sam said.
“Happy to oblige,” Dean said, pulling the panties down and finally freeing Cas’s cock.
“Shit!” Dean shouted, startled.
Sam rolled his eyes.
Forty-five minutes later, Dean had been proven wrong. Time flew by and he couldn’t believe the lesson was over. He didn’t know what was worse, having to touch Cas and be respectful, all the while thinking of the least sexy things his imagination could conjure - things like waiting in line at the DMV, milk that was just a little bit past the expiration date, cleaning roadkill out of Baby’s grill - or the thought that he wouldn’t get to touch Cas again until their lesson next month, this time with the rest of the bridal party.
“I’d prefer whiskey, Doc,” Dean quipped.  The pain was dimming and he felt like he was floating.
Castiel nodded, trying not to let the tears filling his eyes spill out.  He set his jaw and looked up to meet Dean’s eyes.
He followed Sam over to one of the chairs on the enclosed front porch and threw himself down into it.  Sam sank into the other one and leaned forward to switch on the space heater they kept on the porch.
Ben came down the stairs carrying two cans of Coke. He handed one to Dean and took a drink from the other. “Can I help, Dad?” he asked.

Dean looked at the block numbers above the double glass doors of the brick building and back down at the card Sam had given him. This had to be the place. He finally spotted “Arthur Murray Studio” in white lettering on a black background, partially obstructed by mini pumpkins and fall decorations.
“Sam - Sam!” Dean called, trying to determine his location.  The man - Hannity - slapped him across the face.
“Happy New Year, Dean,” Cas said.
“No!” Castiel shouted desperately, emerging from his hiding place.  He watched helplessly as Alistair and his man faced Dean.  And then Ryan was up and coming for him, swinging his rifle around to bear on Castiel.  He ducked to the side, diving back into the foliage as Ryan fired a round, missing Castiel.  “Traitor!” Castiel hissed between clenched teeth.  Ryan turned to fire another shot at him, but Castiel was faster.  He leapt from his hiding place, landing on Ryan and tackling him to the ground.  He wrenched the rifle from Ryan’s grip and tossed it to the side.  Castiel watched as his hands wrapped themselves around Ryan’s throat.  He felt nothing but rage as he pushed down and crushed the man’s larynx, holding him in an iron grip until his face turned purple and he stopped breathing.
“My apologies, Dean,” he said.  He helped Dean hobble over to the bed.  Castiel pulled down the blankets and helped ease Dean’s weight down to a sitting position.  Dean shifted to lie down on his back.
“I won’t go away Cas,” he yelled, “but you’re killing me too.  You think you’re the only one who’s screwed up?!  You think you’re the only one to live with guilt?!” he roared.  “Stop being so selfish, Cas,” Dean said, “we all have our demons.”
“What about Sam’s?”
“Us,” Dean answered.
“You’d be crazy not to be scared, Dean,” Cas reassured.
, but Cas knew what he was doing. Dean felt one of Cas’s hands slide around to grip the nape of his neck and the other fisted in his jacket, pulling him closer. Cas pulled back slightly, biting at Dean’s lower lip as he did so and this time Dean felt a needy moan escape through his lips at the loss of Cas’s mouth.
“Hey - Cas - watch it - ” Dean started.
“Why don’t you show me then?” he said.
Dean moved his hand to cup Cas’s face.  “Please, Cas,” he whispered against Cas’s lips.  “I need you.”
Dean and Cas get to know each other a bit better. Cas plays hot and cold and Dean is frustrated.
Cas fell against him, and all the flight flew out of Dean. “I don’t know what I’m going to do, Dean,” he whispered as tears fell down his cheeks.
Cas gripped him suddenly around the waist and stood up.  Damn, Dean knew Cas was strong, but he didn’t know he could manhandle him.  He...liked it.  A lot.
Dean took a couple more steps, across the room checking out the speakers and sound equipment. He heard the door open and turned, thinking he’d see Peg. Instead, a guy about his age with a rumpled trench coat and a serious case of bed head walked in. He walked right up into Dean’s personal space and squinted at him, and oh, okay those were some gorgeous blue eyes, he thought. Dean licked his lips and watched the guy’s eyes track the motion before locking eyes with him again.
“Dean-Dean!” Cas was calling his name and shaking him by the shoulders.  “Dean - wake up,” Cas said.  “Wake up!”
Dean watched as Cas straddled him and he sucked in a breath and closed his eyes when he felt nimble fingers tugging on his fly.  He lifted his hips and let Cas pull his jeans and boxers down around his ankles.  He was about to sit up and protest that he still had his damn boots on when he felt Cas’s hand around him and his tongue licking a stripe up the underside of his dick.
Dean smirked as he made the disgusting appletini and poured a generous honey whiskey. As he handed the drinks over to Gabriel he saw he had his arm around Chuck and was pretending to give him noogies. “Now, hoss, you gotta let this young man have a beverage - don’t you agree?” Chuck laughed good naturedly. If Dean wasn’t wrong, he was a bit in the bag, too. Chuck’s bathrobe drooped open. He’d gone as Arthur Dent from Hitchhiker’s Guide and his towel, slung around his neck, was a bit worse for wear, noted Dean.
“What the fuck does that mean?” Cas demanded.  Dean didn’t think he’d ever seen him so pissed off.  Well - maybe the first time he saw him and nearly ran him over.
Dean lined up the shot and took in a deep breath. He pulled arm back and was ready to shoot on the exhale -
When Castiel felt his cock bump the soft palate of the back of Dean’s throat he reached down and threaded his hand through Dean’s hair, gripping a fistful.  Dean moaned around his cock and Castiel had to concentrate not to spend himself right then.  Castiel felt Dean’s hand slide up his chest to his neck until Dean placed two fingers against his bottom lip.  He sucked Dean’s fingers into his mouth and ran his tongue all around them.  Dean moaned again and Castiel felt him pull off.
Dean slept better than he had in weeks.  After the conference with Cas, he’d been able to let go of the anxiety and guilt he’d been carrying around since Halloween.  He also cut back on Roadhouse shifts and started picking Ben up from school.  He’d chat with Cas and if they weren’t quite friends, well, at least they could say a few words to each other.

Oh shit, thought Dean. God hates me and this is proof. He recognized the man as the runner he’d nearly side swiped. Dean saw a similar flash of recognition sweep across Angry Bee Man’s features but he just continued into the room, schooling his face back into a blank expression.
“You ordered?” Cas asked.
Dean shook his head to dispel the image.  “So, why the ‘dancing?’”
Title of this chapter comes from a lyric in the Hozier song "Jackie and Wilson."
Two days later, Castiel was still sore as he and Dean walked from breakfast at Harvelle’s to the general store.  He smiled to himself, remembering.  He hadn’t been expecting Dean to come crashing into his orderly little life, but as he glanced at him out of the corner of his eye, he felt grateful he had.
“Nah, been able to cut back.  We needed a new furnace,” he added.
Dean lost himself in the sensation of Cas’s mouth, hands and tongue on him.  He groaned at the feeling of Cas’s tongue on his balls and then nearly came when Cas sucked him back down, moaning around his dick.  He pulled his hands free of the t-shirt and pushed Cas off.

“Cas?!” Dean asked incredulously.
“Cas?” Dean asked.
“Winchester,” Novak said, his eyes widening. He put the drink to his mouth and downed it. “Um, I’d appreciate it if -”
They followed Gabriel out to the parking lot. Cas spoke first.
“Dean - don’t -” Cas said. “He’s not worth it.”
“Maybe you should,” he continued.  “I mean - we read to him, right, and we know he hears it.  Maybe if he heard you reading them, he’d wake up.  I mean,” Sam ducked his head and scratched the back of his neck, “he might wake up and never want to talk to you again.”  Sam dropped his hand and shrugged.  “But at least he’d be - well, he’d be Cas.”
“Fuck, Cas, not gonna last,” he said.  He slipped the hand that was not gripping them down the back of Cas’s shorts and brushed his fingers over his hole.  Cas shuddered and came with a grunt over their hands.  He licked into Dean’s ear and that was it.  Dean shot off like a bottle rocket.
Dean opened his mouth to argue but Castiel fixed him with a glare that brokered no argument.
Cowboy spoke up. “Not like this. You wait - you’ll see.”
“Yeah.  I think he’s still alive.” Cas shrugged.  “Not even sure what state he lives in, though.”
“Anyways,” Dean said and cleared his throat.  “I should probably let you get cleaned up.”
Warning for more smut :).  Sorry not sorry.  There will probably be two more chapters and I will try to get them done in the next week or so.  Thanks for reading!
Dean watched the relief literally flood over Cas’s face. Before he knew what he was doing, he had wrapped Gabriel in a bear hug.
“I’m sorry, Cas,” Dean said.  “I don’t want to hurt you or get you fired and God knows I’ve tried to ignore it, but I just - I just-”
Cas looked down, blushing.
“I have to go Cas,” he said.
“I see you’ve found Dean!” she said. “Peg told me you two made a great pair at dance lessons; she said, and I quote: ‘I’ve never seen two people with such natural chemistry!’”
*****
He slid one hand up from the suspenders to cup the back of Cas’s neck and kissed him. Cas sighed into the kiss and opened for Dean, his hands coming to rest gently on Dean’s hips. Dean lifted his other hand to Cas’s cheek, tilted his head to one side and turned the kiss filthy. Cas moaned around his tongue and Dean felt his dick twitch in response. Dean pulled away to kiss down Cas’s neck and over the bowtie. He worked on sucking a mark into the space just below the tie and above Cas’s clavicle. Dean slid one side of the suspenders to the side to access Cas’s nipple and then licked and bit gently at it. Cas gasped a breath but before he could release it, Dean pulled the other suspender side back and snapped it against his chest, right over his other nipple. Cas exhaled his breath like he’d been punched in the gut and dug his nails into Dean’s waist.
Just as he was about to pass out he heard Cas mumble something.
“What about Ben?” Cas asked.
Dean swallowed a gulp and stood up. He let out the breath he’d been holding. He leaned into Cas’s space and grabbed his suspenders, pulling him in. “Don’t you fucking dare,” he growled.
Castiel smiled the tiny crooked smile and opened the book.
“So, you and the doc…” Sam said on their walk back from the stables, glancing at Dean out of the corner of his eye.
Dean looked up sharply.  “Of course not!”
“I DO know, Dean Winchester. And since this is our first ‘date’ in weeks and the only time we have to be alone together for DAYS, you WILL humor me,” Cas said, sliding a motel room key card across the table.
Castiel stepped back from his side and glared at Dean.  “Oh I see,” he started. “I was unaware, Dean Winchester, that you went to medical school.  And I was unaware that you spent two months in residency after medical school learning the latest injury rehabilitation techniques with Dr. Bauer of Austria.”  He leaned closer to Dean and whisper-growled:  “You will do the goddamned arm circles because you want to keep using that arm.”
“Ooof,” Dean grunted. He rolled them over and pulled out of Cas. He didn’t want to move, but he got rid of the condom and grabbed a wet cloth for Cas. After they’d cleaned up a bit - well, he’d done most of the cleaning - Cas had laid there smiling like the cat who ate the canary, he pulled Cas into his chest and settled back onto the bed.
Dean looked at Whiskey Voice - Doc Novak.  He worried Sam might be putting his normal optimistic spin on things.  He needed the truth before the morphine kicked in.
He felt the adrenaline rush out of his body.  Castiel sank to his knees, the rifle still in his hand.  He saw Dean turn from tying an outlaw’s hands to look up at him.  His smile was a fierce thing to behold, a flash of white teeth in a face masked in dirt and blood.  The full realization of what he’d done slammed into Castiel’s consciousness.  His hands trembled and he dropped the rifle.  He doubled over and retched onto the grass.  What had he done, he thought over and over, dear God, what had he done?
“HOW LONG DAD?!” Ben roared, looking up.  “How long have you been sleeping with my teacher?!”
“NO!” Dean yelled.  He paused.  “Yes,” he said, quietly.  He shook his head.  “I don’t want to talk about it, Samuel.”
Cas shrugged.  “I’ve always been into yoga and well, I guess, it gets me out of my head to perform.  I stop thinking about work and the repressiveness of this town and the fact that my father abandoned us and I just...am,” he finished and locked eyes with Dean.
Cas sat up so fast he slipped off the seat and landed in a tangled heap on Baby’s floor boards.  Dean sat up, letting the blanket slide down.  He reached down and hoisted Cas up to sit next to him.  He moved to put the blanket over Cas but Cas jumped away.
Despite Ben no longer being in Cas’s class, they were keeping their relationship on the down low, at least around the school. Cas still had anxiety about losing his job if his “moonlighting” and their relationship were discovered, and they agreed it was better for Ben if their relationship was a bit of a secret. Dean figured they’d be cool to go officially public by summer. He was pretty sure just about everyone knew anyway. Gabriel wasn’t exactly subtle around the two of them. And he knew he couldn’t keep his feelings off of his face when he looked at Cas. He disgusted himself by sighing while thinking about Cas. As he waited for Cas he realized he hadn’t been so happy in a long time. “C’mon, Winchester, get it together, it’s not like you’re a Disney Princess,” he chided himself internally.
“Can you get it Dean?  Little busy here!” Sam said as he pulled a massive turkey out of the oven.
“Let the paper remain on the desk unwritten, and the book on the shelf unopen’d!
Cas held Dean until he calmed.  He pulled back to look at Dean but didn’t stop stroking his back.
“Yes, ma’am,” Dean replied, nodding his head slightly and shifting to remove his jacket and hang it on the hooks near the foyer.
“What?!” Both men said.
Cas shivered but moved to the opposite end of the couch, throwing a frown at Dean.  “I want to finish the movie,” he mouthed.
Dean leaned over to kiss him. “I am now.” He made to pull away and Cas grabbed the front of his shirt and pulled him in for another kiss. Two kisses turned into eight as Cas followed Dean to the door. Dean laughed through the kisses as Cas, wrapped in nothing but the top sheet, made it really difficult for him to leave.
Novak silenced him with a look. “We also have the discretion to use our own judgement in the case of first-time offenses,” he said. “Need I remind you of the policy I helped write and of who our largest alumni donor is?” he said the last part in what Dean thought of as a dangerous whisper.
Dean pulled back off to suck just on that spot again, releasing himself to grip Cas once again.
Dean grunted.  He nodded at the pillows on Cas’s bed.  “Nice trick.”
Cas moaned and moved his head to give Dean more access. He rutted against Dean’s thigh.
“I couldn’t sleep either.  I missed you,” Dean said.  He moved to embrace Cas.  He nuzzled his nose into Cas’s neck and breathed him in.  They’d taken advantage of the free baths the hotel offered with room rental.  Cas smelled amazing - like himself but with a hint of sandalwood and sweetgrass.  Cas gasped as Dean tasted him to see if he tasted as good as he smelled.  He did.  Dean was instantly hard.
“But Cas - Stone Cold Steve Austin was there - Stone Cold - ‘I’m gonna open up a can of whoop ass!’” Dean protested, imitating Stone Cold’s stage voice.
“Dammit, Dean,” Cas swore when Dean bypassed his flushed cock to lave the underside of Cas’s knee.  Dean smirked at the gasp that elicited from Cas before giving the other knee the same treatment and finally, finally sliding his mouth up the inside of Cas’s muscular thighs, pushing them wider.
“Hey!  DeanO, how’s it hanging?!” Gabriel said and slapping Dean on the shoulder, pushed his way passed Dean and into the foyer.
*****
“Oh fuck, Cas, baby, yeah, like that,” Dean said.
Gabriel raised his hands in a placating gesture.  “Alright, alright, just the usual, hoss.”
Three days and several pain-medication-sleep cycles later, Dean woke to the smell of eggs and bacon.  His mouth watered before he could open his eyes.  He had to admit, the bed rest was helping him heal; his pain had been reduced to a dull throb in the background.  He shifted to as much of a sitting position as he could manage from the cot Doc Novak had set up for him.
“Really, Dean?” Sam asked.  “I can dry.”
Cas nodded.
*****
Ben looked at his dad.  The next thing he knew, Ben was hugging him, clinging to Dean, his hands tight around Dean's neck, like he did as a young kid, and sobbing into his shoulder.
“Yeah, the old gal was shot after 30 years.”
Dean wakes up in the backseat of his car mostly naked and covered in glitter.
“So...Cas, huh?” Sam started.  “Wait - was Cas who had you all flustered before Thanksgiving? And you were weird at Thanksgiving because-because you’d already hooked up-,” Sam concluded.
Dean’s head ached and his mouth was drier than Arizona in January.  But something warm was wrapped around him and it was snoring so softly it reminded him of a purring cat.  He sighed contentedly.  Dean cracked open his eye and blinked against the bright sun.
“Dean - it’s just eggs and bacon.” Was that a blush creeping up the good doctor’s cheeks, Dean wondered.  “And we talked about this - call me Castiel.  Please.”
Cas strode around the table and into Dean’s space, the wrinkled sheet still wrapped around him like an absurd toga.
“No?” asked Dean, confused.
Milton cleared this throat. “Well, the policy on academic dishonesty is very clear. We have no choice but to exp-”
Sam threw his hands up and waved at Dean. “Whoa, whoa, TMI, dude.”
Dean could feel Cas’s gaze as he turned to look at him.
“Dad!” Ben called.  “It’s time to go; are you ready?”
Dean huffed a laugh.  “Yeah, you and me both.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh, I’ve seen some pretty great pole dancing,” Dean said and winked.
In the six months since, they had barely said more than that.  Castiel appreciated that Bobby knew when to shut up and was not the type of individual who felt the need to fill up silences with empty talk.  But seeing Bobby daily and drinking coffee next to him had become one of Castiel’s routines.  Which was why on this May morning when he sat down to his coffee and the sheriff was absent, he felt a nagging fear in the pit of his stomach.
“But Dean -”
*****
Dean's POV.  Dean wakes up in a lot of pain and vows revenge on Alistair.  But first, he needs to heal.  Luckily Castiel is there to help.  Oh and there's poetry.
“Yeah.  Now, how about you fuck me so hard I forget my name?” Cas asked, his voice completely even, the fucker. “Please?” he added.
“Yeah, Dean, you can clock out,” slurred Chuck, “why not, man?” he said.
“I am expected to plan both a bridal shower and a bachelorette party as well as write a toast and generally make sure the rest of the bridesmaids are in line and on time the day of.” Dean was learning that Cas’s monotone deadpan delivery was his way of expressing indignance or sarcasm. He smiled to himself.
Chapter 6:  Wanted:  Dead or Alive
Dean smiled lazily and opened one eye.  “Hey, where do you think you’re going, Doc?”
Cas set down his coffee mug and fixed Dean with a look.
Cas took the improvised blindfold off.  Dean watched as his eyes widened and he swallowed hard, adam’s apple bobbing up and down.  Dean let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding; he was afraid Cas would laugh the minute he saw him.  Dean started dancing to the music; he lost his shirt quickly, easily pulling the snaps apart and then sliding one side of the shirt down to expose one shoulder and then the other before dropping it to the floor.
Cas grabbed the pole up high with his right hand and twirled his body around first away and then back toward the audience letting the wings open.  He wore a simple white t-shirt and white track pants with double gold stripes down the sides.  Cas danced around the pole sometimes gripping and swinging his body and other times just bending around it.  He stretched his arms wide and bent back against the pole opening his chest and arching his neck.  Cas slid to his knees with his arms wide and then clasped together behind his back.
“Love her,” he explained. Cas continued, “she saved my life. Literally.”
“I don’t think that’s a good idea,” Cas said. He started to close the door behind him. “Goodnight Dean.” Cas shut the door and walked up the steps to his house without turning back.
“I think heroic deeds were all conceiv’d in the open air, and all free poems also,
“Make yourself at home,” he said, gesturing to the small, two-seat cafe table in the kitchen.  Cas took his seat and Dean set a hot cup of coffee in front of him.  Dean watched as Cas picked up the mug in both hands and breathed in deeply above the steaming cup.
“Are you kidding?! I hit that bastard with paperwork for every potential lawsuit I could think of. I told him if he fired you or tried to force you to resign, he’d be in and out of court for the rest of his miserable life.”
O now I triumph—and you shall also;
Dean freed Cas’s cock and shifted to rub against him.  Cas opened his hand around both of them and Dean licked his own palm and then brought his hand down to join Cas’s.
“How long?” he asked, quietly, looking at his shoes.
Thanksgiving arrived before Dean knew it.  “Shit,” he swore as he hustled around the kitchen, packing up the mashed potatoes he was taking over to Sam and Jess’s.  He refused to let Sam make them again, not after that “riced cauliflower” health bullshit he pulled last year.  Was nothing sacred anymore, he wondered.  Who the hell doesn’t want full-butter mashed potatoes and gravy on Thanksgiving, or as Dean thought of it in his head ‘National Gluttony and Football’ Day.
“Thank you, Dean,” Cas whispered back.  “What are you doing here?”
“Meg?” Cas asked.
Milton stepped around to leer at them both while Cas scrambled to cover himself with the sheet. Dean stepped protectively in front of Cas.
“Good, you’re both here!” Peg said. “Cas, you can put your coat over there,” Peg said, gesturing toward a set of hooks above a low bench along one wall.
“Yeah, well a tight spiral to the face will do that to ya.”
“I mean, that’s great, Cas, but skirts?!  I don’t know, man.”
Dean could swear he heard rather than saw Cas tilt his head with that considering look he got.
“Dean, move,” ordered Castiel.  He wasn’t as young as he used to be and unlikely to come again, but he loved the feeling of Dean inside him and wanted nothing more in that moment than to watch him lose control.
Warning for some making out and smut.  More to come :).
It hadn’t gone well.  Dean didn’t know what he’d expected, but Ben running out the back door, slamming it, and taking off to God-knows-where wasn’t it.
“I ain’t gonna quit on you, Cas,” Dean would say when he turned away from him.
“Can’t you get a hotel?” Dean asked weakly.

Suddenly his arms were full of Cas and Dean felt like he’d found a part of himself he didn’t know had been missing.  He cupped Cas’s cheek with one hand and wrapped his other arm low around Cas’s waist, sneaking inside the coat to splay his fingers across Cas’s warm skin.  Cas broke the kiss and groaned at Dean’s touch.  Dean rubbed his thumb over Cas’s swollen lips.  Cas wrapped his mouth around Dean’s thumb and nipping the pad, sucked it into his mouth, his cheeks hollowing around it.
Cas sat back but he looked spooked.  He let Dean sit up and scooted back to his side of the narrow bed.  Cas tilted his head to the side and although he said nothing, Dean heard the question.
They managed to get through the rest of dinner without Dean choking on his beer again, but by dessert, he’d had enough of Meg’s flirting and Gabriel’s innuendo.  She somehow managed to make eating stuffing erotic and insisted on eye-fucking Cas the entire time.  Dean offered to do the dishes just to get away from them.
