...obviously that will be ages away but it's kind of a big deal, breaking through the stereotype and all that. It'll be filmed too. Made into a proper documentary I think."
Steve wasn't a natural liar. It had taken a month of intense training from Natasha for Fury to even consider him for the job in the first place. She'd taught him how to lie and deceive-- how to use his
She laughed.  "No, thanks.  I never want to own one of those things.  They're a symbol of omega oppression."
or if people think we're weird 'cause he's taller than me. Like you said, challenging stereotypes and blah blah blah.  People who get it, get it. But we could give a thousand interviews and there will still be dicks like Malick who think Steve oughta be
It was very slightest out of focus and sepia-toned.  Eight men were looking at the camera.  Two of them Tony had recognized instantly.  His father, in the middle, stood out like a sore thumb in a turtleneck and a civilian jacket, a smug smirk on his face.  Steve was there right beside him, clean-shaven, chin tilted proudly up.  Tony had studied the other men carefully, methodically, left to right.  It looked obnoxiously integrated: there was a black guy on the far right and an Asian guy on the far left.  No women, though.  And Tony would bet his arc reactor that Steve was the only omega there.
Tony tried to locate the waiter to order another scotch.  "...what's with you and sending people to camps?" blurted Tony before he could help himself.  He immediately knew he'd misstepped. Badly.
"So...what are the chances of us going flying?" Steve asked curiously, eyes narrowing. "Like...I mean, if Rhodey can fit in one, then I could too, right?" The man was a soldier, a little shorter than Steve, but still. If he could fit in a suit, couldn't Steve? He understood they were precious property to his Alpha, but, honestly, ever since Steve had laid his eyes on them all he'd wanted was to know what it felt like. He'd always been an adrenaline junkie and the thought of flying around in one of those things was
onto our civil rights to-do list.  I've never heard of this, but even in normal society, you know how people treat omegas whose Alphas have distanced the bond.  Can you imagine what
When Tony came up from the workshop that night he spotted Steve in bed with a familiar long box, smiling down at its contents. Steve glanced up when Tony walked in, almost looking sheepish. "Hey," he murmured. "I never got a chance to thank you. This is... this is really touching Tony. And don't think I'm not grateful, I am. I get that it means a lot. But... why did you decide to give it to me?"
"I'm fine," the omega assured him. Tony pressing at the gland on his neck before meant he was already wet and practically ready. Steve wouldn't need much preparation like this.  "Don't treat me like I'm delicate," Steve whispered. "I'm not in the mood for it."
Steve turned and stepped into the foyer.  "Somebody! Somebody help!" All eyes turned to him. He felt something warm running down the inside of his thigh and trembled, his stomach spasming again. He was shaking.
Even though it was a completely inappropriate thought, Tony couldn't help just admire Steve's body.  The beads of water on his broad shoulders glistened and the muscles rippled under the surface of his skin like a tiger's.  Holy hell, Steve was gorgeous. Like an Adonis, a carved marble statue. And here in the pool, in only his boxers... Tony was reminded, again, uncomfortably, of the omegas that worked at the country club in his childhood, who wore only shorts or sarongs and collars, who were always tan and smiling and attractive.
"Thank you," said Steve in surprise, not expecting a congratulations. Something warmed in his chest.
Cece sighed.  "Wow. I really misread what you were all about.  Oh, well. I guess this isn't the worst way to spend the weekend.  Wanna scone?"
."  He turned to Steve.  "Sorry, you probably don't get that reference.  It's a really funny TV show. Go look it up!"
"Make me mate you?" he repeated in confusion.  Had he heard right? "...I'm not allowed to mate.  I'm a soldier; I don't have a mate. I'm not bonded to anyone."  The omega's words and tone was accusatory, like he had failed, but he knew he hadn't; Karpov had given him orders which he had satisfactorily completed.
.."  The fact that the interview had been planned for months didn't matter.  Tony hated mornings and hated morning people. Steve was always up at the crack of dawn.  There was no doubt in his mind that Pepper and Aria were downstairs already, cups of coffee in one hand and Blackberries in the other.
"But chances are you will. And you don't know they'll be kind; it's a gamble," Steve said. "Why can't you provide for yourself? Omegas can have jobs, and they go to college now. I would have killed for that kind of opportunity in my time! I'm not saying don't get an Alpha and don't settle down, but don't do it like this. Almost every omega I've met in here is-- they're like a shell. They won't talk to me, they won't look me in the eye like you guys do. They don't
"Everyone likes the story about the banana. Look. I get it, I hate these parties too. Singers and shit...they're insane. They throw good parties though. You really can't get drunk huh?"
The line went dead; Tony looked up into Steve's eye with a tender smile.  "...that's how you feel, too, right?  ...I mean about... about bonding.  It's about the same for omegas, right?"
"Inside, ruining my kitchen.  He's got an interview... I guess to dispel myths about pre-heats or something.  The problem is, Steve's pre-heats are pretty intense and he's fulfilling basically every stereotype.  At least he's not a nester."
Steve blinked and looked up, seeing a concerned Tony watching him. "It's not a...scary memory," he whispered. "Just a sad one.  Can we sleep? I mean, you don't have to. But I just wanna sleep it off."
"Thank God," said Pepper, surveying the damage to the kitchen.  "...well, we were due for a remodel anyway. Still, this was imported marble... I wish they'd been more careful..."  She sighed and put the kettle onto the stove. "Phil?!" she called. "Do you want to maybe come out of your nest now?"
Steve eagerly moved to straddle Tony's hips as soon as the instruction was given. His Alpha looked gorgeous, seated there with his shirt open and his dick hard and waiting just for Steve. His brow knotted a little in concentration as he made to line himself up. Steve curled his hands onto Tony's shoulders, gaining a firm purchase before he rocked his hips back and let the head of Tony's cock slide against the cleft of his ass.
He wondered if Steve did this sort of thing with any regularity in the 1940s.  Did he and Dad and Aunt Peggy all cheerfully maim other people and then go out dancing?  Tony couldn't imagine it.
Tony climbed off of Steve slowly and smoothed down the front of his t-shirt, forgetting that he was in street clothes and not his usual suit-and-tie combo.
Natasha sighed. "I think Tony sometimes over estimates your self-esteem. I don't think that's a bad thing, necessarily.  He just doesn't understand why you don't see yourself like he sees you."
"Yeah. They asked how you were doing with everything," Steve said, stepping out of his shorts. "And I quite rightly told them you were being great with it all," he murmured and looked up to meet Tony's gaze.
By the time they were to bed on Monday, with the anniversary and the flight to New York the next day, both of them were looking a bit worse for the wear.  Tony's lack of sleep was starting to mess with Steve's. Sure enough, that night, Tony woke up at 4:30 in the morning drenched in a cold sweat, yelling.
"I liked Irshad when I met her. She knew I'd had a miscarriage and put her hand on my arm and told me I was brace. No else did," Steve said quietly, gaze growing a little distant at the memory. That had been the day everything had gone to shit.
Instead, he turned and walked over to the door, turning the knob delicately and walking out into the hall with its impersonal, too-bright florescent lighting.
"But what if he was? What if he shacked up with some women for a few days? Could you forgive that? Would you stay?"
Steve had only really seen Tony like that once. And that was during his heat, when they'd had a fight and he had told Steve to kneel in his drawing room. It had been an intense an fiery moment, an
Once Steve gave his phone over that was it. Steve was putting all his trust into this random agent. He swallowed thickly. He was shivering again. Steve had tried to use his phone multiple times, but he couldn't do it himself.
"...Giddy's car is outside, in the parking garage downstairs," said Donner helpfully from within the pen, on the other side of the rope.  "You could let him outside until Mr. Stark escorts him back in."
"We can be a little late. It's fine," Steve assured him softly and then pulled out from the doorway. "I'll just go get dressed," he said and moved into his bedroom, although it smelled just as much of Tony as it did him now, and pulled off the shirt he'd been wearing.
Steve reached out to run his fingers through Tony's hair again, trying and failing to smooth it down. Because he'd slept on it wet his bed hair had  gone pretty wild. The sight was cute. He was almost tempted to snap a picture but he wasn't sure his Alpha would appreciate it.
"Yes, Agent Hill."  Phil turned and stalked out, glancing over his shoulder.  "Take care, Captain." He closed the door behind him, leaving Steve alone in bed.
"Do you want water?" he asked, because the omega's words, while fierce, also seemed incredibly raspy.
He nudged the tip of his cock against Steve's entrance.  There had been no foreplay, but Steve's body was responding automatically; he was already wet and Tony sank his length in, shuddering, the back of Steve's neck still in his mouth, muffling a groan.
Steve was rendered speechless.  He turned his attention to the flowers instead, trying not to act too hurt that he'd been left out of a mission.  "Nice roses."
"Not in person," said Tony.  "I think we've been at some of the same UN deals maybe, like, twice?  The king seems like a nice guy. I don't know a thing about the prince.  He's a younger guy, your age, I guess. I mean... not ninety, like, late twenties," sputtered Tony.  He began laughing. After a moment, he shook himself out. "So the deal is, supposedly, that the Wakandan bodyguard is all omegas because the king is supposed to choose a mate from them.  That way, his queen can protect him, get it? The queen died a few years ago, before you were unfrozen, and it was like Princess Di levels of mourning... oh. That was also before you were unfrozen.  Never mind."
The blond jumped the span of two buildings, rolled, kept running.  He jumped onto another building, he was skidding and slipping in the snow, and so was the soldier, and it would have been comical if the stakes hadn't felt so high.
"A friend," Howard echoed coldly, eyes still on Steve. "Well he's certainly not from your college, just look at him. Where on earth would you find a spade like this, Tony? You haven't been paying for it, have you?"
"So you guys are gonna hover over me while I go through Dad's stuff?  What if I don't find what I'm looking for?  Then will you leave me alone?  I can't make any promises.  Creating a new element is a damn big order, even for a genius like me.  And it takes time.  And frankly, I normally only work like two hours a day and that's with Pepper breathing down my--"
"Mm-hm.  ...I thought about Sarah, too, like my great-grandma."  Donner's head was literally dropping. "She's beautiful, isn't she?"
Fury dropped a suitcase onto the table a little loudly. He opened it to reveal a dozen needles inside. "These won't cure you," he stated and pushed them over for Tony to inspect. "But they will buy you time. As for a permanent solution, we believe you can find it in your father's work."
He pulled up outside of their hotel.  Tony peeked out nervously. He wasn't sure how they were supposed to walk through the lobby without being noticed.  Sure, their clothes were dark, but on the silver case, the bloodstains were obvious.
"...well... c'mon. Let's get you to your little omega kindergarten."  Tony looked at Steve apologetically. Rubbing shoulders with rich conservative assholes, drinking, and gambling were all things Tony excelled at. He felt bad that Steve was going to be in some other hall with a bunch of Stockholm-syndrome-having nobodies.
Both he and Tony had concussions; a throbbing headache had developed behind Steve's eyes and he was desperate for sleep.
Steve glanced sideways over at Tony, his eyes narrowing a fraction. "Is that the first thing you've eaten today?"
They clamored out of the car and Steve saw Tony do what Tony did.  His mask came down and he oozed charisma as he shook hands and greeted a team of army grunts, doctors, psychologists, and others.  Steve found Natasha in the crowd and she gave Steve a small nod.  Clint and Phil were conspicuously absent.
"Hey, so I guess Tony Stark's pretty good at pool, right? Like...it's all just maths when you get down to it." Callum wore thick rimmed glasses and was studying something to do with physics and math for his PHD (the title of which had admittedly gone straight over Steve's head.) Callum was grinning, too. All of them were clearly very excited.
Steve opted to ignore his question.  "Sam and Tony go in through the roof. We go in through the back; they have a passage for
He gave a small, experimental tug of his hips.  "I need to get out. Can you-- can you, like, unclench?  You're sort of-- sort of gripping it really hard." He gave another tug but the feel of Steve on his knot was only getting him aroused.  "...we can just make love. Without touching your neck," he offered.
The question was, should he take this offer for information or not?  He doubted he was authorized, but he also didn't think he was forbidden.  This was liked how Pietro kept giving him gum, something Karpov seemed annoyed by but not enough to actually tell him no.
On the sixth time he testified, he spotted Cupid in the hall, wearing a pair of black slacks and a maroon blouse with a ruffle in the front.  Steve had not appreciate how young she was; in her professional clothes, she looked like a child playing dress-up. Steve doubted she was old enough to drink.  Yet there was a new hardness about her, a sharp, professional meanness that had not been there before.
"Tony, you were there.  I can take your statement separately--" offered Maria.  Tony let out a snarl-wail, clinging harder to Steve. "...or not," she finished.
"Hours?" repeated Steve groggily.  His had lasted less than that.  Steve had a feeling that's what must have happened when they did it to Clint (if anyone ever had. They probably had.) He imagined it wasn't fun. The heat the inducer created was a painful one, not the sweet and tender kind.
"About the same," Steve whispered and nudged his nose against Tony's cheek in a fond gesture. He let his eyes slip. "I feel like...this weirdly incessant need to please you," he hummed, breath tickling against Tony's cheek. Steve smiled against his skin too, eyelashes fluttering down. He squeezed Tony's fingers gently.
with the way things are... I'm worried he's going to cause trouble for those of us that are grateful for what we have.  He doesn't represent me. I don't
He nosed along the other's jawline. "I know you're not feeling good," Steve murmured. "I wanna make you feel better Tony. Tell me how how I can make you feel better."
Within a few days, though, it had become apparent that Steve's personality wasn't what Tony had expected.  Steve was helpful, yes, because that was his job. But he acted... not like the omegas Tony was used to. Tony was used to omegas being quiet little shadows, shoe-elves; Steve was big and bold and acted like he expected to be treated with respect.
"...Steve.  ...you're blushing," said Tony, starting to smile.  He gestured for Steve to sit with him on the bed. "...Steve," he said, his face resolving into a more serious expression.  "Listen, I... I don't want to pressure you, okay? For a while I want you to be in charge because I.... I don't understand bonding from your perspective, you know?  I don't want to rush you or anything like that."  He glanced down.  "It's different for Alphas.  We can kinda... ignore it, sort of.  ...I'm sorry I did that, though. I'm glad you're back."
, had made him feel that fear. For a split second after Karpov had given the order and Bucky had lunged, Steve had truly believed he was going to do it.
He sipped on his coffee again, wishing he and Steve could hang out all morning.  But Steve had somewhere to be.  Where was "somewhere?"
He couldn't really understand that now. It felt so... distant. Especially with Tony, his mate, ready and hard in front of him. Steve swallowed thickly at the sight. "I just wanna be good for you," he whispered with heavy lidded eyes. Steve licked his lips then leaned forward to nip at Tony's own, which were parted just perfectly.
Fred sidled up with a fancy-looking, brightly colored drink in his hand.  "Oo, are you guys talking about their little card game? Last year, mine won a night with Shimmer.  It was so much fun. He passed out after like three hours and we spent the rest of the night watching old re-runs of
"Let's cause some chaos, Jarv.  Start copying anything that looks important, then wipe out all e-mails, delete all records... let's see... put a perma-ban on any new uploads... redirect any outgoing electronic data to be pinged back to SHIELD HQ... throw Dora the Explorer up on any screens..."
"Rogers." Never had his tone been more patronizing. "You can't be serious. This is just a simulation."
"In the balls," repeated Tony.  "...although if you were trying to bone him when he did that, y'know, obviously--"
Steve could hold his breath for two minutes, Tony knew that, so he quite happily submerged himself under water as he took Tony's half-hard dick into his mouth. Over the past seven months Steve had gotten
Pepper stormed back into the house like a thundercloud.  Everyone looked up with interest at the drama unfolding; Pepper was grabbing her sweater off the back of the couch.
And he meant it. If Gideon wanted Steve to kneel he would have to bully him into it, physically. And despite being stiff and tired Steve would kick and writhe through all of it. This felt like an awful lot of effort for Gideon just to get him to kneel for him. Steve didn't trust that he would let him go. He said he wanted a night. Steve didn't want to know what that meant. And he sure as hell wouldn't ever cooperate.
"Are you sure you don't want me to send someone round?" Natasha asked for the millionth time. Steve was in a lull, the heat would start up again soon but right now he could think normally. Or at least, normally enough to have a conversation over the phone.
"Who is Karpov?" he demanded, deciding not to think about Bucky for now.  He was still avoiding looking at Steve.  His brain kept replaying that moment on the couch, the two of them necking, Steve purring, Bucky's lips on his neck... ugh.
come after me. If HYDRA were planning all that then why the hell would they send a warning? I'm not really keen on digging up the location of a deadly assassin or a shitty ex anytime soon, if I'm honest.
Tony looked bewildered.  He'd never had much to do with omegas and as an Alpha, he was often caught off-guard by the number of establishments that still barred omegas.  Of course, it was technically illegal to claim a business didn't allow omegas, thanks to anti-discrimination laws, but people knew perfectly well which places were still unofficially single-status or anti-omega.  Omegas steered clear of those places.
Steve's expression softened and he raised his head, eyes still on Tony. "Of course I'll be there," he said. "We can still get a practice in, if you want. It'll be quieter in the evenings...Nat was texting me about it, actually. When I was drawing.  We can go in together. Do you think that would help?" Steve asked. "You can have actually have up to five people in the machine at once. It wouldn't be dangerous. It's up to you." He knew that he would have felt a lot better with Tony in with him the first time. It had been a very isolating experience - he hadn't felt that alone since he'd been driving in ice cold sea water.
The waiter hesitated.  "Sir, I'm... I'm not sure I can serve you nine shots in less than an hour," he said, not meeting Tony's eyes, posture completely submissive.
Wait.  Where the fuck was his Rubik's cube?  Tony scrambled around the floor for a bit, then gave up.  "I... I lost my Rubik's cube.  I'm pretty drunk.  A little bit--"  Tony bit back a sudden urge to vomit.
"Up yours, Happy!" replied Tony grumpily, stepping out into the cold New York weather and slamming the door behind him.  Happy didn't seem bothered in the slightest; he, like everyone else in Tony's life, was used to mood swings.
Some notes on this chapter: there are GRAPHIC descriptions of a non-consensual assault.  If you're not into that, I highly recommend you skip this chapter, as Cap gets into a really dicey situation.  Although we have tags and warnings on the story as a whole, I want to emphasize that this chapter in particular has potentially triggering content, so please exercise your own good judgement before reading.  Thanks!
"Let's stick around for the countdown," said Tony, smiling.  He checked his watch. "Which is in two minutes, by the way."
Eric led the way. They went into the elevator then up a few flights and headed into what looked like a lecture theater/conference room. They grabbed seats near the middle, Eric saying something about not being too far from the front if they wanted to ask questions.
Cece sat back, blinking.  "...wow. I thought that was the lamest excuse for a date ever, but you're completely serious, aren't you?  You're his biggest fan."
He stared down at the police officers as they walked past him. Despite mostly being Alphas, they looked intimidated. One woman in a suit was on her phone in the background, saying they'd been 'cooperative.'
"I mean- I did like it, sort of, but then not because it was a random stranger doing it. You make me feel good
"Cum with me, Steve?" he murmured, panting softly as he thrust into Steve.  Steve's body was warm under him and gleaming with sweat; Steve's look was one of rapture and that, more than anything, was what was making Tony's cock throb inside him, was pushing Tony toward the edge.  He caught Steve's lips in his again; their kisses had turned frantic, sloppy as they edged toward climax.
Yet life wasn't boring.  He let Tony whisk him away to New York for his birthday; they visited his old haunts in Brooklyn, many of which were no longer recognizable.  They shared a meal at a small pizza place; the evening ended rather dramatically when Tony unfurled Steve's birthday present.  ("Ta-da!" he'd exclaimed dramatically as a woman walked in wearing a heavy leather glove.  Perched upon it was a bald eagle.  "Her name's Liberty!" he said; Liberty shrieked and flapped her wings, alarming everyone in the restaurant.)  (Steve texted Aria and Pepper to ask if they could find a suitable refuge for Liberty, not wanting a rogue eagle flapping around the Stark mansion and overturning orchids.)
"So, yeah, they told me not to make this about status but I am so--" Steve got choked up, then shrugged, then grinned sheepishly. The crowd laughed softly. "Omegas fucking rule! And... and respect everybody!"
(The answer wasn't a simple one.  Tony was prone to crashing and sleeping like he was dead after a bout of work in the lab.  Steve had found him sprawled over the counters in the kitchen, on the pool deck, curled under desks, and bent in all sorts of unnatural positions, unable to wake.  On the other hand, when Tony fell asleep naturally, he was a light sleeper who often woke suddenly and violently, a consequence of PTSD.)
Steve could have sworn it was. He'd gotten dressed, gone downstairs, and moved the flowers, hadn't he? How could
"Yeah and now Uncle Sam's trying to get us all to think omega rights and war are like, the same cause, man.  What a bunch of bullshit.  I hope
There was a pause on Pepper's line.  "Yes," she said.  "...and I owe you an apology, Captain Rogers.  You barely changed your name, and you didn't change your appearance.  But because you're an omega, I never even considered... I'm sorry.  We all like to think we're better than that, but I suppose even the best of us hold some subconscious prejudice."  She sighed.  "I take it you were there to tail Tony?  Get the suit designs?  Which department sent you?"
Tony leaned down and grabbed Steve's shirt in his teeth, giving it a tug.  "If you undress I might just show you what's under my fur," he joked. Tony had every intention of going to the auction dressed as a squirrel and standing neck to Malick to embarrass him.
"Love you too," Steve panted out, his own cock hard and pressed into the sheets. He would make a mess of them no doubt but they'd been replaced many times before (because of both sex and that time Steve got shot.) The friction of each thrust almost burned and he thrived on it.  "Fuuck," Steve gasped softly, eyes rolling back as Tony pressed inside of him. He shivered at the stretch and took it well, clenching around him invitingly as he lazily rocked back into Tony's thrusts. "Tony. Yes, that's-" fingers curled over his own, almost pinning him down as he curled and squirmed at the touch.
Steve turned around and grabbed some clothes for Tony. He held out the t-shirt. "Come on Tony." The other was not remotely interested in getting dressed. Steve sighed. It would seem he'd have to bribe him. "If you get dressed I'll give you a kiss but
"Do you...do you really think I'm worth all this trouble? How can I fight an enemy whose constantly undermining me everywhere I go?" Steve murmured and picked at the sandwich some more.
"...ANTHONY!" hollered a voice from outside.  Tony made a beeline for the back of the house, downing his martini and intent of throwing Pitbull into the pool and maybe hurling a beer can at his head while he was at it.
Steve hugged her back, wanting to reassure her more. An himself. He'd never meant to make her feel like this. Steve was instantly feeling bad. "I..." he sighed and pulled back, squeezing Peggy's hand to try and ease the shock. She'd clearly never seen this coming, but then who goddamn had?
Pepper was on the phone as he passed her office but gave him a warm smile as she took the coffee off of him.
"So aside from the drug trip, the rest of it is just standard psych stuff, right?" called Tony, trying to sound casual.  "Ink blots, word association?  Do they ask about your dreams?  Did you say,
"Code that is coded to identify human emotions," pointed out JARVIS.  "Shall I call Colonel Rhodes now?"
"I'm okay," Steve said a little too quickly and pressed the letter face down onto the table. He looked a little distance, his blue eyes glassy. "I just..." His gaze trailed from the letter up to Tony's face. Had Bucky sent the flowers too? It seemed so strange; an ex-HYDRA assassin sending flowers. "It's hard to not feel like I'm failing you in some way."
and the smell coming off him was one of sorrow and loss and Tony hurt just breathing it, knowing that every word coming out of his mouth was affecting Steve negatively.
But Steve was frozen and it was impossible to tell if he was in temporary shock at someone touching him or whether she'd discovered some sort of magical "off" switch.  Tony had seen videos on YouTube of people hypnotizing chickens and he wondered, bizarrely, if this was like that.
And he was with HYDRA, and they could control him... so how could Steve possibly help him, now he was out of SHIELD, not allowed to perform any field work?
Gleason was preparing the sedative on the coffee, getting a scarily long needle out and filling it with a clear looking liquid.
"Sober?" Dr. Martin echoed and raised a brow. Her hair was jet black. "Are you an alcoholic, Mr Stark?" she asked bluntly.
"Uh... sure.  Yeah, sure, " said Tony, nodding.  He didn't feel like explaining to Steve how awkward it would be to try to reconnect with Aunt Peggy after all this time.  She had been a friend of Howard's, and Jarvis's, too, and Tony hadn't spoken to her in... shit, about twenty years.  It would just be too awkward.  But it was hard to say no to Steve when Steve seemed like he was in such a great mood.  "...you and her, you were close, right?  ...you think she'll be happy you're bonded?  Have you talked to her?  Does she know yet?  I guess everyone knows.  Have you talked to her?" asked Tony.  He had taken it for granted that Steve didn't really have anyone in his life.  Tony had no parents he had to impress, no siblings or old childhood friends who were protective of Steve.  There was the threat of Bucky, of course, but Tony wasn't especially scared of a guy who, even if he was alive, was well into his nineties and undoubtedly mentally compromised.  Amnesiac centenarians were the least of Tony's problems.
He let out a nervous breath. The kids weren't going to walk out. Steve hadn't said the right things; he'd been too presumptuous.  Like Phil said, the omegas were part of it.  Victims, yes, but also instrumental in protecting their oppressors.
"My shoulder's healed, thanks," Steve breathed, honestly having forgotten he'd dislocated it in the first place.
Steve was in a trance. He'd even whimpered slightly when Tony sucked a mark into his skin, leaving his trace there. Claiming what was his. Steve felt himself shiver. He felt hot and cold all over all at once. He felt
"I analyze all data available to me.  Your average love-making session is twenty-three minutes long.  Your average mating time is four minutes."
Wanda looked at Pietro.  She couldn't tell but she suspected a rabbit.  The man was lean, and he was blond. Omegas had an overwhelming tendency (thirty to fifty percent) to be blonds.
"He probably always will.  But Steve's good for him," said Pepper.  "...this is literally the longest relationship he's ever been in."
"--but he's dead.  He's dead, isn't he?" pressed Tony.  He was avoiding looking at Steve.  Oh, God, it hurt; the memory of he and Bucky with their forehead pressed together, smiling at each other before the war...Tony had barely come to terms with the fact that his omega was previously bonded and now he'd seen inside his old Alpha's head, and it was terrible, knowing that Bucky had, in his own way, loved Steve.  It made Tony feel sick to his stomach.  He was beginning to develop something of a vendetta against tulips.
His stomach squirmed a little.  He'd only met Stark once or twice, but had seen him a couple more times than that.  He was overly-friendly, overly-confident, and one of the most dominant Alphas he'd ever encountered.  Of
Tony walked over to Steve.  He was barefoot, and so was Steve; Tony was shorter by several inches.  He wrapped his arms around Steve and pressed his face into the other's chest.
made him tremble.  He was practically vibrating with pleasure and the effort of staying still. Steve's cock was hard and curved against his stomach but he made no effort to try and touch it.
don't care, if you have a double bond.  You're right about me being hypocritical and treating you like a trophy.  I don't want you as a trophy anymore.  I want you as my mate.  My
"I don't have a doctorate and you can just call me Tony," said Tony, turning out to look at Charlotte.  She was a wispy Alpha with long, straight dark hair. She was perched on a stool sipping a brightly colored drink and when she hopped down she wobbled a little, tipsy.  The odds did not look fantastic for team Alpha.
In any case, he didn't argue.  He didn't want to argue anymore.  He just wanted to hover around Steve protectively, like he should have been doing all this time to begin with.
Tony picked Steve back up, scooping him into his arms.  "Meet you at the hospital!" he said, and hit the jets before Steve could protest to being carried.
"You know, Sex on the Beach isn't merely a fruity cocktail for lightweight girls," said Tony after a moment.
"...Steve?  Running wild?  Nonsense," said Tony.  "He was getting me a drink.  That's allowed. Go ahead, check my phone."  Tony dug into his pocket and showed the other man a text.
"He won't know if you win," said Maggie over the tops of her cards.  "I'll see it, Mike." She tossed a collar into the pile.
Tony knew what Pepper meant about primary Alphaship and although he appreciated Steve's sentiments, he was inclined to disagree.  It wasn't his mark on Steve's neck anymore. Steve could call it whatever he wanted but Tony knew that's what everyone would say.  That he'd failed the test of dominance.  That Steve was no longer entirely "his."
Steve woke with his hands fastened behind his back with some sort of tight plastic string. His clothes were gone.  The air around him was cold.  He could smell the coppery tang of copper.  Was he in a
"That's not a T-rex.  It's a pachycephalosaurus," said Cooper.  He looked up at Steve. "That's Latin for rock-head lizard.  See, he's got a skull on the outside and he could use it to smash into other dinosaurs."  He handed Steve the dinosaur; Lila immediately reached for it, clearly intent on putting it into her mouth.
Tony squeezed Steve's fingers back, then offered him the letter.  "You can open it. Just in case it's booby-trapped or something. ...and don't smoke in the house, you know I hate that smell."  He plucked the cigarette from Steve's lips and tucked it behind his ear.
He whined as Tony licked over the bite on the back of his neck. And then he cried out as his alpha's knot squeezed into him and let out a strangled sound at the stretch and...and...Steve gasped as Tony hit a spot inside of him that made him see stars as he angled his cold just right. "Oh...oh...oh-ah...Tony...T-Tony please..." he begged, trembling around his cock as Tony teased and pleasured at him just right. His whole body sang with pleasure and his thighs quivered. Steve was panting with each thrust, his hips moving pliantly with it. Little, soft breathless and desperate sounds escaped too, his pleasure totally at Tony's mercy. Steve's cock was hard and curved against his abdomen, smearing precum over smooth, pale skin.
"So I woke up... on the base. And Gideon's there, on some sofa, and I'm on the floor and I-- I c-couldn't move. It was like my arms were just to heavy. And he--" Steve pressed his hands against his face and then fisted his fingers in his hair.  He had not felt weak in years.  He had forgotten how terrible it was, to be vulnerable.
Fury stood and handed Natasha the suitcase of syringes.  "My team will escort you back to your home."
"I know.  It was super fucked up," said Tony softly.  "And I felt like such an ass, just because I'm... one of them.  An Alpha, I mean. Steve, I never thought of omegas as lesser people but... I never really thought about them at all.  I ordered around omegas all the time, it was totally normal. Jarvis, you know, I ordered him around all the time. He called me
"I was drawing you," Steve admittedly quietly. "I saw you working and I couldn't help myself. You were so lost in the moment. You can...see it, if you want," he offered, voice soft and expression gentle.  "You should really try and eat some of the pancakes."
. "I'm sorry. I am. But there's nothing I can do here. My hands are tied. Someone is protecting him; I don't know who. But he's completely forbidden from all WSC matters to do with you. And the restraining order is in place, I believe."
But he was also very aware that if they induced a heat he may well be asking for something else he didn't want. Steve swallowed.
He looked around the room.  Lots of people.  Lots of white and chrome.  Someone was moving his head for him, pulling out wires.  He felt the first twinge of panic.
"Tony!  Tony, I got your messages, are you okay?  Oh my God, I'm at the house, your house is a wreck, Tony... what happened?  Where are you?"
"...well... uh, I wanted to go to Julliard if I could get a scholarship but it's about forty thousand dollars," said James.  "I mean, I'll probably know by the end of April and then if, uh, if I can't get a scholarship I'll probably just go to the University of California instead and try to transfer halfway through.  My mom's single and so we don't really have the-- sorry, this is probably super boring. Wow, I can't believe I'm talking to Steve Rogers! You're even taller in real life."
The director (for lack of a better term to call the man in the suit) ignored Steve's insult and repeated, more firmly, "Asset?"
"It didn't hurt." Steve added, not sure how to quell the concern racing through Bucky's eyes. "Don't cry. It's okay. It's okay."
He didn't bother saying any of the rest.  How everyone thought Steve was triple-bonded and how Tony felt like a loser who couldn't keep his omega in check or protect him, how he felt like Steve's side fuck, how much he resented Bucky, how hard monogamy was for him and how much he missed women, and how he hated how
Briefly, he wondered if he could convince Pepper and Happy to just... just let him taste.  Just hold Steve.  Not fuck him.  Just a quick cuddle... one little lick of his back or his neck, just a
Pepper frowned.  "Tony. I'm serious.  Go back to the hotel and invite Steve on a date.  It'll be good for the two of you." Pepper leaned over the table and placed a hand on Tony's arm.  Tony looked down at her pale skin, her slender fingers. "Tony. Both of you have some pretty dark, heavy histories.  It's okay to have problems. It's
"It's probably better for us to get it over with," added Tony reasonably.  "If the paparazzi catches that scar on your neck, you'll never hear the end of it."
The shop was lit up; Tony was welding something.  He'd discarded his shirt but had thrown on a heavy lead apron that came down to his knees and was wearing a pair of welding goggles, at least.  Tony's lab safety was something of a mystery to everyone but Tony.
Steve placed a hand on Tony's shoulder to guide him to the bedroom and warn him before he moved to straddle his waist. He leaned down to whisper in Tony's ear. "Surprise. You can open your eyes," he murmured. Steve was clad in nothing but a navy pair of shorts, the material soft and leaving very little to the imagination. "And yes. They are the original pair."
"Well, just so you know, you could honestly be Barnes's stunt double.  Just get a shave and a haircut, and people would start calling you Bucky!"  She was still smiling. Apparently she was complimenting him.
"Let me guess.  You guys have some stupid omega names that match, like... like Mercedes and Ben, or Pollux and Castor, or Romulus and--"
"It's not a trio. Will people stop calling it that!" Aria huffed in frustration from where she was leaned in the doorway. She held her cigarette loosely between her fingers, a half-eaten burger in her hand.
Tony froze.  There had been a photo.  A man leaning out of a window, smoking and lost in thought, dog tags dangling.  Bucky, who Steve had described as "an old friend." What had ever happened to that photo?
Tony trailed off.  It sounded so sad, so woefully inadequate.  Being around Steve had given Tony a window into a world he'd never thought of, one where omegas lived with the constant awareness that they were second-class citizens.  Jarvis had been one of the "lucky" ones; being Howard Stark's butler had protected him from the worst of it.  But still, now that Tony knew what he knew, he realized Jarvis probably got treated like crap a lot, ordered around and molested and dismissed by Howard's Alpha business partners.  The thought turned Tony's stomach.
Steve stripped and sat down in bed before moving to lie down next to him on his stomach, head propped up in his hands. He listened to Tony intently, expression softening at the man's own sincerity. Steve reached out to tug the pillow to the side and then leaned his head down to press a single kiss to the surface of the arc reactor. He felt the trembling vibration of life against his lips and shivered before his blue eyes flickered back up to Tony's face.
As if sensing he was being watching, he looked over, caught Steve's eye, smiled, and gestured for him to come over.
"Oh. And Malick sent Tony this," Aria said and chucked an envelope across the table. It was personalized stationery. "Well, he sent it to
"I'll give some preliminary statements, if I can get a translator, neither of us speaks French very well," said Pepper.  Tony felt a surge of affection for all three of them for dealing with the aftermath.  His body was sore beyond all reason; he never wanted to move again.
"Is that why your head's so big, Captain?"  Steve didn't have to see Nick to know he was smiling just a little bit.
Tony groaned in reply.  He knew Steve had left not because he'd made any sound, but because his smell disappeared.  Steve smelled... excited. Not happy, exactly. But energized. The way Tony felt when he finally cracked a tough problem.
Tony walked over to the map.  Four different colors. Did that mean anything?  Something caught his eye... many of the pins had tiny paper labels stuck into them, and one in the northeast said,
"I got thrown against a wall. Nearly knocked me out," Steve said quietly. He could still remember the feeling of cold fingers closing around his neck and
Steve felt a strange sensation in his chest. He reached up a hand to his own chest, feeling his own heart beat.
.  And I don't mean you smell like cardamon.  I mean you smell like the kind of guy who would run into a burning building to save a dog.  ...Erskine was an Alpha, wasn't he?  That's why he, and my dad, chose you, I think.  Because you just smell... I don't know...
"--the thing about the new standard infantry rifle is, we were going back to basics, removing the bells and whistles, focusing on a weapon that didn't jam," Tony was explaining below them, popping in a new magazine.  Steve recognized the tapping motion Tony made with the heel of his hand as the same one he used to whack his arc reactor into his chest.  "You can submerge this baby in mud for forty-eight hours and it'll still work when you need it to.  We got rid of the uplink scope, which I know Hammer still uses, but let's be real, that component has a tendency to warp within two campaigns and fuck up your barrel--"
Tony ruffled through the rest of the documents in silence, drinking, brooding, trying not to think about that cold, winding, narrow road where his parents had met their sudden end, or how Jarvis had wept inconsolably at the funeral.  He kept one ear out for Steve, hoping he'd come home, but the hours slid by and his omega were nowhere to be found.
"Or-- or we could visit him together?  Please?" suggested Donner, still hopefully.  His eyes watered again. "Who's taking care of him, Steve?  Who's taking care of Giddy? What's he doing without me? He's had me for years.  He
Tony stared at Steve, every inch of him itching to ask.  He opened his mouth, then closed it, then nodded. "Right.  Squirrel," he agreed tightly.
Then Steve's cell phone started ringing on the beside. He ignored it and let it ring out. Steve tried to stand and then sat back down immediately.
He hadn't really expected Steve's body to accept his mark again, not once Bucky had force-bonded him, so he'd been ecstatic when his had resolved with equal clarity on Steve's neck.  If someone were to look at Steve's neck and see the two marks, they might even think he and Bucky were equal in dominance, which was obviously not the case.
"Your SNL scripts. They've been approved and now you have to learn them for next Saturday and learn how to be funny," she told him. "You can be funny, right?" Aria said, giving him a shit-eating grin over her coffee. He gave her an unimpressed look in return. There was also some stuff in the binder about their trip to England, the hotel, and a suggested itinery...and apparently Peggy's caretakers had already been informed about the visit so they could let her know.  It was weird to think that Peggy needed any help.  Steve couldn't imagine Peggy needing nurses to hold her elbows for her.  She'd always been so strong, stood so straight-backed and upright.
Steve was too distracted, however, to tell DeSoto off. He spotted he waiter with the floppy hair across the room. He met Steve's gaze briefly, then winked, and carried on serving champagne flutes with the politest of smiles on his face.
Tony's mind, without warning, conjured up an image of Phil in the outfit, and he cringed.  "Stupid sexy Coulson."
"I'm glad Steve's heat is now so that he can be around for Project 84," said Tony.  "...you gonna be there?"
Aria hadn't been kidding about all of them trying to outdo each other.  It was like being in a roomful of Tonys. Trey's brother pushed another drink into Steve's hand.
Building and wearing suits made him feel safe, grounded in reality.  But it wasn't just that.  Tony was always improving them, trying to predict the next thing he'd need.  When the suits failed him, he took it personally.  He expected them to be invincible and all-purpose.
As the sun set, many of the kids began to disappear, being taken away by Child Protective Services or paramedics or the police, to be processes, interviewed, examined, placed in foster care, or taken to one of the hostels set up by Project 84.
He pulled out his phone and moved to call Happy. A lovely, sound man. A beta who Steve honestly admired; his optimism and loyalty were something else.
Louis rearranged himself and gestured to the one of the cameras.  "Okay, let's start over-- Steve, what do you have to say to the Alpha defense that being around an omega in heat can cause ferality... that often, Alphas should not be held accountable for their attacks on omegas?  You discussed safe space hostels... let's explore that."
"I'm going to pretend I know what metal music is," Steve said, a half smile on his lips before he polished off a piece of garlic, licking the butter off off of his fingers.
Pepper was waiting for them inside, a cup of coffee nursed and half empty before her. She glanced up and her eyes widened at the sight of them, mostly at Tony looking terrible and Steve looking suspiciously okay. Although his neck was mottled purple. She stood, rushing over to them and taking Tony by the shoulders where he stood. She glanced him up and down and knew what had happened, her lips set in a thin line.
When he got in he could hear the shower going upstairs. Steve certainly needed one himself. He took the steps two at a time, still buzzing from his run as he stepped into their bedroom. He wasn't sure what mood he'd find Tony. There was no emotion so extreme that was pushing through into Steve's conscience, but that didn't mean Tony was necessarily feeling better than he was. Steve hadn't actually seen him awake for over twelve hours, since he left for yoga with Aria. He just certainly hoped the other wasn't going to use any drugs again today... Steve wasn't sure he could really deal with that.
No time to suss that out now.  All that mattered was that Steve was in the midst of four hostiles and that he was pretty sure he'd seen a HYDRA insignia on one of them and he couldn't let his guard down for a minute.  He needed to neutralize the threats, not just to himself, but to Fury and to Agent Thirteen.
"Consider this a very important life lesson 'bout omegas," Steve murmured in Tony's ear bemusedly before he piled into the car seat behind Phil. Phil pulled his seat up to make room for Steve.
The silence that followed was thick and heavy.  Tony looked down.  He was still holding on to Steve's hand, but his thoughts had turned inward.
Steve waved a hand. "It's fine." He wasn't used to having money and he wasn't good at keeping it. Having money and not using it for some sort of change or project made him feel uncomfortable. Within his first six  months of being awake he'd donated tens of thousands of dollars; as quickly as SHIELD gave it to him, he gave it away.
"No moping," Steve repeated, as if that somehow helped him do exactly that. He sighed. Tony was right. He was making this about him again...when it really wasn't. If Donner wanted a baby then he guessed it wasn't the worst scenario in the world. Pregnancy might even do him good.  Unlikely, but he had to have hope.
Tony squeezed Steve's hand comfortingly, knowing that Steve was obsessing over Donner's fate.  "Hey. It's only a couple more days until Rhodey'll bring him. He'll be okay, Steve. We already booked the meeting with Gene and a hotel room and everything.  Don't worry. ...you gonna draw this?" He touched the orchid's dark petals.
"And...at the end of the day." Steve ran his long fingers through Tony's hair. "We'll still come home together." He nipped at his bottom lip. "And I'll still kneel for you. Do whatever you want, for
Across the room, Tony had gotten up, dizzily, and Steve felt a heavy pang of relief that he was okay, mixed with desire to go to him.
look impressed at the idea. Sure, he'd sung on a New Year's...to a room full of drunk people. That was different.
"Can we just... not do this now?" He pried his arms gently from her grasp to squeeze her hands instead. "Tony's had a terrible afternoon and he needs me." He sighed when he saw all the glasses lining the bar already and felt that tug of guilt in his gut. Like Steve should be stopping him. He reminded himself that Tony was his own person, that Steve didn't get to make those sorts of decision for him.  "Let's just go save Sam. He looks as uncomfortable as hell," Steve said and with that he peeled away.
No one got a good look at anything because the lights were dim and Tony immediately flung himself into the room and collided with another man and in an instant, the two were on the floor snarling and writhing and snapping.
"Not now, Happy!" snapped Pepper, tearing a piece of cloth off the arm of her dress and dumping a bottle of water on it.  She pressed it onto Tony's head.  "Tony, calm down, you're fine... you just need to relax, okay, everything is taken care of..."
"Those experiments Zola did on the men at Azzano.  He... he had some sort of serum, like me.  He didn't die when he felt.  They took him and froze him and they only woke him up to use him.  They... they practically turned his head inside-out.  Mentally he's just--"  Steve couldn't continue.
"I, er, yeah...it was a couple of years ago," Donner looked at the floor.  “But that was a long time ago. He wouldn’t let another Alpha touch me now.  I’m good. He wouldn’t bet me again.”
Tony simply grabbed his and cracked his head into the wall.  The man moaned. Tony cracked his head against the wall a second time, and he was silent.
"Oh, Hendrix, definitely, that's the best version.  Thanks, Jarv."  Tony tilted his beer back, finished it off, and then tossed it onto the pool deck with a light clink.
"I can order takeout with your earlier specifications," JARVIS offered from above, speaking out. It was almost sinister, Steve thought, the way he recorded each piece of information offered.
Steve didn't know how long they say there like that. But eventually the tight feeling in his chest began to wane, so he hoped it was for Tony too. He rocked him gently, strong arms keeping him warm. Steve didn't know what else to say other than reassurances. He didn't know what was up in the first place.
"...do you want to still use the master bedroom or... or do you want to, y'know, have separate rooms?" asked Tony hesitantly, scratching his beard.
Pepper blinked and her ears went pink with the frankness of Phil's answer.  "Something I can make in the kitchen, I meant."
Tony smiled when Steve called him old.  Steve may have born in 1918, but he was physiologically half Tony's age, and he looked it.  Tony didn't mind.  He generally dated people much younger than him anyway.  He had a rule against dating anyone older than him ever since he'd been with an incredibly hot MILF who had called out Howard's name.
Suddenly he was thinking about how Richard had said leaving the knot in increased the chances of pregnancy, and he was panicked.  He wiggled his hips, hoping to slide out, but it was absolutely impossible.
"That's why we're here," said Jeff.  "The Horseshoe Society is volunteering sixty full-time coordinators."
Another weird nonsense word.  Similar, but different.  That was the word he'd been called, a word that had been carried to him on a brisk spring breeze over a field of tulips and it had hurt, pierced his heart to hear it.  When was the last time he'd heard
The waiter, an omega himself, looked like he was struggling not to find the situation funny.  "...and for you, Captain?" he asked Steve directly, mouth twitching with a barely-suppressed grin.
"I was trying to get away, but he wouldn't let go of my hand," Steve said quickly in explanation. "I think....I think he might have been hitting on me. Or just trying to piss off Tony. I'm so sorry Virginia, I just didn't know what to do. I panicked. I didn't want to be rude."
The drama with Donner had made him, at least temporarily, forget that one of his rockets had bombed a hospital in Wakanda.  Guilt washed over him.  Not just about the civilian deaths, but also for forgetting so quickly.
Steve was about to offer his hand out to Danielle to shake when prawns were shoved into his hand. She had bright green eyes that pierced right through him. Her presence reminded Steve of Natasha. He certainly didn't want to get on her bad side.
." He said, creating little quotation marks in the air. He kind of felt bad for not getting the environment stuff so much. The concept of recycling was wild to him; society wasted so much compared to the forties, and the
"There are many ways in which an Alpha must assert his dominance in the home," she continued, her voice booming through out the room. "Most importantly, you must assert their place in the bedroom--"
"Yes," Aria said, shoving a water bottle into his hand. Steve took it and downed it heavily and Aria tutted when some of it got onto his jacket. It would dry before he had to go out on stage anyway. He was practically shaking with excitement.
Tony had long suspected that this would be a shitty conversation, because he knew that Steve liked kids.  He'd seen Steve's face when the Walkers had handed him the baby. He knew how omegas were.
They went to a small, local cafe so thankfully no one had stopped them to ask for a selfie or autograph. Steve was just in gym leggings and a hoodie. He wasn't really looking his best. And he wasn't really in the mood for interacting with strangers. He was just glad to hang out with Aria and chat about nothing.
." Steve caught his Alpha's wrists in a gentle grip. "Let the boring man speak and then we can go back upstairs." Tony seemed to be enjoying Steve holding his wrists together far too much; Tony grinned at him, manically.  Steve's touch was hot and firm, a wave of heat went through his groin and his cock twitched in his shorts.  Steve's blush only worsened and he cleared his throat again before glancing over to Sitwell, who did
That was probably everyone.  Tony was certain that Google would be clogged with inquiries about omegas and that the library was probably experiencing a stampede of Alphas who were suddenly very, very interested in omega rights.
Tony let Steve drag him onto the couch; he was feeling irritated that Steve had destroyed the chip because he could have probably traced it back to its source.  But he was also irritated at himself; Rhodes was right.  A bug getting into the house was a huge security no-no.  Tony's mail was always checked before it came in, but of course no one would think of checking the orchids; who would be evil enough to bug a congratulatory bonding symbol?  That was like putting anthrax in baby formula.  It was unthinkable.
been a fun one but Steve really didn't feel like he ought to make a habit of it.  Aria would kill him.
"Hey," Steve appeared by Tony's side. He put a hand on the other's arm; his Alpha looked a little lost...perhaps a little drunk. The rush into the 'den' had been strange, the younger omegas especially excited and giggly. Steve had hung back with Hal, not so eager to get in that they would have pushed through the throngs of omegas. When he headed into the room, finally, he could see Donner between his mate and Tony. And Gideon looked furious.
Phil eyed Sitwell through the one-way glass, sipping on coffee from a paper cup.  "We don't know that he knows anything, yet," he said evenly.
"You ever want kids, Clint?" asked Tony suddenly.  He knew Clint and Natasha had bonded in unusual circumstances, one not dissimilar to his and Steve's.  They were scent-mates, compatible on an instinctual level, but biologically infertile. It was nearly impossible for omega men to impregnate Alpha women, and, of course, Alpha females had no way of breeding an omega for whelps.
"This guy's the greatest!" said James, grabbing Steve's hand and leading him out onto the pool deck.
Weren't heats supposed to have a couple of lulls?  Tony wasn't an expert but he was pretty sure there were typically a few periods where the omega calmed down at least enough to get some water, go to the bathroom, carry on a conversation that didn't include pleas for more dick.
"What about before, your other Alpha, huh?  Weren't you good for him? Did he let you go?" asked DeSoto.  Everyone knew Steve had been previously, or was currently, bonded to another Alpha.  "...is it hard having two Alphas? If they give you two different orders do you pick the one with the stronger bond or what?"  He seemed genuinely interested. "...Mr. Stark isn't very dominant," he added, unnecessarily.
He felt hurt and betrayed and angry, and he could feel Steve, feeling hurt and rejected... and yet, despite every awful, negative emotion...
Tony pushed himself to his feet and went to the bedroom to drag Steve's sheets into the living room and make a nest on the couch.  Tony had always had only two modes: wired, manic, and restless... or sinfully lazy.  He felt that the events of the last few days entitled him to a few sinfully lazy ones.  The only real problem was the lack of alcohol.  He was tempted to see if he could steal another bottle off Sean-Down-The-Hall, but Sean had creeped him out a little last time, so he decided against it.
"...Steve," he said, smiling groggily.  He reached up to run a hand through his hair.  His hair was a mess, and jaw had a faint five o'clock shadow.  He yawned widely and reached up to scratch the scars around the arc reactor.  He glanced down at his hands; they were trembling a little.
The crowded parted like the Red Sea for Moses as Steve moved through it, Arcadia, Taylor, and Trey floating after him.  He caught a glimpse of Tony in the crowd, holding a martini, his arm around the waist of a young Asian woman wearing an eye-popping pink dress that matched her fingernails.  Tony, like Trey, was wearing sunglasses indoors; he was having an animated conversation with a man who was possibly some sort of actor and who Steve probably should have known, but didn't.  Even though everyone at the party was part of the Hollywood elite, Steve had heard of only a few of them. Most, like Trey, seemed to find this incredibly refreshing.
He eyed Steve with interest and got a small, perky smile.  "You look amazing. Like you're going to an audition for
Steve needn't have bothered asking JARVIS to call for Tony; Tony was already hurrying down the streets, alerted to the drop in Steve's stomach.  "Steve?  What happened?" he asked.
"Right. Come on," Steve murmured and moved to take Tony's arm in his. It wouldn't be obvious, but Steve could still help him walk like this. Tony was right, though, about it being better to go home.  All Steve really wanted was to be back in their bed and away from all this. There was no need to be mothered over by doctors. They wanted and needed each other right now. They were still recently bonded, in their honeymoon phase, and being in a hospital bed felt wrong.
Tony may have been drunk but a lifetime of dealing with the media had given him lightning-fast camera reflexes.  He was up in a second, smiling, arm around Steve, holding up his classic peace sign. A camera flashed.
Steve was shaking. Perhaps it was from the starvation but it was mostly from upset. "Buck!  Please... don't make this harder than it already is. I'm trying to save you."
"Steve," said Tony with sudden seriousness.  He set his plate aside and reached out, placing a hand on either side of Steve's face and looking deep into his eyes.  "When you say that there's only one way to find out... look.  I know what you're thinking.  But Steve..."  He took a deep breath and then sighed out.  "...Steve, those psychic phone lines are all fake.  Miss Cleo
His head poked back up over the surface of the water and he watched Tony with a mischievous sort of glint in his eyes. "Well, don't you wanna swim?"
Tony nodded, once; better than nothing.  "Okay.  Okay, good.  Where's my jack hammer?  I gotta build a super collider.  Start up a new project file, index it under Particle Accelerator, use my private server.  Can you get into CERN and yank their blueprints?  I need that, but it's gotta fit in the house.  But we can knock down some walls, we're in remodel mode--"
is kind of an exaggeration.  I mean, growing up, we had staff.  Not that many, though.  Like, maybe six?  Jarvis did so much for us that we didn't really have many, other than the cook and my nannies and some gardeners.  After he died, it felt weird to try to replace him.  So it's just the usual maintenance crew around here, y'know, people to do the laundry and trim the hedges and junk.  No one
This was the first time in years he'd done anything even remotely like the old stuff he'd used to enjoy, and he sure as hell wasn't going to ruin it by admitting to Steve that the idea of calling him
Phil produced a needle from a small case in his jacket pocket. Presumably to try and stop Steve's heat. Gently, Phil took one of Steve's arms and trailed his fingers around, finding a good vein.
"--that's good.  Just like that. Now the next time you feel a contraction, I want you to push, okay?  One big, nice push for me."
"I thought it was very brave of you to tell everyone," Steve murmured, staring down at the red liquid in the bottom of the Doctor Who mug he'd been given.
"This... isn't normal, right? He shouldn't have cold flushes. That's not a thing, is it?" Aria asked. "Someone Google it!"
have feelings for Steve.  But that was impossible.  Steve was an omega.  Tony didn't really run with omegas.  He felt it was sort of pathetic and old-fashioned, Alphas and omegas, pair-bonding.  He'd once told Pepper that and she'd laughed.
He got up, straight-backed, jaw tight, and walked out with the incredible self-control and discipline worthy of a super soldier.  There was no yelling.  No scene.  Tony would have felt more comfortable with a scene, with Steve reacting with anger.  But there was only cold disappointment.  He strode out without looking back.
Steve felt a chill run down him, like he was being plunged back into icy cold water. It was like he was drowning. No...it couldn't be… It couldn't be that Bucky was suffering all that time and Steve did nothing just because he'd assumed Bucky didn't want him. Steve felt that emptiness- that was because the bond was gone surely? Not because that was how Bucky was
don't know. This is the day where everything goes to shit for you, do you understand? This is the day," Steve whispered, walking right up to her. "That you realise that everything you
"I don't think wanting equality is controversial. The charity is an idea that revolves around support for omegas and tackling the repression we face. If people feel threatened by that, they seriously need to ask themselves why."
"It's not all great," warned Natasha.  "Mother Jones is already asking what it says that 'Captain America' jumped into bed with one of the world's best-known weapons designers."
"I was bonded to you," Steve said tentatively, not sure how Bucky would take it. If he would even believe him. "And now I'm bonded to Tony. He bit over your mark.  But now the bond is fading. He's been letting it go. I stopped feeling him as much.  I think he’ll eventually sever it."
They both knew 'his' room was the one full of drawings. It was Steve's space, something that was just for
"I felt bad about the distance as soon as you did it," Steve murmured. "But I was angry and stressed and then...then I had to focus on doing the right thing. I hope I did it in the end."
"I'm the real Captain America," he assured Nate, walking up to his bed. He inspected the drip (he was familiar with this sort of stuff) and carefully removed it from the IV box.
, anyway.  It had already occurred to Tony that, back in the 1930s, when Steve was only 95 pounds, he would have felt a lot like those women.  And Tony had to admit, he understood why Steve hadn't been mated.  He would have been terrified to mate Steve if he were little and sick.  Mating was rough and raw and it would be easy to hurt-- hell, even to kill-- him.  Fortunately, Tony had only ever known Steve like this.  His natural fury toward Steve's old Alpha prevented him from feeling too much sympathy for him.
The only way Steve wasn't going to punch a hole in the wall was if he got this poor kid out of the ward and away from Melinda.
"You... you should get the phone!" he panted.  He was sweating, literally sweating.  The room reeked like pheromones, the same subtle, musky flavor he'd tasted in Monaco, right before Steve went into heat.
"But Ms. Potts informed me to route official calls through," protested JARVIS.  "In light of recent events at the Expo--"
"Come on," he said, giving Steve a little push.  "Let's go. ...when we kiss at midnight, I bet we'll be on the front page tomorrow," he added with a small smile.
"The serum makes me pretty hard to keep with," Steve said, keeping his voice soft. "It's hard to keep me satisfied."
"I'm good too, thanks," Steve hummed and their waiter nodded, saying he'd return with the bill in a few minutes. Steve reached forward to squeeze Tony's fingers gently.
Steve sighed.  “I’ll send the board a message to let them know you’re stuck in traffic,” he said reluctantly.  “...and I’m
"Ah. Of course," Richard nodded. "Now Mr Stark, if you'll just--" He sighed when Tony curled over Steve impossibly further. "You're going to have to let me take a look at him."
"Show me now," repeated Tony.  He was going to die of curiosity now that Steve had alluded to it being something sexual.
"Okay," he sighed and moved forward to run a hand through Tony's hair, pushing it back from his forehead. "But at least get dressed first.  And... I'm gonna stay in here, maybe. I don't know if I want to watch. I don't really want to see you like that."
This was different than before. Steve could feel everything in vivid and burning detail. Before it had been like being high, the thrill of being mated sending his mind into overdrive. But now he was so aware of
"Aw, c'mon, the guy loves all the stuff," said Tony with a helpless shrug.  He and Carlie boarded the plane.  Panic and hurt was coursing through Tony, and he felt bad because Steve might be having a flashback or something in a SHIELD bathroom.  But Steve had told him not to worry and Tony didn't want to baby him, so he shoved his mate's feelings toward the back of his mind and focused instead on getting himself a drink from his private cocktail bar.
"I hate when you get all philosophical on my ass.  Why can't you just tell me what I want to hear?"grumbled Tony.
Tony plucked a glass of champagne off a passing silver plate being borne by an exhausted-looking waiter.
"What kind of breaks should be taking?" Steve asked a little awkwardly. "Like...every few hours, or...?"
"...ah," said Gleason.  He paused at the back of Tony's neck.  Tony's whole body was noticeably stiff.  Gleason had the grace not to ask about the mark and he moved on, poking Tony's ribs.  Tony squirmed a little and snorted. Pepper looked at him incredulously.
Tony let Steve drop him into the bed, only because he was turning inward, letting the information sink in.
He let the medic re-dress the wound, keeping his legs pressed together except when absolutely necessary.  The rest of the flight was made in silence.
"I was kind of hoping for something that wasn't metal," Steve said. He didn't like metal on his neck, surprisingly enough. It kind of brought back bad memories...memories of a metal arm pressed against his neck in a small cage whilst Steve screamed at Bucky not to hurt him. "It's...cold," he provided as an explanation.
Trey shrugged. "They basically do what it says on the tin. They suppress... like everything that makes you an omega. They just take away everything that makes you
"  Tony pointed to the model.  "Look!"  Excitement was creeping into his voice.  "Look, look at the sculpture in the middle... look, see, it's an atom, see how the little electrons... see... it's your shield, Steve, look.  The building.  I threw the building, and it went into orbit.  It was spinning.  Look.  The
"He didn't mean that, Steve.  He's drunk," said Pepper, who had been watching the alcohol level in Tony's body slowly approach the bottom.  She set a comforting hand on Steve's shaking shoulder.
"Thanks, dear," Steve told him, voice sweet and proper before he walked in front of Tony and into the main lobby.
"Oh Jesus," muttered Aria as she crossed the wide, open living room (still covered in orchids) and peered into the kitchen.
Tony misinterpreted this.  "...why would I have candles?" he snapped.  "Steve, open your present now."
Finally, he managed to tear his eyes away from Tony long enough to finish typing in the film name. When it popped up he clicked it and then dropped the remote before settling back against the sofa comfortably with Tony in his lap. This felt good, comfortable,
"We've met a few of the councilmembers before," said Natasha.  "Fury came up with the Avengers Initiative about two years ago and they lost it when they saw Clint was on the short list..."
"No. I never saw the grave," Steve said softly, setting his phone down. "There were  a lot of graves waiting for me out there when I came back. Nothing really appealed to me about seeing them. All the Howling Commandos too... but I'd like to go see Howard's grave with you," he breathed. "The... Statue of Liberty? Sure. Why not? I guess I have to do all the tourist stuff too, eventually..."
Tony didn't have a scratch on him but Steve knew that fights weren't that simple. Tony had killed people, and was frustrated and pained by Steve's heat. He didn't know how the other would cope with it; Steve knew he'd killed people before in the suit, but as far as he knew that was when he was escaping a cave of his torturers, not invading a secret lab. Steve hoped he would be okay.  Now wasn't the time it ask.  The two of them needed distance, time to process, and currently both were in silent agreement that they'd rather fuck than talk.
Tony was only half-conscious of being lifted and dried and tucked into bed.  He mumbled sleepily as he felt Steve fussing around with the blankets, making him comfortable.  He cracked an eye open, looking for his omega.  Steve was standing by the bed, naked, carved from marble, staring down at a phone that seemed too small in his hands.  He was reading something.  Tony felt a surge of pride and affection for Steve; reading an article on a cell phone.  How quickly he was adapting.
Tony felt relief flood through him.  They had been promised a non-hostile crowd and although the reporters certainly didn't seem hostile, per se, they were pretty unabashedly prying.  Of course, considering Tony and Steve were public figures, he shouldn't have been surprised.
Steve shivered and couldn't fight back anoise when he felt he wet drag of Bucky's tongue against his neck. "But...but this is what they want," he whispered. "If we do this, if we don't fight... then we can never go home."
Steve knew that he was supposed to be polite and calm, the perfect employee to both Pepper Potts and Tony Stark.  That was his cover.  And being a subservient omega was the best cover in the world.  Fury had sent him on a mission and he intended to complete it.  He arrived to work every day dressed in crisp shirts and smart dress trousers; he looked the part.  He got Pepper everything she needed, and more.  But there was one problem: Tony Stark.  Steve found him annoying: his selfishness, his playboy attitude, his brazenness... everything, really.  Sure, he was clever, but Steve wasn’t sure about bringing him into the Avengers Initiative.  Yet.  Not that it was his decision, though he made a point of citing Tony's many personality defects in all of his reports.  He was tempted to argue with him directly on more than one occasion and had had to stop himself.  Last night he almost had.  They disagreed a lot on a lot of omega rights issues.  For a man living in 2010, Tony was shockingly conservative.  It was probably due to the daddy issues Steve had picked up on, his complicated relationship with Howard, who had dabbled in the omega rights "hysteria" of his time… but it was the rights themselves that the two had half-argued about, not the history.
He smiled a little at Tony calling him the best omega. Obviously his opinion was bias but it still felt good to hear it.
"The last thing in the world that guy needs is an espresso," muttered Clint to Natasha; they had been watching Tony through the hole in the ceiling for the last couple of hours.  Tony had most of the materials laying around; he'd been putting them together with an energy that belied his sickness.  His shop was unrecognizable.
party.  But he wasn't there and everyone was still laughing, drinking, dancing, joking.  He wasn't the center of the universe.  He wasn't anything.  Cosmically, he was... insignificant.  Did that make his impending death better, or worse?  Tony couldn't tell.  His heart was pounding.  His mouth was dry.
Natasha flashed Tony a deadly look over her shoulder before she started up the car. "Black Widow, actually. But I like Nut Cracker.  Coulson, is it too late to change my codename?" she hummed, tone overbearingly innocent as she took them out of the diner’s driveway. "I read your report," she said casually, to Steve.
Tony worried, momentarily, that he might be hurting Steve, then remembered that it was Captain America and he probably couldn't have gripped his arm too hard if he tried.
Bucky frowned when Steve told him not to engage and then said they weren't mating.  What the hell? How dare Steve, an omega, give
The idea of Bucky as an old man was terrifying.  Almost as terrifying as the idea of Bucky being HYDRA's prisoner, of them experimenting on him, trying to use him to... to get into Steve's brain, to exploit his bond.
"I'm up," he announced, which was a blatant lie.  He was still sprawled across the bed in his shorts, unshowered and very much asleep.  Tony had learned to say "I'm up" very convincingly, no matter how tired or half-asleep he was, thanks to Pepper, who had learned the only way to actually guarantee that he was up was to yank the sheets off of him and, in extreme cases, physically roll him out of bed and throw clothes at him.
"Yeah," said Steve.  "...they'll wait."  He normally didn't like to keep people waiting.  But considering that they had stopped by unannounced and he had just been mating with his Alpha, he couldn't feel too bad.  It was an inconvenient time and their own fault for not calling ahead.
"I'm getting the captain!"  A small Asian girl shouldered past the crowd toward the main room, where a solid block of bodies was dancing, or at least pulsing drunkenly, to the music.  "Steve-- I mean, Captain Rogers-- hey, Steve!"
, he thought grumpily.  It was like the universe was conspiring to get him to go to that dumb support group.  Tony didn't want to for a lot of reasons, chief among them because that he felt like the other Alphas there would hate him.  It was
Rhodey looked between Steve and Tony and then Aria and sighed. "I thought you were supposed to be the
"...the kids hear fine," said Clint after a moment.  Of all the questions Steve had, for some reason, Clint chose to answer that one.  "I wasn't born deaf. My dad drank, and... I'm an omega." He bounced Lila on his lap playfully and offered a small, almost apologetic smile.
"I'm gonna go surfing now," he announced, fighting to open the door and practically falling out of the car.
Or perhaps it was simpler even than that.  Perhaps Tony just wanted to show off.  There were going to be quite a few celebrities at the Prix, and Tony loved bragging about the suit.  The case was eye-catching, shining with a metallic, racecar red.
When one character was just stood in the corner, motionless, it was sinister as hell and Steve was fisting a hand in Tony's shirt before he knew what he was doing. He'd never watched a modern horror film before; Steve hadn't realised he could be so freaked out by something that logically he
"Tag me in that!" said the other girl on the counter, jumping into the photo and throwing up a pair of bunny ears like Tony always did.
Hal had clearly noticed Steve had drifted off already. She patted his arm. "Sorry, I know this is weird.  You alright?"
Dani snorted despite herself, unable to suppress her laughter.  "Yes, Mr. Stark," she managed, giggling.
Steve moved to sit down, grabbing the Nutella and smearing his pancakes in it. He couldn't exactly get fat so he made the most of it. "It's supposed to be a surprise," he sighed. "But fine.  I'm singing
Downstairs, Steve settled onto the couch with a tablet and a cup of coffee.  (Even if caffeine didn't do much for him anymore, he still liked the taste and the warmth.)  SHIELD was already combarding him with files, and those files sent his head spinning. Experiment after experiment was recorded, but the details were hazy (which explained SHIELD wanting to get in there). All the names were blurred out but when Steve saw sentences like
So every Saturday Steve would come home, tired and frustrated. Tony was never around for the main event so it didn't drive him crazy like before, but he could still smell Steve's post-heat when he returned home. All he had to do was walk into the house and soon he had his Alpha falling into bed with him. It was oddly sweet.
Steve stared at DeSoto wide-eyed and horrified. He was quiet for a long time after he finished the story and couldn't understand why DeSoto had such unwavering loyalty to an Alpha who had
Steve's phone started ringing on the bedside table. He reached over. He picked it up. And then he promptly threw it against the wall and the ringing stopped. Steve didn't say a word, he just curled up back against Tony's side contently.
But right now, you merely look great."  He smiled at Steve.  Sitting on the counter-top, he had gained a few inches on Steve.  He smiled down at the blond and reached out to touch his cheek, aware that Steve had moved into the space between his legs and was smirking teasingly at him.  He was still flushed from his run.
As he descended the stairs, however, he spotted Steve through the indoor waterfall.  About half of Tony's vast living room was covered in a rainbow of orchids, predominantly white but also pinks and yellows, and a few odd ones, a blue one here and a purple one there.  Steve was standing by the window, staring out of it; the vase of tulips that Tony had moved behind a couple of orchids had been pulled out (
He reached for Steve's hand, and Steve took it, and the two exchange a gooey-eyed look of pure love.  Or at least, lust.
Carter looked down at the gun.  It was a newer model, one of Hammer Industries' SIR semi-autos.  And it was jammed.
Pepper stared at him in bafflement.  "...you know what a gynecologist is, right?  A doctor for women?  An omegologist is a doctor for male omegas."
"Pick a team?  We could do math versus humanities, but I think we'd mop the floor with you guys," said Tony, elbowing Callum.  His grin widened, clearly pleased that Tony was suggesting he and Stark would be on the same team.
"Karpov isn't here," Steve said quietly, still watching Bucky tensely. Even when he moved to take a drag from his cigarette, Steve couldn't relax. He was ready to defend himself in seconds. Even though Bucky had resisted and wasn't currently conforming... the effect of that command had been alarming and it had reminded Steve of the complexity of the situation.
It was common knowledge that Alphas got overly obsequious during pre-heats, while omegas got nest-focused.  Some more than others. A nest could be anything from a room to a bed to an elaborate shrine of blankets and papers.  Steve, at least, didn't seem like the destructive type, unlike Phil. If Tony had the where-with-all, he would have been thankful that Natasha peeled Clint out of the kitchen before he could decide the top of his fridge was a good nesting spot.
," Doctor McCloud said, sounding agitated as she promptly pulled Steve's shirt overhead. His torso had a few bruises from the suit, pink and purple in places from where Vanko's suit had got a hit in. "Right. Trousers off. And you- stay calm."
Being able to compartmentalize Steve Rogers and Captain America was a critical part of Steve maintaining his sanity.
drank, it was... precious.  Tony rubbed his thumb on Steve's back, looking into his eyes.  Steve could never understand how important it was to feel... big.  Or maybe he could. But for Alphas, there was an added dimension. Tony had a mate to protect.  The fact that his mate didn't need protecting didn't register to him, at least not instinctually.
Tony looked at the waiter.  "...Steve will have..." he began, "...his order taken."  He leaned back with clear enjoyment.
Pepper was dialing Dr. Gleason and muttering curses under her breath, most of them directed at Tony.
Steve and Tony were given a whole tent to themselves. It wasn't much admittedly, but it was something. There was a small bed very low to the ground in the center and the walls and roof were only just high enough that Steve didn't have to duck his head down. During the night they both fell out of bed a few times because they weren't used to such a small cot. But Steve thought it was pretty cute when he woke up to see a grumpy looking Tony staring at him from the floor with awful bed hair at 1am.
Tony found it baffling that Richard and David, a conservative Alpha and a progressive omega, respectively, appeared to be friends.  Or at least colleagues who respected each other.
He was lost enough in thought that he wandered into the living room and kitchenette in his towel, forgetting all about DeSoto.  He winced a little at the way those big, chocolate--brown eyes turned to him, and he resisted the urge to cover up his arc reactor.  He had grown used to wearing a towel slung low on his hips around Steve. That was how he'd worn towels before Afghanistan. Afterwards, he had always worn them under the arms.  But Steve had turned the arc reactor into a thing of beauty. Also, it was no longer slowly killing him, so he felt a bit more comfortable about it. But he didn't like when strangers ogled.
, and they put on a pretense for their Alpha. Even Donner was smiling at the table, clearly with his own little group of friends.  (Donner and his friends were among the omega who refused to drink.)
Steve spent the rest of the afternoon putting up tents. It was hard work, but not hard enough to make Steve break a sweat. Some of the guys, who were actually bigger than Steve, went wide-eyed when he started lifting up seven-foot poles of steel like they were nothing. The tents would be sturdy, at least. Steve wondered what sort of accommodation the kids were in now...
"Till the end of the line," mumbled Tony automatically, half-asleep.  He reached up to take Steve's hand on his chest and move it away from the arc reactor and the scarring that surround it.
Steve wasn't shaking or anything like that. He looked perfectly calm. But there was a fire in his eyes.
Frankly he thought Steve's prayer was incredibly depressing.  It was suitable for a war prayer, he guessed, but damn, it was morbid.  Also, how dare Steve mourn Howard. It was Howard who mourned Steve. It was Howard who was always talking about Steve as "the only good thing I've ever done" and "my greatest creation" and all that shit.  And how come he'd never mentioned Steve was an omega? Did he think it was funny or something how Tony emulated him as a perfect Alpha ideal? Maybe
Oh, God, no.  Scars meant hurt; scars meant injury.  Tony couldn't stand the thought of his omega being injured, not right now.  But the way Natasha was saying
Happy pulled a flask out of his jacket and offered it to him.  Pepper pinched her nose again, looking like she was in desperate need of a flask herself.
Tony watched Steve blush and felt a surge of affection for him.  He wanted to gather Steve into his arms and cuddle him, protect him, shelter him.
. He stared down at Tony's hands around his, the skin a tinge darker, fingers a little thicker and shorter and rougher from his work. Steve had always had feminine hands before. 'Artist's hands,' Bucky used to joke when Steve pouted as his fingers couldn't quite reach a particular chord on a piano. Even after the serum he still felt like he'd sort of kept them; sure his hands were big and strong but the fingers were slender. Even with the serum, his status hid in the details.
"...bye, Steve," said Tony, shouldering Maria out of the way to give Steve a quick kiss.  "Don't do anything I wouldn't."
are ones that Tony pissed off recently and blue are ones we're on good terms with, make sure he gets in a sound bite with any of the blue ones, they're alphabetically ordered, yellow is secondary to blue, only talk to yellow if you've already covered blue, make sure Tony doesn't go near anyone from
He spread his arms with a look of smug triumph.  "Ta-da!  Sober as a judge!  Would you let me lick you if I wasn't your boss?  If I fired you, right now, would you feel more comfortable?"
The minute they were inside Tony's house, Steve picked him up without waiting for permission. It made his ribs twinge a little but it was only a short walk upstairs to the bedroom.
"How you doing, how it's shaking, buddy?" asked Justin, grin widening.  "You’re not the only rich guy here with a fancy car.  Just met your new boy, he's great... oh, and you know, this is Miss Everhart. I call her Christine, she's from
collared you, you'd be into it.  But we both know that you don't want it from me, and I don't want to hurt you.  Because I really care about you. Really love you. And even if I'm a shitty Alpha who can't stand up for you, or fight for you, or anything like that... I can at least say I won't ever hurt you.  That's... something. Literally the least I can do. But it's something."
"...because you're going to meet one of the leaders of the World Security Council and bringing a weapon of mass destruction might send the wrong message," said Pepper, raising an eyebrow.
Rhodey left only after Tony had dragged him down to the shop and began weighing him down with devices.  Rhodey let him pin microphones onto his clothes and agreed to wear contacts that clearly had circuits in them, but balked when Tony heaved up a huge needle.
?" Steve was so far removed from the captain on the battlefield it was eerie. The man who knew just how far he could bend back a knee without breaking it was gone and a shivering omega who was desperate for validation was in his place.
Slowly, Steve produced a smoke grenade from his pocket. He sent Tony a small nod, waiting for one in return (Tony gave Steve a small, tight nod.) before he lobbed it across the street.
He tried to apologize for failing and also for displaying pain, but all he managed was a weak wheeze.  His mouth was filled with blood.
Can you forward all of my fan mail and stuff?  Oh!  And call Rolling Stone. I'll let them interview us- they've always been good to me.  We're also willing to do Larry King, The Late Show, and Ellen."
Steve paused at the bottom, gaze dragging over the ocean of flowers in the living room. Before he knew what he was doing he was pushing aside some of the orchids to pick up the tulips. He gently turned the flowers over in his hands; he smelt them and closed his eyes. They'd made Tony so uneasy but to Steve they were the least imposing - far more affordable and far less pretentious than the orchids. They were flowers that he recognised from the fields and roadsides of muddy, war-trodden France. He sighed softly and set them back down.
Banksy nodded, having nothing funny to say and Boswell looked a little sobered up, even with the hat on his head.
"Mine," Steve murmured and reached up to touch Tony's face softly before he moved to straddle Tony's lap. He curled his hands over the curves of his shoulders, letting the curve of his ass brush against Tony's arousal.  "...after this I'm gonna wanna sleep," Steve murmured and nudged against the curve of his jaw. "And then when we wake up it will have started. Properly."
"Like I dragged a lot of people into a mess I have no means of getting them out of. So not great, admittedly."
He grabbed himself another drink.  With Pepper and Steve occupied, now was the time to get himself good and trashed.
Tony couldn't imagine seeing Steve in battle but he was sure it would be fine.  Maybe.  Probably.  He didn't mind seeing Steve hurting someone else, at least.  So he was halfway there.  And once he saw Steve kick ass in his field test (Tony was sure Steve would kick ass), he would be reassured that Steve could handle himself.
"Okay. I'm glad your suit is working better but you really do need to work on your health and safety Tony," Steve with a fond sigh. If Tony was happy, then he was happy, but he didn't like the thought of a dozen pieces of metal all flying at Tony from ten different directions which no real protection in place. The helmet to the back of the head was a clear example of said fact.
It was too much. It was all too much. Oh God. His vision span a little, and then there was a hand on shoulder.  He whirled around and very nearly punched the person who had touched him.
He should probably having a drink, some water or-- he realized it had been at least a day since his last drink, no, two days; his last drink had been the scotch he'd shared with Boswell.  Then, yesterday, they'd been fucking non-stop, and today, well... more fucking. Thirty-six hours. No wonder he was anxious. He was trembling and he knew, in part, that was withdrawal setting in.  His blood sugar was probably low, too. The only food he'd had was the fruit Steve had fed him earlier.
Or maybe just where ever he wanted.  He was alive, renewed, and in love, and the horizon was his for the taking.
Steve bit his bottom lip. "Fine." He said. "But Tony has the right to turn it off whenever he deems necessary."
"She's like obsessed with both you guys," Derick (her boyfriend) said, grinning. Jane hit his arm, turning a little red.
Steve was ready to get out of here already. He didn't want to stay another night, especially not with DeSoto lingering around.
And information... that had been the whole point of the mission in the first place.  Natasha had gotten something but they didn't know what yet. Tony was hoping it was enough to make it all worth it.  If not, then they'd murdered over a dozen people for no reason whatsoever. And now that they'd gone on the offensive, HYDRA was probably going to beef up security, making any future missions a hell of a lot harder.
"Steve!" Natasha slipped out of the driver's seat, hurried around the other side of the car and grabbed his wrist.  He stopped, even though it would have been perfectly easy to wrench away from her.
Steve came with a cry, his eyes fluttering shut as his body shuddered and came undone over Tony's hand and his own chest. He rode out his orgasm with rolls of his hips, clenching around Tony tightly as he did so, encouraging him to finish too. "Oh my- oh my god..." he let out a ragged breath, hardly able to comprehend how good it had felt. It was unlike anything else. "Tony- that was perfect. Ohmygod..."
owner of Steve's uterus was the United States government all along.  So it doesn't matter what I want because that's between Steve, Bucky, and Uncle Sam."
.  It had been a surprisingly violent series that centered on Captain America taking out various baddies, mostly the Soviets.
Tony looked at her face.  The pale, creamy skin dotted with freckles, the liquid-copper hair, the large, wet green eyes and long lashes.
Steve curled into Tony's touch on instinct. Aria still looked concerned behind the couch. Steve's gaze was distant, like it truly was focusing on nothing. In Steve's head everything was dark, greyish in colour. There was a blurriness to everything but he couldn't really
Tony and Happy were talking, too quiet for him to really hear. Happy offered him a reassuring smile as he headed up the steps to the jet door.  He'd been on his jet before - it was the same one that took them to Monaco. It felt strange to be back in the same place, but as different people. Steve felt an instinctive pull towards the tablet on the desk, like he should check emails or something.
"Is that any way to talk to your temporary Alpha?" asked Malick.  Tony's eyes narrowed. "Let's not forget, I won a couple of nights of your regrettably disrespectful company.  Unfortunately for you, I don't like other Alphas, so there won't be any mating. ...I saw the mark on your neck.   Very interesting idea, trying to hide it with a collar."
Tony cocked his head.  "...no one's ever told you you were a good omega before?" he asked.  "But... but your... your old Alpha..."  It hurt to say those words.  Hurt like a knife to the heart.  But it wasn't just acknowledging that Steve had been bonded formerly.  It was that no one had ever bothered to acknowledge what a great guy Steve was.  Steve's face was open and honest and expressive, his jaw and cheekbones prominent, his lashes long, his hair perfect.  But that wasn't what Tony liked.  It was the quality lurking just under the surface of that.  Steve represented something Tony would never himself achieve.  He'd seen it only once before, in Yinsen.  A sort of Zen-like calm, a strong but silent, humble adherence to a set of moral guidelines.
Tony shrugged expansively.  "Dunno. Give him to 84, or Status Alliance, or something.  They can probably help him out. Maybe he can get a job as an actor who plays Steve in movies... I mean, the guy's a dead ringer for him."
When his charge finally fell into a fitful, feverish slumber, Karpov took himself outside for a smoke.  There was another agent there.
Clint probably had more to say about living a life of normality, but Cooper and Lila tore out of the house in hats and scarves and mittens, being chased by Laura.  All three were laughing. Lila made a beeline for Clint and Natasha, hitting them full-force, bowling Clint over.
"...I... like the metal ones," ventured Tony carefully, aware he was treading on thin ice with this topic.  He squirmed a little, trying to find a comfortable position. Steve's body was hugging his knot so warmly, with such a snug, sweet sort of possessiveness that Tony was thinking about going again in a bit.  "...I like the... way they look and stuff. ...if you don't like them 'cause they're cold we can just get you a nice lining. I mean--" Tony fumbled over his words. "I mean, if you wanted. Just for us, I mean, in the-- the bedroom, not like-- not like I'd ever ask you to wear something like that in public.  I mean, if you want to, if you-- like that, but you don't have to, obviously, I was just... letting you know."
He probably would have told Tony 'that's not healthy' or 'we need to work on that.' But Steve couldn't speak, not coherently anyway... he'd cried out Tony's neck during sex before, begged him... but that was about it.  Trying to form anything intelligent or meaningful was beyond his capacity.
Tony's stomach jumped into his throat when Steve said his name.  Tony lay there, staring up at the dark sky, letting himself get rained on.
contractor, their weapons helped saved lives and keep America safe.  Tony had sparred often with liberal, left-wing journalists; he didn't think of himself as an arms dealer, but as an inventor, a modern Renaissance man.  He joked about the weapons, deep down assuming that his cause was noble, that the monikers that followed him, like the Merchant of Death, were cute little tongue-in-cheek jokes that everyone was in on.
"Yeah.  Partially.  But also because he's an omega.  And if they accidentally killed some scrawny, not-fit-for-duty omega... no one would've cared.  They picked Steve to minimize their own liability. The treatment was experimental and they had planned to use it on Alpha soldiers once they knew it worked.  But they lost Erskine before that could happen. So instead they ret-conned history, told everyone he was an Alpha, and people believed it, because no one could fathom that a Captain could also be an omega."
Bucky was already in the stairwell.  Steve was fucking heavy; he ducked into level A-2 and slipped into one of the unused conferences rooms, knowing there were no cameras in there.  He knew the layout of every base; it was his job, after all.
it's unfair, I know better than anyone the kind of shit people expect from omegas!  But you hired me to manage your image and that's what I'm gonna do. We're not asking you to pretend you don't have sex.  We just want you to be... a little bit tasteful about it. And this, right here? This is
Maria nodded. "Great idea, Steve. Come on Tony, leave them be. Steve isn't going anywhere. He's safe."
Tony's body tensed as Steve's mouth roamed over it; he let out a mewl of longing when Steve's tongue finally dragged over the tip of his erection.  Steve's breath ghosted over the moist skin and he arched, aching for more contact with his tongue; Steve was nuzzling his thigh, though, teasing him.
"Can we go home?  I can't believe I'm saying we should cut out of a party early, but my hand is kind of messed up," said Tony.  As usual, he was making a huge understatement regarding his injuries; the broken fingers were swollen to twice their normal size and had gone from red to purple.  "Besides, George said he wanted to cut out, too. He doesn't handle his booze well and Donner's kind of overwhelmed... I told Georgie that Happy could drive them home with us."
"--so why don't you come with me and talk to him about it, since you're the expert?" asked Rhodey.  There was sarcasm in his voice but it was lost on Donner, who actually seemed to consider this.
With a deep breath to steady himself, he winced and pulled out the arc reactor with a loud snap of metal on metal.  Holding it delicately in one hand, careful not to tug on the wires, he dug two fingers into his chest and swiped out a blob of yellow-brown goo with a hiss.  He flicked it to the floor, nose wrinkling; the smell was something between rancid meat and singed metal.  "That
Steve felt all funny inside when she pulled back and met her smile with one of his own. "Night Pepper. Take it easy."
. It was heart-warming to see, even if Steve knew who very few of them were.  He set the tablet down and then grabbed a dressing gown (Tony had far too many as it was) before he went downstairs. The clothes JARVIS had sent for arrived.  He still didn't know how the AI knew his size or what to order but he wouldn't question it. Steve wasn't sure he'd ever get used to have so many menial things done for him, however.
. "You're an asshole," Steve muttered fondly and ducked his head down, their noses nudging together.  "But fine. We'll call it even," Steve breathed. He swayed with Tony, his eyes half slipping shut. He sighed softly again. "I love you too. I'm sorry. I'm not good at being drunk, I'm out of practice... Brooke was so pretty..."
Tony's eyes tried to focus and failed.  "--wh-what the f-fuck kind of p-parents tell you that m-monsters hide under beds?  They're s-supposed to tell you that there
Tony pointed into the crowd.  "Thank you, thank you!  ...who said that?  Oh, she's cute, hi there... thanks for coming, someone get her digits for me... okay, calm down, Stan, everyone, here's Stan, round of applause for Stan!"
. They were pretty, like jewellery but as soon they became a marker for status they took on a far more sinister tone. Steve sighed again and put his collar on, knowing he couldn't step out of their room without it.
Clint's grip on the phone tightened.  "Wh-what? ...you... you found... you found Barney?"  His voice was rough with sleep and he wasn't sure if he was dreaming or not.  "...is he..." Clint's voice sounded dangerously close to cracking. "...alive?"
More than anything, he wanted to call Pepper.  She'd know what to do, she always did.  She was the only one he felt comfortable talking about this.  Was this normal?  How was he supposed to feel?  What was he supposed to do?  He wanted to be there for Steve but the volley of information Steve had given him had been overwhelming, and he wasn't sure which part to focus on.
"Hold your calls?" repeated Pepper incredulously.  "Do you have any idea how many different departments--"
He climbed into bed, bottle still in hand, and pulled back and covers, gesturing for Steve to lie down, to let Tony put an arm around him.  Tony knew Steve liked to lay his head on his chest, feel the heat from the arc reactor. He figured he'd let Steve nap and work his way through the rest of the liquor in the bottle, eventually passing out, too, and in the morning it would be Christmas and they'd make the most of it.  Steve could have his little omega pals come over to talk charity work, and Tony could plan the party, and... well, they'd be fine.
"You ready?" Steve asked, moving to nudge the bag of gadgetry under a dumpster so they could fetch it later.
Tony glared at them as they left.  First agents Barton and Romanoff, the two of them looking deadly in their tactical gear.  Then agent Coulson, looking crisp and professional in his well-cut suit.  And finally, the odd man out, Steve, his leather biking jacket thrown over his once white button-up shirt.  Steve paused at the door and turned, as if expecting Tony to change his mind.  Tony kept his arms folded and his glare fixed, and then Steve turned and left.
The tracker on their ankles was so light it was easy to forget it was there. But the stark black plastic against Steve's pale skin was quite startling. It stood out. It reminded Steve of what he'd done every waking moment. He moved to pick at the plastic but then looked up when Tony placed a plate of slightly charred bacon and egg in front of him. "Thank you Tony," he said, sounding sleepy as he reached for his fork.  "Gleason's coming on Sunday and then that's it. He says I don't need anymore check ups," Steve said between mouthfuls. "That's good, right?"
Tony shoved Jack away; Hammer darted after him. Tony hit his hand jets and half-lunged, half-flew over to Vanko, slamming into him with the force of a car trying to run a red light and slamming into another vehicle.  The two hit the ground and slid, the loud shriek of shearing metal making Tony's teeth itch.
That was right.  He'd been captured.  He'd been held in a cave for 96 days.  They'd put stuff in him, stuff that burned the veins.  They had operated on his heart.  It was blurry but he definitely remembered that stuff, sort of.  They had wanted his weapon designs.  He had refused.
He was trying to untangle a pile of copper wires when Steve came up behind him.  Tony sensed him before Steve said anything, but still let Steve speak, not wanting Steve to know how much attention Tony was paying to him.
Steve was starting to lose feeling in a few of his fingers. The others got into the Honda, starting the engine. He didn't get into the McLaren. "Tony?" He murmured. He turned to face him. He moved to cup his face, making his Alpha meet his gaze. He brushed his thumb over his cheek. "You know it isn't real, right? None of it is."
Captain Ameri-- don't you scoff, Scott, my dad built him, I oughta know, this is it, the real one!  ...Steve, these kids are really cool, Paul here wants to be an astronaut-- wait, your name's not Paul?  --no, don't tell me, I don't care, I won't remember it anyway, you're Paul now." Tony slung an arm around Steve's shoulders, using him for support.  "I'm kinda drunk. Hi. You're going viral, I just checked on my phone, I set up a hot-spot. The kids--
"Hm?"  Tony had been huffing through his mouth, breathing, tasting Steve's scent.  There was a longing to it, almost a desperation.  "Oh!  Topiary artist.  Didn't you see my bushes out front?  Geometric shapes.  I hire a team to come in and trim them like that.  You don't think the dogwoods are naturally dodecahedrons, right?  Hell, dogwoods aren't even native to California."  Tony glanced up.  Steve was staring at him.  Just... staring.
Tony went back to surveying the street from the balcony, but after only about ten minutes, he let himself back in.  He spent the next few hours pacing impatiently between the bed and the living room, making sure Steve was safe.  He choked down some food because he felt like he should and rummaged through the cupboards looking for alcohol.  None.  Goddamn it.  He'd never be able to fall back asleep without a nightcap.
Part of Tony's personality was a tendency to fixate on things.  His tunnel-vision usually occurred with engineering problems and was part of the reason he was capable of working for thirty-six hour blocks with no sleep or food.  But it applied to other things, and it was clear this was one of them: he was having trouble accepting that they would not be going to the lodge for Christmas this year.
