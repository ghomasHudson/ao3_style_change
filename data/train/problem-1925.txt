After he was dressed in the usual jeans and jumper combination, he began towards the door. Something made him stop dead in his tracks. I shuffling noise was coming from inside the flat. Mrs Hudson never came in until 11am to bring John food. John glanced at his watch. 9am. So who on earth was down in the flat? Could it be…?
Sherlock was frozen in his chair, unable to comprehend. The sacrifice John had just offered. It hurt. Picturing a scenario where that was necessary hurt. And it was in this moment that Sherlock glimpsed a tiny fraction of what John had experienced when he had faked his fall.
Mrs Hudson found herself chatting away to Sherlock on the sofa. The situation was not unfamiliar to her. She and Sherlock had spent many evenings on one o their sofas with tea in their hands, simply talking. More often than not they had discussed Sherlock's latest case, or her mot recent visit to her sister.
Sherlock couldn't do it.
Sherlock would constantly wear him out, cause frustration beyond words, heartache that couldn’t be described, and anger like John had never known, and yet none of that mattered anymore. Because seeing Sherlock like this, in this place, it was like a wave that washed all of those feelings away, leaving only adoration and overwhelming love like John had never experienced
“He’s stable. Minor laceration to a lung. No permanent damage.”
John wasn't ready to be making his final promises to his wife.
“Sherlock, I-”
“John, in all the time that you have known me, when have you ever been able to describe me as ‘stupid’?”
"Easy," Mycroft whispered as he moved to support his brother as he fell. Sherlock's eyes never left John's face as he gave over to his emotions and began to weep. As Mycroft rubbed calming circles into Sherlock's back, kneeling with him on the floor by John's bedside, Sherlock began to consider just why his brother was here, and how Molly had known to bring him.
From the front, John could see that she had been drumming her fingers along her hip bones where her hands had been resting, which were now drawn up and folded across her chest and in amongst the folds of arms and fabric, John could make out the sparkle of a large engagement ring and matching wedding band.
“Well, I certainly hope you’ve learned your lesson. As it turns out, you’re needed.”
Mary Watson. Beloved wife, dear friend, never forgotten, always missed.
"Sherlock collapsed and his at Charing Cross," John explained to Lestrade, who was still looking at John with wide-eyed panic. "He's conscious and still being obnoxious as ever, which I'm taking as a good sign." Greg sighed in obvious relief. "Anyway, his highness is demanding my immediate presence and has promised a slow and painful death if I..." John trailed off.
“I should go and see if he’s okay. Maybe I can calm him down.”
“You let Sherlock waste away. You
John retracted his hand, as if he was worried that Sherlock would break even further if touched.
Molly said nothing to him as they sat in the cab, occasionally bumping shoulders as they turned a corner.
“Yes, Greg, Mycroft, Molly and Tom, and Mary and me.”
"It's raining...
“Let’s get one thing straight.” Sherlock purred, his voice so low that if the room had not been so silent he would never have been heard. “Do you really think that I would have willingly left John if I had known how much it would have hurt him? Do you all honestly think that the only thing I care about is myself? Maybe you should re-read your notes. I was prepared to die for this man, and I hunted down the assassins who threatened his life. When I was given news about John I was told he was doing well and moving on with his life. I was lied to, and if I knew what was really happening to John do you not think that I would have returned home much sooner? John’s descriptions of everything are admirably accurate. To see the way I was hurting this man, it was worse than torture. All I ever wanted was to keep him safe, as he keeps me safe, and I failed, I’m ashamed to admit it, but I failed. I felt burned to the core, dirty. Leaving John was the hardest thing I’ve ever done, and I have no intention to ever do it again. Do you understand?” The words hung in the air. Every syllable of this last statement was individually formed on Sherlock’s lips, each having a life of their own, and their own emphasis. It was clearly having the intended effect.
"I still think it's your fault," muttered Sherlock under his breath as he waited for the toast to pop up.
Sherlock’s stomach rolled once again, and the dizziness returned along with the roaring in his ear and the splitting pain in his head. But this did not drown out the final three words of the man on the screen.
Sherlock shook his head again.
"Moriarty…" Sherlock began.
As they entered the living room, John and Mary both resumed their positions on the sofa, John sitting stiffly in an upright position, Mary cuddled up next to him, legs tucked up beside her and her head resting on John’s shoulders. Sherlock occupied the chair opposite them. A large space was left between them, too large for John’s liking. He would have liked nothing better than to get up and push Sherlock’s chair as close to the sofa as it could get. That’s how is had always been, and how it was supposed to be.
"Yeah, okay, give me a minute." John fumbled in his coat pockets until he finally found his phone and began to type out the instructions for Lestrade.
He was soaked through, angry, tired and desperate to get home as soon as possible. He knew he was right about Sherlock, but at the same time there was a small voice in the back of his head, which sounded suspiciously like Mycroft, telling him that maybe he was wrong, and reminding him about Sherlock’s dark past.
“Then I came to the last one. ‘The final problem’ so to speak. HE was difficult to catch. One of the best men involved with Moriarty apparently, and very heavily protected. You’ve heard me say before, John, that Moriarty was positioned in the centre of a web, pulling strings and spinning new ones. It was only when I was tracking the final assassin that I realised how big this web was. I was sent to four different countries across Europe. I was caught a few times, and acquired some minor injuries…”
"Holding up, I guess.” John sighed and thought there really wasn’t any point in lying to Lestrade. He was the closest friend John had at the moment. Maybe it was the alcohol, but John felt like he really needed to vent to someone. “Just about ready to break, you know?"
Greg left them to see themselves out, probably to go and begin smoothing the feather, or however he had put it.
It was loud there, and very crowded. Obviously there was an important match on that John was unaware of. He was just about to turn around and try his luck elsewhere when he heard a familiar voice over the rabble of the crowd.
John didn’t remember any of this. He had, of course, been dreaming of Sherlock, of the fall. But something had changed, just as Sherlock jumped, his dream shifted, so it ended with Sherlock alive, whole. He couldn’t explain why the change occurred anymore than he could explain why he had woken up on the sofa.
And after all that Sherlock had put him through, why did John still hold him in such high regard? It was baffling. Of course, Sherlock consented to be the best man, how could he refuse John anything? He set to work with Mary planning the wedding almost immediately. In truth, he wanted the whole event to be finished and done with as soon as possible so he didn’t have to endure the pain of planning John’s wedding to someone else for much longer. If this was how he felt now, Sherlock had no idea how he was going to feel about the big day itself.
From that point, Sherlock found that he couldn’t resist thinking about John at every available opportunity. It made concentrating on The Work significantly more difficult. However, Sherlock persisted and attempted to keep his thoughts at bay whenever they were out on a job. But all it took was one word from John – “amazing,” “brilliant,” “fantastic,” – and Sherlock’s thoughts once again betrayed him. He found himself purposefully showing off more and more around John just to hear him say these things. And when he did, a faint blush would creep over the detective’s face, and he couldn’t help smiling to himself. Of course, he tried to hide it whenever this happened, but if Lestrade caught his eye once or twice, neither of them mentioned it.
“John, Lestrade, allow me to introduce Annalese Carter, née Holmes, my younger sister.”
He repeated this to himself every night before succumbing to his exhaustion.
The flat felt suddenly stifling. Everything reminded him of John, and Molly's accidental slip seemed to trigger this. There was too much John - in the flat, in his mind, everywhere.
In the first photo Sherlock was dressed in a suit, not unlike the one he wore to John's wedding. His hair was the same as ever, thick, dark curls. He was with a man John didn't recognise, dressed in a matching suit, hair slicked back. They were stood outside of a church, with obvious expressions of excitement on their faces. John had only ever seen that expression of intense excitement when he was working on an especially interesting case. But the last picture was truly breathtaking.
“I had to get back to work. There were two more assassins running around. I moved on to the one assigned to Mrs Hudson. Tricky, very tricky. I can see why Moriarty hired him. He put up a struggle when I found him, which took nearly a week. I was sent on a wild goose chase all around Scotland. Managed to lead him into an abandoned factory, where Lestrade was waiting for him. Didn’t need to get my hands dirty at all, although I hear Lestrade may have ended up a bit worse for wear.”
There were no visitors on the third day, apart from Mary, who came in before heading off to work. She’s ruffled Sherlock’s hair gently and kissed John before leaving. John did not do anything that day. He just existed. He did not talk to Sherlock as the others had done, the idea seemed ridiculous. Besides, what on earth would he say? Sherlock would know that John wanted him to wake up, he didn’t need to be told, and anything else John would want to say would be irrelevant.
Relief - sweet, blessed relief - washed over Mycroft. He left out a sigh. It felt as if a huge weight had been lifted from his shoulders.
John's heart hurt. His gut twisted at the noises coming from his friend, from what he was saying. John had always wondered why Sherlock had turned to drugs. Sherlock had always insinuated that it was to dull his mind and streamline his thoughts. The truth was even worse than the lies.
Greg scoffed.
“Oh. Okay.” Sherlock smiled, he could just picture her now, a tiny, blonde haired girl, a perfectly formed figure with deep blue eyes and a smile that could melt hearts. Sherlock imagined for a moment what it could be like to have a family with John, but it hurt, knowing the reality he was facing.
Even between cases, when Sherlock was pacing around his flat or retreating into his mind palace, Sherlock found himself replaying these praises to himself in his mind, hearing John’s voice telling him he was amazing over and over again. The feeling he got from this was better than any high he’d ever experienced. Sherlock did not know why he was thinking about John so much. Was it normal for flatmates to think about each other often? What did Sherlock label John now?
"Everyone at the Yard's read it John! I sent the link to my sister Mary. We love to talk about it when we meet up. We love it. We're a particularly fond of 'A Study In Pink.'"
"I call bullshit. Now, tell me what's wrong."
“Your what?”
"Trying? No success then?"
“No, I lost all contact with the world outside of our flat whilst I was alone, not even my sister…”
“You have questions,” Sherlock couldn’t help smirking at this. It had been one of the first comments he made to John, sat in the back of a London taxi on their way to their first crime scene. “Fire away.” He sat back, relaxing for the first time in months and closed his eyes. He placed his fingers together and brought them up to his chin, where they rested patiently, waiting for John to begin talking.
They made their way to Lestrade’s office with little hassle, the officers working obviously preoccupied with the case at hand rather than insulting Sherlock. Although, John noticed, there seemed to be rather more officers than usual working at this late hour.
He released John’s hand, and exited the flat, leaving John to watch the edge of his coat whip around the corner from the open door. John closed it and returned to Mary. He wanted to ask what Mary had spoken about with Sherlock, but when he moved into the living room, he fond Mary curled up on the sofa, fast asleep.
John stood there, trying desperately to compute the information. Sherlock had never before mentioned a sister, neither had Mycroft. And suddenly, here was this figure that had come into their lives, literally out of nowhere, and Sherlock was claiming that she was his unknown sibling?
The man walking through the doors was not Sherlock Holmes. The man walking through the door was not his best friend. The man walking through the door was nothing more than a shadow of what he used to be, a whisper of memories long forgotten. Just a hollow shell of the rich, enigmatic and human man John had come to know. Physically, he was still the same – alert and intense. He still held his head high, eyes narrowed. He walked the same way he always had, and the curls on his head bounced around just as they had before. John watched from his armchair as Sherlock gazed around the flat as he stood in the doorway, taking in all the new information into his mind palace, and storing it for later analysis. After only a few moments of hesitation, Sherlock strode into the flat and sat down in his armchair. He moved his hands across the smooth, black leather, as if this was a source of comfort to him, as a small child would rub silk against their skin in a time of distress.
Stage 4, malignant brain tumour. It was a secondary tumour, meaning the cancer had already spread far enough to affect her spine and nervous system. Inoperable, impossible to cure, but her life could be prolonged for a while.
“Gimme a break, I just got shot.”
Alvarez raised an eyebrow at him, finally taking his eyes away from his food. He was a large man, as you'd expect a rich, powerful drug lord who clearly enjoyed the finer things in life - if the room they we currently in was anything to go by - to be. He wiped the corner of his mouth with a delicate, white napkin before speaking again. His accent was not as heavy as those of his employees, but he would be more experienced in the English language, as it would have been an essential part of his drug business.
"Are we what, John? Spit it out."
“Sherlock, sit down.” This was not a request or suggestion from Mycroft. It was a demand. Sherlock noted the tone of voice and immediately sat back into his seat. It seemed that despite the loss of 5 years from Sherlock’s mind, he still considered Mycroft to be a voice of reason, and was reasonably happy to comply. Well, as happy as Sherlock could be obeying commands from his older brother. He resumed his staring.
The same hand that had rested on his shoulder at the bottom of the stairs was now joined by it's twin, supporting his weight as he collapsed against the wall. The hands guided him down until he was sat on the landing with his back up against the wall as he continued to cry.
“John, I’m sorry.” It didn’t need saying, and both men knew it. But there was something final about this apology. For John, it was enough for him to accept that this wasn’t a dream, that Sherlock actually was sat here in front of him, in 221B Baker Street, where he belonged. And he forgave him, forgave everything this man had ever done because in that moment, he had made himself vulnerable, he had opened up. For Sherlock, it marked the end of a long and difficult period. He wanted nothing more than to settle back into their old routine, but understood that this would take time and patience. He knew that John would have to adapt, again, to having him back around. They sat in silence for a few more moments, just observing each other, Sherlock calculating, John memorising.
He'd been in a dreamlike state all day. He did not consciously register ever waking up or doing anything that morning. He'd dreamed of John the night before, of his fall - as Sherlock still refused to believe that John had jumped. Reliving what happened usually made Sherlock's state of shock much worse, and that day had been no exception. Imaginary John had tried to get him to talk, as John would have if he were alive.
Sherlock would have surely developed some trust issues regarding not just his brother, but also Molly and even John. They would have to work through that, and Greg would fully support Sherlock through that. After seeing him suffer so much, Greg wanted what was best for him, no matter what that was. Greg himself knew that he would need time to bring himself around to the situation and accept the fact that he’d been deceived by one of his best friend’s in one of the worst ways possible. Of course, he could get over it, and begin rebuilding the bridges with John and Molly, maybe even Mycroft.
She was going to die.
“Sure, no problem.” The music cut off immediately, and Sherlock heard just how fast and deep he was breathing. He held his head between his hands as he tried to stop the pain and the spinning by rubbing hasty circles on his temples. It was no good, and it would continue to be no good until he got home. There, at least he had John to rely on to help him through this. At least, Sherlock thought, he hoped so.
Occasionally, John would be wrenched from sleep by dreams of a very different ending to the rooftop scene from months ago. But Sherlock would always be there, be it to provide a source of comfort, or to sooth John back to sleep by playing the gentlest and most beautiful melodies on his violin.
Maybe John was missing the thrill of the chase, the feel of adrenaline pumping through his veins. Yes, this seemed the most likely thing. So Sherlock let him in on the Magnussen case, involving breaking into his office with a fake engagement to Mary’s maid of honour. John looked affronted on behalf of Janine, but Sherlock could not have cared less. He did not care for Janine, just as John did not care for Sherlock in that way.
“Why would you care anyway?”
As he had seen on Sherlock’s face earlier, a cold fury had settled over Lestrade’s features, all aimed at Mycroft.
He didn’t hear the footsteps above him stop, and them rush back down to the kitchen.
Sherlock thought back over the past year.
Christ. Sherlock really was an idiot – despite all evidence, and self-declaration to the contrary. Sherlock had insulted, manipulated and pushed away possibly the only person willing to help Sherlock other than his brother, and Sherlock would not tolerate being in his brother’s care for any longer than necessary. John was his flatmate. Friend? Sherlock didn’t know. Sherlock had never had any ‘real’ or ‘proper’ friends, and that fact that he’d had one, but can’t remember, and was unable to keep hold of him was absolute torture. He wanted to hold on to what he had with John – or had in the past – and hold it tightly and not let go. It made him sound like a petulant toddler, but, as Mycroft, Lestrade and Mummy had so often reminded him, that was just how he acted sometimes.
"Bullshit. You wouldn't be calling if he was fine."
John Watson, his best had only friend in the world, had never died.
"John, I-"
“Did I ever tell you anything about my life before I met you?”
I want
“Why are you here Doctor Watson?” Sherlock’s voice was calmer now, questioning.
Sherlock's changeable eyes met Lestrade's hazel ones. He gave Sherlock a weak smile, before giving Sherlock's shoulder, what he assumed was supposed to be a reassuring squeeze. He removed his hand and made his way slowly up the stairs to 221B, leaving Sherlock still stood at the bottom of the stairs.
married lifestyle to come and take care of me in some vain attempt at helping me regain my memory-”
Mycroft had arranged for John to be taken to Bart's, to end it where it had started. John - had he been conscious - would have commented on how dramatic the whole set up was. But Mycroft was a Holmes, and sadly they were very susceptible to a spot of Drama.
Sherlock tightened his grip on the weapon.
When Sherlock came back form his flashback, he noticed he was doubled over in pain, hands clutching his skull so forcefully that it felt like he was going to crush it. The pain kept building, an uncomfortable pressure was rising just behind his eyes and he began to feel nauseous. Never had a memory been so strong – not only an image, but a conversation, and even emotions. But with a memory this strong, the headache that Sherlock was experiencing was the most painful yet.
They probably wouldn’t always be happy, especially at the beginning, but that was okay. John would be satisfied for himself and Sherlock to be unhappy together, even if they were unhappy forever. Really, there was no other person on the Earth that John would rather be unhappy with.
“Sergeant Carter, I’m warning you,” started Greg, moving between her and Sherlock, creating a physical barrier. John took a step towards Sherlock, ready to pull him from the room if Carter became more aggravated, which, in all honestly, was very probable.
The silence continued until…
“It’s hardly an argument if it’s one-sided, John,” scoffed Sherlock.
"You can't get hurt, John. I forbid it. And you can't leave."
"And he just doesn't seem to give a damn."
It wasn't fine, not really. But seeing how he couldn't even handle his own emotions, he didn't want to be dealing with a distraught Molly as well.
“Rhododendron ponticum?” Asked the doctor, his voice struggling to remain steady.
“Yes, you deduced it. It was one of the first deductions I ever saw you make.”
”Sherlock cut him off immediately. In a flurry of curly hair, black coat and fury, Sherlock was on his feet, striding towards Mycroft, brining himself to his full height and looming with a great sense of malice over his older brother. Mycroft had never seen Sherlock look so angry. No, not just angry. He looked betrayed, hurt, desperate. “You knew he was out there, alone. You allowed him to get hurt, Mycroft. You’re the reason he’s in this state. Both you and Miss Hooper.”
“That’s what I’m phoning about. Greg, Sherlock’s hurt, badly. He’s unconscious and needs medical attention from someone who is not shaking quite so badly.” It was true. As the severity of the situation dawned on John (a murderer still walking free in London and the world’s only consulting detective lying in the middle of an alley), his body began to react. He’d started to shake, and nausea was rising in his stomach. He was no use to anyone like this. “Please Greg, send and ambulance and get your team on it.”
Home. I felt good to hear.
There was a moments pause, where John and Sherlock exchanged glances. "Tea would be lovely, Mrs Hudson. Our flat?"
“John.”
Greg set down his now empty glass, and screwed his face up in mild concentration, trying to find the best words to use in the situation. "Well, he doesn't remember you're his friend, yes?” He turned to John to seek confirmation, which John provided in a minute nod. “In his mind, he's the same person he was 5 years ago, but at the same time he's aware that he's lived those past 5 years."
“I read about that in the papers. It just said he was injured following a case.”
Every mission started the same. John arrived in a new city, he was given he assignment by one of Mycroft's men after they had given him the code word of the day that signalled the man or woman could be trusted. He'd move into the assigned safe location, before sitting and planning how to get through the next leg of this task of dismantling what was left of Moriarty's network. These individual missions took at least a week, and often involved John getting himself captured to be able to more efficiently infiltrate the organisations and criminal gangs.
John had felt a rush of affection for his wife, who once again had been thinking of him, and only him. They’d walked through the streets of London until they ended up in a park.
His long was caught in the breeze. As it blew around him, he kept his chin tucked into his scarf, it was quite cold on this particular day. At least his hair wasn’t getting in the way. He removed one of his hands from the pocket of his coat and swept it through his – now shorter – curls. It felt god to have them back to their normal length. His lips curved into the smallest smile as he replaced his hand in his pocket.
"What's wrong?"
“Not important? John, the man’s killed three people! Where’s Sherlock? Put him on the phone and maybe I can talk some sense into-”
to call themselves medical professionals to prod and poke at me and carry out all kinds of unnecessary and ridiculous tests."
Sherlock straightened next to John, and joined him in just staring at the gravestone. The fact that Sherlock had come down here, laid flowers at Mary's grave, and then chosen to stay with John sent a jolt of emotion though John's chest.
"Could've used your input today. Anderson was a bloody nightmare."
“Sherlock, please. Don’t leave me. I love you so much and you can’t leave me. Don’t let it take you from me.” The tears were falling thick and fast down John’s face, but he made no effort to wipe them away.
They grinned at each other and drank the hot tea.
“John, we need to talk about this.”
Sherlock decided almost immediately that he didn’t like her. She was clearly only using John to get back at her old boyfriend and make him jealous. Her dress was too tight fitting, short and low-cut for a first date, and the amount of flowery, sweet perfume she was wearing was powerful enough to knock out a small child. She was too desperate, obvious. She kept fiddling with the silver heart necklace around her neck, obviously from a previous lover, and it still held sentimental value, so he was obviously important to her. The fact she was playing with it conveyed nervousness and guilt – nervousness for the date ahead and hoping her plan would work, and guilt for using John so cruelly. Sherlock could feel his hands ball into fists at his side and he clenched his jaw tightly closed so he didn’t accidentally (or on purpose) blurt out her true intentions for the evening. John deserved so much better than that. So much better.
He stopped in the corridor. His eyes moved up the stairs. In their flat, above his head, stood Sherlock’s best friend, who now finally understood everything. He allowed a smile to spread across his face and he strode up the stairs two at a time. He reached the top and paused. His smile had not gone from his face, but he forcibly removed it, resuming his cool, blank expression as he entered the flat.
"You're quite sure he'll make a full recovery?" Mycroft trusted medical professionals, of course, but he needed to be absolutely sure.
“I’ll do nothing of the sort,” breathed Sherlock, purely for John’s benefit. John was glad to have more reasons to laugh and smile than cry these days.
Something inside John snapped.
Just the mention of his name was enough to make John's stomach twist into uneasy knots. No good ever came of hearing that man's name. Last time John had acknowledged Moriarty's existence, it had ended with Sherlock dying.
Sherlock’s eyes snapped open and John let go of his arm.
He had been there when it happened, he had witnessed her last breath, and heard her last heartbeat. She had been sleeping, and had just drifted away, never to wake up. John supposed that this was for the best. She had been so scared, so utterly terrified – as had he – and now all the pain, the struggle, the fighting was finally over. It was the single most painful experience of his life, and yet at the same time, he had felt numb, refusing to accept that Mary – his beautiful Mary – was gone.
“But Molly told me-“
John's voice cut off as he heard a familiar baritone in the background of the call.
John was loathe to admit it, but 221B had always been home and probably always would be. Even when he had moved in with Mary, he had always felt a strange loyalty to the flat - although, he'd never admitted it to her.
He hadn’t left the hospital since they arrived on the night of the chase. John had been checked over and was cleared by the nurses on duty. He’s then followed Sherlock as the doctors performed various tests and scans, until they had set him up on one of the empty wards. He’d spent a few minutes trying to regain control of his emotions, but it was difficult when he was in the same room as Sherlock when he was in this state. He'd quickly gone outside for some fresh air and to ring Mary, because John knew she would have been worrying all evening about them. John explained everything to her, voice quivering and breaking as he spoke. She told him she’d be there in ten minutes.
“John…”
Soon, they were surrounded by trees, and Sherlock was once again exiting the car. This time, he held the door open for John, who cautiously followed him. In his pocket, John's phone began to ring. It was Mary. John pressed 'reject call'. Now was not the time. Sherlock wanted to show John something that obviously meant a lot to him, and John wanted it to be just them. He would probably argue with Mary about it later, especially given their discussion last night, but he didn't care at this precise moment. After John was out of the car, Sherlock closed the door and walked away, flowers still nestled in the crook of his arm. John followed without question.
"But he's not there.” John slammed his empty glass on the bar. He saw Lestrade watching him carefully, obviously startled at the sudden outburst, but John continued anyway. “And now I have to look out for him and make sure he's okay and not running around getting high again – did you know he’d relapsed?” Greg shook his head, eyes widening in surprise. They sat in silence and ordered another drink. “But there's no-one looking out for me, Greg. I can't go to Sherlock and talk about this because he doesn't get it. He doesn't know me anymore, he doesn’t think he ever has."
“Shit.”
He got changed and tucked himself into bed. He pulled the covers around himself, cocooning his body in a thick layer of warmth and comfort. His eyes closed and he continued to listen to the music. He drifted quite peacefully off to sleep, and was undisturbed by the usual nightmares, for Sherlock continued to play until he saw the first glimpse of the rising sun from the window.
"John, I've been hiding long enough, and I need to get this sorted out." Sherlock pointed to the long curls on his head, but John knew that he was not talking about that. John also knew that there was no point in trying to argue with Sherlock. He always got his way. He let out a sigh of resignation before moving to get his own coat.
“My phone had a voicemail on it. And I didn’t want to open it but I had to, I just knew who it was and what it was. That voicemail were the last words he said to me.”
Got your number from Lestrade. Hope you don't mind. I'll pass it on to my sister at the earliest opportunity. She'd love to meet you. Her name's Mary. – Liz x
We need John back, and we needed him back yesterday - Molly x
Sherlock had been there when John woke up, just as he’d promised he would. He hadn't slept at all the previous night, he'd just sat in his chair, not moving, thinking. He'd even attempted to make breakfast for both of them. John had been impressed with the food Sherlock had prepared. But this was because John was unaware that whilst he was showering, Sherlock had recruited the help of Mrs Hudson once again.
The sheer levels of Anderson’s ever increasing stupidity was one.
John was not in the living room. Sherlock turned to his left and found him sat at the kitchen table, exactly as he had been that morning. He had a cup of tea in his hand, and was taking a sip from it as Sherlock entered the room. There was a second cup of tea positioned exactly opposite John. Sherlock removed his coat and scarf, hanging them up behind the door, took his place at the table and picked up his tea. Both men just sat there, drinking, not even looking at each other. As usual, John was the first to speak.
“For not doubting me, and for helping me when I needed it. It was, umm, good.” Sherlock shifted uncomfortably in his seat, his yes now looking everywhere but at John.
Sherlock turned back to the screen. “I’ve been reading through your blog, John.” John noticed the use of his first name, and made a mental note to thank Mary the next time he saw her – or better yet, buy her something as a thank-you present, preferably with a large price tag, she deserved it. “I’ve been trying to find some of my lost memories. I found your blog on your laptop and decided to read it, incase it catalyzed the process of regaining my memory.”
Sherlock had completely drained of what little colour he possessed, and his breathing was becoming shallower. His eyes struggled to focus on his surroundings.
“John.” Sherlock’s voice was breathy and desperate, as if this name was the most singular most important name in existence, which of course it was because it belonged to John.
’ she’d said.
The doctor had explained the situation to him briefly. “John hasn’t left you’re side the entire time Mr Holmes. Indeed, you have a loyal friend.”
After a few more moments of silence, Sherlock put down his tea and turned his attention to John.
Most of these times, John was beaten, tortured, starved, blindfolded, gagged and physically, verbally and emotionally abused. But John was a soldier. He took it on the chin and endured it for the sake of the mission.
His medical license must surely be in question here. He was a bloody doctor. Clearly John had been so self consumed that he'd failed to make Sherlock take care of himself. He felt awful and the guilt clawed at his stomach, making it twist uncomfortably.
Sherlock began to sob, great, painful sobs wracked through his body, shaking both him and John to their very cores.
“St Bart’s Hospital, please.” Sherlock’s deep voice filled the whole cab with this simple command. However, the cabbie seemed to have been struck dumb. Sherlock noticed and sighed. “John, please inform this man of our destination as my presence seems to have rendered him quite incompetent.”
"John, no!" That was not a viable option. It never had been, and never will be, ever since the moment they met. Sherlock took the falls, not John - infinitely kind, selfless, brave John Watson.
There was shuffling upstairs, and Sherlock heard the familiar footsteps again, although this time, they were not pacing around in the middle of the room. They were descending the stairs to the living room.
“Will he ever be able to? Remember us that is,” John reclaimed Mary’s hand, looking back at the consultant. John was of course, a fully competent doctor, but he’d rather hear it from someone else than just rely on his own knowledge in this case.
Molly quickly grabbed his hand, and without a word lead him from their table, out into the street and hailed a cab, giving instructions for the cabbie to get them to Bart's as quickly as possible.
“Doctor Watson, my name is Jennie Lawson, and I’m a nurse at Charing Cross Hospital-”
“He has a name Sherlock, and it’s John.” John’s breath hitched as he listened to Mary scold Sherlock on his behalf.
A hand was rubbing soothing circles into his back, and a voice made its way through the chaos of Sherlock’s mind.
Still no response.
All three men found it extremely dull, and couldn’t wait to get out as soon as was humanly possible without appearing rude. Lestrade made their excuses and they rose from their chairs and exited to room.
“Does Mycroft have an inability to figure out the use of a mobile phone?” He rolled his eyes. “Seriously, why does he have to go through all the bloody dramatics? A quick text would do.” Anthea ignored him, still focussed on the utterly enthralling words that seemed to dominate her screen.
Mary had eventually calmed down and together they packed a suitcase full of John’s clothing, ready for his departure to Baker Street the next day. John didn’t realize how tired he actually was until he flopped down onto their sofa. His whole body ached with exhaustion and his eyelids felt heavy and he was struggling to keep them open. He could not pinpoint the exact moment when he allowed himself to give in and let sleep take him, nor could he figure out how long he had been asleep for.
“John, if you really were – are,” he corrected himself, “my friend, then you’ll know that I cannot stand repetition.” Yes, John was fully aware of that. The irony of that was, that Sherlock repeated this reminder at almost every opportunity.
Breathing.
But what surprised John the most was the look of pure, open hatred in her eyes as she glared directly at Sherlock, lips setting into a thin line and eyes never blinking.
John had never considered that, and it was a terrifying thought. Sherlock was only 37 years old, and a widow. That was harsh, and finally explained Sherlock's defences when he was approached by women.
We still on for tonight? - Molly x
As he was thinking, the kettle began to whistle. He filled the three mugs with hot water and set about making the tea.
Baby steps.
"I watched you die, Sherlock!" John nearly roared at the top of his voice. "I watched you fall and die, knowing that there was nothing I could do to save you. I buried you. Sherlock, I buried my friends in the war and I had to do it again, only this time..." His voice cut off.
It was all very well trying to prepare himself for what was ahead. But the truth of the matter was, that interaction with Sherlock was completely and utterly heartbreaking for John, who was so used to Sherlock being able to recall every little fact about him that having the tables turned felt oddly disorientating. He remembered the look in Sherlock’s eye after he struggled to find a memory of John. Sherlock had looked devastated – for there was no other word that John could have used. And this is what broke John. Sitting in silence and reflecting, and letting his heart get broken.
“You what?” John stared at Sherlock, mouth open, eyes bulging, he had surprised John. Sherlock rolled his eyes.
People had always remarked on what a heartless man Sherlock was, John himself had said so before he stormed out of Baker Street. He’d never shown that he’d cared for anyone other than himself, and occasionally John. He was always amazed that John could regard so many people in such a high favour when it seemed that Sherlock would not, or could not.
But he didn't. Instead, John froze. He turned his head until he was eye to eye with Sherlock. They held each other's gaze. They needed no words, only the silent communication. John gave Sherlock a minute nod, which Sherlock returned. Together, they turned to the black, wooden door. And together, they ran towards it, pushing all their combined strength against it.
Greg dialled again.
In fact, one of the main reasons John was here was to make sure Sherlock didn’t relapse, because in his mind, he wasn’t, he was just picking up where he left off. Although Sherlock had mentioned none of this to the doctors examining him, they had determined that Sherlock couldn’t remember the past five years, and five years ago, Sherlock had been in a dark place in the confines of his brilliant mind. As a doctor, he knew all about addictions and the marks they leave behind on the lives of the addict, and the people around them, he was prepared for any circumstance. As a friend, it terrified John to even consider that Sherlock would fall so easily back into addiction’s unyielding grip.
John had been so close to losing all of that again.
He was thinking – or more specifically, thinking about John Watson. He was a walking enigma. Soldier and Doctor. Capable of inflicting a wound and then healing it. The man was a living contradiction and it infuriated Sherlock. It was so much that it was because John was a contradiction, it was the fact that Sherlock had once known all about John, about why he was like this. Knowing that he once possessed the answer to the impossible puzzle that John provided, and due to one tiny mistake, a misjudgment, an error, it was all lost.
"Manners are the least of my problems. Now, where am I due to be next?"
“Sherlock…”
"Sherlock, sit back down and eat your damn food."
Sherlock considered this for a moment. There was nothing Sherlock would enjoy more than to see Mycroft try to deal with these ‘complications’. But he saw the desperation, and decided to overlook their sibling rivalry. Besides, the case did sound extremely interesting.
“Of what?”
Now here Mycroft stood, bold as brass, looking for all the world like he wasn’t responsible for the misery of a great many people. John Watson was well loved by all who had met him (criminals they apprehended excluded), and they had all felt his loss acutely.
Sherlock's expression was so comically melodramatic that John honest-to-God thought he would die of laughter in the back of the cab. The cabbie was giving them annoyed glances in the mirror - honestly, some people just didn't behave like normal, mature adults.
Sherlock removed himself from his window perch and transitioned to the significantly more comfortable worn, black, leather armchair which Sherlock had always claimed as his own.
"Send a text to Lestrade immediately. Tell him to get a decent and moderately intelligent team up to Vincent Square as soon as possible – not Anderson, he'll just get in the way. We need to close off the road, I need to get a closer look at this blind spot." Sherlock practically jumped out of the chair and began to stride towards the door in his ling, confident steps. He turned back to look at John, who was still recovering from the near miss. "John. The text."
“Kidnapping, the only daughter of one of the higher-ups in the politics game,” Lestrade began, still passing papers over his shoulder to Donovan as he continued, “10 years old. Was taken this afternoon after school. Usually attends piano lessons for an hour and a half before her parents pick her up. Never showed up to the lesson. Very out of character according to the parents and teachers. Obviously as this is a high-profile case we want to get it solved as soon as possible, hence why we’ve called in the extra staff.”
“That’s not important, John.” Sherlock broke eye contact with the doctor, choosing to address the skull with this particular statement.
“We don’t need publicity, not at the moment. The time will come, John, but not quite yet.” Said Sherlock as he moved towards the door. He paused in the frame, his fingers lingering on the sleeve of his favourite coat and blue scarf. They were there only a moment before he moved out the door and down the stairs. John followed, as eager to escape from this new tension.
“Of course, Sherlock. John, could you give us a few minutes? Pop the kettle on, maybe? I’m dying for a cup of tea!” She laughed dryly as she realised the wording or her request. John kissed her forehead, and Mary grasped his hand as he got up off of the sofa and moved into the kitchen.
His mind's version of Molly turned around and looked down at him.
“John, don’t sound so surprised. And for goodness sake close your mouth. Not only will you swallow an ungodly amount of flies at this rate, but you’re also starting to look like Anderson as, what you described ‘a lost goldfish’, and I don’t think I could tolerate that.” He said it very quickly, and rather snappishly, but now was not the time to argue with John, Sherlock clearly had a very serious case on his hands.
As the concerned nurses tugged Mycroft into the corridor, Mycroft heard his brother snarl over the requests by the doctor to calm down.
"But highly necessary for staying alive."
“Do you really think this person can help?”
“Your one to talk. If sulking was an Olympic sport Sherlock, forget gold, you’d win the bloody platinum medal.”
"For someone who hates repetition, you've said my name an awful lot during this conversation. Now, what is option two?"
"Invade space that one would consider their 'personal bubble'." Sherlock made quotation marks in the air as John looked back at him.
Okay guys! Thank for reading this and staying with me! Just a note to say that I've now begun work on another fanfiction with my very good friend Jennie! It's called 'Whatever remains, must be truth...' and I'd love it if you guys could check it out! The username is '2penstopaper'. Thanks guys! xxx
He didn't register how much time was passing, he only knew that it was. He was wrapped up in his favourite jacket, hands stuffed into his pockets just for a place to put them.
How much I love you.
And with that, Sherlock began to tell John exactly what had been happening from the moment he woke up in the hospital.
As if summoned by the very thought, John appeared behind him - Sherlock could see him reflected in the window - and peered over Sherlock's shoulder to read the messages.
It was similar to the room Sherlock had been in before. Sherlock was still awake and alert, sat up on his bed with a pillow supporting his back. His eyes locked on John immediately, not scanning, not analysing, just watching. As John took another step into the room, relief flooded his expression and his mouth curled into one of the largest, most genuine smiles that John had ever seen on Sherlock.
Around them was a flurry of movement. The shooter had been bought to the ground by several officers who had run at him the moment he’d fired the shot. Clearly, more people at NSY cared about Sherlock than John had originally thought.
"Okay, John. I'll tell you, if you promise not to interrupt me. I need to tell you exactly why it happened, and that's only going to happen if you simply listen."
He needed to go home to Sherlock.
“She seems to have told you a great number of things.”
"It doesn't take a genius to figure out why I haven't gone back to that place."
"John."
“So, what happened after?” John asked tentatively, seeing that Sherlock was deep in thought.
“She didn’t know,” he mumbled, so quiet that John leaned forward in his chair to hear properly.
They reached a beautiful grassy glade, surrounded by a boarder of oak and sycamore trees. It was still on the brink of summer, so everything was green and luscious. It looked absolutely beautiful.
The tears had already begun to fall down the detective's cheeks.
After the brief moment, he returned to his default position, just sat in the chair, thinking, wishing that he could be happy, for the pain to end. There had been nights where the pain was so great that he has tried to swallow all of the sleeping tablets he could find. Mrs Hudson had arrived just in time, and had forced the bottles out of his hands. One night, he blacked out and woke up the next morning to the clean smell that accompanied hospitals, with a tear-stained Harry beside his bed. He'd promised her then that he wouldn't try again. They might not get along, but since their parents rejected her, John was the only thing she had left.
Nothing much had changed since he’s moved out of 221B Baker Street. Everything was almost exactly the same as when he’d moved out, with the addition of a bit more mess, increased amount of equipment for more experiments, and a slightly stronger smell of chemicals and gunpowder. Sherlock had not moved anything of John’s, but the place had been noticeably tidied, or at least an effort had been made. Why couldn’t Sherlock have done this when John had still been living here? What seemed like wasted arguments finally had the affect John had intended, even if it was slightly later than expected.
John felt restless. He wanted to get out and about, get a case and watch Sherlock work his magic. But he didn’t feel ready. He couldn’t quite put his finger on why, but he was aware of the feeling in the pit of his stomach. He watched Sherlock move about the flat, getting the shopping, removing the pills. This made John feel better, it confirmed that Sherlock cared enough to search the entire flat, every nook and cranny, every crack in the floorboard and every hiding place, to make sure John would never attempt to take his own life again. But still this felling was present. Not growing, not shrinking, just lying dormant, waiting.
“Sorry,” John muttered, remembering the no interruptions rule.
John had slept with the door open ever since he arrived back at Baker Street, just in case something happened in the middle of the night and John needed to get to Sherlock quickly, although as of yet, this hadn’t happened.
“Yes, I supposed I did.”
“So, Lestrade, are you convinced that I’m right, or do you wish a repeat of what happened a few months ago. Please do think carefully, I detest repetition.”
It worked.
“I know,” she whispered back, “I’m sorry too.”
The trembling in Sherlock's hands spread like ice up his arms, through his shoulders and down his spine, until his whole body was shivering as if he'd spent the whole day in the Arctic conditions of London in winter without his beloved Belstaff coat.
“Right, no time for explanations! The whole story will be printed tomorrow in every available newspaper, online and probably on the evening news. So, if you could all read or watch that when you have the time it would help immensely and save me the trouble of explaining it all over again,” began the Detective Inspector, his hands at his hips ass the surveyed the room and addressed it’s inhabitants, all of whom had lost the ability to speak. “It would also give you the chance to learn about it without Sherlock inputting an insult or two as you do.” Lestrade shot another pointed look at the taller man. “But right now, we have a murderer running around somewhere and we desperately need to find them. So if we could all get back to what we were doing and getting the information for me, Sherlock, John, come through.” He pressed past the few remaining people standing between them and the door, and Sherlock and John followed obediently.
John continued to blink until he regained his focus on the world around him.
John focused on the warmth radiating from the hand he was clutching in the cold of the afternoon. He and Mary were walking around one of London’s many parks, hand in hand, not talking, just enjoying each other’s company. John honestly did not know what he would do without Mary’s constant support. She was the one constant in John’s life at the moment, always providing the strength that John needed. She could have come with him to Baker Street, being a nurse she was more than qualified. But John knew that Mary was giving them space. John needed to be the one to help Sherlock, and he wanted to do it alone, and she respected that.
Sherlock didn't like the idea of eating out without John. But he knew he'd have to get over all of his aversions and anxieties sooner or later, and now seemed like a good time to start. Besides, maybe if Mycroft and Lestrade saw him outside and eating, they might leave him alone. Yes, dinner with Molly seemed like a very good plan.
John looked at his best friend once more as the memory faded.
John Watson stood in a position he had hoped he would never have to be in again. He couldn’t decide which was worse, Sherlock being hospitalised after his lying, scheming wife had shot him in the chest, or Sherlock being hospitalised after a suicide attempt by overdose. As the thoughts chased each other around his head, John looked to Sherlock, still unconscious on the standard issue hospital bed.
Each step felt like a step towards a death sentence.
Jealousy, possessiveness, increased heart rate, constant thoughts about John, smiling because of John, the things he said, what he’s done, the swooping sensation in his stomach…
And with that Sherlock Holmes shot James Moriarty, his greatest adversary, most alluring puzzle and biggest threat.
"Shh, Mary. Don't say that." The moment was so intimate and tender that John filled with emotions. He was very aware of how little time they had left like this, and choose instead to enjoy being in the presence of his beautiful wife, and cherishing every second they had together. His hand moved from her face to stroke her short, blonde hair in what was supposed to be reassuring movements, but John's hands were shaking too much as he became overcome with premature grief. Mary did a good job of pretending not to notice.
John stayed with Sherlock until he had exhausted himself with his emotional outburst. And even afterwards, not wanting to leave his friend's side. He tucked Sherlock into bed and made sure the detective was fully asleep before turning off the lights ad laving him to rest. He phoned Mary and explained the situation in full. It had been difficult to talk about, considering how closely it resembled their own lives, and his voice caught more than a few times. Even Mary was shocked, and there wasn't much that could shock her - if her reaction to Sherlock's return was anything to go by.
3 months was not nearly enough time.
John’s eyes fell upon the armchair opposite him. It was strange to think that the man who was just sat here could be the same man that he had shared so many good memories with in this room, like the stag night, the many clients they’d listened to, the countless takeaways. The list was endless.
John looked back fondly at them. He pulled out his phone and quickly took a picture to immortalize the tender moment between landlady and detective.
“It’s nice to see you smiling again, John.” Mrs Hudson smiled fondly at him.
John thought.
John heard the door behind him open and quick official sounding footsteps followed. Mycroft.
“Sherlock told me you were having a hard time adjusting. I wouldn’t bother lying to me John because Sherlock told me that himself and that man knows everything.”
Sherlock gestured toward the sofa, where Mycroft took a seat. Sherlock lowered himself into his armchair and turned to face his brother
John tried to turn Sherlock over so he could see if there was any more damage. With a great effort, but making attempt to not hurt Sherlock anymore, John turned him over. He opened each eyelid and shone the light from his torch, forcing his hand to steady itself as he continued to shake. Sherlock’s pupils were slow to react. Too slow. He’d be concussed when he woke up.
"John, Sherlock's fine."
Sherlock placed both sealed envelopes on the coffee table, and then turned his attentions to his secret hoard. He prepared his arm, found a vein, took a deep breath and inserted the needle.
“It’s not my fault the girl was incapable of asking relevant questions!” Sherlock argued. Lestrade opened his mouth to retort, but John put his hands up to stop him.
John smacked his fist down on the dark wood. He was not just angry, he was seething, his fury seeping from the very prose of his body. Sherlock flinched instinctively. Last time he had seen John in this state had been when Mary was diagnosed, and Sherlock had earned himself a punch to the face.
Sherlock scoffed. For a fully grown man with the highest IQ that John had ever come across - with the possible exception of Mycroft - Sherlock had an uncanny ability to at like a petulant four year old who had just had his favourite toy taken away, or Harry when John had tried to take a bottle away from her when she was at her worst. But John wasn't getting into that now. He had one lanky, dark headed, distressed and bored consulting detective to focus his attentions on. And Sherlock was certainly making sure that he had John's undivided attention.
“This,” John said, unfurling one of his hands from the ridiculously expensive shirt that Sherlock wore and wrapping it around Sherlock to reach his back and pull him closer, “is good.” This is what John needed. A friend. Even if Sherlock didn’t realise this, or know who John was, John was grateful just to have the source of comfort that Sherlock provided.
“And they’re competent?” Sherlock asked as they moved into the corridor outside. “If they’re anything like your current team I shouldn’t have too much hope.”
Sherlock was refusing to look at him, eyes firmly staring at the floor, which was apparently much more interesting than John.
Sherlock's voice cracked as he addressed the stone.
Greg slammed his fist into the wall next to him, creating a slight dent in the plaster, and a small graze across his knuckles. Not that he cared, he couldn't even feel it.
It wasn’t exactly as if someone had switched on a light in John, no. Nothing in the world could restore John’s light at the moment. It had been two weeks since Mary’s funeral, and without her to guide him, Sherlock could see that John was completely lost. He looked like he’d aged at least ten years, and he always seemed so exhausted. After he’d been standing in the doorway for a good few minutes, John opened his mouth, as if to say something.
There are few times in life when one Holmes brother will ask the other for their help. The incident regarding the missing politician, a Mr Lawson, was one of them. John was still seething over Mycroft interrupting their evening with Mrs Hudson, but he trusted Sherlock and knew that he would not have accepted the case if it were not highly important, or interesting.
He failed spectacularly. Abandoning all hope of 'Keep Calm And Carry On', John settled for pulling Sherlock back into as he began to sob on his shoulder, too overwhelmed by the emotions coursing through his body to care too much.
“Thank you Mrs Hudson.” He whispered in her ear. She waved him away with her hand before exiting the flat. After the listened to her descend the stairs, the three men stood in a stony silence. Mycroft and Sherlock were both watching John, who was clearly weighing up his options.
When he heard John's heart stop, he felt his eon leap into his throat. They could not lose John, it was imperative that he survived, for both his own and Sherlock's sakes. Mycroft would never forgive himself if he was responsible from not only removing John from his life, but also for John's death.
At last, after what felt like an eternity of walking, he reached the black door with gold lettering reading ‘221B’. He had finally taken his key back from John had dutifully left it on his desk, so he managed to let himself in this time, without having to disturb Mrs Hudson. After all she had done for John and himself, Sherlock felt that she needed a well-deserved break from the both of them. Only for a little while, until things were settled and they were able to move on with their loves as normal. That would probably result in Mrs Hudson, once again, tidying up after the detective and the doctor, muttering under her breath, “not your housekeeper,” as she did so. But until then, Sherlock made sure that they left her alone.
“Jason, I love you. I’m ready.”
Just as he began to lift his head, the small screen situated to the right of the cabs interior flicked to life and the cab was filled with the white noise of static.
It wasn’t easy. It really wasn’t. John was prepared to admit that it was the most difficult thing he’d ever had to do. Even Sherlock couldn’t deny that it was hard.
But it was still painful for Sherlock as he and Mrs Hudson approach the elegant black stone which marked where his best friend now resided. There were flowers. Lots of them. Roses (from Mrs Hudson), lilies (from Lestrade), sunflowers (from Molly), carnations (from Sarah). They were laid over the grassy patch which lay before the smooth stone that jutted from the ground at such a harsh angle.
“He should have been preparing.” The man’s voice was lower now, quieter, his accent making it sound infinitely more dangerous, and Sherlock leaner closer to be able to hear what he was now saying. “Just because he’d lost all memory of the gathering storm, didn’t mean it had disappeared. No. It’d grown stronger. And the debt collector decided it was finally time for Sir Boast-A-Lot to pay back what was owed. It was time for him to burn.”
John was fighting to be that one miracle that Sherlock so desperately wished for.
Mary seemed to sense this, and she leaned in and kissed John deeply. As they broke apart, John pulled her in tightly, wanting to be close to her, to just be with her.
As he did so, a harsh laugh echoed through the walls of his mind palace, surrounding Sherlock. It was manic, taunting, utterly gleeful and frighteningly familiar. It continued to echo until there was no other noise save the laughter. It sent chills down Sherlock's spine until his whole body was shaking as he curled further in on himself, hands grabbing his hair, pulling and twisting until it was nearly ripped out of his imaginary skull.
“But what about taking care of me John? You made a promise.”
You make me happy
There was the deafening, sickening sound of an impact of something crashing into something else. John turned the corner. The murderer was running down, away from John, but this is not what caught John’s eye. Sherlock was crumpled in a heap on the ground, face down, not moving, not even making a sound.
"John, you need to understand. I never meant to cause any of this. I had to!" The tone of his voice was desperate as he tried to make his friend understand.
Sherlock pulled back to look at John.
They held each other’s gaze. They didn’t need to say anything to know what the other was thinking.
Hi guys!
Sherlock didn’t know what to do. He’d been experiencing this too much recently and it made him uncomfortable. Sherlock always liked to be in control, but now he wait relying on John to direct him. And John wasn’t doing well enough for him.
There was a small gasp of surprise from Jason, and Sherlock knew it was because he so rarely expresses interest in anyone so quickly.
Sherlock's deductions got more and more ridiculous, and John's quiet chuckles soon turned into loud, hysterical laughter which he made no effort to stifle.
John gasped as he tried to control his sobs, enough to speak into the phone, hoping that one simple word would show how much he was breaking, how much he needed them with him, to fix him.
"I don't care whether it's valid or not. It's not healthy and therefore it's my concern." John tried to maintain the eye contact, but after what just happened, he found the top left-hand corner of the flat just above Sherlock's head a lot more interesting. The silence between them resumed, although John could feel Sherlock's eyes on him, not ever moving from him.
Moriarty snapped his fiery gaze to John and moved towards him. In one swift movement Moriarty raised his hand a delivered a viscous backhand to John's face. Sherlock audibly gasped and took a step forward, but a raised hand from Moriarty was enough to stop him.
"I always knew you were a sentimental git." The imaginary John laughed fondly. "I don't see why you hide it so very deep, I always liked knowing you were human."
Greg struggled to catch his breath as he hurtled through the corridors of the hospital, noting the number of the rooms as he passed them.
, the ex-army doctor decided,
“Because I love you,” she said simply, smiling at him and sending waves of warmth throughout John’s body. “Come on, we should get back. There’s a genius back in Baker Street who’s in need of some decent company.” She jumped up from the bench.
"No."
"There's no point," he could hear himself saying. He did not shout, for he did not need to here, not in the confines of his own mind.
Sherlock jumped. He had forgotten about Jason. He had forgotten that things had now changed.
John closed his eyes against the bright sunlight of the day outside. He no longer felt hollow. Instead, John felt like someone had put a vice around his heart, his lungs, his stomach, everything. Something that felt like a bubble was rising up inside of him, threatening to break free from the shell that he now was. Something was now gripping tightly to the outside of his body, holding him in place. The rising bubble had burst, and John could feel the tremors through his entire body.
“Well, you were being a bit obvious.” Sherlock mimed John yawning hugely.
“Mycroft happened.” A hint of bitterness could be heard in his voice.
“Mycroft,” Sherlock might as well have shouted for all the effect his voice was having on Mycroft, but instead he whispered, his voice deadly and low, “for your own safety I advise you to leave the room now because I will not stop myself from hurting you.”
And then, Sherlock came up with the perfect solution, one which meant getting it off his chest, whilst never having to voice anything out loud.
worried about him?"
John's voice rose above the sounds of angry, desperate violin playing, and Sherlock stopped mudflow and lowered the violin and bow to his side. He considered the reason he didn't want to leave the flat, and closed his eyes to help him concentrate on the overwhelming emotions that enveloped him.he took a deep, steadying breath before talking.
They walked in silence through the corridors, passing figure after figure in the long, white lab coats that is was custom to wear here. The faces didn’t register with John as he moved down another corridor. His breathing eased up in these familiar surroundings, and the sensation in his chest was fading to almost nothing. The lights were too harsh, leaving John feeling exposed, judged, examined. Molly pushed open a door to their right and held it open for John. He stepped through and waited for Molly to join him. She gestured to one of the lab stools, where John sat. She pulled up her own and sat facing him. It was obvious from her position and the look on her face that their topic of conversation was a serious one.
“Okay, take your time, I’m not going anywhere.”
Molly looked up at Mycroft hopefully.
Mary had been moved permanently into a hospice, where she would stay until… until it was time.
“Delete this conversation. You know about deleting, don’t you?”
Suddenly, Sherlock found himself clutching his head as another colour filled his vision, the headache now worse than it had ever been. He gripped the kitchen counter for support, trying to stay upright.
"You know where Sherlock goes?"
The phone rang for a few moments, before the person on the other end of the line picked up. A silvery voice spoke.
As the taxi pulled up at 221B, John’s eyes were blinking madly as he attempted to keep them open. Sherlock let out a long sigh, hooked his arms around John’s waist and moved John’s arm so it was slung over his shoulder. He managed to manoeuvre himself and John out of the taxi, paid the cabbie and started to move John up the stairs towards the door. He hadn’t retrieved his key yet, so had to knock on the door with the semi-unconscious John still hanging from his tall frame.
His fingers moved automatically, tapping out the familiar rhythm on the back of John’s hand.
"Come on, we should probably get you into the flat."
“John! We’ll lose him!” John sped up, running faster than he ever thought he could. One foot in front of the other. The light from his torch was dancing all over the walls as he struggled to keep it steady in an attempt to keep up with Sherlock. His throat was on fire, he needed air. But they needed to catch the killer more. John continued to race after Sherlock, who was always just a few paces in front. The murderer turned round a corner. John saw Sherlock’s coat whip around at the sudden change of direction before…
She'd had her first fit a few days before, and it was the most terrifying thing John had ever had to encounter – even more paralyzing than when he thought he'd been locked in a lab with an enormous hound.
"I do understand Sherlock." Said John, still not meeting Sherlock's eyes.
But it couldn’t. John was going to lose the most important person in his life.
“I- No! I believe you it’s just-”
“Yes, I’m here Sherlock.” Sherlock turned to look at him, eyes still trying to focus. But when they did, Sherlock still looked weary and cautious of him. And that had been the moment where John had realised. “oh God, please no.” He began to shake, and the tears were spilling fast over his cheeks, leaving hot, salty trails down his face. He had clasped his hands together, as if in prayer and pressed his forehead against them with as much force as he could manage, trying desperately to cling onto his sanity. He had begun to rock backwards and forwards in his chair, crying out, “no, please, no,” over and over again as he did. He was removed by one of the nurses and placed in a separate room whilst the other doctors had attended to Sherlock.
“John loved these little fruit tarts from a Bakery just up from the surgery where he worked, so I walked to it wanting to surprise him at work with them. I heard people whispering about an accident, an explosion somewhere nearby. I thought it was a hoax, but then I saw huge plume of smoke and the sirens were everywhere, they were surrounding me and I just had this feeling of dread in my stomach. I couldn’t bear to run towards it, so I ran away. I ran home."
His mind palace was in disarray. Everything was throwing itself around, there was no sense of order. The paint was peeling, the doors were flying open until everything was thrown together, all one huge bundle of information and memories and theories and feelings until Sherlock couldn’t think clearly. Random thoughts were flitting through his head at lightning speed.
“This particular ruffian had been a debt collector, and Sir Boast-A-Lot owed him dearly. Sir Boast-A-Lot had become too boring to bother with, so he needed to change the game up. So, the debt collector staged a small ‘accident’ with the help of a few other robbers and criminals that Sir Boast-A-Lot had encountered. It was quite a nasty knock to his head.” The man on the screen laughed again. It was unnerving.
He’d gone back to work, solving cases for Lestrade with apparent ease, just like they used to. Except, Sherlock never had. In his mind, he’d always worked alone. He did not know what it was like to work with John on a crime scene.
“We met, of all places, in front of Tesco’s some infuriatingly cold winters day. The kind of day that made you worry about your fingers and toes because you’ve lost all feeling in them. I was simply walking by on the way to Mycroft’s to have dinner with our parents. As you can imagine, I was in a foul mood.”
“John,” Sherlock continued, his eyebrows knitted together, “we need to talk about this. We can’t go on like this.” John let out a sigh. He knew that it was inevitable. Hadn’t John’s panic attack proved things had changed? Sherlock may have been the intellectually superior of the two, but John was most definitely not an idiot. Until they cleared the air completely, they could never go back to the way things used to be, no matter how much they tried.
“Come on, we best get you back to the flat, and maybe Mrs Hudson can get you something for shock.” Sherlock began to lift his friend off of the bench.
“What happened?” She waited for a response.
His phone buzzed again.
John returned to 221B after it was over. He couldn’t face going back to his own flat, where he and Mary shared so many memories. No.
After stating at John a moment longer, Mycroft fished his phone out of the pocket of his immaculate jacket.
Before Sherlock ‘lost his memory’ – God, how he hated that phrase, surely there was something much more interesting and intellectual then simply loosing one’s memory – Molly, had fussed around Sherlock as a small puppy would with their owner.  She often came across as far too eager and forward, which had put Sherlock off almost immediately. But she was useful. As well as providing him with the lab space, Molly was the only person within the hospital walls who was willing to bend the rules to get Sherlock what he wanted, be it access to the morgue or the odd liver or too.
John, sensing that Sherlock needed to be alone, made a silent exit form the site of the grave. He didn't go too far, far enough for Sherlock to have his privacy, but not so far that Sherlock was out of his eye sight.
“How did I fake my death? And why was that necessary in the first place?”
“You. Owe. Me.”
John nodded in return, his eyes steely and focused, jaw set, a look of absolute determination etched onto his features. He raised his hand to the gun that had been safely hidden away under his jacket. Sherlock had made see that absolutely no-one could tell it was there. They'd even managed to slip it past Mycroft. They had gone over the plan again and again until Sherlock felt completely sure that John knew what to do, where and when to do it. This was going to be difficult and if it went wrong, could end up in one or both of their deaths. Sherlock shivered at the sudden wave of cold that passed through him at that thought. He needed to focus. Thinking about John, bleeding out, slowing dying in his arms...
It was painfully beautiful, just as John remembered it. He closed his eyes and saw Mary, in her beautiful ivory gown, and her smile, such a beautiful smile. He saw the guests, all stood around them as they took their tentative first steps of the waltz. He could see Sherlock, on the stage in his suit, eyes closed, concentrating and letting the music take over him as he played. He could himself together with Mary together, twirling on the dance floor, as Sherlock played his composition for them, such a perfect moment.
“No. Mycroft told me when I was staying with him.” Sherlock’s voice was calm, collected. But John saw a panicked shadow flash across his face. “Huh, some genius you are,” John snarled. “Now,
Mycroft had sounded so sincere, it made John’s chest tighten. No, they did not deserve this. And yet here they were. John did not dwell on the ambiguity of Sherlock’s safety. His priority now was Mary.
John’s face was as clear as if he were stood in front of Sherlock. But this was a memory – it had the slight clouded haze around the outskirts of Sherlock’s peripheral vision within the memory, clearly unimportant information that he had deleted, or had lost along with five years of his life. His own deep baritone echoed through this memory.
They made their way down the stairs and out of the building in silence, John following behind Sherlock. The younger man threw out his hand to hail a cab. The people on Baker Street gave him curious looks when the saw Sherlock. The consulting detective ignored then and stepped into the cab that had just pulled up to the pavement. The taxi driver did a double-take as Sherlock settled himself in one of the seats. John followed. Sherlcok took his phone out of his pocket and began to tap out a message quickly and quietly.
"No. Absolutely not. Out of the question."
“You John.” John stared at his flat mate. He was totally confused. What Sherlock was saying didn’t make any sense.
“It’s fine, Sherlock. They asked and I’ll tell them the whole truth.” He turned back to the stares of the journalists. “There were times when I couldn’t stand to just sit and wait until the day I saw Sherlock. I took as many pills as I could find and swallowed them.” There was a gasp and another flurry of paper and pens. “If it weren’t for my landlady and my sister, I would be sat here now. When Sherlock came back, at first I thought it must have been a dream, I dreamt about him so vividly and regularly that I didn’t trust what I saw with my own eyes. When I finally realise it was him, I wanted to punch every single part of his face and throw him out of the flat. I wanted to shout every insult I knew at him, I wanted to hurt him as much as he hurt me.”
She could not stand there and watch Sherlock fall apart slowly. And she knew Sherlock would not wish her to witness it either, preferring to work through his emotional torments alone. As he had once told her: Alone is what I have. Alone protects me.
"You are amazing." John breathed.
Bees seemed particularly attracted to the yellow petals, and three or four flew lazily from one flower to the next as they collected pollen and nectar from their precious findings.
There was a crumpling sound as John clenched his fists around the delicate paper. His eyes snapped up to Sherlock as he instantly put the paper on the table, turning his full attention to Sherlock.
Sherlock sighed heavily, before turning to Lestrade and John, gesturing to Sergeant Carter as he spoke.
John found him eventually. No, not found. That would imply that John was looking for him. John stumbled across him in the ‘drug den’ whilst out looking for another person. He was furious with Sherlock, and Sherlock felt shame seep through him for disappointing John, not that he was going to let John know that. So he continued to act aloof and unconcerned with John’s opinion. John was happy now and didn’t need him.
John did not need to say any more. Sherlock knew what John meant in those two words.
There was no noise in the flat. They used to have a clock, but Sherlock found the ticking distracting and highly irritating. It hadn’t taken long for a bullet to be fired straight through it, and that was the end of the clock. Since then, John and Sherlock had always relied on their phones to keep them updated on the time. John’s phone was laid on the small side table, which was now at the side of John’s armchair. The table had a habit of moving from one side of the room to the other, depending on whoever needed it the most. It was most often on John’s side of the room, because he often rested his empty mugs there after a cup of tea, or a book he’d had to abandon mid-sentence when a case came up that required the duo’s immediate attention. Looking at where it sat now, John realised that Sherlock hadn’t moved it since he’d last lived in Baker Street. His brows furrowed in confusion as he continued to focus his attention on the table, rather than what on Earth Sherlock could be doing
“Goodnight Sherlock, love.” She half turned towards him and saw his outline stood by the door, watching her leave. She made her way slowly down the stairs when she heard the door finally shut.
“He’s still breathing, his heart’s still beating, he’s still alive.” John reminded himself under his breath. The third paramedic, whom John had neglected to pay attention to, wrapped something around John before easing him up from the alley floor and propelling him forward. John’s eyes never left Sherlock. He could hear noise coming from the four people around him, but he did not even register what they were saying, his only concern was his best friend.
“He doesn’t even call me John anymore.” John choked out the words, ashamed to admit how much this hurt him. Because it did. It had always been Sherlock and John, John and Sherlock, the consulting detective and his blogger. But now, it was Sherlock and Doctor Watson, the consulting detective and the stranger that lived with him – at least in Sherlock’s mind. “And he’s loosing weight, Mary. Too much, it’s scary. He’s obviously not sleeping and he hasn’t appeared to make any progress with his memory.” John sounded like he was breaking, but there were no more tears. Mary rested her hand on his shoulder and pressed her forehead against his temple, eyes closed.
Baker Street. Come at once if convenient. JW
“Why?” Sherlock was shaking, John could see the bow in his quivering.
He didn't go to see Sherlock when he returned. He didn't know what to say to the man. He would have continued to avoid Baker Street if it weren't for Mycroft, who had turned up at his and Mary's home unexpectedly one morning.
“You were right.” He didn’t look up from his tea.
Sherlock's voice was not harsh. It was not a command to return from his thoughts to the present. It was not said with a force to demand he turn his attentions away from his fantasies. No. It was gentler, guiding. It provided a calm reminder to John that whilst it was very pleasant to lock himself away in his mind, it would be better if he focused on the here and now. It was this that bought John back to the hospital room.
On this particular visit, Sherlock was stood at the window, staring out into Baker Street, watching life flurry past whilst letting his own waste away as he was consumed by grief and guilt.
John didn’t seem to notice the tapping, assuming it was just Sherlock being impatient as he sat at the microscope.
John simply marveled at her and Mary walked across the room and into the kitchen. She smiled up at him, and picked up one of the half-cups of tea. She was smiling as she drank it, and the flat once again was consumed by silence, although this time, it was more comfortable. Mary looked at her watch and  - noticing the time - drained her cup. She moved into the living room and put her red coat back on again. John reached out, and caught her hand.
John thought.
“There’s no need to apologise to me, John. I’m sorry too. I probably said some things I shouldn’t have.”
"It's not real, none of this is. If it were, John would not be lying there. John's dead and I need to wake up. I have plans with Molly."
"Well, Liz, it's a pleasant change to have someone on the scene with more than one brain cell except myself, John and on occasions Lestrade" Sherlock nodded his head apologetically towards him, knowing that these insults were probably a bit not good. John waved him away, he'd heard worse before about the team, and he silently thanked whatever Gods were listening that Lestrade had the good sense not to bring Anderson and Donovan this time, and instead bought Liz.
And then he was shot, by none other than Mrs Watson. Sherlock could never have imagined this outcome. As the bullet entered his body, Sherlock felt himself falling, and leaving John Watson for the second time.
"Who'd have thought you, of all people would be able to get along with Sherlock Holmes. You're impossibly nice and intelligent and he's just… well, he's Sherlock." Lestrade let out a short laugh of disbelief, before moving to the rest of the team to debrief them of the exchange between John, Sherlock and Liz. He called back over his shoulder, "perhaps I should bring you along to more cases, Miller!"
Suddenly, the light was too bright, and there was a pricking sensation in his eyes. He forced them closed against the intrusion and tried to control his body as it continued to shake. But it was hopeless. There was no chance of control. Not now. Probably not ever again.
“Do you want to talk about it?” Her now empty hand reached up to stroke through John’s hair and he leaned into the touch. They sat there, shoulder to shoulder, Mary’s hands still stroking John’s grey-blonde hair.
He was going home, he was going back to John. He buried his face in his hands and tried to keep the tears at bay, only one thought echoing around his mind.
“I’ll take the case.”
“John, my dear John. My sunshine.” And with a few more breaths, Sherlock stilled. His lungs were no longer pushing air in and out of his lungs. His face was relaxed, almost as if he were sleeping, and John could almost imagine that they were back in Baker Street, back in their bed, and Sherlock was simply asleep. The grip on John’s arm went slack, and when John reached for Sherlock’s wrist, he could find no pulse.
“I know, sweetheart, I know.”
“Not your fault,” Sherlock managed to croak and John slumped next to him so they were sat shoulder to shoulder, hip to hip. “You’ve been attending to other, more important matters.” Sherlock’s hands seemed to snake their way up into his dark curls again and clutched at them, almost tearing them from his skull This seemed to snap John out of whatever daze he’d been in.
“But your date, with Sarah-”
, thought Sherlock.
His eyes flew open. It was now dark outside of the windows of Baker Street, meaning that Sherlock had been thinking for over 5 hours. It was so easy to get caught up in his own thoughts. Sometimes a whole day would pass and he wouldn’t notice.
John felt a wave of jealousy run through him. He longed to be happy, to laugh with friends. But he couldn't. It was impossible.
John knew exactly what Mycroft was referring to, and he completely agreed.
"What could you possibly want Mycroft that involves coming over to out flat at 10.30pm, interrupting our dinner for Mrs Hudson and offending my flat mate?" Johns head snapped towards Sherlock. So, he had registered the tension in john's body, and was reading the changes which signaled John's anger. But Sherlock could see how much this evening had meant to John. He had spent the vast majority of the day being ‘a slave to the cooker’ – a phrase Sherlock had heard but never quite understood (how can one possibly be a slave to an inanimate object with no conciseness or sense of thought, therefore unable to give commands and orders for one to obey and thus become it’s slave), until today. John had poured his heart and soul into making sure everything was perfect, and Mycroft had just ruined it.
An involuntary smirk creeped across Sherlock’s face.
“What about the snipers? The assassins?” John remembered the threat of death that had hung over his head, unless Sherlock was seen jumping and visibly dying. They had only been called off by Sherlock’s completely selfless act. Selfless, now there was a word not often associated with the consulting detective.
“I just- I couldn’t-” John began, but couldn’t quite form whole sentences.
But whenever he reached his limit, John remembered a tall, pale figure leaning over him, eyes empty, drowning in the unshed tears. He remembered the broken voice as the figure desperately tried to reach him through the crowd of homeless network that Mycroft had hired to stop him from getting too close. He remembered the exact moment where he had seen his best friend's world collapse around him.
He waited patiently on the tarmac for the Watsons to arrive, knowing full well that this would be his last conversation with them. A heavily pregnant Mary reached him first. They exchanged pleasantries before she moved aside so John could take her place. Sherlock dismissed his brother, pleading to let him have some privacy during their final moments together. Mycroft knew what Sherlock was planning to do; he knew Sherlock was finally going to tell John. After a quick look of surprise, Mycroft lead himself and Mary away from the two men so they could talk in peace.
Mycroft sighed, an action that caused a slight twinge of pain through his recently re-set nose. The bruising would certainly be impressive.
John continued to visit Mary’s grave. It was still hard for him to accept that she was gone. He spoke aloud to the gravestone sometimes – it helped him cope, and if he looked mad for doing so, well, John didn’t care.
When John Watson was a patient, he tolerated hospitals.
“I’m going to turn in.” John stifled a yawn, but there was no hiding anything from Sherlock, besides, he was being blatantly obvious.
“No,” she began to take a step towards Sherlock, a dangerous look in her eye that caused Greg to quickly grab hold of her upper arm, gently enough not to leave a mark or be considered aggressive, but hard enough that the warning in the action was conveyed with utter clarity. “I have a case to solve.” She shrugged her arm from Greg’s grasp and turned to glare at him. “Greg, I refuse to work with him. I absolutely refuse.”
John gave up with trying to get Sherlock to stop interrupting. The consulting detective pretty much did whatever he wanted in any situation, so why should John try to change things now? He looked back down at his tea and laughed quietly to himself, shaking his head slightly. Sherlock watched all of John’s movements. He was very fond of that smile, the way he would tuck his chin to his body and let out a small laugh. It was one of the many things about John that he was fond of, and it made Sherlock smile to know that he was the one responsible.
"Want to know what?"
“John,” Sherlock interrupted, holding the doctors arms with a look of caution. “You don’t need to tell them this if it makes you uncomfortable. If truth be told, listening to the description John was giving them was making Sherlock himself feel uncomfortable.
In essence, Sherlock was exactly the same person. He'd still made the same deductions about John after his return from the hospital, he still insulted people and preened like a peacock. He still dressed in a way that could make any Armani model jealous and even his experiments had gone unchanged. The only difference was that he was five years behind everyone else. If Sherlock had it within his capacity to become his friend four years ago when he'd entered the lab at Bart's with Mike, then surely-
"Her name was Victoria," a small, quiet voice began from the other side of the sofa. "We were at uni together, both chemistry graduates. She was
John flinched at the harsh words, but obviously not enough to warrant concern from Sherlock, who had now adopted his famous thinking pose, with hands steepled under his chin. Despite the situation, John felt sudden joy at watching the consulting detective as he was back in his element.
"Phone, please."
“Carter,” Lestrade warned.
"Seriously, John. That's starting to worry me now."
For some reason which was unknown to Sherlock, his sent hope and strength coursing though him. By watching John and concentrating on him and only him, Sherlock was able to tune out the never ending, torturous, mocking laughter.
"He'd used you as a target before John, twice before. Both occurrences nearly ended in one or both of our deaths. I can't help but feel that Moriarty will once again reach out and use you as a target, John. Only this time, if he does, I don't think we'll be able to get away so easily."
“I- You-” Sherlock’s mind struggled to make sense of what was happening. His mind went blank as he tried to piece together the evidence. John chose to take pity on the detective, moving over to him and pulling the violin out of his hands, resting it gently on the floor beside them. With Sherlock’s hands now empty, he had nothing to hold onto that could ground him into reality and he played out John’s rhythm over again in his head. John once again came to his aid, filling the empty space between Sherlock’s long, pale fingers with his own shorter, tanned ones.
“Anderson often looks like that, John.”
"I am perfectly capable of taking care of myself and do not need to be kept confined to this hospital bed in this hospital room which is the very epitome of boring."
"So," Sherlock continued to the both of them, "we can assume there was a struggle, meaning the people who took him relied on brute force, rather than laying out a trap. They were clumsy though, incredibly. They either drove up to him and grabbed him whilst still moving, or they were waiting for him as he approached before ambushing him."
Johnhad escaped with only bruising around his neck. He had managed to avoid a concussion when Moran broke his fall. Sherlock was being treated for shock and seemed to be recovering well, as the volume and tone of his voice indicated.
"I thought I'd lost you Sherlock." He didn't care that the sobbing was near hysterical. He didn't care that he was gripping Sherlock's shirt so tightly that he could easily rip the smooth fabric. He kept sobbing, finally letting out all the pain, all the hurt he had felt in the past two months.
The next day, whenever John was in the room, Sherlock’s agile and adept fingers would begin to tap out a repetitive rhythm.
John didn’t know how long they had stood there, but soon, the exhaustion began to creep in. He’d run out of tears long before, but the shaking hadn’t stopped. They hadn’t moved an inch, Sherlock still forming a protective, comforting barrier between John and the outside world, as if it could shield him from all the pain and heartbreak that Sherlock knew that John didn’t deserve.
.” His voice sounded disconnected, as if it didn’t belong to John at all. Sherlock had slowly returned to his full height, but the air of superiority had gone, which – if possible – made him look small, scared. John swallowed a few more times as he tried to gain control of his wavering voice before he continued. “Especially,” his voice was stronger now, and he was looking Sherlock straight in the eye as he addressed him, “an unfeeling, heartless machine. You’re not my best friend. You’re not even a shadow of him. My best friend was taken from me by a single blow to the back of the head.” John turned his head towards the floor so Sherlock wouldn’t see the gradual build up of tears in his eyes. Now was not the time for crying. He had done enough of that in the past few weeks to last him a lifetime. “And now, my wife is being taken away from me too. And taking care of her is a lot more important to me right now than you. You are a lost cause, Sherlock.”
John let out a huff of laughter, and finally turned back to Sherlock. A small, yet genuine smile was teasing the edges of John's mouth, and his eyes seemed to regain some of the life that had been missing from them since Mary's death.
There were not a lot of things that Sherlock Holmes didn’t understand.
Mary would have been so pleased to hear that Sherlock had regained his memory. She had wanted it so much when she was still with them. It was infinitely unfair that it had only happened after she died. Clearly the universe felt like John did not deserve both Sherlock and Mary. First, it had taken Sherlock's memory, making him unrecognisable as the man that was John's best friend. Then the universe had taken his wife, permanently. After taking Mary, it had returned Sherlock to him. It was a cruel game and john wanted to scream. There was no way of winning this twisted game that was his life.
“As soon as he heard what I had done and what had happened to me, he booked me on the first flight back to London, had a doctor examine me and then locked me up in one of his country home for the past two weeks. I would have come back sooner, but Mycroft is hard to escape from with all those bloody cameras everywhere! As soon as I was ‘discharged’,” Sherlock rolled his eyes, “ I jumped on a train and headed straight for London, got in a cab and headed here. Mrs Hudson had quite the fright when she saw me, as I’m sure you heard.” John recalled the sound of smashing China from the night before.
Molly closed her eyes and drew in a deep breath.
enlighten me," John muttered with as much sarcasm as he could muster.
3 hours was a long time for Sherlock Holmes to get himself into trouble. John didn’t like to think about what kinds of trouble, just that trouble was incredibly likely, if not definite.
Maybe one day, he would go back to Sherlock and try to help him again. It seemed unfair that he had to miss out on these things. John had his doubts that he’d be let back into Sherlock’s life after what he said. He was partially responsible for the rift that had been forced between him and his best friend – okay, almost entirely responsible.
“I’ll see you soon."
Of course, John stayed in Baker Street. It was illogical for him to be in any other place – as Sherlock pointed out to him on more than one occasion. There were arguments, nights where tempers had risen so high that both men saw red and something nearly always got broken. But a unrequested cup of tea, or a newspaper cut-out of a particularly interesting looking case in each other’s direction the following morning usually put things right.
Sherlock’s face broke into quite possibly the largest, most genuine smile John had ever seen on the detective’s face.
John's world shattered. He watched as Sherlock once again stepped up to the edge of the roof. The grip on his neck loosened slightly as Moran's attention turned to the man silhouetted across London's skyline, his beloved coat waving in the slight breeze. Josh couldn't watch. He turned his gaze to his feet, refusing to look.
"You did a pretty good job all things considered. But you're crap at taking care of yourself."
"That's a brilliant idea!" She almost sang. Before she could exchange any details, Sherlock grabbed John by the sleeve of his coat and propelled him towards another black, London taxi, which he seemed to just conjure out of nowhere.
Shit! He’d completely forgotten about Sherlock.
Alone was what he needed.
“You don’t make tea.”
"Speak to me about what?"
“Babe, you’re scaring me.” Sherlock could hear the worry in his voice.
“Her name was Samantha. And I told you, I was thinking about something else all night.”
Mrs Hudson sighed in relief, nodded her head and proceeded to help Sherlock bring John in through the doors and up the stairs to 221B. By this time, John was fully unconscious. Mrs Hudson said she didn’t think she could make it up to John’s room, so they put him on the sofa. Sherlock retrieved a few blankets from his bedroom and used them to cover John. He arranged the pillows to support his head and let him rest.
John made no effort to join the conversation, but continued to watch the exchange. Eventually, having drained her own mug, Mrs Hudson made her excuses and left John and Sherlock alone in the flat.
I'm sorry, John."
Sherlock had always seemed a little reserved around Mary. John was sure it was just Sherlock disliking the change that had occurred during his time away. John had moved on, and Sherlock needed to accept this. He was never rude to Mary, which was a relief. John knew how cutting Sherlock could be with his deductions about people, but he seemed to hold back anything he was reading from her.
He hadn't gone far, just to the stairs before his exhausted body dropped onto the top step, his hands burying themselves into the silver stands atop his head. He could still hear the music floating from he flat. The click of a door closing muffled the music slightly, and then slow, steady footsteps approached him as he sat there, cradling his own head in his hands and trying very hard not to feel the pain that was being communicated through Sherlcok's playing.
“I need all relevant information, and now,” ordered Sherlock, turning back to look at Lestrade.
“You and John work at the same surgery.”
"John," the sound of his deep, baritone voice reverberated around the whole room. "When you have stopped inflicting minor and unnecessary injuries on yourself will you pass my your phone? I need to send a text to Lestrade." Sherlock reached out his hand, his palm flat, expectant. When the phone did not come, he turned, his curls bouncing around again. John was staring at him, open-mouthed and wide eyed.
Sherlock had fallen hard and fast. They moved in together after two months, settling down as a couple in John’s tiny flat, but they were happy. They were introduced to each other’s friends and families and everyone had commented on what a sickeningly cute couple they were. And they were right, Sherlock and John were absolutely besotted with each other.
(See the end of the chapter for
Moriarty.
We are working on the situation Miss Hooper. I assure you he will return as soon as he has completed his task. - MH
“So why was it so hard? Surely it would have been exactly what you wanted?”
“Yes. I’ll be right there.” He hung up. His phone dropped to the floor. He held his head in his hands to stop it from spinning, the whole world was on a slant. He forced himself to gasp a few lungful’s of air before attempting to stand. His legs were clearly stronger than he’d given them credit for, and he felt them move automatically towards the door, stooping first so he could retrieve his fallen phone. He put his coast back on and headed outside into the world again. Although this time, there was no thrill of the chase, he couldn’t feel the blood pumping in his veins. John was numb, and it was very much just him, alone, against the rest of the world which seemed hell-bent on making John’s life as difficult, and as full of pain as possible.
“Yes, so what?” John challenged.
Mycroft had immediately moved into in Sherlock’s bedroom, making sure everything was to an adequate standard. John stood in the middle of the flat. He felt useless, alien, like he was invading an unknown territory. But that was ridiculous. 221B had always been home. Mycroft cleared his throat behind him, and John turned to look at the eldest Holmes brother – the only one with any memory of who he was.
Sherlock sighed.
Because with Sherlock Holmes, there would always be John Watson – best friends, colleagues, the Detective and his Blogger, whatever you will. And that’s the way John intended it to stay.
Sherlock pulled away. Obviously, Sherlock wanted to continue to comfort John, but there were more important matters that required his attentions.
“Sherlock,” he murmured, Sherlock turning his attention to John for the first time since they entered the room, “maybe we should leave.”
Sherlock said nothing, eyes still on John as Moran's grip around his neck tightened further.
"Please, don't tell anyone." Sherlock never said please. Maybe a few times if he wanted something from John, but usually, pleading was beneath him. Maybe this was why that one word broke Molly's heart a little.
Mary had sat with John on a bench outside as he cried. She had cradled him against her and whispered soothing words of comfort as he buried deeper, clinging on to what he had. He silently thanked God that at least one of them was okay. If a situation ever occurred that put both Sherlock and Mary’s life in danger, it would break him. For now, he breathed in the smell of her honey scented shampoo, and allowed her words to wrap around him like a protective barrier.
"He'll know."
More movement of pen on paper, a few photographs were taken. The next person stood up. Clearly, everyone was waiting their turn to ask their burning questions.
He could hear more movement from downstairs, for whilst he was thinking, there had been a small knock at the door. He heard the smash of a cup. John's eyebrows knitted together as his eyes moved toward the door. It was very unlike Mrs Hudson to drop anything, too much mess! He focused on the noise coming from below, trying to figure out what was happening.
He caught a cab back to Baker Street, surprisingly light traffic for London. He made his way up the stairs, listening carefully for any sounds of life. He desperately hoped that Sherlock had just gone out briefly, and had returned to the flat many hours before. But as John opened the door and was greeted by silence, he realized that this was a foolish hope. He deposited his coat on the hook behind the door, sat down in his armchair and waited.
"Any ideas what that was?"
Mycroft watched the reunion from the window. At the sight of the two men together, Mycroft stepped back, and made his way down the corridor. Officially his work was done. John had come home; both men were safe, Moriarty’s web dissolved.
There had surely never been so much ice, or viciousness in an accusation. Mycroft knew that some of his barbs Sherlock and he had exchanged in their verbal duelling matches could have been considered hurtful, but the way his brother regarded him now, was like a physical pain in Mycroft stomach. He had never seen such hatred, for it could not be mistaken. At this moment, Sherlock Holmes hated Mycroft, positively loathed him. He took another deep breath, trying to keep himself calm in the face of his baby brother’s emotional collapse.
Sherlock heard a gasp. Jason had known of his existence, but Sherlock had never allowed himself to talk about John.
"Have you been to Bart's?"
“Go to sleep Sherlock, I’ll be here when you wake up, I promise.
But Sherlock didn’t believe him. He didn’t think John knew what he was talking about. Sure, John would admit that the idea of being separated would be hard, but Sherlock knew that the problem was a lot bigger, and more complex than that. John would never know, but Sherlock knew.
"Sherlock-"
"If I had just told him what he meant to me as a friend."
“John, I’m not going to pretend I understand what Sherlock is going through. But I do know that I have a better understanding of who Sherlock is than you do.”
“Sherlock, have you ever actually read John’s blog?”
"Yes?" Mycroft looked expectantly at the surgeon, silently preparing himself for the worst.
Sherlock had solved the case quickly. It was similar to the case with the two kidnapped children – the case that had lead to Sherlock’s downfall. It was a footprint, which allowed Sherlock to identify the murderer. No one made a comment, not even Anderson, who accompanied them as part of the forensics team. Ex-lover, worked at the docks, not much older than the woman who he’d killed. He was jealous of the new guy in the young woman’s life. He’d gone to her flat, to pick up the remainder of his belongings that he’s left behind. There had been an argument. A neighbour had overheard loud voices coming from her flat, both seemed furious. He’d managed to hear some snatches of the argument, which Sherlock had listened to intently.
"Does it really matter, John?" Sherlock turned away, refusing to look at John.

"I was your best… friend?" John looked back up, determined to keep eye contact. The look on Sherlock's face immediately transported John back to the moment when he'd asked Sherlock to be his best man. That had been a shock. Sherlock could literally not wrap his brilliant brain around the fact that he was capable of being anyone's best friend. It felt like too much, but John persisted.
As she turned, her hair rustled ever so gently, and it looked like water shimmering  in a gentle stream on a spring afternoon. Everything about this woman seemed to scream elegant and professional
"I know."
Without conscious thought, Sherlock pushed open the door.
"Your... Your own?"
"Sorry." He was, he didn't want Mary to think worse of him. He wanted her to be happy in her final weeks.
All it took was a look from his best friend, just a look to know that something was incredibly wrong. John had coaxed Sherlock awake, and instead of being greeted with murmurs of his name or a hand reaching out, Sherlock’s brow had furrowed, eyes narrowing and he brushed John away.
Mary’s hand were wrapped tightly around his as they sat in the consultant’s office. Her eyes were watering, but she somehow managed to stay strong. Whatever it is that she was doing, she was doing it better than John was. He couldn’t bring himself to look at the consultant, and only a few words were registered. He wanted to block them all out, to deny everything that was happening, because it couldn’t be happening. Not to him. Not to Sherlock.
After establishing that he was most definitely in a hospital, John tired to think back to establish a reason for him being there in the first place.
“Sir? It’s your brother.”
It was a Tuesday when Sherlock purposefully sat down in his armchair in front of John. He didn't know why it was important that it was a Tuesday, Sherlock would have written off the detail as dull and useless. John didn't acknowledge his presence, choosing instead to keep reading his book. He only looked up when the man opposite cleared his throat, signaling to John that his attention was required elsewhere. John closed his book and set it on the small side table that was more often beside his chair than Sherlock's. John looked up towards his friend. A small gasp escaped his lips as he took in the whole of Sherlock's figure. He was thinner, alarmingly so. Damn, why had John not forced him to eat something? The circles under his eyes were the darkest John had ever seen on a person, making his eyes look sunken. This, combined with the extreme weight loss and Sherlock's already tall, slim figure gave the impression of a skeleton, and this terrified John.
And that is what broke John.
John turned his head and found him, being loaded into the back of an ambulance by yet more paramedics.
“Lestrade, I think it’s time we told the world about my little miracle.”
“Yes, about that, you’re not allowed to go off without me ever again.”
“I didn’t know it would be this hard – coming back. I always assumed that we would slip back into the routine. I thought I would solve cases, he would blog, and we would all drink tea.” He said, taking a sip of his own. “But I didn’t know, I didn’t anticipate just how much damage my leaving had caused John. I want to make this as easy as possible for him. I’d been thinking about it ever since I came back, and today I’d only just settled on a solution. I thought I needed to leave. A clean break, so John could move on with his life. I restrict that so much but just being present. I wanted to get out of the flat, so we planned a walk. I didn’t want to be recognised, hence this,” he gestured towards the uncomfortable disguise, “absolutely appalling outfit. So we took separate taxis. But John’s anxiety obviously built up more than I knew because even that brief separation caused him to have a panic attack.” His speech had become rushed, garbled. He felt that stirring inside him… sentiment.
Sherlock’s lips quirked a smile as John’s words stirred a memory in his head, momentarily eclipsing the pain.
“Sorry, yes this is Doctor Watson.” Odd. Nobody ever addressed him as Doctor Watson apart from Mycroft, and John had established that this call was not from Mycroft.
“I don’t want to ever forget you. I don’t want to ever be without you.”
It continued whenever there was a solid surface and John was in the room. Sherlock sighed in relief, and felt some of the tension that had been building in his body. He no longer felt like a tightly wound spring, and he felt himself relax more as he continued to tap out his message.
"Greg, I'm sorry but I have to go. Right now." John grabbed his wallet, threw a couple ten pound notes down on the bar and moved swiftly through the tables harbouring other patrons, leaving behind a confused Greg, until he reached the door.
"You never gave up. Even after everything you went through, you were still there. I'm sorry I wasn't able to do the same."
He looked like a man who’d just returned from the dead, probably felt like one too. But Sherlock made no move to begin the conversation, and waited for John to begin speaking.
“Because you cared about them.”
Once Molly had guided him through the front entrance, she whispered a number in his ear and gave him a general nudge in the direction of one of Bart's many corridors.
“You’re tired.”
It was a bright, sunny day. Mary’s favourite kind of weather.
"I’m sorry, I just needed some time to think. And now I think I owe you an answer.”
“He was a rubbish big brother.” They both smiled, John refusing to meet Sherlock’s eyes.
A nurse bustle into the room, moving efficiently past Greg as if he wasn’t even there and began to check John’s vitals, as well as adjust some of the machinery that he was plugged into. She tutted disapprovingly at the form of Sherlock lying with his head on the bed, and moved to wake him.
There was a murmuring on the other side of the line, and then Mycroft returned."He was seen on CCTV getting into a cab outside St Bartholomew's hosptial at 10.13pm. He was travelling for 10 minutes in the direction of Baker Street, but before reaching there, the cab stopped, Sherlock got out and confronted the driver, who then proceeded to drive away, leaving Sherlock there on the pavement. From the CCTV footage, he collapsed shortly afterwards. Two young ladies found him who, luckily, happen to be nurses who were returning home after their shifts at Charing Cross. They called an ambulance and have been with him ever since."
It was all so clear now. They’d just been so caught up in what was going on elsewhere in their lives that they’d failed to recognise the symptoms for what they were.
Instead she looped one of her arms through Sherlock's, who - surprisingly - raised no arguments, and continued to walk into the night.
John could feel the colour drain from his face. It was a good thing he was already sitting down because he didn’t think his legs would have been able to support him. He felt like the air had been rushed from his lungs and that his skin was simultaneously covered in fire and ice. He couldn’t force air to move into his body. He was frozen, paralysed. First Sherlock, and now Mary - his beautiful, strong, perfect Mary.
But he and Mary were both sensible people. They knew that it wasn’t okay.
Greg stood to the side, unwilling to interrupt this precious reunion. He was trying to blink back tears of his own but it was a useless effort. It was clear to anyone with a pair of eyes how much the two men had missed each other, how broken each of them had become during their separation, and how dearly they needed each other. He returned to his seat, continuing to watch the two. Between the mumblings, Greg was able to make out the words from Sherlock.
Bad idea. Worst idea in the history of bad ideas.
“Please wake up, Sherlock.” It was barely louder than a whisper
During the three weeks they had spent away from each other, when Mary was still alive, with breathe in her lungs and a beating heart, Sherlock had stayed with Mycroft. He’d gone back to Baker Street on the day he’d visited John and Mary.
It never happened. So Sherlock made a habit of reminding himself that the John he could see wasn't real.
“… lying little slut…”
did this, Mycroft.
John smiled up at Sherlock and planted another kiss on the detective’s lips as he tapped out his own response.
"You want to know," she repeated. Sherlock's hatred for repetition had rubbed off on John, who tried not to voice this.
He was so full of blind fury that the clothes were stuffed so forcefully, the seams of the bag were beginning to break. John didn't care. He needed to get home, and every minute he spent in Baker Street was a minute away from Mary.
“Most people are to you.” John remarked. The two men shared a short laugh, reminding them of the times they had spent laughing together before the fall. Sherlock’s eyes found the ashtray, still on the small table that separated him from John. He allowed himself to stare at it for a few moments, but quickly returned to his explanation when he could feel Johns eyes burning into him, watching his every move.
John laughed, and Sherlock felt a spark of pride for being the one responsible for that laugh. The stored the sound in his mind palace, knowing that he would replay t to himself over the course of the next few months, and if he had he way, it would be the last thing he remembered before he took his final breath.
“I miss you so much, John.”
She placed the cups of tea on the kitchen table and sat down. Sherlock walked into the kitchen and sat opposite her. He held his head in his hands closed his eyes. Mrs Hudson couldn’t bear to see him like this. She had to say something.
She moved next to the consulting detective. “Sherlock, the music was absolutely beautiful. I’ll want to hear it again come Christmas,” she joked as she felt Sherlock’s long arms wrap around her tiny frame.
The door to his cell slammed open, and two burly looking men shuffled in. John stood as they entered, trying to make himself appear larger and more intimidating. They never went too close to John, afraid of his famous temper. John laughed. How was he supposed to do anything whilst in chains? He wasn't bloody superman for crying out loud.
"Tut tut, Sherlock. I thought it'd just be you and me again." Moriarty stopped the song as he spoke, just before Sherlock began to rip his hair out. Since their encounter in the cab, 'Staying Alive' made his skin crawl and his head swim. Moriarty let out a long, dramatic sigh before standing up to face the consulting detective and the army doctor, the two contrasting extremely as they stood next to each other, shoulder to shoulder. Well, nearly - height difference was a bitch sometimes, especially when trying to present as a united front, but there was nothing that could be done. "Ah well. Shall we begin, boys? A game with three players was always more interesting than a game with two."
Sherlock’s eyes widened as he watched the movement of John’s finger. His mind whirled as he assigned letters and words to the tapping. Helpfully, John repeated his tapping.
“Oh, gosh… Um… Well, after you jumped from the roof-”
“I mean it John.”
“Christ,” John began, looking at his cup. “I never realised how much tea we actually dr-”
“I can’t. I can’t remember anything else.” He grabbed the closest item to him – one of John’s mugs that had been left on the mantelpiece above the fireplace – and threw it across the room. It missed John by inches, smashing into a hundred pieces against the wall to John’s right, but John didn’t even flinch, he was too focused on what Sherlock had just told him.
Sherlock closed his eyes as a stabbing sensation went through his chest. He didn’t hate jumpers, just the opposite, but Jason didn’t know that.
“No, I’m sorry the name isn’t familiar.” Another wave of disappointment flooded over John. “I’m calling because we have your wife, Mary Watson here with us. She collapsed this morning at work and was bought here as soon as possible. We’ve been running tests and should get the results of them soon. We’ll explain more thoroughly when you get here, I’m afraid she’s still unconscious, but we thought it would be best to contact you and you can be here when she wakes up.”
Sherlock waltzed into the building as if he owned the place, which Sherlock probably thought. John sniggered at his internal commentary, quickening his steps to keep up with the long strides of the aloof Consulting Detective.
"It still
“Nice.”
"I just wanted to tell you, because-" she paused, her voice catching slightly as she chocked on her own words, "because I don't think I've got long left, and I needed you to know." There were tears now. Her eyes were still firmly closed, but the tears still trailed down her face and onto the pillow. John wiped them away with his free hand, gently dragging the pad of his thumb along her cheeks.
John allowed a few more moments of silence to pass, before he voiced his first question.
Still Sherlock continued to disappear on the first Sunday of every month.
He took John's hand in both of his, encasing it gently, protectively.
They had planned to do nothing but lay in bed all day, just drinking each other in and lavishing each other with words of love and comfort and home. It was supposed to be the happiest that Sherlock had ever been.
As john continued to weep, a few words managed to escape his lips involuntarily.
“Oh, this is about Mary’s tumour.” Sherlock’s eyes narrowed as he obviously connected two points in his brain.
"I wish I could say the same for you, but I'm afraid I can't if you drug your opponent. Not in the spirit of fighting fair is is, Alvarez?"
“Neither do I.”
Everyday was a huge effort, and everyday John thought about giving up, just letting the next part of the web finally put an end to his efforts, to finally stop his never ending task. He'd come close a few times, and he was ashamed to admit it.
John's life continued in much the same way since he'd left London. Move to a new location, dismantle the network, move on. Every time he wished that maybe this time would be the final assignment, that he'd get to return home, to see his family, to see his friends, his landlady and most importantly, Sherlock. Mycroft had been withholding information about Sherlock, in the hopes that it would motivate John to work faster.
Blue, shimmering light danced across his mind’s eye, and the suffocating smell of chlorine filled his nose. There was John, above him once again. Always John. Always.
Greg had drained the last of his pint before clapping John once on the shoulder, it was probably supposed to be reassuring. It wasn't. Greg left him there.
Sherlock began to sob again, and John couldn't just sit there and watch him. He shuffled over to the lanky detective and wrapped his arms around the sobbing figure of his best friend. Sherlock's arms wrapped tightly around his back and fisted his hands into the back of John's jacket. It was desperate, and John wasn't going to deny Sherlock comfort in his hour of need. He stroked Sherlock's back, trying to soothe him.
He stood at the foot of the stairs, doing nothing, just staring at them. His feet felt as if they were made of lead, which Sherlock knew to be impossible, and yet he did nothing to stop a thought like that to rush through his mind.
“My brother gave me your address.”
They laughed together for a few moments, before Sherlock offered his hand to John.
Revealing to John that his attempted murderer was actually his wife was the hardest thing that Sherlock had ever done in his life, because he knew it was going to hurt John. So Sherlock sat with them both, he stayed clam, he was the strength when John could not be strong, despite the fact that he was bleeding internally, but that was okay, because John needed him, and Sherlock would not let him down.
“We know what-?” Lestrade began to interrupt.
There were a few moments of silence as Sherlock considered John's words. Whether or not they made any impact upon Sherlock was clearly unnecessary to the conversation, as Sherlock continued to speak as if John had not commented at all.
“Unnecessary, John, we have a case to solve,” Sherlock turned back to the wall of evidence, sidestepping Sergeant Carter to get closer to it.
Molly had been watching cautiously at this point. Sherlock had said John was fragile at the moment, but she would never have expected this reaction from the army doctor. She didn’t join in with his laughter, but waited timidly until he was finished. She chanced a smile at him, a nervous, tentative, weak smile, but a smile nonetheless. John beamed back at her. A glow seemed to be radiating from him, like a halo of light, rather than the dark rainclouds that had shadowed his face when he had first walked in.
They waited for a few more moments to settle. A few pieces of paper made there way into the office, but Sherlock and John refrained from laughing at the fresh wave of stunned faces. Eventually, after about 10 minutes, when all the information had been passed to Lestrade, they began to work.
Even Sherlock had made an effort to spoil his landlady. He spent the morning composing a special piece on the violin for the woman who had been a mother figure to him. It was slow, emotional and yet beautiful and uplifting. It was his thank-you. Mrs Hudson had loved it, and she enveloped John and Sherlock in a tight hug and she wiped a tear from her eye as Sherlock lowered the beautiful instrument in his hands.
