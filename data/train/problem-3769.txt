“Who asked out who? Sort of important,” Charlie questioned, leaning forward to get a better look at Castiel and Dean.
“Showing up late wasn’t a good first impression, was it? Shit. I’m already failing you.” Dean rested his forearms on the table, leaning forward slightly.
“Don’t say that. Don’t ever say that,” Castiel said, confidence seeming to appear out of nowhere. “Dean, if there really is such a thing as an ‘ideal romantic candidate’, no one suits the title better than you.”
Do you have any idea why Jack would've dropped them out here? And not at the bunker? Seems... kind of tedious of him.
Eyes narrowing, Chuck began to drum his fingertips against the tabletop. The rhythm was as erratic as it was firm— chaotic, yet assured. Much like the man, himself. “No, Castiel. It really can’t. Could you sit down, please? Gabriel, you’re dismissed.”
The devious glint in Castiel’s eye could practically be seen from inside the castle walls, shimmering in delight. “We’ll tell them that you’re a knight of the Infernal King’s, named Dean… Campbell. You were the head of security at the estate, but grew sick of the king’s abusive treatment. So, you betray him, aiding me and Claire in our escape. Then, we allow them to prepare the mating confirmation ceremony, which is surely at the ready. And, lastly, for lack of a better term… we fuck it all up for them.”
Dean laughed, barely quiet enough to avoid waking Summer. “Dude, she doesn’t even know any of this is
Dean was nearly shaking on the drive home. He blasted Led Zeppelin in an attempt to calm himself down, but his plan fell flat. He couldn’t shake the excitement, the nervousness, the absolute adrenaline rush he was experiencing. He was going on a hunt. With some guy he barely knew, but that part didn’t matter. At least not in those moments of exhilaration.
Benny and Charlie threw each other a quick look, before turning to stare at Dean. “Well,” Dean mumbled, absently scratching the back of his neck. “I don’t know if you’d like to hear it. So I thought I wouldn’t tell for, y’know, your own good.”
So, tickle Castiel surprised to find his father still perched at the head of the table. As relieved as Castiel was to discover that the food had yet to be cleared away, he almost lost his appetite to the uneasiness that was suddenly throttling his gut.
“Hello, Dean,” Cas says with a nod as he continues to approach Dean. For once, he’s seemed to have gained a sense of personal space; standing a whole three feet from the other man.
. That's all I need. Then go right on back to the whole "hands-off" shtick. Damn it, man, I never even got to tell him...
Lucifer simply shakes his head. “No. Well, I told you what I needed; now it’s up to you to do what you please. Goodbye.” Lucifer turns to leave, and Dean considers stopping him. Asking him more questions. Instead, he stands in place, staring blankly into the night.
“If you do this…” Dean muttered, scrubbing his eyes. “You gotta know that I’m coming with, right? I ain’t gonna stop you, ‘cause I ain’t in charge of you. But you sure as hell aren’t gonna do this alone.”
"Cas," Dean whispers, laying back down after he has gotten a good look at Cas's expression. Cas is grinning shyly, the oceans in his eyes glowing. "You're beautiful."
Or, at least, what was actually visible of said rider. Which seriously wasn’t much; an avalanche of hefty, dark wool that seemed to shimmer against the moonlit forest. The loose black cloak was dusted with snow, draped over what Castiel guessed was a substantial body.
He turned quickly toward the entrance to the kitchen. Castiel did the same. Standing there was Mary, hands covering her mouth, eyes bright. Charlie stood beside her, smiling as if she’d just witnessed a miracle. Which she really had, essentially.
Castiel cocked his head, frowning. “Why? I would just forget about him. He’s clearly a terrible person and isn’t worth your time.”
Jimmy proceeded to make a strange noise, something along the lines of a sigh and a gasp. “Of course I expected you to go through with it! I mean, yeah, I guess I didn’t exactly expect it to be easy. But I know that you’re ambitious. Even if you aren’t open about it. You want something out of your life,” he said.
Cas doesn’t know how to respond. His mouth feels immediately dry. Lucifer - or Lucy, as the rest of the family called him - and him have never had a pristine relationship. It started when they were younger; Castiel had adamantly fought their parents divorce, while Lucifer took it in stride - if not encouraged it. Cas found it difficult to forgive Lucifer for that.
Summer shook her head, stepping inside. “I don’t think I have any other option than to stay overnight, but it’s okay. I’ll take the floor.”
Dean put on a weak smile. What the hell had he just done? There was absolutely no way this could end well.
“Okay,” Dean muttered. “You’re probably gonna want to disconnect on me right here, but it has to do with Bobby’s lore.”
“How so?” Castiel asked. He wasn’t typically one to push Dean when he was uncomfortable. However, knowing that Dean had already told this apparently Earth-shattering secret to half the group, he felt too confused to think clearly.
Cas makes his way to the door, trudging slowly. He twists and tugs at the knob, revealing a large living space. Also empty in terms of life, although the space has very clearly been lived in. Papers and leftover plates sit atop the coffee table, a navy blue sofa sports a slightly out of place cushion, and rugs that have been bunched and folded at the ends cover the floor. Cas walks slowly into the space, still dreary eyed and blinking away the remnants of sleep.
Castiel sighed. “I mean it, Dean. Why? You probably hate me, considering how many times now I’ve messed up,” he said.
The five-and-a-half hour car ride could be boring as all hell, but Dean’s excitement was typically enough to keep him occupied. Visiting Uncle Bobby was always an adventure. At least, it was from Dean’s perspective. The reality of the situation wasn’t exactly thrilling. Half-assed meals and sweaty summer days. The stories that Bobby recited to Dean and his brother, however, were vivid enough to create a sort of unknown world around Dean.
“Hello, Mrs. Winchester,” Castiel said as Mary moved over to her son, throwing her arms around him in a similar fashion.
--and Cas SLICES OPEN HIS OWN THROAT, expelling the remainder of his grace... which isn't much, a puff of incandescent blue, fading away. Poof.
Castiel jolted back to life. He sighed. “I’ll do it,” he said, voice cracking. “But if I drop out after one semester, don’t be surprised.”
Castiel knew why he had said yes to Dean, that day just over a year ago. He had known it at the time, and definitely knew it now.
“Not really. I have tried a lot before. Maybe I should just continue trying to sleep. I’m sorry, I really shouldn’t have bothered you.”
Dean nodded. “Sounds good. So, how’s school been going? I already know the basics, ‘course, but feel free to fill me in on any details.”
Cas held his breath, anticipating the sharp-eyed witch’s professional assessment. She continued to squint upward, claw-like hands finding their way to her hips.
“I’m sorry,” Dean’s roommate said immediately, voice hoarse. “But I’ve been having trouble sleeping. I didn’t want to bother you. I tried meditating first, as well as reading. I even-”
Before Dean could respond, Michael and Lucifer seemed to snort in perfect harmony. But only the latter was bold enough to
With a hard huff, Castiel found himself slouching forward. This was just tiring. “That would be me,” he said, and the alpha’s expression turned curious, her brow cocked. “I take it you’re another… suitor?”
“You slip me a potion, we slip you one,” Castiel said. “They’ve brewed something just for you. It’s slower acting, though. And quite a bit more intense, once it hits. Hope you didn’t have any important plans coming up in the next… week or so.”
“Uh, yeah. Wait, no, not exactly. Kinda?” The alpha’s put-on confidence seemed to falter a bit, arms crossing over her chest, as if shielding herself from the interaction. If her discomfort had been merely dubious before,
“Uh, yeah. I live with my uncle. Surrogate uncle, technically. But he’s just as much family as a blood-relative, trust me.”
Of course, it had only been a dare that Dean had concocted for Cas. It was probably just to shock Castiel.
Still, just to be sure, Cas decided to go through with that Curses4U™ search; after all, he’d been rudely interrupted, the first time he’d tried. Despite the slew of relatively specific keywords (“bright blue glowing lit up abdomen torso passed out”), no results seemed to fit his case closely enough to warrant further research. Already, he’d hit a wall.
Dean looked off to the side for a moment, before turning back to face Castiel. “I mean it, man. If you’re gonna sleep in here, I’m not going to make sleep even worse for you by letting you hit the sack on a wood floor.” Dean paused to shrug. “I just don’t want you to be uncomfortable, okay? Now c’mon.”
“I suppose that makes sense. You cannot trust me. I understand why. You don’t want to put yourself at risk. Is that correct?”
“Hey, I wouldn’t be so harsh,” Dean muttered, turning his head to look at Sam. He sighed as he lay witness to Sam’s “bitchface” (Sam made that face often enough, Dean decided it needed a name). “Anyway. I sorta, um, wanted to ask your opinion on something.”
Pulling into a space that was definitely not a parking space, Dean flung open the door to his car. He made his way slowly over to the girl. Should he call 911? Maybe he should just see if she’s okay first.
“You don’t. I know that,” Castiel said. He successfully managed to yank away from Dean, scooting to the other side of the bed.
Jimmy stopped moving, finally turning to look the other boy in the eye. Although, he wasn’t so much ‘looking’ as he was flat-out glaring. “That’s not the point. Sure, of course I’m gonna break up with her. Of course. It’s this douchebag she slept with that I’m worried about.”
Dude, I’m actually glad that you didn’t tell me to knock it off. Feel totally free to at any time, though. I don't know what you have going on today, so I guess I don’t really know what to say. Shit. I guess I could let you know that you saved me, Cas. I wasn’t in a good place when I met you, and now I am, so I’m going to chalk that one up to causation. Thanks for that, man.
A wide grin spread across Castiel’s face. He was at his friend’s bedside now, arms crossed. “Thank you, Dean. The first meeting is tomorrow, seven o’clock, in the student union. Room 116. This means a lot to me.”
to happen; given the man’s remarkably horn-free skull, it was safe to assume he was a regular ol’ human.
Dean couldn’t help but raise both brows. While attempting to make begrudgement conversation with his neighbor three days back, the only real piece of information Dean had gathered was that Castiel would be in California for the holidays. Instead, he was outside, carrying what looked like a snow shovel.
Not long after his aborted attempt at force-feeding himself— formerly known as “dinner”— Cas opted to head to bed early. It hadn’t been an easy decision to make; he was consciously sacrificing time spent with Dean that
“Well, why can’t I at least do what you’re doing?” Castiel countered. “Maybe a gap year could be good for me.”
“Listen, Dad, I swear I’ll tell you what’s going on. Just not now. I really need to talk to Mom first.”
His hands were clammy where they rested atop a well-loved quilt. Castiel leisurely flexed his fingers, eyes adjusting. He yawned.
Cas left the hospital a week and a half later. Gabriel was the one to pick him up and drive him to his and Dean's apartment.
Castiel froze, before placing the dish he had been busy washing back into the sink. He turned to face Dean. His best friend and roommate sat at their kitchen table. The surface was compact, but it was enough space for the two of them.
Dean sighed, continuing to stare out the large window. Christmas Eve was going fantastic. The party consisted of a large chunk of Dean’s family and friends, and was a blast so far. Sure, Mary had pulled a few attempts at embarrassing him, but it came from a place of love. The much Dean knew for sure.
“Christ, how long have you been out here for?” the voice continued, all while Castiel’s senses clawed to the surface. “Let’s just hope your fuckin’ toes haven’t frozen off, by now.”
Dean stood just outside the older man’s bedroom. Bobby sat on the edge of his bed, pouring over a newly acquired book on wendigo lore. He looked up at the young man, who wore a small smile.
Cas sighs once more and throws his locker shut, thoughts nearly pressing against the inside of his skull.
Dean balked. “No offense, but, uh… I don’t know your culture or anything, but that’s kinda fucked up. For
They convened, once more, on the morning of the confirmation ceremony. Only, Gabriel had been brought in, and Claire was at peace with her own consciousness.
Mary sighed, taking another moment to speak. “I felt bad for him, honestly. He said that he just wanted something to do with you boys when we visited, aside from throwing a football around. Something to bond over. And his books were all he had. His stories. It started… it started the first time we visited. You were two, so I doubt you remember, but Bobby decided to tell you a ‘story’. This was just weeks after him and John met at that ridiculous car show. It’s also when I learned that Bobby had been a hunter in his youth. I wanted to pull you away and never come back, but I also wanted to see John with a friend. And Bobby said… he said that he would guarantee with his heart and soul that you wouldn’t grow up to be hunters. That he would present the lore to you as total fiction.”
sure as hell would have been an inconvenience, likely ending in a castle guard with a broken nose. Maybe a shattered femur, if Castiel were feeling spicy.
As Dean serves the almost perfectly done pancakes, Cas watches his movement meticulously. Dean is clearly tired, his motions slow and slightly stuttered. Cas feels a mixture of guilt and flattery rush over him.
would just have been a petty curse, but Cas would have understood. Some people simply found deeper value in upholding their preferred aesthetics.
Castiel hyperventilates for a moment before responding, “I am sorry. I forgot that I had a test to make up. I… never intended not to come.”
Gabriel nods. “Gotcha. So, you two gonna get back together? Don’t get me wrong, I’m thrilled. You two were effin’ soulmates. I’m just worried about you, little bro.”
With a long and maybe slightly exaggerated breath, Castiel popped up from beneath the covers. He squirmed until he was sitting up at Dean’s side. “I don’t believe my father knew much, aside from what was already popular belief. At least, I can’t see how he could have known anything more, if he hadn’t interacted with you firsthand.” He shrugged, clutching a pillow to his chest.
Still a good several feet from the bed, Castiel stalled in his approach. If Dean wanted to have a serious conversation, then it probably wouldn’t be smart to jostle his instincts any further. “I promise, I’m not doing this because of pressure, or because I feel like I owe you anything. Believe me, if I
cursed. And we have, like, no clue what’s goin’ on. So, first off, we’re gonna need a diagnosis, if you can give us one.”
The street was silent for a moment before Dean continued. “Okay. Okay, then why do you look so fucking terrified right now? If you could kill a demon like that, I’m pretty damn sure you could do the same to me.”
Dean chuckled. “Except, you know that’s not true. If there’s something wrong, you know I wanna do what I can to fix it. Especially if it has something to do with me, which is the vibe I’m gettin’ here.”
Should he “slip” Dean a note? There probably isn’t much of a point; this is only a cry for attention
Standing firm, Dean waits-- resolve before fear. He dons the JACKET MARKED BY CAS'S HANDPRINT, stain untouched.
Cas shakes his head, expecting the thoughts to fly out. He’s finally come to accept it, at the very least; despite what Dean had done, Cas was unmeasurably in love with the man. Breaking up with Dean now stood as one of Cas’s greatest regrets. Facing Dean in this sort of scenario didn't seem possible.
A moment later, Dean can feel a wetness against his neck. He can feel the increase in Cas’s breathing.
“I was thinking that we should head down to Alfred’s house immediately,” Castiel stated, as if that was the perfect segway.
He stopped speaking instantly as the woman’s brown eyes decided to try on something new for size. They flashed to black.
for your help. Although, seeing as you’re clearly not gonna want to leave here, I guess I do have to… revise my plan, just a bit. But the basics of my proposal are still gonna stand.”
? Since now, apparently. Goddamn it. Then again, maybe it wasn’t entirely pity. Castiel just seemed so genuine, for the first time. As if everything prior had been a facade, albeit an unintentional one.
Again, Charlie nudged him, although with more pressure than earlier. “Dude, I’m serious. I just know that if anyone’s gonna be able to give us a clue, here, it’s gonna be
At last, Dean craned his neck to look toward Castiel, his features softened by adoration. The alpha’s scent, for the first time, was saturating to air. Heating and tugging at the omega’s limbs. Dean practically preened as he grinned up at his mate; even Benny let out a lazy chuckle from over his king’s shoulder.
omega mate, who had just been busy doodling on a cloth napkin with his fingertip and some scavenged ink. He was now frozen in his seat. Also squinting, right back. Frowning.
“I really don’t wanna make you feel pressured, or like you owe me anything.” The omega only faintly heard the “
Defying all known logic, there he was. Castiel was walking toward Dean, staring at him with shockingly relaxed features.
After squirming a bit in his seat, finally, Castiel bared his neck to the alpha. “Please, let’s just get this over with.”
“Hey, Cas,” he said. “I can call you Cas, right?” Dean stepped to the side and gestured for Castiel to enter. He did.
“Hey, ah,” Dean starts, eyes fluttering around the hallway, almost as if they were too nervous to meet Castiel’s. As if that was possible. “I was just wondering if you wanted to go with me down to my aunt’s restaurant. I mean, she’s not really my aunt, but she pretty much is, y’know? Anyway, whaddaya say?”
“So, Dean,” Ellen started. “I wanna know. How’d this romance between you two start? Been friends for so long, seems like it would be a difficult transition.”
To Cas's hardly containable irritation, Rowena let out another giggle, sleek as ever. “Well, you see, dearie, it’s really just a simple process of elimination. The more uncommon the spell or the curse, the more likely it’s outsourced from fringe magic. It’s as simple as that, really.” She drew back her hand, joining her palms together atop her heart. “Of course, we’ll have to do some further investigation to understand what, exactly, is the matter. Now, think of it like a fun little puzzle— in that light, your predicament will feel far less harrowing. Hm?”
Castiel shook his head, taking a closer look at the screen. “So you go by ‘impaladude1967’ on here,” he commented. “Fitting.”
Dean swallowed. “Listen, you’re probably not going to believe a word of this. But it happened, I swear to god.”
Silence. For heaven’s sake; Castiel was near jumping out of his skin, which was beginning to feel a bit too snug for comfort.
Castiel froze. He turned to face the other man, but failed to say anything. Dean had expected to see a scowl of some sort. Instead, he was met with a look of confusion.
And in this particular instance, Castiel, the intended victim, was the one benefiting. The irony was just
someone? Was it serious, or simply a one-time miracle on an otherwise forgettable morning? There was certainly a chance that he had just been saved a visit to Urgent Care.
Dean’s teammate has stopped laughing. Instead, he knits his eyebrows and speaks in a low tone, “Then you’d just be another fuckin’ fag.”
Dean had looked away for just a moment, he swore, when he heard a rapping on his window. He jumped in his seat before turning to confront the noise. Castiel stood there, hunched over with a small frown on his face. Dean rolled down the window.
Dean nodded. “And you’re exclusive to me. So, I guess that would make us exclusive. Okay. Off to a good start.”
Gabriel huffed— as usual, unwilling to mask his exasperation. “Cas. Bro. You know good and well that I’m not gonna buy that,” he said. “C’mon, at least come back inside.”
The obligatory resistance eventually came to pass, and the pair found themselves in a grassy field not too far from the rear of the estate. Dean’s prized mare, Chevy, was tied to a nearby stump, having just finished her own breakfast prior to their leaving. She seemed content as ever. Surprisingly, so did Castiel.
Castiel shakes his head. “I… I don’t know. I will have to explain… additional pieces of information to Lucifer. I feel as if it would simply make the conversation more complicated.”
Castiel grunted in reply, face burrowing deeper into the covers. He’d managed to at least finish dressing and washing himself, but had proceeded to flop right back down onto the mattress, face-down. It was just so damn
Oh, be quiet. However you got here, I certainly suspect it isn't easily replicable, correct? I've taken many a precaution, over
God, he felt like a fucking lab rat, though. A genetic freak of a rodent, caged off from the rest of its whiskered brethren.
Meg shakes her head, openly dissatisfied with the dishonesty in Dean's response. "Somehow I find it hard to trust you. Varsity quarterback suddenly asks out same-sex school outcast. Seems a little sketchy, doesn't it? I don't know why you're doing this, but if and when you hurt Castiel, you will find yourself in a pretty sticky situation. Got it, meathead?"
Evidently, Dean had pulled out a small black box. Tucked inside was a ring; of the diamond variety, with a faint glint as a result of the bedside lamp.
“College,” Castiel said, voice weak. He sounded like he’d been gargling nails. He turned away from his brother, looking across the room instead. “I got an acceptance letter from Northeast Kansas University.”
“I’m trans,” Castiel blurted. He could only hope that Dean’s raised brows were a result of him inadvertently speaking louder. “Ah, transgender. I’m transgender.”
"Hell yeah it would! Now we're getting somewhere. Do you have a lock of Elizabeth's hair?" Dean asked.
Between the hours of seven and eight the following evening, Castiel and Dean’s dorm was quiet. Castiel found it to be valuable study time.
It was a bit cold for a walk, although Dean had been determined to fit as many layers onto Castiel as he could manage. The man loved a good challenge— leaving his mate in three layers of his stuffiest hand-me-downs.
Dean followed Castiel for a few feet, until they reached the front door. Castiel opened it carefully.
“This post is… long. And descriptive,” Castiel observed. He continued to read, and Dean was shocked that his heart didn’t leap out of his chest. “Who is it about?”
Dean stares into his own locker, eyes like glass. He tries to ignore the fact that his face is obviously a deep red, or that he is experiencing a series of repetitive shudders. Fuck, he’s not supposed to get like this, no matter how nervous. What would John say? Probably not much as he takes a swing at Dean’s right cheek. Maybe he’d throw in a quick “faggot” before he storms away.
“Hey, uh,” Dean began speaking early one morning, voice cracking from disuse. Castiel was still curled around a pillow to the alpha’s side, his body all but submerged in blankets. “I got a question. You don’t have to answer.”
Those were a demon’s eyes, all right. They were… very pretty, actually. Mesmerizing, almost. Warm. Castiel hadn’t expected that.
Rather than be naïve, why not just be… dead? As hesitant as Castiel was to put his faith in an afterlife, surely, whatever awaited must be more satisfying than…
Castiel could feel his mouth hang slightly open. Still, he turned to look Dean in the eyes. Dean wore a sheepish grin, and he was definitely closer to Castiel than he had been before.
Cas reaches his locker one day, with a sliver of excitement. He acknowledges that the letters enthral him; he has quickly stopped denying that. However, he knows that Dean and him can’t be together. But that doesn’t  mean that Cas wasn’t still intrigued by the man.
Reveal a WOODEN DESK. On top, an old-school register and an off-kilter STACK OF HARDCOVER BOOKS. On the floor, a dead houseplant. At the register, a half-asleep TEEN GIRL-- MACIE, via her name tag.
“Cas,” Dean says softly, attempting to sound as calm as possible - despite the fact the he is far from calm. “I wanted to tell you… to tell you why I asked you out.”
“Uh, hey, Cas? Somethin’ goin’ on over there?” Dean asked. He took a swig of his beer, waiting for Cas to collect himself.
“I understand it’s been awhile,” Castiel started slowly. “But I… I can’t sleep. I’ve been trying for hours.” He heaved another sigh.
It took a couple of minutes for the door to open, and Dean had been preparing to leave and try again later. When Castiel had appeared, however, he’d been covered in green paint. For approximately three seconds, Dean thought it was sort of cute.
Dean let out what could only be read as a sigh of massive relief. “Thank god. I lied. I was hoping you’d say that.”
While Castiel had little to no recollection of falling asleep, all in all, his response to waking in an unfamiliar bed was… indifference. Really, it was a testament to just how displaced he felt in his
“Just listen, Sammy. Listen. I know this whole thing’s gonna sound fuckin’ insane. Trust me, I’m not gonna pretend everything’s just peachy. But after I ganked the vamp… I ran into a hunter. Well, I actually ran into him first at a bar, technically. That doesn’t matter. Guy’s… kinda strange. Not creepy strange, just interesting. Anyway, his name’s Cas. He, ah, sorta invited me on a hunt. In Iowa. Bobby’s pissed, but I’m headin’ there right now. Just thought I should keep you in the loop.”
Or a curse, even? Although, it would have been hilariously counter-productive for an act of vengeance to
"Return here in an hour to catch the portal. I left Castiel's blade on your bed. Take it with, but keep it very well-concealed..."
Castiel nodded. “Elizabeth… she was very sick,” he said vaguely. “She chose not to pass away in a hospital setting. So, unfortunately…” Castiel trailed off.
“Logically, I realize I should have known you wouldn’t have been,” Castiel said, a weak smile beginning to form. “But it’s still very anxiety producing. The process of telling someone.”
About three hours into the drive to Sargent, Summer and Dean hadn’t spoken of anything aside from the occasional “You holding up?”. The GPS spat out significantly more dialogue than the two of them combined. Dean was surprised by how quiet Summer had suddenly grown, considering how talkative she’d been the night previous. Still, the hunter didn’t question it.
“Wait,” Dean calls. Castiel gives him a look of raw interest. “Could you get us a chocolate milkshake to share?”
of shattering glass that Castiel sprang back to life. He left the library, bounding down the stairwell.
As they began to drive, Castiel punched a number into what Dean now realized was probably a burner. Why else would the guy be using a cheap flip phone?
He held back a snort at the thought. Well, it seemed he’d just have to begin taking pride in his role as… royal yet maggot-laced piece of late-season produce.
Still, he couldn’t help but feel like he was wasting this opportunity. Wasting time. Him and Dean were a couple, possibly just for that day.
It was the nicest day since the start of summer, and Castiel was busy closing all of the curtains in his home.
Before he’d even had much of an opportunity to respond, Gabriel had all but flung himself at his younger brother. He squeezed tight as he could manage without cracking a rib or two, and Castiel quickly reciprocated.
Dean didn’t even bother to knock, opting to throw the door open and step inside, Castiel just behind him.
The door creaks open. Sam appears on the other end, looking slightly awestruck. “Um, Dean,” he starts. “I’m pretty sure some guy who says he’s the devil is at our door. And he asked for you.”
While Chevy seemed irked by the impromptu journey, she turned up her muzzle and complied. It was clear enough that she preferred sticking to her routine. And, Castiel really couldn’t hold it against her—
Rather than continue to dawdle on the sidelines, King Chuck seemed to get the message. “Yes, well… dinner will be soon, so prepare to be fetched for that. Otherwise, I suppose I’ll leave you all to get settled in. Sleeping arrangements will be made for Dean.”
Dean took a few more steps inside, and he could hear Castiel close the door behind him. He turned to face the dark-haired hunter.
“He’ll be fine,” Castiel muttered with a shrug, as Chuck finally collapsed to the floor. Silent, but breathing. “We should probably be heading out, though. It’s getting a bit late.”
Headlights appear in the distance. Castiel springs to his feet, hopping down the porch steps. To his luck, a familiar muscle car pulls up in front of his home. The window rolls down, revealing a cheeky looking Dean Winchester.
A green post-it note is laying on the floor of his locker. It doesn’t look like one of Cas’s own notes (he doesn’t remember purchasing green), and it has what looks like hurried writing scrawled across its face. Cas blinks a few times at the note before picking it up.
“I don’t know if you’ve forgotten,” Castiel said. “But our houses are quite close together. I’d rather you didn’t blare
Castiel nodded, leaning back against the counter. What Dean was saying was true. Sure, they’d lived together for five years. That was totally within the realm of platonic. “Okay,” Castiel said. “And you don’t try to explain that we are not together?”
“You have my consent, I guess.” Chuck shrugged. “Although, I’d certainly like to hear more about these visitors from Sir Campbell, if possible. As a further safety precaution. Keep an eye on them, in the meantime.”
“My partner… first, let me just tell you, he’d helped me a lot. Probably saved my ass at one point. That’s in his defense.”
Aside from, y'know, guilting you into taking the night off and showing up to family dinner, every now and again.
Castiel peered downward. “No. I’m not,” he said, looking back up and directly into Dean’s eyes. “Could you really not tell?”
I actually drafted this chapter back in November, but finally got around to revising it. ;w; Also, chapter four is outlined, and chapter five is pretty much fully drafted. (A chapter from midway through the fic is also written, since it's one of my fave planned scenes, and I'm impatient skldhshdkgldg)
Castiel looked down for a second or two. “You said before that you were considering calling her. Maybe she could help you work through this… situation?”
Before Kaia could respond, Dean added, “Yeah, and unless my geography has gone to shit, I’m pretty sure Dreamwälk is no where freakin’ near here.”
“Yeah, um,” Dean rubs the back of his head and looks around the hallway. Almost exactly as he did when he first asked Cas out. “I got your letter Cas. Um, Castiel. Anyway, I just thought that the letters were getting a bit weird, k’know? Didn’t want to freak you out. Thought you may have been too nervous to ask me to stop.”
Dean sighed. “Listen, I’m retired, okay? Mostly. I just handle a haunting here or there, but otherwise, retired.”
“We need to return to your car, first. We already have more than enough salt, although some iron may be helpful.”
And then there was the fear that Cas would find out via another source - which, would bring the severity of the situation up a whole new level. Gavin seems to have lost any interest in letting the truth fly free, and the rest of the team couldn’t care less anymore.
“Hey, Ca-” Sam freezes as his and Cas’s eyes meet. Sam stares for a moment, mouth slightly agape. “Um,” Sam continues. “Sorry. Nice to meet you, Cas.”
The righteous and titanium-skulled Sir Richard Roman of Leviathania— or “Dick,” as Dean had gleefully nicknamed him— was by no means the last alpha to limp out the front entryway. God, no.
And… walk. Just walk. Aimlessly, until his legs and his sides began to cramp. Until his fingers, despite being tucked up into his sleeves, began to burn against the frigid air.
“Yes,” Castiel said. “A friend of mine reached out to me after the recent death of his second wife. By his account, he watched as she was thrown off of a third floor balcony. By what he believes was the ghost of his first wife.”
She was still blanketed by Claire, who seemed to have no plan of standing down. Nor speaking, instead choosing to bury her face in her girlfriend’s thick hair.
Dean lifts his eyebrows. “C’mon, you gotta have something else. Even if you don’t have the time to do it.”
“Uh, hey,” Dean said, throwing on a grin. “My name’s Dean Winchester. I’m your new neighbor. I just thought I’d-”
“Oh, um,” Castiel appears absolutely flustered. Hasn’t the guy ever ordered from a restaurant before? “I’ll take a regular hamburger, no lettuce, please.”
“Hey there,” a redheaded woman said, flashing a grin. “What are you boys doing out so late?” Dean could hear snickering from the back seat.
At that point, Dean had thrown open the trunk - which, he’d thankfully left unlocked. He’d have to pat himself on the back for that potential disaster later.
Pretty sure I didn't even tell you how I got here, man. Never said it wasn't replicable, did I? If I gotta devote the rest of my damn life to ensuring that yours is a waking nightmare, then so frickin' be it.
Castiel turned, only to see his father sitting back, grinning manically in the front row. The omega could no longer contain a sneer, as it finally pushed to the surface.
Castiel’s eyes widened. He had to be misinterpreting the other man. Or maybe his ears were shot. There had to be some sort of miscommunication in play. Still, he ran with what he had heard. “Are what, Dean? A couple? Why would you tell them that?”
Halfway into the forty minute drive, Dean removed his right hand from the steering wheel and interlaced his fingers with Castiel’s.
Castiel didn’t return the kiss immediately, which allowed Dean a second or two to panic. When Castiel did began to move his lips against the green-eyed boy’s, however, Dean felt every molecule of his body relax. He sunk into the kiss, enjoying the feeling of Castiel’s arms woven around his neck.
“After this we should be able to rebury Elizabeth,” Castiel said, staying true to his usual distance from Dean. Which was pretty damn close. “The fire has most likely burnt out by this point.”
Cas couldn’t help but pick up on Dean’s smell; soap mostly, but there was still a hint of whiskey and something that Cas couldn’t pinpoint.
“Oh,” Castiel made sure to say, “I hope you don’t mind, but we’ve already taken care of the mating bite, for safety purposes during our travels. Otherwise, we have yet to consummate the union.”
. He was initially willing to sympathize with his body— it wasn’t as if he usually crashed at seven o’clock on a Saturday night. Internal adjustments would have to be made, surely. After all, he was a man of… semi-strict routine.
He punched in his parent’s home phone number, holding his breath as he did. Dean still wasn’t entirely certain why he was listening to Castiel. Maybe it had nothing to do with the angel. Maybe he just knew that it was time to be honest with his mom. Even if that time was just past midnight.
“No, it wouldn’t,” Jimmy said. “We’re different, Cas. I know you. If you don’t jump right into something, you’ll find the time to talk yourself out of it. Please, man. You’ll be happier in the end if you stop overthinking it. And I promise, I’ll be there to support you, every step of the way. Got it?”
“I’ll go get that,” Dean said, taking a few steps back before turning around. He practically dashed toward the door.
Dean forced a smile. “Good job, man,” he said, giving his friend two pats on the back. “Now can you tell me who you’re head over heels for?”
Castiel couldn’t help but lean forward, as well. It was like Dean was emitting some kind of magnetic pull. “Well, before we begin to form concrete opinions regarding one another, we should start simple. What’s your last name and major?”
Castiel began to drift closer to Dean, until he was leaning his head on his maybe-boyfriend’s shoulder.
“Sure. Oh, I got a pretty big parliament meeting in the afternoon, though. Think you’d be okay waking up a bit early?”
“Nah, you’re not. I’m not the first,” Dean continued, measuring his speech. “I know that much. I mean, I haven’t
The laughter intensifies, causing Dean to shudder. He isn’t one to admit it - varsity quarterback and all - but he prefers not to be the center of attention. Particularly when he’s the potential victim of a dare that could wreck his reputation. Not that Dean cared about reputations.
“It… it does have to do with you,” Castiel started, still refusing to look at Dean. “But it’s also not your fault. And there’s nothing you can do to fix it.”
He began flexing his fingers against the dirt. Castiel’s limbs were still stiff as all hell, prickling and returning to life alongside his own self-awareness. Which, certainly wasn’t proving itself efficient.
“Aw, c’mon,” Lucifer starts, strolling leisurely across the room. “We’re all brothers here. How about we make it a family conversation?”
Internally, Dean had become a wreck. Still, Cas didn’t have to know that. It would only cause him more anxiety, as if school wasn’t stressing out the poor kid enough.
To his relief, he was quickly able to gauge his general location within the estate: the ground floor, apparently. Through the narrow, stone-lined windows spanning the halls, Castiel managed a good look at the snow-drenched lawn and mouth of the forest. Interestingly enough, much unlike what he was accustomed to, the interior architecture was hardly uniform. Each window was
"Yes," Meg responds, cutting Dean off. "It'd be just dandy if we could talk now. Right now, in fact. Are you dating Castiel?"
“So…” Claire hesitated, seeming to eye the mating bite, which was peeking out from beneath Castiel’s loose-fitting collar. “Would I also be correct to assume that you’re happily spoken for? Let me guess, by the Infernal King himself? ‘Cause if that’s the case, I gotta admit, this whole thing just got a shitload more entertaining. Scandalous, but like, in a good way.”
brimming sink. Dean pulls Castiel in once again; Cas expects a another kiss, most likely a more passionate one, although instead he is hit with an amorous hug.
welcome and valued, especially since I'm still reorienting myself into writing Destiel fic again. :'D
“Yes,” Castiel said. “A friend of mine reached out to me after the recent death of his second wife. By his account, he watched as she was thrown off of a third floor balcony. By what he believes was the ghost of his first wife.”
“No, it’s okay,” Castiel said. “I prefer it over Castiel, anyway. I’m guessing everyone else is that way?” Castiel pointed down the hallway, toward the sound of chatter.
“Cas, what’s wrong?” Castiel could feel a hand rest on his shoulder from behind. The voice was gentle.
“Dude, dude, dude, I can’t fuckin’ believe you actually did it. You took the kid on a date? Dude, you’re insane.”
Castiel nodded, finally looking back at Dean. His features were unreadable. “I suppose I’ve held this in for long enough. It’s probably reached the point where it’s no longer healthy, to be honest. I… I should just tell you. As difficult as it may be.”
The pair had been taking a breather in the library. Dean sat across from Castiel, separated by a refectory table. The alpha was taking a much-needed power nap, bent forward, head cradled atop his forearms. With each breath, his horns scratched lightly at the tabletop.
Despite Castiel’s empty stomach and the crashing temperature, he refused to leave his garden nook. He wasn’t ready to head back inside, not quite yet.
just dumped in my damn office! How the hell'd they even get in there, anyway? Could've sworn I locked that door...
They ate their meal in peaceful silence. Cas didn’t even need to block Dean from wandering over to the couch; he must have got the message with the unfamiliar set table.
to understand what his mate was going through. He needed to be able to provide the proper support— the support that Dean deserved.
I have noticed that your daily letters have stopped. I enjoyed them greatly, and was wondering if you could continue. If that is not possible, an explanation is not need. I simply wanted to let you know.
Dean chuckled and grinned. “Yeah, ah, I remembered. Actually, if I’m going to be honest with you, I’ve been planning this for months.”
— no, absolutely not. But Dean was eager, and by god, Castiel was more than willing to accommodate that.
“Dude,” Dean says with a small laugh. “You of all people have nothing to be sorry about.” Dean noticed that (out of habit, probably) his hands have migrated to Cas’s narrow hips.
Dean attempted to close the laptop, but Castiel blocked him. “It’s nothin’, man. Don’t worry about it.”
, really-- since I... truly felt like an angel. My outlook, my emotions, my bonds... they've all become so incredibly
He hears a knock on his bedroom door. His dad is out on business once again, so he doesn’t have to bother guessing who it is. He can distinguish between knocks, anyway. “Sammy?” he calls.
Was he missing something? Oh, god, he was absolutely missing something… something glaringly obvious, probably, knowing his own social awareness. Well, maybe he should just crack an unseemly joke to lighten the mood. Dean loved an awful pun whenever it came time to gloss over a tense moment. Yeah. He’d just—
This is where Cas’s stance cracks. His face is filled by shock and something close to desperation. Anger flickers in his eyes.
Dean had pulled back a few inches, and was smiling sweetly at Castiel. For a fleeting second, Castiel forgot that the smile likely wasn’t genuine. He could only imagine how uncomfortable Dean must have been in that moment. Although Castiel wasn’t the initiator of the kiss, he couldn’t help but feel guilt swell in his stomach.
Arrogance was sure to be a legacy of Chuck’s rule, or at least, Castiel could certainly hope. He sure as hell didn’t deserve to be remembered for his tax policies, which were flimsy at best and regurgitated from the maws of monarchs prior.
“Dean,” Cas starts. “That is not you at all. And I don’t care if I’m the first man you’ve dated. Although, I do know that you are everything I could have ever imagined. You are kind, caring, compassionate, talented, determined, and you want so badly to protect me. It would be selfish of me to ask for more. It would be impossible to ask for more, Dean. You are everything to me.”
If anything mattered to Cas during that casually nihilistic time following his quarter-life crisis, it was his Saturday afternoon ‘bonding’ sessions with Dean. Each week, they slumped on opposite ends of their thrift-tier sofa, quietly grading the assignments of their respective students. Instrumental rock pulsed through phone speakers and took over most of the surrounding air, alongside beats of note-taking, typing, and periodic tongue-clicking.
“Follow me to the back, now,” Rowena sung, re-seizing Cas's attention. “I’ll dash back out if I’m needed, but for now, privacy would be best.”
“Y’know,” Dean said, softly across the shrinking distance. “This would probably be easier if I could scent you.”
Dean lays in bed that night, listless, almost grieving his short conversation with Castiel. He had never imagined that he would speak to Cas again, that he would ever be even that close to those pale lips. He would get to continue writing the notes; which was great, but the one-sided interaction had failed to mend his broken heart.
“Boy, you weren’t destined for nothin’. But I’m not even gonna touch that with a ten foot pole for now. Be honest with me. What got rid of the enthusiasm for ya?” Bobby asked.
Dean grinned. “Great. Trust me, it’s awesome that you think tonight is just an exception. I mean, um, since you need your sleep.”
Flustered, Cas takes a few seconds to reorganize his thoughts. “Um, yes. I wanted thank you… for making breakfast.
Cas's muscles stiffened on reflex, gaze sinking into his outstretched forearm. Freshly towel-dried skin was now slick with the sheen of froth and espresso. Cradled loosely in his opposite hand was a half-empty mug, Han Solo decal fixing him with a lopsided smirk. Heh, fitting.
“Well, okay. Then lets sit and stare at a wall on it. Is that what you did when I took that nap earlier?” Dean asked, cocking an eyebrow.
And all it took was the narrowly avoided end of the universe. Gotta love some good ol' Midwestern repression.
Claire chuckled, and Castiel threw a wink, before releasing her hands. He turned toward the paling king, cape swooshing. “Father, I would apologize for misleading you like this, if you hadn’t earned it with your own shitty actions.” He stepped forward, signaling to Dean with a nod of his head. “You think your scheme
“I’m sorry, Cas. But at our first opportunity, we’re gonna have to part ways.” Dean didn’t understand why he was being so gentle with Castiel. The angel had lied to him about pretty major details. Dean wanted to be angry, wanted to hold a grudge, but he just couldn’t find the energy to do it.
“What she said,” Dean grumbled, clearly disappointed that he’d lost the opportunity to raise the point, himself.
“Sure as hell you’re losin’ it,” Bobby muttered. “Dean, you gotta get that thing outta there. I don’t know what it is, killing demons with its bare hand, and that’s hardly a good sign. Listen, I may be saying this because some part of me has gone non compos mentis, but I’m willing to at least accept that you’re hunting. It’s mostly my fault, anyway. But that’s not gonna last if you act like a goddamn careless idjit.”
Dean stared ahead, avoiding eye contact with the grieving man. It was odd, though. He seemed to be grieving Elizabeth more than his late wife, Amber.
In any case... I think it's about time we returned to the first annual Winchester family reunion, isn't it?
Chuck nodded. “I suspected as such, and realized that would be a possibility, going in. That’s perfectly all right— after all, you’ll only have to wait another day or so for the ceremony. We’ll just need to—”
Dean nodded as he made his way around to Baby’s trunk. He opened it and reached for his iron rod, as well as the pair of salt canisters that they
don't get to chastise me over this, all right? I got the saddest, most pathetic end of the stick, here. You sure as hell didn't.
Dean held his breath for another moment. “I just… I have some news. Thought it’d be better to let you know sooner than later.”
Cas was gaping now. He quickly pulled himself together. “You remembered. You remembered our anniversary,” Cas said bluntly.
Castiel balked. He should have seen this coming, sure, but it’s also not what he’d prepared for Dean to say. Although, he wasn’t really sure what he
“Choose a shovel,” Castiel said, staring at the ground that lay just above the casket. “Would you like a brief rundown of the procedure?”
Benny sighed, as if the conversation were exceptionally draining to him. “I know. I wasn’t gonna tell him. Maybe give away a hint, but that was all.”
If you want, and I’m not saying you have to, meet me at my locker after school. I want to talk to you about something.
“Yes,” Castiel said calmly. “I noticed that… that last night I seemed to sleep significantly better in here than in my own room.” He paused. “And I have a headache.”
Dean looked up at Castiel, unsure how long he’d been staring at the carpet. The angel had fallen back on an unreadable expression.
Castiel added, “I promise you, Father, Dean is more than worthy of our trust. His intentions lie in the right place, and after the help he’s given us, I thought it fair to invite him into Hereafter.”
Castiel promptly nodded in his mate’s direction, relieved to see the alpha king’s body loosen. “That’s true. Claire is only looking for a favor. Which, I’ll admit, could be fulfilling for all involved. I’m certainly interested to hear more about it.”
“I already have a mate,” Castiel repeated. Finally, he stepped around, giving the suitor at least a limited view of himself. He crouched and brushed back the collar of his linen shirt, exposing the freshly healed mating bite. Another choked gasp.
“C’mon, Cas,” Jo said with a chuckle, clearly noticing Castiel’s reddening face. “Public displays of affection are absolutely welcome. We just love seeing you two happy together.”
Dean raised both eyebrows. “Wait, seriously? “Okay” as in that was the dumbest idea you’ve ever heard, or “okay” as in “okay”?”
Castiel couldn’t help but feel slightly thrown-off. Sure, most of the time, reactions to him coming out were somewhere from indifferent to positive. Still, knowing his own luck, he was prone to dread the worst.
“Dean!” Cas gasped, albeit weakly. “She’s a dryadic witch. I highly doubt she spends too much time working with… freaky limb-growth magic.”
Cas was already flustered. “Only one. It was a brief relationship, to say the least. I… don’t know how to expand.”
Dean and Castiel go on a date every night that week, although they soon discover their niche; hanging around Dean’s house, watching a movie, exchanging shy nuzzles and cheek kisses.
Thankfully, Chuck seemed blissfully unaware of the venom sheathing Dean’s words. “Interesting, interesting. So, you aided my son and Dame Novak, here?”
Castiel closes his eyes and draws in a deep breath. The thought alone is enough to put him on the verge of an anxiety attack. “No,” he responds simply.
Finally letting his eyes slide closed, Castiel hunched further over his knees, which he’d since gathered against his chest. The wind whistled in his ear, continuing to cut into his bones. He waited for the inevitable, and—
Just ahead, he was able to catch his reflection in the full-body mirror, where it leant against the otherwise bare wall. Despite the dark of the room, Cas was able to make out his paling features, cast over by moonlight.
However, as he prepares to open the door to his house, it flies open from the opposite side. Cas leaps backwards, startled by the sudden movement. He looks down and sighs.
Dean’s face flushed. “Um, yeah, sorta. I wasn’t gonna press too hard for it, but when you suggested that truth or dare idea - well, I kind of just rolled with it.” Dean finished with a vaguely embarrassed smile.
“Hey,” Dean says as they pull into the Roadhouse parking lot. “You’re comfortable around me, right? Because seriously, at this point, that’s what matters most.”
Her. Was Dean not out to his family, or was Sam purely making assumptions based upon Castiel’s new nickname?
Dean was shocked painfully back into reality when he noticed that the man was staring back at him. He didn’t look happy. (Granted, he didn’t look angry either. Or upset. Or anything, really.)
“Oh. Will that be… a problem, then?” As much as it hurt to consider, Castiel was willing to prioritize Dean’s comfort over his own unfounded desires. The alpha demon had never asked for this position; if it
. He shot upward, rubbing his eyes furiously. Just another dream. Another dream about what wasn’t and what could never be. He and Dean had been stuck in the “friends with benefits” loop for what seemed like years. Even then, it had only been a couple of months.
hello! i spent a couple of days editing this chapter, just to make it less confusing. still, i think it's a bit... jumbled? if you have any questions or need me to clarify anything, just ask! also, the reason Bobby read Dean so much lore as a child is coming up in the next chapter, hopefully.
Mary laughed, causing Dean to look at Castiel’s face. His features were surprisingly gentle, and Dean began to wonder if he could hear both sides of the conversation.
Bobby didn’t say a word. Instead, he opted to stare directly at Dean, wide-eyed. Dean would have actually prefered it if he spoke.
. He promised that he wouldn’t let you get into that l- life. Why the hell did I believe him? You never showed an interest in becoming a hunter a- as a kid, I would have never thought..."
Dean sits alone, slumped over a DUSTY TOME. Surrounded by OLD BOOKS, all dead-ends. A mug or two. Empty beers, one in progress. Focused, but rumpled, exhausted-- he's been at this for a while.
As Dean passed by, he caught sight of a girl. Seemingly unconscious, and lying just inside an alley.
He fumbled to his feet. Castiel watched specks of snow accumulate on his tunic, juxtaposed with the rich green fabric. Which, was further offset by his muted surroundings, and all swallowed by the dark. To think, he’d always loved snow. Castiel’s father hated the stuff, so maybe the stance had more to do with his top-secret contrarian leanings, but he’d always been soothed by wintertime. The irony that it might play such a powerful role in his own death— and indirectly at the hands of his father, no less.
Thankfully, Dean’s expression quickly softened. “That all? So, like, you’re a guy who’s trans? Okay. Not a problem.”
Alfred smiled slightly, before returning to his frown. He reached into the collar of his shirt, extracting a large gold pendant.
**i know nothing about how a phone GPS works, and i think the app costs money? also i'm not sure if it speaks aloud to you?? i apologize for any inaccuracies!**
Ellen - owner of the Roadhouse and Winchester family friend - pops up from behind the counter suddenly, her Dean Senses clearly functioning at maximum capacity. “Hey boys,” she says slowly, eyes flitting between the two teens. “This a friend of yours, Dean?”
, even. Not to be melodramatic or anything, but it’s not like we have any clue of the severity we’re facing, here.”
Cas relaxes and moves on with his day. He doesn’t see Dean in the hallways or in calculus, so he feels safe in his assumption.
Castiel wasn’t sure how he’d managed it, but Dean seemed to visibly loosen, all the while the anxiety in his scent grew even more overbearing.
The drive wasn’t particularly difficult. Castiel gave clear directions, and they’d reached their destination within twenty minutes.
Oh, Amara and I had a good conversation about it, don't worry. It wasn't a hasty choice. I trust her with the responsibility, and I encourage you all to do the same. Her heart and her vision for the universe... they're in the right place. Our philosophies are very similar, in fact.
Castiel’s eyelids sprang open. Dean was still so close to him - and he was grinning. Even wider than before, in fact. Castiel’s heart would have sprung out of his chest at that point if there wasn’t one thought hanging over him:
It really did, though— somehow, the flavor was morphing between acrid and utterly tasteless, as it all turned to a tacky paste on his tongue.
Jimmy sighed. This time, they stood in his own room, keeping only a slight distance from each other. Castiel was fully aware that he was in Jimmy’s face, but he couldn’t be bothered to care.
Heaving a sigh and forcefully brushing away all thoughts pertaining to his ex-boyfriend, Cas finishes getting ready for school in a hurry. He ends up sitting on the curb for twenty minutes, waiting for the bus.
“Jimmy!” Castiel managed to croak. He sounded pathetic. This was humiliating. “If you couldn’t tell, I’m not exactly cheerful right now.”
Castiel offered a small smile. “Okay. If you’re sure that it won’t be a severe issue. I’ll see you tomorrow morning, Dean.”
Castiel didn’t know for how long he had spaced out. Mary was gone, and Dean was staring at him. He was silent for another moment. “Yes, I am,” Castiel said finally.
“Hm? Really? Well, I’ll go with it. What was your partner wondering?” Dean couldn’t help but pick up on the hint of suspicion in Mary’s voice.
He knelt above a man draped in silky ruffles and ill-fitting leather breeches, the demon’s gloved fists pinning the guy down by his shoulders. The trespasser’s wrists were twisted inward, roped together behind his back using a torn curtain. His feet were also subdued, many thanks to Benny, Dean’s friend and head of the estate’s security patrol.
started the “nonsense,” although the silence put a strain on each member. Again, something the Hereafterian King seemed to overlook, despite the visible grimaces.
A sword with a gem-crusted hilt was discarded nearby, strewn several feet from the squirming pile of men. It glimmered half-heartedly in the daylight. The weapon was surrounded by thin shards of glass, forming a broken and jagged halo on the floor.
“I mean it,” Castiel asserted, hopping out of bed. He made his way closer to his friend. “You really should go. I honestly believe that you would benefit from the program, and that does not mean that you aren’t already a fantastic straight ally.”
“Until the end?” Castiel muttered. “What happened at the end?” He could feel his heart beginning to hammer in his chest. Was Dean angry with him? If something had gone wrong, surely Castiel would be the first person Dean would blame.
“Just do it,” another boy says between gasps. “C’mon. It’ll be freakin’ hilarious. Seriously, just a week or two. Then everyone will know it was just a joke.”
Castiel was about to offer his rebuttal, until he fully processed Dean’s words. He froze, the air in the room suddenly growing much colder. “Dean,” Castiel said, speaking slowly. “What do you mean by ‘another’ hunter?”
The remainder of the drive to Alfred was near silent, aside from Castiel providing directions here and there.
“What?” Castiel said. If Dean was struggling this much to confess what he had said, it must have been an unbelievably intimate secret. After all, they had known each other for half of their lives. Most personal information flowed freely between them. “Actually, you don’t have to tell me, if it makes you uncomfortable.”
“Yeah, whatever, you’re lucky I can’t hunt on my own yet. Anyway, the girl I exorcised. We still need to go back and get her. I’ll-”
Dean nodded, smiling faintly. “Yeah. That sounds good.” He hesitated. “Hey, actually, there was somethin’ else I needed to talk to you about. Sorta my partner’s request.”
Dean sighed. “Dude, of course. Trust me. You’re my best friend - nothing awkward about sharing a bed. Seriously, though, c’mon. I have class early tomorrow morning.”
“Hey, Cas,” Dean started. “It may sound weird that I’m saying this because of fuckin’ burgers, but hear me out. You are seriously the best friend I could have ever asked for. Honestly, I don’t even feel like I deserve you sometimes.”
Cas lets out a frustrated sigh. “Okay. I suppose you can sit in, Lucifer. But this conversation is directed at Gabriel.”
Barreling down the hall, his normally slick hair in disarray, was Gabriel. Castiel lit up, although he’d been hoping to introduce Dean and Claire once Chuck was no longer present. Oh, well. A two-step introduction it was going to have to be, then.
Castiel gestured to the edge of his mattress, the bed still neatly made. Likely untouched since his departure. “Sit, or pull out a seat. It’s a bit convoluted, but I’ll try to explain, as best I can.”
Dean smirked. “Yeah, um, the uncle I told you about earlier. He’s sorta the reason I got into all of this. Used to tell me stories as a kid. Insisted they were fictional, but I knew they were real. Or, at least, the creatures inside of ‘em were. I think… I think he used to be a hunter. Retired, I guess.” He shrugged.
As the group neared the castle’s property, Dean suggested that he hang behind. For the sake of the ruse, he argued. He would simply barrel in later; the blazing cannonball, aimed right at the last leg of Chuck’s plans.
“The ‘beauty’ is doing just fine, although he thanks you for your concern. Kind of. Well, given your clear selfish intent, maybe not. On second thought, the ‘beauty’ revokes his thanks.”
With pure abandon, Cas lets go of the past two months. He lets go of the quiet suffering and loneliness.
A single, tablecloth-deficient table sat against the back wall, holding the same wines that were most negatively received at Chuck’s last party.
An all-over calm has begun to settle in-- oh, how the pace has changed. Hell, life itself has changed. Unfamiliar, but brighter than ever. And it sure shows...
The house checked out. Every nook was surveyed. Dean even tried provoking Elizabeth’s ghost shortly into the inspection.
“The chances are… difficult to say,” Castiel said. “There very well may be a relic of some sort anchoring the spirit to the house.”
Despite this complication, Castiel was certain that he could still celebrate his anniversary to Dean without the other man even knowing.
Castiel could hear the wobble in Dean’s breath. He didn’t step any closer. “No. No, that’s definitely not the problem.”
Cas sighed. “I spilled hot coffee on myself. And, essentially, it just slid off my skin, without leaving any kind of burn, or causing me any pain. Only, that happened— wait, shit. That part happened before you even dropped off the moss.”
! And we could even repurpose the Bunker-- turn it into a sort of hunting home base. Maybe even provide lodging, if anyone needs it. Seriously, there's more than enough extra space.
So, clearly, there was a lot that was surprising about the next alpha’s visit to the estate. For one, she actually
As they stepped out of the Impala, Castiel spoke. “It may be safe for us to split up this time. It all get the job done quicker.”
The knocking came to a halt. A moment of silence passed before the door started to budge open. After what was likely an eon, Dean could see Castiel fully on the opposite side.
Castiel plucked a blade of grass near where he was seated. “You’re good at math,” he said. “Statistics can’t be that terrible. You-”
Castiel nodded. “So why are you here, Dean? You don’t seem to intend to drink.” He paused. “And the bartender knew your name. I assume you’re a regular?”
Dean continued to grin. “Winchester. And I’m dual majoring in chemical engineering and molecular engineering. You?”
Castiel was true to his word. He reached into the pocket of his trenchcoat, pulling out a small box of matches. Dean watched intentively as he lit one, paused for a moment, and threw the object into the casket.
Dean nodded. “Uh, yeah.” He turned to Alfred. “It was… nice talking to you, man.” Dean didn’t know if “nice” was the most appropriate word. “Fucking confusing” may have been more accurate.
scent wasn’t any better. Still, that might’ve just been due to the constant reminder that Chuck had somehow sired an omega son— an outcome which seemed to fluctuate between a ‘whoopsie’ and a tragedy, depending on the company Chuck was pandering to. In any case, the king wasn’t particularly adept at handling the consequences of his own failures. His
“Probably ‘bout time I introduce myself, properly, huh?” Dean hummed. “Y’know, I’m pretty glad you’re a dumbass who just lets random strangers into his home so easily.”
were followed by booted footsteps. There was some more hesitation, and then, at last, the door was nudged open.
“I can’t do this,” Castiel all but whispered. “I can’t pretend that you love me. Because I love you, Dean. I have loved you for so long, and I’ve always dreamt of this, but I don’t want to experience it if I know that it will fade as quickly as it began.”
Probably his most sincere claim since entering the castle of royally shitty childhoods. He was eager to see how Gabriel handled the introductions— the
Dean offers a wide smile in return. “Morning, Cas,” he starts. “Hey, I was just startin’ breakfast.”
“And here you were, probably all this time, thinkin’ I didn’t love you. Just because I was too much of an ass to say anything. Damn it,” Dean said. He pulled his hand away from his face to show that there were, in fact, tears forming in his eyes.
Dean chuckled, reaching out to begin petting the omega’s forearm. Huh, Castiel hadn’t even realized how tense he’d gone. “That’s coming soon, darlin’. I was killed in battle— well, I
As Dean proceeds to ground himself, Castiel heads forward. He chooses one of the old booths for them. Dean sits across from his date a moment later, forcing a smile.
“Hey, Bobby.” Dean tried to sound casual. Relaxed. In part because he didn’t want to worry his surrogate uncle, but also in part because he wanted to prove the other man wrong. He
But noticing Castiel’s hesitation, Gabriel softened, smiling. He moved onto a new tactic: genuine concern. A last resort, if there ever was one. “Hey, listen. It’s gonna be getting cold tonight, all right? I don’t want Dad’s dickwad behavior to force you into getting yourself sick. I get if you’re not ready to talk about it, but moping out here ain’t gonna make it any better.”
Dean began to laugh, turning his neck so that his face was pressed into the pillow. He quickly looked back at Castiel.
Just as Castiel was preparing to retreat to his room, there was a knock at the door. His heart stilled.
Facing him is none other than Dean Winchester, football player of some sort (Castiel wasn’t particularly involved in school sports) and, in Castiel’s opinion, most gorgeous man he had ever laid eyes on.
Kaia snickered. “I am, I guess. Although you make it sound far more interesting than it really is.” She nuzzled up closer to Claire, and the alpha nuzzled back. “I want to help you guys. Well, if I can. Whatever you need.”
To Dean’s surprise, Ellen doesn’t seem the least bit phased. “Nice to meet you, Castiel. Name’s Ellen.” Ellen says with a wide grin, hands on her hips.
Wildly enough, Dean made time for his mate. Time to talk, even if their conversation devolved into bickering about lunch plans, or the low self-worth they both seemed to hold. Truly, Dean wasn’t a man who deserved to exist in self-hatred, for god’s sake. Castiel, however… it could be justified.
smell is just phenomenal. I have felt that way since the beginning, and my stance hasn’t changed since.”
It had been difficult for Dean to leave his family. His mother, father, and Sammy. The kid was finishing up his undergraduate at Stanford now, and Dean swore he woke up every day beaming with pride.
Cas weaves around the front of the car and leaps into the passenger seat. He is grinning excitedly; in that moment, Cas can feel every bit of resistance he has had toward his sudden feelings for Dean crumbling down.
Castiel crossed his arms, brow furrowed. “Thanksgiving is next week, Dean. So will have to stage our breakup before then?” He didn’t mean to sound so compliant with the situation. Castiel just had trouble refusing to help Dean out of his ridiculous misunderstandings.
Are you just... okay with that? I mean, maybe Jack could restore it, if you wanted. I'm sure he wouldn't mind helping out.
AMBER (late 20s, thrift store chic) approaches FROM THE BACKEND. She cradles several PAPERBACK BOOKS, all similar covers: two Fabio protégés with sultry stares. The title
Upon getting a look at the young alpha, however, Dean froze. He stood across the room, eyes narrowed. Castiel turned back to Claire, finding her to be staring, eyes blown, right at the Infernal King. Clearly, she’d worked out what was happening.
While Castiel could tell that Dean was trying to blanket him in soothing pheromones, they were as subdued as his scent, and all but useless to quell the omega’s hurt.
Castiel nodded, barely reining in his smile. “I do. You see, I have good reason to want to… see my father. I would love the opportunity to witness, first-hand, the outcome of his poorly conceived scheme. The moment he realizes what he’s done. I would truly enjoy seeing the man suffer that humiliation, even if just for a moment.” He hesitated. “And I would like to see my brother, Gabriel. I want him to know that I’m all right, and that he’s free to visit the Infernal estate. If he’d like.”
Cas was making burgers; Dean’s favourite. Definitely not romantic, but the plan at that moment was to do something that would make Dean happy. Cas wanted to express his feelings for Dean, but without Dean knowing. He felt that he was going about the right path.
like that, far as I can tell. Still have a few boxes to sort through, though. Wait... maybe I shouldn't, in case this is a kinda... Schrödinger's Book situation.
“How about this. If you tell me who you like, I’ll tell you who I like.” Dean hadn’t meant to say it. Unfortunately, he’d been taken over by the unrelenting drive to know who Castiel prefered over him.
“Step to the side of the road, Cas,” Dean said. He didn’t know why he was speaking to the man as if he were a child.
Castiel groaned. “You’re embarrassing yourself, and you’re embarrassing me. So, please consider just… stopping. You’re not needed.”
“Listen,” Dean said after letting go of a loud sigh. “I’ll do my best to clean up this mess. I fuckin’ promise. I swear on it. I just need a some time to plan things out, run ‘em by you, and the road is clear.”
Dean shrugged as he made his way back the Impala. Castiel followed close behind. Like, really close. Did the guy know anything about personal space?
“His name’s Sam,” Dean started. “I call him Sammy, though. Kid hates it. Anyway, I gave him the rundown. Told him about the vamp. That I was on a hunt.”
“Please don’t do anything drastic,” Castiel was quick to add in. “It’s really not worth exacerbating the situation. It really isn’t.”
Next thing he knew, he was on the living room couch, heaving. Jimmy was positioned beside him, a firm hand on his brother’s upper back. Jimmy was talking. Castiel wasn’t processing.
Either way, if it weren’t for the haphazard arrangement of candles atop the vanity, there was no way he’d have been able to see a thing. Was it even daytime? Shit, how long had he even slept for?
Castiel hummed, before bending down, pulling a gold ring and a jewel-lined bracelet from Chuck. He held them out to the slouching priest. “Here. This should do, I hope.”
Soon enough, they were routinely bantering with one another. See: Dean teasing Castiel about his sometimes obsessive-compulsive habits, despite ensuring that the omega’s dietary quirks were catered to. No questions asked— but maybe an eye-roll or two, as tax.
how risky that sort of shit is?” He was pacing. “Do you even know how many people are after witches for the sheer fact that they’re
Castiel offered to get a spare blanket and pillow from the front desk. While he was gone, Dean quickly changed into a pair of grey sweatpants and a Led Zeppelin t-shirt. He emerged from the bathroom just as Castiel was stepping through the door.
The kiss is quick and chaste, but it seems to get the point across; Dean is beaming again. But just to be sure: “Yes,” Castiel says quietly, almost inaudibly. “I would love to be your boyfriend, Dean.”
After finalizing logistics, they’d ended up camped out on a ratty antique sofa. It was one of a pair, along with a stocky table and a piano sheathed in dust.
If Jack didn't feel that this was possible, he wouldn't have orchestrated it. Despite all my worry... I have to keep believing that much to be true. And I
Oh, and it's so good to see you again, Kaia! I'm happy that you've been doing so well. You deserve to be happy, to be loved.
His brother Gabe had been on top of him the moment he caught Cas attempting to sneak out the doorway. "What's up, little bro?" Gabe had said, swooning slightly. "Finally got yourself a big gay date?"
In the kitchen, the strong whiff of dessert took over the space. Dean grinned, making his way toward the oven. He paused. Before gathering the cookies, he decided to sneak a peek out the window. A blizzard had hit the night before, and Dean was grateful that all but Sam and Jess lived within an easy travel distance. Granted, the couple had arrived two days prior.
The fading traces of daylight framed Dean from behind, the tousled tips of his hair glowing like a field of candlelight. Pair that with his corpse-worthy dark circles, and there you had it: the duality of Winchester. The very essences of life and death, all bundled up into the appearance of one man. One man who sure as hell hadn’t been prioritizing sleep, lately.
Despite the obscurity of the cloak, Castiel could see the man stiffen beneath his head-to-toe covering. “I’m your room and board for the indefinite future, it looks like. I mean, that’s kinda what I was told the whole ‘plan’ was, and I don’t exactly see where else you’re gonna be going, at this point.”
By the time Cas had reached the narrow archway dividing the kitchen from their living space, Dean was rifling enthusiastically through the refrigerator. “Okay, so I know you don’t have much of an appetite, but do you got any preference?” he asked, stealing a glance toward Cas, before returning his attention to the fridge.
“He didn’t know she was in a relationship? Did he at least apologize?” Castiel asked. He didn’t want to admit to his brother how lost he was. Of course, he understood why Jimmy was angry. Furious, even. What he didn’t understand was how Jimmy expected to remedy the situation in any way other than moving past it.
“Dean,” Mary said after she’d cooled down. Her voice was shaking. “Bobby didn’t need to tell me anything.”
Castiel felt bust open, yet it was… oddly refreshing? He was suddenly free to patter on about his bouts of hopelessness or anxiety, thanks to his father and the upbringing that had entailed.
Dean joined in. He found himself glancing over to Castiel every now and again. This all looked so effortless for him. As if he wasn’t exerting a drop of energy.
Naturally, Dean decided to continue pushing away the fact that he was starting to buy all of Castiel’s “angel” crap. Bobby couldn’t possibly have known everything, right? If he didn’t know what Castiel was, who’s to say he
“It doesn’t matter, nevermind. Hey, Summer suggested this bar that’d apparently be a good place for us to hang out for a while. You up for that?” Dean asked, cocking an eyebrow.
Cas pulls back for a moment to nod. However, a second later, he has wrapped his arms around Dean, face resting in the crook of Dean’s neck. “I’ve missed you, Dean,” he mutters against Deans skin.
“Yeah,” Dean says with a wide grin - genuine. “It did. A lot. But dude, listen. I get it if you don’t trust me enough to be in a relationship with me. I’m not tryna pressure you into anything. I just wanted you to know that I love you too, and I probably always will. If that helps any.”
The room, however, was filled when a mixture of coos and more clapping. Castiel could even hear Bobby chuckling from the back of the room.
It would be a lie to claim that he didn’t remember most of the previous evening— because he absolutely did. No matter how dreamlike the memories felt as he sifted through them, Castiel knew where he now was
Shoveling a final mound of pecan pie into his mouth, Castiel nudged Dean to recapture his attention. Pie or no pie, the man had really been staring off into the invisible abyss, his expression vacant. Haunted. “Can I ask you a strange question?”
“Speaking of,” Mary said, turning to her left. “Ellen, I think the pies are about ready. Would you like to help with that?”
Sometimes Castiel didn’t understand why he was so pliable to Charlie’s schemes, no matter how wildly far outside of his comfort zone they were.
“C’mon, Sammy, you gotta say something. Anything. Hell, call me out as a raging lunatic, I don’t care,” Dean said.
Castiel was able to pick up on the slight charring in the alpha’s scent. He was… nervous. Which the omega understood, since Dean
The stream of sunlight hit Cas’s closed eyelids, visible even before his other senses joined him in the waking realm. Morning rays flickered across his face— if anything, their caress felt strangely tangible. Cas could feel the heat carefully needling against his cheeks, never penetrating the skin. Instead, warmth clung to him like a strategically loose layer of Cling Wrap. Sticky, almost.
Dean giggled, flashing a thumbs up to the shorter exit guard. “We wanna see it get you, though, so we’ve got ways to speed up the process. Got an even brawnier magic user on our side. Hey, Kaia, I think we’re about good to go.”
“Yeah, I’d imagine,” Dean said. “I mean, it’s hard to tell people that I’m bi. So I’d imagine being trans wouldn’t be any different. Or, I mean, it’d be different, but like… also hard.”
Rowena gave a delicate nod, loose curls bobbing with the movement. She straightened herself, leaning just slightly away, and Cas felt the concrete seeping from his own limbs. Wait, when had he gotten so tense?
While Dean had been all but scentless the night prior, that was no longer the case— well, just barely. His scent was clearly subdued, but it was striking, nonetheless. Smokey, spicy, and possibly even…
Castiel chuckled, overtaken by warmth, despite the threat of bodily harm. “I’m very glad to see you, too, Gabe. I missed you.” The omega’s grin widened, as he turned to gesture toward Claire and Dean. “Oh, and let me give you the
was laughable— Castiel’s union had been thoroughly consummated during Dean’s rut. Of course, it wasn’t a lie to imply he’d never slept with Claire. But if his father wanted to believe that Castiel was still a pure and innocent thing, then the omega had no intention of lifting that veil.
"Yeah, whatever. I know the deal. Mom's ghost just killed that Amber bitch. The stars were in alignment, that day."
At the uproar, Dean was quick to jerk upright, brow furrowed. Castiel was certain he had a similar look twisting up his own face, briefly holding eye contact with the demon king. Until Dean stood, turning away.
Dean attempts to brush it off. “It’s just easier than ‘Castiel’ all the time, okay? Nothing else has changed, okay? I date the kid for a week, we break up, everything’s over.”
As Dean’s estate was typically commotion-free, the audible ruckus was quick to snatch Castiel’s attention. A sharp clatter, followed up by shouting, topped off with a shrill overlayer of banging and clacking.
“Hey,” Dean said, features growing progressively more concerned. “You don’t need to tell me anything if you don’t want to, okay? No pressure.”
Castiel was met with laughter. “A straight guy who’s into dudes? Listen, I’d be lying if I said I didn’t prefer chicks. ‘Cause I do. Doesn’t mean I’m totally straight.”
Stationed at the bridge, we watch the Impala fade into the distance, taking with it the music-- leaving behind the sound of the water, of nature. We linger, bask in the calm, until, one last time, we--
“It’s called the Roadhouse. I don’t know, just seems like your type of place. I could give you directions, if you’d like,” Summer said.
Hey, and for once, I agree to those terms. Still should probably figure out where the hell we are, first.
"Okay," Alfred said after a fair deal of silence. "Tell me what happened. Is Elizabeth's ghost gone?"
No one "celebrating the big win" drinks themselves unconscious, alone, on the kitchen floor-- two nights in a row.
took initiative over his own well-being. Cas would, instead, steal a page from Dean’s playbook: Never ask for help, no matter how desperately you need it.
Cas smiles back, chuckling slightly. “Are you sure this isn’t… too early in our relationship for us to feel this way?”
Yet, for whatever reason, there was a knock at his bedroom door. A quick, incessant, and almost frantic knocking. Dean began to sit up in bed as he managed to croak, “What?”
Gabriel’s expression skyrockets. “Woah, bro, you broke up with the guy over a month ago.  Like, right before after you bothered to tell me you were dating. As if I didn’t already know. What the hell happened?”
Dean smiled. “Thanks, Mom. I’ll take that into consideration. I guess… I guess that’s all I needed to tell you.”
Dean lead them out the door. Castiel was right. It was dark. Still, he decided that walking along a nearly deserted road wouldn’t pose too much danger, in terms of traffic. Hell, Dean wouldn’t even mind if they were jumped. He was still riled up and very willing to punch something.
Soon enough, Castiel had begun to shovel his driveway. Dean couldn’t read his expression. Still, he had the feeling it wasn’t pleased. Poor guy’s flight must have been cancelled. Then again, maybe his family came to terms with what a gigantic asshat their relative was and uninvited him.
“Anyway, I’ve been looking forward to meeting you two.” Castiel smiled, ever so devious. “And we could always use more attendees of our
Charlie nodded. “That was one big announcement you gave there, Dean,” she said. Her mouth hung open for a moment. “Oh. Sorry. I probably shouldn’t have said that.”
After trailing the sound of rhythmic thudding and thumping, Castiel stood outside one of the many doorways.
“Not at all,” Cas says, attempting to steady his shaking voice. “I… I enjoyed them enormously, Dean. Is it possible for you to continue?”
“Then why take me on as a partner? Since you obviously weren’t planning on telling me about whatever sort of
“Do you need just the address, or would you like me to give you a map? I have a map.” Castiel was gazing at Dean with large, blue eyes.
Dean lolled his head back and sighed contently. “Jesus, I am so glad I got that out.” He looked back at Castiel. “I remember when you came out to me. What were we, fourteen? You seemed pretty damn confident, I still remember. Beat me in that category.”
Okay, now Dean went from mildly on-edge to appearing visibly uncomfortable. Not a positive first step. “What? I’m not sure I’m following, sweetheart. Are you saying that you’re in some kind of danger? ‘Cause if you are, you’re gonna need to elaborate so that I can help. And don’t say I can’t help, because I’ll find a way.”
Reaching his locker, Cas opens it expecting a note. He doesn’t know if he has the heart to read it, but all the same, he finds himself bending down to pick up a scrap of notebook paper at the base of his locker.
So he headed around to the back of the car, pulling his keys from his pocket and unlocking the rear.
As a direct result, Cas and his siblings were kicked out of the house and sent to live with their verbally (and sometimes physically) abusive mother. This arrangement lasted until Cas was fourteen. That was when Gabriel, then eighteen, and Cas decided to move out on their own. Not only had he lost contact with his dad against his will, Cas knew now that his mother would never speak to him again.
We're not here to take any damn donation that's handed to us. Y'all know this garbage ain't sellable, right? Harlequin trash, that's what it is.
“Shit,” he muttered. “We probably gotta find some place with maps. Cas uses maps. Then again, the guy probably is pretty old.”
Castiel blushed, instantly beginning to regret his suggestion. He was about to apologize when he felt a weight fall over his shoulder.
. The cloaked man swung himself from his steed, taking a step toward Castiel. Castiel, in his own right, had hardly moved since the other’s arrival. “I’m gonna take you back, get you warmed up, then we’ll sort out the shitshow from there. ‘Cause I sure as hell ain’t gonna leave you here to die.”
Dean stared at the girl, wide-eyed, while Alfred only huffed. "You'll have to excuse Cassidy," he said. "She was never able to accept my remarriage after her mother's passing."
Castiel hesitated. “I suppose so, yes. I still need to find a motel in the area, so I suppose that that would be a good place to ask around.”
Claire yanked her girlfriend inside, throwing the door shut. While the young alpha clung to Kaia, Gabriel cut in, “Uh, mind explaining who
“Hey, uh— shit, no, let me start that again. Your Majesty, my name is Claire Novak, knight of Dreamwälk. As I’m sure your mate will inform you, I don’t mean any harm. To either of you, seriously.”
The inside of the witches’ specialty shop wasn’t too much unlike a run-of-the-mill small town bookstore, down to the effortless quirks of its layout. Mismatched shelves lined much of the back wall, creating a rich smattering of varying hues and grain around the secondhand spines. The air smelt faintly of chemical cinnamon, hardly able to overcome the musk of the place. Still, the witchy touches were anything but hidden; a line of tables ran down the center of the shop, covered in plastic-wrapped bundles of herbs, jars of unidentifiable glowing substances, and trendy rose gold altars. Wait, was that… an eyeball?
“No, Dean, it’s okay. You didn’t scare me. I’m just worried and confused as hell. But I’m sure we’ll figure this out. We always do.”
Cas is beyond flustered, his hands shaking. Without notice, he sits up. Dean peers over at him, throwing his boyfriend a look of confusion. Cas stares blankly ahead.
“Dude, dude,” Dean says with a deep chuckle. “Life is more than school. You’re allowed to enjoy more than what you can fit on your goddamn schedule.”
Nodding, Castiel wore a bitter smirk. “That would be correct. More correct than you could ever have imagined, believe me.”
That, or maybe his survival instincts were even worse off than he’d realized. Huh, well, that was certainly something to think about.
Castiel sighed. “No, that’s not what I mean. I just think that the information they provide is important, to say the least,” he said.
He stood in silence for a moment. Then another moment. Another. Dean huffed a sigh, about to return to his car for a bit, when the motel door opened.
“But I could see the reluctance in Sir Campbell,” Claire cut in. “I could tell that he wasn’t thrilled to be cleaning up the Infernal King’s messes, over and over again. So, I took sympathy on that, and we formed an alliance.”
Castiel’s frown deepened, although he soon nodded. “You’re… you’re probably right. I’ll admit, I’m starting to get a bit hungry.”
The redheaded woman stood there, dirt covering her right right side. Her arms were crossed, and she appeared to avoid looking into the hunters’ eyes.
Dean drove in silence for thirty minutes, growing progressively more frustrated that he couldn’t play his music. Maybe he should have asked for the map.
Brows nearly embedded into her hairline, Charlie spoke slowly. Understandable, since Cas was beginning to act more like a spooked animal by the second. “Cas. You know good and well that that’s not normal, nor is it okay. At least, if you didn’t intend for it to happen,” she said. “And, yeah, I highly doubt my fucking
“Have you thought for a second how the kid’s gonna feel?” Dean says, a hint of coldness in his voice.

Chuckling, the omega nodded. He stepped closer to the scene. “Oh, but of course. You’re too late. I already have a mate.”
to be spendin’ the holidays in Cali, and I go and see him shoveling snow. Like, just a minute ago. I dunno. I just kinda assumed his flight was cancelled, considering the storm. Makes sense, right? So, I thought, why not just invite him over here? Maybe he’ll quit acting like a dick all of the time.”
“Hey, man,” he said as he approached Castiel. As per usual, he couldn’t quite read the man’s features. “Sorry I took so long. Wasn’t much traffic, but I sorta had to call my brother at one point.”
Dean has never cried for anyone but Sammy, until this moment. He doesn’t think Cas sees, but he wouldn’t care if he did.
“Cas,” Jimmy said. He gave the other boy another light clap on the back. “I really, honest to god believe that you can do this.”
"Al's in the den," the woman said. "Oh, and I'm Coraline, by the way. In case you wanted to put a name to the face."
Cas exits English class forty-six minutes later, heaving his backpack over a single shoulder. He begins to trace his way back into hall, until he feels a tap on his shoulder.
“So, what? You’re some kinda hyper-advanced, rogue demon? Or are you something else? Just… what the hell are you? ‘Cause I’m sorry man, but I gotta know if I should be hunting you right now.”
Dean moves quickly toward the locker room exit, attempting to go as unnoticed as possible. Which he succeeds in quite fairly, until he passes through the doorway.
Dean looked to his feet, chuckling. “It’s already been that long, huh? Looks like it’s all made its way to the ground, now.”
Castiel chuckled, although the sound was hardened around its edges. “Oh, believe me, I agree. Do you really think I’m here on my own volition? You found me half frozen to death in the woods, for god’s sake.”
A very powerful toddler, who cares deeply for your brother, and wouldn't just send him on a doomed rescue mission.
Pushing back her hood, Kaia beamed. Clearly, she was getting a kick out of her girlfriend, who had gone from hysterical laughter to pure heart-eyes. “Great. So, just let me…” Kaia trailed off, eyes falling shut. A flick of her wrist later, and—
Expecting to be led elsewhere, Cas begins to take a step forward. Instead, he finds himself nearly tumbling over.“Hey, Sammy! Got someone here for you to meet,” Dean yells up the staircase.
Clark grabs another paperback, SWINGS it-- WHACK! The STACK OF HARDCOVER BOOKS COLLAPSES, smothering all of
So, it's like I said. You got Eileen. But I lost Cas. I'm damn thrilled for you, but I didn't get so lucky.
Mary took a moment, and Dean could hear sniveling in the background. She sighed. “Yes, Dean, I am more than familiar with hunting.”
“Yep. I mean, what if he rejects you? Wasn’t he totally straight before he asked you out? I’m not necessarily saying he may have gotten over you, because I doubt that, but what if he’s back to chicks? Like, exclusively.”
“Uh, yeah. I’m pulled over. Actually, I should probably get going again. Don’t wanna leave Cas waiting on me.”
Meg rolls are eyes and puts on another smirk. “Well, anyway, I have some fun news for you then. Assuming Dean hasn’t already gotten that stick out of his ass and fessed up yet.”
Hey, think you guys are ready to head back? Pretty sure we're due for a celebration, of some kind. We've had enough wins to warrant it...
Turning to the pair of guards at the side entrance, Dean added, “Now, you guys are gonna let us leave, and you aren’t gonna try pulling any shit, got it? ‘Cause if you do, I ain’t holding back. Consider if all this is really worth your life, all right?”
It took Dean a while to fall to sleep that night. In part due to his generous nap, but mainly the result of his conversations with Bobby and Mary.
“Before I get to that,” Dean said slowly. “I gotta tell you something else. Uh, give you some background.”
Shit. If she was the only demon to have followed Dean, that meant Castiel had been bombarded by three.
how relieved I am that you at least used your real first name? Like, technically, it might’ve not been the
Castiel huffed, yet drifted closer to Dean. “There’s so much wrong,” he said in an undertone. Barely audible to his friend’s ears.
Cas closes his eyes, cheeks flushed red. He quickly recovers, listening to Dean's soft laughter. "Thank you, Dean. But I will never be as beautiful as you. You are... perfect, inside and out. You are so beautiful, Dean."
Castiel shook his head. “It may sound slightly… unbelievable at first. I just want you to understand; everything I’m about to tell you is entirely true, and that I would never lie to you. Also, before I begin, I should probably ensure you that I’m perfectly healthy and am not losing my mind,” he said. He couldn’t tell if he was speaking too quickly, but judging by Dean’s response, he had been perfectly clear.
Dean groaned, turning his gaze back to the ceiling. “I wasn’t lookin’ forward to this conversion, trust me. It’s just…” he trailed off, biting his lip so hard he was surprised he didn’t break skin.
Sorry, kid-- guess I'm gonna be disrupting the primordial entities of the universe, one more damn time.
I suppose you should have read your own fine print, then. Are you so petty as to contain a human in the Empty? Against your own interest?
He would slip it into everyday conversation. “Yeah, I mean, I’m pretty excited for graduation. You know what would make it even better? If Dean tripped on-stage. That would be hilarious.”
Summer quickly provided Dean with simple directions. As she was doing so, a certain pimpmobile pulled up behind them.
“I…” Castiel begins, eyes locked exclusively on Gabriel. “I believe that I am still in love with Dean Winchester.”
“Hey, Cas,” Dean called out after he’d relaxed, returning his physical attention back to the lightly thrashing man. “You kinda forgot to tell him the best part.”
Unless Castiel wanted to submit to the latter, he’d have to find shelter, no matter how temporary. He had to get up and

been expecting the alpha to tell him. That he’d left a scrap of food in the bed, and it had since been colonized by construction-savvy spiders on their way to raising a new civilization, maybe?
“Nah, you have the right to know this kinda personal shit about me. Just don’t wanna overwhelm you, is all,” Dean said, batting a hand around, dismissive. Castiel frowned. “So, speaking of Sammy… the kid got sick. Years back, at this point. Hell, back then, he kinda
This is it. He’s going to be honest with Cas. If anything, Cas deserves basic honesty. If Cas deserves the world - which he totally does - he deserves this, at the very least.
sick, then,” Cas said, dropping his hardly-touched burger as if it had personally slighted him. “I can hardly taste. God, this is awful.”
“Hey, Charlie, can I ask you a question? It’s going to sound… borderline nonsensical, but I swear, there’s a good reason.”
Castiel shook his head. “No, I…” He paused, letting out a shaky sigh. Why the hell did he feel like he needed to do this? “Considering that, um, you want to see me again… there’s something I should probably tell you.”
Cas stops dancing. Dean’s features turn from gentle to panicked in an instant. “Cas? I’m sorry, man, was that too soon, or-”
Castiel perked up. He paused, before rubbing his eyes. There were fresh tears staining his cheeks. He turned toward his brother.
“Your uncle,” Castiel muttered. “He being a retired hunter, do you think that he will be happy with this? I don’t want to strain your relationship with your family.”
“Okay then,” Mary said. Dean was floored by the calmness of her voice. “What is he? Vampire, werewolf?”
Dean prepared for the car to pass. Whoever was driving had a different idea in mind. To Dean’s surprise and suspicion the car came to a stall beside him and Castiel. Dean recognized the car as a 2002 Volvo S80.
Castiel’s eye flick open. “Yes,” he responds plainly, unsure what else to say. Was this really Dean talking to him? Castiel knew himself as a good judge of character, and he wasn’t prepared to be wrong.
Castiel nodded. “Exactly. With the promise of freedom and some gentle revenge against the Infernal King, Sir Campbell led me to Claire. We convened, before escaping.”
“Um, you’re brother actually came over to my house yesterday. He sorta told me something important.”
“Cas? Cas, what’s wrong? C’mon, talk to me.” Castiel could hear Dean following him, which only worked to increase his heart rate. He reached the foyer, standing still for a moment as tears streaked his face. He couldn’t do this anymore. He couldn’t live this fantasy, knowing that it would vanish the moment he left the Winchester’s home. He couldn’t-
“Sorry,” Dean replied. “I can turn it down. You don’t need to be such an ass.” The last part had been spoken under his breath, although it was not meant to be spoken at all. Dean winced at his own inadvertent choice of words.
But Dean opted to continue, rather than wait for his mate to voice his confusion. Since, clearly, there was confusion. “Look, I… I’m not exactly the traditional kinda demon. I was… actually born human.”
was going to be the one to kill him for neglecting his health and safety, if he ever found out. Assuming the curse didn’t get creative and take care of that first, of course.)
The drive to the Roadhouse is short and sweet, although Dean still manages to make time for conversation. He learns that Castiel is the youngest of six siblings, and that his favourite subject is Human Geography. Of course, Dean can’t help but throw in some more subtle flirtations.
Before Castiel was able to make any sort of response, Dean surged forward, pressing his lips to Castiel’s own. He snaked his arms around the other boy’s waist, pulling him in closer.
Castiel’s gaze was still sweeping the room when Dean leaned in close, causing a shiver to creep down the shorter man’s spine.
“No,” Dean said. “If I went out there and told a group of goddamn strangers, you can bet I’m going to tell my best friend.”
A sigh. “So, uh, think you can stand on your own? C’mon, I’m just trying to play along and save your life, here. Would really appreciate some cooperation.”
He remembered riding back to the Infernal King’s estate, which was all but shrouded by a tangle of branches and ivy. He remembered burrowing his face in heavy wool, nearly lulled to sleep by the gallop of Dean’s stead. He remembered the bite of the cold air, the weakness in his limbs, the almost jarring warmth of the king’s home. He remembered Dean’s firm grip on his shoulders as Castiel was guided inside.
Castiel shrugged. “There is no harm in trying. I do not have anyone else to support me. Maybe your mother… maybe she’ll understand that I can protect you. That without me, you will only be at greater risk of-”
Castiel and Dean managed to squeeze in beside Jo and Charlie. As if the physical closeness wasn’t enough to give Castiel heart palpitations, the questions were almost too much to handle. Thankfully, Dean took the reigns.
“I’m pretty freakin’ sure you could get away from me before I got a jab at you. Is that some kinda angel mojo too? Is that why you were so dead-set on taking my car? ‘Cause I’m starting to bet you don’t use one.”
been. Turns out, the Mark had some kinda fucked up fail-safes against that sorta thing. Brought me back to life, only… not as a human. Guess it read the room and thought
As Rowena spoke and Charlie shifted her hand to clutch at the meat of Cas’s bicep, the front door to the shop was nudged open.
Sam and Eileen stroll down a dirt path, Miracle taking the lead. An air of peace, leisure-- a jarringly NORMAL scene.
Meg begins to glance around the halls leisurely, most likely processing what Dean has just said. She turns to face Dean again after a beat of silence.
Much like the room Castiel had been given as a disconcerting form of shelter, the other areas were remarkable in how… not grand they were. Certainly, the halls weren’t dripping with shameless displays of wealth and—
“I’m certain she does, Claire. I wouldn’t worry,” Castiel said, letting his features briefly soften.
“Huh. I didn’t mention Sammy? Fuckin’ hell. Must’ve been more sidetracked than I’d realized.” Dean shrugged. “Well, anyway, he and his mate are gonna be coming around sometime soon, probably. At least, according to his last letter. Couldn’t give me an actual date, though.”
Bobby shook his head. “You’re trying to test me, aren’t you, boy? How long have you had this ‘supply’?”
. But, seeing as he would be staying in those lands for the indefinite future, he decided he’d best take in the basics. He’d rather not be ‘that guy,’ flubbing simple customs out of a self-imposed ignorance.
Castiel was sitting on his passably comfortable mattress, cross-legged. He was staring straight ahead, until Dean said his name.
Castiel looked up just enough to see his older brother pouting, eyes blown wide for a theatric touch.
, we knew you weren’t just going to be using your real name.” Sam paused, sighed for dramatic flair. “We kept it vague at first, no names at all, but the guard wasn’t having it. We gave him a first name and hoped for the best. Figured, worst case scenario, he’d have no idea what the hell we were on about, and we’d have to leave.”
It was a process. And, not even a process Castiel had ever expected to undergo. He almost wanted to thank King Chuck for treating him to this, if only to see the look of unbridled horror on his father’s face.
“I just don’t want to hurt Cas,” Dean says softly, fully prepared for the blow he knows he’s about to receive.
The second floor wasn’t any more eventful. The homey theme was a constant, however. Still, Dean couldn’t help but feel like the baby blue walls were closing in on him.
Castiel’s gaze flew upwards. Dean was staring at him from across the table, an amused grin on his face.
if word gets to Kaia too soon, though. Although, knowin’ me, she might actually assume I’d pull a stunt like this. Plus, like, she’s gotta know by now that I’m not exactly open to mating anyone else. At least, I hope she knows.”
Only after a nervous chuckle, Dean took a few more steps toward Castiel before steadily closing the gap between them. He cupped Castiel’s face, feeling the other man’s arms weave around his waist.
Cas lingers at his locker after school. He had fallen asleep in his last period class, and a slight drowsiness still hangs over him. He notices with a heavy sigh that his hands are shaking as he shovels textbooks into his backpack. He shutters as his thoughts float back to Dean.
One moment was all it took, apparently. A moment of weakness, and now, Castiel was waking up deep in the woods of the Infernal highlands, dirt caked on his palms, dignity blanched and shattered.
Dean sighed and pulled out his phone. Just as he was about to press the “emergency” button, a tight grip wrapped around his throat. Dean gasped as he looked down to see the girl, smiling wickedly now. Before Dean could say anything (not that he could speak, anyway), he found himself pressed up against a brick wall. Fuck, the girl was strong.
Dean chuckled. “My burgers that good? Anyway, I was thinking about tomorrow. We get there just before dinner, saves us some socializing. Not that I don’t wanna spend time with Sammy and Mom, I just thought it would be easier on you if we didn’t have to keep our act up for too long. Sound like a plan?”
plastered all over his bare forearms. His peripheral was packed full of overgrown weeds, flicking against the light warble of the wind… and he trembled in tandem.
Dean pulled away further. “Shit, I’m sorry,” he said. “I shouldn’t have done that. Fuck. Sorry, Cas. I’ll try to learn some boundaries.” Dean had on a half smile, although it was devoid of any sort of enthusiasm.
A man sat beside him. Dean had gotten a brief glimpse at the guy on his way over to the bar. That glimpse hadn’t exactly given Dean the most accurate gauge on the man’s appearance.
Summer appeared to be asleep on the floor. Castiel, however, sat cross-legged on the far bed. His eyes were closed.
By the time Castiel was sitting down perpendicular to his father, his brother was slouching against the open doorway. Gabriel threw a final look of concern over his shoulder, which Castiel matched with a tight smile. He had no doubt that he’d later find his brother firmly stationed on the other side, no matter how long their father dragged out the “conversation” for.
Summer looked over to Dean. “Really? I thought I was going to have to give you some sort of lecture.”
It was their one year anniversary, and Dean was at work. Cas was in the kitchen. He wanted to make their anniversary special, but he also knew that he had to be subtle about it. Dean didn’t consider this a legitimate marriage. This wasn’t a legitimate marriage, technically, whether Cas wanted it to be one or not.
“If you want, sure,” Dean responds, the same smile still plastered to his face. It alone is beginning to wreck Castiel.
“Great. Wonderful. And, hey, I ain’t any happier about this situation than you are. Still, torturing and slaughtering? Yeah, not really my go-to stress relievers… anymore.” Dean paused. “So, uh, lucky you, I guess.”
Dean winced. “Probably not gonna work out. Can’t imagine that confrontation being anything short of… loud, I guess.”
“Cas,” Dean said. “You’re not gonna sleep on the floor. C’mere.” He adjusted himself so that he was sitting on the far side of his bed. Dean patted the open space beside him, smiling up at his friend.
Mary’s cell in hand, Dean and Castiel found themselves stationed in the kitchen less than a minute later.
I don't know, man. I get a sense Claire was using the term "gay" sort of generously. Pretty sure you qualify.
Following their meal, both men found themselves traveling over to the couch. However, Dean didn’t turn on the television.
Castiel turns to his locker, giving him a moment to get any physical signs of exhilaration under control. He pulls out a notebook, ripping out a blank page. Castiel turns back around to see Dean holding out a pen.
“You were the one who convinced me to apply,” Castiel said, speaking slowly. “I never wanted to. You couldn’t have honestly expected me to go through with it.”
The air in his room was beginning to feel especially dry, as were the inner surfaces of his mouth. He let out a tempered groan, grinding the heels of his palms into his eye sockets. If he really was coming down with a cold, and
Fully healed, as far as I can tell. It was only a shallow cut, anyway. It didn't take much to... get it all out.
“Okay,” Dean says softly, smoothing his voice over. “Okay. I’ll do that for you, Cas. As long as you need.”
Dean scrubbed harshly at his eyes. “Fuck. Well, like I said before, I ain’t gonna be the one responsible for your death by the elements. So, I guess you’re gonna be staying here. Still don’t know how comfortable I am just handing off a
“Hey, it’s okay.” Dean says, picking up the menu set in front of him. Despite knowing it from heart. “She died when I was a little kid. I mean, I still miss her, but I’ve kinda just come to accept it. Y’know, that whole stages of grief shit? I guess I’ve reached the end.”
They reached the motel quickly. Maybe it just felt quickly to Dean. Talking to Summer had been a weight off of his shoulders.
felt charged by a self-made, self-contained inferno. “Oh, and we’ll deliver your weapon back to your home castle. It’s best that you leave without it.”
Dean couldn’t help but experience a moment of sympathy for Castiel. He was that desperate to stay with Dean. The poor guy just didn’t want to be alone.
Leaning against the wall just outside the locker room is a girl, a look of uncontainable boredom plastered across her round face. Deep auburn hair falls in waves past her shoulders. She glances off to her side as Dean exits, a half smile suddenly softening her features.
Dark, unruly hair meshed with tanned skin. He wore a heavy tan trenchcoat, which Dean was sure didn’t do his body any justice. His eyes - shit, his eyes. They were a deep blue. They-
This time, however, he reached a hand upward to cup Castiel’s cheek. Castiel froze immediately. Dean stroked Castiel once with his thumb. His expression, however, showed something between nervousness and careful determination.
Dean snorted, making his way over to sit beside the other boy. “Dude, didn’t you take that test this morning? Can’t you wait until tomorrow?”
Dean pursed his lips before responding. “Honestly? I just like the environment. Can’t drink tonight, don’t have a designated driver. I wanted to play some pool maybe, but my uncle’s still pissed from the last time I gambled. And yeah, I’m pretty regular here.”
Not long after Castiel began to feel thin rivulets of blood streaming down his neck, it was over. Dean released his jaw carefully, although he was otherwise quick to pull away. He blinked, hissing softly. “Shit. That looks bad, I should—”
Dean sat back down as Castiel rose. “I will be right back,” he said, trailing out of the kitchen. He was balancing the open locket on his palm.
That didn’t only mean survival, however; it meant earning his freedom. It meant escaping the hell he’d been conditioned to see as ‘normal’— as inevitable. Castiel most certainly was
At that, Castiel nearly had to hold back a smile. He should have seen his boyfriend’s reaction coming. Before Dean even knew the circumstances, he was ready to pounce into action if it meant protecting someone he loved.
Dean wondered if there was a nest that Castiel still needed to take care of. Maybe it had been a rogue vampire.
Given the nature of the event, Castiel was unsurprised by how gaudy and decor-encrusted the banquet hall had ended up. The curtains had been swapped out for, what looked remarkably like, gigantic silken moth wings. And Chuck’s personal florist must have been on holiday— while there were flowers spread everywhere, potted and free-roaming, there was clearly no sense to the arrangement. It turned out, all the youngest prince was worth was a floral scrapyard.
ahead of us, Dean-- lives that we actually have a say in. And yet, here you are, drowning in a pit of despair... and cheap booze.
“Yes, I’m afraid so. I’m sorry. I wish I could be there.” Castiel’s end went silent for another beat. “Yes, of course. Goodbye, Alfred.”
Dean was holding his hand. Not that Dean hadn't grabbed his hand in the past. It just felt so different, given the context.
He jerked his leg away, happy to have at least gotten a smile out of Gabriel, then continued, “The king was far too reliant on his guards, as he had been with all the previous suitors.”
“Then,” Castiel starts slowly. “My only request is that you leave me alone, and that you refrain from talking to me.”
“I’m gonna have to thank Charlie for this,” Dean said, momentarily glancing down at the forgotten remnants of his milkshake. “Seriously, though. You’re great, Cas. And I would, y’know, definitely want to do this again. If you want to, I mean.”
Sam seemed to be the first to connect the dots. From what Dean had told Castiel of him, that wasn’t a surprise. “Are you a witch?”
Before Dean even had an opportunity to respond, Castiel amended, “On the floor. I can bring in a blanket and pillow. I should be fine.” He smiled weakly, but ran a hand through his already tousled hair. Dean could pick up on Castiel’s nervousness with the lowest level of effort.
Ready to lay his independence in Dean’s waiting hands, unknowing if the alpha would crush it on contact.
! It SHATTERS, shards raining by his feet. Not even a flinch. He RETURNS TO THE FLOOR, quiet, alone. Glass everywhere.
Dean smiles, softer this time. “Just a second,” he whispers, eyes drifting to meet Castiel’s. Dean is honestly surprised that he hasn’t drowned in Cas’s eyes by this point. So freakin’ blue.
Dean nearly found himself relaxing at Castiel’s gentle tone. “Then I guess I’ll have to repeat myself for the goddamn thousandth time: What even
A grin slowly begins to make its way onto Dean’s teammate’s face. “So,” he coos. “You even have a nickname for him now? Didn’t think anyone called him ‘Cas’”
potential means to his demise: Either he’d be slaughtered by a jaded Infernal King, who most certainly
Dean smiled, a hint of excitement in his expression. “Okay, so, how many guys did you go with in high school before you came out to me?”
Castiel had been lightly pestering Dean, scrounging for details on Sam and Eileen’s visit to the estate— but there hadn’t been any more updates. Of course, he’d been eager to meet his mate’s family. After the pair arrived at Dean’s home, maybe they’d bundle up and head out on another picnic, all four of them. This, however…
