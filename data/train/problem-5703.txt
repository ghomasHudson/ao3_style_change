Bucky tried opening his eyes, but he felt his eyelids been glued together, making it nearly impossible for him to wake up.
Everyone was gone. Steve was the only one left in this cruel world. He was all alone. He wanted to cry, but not a single  tear would come out. It was as if a part of him had died in the ice. Steve couldn't feel any type of emotions, ever since he had woken up in this new era 3 months ago. All he felt was an empty hole in his chest; the pain was raw.
Steve stared down at the sleeping figure of the man, he couldn't help but think how perfect the man looked in his arms. Steve walked to the bed and gently placed him on the bed.
The man was absolutely beautiful. Steve couldn't describe him other then the word 'beautiful'. The man had a sharp jaw with an angular cheekbones and a perfectly trimmed beard. The complexion of his skin goes well with his beautiful brown hazel eyes. The man was so handsomely perfect.
°•°•°•°•°•°•°•°•°•°•°•°
He wrapped his arms around him and hugged him. Steve felt so happy. He loved seeing Tony in his arms.
Instead, Steve decided to go out and freshen his mind. He wanted lighten his mood up, so he can then apologize to Tony with a cool headed mind, that way he won't lose control in front Tony again.
Peter noticed that there was something about the way his dad said that. Wait a second, did he care about Tony? One way to find out.
"Oh My God! Steve, you actually are. Wait, are you those people, who do it with the person they love? That's freaking adorable, Steve." Tony gently ruffled Steve's hair.
Tony stood there, not knowing what just happened. Did Steve just walked out of his life for good? No! Tony never wanted that, never. After the break up, he wanted them to be just like before, he wanted his best friend back.
Steve hanged up the call, he clenched his fist.
One cold day, Steve was on his way to his best friend Bucky's house. His head felt heavy, from the slight fever he had. Despite, that Steve walked and walked until he'd bumped into someone. "Ah, I-I'm so sorry." He stuttered.
Tony went near Bucky, he gently patted his cheeks. "Bucky! You're safe now.” Tony reassured him, his voice trembled, as it sounded so broken and weak.
"Well, what I can say. It's my second love after all." Steve admitted, he loves riding his motorcycle.
"By the way, you still haven't told me you're name - Ah wait! I still haven't told you mine, I'm Antonio and yes, I'm half Italian." Antonio said and smiled at him.
while Tony desperately tried to calm him down. It was awful and it was definitely not working.
“Think about it… Cap comes home after being gone for a month. Soon as he arrived they got some food and fucked off to the room like a pair of nymphomaniac rabbits. And then, the next day, Shellhead comes down and he has a dislocated jaw?” Clint looked at them with barely contained glee. “TONY DISLOCATED HIS JAW GIVING CAPTAIN AMERICA HEAD”.
“Congratulations, Tony, Steve”, said Bruce, hugging his ‘science bro’, as Tony had dubbed them.
“There has to be something you can do”.
“I would very much like your opinion on a project I have…”
“I say let’s get the son of a bitch”.
“Well, Mr. Rogers. Let me tell you a little bit about Project Rebirth”.
“Why’s that?”
The song mentioned is called "It's Been a Long Long Time" and it played during CA:TWS and Avengers Endgame! Even though I didn't like that Steve went back in time to be with Peggy, I absolutely loved the song and couldn't resist using it for the fic!
“Mr. Rogers? We’ve been expecting you. Follow me, please”, a woman welcomed him. She took Steve through the corridors to a big room on the back. The room was filled with all sort of technological equipments, with people in white coats walking up and down with clipboards, talking in what Steve could only assume was an alien language.
“I said something stupid, didn’t I?”
Tony had had enough. With tears now streaming down his face, he got up and ran. He heard Steve shouting his name, but he didn’t stop. He was already outside of the cafeteria when he felt a hand stopping him, holding him back.
“You might take a lot more than just one hit”.
“Yesterday, after the meeting, I stayed behind for a while because I lost my pen; you know that one that Rick gave me? It was under the table so I went to get it and Mr. Stane walked in and he didn’t see me there. I was going to show myself, I swear,” she promised in a tone that very much told Natasha that Evelyn had had no intention whatsoever of doing that, “but he was talking on the phone with someone and he sounded really angry”.
“We need to get married. Coulson can say he’s ordained and he can marry us and it will be all fake so it’s no problem and we pretend were married for a few months and then break up”.
Steve took a deep breath and started typing.
“No problem at all. Now, a toast to the soon to be husbands!” Tony replied, smiling and raising his glass.
Tony simply nodded with a sad smile.
Everybody just stared at him.
you”.
Tony snorted. “I’m sorry, didn’t I just watch you put a slice of pizza inside a taco shell and eat it?”
“Trust me, Rogers, marrying you is the last thing on my “to do” list”.
“Look, if you don’t believe me, just rewind the damn thing and I’ll show you”.
Peter took a deep breath and closed his eyes. And then, after a minute, opened them again, throwing his friends a very confused look.
“You mean your hobbit feet?” Steve teased, giving Tony the spoon so he could lick it, which the engineer gladly took.
the man whispered manically, giggling before the line was cut.
“You have a friend named Bucky, you don’t get to judge”, Tony replied, making Steve laugh.
Peggy swore loudly.
of the elevator and smiled at his partner, who exited the elevator.
“MOTHERFUCKER”, he shouted when Natasha finally did it.
“Sam, talk to me”.
Steve’s smile grew even bigger upon reading the message.
“Yes”.
A loud buzzing sound interrupted the conversation. Steve took his phone out of his pocket and cursed loudly.
“It’d help”.
Tony took a deep breath.
“Can you find out where they went?”
As they ate, they talked about pretty much everything and anything: Nat and Bucky’s upcoming wedding, Tony’s new green energy project, politics in general and then, finally, when everybody’s belly was full, the subject finally turned to dessert.
Iron Man, aka billionaire playboy Tony Stark, saved hundreds of lives last night from a terrorist attack perpetrated by Russian terrorist Ivan Vanko. According to sources, military contractor and CEO of Hammer Industries, Justin Hammer, was also involved and is now in the custody of the FBI.
"Are you for real? Wow! Okay, I didn't expect that at all, out of people, it had to Nat's man. But, I guess it just shows that I'm fucking awesome. I mean seriously, even Bucky admires me, WOAH! I'm such an amazing role model. Bucky, I must say, you have a great taste in liking things. I feel very honoured." Tony stated, with a huge smirk on his face. He was clearly showing off his talent.
"Do you have an camera? That way we can record it and later you can use to it practice and the see improvements."
"Hey Pep, gimme a pen quick." Tony asked while getting his hand out.
Steve was welcomed by a gentle breeze with a chilling sensation. As he'd leaned against his red Ferrari, he placed a shisha pen in his mouth. He took a deep drag and exhaled the smoke into the air.
Bucky's eyes widened. How does Tony know him? "How did you know?" He asked.
"Tony! It really is you." Natasha said in cheerful tone and hugged Tony tight.
He wanted make Tony feel comfortable around him, that way they'll be able to communicate and understand with each other more. This would be his first step in becoming good friends with Tony. He wanted to get to know Tony better and be there for him, even as a friend.
Steve ran his fingers through his hair. He stood there spacing out in the middle of the living room. "Wow! Great gob, Steve Rogers. So much for the mission." He muttered to himself with a deep sigh.
A tall dark figure appeared in the room and spoke. "Tony! You should seriously take a break."
"Ah, don't be like that, Tony. I know you're curious." Rhodey said.
Tony sat at the edge of the bed, "Hey! I'm not little-"
Tony looked a little flustered, Steve couldn't help but think how cute Tony looked. His heart was pounding nonstop. Who would've thought, the crown prince shared his first kiss with a boy and that too with Tony Stark.
Steve pointed at the things on the table. "Ma! Are those for me?" He asked with excitement.
"Please, help me!" The man pleaded desperately, gripping into Steve's shirt and burying his head into Steve's shoulder. It was almost as if he was trying to hide himself from something.
Tony's mom Maria screamed in fear, her tears streamed down as she saw her little angel fall. She couldn't bare the sight of her son in that state, this was all too much for her, especially as a mother. Maria began to have an panic attack and lost consciousness.
Steve tried to hide his smile, but he failed. He knew Bucky was going to tease him about Tony. Somehow, Steve didn't mind being teased about Tony, in fact he liked it. "Shut up, Bucky."
Someone special? Tony is more then that. "Well, I can guess you can say that."
Tony, took a quick shower and refreshed himself. He wore sliky bathroom wrobe and headed to the lounge, where Pepper and Rhodey were waiting for him.
After checking up on Steve, king Joseph rushed to the hospital to see Tony's condition. That was the last day he'd seen or heard from the Stark family.
Tony was struggling so much. But Steve didn't care. After a few seconds, He slowly parted his lips away from Tony.
Rhodey was always there for Tony since day one, Tony was lucky to have these special people in his life. The truth was that Tony could never cope without them, he needed them as much they needed him. But Tony doesn't believe that, he always thought he doesn't deserve such loyal friends like them, especially for someone who was so broken. No! He refused to believe that, he could never, he was just too selfish, arrogant, egoistic, cold-hearted person. A person like him could never have people like them in his life and yet somehow, he does.
Steve was madly in love with Tony. Tony was the best thing that ever happened to him. He felt lucky, having to spend his evening with Tony.
After a quick shower, Tony got out. He wore a small towel around his waist and stepped out the bathroom into his bedroom.
"Please tell me you asked for his number" Rhodey asked.
The lady looked so close to tears. Tony's words were really touching and encouraging. She nodded and gave him a smile.
"You too, Boss" He said and drove off. Tony stood there in silence. He's eyes widened in shock. "Did I just ditched my one-night stand for Steve?" He muttered to himself.
Steve gaped at Bucky, his were eyes mainly focused on his lips. Those lips, were the one's Tony's lips was pressed against. His Tony, used a mouth-to-mouth on Bucky to save his life.
Bucky took a deep breath. "That guy was none other Tony Stark." He replied. His tone, as well as his expression were deadly serious.
He groaned in frustration and simply took off his clothes and walked inside the shower.
"Yes, of course, Mr Stark." The doctor replied back.
"NAT! I can't believe you betrayed me!" Bucky growled. His face was beaming red, he was so embarrassed.
It broke Steve's heart to leave him like this, but he couldn't risk the chance of staying and being caught.
Steve hated seeing his mom feeling guilty, it wasn't her fault. She was the best mom, Steve could ever asked for. He was lucky to have her. But, Steve felt a burdened to his mom, he had to be strong for his mom. That way in the future, he could help his mom with everything.
"I've never seen you this happy in a very long time, Stevie" Bucky cut him off.
Steve lost his two childhood best friends. They were everything to him. He didn't know how to cope with this lost.
Steve couldn't breathe properly. It felt like his heart just stopped for a few seconds. He clenched his shirt tight, his chest ached so much. It was almost as if his heart was ripped open from his chest. It hurt so bad, the pain was unbearable.
Everyone left the room, except Natasha Romanoff.
Bucky's eyes widened, jaws dropped to the floor, he froze there. So, all this time those feelings he had was because he was in love with Natasha. Bucky, gulped rapidly, trying to process the information. His heart pounded even faster.
"I'm curious to know him too, so tell us." Rhodey asked him. Both of them were very eager to find out about this Steve guy.
"Well I think it's cute." Tony replied. "Wanna take a guess of what mine and Peppers ship name are?" Tony asked.
Tony slowly got up, hoping he hadn't woken up the man. His lower part was aching in pain, his ass was completely sore. He had to admit the sex was great. Although he was kinda nervous since it was his first time with a man.
Tony slowly moved his hand away from his mouth and glared at his dad.
Steve shut his eyes closed, he was scared. He was going to die, this life had come to an end for him. Steve waited to crash into the floor but he didn't. Someone was holding into him, stopping him from falling.
Steve felt the complete opposite. He sat at the edge of the rooftop, swinging his feet’s back and forth. Steve was lost in his thoughts, he replayed the memories he had with Tony during these past two weeks. He had never felt this happy before.
Just who one earth was the man that took all trouble to do this all for her son.
"Mr Stark" Steve held out his hand.
Nick glared at him. "What happened is the fucking meeting is over, now get out of here."
"Bye, Rogers" Tony said.
Tony hoped whatever Rhodey had said was true, but deep down inside he knew it was just a beautiful lie.
Steve clenched his fist. He was frustrated. But, not at Tony, never. He was angry with himself for losing control and hurting Tony.
Steve still couldn't get rid of the imagine of Tony kissing someone else. His heart ached, every times  he thought of Tony being with someone else, other then him. He fucking hated it, he couldn't stand that thought. He had to make Tony his, sooner or later. Otherwise, Steve was going to regret it and lose Tony forever.
"Ah, fuck sake!" He cursed out loud. He turned around. "Pep, you can't keep doing this to me, my heart is already to weak for this shit" He cried out, while placing one hand on his arc reactor. He took a deep breath to calm down.
Steve approached closer to him. His heart began to pound at the sight of the man sleeping. He looked more younger and so fucking adorable. How can a man look this cute?
" Ah! Mr Stark, I didn't mean to stare. I kinda got lost looking for the bathroom" Steve lied. God, how he sucked at lying, hopefully Tony doesn't caught him. Steve hid his hand behind his back.
The doctor was right, his son was too precious. He would anything to keep his safe. King Joseph sat beside Steve and held his hand.
"Nothing" Natasha quickly replied, before Tony could even answer him.
Before Tony could say anything, Pepper stepped in. "Calm down, James! That's not Tony's blood. He scared me as well" Pepper reasured him, as she lifted Tony's shirt, exposing his skin. He was perfectly fine, no wounds.
Tony moved his hand away from her and stood in front of her. "TONY!" Pepper called.
Tony shook his head and muffled something.
The moment Steve stepped inside the building, there were so many bodyguards, garding him.
Just when Steve started to enjoy his party, it had to end. Now, Tony was going to go home. He wanted Tony stay with him.
However, Steve had to admit the man was stronger then he looked, as he continued to surprise him even more. "Looks like I've underestimated you, Boo."
After a while, the doctor came to Tony. "Mr Stark, the kid lost conscious due to his fever and lack of medications." The doctor explained.
Why was he so happy when he heard about what Natasha said about him to Tony. Bucky couldn't help but smile, he seemed more content.
Three years ago》
He just wanted to comfort Tony and be there for him.
Pepper couldn't even process the things she just heard. She never thought there would be a day, where Tony Stark would compliment a man.
"Today's incident left a deep wound in him that his brain managed to put up a wall from that painful memory, but he'll eventually remember everything when the time comes."
"Ah fuck! Look where-" Tony groaned, fixing his sunglasses.
He stood in front of the windows and stared outside. The city night view was simply beautiful. His mind drifted off to the man.
"Quickly get rid of those soaking wet clothes and take a shower. If you were to catch a cold, I feel like that would be on me." He turned his body and walked out of the bathroom into the bedroom.
The man was startled by the sudden action Steve just pulled. "Eeek! Fuck! Put me down."
Steve took the card and opened it. He saw the most beautiful handwriting by the most beautiful, handsome person. His handwriting was neat and perfect.
Rhodey froze there, he hadn't seen Tony cry like that in a very long time. Rhodey gently patted Tony’s back, trying to calm him. He held him in his arms for a few minutes.
Steve took a deep sigh.
A new side of him must've gotten out from in the ice because right now all he craved was fucking this man hard into the mattress until sunrise. He wanted this man to be his first.
Steve took a step forward. Tony looked agitated, he constantly pressed the elevator button, to close the door. Steve speed walked toward Tony.
Steve weakly smiled at Bucky, not knowing how to respond him at all. But, Bucky already knew the answer to that. He's known Steve when both of them were in diapers, obviously he knows Steve from inside out. "Oh wait, don't tell me you didn't realize
That's all there's to it, Tony didn't kiss Bucky. No! He did not kiss him. But, for some reason, it pained Steve that Bucky was the first to feel Tony's lips against his. When it should've been him and him alone.
Steve felt a hand on his shoulder, he looked and saw Bucky with a devastating look on his face, he must've heard the news as well. "Steve..."
"Your hearts beats mad fast, when you're with Nat, innit?" Tony asked randomly.
Without wasting time, Tony dressed up and left the room in a rush. Earlier he had gotten a text from Happy saying that he's already here with the car.
"Well, now that Tony knows, I'm sure both you get along even more. I know you're obsessed with the guns he designs. But, please do control that mouth of yours. Otherwise, we'll be hearing Tony speaking in another genius language, which we can't even to begin to comprehend. " Natasha stated with a deadpan expression. "Trust me, I've been there."
The sky cried, that night. The lightning contrasted with the darkness of the night. The sudden booming noise of the thunder was in synced with Steve's heart beat, like it wanted to escape from his chest. The heavy rain poured down, it was as if someone was pouring a bucket full of water on them.
He slowly moved his body away from the bed and turned around to leave the room. He needed to make a call to ask his guards to send someone with two sets of new clothes. Both of their clothes was drenched and dirty.
The door was wide opened, Steve heard a voice speaking, but it sounded muffled. As Steve got near to the door. "-please Happy, wake up." A familiar voice spoke, the man had a sadness and desperate tone to his voice.
Steve looked at the door, but there was no one there. He tried his best not to look disappointed. Not that he was fooling anyone, especially himself.
Steve's face was beaming red. "Steve you're blushing." Clint reminded him with a big smirk.
"What do you mean by, I'm her man?" Bucky asked in confusion.
With that in mind, Steve got his act together and quickly took a shower. He freshened up and went to Tony.
"I'm Tony fucking Stark, the genius. Obviously, I'd remember the simplest things." Tony replied  with a smug. "By the way, I warned you before and even gave you a chance to reject, but now you're stuck with two Starks. Let's just hope that my dad doesn't bore you too much." Tony stated.
"I'm so sorry Tony, for not being here sooner." Rhodey apologized. He felt guilty. He hated seeing Tony in this state, Tony didn't deserve to go through this alone.
Just when Steve was about to call by Tony's name, Steve witnessed something he wished hadn't.
Steve rushed getting up, but he was to clumsy and fallen back down, thankfully he placed down his hand first. Steve was on top of Tony, their faces were only an inches apart. Both of them stared into each others eyes without saying a word.
He glanced at them for a few seconds. The moment his eyes laid on the guy, he immediately knew who it was from afar. Steve stood there frozen. He felt a sharp pain in his heart, it was as if someone had ripped his heart open.
"Tony, how many times do I have to say it," The guy groaned. Tony chuckled and squished his face against the man's face.
"Good evening, Tony's man? You can't blame me, for thinking that, after all you guys look like a couple." Howard stated with a smirk.
Steve had seen this beautiful smile, when he'd first met Tony months ago. He could remember that night so vividly in his mind. It was one of those exquisite memories, which Steve could never forget.
Tony moaning his name, sounded so perfect on that mouth of his. For some reasons it had turned him on. Steve slide another finger inside him without any struggle. Tony seems to had open up for him.
"I've hired you a bodyguard-"
Bucky heard that loud and clear. He observed the guy, his forehead indeed was red, that must've hurt a lot. "I'm so-" But before Bucky could even apologize, Natasha abruptly cut him off.
Tony thought.
Wait, having to want Tony; means that I also like men? No! I don't give a fuck about that. The only man I like in that way, is Tony and soley him.
Bucky chuckled "Hmmh! I didn't realize you get along with Stark this well." He replied. "How comes you didn't tell me, that you knew Tony stark?" Bucky asked.
"Ahg! Steve!" Tony screamed his name, lifting his hip up and biting Steve by the junction of his neck and shoulder.
Steve was so tempted to go there and pull Tony into a tight hug. He wanted to tell him that it was going to be okay. Steve felt breathless, it was almost as if he had forgotten how to breathe properly.
Immediately, Bucky blushed, his face was beaming red.
The place was crowded with people. Steve felt out of place, he always hated parties. But, he had to bear with all this shit and complete the mission.
Steve brought his lips closer to the man's ear and slowly whispered. "Even so, I doubt you'll do me any harm , Boo. I could take you down in a heartbeat." Steve's hands were glued to his waist, not wanting to let go of the man. Well, not just yet. After all, his night had gotten hell of a lot more interesting and he couldn't just let that come to an end, now could he?
Steve let out a deep sigh, there no point in asking J.A.R.V.I.S. Tony had obviously programmed the A.I not to tell Steve about his whereabouts. Not that he blames Tony for that.
When the Captain finally opened his eyes, Tony was sitting right beside him, focused on his tablet, updating his boyfriend’s uniform while softly complaining about Steve’s refusal to
“Are you sure about this, Tony?”
“It’s not weird at all”, Steve said, smiling down at him, “This was your life, before, your whole childhood. It’s normal to feel like that, because all of this is familiar”.
“That’s great”.
in a urgent tone. At first, he ignored her, murmuring a
“They are your Master, then?” the god inquires with a raised eyebrow and a disbelieving look.
“So it’s settled. Go change. We’re stealing you a man tonight”.
The others quickly agreed.
“I’m sorry. I should have told you. It’s just that… After you kissed me and you told me we should grab a burger, I thought, okay, I’ll tell him the truth at the diner and… I didn’t. Because that day I had the best time of my life. You were funny, and smart, and gorgeous, and damn it, Tony, I was terrified that if I told you, you wouldn’t want to see me ever again. So I didn’t. And I should have. I’m sorry”.
It was a disaster. There was no other way to put it. Bucky and Sam had been, well, not helpful at all. First, they had laughed at Steve and called him a ‘dumb blond with legs for days’ and then they had insisted that he had to tell Tony how he felt – which was insane, of course. Tony was having a baby! Another man’s baby! He had a lot on his plate already, Steve couldn’t possibly just go over to his apartment and say ‘hey, by the way? Totally in love with you over here, would sure like to kiss you and bed you, 10/10 would like to be your baby’s other daddy, so how about it?’ Yeah, no, it was absolute insanity. All he needed to do was to keep his mouth shut and try not to look like a lovesick puppy every time Tony so much as took a step.
Bucky got up, a very noticeable stain of oil on his ass. “Look, I can’t make you call him, but… just think about it before you make any decisions, okay? Also, I promise we’ll behave from now on”.
“We have a long way to go for that to happen, Rogers”, he said, stepping back and buttoning his suit. He walked to the door and stopped there, without looking back, “Sign the papers so we can get started on that”, and left the room.
“That was flirting?”, she asked incredulous.
HAVE I DONE SOMETHING WRONG? IS IT NOT CUSTOMARY TO CONGRATULATE A FRIEND WHEN THEY ARE TO BE WED?
“That’s the cutest thing I’ve ever heard. Shit, how am I supposed to compete with that?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Uncle Buck is in the naughty list, Pete, he can’t get any presents”, Rhodey said with a smirk.
, he saw Tony say with sad eyes inside his own mind,
“No, not really. I had to do it”.
Sometimes, during his downward spiral, he had brief moments of lucidity when his brain would actually function properly.
“Did you hear what he said as well?” Steve inquired, crossing his arms, “He basically said she spared them because they didn’t know. Didn’t know what?”
“Now we wait”, the secretary replied, sitting on one of the chair nearby, feeling older than he ever had before, “now we wait, doctor”.
He unbuckled his seatbelt and got up, eyes still focused on Tony. He barely heard Bucky’s indignant
“I meant just for Steve”, he complained.
“I know. Sam chewed me out for that. So did Coulson. They want to apologize to you as well, by the way. They were pretty pissed at me after what happened”.
“WHO THE HELL ELSE COULD IT BE? I’M A FUCKING DRAGON, MAN!”
A moment of silence, and then, “Let me put you on hold”.
“No”.
“Where’s Tony?”
“What troubles you, wizard Strange?”, Cassie inquired in a firm voice.
, he thought to himself, turning his attention back to Stane,
, he had said in a firm tone,
“He’s not my boyfriend, Buck. Yet”.
shoot first.
“We’re ready, Captain”, Tony said as the faceplate came down on his face, “Need a lift?”
“I was, actually, but it looks like I was stood up”, he joked right back.
“That actually makes a lot of sense, Vision”.
“Then good luck to you when you tell him it was
can continue to make business”.
“It was gas, okay? It was just gas! I made you bring me to the hospital because of farts!” he exclaimed, his cheeks reddening from the utter embarrassment.
“Holy shit”, Sam whispered with wide eyes.
They were at Steve’s apartment. It was his birthday. All of his friends were there. Sam, Bucky, Natasha, Clint, Thor. He’d invited some of Tony’s friends as well, like Bruce, Rhodey and Pepper. They had beer, vodka, pizza and a huge cake with “Happy Birthday, Dumbass” written in icing, courtesy of Bucky. It was all good, until Natasha came over and started talking.
(See the end of the chapter for
He laughed, shaking his head, “Nice doing business with you as well, Ms. Potts”.
“My dear boy”, Jarvis said with a smile, “He chose you every time he came over to watch, yet again, those silly space movies you love so much. He chose you every time he comforted you after a fight with your father. He chose you when he introduced you to his mother, his only family in this world, as his boyfriend. He chose you when he gave up a scholarship at another school only because he could not bear to be parted from you”.
he told Steve another time, when they were watching a movie,
Tony’s anger was cold and silent. It was calculating. It was
“Uh, it’s Tony. Mind if I come up?”
“You did what now?”
“So, I was thinking… Since Steve liked to coconut one so much and you liked the strawberry one better, we should have two cakes! So there’s no need to fight anymore, I already ordered them both!”
Both agents walked inside her office and sat down in front of her. The Director, however, remained standing, walking from one side of the room to the other, hands clasped behind her back as she did so.
Steve went rigid as soon as the melodic voice entered his ears. He turned slowly, gulping, and forced a smile.
“I know it’s too much to ask and you’ve already stayed here pretty much the whole day, but will you stay with us?” Tony asked in a shy, low tone.
Minutes passed. Tony continued to stare at the photos until he felt Steve’s hand on his shoulder and heard his worried voice.
“I don’t remember the exact words, but it said that, on the event of both of my parent’s deaths, Stane should become my legal guardian”.
“The program is inside this flash drive”, he turned to Natasha, showing her the device, “All you have to do is insert it in a USB port and it will do all the work for you”.
Steve was pretty sure he had broken some kind of record with how fast he took his clothes off in that moment.
“I’ll hold you to it, Natalie”, and with a final exchange of smiles, Evelyn walked away towards the elevators to meet her friends.
, he thought as he knocked on the door.
“I wouldn’t say no to that”.
It took Natasha a good fifteen minutes to land the helicopter near the exploded area. She waited inside as the others fought through the dark smoke, covering their mouths and noses as they walked inside what seemed to be a former war camp. There were bodies everywhere, melted faces and body parts scattered around as if it was some gruesome horror movie. The smell of burned flesh was unbearable.
She came across a room right across what she assumed was Vanko’s bedroom.  Jessica walked inside, flashing light everywhere. There were books scattered around on the floor and pieces of machinery everywhere, including on a big table by the corner that seemed to be a makeshift workshop. She looked around for a while and sighed when she found nothing of interest. It’s not like she was expecting to find some damning evidence right away, but a clue would be appreciated. She checked his bedroom next, where the only weird thing she noticed was the suspicious lack of clothes in the wardrobe; the bathroom, nothing but a few cockroaches and a very unsanitary towel on the floor; the living room, a mess of pizza boxes and Chinese food containers, but absolutely nothing of interest. Her last hope was the basement.
, Sam replied from the other side. Steve quickly put the call on speaker, so everyone could hear,
Immediately, the room got quiet. Pepper and Rhodey, who were both very aware of Steve and Tony’s secret relationship, turned to look at Tony, who looked like someone had just punched him in the stomach.
“I’d never miss our first Christmas”, he whispered on his husband’s lips, earning a content sigh.
“I think he wants you to fix it, Bruce”, Nat explained. Tony nodded enthusiastically.
, he thought, a bit dramatically,
Tony took one look at the cake and wrinkled his nose. Lemon. He wasn’t much of a fan, but he figured that if the king of Wakanda had been thoughtful enough to actually save him a piece of cake, he might as well eat it.
“FROM WHAT?” Steve suddenly shouted, making his friend shrink a little. He took a deep breath to compose himself once more before continuing. “Bucky, what were you trying to protect me from exactly?”
“We could always get a divorce, right?” Bucky asked right before they stopped in front of a very well dressed man, probably Rhodey. Rhodey, who was ordained. Rhodey, who was going to marry them. Bind them forever in the eyes of… Well, everyone.
“I am Strange, the wizard, and I have come seeking your help, young adventurers”.
The team, however, didn’t give up. They invited Steve out for various activities, like going to the movies, or grabbing something to eat, or jogging through Central Park, etc., and talked about Tony.
The agents had the decency to look embarrassed.
“Why didn’t you just ring the doorbell?”
“I’m never late for work”, Steve tried to reason, but completely lost his trail of thought when he felt Tony’s hot mouth on his neck, his tongue slowly going up to his ear just as the mechanic’s hand found his dick under the black boxers.
“Did he… did he just call Margaret Carter a dame?”
“Didn’t you just say something about wrinkled clothes?” Steve whispered in between kisses, his hands holding Tony by the waist.
― HOLD ON
This time, Clint actually seemed concerned. “Hey, everything alright?”
He raised his head and looked blankly at the archer. “Hey”.
“Don’t worry about it. I’m just happy I’m able to make this dream of yours come true!”
“No, it was Natasha, actually. But I’m guessing she got it from Hill, yeah”, Bucky explained, sitting on one of the chairs and putting his feet up on Steve’s desk, which earned him a very pointed, annoyed look, “So, are you going to tell me about this mysterious person you’re sending flowers to?”
“Of course. Tony is not stupid and he’s very observant”, she explained with a smile, “You and Agent Barnes were now supposed to be ‘spies’, Captain. You were supposed to distract my godson from the real spy”, she said, gesturing towards Agent Barton.
“Clint, I told everyone”, she said, unconcerned.
“You’re so funny. No, really, I’m laughing on the inside”, Tony deadpanned right back, going straight for his soon to be husband, “You’re really bad at this, aren’t you?”
. He kicked the older man right in the stomach and then proceeded to punch him repeatedly in the face. Jessica winced. He then put Howard Stark back on his car, closed the door and walked away as if absolutely nothing had happened.
Morgan giggled. She pushed Steve’s hands away and, without his support, promptly fell on her diapered butt, babbling away.
“You leave in fifteen minutes”, Fury suddenly said from behind them with a forceful tone, making everyone but Natasha jump on their chairs, “Get up, gear up, and meet me at Deck 03. Go”.
It was movie night and Tony wasn’t feeling up to it. He was in his workshop, messing around with a
Steve left a kiss on Tony’s neck and stepped back to look him in the eyes.
“What’s my deal?”
In return, Steve told Tony about his mother, her cancer and how he had joined the Army right after her death. He told him about Bucky and the people he had met in Afghanistan: Sam and Nat. He told him about everything he had lived there with them and how they had been giving honorable discharges after a very ugly mission that had taken three of their fellow soldiers and one of Bucky’s arms.
“Pepper?” Steve asked.
“Yesterday, at approximately twelve hundred hours, the Director’s nephew, known as The Mechanic, disappeared nearby the Kunar Province, in Afghanistan”, Coulson explained, marking the spot in the map, ”He was being escorted by American soldiers back to the Bagram Air Base after a missile presentation when his convoy was attacked by members of a group known as the Ten Rings”.
“Yesterday. Mr. Stark, I believe… I believe Stark Industries has something to do with this”.
“Is it a boy or a girl?”
“Gross”, Peter complained, scrunching his nose in disgust.
“I know, I know, I’m sorry”.
He liked to think that he would have handled the situation a lot better if he’d been prepared for it, or at least expecting it. He thought maybe they would give him the shovel talk, the
“So, Steve, I just talked to Sharon. She said she had a great time. Are you taking her out again or what?”
Steve was sitting down on the old couch, looking straight ahead but not really seeing anything. Tony sat beside him, in a very uncharacteristic silence, waiting. The sound of his feet constantly hitting the floor was starting to irritate Steve. After a few seconds, he grabbed Tony’s knee, still looking straight ahead.
Steve raised his head, looking at him once again.
”, Steve commented.
“Dear beloved…”
After that, they would meet regularly. Sometimes, when Steve had a bad day at work or had had a particularly difficult assignment, he would call Tony and they would watch a movie, eat Chinese food and fuck on every available surface in the small apartment. Other times, when Tony was frustrated with some new invention that just wouldn’t work the way he wanted or angry at the fact that every single person in MIT was
at his Tony and
, Tony thought to himself,
“I don’t actually need the wheelchair, by the way”, he complained, pouting, “But they won’t let me walk. It’s bullshit”.
“Let’s hope army regulations are the only laws they’re breaking here”, Natasha said from the front, leading the team into the pathway.
The island looked almost abandoned, which was weird considering it was a still active military base. From their position at the beach, they could see a radio tower far ahead and, on their left, a long staircase with a big building at its end.
“Really?”
The blond nodded in defeat. “Yeah, yeah, he is”.
“I can do it”, Natasha suddenly said, carefully grabbing his jaw and turning it from one side to the other, examining it, “It’s just a bit dislocated. All we need is some muscle relaxants and maybe a local anesthetic so you won’t feel any pain”.
Steve hugged Tony from behind, kissing his neck.
“And now I know! And I had to do something about it! I couldn’t wait, I couldn’t stand here, waiting, watching those people die and be tortured… I couldn’t do nothing now that I know what’s going on”.
“Did it say why? Which warehouse was it?” Natasha asked and the curiosity in her voice seemed to please Evelyn, because she half smiled, all proud of herself.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony closed his eyes, feeling exhausted. Without him even realizing, his mind started to wonder… He pictured a big house, in the middle of nowhere, with a big lake and a tree and a swing… and kids; running around, laughing and playing. Ty chasing after them, his own laughter echoing in Tony’s ears as he caught them and they all fell on the grass. He could see them from the porch, a boy and a girl, cheeks red from all the running. He smiled. It was a nice picture. It felt right somehow. A family, something he’d never had. A family just for him. And he would be a good dad. Goddamn it he would be a wonderful dad. He would go to every recital, every science fair, every soccer game. He would help them with their homework and teach them math and love them like every child deserved to be loved. He’d break the cycle of shame that Howard Stark had started. He was going to be a good father.
Suddenly, something started to move, or, better said, someone.
, he remembered suddenly. The party where everyone was
“I see”, and with that, Thor hugged the smaller man, pulling him even closer as they danced, “I am not good with words of comfort, my friend, but I have been told sometimes an embrace from a loving friend should be enough”.
“It prospers, as it always has. Here, I brought you a piece of cake”.
It took Tony almost two weeks to even resemble a functioning human being again. In that time, he had cried on his bed every single day, unable to hold it in, as either Rhodey or Pepper sat there by his side, stroking his hair while whispering that everything was going to be okay. Tony didn’t believe them. How could anything ever be okay again? Steve had kept him as a dirty little secret no one could ever find out about, cuddling with him at night, whispering “I love you” again and again in his ear, all the while going out with whoever Natasha set him up. It hurt. It hurt so bad Tony honestly didn’t think he could recover from it.
Tony saluted her while Steve nodded and so, both groups set off on their quests to find survivors… and maybe also find out what the fuck was going on in that island.
“I don’t have anything to say to you. You want to discuss business? Talk to my lawyer”, Tony said and moved to close the door on his godfather’s face.
“Makes sense”, Ned replied with a nod, “He is the god of mischief, right?”
didn’t exist anymore. All there was now were the memories that never left him alone. Rhodey and Aunt Peggy always tried talking to him, begging him to open up, and he wanted to, God, how he wanted to. He wanted to tell them everything, he just didn’t know how to do it. How could Tony make them understand that the food tasted like ashes in his mouth? How could he put in words the terror he felt every time he took a shower? How to say that he had to take a million deep breaths, fighting off the tears every time he washed his hair because the water falling on his face felt too much like the times they had shoved his head inside a bucket until he almost drowned? But, most of all, how could he tell his best friend and his godmother that the only thing keeping him alive in that moment was the anger that burned inside his chest? That every dream, every wish, every plan he had ever made had been destroyed the moment he saw Yinsen take his last breath, leaving an empty spot in his very soul that could only be filled by one thing: vengeance. He could never tell them all that.
Steve and Bucky did the same, trying very hard not to cry out of desperation.
“Is it a boy or a girl, sir?” the young woman repeated.
“You file an injunction. But to do that, you need actual prove that this dumb kid is not suitable for the job, that he actually poses a danger to the company, that he could cause irreparable harm to the company. And how do you do
“Not you, American dream. The other Mr. Rogers”.
, she heard Romanov talk to someone on the background for a second,
Everybody was silent. They looked at each other, unmistakable guilt in their eyes.
She blinked deliberately slowly and took a step closer, "Are you implying that I'm lying, Agent Gardner?"
Natasha raised an eyebrow, crossing her arms. “Do I understand what it’s like to look the man you have always loved in the eyes and see no recognition on them? Do I know what is like to be around the man you love and not be able to touch him or kiss him or hug him because he doesn’t remember who you are or what you meant to each other? Yes, Tony, I think I know a little about that”.
Steve slammed his hands on the wheel, shouting some words that would’ve made his ma wash his mouth with soap.
“It’s weird, really. Even though I hate all this, it feels like I’m finally home”.
“Something wrong?”
“I’m on my way, my dear. I’ll be there as soon as possible, you hear me? You stay in your room, alright?”
Throughout the years, the Brooklyn boys had lived many adventures, from the time they had gotten matching SpongeBob tattoos to the time when they woke up in the middle of a cornfield in Kansas, with Bucky wearing a very small Hello Kitty t-shirt that said “Fairy Princess” and Steve wearing, well, nothing but his underwear. How they had ended up in Kansas of all places was still a mystery to this day. So, really, after seeing the boys do so many dumb things over the years, Natasha didn’t think they could ever surprise her anymore. She was obviously wrong.
“I’m sorry, you
“You got the whole place just for us?”
“He may not have chosen you at first, Anthony. But he chose you again and again and again for a year. And he kept on choosing you every time he called this house, heartbroken and desperate, and every time he sent a gift with what I can only assume were very remorseful notes. You made each other happy, Anthony. Perhaps you ought to give the young man a chance to prove his love to you”.
Vice-Principle Coulson had what seemed to be the ghost of a smile on his lips. “No kissing in the corridors”.
He looked down to see Tony’s hand on his crotch and moaned out loud when he started fondling through his jeans.
“I still can’t believe it, you know”, Tony whispered, biting the inside of his cheek while holding his cup of coffee, “No one ever picks me. I’m always the second choice, the ‘can’t have the best, might as well have this’”.
”, he replied, wiggling his eyebrows.
The woman gestured for Steve to sit down and wait. He did so, beside another man who looked to be about his age.
It was almost ten p.m. when Steve called the number Erskine had given him.
“Man, I don’t even have the new Xbox…”
“How I lost it? I was cutting up some carrots and just got a bit carried away”, Bucky said in a deadpan tone, making Steve snort so loud in laughter that the scientists nearby stopped to glare at them.
“You did WHAT?”
. They dated for a year. They kissed, they cuddled. Had Steve been uncomfortable in all this situations? Had Tony forced himself on Steve without knowing he wasn’t welcome?
Steve took his hand, touching Tony’s face slightly, turning it so they could look into each other’s eyes. “It’s okay if you don’t want to tell me, but… I really like you and, if you’d be willing to do this again, then I’d like to know. So I can work on whatever it is”.
“We’re not trying to be assholes here, okay?” Bucky complained, making a face at his best friend, “We’re just saying that this friendship… the way you talk about him, the way you worry about him, the way you’re staring at a picture of his baby… We know you, Stevie. You fancy him!”
Steve snorted, keeping his eyes on the batter he was mixing, “That sounds like bullshit”.
“Are you crying?”
I thought it might be a bit silly that Steve didn't know about same sex marriage being a thing, but then I remembered my friend who only recently found out about that, so... If it's not very believable, just bear with me ;
“Just a stupid headache, it’ll pass, don’t worry”.
“Honestly? I don’t know. I mean, Obie, he… He was nice, Steve. He was always on my side, even called my dad out sometimes when he mistreated me or called me stupid. He was the one who inspired me to create the Jericho. He kept talking about how proud my father would be, how all the soldiers, Rhodey included, would be much safer if we have the bigger stick. Because that was my father’s motto: ‘Peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy’. And I believed that”.
“Distract him?”
“Steve… Listen to me, because if you want this friendship to continue, I need you to understand this… Han Solo
Tony and the team try to make Steve remember.
“It’s true. Even with you guys. I wasn’t your first choice for lab partners, Rhodey, you were stuck with me. And Pepper wanted to do the business class project with Bruce, but ended up with me. And Nat, when coach May paired me with you on PE, you were so angry you literally threw the ball so hard you broke one of the benches”.
No, he had to act fast, he can't lose Tony no matter what.
When Steve had turned fifteen, puberty hit him like a bus. His health improved a lot and his body transformed. He was 6'2". His voice deepened, as it sounded well-modulated.
Both of them filled the car parking lot with laughter. They haven't laughed like since ages.
Steve stared at Tony with confusion. "If you don't mind me, asking you. How exactly do you know her?" He asked.
That moment he laid eyes on Tony, something inside him had awaken. For the first time in his life, he wanted something. He wanted someone. He wanted Tony, Tony Stark.
The boy slightly moved his hand, all this time the boy was awake.
Tony took a deep breath, he didn't want to start an argument with Steve. He wanted to talk this through like grownups adults.
Tony gave him a confused look. "Urm, Steve. What do you think you're doing?" He asked, while getting inside.
Steve felt a gentle pat on his face. "Hey, don't you dare to close your eyes." He heard Tony say that him. But, why was it that Tony sounded so frightened and worried?
Especially those beautiful glacier eyes of his, Steve could've sworn the man's eyes were glowing in the moonlight. He was captivated by those alluring eyes.
Tony noticed how Pepper and Rhodey were in a deep conversation. He walked there and sat on the couch. "So, what are you love birds talking about?" Tony asked.
I have a crush on Tony Stark? Me? That's impossible!  Urg! Why is he in my mind 24/7. It's driving me mad. Steve ruffled his wet hair, in frustration.
"Yes, Cap. It suits you perfectly, don't you think?" Tony asked.
Pepper chuckled. "But, you can't blame us for wanting to know more about Steve."
"Steve, I..." Tony didn't know how to answer that, his mind was blank.
"He's blond isn't he?" Rhodey asked.
Steve quickly waved bye to his mom and walked along side with Tony. They were close to each, Steve heart was getting so excited, pounding faster by each seconds. He just hoped that Tony couldn't hear his heart, otherwise everything will fall apart before it even began.
"Hey, kido! I hope you get well soon. I bought you a little something, to cheer you up.
Steve smiled and nodded, putting his shield on his back and stepping on the engineer’s feet, holding the small hooks that Tony had put in the armor especially for this. He closed his eyes and felt the wind hitting his face. He buried his head on Tony’s neck, hiding it until they finally landed.
“Oh, you mean Bonnie? Yeah, don’t worry, I gave up”.
I skipped some events here and just mentioned them. I thought it would work better with the plot, after all, you have all watched the movies, you know how things happen lol I hope you enjoy the chapter. I'll try to update more frequently!
“Yeah, funny right? We thought they were dating, they thought we were dating…” Bucky explained, with a tilt of his head, “And then Nat and I went to the bathroom, talked about it, almost had sex against a sink and then Pop’s threw us out… What a fun night”.
Bucky quickly put the little girl down and grabbed her hand, “Come on, let’s leave your daddies alone for a minute!”
Everything looked exactly the same, from the furniture to the big vase full of cherry blossoms, his mother’s favorite flower, on the nearby table. He half expected to see his mother coming out of the kitchen, Jarvis right behind her, as they discussed flower arrangements and drinks and canapes for whatever party she was throwing that week. He felt his eyes filling with tears and smiled softly at the memory.
“Maybe in romantic comedies, between a couple. Not something friends do, no”.
“I’d like that one, please”.
“What?”
There were three corridors, each one with a small, silver plaque. The first one, the one right across the elevator, said
They all met at Natasha’s floor as soon as Bucky made the call. Thor was out there somewhere with Dr. Strange, most likely looking for a way to revert Loki’s spell, but Vision and Wanda were back, which was good. They would need all the help they could get.
Tony frowned, looking confused.
“Shhh”, Michele replied, “they’re gonna hear you. So, what are we going to do? You think maybe they’re the evil we’re supposed to end?”
at him, but the rest of his body wouldn’t move. He looked down at his coffee and made a nonchalant sound, trying so very hard to not show his heartbreak.
“JARVIS, I thought I told you the workshop was off limits”.
, the voice said.
“That’s a pretty name! How about you get her a little ballerina?”
“Your voice?” he asked, disbelieving.
“Tony Carbonell”, Steve replied with a suffering sigh, “his name is Tony Carbonell”.
“Oh, no”.
Tony took a long look at him and nodded.
“I did. I’m going to be honest, I thought about ghosting you. Not because of what happened exactly, but because… There’s a lot about me that you don’t know, Steve, a lot that I’m not willing to tell yet. I’m dangerous to be around. People I love tend to be hurt”.
“You know, I am a grown man who can take care of himself”, Steve replied, rolling his eyes.
“Hey you”.
“Into mashed potatoes, yeah, we got it. We’re sorry, okay? We feel bad about it, but we had to do something!”
and looked completely relaxed, stuffing his face.
“Which I had just stolen from Sharon a couple of minutes before the kid showed up”, Tony whispered, looking down at the table, “He wanted Sharon. Not me”.
, the kind that would laugh obnoxiously while talking about their trips to Europe and then discuss the newest scandal involving some politician’s daughter and another clueless millionaire between flutes of expensive champagne. And so, the mechanic was expecting to meet someone like Tiberion, who threw money around in order to show everyone just how rich and powerful he was, or maybe someone like Justin, who monopolized every conversation, always talking about how great he was (spoiler alert, he really wasn’t). He was most certainly not expecting to meet a bunch of very down to Earth people in a karaoke bar, drinking and eating onion rings and, basically, just having fun. They looked so normal, so

“I have time. Start talking”.
“All I’m saying is we shouldn’t jump to conclusions. Something bad might have happen, yes, it’s possible, but it’s also possible that something good came out of it”.
“That reminds me, you might want to throw some rubbing alcohol on that table after it’s done”.
Bucky and Sam exchanged a look, both thinking the exact same thing.
, that Tony didn’t even notice his mask slipping, dropping his guard a little bit more with every word exchanged. And, of course, that had been his doom.
The car had broken down in the middle of an empty street. His cell phone was dead. And there was a storm outside, because
“Until what’s over?” Cap asked once more, but the workers seemed to have grown tired of them. They all slowly sat down again, staring ahead as if in a trance.
“But?”
“Hey, Morgan, it’s… uncle Steve”, he said, catching himself just in time – he’d almost called himself papa, “How about you give your dad a little kick so I don’t have to call him a liar, huh?”
“That’s… nice”, he said, pouring himself some coffee and trying to be as quick as possible because it was one thing to accept that Steve would never want him again and that he would, soon, move on, and another completely different to actually hear the love of his life talking about being with someone else.
“Hey, pet”, Ty greeted him from the bed.
“How’s the company, by the way?”
The shooter didn’t wait for another word. He shot him two more times, right in the head. Tony turned his eyes away, feeling his stomach turn at the sight. Then, he looked back at the shooter, who was now pointing the gun at him.
“Come on, punk, we’re not gonna do that, okay? I promise. Nat and I will be on our best behavior”, he promised, crossing his heart, “So will Sam, Clint and Coulson”, he whispered right after.
And it had worked. It wasn’t ideal, and Tony hated it, but he loved Steve and he was willing to suffer if it meant they could be together. Everything worked fine. Until today.
“Good. I’m glad you like them. So, shall we?” Steve asked, gesturing towards the car. And that’s when Tony immediately stopped, staring at the very expensive, very beautiful car.
“I… I have a bad history with rich people”, Tony replied in a whisper and then laughed bitterly, “I went out with this guy. His name was Tiberius and he was kind of a dick. And it’s not even just him, it’s… Every rich person I know only cares about one thing: money. And you seem like a nice guy, Steve, but so did they and I’m just… not sure what to think about this”.
“What, and watch you make out with Stevie? No thanks, we’ll wait here”, Bucky said pretending to gag.
And then, there was the watch. After he opened the little black box and saw the watch, everything seemed to change. Steve couldn’t understand. Tony loved that watch. And he knew his boyfriend had been really upset when the watch was destroyed in a fight with the Wrecking Crew. He really thought Tony would be happy to have one just like it. Of course, it wasn’t the exact same watch, but it was something, right? Steve had gone through a lot of trouble to get him that gift. Even paid a little fortune ― more than he was ever comfortable spending on anything, to be completely honest ― just to put a smile on his partner’s face. He couldn’t understand why Tony didn’t like it. Better yet, he couldn’t understand why Tony didn’t tell him why he didn’t like it.
“Really? You designed that big ugly tower?” Steve asked, earning a dirty look from Tony.
“I’m afraid I’m in a little bit of a disadvantage”, Tony replied, trying not to look as terrified as he felt in that moment, “because I don’t think I know you”.
“That’s not true, man. Stop talking nonsense”.
“We’ll send Phil with her. Just in case”, Steve added. Natasha nodded in agreement.
Later that night, Bucky and Steve were sitting at a table, watching Tony and Nat laughing in the middle of dance floor.
made it pretty clear that Stark senior had had some involvement with the Vanko family before his death. Years before, if the date on the file was to be believed.
In that moment, Steve went down on one knee, taking a small black box from his jacket and opening it to show a simple, silver ring. The brunette stood there, completely paralyzed, brown eyes staring into blue ones full of love and hope.
“Oh, don’t worry, he’s gonna get it as soon as he leaves the room. How could you all be so irresponsible? Your little plan could’ve killed Steve! Or it could have made his memory loss even worse! Or even turned his brain…”
She sighed yet again, “Look, Mr. Rogers, I understand you’re worried. It’s your first child, isn’t it?”
“Seriously, man, could have just said the flu”.
“Basically, yes. If you’re my husband, I can actually do a lot more for you, legally speaking. But that’s not the only reason”, Tony said, getting up from his chair and walking to where Steve was sitting, standing closer to the man, “Susan also thinks it would help our images. You know, show that the Accords didn’t actually tear the Avengers apart and that we’re all back to normal”.
“Jesus Christ, Barnes, get a bell or something”.
“I see. Well, Mr. Rogers, I believe I may have a solution to your troubles. Tell me, are you afraid of needles?”
It took Steve a moment to remember what he was supposed to say. “Yes, but I always carry an umbrella?”
“From Viastone Corporation?” Clint asked.
heard, but okay...", he whispered, shrugging.
“I don’t fucking care, Stevie, I’m not marrying you. Not sober, anyway”, he added, taking another long sip from his bottle.
“’odamit”, Morgan repeated, stomping her own feet on the ground, laughing.
“Wait. Is JARVIS…”
“Knock knock”, a soft voice came from the door. Steve recognized the voice immediately. He knew he was behaving like a child, ignoring Bucky like that, but he couldn’t help it. He was just too angry to have a proper conversation with his best friend.
“Well, we could pretend that the pressure of the wedding became too much and fight in front of him and then break up”.
"No, it won't. You are being released of your post and I'll be reporting both of you to Hill".
The agent deflated, murmuring something like 'interrogation room 2' just as the elevator stopped at the fourth floor. With one last look at both agents, she stepped outside.
“Sure, ‘cause that worked so well the last time”, Steve replied, shaking his head with a sigh, “Bucky, forget it”.
“Yes. Was the question not clear?”
“So, you… seem to be fine with it”.
Tony huffed with a smile, shaking his head at him, and raised his eyes, looking right into Steve’s blue ones before lowering them to stare at his mouth. He felt him stiff all of a sudden, his breathing getting faster.
The bartender woke him from his daydreams, pushing his drink towards him. Steve picked it up and walked back to where Bruce and Tony were talking. He frowned when he saw Dr. Banner standing there, alone.
“Matt thinks that we have a real chance with the will, sweetheart”, Steve said in a soothing tone, getting up and hugging Tony from behind.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to offend you, Tony. Is this not customary in America?”
Small chapter because I've been kind of busy lately D: But I hope you guys enjoy it!
Bucky shrugged and continued to eat.
“Stevie? Hey, can you hear me, pal?”
“Good?”
“Yeah, but he still didn’t choose me”.
“We met at the VA. Bucky was getting his robotic arm; SI was choosing some candidates for it. He was the only one who actually passed the trials”.
“I’m Doctor Abraham Erskine. I represent the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistic Division”.
Tony stopped for a second, coffee mug still in hand, trying to process what he had just heard. He felt as if he’s insides were slowly freezing, his body going cold and numb.
Bucky shook his head with a smile, “Dude, we go together and I’m gonna flirt with her. I’m gonna throw the full Bucky charm on her”.
“I don’t know. Fury knew him, said the guy was losing his mind. Too much scotch, apparently. If he really was as bad as Fury made him to be, then it’s hard to believe he was the genius behind R&D”, Steve took a deep breath, reading over some papers on his desk, “Okay, I need to read this now. Come back at 3pm if you want to see the weapons for yourself, okay?”
“That’s correct”.
“Yeah, but he wouldn’t shut up about his goddamn new guns at the fundraiser so I told Hill we’d give him a chance. But, to be fair, Stane isn’t much better lately”.
“Yeah, it was”, Steve replied, with a huffed laugh, “But I get it. You spent two years hiding for me, Tony. Two years pretending and trusting that I would get the courage to come out one day, and then you find out I went out with some girl. I get how much that hurt you, because if it was me in your place, and I heard you went out with someone else, I’d be devastated. But I need you to know this. Nothing happened. I swear. We ate, we talked, she went home. We didn’t kiss, we didn’t even hug. I just did it so Natasha would leave me alone, you know”.
Steve blinked, confused. “What?”
“Do you? Do you understand what I’m feeling right now?” Tony replied, angry.
“Name, jackass”.
“I’ve noticed that. I’m guessing we might find something on his computer, but it’s password protected and if I try to hack it, he’ll receive a warning right away. His security system is absolutely amazing”.
“Your father… He destroyed my family. He destroyed us. Stane knew. Stane needed to pay too, but he hated your father and he helped me get revenge. So I spared him, gave him a little while to live. But he needed to pay”.
He looked down – as best as he could – when he felt a hand opening his flyer.
“Mind if I sit?”
“Oh, no, Tony, honey…”
“This will hurt, Mr. Stark. But it is the only way to save your life. I am very sorry”, he whispered softly near Tony’s ear before nodding to someone. Immediately, two strong hands took hold of the engineer’s head from behind, holding him in place. All he could see was the filthy ceiling. His eyes followed the small light bulb going back and forth, as if trying to hypnotize him. And then he felt it. Something sharp and cold and hard cutting through the skin in his chest. He screamed, closing his hands with such force that the nails pierced the palm. The cutting continued, and so did the pain. Tony could feel his heart beating faster than ever in his ears. He felt the sweat coming off his skin, the bile rising in his throat as he so desperately tried to keep it down.
“Tony…” he looked down with a sigh.
like to know why exactly I’m here, though”.
Margaret was already on her feet, telling Fury to secure her a jet right that moment while trying to calm her godson down at the same time.
“You may have, once or twice. Would you like me to stop, love?”
“What on god’s name is happening?”, Ross whispered to himself.
“To be honest, this whole car is all wrong”.
“That’s sick”, Steve complained, shaking his head in disgust.
“Thor never once in all the years we’ve known each other asked me to dance, but he did tonight. T’Challa, who’s always more than proper and knows every single thing there is to know about the etiquette of every single country in this planet, just took a bit of frosting from my lips with his finger and then licked the finger. But none of that was as weird as Maria Hill very loudly telling me that I looked delectable tonight”.
, and gave a warning nod towards Tony, leaving Natasha behind. The little girl with bright red hair stared at him without moving.
“Are you okay?” Steve asked, worried.
Steve laughed, shaking his head, “What about you?”
“Barnes, here’s what’s going to happen: as soon as JARVIS finds a match, you’re going to take that skull away and then you’re going to come back, take that table and burn it. Got it?”
“Well, it’s dead now, isn’t it? Jesus, it’s like you guys missed the frog dissecting lessons”.
“I’m seeing a therapist. She’s helping me with this idea I had in my head, you know. That it’s okay for other people to be who they are, but not for me. I’m getting better”.
“Yeah, I think he’s not cool with that, doc”.
“I don’t know, sir”, the younger man replied, looking at the big screens around them, trying to find the culprit.
But Tony wasn’t listening. He wasn’t thinking. He walked with purpose, completely ignoring Steve’s shouts, pushing men and women out of his way. He found Obadiah outside and, before he knew it, he was grabbing the CEO’s arm and pulling him away from the cameras.
“The bugs won’t work. He has a device on his person at all times, a watch to be precise, that disrupts all signals. It will be impossible to record anything”.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What the hell is happening now, Private?”
. He took a deep breath and was ready to make a run for it when he heard a shot. And that’s when he remembered…
“Tony. I came into this century with nothing. No home, no family, no hope. I was bitter, depressed, angry at everything and everyone. And I didn’t think I would ever fit in here, that this was my punishment: living in a world I fought so hard to save, but never truly being a part of it. I’d accepted my fate like a dying soldier accepts his defeat. Until you.”
Tony pulled Steve by the forearm, causing him to crash on top of him. Thankfully Steve’s reflexes were good, he managed to put support on the bed with both of his hands. Which kept a gap between them.
Tony gasped for air. "I thought I was gonna die" He panted. "Nat, your grip was too hard, next time please go easy on me"
Steve glared at Tony, eyes cold as ice, it was almost as if there was no soul to it. He was really pissed off.
Tony tried pushing Steve away. "Steve, stop!" Tony shouted.
But, instead Steve had to deal with these motherfuckers. They'd wasted his precious time, but don't worry he'd make them pay, oh he certainly will.
"Did Tony see you? How did u manage pass his security" Clint asked.
VROOM!!
The silence in the room was loud.
Natasha scoffed. "Oh please! Tony doesn't have time to deal with an annoying kid."
They both headed out of hospital and went near the car. Just before, Tony got inside his car. He saw a gift store on the opposite side of the street.
Tony stared at Pepper blankly, without saying anything.
Tony's eyes met with cold blue eyes that pierced through him. The man placed his hand against the wall, blocking Tony from escaping. "S-steve, what the fuck do you think you're doing?" Tony asked, with annoyance to his voice.
"Honeybear, what are you talking about? Of course, we all have to die, that's the whole point of life" Tony commented.
Steve took off his clothes and stepped into the shower. The warm water dripped down his hair, to his body and down to his perfect abs that he had.
"Please forgive me, Steven. I promise when the day you finally remember, I won't ever come in between you and Anthony. I know how much he means to you." King Joseph gently caressed Steve's hair and gave him a peck on his forehead.
"Ahh! You feel so good inside, Boo." Steve moved his hips back and forth, his balls smashing against Tony's ass with every thrust.
Thank dear lord! Steve was really light. Tony took a deep breath and pulled harder, this time he succeeded in pulling Steve all the way up.
Little Steve looked up and saw the most handsome person, he'd ever seen.
He didn't want to lose Tony. Anything but that. Tony was his happiness.
Howard cried Tony's name out loud, while running toward him. He was shaking in fear when he saw Tony's body covered in blood.
He wanted to open his eyes and see the expression Tony had made, but no matter how hard he tried he couldn't open them at all.
Tony pulled away from Natasha's grip. "Nat! How many times are you planning to kill me?" He panted heavily. "This has become a daily habit." Tony muttered.
“STEVE!”
Tony had a terrible night. After not so subtly running away from Steve after their date, he locked himself in his workshop and stayed there for hours, just sitting on the couch, eating a bag of M&Ms while thinking of all the reasons why Steve wouldn’t want to marry him. Too old, too stubborn, too difficult, too narcissistic, workaholic; the words swirled inside his head, making his insides twist with grief. He knew the kind of man he was. And he was very much aware of how bad he was. And Steve, well, Steve was good. He was the best man Tony had ever met. He deserved better. And maybe he knew that too.
“Fine. Now, I need to prepare for my meetings. Hill booked Stane and Hammer this afternoon to pitch their weapons”.
Steve and Tony's friendship grows and there's a benefit to attend.
“Yeah, I know, I can feel it”.
“It’s a video game. He’s saying we should free the animals and let them deal with the goblins”, Peter explained.
He immediately woke up, sitting at the bed, while rubbing his hands on his face, trying to put himself together.
Tony took yet another breath and closed his eyes hard, before opening them with a determined look. “I want to stay and fight”.
“I’ll wait for you”.
“I did”, he said, grimacing, “Rhodey broke my nose and told me to get lost both times”.
“I agree. The Ten Rings were too well informed. I believe someone very powerful paid them to eliminate my godson. I have my suspicions, but I can’t be certain”, she said with a thoughtful expression, glancing to the room where Anthony and Rhodes were, “Did Anthony see your faces?”
“Are you friends? I mean, just friends?”
“Evil has penetrated these lands…”
It was past midnight when Ivan Vanko finally left his house, carrying a small bag with him. Jessica had been watching him for hours ― thank God for the ‘to go’ box from the diner ― and was frankly becoming bored out of her mind. The man was small and bulky, with unruly, long hair and a moustache. He looked exactly like the mugshot she had on her phone. She waited until he had gotten into his car ― an old piece of junk ― and driven away. Then, she got to work.
Tony smiled, raising his chin to look at Thor. “Yeah. Yeah, it is. Thank you, Thor”.
“Well, at least he’s just as insane as you, Tones”, Rhodey said, rolling his eyes.
“I’m sorry”, Clint said, clearly holding back tears, “I’m just so excited for the
Steve just walked in. He’s smiling. He’s holding a Tiffany’s bag
“Tony”, Natasha’s voice suddenly filled the room. She sounded desperate, worried. “The mission went south. Steve… He’s… It’s bad, Tony. Get Cho and the medical team ready, we’ll be at the compound soon”.
The mechanic whined as if in pain, hugging himself with both arms, stepping away from Steve.
“I could take a look at that for you”, Tony offered, making Bucky freeze on the spot. “Improve it, if you want. My PhD is actually in robotics so…”
Steve parked the car right outside the bar, still looking worried. “Just stay close to me, okay? And if they make you even a little bit uncomfortable, you tell me and we’ll get the hell out, okay?”
“Do you have to make everything more difficult, Rogers?”
“What?!” he asked when he finally managed to breathe properly.
“Why did you do that? Tell me I should go for it, that I should date her”.
And with a nod, T’Challa left, leaving Tony behind with a lemon cake and the feeling that something was very
“I do love hot chocolate. Also… JARVIS, why didn’t you tell me Steve was here?”
“Make a copy of everything, J., and put it on our private server”.
“No, yeah, I can’t. I have… a project. Important. Need to… to finish it. Yeah, so…”
as he strode towards him. Tony lifted his head, meeting Steve’s eyes as the blond sat down on the chair in front of him with a determined look.
“Will do”.
Matthew’s eyes were hidden behind the sunglasses, but Tony would bet everything he had that they were filled with determination. He whispered a polite, and grateful, thank you and watched as Steve walked Matthew to the door.
He looked back at Steve, who was smiling softly at him. “I’d like that, Tony”.
Tony and Bucky talk.
Steve always greeted everyone who worked for him on his way up to his office, from the doorman and security guard to his secretary and the intern who brought him coffee. That day was no exception. He smiled at them, asking about their families and their work, smiling when one of the guards, Wade, showed him some pictures of his newly born baby girl. When he finally arrived at his office, he asked Maria, his secretary, to please send flowers to the address he had just texted her.
“I’m guessing the people from
“Really?”, Tony asked, wanting to know more, but it was finally their turn to order. The engineer ordered his usual burger with fries and helped Steve choose as well, telling him what was good and what wasn’t. The menu was a big blackboard hanging on the backside of the truck, so Tony had to hold Steve’s arm and stay on his toes to be able to see it properly. He got a bit closer to Steve, pointing to his favorite dishes as he showed them to the blond. Steve stiffened when he felt Tony’s slender hand close on his bicep. He kept staring ahead, feeling a chill travel his whole body, from his neck to his toes, when the engineer got closer to his ear, his chest fully touching his arm now, as he talked in a low tone about the ingredients on every burger. Steve tried to pay attention, God he really did, but it was like his brain had simply stopped working.
“It’s good to see you again, Steve”, Richard Reed said, shaking Steve’s hand with gusto. Sue did the same.

“Myshka, Bucky is ‘pen guy’”.
“Why?”
“But… He didn’t want
“I ran away from home. Well, not ran exactly. After my parents died, my legal guardian showed his true colors. My father left him everything we had, including the house, the furniture, and any and all inventions I had come up with. I had a robot, I built him myself from scratch. His name was DUM-E. He’s probably been destroyed now or sold for parts”, Tony told them, his eyes suddenly burning as the tears began to fill them, “My guardian threw me out right after the funeral. All I had were the clothes I was wearing at the time, nothing more. I couldn’t afford MIT anymore, so I had to leave there too. My friend Rhodey helped me out, let me stay at his mother’s place for a while”.
“Yep. He was half the size he is today, all bones and asthma”.
“No, you’re not…” Stane said with a sigh. He took his phone from his pocket
They were changing out of their clothes when Steve finally talked.
The house was full, as it usually was on weekends. Bucky and Natasha were sitting together on the couch, his arm around her shoulders as they talked with Pepper and Rhodey. Clint and Sam were sitting on the floor, playing videogames, shouting at each other when the other tried to cheat, while Morgan cheered them on. Thor and Bruce, the newest members of their little family of misfits, were in the kitchen, helping Steve and Tony organize the many containers of food.
, Steve kept repeating in his mind as he walked faster towards the fridges. He needed a beer. Anything, anything at all to numb the incredible pain he was feeling right now.
Clint had been waiting outside for them, two streets away from the apartment. He looked anxious and asked for answers as soon as he got into the car. Steve explained everything that had happened, skipping the part about Tony’s suit of armor.
“Well, we are”, Ned said, looking confused, “We’re just waiting for Shuri. She’s our Dungeon Master”.
“Did your book say that?”
“How about half an hour more and then we take a shower?” the mechanic whispered in his ear.
long enough to know that you’re gonna help me anyway”.
“LET ME GO, I’M DONE WITH THIS. I’M DONE, STEVE. YOU WANNA HIDE YOUR WHOLE LIFE, THAT’S FINE, BUT I’M FUCKING DONE BEING YOUR DIRTY LITTLE SECRET”, Tony screamed, pushing Steve away from him.
“I like him, Bucky. In fact, I’m very much in love with him. I’m happier than I have been in a very long time. And if you’re right, if he’s this horrible person you’re so convinced he is, if he does play for a fool and breaks my heart, then I’ll deal. Please, just… give me the respect of making my own decisions”, he pointedly said, knowing what that phrase meant to both of them.
Those fifteen minutes had felt like fifteen years for Tony. He stood there at the helipad, walking from one side to the other, unable to stand still as he and the medical crew waited for the quinjet to arrive. When it finally did, and its doors opened, Tony felt his legs give out. There was blood. So much blood. Natasha and Sam were covered in it as they pushed a stretcher across the lawn, screaming at Cho to
“I have some work to get done. Otherwise Pepper is going to have my head”, Tony said with a humorless laugh.
“Yeah”, he whispered right back, “You will be, sweetheart. You will be”.
“Your father’s lawyer”, Natasha explained, “He died five months after your parents. Robbery gone wrong, according to the police reports. They never caught the guy who did it”.
The woman snorted in agreement as they both walked out of the warehouse.
Little Morgan entered the room much like a hurricane, throwing herself in Steve’s arm with a loud scream of “Papa! Look at my dress!”
Anthony was six years old when he first saw Natasha. He was playing in the front yard, a shield and a sword in his hands, pretending the big apple tree was an enormous dragon who wanted to eat him, when the roar of car caught his attention. He watched as the black SUV came to a stop right at the entrance of his house, Mr. and Mrs. Romanov coming out of it, looking very presentable as always. His mother quickly came to greet them ― she’d only come to the door for the real important people, Tony had learned a long time ago ―, and that was when the little boy saw her. She stepped out of the car with her head down, immediately putting her hands behind her back when her feet finally hit the floor. She didn’t look up, not even when Maria talked directly to her. Tony shrugged and went back to slaying the big, bad dragon. He knew he should go there and introduce himself, like his mother and Jarvis had taught him, but he just didn’t feel like having his cheeks pinched by grownups. Jarvis would probably scold him later for his lack of manners.
Tony got up and took a step closer to the coffee table, taking all of the remaining boxes and putting them on the floor around it. The others stared at him, unsure of what was going on, until he put one hand on the glass part of the table. A soft, blue light emanated from it and then, with practiced ease, Tony pulled his hand up, making a hologram of Stark Tower appear right there, on the table.
“Right, yeah”, Steve replied, still confused, “we should go”.
were supposed to get rid of the boy,
“But enough sad stories, tell me more about you guys. Steve talks a lot about you”, Tony added after a while, accepting the drink Sam had just handed to him.
“Basically, yes”.
“Hey Tony, what are you doing here?”
“These were taken yesterday, sir. It’s a small town called Gulmira”.
"Uh, yes".
“Look, I just worry, okay? Or did you forget what happened the last time…”
“Well, then, since you’re the boss”, Tony replied in a low tone, climbing into Steve’s lap and rubbing himself against the taller man, making him moan softly, “I’m sure you can stay for a few more hours, right?”
Steve threw his friend a warning look. “Bucky…”
“Yeah, okay. Good luck”.
“Anyway, it was a cold day, and I remember because I had just stolen Sharon’s red sweater”.
“Did you know your heart grows bigger when you’re pregnant?”
“Ah, Captain! I’m so glad you could come”, Stane exclaimed in a welcoming tone. Steve knew he was being polite, but, for some reason, every time that man opened his mouth the blond would get chills, and not the good kind.
“By God, Howard, how you can live in this godforsaken place is frankly beyond me”, she had complained, taking her shoes off at the door and graciously accepting a towel from Jarvis.
“I think Pete should probably go first, he has the most experience with those”, Ned said in a joking tone and then stopped, “Wait, do you still have your powers? Like, your Peter Tingle?”
Bucky snorted. “Is that what you tell Steve right before sex?”
Tony was looking down. He took a deep breath and nodded, looking up to meet Steve’s eyes. “I trust you”, he whispered.
“It’s an RPG”, Cassie replied, and then immediately explained after seeing the trickster’s blank look directed at her, “A Role Playing Game. We each create a character and use these special sheets of paper to write down their relevant characteristics, background story and abilities. Then, the Dungeon Master sends us an adventure on a far away land”.
“So… We can do this, right?” he asked with a worried look, “I mean, we could just call off the whole thing”.
“Ok, just… JARVIS, please scan the very real human skull on my table and run the facial reconstruction program. Hack the PD database and try to match the results with any missing person pictures in the area”.
“Outrageous. We shall defeat this villain at once”.
“I’m sorry, what did you just say?”
“So, you were saying something about drawing as a child?”
Steve shook his head. “Excuse me, why are YOU dumping MY ass?”
“Yeah. Bad choice”.
“Ok, let’s get this party started, people!”, Harley said, watching the bear chase the goblins from a distance, before sliding down the small hill towards the mess. Ned and Cassie soon followed, while Michele, emitting a very faint red glow, floated down after them.
And with that, Tony turned and left. And this time, Steve didn’t try to follow him.
Steve looked at his best friend with a frown and then shook his head, resigned. “Fine”, he said, and Bucky punched the air with a soft
“Oh, I wouldn’t miss it for the world, you clueless, stupid giant”, he said with a  smirk, “what’s his girl’s name?”
Meanwhile, Director Carter had brought Tony up to speed with the whole investigation. They had locked themselves in her office and talked for hours while Steve and Bucky waited outside. In the end, the genius had taken less than ten minutes to come up with a device that would allow Natasha to successfully hack Stane’s computer and get all the evidence they needed. He assured his aunt Peggy that the device – and the program – would be ready by the end of the day and left, throwing Steve a longing look and a smile on his way out.
The doctor in charge had taken one good look at Steve and another at his medical file and quickly stamped a 4-F in his enrolment paper. Steve tried to make his case, but the man would not hear it. Still, the young artist didn’t give up. He lied on his form and tried again. And again. And again. And again. Sometimes he would consider giving up, but then the hospital bills would arrive and he would think of his mother, his beautiful, kind, hardworking mother who had given up everything to care for her only son. His mother, who had worked more shifts than she could possibly handle to put her son through school. The woman who took beating from her drunk husband in order to protect her boy. He would think of her and remember every single that she had done for him and that always gave him the strength to try again.
“Ma’am?”
“Tony…”, he whispered in a hoarse voice, “We can’t…”
. Later, he would swear that Steve’s smile faltered a bit when he replied,
Steve rolled his eyes. They were definitely
“He was
“Yeah?”, Steve asked, laughing, “What’s that?”
“Yeah, I know. Howard Stark was the brains behind the weapons, right? Makes sense that after his death they’d be out of good ideas”, Bucky explained, shrugging.
JARVIS’ voice filled the room.
“You… What?”
Steve shrugged. “I thought you might appreciate some company… and a nice cup of hot chocolate, of course”.
Natasha blinked at him. She put her arms on the table, leaning closer to him.
"Uh... Where's Jones?"
Iron Man and Captain America exchanged a worried look. Tony dropped the faceplate just as Steve grabbed his shield from his back.
“We’re bringing him down, sweetheart”, he said in a whisper, “Trust me”.
“I understand. I know my word won’t mean much to you, but I promise you, Tony, I’m not like that. I worked really hard to have everything I have and, to be honest, I like using my money to make the people around me happy. But I can dial down a little bit if you think that would help. Just give me a chance to prove to you that I’m different from these people you’ve met before. Please”.
“The Jericho”, Steve supplied, and then explained upon seeing the perplexed look on Tony’s face, “He showed it to me, said it would be operational in a few weeks”.
Tony did so, still holding his jaw with a painful expression.
As they left, Steve could have sworn he heard Natasha say something like
“I believe the Captain has prepared something special for you, sir. You’ll see”.
Finally, the happy ending they deserve.
“Strange said ‘the beast’, though. So goblins don’t make much sense”, Harley supplied with a shrug, “But we’re gonna have to deal with them to go forward, right? Look, there’s a path over there”, he pointed to the small pathway right across the clearing.
“Talk to me”, he asked in a soft tone.
“You… You’ve been cheating on me?” Tony asked quietly, his big, brown eyes filled with pain and confusion.
“So, the charity ball is in two days. I already talked to Reed and asked him to talk business with Stane, to keep him occupied”, Steve said, playing with Tony’s hand as he spoke, “Greg and his men are going to be there, just as a precaution”.
sound. The corpse, then, took a few steps away from the computer and, when it was far enough from it, let itself fall to the ground and there it stayed, moving no longer.
“Uh, is that… Is that a fucking robot?!” Bucky asked as excited as a kid on Christmas.
And at that moment, feeling Steve’s mouth on his, feeling his soft touches on his body, Tony couldn’t help but think of all the things they had faced so far, and all the things they would most likely face in the future. And for the first time in a very long time he wasn’t afraid. Because they would face everything together, just like Steve had always said.
“So, we’re planning a wedding”.
“JARVIS is the one thing keeping Stane from accessing the Jericho. I’m the only person that can activate it, get it to work”, Tony confirmed, “and when all of that happened, I created JARVIS to protect it from him. The reason no one can crack the code is because he’s an AI. He is always rewriting himself”.
“It’s hospital policy, Mr. Stark”, the nurse replied with a fond roll of her eyes.
Everything changed when he met Dr. Erskine.
It had been a long time since Tony had stepped on a red carpet, but, for some reason he couldn’t quite understand, it felt… right. When they had first decided to attend Reed’s Charity Ball, he’d felt nervous and insecure, but now, walking side by side with Steve, wearing a tuxedo made especially for him, he couldn’t help but feel like he belonged there. The flashing cameras and the screaming paparazzi did not faze him at all, on the contrary, it all felt natural, like he was coming home after a long, horrible vacation.
Tony simply nodded.
When Happy, his driver, finally arrived, Steve already fancied himself half in love with the mechanic. The rain had stopped, so Tony walked the blonde outside, standing on the sidewalk as he got into the car.
, he thought,
“He told me the name of my daughter’s school, told me what route she made every day when she went home. He said someone powerful wanted the Starks dead and that, if I didn’t help, he could make my family pay for it”.
The mechanic looked down at his phone and shook his head. “No, I don’t think I will”.
Tony smiled at Steve before turning to Morgan and kissing her nose affectionately.
“Raza said thank you for the armor design, by the way. He found the pieces in the middle of the desert and thought I might be able to help him put it together. We had a little disagreement, I’m afraid, but don’t worry, my boy. I’ll make good use of your little creation”, Stane said, looking down at the small arc reactor with greedy eyes, “you’ve made me the most powerful man in the world, Tony. It’s a pity you won’t be here to see my triumph”.
Tony smiled at Rhodey, putting his tray on the table as they all sat down.
“Yeah. That’s fair”.
“It’s not that. It’s just… my old life, the one I ran from. It’s too complicated and I don’t want to drag Steve into it”.
“I don’t get it”, Sam said, “I thought your AI had an in. Why can’t he hack the computer?”
Steve huffed, taking the papers from the table and reading them once again.
“Tony? Can I ask you something?”
Tony was eleven years old when he was kidnapped for the first time. He’d been waiting for Jarvis right outside school. The butler was late, which was very unusual. When the car finally arrived, the boy got in without a second thought, throwing his Superman backpack on the car seat. He was about to ask Jarvis why he was late when he finally noticed the driver was not, in fact, his butler. By then, it was already too late. Hands suddenly grabbed and pulled him to the side, just as the door closed, and his nose and mouth were quickly covered. He tried to scream, to set himself free, but he knew it was in vain. No one could hear him. He felt a prick on his neck and soon his eyes were too heavy to be open any longer and he fell unconscious. He spent ten days in captivity. Those were the worst days of his life. He was kept in a small, dark room, with a barred window that barely allowed any sunlight inside. They’d bring him food (usually a piece of bread) and water occasionally.
“Oh, come on, Stevie, it was more than that and you know it”, Bucky immediately countered, looking angry, “You were a mess! You didn’t leave your house for almost a month, you didn’t eat, you didn’t talk to anyone! You were a goddamn zombie! I know you like to see the best in everyone, but some people are just bad, okay? And when I found out Tony was lying about his name I got mad because I thought ‘great, here’s another Ophelia to tear him apart’. I was wrong about that, and I’m sorry, but I only did it because I care about you”.
As it turned out, he didn’t quite have a chance to talk to Steve the next morning. He was woken up by a call from Pepper, telling him he was needed at the R&D department immediately and that Happy was already waiting outside for him. He quickly got dressed and sent a text to Steve from the car.
Everyone turned to glare at him before turning their attention back to the clanking noise ahead. The sounds were somewhat weird, like a big old rusty machine, the gang thought as they inched closer to its origin. Suddenly, they saw a clearing a few feet down from where they were, much like the one they had found themselves earlier upon waking up in this strange world. Down there, scattered on the grass, were big cages with all sorts of animals inside, with goblins patrolling the place, carrying small swords and bows.
“You’re so funny. No, really, I’m laughing on the inside”, he replied, his head on her legs, closing his eyes as she softly ran her fingers through his hair, “He asked me, actually, and he’s bringing
“Are you?” Steve turned to look at him.
“That is a horrible plan”, Natasha said, deadpanned, “You should do it”.
Life has not been easy, my friends. I had to write this chapter between sessions and during the late night, so forgive any mistakes. Don't forget to leave some comments, so I can read them and feel that the work I put into it wasn't in vain lol
, a secret.
, he thought to himself as he got in the car, slamming the door with a little bit more force than planned,
Steve smiled at him, “Yeah, I ordered them for you. I know how much you like them and I just knew you’d be hungry. You know, ‘cause you never eat properly”.
“He came to me earlier that night. He told me what was going to happen. I didn’t have a choice”.
Only one more chapter to go!
“Didn’t expect it”.
“This is all my fault. I promised I would protect him…”
“I’m sorry for not telling you about the Accords”. He didn’t apologize for Siberia. He couldn’t. He regretted his actions, but he just couldn’t bring himself to apologize. So he found himself trying to explain it to Steve instead. “If you had given me the time to come to terms with it, away from him. If you had told me in another environment, without showing me that video, I might have acted differently”.
“I can’t believe we hung out on my dumpster of an apartment when we could’ve been hanging out here”, he put the pizza on the table nearby and walked to the nearest couch, touching it, “You know, I love how you’re the perfect mixture between fancy rich and Brooklyn broke”.
“Really?” Tony asked with a sly smile, “You would do that?”
“Tony”, Natasha said, kneeling down in front of her teammate, “you know he didn’t really mean it like that, right?”
“I just didn’t want to see you hurt again”.
“Next weekend”, Steve replied, “We’ll have Dr. Reed’s Charity Ball next weekend. He already sent the invitations. Stane has been trying to get Reed as a client, so he’ll definitely be there. Tony and I will go, we’ll keep him distracted. Meanwhile, you get inside Stark Tower and get the documents”.
Tony gasped, looking up at Steve, his eyes full of fear. Steve pulled him in a hug.
, Bucky thought. He really had made breakfast. Then he and Tony had very gross and unhygienic sex against the kitchen top, according to a very happy Steve, who should learn how to do his morning runs with his mouth shut because Bucky and Sam
“Well, peanut is a little scared, but I’m doing my best to calm them now”, Tony joked back.
“Damn”, Tony laughed, fishing his phone from his pocket and giving it to Steve, “You’re really having a bad day, uh”.
“Okay”.
And with a final look, Tony slammed the door on Stane’s face.
“We can’t do that”, Steve complained loudly, “he could send us to jail or something”.
“Here, baby, come to daddy! We’re going to have some cookies!”
“So, they joined this crazy experiment, died because of it and Ross lied to their families and friends about what happened?” Steve asked in an angry tone.
Steve immediately turned back around, rushing to Tony’s side. He was holding his belly with a frightened expression on his face.
The moment they arrived at school, Tony knew something was wrong. He walked in with his friends right behind him and noticed how everybody kept glancing at him.
“Tony, I… Is this a bad time?” Strange asked, seeming concerned.
Steve must have noticed the uneasiness in his eyes because he quickly asked, “So, you were talking about that clean energy project before… How does it work again?”
“Literally”.
Steve’s face went red and he opened his mouth, probably to deny everything, but thought better of it and just groaned, covering his face.
The answer came as soon as he sent it.
“Yep. Pepper is bringing Happy, Nat and Sam went shopping for something, can’t remember what, and Clint and Coulson said they will be a little late but they’ll be here”.
“Tony is very smart but he is also very sure of his intellect. I knew that he would pick you two out right away. He’d be so focused on what he found out about you, so sure that he’s uncovered the truth, that he would not pay a lick of attention to the actual spy. Also, janitors are practically invisible. A sad truth, but a truth nonetheless”.
“JARVIS, please show him”, Bruce asked with a small smile.
“I’m just saying, man. It’s been three months. There is no way a civilian survives three months in the hands of some fucked up terrorists. The guy is dead. Better accept it now and be done with it”.
Before Agent Hill could answer, the doors on the far side of the corridor opened to reveal a very dirty Anthony on a wheelchair, followed closely by his Lieutenant friend and the Captain himself. Margaret quickly walked towards her godson, kissing his bandaged forehead carefully.
Soon, the waitress brought them their plates and they ate and talked and laughed all night long. And, for a few hours, Tony forgot about all his insecurities and his doubts and just let himself enjoy Steve’s company.
“Now that we’re alone… I think it’s time for a proper hello”, Steve whispered, capturing Tony’s lips in a long kiss.
“Makes sense. I hadn’t thought of that”, Natasha replied, “Alright. We’ll get the documents, Clint and Bucky will investigate the lawyer and you two”, she said, pointing at Steve and Tony, “will act as if nothing is happening.

He hung up the phone with a smile. Pepper would definitely make things much easier. He was about to turn and go to the kitchen, so he could check if Steve had arrived with their food, when suddenly his body went stiff. There was a loud, continuous ringing in his ears that seemed to travel through his whole body. He started to fall backwards, his legs giving out, when someone caught him, lowering him into the nearby couch. He frantically moved his eyes – the only thing he

“So…”

Sam and Bucky exchanged a look. “We’re on it”, Sam said, nodding to Bucky, “We’ll check the other bathrooms, meet us back at the entrance”.
They were all down there, having breakfast, just as JARVIS had said. Bruce was making pancakes while Natasha cut some fruit with the dexterity of a renowned chef. Barton was sitting on top of the kitchen island, eating a bowl of sugary cereal.
“Is Jarvis a friend of yours?”
“You can’t go on this date”, Bucky replied, walking from one side of their small living room to the other.
