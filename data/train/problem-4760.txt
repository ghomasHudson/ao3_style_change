Scott took the man's hand and shook it firmly. "You're not the only newbie in the mix, so don't feel bad. There's not a lot of downtime on a team like this."
“It might not be helping,” Coulson finally allowed, “though we haven’t found signs of any malicious technology. Once we have a proper replacement that will work on at least a temporary basis, we’ll do more extensive testing.” He’d seen the way Bucky flinched at the sound of the man’s name and left off the fact that he hoped Tony would be the one heading up the examination. Hopefully his excitement over the tech would overwhelm his distaste for the man the arm belonged to. “I was thinking that it might help if you saw someone in the mirror who was a little more familiar. Once you’re cleared, a haircut and some new clothes might do you a world of good. Looking like the you that you remember might make you feel more like him too.”
Bucky glanced down at his hand in Steve's and felt a nervous flutter in his chest. "It's not your fault," he murmured, meeting the other man's gaze again. "Apparently saying the wrong word sets me off. I don't even remember what happened, but your Agent Coulson handled himself pretty well." A pang of guilt made Bucky hastily add, "I'm just glad I didn't hurt anyone."
It was a relief to have it brought up so casually, and Steve smiled his gratitude. "Yeah. Really good. Better than I thought we could be." He'd spent a lot of time losing things since his return and feeling utterly out of place. "I finally feel like I'm the right place and the right time, and..." He cast an apologetic glance at Clint, "and I feel awful feeling so good when things are such a mess."
Steve’s jaw clenched at the words. He wished that they were true, that the only action Bucky had seen had been in the 40s, long ago and far away. Instead he let out a long, slow breath and ventured, “That might not be true. We don’t know what Hydra might have had you do. You were with them for so long, Bucky… it could’ve been anything. If you’re starting to remember, just let it come. The more we know, the better, even if it hurts.” As the man’s friend, Steve just wanted to tell him to forget it all and try to move on. As the leader of the Avengers, Steve knew they didn’t have that luxury if they wanted to catch the people who had masterminded the attacks on Tony.
Phil swallowed hard at the words and at Clint's tone. Not jumping into bed too soon with Clint was going to take a reserve of inner strength that dwarfed having to keep silent during particularly insipid staff meetings. "Meanwhile we just have to keep ourselves cooled down enough not to get arrested for indecent exposure." His gaze flicked briefly to the couple groping rather thoroughly at another of the trees. "Unfortunately unlike them, we have security clearances to worry about, and arrest records complicate that." He hated worrying about it in that moment because he really wanted to pull Clint onto his lap and keep kissing him until they were too dizzy to do it anymore.
"Make a note for the PR guys. Think up a way to blame it on the alcohol without making Steve look like a complete lush, and send Fury some kind of an apology and notes on my ideas. Make it sound sincere... ish."
Logan chuckled. "Well, at least Chuck just sent us out to fight ancient evil. He didn't insist on us bringing it home with us." He sighed quietly. "Then again, I guess a houseful o' mutants would be enough potential mass destruction."
Logan smirked. "Just consider it turnabout for the rude awakenin' this morning, and be glad you didn't lose an everything in the process." He turned his attention back to Coulson. "So... Phil. Steve tells me you've got all the info I could ever want about what it is I'll be doing here."
"This is a new picture," Bruce said. He smiled at Clint's look of disbelief. "Yeah. It's like that. So we're going to need a minute to figure out if and how we can use this thing." He held up a hand when Clint looked ready to speak. "Without touching it."
Logan actually flinched slightly when Loki reappeared. His annoyance at being startled disappeared fairly quickly though when his eyes took in Scott's glasses. He picked them up slowly, jaw clenching as he caught the faintest scent of the other man on them. Loki's words sank in a moment later, and he looked up with an eyebrow raised. "So... you're just sendin' us back?"
At the head of the group Natasha heard too. "Wait here," she snapped, assuming command without a thought. Normally Steve would have interfered, but in that moment, he was too scared of what he might see on the other side of the doors. He just nodded meekly, going with Thor to make sure the rest of the building was clear for their egress.
Clint had opened his mouth to protest, but that faint roughness in Phil's voice as he said that last bit made him shut his mouth. He hadn't thought of that. He wondered if Nat had. "I get it," he said quietly, his arm still tingling a little where the other man had touched him. He remembered how it had been, sitting around while Nat suffered at Loki's hands. Clint couldn't imagine having been the one who'd given her the order to go there in the first place. He let his leg drift to the side, bumping his knee against Phil's. He smirked faintly. "Though it's gonna be pretty tough to not lock us in your office and break all of HR's stupid rules, right there on your desk." He was pretty sure that Fury and a few others were going to be out for blood if they even got wind of what they'd done in the club an hour ago. He couldn't imagine how they'd all deal with the knowledge that it wasn't a one-time thing. Then again, Phil was probably valuable enough to get out with just an ass-chewing. And Clint... well, it was par for the course for him to break rules he didn't like.
Tony hesitated, then did as he was told, remembering in the back of his mind that he didn't really have an option. The coaxing words combined with Steve's smooth, gentle voice didn't hurt a damn bit, either. He sighed as Loki's fingers sank into tight muscles, letting his mind go slack. He tried not to let himself think about the fact that it was anyone but Steve rubbing the tension away from him. "Feels good, baby," he murmured, trying to solidify the illusion as much as possible.
Clint chuckled. "Seen that movie. Good movie." He paused, cocked his head. "You know what's weird? I feel like Loki could be Alan Rickman's younger brother... you know, aside from one being a good actor and the other being a social deviant with mommy issues."
"Something tells me that a place like this has one or two rooms that can withstand a nuclear blast. Let's see if I can break one." Scott pulled together a makeshift outfit and reminded himself that shopping was a high priority issue once they were done worrying about the Brotherhood or Loki killing them all. It took a few false starts searching on the computer, but it was fairly easy to find a decent map of the building minus a few grayed out areas that Scott decided he probably didn't even want to know about. Every organization had their secrets.
Tony tugged at Steve as if to pull him closer, though there really wasn't a lot closer he could get. Instead, the billionaire settled for burrowing his face into his lover's damp hair, sighing happily at the closeness. "I didn't sleep," he said quietly, resting his chin on top of Steve's head. "When you were in the ICU. I mean, I know I stay up for days on end, but... Jesus, Steve, I couldn't even distract myself. I just... all I could do was think how badly I'd screwed up and how I might-" He swallowed, feeling himself tremble a little. "...lose you."
Logan gave Nat and then the tray a skeptical look. He definitely wasn't the sort for having his alcohol fruity, but he accepted the proffered drink in the spirit of the evening. The shot was sweet, too sweet, but the vodka gave him a nice split-second buzz, and he smiled faintly. "Alright, not as terrible as it could be," he allowed, putting the cup back down. Scott seemed to be pretty enamored with the concoction, and the idea of seeing Nat and Scott drunk sounded pretty damned amusing. Logan was having a hard time remembering the last time he'd smiled and laughed so much - even if it wasn't that much by most people's standards - and he wasn't about to be a spoilsport.
Going in solo had seemed like a really, really good idea. He could turn invisible, so no one would see him, and the partner they'd saddled him with was getting on Darien's last nerve. Becoming his brother's guinea pig was supposed to get him out of jail. Instead he found himself just as stifled in a whole different kind of way. He hated it. He hated every last second of it.
“If it helped… if it made it hurt less… if thinking it was me made it easier for you, then I’m glad, but I need you to know that… that no matter how much I want you, I would never hurt you.” Steve’s stomach twisted into a knot, but he didn’t let himself back down. Instead he brushed a chaste kiss to Tony’s lips and tried not to look as utterly terrified as he felt. Tony was skittish, and if the kiss was the wrong thing to do, Steve knew he might have months of a withdrawn billionaire to look forward to. The thought of hurting Tony by trying to help him weighed heavily on Steve’s mind as he waited, barely breathing, to make sure Tony was okay with what he’d done.
Bruce was off to try and find a traceable energy signature for the device Loki had used. Fury was fuming somewhere. Scott had been there but had barely spoken. The man looked too shaken to be much use, but he'd insisted on at least being there for the debriefing. Afterwards Coulson had suggested he stay on top of the techs even though they didn't really need it. "Of course we are," Phil answered as though that was a foregone conclusion. It was in a way, he just wasn't ready to speculate on whether Logan and Nat would be alive when they were found. "You need rest. A shower. Tony bled all over you."
The simple statement seemed to go straight to the most animal parts of Logan's brain, and he half-moaned, half-growled his approval as his hips gave another sharp thrust forward. "You are," he rumbled, biting roughly at his lover's collarbone, "all mine." Logan was accustomed to having to treat his partners with kid gloves, having to hold back to keep from hurting them. Scott seemed to relish him letting his true nature off the leash. He pressed his lips to the second bite mark a moment later, his thrusts still slow but slamming home hard. "Fuck, you're beautiful."
Tony moaned, then remembered that that didn't count as words. "Thanks.... got a haircut this morning," he said, managing a faint smirk before another shift on Steve's part completely obliterated the look of amusement. Tony arched into the larger man, his lips parted, eyes rolled back and partially closed as internal muscles gripped at the hot shaft inside him. He moaned, long and low, as his hand grasped Steve's muscular ass, pulling him in with each thrust as if he couldn't get enough.
"F-fuck, Clint," he groaned, fingers moving to Clint's shoulders to keep from grabbing him by the back of the head. He could see the tears in Clint's eyes, but he wasn't stopping anyway, and it was sexy as hell. His mind still couldn't fully process that Clint was there and sucking him off. He knew from a practical standpoint that he should have probably cautioned Clint to stop or slow down. He didn't. He couldn't, frankly, since coming up with any sort of coherent words was becoming progressively more difficult.
He nodded his agreement with the idea. He needed the practice, and whatever capacity in which he ended up serving with the Avengers, they deserved to have an idea of his abilities. "Then I'll save the gun for the next round."
Tony glanced at Steve in a way that was somewhere between apologetic and mischievous. "You, uh... If you're not gonna be weirded out... I mean, if Steve doesn't..." He paused. He felt like his mind was working at two thousand miles an hour and that simple human speech wasn't enough to get it all out at once. "Wanna come with us?"
As much as he would have liked to debate the issue or disagree, he couldn't. The truth was that Steve was having more fun in the few minutes since they left than he had the whole party. It was strange zipping away in a fancy car while wearing a tuxedo with a guy he could barely get along with, but it wasn't bad. Steve allowed himself to look over at the man next to him, appreciating for a brief moment the fact that Tony really could pull himself together well when he tried - or, rather, Pepper could pull him together. Or Jarvis. When he caught Tony's eye, Steve felt flustered, caught looking, "Nice tux," he complimented lamely.
"It was before the exploding started," Coulson agreed. "It should hold." He hoped it would. The idea of the guards having to let out the prisoners housed there - or, almost worse, NOT let them out - left him feeling more than uneasy.
As he neared the ground, Steve noted Tony still circling in the sky, apparently testing out the new system. When they got back he'd have a few things to say about the man using missions as test runs, but mostly he was just glad things really were working. Steve spared a silent prayer that they'd all be going home in one piece before touching down with relative ease and giving Bruce, already untangling himself from his own chute, a wave. "Now if we can get Iron Man to land," he muttered into his comm, a not-so-subtle hint for Tony to stop playing and join them.
It wasn’t as if he would have said no to any coworker in trouble, but Phil Coulson wasn’t too proud to admit that he never would have said no to Steve Rogers. So when the man stopped into his office and asked him to keep an eye on Bucky and to get him out of the infirmary as soon as possible, he took the request seriously. Honestly Steve seemed to work hard at not being a burden to anyone most of the time. Even when most people would have been screaming for help, he preferred to deal with his own problems. If he was reaching out, Coulson was happy to do what he could.
Steve let out a shaky groan and finally coaxed his legs into moving. He couldn't help staring at Tony as the man moved, every sinuous step leaving more of his gorgeous body exposed. Steve almost forgot to see to his own clothes until he was stepping across the threshold of the bathroom. Steve left them all in an undignified heap right there and caught up so that he could catch Tony around the waist and pull him in close. It was still odd, the fit of their bodies together while his own form lay somewhere between normal and not. That did nothing to detract from the perfection of the touches. "Hope this is okay even before, y'know, the sleep bit."
Hurriedly flinging her bracers aside, Natasha moved in. She knew it would be stupid to judge the man by his age or go easier on him for it. It just meant his bones would break a lot more easily. She rolled beneath Sif and moved to sweep the man's legs out from beneath his body. "I think we have a decent idea," she countered, leaping for the mutant and hoping that the blitz and a little pain would distract him enough to let the others get free.
Clint gagged a little, but still managed to drink the issue down. He kept sucking until he felt he'd drawn every last strain of pleasure from the other man, drawing away only when Phil's cries sounded almost pained.  He pulled back, giving the man's cock a few light licks as if he couldn't get enough before he finally stood and pressed his lips to Phil's. "Fucking amazing," he breathed, still catching his breath.
"Speechless." Clint looked pleased with his observation. Standing, he unfastened his pants, letting his half-hard cock press against Darien's cheek. "Start licking," he rumbled, his own heart rate spiking. "Get me good and hard so I can fuck your throat... nice and deep." It was difficult to keep his cool. Darien looked perfect, tied down and eager.
Bruce held up his hands defensively when Coulson gave him an accusing look at the sight of Stark out of his chair. "Unless you want the big guy to babysit him, you should just be glad that he hasn't actually torn anything," he pointed out, then glared at Tony and his useless explanation. "You're not going to like this." He tapped a few buttons on a floating interface, bringing up a 3D projection of the hammer into the room. "We had to use some other no-touchy tech - specifically, one of the Hydra weapons - to even extract anything from this... whatever it is." The hammer was replaced by a schematic of a modified Hydra weapon. "Good news is, we can use this to fix our friends."|
Logan frowned. He didn't like the idea much, but he wasn't going to argue. "Clingy" would never be an adjective used to describe him. "That's fine, if you need space," he allowed reluctantly. He took a swig of beer, looking thoughtful, then gave Scott a concerned look. "You gonna be okay, sleepin' alone?"
Grateful for the silent permission, Scott let go as well. His release spattered out across the rumpled bedclothes as his whole body shook. It was intense in a way he didn't understand. For a moment the whirling need inside him was satisfied, and Scott caught his breath. Oxygen rushed in and then the air left him again. Slowly Scott's head began to feel clearer. By the time Clint finally set him down on the bed, he felt almost like himself. "You need to get me to a cell," he managed in a shaky voice. "Sooner rather than later."
"As I'm going to be," Scott answered, though he smiled faintly. The truth was that he felt okay for the moment. He felt better being at Logan's side than he would have being separated from the team. The next time around, he knew it would probably be different. For now he wasn't ready to allow too much space, not where Loki was concerned. He wanted to know that things were dealt with, not just hear about it.
“With luck, not long,” Coulson answered. He saw the look on Bucky’s face and allowed, “I know your luck hasn’t been particularly fantastic so far. They want to run a few tests, see if they can find anything obvious, and then I’m hoping they’ll be willing to release you into-”
Hopefully before anyone's feelings could get hurt, Bruce interjected, "We'll get it figured out, Agent Coulson."
"No government agency does," Steve sighed. He didn't want to break the moment further, but he had to know. "Show me the file? Whatever is in it, we should know." Fury liked information, but he didn't dig past Tony's defenses without reason. Steve almost hated the idea of what the reason night be.
Scott let out a soft sigh. Logan sounded calmer, more centered. "Better knowing you're still talking to me, but... kind of worse knowing you're likely to threaten the lives of anyone else I talk to." He fixed Logan with a pointed stare. "Bringing back up wasn't p.c. but Agent Coulson is a superior officer, and you know I'm not the guy who's going to ignore all the rules. Besides, he seems nice. So maybe don't gut him?"
Clint was already closing ground, circling like a deadly predator, the hammer held at the ready and a strange, deep violet tinge to his eyes. "I don't think you get it. We're not here to negotiate and take you back with us. We're here to kill you. And I get to do the honors."
"Yes. Yes, he..." Honestly she had no idea if he would be the least bit pleased. Steve had been through too much. "Well, I suspect that he'll be happy to be back in the fight." After a moment of uncomfortable silence, she suggested, "Jarvis? When Captain Rogers wakes up, could you let him know that we'd like to see him?" She didn't miss the note of distinct sadness in Jarvis' voice when he agreed. He might have been AI, but he'd been programmed by Tony Stark, and apparently there were downsides to that brilliance. "Thank you. Dr. Banner, if you'd like to get rest, we can keep watch here."
"Logan works," the feral mutant replied, crossing his arms over his chest and glowering. He tilted his head curiously. "And if you ain't worried about SHIELD or the Avengers, then what in the hell is in my head that you could possibly want?" he wanted to know. He couldn't imagine anything in his messy, muddled past that a god could care about. "I mean, if it's somethin' from the past, can't ya just do the 'mirror mirror' thing 'n' get whatever it is yer lookin' for?"
"I don't think that's how it works, Tony," Steve answered, though he only sounded about vaguely worried. "There are worse things to be addicted to - from my point of view, anyway. It sounds like it would kind of work out for me." He began carding his fingers through dark, sweaty hair. "Sounds silly, but I like your hair. It's soft." Steve continued to idly toy with it, running bits that were curling between his fingers and enjoying the texture and the shape. "This is the part where we have to remember you actually have work to do, isn't it?"
It was intense feeling Tony inside him and intense having the man's soft lips pressed against his own. Whatever he'd expected falling into bed with Tony Stark, it had never been that he could feel so loved. Blindly he reached out and found one of Tony's hands, lacing their fingers tightly together. "We should've done this sooner," he murmured against Tony's lips. "You feel so good, baby..."
Logan ran his fingers lightly over a bite mark in Scott's shoulder that he was pretty sure he hadn't caused, then looked back up into Scott's eyes. "Might change the mood a little," he murmured, lips brushing against Scott’s, "but killin' it ain't a concern." His fingers brushed over Scott's hips as if to soothe the injuries there, his lips over the ruts gouged by blunt fingernails on Scott’s shoulder. He pulled Scott close against him, his lips travelling gently over his lover's stubbled throat. "We just need to go easy."
"I know," Coulson answered earnestly. "Fury told me. I didn't appreciate the bit with the cards. Those were expensive." He smile wryly. "I made the mistake of asking to see the security footage. It looks stupider on TV. Not to mention it's off-putting to watch yourself bleed out." The next part was the part he rarely let himself think and said even less often. "I still don't know how I'm breathing. Apparently it's classified even from me."
Steve's jaw tensed, and he gave a shake of his head. "No. If you get the urge to overshare, remember that you're not being quiet for SHIELD. You're doing it for me," he added softly. "If I'd been caught back in the War, they would've either buried it, or I would've been finished. Now, here... I have a chance to remind people that who I'm attracted to has nothing to do with how I do my job. I can stand up for a lot of people who might not be able to stand up for themselves. That's why I did all this in the first place."
"No," Bucky replied, easing back into bed. "I'll be okay." Miraculously, he could already feel the injection working its way through his system. "Just... need.... some sleep... that's all." His eyes growing heavier with each passing second, Bucky exhaled deeply as darkness welcomed him into its embrace. In what seemed like no time at all, he had drifted off into a restful slumber.
Heavy sleeper or not, it took seconds before Steve was on his feet and standing behind Logan. "What- oh." The situation became clear rather quickly, and he had to fight not to laugh. He had learned the first time he was around a truly sloshed Tony Stark that the man could be a bit handsy when he was inebriated. "Tony, I imagine you don't remember, but you started the night out on the couch. You ended it in Logan's bed. I think it was a little.. startling," he supplied as calmly as possible, though Steve finally gave up trying not to smile. Deciding that caffeine might diffuse the situation and convince Logan not to make good on his threats from the night before about slicing up their resident genius, Steve added, "I'll order us some breakfast," before making his way into the sitting area to place the order.
The sudden shock of movement jerked Scott back to consciousness too. His eyes snapped open, and he would have moved if it wasn't for the fact that a heavy body was pressed tightly against his own - was, in fact, wrapped around his own. Still bleary from sleep, Scott relaxed when he realized it was Logan next to him. His breathing slowed again, and he tried to get his eyes to focus. "What's'a matter?" His head gave a throb, a not-so-subtle reminder that he should've stopped drinking far sooner the night before.
Just thinking about that moment made a chill run through Steve. Even though he and Tony had been allies at the time and not yet friends, it had hurt. The idea that the man had stepped up and been everything Steve thought he couldn't be only to go and die... but then his eyes had opened and Steve had found himself breathing again. "Don't ever do that to me again, by the way. Ever. It was bad before, but now I'm pretty sure I couldn't take it. I'm old, remember? I could have a stroke."
"Hey, at least I had my clothes on." He glanced at his two passengers. "I had my clothes on, right?" Tony looked back at the phone on Steve's thigh. "Hey, I know no one's surprised by anything I do anymore, so if you're gonna get all butthurt that America's golden child likes men, I think this could turn a lot uglier, dear Director. I'll loan you some of my PR guys. I'm sure they can spin it." Without waiting for a reply, he reached over and shut off Steve's cellphone.
Logan was tired of holding back and had the feeling that Steve was tired of it too. He drew back and then slammed his cock home with all his might, relishing the freedom his partner's resilience offered. As Logan set a perfectly hungry rhythm, his gaze wandered to Tony's face, and the intent look of pleasure there only served to send Logan further into a frenzy. The feral mutant growled his pleasure as he took what he wanted.
As the two Avengers passed another seedy looking dive, an impulse occurred to Tony. Never the sort to ignore these things, he took a sharp turn into the narrow alleyway leading to the door. "Y'know what? I need a drink. You need a drink, Cap?" He didn't bother with waiting on an answer, instead ducking inside. The place was dark, smokey, and smelled pretty strongly of piss. "Looks like a great place for a drink," Tony remarked as half the bar turned to look at the only white men in the place.
Loki hissed his pleasure, thrilling at the rough contact. "Precisely," he purred in agreement. His hands slid down to cup Victor's denim-clad ass. "Gentle isn't what I'm looking for." It seemed Victor felt the same way. He pulled back enough to look down the front of the mutant. "Shall we see what we're working with?"
"Fuck, that's it. Take it, you little bitch," Clint growled against Darien's throat. He rested his head against the other man's shoulder, falling silent save for his panting breaths. Eventually pushing himself back up on his hands, he locked gazes once again with his partner, starting to thrust harder and faster. He was soon moaning with every movement, savoring every shift and sound that Darien made as he pounded the other man into the floor. He came with a growl and a curse, biting hard into Darien's shoulder.
Clint felt cold fear wash over him at the question, and he leaned against Phil, taking one of the man's hands in his own to try and quell some of the shaking. "He..." The archer's voice roughened and broke, and he took several deep breaths, forcing himself to compartmentalize the event so that he could at least form words. "He raped us. First Phil. Then me." Another breath, and Clint was staring hard at a point on the floor that he wasn't really seeing. "Th... there was nothing I could do... I couldn't stop him..." Tears leaked from his eyes, but he didn't seem to register them.
"Good point." Steve smiled and kissed Tony's shoulder, then his neck. "In that case, I'd better take care of your heart instead." It was a loaded statement and a cheesy one to boot, but Steve didn't really care. He'd been accused of being ridiculously old fashioned and far too nice. Tony needed a little of both from time to time. "So we talked about a vacation. Where exactly do billionaire playboys go on a romantic vacation? And if you start telling me about all the girls you took someplace, you're gonna be surprised how fast I forget you have stitches and push you out of bed."
"I don't think I can handle you two," Tony muttered under his breath as if Fitz-Simmons couldn't hear him. He stared at them for a moment the same way he'd stare at an engineering problem. "Alright, fine. Still. Look at the arc reactor. Maybe you can figure it out and build one to go on the prototype. Just watch out for Romanov. Ever see Jurassic Park? She's like the raptor. Distracts you while Barton gets you sighted in."
Coulson sighed. Leave it to Clint to undo half the goodwill they'd engendered in the space of a few seconds. "It's not an unfair statement," he allowed, "but that doesn't change the fact that right now we're representing a lot more than just the government. We're representing a hope for humanity - all of humanity - to get Loki off of our collective backs. Logan got back safe. We found Scott. We're doing everything we can to show you that we're on your side, Professor."
“Oddly enough, it does. But maybe that’s because you’ve always been a little crazy,” Steve observed with a chuckle. “A buzz doesn’t sound so bad. Unfortunately the whole enhanced metabolism thing means I can’t get one. I could down a bottle of whiskey and…” Steve made a gesture of negation with his hand. “Not in the cards. I’m guessing it probably isn’t for you either until Bruce is sure you’re clean. Since we don’t know everything they gave you, it’s hard to know if alcohol would interact badly.” He could almost feel Bucky’s eyes glazing over and ducked his head. “Sorry. Doing the team leader thing.”
Having only dimly registered the man's presence before, Steve opened his eyes again and tried hard to believe that he could possibly be needed in his current state. He tried to picture a way he could actually help SHIELD when he felt like such a mess. He nodded again and wished like hell he could tear the oxygen mask away and still breathe. He wanted to talk. He wanted to grab Tony and pull the man close. At the same time, he was terrified for Tony to touch or see too much, to feel the man recoil.
Tony tensed, his hand rising reflexively as if to push the god away, but instead his fingers rested lightly on the soft fabric of Loki's shirt. It wasn't bad. At all. In fact, it was kind of good, which just wound Tony a little tighter. His fingers curled into the green cloth beneath them, and even Tony wasn't sure if it was to hold Loki in place or push him away, but he did neither, instead hanging on for dear life... or perhaps sanity. His mouth finally yielded to the contact, letting the tongue dragging across his lips dip into his mouth and gently sucking on it.
Fury settled back into his chair, staring hard at Tony for longer than he was entirely comfortable with. "We're getting some indications that Loki may be on the move," he finally said, apparently having decided that an ass-chewing wasn't going to help the situation for anyone. "We expect him to poke his head out somewhere nearby soon. Let's hope this raygun of yours works."
Tony, having abandoned his wheelchair not long after Steve had left, was leaning against a table a little more heavily than he should have needed to. While he definitely hadn't torn anything open, he'd definitely proven to himself that he wasn't ready to tear around the lab on foot. "Well," he said, swallowing a couple of pain pills sans water, "the hammer's freaky."
"Hey, Shred-head," Tony sneered, aiming his glowing palm at Creed. The black-clad man paused for a second, and Tony got a good look at the claws that had nearly ended up in his spleen. He did his best to look like he didn't feel like the aforementioned organ was about to fall out, but his posture was slightly hunched forward and pained, nonetheless. "Look like you could stand to be declawed, kitten." A flash in the distance and scuffle of comms chatter that followed as Coulson reported what had happened distracted Tony long enough for Creed to launch himself at Tony. Iron Man got his wits about him quickly enough to catch Creed's shirt and leg throw the man over his head.
It didn't take much of Tony's incredible intellect to figure out what Logan meant. He grinned again and settled in front of the blonde, his hand tangling in Steve's hair to guide him closer to his waiting cock. He was anxious to see those beautiful lips wrapped around his aching length.
"Good philosophy," Tony murmured, grinning faintly. His hand slid into Steve's pants, tracing the outline of the man's burgeoning erection before slipping into his underwear and giving the length a firm stroke. His own arousal spiked and was simultaneously forgotten in the face of thinking about how good Steve was going to look when Tony finally got around to sucking him off. "Now... I'm trying to remember... What was it we had plans to do right now?" He knew he was being a complete tease, but Steve made an easy and adorable target.
Logan looked up at Steve suddenly as it occurred to him that Thor had no clue about the fact that Tony's relationship with Pepper had definitely shifted some time ago. //Well, this is awkward.// Logan wasn't about to spill the beans. He was pretty sure that was the kind of operation only a brain surgeon should undertake, and the feral mutant was pretty sure he was more on par with a two-bit butcher.
Clint was fiddling with the hammer as they walked, aching to bring it down in the middle of Loki's back. He refrained, though. Mostly because Phil had told him not to. He was half praying for the Asgardian to give him a reason to disobey.
Logan shrugged. "I'm not picky, long as there's somewhere horizontal to sleep and a shower. TV couldn't hurt, either."
Logan nodded, but couldn't help quirk a faint smile at the mental scenario Scott conjured. He pulled the man close, giving him a quick peck on the lips, as much as he dared. "I'll be... They'll get it figured out before you know it," he promised, hoping he was telling the truth. He opened his mouth to add something, then stifled it. Dropping dramatic talk of love right before he got himself locked up just seemed more cruel than loving. "I'll make sure they let you know when you can come." He reluctantly let Scott go, straightening his clothes a little better before stepping out into the hallway.
Natasha snorted and broke the momentary tension. "No offense, Logan, but I'm half tempted to take him up on that even if filling out SHIELD paperwork for hours on end can make your eyes bleed."
"Oh..." It made a lot more sense when he thought of the whole thing in those terms. Loki wasn't a petulant child acting out at a family who hadn't given him the attention he wanted: he was a spurned lover whose heart had been shattered. Add in the family drama, and it wasn't difficult to see where he'd started down the wrong path. Steve sighed and felt the first creeping notes of sympathy winding through him. "Makes it harder than I'd like to hate the guy. Right now it would be a whole lot easier to hate him. It's hard to believe Thor would be so cold."
"Don't worry, he isn't mine. Not always. We don't have that kind of arrangement." Nat crossed the room and smirked at Clint before grabbing him by the back of the neck and hauling him into a punishing kiss. "I know how to share."
Tony heaved a long-suffering sigh and rolled his eyes. "Magnets won't erase my hard drive. Or the rest of me. And speaking of self-healing, I need someone with bio-whosit knowledge to figure out a way to make sure these nanobots can put me back together in the event of an accident or me being forced to play with guns that want to kill me. Bruce?"
Clint had to focus with all his might to keep from choking horribly on his popcorn. He held up a hand while he dragged the end table trash can over and coughed a half-chewed mouthful of food into it. Tears in his eyes from the ordeal, he looked up at Nat, eyes wide and brow furrowed. "Okay, h-how do you know," he cleared his throat, "How do you know he's... 'Cause, I mean, I might've noticed under circumstances I'm keeping to myself, but..."
Steve again found his skin crawling at how strange and uncomfortable it all was. The media would want Tony there to prove that it hadn't been some stupid, drunken mistake that was tearing the team apart the morning after. The media wanted him there to prove it was something more, and that was all the more awkward since Steve had no idea whether it was or not. "It's okay if you don't want to," he assured softy.
Clint had to actually chuckle at that. He had to give Phil credit: it was tough to fluster the guy. He went behind the counter and found the case of stout, taking one and breaking the cap off on the counter. "Well, wouldn't wanna piss Fury off by breaking his new toys, right?"
Clint let himself get caught up in the contact, nearly forgetting Nat was there even as his hand tightened on her waist a little. His tongue cautiously worked its way into Phil's mouth, exploring gently as he felt his skin flush. He actually whimpered softly before he realized just how much he was enjoying the contact, then drew away a little guiltily, eyes searching Phil's face. He knew it was delicate for them both, and he didn't want Phil to feel pressured or worse to bring up the trauma they'd both just endured.
"Variety is the spice of life. Maybe we could get a bear skin rug to fall asleep on. I hear those are cozy," Tony quipped, sighing contentedly as Steve snuggled in close. "Maybe that could go with the whole Colorado cabin thing." He yawned widely, remembering that his compulsive rambling was probably not the most romantic thing ever. He lightly tousled Steve's damp hair and smiled at him fondly. "Either way, really, long as I get to cuddle you."
"Pixar." Logan repeated the word as of trying to get his head around one of the deadliest agents in SHIELD watching cartoons. He tugged Scott to the couch and settled him in, then turned to the DVD collection. He grabbed the copy of Finding Nemo and tossed it into the player before settling beside the other man with a smile. "I guess it makes sense. They're kinda trauma-proof."
Bruce edged quietly into the room, sensing the tension and trying to keep his own under wraps. Nobody had debriefed them when they got back. They all knew it had gone terribly, all knew that things were ugly. They didn't need to be told. He settled on the other side of Steve, wondering if Steve looked ready to run for any particular reason or if it was just the general situation. "Uh... evening, everyone," he said quietly, getting nothing but a stare from Fury for his efforts.
"Wait, you have a personal... anything? I kinda figured you only took that getup off to shower or..." Logan's eyes flicked to Scott before he could stop himself. It was brief, microscopic, but Logan couldn't help but kick himself. //Let's just alienate everyone while we're at it. There's probably something stupid you could say to Nat too.//
Mystique wasn't in the habit of taking orders from people who were on the other side, but given the havoc the Hulk was wreaking and the sort of things SHIELD kept in the room... "Victor, peel yourself off the floor and follow us. No one's going to carry you." She didn't bother saying anything at all to Pyro. Allerdyce was on his own. She still wondered why Magneto kept the boy around most days. He could barely even hold his own against Bobby Drake, and John should have known the boy's every move.
"Once or twice." Steve groaned and took a deep breath. "How long does it take normal people to heal again? Because we need to work on that." He knew in the end that any time they spent waiting would only make the first time after Tony got back to normal better, but less intellectually Steve also suspected he would have the world's worst case of blue balls by then.
Scott didn't bother replying. He agreed with the sentiment, harsh as it was, and he frankly didn't want to think anymore about it. He wanted to snuggle up to Logan, watch the movie, and pretend that the outside world wasn't even there. Slowly the day began to fall from his shoulders. Tony was safe. Loki was being watched by Thor. Creed was in lock up. At least relatively speaking, they were safe. Scott closed his eyes to enjoy that thought. When he opened them, Scott felt better. He slumped bonelessly against Logan and let his arms wrap comfortably around the man's waist. For the moment the two of them were the only thing that really mattered.
"I can handle myself." Bruce said mildly as he moved out of the room, stopping to stand well within Tony's space. "But one more mention of the shit you've been texting me about, and I'll let the other guy explain how I mean it when I say I'm not helping."
Clint had already fallen in to follow Coulson back upstairs, but one of the junior agents - a guy in his twenties who looked like he'd used an entire bottle of hair gel that morning - hustled over to catch up with the senior agent. "Sir... Director Fury's orders said that Barton could be admitted to the cell block under your escort."
Victor shrugged. "He doesn't want SHIELD on his lawn. Can't say I blame him. He just wants you out of his house. I'm sure the two of you've had some survival training. You'll be fine. Or, y'know, die of exposure," he said with a smirk. He glanced at Clint, who stared back, trying to be defiant. "Don't forget me, pretty. I won't forget you for awhile."
"Too bad. We're not feeling quite so generous," Steve answered, tone gone flat to keep from shouting. "This is a long way past a peaceful resolution."
After putting up with more fangirling from the hostess, Logan managed to convince her to hide them in a corner of the restaurant. "Last thing I need is a buncha kids to see ya," Logan pointed out as he looked over the menu. He didn't have a huge aversion to kids per se, but the idea of trying to peacefully enjoy a beer while a bunch of screaming rugrats crawled all over Steve like he was a jungle gym and asked weird kid questions just sounded like a kind of pain he wasn't willing to put up with.
Steve's gaze trailed down to the hammer. It had saved Clint. It could save them all. He shuddered to think of what it might have done in Loki's hands. "He's not going to give up on having it this easily."
Victor smirked as he heard Clint settle back to the floor. "Got him trained, haven't you?" he murmured, shoving Phil's pants and boxers down to his knees. He heard Clint shift again, and his face darkened. "You know, I don't like the feeling I'm going to get interrupted." He stepped back, then pressed Phil more firmly against the wall again. "Stay."
Phil nodded his agreement with the assessment. It made sense. He wanted to just be done and home and finally fucking shower, but Clint was right. Completely right. Phil took a deep breath and let himself marvel at how rarely Clint was the sensible one as they settled onto the rocky ground. He winced but actually felt a little better leaning into Clint's side. "I think it's fair to say my judgment is suspect at the moment. Possibly terrible." He let his head fall against Clint's shoulder with a sigh. "Maybe that whole rest thing isn't such an awful idea."
"Lord Fury, there are... we have ways on Asgard of limiting his sorcery, should you wish it. And I am willing to stay here until you feel he can be trusted," Thor offered. He hadn't really thought that one through, but it seemed like a good idea. They couldn't leave the hammer in Clint's hands, and Thor knew that, aside from the unpredictable Hulk, only another Asgardian would have any chance of standing toe to toe with Loki.
Scott's breath caught, and the whine he let out was entirely undignified. They had to calm down a little or they'd be rubbing each other off on a bench, and that wasn't something he wanted on his rap sheet. "We need to take it down a notch. Maybe take it home, actually? I... that whole going slow thing is sounding lame. Really lame. And stupid. Did I mention how stupid that sounds?" Scott licked his lips and then found Logan's and kissed him soundly instead. "What do you say? Back to your room? You'll probably spend all day in meetings tomorrow. Might as well have something fun to think about while you're in there."
He wasn't quite sure how he'd come to the decision, where he'd gotten the idea, but not long after, Clint found himself standing outside Phil's door, pressing the call button. "It's me," he mumbled into the mic. Realizing that wasn't terribly specific, he added, "Clint." He felt dumb, standing in the hallway barefoot and in a t-shirt and underwear. He wasn't quite sure how he was going to explain himself, coming to ask to sleep in someone else's room like a five year old because of a little nightmare. //Well, already here...//
Accustomed to leading questions like these, Tony looked relatively calm, but he had no doubt that Steve was getting wound up tight. He very deliberately put an arm around the taller man's waist and squeezed gently. He felt sorry for Steve, and felt a bit of regret about the whole thing to begin with. Tony had known quite well that people would likely be snapping photos and getting video of them; the thought probably hadn't even crossed Steve's mind.
Hulk scowled at Natasha, looking for a moment as if he was ready to turn his rage against her, but seeing Scott and Logan blasting away at the god gave him a reason to grin. As Loki tried to recover from the attacks, Hulk reached for the god, intent on giving him another solid thumping.
"That's the spirit!" Tony said, giving Logan a hearty slap on the back. He grinned when Logan gave him a death stare. "We can all have near-death experiences together. I, for one, never get enough."
Steve rolled his eyes but gathered his meds into a bag and climbed out of bed and into the chair. He still felt shaky and strange, but Steve knew that might be how much weaker he felt overall. It was hard to get a bead on normal when his whole world and body felt so far from it. "Maybe the chair isn't a terrible idea," he allowed. The sooner he was back up in Tony's room, the better he knew he'd feel. "Let's get upstairs. Please?"
Steve's throat felt too tight to speak even without the mask in the way. He managed a short nod and shivered. He wanted so badly to believe, but he didn't know if he could. It was one thing trying to believe that Tony loved him - that had felt like a little miracle, and he'd clung to it desperately. Trying to believe that Tony loved him and didn't care that he was suddenly attached to a guy who'd be hard pressed to lift a large bag of flour was something else. Finally he couldn't take it anymore and grabbed the mask, moving it aside and taking an uncertain breath that didn't hurt as much as he'd expected it too. "I'm sorry," he managed, voice rough from tears and his dry throat. "I'm sorry, Tony."
"I shall accompany you, as well. It is only just," Thor said, following the three. He wanted a chance to speak for Loki also, though he kept that to himself.
Phil laughed aloud at that and hugged Clint a little tighter. "You're right. I... it isn't the decision I'd make today," Phil answered, "and not just because of us. I'm not ready to be over-share guy like Tony, but I think that it's safe to say I haven't done anybody any favors holding back so much." He stretched up to kiss Clint's cheek and couldn't resist nuzzling into his neck while he was there. Maybe it was a little silly, but he liked it. "I don't want the people who I'm closest to to not even know me."
Clint gave Phil a quick peck on the cheek. "Donuts and movies," he echoed as he released his safety harness and stood. His hand wrapped around the hammer's handle, and an odd smile touched his lips as he stalked toward the rear of the plane. "Let's go break some heads."
Clint looked at the lake one last time. The clouds seemed darker, the water less soothing, the whole scene less vibrant. The archer knew it was his imagination. He frowned faintly. They'd been enjoying themselves. //Reality rears its ugly head,// he thought, reminding himself that he'd chosen his life with SHIELD, and that he had friends and teammates that needed him as much as he needed them. //Guess it could be a way worse reality.// He glanced at Coulson as he stood effortlessly, holding a hand out. "C'mon. Let's go unfuck this mess," he said decisively, feeling more himself. "Then I'm coming back here and feeding some goddamn ducks."
Loki remained pointedly quiet, for once waiting until he was addressed to speak. Faced with the reality of trying to explain anything he'd done, he felt sick with sudden fear. He could envision no way for Fury and the others to ever accept his hope of becoming their ally instead of their adversary. It was madness to think otherwise.// And perhaps I am as mad as they say…//
"You don't have to, idiot," Natasha answered mildly. She reached across Clint's body and felt Phil's fingers curl around hers. Her head settled in against Clint's shoulder, and the three of them sat together in silence for a few moments. It was soothing, a tangible reminder that they were safe. They weren't alone.
"Just a coupl'a tourists here to enjoy the sights?" Logan growled as Tony managed to gesture and speak slowly enough to get a drink out of the bartender. The dark-headed one looked familiar. //Some big ticket playboy...// Logan reached for his whiskey and gulped it down before gesturing for another, not bothering to look at his visitors anymore.
Scott just nodded in return. It wasn't like Logan needed further incentive or consent. They both wanted the same thing, both needed the reminder that they were alive and well. He'd spent a lot of time doing what was considered right. It was time to do something that felt good instead. "Let's make it to the bed first, though, huh? Not all of us are pros despite how you found me."
Bucky considered that for a moment. It was difficult to hand out free advice when his feelings on the subject were so conflicted. What he wanted to do was press home a small advantage, somehow convince Steve that he did not need Tony Stark, but that wasn't going to make Steve happy. "Well," he started, "you've got two options; either force your way in to see him, or I could find a way to lure him out. Arrange for you two to meet. Lock you together in a room so he can't run away."
Logan frowned, feeling a stab of sympathy for the other man. It had to suck to think the one set of people you thought of as family hadn't made the effort to see how you were doing, especially when one of those people was your fiance. "So you're not on such great terms, then?" Scott had made it clear he'd been uncomfortable at the mansion, but Logan wouldn't have expected the amount of bitterness he was seeing. Chuck would check on anyone who'd left. Xavier had already decided that every mutant in the world was his problem, whether they wanted to be or not.
Tony did not have to think twice about the suggestion. "I'd love that," he enthused, flashing Steve a warm smile. "I'm afraid cooking from scratch is one of the few things outside the scope of my genius, so you'll have to make another fantastic meal. Or we can always order in." Either way Tony would be content in Steve's company. He felt a sense of relief wash over him that the evening had gone so well. Indeed, he and Steve had already made a second date and the night wasn't even over yet. Tony knew that the other man was being cautious due to his current state, and the billionaire appreciated Steve more for his kindness.
"So do you," Loki returned quietly. He could feel the tension and unease in Tony, the trembling and the taut muscles. "You seem tense... I'm sure I can help with that." Loki reached a hand up to carefully massage the muscles of Tony's neck, urging him to roll onto his stomach so that he could focus on the contact. Normally being a masseuse for a prisoner wouldn't have been on the menu, but the situation was interesting. The potential was interesting. "Just lie back and let me make you feel good."
"I'm... fine," Bruce grated out in a voice slightly deeper than normal as he slowly straightened up, looking reasonably calm.
Eyes focused on one razor-sharp tines, Tony kept his hands up like he was being held at gunpoint. "I see your points," he said, doing a valiant job of not looking as nervous as he felt. "But we were thinking less in the realm of stabbing kids... or me... in the face, and more along the lines of demi-gods. And I think the Cap can confirm that I've been pretty good at making sure we all know what we're in for. Not big on secrets, great at hacking. It all works out." His eyes drifted to Steve, barely able to see the man behind Logan's hulking form. //Granted, SHIELD's kept me out of their systems for a couple of months now, but Jarvis'll fix that eventually.//
"Sore. But well enough to leave," Tony added petulantly. "Also bored. And a little concerned. I can't for the life of me remember what it was about Logan, but I feel like we should be pretty worried. Did he say whether Loki did anything to him? Weird beverages? Strange sex rituals? Questionably shiny apples?"
"I was still working on that one when the call came, boss," Clint said with a faint smile. He did his best not to think about what was going to happen when Creed came back. He couldn't decide if it was more terrifying knowing that he was at the top of the menu or that Phil would have to witness it. Trying to keep his nervousness in check, Clint sighed quietly. "You think we should try to sleep? I mean, not that I like the idea of him sneaking up on us, but I think we'll be better off if we're rested."
Steve’s breath caught. He froze for a moment in shock. He hadn’t been sure that Tony would say yes, and after that he’d been even less sure about what move to make and how to proceed. As usual Tony had taken the guesswork out of things by manhandling the situation to suit himself. For once that was a definite asset. Steve let out a shaky breath and melted into the kiss. It was sweet and almost chaste, and Steve was grateful for that, not eager to be out of his depth too soon and show off precisely how out of practice he was in the art of romance.
"Barton, what, exactly, do you think you're going to do against the two of them?" the Director wanted to know. He jerked a thumb to the looped video of Scott using his powers. "One of them could kill you, nevermind both."
Steve stood and managed to look not in the slightest bit intimidating. He still squared his shoulders and put a hand on Tony's chest. "That's enough. Your project is Loki. We did this to fix what he broke. Now we do this so that he doesn't break anyone else." He met Tony's gaze and waited until his lover looked away before he turned his gaze to Bruce. "Anything else we worry about another time and in less stressful circumstances. I’m not going to drop dead in the interim so long as I keep my inhaler in my pocket," Steve added with a rueful smile
"If anything I know fixes what happened to him, it's on the table. That's why the team knows about Thor's involvement - or lack thereof. It's why you know. Now get the hell out of here and stop trying to know things you don't really want to know. That part's an order." Fury leaned in a little and added, "And as a friend, Phil? Stop trying to see shit you don't really want to see."
The words were pretty intense coming from Tony, and Steve accepted them with the same gravity. "I'm glad to hear it." He laced their fingers together. "You don't ever have to say things like that if it isn't comfortable, but just so you know, it's amazing to hear it." He could tell what Tony felt. Knowing the man cared enough to make himself say it made Steve's heart swell.
"We will," Tony agreed, emphasizing the first word. "I'm itching to... get my hands on... whoever did this." It took a lot to get Tony Stark angry. He usually handled an intense situation with a cutting quip or outwitting his adversaries. An unseen assailant with an unknown motive was something different. If he had the strength to crawl into his Iron Man suit, Tony would have done so the minute Steve had lifted the chandelier from his body. "Don't go... out on your... own," he wheezed a warning to Steve. "I'm not... getting left behind..."
"Who the hell wouldn't wanna watch?" he asked, then remembered Scott was right next to him. "So you two and Coulson haven't had a game o' round robin, then? Kinda surprised, actually," Logan admitted.
"Uncertain. SHIELD hasn't encountered enough Asgardian tech to be sure." Coulson wished that weren't the case. Weapons forged in Loki's own dimension would definitely help. "Right now I'm satisfying myself thinking of creative ways to remove his internal organs with a dull spoon."
"My priorities are... shifting," Loki allowed carefully. He was walking a thin line, and being honest with Stark was more difficult than he'd anticipated. The lies had become an armor of sorts. Going without them was almost physically painful. "I think it's becoming painfully clear that whether I deserve to rule or not, my brother is the only one who will ever sit upon a throne. What I want, Mr. Stark," he grated out, "is to stop running. I'd like to enjoy myself even if it means following a rule or two this time. To put it simply: I'm tired. I'd thought that this... the Brotherhood and the borrowed technology, that it would... but it doesn't make a difference, does it?"
Coulson met Hank's gaze and offered, "There are people even SHIELD isn't sure how to deal with. This is where they usually end up. It's... safer. More secure." He didn't bother to say whether it was safer for the prisoners or the world. "The armory's this way. If the hammer's here, that's where it will be."
Phil had been tracing shapes on Clint's thighs with his fingers while the man spoke, and when Clint finally stopped, he shared a small smile with him. "I'm sorry that it took so long, but I'm glad you found a place where you felt safe, comfortable." He'd known from Clint's file that his upbringing wasn't the best, but he'd never known that specific detail. "You, just the way you are, is beautiful. Wouldn't change a thing." He cupped Clint's cheek and drew him down into a soft, lingering kiss. "Wish I could have seen you in the circus, actually. I bet that was a hell of a show."
Natasha couldn't help but hold on just as tight. She could handle anything if she needed to, suffer through any rough patches. Having her whole self pawed through artlessly, having Loki inside her head, had been one of the most horrifying things she'd ever felt. It was good to be home, to be safe, to have Clint's strong arms wrapped around her and know that he understood without needing to say anything. He understood better than anyone else in the world, and even if he hadn't, she wouldn't have needed to explain herself. He didn't require it. "It’s good to be home."
"Looks great," Clint answered earnestly. He hadn't realized the impact his teasing had had. The archer eagerly gathered a plate of food and dug in, his eyebrows raising in pleasant surprise. "This is amazing, Coulson," he declared around a mouthful. "Where'd you learn to cook like this, anyway? I mean, I know you've been doing this awhile, but... damn."
Logan noticed the nurse as well and couldn't help wonder if she was actually another agent or spy or... "Yeah, I think that'd be best," he agreed, leading the way. It was a short, tense walk. The minute they stepped into the room, Logan shook his head. "Scott, I know you're used to doin' everything above-board, but this place... These people are spies. This ain't Chuck's school. They're government, and don't forget that the government's been within a few steps o' roundin' us all up and puttin' us in concentration camps."
"Then we will destroy them and retrieve our friend," Thor said as if it were the simplest thing in the world. Having never been one to wait around, the thunder god was ready to take action. As the images on the screen progressed, it was abundantly clear what Tony's torturer intended to do. Thor grasped Steve's arm and started to pull the other man away. "Watching will do no good," he said with a surprisingly gentle tone. "Instead, we should make ourselves ready."
"I do, don't I?" Tony said, returning Steve's smile with one of his own. Without thinking twice about it, he reached out and touched Steve's hand. The gesture was more intimate than any Tony had offered before. He watched Steve carefully, gauging the other man's reaction. "There's nothing to be sorry about. You didn't do anything wrong. The heart wants what the heart wants." Tony glanced down at the glowing energy emanating from his chest, shrugged and sighed, "Only I've got this in the middle of my chest, and it pretty much dictates everything."
The woman sent a sad smile in Logan's direction. "Which one?" She shook her head before any of them could answer. "Thor is enchanted. I may be able to lift the spell. They have kept us apart, and I doubt they would have bothered was the spell not vulnerable to my magic. The guards are loyal, perhaps to a fault. They have followed my son without once asking why he has been acting so little like himself."
Half surprised himself by the realization, Scott nodded, "I'm doing good." No one in the place knew them, and it was a pleasant thing to be temporarily free of preconceptions. "The change of scenery is helping." He perused the menu and ventured, "Even if I end up joining up with SHIELD officially, I might see about a place of my own. Somewhere close," Scott assured, "but I've never had my own space."
Clint shuddered as he felt Victor's hot breath against his neck, his fingers digging into the hard, rough floor of the cell. He tried to keep his expression neutral as he watched Phil, but he could barely hear anything over the blood rushing in his ears. He remembered feeling Loki pressed against him in a similar way, the god looming behind him as he gave himself freely... Something warm and wet against his wounds jolted Clint out of the memory only to draw a shudder of revulsion from him as he realized Victor was licking the blood from his back. Clint couldn't hide the panic he felt, not anymore. "Please... don't..." he rasped, squirming helplessly under the hulking mutant.
"It would be more therapeutic," Steve agreed. He held onto Tony as tightly as he dared. After days of having the man in the hospital and not being able to really be wrapped up with him, it was heaven. Even with his worry over Natasha, even with Loki possibly on his way to a dangerous artifact, Steve felt blissful. He closed his eyes and sighed out a breath. "You're right - this is definitely more like it. I really didn't like sleeping without you."
"I think I can handle a snake. And then we'd have food," Clint pointed out, smiling a little as he noticed Phil relaxing. He shifted around until he'd wallowed out a decent, cool pit in the ground, then laid back. He tugged at Coulson until his handler relaxed and settled against him. It was a little uncomfortably warm, but he knew they'd get cool quickly in the shade. That, and he needed the reassurance of contact while he slept.
Steve swallowed and wondered exactly why he'd suggested slowing things down. It was hard to think about slow when Tony's dark eyes were promising a whole lot of things that involved going very, very fast. He barely noticed the waiter looking uneasy and hurrying away to get their bill. It was hard to keep himself in place in his seat and not drag Tony across the table to kiss him instead. They'd done more than enough damage by being inappropriate in public, though, and even if Tony didn't care, Steve did. He settled for rubbing his thumb across Tony's wrist. "I think dessert at home sounds absolutely perfect."
Steve had gratefully let Coulson take point on updating Fury while he followed Tony down to medical. Being a leader meant sacrifices, but he needed to know that Tony really was fine and that no important organs were punctured, that too much blood hadn't been lost. He hovered like a mother hen waiting for the doctors to give his lover a proper once over.
Scott hated the silence of the room as he carefully spilled the whole experience out. It hurt. He hated thinking about what he'd seen and what he'd done just to get by. Most of the time he'd just taken the beatings when he had to, but there had been times... Scott wasn't used to giving up or giving in, but he had done both on numerous occasions. By the time he finished, his back was cramped from sitting so still in the chair, and his eyes ached from staring at the screen. He didn't even bother re-reading any of the report before mailing it to the address Logan had given to him.
Logan had to grin as he watched Steve turn all the shades of red in the book, but he had the decency to not make it worse by commenting. His instincts about Steve's interest in Stark definitely seemed to be proving true. //Wonder how Tony managed to sneak all those guys past blondie. Or maybe 'why' would be a better question.// Stark didn't seem like the type to be unselfish. He was narcissistic, brilliant, self-destructive, an asshole, and nothing about him said 'considerate'.
Scott shuddered, turned on more than he knew he could be by something as simple as hearing those words from Logan. "Need you too... fuck, Logan..." The man was running from his memories, but it was still flattering to some degree being the one Logan chose to run to. He swallowed hard and let a hand run over Logan's stubbled cheek and into his unruly hair. "Do it." He knew it was likely to hurt after the night before and given that they weren't exactly bothering to stop for a tube of lubricant, but there were worse things than a little hit of discomfort when it came to getting off. He was still at least a little slick from the night before. More than that, he damn well didn’t want to stop.
"Right, yeah," Steve agreed, feeling almost drunk himself although he hadn't even bothered attempting to drink alcohol on their excursion. When he saw the tight set of Logan's jaw and the way the man was pointedly looking away from them, he felt a rush of guilt. They'd all gone out together and Tony had started out as the third wheel. He knew very well exactly how awkward their circumstances had become thanks to the impromptu makeout session. "Hey, you about ready to get out of here?" Steve greeted Logan with an apologetic smile.
Tony nodded. "Yeah. They've already got my suit loaded up. They want us to go out in civvies though, only resort to 'avenging' if he gets angry." He adjusted the alignment bracelets around his wrists for the Mark VII suit, then paused and looked at a grainy, blurry film of Logan springing out of some sort of tank of water, shrugging off a bullet wound to the forehead and then proceeding to tear through what looked like some otherwise very competent men like they were children. "Then again, if he gets angry, we may not have time to put our faces on. Guess we better hope he takes peace offerings." Tony scooped up a box of Cuban cigars that he'd dug out of his own stash after reading Logan's file. //Here's hoping he appreciates nice things.// "Let's go."
"So I should get the saddle and bridle out of the closet," Logan dead panned, but he was only able to keep a straight face for a half second. He grinned faintly. "Alright, deal." He gathered Scott close and buried his face in the man's hair. "Love you."
"I don't think I've got that kind of following," he answered, "though I should've taken a picture of you feeding the ducks. That would have gotten a few notes." When Clint shrugged it off, Coulson shook his head in return. It was amusing to realize that Clint had no idea what people thought about him. Maybe he didn't have the droves of fans that Cap or Iron Man did, but he was notorious in his own right. "You've saved a lot of lives, and after the Chitauri, people noticed. You're a hero too even if you don't think of yourself that way." He liked sitting there on a cloudy day with Clint next to the pond. Coulson looped his arms over his knees and watched the ducks fighting over the food, more eager than vicious.
In which the science team sciences things with varying degrees of success, and Plan B sounds terrible.
Tony groaned and groused for a moment before pushing himself up off the floor. "I did lock it. Coulson has access to everything, damn him. Remind me why I had security cameras put all over the place here?" he grouched, zipping up and raking a hand through his hair. "Then again, I'm sure SHIELD would've corrected the oversight if I hadn't..." He tousled Steve's hair and offered him a hand up. "Didn't take them long to point the shred-o-matic at someone they didn't like, hm?" Tony got distracted staring at Steve’s kiss-bruised mouth before either of them got to give more thought to Logan’s assignment. He pressed a quick kiss to Steve's mouth. The man was magnetic, tempting with his disheveled look. "Mm... I could bend you over that table and-"
"Sounds good," Scott agreed. "All the essentials." He watched Logan drinking and realized how much he was enjoying just sitting with the man and eating greasy food and enjoying a good, cheap beer. Maybe they didn’t deserve the reprieve in the midst of the chaos, but they needed it. "When I start looking - if I start looking - would you come with me?" They wouldn't be getting a place together exactly, but Scott wanted Logan to feel at home wherever he was. He wanted the man to be part of any changes that he made in his life.
"I mean do whatever I ask, do it without question. You'll be everything to me that Barton was, except you won't have the luxury of knowing that you had no control. I gave him that gift. He's returned the favor rather poorly, which is why he's in his current predicament," Loki explained, his gaze fixed on Tony's face even though the man couldn't see him properly. "I may ask you to give me information or make me a cup of tea. I may ask you to get down on your knees and service me... or some of my dear new friends. Do you think that your pride can handle that, Mr. Stark? For their lives, can you truly and willingly submit?"
Steve wasn't quite so sure about that. He was fairly certain that the greatest danger when it came to Loki was from his words not his actions, but he sighed heavily. It was a big decision. It was a terrible decision. He could turn away a man who by all appearances genuinely needed and wanted a second chance, or he could give him a death sentence. From the sound of things, Loki wasn't particularly interested in the idea of a life without purpose, and that twanged more than a few warnings signals along the way for Steve. He finally turned to Tony. "I need to know if you really think this is something that could work. You heard more than we have, and I won't ask you to tell me, but with what you know... can this work? Can we trust him?"
"I said it was my place to get away. Maybe I wasn't sure I wanted to get away with you yet," Phil countered, though his smile said that it was mostly a joke. "Honestly, I guess I never thought sitting around chatting in a coffee shop with your handler would be on your to do list." Most of the time Clint spent his time haunting rough bars or staying in with Natasha from what Phil could tell. "You'd think I would have learned by now that making assumptions is a stupid thing to do."
Expression carefully neutral, Phil nodded. "Everyone's been under surveillance at one time or another." He hesitated before adding, "I requested that I be the only agent to watch you and Agent Romanov. After what happened with Loki, if something was going to be wrong, we've been working together for a long time. I would have seen it." He had been worried about the duty in a way, had almost handed it off to someone else. If anything had been wrong with Clint or there had been any lingering effects, Coulson wasn't sure he could have turned him in anyway. In that way he sympathized with how Scott had to feel sorting through any potential danger from Logan. "My reports were thorough in the ways that they needed to be." Phil smiled faintly. "SHIELD doesn't need to know everything."
Tony smiled, tangling his fingers with Steve's and bringing the blonde's hand to his mouth for a kiss. "I was a little scared, too. I'm not anymore," he said, dark eyes fixed on bright blue. "You feel different, but you're still you. We're still us. You still drive me crazy, and I still love you," he said, meaning every word of it. He'd be lying to pretend that things hadn't changed a bit. But the important things hadn't. He leaned in to press his lips to Steve's for a long, slow kiss, drawing away and pressing their foreheads together. "You're totally worth the brain damage."
Once the SUV was parked, Logan casually sauntered around to where Scott was disembarking and immediately dragged his lover into a deep, sensual kiss, then glanced at Nat as she got out. "So, your place or ours?"
Logan grabbed Scott's ass and pulled their hips together suggestively before kissing him and letting go. "Then go watch your boring computer training so it can be over sooner and I can fuck your brains out without feeling guilty or somethin'," Logan directed, grinning. "Besides, last I heard, there were parts o' you that needed a rest."
"You're back!" Simmons' voice was elated, and Natasha registered quickly that she was too happy for the news to only be that. The girl obviously had a thing for Bruce, but that wasn't enough to have her grinning like an idiot and waving her hands at them as she hurried out of the building at a fast clip with Fitz on her heels. "Sorry, I know you probably all need- oh, but it's wonderful news!"
Logan fell to immediately on receiving his orders and moved to pick Victor up. With the adamantium skeleton, Victor's dead weight was too much, though, for Logan to simply scoop up. "Little help?" he asked, eyes fixed on Clint as the most obvious choice.
Steve opened his mouth to answer, but a nurse held up a hand. "Not now. We need to get Mr. Stark in for an X-Ray. If you'll please wait for us here?" The woman's tone was polite but firm as she gestured to the waiting room.
Steve's emotions rolled from fury that Loki would pose as him to disbelief that Tony had continued on even knowing to anger again that Loki had threatened his lover's life. When Tony confessed that he'd been with Loki even knowing that he didn't have to be and knowing exactly who he was with, Steve felt his heart stop for a second. Somehow the combination of hearing the words and seeing the guilt on Tony's face combined to leave Steve utterly terrified. They hadn't been together long. He knew that. So it wasn't crazy for Tony to... Steve tried to stop the train of thought, but the seed had already been planted, and he had to swallow several times around the lump in his throat before he could speak again. It would at least explain why Tony was suddenly so eager to have Loki on the team. "And now? Do you... is... I can go," he murmured, feeling sick all over again at the idea of going back to his room alone. "We don't have to do this just because... you don't owe me anything, Tony."
Logan nodded. He hadn't missed the slight shift in Steve's demeanor at his suggestion of rest. He didn't know exactly what it meant, but he knew enough to know that he and Sif needed to give the blonde a moment. "Take your time," he agreed, gesturing to Sif to follow him.
Steve flushed as he almost always did when Tony tossed out such casual compliments. Steve knew that the man did it just to get a rise out of him - or at least assumed he did. The truth was that they couldn't work together romantically. They were too different. They only barely made sense as friends. Steve tried to keep the conflicting feelings of relief and guilt and worry off his face as he said sincerely, "I'm sorry, Tony." He was. Mostly. Part of him rejoiced at the thought that Tony was free, but most of him just felt bad that Tony and Pepper might be calling it quits when they'd seemed to make one another so happy. Still he let his face soften into a smile. "But, hey, you've still got me."
Steve sat stunned in the wake of the request. Thor and Tony pulling for the idea was bizarre. Hearing Loki genuinely asking for their help in his own roundabout way was enough to leave him feeling like he was having a stroke. "Sir, I don't see... I..." He shook his head, rubbing his fingers over his forehead to ward off an impending headache, and finally tried again, "I don't see how we could trust him, Sir."
"I thought we'd head back to my place," Tony replied airily. "Show you around a little, well... really, I thought I'd show off a lot." He could be quite shameless when it came to flaunting his wealth and genius, and he enjoyed the idea of trying to impress Steve. Tony mentally patted himself on the back for achieving a win in getting Steve to leave the party. He awarded himself an extra point for the awe Steve conveyed over his car. "Look at you smiling over there," Tony noted with a hint of smugness. "See, you're having a better time already."
"Twist my arm, darlin'," Logan breathed, cock throbbing hard in her mouth. His fingers tangled in red hair, and he moaned groaned deeply at the feel of her tongue working him. A quick glance at Scott and a nod were all the assurance he needed that they were both on board. Natasha figured out the right spots easily, her tongue dragging over the most sensitive parts of his cock. "Fuck, you look good down there." Eyes dark with lust of his own sought Scott out, and Logan moaned again at the look on his lover's face. Holding his hand out, he tugged Scott over next to him and pulled the man into a harsh kiss, his tongue thrusting against his lover's eagerly.
Tony could feel the barely-contained power behind Steve's every move. It was a thrill in and of itself, and that combined with the feel of Steve's cock sliding home over and over again left Tony cumming between them only moments before his partner. He cried out without restraint, overwhelmed by the power of his orgasm. Finally partially catching his breath, Tony offered Steve a cocky smirk. "You're definitely America's superso-"
Steve nodded. "I'll come back when I'm done. Jarvis, let Tony know dinner's going to be a little late."
Logan nodded, understanding without much effort where the request was coming from. "Glad to." As if to assure his lover he really would, he thrust hard into the man's body, watching as Scott's eyes fluttered and his lips parted. He brushed their mouths together fleetingly before shifting to kiss a trail along the man's jaw and down to his throat. His lips worked down to Scott's collarbone, and he nipped at the skin lightly a few times before shifting to Scott's shoulder. He hooked his hips into Scott's body right as he sank his teeth into the skin, licking and sucking at it a moment later once he was confident the bite would leave a mark.
On the bed, Stark slept like the dead, and Loki found himself watching the mortal intently. He wondered if the man dreamt of his lover. The idea brought a wicked smile to Loki's lips. There was potential in that idea. Simple glamour spells were easy enough, after all, and if they couldn’t bring him back to himself, they could make him someone else for a time. He ate sparingly and left plenty on the tray for Tony to enjoy a meal when he woke. The more Loki thought, the more he realized that he had other avenues to explore. It took but a moment's concentration to take on a form that he knew Stark would have no objection to and join the man in bed.
Tony wasn't the sort to believe in fate, but he wasn't going to argue with Steve. His lover was right about one thing: everything was okay right then. More or less. He stole another kiss and smiled. "I'll be alright. And if you ever tell anyone that I got leaky eyes, no sex for a week." He only kept a straight face for about three seconds before smirking wickedly at Steve. "Okay, so we both know that's bull. But nobody'd believe you, anyway."
As the world exploded into chaos, Natasha drifted wordlessly inside the cell and closer to Logan, who was clutching the gun as ordered. "Go take care of Scott. If we need two response teams, it would be good to know that now." She nodded toward the door. "No one's going to be paying attention enough to stop you."
"I believe you started that," Loki answered, staring for a moment longer at his hands and then looking back to Stark. "Unless you count the zoo, but if you recall, I didn't kill anyone there. I simply borrowed one or two of your friends and then returned them. Then I went to reclaim something that was rightfully mine. I should have a world to command, but apparently one needs silly weapons to prove a capability to rule in Asgard. Competence and study count for very little among my adoptive family."
Tony couldn't resist giving Steve a sharp smack on the ass as his lover walked past, returning Steve's glare with a leer before he turned back to his work.
Clint shifted nervously, torn. Things were escalating, and he had no idea what to do. No scenario that came to his mind ended in anything but one or both of them just getting hurt more. The archer wasn't sure he could handle what was happening right in front of his eyes, though.
Scott stared, dumbfounded. "Logan, you do realize you just said multiple nice things about me in a row, right? I'm kind of expecting you to get struck down by lightning or to learn that you're in the middle of a stroke. Can you even have a stroke?" He let the joke go and grew more serious. "Thank you. Seriously. I want to get back to that again. Maybe part of being stable was being part of something bigger, and once things fell apart with Jean... the X-Men wasn't the big picture for me, she was. I need a new picture."
Tony shook his head. "Nah, I should be there. I started it. I can be good. Promise," he said to Coulson, holding up a hand. "Scout's honor. I'll even swear on my morning coffee if you'll let me get to the pot. We can even hold hands and gaze adoringly into each other's eyes so they know I didn't slip him a roofie-colada." Coffee in one hand, Tony slipped his free arm around Steve's waist and rested his head on the blonde's shoulder with a grin. Partially, he was doing it to agitate Coulson, but he had to fight from actually letting his grin get too dopey as he enjoyed the scent of Steve's aftershave. "This good?"
"He knows I'll be fine," Phil answered evenly, wishing he'd taken some of his time earlier to follow Clint's example and at least get his hands in a more serviceable position. He'd let himself get distracted, and they couldn't afford stupid mistakes like that. He tried to keep his hands relaxed, tried not to telegraph the tension that he felt since he knew that would only entice Creed to further cruelty. "I'm not a blushing virgin and haven't been for a pretty long time." It was tough talk, and everyone in the room knew it, but it had to be said. Clint needed to know that he wasn't giving up so that Clint wouldn't give up either. They needed to share their strength. "I'm a little put out about the shirt, though. It was pretty nice."
Steve managed the faintest of smiles at that. "Yeah, I kinda noticed that." He kissed his lover to take the sting out of the moment for them both and sighed again. "Okay, yeah, I guess I kinda see why maybe you feel for the guy. And maybe I feel for him a little too. A little. A very, very little." He went back to burying his face against Tony's neck just to be closer. "Still think it would've been easier to turn Loki into paste, but, fine. We'll be nice. I won't kill him. I might punch him if the opportunity arises, but I won't kill him, and I'll try to be nice." He lifted his head. "Uh, considering the situation, maybe we should see about adjoining rooms or something for him and Thor. It seems... it seems kind of needlessly cruel to make them share a single bedroom suite."
Tony, his defenses broken, was unable to do anything except submit. A thick haze covered his mind, and he found himself hallucinating. Steve appeared before him, taunting and teasing him. The hand touching him was Steve's, and Tony nearly fell apart at the sensual stroke. "I... I want to grab you," he believed he was telling Steve, "kiss you... rip your clothes off..." Groaning deep in his throat, he shifted his hips in a desperate attempt for more contact. "Throw you down... and fuck you..."
No smut, no hardcore adult content, but there is mutant trafficking, so if that's a touchy subject for you, proceed with caution.
"Not sure I'd want to." Somewhere along the way he'd gotten used to Logan, even before he'd counted the man as a friend. Shifting, Scott straddled Logan's lap properly just to be closer. His arms slid over Logan's shoulders, and his forehead fell against Logan's. "I really, really wouldn't want to, actually. Having you next to me feels safe. Which is pretty dumb when we're all risking our butts with a guy who might as well be a real god." He kissed the man's lips. "It still feels better doing it with you."
Logan raised an eyebrow. "I have a feelin' this is gonna trump the 'me versus Stark' story. Or at least make it so I haveta wait until we're all out drinkin' to tell it."
"You know, I read in some article somewhere that ultimatums are bad for a relationship," Tony pouted, but pushed the coffee aside. "No more coffee, then. But you better be extremely naked when you come back. Maybe even super naked. Astonishingly naked. You can use my shower," he said, pointing toward the bathroom. "Hang on." Grabbing Steve by the sleeve, Tony snagged another blue hair. "This is interesting... Henry McCoy?" He looked at Steve askance, his expression playful, unable to resist teasing Steve a little. "Can't stay away from the scientific types, hm? You hussy, you."
Bruce put a hand on Logan's shoulder and stepped up cautiously. If the woman was Asgardian, he knew he stood the best chance if she was hostile. "We're with SHIELD. We were kind of hoping you'd be... uh, Thor." He rifled through his memories of the files he'd read. "Sif, right? I'm guessing that if you're here, things up in Asgard aren't too good."
Suddenly released from the bonds, Tony realized just how heavy he felt. And sore. He groaned as he pushed himself up into a sitting position. "Well, that's a lot more than Thor shared with us. But I guess it explains the mile-wide evil streak." His eyes followed Loki's pacing, though he was still having trouble picking up much more than an outline. It was a little uncomfortable, getting all that information on Loki. It really seemed like something to be kept in the family. Tony twisted at his newly rearranged bonds, sighing when he found them thoroughly impervious. He managed to edge himself back against the base of the frame he'd been tied to. Getting up sounded like too much trouble, and it would just give Loki the opportunity to knock him back down. "So I'm guessing maybe you resemble your mom."
“I think you overestimate the danger,” Coulson answered even though he didn’t quite believe the words. Bucky Barnes wasn’t a danger. The Winter Soldier, on the other hand, was a definite X factor. “I appreciate your letting me take care of things back at the suite.” He suspected Clint had been along for the ride at that point too. “I think an arrow to the knee might have escalated that situation beyond what was necessary.”
"No. You're not sitting this out. You handled it before. Briefing room. On the double." The computer chirped to indicate a closed transmission.
//Is he...? Nah.// Scott had been pretty obviously attached to Logan the last time he'd seen them together. He didn't have any reason to believe that the man was about to start playing the field. Not to mention, Logan didn't seem like the kind of guy who liked it when other people touched is stuff. Even in a cell, Clint kind of thought he might find a way to have him killed. "Yeah, kinda been a little crazy around here," Clint agreed, knocking the top off his own bottle before he took a swig. He raised his eyebrows appreciatively. "Good stuff. Might have to finish this. Can't waste good beer like that."
Loki's gaze shifted away, and he was surprised by how much the reality of that statement hurt. He didn't realize until then that he'd actually let himself think for a moment that there might be any corner of the universe so strange that he might find a home in it. "No, I suppose that's the right of it. I've never been terribly good at trusting anyone, and they've never had any reason in particular to trust me." Loki had wondered from time to time which issue had fed the other, or if they'd simply come together, already nestled inside him when he was born. "I suppose that means there isn't really any hope for either of us, Mr. Stark. More's the pity."
The agent nodded an affirmative. "It's at least news. In our line of work, information is power as much as anything. The more we know, the better our chances." He didn't bother to add that the more Loki knew, the less what they knew might matter. Time was of the essence, but it was passing at a snail's pace while they did more waiting than acting. None of them handled being benched well, not even Coulson. "I'm going to go linger obtrusively outside of Director Fury's office if you're interested."
Clint had the grace to blush a little, his eyes flicking down for a moment before looking back up at Phil. "I actually don't hear it as often as you'd think," he said, nudging a few more buttons open on Phil's shirt and letting his hand drift down over his abs, blunt nails raking lightly over skin. He leaned in, pressing his lips to Phil's jawline, kissing a slow trail down to his chin, his lips. "Haven't been in the habit of doing a lot of talking with... other people," he said quietly, the faintest quaver in his voice. He covered for it by pressing a few more soft kisses to Phil's lips as his hand slid down the man's side. It was actually hard for him to hold back, to just touch and explore, but it felt good. //Maybe there is something to this whole slowing down thing…//
Scott grinned in return and took a swig from his beer. "That I can and will happily agree to." He was glad that Logan wasn't angry with him. He was glad that they might be okay. "I can even promise closet space assuming I can afford a place with a closet and a drawer. I mean, that would be pretty fancy." Scott sat back to let the waitress set their food down. "Thank you." She gave them a warm smile in return, and he resolved to tip her within an inch of her life if she managed to keep up with their drinks too. The more he thought about it, the more he liked the idea of having a place of his own where he and Logan could be apart from the craziness of everything that went into being a hero. "Then again, after a week I might start missing Stark's tower after all."
Logan lowered his rifle and glanced at Coulson's targets, watching as the agent managed to come close to cutting one's head off with a series of well-placed shots. "Am I the only one who finds him strangely terrifyin'?"
"He's still out," Bruce began as he took a seat on the bench next to Steve and stretched his legs out in front of him. "We're working to get all the drugs out of his system. The stuff they gave him... I don't even know what some of it is. Once he's clear, then we wake him up and see. It's fair to say there was probably some brainwashing apart from the drugs, but I've got my suspicions that the cocktail was their main tool. That's good for us since it means once the detox is done..."
Natasha gave the same brief spiel she'd given to Logan. "Steve's in medical." She would think about how he was doing later. "I'll help you get him back to your quarters."
"Sleeping, which is for the best. I saw Coulson on my way in. He said Clint's taking it as well as can be expected." Steve shrugged despite looking anything but casual about the idea of the team being fractured and in pain. "I'm just hoping Nat shows up soon none the worse for wear. How are you doing this morning?"
"I would have said shockingly easy, though apparently the results are ultimately mixed in terms of their success. Since I've already failed with you, there's not much point in spending more time on the problem. Now, who else would like to go on a little trip, hmm?" Loki smiled for all the world as if he wasn't the least bit worried about what any of them might do. "Wolverine, is it? You'd do rather nicely... so much rage."
It had taken a lot of convincing to get Fury to release the hammer to Clint's possession, but a lot less than anyone had honestly expected. Fury was obviously just as pissed as the rest of them.
Logan tilted his head. "Don't haveta thank me, but you're welcome." He huffed out a quiet laugh. "I guess I'm just so used to shit bein' weird and changin' that I don't give it a second thought. Just par for the course in my world." He ruffled Scott's already-mussed hair. "But it is a little crazy soundin' when you put it that way. Guess tryin' to kick your ass was my way of sayin' 'call me, maybe'."
"No, it didn't. I recall it was distinctly painful in the end. As it turns out, having a Hulk may indeed trump having an army." Even an army of mutants, judging by how well their encounters had gone so far. Loki reclined back on the bed, making himself comfortable, and then looked over at Stark still seated in his chair. "It's interesting: you obviously don't like me, you're angry with me, but you don't seem to hate me. I'm fairly certain that you should." Certainly everyone else seemed to. What made Stark an exception?
"That, I can do," Clint decided, moving to start gathering dishes up and putting them in the dishwasher. "And I actually do pretty good cooking over a campfire, by the by. Usually just salt and pepper over dead animal, but you'd be surprised how good that can taste." He grabbed a cloth and started wiping down the counter. "And I'm sure as hell gonna run and hide away from civilization when this is all over. Not sure I can take much more of this tower, to be honest."
Steve was surprised that he kept breathing through it all. The gun was heavy in his hands. It didn't radiate the same creepy power the hammer had, not precisely, but it wasn't healthy. He knew that without the warnings just from the way it felt. The weight came from something that wasn't physical mass, and he hated even touching the damn thing. He hated seeing Tony look broken and defeated before they even began because that cut deeper than anything else. They stopped as a group outside of Natasha's cell, and Steve stood by while Coulson, jolted from the stupor that seemed to have overtaken them all, hurriedly unlocked the door.
Logan took the opportunity of Steve arching his head back to steal a quick kiss, lips working the lightly stubbled skin. He shoved Steve's boxers down to his knees and then used his feet to kick them away completely, then repeated the action for himself, leaving nothing between them as he let his heated cock nestle between Steve's buttocks. "Think I might like to see you fuck 'im," Logan finally growled.
Loki let the mortal go. It was enough for the moment. Stark needed to compose himself, and he needed to consider his next step. He could bargain for his life alone, or he could ask for more. Asking for more would require a show of faith beyond helping Barton. It would mean giving them Stark whole and mostly unharmed. Just letting Coulson and Barton could would mean nothing, especially after what he suspected Creed had done to them. Even if the Avengers were willing to take him in on a trial basis of some kind, it would mean creating a whole new host of enemies in the Brotherhood, who likely wouldn't appreciate being abandoned. //They have to learn to be less trusting sometime.//
Clint seemed to register at almost the same time that Coulson's hands were still clamped around his, and he could definitely feel the tension in them. "Hey, easy," he soothed, tugging one hand free to place on his handler's shoulder. "Nothing to apologize for. You did something that was fucking ballsy, a lot crazy... but nothing wrong." Clint had remembered the sick feeling he'd gotten watching the video during the debriefing. Coulson's stoic, fearless eyes. His confidence in spite of facing down a fucking god, for crying out loud. And then that moment when Coulson's eyes had gone wide, the vicious spear protruding from the man's chest. The archer had screamed in protest, even knowing the video was hours old. Nat and Fury grabbed him and shaken him back to reality. Looking at Coulson now, alive and whole and healthy in spite of recent bumps and bruises, Clint wanted to beg the man to never go on another mission ever again. Knowing that wouldn't work, the archer slowly let go of Coulson's hands and squeezed his shoulder one more time. "You did what you would've expected me or anyone else to do, and we're lucky enough that you somehow pulled through it all."
