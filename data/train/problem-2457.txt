Blackwater's face went from red to white. "I'm not going to—I'm not—"
“Savira and Mycroft are directing troops from London,” Janine continued. “Everyone’s calling their banners, at least our allies are. They’ve been coming in all day.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Queen Chessa of Sanctaphrax came in with her snow leopard striding by her side. She was the oldest queen Janine knew, the first female ruler on the continent. She was also Janine’s maternal grandmother, and she gave her a friendly nod.
To round it off, Kitty's lipstick was on Stan's neck.
Sherlock, certainly, but there were moments like these when he could forget that.
************
“How did you—ah, Dr. Watson. I suppose you’ve agreed as well?”
The man in black retrieved his sword and headed in the direction of the footprints, a man’s and the Woman’s.
See you Sunday!
“If the rumours are true, he’s hardly common.”
Sherlock hesitated.
It was strangely, wonderfully perfect, then, that all Sherlock wanted to say back was “I love you, too.”
Kitty laughed. "No, I didn't bring anything with me. I can go back and fetch something."
“Coward,” John snapped.
"Oh, I'll return them soon, Molly. Just as soon as all..." Kitty glanced at the twins, who were staring at her intently. "As all this is over."
"But she doesn't care about that, does she?" Molly said. "She just wants to help her friend."
“You have something of great value that I wish to take.”
choosing their strongest people before the giant came, loved watching them try and fail (but fail less hard than before) to take him down. Eventually Grezzik would be fighting fifteen people at a time, and he would always win, but everyone loved him.
“What was that?”
His grandfather smiled. “What do you think? Your mother did much of the decorating.”
Ireni curled her arms around Waverly automatically, studying the child’s dark face. The baby was drifting to sleep, and Ireni watched the tiny eyes close, watched her surrender her trust completely to the woman—a complete stranger—who held her.
"And two other girls, he calls them Lupin and Pansy. They're both a bit older than Kitty, but they were still after the third wife."
“It could have been a Bag of Holding,” Max mused.
Grandad John was sitting in his chair writing as they played, and Billy was suddenly concerned that Grandad John was lonely. He got off his chair and curled up next to him. "What are you writing, Grandad?"
Ireni raised her hand, but didn’t strike him.
“You did die. That is why you can’t move. We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you back.”
Sherlock was next to him now, and his cry of shock confirmed John's tentative deductions.
Molly had never been to a trial before. She probably should have been, but Ireni always got them out of any scrapes.
I have to. We have no time, and I won’t let anyone languish in there any longer. They don't have Stam."
Ireni was on the shore, busily ripping at a red cloak. She attached it to the Princess’ horse. “It’s fabric from a Guilder soldier’s uniform.”
Ireni peered into the stables. “Lovely.”
. I promise you that.”
“Thought you were dead,” Maria replied. “Thought you and Ireni might be dead. And we failed. And I had nowhere else to go, and nothing to do.”
The sun rose behind them as they reached the road, and Ireni spared a quick look behind her. Her eyes had never been harmed by the sun’s rays, and it and the moon were the only constants in her life. She clutched the amulet around her neck—the mark of those twin gods, the sources of her power.
“Why won’t you hold me, John?”
“Now, where is the poison? The battle of wits has begun. You choose a glass, and we both drink. Then we find out who is right, and who is dead.”
The man grunted and demanded beer.
The whole place looked like luxurious relaxation. The sea was warmer here than on any of Florin’s coasts, the gulls flying overhead came to nest, and the Royal Family brought their entire retinue here once a year.
"Are you sure, Father?" Kitty asked him. Watson wondered briefly how he'd grown so used to her calling them that, how easily he could tell which one she was addressing, despite them sharing the title.
“Well that is your greatest gift, my dear John.” Holmes took his hand again, kissed the tips of his fingers. “You’ve always been able to make the ordinary extraordinary.”
King Jamiarty gave his consent, and Sherlock went down. The crowd parted for him, and he walked in his long coronation robe…
Sherlock groaned. "He always wants to talk about that ridiculous baby."
“Yes, of course!”
“I’m not supposed to,” Grezzik said guiltily. “But Moran mentioned it one night. He thought the Prince is being very kind to give him a chance to be happy with another and still put in all this effort, especially when there’s so much concern about Guilder. Since they kidnapped the Princess; that’s why we were clearing out the Quarters.”
Anderson flinched.
It was Greg's turn to laugh. "Holmes-sexual," he gasped, wiping his eyes. John was all but growling into the phone. "My God, I want that on a T-shirt. Wait until Mycroft hears that one."
“You are not dragging my grandson into this mess!” Miracle Max snapped. “I’m not bringing him back to lose him again!”
Sherlock drew John close, and the voice was quiet, and his mind was quiet, and all he could feel was John. Holmes was crying, Watson holding his hand.
And love, of course, was the best kind of tradition.
“And what was that?”
“Oh for
“Now Father, that’s not entirely true. All the paintings are Father’s doing.”
Hope everyone enjoyed- don't worry, the lovers will be reunited soon!
"He showed it to me when he thought I was his," Kitty whispered. "God, I loved him so much, and I wanted him, and we were going to get married, and I was going to fix his broken heart. This was before Goldie, you see. Then he showed me the whole thing...even my own page."
(See the end of the chapter for
There were options, of course—nurses, a home, doctors to see if treatment was possible. The family talked long into the night about those options, and at last they came to the decision that there would be no fighting this particular war. John was a doctor, and Sherlock was one of the brightest people on the planet. They knew that whatever was coming, it couldn't be stopped.
Perhaps Mycroft wanted to make a point; that this way of doing the plan was still going to hurt, and it was much more dangerous. John must be with Mycroft, and not being allowed to contact him. That was all.
“I don’t like being bossed.”
Grezzik watched as his friend stroked John’s throat, watched the pill go down. His skin was crawling; this man was dead. He believed in Molly, but he’d felt death before. He’d carried both of his parents to their final resting places, felt the same cold stillness. What if they had only been mostly dead? But no, he’d sat with them for days, and Miracle Max had explained when he sent Grezzik out for frog dust that time would kill even those who were merely sort-of dead.
“I do not accept excuses. I’m going to have to find myself a new giant.”
“Didn’t Harry steal his first love?”
Yikes! I've had no power for the last two hours, I sprinted to my computer to post this, hopefully it can stay on for like five more seconds.
John and Roger Dimmock stood for Stan, and Molly, Lily and Jacob were in Kitty’s party. Mike had been persuaded to officiate again, and Mycroft oversaw directing people to their seats, a bit tricky when so many of the guests hadn’t seen each other in years. Trauma has a way of creating bonds that can stand the test of time, and the bride-to-be had spent her doe night catching up with her former co-workers.
“How does my hand prove that?”
“Why?” Sherlock asked.
(See the end of the chapter for
John kissed him again, longer this time. “Thank you for being family. For sharing yours. For everything.”
“She died on the road. She was buried at the palace, but because the King was married, he didn’t want to hurt his wife with his by-blow, even if she was born before their marriage. He asked the gardener to bury her, and tell no one about her resting place.”
It was enough to drive someone mad, but John was good at being alone in body, because he was never alone in mind.
“You were never close,” Sherlock said.
The hallway was blocked with people, gathered around a pale, young officer. John barged in without a thought, glaring at all of them. He placed himself between the stranger and Blackwater, a Sergeant with a nasty history of confrontation.
“We will find a way, without wine.”
"Mummy," he whispered, and oh, it had been years since he'd called her that, he must be really hurting, "Mummy, they won't go to Hell, will they?"
Kitty laughed and scooped Billy up. "Well, I suppose it's alright, then. But if Stan and I run out of answers to his questions, I'm bringing him back here."
Well, well, well...things are about to get interesting, aren't they?
Which meant Jamiarty knew about Sally, and had a whole day to plan.
“Why on earth would you trust me?” Lord Moran asked bitterly. “And why trust you? The only reason I’m helping you is the child.”
John couldn't help it. He flinched back a bit.
He sorely regretted it when the stag night began.
“When did that happen?” John snapped. He drew his healer’s pouch from his bag. “Damn it, say something next time.”
“Yes, but you’re walking around. Hard to charge someone with murder when the corpse is talking.”
He didn’t resist as Sherlock drew him close, tucked against that familiar coat. Sherlock was shaking, and John clung on, trying to be solid for this man who’d become so vital to his life.
“Bring me your five strongest!” he called. “I can take you all!”
Then Holmes had gotten called away on a case five days before Christmas. He hadn't wanted to go at all—he'd explained this to Watson three times in twenty minutes—but it was an important case. The fortunes of an old family depended on him discovering which one of the heirs was a murderer. Holmes hadn't felt the need to explain that it was his own godfather who'd just died, the very man who'd introduced him to the study of chemistry and logic when he was a boy of ten, and though the old man hadn't left him any money (per his own request), he was determined to discover his murderer.
“You delivered me?”
Well, that concludes this story (I say as I have a few more chapters planned but will be posting much later). I hope everyone enjoyed this.
Holmes nodded. He started to go, then turned and kissed Watson full on the mouth. Watson drew him close, and they didn't let go for a long time.
“So I found a line of work that appealed to that. It’s never bothered me, any of it—the killing, the ransoms, the…well, negotiations. But I knew it mattered to both of you, so I kept you from the worst parts. And I’ve tried…I’ve tried so hard to be kind to you, but it’s hard. And I never really succeeded. And when I found you in London, I saw that you were with people who were being kind to you. I didn’t want to take you away from that. And then that woman was pregnant, and you needed help, and for the first time, I could…I could help you. In a way that mattered.”
“Sherlock, hurry up!”
There was a knock on the door of the carriage, and Molly looked at Ireni. The others wouldn’t knock.
They made it down to the dock faster than Grezzik expected, and they were in a rowboat before the dockmaster could ask what was going on.
Sally just wants to see her daughter again, but there's more than she bargained for.
"I think I really, really need you to call me that again."
“Jamiarty wouldn’t be able to keep their capture quiet,” Molly said decisively. “He is a proud man, always ready with a lie. He would have announced the joyous return of the Princess.”
“You’re welcome. And you’ll do fine. Now get to the gate. By the way, if your cousin wants to come to the wedding, he can join in.”
“As ruler, you need to be the sword of your people. You must fight with voice and might and heart for your country, always taking the option of least harm. Your people should feel safe with you upon the throne.” The last part was said much louder. Sherlock and Jamiarty were circling each other, trading blows in almost perfect silence, but Jamiarty’s eyes still flickered over to the throne.
“We won’t,” Grezzik told her. “It wouldn’t make sense in this climate anyways.”
“Very sweet,” Sherlock said. His lips twitched. “John, why don’t we go ahead? There’s a nice café across the street. That ought to give you enough time. See you in, what, twenty minutes?”
Stam wanted to vomit. “So you’ve killed a child?”
Ireni lolled back. “I don’t know if we need to, really. We get in, and most of us will cause a distraction. Sally and the King will go to the Throne Room, and you should guard them on the way there.”
Anonymous. Moriarty.
The three of them went inside. Billy marvelled at the little house. He’d always thought that Baker Street was his grandfathers made rooms; they fit so beautifully. But this was their own place, and every little thing from the blue sofa to the thick drapes (in case Grandfather Sherlock had a headache) was perfectly them.
“It’s nothing bad,” Mycroft assured them. “He’s a great-grandfather now.”
“Mummy and Daddy will keep you company,” Rachel promised as she danced in front of the group. “Grandfather John, will you tell us a story?”
“And why…”
“I beg your pardon?”
John's heart stopped. “What? Sherlock, what's happening?”
When he returned to the house, John was making tea. Smiling, Holmes came up behind his husband and wrapped his arms around him. “Good morning, my dear,” he whispered. He pressed his lips to the nape of John’s neck. “Did you sleep well?”
Miracle Max nodded, looking weary. “The year Jamiarty was ten, I was travelling in the fall. I went to…well.” He looked at John. “Your Grandmother and I went to visit your parents.”
“He didn’t come,” Sherlock whispered.
Moriarty sneered at him, all hilarity gone from his face. "I want you to suffer, John Watson. I want Sherlock Holmes to suffer. You let him think he could be happy with anyone other than me, and he believed it."
Lestrade was happily married (to a woman who was mistress to six different men) with one daughter (who moved to Scotland to get married and rarely came to visit due to financial difficulties though she did write to her father faithfully), and never once thought that there might be another kind of happiness.
“This is posh,” John said, suddenly feeling awkward. Mycroft had moved only three months ago, and from the amount of time they were spending going up and the gold leaf on the walls, this was an upgrade.
Guards came into the throne room. They stopped when they saw the King and Sally with Jamiarty.
“Now, a clever man would put the poison in his opponent’s glass, because only a great fool would drink what was in front of him. I’m not a great fool, so clearly I cannot drink the wine in front of me. But you’re well aware I’m not a great fool, so clearly I cannot drink the wine in front of you.”
“I didn’t see much point.” Sherlock said. “Either Jamiarty would bring me back to our marriage, or they would kill me. I wasn’t quite sure which would be worse.”
Sherlock groaned.
Cheers, Acme
Grezzik tried to shake the man off, but he wasn’t budging. He backed into a rock as hard as he could, but the man in black wouldn’t let go. In fact, his arms started to tighten.
Too lazy to cook a full supper, Holmes had spread honey on bread and they eaten that with some of the new peas and beans, sitting in their chairs on the porch together. Watson's chair rocked, and he set it going just a little, his eyes closing as he wondered whether they did, in fact, have to wait until it was fully dark to go to bed.
Kitty was indeed in labour, face rigid with pain. Stan held Kitty’s hand tight while Sherlock dialled Molly and Mike. John settled her comfortably on their bed and starting preparing for a home delivery.
Be careful love—JW.
Except for Maria, who ran out after him with the six-fingered sword. “Murderer!” she screamed.
“I’ve known too many Spaniards.”
Watson raised his eyebrows. “What do you mean?”
It had only been forty-eight hours since gay marriage was made legal in the UK, and (surprise, surprise) the world had not yet come to an end. Greg was pleased, of course, but it didn’t really impact his life. Or so he had thought.
"He's fine," Kitty tried to soothe, her voice breaking. "He's fine, Father, he's right next to you."
A couple minutes later, Molly shouted “now!”
John looked at him. “You’re interested.”
The only distraction was Waverly, who clearly wasn't sensing the tension and demanded to be played with. They took turns with her, holding her and playing horsey. The only one who couldn't hold her properly was Grezzik, so Molly sat next to him, holding Waverly up as Grezzik made funny faces with her.
“Why?” Sherlock challenged. “I want to know.”
That day Ireni learned two things. The first was that she had to know more than magic to survive, that to depend on it would make you weak. The second was that her growing suspicion that she wasn’t built to love, that caring about people just didn’t happen to her…that was the greatest blessing she’d ever known.
“We weren't together from the start,” John whispered.
Jamiarty’s eyes widened. “Hope, get Moran. We have much to discuss.”
“What, Jamiarty?” Martha said slyly.
John did relent after Act One. Greg had learned his lesson, one he should have learned long ago. 'Never mess with a Holmes, even if it's only by marriage.'
Watson froze. He couldn’t know…could he? And if he did, what then?
Mycroft Holmes smiled then, his eyes lighting up. “I am delighted to see you understand yourself, Doctor.”
“Then I name your union complete in the eyes of man and the eyes of the Powers. Please seal your union with a kiss.”
“You still don’t like saying that, do you?” Billy had heard that Grandfather Sherlock used to think rather badly of women. Mum said he just didn’t know many good ones. That must be why he never got married.
Lady Hope laughed. “Congrats, Riley.” He took a long drink of his foul-smelling tonic. “What have you found?”
Jamiarty goes on trial, and Molly has a question to ask Janine.
"Sherlock, dear, if I've learned anything from the last twelve years, it's that you are not to be trusted when completing paperwork."
When Molly Hooper was thirty-three, she heard that Sherlock Holmes and John Watson were together at last. There was a queer ache in her chest that morning—something seemed to have gone wrong—but when she saw them together she realized that she’d very quietly gotten over Sherlock Holmes. Mike was ecstatic about ‘Johnlock’, and when he offered to take her to dinner to celebrate she accepted.
Holmes didn’t wait to hear the amused chuckles. He drew John close and kissed him tenderly.
The Carriers didn’t respond.
Molly’s voice sounded dangerously like her old self, like Maria, whose tongue was sharper than her sword, who sometimes even snapped at him. But Grezzik wasn’t afraid this time. He knew how much Molly loved Waverly too.
Lestrade’s eyes widened for a moment before he laughed. “You would think that I’d be used to such magic by now from a Holmes. Yes, I’m going to join my Maggie. She’s had another baby, and her husband is ill. I may be able to help with the children.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He also knew that two of the librarians were Carriers, and that Raz cared about his staff more than the books, which was saying something. If the Carriers had been harmed in any way, Raz would know. And be willing to share that information, so long as it meant they could help with the bashing.
Sherlock looked at him sideways. "If you don't want to stay we can leave," he said seriously.
“Power too, promise me that!” A strike to his right cheek, now his face was covered in flowing blood.
“To hell with that.”
And one woman booed.
If he’d been faster, the abducted gentleman would have made it home to his desperate, loving wife. Their child, who’d been abducted first, wouldn’t have screamed watching her father die, and she wouldn’t have been struck in a panic. Now the wife was a widow, the mother childless.
"I'm alright."
Jamiarty and Molly were still duelling. Sally heard running footsteps just outside the door, and panicked—Molly wasn’t there to block the door—but it was Sherlock and John, dashing into the room. John stayed at the door, and Sherlock ran for Jamiarty.
“They kept it quiet. All she ever wanted was a child.” Sherlock’s voice was softer than Janine had ever heard. “She told me when Jamiarty brought me to the palace for the first time. She really wants…wanted grand children.”
The old hands were shaking, but they were stronger than Sally remembered. “Father, you look well.” She blushed—it was such a change of subject, but something had occurred to her. “Have you been healing?”
Billy loved his room on sight. It was bright and warm, the same wallpaper as his room at home, and a huge bed. Grandfather John laid the case on the ground by the bed. “Need any help?”
John looked at Sherlock helplessly. "This is mental."
Sherlock kissed his cheek.
He was chained to a table in a dark room. There was one candle, and just before it sputtered out a silent albino would appear. He would dress John’s wound, which was healing nicely, feed him, ignore all of John’s questions, and leave. That left John alone with his thoughts quite a bit. He’d had a touch of fever the first week, and hadn’t been able to process much, but now his mind was clear. He could hear the faint sound of different kinds of animals above his head, so he had to be under something, but beyond that…
John didn't know how to answer that. "I hope so, dear," he said finally. "We'll help her to be as much as we can—that's all we can do, isn't it?"
“I do. They rescued my daughter when she was kidnapped.”
“We can’t draw too much attention,” John cautioned. “It’ll move Jamiarty too quickly.”
“Just before dawn. I didn’t want to miss a moment. Uncle Mycroft will be here for breakfast.”
The white horses Jamiarty was so proud of were now a dull brown. It was a special paint, the only way that they could cover the needed distance without showing the world, “hey, we have the Prince’s whites!”
The passage ended in a wall surrounded by bookshelves, and Sherlock crouched there for several breaths, listening for movement. He could hear Raz, humming an off-key tune, but there were no other sounds. Sherlock crept through the shelves, walking the way an old woman should.
Holmes beamed. "We don't have to lie about it anymore!"
“Tell me a story, Grandfather?” Billy asked hopefully. That was what he missed most about Grandfather John—his endless supply of adventures.
“I know…I know it’s a lot to ask, and I swear, it’ll be mine and Stan’s baby, you can be involved as little or as much as you want—”
Molly watched Janine walk to a large, ornate table. King Lotharon and Queen Bella were sitting there, with Queen Chessa, Sukiv, and Savira. Sally was sitting there too, crowned with a simple gold coronet. Anderson sat next to her, with Waverly in his arms. There were bannermen in the court from Prumpt, and Nepce, but their leaders weren’t there.
“In the first place, a knighthood is meaningless to me. The title would not change my station; I still have enemies in high places as much as I do friends, and any monetary compensation is unnecessary. We have plenty of money for ourselves, even enough to indulge, now that—” Holmes broke off. Shortly after he'd given up drugs for good, Watson had come to him with his cheque book, with instructions not to give it to him if there were any sort of race on that day. Since then the doctor was in much better financial condition. It struck Holmes, however, that bringing this up to one's husband was impolite.
“Yes, indeed. John will come for me and take me away from you.”
John had been trying to sleep for the past two hours—ahis husband (God that was a gorgeous word) had managed to fall asleep, but even with a quick drink John was staying resolutely awake. Which might be a problem when it came time for them to go to bed.
“Is it now?” John raised his eyebrows. “What’s so important about that?”
“You’ve got a living family. You’ve got Mrs. Hudson, Greg…even Molly and Mycroft.”
By the time they returned to Baker Street, the fog was completely gone.
“That’s no good for a King.” Savira scowled at the Lord. “And we’re sure that we trust you?”
“Nearly ten years,” John replied. “We’ve been married for five.”
“She’s upstairs with that nice guard Kate. They’re watching Jamiarty and Moran. Enjoy yourself, Molly.” Then he waltzed off—with Duke Mycroft, of all people!
(See the end of the chapter for
Billy listened intently as his sister skipped around. She hadn’t stopped moving since the day she was born, and Watson was sure his granddaughter would be dancing across a stage when she grew older.
He did. Watson could feel his wedding ring pressing against his heart under his shirt as he held Holmes.
Warning for non-graphic torture.
“John, if we start that…we’ll never get Sally safe. You know that.” Anderson looked panicked. “Even if he does know—”
Holmes pulled back abruptly. “I apologize. You are the one who’s been injured.”
Kitty was beaming, for once all traces of pain gone from her eyes as she held her son. "Isn't he beautiful?" she whispered.
John's breath caught in his throat. “No.”
“Sorry?” Sherlock said.
“Your Majesty,” Janine said, and she curtsied deeply.
The crash had come from a tea cup (John winced, it was one of Mrs. Hudson's favourite teacups). Its shattered remains were now on the floor next to the table where it had been sitting, quite away from the edge. It shouldn't have fallen on its own.
“Really?”
The first thing that shocked Sally about the King was that he was standing. And standing on his own, reaching up for a book, in fact. Queen Bella was the one sitting, but she was on a raised chair. It was almost comical, her feet dangling in the air, but that wasn’t why Sally smiled. Queen Bella had never looked so relaxed in all the time Sally had known her.
John shuffled. “I mean, the music for the party—if we have one at all, if Mycroft has his way it’ll just be the ceremony—”
, John Watson, and I think we should explore them, don't you?"
And that's precisely what he did.
"Am I…:"
"Shut up!" John yanked Moriarty back, releasing him and beginning to pace. "What do you want?"
Sherlock drew John onto his lap. “I didn’t think we needed it, to be quite honest.”
“You are supposed to save some of this for the marriage bed, yes?”
Even in the dark, John knew Sherlock was smiling.
It made sense. There was quite a drop. But Maria was bored.
Mycroft drew a small box from his pocket. “I know I didn’t give either of you much time for thought, but I also don’t know if the traditional vows quite work for this occasion.” Opening the box, he drew out two identical gold rings. He handed one to each of them.
John leaned his head against Sherlock's shoulder. "You know you don't have to keep coming up with new places to...rendezvous, right? I'm perfectly happy with what we already do."
They reached the bridge to Florin just before noon. To Sherlock’s relief, Jamiarty hadn’t implemented his bridge guards despite London technically being its own small country.  They crossed the bridge, John keeping a hand on his sword. When they’d crossed, Anderson led the way into the woods.
So Sherlock didn’t want to talk about it.
When he was young, Grezzik wanted to be a lawman.
Holmes doesn’t know the word ‘demisexual’; he thinks asexuality is a plant trait, not a human one, and he considered himself a broken man for a long time. In the end he didn’t need the words to explain things; he got Watson instead.
“Holmes,” John said gently. “Perhaps this isn’t the best way of reacting?”
The voice called again, and Molly recognized Martha’s voice. “Martha? It’s still dark.”
“And I don’t reckon you’ll need to do much crawling about in the forest once you’re King,” Sherlock added.
The other Brute lunged at them, but the giant Brute knocked him down with one quick blow. Then he sat down with the woman in his lap, held like a baby.
“And you are not?” Stam approached the cell. “Seb, you weren’t always this close to Jamiarty. But ever since you have been…what has he told you?”
John hated the idea deeply, but he wasn't supposed to pass judgement. His job was to appear just too late at the house, and in a grief-stricken rage try to force his way in. Greg would be on the scene as a first responder, and he would pull John back from the flames and drag him back to Baker Street. There, John would tell them him and Mrs. Hudson that Sherlock wasn't dead, Mrs. Hudson would go stay with her brother-in-law (who was not a murderer, a lovely man with five children in Florida) and Greg would resign (temporarily) and go about his days with his income quietly supplied by Mycroft, though ostensibly gotten through music.
“Try me.”
John groaned as they made their way through Scotland Yard. "Why did you have to solve so many cases while I was ill?"
"What do you need me to lift?" Grezzik asked.
“They are aware I didn’t kidnap Sherlock, right?” He would never let Sherlock’s royal title pass his lips, not ever.
“Why do you wear a mask? Were you burned?” As he spoke, Grezzik kept swinging his fists. The man in black dodged each one.
“I’m glad you two are together again,” Stam replied. He yanked the scarves tight, trapping Jamiarty’s ankles against the rough edges of the chair. “It wasn’t right, you being apart.”
Sherlock kissed him back, not caring where the horse was going, where they were. They were together, and they were free.
“We had some help,” Molly said. The Spanish lady didn’t look as happy as Sally expected.
“I have what I want. I have my woman, my justice, and my new family. I don’t need anything from you.”
“I wouldn’t have done it if he didn’t enjoy it,” Holmes mumbled.
"Will it hurt?" Grezzik asked.
“Because I looked behind us and someone is there.”
“No need to be snappish.” John took a deep breath. “I’ve felt you afraid, Sherlock. Remember when we were hiding in that closet two months ago?” It was so small they’d stayed pressed together for hours, waiting for their target to fall asleep in their stupidly large mansion. Not that John had particularly minded.
Cheers,
“Hello, my name is Maria Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die!” And now her voice was stronger, and the pain was meaningless, and she was standing tall.
The throne room was empty, and Sally nearly fell to her knees in relief. But she couldn’t stop yet.
Twitterpated, by the way, is a reference to Bambi--it's basically puppy love.
“Won’t that be nice!” the King said. “You must show it to me when you return.”
“I would not say such things if I were you.” The grin was gone from Jamiarty’s face, replaced by an unsettling stillness.
“Delightful.” Mycroft stepped back as Grampy threw down the gangplank. “And Anderson, it’s good to see you. I’m delighted your mission was a success.”
Holmes groaned. "You can't say things like that, John."
“Best to be prepared,” Sherlock retorted. “You never sent the ships. Don’t lie to me anymore.”
Bertie Gruner was one of the most famous men in London. Well known for his philanthropy and sound business sense, Gruner was a regular face in the more respectable newspapers, a constant presence at society events, and a three-times heartbroken widower.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I hope we win.”
Grezzik turned when Ireni shouted in frustration.
“That I cared?” Mycroft asked.
Without any consideration for the heat of the drink Kitty raised the mug and downed it in one go. "There. Thanks Doctor, that does feel better. So what you need to do—what I'm asking you to do—is to find his book."
Sally handed her Waverly. “Hold her for a moment? I need to stretch my legs.”
“The trust of the young Irregulars,” Watson replied. “The smiles of the patients I help and the clients we save. A warm home, and friends who share their hearts with me. And above all, the love of a man who is extraordinary beyond compare.” Watson reached up and stroked Holmes' cheek. “I will not cheapen that honour.”
Sally covered Waverly’s face with kisses as Philip put his arms around them both. Waverly finally began to fuss, and Sally opened her dress, letting Waverly nurse. Only then did she look up to Grezzik and Molly. “Thank you”, she whispered. “You saved her.”
Cheers
When facing a coward, you had to make sure he wasn't able to run.
Sherlock lay back in the grass. It was rather sunny out. Perhaps it was making his ears too hot to hear properly.
And that afternoon, after Sally had slept, when she asked Grezzik and Molly to be Waverly’s Caretakers, Molly promised with every fibre of her being.
Holmes leaned into the touch for the briefest minute. “What are we to do, then?” he said in frustration. “If someone else notices and understands—”
The moment Sherlock’s footsteps had faded, Jamiarty bent close to Moran. “He is what I’ve called you here to discuss. I’ve heard a reliable rumour that killers from Guilder aim to kill my beloved on our wedding night.”
Sorry it's up kinda late in the day, but...I'm done my Master's! NO MORE HOMEWORK EVER AGAIN, SO MUCH MORE TIME FOR WRITING.
How had he gotten here?
“He died well. No bribe attempts or blubbering. He just said please, please I need to live.”
He tried, but he couldn’t delete the look on Holmes’ face when he asked whether John had told him about his family. How Watson hadn’t told Holmes about it until after fifteen years of friendship. How it was that revelation, more than Afghanistan, the horrors they saw as detectives, or even the ‘solution’ to Moriarty, that taught Holmes that Watson ‘hides his pain well’.
(See the end of the chapter for
John recoiled. "You're in love with him?"
“Let me see if I understood my little brother correctly. Your feelings for him are not only friendly, but romantic. My brother has revealed that those feelings are mutual, and you have both decided to keep quiet on the matter to avoid scandal and imprisonment.”
“Because he’s a fucking coward,” Sherlock replied. “He’ll wait for us to be helpless. That’s why he booby-trapped the door to lock behind anyone who entered.”
“Sherlock?”
Now I know this isn't the anniversary of this fic, but it is my one year anniversary of being on this site, so I wanted to write something appropriate. This has been a crazy, wonderful year, and I want to thank all of my readers for being a part of it.
“No, I—” Mycroft cut himself off. “Forgive me, I’m doing this all wrong.”
“Of course, Jim.” And of course Riley could. She’d controlled herself the night the child was born, hadn’t she? She’d swallowed her hurt and her pride and let the child be born, even when she could have done nothing. Could have let her die.
“Not I.” Jamiarty shook his head. “I didn’t want to fuck her. No, Anderson—the spy guard—he knocked her up. And the child has been born, a healthy baby girl.”
“Yes, I do.” John was serious. “You’re my best friend, Greg—well, after Sherlock, but I can’t very well have my husband as my best man.” He started. Clearly hadn’t said the word yet, Greg thought fondly.
Sherlock looked more nervous than John had ever seen him, eyes nearly glowing in the bright light. “John, will you let me ask you one question?”
That’s why she got out of the way, as much as Grezzik’s blank eyes unnerved her, and motioned for the others to do the same.
It wasn’t until they were in their rooms that Holmes spoke up. “John—”
“When do we start?” Molly asked.
No one spoke as Stan laid the box in the ground and they took turns covering it with dirt. Rachel became hysterical once it was done, and Stan led her inside, holding her close against his side. Kitty stayed with Billy, holding her son's hand as they stared at the ground.
), but he failed to realize that Riley was very much in love with him. Well, as in love as she could be. And when Anderson ran off with Sally, and Riley found out that the Carrier was carrying Anderson’s child…well. Hell hath no fury, and all that.
“Wake up!” Sherlock ordered. “What’s her name?”
Lily and Jacob are their only blood children, but when the twins are eight they decide to become foster parents. Sherlock and Kitty find children among the Homeless Network, and a little bureaucratic meddling means their house is full of kids for years. Mike retires to become a stay-at-home father.
“Then why the hell isn’t he here?”
“Wait. Stam?”
King Lotharon covered his face. “What a damn, stupid fool I’ve been,” he whispered.
I find myself writing again as a continuation of the previous entry. Kitty Watson has found an excellent boarding-house and has made several friends. She has even acquired a job doing some typing for Scotland Yard (entirely on her own, I may add, and none the wiser so far as to her true identity). She visits at least once a week, and I have found myself caring for her as dearly as if she were my own niece. Sherlock adores her too, and has begun training her in the art of observation; she is a far better student than I could ever hope to be.
Janine joined her, and pressed their hands together.
And yet he was unafraid.
“I never took you for religious.”
“I do not expect you to do so. Nor does Prince Jamiarty. The Prince wishes you well, in fact.”
For timing purposes, this is post marriage, pre-Kitty.
"DI Lestrade."
Kitty took Stan’s hand. “Well, I’m in my thirties.”
“I decided to put my pain away,” Sherlock replied. “I didn’t want to look at it, so I buried it. I suppose it was just once too many.”
“I don’t know if I’m brave enough.”
“The point is for the two of you to have things that others in love may have!” Mycroft cried exasperatedly. “Perhaps only those of us onboard may know of it, but you will be bound together. I know that you both wish it, why not have it?”
John raised his left hand, showing his ring. “You might want to make it two candles.”
Kitty tells Sherlock and John about her case, and arrangements are made.
After all, how hard could that possibly be?
“And what will you do?”
“How the hell am I going to explain any better?”
Cheers,
John helped Sherlock into Greg's car and sat right next to him. "Keep your eyes closed," he reminded Sherlock. "It'll keep down the nausea." He cursed himself for not bringing his medical bag. "Greg, have you got any paracetamol?
To his surprise Sherlock drew him close and kissed him. "Of course, my dear John," he said. "And then we'll go home."
Sherlock paused. “I don’t…I don’t know.”
“I found this when I first arrived,” Lestrade admitted. “And I wanted to look for you; I wasn’t sure if you were dead yet but even when I knew you were I…I couldn’t find the courage.”
Three pairs of feet hit the deck almost instantaneously.
Bonus points for those of you who know your canon well and can guess at who the mysterious Mrs. Hopkins is. Her backstory will be addressed (in both timelines) in the coming weeks. Along with a certain...other event.
Cheers,
“We are sorry,” Grezzik said. He was kneeling now, so his eyes were level with the King and Queen. “This must be terrible for you to think about. But Jamiarty is dangerous.”
“I know. It’s not happening again.”
They were in the rowboat again, after Grezzik had climbed down with the three of them strapped to him. They were slower going back, partly because of the extra people onboard, but London was approaching. Molly had knots in her stomach. Ireni had always made her feel that way, and now, when she’d returned from the dead…what did she want?
John winced. Running the Revenge away from Florin when he’d heard of Sherlock’s engagement had been the worst decision he’d ever made.
“Well, obviously you attempt to avoid it as much as possible. But when it does happen—especially when it’s their fault—well, you might as well make jokes about it for a while, right?”
Alone in the darkness for at least two days now, two days of relentless interrogation before that…he was going to miss Kitty’s first day of school. Strange, that…his daughter was a grown woman, going to early childhood education school, it didn’t matter. But he still wanted to be there, rather than this dark, pain-filled room where the only sound was a leaky faucet…
Sally was getting tired of the bickering.
Moriarty coughed loudly, and John snapped out of it. He didn’t have much time here. He had to make it count for Sherlock.
“What was her name?”
Greg wished briefly for the ground to swallow him, but with his luck he'd end up in China without a passport.
“As you wish, Sherlock.” Watson frowned. “Was there anything else?”
Sherlock didn't answer for a moment.
“What?! What are you talking about?!”
Watson rolled his eyes. “How long have you been planning this, Sherlock?”
“I’ll take my chances.”
“Answer it. Call me when there's news.”
Sherlock could have written back, but he had no idea what road John was taking to Marseille. There were better uses for his time. Like moping, or sulking…
Sherlock lost a lot of ground in the rankings the day John left. John was gone, and winter was approaching, and what was the point of doing anything?
In her eyes, Mrs. Hudson has three sons (two who live with her and one who rarely comes home). All three men privately think the same.
“I don’t think they exist. We haven’t seen one—” John cut himself off with a shout. “Sherlock, move!”
His surprise deepened to see a Christmas tree in the corner, partly decorated with baubles. There were two wrapped packages underneath, one quite small and the other large. Out of habit, Holmes began to deduce what they were, then stopped. Watson wouldn't have wrapped them if he'd wanted Sherlock to know what they were.
“If you would prefer, I could kill you now,” Grezzik offered.
“He’s not my dearest love.” No, his dearest love was a man who’d called him ‘clever’ and meant it, who’d run beside him.
John let Sherlock make the introductions. He helped his grandparents down from the boat and concentrated on putting one foot in front of the other.
Stan nodded eagerly.
“Not at all,” Mycroft interrupted, as gently as he could. “I write very few letters; I would be happy to expand my correspondence. What do you wish for me to write about?”
For the first time Riley started to fidget. “He wants to take over Guilder, but he needs a new source of war. He decided to take back the Carrier slut, but he knew you wouldn’t give her up.”
“You’re the King’s daughter,” he whispered.
Mycroft merely stared at him until Holmes grew nervous.
“She was going to be my Carrier.”
Yes, I know there's some overlap in what people are finding out, but that's what happens when you split the party :)
“Yes, Father.”
Sally fled.
“We are.” John leaned over and kissed his husband, ignoring Rachel’s squawk of disgust. “I love you, Sherlock.”
Back at the Cliff’s of Insanity, Prince Jamiarty was tracking.
Then the night table became their daughter’s, and now the room was open again, open for any of their family to visit.
“Can I speak to you, my friend?” Molly asked. “I know you need your strength for your arms, not your words, but can I speak to you?”
“Oh, but it has, and I know where the poison is!”
It really didn’t bear thinking about. She was a Carrier. That was all she was. She couldn’t be a Queen…
“One of your children is dead. If you want to save the other, keep your son as your only heir.” The King’s voice cracked. “So I buried Carla in a grove instead of the Mausoleum and kept you a secret from the world. If anyone asked, I told them that I was letting the Carriers have the love they wanted, provided that there was at least one woman available to give a child at all times.”
“And how’s Mrs. Hopkins?” John asked.
“Oh, Sherlock,” John said, smirking. “They’re speaking at the same time.”
He fell, and Maria dashed to him. But there was no goodbye, no final word. Domingo was dead before he hit the floor.
But he didn’t love her alone.
John shook his head. “See you soon, son.”
Grezzik nodded and tossed away the rock. Before it hit the ground, the man in black was on him. He wrapped his arms around Grezzik’s waist and squeezed as hard as he could. Grezzik stood patiently, waiting for the man to tire.
“Well…the man scratched his neck. “It’s possible. I kill a lot of people. When was this?”
Poor Stan, who'd done much of the physical work the last few days, fell asleep fairly quickly, but Kitty couldn't sleep. She watched her fathers, knowing that the moment she closed her eyes, they'd fall asleep too and never wake up.
John rubbed small circles into Sherlock’s palms. “I’m not leaving you, love.”
“I’m glad to see you too, Princess.” Janine curtsied somehow, in a billowing cloak.
A bit of the fire went out of Kitty's eyes. "Thank you."
It was a simple plan—just the way Molly liked it.
“Promise.” Sherlock took John’s hand. “Well, I suppose we’d better go. It’s a woman’s by the way.”
The news that
“I beg your pardon?”
“I’ll have to hang on. Unless you think I should wait in the boat?”
“I thought Regents Park,” Holmes said, undeterred by Watson’s grumpy tone. “Do come, London’s lovely by night.”
She’d already injured half the Brute Squad.
Sherlock took the pills without protesting. John wiped his face with the cool flannel. "Go to sleep, love," he whispered. "When you wake up things will be better."
“So we need a way for you to find out about the child, so you can officially demand the baby.”
“That’s kind of you, Detective,” Kitty said.
"Right. Well, get some sleep, okay? You'll be perfectly safe here, I promise."
Before her mother dies, Molly gets up the courage to ask her about how her father died. She’s not at all surprised to hear her mother made a desperate attempt to protect her. She’s just surprised that the police let them go.
“I can protect myself. I trained.”
When Mycroft died at eighty-two, Greg buried his husband with a bitter smile. "Heart attack," he said disbelievingly. "An actual heart attack. I wonder if that's what he was always afraid of, bless him." The tears came later, the stroke a few months further on. Sherlock held John's hand tightly as they stood at the gravesites of their brothers, and vowed that he wouldn't let John die first.
Cold and weary, Holmes finally managed to swing his bag down from the carriage and stalk off. He wasn't going to bother with slinging it to a comfortable position—no, that's what men did when they deserved to be happy. Which clearly, he didn't, or he wouldn't be stuck in Baker Street alone over Christmas.
Mary let herself relax. “Will your wife do me the honour of arranging my flowers? I still do not possess her knack, and I want everything to be beautiful.”
“Rest now,” Holmes soothed. “I have you.”
It was heartbreaking, watching the girl struggle to get her breathing under control, curled in over herself. John saw his own anguish reflected in Sherlock's eyes, but neither of them wanted to make it worse.
He tried just lifting things (and people): “Booo!” He tried dancing: “booo!” He tried to stop performing all together and just pull the caravans, and the group threatened to fire him. People were coming to see him, even if all they did was boo.
Sally was seven years younger than Jamiarty.
At the sound of the clap, the lights—two lanterns—came on, showing Sherlock’s fond expression.
This one's set about a month after Chapter One (A Matter of Family).
“I just…you said that you see in my face what I see in yours,” Holmes said.
John did as he asked, his eyes fixed on the Count, who was now resting his hand on a lever. It was currently resting at 0, but the scale went up to 50. He closed his eyes. He didn’t need to see what was going to happen. He needed to focus on the techniques Murray had coached him in, how to shield your mind from pain no matter how terrible…Sherlock stood beside him…
“You’re joking.”
Kitty smiled at him. “Never thought Da would be such an expert on trolls. Goodness knows I can’t always give the right advice.”
“I’ll walk with you,” Hopkins said quickly. “It’s dark out, and it’s not far, is it?”
Sherlock shrugged. "That's not completely necessary."
The hotel was far more posh than John had ever seen, but Sherlock's parents had insisted on paying for the honeymoon. The lobby seemed to be lined with gold, and John's shoes felt far shabbier than ever as he walked across it.
Also, I'm not sure if 'holocaust cloak' is still okay, or whether it was ever okay, but William Goldman is Jewish, it was always lower-case h, and the word once just meant 'destruction caused by fire'. If anyone has any comments on that, please tell me, I'd like to know more.
John swallowed hard. The sun was coming up now, and he could see that they were alone on the rooftop. Not that that was really much help; his gun, after all, was in Moriarty's hand, and even his army training was unlikely to save him if he attacked Moriarty head on. Best to play along.
“Agreed. The only matter of any difficulty is the first dance. Sherlock insisted upon that tradition, but he seems rather stuck.”
Sherlock had spent the next three weeks doing the laundry.)
“You shouldn’t have to,” John said quietly. “Don’t you get it? There’s supposed to be talking and…baring of feelings, in relationships. You’ve told me about your family, and your nemeses, some of whom you think are your family" (Sherlock rolled his eyes)…"hell, you shared your whole world with me.”
“You’re afraid!” Martha accused him. “Ever since Prince Jamiarty fired you—”
Mycroft shook his head nearly imperceptibly. “Why don’t you two get settled aboard? We’re nearly ready to cast off.”
Except, apparently, that his grandfathers were in love.
The fire was lit in the grate, and Holmes blinked in surprise. Surely John wasn't still awake?
Sherlock smiled.
Warnings for a pretty nasty idea.
“The past cannot be undone,” Grezzik said quietly. “What has been done has been done. We need to think about the future.”
When Mycroft starts trying to exercise, it’s not to impress Greg. It’s to give them a few more years together.
And it hadn't.
Greg wasn’t stupid, though he was surprised. “You want me to be your best man?”
The story came out in broken phrases, combined with apologies and sobs. Sherlock barely heard half of it; he was too busy berating himself. Of course Moriarty would have chosen a case with children involved as his final touch—Donovan came from an abusive family, and she'd always had a soft spot for children. Of course Sally would have jumped at the chance to destroy him—she'd hated him from the first time they'd met, when he'd flirted with her for a chance to get into a crime scene, then cut her cold once Lestrade saw his talents and allowed him to consult. Of course Sally would believe 'Richard Brook', who hated Sherlock just as much and wanted to bring him down.
“Iocane,” the Prince said, sniffing Ireni’s corpse. “I’d bet my life on it. And the Princess’ footprints are fresh!”
Mycroft held out a hand, and Watson shook it. “You’re a brave man, Dr. Watson, and I wish that things might be easier for you and Sherlock. Though it’s rather unorthodox, I am glad that Sherlock has found you. He’s been happy in your friendship, but since your revelation he has been the happiest I have ever seen him. I will do what I can to ease your way.”
Mummy was also very understanding when Billy came creeping into her room at three in the morning that night, asking if he could stay to make sure nobody stole his necklace. Daddy was away, after all. He had to protect her. And her necklace.
Well…maybe he was. But only about John.
Jamiarty’s eyes went cold as he stared at the albino. “Your cousin must be disappointed.”
you two, can’t you wait for us one time?! You’re staying where I can see you.”), and watched the Eye revolve.
“Angelo?” John called.
Lestrade gave them a watery smile. “You both know that now; you’ve promised that today, and I know you’ve promised it for life. So let’s raise our glasses to the newlyweds, and let them have their first dance as husbands.”
Holmes smirked. “And that our hair is different.”
“No. And he doesn’t love me either.”
Ireni leapt to her feet. Sherlock craned his neck. There was only a little moon, but it was enough to see a ship not far beyond, cutting silently through the water. There was a man at the helm, dressed all in black.
“No sir,” Hopkins said, and he was blushing too now. “I’ll be going.”
“He knows.”
“Oh God…” Grandfather John didn’t speak for a moment. Billy heard a choked sob. Sickened, he stumbled away from the cottage. He couldn’t go in now, he had to give them some time, time to compose themselves.
“You don’t seem very interested, darling.”
The bird landed at the Cliff’s edge, and Grezzik dismounted. He got an armful of Molly.
“Do we have to have many?”
Ah, that made sense.
"What did Johnson say?" John asked tensely.
The woman threw the veil off and stood. The fiery passion that had twisted her face when we first met her had faded, and with her fair hair dyed it took a moment for me to recognize Miss Kitty Winter.
“Can I go for a walk?” he asked. “It’s stopped raining.”
“That was a warning. Where I come from there are penalties for liars.” He dragged Sherlock to his feet.
Sherlock realized he was gripping John’s hand too tightly. He tried to loosen his grip, but John hung on more tightly.
Mary came to love Sherlock—platonically, closer to a brother than a friend. She even managed to forgive him for loving John, and allowed them time alone. After all, she trusted her husband. (Watson never disappointed her).
The fog showed no sign of lifting, but the park lights were still shining brightly. In fact—Watson’s brows drew together—the lights seemed higher than usual, and they burned a strange colour, different from the low yellow he was accustomed to.
“I doubted you. I never should have.”
“With the understanding that, should the treaty be broken, repercussions will follow swiftly,” Janine answered. She didn’t like this at all—something was wrong.
Sherlock looked away.
“Thank you.”
Enter the albino! By the way, feel free to blame him for wanting to be a character, because that's why it took so long to post this story.
“Come on. We need to keep moving.”
Holmes goes on a rant, but as usual Watson doesn't have to say much to make him speechless.
I considered this for a moment. “Kitty’s a grown woman,” I said. “And unfortunately she may be a better judge of men than we can be.”
“You and I are both well aware that influence isn’t only parental.”
“I won’t kill you,” the count said. “You’re very brave. But I will give you a reminder to respect your betters.”
Sherlock, on the other hand, wouldn’t stop griping about the message they’d received, announcing Lord Moran’s visit. And it was killing John’s afterglow.
Sherlock rounded on him. Watson stood there, face patient, if a bit confused.
“Billy—” Grandfather Sherlock pressed his lips together, looking almost as if he might cry.
“We will rescue our people, of course,” Grezzik added. “And I swear that I will get the four of you home.” He looked at Ireni, Molly, and Sally holding Waverly. He missed Mycroft’s frightened look.
Kitty took Billy's face in her hands. "Listen to me, William John Hopkins, do you think the same God who made them, the same God who brought them together, would punish them for loving each other?"
They didn’t have to wait long. Less than twenty minutes later Stan and Kitty walked in, bundled up against the ridiculous snow storm outside.
“Can you tell where she is, Grezzik?” Miracle Max asked.
“How long?”
“You haven’t already guessed? Come now, we are both more intelligent…at least I believed so.”
“And the King is in the South,” Miracle Max muttered. “But if you have royal blood, you can challenge the prat for the throne.”
anniversary of Florin, which was when they would be married. It was the first time in the three years they’d known one another that they had proper conversations, and Sherlock found that he enjoyed them. There was more to running a kingdom than he thought, and learning about it from Jamiarty, who did know what he was talking about, was enjoyable.
“I am Princess Sherlock of London. This is my…my friend? Are we friends, Molly?”
“And you’re sure about that?”
“As you wish.”
“No, honestly, nothing’s wrong.” Watson wiped his eyes. “I just…today was wonderful.”
Quick sneak peek at the next month or so; a couple new SPN fics, the beginning of a Harry Potter series, and of course, more Sherlock, though I'm not sure when exactly (SEASON 4 STARTS TOMORROW CAN YOU BELIEVE IT I HOPE EVERYONE CAN WATCH IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE). And...well, I can't say too much, but it is a New Year, right? Good to start off with a bang.
“But Uncle Mycroft, you have to come back to London.” Rachel had solved the problem of what to call Mycroft when she first learned to talk, and the title never failed to make the old man smile.
Moran's broken his loyalty. But he's already done more damage...
Mike was in the cellar, checking the trap door, raising it and lowering it to make sure that it would be easy to lift no matter how tired or injured Sherlock might be. He didn't expect Moriarty to become physical, of course, but there was always that possibility. There could be some damage from the fire, as well.
The plan goes off well...until it doesn't.
“We’re not getting married, for God’s sake!”
Ah yes. He was married to a man of stories and songs.
“You’ve been confirmed, I take it?” Queen Chessa asked.
To Maria’s shock, the dead man’s voice spoke. “Truuuuuu loooooovvvvv.”
“I don’t think you need my help with that—”
But when were their lives ever ordinary?
Prince Jamiarty cried when he heard that his father had less than two years to live.
They popped the corks out on the balcony, sending them soaring onto the beach. According to Sherlock's calculations, they could go down to the beach tomorrow and pick them up just under one of the palm trees, well out of anyone's way. John just smiled and sipped the champagne.
It took a little over two months to get everything sorted. Mrs. Hudson was terribly sad to see them go, but it did allow her to move nearer to her sister’s home in Bath. She hugged them both goodbye, and Watson felt no shame in his tears as he bid her farewell. He couldn’t quite see whether Holmes was doing the same, but he had his suspicions.
“No, I will return by ship, your Highness.”
Princess Savira of Archenland had come on behalf of her husbands Roc and Rilian. She had the long hair of her people, but her purple eyes told of her Regalian heritage.
“Transport,” Sherlock grumbled.
“And Sherlock didn't do it? What a surprise. Don't bother with apologies, we're going to prove it if it's the last thing I do.”
“Mycroft wants us to join him on a case.”
“Yes, we noticed that your last birthday.”
“Well, let’s get on with it, then.” Jamiarty rolled his eyes.
“That’s not possible,” Stam whispered. “Everything?”
They didn't speak again, and against her will, Kitty did close her eyes.
Billy spun around, feeling guilty for some reason. “Hello, Grandfather Sherlock. I was just looking around.”
Sherlock knelt beside him again. “Lie still.” He filled a needle and injected it just below the wound. An icy coolness began to spread up his side. “I don’t know. You spoke to John that night, not me. Shouldn’t you be with him?”
“A marriage between men will never be recognized!” Holmes spat. Then he remembered a pale man in the mist asserting the exact opposite.
“You’ll be brilliant parents,” John said gruffly. “Don’t be stupid.”
“Very well.” Mycroft's eyebrows were drawn firmly together. “I will make preliminary arrangements. You will be told very little, John, to make your acting more natural. Will you agree to that?”
Philip had just kissed her hard, and then gone to wait by the docks. Sally didn’t really know what he was thinking.  He would be her King, or her Prince Consort, or something, and their child would be a Princess.
“There will never be a need.”
Sherlock studied him. "Ah," he said with some surprise. "You haven't been ready either, have you?"
“Of course,” Grandfather Sherlock said seriously. “You’re our best listener. Now, some of this might be hard to believe, but it is the truth and nothing but. Alright?”
Cheers,
“Come on, love, let’s go look.”
They arranged to meet up once Watson and Sherlock returned. John continued to read and Holmes finally succeeded in
“Of course not.” Lord Moran looked faintly horrified by the notion. “Now, your Highness, your Grace, will you agree?”
"What?!"
The witch was facing them, panting, her arms tight around the bundle.
John's voice still had that terrible tone in it, and Sherlock took his husband's hand. "You don't have to go in, dear. Anderson and I--"
"Why?"
“This plan was conceived several weeks before your...alteration of relationship with Sherlock,” Mycroft said. “When I discovered you were lovers Sherlock insisted that the plan would still work, but that you did not need to be involved. As it stands now, however, many of our alternatives have been made impossible and the remaining option isn't tasteful. Still, Sherlock wants you to know, John, and I do believe that is for the best.”
Holmes looked up through glassy eyes, the needle steady in his hand. “I believe today’s events warrant some kind of exception, Watson.”
“My love, I found him in the end. And if you’ll have me, I would like to stay with you now.”
"Mycroft doesn't like it, and I thought it'd give you one last chance to see it," John said innocently.
“Sally’s baby, or her sister?” Mycroft asked.
Riley’s wounds were bandaged, but the woman still looked unnaturally pale. Sally sat in front of her, Waverly in her arms. The others were gathered round, all watching. A ring of guards filled the rest of the room.
Hopefully that wasn't too dark, if so I apologize. I promise it gets lighter (and Kitty gets her revenge).
house. They’d finally done it.
“Molly! I need your help!”
“John, there's some kind of plan here.”
Within two hours, she, Stan and the children were on the train.
As a side note, those are not the last two chapters, I have one more after that.
“This doesn’t concern you, Martha!”
Apologies for the lateness of the chapter, I was away and didn't have time to finish editing last night. Hopefully this modern multi-parter makes up for it!
“John…”
John gestured to the sofa. "Right, I think we deserve an explanation."
"No, I want to go." Holmes folded his hands. "It's nothing, John."
John said nothing. He had nothing to be ashamed of as far as his sexual prowess, although he was certainly more used to being with women than men. But there was still that worry, that concern that although the physical side of things had been progressing slowly and with great enjoyment on both their parts, that if they went all the way that Sherlock would find him wanting. Because what was he, really, almost four years older than his partner, scarred and...ordinary.
The next morning Molly was one of the witnesses for the Sherriff. They all told the same story: the barmaid, Waverly, had screamed at her husband and his seven brothers, calling them out for their foul deeds against woman and man alike. She then placed a curse on each and every one, so that if they tried to hurt anyone, they would feel the injury upon themselves. The husband had tried to grab his wife and throw her to the ground, but Waverly remained in place, and the man fell, dashing his own brains against the ground. The brothers fled, howling, into the night.
“Oh, you’re not still trying to win, are you? Maybe I’ll let you.”
“I have nothing to give from that.”
“No,” Kitty said vehemently. “God, everyone thinks all we do is have rows, you must all be bloody shocked that we’re together at all!” Her hands clenched around the teacup.
“The rope will not be there when we get to the Cliffs,” Molly said. She was almost shouting over the noise of the waves. “But you are strong, and you can climb it, can’t you?”
…How is the castle guarded?”
Rachel came in first, trying not to weep, and Holmes held her tight, running a hand through her curls. "Little Rachel," he murmured. "Be good for your parents, alright? And keep dancing. I have no doubt you'll be a ballerina someday."
Cheers,
Sherlock stopped swimming. It didn’t help. The moon came shining down again, and he saw a large body move through the water not far from him.
Holmes blinked rapidly and wrapped his arms around Watson. There was no one to see them now—their nearest neighbour was almost two miles off. No one to barge in, no one to judge, no one to report them. They could share a room now without consequence, without fear of discovery as they had the few times they’d thrown caution to the winds.
"What d' you mean?"
“Hello! My name is
Molly and Gruner entered, talking quite cheerfully about a...child with crows? Sherlock had never seen the anime nor read the manga, but clearly Gruner liked Molly's ideas. Molly was flitting about the room quite naturally, exclaiming over different figurines and surreptitiously checking the bindings of the various books placed on high-quality shelves.
“And do both of you promise to keep your union sacred, to work to stay together, and to keep your lives intertwined?”
Watson reached out and touched his cheek. "Billy, lad…”
He closed his eyes, even though that made no difference, and went to sleep.
“I wonder if he is using the same wind that we’re using,” Maria mused as she moved the sails.
Mycroft sighed. “And of course, this is in the most melodramatic country on our continent.”
“You will not be in control. You're not a man who surrenders that easily.”
“It’s the only way I feel satisfied anymore.”
“That was a surprise,” Lestrade said, his voice thick.
“I thought it was a few weeks later,” John said quietly. “We did a raid close to Florin, and one of the treasures was an engagement ring. I questioned one of the sailors and he described…well, you. Said it was for the Prince’s bride to be, who loved him beyond measure. And I believed…oh, my dear, I’m sorry, I believed the worst of you. I just—I’m—”
“If you wish him dead, please keep moving.”
“Tell me when we’re fifty feet apart,” Grezzik replied. His back was starting to ache, and his knees protested every movement, but his arms were fine, and there was no time for this.
Maria started. The albino—Stam—was watching them both.
“Stam spoke to a guard on our way here. Apparently you never said I do, so if you never said it, it never happened.”
“At least you know now. Will you stop?”
“So much for not telling them anything dangerous.”
“Liar! Liar! Liar!”
“You would risk your lover's safety, Dr. Watson?” Mycroft's voice was cold and hard as steel. “If Moriarty's people see you running around the world, will they not find that suspicious? They might discover that Sherlock is alive, and then what?”
"Why not?"
Sherlock finally managed to calm himself. “What time is it?”
"It has nothing to do with you," John said hurriedly, hoping to erase some of Donovan's cruel words. "I just know...look, I'm ordinary, okay? I'm not exactly handsome and I'm too soft and I'm too quick to believe the best of people and I'm everything you consider weak, and I'm not saying that I want to change myself but...we're not really matched for life, are we? Definitely not as lovers. So don't fret about ending it, whenever you want. You've made me happy, Sherlock, and I hope I've done the same for you, but if you get tired of me just tell me, alright? Promise me you'll do me that courtesy?"
“My problem is that I don’t…well, I don’t feel the way other people do. My mother used to tell me someone had stolen my heart when I was a baby. I searched for years for a spell that could do that, to try and reverse it. But it was only a story, a metaphor for my lack of conscience. I used to feel badly about that, but I don’t anymore.”
"Or else what?
“You can die too for all I care!”
We're going to start going a bit off book now; you got a couple of glimpses of that this chapter. The big Princess Bride scenes will still be in it, but there'll be some new stuff.
“But how is that? He’s been marauding twenty years and you only left me three years ago.”
Holmes had taken the train up north, where he discovered to his great grief that Lord Conan had indeed been killed—at his own request. His eldest daughter, Holmes' friend long ago and now the mother of five, tearfully confessed to increasing the dosage of her father's medicine after he'd begged to be put out of his misery.  Holmes commiserated with her, covered up suspicion by announcing his fervent belief that the old man had died of a heart attack, and the doctor's incompetence had led to this suspicious atmosphere. How he'd wished that Watson could have been there.
“So I got into pre-med and became a surgeon, then I went to war. Why not? I wanted to do some good in the world, and it wasn’t like anyone would miss me. I did three years in Afghanistan, got shot, and flew into an airport with no one there to greet me.” John smiled, but it was shaky. “Then I met a madman and fell in love.”
“Grezzik!” Maria scolded.
“Nothing, love. Nothing.” John kissed him again. “I’m…I’m so happy. I’ve loved you so long, and I never thought you’d hear me.”
“Well isn’t that gracious,” John muttered.
“Are you sure?” Sally asked.
"That was one of Mrs. Hudson's best set," John clarified. He chuckled as Kitty and Stan's faces took on identical expressions of horror.
“Why do you do this? Have we met?”
John held him close, and Sherlock clung to him, shaking all over.
“We’ll have to be careful,” Sherlock said. “And we must swear now that we will not…we will not give in, no matter what.”
“He told me that he killed her when he was ten. She was seven. He knew that his stepmother couldn’t have kids, and she was a possible heir. He didn’t want her there, so he hunted a poisonous flower. The King thought she died of fever, which was more or less true, I suppose.”
That made little to no sense. But then again, nothing was making sense today. Sherlock allowed his head to drop against Grezzik’s shoulder, and decided that he was going to try and get all his thinking done. He doubted he’d have much more time.
Stan bit his lip. “Well, you’ll be changing your name anyways if you agree. And Kitty Winter is just as pretty a name as Kitty Watson, though I like Kitty Hopkins better.”
John blinked in surprise.
Watson smiled sleepily, reaching out a hand and caressing Sherlock's face. "Knew you would be. I got Christmas ready for you."
Kitty's got an important question for her dads, about a question she has for Stan.
“Thank you,” he said, and Watson was sure, now.
is generally around Florin this time of year. We’ll deliver the message, and if John wants you, I’ll send you the best of wedding gifts.” Jamiarty hesitated. “If not…well. I’m afraid I may have gone back on our bargain, Sherlock. I have developed feelings for you. I have been trying to learn to be a good husband, for you. If John says no…will you consider me as an alternative to suicide?”
John pondered for a second. “Alright. Here, help me up. Did anyone grab my sword?”
“I did that on purpose,” Grezzik said, getting up from behind the boulder. “I didn’t have to miss.”
The woman threw her hood back.
“You were his jailer.”
“Precisely.” The dim light from the street lamps still showed the fond expression on Sherlock's face. “You've always had a way with words, Doctor.”
“It’s nothing. Just a bit sore.”
Watson shook his head and chuckled.
John reached out and took his lover’s hands. “Then whatever remains must be improbable. I understand. But have we examined everything?”
“It clearly caused you discomfort,” Sherlock frowned. “Why is that unfair?”
Maria knelt, to check that he was truly gone. Her head was swimming now, and the pain was coming back, but he was dead and gone and her wound was not fatal after all.
Had Sherlock found him?
“I am not.” Holmes held out the telegram and Watson examined it.
"Then don't," Kitty replied, pulling him close again. "Because they won't, you see. They'll be in Heaven, or no one ever goes there."
Stan stared at her. “The Kitty Winter…”
“The chocolate makes it go down easier,” Martha said distractedly. She was holding John’s hand as she brushed the pill, covering it carefully. “What’s the news from the castle?”
"Well, that's the bit that's rather tricky to explain," David answered. "To put it simply, you won't. When you go to see them, they'll be perfectly happy to see you, you can stay as long as you like, do whatever you like, and when you want to go somewhere else, you can. You could spend the equivalent of a hundred Earth years having tea with Mrs. Hudson, for instance, and still come back to your husband as though you'd been gone only a moment."
“John, we need to come up with something!”
The engagement is officially announced, but Sherlock runs into some trouble on his ride.
"We'll go together, dear heart. I know we will."
“Sherlock, I’m…I’m sorry dear.”
“We've got to go.”
It was Cerise. Sally didn’t stop—couldn’t stop—but she didn’t have to. Her aunt’s arms were swathed in bandages, but there was fire in her eyes.
"I know what you mean. I suppose we're just Holmes-sexual." A beat passed. "Shoot me for saying that. Immediately."
“Splendid. Are you sure you don’t want tea?”
A groan came from Anderson. “No, oh
Moran and Riley have come to London. Two will leave, but it won't be the original two...
“I don’t want your love.”
Kitty hadn't had much nurse training, but she followed Watson's feverish instructions as best as she could. There wasn't much she could do anyways; she'd never felt so helpless. Logic wouldn't help here, nor love. Her fathers were racked by coughs and pain, and all she could do was try to keep them cool and hydrated.
Kitty twisted her hair. "Well...it's just that...it wasn't all to keep it a secret."
"Not really," John managed as Sherlock trailed kisses down his neck. "What about you? We can go to sleep?"
John stared at Sherlock in shock. “Right, so they do exist.”
“You always were a coward, Jamiarty.” King Lotharon shook his head. “You forfeited your right to die when you took your sister’s right to live. You are going to live a long, healthy life, alone with your cowardice and failure. ”
John watched Sherlock open his mouth, then look at him. As their eyes met, John shook his head.
“It’s only been there for about an hour,” Anderson mumbled. His face was gray in the half-light. “We need to keep moving.”
"I just meant...Look, I'm sorry, I don't know what I meant. But I swear there's no pity there. The only person I've ever pitied is dead, and I doubt you're anything like him."
Sherlock broke the silence. “I’m sorry.”
Mrs. Hudson came up the stairs, leading Molly, Mike, Lily and Jacob. “Hello, everyone!”
"Excuse me?"
"Of course it's me! Who did you think it was?"
"Three months on Tuesday," John said evenly. "What exactly does that have to do with you? Or anything?"
John put a hand on his shoulder, but it was trembling.
Two years after his marriage, John receives a call from his sister. Harry calls from a rehab clinic and shares some stories about their childhood that John was too young to remember, stories that make some of her behaviour make more sense. It’s not an excuse, and it’s a long road to reconciliation, but the Watsons do, eventually, start to feel like siblings.
“We’re going to Florin, remember?”
“His opponent was about three feet shorter than him,” Jamiarty declared, standing. “He can’t possibly be that dangerous. No, we need to track the Princess. We may be his only hope. And if he dies…well. Guilder will pay.”
“I don’t envy your headache. In the meantime, sleep well.”
Did she even deserve to take the throne?
“We could stand to bear a little more west, but we’re making decent progress.”
He certainly didn't hear the quiet swish of a baton coming down on his head.
“If Jamiarty is a murderer, we have reason to depose him,” Janine said.
“There’s no one here.”
Greg whistled. “Blimey, that’s a real small wedding. My sister had a ‘small’ wedding that was over a hundred.” A thought occurred. “Are you going to have attendants?”
Waverly knew that Uncle John used to be a pirate, and Uncle Sherlock used to be a Princess. She didn’t really understand how that had changed, or what exactly a ‘Carrier’ was—her mother used to be one, that was for sure, but she wasn’t quite sure of the purpose. Mama and Papa had said that heirs could be adopted when they became King and Queen. Grandfather agreed, and delighted in all their grandchildren, blood and adopted. Abdication agreed with him and Grandmother.
“Then why is there fear behind your eyes?” Sherlock challenged him.
“So long as we can do the explosions as well,” Sherlock said. “They won’t be too loud.”
poured through his body. John’s eyes flew open, his body jerked in the chains…he couldn’t see, couldn’t hear, he couldn’t stop himself from screaming, but screaming brought no relief…
John spun around to find Sherlock towering over him, glaring at Donovan, face twisted in a snarl.
Holmes smiled. “My dear Watson, I will take no replacement. Nor will I go out alone.”
“Shouldn’t you ask me something first?”
“Why was your daughter not buried in the royal crypt?”
He walked down the hall, and knocked on Jamiarty’s door.
As the giant began to follow Ireni, taking tiny steps so not to overtake the woman, Sherlock couldn’t resist asking a question.
The two of them went downstairs together. As I heard the front door close, Holmes sprang to the window. “They’re walking arm in arm, John!”
It only took a few moments to get the other Carriers loose.
“Why are we at Lauriston Gardens, Sherlock?”
“Clever Sherlock,” John said, just as he used to.
“I believe Mrs. Hopkins directed the majority of the operations,” Holmes replied. “She’s got quite an eye.”
“You’ll find someone,” John comforted her.
Maria lost track of the names of her moves, the styles she should employ. For the first time in twenty years, she was going purely on instinct, and all she could do was keep moving, not drop her blade, and pray that her instincts had been trained enough.
Holmes never replaced them.
Mycroft went still. “What?”
Cheers,
"It's certainly milder than we were led to believe," Holmes said. "This room is perfectly lovely. The bed is soft, it appears that all of our favourite books are on the shelves, and—" he let out an exclamation of joy and rushed to the window seat, where a violin case lay. He opened it. "John, it's my Stradivarius, only...goodness, it looks brand new!"
“And yet here we are, two men who already live together have decided to embark on a romantic relationship. You’ve already done things out of conventional style, so…”
“He’s been up there for close to an hour.”
“Aaargh!”
"He wants me to jump. And he wants you to watch."
“Darling,” she called out, loud as anything, “why don’t you go and fetch your brothers? We should have a family party.”
"No I'm not," John protested.
New Scotland Yard was bracing itself. All the files were triple checked, open cases were worked on with feverish intensity, and all the coffee had disappeared. Some of the people in the holding cells were infected by the mood too, insisting on confessing.
John swallowed his nausea. It had been his idea to include Greg, his insistence that the DI was their friend and he deserved to know at least part of the plan. They'd told him late at night, near one in the morning. He had thought Donovan had left with Anderson. His mistake.
"It must not exist then."
The immediate aftermath of St. Bart's.
“Shall we go to the Savoy on my last long-winded epistle?”
Some excerpts from the diary of Dr. Watson, concerning Miss Kitty W.
Kitty Winter hardly remembers being Kate Summers. Her old life was so long ago it feels like a different person. That’s part of why she understands Stan so well.
What really remained from Lestrade was his daughter, his five sobbing grandchildren, and a stack of letters bound with a blue ribbon and kept in a safe. Those were his friend’s, his love’s remains. He would hold them sacred.
“Yes. The…the presence…it was female. She promised she would help.”
Watson smiled. "You've got a healthy son, Stanley Hopkins. Would you like to see him?"
“Molly.” Pained as she was, Molly smiled. “It’s good to see you safe, Princess.”
(See the end of the chapter for
For a second, the witch faltered. Grezzik watched her indecision go across her face.
“No more rhymes now, I mean it!”
The old woman smiled. “You, dear, have your own weapons. You will find your truth one day, and your justice. This one needs help, but she must do it on her own.”
They finally drew up to a small brick cottage, perched about one hundred yards from a cliff. The door was a soft gray, and the curtains in the open windows were a muted yellow. A stone path led to the front door. Holmes helped Watson out of the carriage and threw the boy a pound coin. As he drove off they stood together, looking at their new home.
“Part of the plan, John.”
Mycroft waved a hand, trying his best to shake the strange feeling. “Not all, Inspector. May I offer you some tea?”
"What is it?" Holmes asked with no small amount of impatience.
“Mycroft? You’ve…come down to the docks?” Sherlock sounded stunned. “That’s leg work!”
Sherlock put his laptop down. “If it was just dropping in, then why didn’t they just do it? They’re home now, they live just down the road. No, something’s up.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“She tossed the baby off the Cliffs of Insanity, and Grezzik seemed to think he could fly,” the woman cut in. “Luckily, I
"Come on dear, stand up," John said gently. "I'll guide you down, we'll get you home alright."
Ireni wanted that trust.
As he put on the kettle for chamomile, the smile faded without him noticing. It wasn’t until his husband wrapped his arms around him from behind that Watson even realized he was crying.
“You are not,” John said sternly. He kissed Sherlock—he’d mastered the art of doing that in the dark. “I am so in love with you, Sherlock. You are the most important person in my life, and everything you are is wonderful. I’m not going to leave you. Is that part of what the drug made you feel?”
Only that’s not what happened next.
“Who are you?”
“I’m not there yet,” the bishop said.
Maria saluted them with her sword, and they disappeared into the forest.
“You don’t?” The man’s eyes were intense, and Prince Jamiarty grinned. This one was perfect.
“Yeah. Molly was very kind and got me an exam so we won’t be wasting any time—I’m fertile enough that it hopefully won’t take too many tries. We started looking through potential donors today.”
Neither did Janine. Her father and mother did most of the judgement in the capital, especially now that she was ambassador to London. She just didn’t want to make people do things.
Sally tried to sip at it. It went down easily enough, but she couldn’t taste it.
Molly put the miracle pill between John’s lips. Then she frowned. “We’ll have to force feed him. Hold him steady.”
Miracle Max brushed him off. “Take care of John. Give him the pill in half an hour, for full potency.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“And lastly,” Holmes said, “I cannot imagine accepting such an honour when I know several men and even women who deserve it more than I do. Highest on that list, of course, is the man who sits in front of me and had just as much to do with saving those children as I did. Perhaps more.”
But he wasn’t, and his prize was still ahead…
“That might be better.”
“How bad is it?” Watson asked. He could, of course, look himself, but he wanted this Sherlock, like his own, to tell him. Lie to him.
“You’re quick.”
It seemed an instant later when she was shaken awake by Grezzik. “We’re leaving now,” the giant said. He lifted her onto her horse, and Sally winced. Her legs were aching, and her scars ached.
“Seeing as I'm currently a fugitive, I don't think that's a good idea.”
He’d avoided suicide before, he wouldn’t do it again.
“No light source. It was
“Maybe she lied to you, like you were lying to her.” Sally’s tears were drying. “She took our daughter, Philip, obviously she was lying!” Her voice was rising into a scream.
"Where's your boyfriend?" Donovan asked. Her lips were twitching, like she could see the last hider in Hide-and-Seek but didn't want to give the game away just yet. "Shouldn't you be attached to his hip?"
"Stamford?" Watson asked blankly.
“Every ship but your four fastest,” Sherlock corrected.
“Oh, it was with myself. Before I proposed to your Dad.” Sherlock ran his fingers over John’s wedding ring.
Raz pressed his lips together. “I’m surprised you don’t know already. The whole castle’s been talking about it.”
In a little house in the quiet part of London, a woman was screaming.
Sherlock nodded. “Yes, Mrs. Hudson. There’s nothing to worry about any more. Nothing at all.”
She let Mrs. Forrester fuss with her bouquet, took Mr. Forrester’s arm, and walked down the aisle towards John, whose eyes were shining with tears of joy.
“And really,” Lestrade continued. “That was all I needed to know. Of course, you have both changed since then. John’s not so grouchy anymore, has lost the cane and is no longer a stranger—though you are still quite short mate, no offense.” (John shook his fist at Lestrade but he was smiling). “And Sherlock’s gone from some imperious, insane know-it-all to one of my best friends, who happens to be an imperious, insane know-it-all.”
Molly didn’t say anything. She agreed with it so far.
Neither Holmes was religious, but Rachel knew the secret of their love, the strange dream they'd had years before. She wondered whether that meant that her grandads were still together, somehow. If someone had gone to all the effort of having them meet, why wouldn't they stay together beyond a lifetime? Wasn't that logical?
It took a few moments to coax her out of her swoon, but when she was more alert Molly seemed calm. “That’s a shock,” she managed. “How?”
“Prince Jamiarty of Florin, you are charged with the murder of Carla, daughter of the King. You are further charged with treason, and the attempted murder of the King, and his Heir, Sally, Princess of Florin.”
David laughed. "Oh, I am glad this is working out. It was my idea, you see, to have the four of you in the same place. I think we got the details right, is there anything else you want?"
“All due respect, your Majesty, but we don’t have much time. Sally and Waverly need to be safe, and the only way that can be done is to prove Jamiarty guilty.”
“We can’t keep wearing those.”
Maria answered. “I’m hoping he will help.”
The song did not end with the written version. After all, its title was
Cheers,
“I’m here, love,” John whispered. “I’m right here.”
"Oh God," John whispered. "His wives..."
They'd been flying for what felt like a week and John itched to get off the plane. Part of it was sheer discomfort, of course. The person in front of them had their seat reclined too far, his clothes were perfect for a Bermudan night but not quite for the chill of an aeroplane, and above all he was exhausted. He hadn't slept well the night before.
; how could he have been so stupid? “Where is John, Sally?”
Sherlock opened his eyes and stared up at John. It was deeply unsettling, partly because John was never taller than Sherlock, and partly because the grief in Sherlock's eyes was greater than anything he'd ever seen.
There was a moment of silence.
Kitty rolled her eyes and leaned her head on Sherlock's shoulder. "Yes, Da."
(See the end of the chapter for
Once they were upstairs, they broke into a run without speaking, dashing through the halls and secret passages until they were outside once more. Sherlock didn’t stop until they reached the trees, and then he slumped against a tall one, hand on his chest.
"Then I'll be right here to make it better," John promised. Still touching Sherlock, he moved quickly around the bed and got in under the covers, spooning Sherlock from behind. "I'm right here, dear. I'm sorry you're in pain. Don't worry."
“Let’s just say that Jamiarty has reason to fear one of the Carriers. She holds a secret that will bring him down. But I can’t tell you anymore. Just…stay here. For now. And if you hear a row in the next day or so…” Sherlock lowered his voice. “Get to the Throne Room.”
"Stay still!" John said urgently, his eyes flicking between Sherlock and the surrounding buildings, searching desperately for a sign of the sniper. If he could just protect Sherlock...there were a thousand words between them, a thousand memories that even Moriarty knew nothing for. Maybe he could find a way to warn him.
Sherlock leaned in and kissed him again, slow and sweet. John leaned against the wall, trying to stay upright.
“It’s brilliant!” he cried.
“Yeah, but I didn’t even ask if you were interested in my life before you, I just didn’t say anything and let your deductions be enough. That wasn’t fair to you.”
“Why not?” Sherlock asked, stepping forward, away from the knives. “You can’t hurt me. John and I are bound by love, and you can’t break that with a thousand swords. It’s the two of us against the rest of the world, and always will be. And when I say you are a coward, it’s because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth, no matter how often you hunt!”
“I love to read.” Watson looked up in him. The flickering light brought storms into his eyes, though they were still kind. “There’s so much I want to know.”
Warnings for non-graphic childbirth, I guess? And domestic abuse (in a flashback, not to any of the main characters).
“I am going to
The man in black looked down. “I know what that’s like. What happened to your father?”
Waverly was peering, fascinated, at a line of ants on the ground. She babbled and pointed at them.
Waverly shifted in her arms, and Sally tightened her hold. She had no illusions about Jamiarty now; if she did ascend to the throne, she and Waverly (and Philip too, no doubt) would be targets. Only Jamiarty’s imprisonment would protect them.
Cheers, Acme
“What’s her name?”
Sherlock was a strong swimmer (push away the memory of why, the first time he’d ever made John laugh when they were children), and he started swimming as quietly as he could.
“And who are the lucky couple?” Holmes yawned, relieved. “Jack the Ripper and Amelia Sach?”
John leaned his forehead against their bedroom wall and groaned.
“You’re speaking to the future Prince Consort,” John interrupted. He let a smile show. “There’s no need to worry about Jamiarty anymore.”
Watson held his husband tightly, stroking his thinning hair as they stood in their room.
“What’s the matter?” Ireni snapped. “I like it, and you don’t have to drink it, your Highness.” She finished pouring and corked the bottle.
And Sally ran. The group of people parted, holding back the few guards who were trying to get to them. One strong one knocked a lord to the ground and made for Sally, but Molly’s sword flashed and he retreated, howling.
Hope you all enjoyed! This Wednesday's update may be a bit short (I won't have a lot of time for writing because I've been working on this), but we'll be back to regular length next week.
Kitty and Stan have met. John and Sherlock need to invest in earplugs (not for the reason you think).
It was a clear day in London, with the slightest crisp edge to the breeze. Fall was on its way, and Sherlock wore a thicker cloak than he was used to. Luckily moonblossoms bloomed all the year, even as far north as London. When Sherlock had dreamed about his and John’s wedding long ago, for the couple of months they were in love and happy and John hadn’t been captured by pirates, there were always moonblossoms.
Several miles away, Maria Montoya wandered in the darkness, head throbbing and unsure how to get back. They would meet back at the beginning. They always did.
Holmes suggests a walk in the park...at two in the morning.
“Of course. By the window, if we could?” John asked.
“She’s fine,” Ireni confirmed. “So what do you need from me? Let’s get the bastard.”
“I don’t know,” John said. “You tell me.”
“You’re looking well, your Majesty,” Max said politely.
“I’m not having you get ill when you’re already taxing your body,” he told her. “Relax. The world isn’t going to end because you can’t consult.”
Greg laughed. “You might need a moment to recover there, mate.” He smiled up at his Mycroft. “It certainly was a surprise for us. We didn’t get together until after those two got married.”
“You can’t hurt John,” Molly said immediately. “He and Sherlock are happy now.”
Without another word he leapt back out the window, jumped carefully off the shed and took off in pursuit.
Lestrade shrugged. “I’ve known for years, Mr. Holmes. Besides, someone had to keep an eye on Hopkins.”
“Go faster, Grezzik!” Ireni snarled.
"Snog or break something?" Sherlock asked bluntly.
Maria leaned her head against the wall, the cool stone wall for one moment. One last moment, before one last try.
Jacob was already at Sherlock’s side, chattering about the latest explosion he’d caused in class. The glee in Rachel’s eyes reminded John to warn Kitty that her daughter needed to be kept away from baking soda and vinegar (at the very least).
Mycroft is secretly delighted by his desk job, not the least because it means he can wear his wedding ring without worrying about losing it.
Sometimes the greatest similarities lie in the greatest differences.
“I can’t feel my arms,” she whispered. “I can’t feel them, I can’t lift them!”
John held him as tightly as he could, standing just a bit on tiptoe to make sure that Sherlock felt as safe as possible. “It’s drugs, dear,” he whispered. “It has to be.”
Kitty and Stan were...John blinked. Blinked again.
Kitty patted his arm. “Well you are rather brilliant. You should be able to keep up.”
Holmes choked on a sob of laughter. “Oh, I forgot, I have managed to hide that from you. Yes, John, the cocaine is a distraction, a game when I’m bored, but it also makes me think…and that’s all I can do, think and puzzle and deduce until I am too exhausted to feel.”
“I thought I was going faster,” Grezzik protested.
A few thoughts on the lovely couple of Kitty and Stan, now known as Winkin.
Moran nodded. “She brought Riley to the dungeon, and left. She would have reached Florin by midnight.”
Everyone starts on their journeys. Sherlock, John and Anderson make their way through the forest, and Anderson shares some fears.
LOOK IT'S CANON OKAY I CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
“Then carry your burden.”
John’s lips tightened.
John nodded. “Come on love,” he told Sherlock. “Where’s the quietest place to sleep?”
“I would never have done it if I’d known his precious Princess had a homicidal boyfriend.”
“I’m not a witch, I’m your wife!” The woman was shaking with indignation. “True love, he said true love, Max!”
Watson didn’t have time to ask before he felt Holmes lie down beside him, drawing the blankets up.
“The Prince and the Count want you at full physical health before they start in on you.”
The telegram came early that morning. Holmes had just finished a hasty breakfast when Mrs. Hudson laid it on the table. “It’s from your brother, Mr. Holmes,” she said.
When he opened them again, it was because Sherlock was pulling at his arm. “John, wake up, we’re here!”
"I told you. Kitty. Kitty Winter."
Mycroft cleared his throat. “Little brother.”
, she thought.
“Come off it. Sherlock would have proposed to John years ago, never mind if their marriage was legal. That would have been more fun for him. But it would have bothered John, and he knew it. So he could have been persuaded to wait…especially if a certain high-up in the government told him it was being worked on.”
Kitty fumed, but she eventually gave in, helped along by Mycroft agreeing to step in. She spent most of her maternity leave at Molly’s, looking after the children. Stan painted the spare bedroom a bright, cheerful jungle, with animals peeking out from the trees.
“It went through,” Sherlock said. “It’s legal now, John. We can get married here, if you like. Unless you want to go elsewhere—”
"It's—Greg, I thought we were friends."
Cheers, Acme.
Sherlock smiled at me. It’s infuriating when he does that; he is so pleased about surprising me that he forgets that I might actually have benefited from understanding the whole situation.
. Sherlock wanted very badly to protest this arrangement, but got caught up in the spy story. (He did not ‘have a spy thing’, not at all. John was simply extrapolating from two film preferences, and anyways, John had chosen the films, hadn’t he?)
“Sherlock?” John asked. A look of horror came onto his face. “Oh my dear, you weren’t thinking…”
"Was grieving and didn't want to spoil my holiday?"
He approached her, and Maria tried to raise her sword, but she fell back again with a cry of pain.
Sherlock swept the glass up while John gave Kitty a cursory examination. There were a few pieces of glass in her hair, but besides a few cuts and her bad ankle—which she allowed him to wrap with great reluctance—she was mostly uninjured from her defenestration. No, John thought, wrong word. What on earth is the opposite of defenestration?
"Do you think we can actually get him?" Kitty asked.
Footsteps on the stairs announced Anderson’s arrival. He was carrying a small, soft bag. Sally met him at the foot, Waverly strapped to her chest, and Anderson held them tight. “You’ll be alright, my love,” he whispered. “Take care of our girl, and I will see you soon.” He kissed her hand. “My Queen.”
“No one told me, dear one. I know your promises matter to you deeply, so I know what’s in your mind. But I would still like to be asked properly.”
“You’ve heard of Sappho
“Of course you will,” Sherlock said soothingly. “Now come and sit down.”
“Meanwhile, Molly, you and Grezzik will run with Sally and the King to the Heir place. Try to avoid fatalities if you can, you’re good at that. Queen Bella will stay here with Waverly, to make sure that she’s safe.”
“You did nothing of the kind,” Michele whispered. “You are a child.”
“You call yourself a giant? A strong man? And yet the man is gaining on us!”
, the voice in his head whispered knowingly, sounding horribly like his father.
Molly never found the woman, no matter how long she looked. She left America after, but she kept her ears open thereafter, waiting for more stories of Invasion. A few came, and the elements were always the same: it was done for a person in desperate need of help, it was done by magic, and it was only done when intentions were pure.
Sherlock kissed John, and for a moment they were young again, having their first kiss and feeling whole for the first time.
“You’re doing your best,” John replied. “It takes effort, you know.”
Watson just waved his hand. “You mean now that we've both given up unhealthy vices? I quite agree. But you were saying?”
Molly let Anderson take her place, and went to help Martha with the poultices.
Holmes placed a hand on his shoulder, and Watson covered it with his own. "I'm alright," he whispered, knowing his husband's worry. "She is going to be alright, the baby is well, and...it's not like the last time."
“No, they’re just comfortable. I think people will wear them more in the future.” The man in black made a lunging movement. Grezzik reached his hands up to catch him, but the man in black bounded off a rock, somersaulted over Grezzik and, before the giant could turn, he was on his back, arms wound around his neck.
As she turned back to Gruner and held out the manga Sherlock had given her, Sherlock saw her hand drift to her right, and he spotted it. An old, velvet covered book alone on a shabby cushion. Now Molly would feign having to go out to her car to get the rest of her items, and Gruner would follow.
Watson threw the door open. “Sherlock?”
“They are,” John agreed, tucking himself closer to Sherlock. “God knows how they managed it.”
Sherlock blinked, squinting again. "I...."
When he woke he screwed his eyes shut again immediately—bright sunlight was pouring in from somewhere nearby. Where was he now?
John listened for retching, but he heard a very different sound.
“Of course I am. Even Sicilians don’t like to owe anything.”
Cheers,
Nope. Not a chance.
The day that Watson told her about his love for Holmes he was on morphine from a stabbing, and he doesn’t remember. Mrs. Hudson immediately hunted down the detective and demanded he take care of her boy. She also begins a rumour that gives Holmes a mistress, which few believe but it gives Watson a good laugh.
There was a pause. “The bloody hell it is.”
John took a deep breath. “I don’t think I’m ready…to go into all of it.”
One last night in each other's arms.
“And what if you died on your black-ops mission?” John whispered, voice breaking as he put his hand over Sherlock's. “Would that be Mycroft's job? 'Sorry, Sherlock's dead for real this time, and he never explained his plan to your face'.”
The first lie he’d told himself.
“What was that for?”
“You’re clever,” Sherlock breathed. “Really, really clever.”
Sherlock Holmes was not a stupid man. He knew the way most would react to his and John’s love. They were abominations, freaks. No matter how much their family told them their love was alright and protected their secret, he knew they still considered it odd. Born in the wrong time, the wrong place, the two of them were trapped among those who would never accept them as normal.
“I am a commoner, your Highness.”
The mourners took comfort in that as they scattered the mingled ashes, half at the beautiful cottage that belonged to Kitty and Stan now, and half through the streets of London.
It was a summer night in 1903, the sky deeply black and sprinkled with stars, when Watson was shaken awake by Holmes.
John loved her dearly—even she who’d never been in love before knew that. And she loved him desperately and truly…he was her ideal, her partner. They would get married and have children, build a little family. Live happily ever after.
"And if they're not?" Sherlock's voice was a broken whisper. "Sleep usually cures it, but not always."
“We’ll rest soon,” Grezzik promised her. “I know we’ve been riding for quite a while.”
Max pursed his lips. “You know I perform…miracles, of a sort. And to do that, I dabble in magic. But Martha’s not a witch, and I can’t even conjure fire. I don’t understand magic, because I never needed to. I can recognize it though, and the bond between Grezzik and your daughter is through magic. Bolstered by love, certainly, but the connection is magical. He has become her Guardian.”
Molly shuddered. She’d fight like an animal if she was chained like that, but Jamiarty was completely still. In fact, he looked bored.
Cheers!
“I ought to be after twenty years.”
John had spoken to both of them quite sternly about professionalism and politeness, and to a certain extent had succeeded. Until, of course, Sherlock had tried to help, and managed to insult both of them by saying that they were behaving like children. Kitty had taken this to mean that her insults weren't up to snuff—Stan had been furious to be called a child.
(See the end of the chapter for
John couldn't help it--he barked out a laugh. "Have you been reading those magazines again?"
“I felt so terribly for my son, watching his sister die, that I never told him about you. You were still so small, not quite three, and—” the King sighed. “Then I received the letter.”
“Da, that’s illegal!”
In terror, and hopelessness, and helplessness, and agony so great he still couldn’t quite catch his breath, John sobbed.
“It’ll be hard at first, Sherlock. I know how to work. I want to work for you.” John started to pack. “I’ll go to Marseille and I’ll get on a boat and go to America. There’s so much to see there, Sherlock! So many wonderful things…and I’ll work twenty hours a day and write you once a week until I can send for you. We’ll have our own place, a little house that we can come back to after adventures.”
Girls wanted marriage and babies and all sorts of boring things. He wanted adventure, he wanted to learn, he wanted to run away and never come back to this farm.
“Right. Well, you’ve heard the first part of it already. My saying ‘please’ did happen, and it intrigued Roberts, as did my description of your beauty. Finally he said ‘alright Watson, never had a valet, why don’t we try that for one night? If it doesn’t work, I’ll kill you in the morning.’ Luckily for me, his first mate had a tooth ache, and I managed to help pull the tooth. So he let me live, and I kept treating people. Terrible health care on a pirate ship.”
Ah, that was Sherlock all over. Simple, direct…and enough love in his voice to break your heart. “I dunno. Unless you can somehow tell me how to get out. Trouble is it’s pitch black there, and I was unconscious when they put me in.”
“Well now, Miss Winter, have you made a decision?”
“It could, if you like.”
While the three were watching the boat, Sherlock saw his chance. He dove off the deck into the water.
This time, John was alright with following orders. Sherlock looked half-dead on his feet, and they both needed some quiet.
anniversary was still almost three weeks away, and there was still much negotiation to be done.
Sally peeked out from behind the courtyard post. “You’re leaving too?”
“Hello John,” Greg said cheerily. “What are we having?”
“You continue to believe that if it gives you peace of mind,” Holmes answered.
Stark didn’t take another; Sherlock saw to that. One swift blow to the head knocked the man flying, and Sherlock had his gun’s safety off before John stopped him.
“You’re right, Anderson. You are quite often, you know.” Sherlock looked at him thoughtfully. “All we can do now is try and delay things, until Sally and the others have a chance to get back.”
They were alarming, these changes. How could love show itself so clearly upon a human face and not be seen or misconstrued? As a practiced observer, Holmes knew that each of these traits—bright, inquisitive eyes that followed the beloved, smiling more in joy, worry being kept to a minimum, interest in life encouraging better nutrition—each of them added a part to a final, incontrovertible deduction. The man was in love, obviously. Holmes knew that there were policemen who could deduce as much, stupid as they were, and that worried him. Was it obvious that Watson had an object of affection? Was it obvious, God forbid, that it was him?
"I am so glad," Holmes murmured. "Let's go meet this baby, shall we?"
Hope you all enjoyed, and look out for a special multi-part story next week that’s a long time coming. I owe you, after all.
The Man in Black encounters a giant.
This time it was dreamless until he woke in Holmes’ room at Baker Street to bandaged ribs, a sleep-deprived husband and a saint of a landlady who could provide a spectacular breakfast at a moment’s notice.
“I dunno, maybe.” Kitty was quiet. “I’ve always loved looking through bridal magazines. I know, I know, I’m a discredit to feminism—”
But while he and John held hands by the fire, Billy said goodnight and threw his arms around his neck the same way he’d done ever since he could crawl, and Sherlock Holmes felt completely and totally normal.
Anderson advanced on her. “Hold your tongue.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The room was clearly well-loved, well-used…people lived here.
“So you haven’t…you don’t want to kill the child you have. Or you would have done it quicker.” Sherlock’s voice faltered, but he pressed on. “And you don’t want the child held for ransom either, or you would be bringing it to your friend. No, you want to keep the child alive and with you. And you’re aware of how old the child is, or nearly. Babies that age can’t go for very long without provisions.”
Lestrade smiled wryly. “If you mean do I approve of this relationship, then yes, obviously, I wouldn’t be here if not. I just…who is my husband?”
“Carla and Jamiarty were on a trip with me. You were ill with a cold, Sally, or I would have brought you too.” The King took his wife’s hand. “Before Bella came into my life, I missed my wife terribly, and being around my children—all my children—made me feel more sane. But while we were away, Carla became ill too. At first I thought she caught your cold. But she faded away much faster than any cold I’ve ever seen. There was no time to send for Miracle Max, and by the time we reached the edge of the Capital, she was…she was gone.”
