“I’ll let you guys know if there’s any change.” Dean called after Sam’s retreating form. He sat back by Cas’s side, comforted only an ounce by the knowledge of what this was. He held onto Cas’s hand as he looked back to find Gabriel looking pensive. “So, about this spell.”
“Don’t you know? Groupies give the best blowjobs.” Dean took Cas in his hand then, leaning in slightly to run his flattened tongue along the underside of Cas’s cock. The sound that escaped his love’s throat was downright immoral and it only spurred Dean on. He swirled the tip of his tongue around the head of Cas’s cock before taking him into his mouth.
But then Cas did the unexpected. The guitarist handed off his guitar to Cas, who slipped the strap around his shoulders naturally, like he had done it a thousand times before. Dean heard Sam try to ask Dean if he knew what Cas was doing, but the elder Winchester just waved him away. There was nothing in this world that could make Dean take his attention off Cas in that moment. The sassy smile was back on his lips as he approached the mic a second time, but Dean could sense a small bit of nervousness that hadn’t been there with the first performance. What
Dean pulled his head up with a tired smile. “It’s just been a long day.” Dean paused, leaning in to kiss Cas slow and deep. Cas would never get tired of that man, no matter how long he lived on the earth. The smile was wider when Dean pulled back. “A good day, for sure, but long.”
Dean suddenly sent a horribly skeptical look at Sam, which just fueled the humor Sam felt at their upcoming situation. “And let me guess:  in order for us to gank whatever is doing this, I’m guessing one of us is gonna have to be crowned ‘Karaoke King’, right, Sammy?” Dean looked downright unamused, which of course Sam had to take advantage of. It was his Chuck-given right as the younger brother.
Cas twisted the ring on his finger absently, a smile on his lips at the memory of Dean’s gift this Christmas. Dean had always talked about forever since they had begun their relationship officially, but Cas had been honestly shocked when Dean had presented him with a simple band this morning before their entire family, proclaiming he needed to make an honest man out of him. Cas, of course, had forgotten to even say yes to the proposal in the flurry of kisses he had planted on Dean’s face.
Sam stood, making sure to be extra noisy for Dean’s benefit, who barely looked up with a questioning glance. “I need to stretch my legs. Maybe get us some coffee.” Sam explained, pulling the first excuse his brain had offered. Dean gave just the subtlest of grunts in response, which registered as a blessing in Sam’s book. He stepped out of the door without further hesitation, needing to put space between the steady beeping of the monitors and himself. He couldn’t bear sitting there in the room any longer, just waiting for a miracle. Or worse, the absence of one entirely.
Charlie’s smirk softened into a gentle smile. “You look great.” He was glad she was here with him, knowing he might have not made it all the way out here without her. Even though she was the biggest goofball he knew, she somehow knew how to ground him when he needed it. Like right now. Sam had gone on ahead, needing to get Cas ready for everything.
“Cas?” Dean's voice bounced off the walls of the small room just a second before his face peered around the show curtain. Cas regretted his current position instantly, the look of worry on Dean’s face driving home how weak and helpless Cas felt these days. “What are you-- Are you ok?” Dean’s features held an ounce of confusion as well as he pulled the curtain further back and crouched closer to Cas’s level.
didn’t even begin to cover Dean’s words; they were a flat out challenge that Cas was determined to fulfill for the rest of the night. He smiled, already on his feet with the ache in his leg long forgotten, and pulled Dean with him toward their bedroom.
Dean scoffed, and Cas flinched lightly at the sound. “No offense, bud, but I know Sammy don’t want me back anytime soon.” The expression on Dean’s face was was enough to break Cas’s heart. Cas wanted to reach across to wipe the frown from Dean’s lips, but he held back.
“No, Dean.” Cas took a moment to study his husband’s face, never having been so sure of a choice in his life. “If I take that, I will be an angel again.” Dean opened his more to respond, but Cas placed his hand on Dean’s cheek and he kept going. “I know it would make this life with you easier. You would feel safer knowing that I had angel grace to protect us. I would find comfort in knowing that I could keep you safe. But one day, hopefully far into our future, you will die. And I cannot take this gift knowing that I would live on for eons without you. I choose you over eternity.”
Hours later, Dean sat behind the wheel of his Baby, headed down the last road to the bar. He pulled into the back parking lot, which was tucked away, hidden from the main road. They had arrived with not too much time to spare, having spent precious time gathering their bags before hitting the road. Cas had needed a bit of persuasion as well, which Dean was more than willing to provide, leaving their little spat long forgotten. Cas had his headphones in, listening to something Dean couldn’t hear, tapping along to the beat as he flipped through another lore book.
Dean pulled into the parking lot of Luke’s Gas-N-Sip, looking anxiously around for any sign of Cas. The station only held one car in the parking lot, presumably belonging to a worker and not his friend, as it wasn’t Cas’s “pimp mobile”. He cursed out loud, wondering where Cas could have gotten off to; he hadn’t sounded like he was in any condition to just take off. It wasn’t until Dean rounded the back side of the building that he slammed on Baby’s brakes a little harder than he usually liked to.
Until one day, change did come. Only it wasn’t good.
They broke momentarily, Cas sitting back. His eyes were hungry, but he somehow looked apprehensive. “Dean.” His breath was halting, as was Dean’s, which almost made Dean chuckle, knowing that they were both preternatural beings that didn’t require oxygen. “While I am enjoying myself, I am surprised by your actions. Are you sure-”
He looked back to Dean, who had that devilish grin back on his lips. “Wanna ditch these guys and see how good we can make the rest of our night?”
Cas stood with a rough sigh, the ache in his body mirroring the ache in his heart. He looked at his bloodied and discarded clothes, wondering what he should wear out of the hotel. His eyes traveled to his own skin, noting that the trail of dark hairs on his stomach was dried to his skin, dried cum having been neglected in his need for sleep. The sight of it both warmed him and froze his heart at the same time. He processed that he had small flecks of dried blood across multiple parts of his body, either missed or forgotten as well. Resolutely he headed toward the shower, attempting to tackle at least one problem within his grasp.
Cas scoffed and rolled his eyes, which Dean appreciated highly, feeling a little closer to the Cas he knew. “I understood music before I fell, Dean. As a celestial being, I was unable to process the whole of a musical piece. I heard the beats per minute, the individual notes, the key changes. But the enjoyment of a piece, the emotions felt by it, has been an entirely human experience.” Cas paused, looking like he was getting lost in his own thoughts.
His in-laws laughed about something together, before pulling Cas into one final hug. They both whispered a quick word of thank you as they held him. His heart swelled as he squeezed them back, wishing they didn’t have to go. But John and Mary joined hands as they pulled away, nodding at Chuck in a signal to send them on their way. They disappeared as quickly as they had come, and he saw the sadness that Dean held in his eyes.
The last three years hadn’t been easy, but they had all come through it basically unscathed. They had just a few weeks ago set the world back to order, helping Chuck and Amara rekindle their lost relationship. When the two had left them, their little world had grown relatively quiet. Sam had kept in touch with other hunters since, but they had all decided they needed a vacation for just a little while.
a capable hunter.” Sam tried to make Dean see reason. He didn’t want to watch Dean mess up a good thing. People with lives like theirs didn’t get second chances. “He led an entire garrison before all this.”
Dean found himself writhing once again, but now, both to his shock and amusement, he felt Cas hard against him, his hips moving in rhythm to his fingers. The movements were small, but definitely something surprising for Dean. Where exactly had the naive angel gone who hadn't been comfortable in 'the den of iniquity'? What exactly had changed for the angel? It couldn't possibly be the current circumstances, of that Dean was quite sure. He had never caught a hint of desire from Cas, and now his face was pressed into the pillow, Cas's cock against his ass.
Sam watched as Dean squared his shoulders and crossed his arms in front of his chest. Sam had to keep himself together, right now he needed to watch over Dean as he finally faced reality. “If you’re going to discuss killing my-” Dean’s facade broken just for a second, and Sam knew why. His brother couldn’t bring himself to call himself Cas's husband. That was too much for even Dean. He picked up with only the slightest hesitation. “Cas, if you’re going to discuss killing him, I think I should have a say so in the matter. And I wanna know how it would happen.”
“Trust me, Cas. I’m only wondering why we didn’t do this earlier.” Dean pulled Cas back to him, recapturing his lips with a fervor. Cas leaned into it, grinding his hips along Dean’s. Dean groaned at the friction. Why hadn’t they done this before? His mind tried to race, but it was like he was spinning Baby’s wheels in the mud after a downpour of rain. There were some many reasons, all somehow flitting out of his grasp as he tried to find a reason. He ran his hands along Cas’s chest, the hair he found there tickling his fingertips. What did it matter anyway? They were here now, naked and panting, and Dean realized he had never wanted anything more in his life.
Cas’s cheeks ached from the smile that had been plastered on his face for the last three hours. Dean was still chattering on and on about his favorite songs, all the members of the bands, the meaning behind every lyric. Cas couldn’t remember the last time he had seen Dean this animated and happy. He kept breaking off mid-sentence to tap along to the beat or sing loud and off-key to a specific line in the song.
He almost didn’t register Cas’s movements. His brain was slow to process, but he realized Cas had a finger pressed against his ass just a second before he felt Cas enter him. He sucked in a breath, tension rippling through him again. He fought to override the sensation, forcing himself to relax his muscles around the sudden change. Cas paused above him, but he just nodded, realizing late that his eyes were shut from his concentration. He felt Cas begin to move again, and he blindly pulled him back in for another kiss. He nearly whimpered when Cas pulled away, until he felt Cas take him in his hand again. The angel began to slowly move both hands in unison, slowly massaging him inside and out.
Gabriel stared Jack down for a moment before he answered honestly, “I don’t know. But I’ll try to keep him alive. That’s why I’m here.” Dean could see that Gabriel was trying to help soothe Jack, but the kid wanted a happy ending, and that was something Gabriel couldn’t promise. Jack stood and walked out of the room in a rush. Dean looked after him, not sure what to do about it all.
“Why don’t we just lay here? We can watch tv, talk about it in the morning. That good with you?” He was so nervous, but he knew Cas better. He waited what seemed like years before Cas dropped the belt to the floor. That saucy look was back in his eyes, and he sauntered to the bed. Dean opened his lips to speak as Cas lifted a knee up to the bed, moving to crawl back next to the demon.
A vial of angel grace.
Sam sat back and took in Cas on the stage, staying quiet by signing with Eileen. He couldn’t ruin this moment for Dean. Cas was literally letting his rock god out, swaying in time to the music, and Sam had to confirm with Eileen when she said, “He’s really good, isn’t he?” Sam had to admit, not only was Cas landing the notes, he was just letting it all go and singing his heart out. He was throwing saucy looks at Dean anytime the lyrics deemed it necessary.
Dean was out of his chair and running down the hall before he even processed the sound of glass shattering and a body hitting the floor. His knees hit the floor hard as he slid to a halt next to Cas, who seemed to be out cold on the kitchen floor. He felt his heart freeze, not even knowing what to do at that moment. Should he take his pulse, vitals? Do angels really even have them? And why would Cas be sick? Angels don’t typically pass out at random intervals.
Even with the lasting aches Cas felt throughout his body, he reveled in the weight of Dean pressed on top of him as Dean leaned back in to recapture his lips. And when Dean rocked his hips into Cas’s, grinding their cocks together in sweet friction, Cas couldn’t contain his moan. Dean felt rock hard against him, spurring his own lust forward. Cas snaked his hand between their hips, pushing his fingers below the waist of Dean’s jeans, palming Dean’s cock through the fabric of his briefs. A small smile crossed Cas’s lips when Dean’s head snapped back, a deep-throated groan pushing itself out of Dean’s chest. The sound made Cas feel powerful in that moment, chasing away the helplessness he felt almost constantly in his humanity.
“Cas, if you don’t shut up and keep touching, so help me-” Dean broke off as he heard a small laugh. He looked over his shoulder and feathers, seeing a playfulness in Cas’s eyes that he almost didn’t recognize. Cas leaned down, bringing his chest close to Dean’s back, and spoke, a feigned innocence in his voice.
“The word he said. ‘Euterpe’. It’s a name.” He handed Dean a sheet that depicted a Grecian statue, a woman in flowing robes. Too bad the writing was in Greek, too. Dean handed it back without a word. Sam continued, for which Dean was grateful. “She’s the muse of music. Sister to Calliope.”
Whatever Dean had in mind, Cas was more than happy to oblige.
“Are you ok?” Cas couldn’t help the worry in his voice, wanting to remove any ache his parents’ departure had left in him.
Dean wasn’t fighting his tears anymore, his hands itching to either pull Cas into him or at least wipe at his damned cheeks. Chuck started back up again, though Dean barely heard what he said, losing himself again in the color of Cas’s eyes. Seeing all of their future laid out before him. “Your vows have been heard by everyone important to you two, and now I want to give both something to mark your words.” Dean looked to Chuck as he pulled two small silver bands out of his pocket, handing one to each of them.
Eileen smiled and shot a glance toward the taller brother. “I’m good, Dean. Sam said you guys had a weird one and thought you guys might need backup until you figure out what it is.” Eileen signed as she spoke, and Dean caught the heat that flashed between the two hunters, and he felt a wave of happiness shoot through him. Flirting nature aside, he truly hoped what they had survived this life. Sammy deserved to find someone just like he had.
Ever since Dean had come back home after awakening as a demon, Sam had seemed on edge. Dean didn’t exactly blame him, he knew he would have felt the same if the tables had been reversed. Hell, he wasn’t sure he would have been able to let Sammy out of the dungeon. When the spell hadn’t worked, Dean had been sure Sam was going to leave him there to rot. But when Sam and Cas had taken a moment to assess their next plan of attack, the three had all come to the conclusion that the spell had not been completely fruitless after all.
Dean didn’t respond, instead he grabbed Cas’s wrist in a lustful stare, pulling him away from the table. The intent was obvious enough that even Sam caught where they were going, shouting a vague chastisement about their case being able to wait, but Cas didn’t care. The raw need in Dean’s eyes had been enough to make his cock twitch in his jeans.
So Cas sat there in silence, not looking up, and waited to hear the door close behind Dean. He took a breath, forcing back tears, not exactly understanding the emotion behind them, but nevertheless feeling the pain in his chest grow with each second that passed.
Dean took a breath to steady himself, “Cas, I used to hate that I was brought up in this life. I used to curse my father for the choices he made,” Dean would later regret forgetting that his father was now standing in the congregation, getting thrown under the proverbial bus, but he would also be glad that honesty was how he chose to begin his marriage, “but standing here, looking into your eyes, I can’t be angry anymore. I never would have found you if I hadn’t lived the life I have. Never would have finally realized the gift I had standing right in front of me, the love I felt and could be given. Even if it took us a hell of a long time to get here,” they both laughed at that and Dean felt Cas reach forward to hold his hand, “I wouldn’t change a second of it for the world. And while I know our future will be as uncertain as our past, I can promise you that you will always have me to fight by your side. Hand in hand, we will take whatever comes our way. I love you, more than you will ever be able to know.” Tears threatened his vision, but he clenched his jaw to fight them away. Never again would he go a day without telling Cas in words, not just actions, just how much he loved him.
“Love can be the damnedest thing humanity has ever done.” Chuck’s voice carried across the silence of the clearing easily, the power and certainty in it helping to steady any of the last remnants of nervousness that Dean possessed. “It can make a man crazy with jealousy, bring him to his knees when it’s gone. Or in cases like the one in front of me, bring a man back from the brink of death, powered by his need to be with the one he was made to stand beside in a lifetime of trials and joy. Love is the most powerful gift I gave to you, and I am overjoyed when I see that you finally chose to see it in each other.” The smile in Chuck’s eyes verified the truth behind his words, and Dean felt his own heart swell.
“How do you do it, Dean?”  Cas hissed his words, feeling his skin split under even the gentle pressure of Dean’s treatment. The green-eyed hunter immediately dropped the towel from his hand.
“Cuz you’re the nerd.” Dean couldn’t help the jab in his anxiety, but thought better of it after it left his lips. “You’re faster and I need it fast.” He almost told Sam that it had been Cas on the other end of the call just minutes before, but he selfishly decided not to. As much as he knew his brother cared for the once-angel, he also knew Sam would want come help find Cas with him, and he just couldn’t see Sam yet. He still had too many regrets that he couldn’t face while trying to stay calm for Cas. “A hunter I ran across during a hunt went missing and that’s his number. Text me the coordinates. Thanks.” He was already in Baby’s driver seat as he ended the call, giving Sam no further chance to refuse.
“You won’t leave him alone?” Dean spoke in a way that it was both a question and a demand, his voice barely more than a whisper from lack of use. Jody seemed to understand his need and she gave him a soft smile that didn’t reach her eyes.
“You already feel it, don’t you?” Dean looked to Cas, trying to keep his shock and fear off his face. When he didn’t respond, Cas continued. “Your clothing. Does it almost seem as if your skin is on fire? You’ve let this go on for too long, and your soul is reacting to everything in a heightened fashion.” Dean paused to take it in. Cas was just looking out for him. He wasn’t just trying to get him naked.
Dean was in the middle of reading the paper again when Sam, his head in a book, caught the sound of Cas’s monitors beeping. The sound was a new one, almost hidden in all the other normal sounds of the hospital around them. But Sam then saw the flash of a light that hadn’t been lit up before, and a nurse ran in, then a second, then a doctor. Sam watched as his brother was pushed aside and for the first time in those long four months, Dean came to Sam’s side of the room to stand beside him. They stood shoulder to shoulder as the staff worked, and Sam felt completely lost in the bits of the talk he overheard.
“You two have the world at your fingertips. You may encounter dangers and troubles unlike anything from your past, but together, nothing can stop you. As long as you have each other in this world, there can be nothing powerful enough to break the bonds of love that have been forged both here today and since the fires of hell itself united the two of you.” Chuck stepped back from them, spreading his arms wide. “So, therefore, it is my honor to declare you married in the eyes of everyone here today as witnesses to your love.” Chuck paused, but Dean just kept grinning like a madman. It was so overwhelming that he felt like his mind was stuck in some sort of happy pudding. Chuck let out a laugh, pulling Dean back to reality, and he added. “That’s your cue to kiss him, Dean.”
“I don’t know, I quite like the sounds Dean makes.” Dean nearly dropped his cup, and Sam coughed as he seemingly choked on air. Cas looked to Dean, who definitely caught the sassy look he was sending Dean’s way. Cas was done waiting for Dean to man up. “I assume they generally mean that you enjoy what we’ve been doing. For example, I like the noises in particular that you make when I use my-”
Dean nodded as recognition flashed in his eyes. “He wanted to start a bar after Dad took care of it. What about him, is it back?” Sam caught Dean running his hand through Cas’s hair as he talked; he was pretty sure it was an unconscious movement.
? Really? He settled on a gruff sarcasm that he found familiar, pushing away the urge to cry out in exasperation.
Cas nodded, a look of understanding, concern, and almost shame coming over his face. “I should have thought about that.” He turned, lowering his feet off the bed and quickly stripped down. Dean relaxed back into the mattress as Cas climbed back up, feeling the weight again against his ass and thighs, this time, much softer. He ignored the response his body felt in response to the pressure of Cas’s thighs, ignored the feel of Cas’s cock against his ass, even as Cas leaned forward.
“Which, I guess, makes you ‘Uncle Sammy’.”
He stood, taking his still-full cup back to the coffee pot, miming pouring himself another cup. He had a serious problem and he had no clue how to handle it: he hadn’t told Sam yet. He kept trying to over last three months, promising Cas “Today I’ll tell him”, but it wasn’t that easy. How was he supposed to tell his little brother that he was in love with their best friend? He didn’t have a problem with what they were doing, it was the whole chick-flick feel of telling Sammy that gave him the cold sweats.
Sam stood, shooting Cas a look of sadness. “I’ll look after Jack.” He headed out the door, and Dean couldn’t help feeling grateful. He wanted to comfort the kid, but his concern was overridden by his worry for Cas.
“Dean-o, think bigger.” Gabriel gestured back to Cas with a flick of his thumb. He tossed a piece of candy into his mouth as he continued, distracting the hunter with the absurdity of the action at that moment. Dean wasn’t even sure where Gabriel had pulled it from. At this point, he might even just magic them out of thin air, no one could say for sure. “Cas isn’t
“Are you in danger? I won’t let you do this if you’ll just end up like Jack’s mom.” Dean struggled to push down the anger he felt toward heaven at that moment. He wished their life together could just be left alone. That he could just sit back, have his whiskey, and love his angel for the rest of his days.
Cas paused in his musings to process that the water had begun to run quite a bit colder. He lifted his head away from the wall, but he was unsure whether he would be able to stand on his own. Crawling himself out of the shower was one option he didn’t really look forward to, so he was both relieved and embarrassed when he heard the bathroom door open roughly.
Cas felt Dean’s teasing pause completely and watched as understanding flashed into Dean’s eyes. Just a half second of indecision flashed across Dean’s features before the heat returned. Dean released Cas, chuckling when the lack of contact caused Cas to whimper. The hunter leaned over the side of the bed, leaving Cas with nothing but Dean’s ass to stare at, which wasn’t exactly a bad thing. He heard the ruffling of a bag before Dean sat back up with a small bottle in his hand.
Nick nodded, a puzzled look taking over his face. “Sorry, but I don’t remember you.” Nick offered his hand to Cas, who took it. “In the rush, forgot about proper introductions. Name’s Nick.”
Dean wanted to weep for the lost time. He wished he could take Cas back to the beginning and start a proper musical education the day they had met. At least there would be one thing he couldn’t mess up. “Well, no time like the present, bud.” Dean fumbled through his tapes while trying to keep his eyes on the road. He pushed his favorite Zeppelin tape into the deck. “It’s about time I educate you.”
Alrighty then. For those who need the spoiler ---- Cas does not die. He will live, so rest assured that I'm definitely not lying. All is happy and wonderful in the next chapter.
He looked back to Cas, who seemed just as enraptured in him as he was with himself. “Cas, this is amazing.” He turned slowly, acutely aware of how large they were and how small his room now seemed. He folded his right wing in toward himself, running his fingers gently against the light feathers there. He grimaced as he took in the details, the little broken pieces and grime he saw under closer inspection. “I see what you mean. These things need a good spot wash.” He looked back to Cas, who now has his wings tucked back into his shoulders. “How do I do it?”
“Thank you for coming to find me, Dean.” He winced as Dean wiped, and he tried to stay as still as he could. A sharp pain radiated throughout his lower chest when he moved too much or breathed too deeply. He had never felt pain like this in his existence; it made it hard to focus on any one thing at a time.
Cas pressed into Dean, grinding his hips purposefully into Dean’s, their cocks rubbing delightfully into one another. Dean’s head flipped back with a moan, and Cas whispered into Dean’s ear, “Just because I have not performed the acts myself, does not mean I do not know how they are done, Dean.” Cas elicited a gasp from Dean’s lips as he licked the skin below Dean’s ear. “I have been around long enough, and have seen enough to know how to make your toes curl in pleasure.” Dean’s cock hardened at the words. He didn’t know where this version of Cas had come from, but he definitely wasn’t going to complain.
Tomorrow came too soon.
Next, I want to say thank you to all my Betas. They not only were there for me to help with grammar and spelling, but they were also some of my biggest cheerleaders. History, Umbrie, Deancebra, and anyone who just helped me bounce small ideas around, you people are the real Angels. For real, you people got me through this.
Crossing the room and out into the hall, Dean stopped by the bathroom, hearing the water running. Sam’s shower was down the hall, so unless he randomly chose to steal one in Dean’s, it had to be where Cas had run off to. Not entirely weird by any means, but Cas had definitely shown his appreciation for “water conservation”, as he liked to call it, so Dean felt a bit miffed. He nearly went in to interrogate the man but paused just before turning the handle. He had been trying to shake his insecurities over the past months and part of those included giving Cas his own space to be his own person. He told himself that Cas probably just needed a morning to himself as he headed to the kitchen, nothing was wrong with that.
Sam looked up from the magazine in his lap to find nothing in the room had changed in the past hour since they had both taken a seat. Sam sat in the corner, keeping watch as a hunter’s life a taught him long ago to do in any situation. Dean had pulled his chair as flush against the bed as possible, wrapped his hands around Cas’s hand the best he could. Sam tried not to take in how many machines they had connected to Cas or the tube that was down Cas’s throat. He knew the doctor hadn’t outright lied to them, but the tube told Sam that Cas’s situation was much more dire than the doctor had let on.
“I feel like I’ve seen this before, but I can’t place it.” Dean stared at the picture with an almost comical intensity, as if just focusing harder would make the picture suddenly divulge its secrets.
He’s making another angel.”
Sam had stayed behind as the five of them rushed away. Dean, of course, was struggling to keep calm as he followed them towards the spare bedroom that had set up for the occasion. Sam had tried to stay relaxed as he waited, knowing he had no way of being helpful and would just be in the way. Even Jack was more useful right now due to his powers, even if the kid looked just as tense as Dean.
Dean stood silent as Chuck and Cas repeated the process, feeling complete as his ring was slid into place on his finger. He stared into Cas’s eyes again, smiling as he let himself be overcome by the reality of where they were. He still had trouble wrapping his head around it all, but he was certain about one thing: for once in his life, he was completely and utterly free.
“You proclivity for women has never been a secret.” Cas thought it was an obvious statement, but Dean just laughed again. Cas shook his head, feeling a smile creep onto his lips as well. “What is funny about this, Dean?” Cas leaned in as Dean pulled him into another kiss. It was unlike the night before, less frantic and more along the lines of sweet, but left Cas just as breathless.
Dean tried to wrap his head around the idea, but it was too much. It seemed like every time he had his new demon situation figured out, something else came up that threw the proverbial wrench at him. “Cas,” Dean started, wincing at the uncertainty that he heard in his voice, “how do I- I don’t even know where to begin with this.”
“Don’t do this to me, please.” The words tumbled out of his lips around his sobs, choking him for air. “Cas, I lied. I’ll hate you if you leave. Please, no.” He can’t breathe. Why wasn’t there enough air? But no matter the lack of air, his begging wouldn’t stop. “I promise I’ll tell you every day. I love you. Please, Cas, I love you. You just have to wake up. I can’t- I can’t-” His chest heaved, his head down against Cas’s chest again.
Sam caught her arm, gaining a questioning look, but he looked to Dean then, acting on the single moment of clarity he had seen running through his brother’s body in nearly 72 hours. “Dean, we oughta run down to the cafeteria before Jody goes.” Sam looked expectantly at his brother, hoping the man would break out of it long enough to think about food. Dean almost looked like he would ignore Sam, but then relief hit the younger brother when Dean spoke.
Cas rocked it out with abandon, and Sam was honestly wishing this was just a normal double date out at a bar. He redoubled his efforts on scanning the crowd, trying to keep focused on the case at hand. Dean was going to be of no use for as long as Cas was on that stage. And as much as he wanted to, Sam couldn’t blame his older brother for losing himself in the moment. The man deserved to bask in this. He deserved happiness.
It was a few more hours before Jody arrived, this time with Claire in tow. Claire’s eyes were red ringed before she even stepped into the room. She had grown close to Cas over the last several years, finding comfort in being close to him. Sam knew she had never wanted to replace Jimmy, but he could see now how much she would be broken again by his loss.
Zeppelin; he was actually singing one of Dean’s two favorite Zeppelin songs, “Ramble On.”
Eileen leaned across the table, and Dean gave her his attention. “So, Cas is gonna sing?” Sam must have told her about their fight earlier, which made Dean want to hit him, but he held off for now. Eileen flicked her eyes between the two brothers. “What does he even listen to?”
Sam looked taken aback at Dean’s harshness, and the elder brother really tried to feel apologetic, but the emotion just wouldn’t come. “What’s the matter, Dean?” Sam looked concerned for Dean, which of course just set Dean’s temper off further.
Dean thought he might have to draw a line there.
“Right.” Dean stepped out, stretching his sore muscles, waiting for the other two men to meet him in front of Baby before turning to head into the bar. What surprised him, however, was the sight of another hunter headed their way as they rounded the front of the building. A full-on cheesy grin found its way onto his lips, his inner flirt rearing its head.
Cas watched as Dean poured a liberal amount of clear liquid from the bottle into palm. He sighed in pleasure as Dean slid his palm against his cock, adding a much-needed slickness to the movement that the ex-angel had not realized he needed. He watched as Dean repeated the process on his own member, and Cas lifted his hips toward Dean, hoping Dean had understood. Dean spread Cas’s knees wider and positioned himself between them, his cock resting against Cas’s ass, hard and demanding.
As they all turned to head into the bar, Dean’s arm wrapped itself around Cas’s shoulder and Sammy’s across Eileen’s waist, Dean couldn’t help smack his brother’s shoulder with his free hand. “You brought your deaf girlfriend to karaoke. Good job, bitch.” Sam looked like he might retort, but Eileen’s questioning shrug under Sam kept him from doing so immediately.
“After we started our relationship, Cas turned off Angel Radio.” Dean winced at the memory and stroked Cas’s hand. “Some of your brothers weren’t too happy with us.” That was the understatement of the century, but the details weren’t necessary.
“So, Cas.” He started, flicking his eyes off the road for a moment to take a look at Cas. The man looked better than the night before, but there was something off about his demeanor. Cas had never been the overly happy, peppy type, but now he seemed even more reserved than normal. Dean silently hated himself for giving in the night before, knowing that as much as it had rocked his world, Cas had been vulnerable. He had taken advantage of him. He felt like a sleazeball. “Anything new since you’ve become human?” Dean kicked himself at how stupid he sounded in that moment, but even if he had to go far down the chick flick rabbit hole, he would do it to make Cas feel better.
“You can’t shelter him forever.” Sam felt his tone and expression soften as he came to understand his brother’s motives. “We all die someday, Dean. We know that better than anyone.”
“Don’t you even
He tried to speak but just gasped, which caused her to loosen her grip for a moment. Thank Chuck for small miracles in the disguise of vain demigods. “Because my brother is behind you.”
“Can you stand, Cas? We need to get you to someplace where I can patch you up.” Dean stood, but his focus stayed on Cas, wondering how he had even gotten as far as he had in his condition. Cas nodded and pushed himself up and away from the building. Dean had to move quickly to catch him as he stumbled and lost consciousness again in his arms. Dean groaned under the weight of the other man, carrying his body at an odd angle until he was able to slide him into Baby’s back seat. He stood still for just a moment, watching as fresh blood slowly painted itself into Baby’s interior. “Son of a bitch.”
Cas’s fingers shook as he fumbled with the keypad of the phone. Luck had been on his side when he had found it in Theo’s pocket after he had killed the angel. Blood stung his left eye as he tried to dial, the pain in his chest making it hard to think. But he somehow found the clarity of mind to remember the digits he needed, maybe through habit or just plain strength of will, and he pressed the phone to his ear as he leaned his back against the wall behind him. He slid to the ground as another wave of pain made his legs unsteady. It had surprised him that his legs had held out as far as the gas station before collapsing. But he had needed to know that he had made it away from Malachi’s men. Despite making it here however, he wasn’t sure how much farther he could make it on his own.
“Cas, buddy, sorry to break it to you, but my wings aren’t real.” He tried to express his confusion as he shrugged that he really didn’t know what Cas was trying to get him to do. It’s not like they were actually feathered appendages sticking out of his back. “Yeah, they’re there, but like as energy, man.”
“The final piece of the spell, the reason Naomi chose to use me as her test subject, was love. The angel must be in love with another being to bear an offspring.” Dean tried to wrap his head around the karmic justice of that as Cas kept talking. “The child will need a vessel to live here on Earth, and I believe your DNA shall be a part of that. The child will be just as much genetically yours as it will be mine, from my grace.”
Sam started, waiting for Dean to respond, sighing when the man just shot him a blank look. “Dad took care of a poltergeist for him when we were kids.”
“I visited them often with stories of you, updating them on your life. Until I lost my wings, that is.” There was almost a feeling of guilt in his chest at his actions, but he didn’t let himself linger there. He had only kept it to himself to save Dean the pain of unwanted memories. But the look on his husband’s face told him that his fears had been unwarranted. He sighed as Dean pulled him into a passionate kiss, all but forgetting their family for a moment.
“Cas? What is it?” Dean paused to wait for a response, but it never came. He only heard the noises coming from the background, the sound of a car passing by, the sound of wind hitting the mouthpiece. Seconds seemed to fly by as he waited, repeating Cas’s name just once more, before hanging up. There wasn’t even a second glance back in his mind as he threw down a few bills, the disappointed look on Candy’s face following him out the door. He headed straight toward Baby as he dialed Sam’s number, his heart pounding loudly in his ears.
Dean felt Cas’s head drop to his shoulder as laughter erupted from Cas’s chest, the sound of his lover's zipper registering in Dean's ears. He turned to face Cas, a bit of the giggles working itself through his chest as well. He pulled his angel forward into a soft kiss, feeling arms wrap themselves around his waist. He smiled as he pulled back, the sparkle in Cas's blue eyes mirroring the humor he felt at their near discovery. He slipped out of Cas's arms, catching his hand and pulling him back toward the call of duty. No matter how much he wanted to stay outside and repeat more of what they had just done, he knew they both needed to get their minds back in the game.
“I’m fine, Dean.” He was sure his labored breath told Dean that he was lying, but he at least had the grace to not call him on it out loud. “You needed a better angle to work. I am able to sit if it helps you.” Dean’s eyes softened just a bit at Cas’s words. He gently readjusted Cas’s legs so that they sat in between his own, sliding his muscled frame forward on his chair, leaning himself toward Cas’s collarbone.
Cas came awake slowly, feeling aches all over his body. He rolled into a sitting position, instantly regretting it as his head swam dangerously close to nausea levels. His arms flew up to grip his head, sending a jolt of pain through his shoulder that made him elicit a hiss as he reached to press his palm against the stitches he had forgotten. He groaned as all of the movement stretched his side, causing his bruised rib to scream out its existence.
“That’s definitely a bruised rib, bud.” Dean sat back and stretched his neck, readjusting his shoulders and picking up the towel to get back to work. “I’ve had my fair share. At least, it doesn’t look broken. They still suck, but you’ll live.” His attention focused in on a nasty looking cut across Cas’s collar bone.
It had all been sort of anticlimactic in the end really, because Cas hadn’t even gone into a real labor or anything even remotely similar. He had simply looked to Gabriel and Rowena (who had both decided to stay with them in case they needed an archangel or a witch at any time, though Dean thought the help might not have been worth the nuisance), and stated that he believed it was time.
Cas shifted a bit under Dean’s arm, giving Dean a silent cue to take point. “The short of it is that Jack is getting a little…” Dean paused and looked down at Cas and over to Gabriel in quick succession. Both of the angels replied in unison.
Before either of them could even open their mouths to speak or attempt to button Cas back up, the back door of the bar swung open, assaulting them with blaring music. Dean stepped sideways and faced away from Cas, both in an attempt to block any view someone might have of the man’s naked hips, but also to block him from any potential harm. He watched as a busboy that he had seen earlier tossed a bag of trash into the dumpster before quickly heading back into the bar, paying them no attention.
“sit across my hips?” He could almost hear Cas nodding.
Cas paused again, and Dean heard a level of breathlessness as he spoke. “Should I be explaining what I am doing? So that you are able to do this yourself the next time?” Dean wanted to weep.
“Are you going to be okay, Castiel?” Jack’s appearance sometimes made it hard for Dean to remember that the kid wasn’t actually in his twenties. Right now it was so obvious that Jack was still a child in many ways, his fear reminding Dean of a time when Sam would look at him the same way when they were kids. He nearly spoke to assuage Jack’s fears, but Cas beat him to the punch.
Any momentum that had been lost when Dean broke contact now rushed back through Cas, making him cling to Dean for dear life. The feeling of Dean against his skin mixed with the pain that still pulsed through his body was a heady combination. He had himself propped up on his right arm, his left hand gripping Dean’s shoulder hard enough that he wondered absently if he was causing Dean pain. But even if he was, Dean didn’t stop him; instead, his hands shifted quickly up to the base of Cas’s neck, pulling him in closer and deeper into their kiss. The taste of Dean, a mixture of whiskey and something sweet like candy, sent a jolt through Cas’s entire being, but most importantly, straight to his cock. Cas felt a groan build in his throat as the throb in his groin silenced all other pains in his body for just a moment. As they broke for breath, Dean snaked his arm around the small of Cas’s back and rolled them.
A clarity flashed in Cas’s eyes that almost had Dean spooked. “Dean, you are a fledgling!” Dean just stood there, feeling the blank look that was plastered on his face deepen, not even attempting to understand what Cas was trying to say. At least Cas knew him well enough to elaborate. “When heaven was first formed, the angels were, for a time, fledglings. We were unaware of how our corporeal bodies worked and what we would be required to do in order to feel comfortable.”
Dean’s face was back to one of stone, his bloodshot eyes the only remaining whisper of the tears he had feverishly wiped away. Sam was at a loss, not knowing whether silence or words would help his brother in that moment. If he were to be honest with himself, he knew no one but Cas could fix this now. It was left in his hands, and Sam wasn’t all that sure the man had that kind of fight left in him.
The lapse in touch didn’t last however, and Dean came back down, capturing Cas’s lips once again. Their hips sat a bit off-center from one another now, allowing Cas to reach back down, this time wrapping his fingers around Dean, sliding his digits down along Dean’s shaft to the hilt. He had to assume that Dean enjoyed the sensation, feeling a growl emit from Dean’s mouth against his teeth. Dean gripped Cas’s hair tight in his fingers, returning the pleasure to Cas by mimicking his actions, gripping Cas’s cock in his hand.
“He says he does. But we know better.” He looked down to meet Jody’s eyes, forgetting for just the slightest second where they were. They spoke in unison, both in a lightly teasing tone they had used against Dean too many times, “‘Anything for my
Dean scoffed at the gratitude. “What else was I supposed to do? Leave you to be mugged or bleed out?” The hunter continued to wipe at the blood, his gentle motions telling Cas that he was trying to keep from opening the wounds again. Cas felt tears behind his eyes, both from the pain and Dean’s kindness. “Jesus, Cas,” he gently turned Cas’s head by his chin, starting his work around Cas’s other eye, “they did a number on you, didn’t they?” He seemed to almost be talking to himself, but Cas responded to keep from flinching.
Which was how they came to be here, surrounded by family, in the middle of the woods in Kansas, about to be married. Cas was smiling wide, though Dean could see the concern in his eyes as he placed a hand on his on Dean’s arm.
“I feel I’ve missed something. What exactly do I agree with, Sam?”
Sam looked back down the hall, only half processing the sound of the doctor’s retreating footsteps on the linoleum. He watched as Eileen gently placed her hand on Dean’s shoulder, trying her best to comfort the elder Winchester in a hopeless situation. Sam felt his heart rip into even smaller pieces as he saw Dean’s shoulders lurch as he finally gave in and let himself cry. Sam wanted to sit there where Eileen was, comforting his brother, but he couldn’t get his feet to start walking. Because he couldn’t bring himself to be the one who had to tell Dean the rest of the doctor’s unsaid words. He couldn’t be to one to tell Dean that they had 48 hours left before the road went south fast. That if Cas wasn’t awake in the next two days, they might still be burying a body after all.
“Dean, we need to talk. Food first, or-” Sam sorta paused, giving Dean the option of choosing the prolonged suffering. But Dean answered quickly, surprising Sam by the regained clarity in his voice. Sam felt his chest tighten, wondering how much longer his brother could hold on.
“Well, it’s not like you’re exactly a rockstar, either, Cas.” Dean’s tone was biting, and Sam saw Cas flinch. The man stood and left the room without a word. He pushed past Sam, who still stood in the doorway, and was watching as Dean’s irritation instantly seemed to vanish.
“There are no options, Sam. We have one: we wait for Cas to wake up.” Dean started to turn away, obviously already done with their way too brief talk. Sam knew they had to do this though, so he spoke as he reached forward to grab Dean by the arm, trying to stop his brother from running away from him too.
“Just before I collapsed on the kitchen floor, I listened to Angel Radio, hoping I might know what was happening to me. I worried that heaven was failing, but instead, I heard Naomi’s boasts about the spell having been successful. She must have known that I was no longer listening, or perhaps she was just that arrogant.” Cas looked angry and Dean understood it. He knew what it was like to be used by heaven. Dean wanted to just hold his angel, but he needed the details about what was happening before he could relax.
Dean didn’t answer; instead, he leaned over and pressed his lips to Cas’s, smile still in place. Cas froze, shocked and overwhelmed by everything Dean was doing. When the hunter pulled away, there was a playfulness in his eyes.
But a call had just come in that they needed to look into. “You remember Nick Bryers?”
Cas had been secretly practicing Dean’s song for a little over the last two years, knowing how much it would mean to his hunter.  While Dean had seen him tinkering with an old acoustic they had found while on a hunt, Cas had been very careful to keep his intentions a closely guarded secret. He had intended to play the song privately for him on his next birthday, but when the opportunity had arisen, Cas couldn’t pass up the chance to break out his full rockstar. From the look on Dean’s face, Cas knew he had made the right call.
“You’ve met them? When did you..?” Lost was the only way Cas could describe the way Dean looked right then, especially when John laughed lightly at the interaction. Cas had to take pity on his love.
“What am supposed to do, Cas?” Dean spoke when the angel didn’t offer any instruction.
“What song is that?” Jody whispered, sadness still evident in her curiosity. Sam couldn’t fault her. If he hadn’t heard the song repeatedly over that last few years, he would have not known now himself. “It’s the intro song to
Sam sat in a hard plastic chair, feeling dizzy from watching his brother pace the floor of the waiting room. He wanted to help him, say anything that he could to calm Dean’s nerves, but his tongue seemed thick in his mouth, too dry and not quite the right size. Dean stopped, glancing back to the doors at the end of the hall, before returning to the dizzying pace.
There was no change in Cas’s condition during the four months that followed the cafeteria incident.
“Will it kill him like it did my mother?” Jack spoke quietly, a look of sadness and worry etched across his features. Dean worried the kid wouldn’t ever smile again if something happened to Cas. Hell, he knew he wouldn’t.
karaoke.” Dean was surprised by the statement, but he let it go, knowing he was sometimes more ignorant of Deaf culture than he led himself to believe.
Jody looked strong behind her and Sam pulled her to him in a hug as Claire walked to stand next to the bed. “Hey, Cas.” Claire's whisper was so low and soft that Sam almost didn’t hear it at all.
“Cas, seriously man, what the hell are you trying to say?” Dean grabbed his now cooling coffee and sat back down, facing where Cas still stood. “Crayola simple man, this is only my second cup.” He took a sip and waited for Cas to continue as the man came back around to sit across from him.
“You regret it, right? Got caught up in the moment and all that. I get it.”
Sam could see it on Dean’s face as everyone began to arrive. He had taken point and passed it along to the staff that they wanted to remove life support late in the evening, giving everyone else a chance to come in to say goodbye. Sam overhead Dean telling Cas that it would be the best to wait until sundown because Dean knew that was Cas’s favorite time of day.
“I love you too, Dean.” Cas had returned, making no noise like always. His blue eyes glistened and Dean knew they would have to talk after they were done with the most awkward cup of coffee he would ever drink. “I didn’t actually leave anything in
Dean cursed as he realized what they were dealing with, why they had seen the flower before. It was the same one that had been left at Calliope’s abductions, only a different color. “So basically, we’re after a demigod? That’s just awesome.” He looked back over to Nick, who understandably looked completely lost. “Are there any abandoned buildings or factories nearby?” Nick immediately pulled out his phone and fired up the map app to send them on their way. They picked the most likely candidate, telling Eileen to stay behind in case they didn’t come back or needed her to head to another location when they came up empty-handed.
Dean spaced out into the movie, a small smile on his lips as he heard Jack asking Sam another of his many questions about the movie on the screen. The boy didn’t seem to understand that movies were just to be watched, that he would get his answers if he just stayed quiet and paid attention.
“Keep it.” Dean made a noise somewhere between a gasp and a scoff, whereas Chuck didn’t seem the least bit surprised, a soft and knowing smile on his lips.
Cas’s brow creased. “I was not implying that we need discuss relationship status, Dean.” The saltiness of Cas’s tone ricocheted through Dean like a whip of heat. There was a sassy playfulness in Cas's tone that just begged Dean to kiss him again and taste the words on his tongue. “I do, however, believe we should make it known how far we would like this to proceed.” Dean took a moment to process what Cas seemed to mean. He realized what it was that Cas needed to hear, but somehow he found his voice stuck in his throat.
Cas let out a small breath before continuing, a resoluteness in his eyes. “While if done roughly or incorrectly, grooming
“It’s quite simple, as you can see, Dean.” Cas’s voice was soft, no judgment or harshness at Dean’s ineptitude. But Dean still felt overwhelmed and shrugged, containing his desire to touch.
“You wings, while physically here, exist somewhat… between realities.” Dean turned away with a flick of his eyebrow, facing away from Cas as he slid his jeans and briefs down his legs in one motion. He tried to ignore the fact he was now naked in front of Cas. “Lay down on your stomach on the bed.” Dean looked back, a bit of shock on his features. “It will be the most comfortable position for you, Dean.” Cas was back to the soft tone again, and Dean realized he was comforted by it. He laid down on the bed, pulling his pillow underneath his chin.
“It’s been so long, Castiel!” It was his turn to blush as Dean shot him a questioning look at Mary’s words.
But tonight he couldn’t keep his hands to himself, maybe it was the sight of Cas rocking his favorite tune or maybe the idea of marrying him, he didn’t really care to figure it out. Instead, he wanted to let his inhibitions go and try something completely out of the ordinary for them.
Dean ignored the anxiety that was slowly building in his chest. There he was, lying beside his best friend, having thoroughly fucked him into the sheets. Dean couldn’t remember the last time he had felt so sated, so at peace in someone’s arms. Even Lisa hadn’t felt like this. Dean thought it was due to being completely free to be himself with Cas. Lisa had always been accepting of him, but Dean had always kept more from her than what he felt comfortable telling her. Cas knew about the dangers of being in his life; hell, Cas might even have it worse during this apocalypse.
Sam just barely caught Dean’s attention seconds later when the younger Winchester let out a soft chuckle. He still didn’t look away from Cas, trying to memorize everything about this moment, but he had to ask, “What’s funny this time?” He heard the smile in Sam’s voice as he responded.
Dean couldn’t help it. He burst out laughing. He pulled Cas into him, kissing him hard before grabbing his remote and settling into the bed for a good cuddle. What a night. Wings are real. Charlie actually won a bet. Sam was cool with all.
Dean seemed surprised when Cas let his wrist go in favor of placing his fingers under his chin, turning his head in a move reminiscent of how Dean had done just a bit earlier. “You still don’t see yourself, do you?” Cas’s eyes were soft as he met the gaze of the hunter, and Dean looked as though he were a frightened animal, too scared to look away from the oncoming headlights. “Why do you think I chose to call you, Dean?” Cas’s lips turned up slightly at the corner as he continued, “Whenever I am hurting or lost, I find myself looking for the comfort of your presence. You are far from poison, Dean Winchester.” Dean opened his lips to protest Cas’s claims, but the hand at his chin slid slightly to Dean’s cheek and it silenced any protests he had. Cas realized in that moment that his heart was no longer just fluttering, but pounding in his chest, his torso leaning forward towards Dean, who seemed to have slid even closer as they talked.
“Well, I’ve found that I do not care for pain.” Dean flicked his eyes back over again, catching a bit of a snarky grin flashing across lips.
From the sounds he heard from his angel's lips, he could tell Cas definitely liked his reaction. Dean forced his head back up to connect his gaze with Cas, whose eyes were a brilliant shade of grace blue. The angel's lips were parted, small gasps ripping through him as he moved his hips roughly against Dean's ass. Dean threw his head back into the bed, letting Cas fuck him right down into the sheets. The moans leaving his throat were proof enough that he had never felt pleasure like this, and he knew some of it was due to feeling completely and totally free.
“Did Cas make a stop at the bar?” Dean asked, trying to keep the growing panic he felt under control. Nick immediately caught Dean’s implication and shook his head. The three hunters all stood in unison, realizing as a unit that Cas’s plan had worked and the bait had been taken. But that didn’t have to sit well with Dean. “Do you have cameras in this place?” Nick nodded this time and started to lead them into the back office.
Dean was awake again, tears freely falling, lips moving slowly as he sang softly to Cas. His volume wasn’t much higher than a loud whisper, but the sound was deafening after the silence. Sam pulled back, pressing against the wall, trying not to invade Dean’s privacy, but also wanting to shield himself from the pain. He couldn’t see Dean, but he could still hear the sound of his brother’s singing. They had caught him halfway through his slowed rendition. He tried to force it away by closing his eyes.
“Yes. When you became a demon, your soul transformed, gaining wings that, while generally noncorporeal in nature, do need to be groomed and tended at times.” Cas had the same spark in his eyes that Sam usually got when he found a particularly interesting case. Dean almost thought it was cute. Almost.
Sam had been gone around ten minutes when Cas decided to venture into the kitchen, sitting down beside Dean, who had taken to reading a Vonnegut novel while he sipped his coffee. They sat there for a moment before Dean sighed, rolling his damned shoulders again (he was beginning to think he slept wrong), looking just over the edge of his book to meet Cas’s gaze. The angel wore a soft look in his eyes, almost as if he was concerned.
Cas ran his hands down Dean’s arms, gripping the muscles he felt there. He had always appreciated the beauty of Dean Winchester, but had never realized what he felt for the man. He felt as if he had found the missing piece and now he wanted nothing more than to never let go. But he knew this would end eventually, so he resolved the make the most of what time he had here in the rundown hotel they were in. When Dean flashed a questioning look into his eyes, Cas nodded desperately, whispering just the quietest whimper of “Please.”
“Yeah, he was.” Dean looked around, his hunter instincts starting to kick in with the need to check for the usual signs.  No one was setting off his alarms so far, but that didn’t mean he could let his guard down. “So, ‘Karaoke Killer’, huh?”
Dean struggled but found his brain right as Cas began moving his fingers wider within him, stretching muscles he hadn’t even known he had possessed. “Cas. More.” He should have been embarrassed by his monosyllabic state but he couldn’t be. It all just felt too damn good.
Cas caught a flash of humor that lit Dean’s eyes. He was unsure why the hunter found him amusing at that moment, but he didn’t press him. “Come on, buddy. Let’s get you out of here before you go all pruny.” Dean offered both his hands, which Cas took greedily, blaming it on his unsteady legs and not on his need to touch Dean.
“If ever I have seen two people more in love, I can’t remember them now. So, in that feeling, now is the time to make your promises to one another, to share what this life you will lead will become.” Chuck paused again, letting them both have a moment to compose themselves.
They sat around for the few hours they had left, talking in turns, telling stories about Cas. There were tears nearly constantly on tap somewhere in the room, and while Dean stayed quiet through most of it, Sam did catch a small smile or chuckle every so often. He tried not to let it give him any hope, since he knew, come sundown, his brother’s world would come to an end.
The younger Winchester stood there for what could have only been five full seconds before sighing and saying, in an exasperated tone, “You guys finally decided to fuck and you flew out all the frickin lightbulbs in the bunker? Seriously? Not only is Charlie winning the bet, but now she has to come fix some shit.” Sam groaned as turned to walk away, shouting over his shoulder as he went, “ABOUT FUCKING TIME!”
“Grooming?” Dean felt his voice crack as he lifted an eyebrow at the suggestion. He had no idea what Cas meant, exactly, but he couldn’t help feeling like there was something forbidden unspoken in Cas’s assertion.
Except for the large man who was headed straight toward them with a big grin on his lips. Nick was about the age their dad would have been if he were still alive, but he looked like the years hadn’t been too rough on him. He wore his hair longer than Dean remembered, and while it had greyed with the years, it looked like most of it had stayed around to see this decade. The man was the basic image of a rugged old biker type: too many tattoos and an overly hard exterior, but definitely a softy when given the chance, the exact picture of what you would expect when you asked for the owner of a bar.
Cas pulled back again, eliciting a frustrated groan from Dean. The demon looked up to find heat in the angel’s eyes. “Dean, while we have established that we are both enjoying ourselves, we need to examine our intentions.” Dean wanted to punch something for all the frustration he felt. His brain was already moving as slow as molasses and Cas wanted to have a chat about
The day had been a whirlwind, but in the end, they all wound up crowded into a small bedroom, smiling down at a tiny baby with beautiful little black wings, smiles on everyone’s lips. He was the most beautiful child Sam had ever seen, a perfect combination of both Dean and Cas’s features.
“He's bad, Jody. Honestly,” Sam hated to say anything, but he found it helped to have someone to talk to, since Dean was completely shut down, “I’m not sure he’s going to make it either. We’ve lost people, that’s not new.” He ran a hand through his hair, feeling a sense of relief at being able to let this all out finally. The last 24 hours felt like a lifetime. “It’s part of the life, ya know? But Dean,” his gaze wandered back out the break room door, towards the hall that led to the two most important members of his family, “he can’t lose Cas. This’ll be the one that breaks him.” He thought back to just hours before Cas fell, and he laughed, a small chuckle that both helped and hurt him in that moment. “You won’t believe this, but Dean was going to ask Cas to marry him.” Sam looked to Jody then, and he saw in her eyes a mirror of his own delight at the idea but also sadness that it might never be. She stood then and reached out to offer Sam a hand to stand.
The hunter seemed just as uncomfortable as he walked away to the table under the window, which only confirmed for Cas that he had ruined what they had before. Keeping one arm down to conceal his groin under the towel, Cas began rubbing at his hair, attempting to dry it at least a bit. He winced as the action pulled him in a way to remind him of his bruised rib again. A hiss leaked from between his teeth, but he kept trying to dry himself, even if it was a struggle to do so.
His heart stopped for just a second before it began pounding so hard he almost lost his nerve. Cas was breathtaking in his suit, which featured a long black jacket that subtly reminded Dean of Cas’s old trenchcoat, making him crazy in more than one way. This one, however, was fitted just the right way, giving Dean a look at all the right places of his still slim-but-muscular build. His vest and slacks matched with Dean’s perfectly, midnight black with a white dress shirt underneath. Their only other difference being their choice in tie colors, Dean sporting a blue to match his angel’s eyes, while Cas had apparently chosen similarly with a light emerald one.
“I understand that your relationship with your brother is in flux, but he still needs you.” The uncertainty on Dean’s face broke Cas’s hold on his tongue, causing everything he had felt since waking that morning to fly out of his mouth before he could think twice. “I need you here with me, Dean. I understand the regret you harbor from our actions last night, but I know I cannot do this-” he gestured around himself in general, “-being human, without you.” He paused, realizing how out of breath he was, anxiety growing in his chest. Especially when he met Dean’s gaze, who now looked like he thought Cas was crazy or maybe had sprouted a second head.
“CAS!” Dean found his voice suddenly, and not a moment too soon. “Didn’t you forget something in my room?” He stared Cas down for a moment before the man sighed and headed out of the kitchen towards the bedrooms.
“Dean?” Cas said his name in a question, his eyes still closed and his face contorted with the effort of trying to pull himself out of his sleep. Dean placed his palm softly against Cas’s cheek.
“Dean, I need…” Cas groaned as Dean’s hand continued to stroke him, making it even harder to think. Dean smirked in acknowledgment of Cas’s frustration, but he leaned back just a bit to give the man some room to think.
“Wait. You think I regret it?” Dean’s tone was near shock, which Cas didn’t understand.
Dean gently ran his fingers across the back of Cas’s hand as he parked Baby, pulling him out of his reverie. Dean’s heart fluttered as Cas responded to their silent code, closing the book and pulling out his earbuds. Their eyes met, but they didn’t say a word. He sometimes found it hard to breathe when he thought about how much he loved the man in the passenger seat. He couldn’t imagine his life without him now, especially since they had accepted their mutual pining had been the dumbest shit either of them had ever done.
“Never. Just lost myself for a second.” He dipped his head to capture Cas’s lips, forgetting entirely where they were. Until, that is, he heard Sam’s voice calling across the clearing.
“Sammy, call 911! Fast!” Dean held Cas to his chest, wrapping his fingers around to find the pulse in his neck. It was there, faint, but there beneath his fingers. He heard scuffling and his brother’s voice, but it all turned to mush in his brain as Cas’s body tensed in his arms. Dean watched helplessly as Cas’s head flopped back and his body began to jolt, a seizure wracking its way through the man he loved.
I want to thank my artist,
Euterpe flung her hand towards them, sending them flying like ragdolls. Dean gasped as he hit the ground, the air in his lungs rushing out upon impact. He looked over to see Sam on his side, not moving from where he landed. He must have seemed the most dangerous of the three, because Euterpe rushed him then, pulling him from the ground by his neck.
Dean kept his eyes down on the wound. “You shouldn’t talk, Cas.” He chided in the way a parent might a child who didn’t know that what they were doing was going to hurt themselves.
Dean followed, letting Cas lead to his bedroom. Dean stopped not far into the doorway, feeling confusion wrinkle his features. Cas turned to look back at him, standing next to the bed.
Dean froze as he found Sammy inches in front of him, hands gripping his shoulders tight enough that Dean registered that there should be pain. When had he stood, had he walked? Was there pain? Was that this feeling in his chest? He felt his heart pounding so hard, he couldn’t hear Sam anymore. What was it Sammy said? Not important. Can’t be here. Can’t breathe.
Sam pressed his head back against the glass, not able to watch his brother cry anymore. But he couldn’t stop the sound of his brother’s voice as he started talking again. “I don’t know how much time we have left, Cas. So,” Sam heard a quick sniffle and he could imagine Dean putting on a smile, trying to be as strong as he could, “how about one last song?”
“Cas, nothing against ya, but how are you going to take the lead here?” Dean again almost laughed, but he didn’t risk offending the angel in their current position. He didn't know if he would get this chance again.
He wanted to say he was calm and collected, not at all bothered as he felt Cas’s strong legs surround his hips. He told himself that he didn’t even notice the weight of Cas’s ass on his thighs. He definitely didn’t feel Cas’s groin press down into his bare ass, the fabric of his slacks rubbing against his skin, as Cas bent forward to reach for his wings.
Dean tried to remember the words, one last shred of hope holding onto his heart. Maybe this was what he needed to do. Cas wasn’t dead. He could still fix this. But he could barely breathe. He couldn’t even think around the tears in his eyes. The words stopped coming and he knew then that Cas was.. Was...
His mouth was dry as he tried to remember how to speak. “D-Dean.” He gasped and sputtered as he attempted to speak, the cause being that Dean had chosen that exact moment to nip him at the base of his neck. He cleared his throat and said the hunter’s name once more, trying to catch his attention. Cas knew he hadn’t accomplished any more force in his tone, but luckily Dean paused to look up at him anyway. Dean’s brow was furrowed as they both tried to catch their breath. Cas tried to get a handle on what he needed to say, but his tongue felt stuck inside his mouth, unable to form the proper syllables.
Whatever excuse was just beyond Dean’s lips, Cas couldn’t bear to listen to it. “No, Dean. Please,” he lowered the volume of his voice, shocked by the fact that he was nearly yelling. “Please, stay. I need you here.” Cas paused and rethought his approach. “We need you, Dean.”
Cas shot Dean a sickly sweet smile that instantly had Dean worried. “You will find out in due time.” He couldn’t imagine what could make Cas give him that look. It wasn’t like Dean had some secret fetish for country music or something that he was going to out him for. But he let it go, letting them all just relax into a groove of keeping an eye out and catching up with Eileen and the hunts she had been on recently. They also gave Cas tips for his song, whatever it would be, encouraging him to let out his inner rockstar.
“Eileen and I are just debating how serious you are about that.” Dean didn’t even feel embarrassed by the fact that his admission had been said out loud. He couldn’t even try to force it. Everything he needed was in the man on the stage, and for the rest of his life, that would always be enough.
“Well? What are you gonna sing?’ Not that Dean was worried, he knew Cas could handle himself, even if he still hated using him as bait, but he had to admit that he was insanely curious about what kind of song Cas would sing. He tried to not imagine Cas singing something from Frozen or the like. He didn’t want to find out if he could still find Cas attractive after something like that. Singing while the movie played in their room was one thing. He might have to pull Cas’s man card if he pulled it here.
It felt like an eternity, and Dean almost wondered whether Sam wasn’t going to respond just out of spite, but finally the text flashed across his screen. He threw it into his GPS app, sighing in a mixture of relief and frustration that Cas was just under an hour away. He just hoped Cas would be able to hold on for that long.
It had been glorious, which was why he definitely wanted to know where Cas was and why he wasn’t repeating the acts all over again.
After securing the end, Dean sat back, rubbing his eyes with the back of his hand. Cas tested his movement, and while still not pleasant, he felt quite a bit better from this morning. “Thank you, Dean.” He felt like the words weren’t enough, but he saw a slight blush come over Dean’s features at the gratitude.
“No one ever does.” Jody shook her head, a humorless chuckle catching in her throat. She looked concerned as she stared him down, leaving Sam almost desperate to look away, but he fought the urge. “How is he doing?” Tears shown in her eyes. Sam inexplicably wanted to lie and comfort her in that moment, but every ounce of strength he held was being spent on keeping it together for Dean, so the words came in a blunt honest fashion.
Dean nodded quickly, trying not to think too much. “Yup.” Jesus, that’s all he could manage? His inner mantra seemed to just keep repeating:
Dean had barely opened his mouth before Gabriel grabbed his arm and they both vanished. Sam decided that he needed to be in on it all too, due to both the need to know Cas was okay and the need to be involved in everything. So he headed down the hall, trying to keep his steps slow and steady. He stopped at the door as Rowena walked out, her face bright and her hair just a bit less tidy than usual.
Dean sighed as his head hit the pillow and he felt Cas pull out of his body. He couldn’t believe what they had just done. Part of him was shocked, trying hard to yell loud enough that he would pay attention to the fear he felt. But the largest part of him wondered how it hadn’t happened yet. They were closer than anyone else in his life, even maybe closer than he and Sam were, if he were being honest with himself. Hell, he was more open and comfortable with Cas than he had ever been with Lisa or Cassie. It was definitely a shock to think he could have had this from the beginning. He could have been fucked right down into the sheets and feeling this good for years now.
This was a new experience for the two of them. As much as Sam implied that they couldn’t keep their hands off one another, Dean had managed to stay focused for the last few years when they went on cases together. They might sneak kisses and affectionate caresses when hunting, but they had always been able to last through until they made it back to the sanctity of a hotel or the bunker. He still heard his father’s voice when he was tempted to break concentration, reminding him that lives were on the line and that Dean could wait to care for his personal needs until the case was solved.
Gabriel took a chair from Dean’s small table, sitting as he looked Dean straight in the eye. “I won’t sugarcoat it, Dean-o. I don’t know much about the spell. It’s before my time.” Gabriel didn’t pause or wait for Dean to question that. “There were rumors back during Creation that good old Dad had made it possible for us to reproduce. That he had left us a spell. But I thought it was just rumors. Myth.”
“Well, I texted Sammy, so he should be ready to help ya set up a room.” Dean’s light laughter was now gone from Cas’s ears, replaced by the awkwardness from earlier in the day. He fought against the urge to yell obscenities at Dean in that moment, wishing he could just take it back.
“I know.” Sam agreed, nodding as he took the phone back. “I can’t place it either, but I swear we’ve seen this before. Either way, I think he’s right and this is our kind of thing. So we need to saddle up and get out there before karaoke starts tonight.”
Sam noticed when Dean was feeling particularly down because he was quietest then. He would just pull the chair as close to the bed as possible, not talking much, just never leaving Cas’s side. Some days were better though, and Dean would read the paper that the staff had begun leaving them, finding anything that looked even remotely suspicious and describing the cases they would all go on when Cas woke up.
“Wait, Cas, ‘our child’? What do you mean, ‘our child?’” Dean waited for Cas to explain, thinking that he would just say that he had assumed they would do this together, but Cas had another punch left in him.
Minutes flew by before the monitors began to work their way back to the sounds Sam recognized, and though he didn’t register his emotions anywhere near happy on the scale, he felt relieved that it wasn’t yet the end. The nurses shot them sympathetic looks before they left the room, leaving just Dean and the doctor with Sam. He stepped forward to address the doctor, who still seemed to have a look of concern on his features.
Cas pulled away finally and smiled up into Dean’s green eyes. “Do you believe me now, Honeybee?” Dean always tried to pretend he hated the pet name, but Cas knew he secretly wouldn’t change it for the world. The light in Dean’s eyes was always a dead giveaway.
“Dean?” Cas paused again, concern in his tone again. Dean tried to stifle the groan he felt building.
Sam shot an apologetic look toward the nurse’s station before guiding Jody down the hall to the vending machines, giving them some much-needed privacy. “I’m glad you’re here, Jody.” Sam sat in one of the uncomfortable chairs, running his hands through his hair before feeling all the helplessness of the last 24 hours become evident on his face. “I don’t know what I’m doing anymore.” The words didn’t even begin to express the turmoil inside Sam at that moment, but the look of sympathy on Jody’s features said that she understood. She pulled a chair up to face Sam, resting a hand on his knee in a comforting gesture.
But when Dean had come back just moments later, crying
.” Dean playfully smacked his thigh.
“Call Garth and have him send someone with you!” He hated getting into it with Sam. He really did. He wanted to feel bad about it, say he was sorry, go hunting. But honestly? Dean Winchester was a tired black-eyed bastard and he just needed a break.
Sam couldn’t help the smallest smile that formed across his face as he took in the sight of Jody, still in her uniform, arguing with the nurses at their station. Something about her mother-like anger warmed him for just the smallest second, even if he felt guilty at the expression as soon as it settled on his face.
“It’s bad this time. Really bad. I’m not…” Sam took a deep breath before voicing what he had kept hidden since Cas had first been admitted to the ER, “I’m not sure he’s going to make it.” He hung his head, feeling like he was a traitor for not believing in Cas at that moment. But he couldn’t escape the sinking feeling that they were not going to be the same once this was all over.
His gun was drawn and he looked ready to shoot at a second’s notice, but he stood frozen as he took in the sight before him. Dean knew it was a good one. He was still naked, just barely saving face by a lucky placement on the sheets across his groin, Cas still wearing his slacks but definitely looking like he was ready to take Dean for a ride. Dean noted that thought for later, as that definitely seemed like something to add to his to-do list.
Sam wrapped his fingers into Eileen’s hand, remembering again for the first time in more than an hour that she sat quietly beside him. She had a lost look in her eyes, and he felt for her. He knew how she felt, knowing she was of no use in the situation but not knowing whether it would be easier to leave and give the boys their space. Her lip turned up just enough for Sam to notice, showing her concern for both of them in that moment in the only way she could. Sam returned the feeling by silently signing to her,
Dean tapped his fingers along to Zeppelin's “The Rain Song” played through Baby’s speakers. He and Cas had been on the road for about a half an hour, but neither of them had spoken much past small talk. Dean was terrified any second now they would break out in talks of how the weather was right now. He turned the radio down just a bit, before rubbing his hand on the back of his neck.
“That’s supposed to come at the end of the ceremony!” Dean pulled away with a blush, seeing Cas’s eyes twinkle with humor. Their family laughed around them, and Dean felt whatever nervousness he still held flee him. Keeping his arm around Cas’s waist, he led them back up to where Sam stood, book in hand, ready to lead them in the ceremony. Thank Chuck for online ordinations.
“What exactly does the spell do? Gabriel said you’re pregnant, but that can’t be right, can it?” Dean watched Cas’s face, waiting to see the denial he wanted from him, but it didn’t come.
Who, much to Dean’s disapproval, was not still naked and in the bed with him. Which was odd, given that Cas seemed to like taking advantage of morning wood almost as much as Dean did. He sat up, again finding subtle aches all over his body that he hadn’t even known could hurt just the right way until recently. One ache, in particular, put a stupid grin on his face that just wouldn’t quit. Last night had been the first time he and Cas had swapped who was on top, and boy - he had almost thought Cas had just been being kind. Dean was pretty sure there were sounds he made last night that had never left his mouth before and he was pretty sure he blacked out for a solid minute when he came.
“Go on, ya giant. They’re all fine.” Sam had smiled as he walked past, making a mental note to thank her later. Even knowing what he did, Sam couldn’t help thanking Chuck for sending her into their lives. She had somehow begun to feel like a part of their little Team Free Will, as had Gabriel. He wasn’t exactly sure that they would just disappear now that the baby was here.
Cas sat, looking confused, and asked Eileen, signing as he spoke, “What did I miss?” Dean really needed to learn to sign if Eileen was going to be a common occurrence. He couldn’t look like the only uneducated idiot amongst the three of them. Cas’s ability didn’t shock him, as he had retained his knowledge of languages when he had become human, but now that Sam was becoming somewhat fluent, Dean felt the pressure to step up to the plate.
Sam's head snapped left as the doors opened for the first time in what seemed like days, and he stood, worrying that he may have to restrain Dean if the doctor didn’t come bearing good news. Dean had already begun walking toward the man, and Sam used his long legs to catch up.
Dean felt Cas shift under his arm. “We believe so. We still are unsure of what it is, but we’ll do everything within our ability to stop it.” Dean still felt impressed when Cas interacted on their cases, the hunter had come such a long way since his angel days.
Cas’s head reeled at the admission, internally yelling for his brain to catch up and make sense of it all. “But why would I regret our time together?” The words didn’t seem out of place, but they caused Dean to frown just slightly. Cas caught the look and understood. “You still hold onto your low self-worth. Dean-”
“How?” The doctor repeated Dean’s question with a bit of confusion on his features.
The contact however made Dean squirm and Cas pulled back, whispering his name. Dean lifted his head. He swallowed and then decided to just bury any possible thoughts from here out about clothing and skin. He couldn’t take it.
“Cas.” Dean swallowed, forcing his mind to ignore the pleasure ricocheting through him just long enough to get it out. Somehow Cas’s demeanor wasn’t helping either, but he tried to ignore that too. He breathed deep and tried to muster something, anything sexy or coherent. Two words were more than enough, and all he could manage: “Fuck me.”
I'm not really sure what I'm doing here, but I wrote a deleted scene for this story,
“Letting it go. I get it.” Sam closed his laptop and stood, tossing the computer under his arm. “You may not care, but I do. I’m gonna investigate this.” He didn’t give Dean a chance to respond before heading out to the garage.  Dean shouted after him, rolling his shoulders again as the tension there began to return.
Cas looked up to see Chuck still standing before them, having been forgotten in their teasing. Sam had disappeared back into the group of their remaining family members, somewhere across the bunker. “Hope I’m not interrupting anything too critical.” Dean looked like he wanted to say he was, but thought better of it. “I would like to get going, got tons of God stuff to do,” Cas didn’t even try to make sense of what that could possibly mean, “but I have one last gift for you two.” He held out his hand, revealing what Cas saw to be a small vial.
. Jesus. If he knew his body, and of course he did, Dean knew his wings would definitely be a new point of pleasure for him. He thought for a moment before swallowing his pride and lifelong mental hangups.
“Dean...” Cas tried to say more but the pain overtook him then, and he dropped the phone on the ground next to him as he lost consciousness.
Dean laughed, replying, “Thanks. Almost scared how you guys know. Jack’s getting a little brother.” Jack immediately began interrogating Gabriel, as he was closer to the kid, wanting to know every detail. Sam instead chose to focus on Cas and Dean, stepping closer to the bed. He looked like he was at a loss for words, a mix of shock and confusion plastered on his face. Which definitely got even funnier when Dean dropped the next bomb on his little brother.
Dean looked back to where Cas was laying. He had lost himself in the craziness of the moment, but he was starting to worry again. Especially since this included spells and angels. Last time that happened, Metatron had kicked them all out of heaven.
Dean shrugged, “Zeppelin in Baby, too much Disney, and whatever crappy music Sam put on that iPod he got for him last Christmas.” Cas returned just then, setting a beer in front of each of the hunters. Dean took a sip as Sam scoffed and Cas took his seat with his back to the stage.
Jody leaned down, hugging Dean, and they were both surprised when Dean actually wrapped his arms around her neck. She held him gently like a child scared in the night, her need to keep him safe shining bright in her eyes as Sam watched from the far wall. They didn’t share words, only a long embrace before she pulled away and moved to the doorway.
“Like I said, this is gonna suck. Sorry.” Dean grabbed another clean towel and dipped it into the amber liquid that Cas now realized was the same shade as the liquid in the bottle. He braced himself at just the last second before Dean pressed the cloth to his wound. Air hissed in a sharp breath between his teeth as he tried not to cry out from the stinging pain that shot through his shoulder. He saw Dean grimace but he didn’t stop his ministrations, wiping at the fresh blood that was oozing from Cas’s shoulder. He set the towel down and picked up the needle. He glanced at Cas with a look of pity before began sewing the skin beneath his fingers back together.
“Not much, except that this flower was found at the bar afterwards, each time someone went missing.” Sam flipped his phone around to show a picture that Nick had sent him. The flower was simple and light green in color. “I’ve already looked through databases and have come up with nothing.” Sam handed his phone to Dean when his brother reached to take it, hoping the elder Winchester would see something he was missing.
As the music ended, Dean stood, getting ready to grab Cas the minute his feet hit the ground. But he paused as he saw Nick take the stage, slapping Cas on the shoulder before speaking into the microphone in an effort to silence the clapping bar rats. Dean settled back into the chair, trying to ignore the itch in his skin that demanded he have his hands all over Cas.
Tossing the bag onto the hood, a saunter worked itself through his hips as Dean approached Cas’s backside, watching as a shiver ran down Cas’s spine when he slid both his hands down Cas’s back. As his fingers traced Cas’s hips, he gripped and spun Cas around to face him. A playful yet shocked expression lit up the other man’s eyes.
It was about six horrible renditions later that Nick announced that the band was ready for their last singer, a new arrival, Castiel. Dean felt a smile creep across his face as Cas left the table, but again that nervousness returned as Cas shot a sassy look over his shoulder. Dean saw that Cas had left his flannel on the chair, leaving just a tight black tee to cover his muscled torso. Not that Cas had even been overly slim, since becoming human, he had definitely gained quite an amount of muscle due to their lifestyle. Muscle that Dean definitely appreciated and showed his affection for on a frequent basis. Dean had to push his mind back to the case to keep from losing himself in his thoughts of what he wanted to do to Cas when they got back home.
“Maybe you should try going vegan,” Dean hissed with what little breath he still had to speak, “I hear it’s all the rage with kids these days.” Black spots were starting to cloud his vision, but he could see his nonchalance was exactly the thing to piss her off.
“I know you love the guy. But he’s right. He
“Was thinking you might show off your Zeppelin impression. Laughing that hard might actually be worth messing up the case.” Sam grinned when Dean flipped him off, but he was shocked when Cas spoke up next.
Not too much time passed (for Sam at least, Dean complained endlessly that it was taking forever) before Gabriel popped in beside Dean, somehow completely dressed in his fake Dr. Sexy costume, a giant grin on his lips. Sam’s heart relaxed at the excitement he saw in Gabriel’s eyes, knowing it was all going to be just fine. That didn’t exactly translate to Dean, who just seemed like he was tense enough to punch out Rocky Balboa at any sign of danger.
“Spill it. I’m not hungry.” Dean almost sounded disconnected, but Sam knew better. It was his brother’s coping mechanism for everything happening around them. He almost asked why Dean had followed him down here at all, but he knew not to push his luck.
“You know why I do it.” Dean almost looked as if he was a second from pouting, but Sam knew he had to keep it serious for Cas’s sake.
.” Sam’s heart clenched, knowing she would ask more if he didn’t continue.
Final thoughts:
For some reason, the question seemed to make Cas uncomfortable, which Dean didn’t understand in the slightest. “Dean,” Cas began, his voice holding a tone of caution, “most angels only groom those they are… close to. Either fledglings in their care or lovers.” Dean waited for Cas to elaborate, but as always, he stayed silent.
indeed be painful, that is not what I meant, Dean. Our wings become highly sensitive, which some angels find erotic pleasure in.”
“Easy for you. I don’t even know how to start.”
And when the band started playing, Dean thought he might die right then and there.
Dean felt his brow furrow at the statement. “Naomi? What does the bitch want now?”
“I’m going to marry him.” He felt it hit him all at once. He had thought about what their future might be in this life, hunting and live beside one another, but he hadn’t even considered making an honest man out of his angel. He didn’t know what it would mean to marry Cas logistically, having never attended a wedding in his life, but he knew he wanted to spend his future with the man, and that was enough.
“Ok, fine. Totally. We can do this. We’re grown men.” Dean started pulling his shirt off, not even realizing his wings were still there until his shirt hit the floor. “As long as you keep your clothes on. Wait. How did-”
Eileen laughed. “They were arguing, like always, over music.” Dean caught the look that Eileen and Cas shared, which definitely said they felt like kindred spirits for having to deal with their own Winchesters. “I wanted to know if you were going to sing?” She inflected her eyebrows, signaling that she meant it as a question.
But last night he had risked it all in a moment of complete weakness. He was terrified that he now would find Dean closed off to him, that their relationship would now be tainted by the knowledge that Cas wanted what he shouldn’t. He knew Dean was not one to share his feelings, and he had definitely seen Dean’s sexual preferences through the many waitresses and bartenders Dean had taken back to hotel rooms. Cas was everything Dean would want to avoid.
But the look of Cas in the dim light of the parking lot, his bare ass pressed against Baby’s cold metal, his eyes slightly closed, kept Dean from dragging it out further. He dipped his head back down to take Cas in deep, relaxing his throat to keep the gagging from coming again. A gasp ripped itself from Cas’s lips, his head flung back as he hit his release, and Dean swallowed around his cock. He kept his head still, gently stroking out the remnants of orgasm from Cas as the ex-angel shook from the power of it. When he finally pulled away, Dean stood with a wicked smirk, relishing the red tint that now covered his angel’s cheeks. Cas’s breaths were still coming in bursts as he eyed the hunter, though Dean could see that he was slowly coming back down from the delightful high Dean had skillfully induced.
“I knew we had seen that damn flower before. Or something similar.” He pulled to picture out of the stack before trying to locate another page. Dean’s need to find Cas outweighed his need to be gentle with his brother in that moment.
Dean began to open his mouth to speak when Cas suddenly stood, grabbing his slacks from the floor. He pulled them on quickly and Dean felt his heart sink into his stomach. There it was. “Cas?” He spoke softly, not wanting to take them where he knew the conversation was going to lead them.
Dean didn’t know what had overcome Cas, but as he lay listening to him breathe, he was glad hadn’t fought it. He had needed this more than he could have realized. Needed to feel someone’s hands on his skin, lips pressed to his. Someone who cared about him in the morning, and not just in a polite ‘this was fun’ sort of way. Maybe it was his falling out with Sam, Kevin’s death, god, even just the entirety of the last year that had caused him to give in. Knowing that he was hurting much more than he had admitted to himself, and the only person in his life that could possibly understand was asleep by his side. The last year had been no easier on Cas, that was for sure.
Sam watched but didn’t really hear as the doctor explained the process of taking Cas off the machines. They would make sure he was comfortable, nature would take its course, no pain. Sam kept his eyes on his brother for the whole speech, knowing enough about it already. He had begun asking around about a month ago, but he had never figured out a way to tell Dean everything. Partially due to not wanting to hurt Dean any further, but also since he wouldn’t put it past his brother to make good on his threat and shoot him dead in the hospital.
, for their wonderful art. This whole process and story would never have happened without their first piece. AnyRei was so incredibly supportive of every choice I made for this story and I can express how thankful I am for the artist I picked. I would say I have no words, but you all just read 30k that proves otherwise!
Sam watched as his brother froze at the words, his eyes becoming unfocused and drifting off away from the doctor’s face. “He’ll wake up though, right?” Sam hated to ask it, he couldn’t be the one to make the doctor say it, but Dean didn’t seem to be in the condition to keep going. He watched as his brother, tears in his eyes, walked slowly back down the hall. He pulled out a chair and sat, head in his hands. Sam looked back to the doctor, realizing he had been speaking ever since he had looked away, but Sam hadn’t heard any of it. “I’m sorry, what?”
He heard a similar sound come from Jody’s chest. “I’m sure Dean just hates that.” He heard the small smile on her lips, the tears in her voice. How could something still make him smile in the midst of all of this?
Pressing his hips into Cas, he ground his erection into Cas’s groin, delighted to find an equal hardness there. He took in the sight of Cas’s parted lips, the sound of a groan in his chest before he spoke. “So, you’re a rockstar now, Castiel?” Dean used his full name, knowing how much it turned the man on. He slid his fingers into Cas’s waistband, popping his button open with his thumbs. “That must make me your groupie.” Gripping the zipper of Cas’s jeans between his fingertips, he slid himself slowly to his knees, his other hand trailing a path down Cas’s inner thigh.
“So get this.” Such a simple phrase, nothing really out of the ordinary for a day in the life of the Winchester brothers. But for some reason he couldn’t explain, it set Dean off this morning. He set his coffee mug down a bit too harshly on the counter, causing the precious liquid to slosh onto the counter. Dean registered the look of shock in Sam’s eyes as he faced his little brother.
Cas looked just as determined as he shot back, “I am just as capable a hunter as either of you.” Sam tried to keep a composed face, knowing he needed to stay out of this one completely. “And neither of you two can sing worth a damn.” Sam didn’t even try to argue; he had the vocal range of, well, a moose. Dean, on the other hand, looked completely appalled by the assertion.
Cas’s song choice made Dean wonder for just a moment, not only about when Cas had found the time to learn to play the guitar, but how he had hidden it from him all this time. It had obviously been something Cas had practiced extensively, and he knew that the act was done for him alone. That was the weirdest moment of the night; he felt a sudden clarity in the middle of his sex-addled brain. The thought was out of his mouth before he could even think about what it really meant.
“I’m sure he’s fine, Dean,” Sam tried, not feeling an ounce of conviction in his words. The look Dean shot his way told him Dean knew Sam was just trying to make him feel better. “They’d tell us if something happened.” Dean stopped his pacing, running one hand through his hair, the other gesturing wildly toward to doors.
Too bad for Sammy, with the things Dean had planned for Cas, even soundproofing wasn’t going to help.
Sam watched as Dean came around to hug Jody too, giving Claire a moment somewhat alone with him. It spoke for Dean’s ability to pull it together when he finally hit bottom, that he wasn’t curled up inside a bottle somewhere.
“It was never my plan because of how we live. And I never wanted a child of mine to be raised in all of this.” Cas looked away with sadness in his eyes, but Dean pressed on, turning Cas’s face back to look him in the eyes. “But having a child with you? That’s the dream, Cas. I want everything life can offer, as long as it’s by your side.”
“No big deal, Cas.” Dean stood, grabbing his duffle from the ground. He sat it down on the table before pulling out a shirt and pair of jeans. “These should do until we get you back to the bunker.” He set them down on the bed, and Cas was sure now that Dean was avoiding his eyes. He was avoiding looking anywhere near Cas if he could help it. It made the ex-angel just want to pull the blankets underneath him over his head and never be seen again. But he kept his head high, not wanting to acknowledge Dean’s embarrassment and regret. It only made things worse when Dean was confronted about his feelings.
“What now, Sammy?” Dean tried to reign in the irritation in his voice, but it was damn hard this early in the morning. If it weren’t for the hunter’s intimate relationship with insomnia, Dean would still be wrapped in his comforter, sunk deep down into his memory foam. “Who do we have to save now?”
“He should be out by now. They said he’d be out by now.” Sam flicked his eyes toward the clock, not wanting to admit that Dean was right. When they had arrived, Cas had immediately been taken into the emergency room, hospital staff ushering the brothers and Eileen into a waiting area, telling them to sit tight and they would be informed as soon as the staff knew anything. Sam had foolishly thought that those first minutes would be the worst.
“If you would like to be, yes. I know this was never part of your plan and-“ Cas stopped talking when Dean placed his fingers to Cas’s lips.
Before she could process his words past her confusion, Sam shoved the stake soaked with holy oil through her rib cage. She gasped and released Dean, who hit the ground with broken gasps. She staggered back, looking at the wound before she screamed and exploded in a green goo that covered both brothers.
When they broke to catch a moment of air, Cas realized Chuck had decided to take that moment to disappear. He watched as Dean looked around, taking in the rest of their mismatched family. Cas was blissfully happy there in the bunker, the laughter of his loved ones carrying over the music. Not even the growing ache he felt in his body after such a long day could bring him down right now.
“Dean, the doctors said 48 hours-” Sam broke off as a fist collided with his jaw. Dean’s fist, to be exact. He staggered back, stumbling to catch his balance against a table. They were lucky they were nearly alone in the cafeteria, a lone nurse now watching to assess the situation.
“That explains it. Well, Naomi must have known that Cas’s ears were off because she was sending out an ‘all-hands-on-deck’ sort of alert. She found the spell and Cas was the only possible guinea pig she could try it on.”
“I know, Cas.” Dean nodded, looking out into the garage. “I know you mean it. You’re just fighting against a lifetime of doubt.” Cas watched for a moment, content for that brief second to sit in silence. Dean turned back, the smile back in place. “Why would
“Then where shall tonight leave us, Dean?” The hunter didn’t have an answer. But he did have a bed and was feeling awfully good after everything, so why not push his luck? It's not like anything could happen to take it all away, not now that he knew Cas felt the same.
Cas seemed to take in his current state before nodding. His wings vanished from sight, and he pulled his trenchcoat off to lay it on the chair at Dean’s desk. “Before I agree, you should know that you will need to be naked for this, Dean.” Dean felt like Cas had sucker-punched him.
The trees were thick around the trail Dean and Charlie headed down, hiding the clearing to come. But he heard the voices of his family, blood and otherwise, just up the way. He paused just before they came into view, smoothing his new suit jacket down one more time. He counted to ten, wishing he had taken a shot of whiskey from the flask in Baby’s glove compartment. But this was one day he needed to be sober as a goat. He smiled as he realized Cas’s incorrect idioms had finally taken over in his brain. Just like every other aspect of his existence had been touched and changed forever by the man.
“So, you can just be gentle, right?” It seemed like an innocent enough question but Cas’s eyes widened.
? Like you didn’t before?” Dean tried to calm the near hysterical shock he heard in his voice. He couldn’t imagine someone, especially someone who was important in his life, not liking music. His life was one moment away from having a constant soundtrack playing in the background.
“Sorry, bro. Didn’t mean to interrupt, but these two wouldn’t wait any longer.” Gabriel stepped in and took sat back down. A lollipop appeared suddenly, hanging out of his mouth like a cigarette. Dean shook his head with a chuckle and sat back against the headboard, half on and half off the bed. Cas leaned into him and he felt his smile spread wider as he put his arm around his angel’s shoulders.
“Why?”
Gabriel rolled his eyes as if he thought Dean should have figured it out already. “The same thing that the rest of my brothers want: more angels.”
“Great day, you wonderful man.” A devilish look flashed across Dean’s eyes. “Though I have some ideas that could make it even better.”
Bitchface status was confirmed when Sam spoke next. “Why don’t you do it?” Sam’s tone was clipped and sharp, causing Dean’s heart to ache. He knew he was the cause of it, but he couldn’t bring himself to head home to the bunker just yet. Not after everything he had done recently to those he cared about. Sure, Kevin’s death hadn’t been by his own hand, but it was his actions that had gotten them there and no one else’s. There wasn’t any blame left for Sam either, since he was the one who tricked Sam into allowing an angel to wear him as a meat suit. All those unaddressed issues had to be placed on the backburner right now, though.
“I mean, not really. Sam just… set me off.” Dean winced at the tugging he felt in his chest. He was starting to regret biting his brother’s head off. He saw the knowing look in Cas’s eyes and he sighed as he rolled his shoulders another damn time. “Ok, maybe I’m irritable. So, sue me.” He wanted to come off abrasive, to get Cas to leave him be, but he wasn’t feeling it.
"Sunshine, it’s almost time.” Sam could hear the tears in Dean’s voice. “I want you to know that I love you, and I’m sorry I didn’t say it more when it would actually mean something.” Dean sounded like he stopped for a second to take a breath, maybe wiping at his eyes. “I want you to know I won’t be mad if you need to go, Cas.” Sam looked over his shoulder, seeing Dean holding Cas’s hand to his lips in a kiss. “I understand if you don’t have any more fight left in you. I’m not sure I do, either. But please. Please, my angel, if you can, stay with me. I can’t… I can’t do it without you anymore.”
It was one of the ‘trash’ songs Dean despised, something from the aforementioned iPod. Sam tried to shake the shock he felt at Cas picking something so sexual, but he guessed it shouldn’t surprise him too much. Cas had blossomed since joining them permanently in the bunker, that much had been shown to Sam through several examples that were still burned into his retinas.
“No, Dean. I’ll be here.” Dean nodded and stood, following Sam out of the room and down the hall. They walked in silence down to the cafeteria, and Sam almost wished they had a longer hallway to take. Sam wasn’t looking forward to the talk they needed to have. He glanced at his brother, who for once didn’t immediately start loading up a tray of food. Sam wondered whether this was just the beginning of the end for Dean.
“Who is this?” He spat into the phone. They had better have a good reason for interrupting his ‘whiskey and flirting’ session with Candy. The waitress had been giving him the sexiest smile for the last hour, laughing even when he knew that he wasn’t on his game tonight. She was making it too easy for him to see where their night was going to end up.
Dean heard a clatter, the sound of glass shattering on linoleum, causing him to whip his head toward the bathroom. Cas stepped out, his hand pressed below his nose. Dean was on his feet before he even realized he had begun to stand. Blood was pouring from Cas’s nose, running between his fingers, soaking the light blue sleeping shirt he had thrown on after their shower. Cas met Dean’s eyes, panic and pain written all over his face.
“Dean?” Curiosity mixed with confusion filled Cas’s voice, causing Dean to look up through his lashes at him. He wasn’t surprised; this was so unlike them that he almost didn’t believe it himself. But he found his voice, not at all shocked by the sultry tone it held.
Sam looked lost for words for a few seconds, but when he recovered, there was an earnestness in his eyes that Dean hadn’t expected. “Is it just sex, or do you guys love each other?” Dean had to give it to him, Sam was always pretty to the point. He thought for a moment, not sure how to say it exactly, since he and Cas hadn’t really put it all into words.
Sam rolled his eyes, signing to Eileen a translation when he caught that she hadn’t seen what Dean had said. Her face lit up with humor and snark, “Dean Winchester, I’ll have you know, I
Dean laughed at the statement’s truth. “Yeah, Cas. But I also have ‘an affinity’ for you.” Cas stared him down for a moment before smiling.
Dean pulled Cas back to him, capturing his lips again in a moment of panic. He wouldn't give Cas a chance to mistake his worries for more than they were. As he pulled away, he rested his forehead against Cas’s. “I want to, Cas. Definitely.” He breathed, trying to work up the ability to acknowledge the problem that was slowing him down. “I’ve just, never, you know...” He pulled back, hoping Cas could understand his hesitation. He had thought about it all in the past, but Dean had to acknowledge that he had never been with another guy before. It seemed like it couldn't be that different, but it still scared him just a little.
“I forgot to grab this when I found you.” Dean held up a roll of flesh colored fabric. Cas didn’t recognize it, but he knew his complete confidence in Dean shown on his face. “Gotta wrap that rib before we hit the road.” Cas wanted to speak, but then Dean looked him the eyes and they both froze for a moment there. Cas tried to speak, figure out the words to say, put everything behind them, but then Dean nudged Cas’s arm, breaking their gaze. “Lift your arm, bud.” Cas did as he was told, wincing as the movement stretched the muscles over his rib. Dean made fast work, wrapping the tan fabric across Cas’s torso.
There was no question in Sam’s mind that Dean meant it, too, and he leaned against the table rubbing his jaw, massaging the one ache he could actually deal with at the moment.
“Come on, Sam. We should probably go check on them.” He heard the resignation in her voice, the sound of a woman who was ready to hold and comfort when nothing else could be done. He let her lead the way, not really ready himself to be back in the room again with no changes or answers there to help ease the situation.
Everything had been somewhat peaceful in the bunker, a movie playing on the screen as they sat as a family in the Dean Cave. Jack was sprawled on the floor, glued to the cartoon on the screen. Sam had been looking through his databases, searching for their next hunt, no matter how much Dean scolded him for not being able to take a break from it all. Cas sat on a pillow in between Dean’s feet, his head resting on Dean’s knee. There was a tranquility around them all, his ‘Team Free Will 2.0’ as he had called them not too long ago. He let himself bask in the quiet of their lives, just happy that he could sit back and breathe for once.
Because Dean Winchester, in that moment in the bar, was complete putty under his lover’s gaze.
“I get it.” Dean shrugged, best he could at least while he was on his back, and tried to not look torn up. A hunter's training and years of hardship had given him the ability to hide it all far too easily.
“Your boy has some pipes.” He smiled as he patted Dean on the shoulder, which Dean was starting to pick up as the man’s general sign of affection. “I think you found a good one, Dean.” Dean nodded, still keeping his attention on the stage. He vaguely registered Nick walking away back to the bar. He couldn’t imagine what Cas might sing next. He almost,
Against the back wall of the building lay a body, though the lack of lighting made Dean unsure of whether it was Cas or not. What he wouldn’t give to have Cas back in his trenchcoat again; that thing stuck out like a sore thumb. He put Baby in park, threw the door open and cautiously approached the body, his gun finding its way into his hands just in case this was some trap. But as he grew closer, he saw that the body was indeed Cas, and he was covered in blood, the discarded phone lying near his hand. Dean holstered the handgun and dropped into a crouch next to Cas’s unmoving form. He reached to check for a pulse, but as his fingers touched Cas’s neck, Cas’s eyes flew wide with fear. It passed and was quickly replaced with a mixture of pain and relief.
“I’m right here, Baby.” Cas turned his face into Dean’s palm with a smile before his eyes finally opened. There was a look of tiredness there that Dean didn’t care for, but he let it go for now. “How are you feeling, Cas? Gabriel told me… something about what’s going on.” Cas’s eyes bugged a bit at the mention of his elder brother, but he seemed to just accept that Gabriel was just, well, Gabriel.
him!” Dean chuckled in acknowledgment, a look of realization flashing across his face. Dean stood, stretching his back. Sam took the cue and stood as well.
While Dean still remained a demon (though Cas had mentioned that he wondered if Dean might now constitute as “other”), his soul had become significantly less tainted in the process. He cared about those around him again, and he no longer bore the need to stab Sammy in the throat (though the man could still rile him with his patented bitch stares). He seemed to also retain some of the freedom that he had gained in becoming a demon. He no longer felt the constant weight of his life hanging on his shoulders. He could finally breathe for the first time in his life, and he wanted to enjoy that every once in a while.
Sam held his brother, feeling smaller than he ever knew possible. He wanted to find the words, but he knew they didn’t exist. He wanted a spell, a miracle, something to save both the brothers he was watching fade away, just like the setting sun beyond the window. Pulling himself just an inch away from where he had fallen to the ground with Dean, Sam focused on the work the staff around the room were setting out to accomplish. They were nearly done now, stepping quickly and efficiently, silent as they gave nature it’s chance. Their final act was to remove the breathing tube from Cas’s throat, letting him take in his last tastes of the air around them.
Dean was sitting in a bar when his phone had rung. He looked at it in a bit of shock, as it was one of the cells that only Sam and Cas kept track of, but it didn’t register as one of theirs. The sound almost went unanswered, as Dean remembered where he sat with Sam currently. There wasn’t enough alcohol in his system for the type of talk they had in their future. But something made him answer; gut reaction, instinct, intuition, he wasn’t sure.
“Everything.”
Cas slowly began to take in his surroundings as consciousness began to seep itself into him. Below his body was a somewhat plush surface, though not quite as soft as the beds in the bunker. His eyes opened to find Dean nowhere to be seen, but he did recognize the tacky fashion stylings of a budget hotel. The damage on his body immediately scolded him by both spinning the room around him and wracking him with an assault of various pains. Dean’s voice in the distance repeated the sentiment. He looked toward the sound and found Dean returning from the bathroom, holding towels and a bowl of water.
Any fear he felt flew itself right out of his brain at that moment. He writhed underneath Cas, unabashedly moaning in time with the angel’s movements. He almost didn’t process the fact that he was slowly becoming less tense as the seconds passed. And somehow, in the same way, he began feeling the tension rise in other parts of his body. His fingers gripped the sheets. His toes weren’t quite curled, but they were getting pretty close to it. Dean tried to think long enough to form words, but he only heard pants leaving his lips. About the time Cas pressed a second finger into him, those pants turned back into moaning gasps.
“Not long after I raised you from the pit, I began to become connected to your prayers.” Dean nodded, already knowing this part of their story. “That included any prayers that were regarding you as well.” Confusion flashed across Dean’s features. “Souls in heaven are still able to pray, and I found that your mother and father did so frequently.” Understanding flashed through Dean’s eyes, which were quickly filled with tears.
Thank you to everyone who read all the way to this point! You guys stuck it out, and I have to know:
“Are you enjoying yourself, Dean Winchester?” Cas ran his fingers lightly across his right wing, sending an electric shot straight through to his groin. A smile spread generously across Cas’s lips, which almost did more for Dean than any touch of his feathers.
Cas’s eyes flashed with defiance and Dean felt himself cower under the gaze just slightly. “Dean, you will not attempt to decide for me what I can and cannot do. Furthermore, the spell creates a new angel, not a Nephilim, so while I cannot be certain, I do not think the process will bring harm to me or our child.”
Usually, it was easy to focus, Cas being just as determined to save people and hunt things. He took their family business seriously, for which Dean was grateful. They worked incredibly well as a pair, their ability to read each other silently having saved their asses in cases too many times to count. Dean sometimes even thought Cas had become a better partner than what he had in Sammy, though he reasoned that might be pushing it.
Ignoring the growing ache in his knees, Dean bobbed his head slowly in time with the distant sounds of the bar’s music. One hand stayed occupied on Cas’s cock, the other came down to palm himself through his jeans. A groan in both pleasure and frustration caught in his mouth, the vibration causing Cas to echo the sound. Dean tried to stay focused and ignore the building ache in his groin. As hard as he was, he wanted to give this to Cas. There would time after the case for more, he would make sure of that.
Dean cut him off again. “Whatever, Sam. I ain’t giving up on him.” Unshed tears lined Dean’s eyes, and now Sam wondered if they were from anger or sadness. “So, you can stay or go. But I’ll be in his room.” He started to turn away before surprising Sam by turning back. “And if you try to talk options again, Sam, I’ll kill ya.”
“Dean, something…” Cas broke, pressing his free hand to his temple, “Something is wrong.” The words had barely left his lips when Dean saw nothing but the whites of his eyes, blue and black rolling back into Cas’s skull as his legs went out from underneath him. Dean lunged to catch Cas before his head met the floor, just barely reaching him in time.
He didn’t know how long he stood there, basking in the worry-free space before his legs grew weak and he lowered himself ungracefully on the shower floor. He half sat across his legs, his head resting against the wall, back to the water’s healing. The temperature was still hot enough to feel pleasant, so he just relaxed there, eyes closed, and he took a second to give his regret the attention it wanted from him. He regretted his weakness, his inability to keep his control as he had done for so long before. He loved Dean Winchester more than he ever believed an ex-angel could. He didn’t really know when he had realized it, never really gave himself the clearance to process it all in depth. Maybe he had loved him since their escape from hell, and while he had been enraptured by the soul he had seen, he knew meeting Dean on earth had truly driven it all home for him. The way the man smiled in the face of danger, laughing anytime Cas made mistakes, his kindness despite never having grown up with a model of it, all of this had slowly worked its way into Cas’s entire being, like a virus that he couldn’t sweat out.
He didn’t have words, but he knew Cas wouldn’t need them. He had told him countless times that they were family now. Cas was his brother, blood or no blood. Sam patted Cas’s hand once before walking away, feeling himself breaking down fast. He leaned against the wall just outside the door, trying to fight back his tears. But when he heard Dean begin talking, all hope he had was gone. It took everything he had to not end up on his knees then and there.
“Yes, Dean.” Cas paused and looked a bit concerned. Dean knew Cas could probably read the hesitation he felt. He knew it was written clearly on his face. “If you do not wish to-”
Dean gave the slightest of shrugs as he pushed the needle back in again. “I’ve been doing this my whole life. Stitches are easy.” Cas scoffed around the lump in his throat, causing Dean’s hand to freeze for a second as he looked to Cas’s face. He went back to work as he continued to speak. “You mean pain? Life?” He flicked his eyes to Cas’s face, looking for confirmation. Cas nodded tensely. Dean cut the line after tying a secure knot. He leaned back, stretching his neck again. “Honestly? It sucks.” His eyes swept over Cas’s torso, seemingly deciding that nothing else was severe enough to need the needle, for which Cas was grateful. He set it down on the table and picked up another fresh towel to wipe down the blood that still remained. When he spoke again a few moments later, Cas had to listen hard to hear him.
killed. “Anything on the bathroom?” Nick flipped the signal through a few channels before stopping on a feed of the sinks in the men’s bathroom. He began rewinding the tape quickly, sending them through a high-speed replay of the last ten minutes or so. He stopped and pressed play when Cas walked into the restroom.
“You had the option of taking me to Sam.” He saw an emotion flash through Dean’s eyes, though he wasn’t sure what it was as he tried to understand the hunter’s motives. He continued, lowering their arms but not letting go. “But you are here, washing blood from my skin, after leaving Sam and me there in the street. Why?” Cas felt his heart beating rapidly in his chest, not from pain, but some unrecognizable emotion, feeling suddenly very aware of how close he sat to the hunter, his legs cradled between Dean’s, his hand on his wrist. Dean would usually have chided him about personal space by now if the situation were any different.
Cas’s head swam from their actions, and he realized he was just acting on his gut instincts now. A passing thought wondered if he should be ashamed of how lost he was in Dean, but it flew away as quickly as it had come. Cas had long passed the point of going back, about the time he had stopped processing each movement individually, now just registering how quickly they were both breathing, hands fly over each other’s skin, the taste and feel of the thin layer of sweat that covered them both. Cas found a moment of clarity and realized that, while he had never felt pleasure like this, he needed more. Dean was stroking feverishly over Cas’s cock, while Cas’s hands now clawed Dean’s back as his hips thrust into Dean’s hand.
