He takes a back alley to avoid Baker street, he’s not sure he has the strength to walk by 221B. Which is, of course, how he runs into his dad.
The blond boy is shirtless now, revealing the the knot work of scar tissue on his shoulder. He would need a closer look at the wound to be sure, but it looks like John took care of the wound himself, cauterising what must have been a gaping hole with some sort of burning metal. He has different coloured bruises running along his ribs and arms, but there aren’t as many as Sherlock would expect for a boy that had won twenty fights in twenty days.
“I’m sure you can,” Lestrade agrees, drawing a powerful breaking rune in the air. The mark flashes with power, slamming into the spell with a sound like breaking glass.
“Yes,” Hamish sighed, “he’s been rather propriety of late.”
Sherlock stood, approaching him so quickly that he forced John up against the wall, crowding him into the tiny space. John dropped the gun, held his hands out in surrender.
The five minutes seemed endless. Sherlock spends them watching the clock, avoiding looking at the people he would share his Vision with. His stomach rolls uncomfortably and his fingers twitch, the craving for cocaine is almost unbearable, but he could not undertake the Vision without a system clean for at least three days.
Sherlock spins around. Above them, in the wavering light of his torch, Sherlock sees a wall of coal black fur and eyes like burning embers.  The hound snarls, leaping from the ledge of the hollow to land in front of Sherlock. He can feel the snarl deep in the primal centers of his brain, can feel the rush of adrenaline in his system as his body prepares for fight or flight.
He finds what he is looking for in the largest of the temples. Surrounded by offerings is the statue of Harihara, and even without slipping his gaze to the corporeal plane, he can see the power radiating from it.
“I’m not in yet,” John remarked, offering a slight smile.
“I can’t bond you to Sherlock, I’m not sure why, it just won’t take, but I may be able to bond you to the Holmes name. Banshee use to protect certain families in Ireland many years ago correct?”
Sherlock was five the first time he saw his mother’s bare wrist. She wore an intricate, white, leather band around her right wrist at all times. One morning, however, Sherlock went into her room in the early morning.
When the cab pulls up, Sherlock and another man get out. The other man is shorter, with blondish-grey hair and his left arm in a sling. There a gold bond like a steel cable between them, so bright it’s hard to look at.
John’s grip tightens on his weapons, when his gaze meets Mycroft’s, it is wide with stunned fear.
“Moriarty, his name is Moriarty,” Mr. Hope sobs.
“What makes you think there is one?”
They are rare things, summoner’s cloaks. They have to be earned by years of study and practice and are brought into creation by the summoner themselves. A sentient piece of clothing with the sole purpose of protecting their owner. No one but the summoner can wear their cloak. Lestrade can feel the power in its weave, and wonders at how a kid could have produced such a thing.
“It is not this hot in London,” Sherlock scowls, shooting him an affronted look at the swat.
“Just Z for me,” the youngest says, and it must be an inside joke because the others jostle and tease him.
“What is that?” John asked when he was sure they were gone.
“No,” she laughs, “we take train, la.”
“Right, yes,” Lestrade manages to extract his hand. “Thank you for your cooperation, sir.”
anything.”
Vacillating between being impressed and furious, Lestrade settles for something in the middle. “I promised your brother I would keep you safe. That was good work, but you could have waited. Don’t make a liar out of me.”
“Can’t you deduce it?” Sherlock snarls, sitting up.
Trusting in the archangel and her bond, John continues down the path, dodging past the fighting. He’s running now, shield out in front to light the way. He’s breathing hard by the time he reaches another open chamber. It has become even colder, the walls slick with ice.
“Certainly,” Irene grins, shuffling over so she is effectively invading Molly’s personal space.
“John, John,” Sherlock is gasping, wheezing while clutching at his shoulder, his grip is white-knuckle tight and it looks like he is about to wrench his own shoulder out of socket.
Hamish was able to remove the drainage tube after three days, but the catheter had to stay.
Lestrade ignores the statement. He heads for his fridge, tossing his suit jacket and crumpled tie on one of the stools as he goes. There isn’t much on the shelves, but he finds an old beef and broccoli take-away that doesn’t smell too bad. He eats it cold, straight out of the container. It’s disgusting and vaguely gelatinous, but it’s food - sort of.
Unfortunately, Mycroft is now aware of his wanderings into Moriarty’s domain, and Greg is gathering up a taskforce to take down Baskerville. Sherlock had told him, rather unintentionally, that Moriarty would have to be present for the twenty-fifth fight - if John made it that far.
“Oh hell no,” Lestrade steps protectively in front of the coffee pot.
Mycroft wonders how the city appears to him, if he can see the power running through every structure? He hums in agreement, London magic has a regimented feel to it, running smooth and orderly. Hong Kong is wilder, the untamed thrum of the elements running like fire through his veins.
day to elaborate,” Lestrade huffs, over the years he’s gained some immunity to Sherlock’s particular brand of snark.
Sherlock looks down at their arms for a moment before darting in and pressing a brief kiss to John’s lips, so quick it might as well have been a breeze. “I will,” he promises, before heading down the street.
“Helios,” he gasps. He had been so close to losing her. His body aches all over and now that the adrenaline is fading, his thumbs are agony, but with Helios pressed against him, none of that matter.
There is a lot of Hindu references in this chapter, I did as much research as I could, but if I missed anything or worded something wrong, I apologize, and please tell me.
“Hmm,” Billy agrees, “Great for business, eh Gary?”
He breaks down and sleeps that night, too irritated to do much else, but the next morning he starts his research. The jade dragon pin is surprisingly easy to find with the right search term. It only takes a few pages to pull up an excerpt. As suspected, the pin is from the Qin Dynasty. A gift given to the emperor Xiaowen for aiding a river dragon. Though reports vary as to the abilities of the pin, everything from healing to a powerful spell focus. The pin was promptly passed on when the emperor died rather suddenly a year into his leadership. The excerpt follows the pin until its disappearance in the 18th century.
Mycroft’s face grew pinched, like he’d swallowed a lemon. “Sherlock, I’m not making idle suggestions, Moriarty is the most dangerous man in Britain.”
“Its okay,” Sherlock murmurs, watching him run off. He’s still thinking about the boy as he begins to carefully pack up his violin, in no mood to continue playing.
“I’m to be given 24 hour unrestricted access to the labs,” Sherlock orders, with his customary rudeness.
The jeep is still tumbling when everything goes black.
It is of course when he is starting to feel foolish and lets his shoulders relax, that his senses flair in alarm. They are crossing a small street when something shifts in the shadows.
He smiled at his…bond mate. He couldn’t believe at thirty-four years old he was just meeting the man. The fact that his mate was a man at all was a little startling. John had never found himself attracted to a man, but he thought Sherlock certainly had a body to be admired.
“Doesn’t look much like a military base,” Lestrade comments, from the back seat. He had demanded to accompany them after the call.
“I need a closer look,” Sherlock tells him. Dewer’s Hollow is more of a ravine, remnants of an old cave system most likely. The fog settles thicker in the hollow, and Sherlock can see, at least objectively, how it could be considered ‘spooky’.
This daemon, however, was curled around a shivering little boy. His hair was so blond it was almost white and his eyes were a wide, petrified blue. He was also clutching a book of mythical creatures - that explained some things.
He raises the violin over his head and Sherlock losses it. “No,” he screams, rushing forward to try and take the instrument back. Bruiser just snickers and kicks Sherlock in the chest.
The snarls have dropped to irritable growls, as the hound realizes that -for now- it’s prey is out reach. It circles the cage, back hunched and paws surprisingly silent as it stalks about in a manner more similar to a tiger than a dog.
Mycroft shakes his head. “No, I’m fine, and now I know where we need to go next.”
Sherlock scoffed, “This is not the first time I have been asked to find a mate and will not be the last. What makes you think I would take your case Mrs. Adler?”
John laughs, and he knows it sounds bitter, “Sometimes I can’t either, but it’s important. If nothing else I know that.”
“Fine, but what do they want?” John asks, shifting so he can face Z. “Bauza got shot in the arm,” he adds.
Lestrade can’t help but chuckle at that, even if he’s certain John’s gift is a little stronger than that. Sometimes gifts are small things, like Anderson who can see underwater or Sally with perfect pitch, but sometimes gifts are amazing skills. Sherlock’s gift would rank pretty high on the scale, it’s only reasonable that his mate’s would as well.
To pass the time, Seb has turned the knife on Sherlock’s bare chest. Every few minutes he takes the blade and cuts a thin tally mark. The cuts are small, shallow, and mostly harmless. Sherlock knows that it is the equivalent of being covered in papercuts, but it doesn’t stop his stinging nerves, made even worse as the cuts from above bleed into the cuts below.
“Sorry,” he murmurs, running his fingers along the lapel with a whisper of a drying spell. The coat is spelled to repel water, but hours under snowfall is a bit beyond the spell. During the walk back he contemplates the build of a stronger weatherproofing spell. Or a potion, perhaps with pooka fur, hmm.
Seb straightens his relaxed posture, and fixes John with a fierce look that promises violence.
Murray, their unit’s medic, saved John’s life and pulled him onto the helicopter. That was when things got strange.
“It’s alright,” John tries to assure him, but Mycroft only shakes his head.
Sherlock scowls, but doesn’t argue.
Sherlock hardly eats, he managed to break into Greg’s computer to look at the arrests, but not everyone was processed yet. He tells himself to stop worrying and for a time it works.
“It seems that Moriarty’s new pet is following his own agenda, interesting.” Sherlock tucked his hands under his chin in his usual thinking pose. He walked through his mind palace, digging up the brief meeting of the man.
Bruiser grins, squeezing the neck of the violin until the wood creaks. “Yeah, I’ll take your earnings, but I also think I’ll make sure you never make the mistake again.”
Mycroft's Pocketwatch by
“What was that?” John asks.
Lestrade has a gift for seeing the connections between people, but he's still not sure if he regrets seeing the connections between Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock sent out. “Ah Sally,” he gave one of his fake smiles, “I can ensure you the mark is genuine, but I can understand your confusion with such a paltry bond as your own. It must be difficult to identify the real thing.”
“Enough,” Lestrade interrupts. “You’ve clearly been compelled. We can talk at the station, we have a room that will keep you safe.”
The Golem’s hand slams into it, the sounds reverberating down the tunnels as the spell catches then shatters.
Helios is on the other side of the room. She has a muzzle on and a metal chain around her neck, the lead wrapped around an stone support pillar. She can open her mouth just wide enough to talk, but not wide enough to produce much flame.
“Well then come with me,” Sherlock dodges him by simply walking over the coffee table, “and unclose it.”
Sherlock has been to the museum only once, four years earlier. They had taken a family trip into London, and Mycroft had volunteered to show Sherlock around since neither of them had been much interested in shopping. When they had stopped outside the museum, Sherlock had complained, having little interest in antiquities, until Mycroft had showed him the special exhibit on pirates through history. He shoves the memory away, there is a case on, no time for sentiment.
They all nodded, looking rather impressed by the story.
“Are you alright?” John asks at his side. The angel looks fretful, eyes darting over his body in concern. He’s been even more protective than usual since the vision in New York.
“You were watching,” John snarls, pointing Trial at him, hands steady.
Mycroft taps the line John had indicated, “I’m surprised you recognize the structure?”
Lestrade glances at Mycroft, and it is obvious that there is a conversation passing in the silence. “Yeah,” Lestrade concedes, “I’ll take you.”
Hamish wasn’t surprised when Carson came down with the inevitable Staph infection, but he hit it hard with a dose of Vancomycin and kept the wounds clean. Dealing with infections was much easier when you only had one patient.
James and an older angel had been there when he was taken to the Compound. The older angel had fled before John even learned his name. James, only two years older but already jaded, had offered him comfort. He taught him the magicks that did not come as naturally to him and helped him craft his weapons. When Uriel had come they had welcomed her with open arms and in some ways, they had become a family.
The boy snorts, amused. He holds his hand out to help Sherlock up, his grin wide. “The name’s John, and that was bloody amazing.”
He has to dig in his locker for a moment to find a clean PCS top. Its one of the new ones he was issued before deployment, the fabric is stiff and scratchy. It takes some effort to fit even his small wings through the standard opening in the back. His pale grey feathers are all askew, he needs to have them preened, but there aren’t many of his fellow soldiers that he would trust with job.
“Why are you here?” John growled, clearly tired of the game.
John has paced the length of 221B at least thirty times before 1130. He was wired with adrenaline, even though he’d spent the length of the night before listening to Sherlock screech on the violin.
They bickered back and forth until the puzzle was filled out. “I’ll see you tomorrow, Carol. Keep safe, yourself,” John gave her the rest of his breadsticks and left the park.
Lestrade flips through the reports. “No signs of alcohol or drugs in any of the victims, but the necromancer that read the bodies reported increased…Huh.” He flips through the reports, checking that they match up.”
When John’s medication is reduced enough that he can actually wake up and remember the experience, a month has passed.
Mycroft allows the evasion, “Much better, I’ve never had such a power drain before. That lightning spell might have been a bad idea.”
Smith sighs again, filling the line with static. “At least let me prepare an escort for you.”
“No, and I left a surprise in your room, you should appreciate it,” Jim beamed.
“Yeah, that’s true,” he chuckles, seemingly unfazed by Sherlock’s gruffness.
“All right then,” Greg shrugs, though he’s curious what in the world Sherlock needs to test for a case that is years old.
“I’m guessing you have an opinion about the girls?”
“I know that,” Sherlock snarls, “a dissipate spell can weaken it, will your little knife be enough.”
he thought.
Riddell pressed against his side, ears back in discomfort. “There’s someone here,” she growled.
“Doc,” Agent Smith actually seems to blush. “I’ve got some new recruits.”
What!? I updated, how did that happen?
“I met with some Army blokes in the mountains and they helped me out, but we got into a mess trying to get out of the country. I don’t remember most of it, I woke up in the hospital. Apparently I was a good candidate for an experimental procedure.” John is surprised to find no bitterness in his voice as there would have been a year ago. While the idea of what, exactly, his leg is sometimes makes him sick, he is still glad to have it.
“Anything useful?”
He kneels down, revisiting the urge to dry heave, that is a smell you never get used to. The motions for a diagnostic spell are second nature to him now, he draws in the air above the body causing the hands, forearms, and most of the face to shimmer. “Hmm magic residue consistent with defensive wounds and suffocation.”
“On his cot, just sitting there. His CHU mate came back from guard duty late and found him dead, not sure why he never called out for help. We confirmed the CHU mate’s story, he was up in tower for over twelve hours. I just don’t understand how this man managed to get shot in the middle of Q pod, and no one reported it.”
“Hey, you again!” someone calls.
John feels some of the tension in his shoulders lessen. “Really?”
Lestrade busies himself trying to find sugar. “Yes, obviously, silly me. Asking would just be the height of madness. Well you aren’t going to find the answer looking through my junk drawer. Do you want toast?”
“So that’s it then, you just roll over and show your belly.”
“So, his name is Moriarty,” Sherlock stood outside the museum, admiring the stars and his success.
John shot him a wry grin across the cab.
“It will be all right,” he says, and thinks it has to be, because he finally found him. In all the world, Sherlock found his perfect match in the form of this small army doctor, and he is here, standing with him, holding his hand. If that could happen, if, in all the world Sherlock could find John, then maybe he is a little optimistic after all. Maybe, just maybe, he has some hope.
“Sort of, Sherlock managed to get Mr. Hudson a guaranteed trip to the chair, but in the process he was almost eaten by an alligator and this guy comes out of no where and saves him. They yelled at each other a bit and Sherlock tossed his bonded soul metal at the man and marched off. I haven’t managed to get him out of his room since. Greg is still trying to assimilate everything that had happened.
“It’s Mycroft’s ID,” Sherlock smirks.
“No, I think you know exactly when to bite,” Jim nipped at his collarbone in teasing, than he was getting up, leaving the bed with a stretch. “I want you to take the day off, go do something…fun” he flicked his wrist lazily.
“For the plan,” he snaps, muscles bulging along his back, fur sprouting along his face. “You can’t be allowed to go on.” He pounces.
He would have quickly made his way back to the lab if it wasn’t for a shocked voice behind him that makes his heart freeze in his chest.
Look who isn't dead!
“We’ll take the case!”
There is a series of different labs off the main one. He takes the first door he comes across. There is a row of incubators on one side and three hoods on the far wall. He opens one of the incubators, it has another plastic door sealing in the heat and the CO2, but he can easily see the canisters of petri dishes and smell the overwhelming scent of rotten potatoes. He closes the door quickly, but it is a smell that lingers.
He pulled out a large needle, 14 gauge, Sherlock thought. He pushed down John’s top and shoved against his vest as he felt for the second and third rib. With a jab, he shoved the needle through flesh and muscle. There was a whistle of air as pressure was released. Murray sighed in relief while he pressed a valve over the needle to keep it in and the hole open.
“Then the Army let you go?”
Sherlock has to bite back a yell, the strain pulling at his wounds. “Talked to Jim,” he guesses.
“Told you,” Hamish pointed out Angelo, “Despite his interesting past, Angelo is an excellent chef.”
“No, it’s fine, really,” Sally says, but her voice is soft and her eyes are still wide.
Sherlock watched Jim leave, too stunned to move.
Sally looks down at the body, brow furrowed. “It’s too early to tell, but look at the bruising,” she gestures at his arms and legs.
Mrs. Hudson was ecstatic to see him and spent some while telling him about her dreadful time in Florida while they waited for the scones to come out of the oven.
Don holds up his fist, causing the group to halt as he scouts the surrounding area. Something has caught his attention. Whatever it is, he shakes it off and they continue down the filthy path.
DI Gregson was kneeling over the male victim, he was holding a scratched up badge.
John follows his gaze, looking over his left shoulder. “Oh,” he gasps. He doesn’t know how he could have possibly missed it, the shift. Where once he had only had one set of wings, there is now a second. Connected just below the primary set is a slightly smaller pair of wings, white with golden tips.
John called over the link, a warning.
“Davidson.”
James shrugs, a familiar smirk quirking his lips. “Agents have last names. I thought it fitting.” He straightens, stepping close. His gaze is as piercing as ever. John can feel the flood of his magic washing over him.
“I’m not, but I have a skull I need to clean and I plan on doing that tomorrow evening,” Sherlock sniffs, looking oddly prim.
She grasps his shoulder giving it a squeeze. “Sorry.”
She nods, a scowl darkening her features. “A swarm of Hantu, more annoying than harmful, but it took a number of banishing spells.”
His shirt is equally torn and blood that looks dark in the dim lab has stuck his sleeve to his arm as effectively as glue. He rolls up his sleeve slowly, the tacky blood pulls against his wounds and send spikes of pain up his arm.
Lestrade heads over to Baker Street with his metaphorical tail tucked between his legs.
“Move,” Sherlock shouts.
Lestrade snorts, “That might be an accurate assessment, however, he has proved...useful to the case.”
Things don't work out quite the way Sherlock wants.
“I meant what I said,” John takes his gaze from the road long enough to shoot him a glare, “I can’t.”
They go through the door together, Sherlock trailing behind.
“Its not malicious,” Sherlock huffs, he doesn’t know how the man ever got into police work. He never looks. Sherlock tugs the letter open and flips its contents onto the counter. Out pours a single sheet of paper and a sturdy chain.
The hound lifts its giant head at the sound, scenting the air. It gives a rumbling growl before turning from Sherlock. It leaps easily out of the hollow, disappearing into the surrounding woods like a ghost.
“Oh,” Irene gasps, speechless for the first time. She removes the delicate cuff over her right wrist to reveal a matching mark. “You were the girl in the park.”
“T..th..this is it,” Henry stutters, wrapping his arms around his middle.
John knew these were normal reactions from the newly bonded, but he enjoyed the sight of the mark all the same. “Morning,” he greeted, grabbing the mug Sherlock had made, exactly as he liked it.
He knows what he needs to do, clear as day. Sherlock reaches out, fingers sparking with power. The mark fights, but he’s expecting it, redirecting the attack with a flick. The flower pulls from the skin like yanking a plaster, leaving behind a dark smudge.
Bauza takes lead, with Z and Murray not far behind. Harry is just behind them with John following as closely as he can with Don hopping at his shoulder.
“Course, Hyperion smells like ozone and chemicals, he’s rather unique,” Helios practically purred.
“Yes,” Q grins, “The wood is actually from an ancient ash tree, it’s a natural conduit. The fabric is woven with pooka fur, freely given. It will offer some protection against magical attacks, and of course,” Q winks, “keep you dry.”
Watching Wiggins die in the field would be like condemning two.
The trip through base is a blur, John is barely conscious, his ribs feeling like they are being cracked open from the inside. He registers James’ shout and then there are hands on his chest, the feel of sigils being drawn.
An older woman answers the door with a “You must DI Lestrade.” She introduces herself as ‘Mrs. Hudson, I’m the landlady, dear, not the housekeeper.’ She has a dark mark on her hand from a broken bond, her connection curls jagged around her arm like black barbwire, but she has a warm orange strand that disappears upstairs, and Lestrade’s pretty sure she’s less landlady and more Sherlock’s adopted mother.
When he gets back to the house, Mr. Hawthorne is still gone. Though he isn’t surprised, a check of the calendar by the door reveals that it is boxing day. That is a surprise. He often loses time while researching, but he hadn’t meant to miss Christmas.
“John stop! You have to stop!” It’s Gabriel that’s yelling at him, but he can’t concentrate. The pain is too much.
with the world, Sherlock’s certain he has never looked like that before. The close up zooms out, revealing the blond, who he suspects is John. They are holding hands gazing into each others’ eyes as Mycroft stands behind them, reading from a bible. There is an exchange of rings and kisses, and Sherlock thinks his heart has stopped beating.
The first bottle contains a concentrated belladonna tincture, a single drop would cause tachycardia, convulsions,  hallucinations, and, finally, death. He adds 3 measured drops to the paste.
“Yes,” Smith answers, tapping on seemingly random spots on the door. At the fifth tap it swings open on silent hinges. “Part of being an All Seeing Eye,” he shoots Mycroft a look, “is that spells that are designed to trick the senses don’t work on you. That tapestry was woven by a skilled sorceress, each thread was imbued with protection. Unless shown the tapestry by someone who already knows it is there, most will never see it at all.”
Agent Smith has his back to him, but John can read the tension in his shoulders, the stiff way he holds himself. He also notes the double shadows stretching behind him. “He was captured.”
Hamish finished his biscuit to hide his worry. A surprise? He opened the door with some trepidation.
Sherlock makes him dress up in some old witch’s garb that makes him look like some homeless palm reader. John then spends the next 4 hours limping around downtown London with Helios at his side. Occasionally, he has Helios wander far enough away from him to look suspicious. John’s never felt so exposed, but his heart beats calm in his chest and his hand is steady. The handgun pressed against his back is a solid comfort.
Lestrade stares at him, but he ignores it, flopping over on the couch.
He remembers that time now. Mycroft is less than a meter away, collapsed in a heap. For just a moment John can’t feel his magic, feels the same emptiness he had felt all those years ago, but no, his magic is just drained, like a inferno reduced to the flicker at the end of a matchhead.
“Sixteen in full ruck,” the leader grins, “Come on over kid and grab some grub.”
Sherlock glares at the bread placed in front of him, but still pulls off a small piece to nibble on.
When the time to escape comes, Harry is late.
“It is fine, it only tore the fabric,” Sherlock scowls, wriggling his finger through the holes in his Belstaff.
“Yes, not fully, though. He’ll have to finish that bit on his own time.” This time Sherlock is immediately aware of Mrs. Hudson’s voice. She sounds tired and concerned.
Agent Navamas wishes them well in the lobby, needing to head back to the train station.
“Well, I’ll just have to go a show them how wrong they are,” Sherlock stands in flurry, drawing his coat to him with a flick of his fingers.
When the police were gone, John ran a hand along his Daemon’s side, feeling the muck that had gathered in her once beautiful fur. “Carol warned us to be careful.”
“The Irish man seemed to be the leader, he started to talk about how Tareq, that was the head of the gang, should have known better about moving into business in London. The blond interrupted him, like he was…possessed. He grabbed Tareq around the throat and strapped him to the table. He was yelling at him, accusing him of all sorts of things,” there was a sniffle, ‘then he started cutting.”
Thanks everyone for all the lovely reviews I've still been getting.
“Don’t move,” Lestrade orders and slips back under. Affixing a bond to a family name usually requires the head of the household and a ceremony, but Lestrade can force it if he pushes enough power into it.
“Sir,” Hamish said, taking hold of the hand at his buttons.
The morgue is cold. This is a stupid deduction, no, a stupid observation, but still the thought runs through Sherlock’s head. He’s shivering, though his coat is curled tightly around him. When the door opens, he shoves his hands in his pockets, he doesn’t want Lestrade to see them shaking.
Sherlock decides to ignore him, focusing instead on his sample, but he can’t quite hide his pleased smile.
Lestrade sighs, “This will come back to bite me.” He looks over to find Sherlock ignoring him, kneeling over the circle with a fist full of evidence bags. He touches his pocket and finds his own bags missing. “Did you pick my pocket?”
Tianlong dips her head toward them, whiskers curling along the bridge. “Thank you,” she says, and around them the garden blooms in a riots of glowing blossoms.
Bill shook his head, “You pulled my ass outta more scrapes than I can count. You will always be my Captain, but I’d be honored to call you John. Now, enough of this, we have a posh git in a long coat to find and a mad man with semtex to avoid.” He stood, clapping his hands like he was wiping them of the whole thing.
Lestrade sends a series of text messages to Sherlock to make sure he is alright, but the idiot detective isn’t responding and he is not at Baker Street. He does receive a message from an unknown number that say “If brother has green ladder, arrest brother.” The text makes zero sense, but its exactly the sort of thing Sherlock would send. Sure enough, the woman does have an older brother that, for whatever reason, owns a green ladder.
John almost jumps out of his skin, “You’re awake,” he states rather stupidly.
Colonel’s brow shoots up. “Angel links aren’t usually that strong. Why weren’t you here with him then?”
“You don’t really seem the sort, I haven’t heard an accent that posh since I left London,” John grins, he looks interested, no signs of anger.
Mycroft follows after him, shoes stick in the mud, making every step a challenge, but Balor is much too close.
“Come on then,” he murmurs, lifting Mycroft with an arm around his side. Mycroft blinks slowly, staring at John with a confused tilt. “I’ve got you,” John reassures, taking his weight.
There are three men on the other side of the room, all dressed in ridiculous yellow leotards. Magically, they are all of average strength, but Lestrade is worried about the weapons, two with swords and the one with spears.
John can’t back up in the small room and can only take the blows. He protects his face with upraised arms. An opening lets him block a wide haymaker with his left before raining punches to Moran’s side.
When Q hands it to Mycroft, he turns it curiously in his hands. A closer look shows the metal is etched with chemical equations. “This is an alchemist’s.”
Hamish nodded, even though it wasn’t a question. Moriarty was looking him up and down, a deductive gaze he was very familiar with. He knew the man would notice the tell tale callous on his thumb webbing from firing high-powered rifles.  Military was written in his face, hands, and posture, even if his hair now grew in a shaggy blond mop.
I had trouble with this because I'm trying to decide how Sherlock and John should react around each other. I still feel its a bit stiff, but I got passed the part that was really bugging me. The next chapter involves the woman, but in a different way from the show. I've been looking forward to introducing her for awhile.
They practically flee out of the building, and John knows that rank is the only thing keeping the poor Corporal from asking anymore questions. Luckily, they manage to get into the jeep and off the premises before any serious questions can be asked.
At Baker Street, Mrs. Hudson brought them tea and biscuits while Sherlock pulled eight laptops of varying design out of every corner of the flat.
“Libyans, honestly?” Hamish raised a sarcastic brow.
Mycroft tries to scream, but only manages a gutteral noise, eyes squeezing shut against the pain.
“I’ll know when it happens,” John shrugged.
The others are bored, much like John himself. He sighs, swinging his legs over the perch for a better seat. There’s no class today, their teacher off doing who knows what, though they had been told that Agent Smith would be dropping by. John briefly considers convincing the dour-faced man to take them to the range, but Agent Smith could only be visiting for one reason, Introduction.
Feeling lighter than he has in years, John tugs the rings from around his neck. He opens the chain and offers his ring to Sherlock. “Perhaps we can try this again, if you’ll let me.”
Mycroft moved through the twisting halls of the biggest hospital in London. In a very secluded area on the fourth floor, there was a section labeled Storage. It was in fact, the location of MI5’s personal doctors.
John opens his mouth to argue, but suddenly he can’t breath. Pain shoots through him, lungs constricting. He gasps, clawing at his chest.
“I told you, I’m a detective.”
The Compound is empty. Dust has settled on every surface, and the air has gone stale. John drops his duffel to the ground with a thump, sending up a cloud of dirt. The door closes behind him with a screech, and he is alone.
“A Mythos created when an animal is possessed by a demon that feeds on anger. Once the Ilimu consumes enough human flesh, it is capable of shifting its shape at will. The more powerful of them are capable of transforming into any creature they consume. The Ilimu we saw was only just beginning its transformation.”
For a week he plays the violin and does small experiments in Greg’s kitchen. He watches as Greg and Mycroft continue to dance around each other, until Mycroft manages to secure a very minor government job.
The heart monitor jumped when he made the incision. It was deep, 8 inches just below the ribs on the right side.
The person that steps forward is just a kid, maybe twelve, but looks can be deceiving. His face is pale and narrow, made even sharper by his prominent cheekbones. With his dark hair in a riot of curls and the strange shimmer to his eyes, he certainly looks like something that might step from a summoner’s circle.
Sherlock is dressed in an old, blue dressing gown with safety goggles over his eyes and a propane torch in his hand. His hair is a riot of curls and he looks exactly like the telly version of a mad scientist escaped from the mental ward.
Lestrade waves her off, “Don’t be ridiculous, keep it.”
They return to the precinct to study the files on the previous victims. They hole up in their shared office, laying out page after page of reports. “Bugger, this is a lot,” Lestrade scowls, finally reaching the bottom of one of the case files.
“Careful there Sherlock, do you know who that’s from?” Greg asks, looking nervously over his shoulder.
“Strange fellow,” Lestrade comments, completely ignoring Sherlock. “So you guys already finished that private case with the sisters?” He asks John.
Jim was waiting for him in the kitchen. “You didn’t sleep with her.”
Sally, who has an almost irrational hatred for the man, claims that Sherlock is such a narcissistic sociopath that he bonded with himself, but Lestrade knows thats crap. He can still see the golden bond like a steel cable, at least until the day it goes black.
The Bethesda Terrace is mostly deserted. The ground is littered with snow and the wind off the water is biting. Four cherubs are skiing lazily around the fountain, unbothered by the cold.
He sighs, watching the water grow darker with each swirl of the tea bag. Greg had never broached the topic of soulmates with Sherlock. Its a private affair at the best of times and Sherlock is as guarded as his brother, and in some ways more so. He certainly hadn’t realized that Sherlock had bonded, and judging by the argument between the two men it had been some time ago.
Its probably the best kiss Sherlock has ever had. Its startling, because for some reason Sherlock had never put bond mate and kissing in the same thought process, he was always thinking about his wings, but now - oh the experiments!
“John.”
Sherlock crawls all over the scene in his usual manner, picking up bits of trash and debris that no one thought to investigate. “He knows each victim, it’s obviously jealousy over his lack of bond, but why these individuals, what made him choose them? Hmm.”
This is the end of this story for now. Sequel is a def maybe, however.
John is standing in front of the kettle, the old thing makes soft clicking noises as it heats up. He is staring at the two tea cups in front of him, but Sherlock knows his mind is miles away.
Sherlock whips around, only to see Bruiser now sprawled on the ground. There is another boy above him. He is smaller and younger than Bruiser, but older than Sherlock, probably around sixteen. Whatever his age, he has broken Bruiser’s nose. The older boy looks stunned, looking up with wide eyes.
Irene watched him, searching his face for some clue of his intentions. “Alright,” she purred.
Mycroft and John shoot each other mirror looks of confusion.
“No, Dr. Watson’s skills lie elsewhere,” Mycroft chuckles, and Lestrade is inexorably pleased to have made the man laugh. “I can trust you then, Detective, to keep an eye on them,” Mycroft steps around his desk and offers his hand to Lestrade.
John flushes, embarrassed, but unsure why.
“I never saw him, Moriarty brought him on day one, I would recognize that man’s voice anywhere. The other I didn’t know from any of our files. He sounded young, very young. Moriarty asked him to get information from me and he just sneered at the things they had laid out, saying it wouldn’t work. He listed off a series of medical equipment. He clearly knew what he was talking about. He came back the next day, hooked up what I assume was an IV line and a catheter. He injected a local, washed his hands and started cutting. He hardly spoke, just hummed and sang like a psycho while he worked. “
He keeps an eye out for drug use, because Sherlock is always balancing between manic and sulk, but other than repeated failed attempts at quitting smoking, he seems clean. What is strange is that in the three years since he started working with the man, he has never met his bondmate.
John watches as Moriarty’s hazel eye goes dim, glazed over in a film of white. He jerks again, body convulsing as he seizes. His mouth moves, but no noise comes out. When he falls to the ground, dead, he still has the look of surprise paralyzed on his face.
John’s shoulders shift as he comes back into himself. “No, it really isn’t.”
Sherlock glares at him, tempted to throw a stinging spell if the man wasn’t driving the car. Lestrade doesn’t look at him, instead fixing his eyes on the road, jaw clenching. Sherlock decides to let it go, for now.
“Two more weeks for what?”
“ ‘Lo, John, Helios,” Jones greeted.
Sherlock grins, pleased to show off. “When I approached she pulled a talisman from her belt, carved ironwood imbued with a repellent charm. The MET supplies standard enchantments, but ironwood isn’t one of them.” He gestures at Lestrade’s belt, “She had a full stock of enchantments, but you are only wearing one. That’s an obsidian bullet, hand carved, and enchanted for protection. She thinks quiet highly of you Detective, obsidian can only be enchanted by a class 7 or higher, but the protective ward used on it is class 8. She would use the most powerful protection spell she knows for her partner, thus class 8.”
“Well I’ll be, Captain, looks like everything worked out perfectly,” Bill slung a one-arm hug around John and gave him a tight squeeze.
“Are you actually going to give it to your brother?” John asked, giving Sherlock a dubious look.
He spends the hour attempting to read a treatise on fae bonds, but is too wired to give it any proper attention. When the timer finally goes off, he pounces on it. The solution has now taken on a color reminiscent of muddy grass.
Two weeks. It isn’t that long. Not in the scheme of things, but the passing of time drags into eternity. John spends his days working with Smith, learning new spell craft and helping with paperwork. He spends afternoons with James, sneaking out of the barracks for flights in the subway.
Sherlock may have forgotten the incident with John entirely, he had already started to clean out the office he made for the boy in his mind palace. However, after a week, a large envelope is left at Greg’s doorstep with Sherlock’s name on it.
John can feel the tension of the situation building in his chest. He wants his arms free and he wants desperately to get off the ground, but he doesn’t want to be taken away and beaten for answers like the others. It selfish, but true and the fear keeps him awake at night, when he should be grabbing a few hours of sleep like the others.
“You are,” Murray grins, tossing him the car keys. “Come on, you can drive.”
“Bluebell is the only live mammal I’m currently working with, but she will work just fine for this,” Stapleton says, going over to the wire cage. She carefully holds the rabbit down and injects the venom into the thick fur at the base of her neck. “It will take time for that to work through her system and produce the antibodies. For now I think I have a solution for your arm. It’s just the ulna that is broken correct?”she asks, turning to John.
Finally, sleep came, and the nightmares stayed away.
On the night that changed John’s life, he was tucked in bed with a flashlight he had nicked from his older sister. He and his daemon, Helios, were flipping through the book. His parents and sis were in the living room laughing over some sitcom. John was supposed to be sleeping, because he was little.
“Nor do I,” Mycroft grimaces, his gift is running rampant with the possibilities, and no matter how hard he tries, he can find no way of making it through without a fight. “Stay close,” he says, and steps into the fog.
“Mr. Holmes?”
The Sky Will Fall Down
The shouting goes back and forth the same phrases constantly repeating until the unknown man hits Don’s temple with the butt of his rifle just to get him to shut up.
There was a sharp scream from his mum, a cry from Harry, and his da was screaming, begging someone to “Please, God No!”
“Thank you, that will be perfect,” Mycroft agrees.
“Oh,” Lestrade tosses her the keys, “so I was right on time then.”
“I still don’t see how a country like America hasn’t banned it yet,” Sherlock comments.
Hamish fiddled with the IV connector as he hooked up the saline to Carson.
“Harry, what did they do to me?” John swallows back tears as he points to his leg. His left knee looks fine, but beneath that is a network of silver metal merged with skin. It looks like something from a sci-fi show.
“I’ve never been attracted to anyone, this should be interesting,” Sherlock muttered.
The Sculptor’s Guild is in Shoreditch, nestled in a renovated theater house. There’s no real sign, just the emblem of the crossed hammer and chisel that has represented the Sculptors for millennia.
“Something Charles Knight, it’s important,” John says, but his eyes are starting to look glazed and Lestrade isn’t sure if he knows what he is saying. Still, as he leaves the room he decides it wouldn’t hurt to give Henry a call.
Baskerville is not like any military base John has ever been too. It has a gated entrance and lots of soldiers standing guard with M-16s, but those are the only similarities John sees. Baskerville is actually quite small for a base, just a few cobbled together buildings that look more like an industrial park. Also, every soldier there seems to be on high alert, a mentality that is usually only reserved for warzones.
The first time Sherlock met ‘Gregory’ was during a spectacular OD. He had injected a speedball; a liquid concoction of heroin and cocaine. It made his heart slow and the lights in his apartment were suddenly very bright indeed.
“What are you doing?” Carson growled, his pulse had increased, but the 100 the heart beat monitor was reading was impressive.
“Where are we going to get that then?” John asks.
CHU: Combat Housing Unit (They are actually single-wide trailers split into three separate units and shared between two people)
“Almost perfect,” he purred and shifted. Hyperion used the picture to guide his shape, stretching out his body to the long, sleek design of the dragon. He stayed about a meter long from tip to tail. Each inch was covered with black scales like ebony. His eyes were bright green and cat-like. Forcing the wings out of his back was difficult, his body did not want to have six limbs and his muscles protested the unusual shape. Hyperion added a few extra sets of horns along his jaw to go with the larger set Sherlock had drawn on the dragon’s head. They elongated his head and made him look fierce. With a final tweak of his body, Hyperion let out a small wisp of blue flame.
The scene
“Probably another homeless kid with a bit of the gift hoping to summon a demon for some help,” Dimmock comments, “But you know, not my division.”
At the sounding of the bell, John moves forward lightening fast. He jabs straight to the man’s face, then torso, before knocking him out with a bone shattering haymaker to the temple.
John narrows his eyes at his mate, giving him a suspicious look as he probes the bond. “Aha, Molly’s autopsy,” he grins.
It’s not his first time seeing someone with a lost limb. By the time the kids had been rescued from the desert, two had lost limbs to the bombs littering the roadsides, but it never makes it easier.
John rolls his eyes, but his shoulders relax minutely. “Did you know I’ve been at the compound since I was 6? That’s what we called the underground base in London, The Compound.”
“Yeah kiddo,” the constable grins, “I am.”
“Well then you take some time out of your
The thugs run off like they are being chased.
John picked through the bins behind an Italian restaurant off Northumberland Street. The owner always made sure to wrap the day old breadsticks in a plastic bag for the homeless. John fished out one of the bags, leaving the other for whoever came behind him. John fished a hunk of slightly moldy cheese and a barely bruised apple out of another bin a few streets over.
They head out just as the sun is starting to set. The sky lights in a riot of colors, beautiful even with the cloud of smog hanging thick over the city. Mycroft leads the way through a series of high-rise apartments that give way to an oasis.
He takes them to a room that has to be the infirmary. Small beds line the wall, most hidden by white curtains. The air is filled with the lingering scent of bleach and gauze, the universal hospital odor.
“It is rare that the Agents are sent out in teams, a strong working relationship with a demon servant can mean the difference between life or death,” Agent Smith answers.
“It isn’t a guarantee you know. Just because two people are born with the same...trinket when they are born doesn’t guarantee eternal happiness.  Honestly, we hardly know each other and I’m a mess, seriously. This leg, my scars, I have nightmares that leave me screaming. Why would you want that? Why would anyone?” John could feel his heart clench, he did not want to be saying these things. There was a reason why he had only managed to talk to a therapist once, but he figured if anyone deserved the truth it would be the person that was supposed to be his other half, guarantee or not.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well then,” Smith says, looking surprised, but pleased. “Welcome to MI6 Mr. Holmes.”
Hamish stared at the man, trying to determine what he wanted. This was getting ridiculous. “You told me this morning you couldn’t read minds, well neither can I. What is it you are trying to accomplish?”
With a shiver, John sends most of the towels fluttering off the bed, whoops. “But we can stop it can’t we? They aren’t released yet.”
Eddie Van Coon lives in a highrise in an expensive part of town. According to Donovan, the man is some sort of international banker, specializing in asian markets. Lestrade doesn’t bother waiting for backup, there isn’t time. He forces the door with a not-so-legal lock picking charm, and shoots up the stairs, Sherlock on his heels.
John is perched on the opposite bed. His hair is in even more of a disarray than usual and he has brought his wings back. He spreads them out across the bed and tossing every available towel over the water-logged feathers. He fusses over his coverlets, grumbling under his breath as he tries to stop them from curling as they dry.
Mycroft watches as John’s face shifts into a confused mix of hope and devastation. Silence reigns across the garden as they digest the information. It is the sort of silence that he loathes to break, but they have a mission. “Do you know anything about the Guardians that have gone missing or the creatures that may be causing it?”
“Don’t apologize,” John grips his shoulders tighter and uses them to give a little shake. “Are you alright?” John can actually feel the rapid beat of his heart beneath his hands.
Carson gave a wry chuckle, “My wife will be thrilled I’m sure. Thank you, sir.”
Sherlock sniffs out the entrance to the research lab with his usual bloodhound precision. Of course, Greg is sure that even he could have found the door labeled ‘Research Lab’.
He pulls into the driveway, and the moment he leaves the car, three crows land on the roof, cawing angrily at him like the car had always belonged to them and he is trespassing. He rolls his eyes at them, unimpressed by the ruckus, and heads for the door.
“Alright, alright, take that one,” Lestrade interrupts before Sherlock ruins his own element of surprise. The man in question is already shooting his sword a curious look.
He pulls out the most common scalpel, an inch long with a slightly curved blade. The man on the table might be screaming, but Hamish isn’t paying much attention. He puts his favored weapon to the side so he can cut the man’s clothing off with a pair of medical shears.
The temple is sweltering. It is almost February and Mycroft feels ready to melt out of his clothes. This time of the year in London would be cold and rainy, but here he is in India contemplating jumping into the nearest body of water.
“Masochists, they derived pleasure from pain, usually sexual in nature, but not necessarily. They weren’t being tortured. The nylon rope gave it away, but the hormone levels confirmed it. Combined with the magic drain, you are looking for a succubus or an incubus. I would suggest looking into their internet history, focus on interests in BDSM sites.”
“No, I suppose it doesn’t. I just can’t let you go on, I just can’t. So sorry,” the spider snapped his fingers and John heard the report of a sniper rifle.
“Sorry, sir,” She mutters and goes off to gather evidence.
John would eventually be accepted into St. Bart’s after applying to 5 different Med schools and one memorable interview with the Dean of the school. And when John couldn’t afford school anymore, he joined the Army and had them pay for it, because he was strong and brave and nothing was going to stand in his way.
Sherlock looked as calm as ever, “Well, it hardly matters now.”
“That’s amazing,” he grins.
As he expected, the man has a trail of tattoos on his arms that marks every young body he tore apart. Hamish clapped his hand over the man’s mouth and squeezed, feeling the bones beneath his grip. “Do you remember them? At night when you don’t have to face yourself in the mirror, do you remember all the little children you ruin?” He’s snarling at the man, drawing his blade along the right arm.
Lestrade sighs, running his hand through his sleep mussed hair. “I can’t, you know I can’t, and I think,” he straightens his shoulders, fully engaged now, “I think it is time for you to go home.”
Sherlock disappeared into a cab, heading for Baker Street.
Chapter Six: Somebody Loves You
“Thank you, Doctor. May I speak with the patient?”
Lestrade takes a deep breath of the freshly brewing coffee, it’s rather soothing. “And it didn’t cross your mind to just ask?”
She gives him a sharp look, up and down, her brow quirks doubtfully.
The problem was not with Mrs. Hudson or the corrupted bond. It had taken when attached to the Holmes family. The problem must be on his end. The problem must be him.
“Of course he did, the Freak knows his own,” Sally commented, coming over with Anderson.
Sally notices his hesitation, and presses a collection of talismans to his hand. Ward dampeners would not have worked against such a thing, but Sally, clever as always, had handed him a collection of power restrictors. With his magicks reduced to human levels, the wards let him in without pause.
“No,” Sherlock snarls, “They closed the case?”
“He’s in the barracks.”
He throws on the clothes, and falls into the bathroom. His hair has a stray bit sticking up in the back, he tries to force it down with some water, but it just springs back up. He sighs and gives his reflection a scowl, his hair seems to grow more silver with each passing day.
John laughs looking up at the shield swirling around them. “You’re mad.”
There are pigeons all over the walkway, skittering this way and that for the choicest pieces of bread. Two get into a scuffle over a large piece of crust, snapping irritably at each other like New York drivers.
“Oh,” Mycroft breathes, as if he hasn’t just been struck by lightening.
“Take a seat,” John offers, gesturing to his own chair.
Seb drops his hold, before slugging Sherlock across the face. His fist is like a battering ram, the blunt force rattles Sherlock’s brain in his skull. His jaw aches and a careful probing of his tongue reveals a loosened molar. “I’m guessing he isn’t happy?” Sherlock quips, giving Seb a bloody smirk, because he never did know when to shut his mouth.
When Agent Carson disappeared, they had no doubt who had him, but Moriarty’s usual torturer was Sebastian Moran. The man had been dishonorably discharged from the Army and had quickly been scooped up by the mad man, but Moran’s disemboweled corpse had been found over a month ago.
It was then that Sherlock saw it. A level 4 bond mark in dark blue with the interlocking symbols for justice and knowledge.
“Holmes.”
“Let me get your change, it’ll only take a tic.”
Thankfully, the room on the right was not shared by Moriarty and was nicely sized. He spent a week trying to stop tensing his shoulders every time he entered the building. There were no dangerous meetings or assassinations. In fact, the only time he saw Moriarty that week was when the man dragged him along to a suit fitting. Hamish was now the owner of his very own Westwood.
That is all it says. He flips the paper over, somehow expecting more of an explanation, but the back of the paper is blank. He flips the paper back over to stare at the sigil and feels a spike of unease.
“I can assume we know each other then,” Mycroft commented, gesturing for Moran to sit, like they were in his house.
Hamish turns to the men, trying to cage the
“Everyone hides something, after all, John probably wouldn’t appreciate you sneaking cigarettes when you are supposed to be quitting. “ He tipped his head to them both, lifting an imaginary hat in mock salute. “Thanks for the offer of tea, John, but I best be off.” He hurried down the steps, needing to get out of the flat, before he did anything more idiotic.
Moriarty shot him a grin that was more a showing of teeth and flittered off.
John could probably take them, but he’s looking at the shopping like he desperately doesn’t want to put it down on the filthy alleyway. Which probably means one of the bags contains milk and tea. Hamish resists the urge to laugh.
“Why would Moriarty want to be in jail?” John asks.
“They...She was torn apart,” Henry whispers, voice so very small. His fingers spasm as he slowly lifts the frayed edges of his right sleeve.
“Oh, trust me, whatever Sebastian is up too, playing isn’t it.”
“What’s wrong?” He asks again.
John tries to lean away from him, Mycroft is still injured, he shouldn’t be attempting this kind of healing, but as per usual, the seer ignores him. He places the crystal over the wound in his shoulder and then presses down with his thumb.
DI Lestrade was thirty-five when he first met Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock rubs his hands together and gives one of his wide smiles that makes him look some how younger and completely insane. “I need a lab.”
“Has the morning sickness been bad?” John asks, he remembers Anne being a petite redhead with a galaxy of freckles across her nose.
“Yes, he said you would understand,” Sherlock looked hesitant, obviously reading the sudden change in his older sibling.
John stumbles forward and slips into one of the large metal cages, the rounded bars bite into his knees as he falls through the entrance, but he ignores it in favor of slamming the door closed behind him and  latching it shut. The beast is an instant behind, slamming against the bars and snarling so viciously, gobs of saliva hang from its slavering jaws, splattering the cage floor. It tries to reach between the bars, but it’s paws are too large and only screech uselessly against the metal.
Ruiz steps up beside Gabriel, their shields blending into one copper streaked wall.
“Popcorn? Really?”
He’s shaking to his core, can’t keep completely still, but he tries. John watches as Mycroft digs into John’s own pack and pulls out the bag of stones. He dumps them on the ground, the crystals are dead, all used up. It’s useless, he thinks, but then Mycroft raises his hand. Pinched between two fingers is the smallest sliver of a stone, still glinting with magic.
Feeling exposed, John tugged into his jumper.
“You’re upset about this too. I know you are.”
When he did get it, hopefully without setting any silent alarms he had missed. Hamish made tea.
Lestrade stays true to his word, walking him right onto the train and waiting on the platform until it speeds off. The ride is intolerable, surrounded by loud families traveling for the holidays. The Christmas music piped through the speakers scrapes across his skull. To keep sane, he closes his eyes and breathes deeply. He can’t concentrate, the cacophony keeping him from the sanctuary of his mind palace.
“PTSD, shit, he wouldn’t be the first, but will it affect Sherlock? Their connection is the deepest I’ve ever seen.” Greg has read his fair share of PTSD studies, of high level bondmates both being affected by mental illness.
The pain is like nothing John has ever felt before, and for some reason all he can think of is the night Helios settled, the night when she became something unheard of to save him, and now when she needs him he can’t fucking move!
One more note, from a comment I got on Tumblr. I know in the story that it was mentioned that all angels have blond hair and blue eyes, the original purpose for this was a plot point that I ended up dropping further in the writing process, but the commenter was upset by the prospect that this made all angels white, and I want to assure everyone that that is not the case. In fact, Uriel, one of the angels introduced with John, has more Egyptian coloring. Which, going back to read what I wrote, was never mentioned, so that is completely my fault, but I wanted to assure everyone that angels in this story come in all shapes, sizes, and colors. Thank you.
Holmesless (Part 3)
Pulling back into reality hurts, pain lancing through his temple in a backlash. He has to scrunch his eyes closed, tears leaking out in a trail down his cheeks.
“Hello Bethesda,” Mycroft greets, calling up to the statue at the top of the fountain.
“I was quite young. Very silly, really,” Mrs. Hudson flushes.
Sherlock still isn’t certain how Mycroft managed to secure a job that usually requires at least a bachelor's when the man still hasn’t graduated secondary school, but if anyone could do it, Mycroft could. The new job and paycheck seems to settle some of the unease between the bonded. They still dance around each other, but now they seem to dance a little closer.
He sang, cleaning away the blood with his suction tube.
She tuts again, “Oh child, I know, but he is important is he not?”
“Hmm, where was he when he was shot?” Sherlock asks.
“No, sir. They are calling in help from some of the detachments, there is just a bunch of clean up and moving to do, Colonel wants you to report at 0800 tomorrow,” Murray answers.
Mycroft’s arranged meeting place is an old apartment building, long since condemned. Sherlock shimmies in through a couple of loose boards over a broken window. The place smells of mold and mildew, but under that is the greasy scent of noodles.
Lestrade holds up his phone, bright with a new message. “We have to wait, have to find new evidence, but until then there are more murders to solve.”
“No, Mrs. Hudson met her husband after the death of her mate. She is one of the few that lost her mate between receiving her vision and first touch,” Sherlock spoke softly. John could feel his sadness, Sherlock was remembering John’s gunshot wound and the very real chance of them never meeting.
Sherlock watched him, reading as much about the man as he could from the callouses on his fingers to the way he held himself. It was uncomfortable, being in the tiny room with no idea what to talk about, so, as usual, Sherlock broke the silence with the first thing that popped into his head. “You know, in older times we would have celebrated the bonding by taking first flight,” he mutters.
“It’s July, genius,” Greg says, swatting him playfully on the shoulder.
John knows he should call Mycroft, that he should wait for backup, but he hears a muffled scream beyond the door and feels an acho of pain. Enough is enough. He sends off a text to big brother, because he hasn’t completely lost it, then he opens the door.
The answer is surprisingly simple, once Sherlock sees the careful way the boy holds his left arm, protecting his shoulder. Oh!
The soldier leads them to a small building surrounded by thick concrete barriers. John takes them in curiously, they are covered in strange paintings, some are protective wards, but most of them appear to be unit mascots. There is something cheery about the chipping paint surrounded by such drab greyness.
“No, you’re right.” He gives her a small smile, “like always.”
“Nice to meet you John. Could you get Helios to change into something a little smaller, and I can carry you out of here. Would you like that?”
Lestrade narrows his gaze, switching over to the corporeal plane. On the other side, Mrs. Hudson has an aura of white and grey swirling behind her like a cloak. It should be an unnerving color, but only feels that same sense of familiarity and calm. He pulls back into reality with a gasp, “You’re a banshee.” Of course Sherlock’s nanny would be a harbinger of death.
“Greg, please,” he grins, standing and shaking John’s hand. “Lord knows this git is convinced I only have a last name,” Greg quirks his thumb and Sherlock,” but I promise I have a first name too.”
Stalagmites litter the floor, rising up like spears. Something dark and smelling like rot, oozes between the pillars. John inches around the edge of the cave, keeping his shield out in front of him.
“We will do no such thing. My parents are well aware of my location.”
The next morning, Doc fusses over them some more, but declares that their magicks have been restored. John feels refreshed and can feel the comforting strength of Mycroft’s power returned to him, one of the benefits of enjoying a godling’s hospitality.
John’s wings glow golden, the holy energy pouring off him in waves, gathering in his weapons. The instant the shield cracks, the smallest sliver between the waves, he fires.
“I would have shot three if I had a clear view of Moriarty,” John shrugged. It was a one-shoulder shrug, stiff from his bullet wound.
Sherlock shot him a look, clearly sensing his mood. “I think it is best for John and I to return home.”
“You’ve got quite the protective streak, I see,” he teased.
As he’s walking he hears the tell-tale screech of the incoming siren, but ignores it. The hospital is under a steel blast roof and surrounded by concrete barricades, there is very little a cold-war era RPG is going to do. The woman’s robotic voice over the intercom is so grating, the sharp crackle of “Incoming! Incoming!”
“That? A bomb, what does that mean?”
There is a shout, a language he doesn’t recognize, before a spell barrels through the car. Verdant spellcraft knocks into the ceiling before jamming straight down, shoving the monster into the floor and the flames. The fire flares back to life, licking across the tiger’s protection. It must find a chink in the armor because the beast howls, roaring in rage and pain.
The rooms are cold, a chill like a morgue fills the lower levels, fog drifting across the floor. There are ancient lanterns along the walls and as he draws closer they flare to life with a warm golden light like the flow of honey. He follows the light, going deep into the palace. The scent shifts to fresh brewed tea and gun oil. The tattered wallpaper turns black with white flourishes, a yellow smiley face greets him in the amber light.
“Singaporean Magi have perfected the art of merging magic and technology,” Mycroft comments.
With the room empty, Sherlock sits on the bed. He lingers there for awhile, debating, before laying beside John. He doesn’t slip under the covers. The bed smells of stale sweat and sickness, but he curls against John’s warm form, and finally lets himself relax.
Sherlock looks around, taking in the scent of newly laid wax on the floors and bleach from the newly cleaned bathroom. He curled up his lip in disgust.
Instead, John follows Mycroft’s gaze to where it has fixed on Smith’s second shadow. Perhaps sensing his concentration, the shadow changes form. It’s hair turns into a spiky mess, framing long, pointed ears. Two eyes, formed simply by an absence of shadow, peer up at him. The mouth that forms from the darkness is all angles and sharp teeth. The shadow moves on its own, waving cheekily at him before settling back into shape.
She was sitting in her boudoir, rubbing rose scented lotion along her arms. Her right wrist had a swirl of markings looping around it in orange and peach, it would have been beautiful if not for the redness around the edges like a mosquito bite.
Heat and light pulsed into the room. The man was screaming and the room smelled like that time his mum had overheated her hairdryer. John saw a flash of gold dust, and then darkness.
“Or face a fate far worse than death,” they finish as one. With a howl that scrapes across the senses, the creature is gone in a curl of dark smoke.
Moriarty scoffed, “Oh don’t be boring, I mean I’m going to kill you anyways. But first, I will burn you. I will burn the heart out of you.”
“Not time! You had your Vision, the universe is telling you its time!” Bill was shaking, furious.
“Alright, alright,” Lestrade holds up his hands, “maybe they just wanted a cuppa.” He leans closer to get a look at the goo on one of the shelves because no matter how much he doesn’t want to, it is part of his job. The stuff smells like manure with the consistency of snot. “Oh, that’s rank,” he snorts, rearing back and rubbing his offended nose. “Well most of that list makes sense, goblins are just another member of the fae, but what’s with the salt? Fae hate salt.”

“Perhaps, if you ignore everything else about him.” He kneels down, coat tails flaring out to avoid the muck, and grabs the victim’s hand despite protests. “See the callouses here, and the staining. He’s been doing ink work with a quill. Rather old fashioned, unless you are studying summoning and learning advanced circles.”
Hamish laughed, smoothing away the tenseness of the previous argument. “I have missed you, father.”
He heads down the main hall to where the floor dips into the officer offices. He shouldn’t actually have an office down here as a Lieutenant, but Lestrade gave up his space in an effort to keep Sherlock from bugging someone with less patience.
The guards at the gate give Sherlock dirty looks, clearly having been informed about the earlier security breach, but they wave them through all the same. John has to wonder what Mycroft’s people told them about this mess.
The beast dodges out of the way, moving swiftly for such a large thing. John has to leap to the side, barely avoiding the snapping jaws as the hound slams into the wall where John had only moments before been leaning.
John flinches, surprised to find Smith standing in the doorway. His suit jacket is missing, tie loosened, but looks remarkably put together for a man that just fought a...whatever the hell that was. “Thank you,” John nods. He moves back to Mycroft’s side, shoving the stones back into his pocket as he goes.
“Support his head,” Mummy said as she handed him over.
His phone beeped in his pocket. “Hey,” Lestrade greeted, clicking the answer button.
“Sherlock!” John shouts in the distance.
“I occupy a minor position in the British government,” is his answer.
Sherlock snarls, barely shifting, so he’s still taking up a majority of the room. “What would be the point? I can’t
“Why can’t we just scry him? Isn’t that how they realized the Boston spirit was missing?” John asks.
“Sherlock,” Greg sighs. He sinks down to sit beside his sprawled form. “Is this about University?” he asks, ruffling the teen’s wild curls.
“For what?”
Anyways, let me get off my soap box and thank everyone for all the fantastic reviews I've been getting. You are all awesome, I hope you enjoy this one.
“Why would Sebastian Moran being telling you this, and what could he have done to ensure such loyalty from you?” Sherlock was grinning; it was like ‘A Study in Pink’ all over again.
Dr. Hart was in his office, a series of x-rays clipped to the backlights. “Mr. Holmes, I didn’t expect you to come in person.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Back at the house, Moriarty took the lead, dragging him into the master bathroom. The Master bathroom contained a tub that could fit four people and a rain shower capable of supporting a small conga line.
John gives it a wide berth.
Seb releases his grip and sits back with a pleased smile. “Oh good. Now,” he says, wagging his knife in Sherlock’s direction. “I need you to call your dear Captain to you.”
Mycroft resisted the urge to sigh. Sherlock had not had a case in two weeks. “I did not bring you a case brother, in fact I brought you some information I think you will find most enlightening.” He placed a plain, manila folder on the table between them, before gathering his cup of tea. For a man with only bagged tea and a biohazard of a kitchen, John made an excellent brew.
PCS: Personal Combat System (The British version of the ACU)
“There is nothing wrong with you except for your inconsideration with your own health,” Lestrade says, the bite to his words softened with affection.
Sherlock heads straight for the staging area, the back rooms filled with colourful costumes and props. Lestrade can feel magic all around, but that is hardly unusual for these sorts of shows. The room Sherlock stops at, however, is guarded with a powerful locking spell. “Careful,” Lestrade cautions, pulling Sherlock back before he can do something stupid.
John gets out of bed, the stone floor is cold on his bare feet. He glances at Mycroft’s bed but can only see a lump of covers and a glimpse of his hair, unruly curls broken free of their usual gelled confines.
The Libyans were in the kitchen; apparently the goons had interrupted a game of cards.
Moriarty is sprawled out on the cot, looking bored as he flips lazily through what looks like a bridal magazine? He clearly wasn’t told to expect a visitor because he barely spares John a glance at first.
John deflates, wings dipping to drag along the ground. “Yeah, okay,” he admits. “Where are we going?”
Chapter One: Call me Sebastian
Carson was slim, so there was little fat to move aside, only the red gleam of muscle with a few yellow nodules.
“This castle is home to great deal of sprites and spirits, they are generally benign, but I would be careful all the same,” Agent Smith warns. He gestures for them to follow, and he takes them on a twisting route through the castle. The first floor is beautifully decorated, all rich tapestries and gleaming oak. It’s like nothing John has ever seen.
Shoving away the dark rage in his chest, Hamish decided to better prove his worth. He slipped easily from the grounds, avoiding the frenzied guards.
She shakes her head, gaze softening, “No don’t look at me like that. I’m sorry, really, it was just a surprise. I’ve never seen them before. Your wings are beautiful, truly.” She bites her lip, a nervous gesture Lestrade hasn’t seen since they were both fresh out of the academy. “I forget sometimes. It’s so easy to sort you into the category of a sorcerer with an affinity for holy magic. I haven’t been...understanding about your Link. I’ll try.” She quirks a grin, “Though I still don’t like him.”
Hamish felt nothing as he removed the evidence of his kill; Moran had deserved it.
The next morning, they meet Navamas at the front of the hotel, her usual cheery disposition marred by a deep frown. “Good morning,” she greets, sounding weary.
“I think this calls for some fresh scones later, but just this once dear, I’m not your housekeeper.” Mrs. Hudson gave Sherlock another peck on the cheek before heading back down stairs.
“..ack...son”
“Next you’ll be asking me about the weather. Is there a purpose to this call other than inane pleasantries and false cheer?”
She gives hims a smile that warms his heart. If she weren’t a godling of hearth and healing, John suspects she could be very dangerous indeed.
“Tell me what happened,” Jim asked, running his fingers along the parallel cuts that marked his time in Syria.
I just added some new art of Young Mycroft and Mycroft's Pocketwatch done by the amazing Tartha. They definitely made my day, it was a wonderful surprise.
He was working through his laptop search when it happened. John’s mind was a continuous chatter of background noise, he had mostly learned to ignore it, but he would have to be dead not to realize how jealous Irene was making him. It was the chatter that made it so hard for him to notice that John had left the room. Since the man was actually embedded in his mind it was as if he was always there.
“You’re insane,” Carson cried, the edges of his blindfold were wet.
Sherlock narrows his eyes, focusing, but Lestrade makes as little sense now as he did at the crime scene. His aura is strange, obviously magical, but not consistent with any of the disciplines he’s familiar with, and Sherlock is familiar with all of them. At best guess his aura has the feel of a sorcerer, certainly elemental, but Sherlock doesn’t guess, so he holds off on that deduction for now.
They took a cab to a building beside the pool. John, being the better marksmen, went to the roof. Bill went to the pool to set up communications and hide in the girl’s locker room.
Charles and Erik are young kids that have been test subjects for years, but when the scientists make a mistake they manage to escape. In the process, they free a strange man with memory problems and a metal arm. What follows is an epic road trip that will lead to Bucky, Charles, and Erik learning what it is to be a family. And when aliens open a portal over New York, Bucky realizes Steve isn't as dead as he thought he was.
I also have started a few new stories, but I'm being good. I won't post them until I am done or almost done, so I don't mess you guys up with a two year wait again. If you are curious this is what I'm working on:
“Ah shite,” he curses shaking out his hand. “You stole my wallet!”
As the vehicle lumbers back to safety, John thinks of London, and he thinks of home.
“You took too long,” Sherlock shrugs, and steps over to get a closer look at Van Coon.
“I didn’t harass her, I merely asked her a question,” Sherlock scowls, looking offended. “I asked her if her husband was innocent - tan line on the left ring finger, obvious - and you know what she told me?” Sherlock grins, leaning forward.
“It…” She trails off as the emergency lights flicker. “That should not happen, the labs are on multiple generators.”
It was opened by an old woman, probably in her early seventies. Though John was surprised to see her giant river otter Daemon. He had once watched a documentary of that species chasing off a full grown alligator in defense of its pups.
“I’ve never had boiled aingil,” Balor taunts, turning to face them as he unwraps the last layer of cloth. The air hisses, water steaming.
John gently squeezes Sherlock’s arm, an offer of comfort as if he can still read his thoughts. Sherlock is not an optimistic person, the exact opposite in fact, but he looks down at John, one eye a vibrate blue and the other his own greyish-green. Sherlock turns his hand and intertwines their fingers, John has an interesting set of calluses that scratch along his smoother palm.
Greg brewed his fifth cup of tea in so many hours and stared at the closed bedroom door. Sherlock had locked himself away as soon as they had arrived and no amount of coaxing has managed to draw the teen from the room.
This chapter came out unexpectedly sad, sorry.
Sherlock rounded on the man, knocking the fake gun from his hand and bringing him to his knees with a well-placed kick.
He was reading the last entry when he heard the shattering burst of the front door being kicked in. Helios jerked up from his side, her Golden Retriever eyes wide.
“Stay down,” Bauza commands them, pushing John and Harry down so they are almost in the floor. He shifts over them, supporting his arm on the back seat so he can take aim at the oncoming cars.
Mrs. Hudson's brow furrows. “Well, yes, but that is a difficult bond to make, and you don’t have the head of the household here.”
It hurts to see that expression, the sudden realization that he isn’t human. Lestrade forgets, himself, sometimes, but he thought Sally had long adjusted to the fact.
“Shields up,” Smith commands, stepping up to the wall across from Gabriel. He bites out a harsh word of latin, shield crackling to life. Another gutteral sound, and the Nalusa Falaya disconnects, shooting down the cave.
Mycroft presses the top of the watch and it opens with a soft click. John leans over his shoulder, probably rudely, but he’s curious. The watch face is beautiful. Instead of numbers, the face was left blank so as not to obscure the interlocking gears that could be seen beneath. The watch hands are delicate silver arrows, vibrant against the gold and bronze inner workings.
“Hmm,” Lestrade sinks into the armchair, mug cradled in his hands.
“Hmm, it wasn’t murder, at least not intentionally,” Sherlock flicks off his gloves and tosses them in the bin, what a boring case. “The man was sitting in his CHU when the bullet took him through the side. Unluckily for him, the only one to hear him call for help was the man that shot him. In the building attached to him an officer was cleaning their service pistol. The idiot forgot to properly clear the chamber and shot the man next door. Q pod is known for being officer’s alley, most work day shift so no one heard what happened. The one who shot him left the area and went to work, hoping to avoid suspicion. It will be a high ranking American officer with a Masters or PHD, someone that was given a high-rank with very little military experience.”
“Oh, go on then,” he sighs.
Mycroft stumbles back, but he is already pressed against the wall.
Hyperion ignored him, shifting into a weasel as he jumped from the desk to the bed.  He snuggling against his pillow and set about ignoring his human.
He thought he knew pain before, but it was nothing like the injection. It burns brighter than any fire and its tearing him out from the inside, scrapping him open and leaving him hollow.
“John could…”
“Er Sorry, Bill Murray. You’re Sherlock Holmes, right?” He held out his hand.
Smith sighs, shoulders dropping. The room returns to a normal temperature as his shadow fades. “I know, John, but I’m not going to put you in training, not yet.”
Sherlock’s finger twitches over the trigger.
John looks startled by that and starts to push himself up. His arms are shaking and can hardly put any weight on his broken one, he seems to be moving by force of will alone.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Take Mycroft, I’ll get him.”
‘Gregory’ was actually Greg Lestrade, a detective at New Scotland Yard in the homicide division. He also promised to allow Sherlock access to his cases if Sherlock got off the drugs. He handed over a double homicide cold case for incentive.
She was naked, stretched across his sheets like a platter to be sampled.
Bill just grinned, “John’s a better shot, he’ll be down shortly.”
Sherlock clearly wants to ask the man more questions, but a glance at his watch shows they can’t dawdle. “Of course,” Sherlock inclines his head in goodbye before hurrying the Corporal along. The third floor is mostly office space, but the fourth is fascinating. There is only one large animal cage, and it is empty and shoved forgotten in the corner. On the lab counters, however,  are dozens of smaller cages, holding everything from spiders, to snakes, to jellyfish. One of the jellyfish appears to be glowing.
“John, you should call me John. I guess I’m not your Captain anymore.” John gave a pathetic smile.
John knew that the moment Wiggins died, Julie would either die instantly or, depending on how unlucky she was, linger until her heart stopped pumping.
He stitched the wound, careful to leave a drainage tube, and disinfect the area. He replaced the empty saline bag with one filled with antibiotics.
“You think my lazy brother will let you, Moriarty’s confirmed associate, anywhere near him?” Sherlock laughed.
John can only blame his intense focus on Moriarty and Sherlock for overlooking the other man in the room. He is standing off to the side, hands tucked lazily in his pockets like he doesn’t have a care in the world. The long sleeves of his shirt have been shoved up and John can see the vibrant green mark working its way up his arm. What surprises John the most, however, isn’t the mark, but the fact that he recognizes the man. “Colonel Moran?”
“I know, I believe you,” John says, offering Sherlock a sad smile, “but I have some things that I need to finish first. Get out of here, and stay safe, yeah.”
Revealing any information about Moriarty to his brother was a bad idea, but he could not allow a situation like the day before to repeat itself. Resigned, Mycroft made his way up the 17 steps to 221B.
Mycroft resists the urge to sigh, so much for this so-called ‘secretive’ organization. “Morning,” Mycroft greets politely, though he can’t be bothered to add the ‘good’.
(See the end of the chapter for
Currently: Steve and most of Natasha's part have been written. ~5,700 words.
“By what? Genetically modified dogs?”
Sally gives Lestrade another clap on the shoulder, before heading in the opposite direction.
“There are American soldiers on the west side, we just have to get there,” Z yells, shifting the vehicle.
“I have. I landed here,” John huffs, batting James with his wing.
“What!?” Colonel shoots out of his chair. “Absolutely not. Neither of you are allowed on missions that haven’t been signed off by a one-star or higher.”
Sorry this took so long, I’ve had some major writer’s block lately. I actually should be posting a chapter of Sky first, but I’m completely stuck on that one right now so here is this. Also I’m mid move/vacation right now so I’m scannerless. The pictures are still done in the inking style, but I drew them digitally.
Since, John isn’t shooting him (the browning is tucked against his back) Hamish assumes Mycroft hasn’t shared his picture yet. Good.
“I thought they said they didn’t want to drop us in the middle of a mission, that seems to be exactly what they’re doing,” John remarks looking out at the looming wilderness. They hardly know one another, and now MI6 wants them to banish a high level demon together. This can’t end well.
John clears from the room quickly, not bothering to mingle with any of the people that clearly want to meet with him. Sherlock tries to follow, but he gets caught up in the rafters. The boy is long gone by the time he can scramble down. Instead, he takes a few back tunnels, deciding to head to the meeting place Mycroft and he agreed on that morning.
Lestrade curses, grabs Sherlock’s arm and sprints through the door. They make it out of the back without trouble, jumping past a curtain and onto the main stage. Lestrade lets himself relax too soon. There a whoosh of displaced air, and without thinking he throws them both to the side, covering Sherlock with his body.
When the time is up, they walk into the Visionary. The room is blank, white walls with a white floor and a bright light shinning down on it all. Sherlock feels pain build behind his eyes, his heart beat speeds with the knowledge that soon he will be seeing scenes of the future.
“Why move them this far?” Ruiz asks, jumping down from the cab.
Sherlock holds up a stack of delivery menus with a grimace. “Perhaps not,” he agrees and walks past Lestrade to grab a mug with the unerring accuracy of someone who has long since searched and catalogued the cabinets.
John stays back, watching with interest beside Lestrade. “Do you think he knows them personally or just acquaintances?” John asks.
They all creak and crack when they stand, bruises ache and joints complaining. Bauza quickly goes to Don, hefting him up into his arms and supporting his missing leg.
“You think they were after Mycroft?” John asks.
“Sorry about him,” Lestrade sighs, watching him leave.
“Was there a chemical analysis of the blood?”
He wakes some time later, in the middle of the night. Or what he assumes is the middle of the night. Doc is nowhere to be seen and there is only a single lamp on in the corner, giving the room a warm glow and throwing the shadows into sharp contrast.
“Huh,” Mycroft sounds unconcerned, but the widening of his eyes shows his surprise.
John looks over at him. “Yours too.”
“It was extenuating circumstances,” Lestrade tries to glare, but fails spectacularly. It’s hard to look serious when trying, and failing, to scratch your own back.
As with every time before, there is no answer. Lestrade curses, and resists the urge to kick down his own bathroom door. He gestures over the doorknob, attempting his 5th variation of a lockpicking spell. The metal flares gold, but fades with a fizzle. The keyhole shifts, blowing a raspberry.
“I already am!” Sherlock takes a step forward, his own magic surging, raw power drawn by emotion.
Sally sent them both looks of scorn before returning to her desk. Noise erupted again, as everyone scuttled about to look busy, still sending curious looks at the new soul mate couple.
“Hmm,” Bauza hums, and wanders off to collect his pack.
They are exhausted, but John is in no hurry to get to the room. He lingers, gazing slack jawed at the hall leading to the elevator, decked out in more white faerie lights and smaller Christmas trees.
Hyperion grinned, revealing a double row of needle-like fangs, “I can hold it forever.”
“It’s alright Mrs. Hudson, what is it?” Sherlock asks peering around her shoulder.
“We need a healer,” Lestrade is shouting, pulling Soo Lin from the room. She’s gone pale, her veins standing out in jagged black lines like ink bleeding through paper.
There is another long pause. It makes Mycroft nervous.
Mycroft thinks of Sherlock again and feels a twist of guilt at being away. His brother always did love the holidays. “I’m certainly a poor substitute, but perhaps this will help.” Light spells are one of the first he learned, he conjures a number of them with a flick of his fingers, pinning the shimmering spheres along the windows and ceiling.
Mycroft presses his lips together to stop from snorting. “Yes, she said you knew everything and everyone in the city.”
“If Gab wants to help them, then you know I’m in,” Ruiz says with a shrug. “Just the four of us, we can get in and out with less attention. Can you lead us to him?” she asks, attention on John.
“That’s useful,” John grins.
“Whoa,” John says, awed. “Is it still sealed?”
John flicks his wrist, making the Brownings disappear. He’s embarrassed by the scolding, Moneypenny obviously seeing through his showing off. He isn’t even sure why he wants to impress this man. Mycroft is not his One, the bell did not toll, but he could very well spend a long time with him.
“He does occasionally have an interesting case you know. I know you don’t regret Irene’s case, judging by the texts you’ve been getting,” John comments, with a sly smile.
Gary, the taller man, nods, “Oh ay, thank goodness for poor Henry and his monster hound. I’d talk to Fletcher if your interested,” he points out the door to the man with the sign, “he does tours of the moors, says he’s seen the beast.”
“Thank you again for doing this dear,” Mrs. Hudson murmurs.
“I will start the search immediately, he will be found within the day, I have no doubt. “ Mycroft pulled his phone, ready to start issuing orders.
Sherlock takes the box, digging through the contents. Its filled with two bags of type O + red blood cells and a bag of AB-. “Thank you,” Sherlock acknowledges, tucking the box beneath his arm. The units are a week expired, which is the only reason he is allowed to have them, but still fresh enough for a few experiments.
Mycroft laughs, equally exhausted.
John settles beside him, leaning against the railing. With a glance around the garden, he pulls his wings out.
Sherlock, as he expected, scowls. “It was obvious of course, should have guessed,” he recovers, standing up with a huff. His coat flutters unhappily, brushing dust off. “I did not factor in all possibilities for my hypothesis, foolish.”
With his perception, Balor appears like a mass of black flame on the ethereal plane, but his brow is marked with a sickly light that promises destruction. Mycroft takes in the sight of the demon; of his great horns, his eyes like toxic waste, and the filthy fabric wrapped around his head, hiding away some great power and wonders how the two of them are suppose to subdue this monster.
Lestrade whistles, low and impressed, but not surprised. “Class 12 might be the highest rank, but they are not so rare that this Wu couldn’t be one, and we both know that power levels are the most variable in 12.”
He washed Helios first. It was an effort squishing her into the small tub, but they worked together to get the dirt from her coat. It took an entire bottle of shampoo and conditioner to get it back to its proper shine. Her feathers were in disarray, and John had to spend an hour with them sprawled across the room while he preened them back into place, linking the primaries so she would be able to fly once more.
There was no blast of semtex, so he took the moment to focus on the first sniper. Both were down, no visible movement.
“Don’t be elitist,” Sally teases.
It is quiet, still early in the morning and the cold keeping even the wildlife abed. The cemetery is the only source of color on his path. The season always brings about sentimentality, and signs of it mark the headstones. There are fresh flowers on almost all of the graves, the dusting of snow only enhancing the colour of the blooms.
Moriarty placed his hands in the man’s hair and shook his head like a wayward puppy. “This is Special Agent Carson, he has some information I want. I need you to get it for me. He’s being so stubborn, our dear Carson. I’m sure you could loosen his tongue a bit.”
“I’m fine John,” Mycroft assures him, “the magic here is very old, even more ancient than the energy seeped in London’s stones.”
“Mr. Holmes,” Lestrade interrupts. “This is Detective Sergeant Greg Lestrade with the Metropolitan Extrasensory Taskforce. Your brother has been helping us with a case.”
“It’ll take time, usually we would use a horse or a larger animal, but we don’t have any readily available and she will be able to produce more antibodies faster than using a larger animal,” Stapleton says, stepping over to him.
“While I have a certain repertoire, I was told to give you whatever you wanted,” Irene said. Her shoulders were tense, Jim must have threatened her. Still, she sat back on the bed, carefully displayed. “Tell me, Sebastian, are you sleeping with him?”
He looks down at the primary that lands at his feet. He picks up the large feather, watching as black seeps down the quill. It dissolves in his hand, crumbling to dust.
“And that has to be you? Does he not have a family? That kid has posh written all over him,” Sally is not convinced.
“The body is hardly going anywhere, Captain,” Sherlock shrugs, taking time to put his blood in the fridge.
“Dull,” Sherlock sighs, he hates when cases are solved due to sheer luck rather than any sort of intelligent pursuit.
“Hey Pete,” John grins walking over.
Usually a bond mark was only made of two symbols, a combining of the traits brought into the union. The mark on Sherlock was an interlocking spiral of knowledge, danger, loyalty, justice, healer, scientist, protector, scholar, and some John didn’t recognize. After the fifth swirl of symbols, the mark continued in unconnected tribal-like circles that ended in a double sunburst on Sherlock’s shoulder.
“Wait,” he stops, looking up and up and up, craning his head back until he almost tips over. “Is that a boat?”
Sherlock leads him down an access tunnel, wanting to get some distance from Moran. When he feels they are safe, he pauses and takes a look at John’s nose. “Its not broken.”
“That must be what they’re looking for,” Sherlock snatches the photo from his hand. “Even small quantities of jade can hold incredible enchantments. It’s rather difficult to enchant, however, even level twelves struggle with it.”
“Hey, LT, haven’t seen you in here in awhile,” he greets with a grin. Sgt. Hunt is paired with a male, warrant officer, they share a set of eight foot Cerulean Warbler wings. They are always carefully preened and kept clean, of course if Sherlock had wings large enough to fly he imagined he would keep them just as neat.
Sergeant Sally Donovan is waiting for him at the door. She’s dressed in a smart pant suit, starched within an inch of its life, and her hair is pulled into such a tight bun that the edges of her eyes are narrowed.
“Mrs. Hudson,” Sherlock interrupts, answering some of Lestrade’s questions with his address.
“The inspiration, why?” John asks.
John slips the other ring on, feeling the warmth of it against his skin. “Kandahar, but how could you know that?” he asks and grins.
The hound is further away than he expected, apparently Stapleton had distracted it by leaping in the opposite direction, confusing the beast as it tried to decide its prefered prey. It must have decided on him, however, because it is only a few meters away. He braces the pole against the wall, ready for the coming impact.
Sherlock chooses the Army over working in the Government with his brother. Imagine his surprise when he meets his mate under the Afghani sun. Wingfic
Sherlock looked somewhere between irritated and bored, which made the zing of curiosity coming from him rather interesting.
“Pets?” Moriarty asks in feigned surprise.
“Sorry kid,” the man shrugged and cocked the gun.
“Detective Lestrade and this is my… associate Sherlock Holmes,” he holds up his badge before tucking it back in his pocket. “We’d like to look around and ask some questions if that’s alright?”
He studied in between jobs and late at night, sleep became something that happened to other people.
“Then they’re idiots,” Jones barked, “don’t let anyone ever tell you you’re something you’re not.”
The man that comes up the stairs seems very small. He is actually an inch or two taller than John, but he shuffles into the room with his shoulders hunched and his eyes dart about as if his steps are haunted. He has dark circles beneath his eyes and his fingers are so stained with tobacco use they appear bruised.
“I think I shall make my own way home, thank you for dinner,” Irene kissed his cheek before hailing a cab.
“Oh thank god.” Lestrade heads to the parlor, calling out, “Hey John are you…” He trails off when he comes into the room. There is no sign of John or his coat. He doesn’t start to worry until the light of the telly draws his attention.
Lestrade took a deep breath and scratched behind Riddell’s ears. She pressed against his leg for comfort, “Into the breach, boss?”
Gregson nodded, lips down turned in a fierce scowl. “One of our own; gunned down in his own living room.”
“I was working as a consulting detective before I joined,” Sherlock murmured, the flutter in his chest almost feels like nervousness.
Sally punched him in the shoulder hard enough to hurt. “Shut up! That soldier saved a man’s life, what he did was heroic, not madness.”
Hudson River rises back, water splashing up their platform. “I will protect my humans,” he snarls, “they may spread their sewage and pollute my banks, but they are mine! I will not let any strike such a blow to my city, not again.” The words are an oath, they ring across the water, strong and true and lit with the promise of magic as old as the Earth itself.
The Colonel gives an unimpressed look before turning back to Smith. “Look, Smith, I don’t know what you want me to do here. Your Agent was a good man, 7 soldiers came back because of him, but I can’t send more soldiers out into the mountains. We already sent a retrieval squad, but the demons have disappeared. There are thousands of cave systems out there, and warding makes it impossible to search for signatures, and hell, even if we could, there are so many rogue demons out there, you might not even find the right group.” Colonel sighs, leaning forward on his elbows. “I lost good men out there too, but demon’s don’t take hostages. Your agent is dead.”
He is completely useless for the rest of the day. When the professor calls on him, he can only stare at her blankly until she moves on to someone else. His mind is a whir of conflicting emotions. The thought of seeing Sherlock again, of actually being able to talk to him, is exhilarating. It is also terrifying. He hasn’t contacted his mate for a reason, he could have sent a letter or something if he had really wanted to.
“Shit,” he snarls. “Fuck!” he growls, kicking the door jam, promptly forgetting his worry about Mrs. Hudson. He runs into the bedroom, grabs his gun, an extra mag, and his jacket before stomping down the stairs at full speed.
The ferocity seemed to leave John with the same swiftness, he shrunk in on himself. Returning to looking like someone’s grandpa in that horrible jumper, instead of the beast on the hunt he had been moments before. “Sherlock, I,” he murmured.
John knocks his knee against Sherlock’s in warning, but doesn’t contradict him. “Sorry, Mycroft,” John shrugs.
Suddenly, the darkness burst with light, too bright sunlight filling the area, accompanied by the scent of dust, blood, and gunpowder. Oppressive heat rushed in, searing London-bred skin.
“Yes, Sir.”
“Er, sorry,” John blushed. He assembled the gun easily, slipping each piece into place. The rifle fit in a padded suitcase when it was in two pieces. John checked the accompanying night gear before putting it away. “I feel like James Bond,” he teased, clicking the case shut.
Whatever diatribe Sherlock is working himself into is interrupted by Angelo’s well timed arrival. He places a candle on the table along with a basket of bread, so fresh from the oven that steam is curling off of it. “For your double date, more romantic,” Angelo winks, “I will make your dinners myself, only the best.”
The Madman purred, “Oh, not to your liking, what would please you?”
“A Golem?” she laughs, standing and wiping her hands ineffectively on her clay covered apron. “We build small constructs here,” she gestures at the man fighting with his vase. “The piece Bill here is working on is about as big as we get.”
“No, not yet,” Mycroft argues, even though he wants to return home with everything he is. “There have been reports of high level demons in Afghanistan. Demon’s without summoner’s bonds. It could be the master.”
Once everything has been cleared, the body is carefully untied and moved. Lestrade isn’t surprised to find more lacerations on the victims back.
Sherlock jumps up, eyes wide, “Oh!” He steps forward and places a rather embarrassing kiss on John’s lips. “Brilliant, John. Oh, I have missed you.” Sherlock grins wildly and runs off with John trailing after, an indulgent sort of smile on his lips.
Sherlock had learned this from a variety of sources and was quite certain that Dr. Franklin would have known about Charles’ love of hunting and his small cabin in the moors. He finds the cabin with some difficulty. It is deep in the moors, a small wooden structure well hidden in the trees, but the small puffs of smoke coming from the chimney gives it away. He presses his hand against the pocket of his Belstaff, feels the hard, metal outline there.
(See the end of the chapter for
It was desperation that led him to Mycroft’s home, though he would never admit it.
John narrows his eyes, switching his vision over to look deeper into the darkness. There is something in the distance, a shimmer of seething rage. “It’s not a demon,” John says, “not exactly anyways.” Demon’s have a feel to them like ice on the spine. This is different, but just as dark and just as dangerous. “Can you tell?”
Each step closer to the Dean’s office, sends a warning flare across his senses. With his scores tucked in his bag, he is well aware that it is not the Dean that wishes to speak with him.
“It must have taken some effort to circumvent my security,” another voice said. The man sounded overly posh, but John didn’t recognize him, though he suspected it was one of the hostages.
Sherlock’s eyes widen, “Of course, how did I never notice? Stupid. You’ve been pulling a 30 centimeter knife out of your pocket, no sheath, nothing. You’ve been summoning it every time.”
So for those that have never read any of my other stories, I actually was in the Army and deployed to Iraq, which is part of the reason of why I put Mycroft in a US unit instead of a British one. I was in a support unit, so I based the combat maneuvers on what I remembered from basic training.
He removes his belstaff, placing it over a chair, and rolls up his shirt sleeve. The black leaching into his mark, into his one proof that there is a perfect match just for him, makes him want to wince.
Irene steps forward and gently takes Molly’s hands in her own, pressing their right hands palm to palm. The bond has been a broken thing for years. At first their bonds didn’t react, their hands just pressed together while their hearts beat uncontrollably.
John nods, shuffling the pictures around. “They're all shadows or really blurry.”
Someone grabbed his reaching hand, squeezing it tightly. “Its alright, we’re taking you home. We’ll find him.”
“Excellent. I’ll text you the address,” Sherlock hangs up without further ado.
He may not have made it if Lestrade hadn’t shown up. The Golem got away, but Sherlock had confirmed his initial deduction. The painting was a fake.
“To know what, you bloody tosser?”
Mycroft can’t quite hide his sceptical look, but picks up the brolly. He narrows his eyes, observing the object with senses beyond simple sight. “It stores magic.”
It had been a risk to send the ring through Wiggins, there was a likely chance that they weren’t actually bondmates, but John knew he was right, knew Sherlock would take care of it for him.
“Yes,” Hyperion grins.
Mycroft has spent the entirety of his life - all twenty years worth anyways - attempting to control and focus his gifts, but occasionally they seem to respond as if of their own free will. At the word ‘mission’ he gets a feeling of warm light -holy magic- and an overwhelming darkness that sends a shiver up his spine. Interesting, but rather unhelpful. “In what capacity does your particular department wish to employ my...gifts?”
Temasek turns the full force of his silvery gaze on John. “There are not many angels that fall to my shores, but I care for them deeply. I cherish the fallen stars that protect this land and its people. Angels are much like Guardians in that way. They live to protect above all else. Humans misuse you, hoarding you away, only to take you out as weapons when the need arises. Yet still you protect. I do not wish to see your wings torn from you, so yes. I ask that you and your link return home, seise this foolishness, before the Master notices and swats you like flies.”
Sherlock leads the way back to the pods. The dust storm is just getting started, dust clogging his nose, but not too thick to be impossible to see through. They both fall coughing into his room.
“Sherlock Holmes,” he says, offering a hand.
“Why is that?” Mycroft asks.
A girl shuffles in with a tray. Her head is covered in an old hijab and her face is covered in dirt, but John would recognize those stubborn blue eyes anywhere.
Chapter Ten: Who are you, really?
The deductions are terrible. One is married with kids, he beats his wife regularly, but she won’t leave because he scares her. He’ll start on hitting the kids when they get older, no matter how much he promises other wise. Another is young and stupid, but has killed at least three men and sees no problem in raping the women or selling them for profit. One isn’t married, but has a thing for little boys and girls and did horrible, awful things in Libya but hasn’t had the chance to hunt in London yet. He’s been touching the girls the most because he can’t get to the kids. The last one is the leader and Hamish feels bile grow sharp and choking in the back of his throat.
He walked a convoluted path to a little café about four blocks from New Scotland Yard. It was a long walk, but it did wonders for calming the twitchy, confined feeling.
The lab was relatively easy, a concentration on pathology with a focus on tissue samples. It didn’t take John long to have his collection of samples carefully separated into piles of cancerous, normal, and his wayward liver tissue suffering from cirrhosis.
With both Uriel and John gone, James had demanded to be allowed into the Agent training program, and they had finally conceded. John thinks he may be following in James’ footsteps soon, but he’s still reeling from what happened in Singapore.
He assembled his rifle and prepped the scope, but did not turn it on. While the pool was closed, it was still light out. It would be a long wait.
By the next day, Lestrade has found the poison, tested the residue, and gotten Mrs. Williams to confess. Apparently, the two had been fighting over the neighborhood best garden award of all things.
They stop at the molecular lab, left unlocked by Lestrade’s friend and all the instruments turned on. Sherlock moves to the one he needs and starts preparing the collected sample for analysis.
Murray thinks while he hands over his card for the meal. “Last week or so, he’s doing pretty well. You know his leg didn’t bond quite as nicely, but a lot of physical therapy and running 5K’s seems to have gotten it working well. He’s dating some girl from his new job.”
“You looked like you were having a heart attack,” he pauses, “or a possession.” John steps further back letting his wings curl around his shoulders like a blanket.
“Greggory found the key evidence that led to the capture of the group,” Mycroft preens, clearly proud of his mate.
Smith nods, “I think the two of you were getting closer to the master than you expected.”
“It would have to be a very nice one,” Hamish teased, though he desperately hoped that’s all it was. He would endure the flirting and the lack of personal space to accomplish his goals, but Jim’s intentions were difficult to read.
“It may take awhile to get used to,” John shrugged.
Sherlock doesn’t say anything, just holds out his arm. John takes it carefully, the plastic on his left arm is surprisingly warm. He runs his fingers over the mark, sending pleasant sparks to Sherlock’s brain, despite the bruising.
Mycroft nods, gaze focused out on the water. He does not form a rune, but John can feel him pulling power from the enchanted wood, ready should the need arise.
“She died,” Sherlock says flatly, but John feels a twinge of something along the bond, though John still shoots him a glare for good measure.
The fire had barely spread, just sent up enough smoke to alarm the neighbors. The front door had obviously been kicked down and the three gun shot victims on the floor suggested that it hadn’t be done by the LFB.
“Stay here, Sherlock,” Lestrade pulls his athame from his pocket, grip white-knuckle tight. “I mean it,” he fixes Sherlock with a stern glare, “I smell blood.”
He groans.
Hamish woke to the touch of fingers along his back and warm breath against his ear. It took him a moment to remember his surroundings. The adrenaline fallout from the day before had given him a deep sleep.
John could always feel it when Helios changed, something in his chest shifted with her, but this change was like his heart and lungs and ribs were being yanked free.
“Turn back.”
Carson’s heart kept pounding and he was sweating profusely. To prevent shock or bleed out, Hamish ended up injecting a large dose of narcotics into the saline drip when his pulse hit 180.
John very much does not like the lab with everyone gone. It is eerily quiet, the only sound the soft buzz of the fluorescent lights. It reminds him of the hospital in Afghanistan, sure the hospital was packed after a convoy went wrong, but mostly it was quiet. The hospital also had a habit of leaving the least amount of lights on as possible to save power. The similarities make the hair on the back of his neck stand up.
“That would support the smuggler theory,” Lestrade comments. “Traveling back and forth for work.”
“What do you mean?” Sherlock narrowed his eyes. He had done some study of Visions, but they were private things. Very little was written on their actual content.
“I have no interest in wasting away in Cornwall while my mind devours itself from boredom.”
“Huh,” John huffs, running his gaze along the massive cruise ship that bizarrely spans the roof of three skyscrapers. He can only stare for a moment, he’s worn out and his wings are too dirty to comfortably fold away. He’s attracting attention.
“You need some help with those,” Hamish holds out his hand for a bag, even as he’s kicking himself. John seeing him is one thing, going to 221B and seeing Sherlock is a different matter entirely.
Sherlock rolls his eyes before taking a look. The body is a twenty-five year old white male with a gunshot wound to the lower left quadrant. The bullet had gone through his side and out the back, rupturing the kidney and colon. The death would have been a slow one, tortuous blood loss. His wings are about five foot, tucked carefully behind his back. They are covered in dried blood, the substance to hard to wipe from his cardinal feathers.
Mycroft shoves the mobile back in his pocket. He has work to do.
“Useful,” Mycroft comments, handing the card back. It had only been imprinted with the one message, the paper is now truly as blank as it had first appeared.
So Mycroft sits on a blanket in the middle of the park while reading a book, but really spending the time keeping an eye on his wayward sibling. Sherlock seems unaware of his dwindling Timer, or at least desperately trying to seem unaware.
“Yes, I think you do,” and then Jim’s fingers are at his trousers, pulling them open with some skill.
John has to cover his mouth to stop from bursting out laughing. Apparently Sherlock hasn’t much changed from when he was twelve. He’s still blindingly clever. It is only because John is looking away from Sherlock in his attempt not to laugh that he sees the shape moving in the water. “Sherlock, look out!” John shouts jumping from behind the tree.
With no other plan, John returns to Baker street. When the bond had first developed he had been overwhelmed by the shared thoughts, pained by the mind filtering into his own. Now he wishes more than anything to hear Sherlock’s thoughts, to understand what he is thinking. He knows he is bothered by Moriarty’s appearance, but Sherlock’s emotions are so jumbled about it they are impossible to decipher. John isn’t sure even Sherlock knows how he feels about the matter.
“You’ve settled yourself quite well into his ranks, Moriarty would certainly trust a man that does not hesitate to kill and torture,” Mycroft commented, a brow raised in contempt.
“Oh Sherlock,” Mrs. Hudson sighs with fond exasperation. She stands, brushing out her skirt. “I’m Martha Hudson dear. I’m Sherlock’s,” she glances at the teen, “well minder I suppose would be the term.”
A new Case
Lestrade’s firm hand kept him back. “Shh, Sherlock there’s nothing you can do, just watch okay, just watch.
“Of course, not” Sherlock grinned, but switched to a scowl as his last match burned out against his fingers. “That was my last one, now what am I suppose to do for this experiment?”
“You know this how exactly? I mean, I assumed it was the guy in the long coat and not the crazy guy, but where are you getting this name? I mean, Sherlock, really?” Bill gave a wry twist of his lips.
She claps a hand on his shoulder, over the black and white striped jumper that is his own form of armor. “I had a link, too, you know. He led me to Grace. I owe him.”
“I hardly did it to spite you, Sherlock, you know it’s a random variable,” Mycroft responds, but he sounds rather smug about the matter.
He is still staring at the hole in the wall when the man shakes his shoulder. “You alright mate, nothing broken?”
He stands, stripping off his gloves with a snap. “It had to be something quite large to cover a man’s face with one hand and suffocate him.”
The second bottle contains concentrated hemlock, a single drop capable of causing paralysis, coma, and eventually death. He adds 6 drops.
“Are you alright?” Mycroft asks, his brow beetling in the slightest hint of concern. He helps Lestrade to sit in a plush, old chair that nearly swallows him up.
“He was interrupted here, what did you do?” Jim asked, taping the trailing scar.
Helios stayed hidden, keeping far enough behind to dodge between allies or jumping across roofs.
Greg looks up, surprised to find Mycroft standing in the doorway. “Did you know Sherlock was bonded?” he asks, in lieu of explanation.
Sherlock scowled. “While I don’t doubt the incompetency of the government, Mycroft, I would think you could gather a bit more than that.”
“Oh Dr. Watson, I would enjoy the time you have left. Now that you’ve both been bitten it won’t be long now.” The intercom cuts off with a sharp screech, but John doesn’t care because his vision has started to blacken around the edges. Everything is going dark and as he falls into the void, only the sounds of the hound’s snarls follow.
A little note on body armor. So in the movies they always try and make it look sexy, which is hilarious because it's the most uncomfortable piece of equipment to wear, especially if you are a women. All Army equipment is sized for men, so the armor is way too big. The vest itself really just carries the large ballistic plates that make it bullet proof. The current IBA has four plates one on each side and in the front and back. The vest itself is thick and padded, designed to absorb shrapnel that the plates might not catch. They tend to be too long in the torso for women so they ride up and make sitting down a threat to strangulation, its why when most women wear body armor you'll see them with both hands holding onto the collar, they are constantly pulling the vest down to stop it from choking them. There is absolutely zero contour to the vest and very little in the plates, so if you have anything larger than an A cup, the vest will ride up even more and put a lot of pressure on your chest. Don't get me wrong, they are life saving pieces of equipment, but I drew Gabriel in a bulky vest because that's how they are, and I still ended up giving her more contour then they really have. Wearing an IBA feels a bit like being an upside down turtle, except your shell weighs 50lbs.
Lestrade, unfortunately, stands firm. “I need to speak to your parents, old enough to take a cab by yourself or not.”
Hamish finds himself face to face with the thugs and they look petrified.
“You’re the tiger from Singapore,” John says, certain. He uses the creature’s surprise to shove him away.
“Christ, Sherlock!” John startles, shifting back. “What are you doing?”
“So he found a bit of the wetlands to dump the bodies?” Lestrade asked looking around the swamp.
It is an uncomfortable sentiment, so Sherlock pins the ‘free food’ idea to the wall and hurries down one of the many corridors. John already has a room. It’s small like an office, but already cluttered with information. The desk is made of compressed sand and bullet casings, the air is heavy with desert heat and it warms him to the bones. News articles he had read of the hounds have been moved from the archives to one wall. Another wall is filled with pictures of the boy and in the center is a close-up of the amazing scar on his shoulder.
John and Mycroft sit huddled together over the tray between their seats, the mission files laid out for review. “I just don’t understand how a guardian just disappears,” John sighs, pulling one of the pages filled with pictures towards him. The pictures are all of various statues around Boston, taken in places the statues definitely shouldn’t be.
“Well I’m afraid I’ve had trouble finding Johnny boy, your mate seems to have run away. Weeeee,” there was a horrible echo. “You should be pleased he is being sensible, you hardly want to spend your life tied to some dumb soldier. What do you think that bond would have been level one, two maybe? Or were you hoping to match your brother with a four, or a legendary five, perhaps?”
“Slowed the molecules,” Mycroft explains, getting to his feet with John’s help. His clothes are filthy.
I'm so sorry how long this has taken. It has been a busy couple of months. I finished my med school primary application, and have filled out all of my secondary applications, now I just have to twiddle my thumbs until interview season and hope I get an invite.
Hudson River moves even closer so that all they can see is its dark scales and one ruby eye. He is close enough that Mycroft could reach out and touch him - if he didn’t particularly value his hand anyways. “I am aware,” he rumbles, “Boston is gone.”
Darkness follows.
Something in him cracked, the dark angry thing he had shoved into a hidden place after Syria was breaking free. The
“Honestly, Sherlock, I could speed things along, easily.”
“I think I will search for another place in need tomorrow. The manager offered a free meal whenever I want, while its best not to abuse it, a collection of such offers may solve our food issue,” Mycroft comments when he is done. Once upon a time, he had been a chubby youth, but time on the streets had worn him away. His cheeks are sunken and his eyes dark, but now his stomach is slightly distended from the meal.
Sherlock isn’t sure what makes him say it, but in a whisper he answers,” I had to know what’s wrong with me.” There is a sudden breeze against his face, the stirring of Lestrade’s wings, a mark of his surprise.
This is not a star trek cross over, his fake name is John Harrison because I'm a nerd. ;P
“New job?” John asks, avoiding the topic of Don’s leg. Don had received the same nanite transfusion that John had, but being older and with the wound in bad shape his new nerves didn’t fire quite right. The leg was still better than a prosthetic, but caused trouble when synapses misfired.
“Oh don’t be so sore Seb, I knew he would beat them. It is this fight I can’t let him win. It is more entertaining that way, don’t you think? The underdog snuffed out in the last match,” Moriarty giggles. Seb has to be Sebastian Moran, the fifth fighter that took the challenge.
“What sort of things?” Mycroft asked.
“I’m Bill Murray, like the actor, but funnier,” the bandana man says.
Lestrade led them down the long corridors to one of the Vision rooms. One of the so-called nurses was standing outside with the Vision medication. Sherlock read her history in moments. She wasn’t actually a nurse, just a pretty face to make the patrons more relaxed. The scuffs on her shoes and the stain on her shirt showed the job didn’t pay well and she spent her nights working as a waitress. The deductions helped, made him less...tense.
“Ay, see that you eat it this time,” Mr. Hawthorne calls after him.
“ ‘s funny you’d mention Hounds, I only know one, rumour is he’s barkin down in Baskerville,” Wiggin’s says.
Sherlock hated the man, but having a chance to show off and take his mind off John was just what he needed.
“Did you at least shower?” Lestrade asks, dropping the files on the coffee table with a thump.
John remembers the skull that had been pulled from the swamp. He imagines keeping the skull is illegal, and cleaning it may actually be considered a destruction of evidence. Instead of mentioning any of that he offers, “I have some lab space at the hospital. We could get a coffee on the way and you could use some of the bleaching equipment there.”
Sherlock turns away from the screen, his gaze unreadable, but John can feel a sharp spike of something across the bond. It makes him sick to his stomach. “Back to Baker Street, there is nothing I can do here,” Sherlock says, pulling his scarf from his coat pocket.
“You were injured?” Sherlock asks, curious. He flicks his eyes over John’s form with the same precision he had wielded as a child. “The leg,” he states, sounding certain.
Allowing his mind to work on a separate problem, Sherlock spent his time in the morgue with his riding crop for an old cold case he was working on.
There are a number of paths leading outward from the main chamber, but John closes in on the left hand chamber without pause. “This way,” he says, taking the lead.
I'm pretty sure someone asked me not to do Irene, but I had been planing to have Irene in since the beginning. Sorry.
Hamish spends the night staring at the ceiling. Somehow, he sleeps.
Seb’s face shifts rapidly, from pleased to angry to curious. He steps around Sherlock and pokes at his arm. The touch on his marks burns like fire , and he can tell from the piercing pain that the man is jabbing the blackened scar from the Hound.
“Like I got shot again,” John admits. “Where’s Sherlock?”
Six years ago Greg had met his bond mate in the sort of encounter that usually appeared in romcom dramas, and along with Mycroft Holmes came Sherlock. It had been a strange transition to suddenly be responsible for a twelve year old, even more so when that kid is Sherlock.
Of course, by then his father had suffered a heart attack of such strength he was dead before he reached the hospital. His Mummy’s mark changed to black, and the edges reached out in black veins.
“Do you know who they are?” John asks, leaning into her touch. In the wake of her glow, his face is cast in shadows.
“Hmm easier then you would think. Every service has their weak link, now no more out of you, hmm.”
This was suppose to be the last chapter before the epilogue, but it didn't quite work out that way, but the end is on the horizon.
Sherlock’s lips twitch in amusement, “Please, milk and sugar.” John leaves, and Sherlock takes the time to breath and get himself back under control. It’s ungodly early, but he has no interest in returning to bed, instead he pulls his dressing gown around his shoulders and heads downstairs.
Sherlock leads Lestrade and, unknowingly, John on a winding trail through the backwoods of Gainesville to the Natural Area Teaching Laboratory. The area is actually a nature preserve owned by the University, but has nature trails open to the public.
She gestures at the goo.
“Wait, so if the General has gone to take care of Van Coon, why did the mark leads us here?”
“‘Lo Loki, playin’ fiddle in tha park again,” Wiggins waggles his fingers in greeting.
“Insanity or patience would be my guess,” Sally grumbles.
The man grunts, pushing with both hands against the knife even as his bandaged fingers start to drip blood.
Sherlock marches right up to the door, and pushes his way in without hesitation.
John teased, surveying the flat. “This is nice, very nice, but are you sure you want me to move in with you, just like that?” John was not normally a self-conscious person, but it did seem sudden.
John has to stifle a grin, the pink is a terrible stereotype, but he can see how strong the bond is. The lines of the three levels are thick with interlocking signs for Faith and Endurance and don’t show even a hint of infection. “Takes all types I suppose,” John says, thinking of the marks on his own arm, symbols for danger and adventure.
John, and to a lesser extent Irene, watched in awe as Sherlock managed to use each computer in rapid succession. He seemed to be using soul search websites. John had never been on one himself, since until recently he thought he didn’t have a soul mate. The sites were for people that had their vision, but didn’t have any luck finding their match. It was usually a result of weaker bonds, but occasionally people in Irene’s predicament searched for missed connections on the sites.
“The Army will only take level 1 and 2 bonds or no bond at all. Those with higher bonds have to enlist with their bond mates. A young doctor like you could do well in the service,” the man remarked, showing his blank wrist.
