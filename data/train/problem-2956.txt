He leaned towards the blonde, propping himself up on his hands behind his back. “You’re not a jerk, Dean. I think what’s our problem is that we don’t communicate enough with each other. If we’d just sit down and talk this through, we could avoid things like that.”
With a small grin, Cas met his eyes and nodded once, saying, “Yeah, it’s like that. I feel like I do something important; like it means something to someone. And so I feel like the luckiest man to have found him. I can’t wait for aftercare with Dean, how he’ll be, and how long it will take for him to come back.”
“Greenghh… Castiel,” Dean moaned, throwing his face to the side to press it into his arm, already bracing himself for what was to come, and Cas smiled brightly, crawling into the bed between Dean’s open legs and reaching his hand out to grab the end of the dildo. He pulled it out almost entirely, then pressed it back inside, circling it to press against every inch of Dean’s inner walls before pulling it back out and sliding it in again. After a while, he found the right rhythm to fuck his submissive with the dildo, and every time Dean moaned too loudly or tried to withdraw whenever he thought he’d get too close to the edge, Jimmy would readjust the clamps and screw them tighter to pinch his nipples and heighten the pressure around them.
“That wasn’t your fault either, we talked about this a hundred times already, Sam.” Her heart ached for the brothers. They had been through too much together.
Jimmy took his hands off Dean’s cock after a long while of giving it the utmost attention and rubbed his hands clean off his boyfriend’s pre-cum on the sheets to soothe them down his spread legs, stroking his thighs and kneading the flesh. “Are you okay, Dean?”
“Heck yes.” Turning around to meet his eyes, Dean said, “But that’s not gonna stop me.” And stubborn as he was, Dean took a few steps into the water so that every time a wave broke, his feet were buried in the water to his ankles.
It was quiet in the room and Castiel met Jimmy's eyes, expectantly. They were alone for now as Dean had gone outside to collect himself and buy some groceries for dinner – since they decided to spend the night together in Jimmy’s apartment – while the two of them waited for him in the living room.
With a small smile, Sam huffed, “Well, that’s soothing.”
With each stroke, Dean felt the pressure inside him building and building and he was glad that Jimmy decided to give his dick a break or else he certainly would have come already. And by the time Castiel deemed him ready, which wasn’t before he had four fingers shoved up his ass, Dean's dick was more than rock hard and flushed. Jimmy seemed to find it interesting, though, because he was still watching it with those blue eyes, his hand clasping Dean’s thigh as if physically reminding him of his presence.
“If you want us to shave as well, you can tell us, Dean.”
So, because that was the only thing that made him, and seemingly Cas, feel better right now, Jimmy said, “Why not? We could date him both. It’s just getting to know him. It would be like having an equal friend we go out with.”
Jimmy swallowed down his bubbling anger with a loud gulping sound and Castiel clenched his jaw as he breathed out, “Open your jacket, you never wear it closed,” his voice flat and low.
“Wow,” Dean breathed out quietly, his eyes focused on the tattoo, “it’s… wow, it’s beautiful. And green.” He lifted his head and their gazes locked onto each other’s, staying like that for a moment until Dean whispered, “Thought you’d only do black tats… why? Not that it’s not beau–”
“God, I dunno. What don’t I want to change…?” This made Jimmy sad once more and he saved the information that Dean had really low self-esteem to change it in the future, hopefully. “Uh, my mind? I guess I’d like to change the way I think. Start seeing the world as others do.”
The burgers were amazing and the twins slowly enjoyed their food, watching Dean demolish the fries and inhale the burger like a starving man, even as he continued to show his appreciation in a very vocal manner, which made them chuckle and grin from ear to ear.
“Yeah,” Dean nodded, turning around and placing his hands on Jimmy’s shoulders after he gave his permission to so that he could bend down a bit. Soon after, he felt one hand spreading his cheeks apart and the cold razor gliding gently and smoothly over the skin surrounding his exposed hole. He was glad that he had taken care of cleaning himself very, very thoroughly before while Cas and Jimmy had watched because, if he hadn’t, he’d feel uncomfortably self-conscious now. Though, fortunately, it didn’t take long until Castiel pressed a kiss above his crack and mumbled, “You’re all smooth and hairless now, Dean,” into his skin.
After a while, Dean frees himself from Castiel’s needy grip around him and breaks the kiss to pant for air; their foreheads touching and their breaths mingling.
Interrupting their little conversation, Castiel rested his chin on Dean’s shoulder and whispered into his ear, “Speaking of… how do you want us to return the favor?”
“Sam,” Dean warned, meeting his eyes, “just take me to your place… please.”
“God, you feel wonderful around me,” Cas grunted in between harsh breaths as his movements began to falter, “So utterly wonderful.” Dean merely whimpered quietly at the particularly harsh thrust that followed to accommodate his words and Castiel tightened his hands around his feet, dropping his chin once more to kiss his toes while he kept pushing into his submissive again and again until he ordered, “You’re so good for me, Dean, so perfect. Come for me, beloved.”
Shrugging, Dean’s expression turned into one of indifference although his amusement was still obvious and he mumbled, “Think you’d yield to me faster than Jimmy would.”
Dean seemed to appreciate the gesture as well and he started to bob his head almost immediately, his eyes open and locked onto Jimmy’s. Castiel couldn’t just hear but see Dean working Jimmy over with his tongue, slicking the way and sucking at his tip. He hollowed his cheeks and made sure that his humming and content noises gave Jimmy’s cock some extra stimulation and if Cas had to guess, he’d say it was working pretty well. Because Jimmy was moaning almost incessantly and Cas saw how hard he tried not to meet Dean’s mouth halfway and thrust into him. From his position, he saw that Jimmy had his head thrown back, and when he looked back to where Dean was currently sliding up his entire shaft, he saw that glint in his eyes, the pleasure he got from making them lose their minds like this.
didn’t change, Cas had a hard time ignoring his pressing arousal like he had done so many times before.
Dean laughed at that, a hearty sound that echoed around them and made Jimmy’s chest tighten with adoration and love. “It’s fantastic.”
“Green, Castiel,” he said breathlessly.
With a silly smile, Dean reached out to the nightstand again and grabbed his cell, checking the time. He was awake earlier than usual, so early that he heard Sam come back from his morning run a few minutes later. For a while, he just stared at the screen, then decided to open his recents and selected Castiel’s number, choosing the option to add a new contact. Dean saved it as ‘Cas’ and typed a message.
This time, the Sub didn’t move his hips to meet Castiel, merely stayed still and took what his Dom was giving him. His breathing was slow and deep, just like the pace of the sex he was having, his head was thrown back into the pillow to bare the long and wonderful column of his throat with his mouth wide open – although no audible sounds were leaving Dean’s lips, Jimmy could see how he formed moans and words – and his eyes were closed, which didn’t happen often during sex because Dean loved eye contact as much as they did. His body wrecked slightly with every push of Castiel’s cock into him and his belly seemed to deflate every time Cas pulled back out, and everything combined as well as every detail on itself was the most captivating thing Jimmy had ever seen.
It took some more coaxing and shaking his body slightly until Dean blinked up at them through foggy eyes as if trying to orient himself. They helped him drink a little more water, fed him a granola bar, cuddled with him, and talked to him, still praising, and though Dean managed to keep his eyes somewhat open, he was unresponsive to questions and seemed to be more in a deep daze than truly here with them. It shouldn’t have worried Cas yet because Dean was always like that afterward but he had the unsettling sense that something was off.
At once, Jimmy let go of him and stepped aside, and Castiel withdrew from him, leaning back against the dresser and closing the open drawer with the movement. Standing next to each other, one turning curious, wide eyes on him, the other dark and lustrous ones, both the same shade of blue, Dean let out a shaky breath and slid his hands past the waistband, pulling down his sweats just so that the Prussian color and satiny fabric peeked out.
“Hell, yeah. I could take a nap, too,” he said, grinning brightly, but then a thought seemed to cross his mind and he looked almost shy when he admitted, “although, there’s another thing…” He looked at Jimmy with big eyes as if expecting him to know which thing he meant and waiting for him to say something, which didn’t happen since he had no freaking idea what Dean could be asking for. When Dean received nothing but a questioning look from Jimmy, he went on and said, “I really want to take out the plug and get all cleaned up again…?”
Once Jimmy was done with his other nipple, he crawled down the length of Dean’s body until he was between his legs, which Dean made sure to spread apart so that he could sit comfortably. Though, his Dom seemed to have something else in mind as he grabbed his legs and pulled Dean’s body closer against his so that his legs ended up draped across Jimmy’s thighs. He probably had the perfect view of Dean’s stuffed ass but Jimmy seemed determined not to stare at it yet and instead bent down to glide the popsicle down the middle of Dean’s torso into his bellybutton. With a dirty smile, Jimmy licked into his navel to collect the melted ice with his tongue, and then slid the popsicle across his stomach from one hip to the other, only to lick and kiss and bite his way across his belly to follow the line of water he left behind.
Jimmy laughed at that, watching his lover chuckle at his reaction, his eyes closed, but they shot wide open in surprise when Castiel suddenly manhandled him so that he ended up on his back, Cas on his side next to him, grabbing his thigh and draping Dean’s leg over his hips to pull him in closer and gripping the meat of his asscheek with the hand before giving it a sharp slap. Dean yelped at the sting and the deep ache in it from the crop before but it soon changed into chuckling again when Cas slid his hands across his asscheek in a soothing way and leaned down to kiss him. Jimmy saw that the smack had left a white handprint behind on his red skin and he watched it fade with a very new kind of fascination and arousal. “Is that a way to speak to your Dom?” Cas rasped, sliding his tongue along the edge of Dean’s jaw. “Is this,” he pushed his crotch against Dean’s for emphasis, “what you call modest? When it makes you scream and sob and beg for more?”
The shower had washed away the long day and once Jimmy had calmed down enough, he had run his hands over every inch of Dean, from his bowed legs to his hard, rosy nubs and into his dark blonde hair, trying to make up for the pain he’d felt with the soft touches of his hands.
“What’s wrong? You’ve been acting strange lately.” He sits down next to Dean on the bed and places his hand on his friend’s shoulder, reassuringly.
He’d come close to a panic attack, Jimmy was aware, but he wasn’t sure why. Maybe he felt so ashamed about losing his temper and getting into a fight, that he felt like he needed to be hurt in return? Or maybe he hated himself for ‘hurting’ them by asking for Sam’s help? Which, sure, that stung. But it wasn’t something Jimmy would be super sad or furious about. Dean had his reasons.
“Eh, you like… pass me around during sex. I love it a lot, just like I do in reality. You fuck me first as I sit in your lap facing you, you’re gripping my thighs while you thrust into me and then, after a while of just watching and right before I come, Jimmy grabs me by my thighs as well, but from behind, and just pulls me off of you mid-sex. I hold on to his shoulders while he walks us back to the bed and when he sits down on it, he impales my ass on his dick while pushing me down so that I’m in his lap as well. Then it’s your turn to fuck me while Cas watches,” Dean said, looking at Jimmy’s lust-blown eyes. “You go on until I finally come and then continue to thrust into me, but slowly. After a moment, you just lean back until you’re lying on your back and you push me down as well so that Cas can crawl between my legs. And when you start to move again, Cas slicks up his fingers and pushes them into me along with your dick until he’s almost fisting me.”
“I wish there was a way to show you, to make it easier for you, Jimmy. I know you’re not a real Dom, it’s just not in your veins, you don’t think like one. And I know this is hard for you… I wish I could make it easier…” Dean caressed his arm, soothing him. “You know you don’t have to watch, Jimmy. You don’t have to be in the room during punishments like that if it makes it easier for you.”
Jimmy opened his mouth in protest just to close it again, then pondered Dean’s statement for a minute before he said, lamely, “That’s not it.” And Cas knew Dean was right, Jimmy was still very cautious with him, even if he didn’t need to be, which was sweet but he also knew how much Dean hated to be treated with kid gloves.
“Fuck yes,” Cas and Jimmy said at the same time, making Dean smile brightly, his happiness almost blinding in its pureness and beauty.
Castiel grabbed a pillow from the floor beside the bed and leaned over Dean to gently guide his head off the mattress and put the pillow underneath. The blonde smiled fondly up at Cas and shifted his shoulders slightly to get into a more comfortable position and Jimmy’s heart swelled in his chest.
“You don’t have to do anything but
Laughing, Jimmy said, “Well, you know one of us is always around the corner wanting you.”
Watching Jimmy and Dean engage with each other like that still managed to make Cas feel a bit jealous and that was only his brain trying to compensate for that.
His voice broke at the end, tears threatening to fall again, and he felt choked-off. Knowing that he didn’t feel well, Dean slowly turned around in his arms and looked at him, hugging him close. “Hey, I’m fine, Jimmy. It’s fine.” Dean’s hands stroked down his back, trying to soothe him. “That’s what makes you different from real Doms… at that moment, you turn off that part of yourself, that part that’s afraid of hurting me, and let your Dom take over. That’s how it works and that’s how you’re able to ‘hurt’ the person you love because you know right then, you’re taking care of a submissive.” Jimmy merely nodded and remembered that Cas had just said something similar before he joined Dean, and sniffled once. “Would it help you to read about how it works? About our dynamic?” As an afterthought, Dean cursed, “God, we should have done that, to begin with…”
There was a moment of silence as Castiel seemingly thought about Dean’s words until his mouth formed into a soft ‘O’ and he explained, “Oh Dean, you haven’t done anything wrong. Not at all. It’s quite the opposite, honestly. I just wanted to give your mind something to concentrate on while we’re at the restaurant because I know you get self-conscious about almost anything that you do when you think you don’t fit in. I didn’t think it would come over as possessive as it did, my apologies.”
Laughing softly, Jimmy and Cas watched Dean grab a towel and start drying himself off, and Castiel decided he should leave the tub as well. So he stood, left the bath, and pulled the plug, grabbing a towel, too, and starting to dry his body next to Dean.
The self-loathing tone with which Dean said the last part made Jimmy frown and a bit sad. “Well, doesn’t he go to Stanford? I mean, if this isn’t product of good education on your part, I don’t know what is. If you had to raise him almost all on your own, I’d say you’ve done an amazing job.” Jimmy would have loved to know why their father was absent or why he had to raise his little brother, but he was willing to wait as long as it took Dean to be ready to tell it.
Dean’s expression was pleading and sad when he said, “And I feel so guilty about all this. I think I messed things up between Cas and me and I really don’t want to leave without trying to make this up again. Please don’t be mad at Cas. Scream at me, punch me. Do whatever you like, but please know that I never wanted to put a wedge between you two. I’m just so terribly stupid, I ruin everything I touch…” The blonde met his eyes for a second, and Jimmy watched as fear and insecurity flit across his stunning face, and he so desperately wanted to go and kiss all that worry and guilt away. Of course, he wasn’t mad at Dean or Castiel.
Dean sat up straight at that and leaned forward to put his hands on Jimmy’s knees reassuringly, making sure to meet his gaze. “That’s okay, Jimmy. Don’t worry. We can show you, though, if you wanna…?”
He shrugged once, watching as the twins looked at each other suspiciously before walking back into his bedroom and moving to close the drawer. Standing in front of it with his hands already giving it a slight push, Dean suddenly felt hot breath against his neck at the same time as a big and strong pair of hands grabbed his ass, each cheek in one palm, squeezing. He keened at the touch, leaning back against whoever it was and reveling in the feel of soft lips against his skin.
Reaching his hands up to hold on to Castiel’s, Dean placed his feet in a way that allowed him to use them for leverage and started to rock back and forth before lifting himself up and placing back down with Cas’ help. Again and again. They went slow at first because they had to find a manageable pace – well, that was until Cas rasped, “You’re allowed to come now, Dean. But I want you to remember this, so that every time you think about pleasuring yourself even though we asked you not to, you’ll think about the ache in your ass bothering you for days,” and pressed his palm over Dean’s belly button, just feeling how his hips rolled before, suddenly, Dean was bouncing on his cock with the force of which Cas was pistoning up into him.
Without answering, Cas reached into another bag and pulled out a pair of jade green panties that were just as satiny as the ones Dean wore last night. At the sight, he was being remembered of his hard-on, but there was a smile breaking out across his face anyway and Castiel grinned as well. “I thought he’d need something to match his eyes.”
Before their boyfriend could freak out and leave, Castiel hurried to say, “Okay wait. I’ll have to admit that ever since you have gone back home, I’ve been looking at apartments for the three of us and there are a lot that I think would suit us well and are in our price range. You’d live near your brother and we’d finally have a chance to deepen this relationship.”
Groaning, Jimmy turned his face to bury it in the pillow and mumbled, “Shuddup,” while he listened to Dean’s soft laughter.
After a moment, Dean whispered, “We should make Sunday evenings all about relaxing together in the future, what do you think?”
One last check on the main knots and Cas was finally able to step back and admire his beautiful submissive.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m not really sure myself…” he muttered, thinking back to his dream.
Fortunately, it doesn’t take much longer before Castiel feels the heat pooling in his stomach coming together in a tight knot and with one final thrust deep into Dean, Castiel releases himself along with a loud and content groan that vibrates through his entire body, and paints Dean’s insides with his hot sperm, marking him – claiming Dean as his.
It was only then – when he could feel someone watching him; Castiel’s stares did have a weight to them that Dean could never miss – that he realized that Castiel had known Dean would spend his time like this; trying to do the exact opposite of what his order was because it would keep him busy and he had something to do other than sitting around. He had known it would distract Dean from the uneasiness he felt from doing nothing by provoking his Dom for making him stay home and it was a really good tactic from Cas.
“Guess that’s the first time I ever heard you say that.”
Cas smiled softly and nodded, tracing the silk crossing over Dean’s hip with a finger. Then he looked about the room and asked, “Is there a mirror somewhere?” and grinned widely when he saw the full-length mirror in the corner of the room at the entrance, right at the opposite wall of the door. He used his hand on Dean’s hip to guide him in front of it and let their boyfriend take a look at himself. Jimmy watched Dean watch himself in the mirror and smiled when he turned around, trying to see what was in the back.
During their little tour around the area at Emerald Bay State Park, the fairly painful situation turned out to be a real bummer, and an uncomfortable one at that, since walking with his erection wasn’t truly that pleasant or sexy. Jimmy had chuckled a few times at seeing Dean’s gait, his bowed-legs now even more noticeable because he was trying not to chafe himself bloody, though Cas had been so nice to lend him the picnic blanket he had stuffed in the bag for Dean to carry, which he had been super thankful for. He’d been holding it in front of his crotch in a subtle way to hide his tenting pants the entire way to the beach. Although his boyfriends hadn’t been as generous when they’d decided to get the check and leave the restaurant, letting Dean walk out of there with his hands suspiciously close to his crotch in a desperate attempt at hiding his boner from all those fancy people.
Leaning in to nibble at his earlobe, Jimmy asked, “What’s the dirtiest thing you fantasize about?” successfully catching him off-guard. When Dean leaned back to look at him curiously, there was a smirk playing with Jimmy’s lips and he truly wanted to kiss them again, but as he leaned in to do exactly that, Jimmy placed a hand on his chest and shook his head, “Tell me first.”
Hearing Dean’s voice waver at the end had tears bursting into his eyes and he tried hard to blink them back, burying his nose in Dean’s hair and breathing in his soothing scent. “I’m not disappointed, Dean. I’m just sad that you care more about pleasing an unworthy Dom than you do about your own well-being. And I don’t hate you. I never could. It’s how you work, Dean, and I’m sorry that he uses it against you for his own advantage. I should’ve known that letting you go back to him wasn’t a good idea.”
Dean fought for words to say but after a few tries, he just slumped his shoulders and gave up. Castiel didn’t let it go yet, though, because he caught Dean's chin between his thumb and forefinger and tilted his head up. When their eyes met, Castiel's breath hitched and Jimmy felt impossibly overwhelmed with emotions as he took in Dean’s red-rimmed eyes, tear-streamed cheeks, and trembling lips. He barely kept from crying at the sight and Castiel’s voice was thick with emotion when he realized, “You don’t think you deserve to be loved.”
Just a few moments later, a beautiful tall woman with a bright smile and blonde curls opens the door, holding a baby in her arms and taking a step out of the house. It’s only then that her smile falters and she takes in the figure in front of her.
But this time, Sam won’t let it get that far.
Before the blonde had told them this story, Jimmy hadn’t even known that testicles could be firm enough to insert them into someone –
In between kisses, Cas managed to ask, “Do you want us?”
Cas seemed to catch on to his debate, though, because he chuckled quietly and explained, “It’s a spreader bar. An adjustable one.” The words had been whispered to prevent Dean from waking up.
The twin at his left side, which could only be Jimmy now, laughed softly and Dean turned his head to look at him while Cas started licking the sensitive skin behind his ear playfully. “I can assure you, it has nothing to do with this, Dean.”
When Cas checked, Jimmy had the same admiration written in the lines of his face as well – once again – and he stroked Dean’s thigh with the back of his hand, then said, “We want you to turn on your back now, Dean.”
“Bull.” Sam took a step forward again. “That doesn’t look like nothing to me.” It truly didn’t, because now, he didn’t just see the bruise, but also how pale Dean was and that he looked tired – in dire need of some rest.
His hole clenched around the silicone while he fucked the toy in and out of his ass and he let out another moan as the filthy squelching sound of it rang through the bedroom, filling the tense and heavy silence. Dean knew without looking that Cas and Jimmy were red-faced and stroking themselves leisurely while watching him from where they sat in front of the bed.
When Dean moaned as Jimmy finally bottomed out, the sound reverberated against Cas’ cock, massaging his shaft with his throat, and Castiel groaned in pleasure, head tilting back into the mattress. Grinning, Jimmy started to pull out, slowly setting a pace that was somewhere between slow and fast, his thrusts hard and deep, bringing them both closer to the edge.
Jimmy swallowed and admitted, “I want to put a cockring on you,” and smiled when he felt Dean’s mouth go slack just the slightest where it still brushed his ear.
Behind him, Jimmy propped up on his elbows to lean over him and meet his eyes as well, whispering, “I love you too, Dean. You’re everything and I’ll never want anyone the way I want you.”
, after what felt like ages, someone smacked their lips as if seeing something that had their mouth watering in anticipation and said, “Don’t you just look delectable, my love,” and Dean knew in an instant that it was Cas speaking. His lips twitched up in a quick smile and then Castiel and Jimmy seemed to close the rest of the space between them as he listened to soft shuffling and footfalls. A second later, a big hand grasped Dean’s chin gently and guided his head up to make him look at whoever was in front of him and he immediately knew it was Cas when he saw the fond admiration in those deep sapphire eyes and that he had no tattoos covering his upper body.
“So she had me strip out of my clothes and sat me down in that examination chair and I felt like how I imagine a girl at a gynecologist appointment would; freaking nervous. While she explained to me what was about to happen first, she took my legs and placed them on that leg holder thingy to keep them spread and I felt exposed as hell but it was also kinda nice. Then she prepared an enema and inserted it, had me sitting there with the thing for like 20 minutes while she examined my abdomen. After that, she made me do a few other tasks and asked a few questions, then started to open me up with sounds to ‘see if everything was fine with my urethra’ while I was still on that chair. I think she went with 12 millimeters in diameter before she stopped and kept it all the way inside and stretching me while she declared that she was gonna do several rectal examinations including a prostate exam now. She bent me over a table, put on gloves, and lubed up her fingers, then started fingering me open and milking my prostate. After that, she went on with her examinations and had me sit back down on the chair so that she could insert a speculum and ‘take a closer look at my ass’.
“I’m yours,” Dean panted between kisses and Cas growled, gripping him tighter.
“Then comes the prepping. Sometimes, I do it in the shower, mostly when I’m in a hurry and have to be quick, but when I want to take some time just for me,” Dean let his hands slide up Jimmy’s torso, coming to a stop on his chest where he gave his pecs a slight squeeze, “I take out my toy, cover it in lube and start opening myself up with it real slow while I’m on my knees, propped up on one hand.”
“I mean, I feel like everyone around me has their place, has someone they belong to! You and Sam have one another and I just don’t fit in!” As Dean screwed his eyes shut in defeat, a tear spilled over and ran down his freckled skin. Jessica knew that wasn’t the first one he had shed today and she didn’t know what else she could do to make him stop sinking deeper into those dangerous thoughts. “I-I just feel so alone sometimes – it’s numbing and I feel like I’m drowning. I feel like I have no one. Like I’m not meant for anyone, have no true calling. I feel like I don’t have any use in this world… What am I even here for?” When he looked at Jessica, his tears were running freely and she had to fight back her own at the sight of utter sorrow and desperation on his face.
The lack of answer told them everything they needed to know and Cas smirked, eyes dangerously low as they raked over Dean’s back down to his ass. “So, we’ve got the good old Jack Daniel’s, a very nice bourbon whiskey, a half-empty bottle of scotch, vodka, Bacardi, and whatever this thing here is…” Dean grabbed the golden bottle that Gabriel had given them as a housewarming gift and tried to read what was on its red label but ended up frowning in confusion. He reached it out, placing it in Benny’s outstretched hands, and shrugged, “I don’t have a clue.”
Castiel and Jimmy sure could call themselves lucky to have gained Dean’s trust and love.
The oil made it very easy for his hands to glide across Dean’s smooth skin and when Castiel reached the muscles in his back, he started to use kneading, rolling, and lifting strokes to achieve deeper massage penetration of the tissues. Dean’s small gasp at Cas’ fingers stroking down his sides where he was particularly ticklish made Castiel’s grin widen and he took some of the pressure out of his hands to tap his fingers along his ribs and down his sides. It had Dean squirming a bit and he groaned at being teased like that, but then Jimmy noticeably applied more pressure to his shoulders and Dean sagged back into the table again. “You know, being this ticklish always has its advantages.”
his love. “Thank you,” Dean whispered as he took in a few breaths, looking at them with honest and open eyes, “thank you for trusting me with this. Believing that I’m worthy of your love.”
For a moment, his attention was captured by Dean's cock, flushed, hard, and curving gently up towards his stomach – his wonderfully lean and soft stomach that showed just how hard and fast the blonde was breathing. But his cock, God his cock was amazing. Thick and long and there was something extremely erotic about the fact that he was cleanly shaven. All Jimmy wanted to do right then was put his mouth on it and feel just how smooth and soft his skin was. But then Dean was on him again and nothing could have kept him from making this gorgeous man his own, even if it was only for this short time.
Then he wanted to shrug but he knew for sure how they felt because they told him that much, so he nodded slightly.
“But you like it so much…” Dean mumbled, gazing at Castiel with big eyes.
Jimmy walked towards the nightstand and grabbed the bottle of water to refill the glass, then reached it out to Cas and watched as his twin took it with a thankful nod. Carefully, Castiel snaked his hand underneath Dean’s head and guided him into an upright position so that he could rest the glass against Dean’s lips and said, “Drink at least half of this, my dear.”
When he had come into the room with Jimmy and seen the submissive in his kneeling position, he had stopped dead in his tracks and barely refrained from letting out a gasp at being presented for like this. It was a sight he would forever behold in his memory and it still made him feel warm all over just thinking about the amount of respect and trust Dean had for them.
He chanced a glance at his Dom’s eyes then and almost whined at their intensity. His gaze was so fucking heated, roaming over Dean like he was everything he had ever dreamed of and it only made Dean hotter, more desperate to be good and comply, and almost needy for another orgasm. So he swallowed once, staring directly into his eyes, and assured, “Yes, Castiel.”
While Jimmy massaged his thighs and knees again to calm Dean down, Castiel rubbed and stroked Dean’s chest after he sat back on his ass and placed his boyfriend’s arms so that his hands lay palm-up at his sides. He asked Dean to lift his head and pulled away the pillow to slide underneath Dean’s head with his crossed feet and rest his head back on top of them. As soon as Dean adjusted, Cas traced the outline of his shoulders and arms, then started sliding his hands across his chest and downwards his arms to glide into his open palms and intertwine their fingers. Dean tightened his grip faintly and met Cas’ eyes from underneath his long, luxurious lashes and they smiled sweetly at each other until Castiel bent down to kiss his warm lips, enjoying their softness against his own before withdrawing his hands, stroking them along his arms, and starting to circle, rub, and pinch Dean’s nipples. Just the first and slightest touch was already enough to have them hardened and Cas smiled triumphantly as he twisted them teasingly with his thumb and index finger. Dean moaned and arched his back beautifully, especially so when Jimmy went back to stroking the skin just above his cock.
“Yeah,” he whispered and nodded eagerly, biting his bottom lip in concentration as he watched, just like Jimmy, how Castiel started to guide the toy inside. It went very slow and Jimmy felt his erection gradually coming back to life at observing this. When Jimmy concentrated on the underside of Dean’s cock, he realized that the sound was visible from the outside – Dean’s tender skin showing exactly how deep it was inside and how slowly it made its way even deeper – and it was so fucking arousing. He wanted to screw the sound open like a speculum and look inside to see what it looked like.
Of course, they’ve had vanilla sex in between, and Cas had to admit that, now that he had a taste of it, it was nice for a change, so he enjoyed that as well.
Jimmy chuckled and quipped, “Are you sure it’s not just your ass finally able to self-lubricate?” For this, he received a playful smack against his shoulder, even though Dean and Cas were laughing.
In the end, Cas gradually allowed them more and more time in between pauses to get them both closer to the edge, and once Dean’s thighs started to tremble and burn, and they were both extremely close to coming, the Dom placed his palm flat against Dean’s back and let it stay there until Dean rode them both to completion. They came almost simultaneously, Jimmy releasing his orgasm into him and marking his insides with his ejaculation, while Dean threw his head back – which almost choked him, considering his collar was still tied to his hands – and came between them in pulses.
Though, as satisfying as that spanking session felt and how aroused it had left him, it turned out to be a slight problem, actually, since he found himself hardening pretty much every time he sat down or accidentally brushed his ass against something too firmly. His boyfriends’ teasing and Castiel’s hips whenever they ‘accidentally’ bumped into him from behind weren’t much of a help either. Dean could be glad that he had been able to wear sweats that day and he thought about asking them to postpone spanking sessions to weekends only from now on. Working in jeans with his ass aflame and a raging boner going on wasn’t gonna help him make a good impression on his new employer.
And as if Dean could read his mind, he stepped away from Cas as the first refrain was over and walked over to Jimmy. His hips continued to swing to the song and he gave them a little, sexy dance before coming to stand in front of Jimmy and thrusting his pelvis into his face as the second refrain began. His clothed cock was obviously hard now, the lace stretched thin over it, and Jimmy reveled the sight of it so close to his face, wanting so much to just mouth the bulge of his erection.
“You can touch him wherever you please, Jimmy,” Castiel reminded and Jimmy nodded absentmindedly, his hands already flying to Dean’s stomach and starting to stroke the skin there before he even knew he wanted to do that. Then, Cas started to shift the Sub’s hips until his ass was hovering directly above Jimmy’s crotch, his spread and waiting hole lingering only inches above his cock.
He nodded again and asked, “Are you gonna call him?”
if that wasn’t the hottest thing Dean had ever seen him do…
“What?”
“Has no one ever fingered themselves in front of you? You’re puffing like a steam engine, geez. It’s like you have some sorta breathing condition,” he laughed slightly, laying his hand on top of his heart to feel how fast it was beating.
“How? I’m just a body. Anyone else who decided to give you two a try would know how lucky they are and do the same that I’m doing.”
For almost three hours, Cas and Jimmy had been worried sick about Dean, constantly trying to call him or waiting for a reply to their messages. Castiel barely even managed to keep his tears at bay when they had called Sam an hour ago to inform him of his brother’s lack of response. Jimmy knew he had been going through Hell, his mind making up scenarios of what could have happened. They all have. Especially the fear of Dean’s depression having gotten the best of him while they were so far away from him had them all jittery and concerned to the point where they hadn’t even had the nerves to eat breakfast.
“What do you mean?”
Castiel,” the blonde moaned, his hands clenching into fists where they were still tied to the bar.
“I didn’t think I’d ever need to explain this to you again, but I also didn’t know that this voice inside of you was this persistent, even after everything we told you yesterday… so here we go.” Taking a deep breath, Castiel said, “We don’t care, Dean. We don’t care that you slept with Michael, we haven’t cared when we hadn’t known his identity, we don’t care now that we know he’s our brother. We
“You better concentrate on your chopping, Dean. I wouldn’t want you to accidentally slice your fingers. That would be a shame…” His eyes flicked down to Dean’s hands and a second later, there was a tongue darting out and licking across his plush lips.
This never failed to make Cas weak no matter if it was in the shower, during a scene, underneath the dining table while they ate breakfast, or in the morning underneath the covers to wake them up like that. Dean’s lips always felt absolutely heavenly around his cock, this heat, and wetness, the softness of his mouth, and Castiel threw his head back with a groan as Dean suckled. But he quickly looked down on their boyfriend again to see his lips stretching around the head of his cock as he twirled his tongue around the tip to make him groan once more. His abdominals flexed with the effort of keeping his hips still as the overwhelming want to just fuck ruthlessly into the wet suction of Dean’s mouth took over his body, though Cas was everything but uncontrolled and he managed to instead bury his free hand in Dean’s wet hair – not to guide him, only to rest it there.
“I won’t let you go, Dean.”
“You like it?” Cas merely nodded enthusiastically at that and parted his hands to slide them parallel to each other from the middle of his chest to the sides, right underneath the edge of his pectoral muscles. While doing so, Castiel let his thumbs graze Dean’s nipples, which perked up immediately at the attention, and he smiled happily. His mouth watered slightly at the sight of it and he leaned down to close his lips around one pink-brownish nob, his hands holding on to Dean’s biceps. Teasingly, Castiel swiped his tongue over the nipple and smiled at the sharp breath Dean sucked in at that. He repeated the action and the sound just got more beautiful, especially so when Cas closed his teeth around it just hard enough to feel pleasurable but not enough to hurt him, because Dean shuddered and threw his head back as a long groan escaped his lips.
It was a thing they’ve been doing lately; whenever one of them left a visible mark on Dean, the other had to either create one as well or deepen the already existing one themselves, as if they could only tolerate a mark if it was their own. Which was all kinds of adorable.
When Cas spoke again, his was voice was rich with emotion and love, sounding raspy and deep, “Dean, a relationship isn’t
them – was enough to make Cas shudder audibly before Jimmy could hear the sound of slow jerking as Castiel probably started to take care of himself with his fist while watching them. Jimmy was extremely proud of the big, cocky tease that was their boyfriend and reminded himself that he should give him extra attention for that later on.
They all went back to prepare the food now but everyone listened intently when Cas said, “Growing up, Jimmy and I were best friends, we still are, but as a child, I soon realized that I didn’t need many people around me. I had my brother and that has always been enough. And since I always got nervous around other people or as soon as I was bound to talk to more than one person, I didn’t go out like others to seek friends or make connections. Jimmy, on the other hand, had a ton of friends, though he used to tell me I’d always be his best friend.” He chuckled slightly and when Dean looked at him, there was a warm smile on his lips and his voice was sincere as he continued, “It’s still the same today. I mean, I am not nervous around people anymore, but since I never learned how to socialize it happens to be a bit awkward sometimes. Jimmy always says my ‘people skills are rusty’,” he even air-quoted with his fingers and Dean grinned. “His job as a tattooist requires a certain amount of confidence and social skills and I think it helps a lot to meet so many different people through it. I only sit in an office and the only people I meet there are my boss and some colleagues, that are, by the way, not as funny as they think they are.”
Jimmy swallowed audibly, and Castiel could very much imagine how he felt. Dean was unbelievable.
“But they wouldn’t… like,” Sam looked around as if he could find the words he was searching for somewhere in their surroundings, “
So he soaked it all up as long as he could to collect enough energy for the day before he was forced to stand up and take a shower.
my ‘crush’.”
Dean’s mouth hung agape at his ministrations, fast breaths leaving his plush lips, and Jimmy leaned forward to catch his mouth in a kiss even as Castiel continued to move Dean up and down on him fast and dirty, and Jimmy kept on driving him crazy by tracing and massaging his stretched rim. Tears were starting to gather in Dean’s eyes and Jimmy knew he was close to the edge, already struggling to keep from coming, and he placed his other hand on Dean’s cheek, stroking it soothingly.
And when Dean’s body trembled underneath him before tensing as he was pushed over the edge, Cas kept going, praising him and kissing the marks he had sucked into his skin while the blonde shuddered and gasped as his release swept over him, leaving him weak and panting.
“Okay,” Cas declared softly, knee-walking into his position in front of Dean and extending his hands towards his Sub, “Lift your legs, bring them to your chest and give me your feet, Dean.”
Their boyfriend’s child-like excitement had rubbed off on Jimmy and Castiel as well and after they had gone back down to collect the last boxes filled with DVDs and other stuff from Dean’s car, brought it back upstairs, and put everything into their right places – his clothes next to theirs in the closet, his underwear in his own drawers, toys added to the ones Cas already had, photos placed on dressers, posters put up on the wall, DVDs and books stacked into the shelves surrounding the TV and whatever else they put away – the three of them had been so tired, that they took a nap together in their huge and super comfortable bed to restore some energy.
And with that, the blonde parted his lips and took Jimmy down his throat until his nose was buried in his pubic and Jimmy was groaning with pleasure. Cas knew that he was working his throat around him, massaging Jimmy’s cock with measured spasms as he reveled in the taste of his boyfriend. From where Castiel was standing, he was barely able to see the smile on Dean’s face and it was oddly hot to see him like this. Their boyfriend knew just how good he was at giving head and Dean had always been a really generous lover, which Jimmy and Castiel always tried to praise and thank him for, but he took just as much pleasure from satisfying the two as he gave them.
He lets the metal fall back against Dean’s skin and traces his fingertip down the man’s torso until he reaches the waistband of his trousers, then fiddles with the fly and unzips his pants, tugging on the fabric to pull them down Dean’s beautifully bowed legs. When they pool around the younger man’s ankles, Castiel crouches down and unlaces his combat boots just as slowly. After he finally takes off Dean’s footwear and socks, Castiel lifts his feet, one after the other, to also slide off his trousers completely.
of life, and put yourselves into precarious positions for me to make this work. Hell, who the fuck makes twins agree to a polyamorous relationship anyway? You overcame your possessiveness and hate for sharing your partner for me, Cas. You had to change so many things in your life to make this work and you, Jimmy, changed your freaking way to live. I mean, you’re in a BDSM relationship and learning to be a Dom just so
“Good.” It was really nice to hear, especially since Jimmy hadn’t heard of a device called cilice before and had found it a bit intimidating considering its origin. Though he knew he could trust his twin with stuff like that because he’d never hurt Dean, it was truly relieving to hear that their boyfriend liked it. And as long as one of them didn’t come home with barbed wire, Jimmy was fairly open to new toys, accessories, and devices.
“No excuse!” Dean grunted and went silent again after that. Sam used this as his opportunity to finish the last sentence and save the draft – he’d come back to it after Christmas Eve to read it over. After that, he closed his laptop with a soft click and put it onto the coffee table with a content sigh, propping both his arms up on the sofa behind him. One of his hands rested at Dean’s elbow, the other next to his brother’s hip. Sam’s lower back touched Dean’s side, his hipbone poking into his rear. It was suddenly so quiet in the room, that Sam could hear noises of the outside world through the open spare room window, which were accompanied by Dean’s slow and steady breathing.
After they had all calmed down again, each of them grabbed a box from the trunk – Jimmy took two – and led Dean to their new home. Jimmy had never been this excited about seeing someone’s expression but the way Dean’s face had lit up like a child’s at Christmas or New Year’s Eve as soon as they stepped inside and saw their new panorama view in the living space, was everything to Jimmy. That sight had even made him forget about what had happened to their boyfriend two nights ago and he could enjoy showing Dean around.
A moment later, his head is engulfed by hot wetness and suction that is undoing him, all the while Dean swirls his tongue around it, slicking it up. Slowly, Dean begins to lower his head onto Castiel, taking more and more of him into his mouth and coating his cock with his saliva. Castiel has to clench the old bedsheets in his hands to stop himself from pounding Dean’s mouth – since it’s his first time with a man, he has to be good with him to avoid shying him away, ruining his experience. When he pulls off, it is done with a wet plopping sound and Castiel’s cock slaps against his belly lazily.

Like that – skin glowing beautifully in the low light, freckles prominent, and body arched in an enticing way – Dean looked like a god. He was the epitome of stunning; someone so gorgeous and effortlessly beautiful, that everyone would do anything to call them theirs, and Jimmy and Cas had somehow gotten lucky enough to actually be allowed to do that. Call him theirs.
Quietly, and as honest as Cas could be, he answered, “I don’t know.”
Dean’s words, however soft they were spoken, had formed a lump in Castiel’s throat and he swallowed once, thickly, as his emotions threatened to overwhelm him once more. It was sad to hear that Dean’s brain still tried to play such games with him and that it seemed more likely to Dean that they were a part of his dreams, his imagination, rather than reality based on the fact that they were too good for him. They had tried to show him every day how precious and loved he was, how worthy of love he was, but it still didn’t settle in his brain and it was something that made Cas want to cry whenever he thought about it.
“Oh, you did…” When Dean opened his mouth to argue again, Castiel cocked a brow at him and shot him a heated glare. This had Dean’s lips snapping together and a slight blush creeping up to his cheeks, which made Cas smirk triumphantly. He gave another lazy thrust inside Dean, reminding him of their connection, and the blonde gasped, his eyelids fluttering and body stiffening.
And like a miracle, Dean closed his eyes and Cas gave Jimmy a grateful look before saying, “Remember that night when I called you and you were having a panic attack just like this one?” A nod. “I told you a story about myself, do you remember it?” Another nod. “It was something I never told anyone before and I told it to you because I trusted you. But also because I was ready to tell you, Dean.” As Castiel talked, Dean’s distress decreased steadily and he pressed a firm kiss to the center of his forehead. “Please know that you can tell us whenever
Dean lifted his gaze to look at Jimmy, smiling mischievously as he rasped, “Blowing you always turns me on… can’t wait to taste your cum.”
They were desperate while kissing and soon realized that they won’t be getting far if they kept this up like that, so they stopped kissing long enough to frantically and quickly divest themselves of clothing. And since Jimmy had to only pull down his sweats because he hadn’t been wearing anything else and was now very much naked, he allowed himself a moment to merely watch Dean strip down as well, unlacing his shoes hectically and tugging them off along with his jeans. His shirt was already gone, vacated on the floor where all their other clothes were scattered across, and the only item left on him were his boxers, which he wasted no time on pulling them down and throwing them away.
“First time I fell in love with a girl named Cassie, I was so freaked out, that I didn’t act on it or tried anything with her. Guess I was just already so fucked up that I didn’t want another responsibility in my life or another person I could fail.” The room was completely silent whenever Dean paused his story and Castiel was struggling to hold back his emotions at the things he told them. This was going to be worse than he thought.
Perplexed, Jimmy wrapped his other arm around Dean’s back, its hand resting on the curve of his ass, and took a moment to sort through his thoughts. Did Dean really just admit that he wouldn’t mind if Jimmy took him while he was asleep? “Are you serious?”
Kneeling down beside him, Cas gently placed a hand on the back of Dean’s neck, who went completely pliant as he felt the touch, his whole spine seeming to loosen, and said, “For disobeying the order and drinking without permission, you’ll be getting punished now. Afterward, you’re forgiven and this topic is over. If you still want to talk about why you got into a fight and asked Sam to help you, not us, then you may as you please. But this is not a part of the punishment, Dean, because those things have not broken any rule.”
Next to him, Jessica, Sam, and Cas began to place down their things as well, so Jimmy followed suit and crouched to open the pack of firewood and put enough of it in the middle of the fireplace to prepare the campfire. For a moment, he was concentrating on arranging the wood and once it looked good enough, he stood again and straightened. When he looked up, Dean was already gone but it only took a second for him to find the blonde standing by the water, his shoes and socks discarded in the sand.
Perplexed, Jimmy followed them into the room and watched Dean fill the tub with water before turning back to Castiel and starting to lift the shirt off above his head. He stripped Cas down completely as well and turned off the faucet when he thought the tub was filled enough, and Cas and Jimmy could only stare at Dean.
“I think that’s sweet,” Cas said, leaning into Dean’s side to press their shoulders together and looking at the pair next to them. “What was your first crush?”
It had been a lot of paperwork and Castiel understood that Dean was tired and maybe even still shaken from what had just transpired at the club and retelling those awful experiences. Not to mention that Dean just found out his abusive ex-Dom was their brother. Castiel couldn’t imagine what that must feel like but he knew that he was more than just disgusted by Michael. Merely thinking about the man made him want to punch something, but he clenched his hands into fists at his sides and tried to tame in his anger. It was not his place to be mad, after all.
If Castiel would’ve opened his mouth just now, they’d been able to hear the way Dean made him howl with the way he slammed his body down on his dick and dragged his tight channel up again, probably making sure to clench extra hard all the way up if Cas had to guess. He knew Dean far too well, after all. And he also knew that Dean’s thighs were already starting to burn and that he’d feel today’s sex in his knees the next morning still, and the thought plastered a fat grin on Castiel’s lips because he loved when their boyfriend still felt it the day after and was inevitably reminded of the sex they had.
Once they had been done with their tour around, Dean couldn’t stop complimenting them and saying how “fucking awesome” this all was. He had told them that this place was the nicest thing he’d ever seen and had asked more than a dozen times if they could really effort this all since he felt like some rich guy moving into his new luxurious loft. But Jimmy and Cas had told him about the rental costs for it, even though Dean didn’t seem to believe them, and assured that it was still in their price range, even if it seemed otherwise. They had, to be perfectly honest, made a freaking awesome deal with this place because they would never find something this nice for the same price again.
Snuggling closer to Dean’s side, Jimmy asked, “Have you dominated before? I mean, not like today, that was freaking fantastic and I’m sure that wasn’t your first time, but like… truly?”
While he was lost in his thoughts, starting to understand his reactions, he could feel Dean tracing the skin of his left hip, drawing patterns into it with his fingers.
“Why the hell would you call it that?”
Castiel ignores the jab of pain in his gut and whispers: “yeah…”, then blinks away fresh tears. “H-he wanted me to tell you something, Sam.” He takes a shaky breath and continues: “Before he died, D-Dean wanted me to tell you… ‘he’s found the one’.”
Swallowing around the lump in his throat, Jimmy argued, “But he was crying, Cas. And this time it wasn’t because we spent hours taking him apart, or because of anticipation or the need to be touched, to come. It wrecked his whole body and I saw what it did to him, how much pain it caused him every time your brutal hit landed on his abused flesh! That was just cruel…”
? “You’re everything to me, Dean,” Cas rasped, his breathing picking up and voice sounding strangled, and Dean didn’t know if it were all these emotions or his impending orgasm that made him sound like that but he didn’t care either.
In a quiet and calm voice, the blonde answered, “Yes, Sir.”
Breakfast was spent in companionable silence, except for the occasional comment at how good it tasted or how beautiful the location was until Castiel finished his red smoothie and said, “I have something planned for today.”
Even the way people looked at them – either curiously or suspiciously – couldn’t quell the man’s excitement, and it was truly heartwarming.
The submissive was suspended in front of him, his eyes closed as he reveled in the bliss of being suspended and his legs apart to make room for Jimmy’s body. They’d chosen a vertical position to make it easier for all of them, but that didn’t mean the position wasn’t a hard one. In fact, only Dean’s arms and legs were holding his weight, a rope on either of his arms, which Dean was holding on to with his hands, and another two ropes secured on either of his legs, keeping him vertical and in a sort of sitting position, only in the air. If they weren’t careful enough, or even if Dean merely made a wrong or jostling move, they could easily dislocate one of Dean’s shoulders and Jimmy couldn’t put into words how mesmerizing the view was.
They spent the rest of the time talking and started preparing dinner after a while. Dean was happy to be able to help and it turned out to be a delicious casserole. Afterward, he insisted that he clean the dishes and Jessica helped him dry them off while Sam searched some streaming platforms for a good movie. He ended up choosing a thriller that they watched while sharing a bowl of popcorn and Dean felt more at home here than he ever had at his place in Lawrence. It felt domestic and somehow, he had missed this. Dean barely spent any time at his place and when he did, the silence threatened to deafen him. Sometimes it felt so oppressive, that he had to leave.
Tears started leaking out of Dean’s eyes as it took some more rubbing, fucking, and coaxing until he sobbed once, loudly, and came again. He didn’t ejaculate as much as he had before and his orgasm wasn’t very long but probably no less intense than the first two and it still left him panting and spasming around Jimmy, who leaned over Dean and pressed a soothing kiss to his lips as he neared his own climax.
“What?” Dean stared at him with big, surprised eyes, then screwed his brows together in thought, as if pondering if he really did or did not have children, and started laughing all of a sudden. “No!” It was loud and joyous and if other people were staring, Jimmy didn’t care. “No, no. God, no. No children. I promise. My car, it’s a ‘67 Chevy Impala and I call her Baby. She’s been in the family for decades and I got her from dad.” He started munching his fry with a chuckle while Jimmy laughed at his burst of shock. “Have been keeping her in perfect condition ever since.”
He felt the bed dip beneath them as Dean shrugged, saying, “Well, I didn’t have to until I was home again.” Turning his head to look at Jimmy, Dean mused, “You should know by now that I can hold my bladder pretty long if I wanna.”
Dean’s nervous shifting pulled him out of his thoughts and he took a step closer to bend down over the bed so that his mouth was near his Sub’s face, swallowing once before lowering his voice and saying, “You’ll have to stay quiet now, sweetheart, unless you want them to get tighter.” A shiver ran through Dean at his voice being so close and the blonde let out a soft sigh, nodding once. Of course, if this wasn’t about making Dean feel good, Cas would have never wanted him to be quiet or hold back with his reactions because those sweet noises and responses were like a boost of energy to Castiel. But since their boyfriend had quietly requested more orders and discipline in scenes recently, and Cas wanted to give him what he wanted and needed, he just complied. And even though he truly lamented the loss of Dean’s eyes and that he had to punish him for showing that he enjoyed himself like this, it was worth it in the end because they all truly loved today’s scene.
It was freaking hot that day. So much so that Dean had been relieved to hear Cas tell him to strip down entirely. Wearing clothes on such a hot day just wasn’t Dean’s thing and he loved the feeling of the occasional soft breeze coming from the beach grazing his skin. Hearing the sound of soft waves breaking and lapping at the shore was extremely relaxing and if Cas wouldn’t have reminded him of the little punishment awaiting him soon, Dean would’ve surely dozed off by now.
Nodding once, Cas asked, “Do you want to continue as planned after your break, or do you think this is too much?”
Castiel considered if he should tell Jimmy about Dean. Perhaps he would be helpful in this situation… Letting go of a long sigh, Cas admitted, “His name is Dean and I met him at the Christmas party of our firm.”
The blonde took a hesitant step into the apartment before walking inside entirely and taking a look around. His hands were stuffed into the pockets of his leather jacket, his shoulders were tense, and he looked more uncomfortable than Jimmy had ever seen him. Closing the door, he turned around and watched Dean for a moment, wondering what had happened to make him so uneasy. “You want to take off your jacket? This thing must be heavy.”
“Whatever you need.” And like that, the blonde just let himself be held by Jimmy, curling against his body and closing his eyes with the side of his head resting on his shoulder while warm water still rained down on them, and gave Jimmy some time to sort out his thoughts.
“I mean,” Cas said, taking a step forward and placing his hand on Jimmy’s shoulder carefully, as if expecting him to slap it away, “when we were still downstairs and I calmed Dean down, he asked if you were okay. And when I asked him as to why he wanted to know that, Dean said he was worried you might experience a drop of sorts.”
Their chests were heaving and when Castiel got a glimpse of Dean’s eyes, he could see his pupils swallowing the green. Before he let go of Dean’s bottom lip, Castiel nibbled it playfully. It filled him with satisfaction when it snapped back into place and Castiel gazed upon spit-slick and kiss-swollen lips. Dean’s cheeks were a deep shade of red now and they matched his shiny, dark red mouth, bringing his freckles to stand out and making them even more prominent on his skin.
And maybe Dean really did have a kink for being filled with sperm – breeding was after all on his list – or he’d just been seconds away from his own release, but as Cas came deep inside of him, Dean almost slumped forward with the relief of his orgasm, his cock jumping as it spurted robes of cum onto Cas’ stomach.
