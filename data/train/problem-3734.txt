"Yeah we're doing peachy here, how's the kid" Dean pondered.
"The universe really does has a sick sense of humour doesn't it sometimes" Dean murmured to himself.
"Actually kid your staying here with Sam" Dean corrected him as he went into full Dad mode.
"The ghoul boys are having some brewskies tonight bay-bee!" Shane excitedly announced.
"I'm sorry for laughing but Dick pointer! What an unfortunate name, poor dude" Shane wheezed wiping a tear from his eye.
"Mike soup" Jack announced proudly.
"Get spraying Bansky" Dean smirked, as he started graffitiing sigils around the manor.
"Well what?" Dean echoed.
"Hold up isn't that kinda... racist?" Ryan raised his eyebrows accusingly towards the seraph.
A few devil's traps under some well placed rugs and under every bed in the house.
It will not be any different
"Your very welcome" Cass smiled weakly. Lately he had felt useless at times as his powers weren't what they used to be. He supposed that's what happens when you get resurrected over and over again. He was glad he could still heal to some capacity, it made him feel like he was doing good in a world so overrun with evil. No it made him feel like he was good, something he grappled with a lot since he rebelled against heaven all those years ago.
"Yeah, yeah keep telling yourself that" Shane replied.
"And he's an angel?" Ryan asked skeptically. "I'm sorry but yeah I get ghosts and demons, there's evidence on film of that but Angels? I think you guys are joshing me now" Ryan folded his arms defensively.
Team free will then watched a handful of other episodes and concluded that this wasn't any normal bogus supernatural investigation show, this was legit. Things were happening on screen that couldn't be explained away by coincidence or the wind. It was a case. Everywhere these men go something weird happens. Maybe the ghost hunters were being haunted by a wandering spirt attached to a something they took from one of the haunted locations? They didn't know really but they sure as hell were gonna find out what was going on with this unsolved show.
"You have good taste in music Dean" Cass replied "and besides its the only gift I've ever received. It's special to me" The Angel seemed to go a little pink after saying that. Apparently it doesn't take a lot to make a Seraph blush.
"Bye Dean" Sam replied.
"Yeah pretty much except we got no vacuum cleaners on our backs" Dean smirked. "Anyway we should probably actually do some busting and get those spirts out of here"
"Do you know how hard it is being a demon with a moral compass?" Shane complained.
"Alright" Cass agreed, it was the best strategy they had and they didn't have many other options to choose from in the first place.
"That's your problem not mine pal, what's yours is mine su casa mi casa" Lucifer grinned to himself.
"Speaking off people involved" Ryan shot Shane a heavy look "Does Sara know what you are"
"I somehow doubt it bucko" The demon argued with him.
"You mean it?" Shanes eyes lit up.
Shane looked totally petrified, but Dean trusted Castiel's judgement to give the dude the demon test.
"Seems pretty small fries to me? Don't you Winchesters usually deal will more taxing problems like I dunno the apocalypse?" The demon shrugged.
"Listen here smartass, you're not driving my car now or ever! Understand?" Dean practically growled at Shane.
"You guys don't really work here do you?" The ghost hunter concluded.
"It totally does, ya know that one juice?" He said as he pulled the song up on his phone and played the clip for them.
"This is the height of luxury" Castiel announced sarcastically.
"Alright then, Cass you're gonna have to show Mister Holliday the gun show" Dean asked the Angel to prove his divine nature to Doc.
"Yeah I get that it's a spook fest here, no place to raise a child" Ryan shuddered at the though of living in a haunted house, even a nice big mansion like the Lemp mansion.
Heaven is a place
[Ryan] Because I know whats underneath it.
"I swear, if that fucking thing says Beetlejuice I'm leaving" Ryan looked nervously at the little box.
"I'm on it" Sam was already on a web page of leaked information about the new season of the show. "So get this. They're filming new episodes of the show and one of the locations is the Lemp Mansion in St. Louis Missouri. Seems like their filming there tonight. It's not too far, we can drive out there and talk with those guys and warn them that their in danger." Sam
"I didn't mean that, I just thought you'd want to keep an eye on Ryan and Shane" Castiel made himself clear.
Dean had to come between them to drag Ryan off of him. The guy had a mean left hook for the size of him, but then again look at those biceps. He obviously lifts Dean thought to himself.
"Well they won't be bothering anybody no more, the Lemp's got the good old season et flambé" Shane announced smugly.
"Yeah well how does that moral backbone of yours feel about busting open a grave?" Dean asked him.
"You sure can. Could we get two double whiskeys?" Dean requested politely.
"Beezelbub" He stated flatly.
"Mike soup?" Dean's face scrunched up at the ridiculous name of the Guinea pig.
"Heaven is a place where nothing ever happens" Cass recited the songs chorus.
"Ever had Lucifer and Chuck having a Doctor Phil session in your front room when you just wanna go to fucking sleep" Dean asked Shane.
"Was that a hello? Hello? Elsa Lemp are you speaking with us?" Ryan
Play it one more time
"You're back!" he said elated.
"A very religious upbringing" Castiel added exhaustedly, remembering the "fun" times he had spent in the silver city with his brothers and sisters.
"Sorry guys when nature calls am I right?" Ryan laughed nervously.
Could be so exciting
"Why do I stuck with a wussy demon" Dean grumbled.
"Ryan I'm not a ghoul. They're a whole other kettle of fish I don't eat people!" The demon argued.
"Not in this car pal and talk about an age gap. How about you hang out with people your own age" Dean judged him and shot them a little bit of side-eye, while still keeping his eyes on the road ahead.
"You think this is funny" The angel barked back at him.
"I know what a Guinea pig is Jack and they were messing with you buddy" Dean assured him.
As Ryan flicked on the spirt box, both Shane and Cass winced at the racket it was producing. The noise of the spirt box was annoying enough for humans, but fir Angels and demons that thing was torturous.
[shane] Nighttime, darkness?
Ryan held out his bottle and urged the others to 'cheers' with him, to which they obliged. "All hail the watcher I guess" He smiled before tasting the product.
"Do you mind if we listen to this instead?" Cass asked knowing that of course no objections would be had with playing Dean's favourite band.
Ryan shushed his co-host "Shut up man!"
The hunter was at his wits end with them at that point.
"Oh Jack? I'll let him tell you himself" you could hear Sam smiling through the phone as he passed the phone onto Jack.
Dean started up the ignition and headed towards the cemetery, as his Zepp mixtape played loudly.
"You think you're quite the comedian don't you?" Shane tone getting serious "You don't know what it was like for me! Youngest of the princes, having to live up to my sister and brothers tyranny. Who would want that? Not me bucko. I did my share of bad in the past I'm not denying it. We all do some crazy shit when we're drunk! I'm just saying I'm trying to make up for it all" Shane looked down at the ground pensively.
"This week on buzzfeed unsolved we are at the historical Lemp mansion in St. Louis, as part of our ongoing investigation into the question, are ghosts real?" Ryan stated.
"Hey guys the karaoke night hasn't started yet it's barely even the afternoon!" He slurred his words as he got closer to the leader of the group.
"Look I just don't want my five hours sleep to get interrupted from the kid having nightmares alright"  Dean admitted tiredly.
"About ten years ago" Castiel reminisced.
Dean looked panicked as the blood visibly drained from his face. "Dude gross" He gagged.
With that, Shane lunged forward and grabbed the spirt box and smashed it against the floor.
"Oh yeah?" Dean said, eyes feeling heavy already from driving for such a long period of time.
"Like I said I retired. Well I guess it was more of a disownment come to think of it" Shane admitted to them.
"If anything goes south we'll let you know Sammy" Dean said to his younger brother as he headed out the door with Castiel ready to embark on another case.
"No look man I don't think you do get it" Ryan argued as he started to become irate. "Tonight I came in here with my best friend ready to do another shoot and tomorrow I'm gonna be leaving with someone totally new and a bunch of footage I have to say is corrupted so the world doesn't implode" Ryan finished his rant with a deep sigh.
Charles Lemp had Cass grabbed by the tie and was cutting off his breathing accusing them of breaking into his house and Elsa Lemp was shouting at Dean, confusing him with her ex husband.
"Great, leave me to break that to him" Dean huffed.
"Okay I think you're onto something kid" Dean sighed tired from working the vamps nest case. He didn't think he'd be back in the saddle quite so soon after wrapping the last case up. He wasn't getting any younger that's for sure. All he wanted was to have a shower and go to sleep, but when duty calls he had to answer.
"Yeah yeah, I've heard it all before" Shane said rolling his eyes.
"Oh sweet Lord" John Henry murmured as he blessed himself, stunned by what he saw before his eyes.
"Well you know the truth and your taking it swimmingly" Shane shot back sarcastically.
"Look pal, I'm here to do my show with my friend. I don't want any trouble" Shane said sounding irritated.
"Well that's swell Mister Holliday sir, but our problem isn't really what you'd call a normal one" Dean rubbed the back of his neck in stress, just thinking about the messed up situation they had got themselves wrapped up in yet again with this new apocalypse.
After some thought Dean confidently answered "On a beach somewhere, in Hawaiian shirts drinking strong booze from a coconut" He smiled thinking about the sun beating down on him and his Angel, not a care in the world. Just taking in the scenery, no apocalypse to avert just them together. Now that would be nice.
"Of course not" Dean said glad he found a way to avoid using the phrase "Driver picks the music, shotgun shuts his cakehole" and still get to listen to his favourite tunes.
"I'm an angel and I've done bad things" Guilt filled his eyes. "We aren't defied by what we are but who we choose to be" Cass still didn't know what Shane's intentions were with Ryan, but he had indeed kept him out of harms way thus far and that fact accounted for something.
"Yeah just a few vampires nothing we can't handle" Sam yawned as he plonked into the chair next to Jack exhausted.
"Approximately" Cass added to try break the awkward silence, rubbing the back of his neck tensely as a tinge of embarrassment took hold of them.
Dean looked at Cass and instantly knew shit was about to hit the fan. Castiel had his game face on and Dean had every right to be worried, even if he didn't know why yet.
The hatted owner tried to get Dean to return to his seat at the bar out of harms way, seemingly not realising Dean's natural talent for acting. He had pretended to be straight for how many years so his acting was nearly at the level of Leonardo DiCaprio at this stage of his life in his own humble opinion. "Sir this is between me and this fellow you'd best sit down son and leave my problems to me" They pleaded with him.
"Saving people, dismantling tourist traps, the family business" Cass smirked back at them.
"What in the tarnation" Doc uttered in shock of what had just happened.
They were interrupted by the sound of the Mansion's droning doorbell being rung."That's them now" Dean stated as they made their way to the front entrance.
"Oh here we go, it's show time" Lucifer stretched his arms out and prepared to lower his voice around three octaves to achieve that correct level of angelic constipation that Cass's normal speaking voice has.
"Laugh it up Sammy, cause your theory is wrong. The cameraman he's clean" The elder hunter told him.
"What's so little about my narratating voice?" Ryan asked offended with Shane's word choice.
Ahhh the unsolved boys noised in unison.
Ryan sighed "I always thought he was a little weird but he's not demon weird. Actually fuck it makes sense. No sane guy thinks it's a good idea to call a demon a pussy unless they are one".
"You call God Chuck?" Shane laughed hysterically at the absurd notion.
"You don't think I'm pretty?" Cass looked visibly upset.
"As much as I'd like to look at pictures of cute animals all night we've gotta continue the shoot guys" Ryan said.
Shane sighed, Ryan's safety was top priority in his book. "Okay okay, fine but how about some better tunes up in here".
"Yeah the cameraman, how did you know?" the younger Winchester asked bewildered.
Cass shot the demon a death stare and Dean knew he had to intervene to avoid bloodshed.
"Watch you damn mouth" Cass's blood was beginning to boil with anger.
Jack happily greeted his three father figures as they entered the room.
A place where nothing
"Don't hold your breath I much prefer this vessel than my last" Cas said as they recalled the amount of annoyance they faced when they sported a female vessel back in 1901. He didn't particularly feel like being in another female visage for the foreseeable future when bras existed. What torturous devices, they were clearly an output of Hell.
"Okay John Mulaney, dial it back a bit on the snark" Dean tried not to laugh at the Seraph's  unintentional reference to the stand up comedian.
"Ditto" Dean agreed begrudgingly with the demon. A stiff drink would make this weird night a bit more bearable for the functioning alcoholic.
They play my favorite song
"Sorry?" Sam was genuinely confused.
"It's party time boys" Shane said rubbing his hands together.
Dean began to worry that Cass had just started a fight with an unassuming internet personality but he waited it out to see if the Angel's theory was right. Whatever that theory was.
The four made their way down the long, winding tunnel until the reached the brewery where they were greeted by the complimentary Lemp brand beers.
"I'm sorry" Casifer pulled that confused puppy head tilt Cass so often does.
"Ah yes Val Kilmer portrayed them, in the film with the guns and tuberculosis" Cass recalled this particular movie night extremely well because Dean cried (a lot) when Holliday died in the end, a rare sight in the bunker.
"She feels connected to you because you bore the mark Dean" The archangel assessed the situation.
Dean made his way through the winding hallways of the Lemp mansion, towards the front door. This whole thing was far from what the hunter was used to hunts being like. Usually he'd give the whole 'the paranormal is real' talk after some clueless schmuck was almost killed by some monster. The fact that this demon was all buddy-buddy with this guy Ryan and was actually protecting him made Dean very wary of the guy. He must have some shitty reason to do so, right? Nice demons don't exist and that was a fact he was sure of. Dean had found that out the hard way, by trusting one and having it bite him in the ass.He walked out into the yard, towards the impala to see Beezelbub inspecting every inch of the vehicle. Oh great Dean sighed to himself, here we go again.
"Same here" The hunter shot back.
"I'm gonna set up the static cams in the bedrooms. Shane you do the same here. That is if you can find it in you to be interested enough" Ryan stormed up the stairs carrying two bags of camera gear.
"Would you believe me if I were to tell you I have a rare form of eye jaundice?" The demon asked him.
"What an old married couple, heck and we should know" Dean whispered to Cass as they lagged behind the two ghost hunters to talk privately.
"My apopgises" Cass replied, not sounding very sincere and was that a smile draped across his face?
Ryan silently shook his head.
"Deadly serious" Shane added, nodding confirming his curiosity.
"How does a retired demon know about us might I ask" Castiel queryied.
"Don't confuse the audience man, bringing a true crime bit into a supernatural season yeash!" Shane sighed.
"I'm serious, there is" Ryan confirmed the presence of the brewery.
Castiel, Dean and Beezelbub's banter was cut short by the sound of Ryan re-entering the mansion.
"Oh sure Dean, go on be a racist that's totally chill of you" Shane rolled his eyes.
"Whatever man, you just don't want me to get concrete evidence of the paranormal" Ryan  concluded, without knowing how truthful this statement actually was.
"Wow it seems like you guys have known each other forever" The ghost hunter stated.
"Dean we're professionals, on a case" Castiel blushed.
"I don't think that was a hello Ryan" Shane began to say.
"The ghost of the very much still alive Lizzo, would not haunt the Lemp Mansion Shane" Ryan rolled his eyes.
Dean staggered over to when the barman and demons were, as he sloppily slurped from the glass to try get the demons have their guard down. What harm could a drunken mess like him do to those big strong demons right? A lot of harm actually...
"He means salt and burn, we torched them" Dean explained to the ghost hunter. "They won't be pinning anymore youtubers up against walls now" They assured them.
"Enough! All the princes of hell are dead how is this possible" Castiel interrupted, before Dean lost his cool and tried to beat the demon to a pulp.
Cass hadn't said a word since Ryan arrived and he looked for quite lack of a better word "constipated" to Dean.
"You don't understand Dean, all that is meaningless. It's here on Earth where things have true meaning. Here there's loyalty and friendship"
"You can say that again" Ryan added.
"Yeah, a dead ladies bedroom dingus" His co-host said, justifying his own discomfort.
Ryan nodded, eyes wide like a deer in headlights.
Heaven
"Well..." Shane started.
"Bad Angels are more common than you'd expect unfortunately" Cass said heavily, remembering Metatron, Naomi and the countless other brothers and sisters that had wronged him and the people he called his real family over the years.
"Yeah keep telling yourself that man if it helps you sleep at night" The demon responded.
The bar is called heaven
"Dean contain yourself your unsettling the man" Castiel pleaded with his partner to get a grip.
"How about Shane, can you say his name for us?" Ryan politely requested.
"Oh yeah, how's that" Dean demanded to hear what the demon had heard about him and Cass.
"Okay Doctor Phil we get it" Dean thanked him for the effort.
"No, but you could have acted natural and not like a crazy person!" Dean shouted back.
"Cry me a river pal" Dean rolled his eyes so hard, they might have got stuck in the back of his head if it had been windy in the cemetery.
"I will Dean" Jack promised as he handed the phone back to Sam to go and watch Mike soup eat tiny bits of cucumber in his cage.
Dean gave Sam a look to try and get him to placate Jack with some incentive to want to stay in the bunker out of potential harms way.
"Oh my god I can't believe you right now. You're the Angel of Thursday but you can't remember what we do on a Thursday?" That's so ironic" Dean was definitely starting to fly off the handle.
"He really got a Guinea pig?" Cass turned to Dean.
"No really tying the knot that's a big moment in someone's life, so when we are we gonna hear the pitter patter of Nephilim feet? Sure you'd have to change to a female vessel but I'm sure Dean wouldn't mind my bi-dar is dinging" The Devil remarked.
Dean signalled for Cass to release Shane from his compromised position pinned against the wall.
"Oh boy" Dean sighed down the line.
"I'm joking" Shane laughed heartily "You should see your face right now its priceless. He's fine, now I promise. I just roughed him up a bit and told him to quit the show and then offered to fill in for him!" The demon smiled.
"This isn't good Dean" Cass said flatly.
The echoing of "Cass!" could be heard throughout the halls of the bunker as the hunter searched for the Angel.
"Is this you being pissy because Amara kissed me? Your aunt is a bit of a cougar sure but look I already told you she means nothing to me! It's that stupid mark Cain crap, it's like a goddamn tramp stamp" He threw the suit jacket he had been carrying in his arms onto the chair at the war room table.
"Not for long, I doubt she would willingly date a demon" Ryan retorted.
"Ryan, you can't tell her are you crazy" His co-host had fear in his eyes.
"What do you expect them to do Dean?" Cass squeeked as he got redder and redder, the more the ghost restrained him.
After Dean and Castiel said their goodbyes to Jack and Sam they made their way to the impala. The hunter loaded up the trunk with some extra gear from the bunker just to be safe. You never know what could happen on a hunt, expect the unexpected he always said.
"Well yes, but the whole unsolved fans as a whole are called ghouligans. Anyways there's also shitfish but I don't want to bring them into this" Shane murmured, trying not to talk about the shitfish.
"Why what happened" Shane asked.
Just then, the Devils binge watching session was interrupted by the clanking of the heavy metal door of the bunker, signalling the return of Castiel's favourite hunter back home.
"I was a big time skeptic all my life until I was seventeen. My friends and I went to that ship back in Cali, the Queen Mary. Supposed to be hella haunted. Anyway, I thought it was a load of shit. So when we rocked up, I taunted the ghosts thinking it was all a bunch of baloney. Later that night I was repeated poked in the face when I was in bed, but I was too scared to open my eyes. When I finally did to confront my friend who I thought was doing it, I saw he was fast asleep. Then the next morning my fucking toothpaste bag moved all on its own! There's no other explanation, it had to have been a ghost" Ryan concluded.
"I'm always careful Cass" The hunter assured him.
"Relax I'll get to auntie Amara baby bro don't worry yourself, I'm just weighing up my pros and for now I might as well play catch up as to what you bozos were up to in my absence" He chided the seraph. "This is more entertaining than the Kardashians" Lucifer added as he threw a handful of popcorn into his mouth.
"Or if you just keep prying, fine" Shane sighed, knowing the Angel wasn't throwing around false threats. "Beezelbub alright, they called me Beezelbub" he admitted reluctantly.
"I was thinking that was fast damn dude! Giving Bolt a run for his money huh?" Ryan jokingly hit his  friends shoulder.
"You sure about that" The hunter gave them a skeptical look. Dean knew a rat when he saw one and Shane was as a YouTube comment he had seen said 'sexy in a rat way". Not that Dean had the hots for him or anything he was spoken for of course, but he saw the rodent-ness the comment spoke of.
_____________________________________________________________________
"Hey guys, how about we grab some cams for y'all it can't be that hard" Dean offered as wanted to keep an eye on the demon, and this was the best way to do so.
“I...wanted to see you,” he hedged, realizing far too late that in his hurry to move his plan forward he had neglected to prepare anything to say.
The pain in her hand returned full force, and Anna screamed. The amulet fell to the floor as she stumbled away blindly. She heard Hael’s voice calling out for her, accompanied now by the soft but strong voice of Inias, who ordered her to hold out her hand to him so he could tend to the wound. Anna opened her eyes and chanced a bleary look at her damaged hand. Her entire palm was blistered and cracked and angry red, and in the center where the amulet had been the skin was burned away completely, leaving a deep hole that was filled with burned blood. Anna was sure that the muscles in her hand would be visible when the wound was clean. She choked back bile and screwed her eyes shut again as Inias dragged a cold wet cloth over her palm, the conflicting sensations of pleasant cool and far too much pressure against tender skin jarring her. She sighed in relief and allowed her shoulders to relax only when she felt cold anesthetic balm being applied, followed immediately by thick cotton bandages. Hael spoke next to her, shaky, but gentle.
against his own and Castiel revelled in it, holding him close as though he might vanish and leave Castiel cold, as the many imaginary counterparts that visited Castiel’s dreams often were wont to do. He felt the rumble of Dean’s chuckle against his lips as he mouthed at the crest over his heart and, feeling disinclined to fully part from the marvelous form beneath him, settled instead for dragging his mouth across Dean’s torso, licking and kissing at will whenever the urge struck him.
“No, not at all!” she assured him in a rush, “The Queen has been extremely generous in helping me. Only…” She bit her lip, looking faintly guilty. “Well, it seems there is always another decision to be made. Just when I think I’ve been shown every color of napkin under the sun, someone turns up with a new one for me to consider.” She gave a small laugh and shook her head. “I shouldn’t complain; everyone has been perfectly kind and accommodating. I suppose I’m just a little worn out.”
Anna opened her eyes and lessened her grip on Castiel. With a heavy heart, she handed him back to Naomi, who looked worried.
He never appeared to Dean again, but he lingered and watched him on occasion. On especially stormy nights Dean could have sworn that the wind sounded like howls of despair.
Castiel nodded, bringing his hand over his sternum, where the pendant hung safely behind his chest plate. He hadn’t thought to mention to Hannah how he had known which way to travel, but he supposed there was no immediate need to. The amulet was significantly warmer than it had been before Hannah reached him, so they were still headed in the right direction. The lake would be at best another step closer to Dean and at worst a chance to bathe and wash his clothes, and Castiel was eager to do both.
“Oh.” That wasn’t what he’d been expecting. But, that definitely wasn’t Dean’s fault either. “That was his doing, not yours. No need to apologize. I am sorry if seeing him do that made you uncomfortable. If you wish, I will forget it happened.” Denial was Dean’s defense mechanism, and while it wasn’t very healthy, Castiel figured Dean deserved peace in whatever way he could find it. If Dean wanted him to forget it, then he would.
"What are you doing here Gabriel?" he said, once Gabriel had released him.
Gabriel huffed, stepping past him towards the dumpsters. "We have a visitor; I'm being a gracious host." With careful, purposeful movements, he set two saucers, one with cream and another with what must have been tuna, down on the pavement and sat back, placing the remaining items—three dishtowels and a bottle of water—next to him.
“Castiel, there you are!” the Queen called, beckoning him into the garden when he turned towards her.
Anna was in a place Castiel had never seen before, which meant it was very likely Prophet’s Hollow. She was reading with a young woman Castiel did not know, probably an apprentice.
However reluctantly he acknowledged it, Castiel knew that he should return to the castle soon. Just as he turned to leave, however, Dean stooped to unlace his boots. Castiel watched as he kicked them carelessly off and brought his hands to the belt across his chest next (he knew it housed a short metal dagger inscribed with strange glyphs, but beyond that its contents were unknown), the low
Dean seemed well aware that Castiel could not withstand postponing things further—or maybe he had reached a similar state of frazzled need—for he spared no effort on light, teasing touches, choosing instead to push Castiel against the wall with his own weight. One hand fumbled at the edge of Castiel’s tunic while the other cupped his jaw, pulling him in to meet Dean’s insistent, indulgent kisses.
Castiel wished he had had a tutor in this area, but dwelling bitterly on the unchangeable past would do little to help his situation. A tried and true method of his own would have to do; ever since he was old enough to ride, a relaxed meander through the woods with only his stallion and his own thoughts for company had proven a useful environment for sorting out pressing problems. Thus, when the queen next summoned Hannah for a cup of tea, Castiel summoned the stable boy and asked him to prepare Continental for a ride.
Dean already knew he’d had at least
Despite the multitude of languages at his disposal, he never could find the
“Cas, are you okay? Sam said he thought—I mean, you’d tell us if you were badly hurt, right? I know your grace is a little off-balance right now, but…” He trailed off, making a vague half-hearted gesture with his hand.
“Has my mother become wearisome?” Castiel asked, “She means well, but not everyone can match her exuberance—”
“What are
He let himself imagine that the salt on his tongue came not from his own skin but rather from placing open-mouthed kisses over the edge of Dean’s sharp jaw and down one side of his neck, or from mouthing at the dip in his collarbone. Perhaps Dean would let him suck and bite at the skin over his pulse until purple and red bloomed as proof of his ministrations.
“What should I tell you, Dean?” he snarled back. “Should I tell you about all the terrible things Lucifer made my vessel do? Did you want to hear about the things he made me watch inside my own head?” Castiel’s voice was rising too, and his wings were almost completely opaque, but he wasn’t done yet. “Or maybe you’d like to know what Amara had to say to me before I became Lucifer’s vessel.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"I'm accompanying
Gabriel hummed, considering. "Three weeks or so, I guess? I only give it whatever leftover cream we have that's about to go bad; the tuna I brought from home."
A servant had left a breakfast tray outside his chamber and he picked at it for a few minutes before admitting that it would not sate the particular craving that nagged at him.
Rowena considered his proposal for a moment before reaching out to tap a nail gently on the vial of grace hanging around Castiel’s neck.
“What else should there be?” Light asked.
Perhaps he needed another cup of Misery Tea.
“Stand,” his opponent commanded gruffly.
“So this lake,” Castiel began after a few minutes of  companionable silence, “What’s so significant about it? Why does Anna think we might find a clue to recusing Dean?”
He grit his teeth, frustrated. Absently, he let out a string of Enochian expletives with his true voice (something he’d taken to doing more and more frequently, as of late. It was easier to appear outwardly calm and patient if he could throw a small, private temper tantrum outside the range of human hearing). To his surprise, the space around him crackled briefly. He blinked.
Castiel looked somewhat sheepishly back at the brothers from his place at the top of the stairs. Dean guessed his face probably mirrored Sam’s ridiculous expression, which was somewhere between awed and concerned.
“After, uh—when I thought I’d left you in Purgatory…I was a wreck, I….I missed you…” The last words were barely a mumble, and Dean felt like his cheeks were on fire.
Dean shrugged easily. “Once,” he said, turning to fetch a cloth and pulling their pastries out of the fire, “It was not meant to be.”
This wasn't right. Despite relying on him for food and drink for more than a month, the cat still approached Gabriel with some amount of trepidation, and when Dean emptied the recycling into the dumpster the noise usually sent the cat scurrying away even if it had previously been happily accepting pats.
Jack brought Sam books from the library, Castiel made coffee, and three hours ticked uneventfully by. Then another three, and another, and with each shift change the conscious bunker occupants became increasingly restless and agitated.
Dean breathed, sounding equal parts desperate and incredulous.
Castiel groaned and tried to concentrate through the sensation. His fingers twitched against Dean’s neck and then he gave a tentative squeeze. Dean smirked, clearly challenging him to do better. Castiel tightened his grip steadily, carefully, until Dean’s mouth parted on a gasp, eyes fluttering closed as he dragged Castiel’s hips down onto him. The head of Dean’s cock pressed roughly against his prostate and Castiel loosened his grip in his distraction, a broken moan leaving his mouth as he swirled his hips for more of the feeling.
This time, he settled for watching Dean’s face instead, tracking his expression as it gradually evolved from mild discomfort to concentration to enjoyment and loving the way he pulled his lower lip between his teeth, releasing it even redder than before. Castiel reached up to thumb experimentally over Dean’s nipples, pleased with himself when Dean’s rhythm faltered briefly.
The thing standing behind him was not Hannah.
I have just noticed in my final round of edits that the official beginning of the theatre group is on September 18th. What up accidental easter egg!
“It’s…it’s fine. Just—what did you need?”
Rowena smiled knowingly. “But do you know what it
Dean displaced his hands from his forehead and sat up quickly, breathing heavily. Castiel didn’t move a muscle, wary of startling him further. Slowly, Dean’s breathing evened out and he inhaled deeply, his jaw locked tightly in the way Castiel knew meant that Dean was quickly closing himself off to any discussion.
“Thank you for looking after it. And me.” Hannah smiled gratefully at Dean even as he flushed and reached up to scratch the back of his neck. It was the first time since his arrival that Castiel had seen Dean look timid.
Dean faltered, his eyes rising to meet Castiel’s as his hand fell limply against his side. Castiel cleared his throat. He knew what he wanted to say, but he also knew he would likely never get another opportunity to say it. Dean needed to understand him the first time; he needed to choose his words carefully.
Dean turned slowly, frowning at the space between the second of his own dumpsters and the first of his neighbors'. Whatever it was had come from there, he was sure of it, but there was nothing there now. A piece of broken glass reflecting the light?
A month into Simba's stay, Dean gave in and started immunotherapy shots. The over-the-counter medication was clearly not cut out for this.
“You picked a fitting name for him, Naomi. He will grow up to be courageous-“
Dean looked over his shoulder for Sam’s reply, spatula in hand. Sam shook his gaze away from his book momentarily.
They remained still and connected as their breathing slowly returned to something resembling normal. Castiel shuddered, oversensitive, when Dean shifted on top of him again and Dean chuckled lowly, slipping out of his lap and all but tumbling onto the bed next to him. Not even a fraction of a second went by before Castiel twined his arms around Dean greedily, his desire for contact not abated in the slightest.
The shifter snarled and pushed his mouth against Castiel’s unwilling one, taking his words literally and tearing a new cut into Castiel’s swollen bottom lip. Unpleasant was an understatement; the shifter stank of gore and grime, and despite the sting Castiel pressed his mouth shut tightly against the attack, twisting his neck in an attempt to break the contact.
A new fantasy arose, one in which Dean came across Castiel here, stroking himself in the middle of the woods. Dean would grin at him lasciviously, would wink at him and stop Castiel from covering himself. He’d come close enough to murmur some lewd remark in Castiel’s ear, his own voice rough with arousal. If he were very lucky indeed, Dean would drop to his knees before him, would pull his bottom lip between his teeth and look up at Castiel with hooded, hungry eyes before swallowing him down.
“Truly,” Castiel confirmed, smiling sadly.
His phone number found its way onto Castiel's coffee cup, alongside a hastily scribbled message to get in touch if he felt like hanging out sometime.
The crowd below made sounds of wonder at the spectacular sight; Castiel watched, dazed, at the beautiful light before him, squeezing Hannah’s hands.
He didn’t wait for an answer before disappearing out of Castiel’s view. From a distance he could hear the horrible squelching and wet ripping sounds as the shifter shed his Sam outfit, pieces of flesh dropping to the floor with sodden plops. The noises made Castiel’s stomach turn. After several minutes, Dean Winchester came into view, although Castiel knew that this wasn’t really Dean. The eyes weren’t warm enough, the gait too relaxed, the smirk more evil than cocky.
He ducked forward then, capturing Castiel’s lips in a sweet, luxurious kiss before sitting up again, roguish grin in place once more.
“Dean, if you’re cold, maybe you should warm up in the car.”
Dean nodded without taking his eyes off the road. They were still a few hundred miles outside of Wisconsin, and the sun shone brightly above them. He had no worries that they’d arrive in time for the full moon, and even if they didn’t, Cas had gone along before them to set up camp and do some reconnaissance.
“Shhhh,” Dean murmured, “Can’t have you summoning the guards in the middle of a job, Cas.”
Castiel shook himself from his thoughts, removing his hand from the vial and extending it to take the proffered reigns of his horse.
“Dean,” he tried tentatively, but Dean shook his head.
Dean didn't like cats, but he wasn't an idiot. Shivering plus no appetite plus lethargy equaled sick for almost any creature.
Many mourned the uncertainty, wondering forlornly at the idea that there was someone better, someone
Sam gave Jack an appreciative pat on the back, but the disappointed sag of his shoulders was hard to miss.
In all his musings of Dean, Castiel had failed to consider the perfectly real possibility that Dean was spoken for by someone from his home kingdom. He was flirtatious by nature, but he’d never shown any real intent in pursuing anyone since his arrival, and Castiel had never wondered why that might be. A small, jealous knot formed in the pit of his stomach at the thought.
Cas looked down at his feet and Dean opened his mouth to protest, but Sam gestured for him to save it. “I don’t know what happened, but it was probably stupid,” He made his way past Castiel towards the door and exited, turning back around to continue, “So fix it. If you need me I’ll be getting work done.”
Castiel pulled her into his arms, shushing her softly even as his heart broke for her despair. He rubbed a hand up and down her back as his mother had done for him when he was a child, letting her cry into his tunic as he swallowed thickly around the lump in his throat, torn between anguish and the giddy relief that bubbled in his chest.
Hannah went still for a moment—surprised by his unusual affection, perhaps—but then she was kissing him back tentatively, softly. Castiel withdrew slightly before pressing against her in a second kiss, surer this time. He let his head tilt to one side for a better angle and smoothed a hand over Hannah’s slim shoulder. She was warm under the frock and it probably should have been exciting, but awkwardness clung to him insistently, shifting his focus to insecurities brought on by inexperience.
Indeed, it was mostly thanks to Simba that Dean was able to definitely close the books each evening and declare himself off-the-clock; they had a daily routine.
But he was certainly not copulating with any of the women he’d recently taken home; no, Castiel was watching
“Sam and I have a job next week,” he called from the hallway, “You’re coming with.”
It didn't matter how often Dean had done it before; every time a swirl of meringue landed perfectly on top of a lemon tart, every time chocolate shavings sprinkled over the top of a cake fell
“Han—For the creators’ sake, do I
forms of love, be it romantic or not. Hold your friends and family in as high regard as you would a lover. And make no mistake—” He glanced at Hannah again, giving her hand a light squeeze. “Though we are not in love, Hannah and I
His wedding.
Castiel turned to address Dean just as Michael snapped his fingers. Words caught in his throat as Dean was very abruptly robbed of all his clothing save for a pair of black, intricately designed women’s underwear that was decidedly more transparent than not. The flush of his skin contrasted starkly, prettily, with the gloom around them and Castiel guiltily snapped his eyes up from where they’d roamed as Dean scrambled to cover his groin. Dimly, he wondered what result this tactic was meant to elicit.
Castiel rubbed roughly at the renewed wetness on his cheeks and breathed deeply, interrupted here and there as stray chuckles found their way out of him.
“I’m glad you like it,” he said, clearly referring to his own scent. Castiel flushed at being caught. “This could get pretty awkward otherwise.”
Dean followed Dr. Novak down the hall, Gabriel bouncing along beside him, to the second-to-last room on the left. The nurse was waiting for them, standing next to the examination table and petting the considerably-perkier-looking orange stray.
Castiel scowled; the words had sounded around the room in his own voice, but the sentiment couldn’t have been farther from accurate.
Thanks once again to my incredible beta and fabulous artist! This was so stressful, but I'm thrilled with the final product, and I hope you are too. =]
luckily, depending who was asked—the reality was generally
The circumstances were quite different, of course. Dean was not royalty, for one thing, and there would have been no divine intervention suggesting a perfect match, for another. Castiel had not lamented having the kind of assurance his vial of grace provided him since before leaving to find Hannah, but he did so now. How much simpler it must have been for Dean and his partner to end the relationship.  How lucky, too, that it had ended amicably. Dean had said outright that, despite not being romantic in nature, the love they had for each other now was just as meaningful—
“By the creators, Cas,” he complained, stooping to pick up the cinnamon which had, miraculously, not shattered. “You nearly scared me into an early grave!”
Castiel swallowed hard. He averted his eyes in an effort to offer Dean some modicum of privacy, but it was too late; the view before him had already etched itself into his memory, and there was no lying to himself about whether or not he’d revisit it in the privacy of his own room.
He would know it when he saw it.
“Sure Cas.”
He gave his chest plate and arm guards a good polish, setting them aside afterwards while he collected other items from the armory. When Hannah found him, he had added several pieces to his pile, including his favorite, a long dagger fondly known as the “Angel Blade” because it was fused with magic, and tended to emit a radiant white light as it plunged through its victims.
Dean’s book hung loosely from his hand, more or less forgotten. Castiel had tried more than once to steer them back to running lines, but Charlie’s conspicuous absence made it very difficult to concentrate on memorizing anything.
He’d heard his name leave Cas’ mouth in many variations, but this cold, biting snarl was not one of them. Dean felt his frustration rise; he’d never had the ability to gently coax a person into giving him information, the way Sam could.
Frustrated, he scrubbed a hand down his face, steeling himself. Forgoing the extra moment of thought about the wisdom of his actions, he reached out, scooped the stray cat into his arms, and stood up.
Castiel took a deep breath and stepped over the threshold.
Rowena walked out to greet the crowd first, her ceremonial gold robes shining brightly in the dying sunlight. Castiel and Hannah kept their places, as instructed.
“Well, something
“It’s—I want it because it’s...because I want
And Dean, foolish softie that only Sam knew he was at heart, hadn't been able to say no when innocent eyes blinked up at him, sock-like paws nudging anxiously at the gate of the carrier crate.
At Dean's encouragement, Simba hopped up into his lap, cooing cheerfully and shifting his weight until he found the right spot to settle down. From this angle, he always reminded Dean of a loaf of bread. If loaves of bread were more orange-y and had tails, anyway.
For a moment there was silence save for their heavy breathing and the slap of their connecting skin as Castiel dropped onto Dean’s lap again and again, chasing release. He looked down when Dean tugged at his wrists, trying to pry him away from where he was pressing into Dean’s chest for leverage. Filtering through the hazy arousal in his eyes was a determined edge that Castiel didn’t know what to make of.
Castiel wondered if Dean meant to go swimming. Spring had certainly sprung, but the air still carried a stubborn winter bite to it.
Someone send my beta MalMuses flowers; I don't know why she keeps puttiing up with me but thank goodness she does. (don't leave me <3)
“You did,” Dean looked proud of him. “Jobs rarely go exactly according to plan,” he explained, “When things go awry, someone needs to make a call and know that the rest of the team will follow instructions. I’m that someone; I need to know that if I tell you to do something, you’ll do it without wasting a bunch of time arguing.”
A scoff sounded behind him. “Am I to take you at your word? Prove it.” The sword dug threateningly into his neck and Castiel hissed as it broke the skin. Slowly, so as not to cause alarm, he moved both hands to tug at the strip of leather around his neck until the glass vial under his tunic came free. He offered it for the other man to see, clutching it tightly in his fist.
Dean was right; how ridiculous would it be to end up in jail because of an ill-timed itch, or some other similar discomfort? He willed himself to stay still and silent as Dean brought his palms to Castiel’s skin once more.
"The one off route eighteen," Dean said, "Why, do you have a preferred vet for the strays you adopt?"
Were he anyone else, if his circumstances did not dictate that his future and the future of his people depended on his successful return, he might be tempted to damn the stories and forge his own path ahead. Only a very select few people were granted divine indication that they’d found their soulmate; for most, there was simply no telling. Some went through many partners in search of their perfect match while others actively remained chaste until they’d decided on a suitor, but in both cases there was no way to be certain.
Alas, the glass vial hanging around his neck spoke of a different path. Castiel brought a hand to it for a moment, feeling its warmth under his palm. At his touch, it shivered minutely, the contents inside active in a way that seemed almost sentient.
And then fake-Castiel shoved Dean bodily to the side, sending him tumbling over the edge of the bed and onto the floor, where he landed gracelessly with a heavy thud and a confused grunt.
Gabriel laughed. "You got it, boss."
Gabriel was absent from work again the next day, but by Thursday he was mercifully healthy enough to at least accompany Dean to the animal hospital.
Never before had Castiel so acutely felt the gap in himself that might have been occupied by artistic talent, had he any to speak of. Where his arousal had previously throbbed insistently, begging for his attention, it now smoothed out around the edges until it was a warm buzz underneath his skin.
And yet, on the long list of things Castiel might have expected to hear from Dean on the matter, an apology was nowhere to be found. Puzzlement filtered in through his embarrassment, but he was not granted any time to ask for clarification.
“What….the hell?”
“Let’s give the poison a chance to work it’s way out of his system,” Castiel continued, “We can take turns monitoring him until he wakes.”
He would be a married man, sworn to love and cherish Hannah as his one true love for the rest of his days. Hannah would be forever joined to him, and he to her. This was meant to be a joyous thing; indeed, most eagerly awaited the day they could wed the one they loved most.
Dean snorted. “Do
The words were stiff and too formal, as though this manifestation of Castiel had only scarce interaction with humanity to speak of. It certainly did not reflect the fluidity and familiarity Castiel had developed in his many years with the Winchesters.
Or—now that he thought more closely about it, perhaps a few of them
“You need to wake up, Dean. This isn’t real. None of this is real.”
Being in the same academic year as his little brother had its ups and downs, but overall Dean had no regrets.
Once his initial awe had subsided, Dean nudged Impala close to the series of large wooden panels that bore an abbreviated version of the legend surrounding the oasis. He dismounted swiftly and made quick work of securing the mare’s reigns around one of the posts. As he turned away, Impala whinnied cheerfully at him, bumping her nose against his shoulder until he smiled and reached up to stroke her snout. Castiel smirked, imagining the ugly expression he was certain would contort Bartholomew’s face were he here to see Impala being so affectionate towards a comparative stranger.
"How long have you been doing this?" Dean asked, frowning. The cat hadn't come any nearer to him but he already felt vaguely itchy all over, the threat of allergies looming.
Castiel did eventually raise himself onto his forearms to admire Dean spread out atop his sheets. Distantly, he offered thanks to whomever had prepared his room for their foresight to light a candle before leaving. Blue-white moonlight streamed in through the window on the opposite wall, combining with the flickering orange candle like to throw Dean into stunning contrast. Breathless and aroused, Dean was spectacular to behold.
“Is this alright?” Dean asked, pausing in uncorking the oil jug.
He had hoped—foolishly, perhaps—that the quick walk through the trees would cool his heated blood before he got back to Continental. Alas, the growing distance between himself and Dean only served as an excuse for his imagination to take what he’d seen and add to it without Castiel’s permission. When yet another vision of himself following trails of water down between Dean’s legs with his own fingers bloomed in his mind’s eye, he was forced to admit defeat. Swearing quietly, he ducked behind a nearby tree and leaned against it, sparing only a quick glance around himself for spectators before undoing the ties of his breeches and pushing them out of the way just enough to free himself from their confines.
“Thank you.” Castiel took half the pile and started to eat, pausing when he saw that Hannah was watching him and making no move to eat. “Aren’t you hungry?”
“No, that’s not what I—“ Dean pinched the bridge of his nose in frustration. Christ, the damn apocalypse had been easier than this.
“Dean,” Castiel parroted, obligingly holding the torch out for Dean to light. It flared brightly before settling to a softer glow, enshrouding a small space around them in flickering orange warmth. Dean made a sound of confirmation. He took the torch back from Castiel and together they began their ascent, pausing briefly now and again to light the torches along the wall as they went.
“Do you not trust our chef?”
“Yes,” Castiel replied, starting down the steps to meet them. His wings trailed behind him, casting brief shadows over the stairs and wall.
When Dean broke eye contact it was to find the other two men watching him—Dr. Novak softly, the way he had looked at the cat earlier, and Gabriel rather smugly.
“Ah, thank you Meg,” Crowley said, “And with that, the big reveal!”
“Dean,” Castiel interrupted, “Of course I want to. I…” He returned his lips to Dean’s sternum, confessing softly into his skin. “I want you in any way you’ll let me have you.” The words left him feeling shy and vulnerable, a strange sensation in the wake of their frenzied lust; he hadn’t realized how much weight they carried until they’d been said aloud.
Heaven had been restored to a well-oiled machine. Crowley had led his demons back to Hell, for the time being. Purgatory was closed, and the Darkness had been tamed. There was peace, if only for a moment.
“I apologize,” Castiel replied gruffly, rolling his shoulder and looking quite irritated. “I didn’t realize using my grace to teleport would be so draining.” Behind him, his wings twitched and jumped before stretching carefully outwards, and Cas winced as the joints popped. “It would seem that the tangibility of my wings changes as my grace waxes and wanes.”
For no other reason than because he was now allowed to do freely, Castiel caught Dean’s plush bottom lip—already quite red and swollen from so many kisses—  between his teeth, soothing over it with his tongue immediately afterwards. Dean carded his fingers through Castiel’s hair and pulled him back down, sealing their lips together in a proper kiss, open-mouthed and desperate.
“Yes, very good,” the Queen interrupted, plenty aware that their silliness would continue if she let it, “Castiel, we’ve been discussing arrangements for the wedding; there are plenty of areas that could do with your input, now that you’re here.” She leaned over the bush next to her, peering critically at the available buds before selecting one and adding it to the vase.
In fact, Dean had quite the mental laundry list of criteria—his circumstances were precarious at best and there was very little room for error—but no employee would be able to make a sound recommendation no matter how many details he provided. No, it was solely up to him to make the right choice.
“Dean” he commanded loudly.
“We’ve spoken to the High Priestess,” he summarized, “and decided that marriage would be in neither of our best interests. The Unity Ceremony will occur as planned, but Hannah will be free to marry someone of her choosing, at her convenience. As will I.”
Missouri’s tea, for when he was miserable. Misery Tea.
Food, drink, and dance carried everyone long into the night. Despite his exhaustion earlier in the day, Castiel found his second wind. He laughed until he was hoarse, danced with Hannah and the other courtiers until he couldn’t feel his legs, and reminded himself several times to thank the kitchen staff profusely for the bountiful feast they had arranged.
Once he went to a man, a newcomer who was a few years Dean’s senior and quite eager to let Cas take care of him. But Cas found that it was painful to be with him, because he just couldn’t help but wonder if this was how Dean would touch him, feel around him, sound. He went back to women.
Standing up, Dean leaves the condo without looking back. Michael doesn’t pursue him any farther. The adrenaline in his body for once isn’t from fear or panic--it’s from exhilaration. Michael finally got what he deserved and though Dean was a fucking idiot to even give him a chance, damn it felt good to turn the tables on him. The elevator can’t go down fast enough, and once he’s in the garage he practically skips to his car. The drive home consists of him singing to Pat Benatar and using his steering wheel as a drum. When he parks in the driveway Castiel is just leaving the front door for his morning jog, looking confused when Dean hops out of the car and runs toward him.
“You don’t know me,” Castiel’s hackles raise. Dean is speaking familiarly of him. Like they’ve known each other before this. “For all you know that’s my favorite parlor trick.”
“I am,” Castiel says. Charlie moves aside so he can pass her and walk through the living room towards the opposite side of his apartment, where his bedroom is. The guest bedroom-slash-office is directly next to the bathroom, which is actually ideal, but the room Castiel chose is larger and has a better view of the sunset. He hears Charlie trailing after him and doesn’t bother shutting his door. She’s seen everything over the course of their friendship. They’ve been friends so long it’s hard to put a number on the years.
“You can either help or you can watch,” Castiel says, pushing the lid of the trunk open wider. Michael visibly flinches when the man gets near him. “Or, you could run back to the highway, flag down a car, call the cops--I’ve scrambled your phone, by the way--and turn me in.”
Afraid to learn that he’s having the entirely wrong reaction to learning his roommate is
“What’s the best thing you’ve ever done, completely unrelated to your work as a journalist?” Dean asks patiently, like he’s the one conducting an interview with a serial killer and not the other way around.
, again and again, for all eternity,
“Ouch,” Charlie says with sympathy. “Take a bath with some lavender salts? I brought some, they’re on the bathroom counter.”
"It wasn't you, it was-" Michael lets out a pained chuckle. "It was me. It was my fault. My anger and incompetence that led me to treat you so terribly. And you- you continued to meet me every week and I paid you more and more each time because I thought I could apologize with money, not words." He dips his chin down a bit. "Do you know why our last meeting was
“What’s that mean?” Dean asks, turning a frown to him.
“So the whole vigilante thing… you think there’s substance to that?”
. She had marched right up Castiel’s front steps when he wasn’t home, knocked, and then told his parents directly that she was in love with their son and planned on marrying him. The bold declaration had thrown them off a bit, but like everyone else in the world, his parents fell for Daphne’s charisma and charm. She’d been welcomed into the family. They married at twenty, lived in Castiel’s parent’s basement until he graduated university, and then moved in together at twenty-five.
to work nine-to-five at a law firm, ummmmm,” she clicks around a bit, “called
“Thank you for your time, Dean.”
“I find it hard to believe a nice man like yourself can’t find a good date,” Ellen says, and her words are kind but her eyes are a little scary.
He chuckles as he stands, drying off his legs and feet before getting out of the tub and stepping onto the mat. He pulls the plug, and then starts to dry off the rest of his body. “He does. He’ll be happy to see you.”
His dreams intensify. It’s like a levee breaks one night, all sorts of memories gripping him. He dreams of leading some sort of crusade; he dreams of flying through hellfire, the sensation of appendages he didn’t even know he had charring and burning as flames lick across his celestial being. He dreams of gripping a man -
“How can this be?” The man’s voice is bewildered, his gaze taking in Castiel’s rumpled appearance of faded, torn jeans and an old AC/DC shirt. As suddenly as he’d gotten confused, his expression morphs into rage. “
Being raised in a strictly Catholic family, Castiel was destined to follow his father’s footsteps and become a priest. He’d been unsure of that even as a child, but he did as told, unaware of how he could do anything different.
“Hey,” Dean greets a lone man seated in a booth by the window. He sends him a friendly smile, pulling his notepad and pen from his apron pocket. “What can I get you to drink?”
When Castiel shuts himself in the bathroom, the ringing in his head slowly fades away. As he looks around, he notes that his vision seems fine. Picking up the bottle of salts and turning it to read the label, he’s mildly bewildered to see that the text is perfectly normal. Figuring the stress is getting to him, he draws a hot bath and strips before lowering the toilet seat and settling down. The new information on Pamela is surprising. He’s only talked to her the one time over the phone, and she had spoken to him with such familiarity… At the time, he hadn’t thought much of it. But upon reflection, learning that she may not be who she says she is, he can’t help but wonder.
i'm just having a grand old time making them navigate each other :-)
Squeezing his hand, Dean turns to face his brother, putting both hands on his shoulders and trying to send him a reassuring smile. “We don’t have to.”
“Just as I should hope that you’d give me the same courtesy.” Sipping his coffee, Castiel congratulates himself on a fantastic save. After a moment, he asks, “Was the Michael thing weighing on you that much?”
“Done,” Castiel promises.
Dean takes the hanger with slow hands, looking at the shirt thoughtfully. Still seeming as though the shirt will bite him, Dean sets it on the bed and starts unbuttoning his shirt. By the time he has the blouse on he already looks more relaxed, his shoulders less tense and his jaw relaxed.
He should just kill him to get those distractions out of his head.
“Thank you,” Castiel rumbles. He slouches a bit in the uncomfortable seat, tipping his head back against the wall. “Have you heard anything?”
“Minus the illegal shit, those other things are
It occurs to him, as he starts filling up the grave he’d tossed the tarp in, that while he’d put an ad in the papers for a roommate to help with finances (really, he could handle all the bills himself, but he was saving up for a house and therefore had to pinch some pennies in this godforsaken after-boomer market), there could be another…
Castiel doesn’t drink often, but after leaving the prison, an hour having gone by quicker than anticipated, he wastes no time in telling his taxi driver to take him to the bar by his house despite the fact it’s only three in the afternoon. Satchel in hand he settles down heavily on a stool at the bar, clumsily bumping his knuckles on the underside of the bartop to find a hook to hang his bag. Once he finds it he puts both hands on the bar and waits for the bartender to notice him; he holds up two fingers and Benny, the bartender, smiles warmly and dutifully pours him two fingers of whiskey.
“Dean, are you nervous about high school?” Mary asks kindly. Once everyone has food on their plates, she sits down and sends her eldest son a concerned look. “It’s an entirely new world."

He's broken. He'll never know normal.
“I just feel like I could be doing better.”
on Sam’s face. The smile that Dean helped coax back. Turns out that Bobby and Ellen only live a few miles away from Castiel, so Dean invites the brat to bicycle over any time he wants to visit. Their goodbye hug is sort of awkward, because it’s not really goodbye, but Dean holds him a little tighter anyway. Bobby and Ellen just raise their eyebrows when Dean says he’s moving in with someone, but other than that stay mercifully quiet on the subject.
dates, days that Castiel would honor and celebrate. He goes back to this morning, waking up to an empty house and going about his routine alone. It wasn’t that rare; Castiel went for jogs, he went to the market, he had errands to run for his business. There was no note on the fridge, and he hadn’t thought twice about it. He’s been living with Castiel for nearly four months now- all through summer and into autumn. They existed so well sometimes they didn’t even talk. He tries not to feel guilt for not knowing what day it is, and tells himself that if Castiel had wanted him to know, he would have said something.
Dean splutters, “I don’t know if-”
ing of the garage door blasting over them as they enter the house.

“Boys!” He nearly shouts, then catches himself. He reaches out, gripping both of their shoulders and bringing them in for a tight hug.
“Dean. Please look at me, baby.”
“Yeah, like when people are talking about something they don’t want others to know they’re talking about,” Charlie says, almost distractedly.
Perfunctory and awkwardly formal. Rubbing the back of his neck idly, Dean decides to fix himself a bowl of stew and savor it while sitting at the kitchen table, gathering his bearings.
And here, in front of Castiel’s house, a place he’s only been to once before, Dean finally feels like he can breathe, ironically enough. There’s no weight on his shoulders, no cloud over his head. No thinking of mom and immediately feeling guilty, like he didn’t do everything he could for himself and Sammy.
“I dunno,” Benny says, tone now measured. He eyeballs the quickly wilting salad. “Are you all worked up ‘cause he’s your charge?”
“Hoy frack.” He can hear clacking on Charlie’s end, meaning she’s at her computer and furiously typing. “Ok. Ok, whaddya want? You know, one time I looked into the guy and saw some crazy stuff in some police records. But my system got flagged and I had to get out of that corner of the internet really quick.”
“So after she died, you opened up the club?”
“You ok?” Dean asks once he’s settled. His voice is gruffer than usual today, brows knit, and it could be perhaps because he didn’t sleep well, or it might even be an actual concern for Castiel.
They’ve been in the hospital for about an hour. Dean was admitted with a concussion and abdominal injuries, some internal bleeding being monitored. Not deadly, just a concern. That morning, when John had dragged a terrified Dean away from Castiel’s car, he’d immediately rang Benny. Any doubt he’d had about the man not doing his job properly the night before got washed away when he showed up, on duty, on actual police time and in actual police uniform, to arrest John Winchester.
Castiel isn’t so sure.
"I said," the owner sneers, "you're not our type."
There’s no way he just defended Dean Winchester, most prolific serial killer in the world.
i know this is short, but this is the last of the 3-part prologue.
“-but I will respect you
"You're real funny, man. A real comedian," Dean grouses.
(See the end of the chapter for
The tiniest of smiles quirked Castiel's lips. His fingers finally gripped at the parts of Dean's sleeves that weren't slick with blood. "It was coming for me either way."
“Will I?” Castiel says blandly.
“Evenin’. You Dean?”
He nods. Understandable. He’s pretty sure if the doctor came in and started spouting things off to him he wouldn’t be able to process it, either. Letting out a breath, he tips his head back against the wall and closes his eyes. “How long have you been married?”
“You were having a… nightmare?” she guesses, stepping closer once it seems like Castiel has his bearings. “Are you alright? That was super freaky. Your eyes were all rolled back and you were twitching.”
“When your dad is released from custody… he will return to your home, correct?”
“I thought it’d be disrespectful to bring marijuana to a hospital, so I at least told myself to keep from starving. They taste ok. I’d rather smoke a joint, but, you know.”
Collecting himself, Sam squares his shoulders and looks at Castiel straight-on, locking their gazes. “This life isn’t real, Cas. None of it is real. It’s an accelerated timeline. Can you remember your childhood?”
"She was unlike anyone I'd ever met before." Castiel nods, taking a careful sip of his cocoa. "She was full of life, endlessly positive, and loved with her whole heart. My father told me she was an angel sent to me by God, and that I should thank Him for the rest of my life.
“Do you truly believe he has changed?”
Blinking, Michael tilts his head. "I think I'm beyond anger, Dean. It's been a long time since I've been truly angry." He drops his gaze to his own menu. "The last time we were together- that's when I realized I was headed down a dark path."
He blinks a few times, frowning at his reflection.
Like Castiel.
he told himself when he woke up late Saturday morning.
. But! It gets hinkier. This law firm didn’t exist until Pamela did. She’s there Monday-through-Friday like clockwork, is never seen on the weekends, and there’s no record of her visiting Dean in jail outside of court dates.”
“N’thanks.”
“Good job,” Dean claps his hands mockingly, softly so as to not attract attention. “I’m leaving now.” This time when he turns to leave, Michael lets him. He barely refrains from stomping up to the bar to put the order in on the iPad, then makes a beeline for the kitchen so he can get away from Michael’s lingering gaze.
He spends his time dodging. Michael’s power is strong but his flight is clumsy. They’re both out of practice, but with less wings Castiel is a hair more agile. While that may be the case, if and when Michael lands a hit, it’ll rattle his jawbones.
“Right,” Benny flashes a sly grin. His attention is grabbed by another patron, for whom he pops open a beer and slides the bottle down the bar towards him. He looks back at Castiel. “Instead, you like bein’ the vigilante reporter that tips the cops off and helps them solve cases. What did you say about ‘em?” Benny scratches the scruff on his jaw as he tries to recollect, and then snaps his fingers with a bark of laughter. “‘They’re always caught up in the red tape.’”
The fact that Castiel had spoken up about Michael had been expected. Honestly Dean thinks he handled that conversation pretty well, if he ignored the fact that he was anxious with nausea for like, three hours. Now it’s around five in the morning and Michael is fast asleep next to him, blissfully unaware of Castiel’s inquisition. Well- ok, that’s a little dramatic. He’s… hell, the more he thinks about it, the fact that Castiel was so concerned is… nice. Y’know? Like, warm and fuzzy-ish. Dean’s stupid knee-jerk reactions to just assuming everyone’s on his ass for no reason is something he needs to examine, oh he’s fully aware, but does he really need to do it now?
“You don’t have to,” Castiel says with a small shrug. “But if it makes you feel better, you should.”
“Hey!” She greets, perky as ever. Her fingers are clack-clacking away.
Dean looks at him skeptically. "That's it?"
- and raising him from perdition. He dreams of his handprint singed into flesh, the connection between man and warrior. He dreams of an insufferable smile, an annoying laugh; he dreams of pure terror mixed with relief mixed with a feeling he’s… never felt before.
Snapping his gaze up, Dean feels his cheeks flush. He could argue, but he knows his reaction would blow over any excuses he could make up. But Kevin doesn’t judge; he just smiles softly, sifting through the bottles and tubes and containers. He doesn’t say anything more. He just starts naming what he has in his hand, explaining its function and how to use it. Dean pays close attention, suddenly thankful that this shitty thing happened so Kevin can save him.
He reaches for the Enochian printout abandoned on the table. The letters don’t vibrate, no booming, Heavenly voice ricochets through his brain.
Slowly, Castiel returns to his seat. He’s still poised to flee, belatedly remembering the panic button the guard had told him about. He could hit it at any time, leave and never come back. Pamela had said that he would be able to interview Dean once a week up to the date of his execution, but he also had the option to stop at any time. Shoulders getting stiff from tension, Castiel’s back stays straight as he sets the recorder down on the table again. He hadn’t pressed ‘stop’.
“You’re
And, speaking of toes…
“A man named Victor.”
Castiel has the opportunity to fill in the gaps, here. He just has to go about things in a way that gets Dean to supply the missing information, and hope that Dean doesn’t decide to cancel the interviews and refuse to see Castiel again. There’s still a lot of holes in the case, and Castiel would chew off his own left foot to get them filled.
“I don’t?” Michael’s eyes widen slightly. “Why do you think I saw you so many times?”
“Why?” Sam asks, voice reedy.
“Where did you keep him?” Dean asks before he can think. His brain is firing in too many directions all at once. He doesn’t know if he’s scared or thrilled.
He dreams of a boy with golden eyes and a golden heart. That’s new.
Besides, the only person he’s ever lain with like this before was Daphne. And while Dean is entirely one-hundred percent not her…
The car ride to the hospital is a blur. John is speeding, surely, but also Dean’s just… hazy. Aside from holding his brother to him he doesn’t really register anything else going on. His mom is in the hospital. She had a stroke. She could die.
Now John reacts, stepping forward. “Sam-”
“I’m having a hard time believing I’m an
Raising his hands, Sam stands and takes a step away from what looks like a weird satanic drawing on the floor. He eyes Castiel’s gun cautiously. “You’ve never had one of those before.”
The only question is why these things spiked when Dean struck out on his own, leaving Sam with their ‘uncle’ Bobby Singer.
separate enough from one another that Dean would, if put under pressure, likely default to “he was in his room all night”, because as far as he knows, that’s where Castiel spends all of his “grumpy study time”.
Victor opens the door, barking orders into the hallway. Castiel stays where he’s standing, wearing sunglasses in a dark room and not giving a single shit, his arms still folded over his chest as someone comes in with a hand broom and dustpan to clean up the mess. Someone else quickly replaces the fixture and the bulb, Victor and Castiel exchange a glance and a nod, and then Dean and Castiel are left alone again.
“I…” he licks his lips, then nods. “I don’t want to, but I do.”
"I did," Dean says softly, picking up his menu and staring at it to avoid Michael's gaze. He gives a slightly dry laugh. "'Straight edge', or whatever the kids call it nowadays."
lucky he's eighteen. We'd be in a whole different mess otherwise."
He pays for Sam’s extra curricular activities, pays for summer camp, buys school supplies. Dean’s on his own, though, like he doesn’t need any financial help. But the truth is, he doesn’t need help- because he’d dropped out and taken care of everything on his own.
"The Singer-Harvelles are on their way now."
“I’m not sure. He seems distracted, and he’s on his phone any chance he gets.”
“You were a
“Hang out in my office. I’ll leave the bar to Garth.”
Finally, Dean blurts, "Did you ever beat her?"
Fully aware that he never takes days off or leaves early unless prearranged, Castiel figures word will get out about what happened no matter what. He prefers it be from him, though. “Dean was assaulted. I’m taking him home.”
Wedding photos.
“Angel blood is like…” Sam tries to find the words. “It’s the best vehicle for magic if you’re missing ingredients or needing the spell to be stronger than it actually is. And…” he sends Dean an uneasy glance.
“What’s his name?” She asks. She has kale stuck in her teeth.
"That's not my intention," Michael says. "I know you're a good person, Dean. I don't want to cause you undue harm."
“Ugh,” he stands up, draining his coffee. “Time to get goin’. Uh- I wasn’t payin’ attention last night. What part of town are we in?”
?” Castiel presses. That exhaustion is threatening to overtake him again.
Dean avoids any more questions by smoothing his hand down his shirt and frowning. Castiel catches this, watching a few different expressions filter over Dean’s features; frustration, confusion, and then exasperation.
“I’m licensed to carry,” Castiel says.
and- heh- alive.”
Not an ounce of loneliness in sight.
"You should be more concerned about your
A knock raps on the front door. John drops Dean reflexively. The door had been left open, the screen ajar, allowing whoever to enter undetected. Dean groans and rolls to the side, tasting blood in his mouth.
“Hello,” he calls.
Nodding, Michael lets out a soft sigh. "He's right. He sounds like… a good father."
, my dear, will have all the benefits of a mom visiting and none of the drawbacks: showered with gifts, free babysitter. None of her waking up at six a.m. and loudly asking where we keep our frying pan.”
“What do you like?” Dean asks, curious and intrigued that he and Kevin have more in common than he originally thought.
.” Wiggling out of Michael’s grip, he feels his heartbeat start to quicken. “I’m shitty food and lingerie and hair bands, Mike. You sayin’ you been tryna
Groaning, Dean pushes around his potatoes. “
Castiel finally settles on Fridays being the day he goes to the prison for his interview. It’s the end of the work week, which means it’s socially acceptable for him to look forward to getting utterly obliterated by alcohol once he’s off the clock. He does his best to not think about Winchester at all throughout the week. He takes on menial articles, local sports news, or graffiti in the alleys, or whatever the hell makes noteworthy news in an otherwise unnoteworthy city.
“It’s not a big deal,” Dean says, “some of the guys got rough at practice.”
Dean rolls his eyes at the bar, closing out the ticket he was working on and taking it to the two girls who were giggling at their own table, coffees in hand and eyes bright with reunion. “Have a good day, ladies.”
“Because I had to make sure she made it to the hospital alive!” John snaps.
you.”
“Are you ok?” Kevin asks, hovering.
"When are you available?"
“Right,” Castiel says dryly.
This isn’t the first time they’ll save the world…
Dean’s expression softens as he stares at the D-ring his wrists are connected to. He wrings his fingers together slowly, and when he lifts his gaze to lock with Castiel’s, the reporter feels his gut sink heavily to the floor.
what fondness is? Clueless and gullible, Dean is exactly who Castiel needs in his life to appear… normal, and to not raise suspicions.
Castiel opens his dresser to fish out a fresh pair of boxers. Now that the scent from his own shampoo isn’t clouding his senses, he can smell something delicious in the kitchen. He drops his towel and pulls on his boxers, “I trust you figured out when would be a good time to call him?”
“And the angel warding?”
"What?" Some of Dean's rowdiness returns. "Tell me I'm wrong."
The emotion he feels the most in this very moment?
Castiel glances over at him; takes in his freckled skin, a stray water drop stuck in the dip of his collarbone, the easy smile on his lips. "Sure." He rips his gaze away to focus on whisking the cocoa.
“Are you,” John leans closer, examining Dean’s face so intensely he’s pretty sure he’s getting an x-ray with his naked eyes, “wearing makeup?”
At seven thirty-five his roommate, one Dean Winchester, blows through the kitchen in a whirlwind of “shit shit shit”s, improperly buttoned shirts and untied shoes. Late for class, as usual.
“Good,” Sam hides his gun in the back of his pants, bending to clear up what looks like a metal mixing bowl and a bunch of herbs and spices. Standing at his full height, he sends a warm smile down to Castiel. “Can I come in?”
It takes Dean a second to reply, but when he does, it’s mumbled. “Motel.”
The man just shrugs.
Swallowing past the lump in his throat, Castiel reaches up a hand to wipe it over his face and look at her with a wan smile. “Today was her first Mother’s day.”
“Good.” They both sit at the table. Dean had had the day off, so they haven’t seen each other since Castiel went to work. “Been workin’ on a routine.”
It takes twenty minutes to dismember all eight wings.
Scrubbing a hand over his mouth, Dean chuckles a little wetly. “Go to bed, brat. Tomorrow’s the beginning of our new lives.”
“Well,” she looks thoughtful for a moment. “They’ve lived in that house for… oh, shoot. Twenty years? I’ve been their neighbor for ten. The missus passed away about five years ago.” She frowns and clucks her tongue. “Ol’ John went for the drink, you know. I did my best to help out the boys when I could, but there was never any proof of what was happening. John’d yell, I’d think about callin’ the cops, then everything’d be quiet and I’d tell myself to keep an ear out the next day. Dean never came around whenever he had a shiner.”
Yeah.
“I like the kinda young man you’re turning into,” Ellen says with a wicked glint in her eye.
When Dean wakes up, for a second, he thinks he’s on a cloud. He feels… floaty and lightweight, cushioned on every side. It smells like fresh ozone and washed linens. Nothing hurts. As he sits up and gets his bearings of the room he’s in, last night comes hurtling back into his brain like a linebacker.
“Huckleberry pancakes and bacon. Would you like eggs?”
It could be a coincidence that God has been brought up twice in one day by people Castiel would normally pass off as psychos. Something tells him that he should stop believing in coincidences.
“And she’ll get over it and
For today no plans had been discussed. Dean strains his ears but can’t hear Castiel moving around the house, so he surmises that he’s still in bed catching some z’s. The guy deserves it. Sitting up and yawning so wide his jaw cracks, Dean gets dressed in sweats and a t-shirt that looks suspiciously like one of Castiel’s, then makes his way out to the kitchen. Indeed, Castiel is still snoozing; no coffee is brewing, and the house is still dark. It’s not even eight, but Dean jokes about developing an “old man” schedule frequently, which makes Castiel roll his eyes and say “it’s only an old man schedule if you nap frequently during the day”. Which, Castiel doesn’t nap, so technically he’s not on an old man schedule either.
"I did," he chuckles. "But I wouldn't change a thing."
Hebrew language. Anyway, ‘Angelical’ language was basically a huge secret from the humans because God and his buddies didn’t want the humans to actually know how to interact with them outside of all the prayer hoopla. Like, literally, this dude - ummm, Kelley I think - was like, the sole contributor for the Enochian language and alphabet. He had a buddy who was just as cuckoo and together they were trying to unlock magical worlds or something.” She blows out a sigh, scratching at her jaw. “I was half asleep at this point but I think I still have the web pages pulled up.”
"Trust me, it's better than all the other names he picked" His brother assured him.
That nothing at all
"Bye Sammy" Dean said.
"Trust me, I've had stranger" Dean assured them as he slammed baby's trunk closed.
"Dean I'm so sorry it totally escaped my mind" They tried to play it off unsuccessfully.
"Yeah sure that's why your in such a rush big boy" The demon winked at Dean.
'Yeah, that type of crazy" Dean huffed.
Dean knew it was going to be a very long night...
"Shane wait! I didn't say you were a monster" Ryan protested with them.
"Drinking always seems to be the first thing you turn to when faced with a problem isn't it Dean?" Cass gave the hunter a knowing glance.
"Yeah what's up bud?" Shane replied.
"Oh finally, I was gonna call a search party for you dude" Ryan sighed as his cohost Shane entered into the hallway, with bags full of filming gear in tow.
"Maybe you should slow down on the alcohol Ryan" He cautiously suggested to the ghost hunter.
"Dean, I can be helpful! I found the case why won't you let me help" Jack said with hurt in his eyes.
"Hey, Me and Jack just got back home good timing. You guys doing okay?" His younger brother asked concerned.
"I'll make sure to put you as my reference then, since you can give them such a glowing review of my capabilities. Both in and out of the bedroom" Dean coughed the last part of the sentence out as he waggled his eyes brows suggestively.
"That was our kid, he's a big fan" Dean explained.
"Careful who your calling wussy boy" Shane's height advantage over the hunter made the lanky demon scarier than Dean had anticipated.
"Look I wanna get out of here as fast as possible so head down and do what I say. We gotta Salt and burn these people before they try and kill your pal again back at the house" Dean said plainly.
"Thursday" The devil in disguise replied very matter of factly.
Anger bubbled in Dean's stomach and rose up through his body, dictating his next actions. "Okay, okay sure I'll sit this one out" Dean went to turn back to where he had got up from and while doing so, he splashed the remaining alcohol in his glass all over the head demons front. While they were distracted Dean drew out his gun with his other hand and shot the soaked hell-spawn square in the chest. "Uh oh, it was an accident" Dean smirked, drunken idiot act totally dropped now as the wounded demon let out his final ear-piercing shouts.
"WOAH THERE CONSTANTINE, I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND" Shane hollered.
"Shut it, I've been doing this since I was in dippers. I know what I'm doing" Dean shot back at him annoyed.
"WHAT THE HECK MAN" Shane staggered backwards as blood dripped down his face "I think you broke my nose" He whined as he held his head upwards. "Ahhhhh fuck"
"Somethings very off about all this Dean. It's very unusual for a demon to pursue humans like it seems to with these Ryan and Shane people" Castiel thought aloud.
"Okay that is cute" Dean admitted.
"Well that and I was thinking of booking it the fuck out of here honestly" Shane admitted to the pair.
Was it possible that the demon truly did just like being the humans friend?
"This is a hoot wow he's so alpha isn't he Cass?" Lucifer said to the Angel, halfway through his second bowl of popcorn that day. He didn't need to eat of course he just enjoyed the dramatics of it all.
"Come on, We gotta get back to the mansion before Cass and Ryan drink all that sweet beer" Dean turned and headed toward the impala.
"Well I assumed you kinda cancelled our friendship subscription when you broke my nose" Shane told him.
"Please" Shane pleaded with them.
"Yeah that sounds reasonable" Ryan was very thankful for this suggestion as he would get some well needed shut eye.
"The cameraman" Dean stated flatly.
"Just another day in the life of team free will" Cass added tiredly.
Dean's eyes lit up like the lights of a Christmas tree at the mention of a brewery.
Dean and Cass tried to move to aid Ryan, but the other Lemp's had them pinned down to the floor.
"Unless you are planning on becoming a male escort Dean, I think all the information given about your skills should remain above board" Castiel concluded the hypothetical conversation about Dean seeking employment in a field with a lesser death rate than hunting things that go bump in the night.
It will be exactly the same
"I'm Dean Winchester and my brother and I hunt things. Supernatural things. It's kinda the family business and since the family expanded it's been the four of us doing it. Me, Sam, Cass and Jack our son" The hunter explained to Ryan.
"Can I help you gentlemen?" The owner asks the Angel and hunter.
"Alright okay!" The demon sighed "Yes Sir, Mister Winchester Sir!" He saluted before teleporting into the drivers side.
The pair sat in silence for a while after that, just enjoying being in each other's company. Maybe it was their so called "profound bond" with each other but both the hunter and the Angel just felt better when the other was at their side.
"That isn't me anymore, I don't want to dig up old bones" Shane insisted, not wanting to delve into his past.
Ryan lowered the paper bag from his mouth. "No man, I'm pretty far from alright right now. I've been palling around with a demon for years!" He shot back in a panic.
"Yeah Cass" Dean confirmed.
"Okay I'll be the first to admit, it's a funny name" Ryan reluctantly agreed with the other host.
"A prince of hell. You have to be fricking kidding me right now" Dean mumbled, realising why holy water had no effect on the bastard. Son of a bitch, why was it always them that and to deal with this level of weird cases. Out of all the hunters in the country, they always get landed with fucking the yellow eyed demons.
"You're right. This is a 'serious' case" Dean did rabbit ears on the word serious. "It's not like this two  idiots had an argument a few minutes ago about whether Stuwart Little was a mouse boy or a mouse man" Dean was getting tired of the ghoul boys antics already.
"Yeah that's what I was thinking but apparently Agent Young thinks otherwise. Well at least if he is doing some shadey shit we'll have good material for the new season of true crime right" Ryan replied, trying to make light of the situation.
Heaven
"Dean?" Castiel tried to get the hunters attention who was clearly wrapped up in his own thoughts.
"Good eye bud you're right this ain't no movie magic. This is textbook our kinda crazy" Dean said to the others.
"I was aware my likeness had been stolen by Hollywood that's a lawsuit for another day. Besides in my humble opinion he portrayed the man who is a bat much more convincingly than he did with myself, although the he did achieve a great likeness to me. Now you got some explaining to do. Firstly how do you two gentlemen know what revenants are and how did you kill them so easily? Especially you Mister magic hands" Doc pointed towards Cass.
(See the end of the chapter for
"What's the little rats name?" Dean asked, hoping it wasn't something ridiculous like Mister Fluffy-Butt.
"Yes the metaphysics of reality, it's all very complex" Castiel sighed tiredly.
"Of course not, these people actually want to see scary shit" Dean stated as he pulled out two cans of red spray paint out of his duffel and chucked one to his Angel buddy who caught it with one hand. "What a show off " Dean thought to himself, when in reality he liked all of Cass's little quirks. Well, maybe not his heightened sense of smell. That particular trait of the Angel made it very hard to play off a fart as just a squeaky shoe and oh boy had he tried.
There is a party
"I have my beliefs Shane and you have yours" Ryan snarled back at him.
"Demons always have an ulterior motive" Dean shot back at him.
"Is that brown bag still on the table?" Ryan asked looking very red and scared.
"Is that wise? To reveal the truth about the paranormal to these internet men?" Cass pondered.
"You just got pranked?" Shane shrugged his shoulders.
"Well the cameras fine but the mics have just stopped working all of a sudden. That's odd" Ryan said looking down at the equipment puzzled.
Clenching his teeth, Dean sighs and uses his foot to kick the back of Charlie’s calf as she walks away. He fixes up drinks, carrying them on a tray back over to where his family is sitting and enjoying conversation.
Daphne rolls her eyes, moving into the room and elbowing him playfully. “She can stay in a hotel.”
There’s a collage up on the wall that makes Dean’s breath come up short.
“Cas if you don’t answer me I’m gonna kick down this door! Don’t think I can’t!”
“What…” Castiel’s breath wheezes slightly. “What did you do…?”
The waiter leaves. Dean leans back in his chair, feeling more relaxed now that the air is clear between them. He arches a brow, "You don't wanna date me still, do you?"
Grunting in exasperation and pain, Castiel takes off his sunglasses, the frames clattering on the table as he puts his hot palms over his hot eyes.
Exhaling, Castiel brings the glass to his lips to knock back the final ounce. Licking his lips, he sends Benny a slightly deprecating smile as he stands from the stool. He wishes he could get sauced. His alcohol tolerance has always been scary good. He should call it a night before things get away from him. “Good night, Benny.”
“You can’t,” John says staunchly. “He’s my son and I take care of our issues however I see fit.”
It’s impressive, really, the way Michael raises a brow at Castiel. “Is that so?”
“Well,” Benny leans against the counter, “what kinda stuff you chattin’ about with him? Anything confidential?”
“I don’t pay you to nap, handsome,” Crowley says, even though there’s amusement dancing in his eyes. He loves to catch Castiel sleeping, even though he never really punishes him for it, simply because he knows he can hold it over the younger man’s head later. “You’ve got a call on line two. She sounds gorgeous- don’t let her slip away, hm?”
“A bruise. On your face? That you need to cover with makeup?” John asks, incredulous as he folds his arms over his chest.
“Y’know what?” Dean puts his hands on the table, standing up so quickly his chair nearly topples over. “I’m real thankful for all you do for me, Cas. Truly. But I’m gonna live my life.” He drops his gaze, those spring greens wet and his freckled cheeks flushed. He says softly, “You’re not my dad. And I’m not Jimmy. So whatever you’re tryna do- just… stop.”
is award-winning and well known and Dean worked the same neighborhood in the slums but the men definitely came from all over. Holy shit. And this guy! Dean remembers him, now. Cocky, self-assured, God’s gift to man. A closeted dude married to some lady he complained endlessly about, even when balls deep. No wedding ring, but Dean knows his wife is a beard. No way would he leave her.

anything.”
Clenching his jaw, Dean wrings the steering wheel idly. It doesn’t seem like John is even going to apologize. Letting out a short breath, Dean says, “Out.”
“You’re gonna get in this car,” Dean says, pointing at the ground. Who’s the disappointed father now? “I’ma take you home, and then leave your ass there,
They’re alive.
“No-” Benny suddenly shakes his head, fixing Castiel with a steady gaze. “This ain’t on you, brother. Ol’ John was bound and determined to go off the deep edge any day now. I know it feels like shit, Castiel, but you were there. And that actually made all the difference. Imagine if he’d gone alone? And John caught him like that?”
Mary looks at Dean, surprised, though there’s a glint of pride in her eyes. “I will make sure he spends that time reflecting on his actions.” She looks towards the principal, standing up and holding out her hand. “Thank you, sir. Come on, Dean.”
Standing up on shaky legs, Castiel clenches his fists at his sides before an eerie sense of calm filters through his entire system.
, you homophobic asshole.”
It is.
One, that he is underdressed.
Dean looks alarmed. “Sam was with you?”
Feeling his heart tug for the hundredth time tonight, Castiel settles down. He lies on his side, facing Dean, contemplating how he looks during total and complete rest; his smooth brow, soft eyes. Not a single line of worry. He wants to reach out and touch him so badly he nearly shakes with it. Instead he draws the blankets up under his chin, snuggles down, and closes his eyes.
Sam struggles half-heartedly until they make it outside. He pulls out of Dean’s grip and adjusts his backpack and clothes, huffing. “Don’t take out your insecurities on me.”
This is where Dean smiles. “You get your mojo back.”
"I know we did things the wrong way," Dean finally says, "and I'm sorry if you get in trouble. But I wouldn't change anything about it." Shining eyes look towards him. "I… I really did feel safe, Cas. I got to dance, and I got to be… me. So, I'm sorry that you might get reamed, but I'm also- y'know- thank...ful. God, that sounds shitty."
Dean’s melodious laugh carries him through to the desired spot, before he disconnects the call.
“You’re doing that thing with your face,” Sam says.
Castiel and Charlie exchange glances again, this time with their mouths open and eyes wide. Scrubbing a hand over his mouth and scratching at his beard, Castiel looks down at his phone. Sam, it turns out, is just as cryptic as Dean when it comes to answering questions. It’s rather frustrating, but Castiel resolves to not let it get to him as he massages his forehead with two fingers.
in your apartment, Cas, then Michael interfered and sent him back to wherever.
Castiel sees the smirk on his lips. Rolling his eyes, he turns. “Come see me when you’re better, Dean.”
It clicks. Michael is the old john that bothered Dean at work last month or so ago, the one that Castiel had--supposedly--talked Dean out of seeing again. Covering up his surprise by reaching out to take his hand for a shake, Castiel hopes his expression doesn’t betray his bewilderment. “Castiel. He didn’t tell me he was going anywhere.”
“I don’t-” he gasps for breath. “I don’t fuck him, dad. Wanna…” he coughs. “Wanna know what I do?” He can’t see John, unable to fully open his eyes. “I dance." A winded giggle. "On stage. An’ I wear… pretty lingerie…”
“DEAN WINCHESTER.”
“Hey,” he greets, voice rough.
Castiel tilts his head a little, thinking. “Perhaps the best of both worlds would suit you?”
him, just… moving on. And as much as John has fucked up over the years and as many bruises Dean’s had, the man still deserves to know where his kids are going.
Impatiently, Castiel wiggles the knife in his direction. “I know I don’t
Is that thrill related to the danger of being around Dean Winchester, most prolific serial killer in the history of modern man?
“‘Bout three.”
fighting, exchanging blows- the camera fizzes slightly and then refocuses, both Castiel’s and the stranger’s eyes
“I need to know more,” Castiel says, conviction filling his voice. He’s a madman, alone in his apartment, surrounded by printouts and a map tacked up on the wall with red string criss-crossing the length of it. “I need to save Dean Winchester.”
“Ma,” Dean grumbles. “It’ll be fine. I’ve got friends.”
"Your bar is eighteen and up," Dean says, "why're you worried?"
“I can’t crack the code.”
"Sure." Benny looks towards Castiel. "You and I gotta speak, Cas. Privately."
“Already done,” she says, tossing Castiel a finger-gun and a wink. “Hey, you look…? Better? Today?”
“Charlie,” he looks at his best friend, eyes sad and heavy, “this ‘Dean thing’ will never be over.”
“Is it because the ladies you date ask about me?” He folds his arms tightly across his chest, but his biceps and fingers flex, like he wants to open himself back up again, but is stubbornly refusing not to. “They don’t wanna date a dude with a grown kid living at home? Or they don’t wanna date a dude who’s got an unrelated kid living with him? You can tell me it’s weird, Cas,
Dean lets out a curious hum. "Michael's been texting me every day this week."
“Dean,” he says softly.
“That’s because Dean is guilty of killing, but not for the reasons people assume.” Castiel leans back in his chair, frowning at the monitor. “What else do you have on Pamela?”
“Looks good, Cas!” Dean crows, slapping Castiel on the back. Castiel grunts. Dean’s wearing jeans and a comfy red sweater, his face clean and fresh. “I’m heading out.”
John’s eye twitches, his suspicions confirmed. He says nothing.
John raises a brow, before chuckling. "Sorry to interrupt, son. Dinner's ready."
“Gonna be late!” Dean says, grabbing Sam by his backpack to haul him out of the kitchen. “See you later!”
Thankfully the waiter interrupts to take their order. Michael requests what sounds like a complicated salad, whereas Dean clumsily orders a foreign-sounding steak dish. No way in hell is he gonna skimp on this. Michael drips money.
“I know,” Trevor says softly.
Yeah, last night could have gone way worse.
“Ow-!”
“It’s not because of you.” He finally says. “Bobby was right. At my age I want to settle down, not casually date. But the more people I meet, the more I realize that perhaps… I’m not meant to be in another relationship.”
But Dean coming into his life and slotting so easily into the little folds Castiel didn’t even know existed has been a true treat. They’re still independent enough from one another that they function separately, but when they’re together it’s just…
Licking his lips, Castiel manages to get his fingers and hand working enough to grab his glasses out of his shirt pocket and put them on his nose. He’s fidgeting. He hates fidgeting. Dean’s math doesn’t add up. “Why have you had so many close calls with death?”
“I don’t know,” Castiel replies. “I thought he’d been waiting in the alley for me, judging on the way he grabbed me and the direction he pulled me in.”
“Are you going to speak in riddles? Metaphors?” Castiel asks through his teeth. He has to turn his gaze away, Dean glowing too brightly again.
Ash and Benny leave the employee room just as Castiel enters. They pass with grins on their faces, but Castiel is mostly concerned about checking on Dean and making sure he’s alright.
“You’ve had
translate… don’t make sense.”
“I never claimed to be otherwise.”
also hello, your comments welcoming me back literally made me cry. how i've missed you all ♥
“Only on nights I work here,” he replies. “Don’t want my dad to see me comin’ home like this. Stay at a motel, get cleaned up, have a good night’s sleep, then go home before everyone wakes up.”
Michael falls silent. After a beat, he says softly, "No."
Sam’s voice is softer the next time he speaks, “You’ll save him. You were always meant to.”
All in all their tour takes a little over an hour. Touring an art museum is not something Dean would have thought up on his own, nor would have his brother or mom, and he finds his chest aching a little. Now that he’s not on the streets or held down by his dad, there’s an entire world out there for him to explore.
Dean’s grin flashes wider. “You wanna know the whole story because there are missing pieces in it all, right?”
They both exit Dean’s room, walking back to the main living area. Castiel returns to the island and picks up his abandoned bagel, mourning the loss of its warmth but feeling like it was very worth it to help Dean out in such a profound manner. Dean’s pumps clack pleasantly over the floor, Castiel once again reminded of Daphne ready for a night on the town.
“My club is the longest held LGBT club in the city with projections that will last another twenty years, even if other clubs are opened. My club is basically a gay historical landmark. Do you understand the basic culture of the gay community, Dean?”
Sandy hair, big blue eyes, dimples, the sweetest smile. A woman more precious than pearls, hands on her stomach, a ringing voice caught in his ears. Hugs, tears, pride and sadness-
“Get lost, Feathers,” Dean snaps, “or we’ll level you.”
Feeling awkward, Dean brings his coffee up for a sip. They drink their coffee quietly, but at seven Dean can hear his alarm start to go off in the bedroom.
"I still find you very beautiful, Dean. And seeing you… out in the world- you're breathtaking."
She shoves him lightly. “They are all different
The driver’s side door opens. The man that steps out is unfamiliar, handsome in a suit and tie, black hair slicked back and his white smile reflecting the gleam of the snow. Feeling shabby, Castiel clears his throat and swings the shovel up to prop it up over the back of his shoulders.
, dad, and you chose to throw yourself away without even thinkin’ ‘bout
“No-” Castiel idly waves a hand. He sets down his fork, pushing his plate away so he can lace his fingers on the table and level Dean with a firm, but caring gaze. “I meant it when I said your money should be going towards the things that you want.”
Finally able to open his eyes without feeling like they’re going to burn out of his skull, Castiel looks around the bathroom. Nothing is out of order, except for the fact that his steaming-hot water is now tepid. Shifting and reaching for his towel, he pulls it off the rack and mops at his face, his ears registering Charlie’s slightly alarmed voice.
It’s on a sunny spring day, Sam’s birthday behind them, that Dean and Kevin are jogging leisurely around the track. The sun is warm on their heads and shoulders, their pace even with one another and their breaths barely labored.
?” Dean repeats incredulously, eyes meeting Castiel’s as amusement laces his words. “You work for
“Dean.” Castiel stands up, gently putting his hands on Dean’s shoulders and giving them an affectionate squeeze. “If your date doesn’t show you off to every person in the gallery, then he doesn’t deserve you.”
“How do you know when he’ll be back?”
crazy?” Blue eyes cut to Dean, stealing his breath. “Or is
“Do we have to go in?” Sam’s tiny voice breaks through the chaos in Dean’s head. It’s a relief, his little brother asking that question, because Dean had been wondering the same.
Kevin wilts a little. “I, um. When your face is all clean, I have some makeup…” he trails off.
“Yeah?” Dean perks. He sits up a little, looking across the table at Sam, who can hear Castiel without the speaker on because Dean’s shitty phone has the reverb of a tin can. Sam’s got a smirk on his face.
--*--
Dean has passed all of his evaluations with flying colors.
Sometimes when Castiel comes out of a memory-dream, it feels as though he’s died and come back to life. The sensation of his eyes burning from the inside out, white-hot…
Dean shakes his head violently, Castiel’s fingers losing purchase on his shoulders. “I can do it. Gotta have my first performance in front of people sometime, right?” He says, mostly convincing himself.
He shifts a little uncomfortably. “I mean, I guess.”
And yet…
Opening the door to the bedroom, Dean pokes his head out. The smell of coffee hits him first, his bladder hits him second. He crosses the hall to relieve himself, then washes his hands and ambles down the hall on bare feet. Castiel’s floors aren’t carpeted but they feel oddly warm. Huh. Maybe he has the heater turned way up.
“Jennifer,” she says.
"You don't have to be good," Castiel says, sitting back in his chair as he regards Dean. His eyes are so intense, Dean only just notices the spectacles resting on his nose, the lenses catching the light and reflecting it. "You just have to enjoy it."
,” she laughs.
"I feel like your sugar baby, but without the sex."
Apparently some pervert reaching between the cage bars to grab at him is a breaker.
“Anyway, the closest hit I got was a language called Enochian. Now… for some reason, Google is
"I own a bar," the man says before Dean leaves the safety of the umbrella. "Come dry out."
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean finally takes a bite of food.
should be disclosed to me.”
Their laughter dies when they see their dad parked in a space that isn’t even a parking spot, pacing back and forth in front of the car. When he sees them he darts forward, the look on his features that of a haunted man.
Sighing, Benny grips Castiel’s bicep. “Brother, I’ll tell ya til’ I’m blue in the face: this ain’t your fault. None of it is. Not knowing he’s eighteen, bringin’ him home to his drunk daddy, him bein’ a prostitute or any of that. It ain’t. Your. Fault. And I’ll tell y’again: he’s damn lucky you were there to call the police when you knew something was wrong.”
Castiel frowns a little. “Our president is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.”
John Winchester dies, but America’s problems continue to get solved.
Pulling away, Michael frowns at Dean, now fully awake. “What?”
It’s not home, he thinks to himself.
He dreams of Dean dying, of Dean being resurrected, which is nothing new.
“Cas?”
“Really.” Color Castiel impressed. He wasn’t sure that Dean’s passion for dancing would take him out into the public eye. He can’t help but smile wide. “I think that’s wonderful.”
“What do the encrypted messages say?”
He dreams of Sam, soft smiles and joking laughter. That’s new.
“Not that kind of talk,” she says softly. They get into the car, Dean wishing she had cushy seats instead of the weird leather stuff. He’s still in his gym clothes and his skin is sticking to the seats uncomfortably. She doesn’t start the car. He turns his head to look at her, curious and confused. “Well- sort of like that. Do you… do you know what being gay is, Dean?”
“I was a hooker, Cas.”
One and a half months until Dean will be executed.
“Mm, yes,” Daphne replies, mock-thoughtfully, “but blue is also very calming and palatable at three a.m. when he wakes up screaming and needs a diaper change.”
Some memories are hard to parse. Sometimes when he sleeps it’s just… black. Goo and tar, endless, deep black, no sound, no light. Other times there’s so much light and laughter his heart feels as though it will burst. Dean’s laugh, Sam’s laugh, and another laugh he can’t really place… but one just as lovely and comforting.
He’s been shut up in his room studying since Dean announced that Michael would be coming over. He doesn’t like Michael. He doesn’t like his slick hair and icy eyes and his peacocking. He especially doesn’t like how he treats Dean. Castiel doesn’t think he’s
But this…
“Stop at the liquor store,” John says, startling Dean slightly. He points at a strip mall.
He makes his way through the prison by memory alone. Victor is standing guard at the door when he reaches it.
“Crowley offers benefits,” Castiel says.
“...Cas… Cas… Cas!”
Smearing a hand over his face and into his hair, Castiel shrugs. “Enough.”
Grinning mischievously, Dean shrugs and takes a sip of cocoa, licking the froth from his lips. "So you stopped bein' a priest and opened up a gay bar."
. I was just a kid. Didn’t know what I wanted.” He puts his elbow on the table and rests his chin on his clean hand, turning his gaze out the sliding back door to Castiel’s neatly manicured lawn. “I kinda feel a little overwhelmed with the freedom.”
Turning his hand over to lace their fingers, something new lights him up from the inside out. “I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else.”
His ear pops and he winces, scrunching his shoulder up as a weird ringing starts echoing in his head. “Agh.”
“Hello, Mr. Winchester. My name is Castiel Novak.”
The snow had stopped falling a while ago, the sky a crisp blue, the air frigid. The man holds a hand out, “My name’s Michael. I’m here to pick up Dean.”
“Ok,” the nurse says. He reaches down to help Castiel up by his elbow, guiding him out of the emergency room waiting room and down a few different hallways. The room he lets Castiel into is quiet, occupied by only one other person, who has a backpack and a pillow and the chairs arranged so she can lie down. She barely moves when they enter. The nurse sits Castiel down, then squats in front of him like a parent to a child. “I’ll let Dr. Barnes know you’re in here. I do recommend you call
“Alright,” Castiel replies, not wanting to agitate Dean. “My room is on the other side of the kitchen. If you need anything-”
Dean hangs on him like a barnacle, hooting out, “Our savior!”
“Home,” Dean repeats, putting the car in gear and pulling back onto the road.
“I am,” Dean says, adjusting the strap of his bag.
He catches up on the basics.
Dean puts his palms on the table, narrowing his eyes. “You’re straight.”
“Oh, I had a type,” Dean says casually. “Every single thing I killed was my type.”
After doing his own brushing up on this supposed Enochian language, Castiel tells Charlie to print out a test page of the code for him. His eyes had fuzzed out while looking at the screen, so maybe he just needs less screen time in general? It would explain his splitting migraines and his vision going hazy at strange times. He must have hit his threshold for being in front of digital screens. He should have bought those expensive blue light glasses he’d seen at the store a few weeks ago.
“What—happened in here? Cas, are these yours?” Dean indicated the black tufts all around him.
performance down because he couldn’t get his shit together.
SO, existentially tired: Oh my god.
“You should not have meddled,” Light reprimanded Darkness as they hovered outside the very fabric of space and time, watching their creations.
The obscenity sounded inexplicably sacred in Dean’s roughened voice. Castiel rewarded it with a soft bite to his lower lip.
Just when Castiel was sure he was going to burst, Dean released him and raised himself slightly again. For a moment he was still, hands braced on Castiel’s chest and eyes roving over Castiel’s prone form.
Wait staff moved near-silently between the guests, the black of their uniforms camouflaging against the heavy velvet curtains lining two of the four walls, making them almost imperceptible save for the occasional flash of their silver trays in the low light. Clusters of lit candles cast long shadows across the tables they adorned, their ornate holders dripping with strings of glittering gems.
Castiel approached, willing himself to ignore the anxious tremble in his limbs. “No thank you,” he declined, taking a seat closer to Hannah than he normally would have. If she noticed the lessened distance between them, she made no comment.
“What’s wrong with you? You look like Rio just caught you masturbating to her picture.”
Once Sam’s burger had been appropriately trimmed he brought both plates and two beers over to the table. Sam scooted slightly away from the books and leaned over his plate for his first bite, sparing the ancient texts from the grease.
“‘Lo?” Sam’s tired voice greets. It’s after eleven.
He says repeatedly and insistently that this time is different because they have Castiel.
The door clangs, leaving Castiel alone in a sealed room with a murderer.
It’s pretty much business as usual, just without the impending doom of John getting pissed about something or other and taking it out on them. In fact it’s downright domestic fuckin’ bliss. Sam’s back to his usual smiley, obnoxious self, no longer sequestering himself in his bedroom to work on homework or play video games. The living room? Fucking
(See the end of the chapter for
He makes it to the hospital in eight minutes. He parks in guest parking, speed walks into the entrance, and gives his name to the nurse there. She offers a slightly tense smile, then makes a call and points towards the one-way doors. He stands next to them, hands shoved in the pockets of his jeans, sucking his lips between his teeth. His skin is hot. He’s flushed, the back of his neck sweating and curling the hair there. The doors open, a nurse confirms his identity, and then he’s led through the maze of hallways. Everything is sanitary and impersonal, the nurses and doctors buzzing around like bees in a hive, everyone knowing their exact purpose at that exact time.
