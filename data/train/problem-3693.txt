Then again, he’d read that book a while ago - maybe the market had changed in the meantime. The French currency is known to be fickle and change constantly. Dior could simply be out of the loop. It wouldn’t be the first time his knowledge would prove lacking.
“Is there anything I can do? I - I could bring you some medicine tomorrow? I hear there is a new herb blend on the market, perhaps that-”
And then he continues to weep, all the way to his room.
One of the older alpha foreigners from Prussia speaks up next, “You are not wrong, Prince Castiel. But I do feel like this will be a matter of home affairs for the King and his court once the treaties have been signed,” he says, pleasantly enough that Castiel could miss the carefully guarded irritation.
- before replying. “No harm done,” he says, happy to hear his voice is unwavering and takes a sip of his tea that is bigger than what is considered polite. Were his mother here, there would be some scathing squints involved.
He half-turns toward a small hallway and straightens his arm toward it, “Could you follow me, please?” he asks Dior.
- she’s absolutely wonderful. She’s warmth in winter and comfort in sorrow. She deserves more and if Dior can somehow give it to her? He’ll do whatever it takes.
“Liar!” Dior whisper-yells, tugging on his arm more forcefully than earlier, both of their bodies swaying perilously to the side. “What was that, then? Sounded like a laugh a
Dior turns his head back toward him lightning-quick, but Cas is quicker in turning his in the completely opposite direction, coughing what must be a

about him. Ever since the death of his wife, he has become a recluse,” Alastair scoffed. “To make such a fuss over the death of one beta. There are thousands more willing bodies out there to warm his bed.”
“Open about their sexualities? Needs? Animal nature?” Balthazar offered and Castiel shrugged. “It’s very different for escorts and prostitutes here, my friend. Completely legal, tolerated and more than encouraged. It is seen as a way of life, some might even call it a necessity for societal entertainment. Those two…” he nods his head in the direction of the courtesans “...are some of the most expensive and reputable escorts Paris has to offer.”
Yay, second chapter!!!
“Please, it is no trouble,” the prince says, arms back to hanging next to his body. “Is your head still troubling you? Do you require anything else?”
The streets are eerily hushed to him now - no far away steps on cobblestones to be heard, no owl in the distance hooting, no grunts from around dark corners. It’s leaving him on edge - he feels as if on a shop’s display with a big sign that says “come-hither” on his forehead and no defense mechanisms.
He huffs and buries his head in the crook of his elbow, the smile now a giddy grin.
Dior opens his eyes, lowers his legs sideways and grabs the box in both of his palms once again. He’s been doing this every morning before clients and every night after. It was a ritual of sorts, maybe. To reassure himself that it did happen, maybe.
“Me too, Balt.” Castiel agreed. Of course, he hated everything to do with social gatherings but that part is always particularly unpleasant.
Promise we're getting a LOAD of Cas and D next chapter. This one's all angst on top of angst but we're getting to the comfort part.
giggling about to such a degree?” he asked and all of them turned towards him excitedly.
” Jesse asks, no longer on guard. If anything, he looks quite sentimental, and were it not for how his fingers are intertwined with his husband’s, Cas might have felt the surge of the possessiveness that has started to creep into his personality lately.
“No, of course not,” the omega says. “It’s just unusual - Rococo has been out of style for a while - I, myself, prefer the more simplistic design of Neoclassicism.”
“Could I ask a favour of you, if it’s not too much?” Dior asked, continuing after the alpha had nodded. “Is it possible to also have a dictionary? Just so I have something to check if I find a word I am not accustomed to.”
“Nonsense. You must realise your manners are impeccable, Dior. And without proper lessons, too. Quite the feat. I am impressed and you should be confident,” Cain said. “However, if it makes you feel better, I can have you visit me a few days this coming week for some lessons.”
Alastair snagged his waist tightly and leaned his face into his own, his pungent ash smell cloying the air. “Continue this beguilement and you might find yourself in danger,
“Regardless, I do feel like I have come short of entertaining you,” Castiel laments.
. Entertaining patrons at private gatherings was the best way of attracting good paying customers and Crowley always encouraged them to do so.
Dior is quick to nip this in the bud, huddling closer to Castiel once again, “No - no. He had found himself with a free room on the first floor and offered it for the duration of my heat. I paid him off by doing household chores for a month.”
It doesn’t take long for the burning to mold into a stale, wet smell, resignation filling his entire body. This isn’t the time or the place - not that it ever is. Omegas aren’t meant to talk back - they’re meant to listen and agree prettily. Meant to have their lights dimmed and dreams shattered before they even learn what they are.
“What do you mean she volunteered? Crowley never lets us go in town for his errands,” he asks, a strain to his voice.
He couldn’t have known it would feel so… So empty. It was not his to begin with and yet this hole threatened to drown him and never let him go. Dior thought he might as well let it do as it wishes.
Notes:
Next, he looked up a Christmas tree nursery. The problem was Castiel flatly refused a cut one and apparently, that’s all they did around these parts. What happened to getting a potted tree and nurturing it beyond the holiday?
The subtle vibration of agitation that was under his skin turns hostile and he can feel a low growl ready to take form at the back of his throat - except the person it wants to be directed at is not in the room and it would only cause distress. And so he swallows, puts his gloves in his pocket and closes the distance between the two of them.
The carriage is turned toward a road that is much less illuminated and uneven, immediately feeling the difference in movement, despite the carriage’s bountiful padding. Weirdly fascinated with what appears to be more activity than even the main road, Castiel does not tear his eyes away from the window, palm still mindlessly patting the blanket.
“Well, yes, she does. But that is back home where my faults are easily concealable-” Castiel says, attempting to placate his friend by closing his fingers slowly over his bicep.
“Seeing a magpie. It is a nice reminder that we are not that far from England, I suppose,” Castiel supplies, only mildly amused that he would feel reassured in any capacity about being close to the palace.
Lisa scoffs good-naturedly, “You know that’s not what I meant.”
A couple of lampposts away, the lone figure under the flickering light is not so alone. It is dark and they are far away at first so the prince is only able to separate three different people; two men and a woman.
?” he asks, his confusion evident.
The beta watches him, poised and serene, scentless bliss. She moves her hand slowly towards the box and Dior almost indulges in the dumb reflex of taking them out of her way, back into his pocket.
Prince Castiel stepped around the chair, coming face to face with Dior. His heart was pounding in his ears with the alpha so close to him and having his undivided attention. He realised the Prince was a few centimeters shorter than Dior, giving him a lovely perspective of his face.
Still nothing.
“I see. It seems very... practical.”
He doesn’t want to react like this, fuck. His body is moving on its own, mind left behind like forgotten lovers.
That is the least of Dior’s worries right now. His mind is on Lisa and the knowledge nobody’s seen her today. Weighing his options, he decides this can’t be hidden from Crowley - better tell him first before he finds out when it gets to Lisa’s turn, which is only third in line.
“No,” Dior growls again, deeper this time, which seems to grab the alpha’s attention.
“Castiel? Why did you-”
. Sleep well?”
. And yet...Cain did. It took a while, but after the fifth meeting, Dior realised he was a lonely man who needed some sort of companionship that was not driven by anything else except a simple transaction. He’d learned a lot in the time he’d met up with Cain. The man enjoyed talking about his hobbies and was excited to teach Dior how to properly defend himself with a small knife.
His breath fragments, wretched, loud puffs filling his ears, his head fuzzy and ears ringing - the world becomes unbalanced. How can something that was so unbalanced to begin with becomes even more so? When will he stop being surprised that life can and will get shittier? When will he stop his worthless, unneeded hope from catching roots in the depths of his bones?
“I did not come here for a spouse or to fornicate, Balt! Whether the Princess finds me attractive or not, it does not change anything. It is not in my interest or hers. Besides, you know I don’t…” Castiel rubbed at his temples tiredly but did not finish his sentence. It appears he did not have the patience for his friend’s antics today.
, every pore is screaming, counterpart howling, heart piercing.
“When?” he asks.
, Lis! If
If Dior would not be smelling serene right about now, Cas might be worried that he was angry.
first floor of the
Dior falls silent for a second before he stutters out his unsure response, “Uh, no - uh, a suit would be warmer.”
“Now you're being obnoxious just for the sake of being difficult,” Balt chuckles. “Come. I will call for our coats and we can take a stroll through the back gardens.”
Telling Lisa all of this isn’t going to do anything but bring her more grief. He stops his pacing and closes his eyes, hands finding their way behind his neck and squeezing. There has to be something - anything - he can do. Dior knows he’s useless, that there’s nothing he’s particularly good at, he’s got no money,
“Cas, please-” another gasping sob, “Please make it stop, alpha.”
There are nine pieces in there, either square, round or oval in neatly built compartments surrounded by the same golden fabric as the bow. They’re lighter brown than the usual sweets he sees in the passing of a sweetshop. Some of them are sprinkled with flakes, others have swirling designs on them - they’re delicate looking.
“I-I am unsure. We were chatting normally and the next moment he was on the floor, howling in pain, clutching at his head,” Dr. Sunders replies, voice wavering. “The symptoms point to a migraine but I’ve never witnessed such a severe one.”
Right - let's get on with this, shall we?
The prince flushes even deeper and the other alpha frowns at him suspiciously. “Yes - quite cold,” Castiel coughs and does not face his friend.
They pass Castiel’s carriage, the driver shouting after them but not following. All for the better - Cas is in no state of being around anyone else right now, not even betas.
“Your next appointment is in the waiting room. Stop grinning like a cretin and go get ready,
have created and instilled into their omegas.
Castiel flushed at his friend’s crass comment. “Must you always fluster me so?” He tugged at his waistcoat in an attempt to smooth out his nerves, perhaps.
Dior stares at her and then at Aiden, who is sitting a step behind her with a concerned expression. He tries sniffing both of them, ignoring the noises of offense.
His fingers twitch. Making up his mind, he sits up straight, puts the box back on the table and carefully undoes the bow. It comes apart smoothly, like water flowing from a jug and pooling elegantly around the box. Dior opens the lid before he can change his mind.
The fabric of his shirt is tight across his muscles, a vivid image of Dior pushing against those same arms bursting forth. He feels himself pinking when he remembers the way Cas felt under his fingertips, straining to get away from his grasp, the instinctual need to violently harm a threat bursting from his every hard line.
How could you miss someone you haven’t ever met? Castiel feels like he had been missing this man his whole life - he just did not have the words to explain that longing until this moment. It feels like the green of his eyes had always popped into his dreams - only to be forgotten upon waking, but leaving behind this hopeless need.
“Hey there, McDreamy!” she greeted, letting her hand fall from his coat.
doctor prescribed them to me because of my migraines,” Dior rants, seemingly going through a mental checklist.
The older woman’s smile slips and she skips the pleasantries, straightening out her back, “What happened to you, boy? Look at the state of you.”
“Three days. You promised,” the omega says.
Silence again, this time the only sound is their combined breathing, scents mingling. Cinnamon explodes in a flurry of spice, affecting the prince’s pulse in a foreign way that travels from his chest to his belly, down his groin, and to his toes. All he can hear is a cacophony of his own mortality. Of his humanity being affected by Dior.
The other man threads his hands reverently through the fur, marvelling at its thickness. He tugs the fabric over his waist and halfway up his abdomen, holding it close to his body from underneath.
And so he’d let them touch and grope but never given them too much freedom. If they’d want to bend him over and have their ways with him, then they’d have to seek him out another day at the
Kelly appreciated life. She loved everything with a fierceness he’d always envied, from her favourite pair of socks to Jack. She would’ve gone above and beyond for his every little milestone.
Why is he always so incredibly
“I-” the omega gulps. “I took a
A transaction, in its most simple form.
. Which was stupid, there is nothing for him to be excited about. As a precaution, he takes a deep sniff of the air around them but cannot smell anything out of the ordinary. Just the common scents you would find in such a crowded place, and yet he turns his head in other directions, as if he is
“You’re lying to me, sugar, and the only reason I’m not cooking that ass of yours is because Lisa has been waiting all day for you.”
Castiel chooses not to mention he was not referring to the clothes - it is obvious Dior would rather take the attention away from himself, and if that is what he wishes to do, then the alpha shall follow his lead.
When she spots Dior approaching her, she lowers her volume and addresses him directly, “
“I am sure that is not true - I already know you have weird tastes in architecture,” the alpha replies.
The winding staircase feels somehow much taller than the last time he had gone up. His heart accelerating, a frenzy in his chest. Castiel half-worries that Dior might appear before him in the same state of undress as last time - a thought which impedes his breathing. However, he is resolute to turn his head away this time, as it is the only proper thing to do. The prince would hate himself if he hurt the omega’s dignity in any way.
“No need to be worried - Caesar doesn’t bite, I promise,” Jesse says, returning through the door he left.
He had also learned that if Prince Castiel was confused or uncertain, he tilted his head to the side in what must have been the most endearing motion mankind has to offer. He squinted his eyes slightly, a small frown on his lips and slight line between his brows. Dior’s fingers twitched, wanting to smooth out the crease every time it appeared.
wrong with you, Cassie,” he declares, conviction in both his voice and eyes. He burns with it.
The full-bodied shivering that ceases not, the paleness of the omega’s skin underneath the unnatural burning red splattered across the expanse of his face and ears. The tiny sniffles he makes, as if to try and hide them from being discovered. Dior’s neck is all but exposed, the only thing between it and the biting cold of the evening being a ridiculously thin scarf.
Dread suffocates him, “No-no-no-NO! Don’t- don’t-”
Castiel thinks back to the time in his childhood before he ever presented and became a source of inconvenience for his family - instead of another mark of pride. Mike and Luci would spend most of their time together with their nannies and tutors, Gabriel would be off causing trouble to the kitchen maids, and Castiel… Well, he was attached to his mother’s hip.
The silence stretches between them uncomfortably as the carriage rattles softly around them. It is suffocating and it is the alpha’s turn to lose his tongue - words escaping him, for what good are words when even his actions are insufficient?
“We do not wish to take too much of your time,” Castiel says. “I was informed that you work mainly with sewing machines, is that correct?”
"Ah, yes. You know just what to say to get me going, dearest." Balthazar laughed, throwing his head back. "I might have to abandon you once in a while whilst I… Ah,
“Just say the words. I will comply. I will give
Instead, he basks in giving good night embraces and pecks, wishes on top of wishes and none are for him. And that’s alright - he doesn’t need any.
. I have to say, I did not expect you would need it. You are very well spoken, but if you will find it helpful, I am more than happy to provide one for you,” Cain said, simply sipping his coffee.
He takes a fortifying breath.
” Crowley barked.
“Oh, Dior!
. For you to teach me some more of the games. I am sure my friend would be thrilled to see I am taking initiative to be less of ‘a stick in the mud’”.
I love her, BTW!!! Her fic "Patient Love" is one of my favourites and I will literally GUSH about how beautiful it is to anyone who wants to listen. Give that a read if you're a fan of AUs in which there's angst and comfort galore.
He can’t go on one more fucking day.
Fingers dig further into his curls and Cas gives a small growl. It causes a shiver to work all over him.
Castiel has never felt a more intense need to touch someone.
He’s barely able to stand up but Princess Abbadon has him in a tight vice, bringing their faces close together. Dior’s gut rolls again once it catches a whiff of liquorice from her. She grabs both his cheeks in her other clawed hand.
“We’re not far off, just another turn. I like keeping them in sections.” Dean says, starting up the conversation again.

"Dear me, Cassie. We need to work on your
Where should he start? The accessories would be better off being pawned, but it’s better to leave that last. It’s the other items he needs to get rid of quickly. He scans the crowd for an empty spot where he can lay out his wares, head bobbing each and every way, trying to scan the crowd whilst keeping out of anyone’s way. The last thing he needs is an alpha to accost him in the middle of the day.
to. He needed to feel this - this divinity - or he would most definitely perish, never to be consoled again.
Only five minutes into their drive back, the driver stops and knocks twice before opening the little door connecting his seat and the inside of the carriage.
“What?” he asks dumbly.
Stepping through the kitchen door, he is surprised to find everyone already at the table, eating what appears to be scrambled eggs. The sound of the rusty hinges catches everyone’s attention and he is met with nine pairs of eyes, all in different stages of grogginess.
He did wake up with the first light of dawn and did not waste much time before alerting the servants of his wakefulness. Whilst waiting for his housemaid to arrive, Castiel rose from his bed and shivered when he emerged from the warm safety of his duvets and blankets. If he hurried, he’d have had the time to start his own fire, but alas, such was not his luck this morning come.
“It has been this way for centuries, Sergei. The data will rebalance once the population recovers from the war,” Castiel snips, “Not only that, but betas are simply biologically unable to mate - that is by no means their fault and it would be unethical to put them at disadvantage for something they cannot control.”
and wished his scent would make up for it. He laughed to himself, thinking of how many other palace rules must exist because some member of the family needed their ego stroked.
Dior finally manages to rip his eyes away from Cas’ heated ones, choosing instead to appraise the cape. He takes a hand out of the muff and lets it sink into the fluffy strands of fur. “I have to agree - they are perfect. I didn’t think it was possible for anything to be softer than the blanket you brought,” he huffs a small laugh. “I was proven wrong, of course.”
“I do not care much for antiquated and degrading omega etiquette.”
They do not speak when Cas leans forward to unwind the scarf from around Dior’s neck. Nor do they speak as he takes his time pulling each finger of the gloves off fair fingers. The prince deposits both accessories on the back of the couch then cups one of Dior’s hands in his, fingers gently massaging the warmth around, then switching to the other hand. The alpha repeats this process over and over, the two of them exchanging quiet looks.
There is no need for Castiel to think about it - he was expecting this question, “Snowdrops.”
“You did mention last time we came across each other that no one at the
But then it’s like heaven cracked and let him slip out because everything is pure
“Yeah,” is all Dior can muster, along with a weak nod, not taking his head off the pillow.
“We’re going to have a busy day tomorrow, Jack.” He told the infant whilst strapping him in his car seat. “We’ll go around town, buy pretty things to put around the house and maybe go to the zoo. What do you say?”
It’s been about three and a half years since he’d started working for Crowley and about two of being on the top floor. He’s had quite a few clients give him things along the years: creams, powders, herb jars, accessories, even rouge once… Along with a request of using the items on their next visit. It was always bittersweet - being given a gift but feeling like it was never really meant for
“It’s all ready for you, Your Highness. I have paid great care to have it at your desired 40 degrees.” She announced, shaking Castiel from his work. He allowed himself a small smile. Hannah had been personally attending to him for the past year and has learned all of his quirks and preferences with amazing speed.
"Quite. I am looking forward to seeing France with my own two eyes. You have done a good job of raising expectations. I do hope you're ready to face them, now." Castiel teased.
He had given up after a year of praying with no success. It would appear Castiel was to be
“I used to sneak into my mother’s sleeping chamber and wake her up at dawn,” he says and they stop in front of a statue depicting a sitting adult with three children around him, focused on the book he is holding. Castiel brings his hand to the nearest shrub and starts rubbing one of its leaves free of snow, then continues his way to the nearest one and repeats the process.
“I know,” he almost whispers. “Listen, Lis, I- I can’t really stay.”
Aiden startles, caught by surprise, “But I’m only fourth in line. Isn’t it Li-”
“I still do not know what you mean,” he replies, their bodies unconsciously leaning marginally toward each other.
They headed out of his room together, Alfie two steps behind. He opened the door to the dining hall for Castiel and bowed. Castiel saw his parents and oldest siblings already sitting, enjoying cups of tea, and chatting about this morning’s newspaper.
!” she hisses, pushing his face to the side harshly. “I think you need to relearn your lesson about how to treat what is mine, omega.”
“Well. This is not quite the greeting I expect from my useless pet when I come to visit,” the Crown Princess croons, deadly sweet.
Finally, after what had seemed like decades, guests started arriving, some slowly trickling into the parlour. Everyone appeared to be in a jolly mood and he prayed a silent ‘

The omega shuffles on the sofa uncertainly before he answers, more a question than a reply, “Coffee, please, and thank you,
He thought of Jack’s mum. Kelly was… she was the brightest star in the inky blackness of their family. Where they were all standoffish, she was pliant. Where he was cold and calculated, she was warm and excitable.
This train of thought is close to being obliterated when the prince starts catching whiffs of immense nervousness. However, there is also a heavy feeling of expectation mixed in and - to his absolute delight - awe.
Dior seems amused by this and Castiel cannot help but admire the couturier’s honesty.
The alpha’s fingers tighten around the fabric, “That is ridiculous! I am your-” a swallow, “Your customer. It does not seem like a good business model to refuse me.”
The prince knows this really is not the time, yet he cannot help but feel a surge of affection for his dearest friend at that moment. “I appreciate you saying that, Balt. However, you do not need to try and soothe me. I have come to terms with my failings - I wish you did, too.”
He’s been the one to turn it, he should know.
Dr. Sunders doesn’t go straight to his dick this time, opting to check his ears and nostrils instead. He exhales a small, relieved breath.
With the swamping scent gone, his mind seemed to have started dehazing itself. What had just transpired? Had the Third Prince of England finally gone mad, just like half of the country believed he would? Had his brain finally decided it had enough and decided to shut down, leaving him prey to his instincts? He didn’t know what had just happened.
“Uhm, yes, of course,” the alpha manages to reply, eyes still focused on the taller man in front of him.
Cas forms tight fists at his side, his arms shaking minutely. Sour honey and burning paper itch Dior’s nose and he wonders if telling him all of this is wise. But he dismisses that thought because the more the prince gets to know, the more he’ll want to stay away.
Castiel was decidedly not on his way there, knowing what he does now about them, but he would follow this omega to the ends of the Earth. All he need do is ask, and he will receive. “I - Yes. I appear to have lost my way, to my great embarrassment,” he replied, chastising himself for talking before filtering his response. He did not want to be thought of as a lascivious alpha who looks to moisten their member as much as possible.
He thought of all of those things as he bid goodnight to
Chancing a look back at the center of his interest, - excitement throbbing in his ears to see the effects his display had caused - he was very quickly disheartened to find no splendid blue looking in his direction. It took a while to locate him in a far corner of the room, conversing with a sandy blond man, throwing easy smiles and small laughs his way, as if they were a commodity.
It did not take long for Meg to find her way to Castiel’s side, much too close for his comfort. He could smell an almost overbearing aroma of jasmine. He grabbed another drink off a waiter’s tray and drank half of the amount in one go.
He doesn’t dwell - he can’t afford to right now. He rolls the window up as carefully as he can, the frame mercifully quiet. He pokes his head out of the open window to survey the alley, looking left and right then down. It’s a very shallow drop, the window low enough to make it easy to climb in without even having to jump. With no one in sight, he heaves himself out easily and quickly closes the window back down.
The omega bestowed upon him a small grin and the grip on his heart lessened. He was
Blood rushes from the prince’s face. He hurries after his friend and hopes nobody is eavesdropping on their conversation. The smell of snow is very potent and cleans out everything else, including the scent of any bypassers. Funnily enough, that alone helps to keep his head on his shoulders and not lose his temper.
So, of course, he doesn’t come up to bring reminders. On any other day, it wouldn’t matter. Dior is at least competent enough to keep track of important information.
doors.
The young servant gave a bow and a short ‘of course’ before heading off for their drinks. Alastair gave him what was supposed to be a gratified look, maybe, but looked near grotesque on his face. “And they say all prostitutes are stupid. It is good to know you can remember the simplest of things, such as your client’s preferred drink.”
“Have you not looked in the mirror this morning, Marvin? I dare say the reason we haven’t heard wildlife tonight is that you’ve scared them off.” Alastair replied, getting up as well, taking Dior with him and slapping his rear. “Omega, I will go and associate myself for another half an hour. Get yourself ready to leave before then, we’ll be returning to your
Lisa nods again, understanding and gratitude leaking into her beautiful features, this time less tense, and begins to unbutton her dress, slips out of her shoes. Dior smiles, happy that he hadn’t skipped his nightly bath yesterday, which meant this tub of water should be mostly clean but still carrying his smell potently.
and as he bathed. When in bed, surrounded by his blanket and listening to the crackling of his fireplace, he thought about how it was all probably a dream and he had finally gone mad.
tell me anything about yourself?”
. I didn't sleep well last night, tiredness must be the cause.”
He helps her out of the tub, takes his own robe off, and slips Lisa’s arm through the sleeves. At her quizzical look, he tells her “To cover your scent with mine as much as possible,” and leaves it at that. He sits her on the bed and runs back downstairs to her room, returning the items he took earlier.
“You’re doing it again, Cas,” the omega says, gaze intense.
“His Majesty has been incredibly accommodating in regards to France’s impressive resources,” Balt says, joining the conversation. “I will say that I am eager to see the franc increase in value - hopefully it will enable higher import of non-native goods and produce.”
?” he heard his mate say. No, not his mate, he painfully reminded himself. The omega - as sublime as he was - did not solicit such desires from Castiel. He would not burden this flawless soul with his unwanted longing to press his nose against the omega’s collar and immerse all senses in the glorious scent.
? He’s not better off than her, he’s still getting fucked by alphas and betas every day in order to keep living. How is he supposed to be of any use to her when he’s useless by definition?
Foil -  a sword with a light, flexible blade of rectangular cross-section tapering to a blunt point.
The sound resonating in Castiel’s ears must either be his soul trying to rip itself out of its muscle and bone cage - otherwise he cannot explain the intense anguish ebbing out in violent bursts through his veins. For the first time since he has met Dior, he does what his wolf has been begging him to do-

“As expected of our little brother, Michael! Are you sure you sleep enough at night? Sometimes I worry you’ve become one of those machines I’ve seen in some of the new factories.” Lucius laughs but nobody joins.
He leans over to stroke her head and places a quick kiss on her hair this time, “I’m going to grab some of your things from your room,” he says. At her panicked look, he hurries to shush her, “Hey, hey. It’s okay - Nobody’s going to be on the floor, they’re downstairs.”
Dior thinks he hears shuffling behind him and then there’s a body at his side - his vision too blurry to see and his body in too much agony to concentrate on anything but the crippling, unrelenting
The second floor consisted of 4 double rooms that didn’t have a sitting room like his did, but had a small water closet. The first floor had 6 single rooms without an en-suite. The comfort of the decor and the furniture was also degrading in quality as you descended, the paint peeling here and there, beds creaking, floors scratched. The ground floor was lavish as you entered, gleaming white and gold with polished floors and a huge, dark cherry hardwood desk at the front where Crowley directed all of the clients to the desired room or into the waiting area if they were after a prostitute that was otherwise currently occupied. Crowley prided himself in the fact that his establishment was very quickly becoming amongst the top
“Someone should tell him he’s barking up the wrong tree.” He quipped and his friend laughed.
There is a lot of symbolism scattered around this chapter - I offer brownie/any-other-snack-you-like points to anyone able to tell me what some (if not all!) are <3
“Cassie! Good morning. Why, don’t you look dashing?” Balthazar smiles widely.
He gets ready to be used and bruised - to be what he’s always been meant to. He dons a beautiful red corset and stockings and he sneers - what a waste of precious fabric, what a disappointment to be draped over pasty skin and stains unseen.
“Yes - whatever is in trend, whatever colour works best for him. Accessories, too,” Castiel pays Dior’s protests no heed.
touching - and rolling his head the other way.
He is loath to wake up the sleeping man - when was the last time he has gotten proper rest? From the angle he is currently in, the circles under his eyes are deeper - running further than  skin-deep.
He slowly dragged his hands away from the warm body, a motion that was immensely difficult. For a second Dior thought the alpha was about to touch him back, but he knew better than to trust his brain right now. “
The world dissolves from a blurry mess, becoming a swirl of colours and nothing more. No shapes, no lights, no structure.
“Uh, maybe still in bed?” Chrissie offers.
Castiel has to think about it for a second before he replies. He wonders how much of his family’s details he ought to share with outsiders. It is a thought that saddens him because, reckless as it might be, he trusts this man blindly and faithfully. The last thing he wants is for anyone to find out Castiel has shared confidential details with him and get him accused of espionage.
“Not a lot,” Dior replies and his face starts flushing when he continues, “I was, uh, taught by a - a
. His breath hitched as his mind whispered one single thing:
Dean was an enigma right now. Details of his life and the journey he’s been on in order to arrive at the destination - which was the most inviting, gentle, and intriguing person - were unknown to him.
“I understand.”
“How much will this cost? For the two weeks?” he asks before he can get ahead of himself.
to be cosy. But then he’d taken a whiff of honey and old books, and an uncommon tightness gathered in his lower abdomen. He’s felt this pressure sometimes with his clients, if they happened to hit a particular spot, but mostly only ever felt it during his heats.
“You are,” he reiterates. “You are the most wonderful person I have ever met - of any gender, status or age. You are so special, Dior.”
Dior felt his heart clench painfully. Would he ever find someone to love him to that extent? No, of course not. Who would want a filthy, used whore for a mate when there are so many other omegas much better than him? He had nothing to offer anyone. Even his body was not his anymore. He tried his best not to let his thoughts put him in a bad mood. He wanted to enjoy today, fuck. This wasn’t the time to get depressed.
He knew, he just
“In another five days’ time?” The omega asks, a small, dry swallowing sound reverberating inside the four walls.
Castiel grabbed another egg for himself, not waiting for one of the maids to serve him, which earned him a glare from his mother in turn. “I will have to join you on one of the factory tours for me to be able to make a correct comparison between the machines and myself. I might find myself a new friend.” he tries to make light of the conversation, knowing their mother, as loving as she may sometimes be, her temper is also just as quick to show.
All Balt did was laugh and gently nudge him forward. “Let us go. We are keeping the line of guests waiting.”
Cain had lent him a while ago that explained the basics of being a merchant, including tips on haggling and generic price tags of more common items.
, Cas.”
Sam looked at him with mirth in his eyes and a smirk not unlike a young child that has pulled a successful prank. “Sorry about that. My brother gets really passionate about these things.”
It lasts a second before they unclasp ever so slightly and the prince can feel a thumb rubbing back and forth, up and down his inner wrist. The honeyed pecans come back tenfold.
She turns to walk back to the sink and Dior doesn’t follow her. His legs are so damn heavy.
“I do not mean to offer any offense, your Highness, but I have been alive for much longer and have seen how people grab shiny, new things with dangerous grips and push their luck in unfortunate ways,” mustiness turns into rotten wood as Castiel carefully places his cutlery back on the table. “But perhaps the most concerning impact is how we have found ourselves with a ridiculous amount of omegas who have - Lord forgive me for speaking such blasphemy - started
his omega.
, how very painful that thought was already. He’d been on this side of the channel for barely a week, and he was already dreading his departure. Had he always been so impressionable, or had his romantic tendencies finally taken over his critical mind? Castiel realised that leaving will quite possibly be one of the hardest things he will have ever done by that point. He was ready to fall in love with this country, and Balthazar had only laughed and said
and he is completely fine to suck their cock or eat their clit until they get bored of him. Dirty talk
The golden-haired man turns his head to look out of the window, contemplating in silence. When he makes up his mind, he turns back to Castiel and says, “The Arc de Triomphe.”
Castiel kept chanting to himself whilst holding a conversation with other foreign dignitaries. Right now, he found himself alone in a group consisting of the Russian and Prussian representatives, Balthazar having disappeared a while ago.
He finds Balthazar in the parlor, hands in pockets, and top hat pristinely on his head. He turns his head when he hears Castiel come in and starts making his way towards him. Balt’s familiar smell started to fill the close space between them and Castiel allowed it to relax him.
First of all,  I would like to thank each and every one of you for your comments and kudos - they've been the highlight of my days. Thank you for taking a chance with this fic and giving it a read!
“Everything seems to be in order. Your penis has no marks or boils, sensitivity is good, and colour normal. Your anus has no cuts or grazes-” Dior thanks whatever entity exists out there for that “- and your canal looks perfect and boring in its normalcy. Very good fluid secretion.”
The other omega takes a long look at him, finally clocking onto his clammy skin, deep eyebags, the way his hair is plastered to his forehead and neck despite it not snowing right now.
“W-what?” he mumbles.
And so he went in and has been pacing and assaulting the furniture in his anxiety since. The room was small but not claustrophobic, nicely decorated in the same fashion as the foyer, chair plush, furniture sturdy. The whole thing is flooded in warm light coming from two tall lamps placed in such a way the flames are illuminating well enough to read a small-print book without squinting. Castiel softens when he remembers the way Dior’s honey coloured hair had shone in the firelight when he saw him last, how every feature seemed to be highlighted to an impossible allure.
the stars and he is lost in the Milky Way of the man’s ivory skin.
Castiel thinks of falling on his knees and praying for forgiveness, for allowing this to happen, for being a half-wit alpha.
Stunned and angry at the fact that this random person had just come up and
He watches as they hug, as she cries as he strokes her hair and whispers promises in her ear.
“Tea, if you will, please. Black, if you have it,” Cas replies.
And so he clings to that length of rope and lets himself dangle, silently hoping it’ll all be done, soon.
“What are you even doing here? Why are you not at the palace? Are you stalking me, huh, is that it?” Dior says, voice loud enough to echo ominously in the night. He hugs himself to the point of pain, fingernails digging into the flesh of his right bicep. He ignores the small, meager and rational part of his brain that says if that was the case, the Prince would’ve stepped in when his first client bent him over in the alley.
Dior thinks of the chocolate box he’s so carefully hidden between his garments and almost wants to tell Lisa that none of this matters to him. Not the ‘gifts’ and not Crowley. He stops himself, reluctant to tell her about the prince’s gift, an unpleasant sensation building in his stomach.
like this-” she starts.
He gave the carrier to the assistant. “I wish he didn’t look at me like that.” Castiel lamented.
“But you are being a nightwalker-” Castiel interrupts.
The moment Dior comes into his field of vision, however, he starts very much doubting he will ever like any other colour, except for white.
It was another thing that caused him and his family great anguish. Castiel felt his mood drop further at the reminder of his inadequacy.
That’s all he managed to get her. Not even half of his hourly charge. Enough to last her a few weeks, not enough to help her in any substantial way. His fingernails dig into the skin of his palm, pain blooming in small bursts.
the alpha next to him to smell him. He wanted to see his eyes blow up in need and hear his breathing turn ragged. Dior wanted to see his composure crumble, whether that was on top of him or with the omega between his murderous thighs. Wouldn’t that just be bliss? If he wasn’t leaking slick already, Dior knew he would be now. The thought put a smile on his face and a quake in his legs.
. They don’t have any housekeepers to help out so they have to do everything themselves. He isn't particularly bothered about it since he likes keeping busy and feeling useful. His body has developed its own routine so he is up before the sun has even started its ascent.
“We don’t get paid. Everything we earn goes to Crowley. The taxes are sixty-five percent of our earnings, fifteen percent goes to Crowley for food and maintenance of the building and the rest is our due to him for the housing, medical needs, and his protection,” Dior explains, taking another sip of his forgotten water. It feels amazing on his parched throat.
“Uhm, if you’d like to help, would you mind getting his bottle ready? He doesn’t do well with strangers.” he finally says, rubbing soothing circles onto the baby’s back. “It’s not hard, you just need to get the bottle and put it in the bottle warmer - it’ll only take a couple of minutes.”
“Monsieur Cain- “ Dior started but felt the alpha suddenly bristle next to him, his honeyed scent turning slightly lemon-y. When he turned his head towards him, he was surprised to find him tense and breathing heavily. Afraid he had somehow offended him, he let go of his elbow and was about to apologise but Cain beat him to it.
“I see. Well, that is a shame. You know how to read, don’t you?” Cain asked and Dior nodded. Reading and writing was taught to him by the nuns at the orphanage he had lived at before Crowley had found him, after they had thrown him out. Of course, he won’t mention that speaking French was also taught to him at the same time. That was a story he wasn’t willing to share with anyone.
Dior feels breathless and he’s not sure whether from exertion - because he is
“Please forgive me if this is too forward - but it sounds to me like your preferences have a lot to do with your experience, rather than the aesthetic,” Dior resumes their conversation, bringing the prince back to their conversation rather than on the pink of the omega’s ears.
“We’ll start with two weeks and-and then we’ll see.”
He should not be feeling so anxious - Dior is merely a few meters away and Cas can hear his and Caesar’s voices coming faintly through the closed door. And yet…  his heart is still beating irregularly, fingers fidgeting on the fabric.
Princess Abbadon took his arm gracefully and she led him slowly through the ballroom to one of the doors. She started speaking as soon as she was out of earshot of his previous group, “My sisters and I have been looking for you and Monsieur Balthazar. We were hoping you would join us in my private parlour for some more exciting entertainment,” she told him, still looking ahead.
The smile Dior wears widens, “Do I smell like I’m lying to you?”
“I said
He took the stroller out of the trunk, filled it with the baby bag, and making sure it’s secure before unbuckling Jack from his car seat and strapping him in the stroller instead. With the weather as nippy as it was, Castiel was glad to have bought an extra liner for Jack. He did
what you’ve done to it.
There is a faint brush of luke-warm skin behind his ears that follows a path downward under his earlobe. All of Castiel’s senses turn sharp, the fabric between his tightened fingers feeling coarse, his nose having stopped identifying anything but toasting cinnamon and snowstorms. He hears
The omegas look at each other and Chrissie pushes them back down, shaking her head, “We can smell you from outside the door, Dior.”
“I need the livres, I suppose.”
The ragged rhythm now stopped, he’s able to vaguely concentrate on her breathing. They breathe in and exhale together, clumsily at first and then steadily.
Dior puts it down to dumb luck when he realises nobody is on any of the floors, Crowley’s scent now all but a whiff - which means the alpha is no longer in the building - and the waiting room where the doctor had been now vacant.
“I would appreciate it if you would stop
The coachman stands straight from his relaxed position against the side of the carriage and hastily throws the cigarette he was smoking on the ground, flame sizzling in the snow. He bows low, greeting both of them and smiling pleasantly when they greet back.
Dior lifts the hand that isn’t holding the fork and starts petting his hair gently, the kid pushing into it, happy to accept the comfort. “You’re fourth in line for the doc’ - you’ll have time to catnap,” he assures him.
“It’s not
There is a pitiful whine echoing in his ears when he pulls their bodies apart. Dior thinks it’s him at first, because he somehow always ends up being pathetic in the devastating man’s presence. However, he is both horrified and weirdly pleased - which, in turn, makes him horrified at himself - to find out it’s actually the alpha, who does it once more.
He remembers how he sat in one of his mother’s many armchairs in her tea room, chewing what must have been a
Castiel exhales a shuddering breath and has to look ahead - anywhere but his baby and the gentleman at his side. He wills his eyes to stop burning. “Yes,” he says, simply.
Both of them hiss in tandem when Cas has to unstick the fabric from what feels like yet another Hell-opened gash.
“Tell you what - I’ll take the silk and box but I’ve no need for the candy,” she says and Dior almost protests, “They’re very good quality - it’ll pay the difference, plus an extra week, honey. What do you say? Deal?”
He gets dressed in some of his house clothing, not wanting his better clothes to smell of food when he does start work, and heads back down to the kitchen. There he finds Lisa, one of the women on the second floor - a pretty thing with soft brown hair and doe eyes - finishing up the egg and milk mixture.
“Because of Crowley?” he asks, remembering their earlier conversation. Irritation takes hold again, his inner wolf growling alongside it.
“I’ve got you, Lis, okay?” he tells her and she only stares at him, as if in a daze. “I need you to know that,
Castiel backs away instinctually, hoping to appear less threatening when he asks, “What do you mean?”
And then it hits him.
He picks up his pace, cold sweat running down his back along with the fever one. It’s record time he makes to the hotel Lisa is staying in. The lobby is empty tonight but
Castiel pondered this for a second and then the doors were opening for his floor. “I’ll think about it. See you later Charlie,” he said and gave the petite woman a weak wave.
Castiel is suddenly hit with a horrible image and he cannot help but start asking, “Did Crowley-”
He closed his heart off like he had so many times in his past. He could physically feel the stony remains being encompassed in ice as he led the four of them to one of the tables, laid out the game for them and offered drinks. If his nose decided to develop a mind of his own and inhale the honey scent, that was none of his business.
What he does not expect is the way Dior takes a quick step toward him, only to abruptly stop himself, an almost imperceptible shake to his whole body. The grip around the scarf is now white, cinnamon and pecan turns so sugary Castiel is reminded of pastries.
,” he spits out, accusatory.
, Balt. You are conscious of my disposition. To answer your question, yes, my mating cycle is due to start during our stay. However, as you are already in the know," he peered at his friend without turning his head, an expression on his face that pleaded the conversation be dropped, "I have my own preference of treatment."
He was close to letting his temper slip through his cracks - which might be close to the only thing he inherited from his mother’s personality - when someone blessedly interrupted them. Castiel turned toward this new participant and was surprised to see the Crown Princess approach them.
“Will you be visiting me soon? I have missed our chess matches. Nobody is willing to learn back at the
“So what are you proposing here, exactly, Alexandrov?” Christoph, the Austrian alpha, asks, a touch sharp.
“English architecture is… imposing. Impressive in its own right, yes, but it has always struck me as very cold - distant,” Castiel adds. “It just does not possess French architecture’s allure.”
Oddly enough - or, not really - thinking about the devotion in the alpha’s voice when whispering sweet nothings (not nothings, Cas is always so serious), his stomach unclenches from its death grip. Dior could weep in relief.
“You are s-so odd, Castiel,” the omega says. “Ever so odd.”
Could they be snippets from
What the fuck does Castiel think he’s doing? Has he lost his mind? Why is he putting on this- this obedient act for Dior? Who is Dior for the alpha to show such intimate behaviour, as if they’re equals?
. Castiel fiercely wished that his French would sound exactly like that by the time they had to go home.
Dior flushes an angry red, shame spreading through his cheeks, shame the man in front of him is bound to notice. He’s subjected to derogatory terms on a daily basis, chips in his soul, and muck on his faith. It looks like being called a ‘whore’ and ‘knot slut’ by the elite is a completely different story to… this.
“Perhaps another time - I fear I have bored you enough -”
“I am saddened to have missed it.”
Dior clutches at her shoulders and puts a bit of distance between them. His gaze turns stony, “A
He’s no longer watching himself.
Dior shushes him like one might silence a child, making Castiel feel chastised but no less concerned.
“It appears to be bad luck - I can only see three,” he frowns. It has been a while since the nursery rhyme from his childhood has crossed his mind. They used to go out of their way to find magpies around the grounds back home, full of childish enthusiasm and laughter at their own antics. Castiel wonders how things can change so much, so quickly.
The blond joins him in watching the bird, “What is?”
Jesse rubs at his eyes for a second and does not say anything anymore, simply settling down in his seat. Castiel knows he should probably be offended that the man believes their presence here to be of negative nature, but his mind wanders to this morning’s discourse at breakfast and he finds that he cannot fault him for it. If this is the type of thing betas get into arguments for their spouses, he sees no difference from how he would react, were Cas in his shoes.
“Indeed. I am looking forward to our meeting this afternoon; it is bound to bear good fruit.”
Describing the way someone smells to their face is strictly for family and romantic partners. Outside of these relationships, it is considered rude, sometimes humiliating depending on the way it is described. It is a faux pas you learn quickly as a pup, regardless of your family’s status.
The beta’s gaze unwavering, she appears to take everything he’s saying with the type of seriousness Dior hasn’t had directed at him outside of the

“None of that,” he replies.
“I-I am nothing but another penny in a sea of other pennies. I have no qualities or traits that set me apart - I simply exist and have nothing to
Dior closes his eyes and remembers the Prince - remembers Castiel. He remembers how the alpha’s eyes were wide and nervous, how his hands gave a barely-there shake when he took the box out of his inner pocket. He thinks of how the Prince seemed worried about making a mistake toward Dior.
“Monsieurs,” she stated simply, posture perfect, hands firmly placed in front of her waist.
“We heard you shouting, and then Crowley rushed inside and we could hear him and Dr. Sunders yelling at each other over screams,” she rushes out in a single breath, hiccups breaking up her speech, “You wouldn’t stop, Dior! You wouldn’t…” she sobs, shaking her head right and left. “It felt s-so
“Right?” Adrien chips in, getting up and starting stacking plates. “We’re talking about the guy who refuses to buy extra soap.”
for longer or more often than necessary. “You are welcome to come in and talk to the bawd yourself, Your Highness. It’s just - a lot of our patrons prefer mail.”
The young maid looked down at their hands cautiously, accustomed to the way her Prince did not care for decorum when in his own chambers. Taking her hand out of his gently, she rubbed both her palms on her apron and curtsied “As you wish, my Prince. Please go ahead and light the fire whilst I prepare your bath. Would you like a masking herb blend today or plain soap?”
Balthazar got up and sat at the edge of the bed, cross legged. "No harm done,

“Ah, nonsense, my dear friend. Alfie knows you, as do I. Come, let us depart and we can continue this conversation in the carriage.”
sound before speaking up again “I can respect that.”
The princess raised a finger to his cheekbone, her perfectly manicured red nail lightly digging into his skin as she dragged it down to his jaw and then chin. “Yes, I can imagine he is simply scrumptious.” she purred, giving him a salacious sneer and grabbing his face in her hand, raising his head as if to inspect a piece of meat at the butchers.
He doesn’t, because that would be crazy - to cry over a piece of chocolate that probably cost the same as his hourly rate. Chocolate which was given to him by a
Castiel pulled at his collar, uncomfortable. “Must I have worn this colour, Balt? I fear it might be too cheery for the Parisian trend right now. Everyone else appears to have donned dark colours.” He looked down at himself again, hoping to see the cornflower blue suit having changed into something more inconspicuous.
- was settled and happy as anything. He probably would’ve let Castiel put him to bed in his nursery and not kick a fuss up.
, he recounted to himself as a reminder to be civil. His social skills might be ‘rusty’ at best, but he could be diplomatic even if their conversation partners were two of the foulest people Castiel has had the misfortune of meeting.
It feels as if his fragmented, scorched, tortured being is put back together. Each stroke sure and full of conviction that there is something worth saving.
His heart seizes up, “I can’t smell anything.”
? The chocolate is sweeter than any he’s ever tasted, possibly related to the lighter colour. Closing his eyes is automatic and he moans softly around the treat in his mouth. He lets it melt on his tongue instead of chewing on it, the flavour only intensifying with each passing moment.
“Is this a bench or an armchair?” he asks, fingertips pressing experimentally into the plush fabric.
” he heard himself say. His grip on the alpha’s shoulder and waist tightened without his permission when the man snapped his head up to meet Dior’s eyes.
Dior looks out of the window at the
He takes another deep breath for good measure, “I only have nine francs and forty-five centimes,” he murmurs, head bowed and palm messing up his hair and the other scrunching up the bottom of his coat. He paints the perfect picture of a small, distressed child in the form of a grown man.
“And payment?”
such a thing.
but restrains himself. He is taken aback at how easy it would be to let that line out of his mouth and into existence. Flirting isn’t something he does. Or, it wasn’t.
Balthazar’s scent turns thunderstorm, causing Castiel to stop moving and to glare at him in warning. “Balt, do not-”
Dior’s head spins and spins when he slides down to the floor, not even bothering to stand up. He crawls on his hands and knees over to Princess Abbadon, then sits down on his ass, legs bunched next to him. He looks up at her through his eyelashes, hyper-aware of the beads of sweat traveling down his spine. Her Highness hates him sweaty.
He leans even closer, the hand that’s not on Lisa’s wrist gripping the end of the tub in a death-hold, “
“M-make it- make it stop!” he howls, fighting for some sort of grip on the arms around his body. “It burns, it burns, it
Dior rummages in his wardrobe and manages to put together a more casual outfit consisting of dark grey trousers, a white shirt, suspenders, and a black thin coat. The coat will have to do - he doesn’t own any outdoor ones. It’s not an attire that screams ‘whore’ and it could also fool people into thinking he’s spoken for. He’s thinking back on one of the books
She’s in clothes Dior has never seen in her - or any omega’s at the
“I understand,” Castiel replies seriously. “I like technology a lot myself, but I have been accused of being an “eco-maniac” by peers before. I, apparently, cannot like both technology and nature.” he finishes, using a single hand to use air quotes in order to accentuate his point.
Unworthiness.
They all made their way inside the palace, Castiel and Balthazar walking shoulder to shoulder at a very formal and appropriate distance behind the Royal Family. He marveled at the French architecture, the intricate designs, and statues that were peppered liberally in the impressive front gardens of the palace. Even with the onset of winter, everything still appeared lush green as if the time here stopped mid-spring. Countless breeds of flowers, bushes and trees were planted in sophisticated patterns, very much the model of the romantic trend France was the pioneer of. So strong were the aromas around him that it took him by surprise when he could not smell anything except for the surrounding greenery. No alpha, beta or omega scents. No bodily functions, no fumes or smoke or even
Dior startles when the beta slides right next to him and starts shouting, “Come get your toiletries, people! Scented oils and powder so fine it could be snow! Pretty satin drawers in fashionable colours! All for a good price!”
He knows what this misery crawling in the darkest depths of his soul is. It is the same feeling that has followed him since his youth, scarred by words of belittling, of hidden whispers in bright daylight.
she-” his friend says hotly.
He cleaned the immediate mess with a damp towel, wrapped himself in a robe, and descended the three flights of stairs to the boiler room. It was after midnight so clients were no longer allowed on the premises, but that didn’t mean there wasn’t a constant bustle of voices and scents of arousal, alpha, omega, slick, and cum engulfing the building. Each flight of stairs he descended, the decor got worse and the structure appeared a lot rougher than on the last floor. It was the way Crowley ran his house. The more money you brought in, the more privileges you had.
He coughed trying to regain composure. “I enjoyed it greatly. I am fond of teaching people parlour games. I’ve been told I’m quite adept at them.”
not one with pup, Lisa. That’s not how this fucking world works, you know that,” he tells her, letting go of her and standing up to pace about the room.
He keeps his expression open and scent clear, agitation crawling under his skin, “What do you mean - not allowed to?”

Sergei bristles visibly, pushing his napkin back on top of the table before replying, “The problem is glaringly obvious - the betas are starting to see themselves at the same level as alphas. I believe the biggest factor to that appears to be how their marriages are regarded on the same level as blood bonds. Personally, I think legal marriages with no blood bonds should have some of their rights revoked.”
Dior’s fingers tighten ever so slightly around his coat, eyebrow lowering and melting into an affectionate gaze, “That is awfully thoughtful.”
“Have you gone insane, boy?” Crowley asks, incredulity dripping from his voice.
on all fronts. That belief continued until his eighteenth birthday. He had sneaked off to take a break from the stuffy celebration his family had organised, when the daughter of a noble had followed him. They were exchanging what Castiel had thought was polite conversation until she grabbed his jacket and tugged him down for an unexpected kiss.
“It’s proper nippy out here!” Balthazar exclaims, rubbing his arms in an exaggerated gesture. “Your face is incredibly red already!”
Dior wonders if the mirage is worth the dehydration.
One of Dior’s hands appears in his field of vision, resting close to his - but not touching, dragging his attention to the plant he has between his fingers - glove grinded green, the leaf damaged. He snatches his hand away from it as if burned, guilt settling in his soul.
Maybe
it might be enough. But just because it might be doesn’t mean it will. With time ticking away, not waiting for him, the omega swallows and goes back inside the room. Quietly, so he doesn’t stir Lisa, he opens his wardrobe and takes out the white box. With a heavy heart, he places it inside his coat pocket where it won’t be jostled by anything else and finally goes through the door.
After work finished, he hurried to pick Jack up, who was delighted to see him, the folly of leaving him this morning forgotten.
!” was all she said before taking a sharp turn around a corner. It was not long before they came to a heavy and intricately decorated, wooden door. It was already open so they walked straight in, Balthazar come over immediately.
Balt’s eyes turn stormy again, the earlier softness gone in an instant. He throws his arms up in a rapid motion and stalks angrily away from Castiel, “There are no bloody failings! You can’t get your cock up for every omega that prances around you. What the
As a gentle reminder, please keep in mind that in this universe there are Primary and Secondary genders. There are biases and homophobia when it comes to primary genders but not secondary.
How could he have forgotten how spellbinding the omega was? His scent is back to its neutral tones, allowing the alpha to take in everything about the vision before him - because that is what Dior has been from the moment he entered Castiel’s life. Had it only been a fortnight? It seemed like a lifetime, since he was allowed to witness this wondrous man.
And this only serves to make the fire roar.
“Cas, Cas, Cas,
His friend has always been quiet, in a mature and collected sort of way. She loves a good laugh and playing around with the other omegas at the
Balthazar gave a small sigh in return. “Always ready to douse my pants in cold water, Your Highness. I was hoping to ignore that detail.”
“Oh. I see,” was all Castiel could add to that. He knew prostitutes existed, of course. However, back home they were seen as less than people, worse than sub-class citizens. There had been many discussions about the moral implications of such occupations, and how to end as much of it as possible. The meetings were never compassionate to these people. It was always about how to subjugate, threaten and intimidate them in stopping. Castiel had always felt horrid for sitting in on those meetings and being unable to make a difference - any difference. Most of these changes were based upon vote, so it was always him against everyone else.
Cas is only lightly stunned by this piece of news, starting to get accustomed to being constantly impressed by this man. Commoners are usually versed in a single language - mostly verbal, regardless of their primary gender, due to families not being able to afford sending their pups to school as it would mean losing the extra working hands and income. And since the parents were not taught either, the vicious cycle continues. This is yet another thing that starts up that incessant itch Castiel feels whenever he finds out something new about the omega, which only prompts the wish to learn even
The carriage was already waiting for them at the entrance, imposing, opulent, and needlessly so. The Royal Family crest sat heavily on every side of the carriage. Castiel vehemently wished he could leave the palace without such a bother. There were guards on horses following them behind and on the sides. It was so easy for him to feel alienated from his own family and heritage, which in turn made Castiel wince with guilt at his treacherous thoughts. He loved his family and his country, he only wished his personality was better suited to show it.
“Lucius, please do not tantalize your brother. He works very hard for you to inherit a great kingdom.” Their mother berated, throwing a stern glance at her son, annoyance slipping in her scent.
With the alpha in his arms as pliant as he’ll ever be in this situation - which isn’t much to begin with - he takes a chance by grabbing Cas’ wrist with all the force he can muster, turns them on their heels, and runs.
“That will do,” the prince says, hope rekindled. “How long until his studio?”
It’s disconcerting, what happens next.  Dior smiles but his smell turns profoundly
seeing as each of his daughters had a different primary gender. Abbadon was an alpha, Lilith a beta and Margot an omega. Castiel knew that just like England, the only people allowed to inherit the throne were alphas. So, Abbadon was the only Crown Princess. For now.
Lisa fiddles with her thumbs and almost looks shy when she replies, “I climbed in through the window under the staircase on the bottom floor.”
“But you
Dior takes one final, long pull of his drink and places the empty mug on the nightstand before steeling his expression and directing it at the other man, “And to answer your other questions: no, I am not allowed to be doing this and no, Crowley isn’t aware.”
When trying to get up, pain blooms in his lower abdomen and travels all the way to his chest. It’s bad enough that he needs to take a second to breathe through it. Just his luck that he would catch a cold right now.
“Hey, man, no worries. T’is my job. Plus, you’re a nice guy to talk to Cas.” Dean says, leaning his elbows forward on the desk, the perfect image of nonchalance and charm.
This chapter fought me tooth and nail for reasons not even I can understand - which is very frustrating. It ran very long and I had barely gone through half of my chapter outline so I took the advice of my beta and cut it so there would be 2 long-ish chapters, rather than the mammoth it would've been otherwise.
Taking off her gloves and disposing of them, she starts writing her results in her big diary, the one that she keeps specifically for this
“In another three, if you wish.”
was going on? His legs are pretty damn close to being called
It feels like sand slipping through his fingers despite trying his best to keep all of it in the palm of his hands - the more he tries, the more gaps appear and less sand there is to hold onto.
It’s Cas’ turn to bury his nose in that special little nook on his neck, elegant nose skimming the area, back and forth, back and forth like some sort of lullaby.
. She got here not long after Dior so it had been inevitable that they’d grown close, navigating this new environment they’ve found themselves in - learning everything there was to know about servitude and ways of pleasing bodies and egos.
. Forget small flushes of his ears, his whole damn face was on fucking fire, ready to melt off and slide on the floor along with the slick he could feel forming. He couldn’t help imagining all the implications of that statement. He also couldn’t bear thinking about it.
She nods once, movements sluggish but eyes focused on him.
seems inclined to learn. It must be frustrating.”
On the way back they discuss Dean and how the business came to be. Dean elaborates on the story he told Castiel earlier. He finds out Dean is 28, has a Biological Sciences degree, and plans on doing a master's - just hasn’t had the time yet. He also learns his brother is a lawyer at a big practice in a nearby town but decided he’ll be coming to help Dean out every Saturday in December because
Castiel is focused on the way his fork pierces the piece of pork and how smoothly the gleamingly sharp knife slides through it. His attention is not fully on the conversations going on around him - it feels as if they have been running around in circles. It is not news that these are to be the topics today; they had been the same yesterday, the day before yesterday
“Hmm…” Jesse muses. “We’ve been married ten years, together for twelve.”
“No, no. I believe the wind must be playing tricks on our ears. Shall we head inside the carriage now?” the prince asks, disregarding the conversation with two shakes of his head and pulling Dior with him to the carriage.
Castiel chuckled and draped the still-screaming Jack over his shoulder, still rocking him. “Your brother might have implied you aren’t a big fan of technology.”
the hell
Options were limited, seeing as Castiel refused to spend it with their family in New York, despite the invitation. He ground his teeth when he remembered his mum trying to manipulate and emotionally blackmail him into coming down for Thanksgiving, regardless of the fact that they hadn’t talked since-
Dior chuckles whilst making his way into the prince’s personal space only to start undoing his buttons as if it’s the most natural thing, and not currently causing his brain to stutter. His scent must be doing something because Dior’s cheeks tint pink and throws him a playful glance. “Is this permitted?” he asks, “Undoing your coat - I mean.”
He stares at her and she stares right back, a placid emotion on her face. “You seemed to be having trouble. Just yell yer lungs out. Someone’s bound to come sooner rather than later, handsome.”
, arms burrowing further in the hand muff, sinking even more into Cas’ side. There is the smallest of twitches in his jaw.
The alpha interrupts the other man by hastily taking off his own, knitted woolen scarf and winding it a couple of times around the slender neck, tying an elegant, loose knot at the front.
He takes out his small linen pouch from the breast pocket of his thin indoor coat and jiggles it in front of Lisa, dismayed, “I’m not. I was barely able to get
“Dior, what-”
The beta stares at him for a few seconds and then his eyes trail over to Dior, taking in the blanket around his shoulders. Castiel is about to inform him that staring at someone’s companion is impolite, but then the man seems to make a decision and opens the door the rest of the way, inviting them in, “I’ll see if Caesar can do anything for you. Please come in,
As per the physician’s usual orders, he does not draw himself or anyone else a bath this morning - they’re supposed to wait until the end of the checks - and neither bothers with day clothes, opting rather to don a dressing gown and make his way downstairs. Briefly popping his head onto the second and first floor confirmed everyone else was already up. A brief moment of panic passes through him when he realises he’s dwindled long enough to make himself late in starting breakfast at the usual time. Picking up his pace, he hopes nobody was feeling starved just yet.
it? Why does he insist on entangling himself with a prostitute like him when they’re a dime a dozen throughout Paris? Dior’s trying so fucking hard to keep him whole and he’s just-
“I will not let that happen.”
“That’s fine. Thank you,” he takes a tentative sniff of the plate and makes a sound of contentment “Mmm, smells good.”
It was the last thing he wanted to do. Dior smiled and walked to the side of the Prince’s chair, placing a careful hand on the back of the chair, making sure not to touch any part of the alpha. “It will be my pleasure. Please do not keep it against me if His Highness wins.” he said, leaning in and throwing a wink at the table. Turning to the Prince he gave him a small smile before returning to the table, “Let us begin.”
“I see - my apologies. I didn’t mean to assume,” he says.
“You must be famished. The journey from Calais to Versailles isn’t an agreeable one at this time of the year. We have prepared for lunch. Please allow us the honour and dine with us.” one of the princesses said. It was the first-born, Crown Princess Abbadon. Her portrait did not do her justice. Her long, bright red tresses were cascading down to the small of her back in soft curls, very much against what he knew to be in trend amongst French nobility. Her face, although exquisite with sharp features, was cold and calculating. If Castiel had not been used to such frosty looks from the British court, he might have physically shivered.
Dior’s not often relieved he’s the top-earning omega at
What was far from being acceptable, however, was how Dior was adamant about refusing any and all compliments, regardless of which part of himself they were about. Castiel prided himself on being a man of great patience - but, apparently, not when it came to Dior being intent on criticising himself with no basis.
“You’ve no freckles anywhere - I’m jealous,” Dior says.
There is no hesitation in the prince’s voice when he replies, “Absolutely.”
“This is - incredible, Your Highness. It’s so
He is going to be sick.
And so he continues watching.
“Indeed.” he replied. Dior liked
He takes a few coins out, counting them hidden in his fist. Turning to the beta, he thanks her for her help and wishes her a productive day.
They spent the rest of the hour chatting about the welcome ball held tomorrow for all the foreigners and other miniscule topics. After Balthazar left and the servants arrived, he allowed them to bathe and clothe him in nightwear whilst his mind wandered over as many possible outcomes for the ball. He needed to be as perfect as possible, even if it meant he had to abandon some of his personality back in his room.
Castiel can feel the confusion and panic resonating loudly off Dior and is thankful that there are no protests or attempts to disentangle them. He would not be able to take Dior distancing from him twice in a single day. Still, he is thankful that there appears to be no one in their close vicinity, not wanting to put the other man in an uncomfortable position.
They stare at each other, unmoving, unrelenting, both of them stubborn. Dior’s eye catches her other hand moving underwater, upwards from her thighs to her stomach where she stops.
Not having been in this estate before, he had a little trouble navigating it and finding his destination. After what had seemed like the fifth turn, he had finally found a quiet balcony. He let out a relieved sigh and promptly sat down on the bench overviewing the garden. He rubbed tiredly at his eyes. He cannot wait for this to be over so tomorrow he can smuggle himself out again and visit the Notre Dame.
Dior takes them, movements slow, “Thank you - I will make sure to read them carefully.”
Neither of them speaks again, awkward, heavy silence settling between them - a stark contrast to the companionable one they shared earlier in the night. The comfort inside the carriage seems like ages ago.
TW/CW lower down but please do note that this might be my heaviest chapter yet. It's pretty much 12k of angst. It's angst even when it's comfort - that type of thing. I would like to pour ALL of the blame on ChaoticDean for always encouraging my angst-loving ass. So if by the end of this chapter you feel like punching or throwing stones at someone, please do it at her <3
“It’s never too late,” she tells him.
Castiel’s brows furrow, crease forming in-between them, expression pinching in confusion, “I did not-”
, posturing and getting aggressive when it was obvious Dior wouldn’t let them get away with it. Thankfully, the beta next to him was kind enough to intervene if needed, a gesture that thawed the chill in his fingers a little.
“You’d think she’d get over herself. We could hear her accuse Crowley of messing with the records,” someone else adds, “As if that stingy bastard would botch up his earnings on purpose.”
It’s midnight when he slips through the same ground-floor window, long legs revealed to the world and corset heavy with covered latex.
clients are not aware of this detail.
Cas is only furtively taken aback by his bodily response before lifting himself slightly, still on his knees, body searching for his own, “I can help. You do not need to put yourself in harm’s way like this, Dior. Ask of me what you need and you shall receive.”
“Oh! I almost forgot,” Caesar exclaims before quickly retreating back into the room, coming out thirty seconds later with what appears to be a flat, ceramic bottle with a closed cap. The beta picks up the hand muff from the sofa and turns to Dior. “This has a hidden compartment just here-” he undoes two hidden buttons that reveal a compartment between the outer and inner layers “- you fill this with hot water and then slip it inside for extra warmth.”
omegas. Dior takes it as his cue to get up and re-dress.
“I- what?” Dior counters dumbly, “You… You
“As I was saying - That isn’t how I work. I do custom pieces, take the client’s measurements and create the garments to their exact numbers - I do not have half-done pieces prepared, I’m afraid,” the beta says, leaning back on the plush cushion of the armchair he’s sitting in, crossing his legs and taking his cup with him, without the saucer. “The only thing I have available are the clothes I have prepared for the fashion parade the day before Christmas Eve.”
“And I want you to choose it.”
The woman makes a
“It’s fucking winter, Lisa. You’ll freeze to death if starvation doesn’t kill you first,” he tells her and feels like shit when she starts sobbing in earnest now. But he can’t stop - he needs her to understand what she’s planning on doing, how crazy it is, how it’s not going to work. “You won’t have access to any scent neutralisers, everyone you pass will know you’re an omega. What do you think happens when a psychopath catches you have nowhere to go? You’ll most probably-” Dior stops.
“That will have to do.”
Picking up his pace, he makes his way back. It’s almost midday now. There’s not much time left for Dior to go to the last two places he needs and then head back to the
He's a liar.
Dior furrows his eyebrows, looking for all the world like a pouting pup and gorgeous omega at the same time. Affection, a seed wrapped in splendor, soars and buries itself in his bones - welcomed and wanted. Inevitable - how could one be in the presence of something holy and not feel blessed?
- w-what about you? What is
For not being enough.
Jesse gets up as if burned and takes the tray with him, leaving the cups and saucers behind, “On it. I’ll be back with fresh drinks.”
“Don’t be so hasty, Cassie, look,” Balt says, pointing at what appears to be a random bench further down the path.
His cramps are getting worse, his vision is blurring and now there’s a ringing in his ears, “What do I smell like?” he asks, offering them a wrist each for better access.
Castiel does not understand. He does not and that is where the problem lies. He cannot ask Dior to shoulder such a burden because of his selfish desires. Had he not decided merely an hour ago that he is to no longer pursue his hopeless wishes? It appears he is not even capable of not slipping in his own convictions.
Cas’ gaze locks to Dior’s again the moment that thought materialises in his scent. The prince’s honey turns sour as he hurries through words, “I assure you everything was appropriate in nature! I would never allow-”
Once she’s out of her dress, Dior is about to offer to help with her corset but closes his mouth once he realises she isn’t actually wearing one. He doesn’t ask. Instead, he takes her hand and leads her to the tub, holding her slender fingers in his knobbly ones as she lowers herself in the bath. A deep sigh escapes her and she closes her eyes, head bumping the edge.
He had pined for a mother’s love lost.
Once his stomach settles ever so slightly, the omega feels the uncommon sting behind his eyes and nose. It comes quickly, with a vengeance.
“Thank you,” he whispers instead, their gazes caught in each other, bodies close enough that he will soon be able to feel the other man’s heat, once it gets warm enough. It pains him to remind himself the wonderful person in front of him is not
“Alright - we need to do something about your scent. It’s smothering me.”
“People like you, Castiel - full of high hopes and wishes for a better world - will never have an easy time getting through other’s hearts,” Dior comforts him, “Sometimes, the knot is bigger than the heart.”
“Hi, yes - I’m actually looking for the tree nursery? I couldn’t find the entrance.” Castiel says, pushing his stroller closer.
Dior bows his head, looking down and away. His hands come undone from where they kept the blanket closed under his chin. Castiel can now see Dior twiddling them nervously in his lap.
Personally, I love mammoth chapters - but I am aware I am an anomaly. However, I want to hear what your preferences are? Do you mind insanely long chapters (20k+) or the long-but-manageable ones (10k-15k)? Let me know in case this ever happens again <3
It wasn’t long before the alpha’s carriage arrived to whisk him away to the estate just outside of Paris. It took the better part of an hour to get there through the busy Parisian streets. When he gets out of the carriage, he is greeted by the butler and brought into the dining room where Cain is about to have breakfast. Dior found it ridiculous how late nobles seemed to start their day, but never mentioned anything to the alpha.
Such was tonight, Jack vehemently refusing to settle in his crib. Castiel would sing and cradle him to the point of small snoozing sounds, only for him to start crying again the moment Castiel tried to lay him down. An hour later and still no luck, he decided enough is enough, no matter what all those parenting books said about letting them ‘cry it out’. It worked when it worked and tonight was obviously not one of those nights.
“Has this happened before?” the beta asks him.
Jesse takes a perfunctory look around, “I’ve grown accustomed, but I used to have nightmares about them for the longest of times.”
The other omega looks conflicted, at war with not wanting to burden Dior but desperately wishing to protect her unborn offspring. Dior takes everything out of the box and dumps it in a cloth bag, tying it up.
“Yes - I apologise if that was presumptuous, but it appeared to be the most sensible option,” Cas states. “He…“
He rubbed his eyes in exasperation. He was so anxious to get away that he’d not only been hasty but also wasteful.
Wait - What?
He couldn’t see where to go for the nursery so he decided to head for the flower shop and ask for some assistance. Inside the greenhouse was warm, but not overly stuffy. A surprising amount people moved between the pots, chatting and touching different plants. It was even more impressive from the inside, with high ceiling and shelves upon shelves somehow mounted on the frame and trailing plants hanging heavily, blooms or no blooms. Different types of small trees lined the outer walls, garden decorations scattered here and there with price tags attached to them.
“What crawled up your ass and died there, Crowley?” he snapped, baring his teeth. “Send them up in ten.”
“No, no! I don’t need rest. I am perfectly fine,” he insists, finding his dressing gown and putting his arms through the sleeves. “I can work, Crowley, and I don’t need any drugs.”
He doesn’t look at her when he replies, keeping his head down and focusing on taking things out, “I’m not allowed to say,” he blurts out.
“Along with matters of lenient border rules and currency values.”
Dior can’t help but chuckle. Now that he knows how to help, he’s feeling unnervingly serene. “I know,
“His Majesty, my father, is very eager to come to favourable conclusions. He does hope this will be resolved quickly,” he hears Princess Margot say.
But now he’s somehow managed to fuck up so monumentally that he is faced with the last person in this God-forsaken world he ever wanted to see him like this.
- semi-detailed description of severe migraines and vomiting
They return to their previous seats and sit in silence for a minute, quietly sipping their tea, Castiel admiring the array of colours in the room, trying his best not to linger on what looked
Dior stares at the alpha incredulously. Again, what the hell is going on? Does this man not
Before he can get his bearings, strong hands wrap around his shoulder and yank him away from the delicious haven of honey and an arm’s length away from the prince as a whole. Time stops whilst they stare at each other, both stunned at this sudden change in atmosphere. Both of them are panting - but for different reasons.
The couturier is silent for a few seconds before he taps a finger on his husband’s knuckles twice, “Jesse.”
He was just about finished when another knock on his door came. “It’s Alfie, Your Highness. I bid you a good morning. May I come in?”
Dior flushes, shame creeping up his neck. She didn’t know where they came from or what they could’ve been used for, but Dior did, and having someone ask that in broad daylight made him shrivel.
“If I knew you were so sneaky, we could’ve had a lot of fun,” he tells her, hoping to ease the tension.
He feels the first trickle of blood sickness into his veins.
Dior doesn’t even have the words of how bad of a shitstorm that would stir.
Dior walks over to Lisa and places his hands on her now-warm cheeks, rubbing smooth circles on her silky skin, not breaking eye contact. Lisa looks exhausted and terrified. It only convinces Dior that he’s doing the right thing. Unlike him, Lisa is
She growls, bringing that same pointy end on his cheek and pushing down, Dior’s head exploding in white bursts. He wants to scream at the top of his lungs, gunshots firing behind his eyelids. He only lets out a single whimper - just the way she likes.
Dior shakes his head aggressively, jostling him and bringing forth another avalanche of burning. He can hear Cas’ pulse from where he is and refuses to let go.
Uh. Did he just - Did Dean just -
. Castiel can see it now - they do not simply look like stars. They
He sighed and closed his eyes, letting soft snores lull him into a restful sleep.
It smelled of the first snow, of cinnamon confectionaries, and fine aged whiskey. It felt like each scent hit him separately and took the wind out of his lungs, only to return and morph together, wrapping around his skin like the softest blanket. It smelled of
“I’m carrying this,” Chrissie tells him and walks right around him and down the stairs. Knowing when he’s lost, Dior sighs and continues to make his slow descent.
His fingers curl protectively around her wrist, not too tight to hurt but tightly enough to show her he’s here, present “You don’t know that.”
. It is a struggle to not bodily react to this jarring change - from spring sunshine and baked confectionaries to - to muddy, stale water and rancid nuts. Castiel wants to gather him up in his arms and blanket him in his own scent - anything to make him stop smelling like
Yes, father. Yes, father.
the reason they get to live!”
“Do you have a favourite flower, Dior?”
But the brush to that one spot never comes.
“We should be on our way now,” he tells the room and Dior makes his way to Cas’ side, putting down his hand muff on the sofa, and makes haste in buttoning up Castiel’s coat, throwing a warning glance towards him.
to have Lisa sneak out before anyone can notice. And all this with time to spare for him to get cleaned up in time for his first client.
all of his life. Thus, Castiel will take actions and pray to God it works - he needs the man to
“Do they get along, being so different?”
The radio was silent for a bit longer than what Castiel assumed was normal before it crackled back to life and a muffled voice came through.
Dior drops his head onto her shoulder and brings both of his arms around her in a hug, Lisa’s own, wet arms snaking around him immediately.
He kind of wishes he’d be able to stay awake, to let himself cry endlessly, but he is so fucking tired, his body won’t even allow that.
Castiel is forced to bear witness to absurd amounts of distressing opinions and arguments - how such people should be dragged naked through the streets with their hands and legs bound, how they should be left to rot in Church dungeons for rats to feast on the sinner’s flesh.
his mate.
He listens intently for sounds and keeps his nose in the air to try and form a mental map of where everyone is. He can clearly smell Ruby in her room, and accompanied by the complete silence, he’s almost sure she’s asleep. Once that’s out of the way, he goes down the steps carefully, making sure to avoid the creaky bits of wood, still listening for any of the omegas appearing out of nowhere.
It only takes him a second to feel the sharp edges in his pocket.
The omega feels sick. He brings his palm to the front of his stomach, strong grip around his thin clothes and pressing onto his belly button, hoping pressure will ease pressure.
“Your smell,” the prince reiterates but doesn’t elaborate.
He slips impossibly close to the omega, thigh to thigh, shoulder to shoulder, soul to soul - and he reaches out to cup Dior’s face and gently raises it so he is, once again, looking the prince levelly.
“Oh.” was all the alpha had said, followed by several long seconds of silence. Well, he’s gone and done it now, kicked himself in the face and ate the damn foot as well.
is never supposed to be.
Tension building up or not, he’s careful to wipe every bit of skin, his work in the afternoon looming. He lathers up the soap on his cloth, dragging it over his arms in a circular motion, applying enough pressure to count as a light massage.
“I miss him, too. It’s hard - He was with me full-time until I started here. We’re both adjusting.” he said.
“Is it? I had not noticed.”
They proceed with little conversation. Dior doesn’t think he’d be able to formulate anything more complex. She writes a fake name in the ledger, gives him a key, a piece of paper, and sends him on his way.
“Your Highness, Your grace,” they both greeted, taking an appropriately-low bow.
She gives his hair a sniff then parts their bodies in order to throw him a slightly amused look, “Difficult clients today? I haven’t smelled you this neutral in a very long time.”
He is unable to look anywhere else.
“Beautiful, isn’t it? Wait until we arrive, the stench won’t be quite as pleasant.” Balthazar said, joining him on the deck.
“I think you owe me dessert now,” he says, hands primly in his lap, back straight as a rod and looking at Cas from the corner of his eyes. Snowflakes are still gleaming on top of the fur and his locks of hair.
“I might be freezing,” Dior interrupts him, and Castiel thinks he will never be able to forgive himself upon hearing the confirmation out of his own mouth. “But I have never, ever, in my life have felt as warm as I do now - in your company and being the target of such worry.”
The alpha honest-to-God sputters, and somewhere in the back of his mind he can hear his mother scoff at his horrid manners, “I- what?”
Dior is
“Inias and Hael are most definitely worth what their
“Aloe vera,” Dior finally answers, voice small and unsure.
Hello everyone,
“Alpha!” Dior raises his voice, tone trembling on the last letter. Castiel’s breath catches and his resolve falters for a second before it’s back in place.
“That is if he ever decides to stop his shameful antics and behave like a respectful member of this family.” his older brother, Lucius, scowled from across the table, seated at their father's left. “You have given him too much freedom, mother. At this rate, we will end up with a feral beta on our hands.”
Well, Dior is ready to flip himself off the tallest building Paris has to offer.
Another exasperated look marrs Dior’s features and the prince silently wonders what it says about him - the fact that he revels in the multitude of expressions he has managed to pry out of the omega today, regardless if they were positive or not.
Every time the alpha growls, his body moves forward, pushing his shoulder further between Dior’s ribcage, against his sternum. It feels as if Castiel is trying to climb inside, despite his focus being on the alpha-beta pair in front of them.
,” the beta greets, prominent lines around her eyes accentuating with her smile. The deep bronze of her skin glows softly and Dior could swear some of this tension leaves his body just looking at it. “How can I help you, sweetheart?” she asks, face kind and smile compassionate.
“I can assure you we will have plenty of those. Just not with the whole British court on our back.” Castiel quipped, giving his friend a small smirk.
Castiel relays all of that information and they arrange a time and day for delivery. Once the tree has been paid for, Dean gives him a receipt and a delivery confirmation. “We’ll send out both a text and email reminder on the day of, just in case,” he tells Castiel.
He breaks it, the pressure behind his throat breaking alongside it, like the skies cracking and finally flooding rain, “You feel
feels the small breaths on his skin and how they travel halfway down the side of his jaw, only to retract back under his ear and start the slowest descent known to man toward-
“Dior…”
It is with its hurt howl resonating in his heart, trembling in his mind, that he finds the courage to finally ask what he had been desperate to since he had left this building a few days ago. The urge to help, protect, soothe,
“Uh, no - no! It wasn’t. I’m sorry, I’m a big flirt, everyone keeps telling me. These things just come out of my big mouth. You’ve got a kid and I definitely did not mean to offend. I’m sorry -” Dean rambles, his palm at the back of his neck and his face definitely rosier in colour than it should be.
Forgetting all about the freezing temperatures outside, about his undone corset slowly coming off his chest, about his bare feet but for his thin stockings -
If innards could relocate, Dior would swears his just did, finding a new home in his feet. Dread surges and freezes him to the spot. The bag is weightless, all of his possessions now gone, yet its burden is great on his shoulder. In comparison, the new, barely there load in his pocket seems insignificant now when earlier it felt like it could lead and fly him over shattered expectations.
Warnings (SPOILERS):
Dior shakes himself, confused, “What?”
After Alastair took his ugly ass out of his room, Dior didn’t waste any time in getting himself clean. They weren’t lucky enough to have running hot water like other establishments but Crowley promised that business was good and another year of good revenue would enable him to do the necessary renovations. Dior counted the days on his fingers until then.
Alfie made his way to the bath and offered Castiel a very low bow, with an arm tightly clasped behind his back. He stopped the unsavory urge to roll his eyes at his footman. Surely, he should know by now decorum is to be ignored in his chambers?
Dior kind of wants to cry.
“I would like to offer my apologies.” he registered the Prince saying, leaving him dumbfounded. There was absolutely nothing for him to apologise for, and even if there was, what Prince apologises to a whore?
The alpha laughs. Dior bites back a growl. He watches as all of his ‘savings’, as it were, disappear from his sight and through a door in the back. It’s like watching three years of your life flash in front of you when you’re dying. Three years of carefulness and paranoia in being discovered, of having kept things hidden from Crowley, knowing very well he could be kicked to the curb if only he hadn’t plastered himself in the alpha’s good graces.
“His Highness, Third Alpha Prince of England, Castiel James the First and His Grace, Alpha Lord Balthazar of the Roché Duchy,” the butler nearly yelled.
Grateful for the out, he doesn’t hesitate in taking it, “Is she in the kitchen?”
But he had a job to do. So when Alastair commanded he get on his knees and suck his cock, he did. When he was roughly thrown in his bed back at the
“How are you feeling today, my dearest Anna?” King Charles, their father, asked his youngest. Affection and love practically rolled off his father’s scent at the moment, looking at Anna with an expression to match his scent.
And yet… he couldn’t stop himself from trying his best to display himself as enticing as possible. He leaned down and whispered in patrons’ ears, he’d make an effort to laugh boisterously to dimwitted jokes and unimpressive pool moves. Worse, he kept positioning his body in such ways that his ass would be accentuated that was
Sensing that the moment of departure is upon them, his wolf starts whining pitifully, in sync with the dread and despondency swimming around in Castiel’s gut right now.
Dior tightens his thighs around Cas’s waist and arms around his neck, “Cas, Cas, please-” he gasps and gasps, open mouth moving with each tremor over tanned, honeyed flesh. He doesn’t know what he’s asking for. Nothing. Everything.
No, what hits him is a horrifying, agonizing headache. It hits Dior so suddenly and out of nowhere, like lightning struck straight in his skull, through his brain, and zipped to the base of his spine. He staggers and hears a dreadful shriek in his ears which he belatedly realises was him.
Dior couldn’t calm down. All of his senses were on edge, his body too hot and too cold at the same time. He felt as if he’d been taken over by some sort of madness, very similar to what the nuns used to call possession back at the orphanage. His actions weren’t his and yet he was perfectly aware he was doing them.
. You do not let go for
Dior almost trips over his own legs on the way to the tub, haphazardly emptying the whole box in it, his whole body going numb, hearing quieting dangerously, to the point he can no longer discern the thrumming of early morning Paris that is always present outside his window.
similar to a forced mating scar.
As far as I could find, hematology in our world only started to be a thing in the mid 19th century but I think in a world where blood bonds/mating, rejection/pining sickness etc. existed because of those bonds, they’d start taking an interest in it a bit earlier. I also have close to no knowledge about blood so I’m basically making it up as I go. If you were hoping for scientific accuracy… You’re not going to find it here, lol.

since he’s literally shaved a couple of days ago. Even so, there is, undoubtedly, a good layer of hair across his shins and calves. Dark blonde and thicker than he’s ever seen any of his body hair appear, it still glints in the sunlight, as if it had any business being there - on his freaking skin.
When he speaks next, it’s gentle, consoling, “I will tell you however many times you will want to hear it, Dior. Were it after me, I would be next to you as much or as little as you’ll have me.”
? Castiel could barely talk about undoing his corset, of course he wouldn’t want to fuck him. What is
“No,” Dior replies on an exhale, right before he succumbs to slumber.
Castiel draws a blank for a second, unsure whether his ears are failing him. Dior’s expression is coy.
The nursery assistant was looking at him in a way that was both awkward and pitying. “I could just take him, sir. He’ll settle once you go.”, they said.
alpha.”
“Do you reckon someone back in England will have news for us when we return?” Balt asks, an indecent smirk firmly in place when Castiel finally looks at him. “Would you like to place a bet?”
Dior makes an affronted sound but does not deny it, “Fine. But it still d-does not change the fact that a prostitute has no such… liberties, like free thought, to choose a f-favourite flower or a favourite colour-”
“That is correct. We have been outside the building for twenty-five minutes.”
“Then it’s time you hired an assistant. And a housekeeper to cook breakfast and do laundry. We can take care of everything else,” Dior said, putting his feet on top of Crowley’s lap, pulling a holier-than-thou expression. “
“Don’t mention it. Now shoo!”
“Been at it for the better part of a decade. ‘M pretty proud.” He says, raising one shoulder in a noncommittal shrug but appearing pleased with the compliment. “So, any idea what we’re looking for? We’ve got spruce, pine, yew, cedar, and fir.”
Castiel gets something akin to scent-induced whiplash with the way Dior’s balances between panic and relief as he continues talking, “According to their choice, I would have been ten when I presented - which is extremely uncommon for an omega of my body type and size. All of my research points the earliest I could have presented as eleven.”
One of these days he’d punch the lights out of this bawd’s head and he’d fucking
“We are discussing trading rights and contracts, is that right?”
right
“Going back to our conversation-” he says.
“You smell… like someone’s poured tar on a heap of rotting flowers and left it out in the blistering summer sun,” Aiden tells him, reluctant. And this? This tells Dior all he needs to know. Aiden has never been anything but courteous when it comes to someone’s personal scent. The fact that he’s so blunt in regards to how crummy he must smell…
. He had not expected it to run quite so deep, jaw clenching throughout the whole retelling of Dior’s life in a compartmentalized version.
The roots, protective as they may be in dark hours, feel suffocating right now - stealing his breath and laughing at his stupidity. They constrict and wind around his ribs, winding their poisonous fiber through his nerves, filling his head with venom. His scent becomes ash and burnt sugar, cloying his own nostrils, nausea gripping him tightly.
He’s in and out in less than five minutes in a toiletry shop, grabbing a good amount of scent neutralising soap. He’s able to buy three times the amount he’s sold for half of his profit on his old ones. This isn’t the same good quality, but it would last Lisa longer.
And Dior
“I need to leave the
? No, that cannot be right.
He might be at the bottom of the barrel but he’s still got arms and legs and doesn’t need anyone else’s.
The sound is feathery and restful so it doesn’t put the omega on edge. He could probably get used to its rhythm and the way it flows over him.
The prince unbuttons his coat himself - after Dior insists he should be doing it - but not taking it off, and takes a seat right against the other man. He takes in his soft pink cheeks, reddened now by warmth and not biting, freezing temperatures.
thing from the truth.” Cas whispers between the sweaty strands of his hair.

“Go back to the
Aaaand I'm back! I hope everyone has been well :]
Dior’s scent is taking on a new turn - one that Cas has not encountered until now: a sweeter, but not as overwhelming, cinnamon as it sometimes gets. It smells joyful but also playful and the alpha is immediately affected. His mood lifts and feels the need to continue this friendly banter.
They walk in relative silence for a minute or so, Castiel racking his brain for something to say but being unable to take his eyes off the man walking in front of him. He’s so busy staring at the way Dean’s hair comes out from under his beanie and curls around it that he almost doesn’t notice the man falling in step with him.
“Are you still cold?” he asks gently, not taking his eyes off the stunning man.
And Castiel?
Castiel’s palms rub against the inside of his elbows, now, fingers caressing the flesh right above it.
When the other omega stops shaking and there are no more sobs to be heard, she pushes at his chest gently and then looks up into his eyes. They’re red-rimmed and glazed over, dried over tracks visible but ignored.
This is the only pawn shop close enough that isn’t high-end and would accept any of his jewelry. Dior’s already tried two others, but they didn’t even bother giving him a quote, sending him on his way without so much as a second glance.
“Forgive me, Dior. Would it be alright for us to depart now?” he asked.
He swallows over and over again, hand over his mouth to stop any possibility of retching.
Alright - this is
Castiel’s heart constricts painfully. He had wanted to get to know Dior more, had craved to know Dior might feel the same about him. He had, somewhere deep in his conscience, thought that they might one day bask in honeyed pecans often. Now, it feels like he has been given every piece of information he was looking for, increased a thousandfold, blinding him. Opening his eyes. Overjoying him. Ruining him.
“Seeing as today you are to attend a number of formal functions at the parliament and court, shall I go ahead and select an appropriate attire whilst you dry yourself, Your Highness?” Alfie said, raising from his bow and gave Castiel a warm smile.
"Will your rut be happening during our stay, Castiel? We need to plan accordingly and if you're amenable, I would like to -" Balthazar started but stopped when Castiel put his hand up to silence his friend.
Somewhere at the back of his head, Dior knows he shouldn’t get in the bath right now. The water is too hot, it’s going to probably burn him in more sensitive areas. But that part of himself is so quiet he can’t hear it over his own wheezing and desperate
Dior smiles, “No. I
He had woken up, taken care of breakfast and the communal bath, then washed himself with plain soap. He’d put on his best suit, made sure his hair was perfect and then anxiously waited for
,” he says, sitting forward in his seat, arms rested along the edges of his chair, hands in loose fists. “You’re basically asking him to compromise his livelihood-”
His friend scoffed and gave him a rueful smile "Have you known me for a naysayer? If I have promised the moon, I shall pluck it with my own two hands and nothing else."
There is nothing wrong with his scent; it smells as clean and wonderful as it usually is, yet Castiel cannot help but feel like there is something inherently
But now? He hadn’t thought he’d ever be out, except under a piece of white cloth. He wasn’t sure what he’d expected, but anxiety and fear were an unexpected outcome.
“That is commendable - finding each other so young and being willing and open to bind yourself to each other,” the prince says, admiration for the both of them flowing through his heart.
“So be it, then,” Cas says, unable to help himself in sliding minutely closer to the other man.
are not.”
Thankfully, his paranoia is wrong and Lisa is still in the bath, skin closer to her normal olive rather than purple. Standing in the doorway, he sniffs the room and hallway, pleased to find that he can only smell himself and the lavender. This should allow them to talk without Crowley sniffing her out and coming to find her.
A knock came right as he was about to reach for the tinder box. “Good morning, Your Royal Highness. May I enter?” the maid asked.
They turn their gazes onto each other, both sporting what can only be described as stupid grins. The coachman tells them he will be waiting in the designated area for carriages, and the prince is just barely able to acknowledge that piece of information.
, is something and he is grateful.

Castiel was stunned to see how easily they talked about the King’s late wives, three of them in total. They had each borne him a daughter only to either die in childbirth or from complications. The King itself had joked about
He looks impossibly endearing, despite the situation.
Dior has no towel or camomile flowers so he makes up for it by bringing his face closer than what’s probably safe since his skin is
“A true gentleman would find a way.”
“He was the one to undo your corset, just so you are aware,” he explains in one breath, turning his eyes away from the omega. “It was ever so tight and you were not breathing properly. He left some burning lavender oil, hoping it will aid the aching and keep you resting for longer.”
. It feels like he is missing an important piece of information. It sits heavily on him.
“Two days?”
The new person slams the door, dropping a fine leather, maroon suitcase on the floor. Fingers with long, razor-sharp,
The longer the conversation went, the closer Meg got to Castiel. He did not find her aggravating at all, most of the time thinking her personality was energising to be around. However, he did not appreciate her fondness of physical closeness and found it very hard to concentrate on anything whenever she was in such close proximity.
“Not every day - Crowley won’t like that,” the omega finally says, voice wavering - but not his eyes.
“Dior,” he says back, the name on an exhale that he hopes does not give away his longing. His inner wolf is all but
He was not aware of how long he must have been gawking at this perfect apparition. Because no real individual could possibly be such a vision. The world would weep and cheer with his every step, sing him praises and yell blasphemy at his existence. It seemed too long a glance and yet not long enough. His hand itched to touch, and caress and kiss - and was that not an incredible thing? Castiel wanted to
The other alpha groans into his hands but slows down for his friend, “You’re right - forgive me, Cassie. I just - I worry about you and I wish you could see yourself as I do: a perfect pain in the arse.”
Castiel gasped faintly. He did not see any way in which this man could become even more captivating, but there it was. “If you will have me,
“They are,” she answered him. “You may call me Meg, Your Highness. I find ‘Margot’ doesn’t suit me right,” she smiles at him good-naturedly. “The pleasure extends to you as well, Monsieur Balthazar.”
“Then let us not keep them waiting anymore,” Castiel said, grabbing his favourite beige coat and folding it perfectly over his forearm.
The throbbing in his abdomen mellows out slightly, a smile creeping on his face. These are good kids. And so, seeing them try in their own way to take care of him fills his heart with pride.
he had told him and Dior had to agree. He had always had the advantage of being better built than most omegas. At 183 centimeters he was exceedingly tall for one, along with a lean but athletic build, rather than the wispiness associated with his primary gender.
He keeps his hands to himself, not without endless effort. “I have too,” he confesses, emboldened by Dior’s own admission. “That is all I have managed to think about these past few days.”
It got easier when he realised the alpha was nowhere to be seen in the parlour anymore. Dior was
,” Caesar says - switching to what must be his mother tongue - interrupting his husband by placing his hand on top of the fist closest to him. “
Castiel takes a proper look around him and finds that the land is not unlike a Scandinavian forest - with shorter trees. He can’t help being impressed. He tells Dean as much and Dean beams once more, obviously unconcerned with what it does to Castiel’s cardiac rhythm.
“Your eyelids are drooping and your heartbeat has slowed down,” the prince states.
“Where did you go, Lisa?”
, his first kiss, the prince had growled at her and shoved her hard enough to cause her to sprawl on the ground, his mind seething that she had dared to be so bold and wanting to rip into her. Once he had seen the scared look on her face he came to a sudden stop, horrified at what he was about to do.
The Prince did not have the courage to look backwards and witness the displeased faces of French nobility. It would not have been the proper thing to do, regardless. And so they both made their way to the entrance where they gave their invitation to the butler and their capes and hats to a female servant. The butler greeted them appropriately then led them down the corridor. He went through a very large set of dark wooden doors with golden handles and immediately announced their presence.
Dior can barely suppress the angry heat threatening his eyes and fights the good fight in stopping a pathetic curve of his mouth. “That’s… perfect.”
Dior manages to get out of bed, slip out of his clothes and dump them into the washing basket before slipping into a robe. Every movement costs him. It takes him thrice as long to make his way down the stairs with his laundry, his breathing against him.
“Anywhere,” Castiel replies in a small breath.
Cas tries to find the words to express everything he is experiencing without overstepping the unseen, heaven-bound wall between them.
He does not give Dior the chance to ask what he means, simply striding back into the omega’s personal space and seamlessly slipping his arm around Dior’s, a perfect mirror of how the man had been holding on to him the whole evening.
“How-” the alpha starts but Dior gives him no chance to continue.
This earns him an annoyed look from Balt, “Yes, well, how was I supposed to know there was a
Annoyance and frustration join the worry that has been bubbling and floating around his head, causing him to groan and resume scrubbing aggressively.
“If I did not know any better, I would have claimed we have stepped inside the Garden of Eden, Balthazar. These gardens are astonishing,” Castiel whispered to his friend, awe slipping between his words. “I can’t smell anything except God’s perfect creations. It’s brilliant.”
“Come get yer combs! Handmade by a beta artisan, out of basswood and cherry and finished off with all sorts of lacquer!” she shouts, a big toothy smile on her face.
“I used to dream they wouldn’t stop multiplying, or that I fell into a sea of chiffon filled with embroidered fish,” Jesse laughs. “Doesn’t sound as scary when I say it aloud, but I assure you it was
Every night after his presentation, in the haunting days where it appeared the whole court was throwing him pitying or frustrated glances, he would pray that he was fine with being an alpha disaster as long as he gets to at least have his inner wolf.
He’d also realised that they had no sort of decorations whatsoever. When they’d moved, Castiel had sold his apartment with all its furnishings and donated everything that wasn’t clothes or mementos.
The prince looks stricken to admit, “I do not know.”
He feels his robe slip free off his shoulders, a loud litany of whimpers falling from between his lips at the cold air licking his wounds.
He’s not going to be able to live with that.
“That is the

When it does, he feels his breath catch, his muscles going tight and heart picking up speed at the image in front of him.

Cain. He was one of his regulars at the
“I’m sure he will appreciate hearing that. I feel like he’s not happy with my independence when it comes to dressing.” Castiel sighs, genuinely affected. “Since when did you care about propriety and palace rules?”
The last line punches an unexpected laugh out of him, “Goodness! I will tell them that next time, shall I?” he quips.
“That’s some nice things you’ve got there,” the beta next to him says, “Where’d an omega get their hands on scented body oils and satin underpants?”

Bathwater is blue and makes soft sounds when you move, embracing you gently, comfortingly.
"Anything interesting happen?”
. He exhaled a contented sigh right along with Jack.
_____________________________________________________________
An unexpected sob breaks free from his throat. Dior can’t deny it anymore- he’s too vulnerable, too strung out. There is nothing left of his walls as he stands in the middle of his room, naked and blistering. He rubs furiously at his face as he feels unrelenting tears drop down.
Castiel doesn’t spare more than a single glance to the receipt, simply putting it into his breast pocket, “I am afraid I have not opened an account with a French bank so I cannot write a cheque - I will send a servant with the necessary banknotes tomorrow.”
. Tears pool in his eyes and start running down his face without preamble, big drops falling onto the wooden floors. He gasps and gasps trying to oxygenate - he can’t take it.
He wants to ask - wants to ask what he smells like to Dior. He wants to know if he likes it, if he thinks he would be amenable to being around it for a long time. He longs to know if he can also tell that Castiel is enamoured and whether he thinks he ought to see a physician because who in their right mind forms such an attachment after just a handful of meetings?
Because Dior can’t be responsible for grabbing him with filthy hands, staining him, causing him to fall.
“What are we to do now, then? Will we be taking a detour?”
The omega raises himself carefully off the pillow in order to sit up in bed, causing the thick, down blanket to pool at his waist. The fire roaring in the room is big enough that the difference in temperature between the room and under the blanket is negligible.
“Good things
“Forgive me, I-” he starts.
,” he almost shouts, ashamed and frantic in the knowledge that he won’t be able to go out tonight, causing him to fall back on his plans. “It’s not even half of what you need for the minimum of two weeks!”
favourite flower?” Dior asks with derision.
Paris was a burst of activity, sounds and smells. People either walked with a purpose or lagged behind, enjoying their surroundings. Castiel was part of that second group. He stood in front of the impressive stone building ahead of him, his heart’s pulse resonating loudly in his ears. He could also feel it travel through his skin, on every centimeter of his body. He had been feeling like he was vibrating from the moment he escaped the palace, through the servant’s door, and the feeling continued to become more and more distinct, to the point that he thought it had become visible.

Dior did as he was commanded and came up to see her sneer hungrily at him. He could feel phantom pains all over his body, wanting to flee. “
“You’ve outdone yourself with this one,
“In this world, you find love and you grab it with both hands,
When there is no answer, he knocks again - this time three consecutive ones.
“We do not,” Cas replies, expression open and maintaining eye contact.
His own thoughts start to unravel. Lately, he has found himself with an abundance of his thought process being focused on Dior. This time, he takes in the way he can feel the wisps of anxiety his wolf is emanating, and he cannot help but let his own curls of satisfaction mingle with them. He is rewarded with what feels like a snap of jaws for these emotions colliding.
“Whenever you call for me, I will come,” Castiel replies, conviction and reverence woven in each letter.
be smothered with the smell of affection? Acceptance?
He never got the chance to broach the subject, for Dior showed him to the private parlour; a multitude of alphas mixing together, playing the ever present card games and pool. A quick look around the room revealed there were no acquaintances of his inside.
The prince does not take the man’s hand as he had done earlier - he no longer feels he has the right. Instead, he hopes his gaze is honest enough to make the omega aware he means the next words from the bottom of his heart.
“Not to worry, Your Highness.” Uriel replied, “The
He got back to his car and dropped in the driver’s seat with an exhausted huff. He looked at the clock - at least he’ll be on time to work today. He pulled out of the car park, his mind wandering to the piece of paper inside his messenger bag.
He turns away once figures pass the threshold, intentions of all shades of mud following close behind. There’s no need to watch what his body remembers, what he can feel dragging painfully over every corner. Curious - he’d have thought there’d be no feeling as a shadow.
The alpha feels the tentative waves of pride from Dior before they get hidden or squashed and replaced with trepidation. He frowns - this is not the first time his scent has done this. If anything, it must have happened at least a handful of times on this outing alone.
Dean laughs and takes off his beanie and scarf, shaking off the snow. “Nah, man. There are still people finishing up in the nursery. That’s just to stop incoming traffic.”
Shaking himself from his trance, he extracted himself from Alastair’s hold and kneeled quickly. “Your Highness, Crown Princess Abbadon. What an honour for this lowly omega to be in your presence.” he greeted.
The doctor opens the door massaging the bridge of her nose and already looking like all she wants to do is drink a bottle - or two - of hard spirits.
No- this is- he’s not sure what it is. His heart is singing praises, chanting prayers of
“First, I have to deal with entitled officials back home - officials who do not know the difference between their scent and mating gland - and now I have to listen to such outdated, oppressive and virulent spiels?” Castiel huffs, scent still rotted to the core.
It’s a futile attempt, though. As soon as he walks into the kitchen, everyone is on his case and they force him to sit down, telling him he needs to rest. His complaints fall on deaf ears.
right. We also came here to enjoy ourselves."
he’d told Dior. They exchanged a few pleasantries but then the alpha had to retire and oversee some finer details before the festivities started.
Forgets that today is when he’s reminded why he hates the colour red and why Doctor Sunder is instructed to pay close attention to him every other week.

“Do you have an appointment,

that was.
“Dior-”
It is technically true - Dior is not mated or courting anyone. And although that should bring relief, it does nothing of the sort. Cas feels like his heart has decided the pit of his stomach is better real estate, despite there not being enough room and constricting everything painfully. Unhappiness coils around him with cold tendrils and he is useless in stopping it.
The omega looks amused at his antics and Castiel is relieved his honesty was not distasteful. “I would have liked to see the coach master's face when he realised what you were up to,” he teases.
checking every centimeter of you, both inside and outside, I don’t suppose you can.”
“That’s right,” Caesar answers and takes a sip of his drink. “I still sew it all myself, of course. The machine is simply able to provide speed along with the quality of my work.”
“Hello, Dior,” Cas replies gently, not breaking eye contact. “We have arrived at our destination.”
: at this point in time, banknotes were considered extremely rare to the common folk due to them being made only in high livre amounts - some of them more than one might make in a year. Coins are much more prevalent and used by everyone (well, not by nobles). Nobles also used to not pay in cash often. Instead, they would open “credit accounts” and pay them weekly, bi-weekly or monthly. Again, this is really just a fancy of the rich, thinking having accounts open with exorbitant amounts rather than carrying coins ‘like peasants' makes them the honey of society. *eye roll*
He turned his head towards his window and watched the night sky with its twinkling stars. It was beautiful, he had to admit, even if there was smoke coming out from most of the chimneys in the area. Beautiful nights like this made him feel inappropriate, filthy. He started scrubbing his skin, an avid need to rip it off creeping up his spine.
When he got to the boiler room, many of the girls and boys on the first floor were sharing the big bathing tub in the middle of the room, steam and soap getting rid of the scents they have accumulated over the day. They were all relatively young, around the same age he was when he’d first come in with Crowley. They were giggling and gossiping with each other. He smiled to himself and made his way over, leaning over the wooden edge of the tub.
“He might never know his father, but I’d like him to have one link to him. A name seemed
He’d totally lost his shit with Cas. The omega didn’t mean to be so angry. He tries so fucking hard to never lose his temper, no matter how low the feeling simmers in his soul every moment of every day. It’s terrifying, that he feels safe enough to lose himself with Castiel, at the same time as feeling petrified of pushing too far and having his nightmare materialised.
He swallows, “Much warmer than expected - it
“Castiel. Nice to meet you, Dean.” Castiel replies. Once his brain catches up with the information given to him and he adds, “Winchester? Are you and Sam the owners?”
Castiel feels himself flush and thanks God he can easily blame it on getting hot in the now-stuffy building. He clears his throat and tries his best not to sound weird, “It’s Jack’s first Christmas. We just moved here and have nothing in regards to decorations. Google told me you’re the only place in the area that does potted trees.” he babbles.
said he’d like to visit him at the
It was at that moment when another figure appeared at the top of the stairs, very obviously the Grand Duke. He spoke with a clear voice, his posture straight and proper, the perfect image of proud, dignified Alpha. “Welcome. You have all made me very happy by attending tonight.” he started. “I would like to take this moment to apologise for my absence this past year. I know I have worried friends and associates and for that, I am regretful. Tonight is to honour my late wife and mate, Colette.”
“I know. But it can still be a pleasant detail, can it not?”
She’s relentless in her orders to
This was real. He’d crossed the channel, he’d crossed half of France, he’d arrived at Versailles, greeted and dined with the Royal family and now was completely alone for the next hour until the maids would come in and prepare him a bath.
It had felt as if someone had punched him right in the sternum, stopping his breathing and broken bones piercing his insides. Dior was no longer floating a few centimeters above the ground, a horrible force promptly hurling him back to reality. But for the chair he was currently holding onto, he would have most certainly collapsed.
“I have, but I will not deny a second breakfast if offered,
“That didn’t even put it in! He just wanted to lick his

works in changing gears.
“Good morning…” he says, voice just above a whisper, “I see you’ve started the party without me.” Dior laughs with half a heart, his other half seemingly absent from his chest, a tight feeling in its stead. He feels weirdly bereft.
“Charlie, good morning. How are you this morning?” He asked, both of them continuing their way to the elevator.
“I have only seen it in bloom once - I had not realised it flowered, until then. The owner told me they rarely ever bloom i-inside - that they need special care and conditions to b-bloom,” he stops for a second before he adds, “He also said they’re worth it.”
“It’s his first Christmas. I felt like I should do something - if not special, just
“Anything our clients give us that isn’t on the list of permitted items, we need to give them to Crowley. He sells them and uses the money for essentials such as scent amplifiers or blockers,” Dior tells him, looking straight at him but body taut with nerves. If the alpha had to guess, the
Dior leans his body forwards, balancing himself on an outstretched arm on top of the bed, the other reaching Cas’ shirt, grabbing hold of the fabric, “So, I beg you, please don’t tell Crowley. I need the money, Cas.”
. Even heaven would probably crack up at him for wishing he could at least spend his afterlife together with him. Dior had felt desperation and sadness many times in his short, miserable life. But nothing could have ever prepared him for this sense of loss. He never had anything worth losing so he couldn’t have known.
The more Cas talked, the more fidgety he became, the topic obviously uncomfortable for him. Dior’s heart sinks into his stomach - does Cas hate the thought of touching him that badly? That he felt the need to make it clear he wouldn’t dare lay a single hand on him?
“You think I don’t know that?” she asks him, tone annoyed. “This isn’t me pining for him and hoping he’ll come back to sweep me off my feet.”
adorable - but rather at the fact that he’s actually considering saying yes. Okay, so fine - he might be overprotective of the boy but nobody can hold that against him.
Castiel was going to contend such a fallacy but the words died in his mouth. Instead, all he could achieve was to try his name on his tongue. “Dior,” he repeated, heart flogging in his chest. What a fitting name for a deity with locks made of gold that had been worn and treasured until it took on a darkened tinge as a result. No other shade of gold will ever do again, they were ruined, never to be glanced at again.
. He needed to because if he smelled half scent bonded no alpha would touch him, and they paid best and if he didn’t get enough centimes then there’s no way he’d be able to help Lisa.
Neither of them moves their hands.
“Hey, hey, buddy. What the fuck do you think you’re-” Dior says, face twisted in a disgusted scowl, emerald turning into grey pools of contempt, eye bags accentuated by the harsh light.
Castiel is entranced by the childish giddiness the omega is showing, and only half-hears himself when he says “Rabbit fur.”
Was that a - It looked very similar to a-
Dior felt bile rising, half wishing he’d empty his guts on the alpha’s shoes. Thankfully, that’s when the servant returned with their drinks, and without letting go of his waist, Alastair dragged him back to where Uriel was standing. A third person had joined him and Dior had to swallow his apprehension. It was no other than the Crown Princess Abbadon.
fingernails lower the cloak’s hood, freeing spectacular waves of endless Hellfire.
between honey and books. Ridiculous.
Castiel does not forget he is supposed to be here to form lasting relationships that will become beneficial to his country in some way, shape or form. No - the decision for such under the table, rude comments is entirely his own. His fury is palpable but it is not disabling his faculties - he knows exactly what he means with his words.
“You did not,” Castiel tries to reassure him but does not make a move to bring his hand close to his again, afraid he would be overstepping now that Dior has been the one to pull away first. “You keep surprising me and somehow I do not stop being taken by surprise,” the prince says.
Dior’s stomach rolls painfully and quickly, bile rising in his throat, burning him like acid.
“Here we are, my Lord,” Dior said as he placed one of his hands on Castiel’s shoulder, yet to let go of his arm. He leaned in closer, and for a second Castiel thought he might keel over. “If you require me, all you need to do is wave me down and I shall come,” the omega whispered, only for his ears.
He stops breathing when his back tears open for his skeleton to fall out.
Dior feels like a jerk, suddenly. “It’s okay, I’m just - I’m just surprised,” he says, trying to soothe her nerves. She’s only been here a couple of months, he doesn’t want to spook her any more than she already is.
“I know. I only thought you might need company that isn’t a bunch of complete knobs.”
Castiel looked around the lavishly decorated hall. It was a magnificent room, flower arrangements exuding luxury without being tasteless, soft runners in seasonal colours, candles and lamps assorted throughout, creating an inviting hue. He took a perfunctory sniff and was impressed to find that the whole area smelled deliciously of cinnamon.
Brigade des mœurs
“It is settled, then. Three-piece suit with accessories,” Castiel addresses the beta who stops whispering in his husband’s ear.
Dior looks at him again and asks, “Would you like to feel it?”
Okay. This is fine. His nose is just blocked, right? This cold is wreaking havoc and he’ll be back to normal by tomorrow. His mind is whirring, the disarming feeling of being unable to discern his surroundings through his nose along with the rest of his sense disconcerting. Is this how betas live? Dior can’t imagine going through this sensation every single day, he feels like someone’s cut off a limb.
- wardrobe, consisting of a simple brown dress, a thin black shawl covering her shaking shoulder and cascading down her front where she’s clutching it between white-knuckled hands. She has a thin pair of flats on that are covered in melting snow, cold-bitten red skin peeking from under her skirt and shoes.
Muscular limbs gather him up, one around the length of his back, palm resting at the base of his neck, another one at the crown of his head. The bed dips and his cheek suddenly meets bare skin, an inhale stolen from him.
His mate tries to continue peeling the robe off his back but Dior cries out in agony, fat tears rolling on the hills of his cheeks, “No, no! Stop, stop, I can’t-”
“I’m sorry,” Lisa starts, looking down and shaking her head, tightening her palms into balls on his bare chest.
“It thrills me to be able to share this with you, Dior,” he comforts the omega, pulling him closer to him ever so slightly, an action which the other man notices, if the spike in cinnamon is to be trusted.
Dior knows the doctor is simply jesting - it’s a running gag between them, proof of their familiarity. This time, however, the wording strikes him in an unexpected way. His feelings weren’t hurt and there’s no self-loathing floating at the back of his mind.
"Very well, Cassie." he heard Balth give a small, resigned sigh. "Just… Please do not shut me out. You know you will always have little old me if you need."

“Your highness, Princess Margot. Are those the escorts’ names, Inias and Hael?” Castiel asks her with genuine interest.
“Chinchilla fur,” he explains. “It’s not very popular yet. They tend to be yellow-gray in the wild. There is a breeder back home who specialises in solid colours.”
Castiel’s canines have never revealed themselves outside altercations or reasons of great frustration and anger. He had associated them with an unseemly version of himself that allows negative emotions to overwhelm him.
The beta closes his eyes and laughs, looking relaxed and giving the half of the room where everything resides a fond look.

“You must know I would never let Tessa chastise you for my shortcomings, Hannah.” he replied kindly, gently grabbing one of Hannah’s hands in both of his. “Fear not, she will not find out and I would be incredibly grateful if you allowed me to assist you, at least with this.”
“That’s… that’s a lot of variety. I’m afraid I have no clue.” Castiel admits, stopping when Dean does and facing the taller man.
They sit in silence together, Dior’s brain working overtime trying to find a way to help her, to ensure Lisa doesn’t have to go through either of those options. But
Dior nods, “Yes. Most are treatable if you’ve got access to a doctor. But what would a penniless nightwalker have? Nothing, Cas. If you’re out there on your own, you’ve got two options: die from some horrible, shitty disease or die at the hands of someone with more power than you.”
It was damn near impossible. He was able to control his scent enough that nobody was able to discern anything different, whilst he still reeled from a deep feeling of rejection. Dior pushed forward, entertained, made some of the guests aware which
Dior didn’t bother telling him that every one of his clients would do exactly that, not bothering to show him such consideration. Keeping his mouth shut was better. He had opened the idiotic thing enough today, even he was growing bored of the sound of his voice. He let the alpha lead him out with no complaints, the feeling from earlier still heavy in his gut, but getting less insistent as they kept walking.
“Please call me Dior, my Lord, for I am not a
He heaves a heavy sigh once inside and gets to work immediately. It’s mindless work where your brain can wander whilst your body takes the brunt. Dior’s thoughts stray to Lisa and all the dangerous situations she might be in.
There
“C-Castiel,” he says, no longer on a soft breath filled with quiet companionship, but harsh and sharp, trembling with uncertainty, fear.
They walk in comfortable silence until they reach their destination. Castiel takes a moment to inhale the scent in the area, now almost engulfed in early darkness, festoon lights and lamp posts illuminating everything.
First of all, there shouldn’t even be any fluff
“There are a dozen other alphas and betas ready to pay the same price that pose less of a threat to his livelihood.”
There is some Spanish in this chapter that I, once again, relied on google translate for, yikes! If any of you speak it and are horrified at it - you have my heartfelt apologies.
Castiel Novak had found out a lot about himself this past year.
“Yes.” he replied breathlessly, no more than a whisper, “I would know no greater pleasure than to receive you, Prince Castiel.” Dior continued, barely managing to string the sentence together.
He turns around to pet her hair, “
This cannot go on or they’ll have a feral brawl on their hands.
Dior's hackles rise. What’s with people and telling him he doesn’t smell right? He smells fine, damn it!
, he fumed.
Castiel watched him go. He watched Dior make his way to the poker table, not sitting but standing in the middle of the players, hands gripping the edge of the furniture, his back arching out the smallest of amounts, buttocks suddenly more pronounced and alarmingly curved. He watched him dip down to many of the patrons’ ears, much like he had done to him. He watched him clap and shower praise when an infuriating alpha grabbed his waist in celebration for a sub-par billiards move.
Lisa is back quickly and places a small book in his palms. He blinks the haziness away and reads the English title.
“I have instructed our coachman to take us to the nearest dressmaker,” the prince states simply, reclaiming his seat next to the omega when the carriage starts moving again, just as close as the first time. “It was my own blunder that you have come so close to being frostbitten and hypothermic. It is only right that I correct this - we are getting you some warm clothes.”
call me that!” Ruby flares, anger flying off her almost palpably, “How is he still at the top? I’ve counted the amount of nobility he brings in - it’s less than what I do. Crowley, if you’re being generous with his numbers I swear I-”
“Is that yours?” Dior asks, staring at the silver details on the sides of the ash-grey wood.
Castiel is unfazed, gaze transfixed onto the glittering orbs of fir-green, not for the first time wondering how people have traveled long and far in search of wonders of the earth, when there are two whole worlds floating inside those eyes, windows to the most radiant of souls.
Christmas.
With that, the group left the parlour that was designated for poker and pool and headed back into the main ballroom. Dior headed to the cloak room and waited for the servant to bring back his outerwear. He couldn’t smell anything on the teenager, which indicated he was a Beta. And yet, Dior could see his cheeks reddening at the sight of him, quickly scurrying to the closet. If even a beta’s very limiting scenting abilities were able to start such a reaction, Dior suspected the new enhancing bath salts Crowley purchased were doing their job. Jesus, he could even smell himself which never happened outside of his heats and he was most definitely not due for another month or so.
He could feel his face break in what must have been a hugely dumb smile. His face hurt, using muscles he almost never used. It only grew that much bigger when
After retrieving the blanket, Dior leads the way out of the apartment, down the stairs and back out in the cold. They stand side by side for a long moment, perhaps both taking in the way the night seems colder, darker than it had before. Or that might just be Castiel.
Dior watched the alpha straighten himself up, retouching his cravat and pulling on his waistcoat. He allowed his gaze to trail down the man’s body, covered in a wonderful blue suit that did nothing but make him glow, as if he was the one radiating light. If anyone were to ask, Dior did
Dior does as commanded, floating on a terror-wefted raft.
Everyone turns to Dior, watching his posture straightening in that attentive way Castiel has catalogued at the back of his mind as one of Dior’s excited ticks.
?” he asks, helpless to stop him if he does. He won't survive it.
Dior clenched his teeth and gave a small smile, turning away from the game with a flashy bow,“
he should refuse. It is not the custom, it is impossibly forward and if anyone in high society were to find out it would cause damage to Dior’s reputation.
Dior was strangely embarrassed when that feeling set itself firmly - and apparently quite permanently - in his stomach, noticing how it was travelling down to his now stirring cock. He was afraid he might start leaking slick any moment now, and so he did not move for a little while, trying to get a grip on his arousal. It wasn't a very successful try. That smell only seemed to be getting stronger, slowly destroying his resolve to run away. Instead, he started to walk briskly in the direction he thought it was coming from, coming to a halt when another body slammed into him unceremoniously.
“Dior,” he whispers, openly worried, eyes searching him. “You’re awake.”
Dior scoffs bitterly when revisiting that particular memory - ‘important’ isn’t a word associated with him,
“You have your work cut out with this one. His baby blues could guilt anyone into feeling sorry for him.” the assistant said and then handed over a piece of paper. “It’s the nursery’s Christmas schedule. There’s information about the days we’ll be closed and the short days.”
“It’s alright, Cas. I get it,” Dior snips, anger trickling back into his speech. He’d rather let Alastair use frayed whips than listen to Cas’ reasoning for avoiding touching him.
“Well I’ve got fucking news for you, Your Highness. It doesn’t work like that!” he shouts, voice quaking an octave higher at the same time the pain at the top of his head spikes.
Dior is still silent when they reach the carriage - still has not uttered another word when the prince retrieves the blanket and wraps it around his shoulders this time, instructing him to keep hold of it before closing the carriage door and disappearing around to the front of it.
“American, actually,” she corrects.
Right. They
With another curtsey, Hannah left Castiel on his own so she could make way to his private bathroom and start whatever concoction she did that procured the most amazing of baths. He lit his fireplace quickly and with ease, having done this many a time before, to his family’s chagrin. He did not allow himself a lot of freedom, but he craved not feeling like a glass bird in one of his mother’s greenhouses. Castiel watched the flames get substantially bigger for a minute before heading to his desk and sitting down. He had been up late last night wrapping up any of his outstanding responsibilities before his leave in a week. Thankfully, not a lot remained to be done, yet he wished to have them all filed and ready to go either tonight or tomorrow.
Ah. He knew this as fact so he deserves this humiliation. The slick that started forming between his cheeks is no longer a pleasant rub, but a grating reminder that even after all this time, he still has not learned his damn place.
And so, with the weather on their side, the ship departed from Dover and started its way to Calais. It was marvellous to see what a difference a few hours and a small body of water could make. Castiel already felt at ease and it had only been a few hours.
Her hair over his face when she undoes the ropes and turns him on his back. Her nails when they intentionally nick when putting on a new silk robe over his leaking shoulders and tightening the cord too much. Her smoking soul when she caresses his face with glacial words of ‘
As they make their way around the historical site, they stop to admire a lot of the details in the stone, discussing possible techniques that have been used and typical French architecture. Castiel shares his favourite parts and so does Dior. They are content in discussing their differences. When Castiel tells the other man he has a penchant for the Romantic and likes the Rococo style slightly more than Neoclassicism, Dior looks at him like he has suddenly grown a second head.
He had not realised feeling them inch down could feel so… nice.
“Isn’t it pleasant, Cas? I’ve never seen anything like this before,” Dior asks him, eyes dancing lively, a playful, childlike grin dancing alongside them. He looks so carefree in this sudden moment of wonder, freer than he has been all afternoon.
They’re led through a short hallway and into a sitting room. Half of the room is full to the brim with bolts upon bolts of fabric, rolls of delicate lace and satin ribbons scattered everywhere in a multitude of colours and patterns. There are high bookcases against the walls - some of the shelves are filled with books, some with sewing patterns either neatly folded up or dangling down from under makeshift weights keeping them in place.
At the end, as they all exchanged goodbyes, Castiel noticed Princess Margot’s gaze lingered on him longer than necessary, a smile permanently on her lips. He wished they hadn’t worn so many perfumes. Being unable to scent the mood in the room was majorly inconveniencing.
the fourth line on the plaque reads.

Cas wants to laugh but he leaves the omega to do as he wishes and addresses the other two, “Again, I am very grateful to you for accommodating us. I will not forget this kindness. Until next time.”

Blunt. Uncouth. Naive. Idealistic.
