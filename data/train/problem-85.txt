Fuck, it’s a stretch.
“Next time?” John grinned. “Already planning a next time, are we?”
Rosie.
“Yes?” She answered eagerly.
Sherlock rolled her eyes.
John couldn’t help the laugh that escaped him.
The sound of John's voice brought him round, his magical blue eyes fluttering open.
“No, I mean, where was she last night, slash this morning?”
John nodded, and remained where he was. Sherlock dropped his legs off Johns shoulders, and just lay there, catching his breath.
“PUSH!”
“Oh!” Sherlock squealed in surprise as John dropped them both on to the bed in a tangle of long, gangly teenage boy limbs.
“They put fucking Nair in my body wash!”
John tries out Sherlock’s new toy.
“Now, Sherlock.” He ordered.
“Have you ever had a friend?”
No, Eurus is not going to be important. I’ll kill her off, or something like that. I just thought it was a good song to have.
As sexy as Sherlock looked in his little outfit, John preferred him completely naked. He made quick work of the corset, and pulled it off.
She went downstairs, and left the two boys to get ready for bed. “How long are your parents ok with me staying here?”
“I’m sure.”
“I would prefer if my concern went unmentioned. We have what you’d call a difficult relationship.”
“Are you alright?” Mycroft asked as she placed a hot cup of Well sugared tea in Sherlock’s hands.
John looked between it and Sherlock before handing it to her.
John hesitated, batting his eyelashes at Sherlock, shifting his weight between his feet.
“Not to be, cliche but you ummm... have an eyelash on your cheek.”
“What can I say? System is fucked.” Rosie huffs as she places a cup of tea in front of moly.
“Alright.”
“This is the second time I’ve had to shower today.” Sherlock grumbled, referring to the jam incident.
“Thank you.”
Sherlock placed a cup of tea in front of John along with a plate of biscuits.
Next chapter...
Sherlock receives a birthday present from John.
13th of August 1918
“Mmm?” The young man murmured, rolling his head down to look at her.
She ushered him indoors, and instructed him to wipe his feet.
“Hello... is Sherlock here...?”
“Why don’t we get cleaned up?”
He stopped in the door way, mouth open, eyes wide.
Sherlock said nothing, but flopped back to lay his head on the arm rest.
“I resent that.” Mycroft grumbled in response to their mother’s greeting.
I would laugh, but fuck... I can’t... I can’t...
“Yes, yes it is.”
"Sherlock, come on. Let's just go."
“Sherlock, darling, you need to come downstairs.”
Sherlock grinned as he saw the towel rise around johns cock. He ran his tongue down johns abs, making the blond shiver.
Ah, the art of seduction, I should change my website...
“I suppose.” John murmured as he exited the room.
Sherlock turned to look at John. His grip on her wrist tightened.
John held out the white band, decorated with three, pink roses.
Enjoy!
“You’re Mum is so great.”
“Maybe...”
“Hey.”
They lay like that for a moment, basking in the after glow, chests heaving, hearts pounding, bodies gleaming with sweat, their skin sticking together.
Sherlock had been sat in her play room all morning, leaving a few times, only to be ushered back in because she was getting under people’s feet. Her father had left for work, her mother was busy baking a pie for the new neighbours, and her older sister was no doubt holed up in her room. The age gap was substantial, meaning the pair didn’t have anything in common, other than their nature. Both were very clever, and blunt, but it was slightly more palatable on the wiry teenager than it was on the curly haired child. Sherlock had a habit of freaking out her peers, and there for spent a lot of time alone. The older of the two was much the same, but she rather enjoyed the solitude, unlike Sherlock, who was alone by default.
“Ummm... Do you have a diaphragm?” The blond asked, his voice husky, knowing full well the odds of which were very unlikely.
“You have just been throttled.” He says, not amused.
He flashes me a flirty grin before helping me off the table.
While I am charmed by his flattery, I cannot look beyond his ordinary stupidity.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow at him, cocking his head.
He looked back at himself in the mirror.
“Oh, she’s a pretty little thing.”
Fuck, I’m so hard for him.
John inhaled, but still didn’t say anything.
I do as I’m told.
John pulled his hand out from between them, and tangled it in Sherlock’s curls instead.
I remain seated in his lap for a moment, my head pressed against his.
He pants against my lips as I lead him over to the sofa.
I reconnect our lips, and pull him to me by his hips.
“I’ll miss you...”
“You know i’m not as boring as you think I am. So I don’t hook up with random people at bars,” She started, locking eyes with Irene. “Maybe I don’t do sexy skits in cheerleading costumes.” Rosie blushed as Molly faced her. “And maybe I don’t have sex in public bathrooms.” She turned to look at John and Sherlock who were both trying to resist sleep. “But that doesn’t make me boring! You know what, screw you guys. Maybe I will stay with Mycroft.” She grabbed her bag, and stormed out of the club.
Sherlock blushed and nodded his head. It hadn’t been an easy road for John and Sherlock. For starters, Sherlock had no idea John was coming on to him.
“Nah, but you are. Cos you like him.”
“Look, maybe we should start with something easier.” John said slowly, pulling his boxers back up.
The blond let out a guttural moan in response before bucking his hips again.
“Fine, Thank you. And yourself?”
I have no idea what I’m doing.
She noticed John’s voice break. Her nanny had placed a hand on his back, and was rubbing small circles between his shoulder blades.
"What about standing?"
“I’ve always got your back.” Johns said with a wink.
“Cut the small talk. What is it?”
“Yes, he’s upstairs. Come on in.”
John thrusted his hips forwards again so his cock was submerged about five inches.
When I return, he’s sat hugging his knees, staring intensely at the Jeremy Kyle show.
“Hey, mike. Yeah, I just got here.” The blond smiled, thrusting his hands in to the pockets of his leather jacket.
“So, why don’t you tell me what’s wrong?”
He wanted to be inside him when that happened.
“You won’t be flashing your nipples to anyone today though, will you?”
“I’m just off to the shops. Will you two be alright?”
“Has she eaten?”
“I’ll come back later then, shall I?”
“We can watch it when we go home.”
“You Alright?” John asked, bring their intertwined hands up to his lips, pressing a kiss to Sherlock’s knuckles.
He was so close, a few more seconds and he’d be a goner. He forced himself to open his eyes, desperate to see what John was doing. John had his head thrown forwards, eyes clenched shut, wrist frantically pumping up and down his leaking shaft.
“You want to order something for tea?” John asked after a moment, turning to look at Sherlock.
"No, we are not, as wedgies are not illegal." Sherlock quipped, clasping his hands behind his back.
“It’s eight thirty, why do you look so happy...oh my god.”
“Where’s mum?” He asked after a moment, reluctant to move away from the doorframe.
“Brownies.”
“Oh, you’d like that wouldn’t you?”
“Damnit. You’re right, I don’t.”
“Don’t you have some pies to stare at longingly? Get out of my room.”
John age: 16
“What?” John asked as he snapped out of his daze.
“How do you know that?”
John huffs, and rolls his shoulders back.
“So dinner?”
“Mycroft knows everything.”
“Is anybody here sober? I know I’m not.” Sherlock giggled as the pair wobbled in to the hall.
The next day when I came home, Sherlock had cooked.
“So, why did you ask me here?”
“Hey, baby.”
He desperately tried to avoid flinching when her hand come in contact with the bite mark, then his intentions changed to keeping the grin off his face as his thoughts circulated back to last night for the umpteenth time.
‘I don’t care if Monday’s blue,
“I never said it was ok.” Sherlock shook her head. “I just said it was what you had to do.”
They all turned to look for the brunette. They managed to catch her eye when she took a break from sticking her tongue down the girls throat, and waved her over.
John realises he has a thing for Sherlock in P.E. uniform, and he can’t go home to deal with it.
“Love you too.”
With that, she ran off towards the boy who called out to her, and left the school grounds. John left too, and wandered along the street, kicking rocks out of his path, and contemplating what a weird day he’d had. Sherlock was incredible. I mean, John could see why he annoyed people, but he was brilliant. He wasn’t going to allow that sally girl to make deductions for him, and chose to make his own judgments. A noise from the left startled him, which made him halt in his tracks. He whipped round to see a tall figure step out from an alley way.
I feel my stomach sink.
“Enough! Enough!”
He leans back, and nods his head. He’s not crying anymore, so I suppose that’s a good thing. He grimaces after a pause, and looks down between us.
Sherlock nodded enthusiastically, panting quietly. John slowly sunk to his knees between Sherlock’s legs, tightly gripping at his thighs. Sherlock let out a whine when he felt Johns hot, wet tongue run across his dripping slit. Sherlock tasted sweet with almost a tropical note.
“Oh god...” He groaned.
“I’ll take that as a yes- oh...” He trails off when I move my lips down to his neck, mouthing at his warm skin, dragging my tongue across the surface.
I smile, and lean over to kiss him.
“Have you... cleaned yourself?”
John marvelled at Sherlock’s bluntness, but trailed after him into the living room all the same.
“It’s Mycroft.”
Sherlock’s expression was one of amusement and surprise as he looked at John.
John pulled back for a moment looking somewhat unconvinced.
“Oh god, John fuck me.”
John grabbed Sherlock by the arm, and all but dragged him out the door, and continued in this manner almost all the way to the top of his road.
John began rutting against her, meeting her hips as she rocked.
“John, these are so cool, thank you. Where did you find them?”
Sherlock chased John into the living room, stopping abruptly when he saw the blond had jumped on to the coffee table and was now slightly taller.
“Mmm?” John queried as he stepped closer, daring her to continue.
“It’s Saturday... so, no.”
Everyone nodded their agreement, and Mr and Mrs Holmes went to pay the bill.
“Make you scream my name.”
John ceased his laughter when he heard his phone ring.
“No, I’m alright thanks...”
"May I take a look at her?"
“Oh, you don’t have to.”
Damn it, everything hurts.
Any story from his past just makes me want to hug him so close, hold him so tightly that I might break him.
“Alright, we’ve got to get washed up.”
John offered a still trembling Sherlock a hand, and carefully helped him in to the bath. It was warm and soothing on his skin, the herbal sent of the lavender bubble bath relaxing him further. John sat himself in the chair and let Sherlock rest his head on his thigh. They sat like that for a moment whilst John relayed stories of his trip, and Sherlock listened eagerly.
When I still don’t budge, he clicks his fingers and indicates to the space in front of him as a summons.
"What, in your pyjamas?"
“Yes...” Sherlock moaned, tilting his pelvis up further.
She couldn’t open her mouth to speak any words, so an incredibly enthusiastic nod was all she could provide.
propped up on the sofa,
‘Sanctify my sins when I pray.’
“I’ll make sure he’s gone, ok? Maybe wait in a cafe, and I’ll sort him out.”
Sherlock shook his head.
Well, not a lie exactly... just not the truth.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I do. But not like that.”
Sherlock clenched his teeth, and threw his head forwards as a strangled moan escaped him.
He gives me one last kiss before slipping through the door and disappearing in to the dark.
(See the end of the chapter for
If I type ‘stubborn’, predictive text suggests ‘bastard’ next. That could work too 😆
John was sat in the living room when she came down the stairs, a cup of tea already clasped between his hands.
Sherlock explained where he’d been, but left out the part where he’d given a speech on the wonder that his John Watson.
Said boy turned to look at Irene, who was eyeing him over her glass of wine.
That’s when Sherlock pressed his lips to johns.
I don’t understand why people cry at weddings. I don’t understand why people laugh when they’re nervous. I don’t understand when people are mad at me. But what confuses me most is how emotions make people do things, manipulating them like puppets.
“You sure you’re ok?”
“Fuck...”
“What happened?”
“Mmmmm...” John groaned low in his throat.
Sherlock rolled back under the covers, and buried his face in the pillows as resisting John in his rugby uniform was a less than favoured task of his.
“Oh fuck!” Sherlock wailed as he felt John pulsing inside him as he finished.
“Do you have any other children?”
“Are you getting off on this?”
“Mrs Watson, I need you to look at me.” Sherlock said as softly as he could. “John is taking care of Harry, and an ambulance is going to be here any minute. She’s going to be ok. I promise you. Neither of us is going to let anything happen. She may be unconscious, but you need to be strong for her. You need to be strong for John.”
“I’m here, I’m here.”
“What... what the fuck was that?”
“John, I haven’t seen you for days, and this is how-“
“Mum isn’t brave enough to say this, but you need to stop this! It isn’t fair to anyone!”
“What? What is it?”
I can tell when he’s close. His breathing quickens and his whole body tenses.
Her body was jolting, and little beads of moisture were penetrating the collar of his shirt.
He was close, so close, his erection throbbing, his whole body convulsing and spasming in intense pleasure.
Sherlock returned to his room after a quick shower, clothes hanging off his damp form, hair wet, towel around his shoulders. When he opened the door, John had his head pressed against the wall.
Mr Holmes walked over to greet his daughter, and help her down from her bike.
I have to fit him inside of my body.
“Yes.” I reinstate as I begin unbuttoning his shirt.
“Oh fuck- Mmmnngh!” John howled, doubling over as his orgasm hit him.
He finished checking me about five minutes ago. Now he’s just holding me, and stroking my hair. It’s nice.
“He looks a bit tired sherl. Perhaps you should put him down for a nap.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes as he thought about the truth of this statement.
“Yes... while you were still... ah... asleep.” Sherlock moaned with a roll of his neck.
“Mycroft needs you to be his fake girlfriend.” Sherlock said exasperated.
“You like that?”
“Inmate, get moving.” Lestrade barks.
“I mean you have stayed before. But I suppose it’ll be more... fun... when you’re not sad.”
I falter for a moment before looking up. He’s regarding me with a look that doesn’t read as unimpressed in the slightest. In fact, he looks rather bemused.
John groggily prised his eyes open, the sunlight glaring through his curtains.
“Not tomorrow, no. Or Rosie for that matter. You are more than welcome to borrow Irene though.”
“Sherlock, Sherlock, let down thy hair.”
John shut the door, and slumped up against it.
At his mother’s call, a dark haired boy appeared a few yards away, a cricket ball in hand.
“Told you you’d have a different opinion when you were drunk.”
“Yes, I would have preferred a dog to a sister. Or a cat. Or a goldfish.” Mycroft grumbled, narrowing her eyes at the younger child.
He stopped in his tracks, and turned to look at John. A smile appeared on his face upon seeing the blond.
“You ok?” Sherlock asked after a moment when she noticed how deeply john was breathing.
“How long has this been going on?”
“What?”
“Sherlock! Go out! There’s £20 in my coat pocket, take John out for dinner!” They heard Mycroft yell through the wall.
His face softens immediately, even what may be a smile tugs at his lips. His eyes quickly drop down to scan over my form, lingering for a split second on the towel covered portion.
“What are you doing?”
He’d never touched her there before.
I huff out a breath in annoyance. I don’t like where this is going.
Sherlock left for her room, and wrote out her letter, all the while contemplating her sister’s odd behaviour.
“Thank you.”
Everything already tasted like booze.
Sherlock knew John wouldn’t appreciate kissing him after sucking him off.
“Maybe we should go out.” John stated.
He had a son.
“I could give it a try.”
13th of June 1917
Sherlock didn’t look to convinced, but her liqueur addled brain quickly switched her focus to the lit cigarette between John’s fingers.
The brunette smiled wildly.
“How nice.”
Sherlock was so use to other people saying ‘comforting nonsense’ like this, and the recipients taking their word as gospel. He always labelled these people as sentimental buffoons, and yet here with John, he found himself believing his every word.
Sherlock guessed he should probably ask John the same question.
Right, that’s the final straw.
Whoops.
He nods in understanding and purses his lips.
John quirked his eyebrows at Sherlock’s tone towards his brother.
He’s getting closer, moving down the bookcase. “And I know you don’t really want to.”
"And that means it's ok for you to attack him? What is the matter with you two?!"
Sherlock winced, and balled the sheets up in to his fists.
“What is going on with you?” I tease, gently poking his shoulder.
Sherlock had set out to prank John, but the brunette had been rather distracted as of late. John soon found out it was due to a promise both he and Mycroft had made to take their parents to the theatre at the weekend, and the fact that he couldn’t find a loophole in the contract the pair had drawn up was stressing him out.
Sherlock wandered into her father’s study, and came back with a small tub of his less favoured, but still fine quality tobacco. She came back with the tub, and presented it to Greg.
“Is it because-“
She smiled to herself as she looked out the window of her kitchen and spotted John on the lawn, a small girl playing on the floor before him.
“Who are you here to watch?”
John ducks his head, his lip chewed between his teeth in a grin.
‘When I pray,
A strain is put on John and Sherlock’s friendship when the former goes to secondary school, and their age difference really starts to show.
“Suppose I’d better.”
/He swirls his tongue, sucking, licking, swallowing round my cock.\
“And yes,” Irene said, cutting off whatever he was going to say. “We convinced Professor Fussy Face here. He’s on board.”
Lily sat down on the other side of Mrs Watson, and poured herself a cup.
Take a hint, Rosie.
Mycroft’s lips curled upwards for a moment before she caught sight of Lucy out of the corner of her eye, and the smile became a frown of irritants.
“I thoroughly enjoyed that.”
"How have you not seen Spider-Man?"
Two hours in silence.
“No, no, it’s not.”
A gentle hand is placed on my shoulder, and a cup of tea placed before me.
“Sherlock- mmm!”
“John, I’m going to go downstairs to flag down the ambulance. Try not to yell at your mother.”
Sherlock rubbed his eyes, and arched his back.
In his distracted state, John managed to get him to let go, and and lay him amongst the pillows.
Her heart sank. She jumped up, and followed Mrs Hudson down the stairs.
“So wet and hard... so desperate for your big cock. You need to buy some lube, because the second we get home, you need to fuck me. I need to be fucked.”
The guard.
“Oh, Good. You know, you’re welcome to stay as long as you’d like, John. You can maybe nip home for some clothes after school.”
“Yes, John I want you to fuck me.”
He doesn’t sound annoyed that I’ve kept it from him, instead merely baffled.
“What would you like for dessert?”
Blood.
Sherlock struggles to adapt to life without her companion.
Sherlock’s voice, and her hand on his stopped him from spiralling further.
“Go on. I’ll catch you later.” Richard said, nudging the blond’s shoulder.
I break the kiss to look down between us and see that he’s not even fully sheathed inside me yet.
It’s not the feeling of being gagged, it’s a combination of being deprived of something you desperately want to do, in my case, scream out how well I’m being fucked.... and having someone assert their power over you...
“Sherlock?”
“Yes.” He said quickly. He didn’t really feel like having his parents company when entertaining John.
10:56
Sherlock knelt up from the blanket to lean on Johns arm.
“I need you inside me.” I growl as I bite at his ear, and rub my foot up against his leg.
“So, Mol you see anyone you like?”
“Yes, well.”
Sherlock shrugged, then rolled over so he was on his back.
“Come on then. My place.” He said quietly so as not to be overheard.
John makes this decision for me as he brings his hands down to my ass and begins pulling me towards him with rapid vigour.
“Thank you.”
“I asked you whether you brought lunch? Because if you didn’t, they can make it in the kitchen.”
Sherlock looked over to the cup beside her. It was the third she’d drunk that day. She looked back to Mrs Hudson with puppy dog eyes.
“But we’ll be back next week.”
“Come on, hurry up!” Sherlock yelled as she waited at the door with Johnathan in his pram.
“Mmm...” He mumbled, dropping his head to rest on johns neck.
I can feel his lengthy cock at the apex of my thighs, pressing in to my skin, turning me on to the point that the exuberant, titillating sensation in my abdomen is becoming overwhelming.
I’m getting worried about you. Please let me know if you’re ok.
“That teacher of yours in physics.”
“That’s better.”
“Mr Watson? Your sister has woken up. Your mother is with her now.”
“So what do you want to do?” John asked.
John’s lips taste like cum.
Hope you guys enjoy! Thank you for all the lovely comments!
She provided to be a faithful ally after all.
“Wear the purple dress you got From Mrs Hudson for Christmas!” Her mother called down the hall. She put on said dress, and tried to run a comb through her hair. After a battle with her ebony locks, she went downstairs to find Mrs Hudson.
Sherlock, normally quick on the uptake, was at a complete loss for words. He stood, non verbal, non blinking, just staring in to space.
“Yes, good idea.”
“Well?” John asked when the song finished.
From this angle, he doesn’t go as deep.
He affectionately bumps my shoulder before disappearing down a corridor.
“Oh fuck.”
“You’re so beautiful. Just like your mother.”
“How forward.” I muse.
Sherlock and John become a bit more aquatinted with each other’s bodies.
I lock the door behind me before all but collapsing against it.
Sherlock shivered as John moved his finger inside his slicked up entrance.
He shoved a fist in to his mouth to silence himself as he reached his climax, the fact that the floor would need therapy and a good once over with a mop completely forgotten as waves of pleasure hit him. Sherlock on the other hand let out a loud, lust filled cry as he came.
“Oh Jesus...”
“You know a situation is bad when one has to resort to assuring the other it ‘could be worse’.”
“We shouldn’t have to apologise. It’s Irene that wound her up.” Rosie said, pointing a finger at the brunette.
“In other words, I think she has developed depression.”
Sherlock jumped up from the bed to get dressed, settling on a pair of jeans and one of Johns hoodies. John slipped the remote in to his pocket, and the pair excited the room.
“I love it.”
“Thank you for being you.”
Sherlock nodded enthusiastically, licking his lips.
Mrs Hudson couldn’t bring herself to abolish the older Holmes child, and instead went back to affectionally gazing at the youngest.
I look round and meet eyes with a very concerned looking John.
I look up from the floor and over to John. He’s staring at me intensely with steely, hooded eyes.
“Alright, I’ll look up movie times.”
24th of June 1913
“Mmmm...” Sherlock groaned, his eyes fluttering closed this time instead of violently clenching.
“Just try it.”
“Tried?” Molly asked.
“Lieutenant Watson! Parcel for you!”
He goes quiet.
John laughed.
Christmas Day arrived just as it did every year, but the blanket of snow brought frostbite, the smell of turkey replaced with gunpowder, and the Christmas carols were sung with horse voices, barely holding on.
Sherlock still has four months.
“Terrible about that inmate, isn’t it?”
It was then that John noticed the prefect badge on the boy’s left lapel.
Well, fuck.
Oh god, this boy is going to kill me.
“By that you mean hooking up with literally anyone. Cool.”
His chest is rising and falling steadily, his Adam’s Apple bobbing as he swallows, and his heart is beating away like a rapid drum. It’s just too tempting an offer to resist. I slowly dip my head, and press my lips against his milky white skin.
“Sorry I didn’t say anything to warn you.” He blushed.
“Mmmm...” Sherlock groaned softly.
Fuck, I hate this shift.
“Sherlock?”
“What makes you assume I did something?”
“Is there anything else you want me to do?” John asked, mouthing at the sweet spot on Sherlock’s neck.
10th of July 1917
“Good night, John.”
He rested his chin on his hands as he stared up at Sherlock in adoration. He looked so gorgeous in his post climactic bliss, his dark curls stuck to his forehead, eyes dark, cheeks flushed, tears staining them... oh shit.
Sherlock swirled his tongue around the head, occasionally swiping across the slit. Sherlock swallowed around him, making him yelp. Sherlock gasped through his mouthful when he felt johns hand at the back of his head. He looked up, and saw John’s eyes squeezed shut in pleasure. He loved pleasuring John, listening to him moan, watching him cum. Sherlock did his best not to gag when John’s hips bucked forwards, ramming his cock down his throat.
Sherlock didn’t bother waiting for any more information. She ran out of the house without her shoes, or a coat, ignoring the chill down her spine, and the rocks under her feet. She knocked frantically on the door till the housekeeper came to let her in.
“I trust you to be sensible. I won’t say anything more about it now, but if you want to talk, I’m here.”
She definitely remembered we were going out tonight, as her stylish outfit would suggest.
“Lestrade.”
John pressed his lips up against Sherlock’s, opening the brunette’s mouth with his own. Sherlock gasped in to johns mouth when he felt his hand on his cock.
John laughed.
Look who got all poetic and tragic? 😆
John shot his load with a deep moan, clawing at Sherlock’s sides.
“Do you have visitation tomorrow Holmes?”
Rosie and Greg laughed, but Sherlock seemed less amused.
Sherlock smiled to himself. When they got to Sherlock's house, he gave John the keys, his hand eye coordination a little impaired.
John shook his head.
Unsurprisingly, Sherlock has very little opinion when it came to those questions, but he was more than happy to listen to me when I voiced mine.
“Ok, so what are we gonna do?”
“What the fuck?”
“I don’t really know. Something about east winds.”
“Would you cut that out?” John asked as he watched the other boy pace about.
“Come on baby, we’re going home.”
“Sure.” Sherlock said with a shrug.
The following week, Sherlock began working in the labs at Bart’s.
“What do you think?”
“Sorry, I shouldn’t have asked.”
They heard a clang of pots and a shout from the kitchen before Sherlock reappeared in the doorway.
He must be so bored, his brilliant mind wasted.
Sherlock nodded, and took a seat next to Mrs Watson.
I look down at myself to make sure I no longer have an opposing erection. That would be quite the talking point of the cafeteria, I imagine.
I’ve never felt so full in my life.
Sherlock ran her fingers through his hair, damp with sweat, and gently ran her other hand down his back.
“Oh, did you?”
“I am, but you’re not having anymore.”
Her bleeding, lower lip trembled as she rolled her head in the pillow, her sweaty curls sticking to her head.
Johns voice was soft and comforting as he looked down at Sherlock with deep affection.
“Happy April fools, babe.”
/Sherlock moves his head up and down, taking my cock inch by inch. His mouth is warm and wet, and it’s so good, so hot...\
Whenever I caught his eye, his cheeks would flush, and he’d offer me a coquettish smile before ducking his head.
Sherlock looked up from the pile of clothes strewn about her room and over at Mycroft who was leant against the doorframe.
She felt as though their was a rock in the pit of her abdomen.
John tore after her, gaining on her after a few painstaking strides on his aching leg.
“Mr Holmes, you’re under arrest. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.”
“It’s not months anymore John, it’s weeks.” I grin.
“The new guard is a military man.”
Sherlock smiled and leant her head against John’s.
We pull apart, and go about retrieving our clothes. I stand up to reach for my shoes, but almost immediately topple over and fall back down on to the cushions.
“Maybe.”
“So, where’s Harriet?” Mycroft asked after a moment.
“Fuuuuck...” I groan as I bury myself to a hilt with a firm thrust. “Oh you’re so tight... fucking hell.”
Need me to say it another way?”
“How’d you like your... gift?” He drawls as soon as I shut the door to the cupboard.
Sherlock was very good at getting her way, so it was no surprise to her that this was the answer. She now had to walk down the drive to get to John’s, which took an extra few minutes. She had told him her mother had said yes before she’d even asked her, so John was ready at the door.
He was going to have sex.
I turn my head back again when I hear a commotion coming from the far side of the room. The other inmates are jostling the blue eyed one, who’s blushing profusely. He doesn’t seem upset, embarrassed maybe, but otherwise unaffected. He’s got his head down as he comes over to bus his tray. I can’t see his ID from this angle. I can’t let him leave again.
“Yes, yes, yes!”
“I am.”
The rain subsided within the hour. Sherlock handed Lucy over to Mrs Hudson, then went into the kitchen to retrieve the tin. She went out to her bike, strapped the tin in her basket, and cycled off down the lane, careful to avoid the puddles.
The next morning, Sherlock awoke before John. He was sleeping soundly, his hand hanging off the bed, still clutching hers. She squeezed his hand gently before letting go, and getting up to go in to the kitchen. Mrs Watson was sat at the table with Lily.
“Mmmmm...” She moaned, lolling her head to the side.
“Hey, how comes Mycroft didn’t come?”
He thought he’d pass out as the intense euphoric feeling spread through out his body. John was now squirting chocolate sauce along his hipbones. It was too much, too much teasing, too much pleasure, too much-
Sherlock rolled his eyes then joined in the cheering. They saw John hugging his team mates before running over to them. Sherlock couldn’t help but ogle him, his kit clinging to his muscled form, tanned skin glistening with perspiration, beach blond hair stuck up at all angles.
He hoped John didn’t notice. John did.
“Oh fuck...”
John let go of him, and allowed him to crawl across the bed. He pulled out a box from John’s bed side table, and presented it to him.
Although I’m not sure anyone really has me figured out, John is definitely the front runner.
I quirk an eyebrow, but he’s still not looking.
"It's my job to worry about that, not yours. Go home."
“FUCK!” Sherlock screamed through gritted teeth.
Mrs Holmes and Mrs Watson were stood at the bottom of the stairs, looking up at the two youngest children with tear filled eyes. They shared a knowing look witch was only caught by John. He let go of Sherlock as soon as they got to the bottom of the stairs. She didn’t notice, as she soon became the objective of Mrs Hudson’s fussing. A moment later, Mycroft appeared at the stairs. She was dressed in a fishtail gown, her hair was up, and her makeup was immaculate.
Sherlock visibly relaxed, and exhaled a shaky breath.
“Oh come on, it’s funny. You’re not tied up anymore.” He said in defence.
“Well, I must say i’m impressed with the battery life of this thing.” John mused finally.
He doesn’t say anything. He doesn’t even look up.
“He’s doing just fine.”
“Good morning.” He says, a grin playing at his lips. “You’re up early.”
“You have?”
“I’m not laughing.” John said honestly as he looked down at the floor behind the bed and saw the key.
“Maybe. Try it.”
He blinks a few times, his mouth opening and closing a few times, kinda like a goldfish.
“No.” Sherlock said quickly, shaking his head. “I want to stay close to you.”
“Kicking Mycroft out and going to Greg’s.”
Sherlock heard johns voice crack, and it pulled at her heart strings.
The videos were cartoons of stick men like figures in black and white, with bad puns, and slapstick comedy. Sherlock found them rather amusing, although most of his laughter was caused by John, who giggled, yes giggled, at nearly every clip. After they’d watched all 11, they were both out of breath from laughing. They collapsed backwards on Sherlock’s bed, still giggling and wheezing. Sherlock turned to look at John, who had his eyes closed as he tried to catch his breath. He looked so wonderful when he was laughing. Sherlock wanted to be the one to make him laugh. John turned to face him, tears of joy brimming in his eyes.
When they got home, John went straight to the fridge, and Sherlock went into their room. He decided to curl up with a book as he waited for John to return. He read for a little while before he heard footsteps and the door close.
John comes home
She gave hugs to both boys, and eagerly invited them inside for tea, unknowingly adding to their caffeine intake.
“Aw, darling. Why don’t you ask Sherlock to meet you?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I want to. May I?”
John turned his head to see a broad soldier standing a few feet away.
“I don’t know, you could be any kind of annoying vegetable. Take your pick.”
“Yeah. There’s a little bit left, but ummm... ugh, we’ll have to get more later.” John grumbled as he threw his head back on the pillows, pulling a defeated Sherlock down with him.
“This is what she always does! Always gets herself in a state, and looks so pitiful you can’t tell her off! She gets away with everything!” John shouted, thumping his fist against a wall, then recoiling and wincing from the pain. Sherlock followed him out into a green, where his outburst would be less disruptive.
"Have my waffles heated up for when I get back."
“That’s a good boy.”
“Simplest explanation... I was horny.”
“Do you want me to have a check on him.” John says, nodding his head to me.
“I suppose he needs some time to get use to me.” John chuckled, but his voice was a little strained. “Is he like you with strangers?”
“Ok, just you four left. Mary, visitation room; Adler, cafeteria; Donovan, Kitchen, and Watson, I want you in the bubble in B dorm.”
“Ah, What did I say to you? Eyes forward.” John barked when Sherlock tried to turn around again.
The brunette shivered.
John was still asleep when she entered the living room, but he woke when she riffled through her back.
“I want you to make love to me John.”
She steered him towards a row of lingerie, some of which were modelled on male mannequins. He looked over his shoulder where he saw Irene, a half filled basket in hand, practically thrusting a lacy panty set into Molly’s arms.
I take his hand in mine, and press a kiss to his knuckles.
“Have you thought of any names?”
Sherlock smiled against John’s lips when they captured his in a kiss. His tongue darted out to lick the raspberry sauce from the corner of Sherlock’s mouth, making him moan.
John and Sherlock meet for the first time.
Harriet teased as she followed John through the house.
“Because I’ve been bad... I deserve to be hurt... bruised... let everyone know that I’m a naughty slut that needs to be put in his place...”
“Do you want some popcorn?” I ask, placing a kiss on Sherlock’s shoulder.
“Watson.”
“Oh god!” Sherlock groaned as he felt his orgasm approach.
I’m not as anxious this time, fully aware of the astounding reaction I got out of him last time.
Those were the lasts words she’d hear John say in person for quite some time.
John stroked Sherlock’s cheek softly, looking under his curls, and into his eyes.
After a moment, John managed to pull her skirt down, then made a start on her underwear.
“What’s that?”
How on Earth was she to get back up?
“You’re beautiful.” He said finally.
Sherlock was hysterical by this point, sobs racking his body.
“I’m so sorry.”
He kissed me.
John kisses her forehead, then pulled apart before anybody could notice them.
John visits Sherlock at 221b Baker Street.
“John I need you to fuck me! Fuck me with your big cock!” Sherlock howled, never breaking eye contact with John.
“Yes.” He smiled.
Lucy has developed her mother’s obsession for treats, and polished off a whole packet of bourbons last night. Needless to say, Mycroft was not impressed. It may or may not have been my fault... how was I supposed to know she could open tins?
John could tell she was deducing every single one of them as she stood there, her eyes flickering around.
When I pray.’
She talked to him for a little while before Harriet took over for a bit.
John felt his already hard cock getting harder as his brain conjured up images of the gorgeous brunette to go along with the erotic noises he was providing. John had a very real idea of what the events looked like, and had no problem coming up with his own fantasies.
Sherlock laughed.
His body grips mine like a vice, a warm, soft vice that clings to me.
“Ok. I got you.”
I quickly clean up the floor and myself before heading back out in to the corridor. I look down at my watch.
Sherlock groggily opened his eyes. John was leant against the door frame smirking at him, towel around his waist, his skin wet and glistening.
“Fuck...” I moan softly as I press him up against the wall.
8th of July 1917
“Alright, you can start... now...let’s see if I can make my kitten purr...”
He pressed a kiss to John’s lips, one that continued down to his neck, and his chest once Sherlock pulled his shirt off. He kissed all the way down to his waistband, sinking to his knees where he felt John’s clothed erection hit the underside of his throat. John was watching him with hooded eyes as he slithered down his toned body. Sherlock rested his hand on johns legs, hoping he couldn’t see how much his hands were shaking. He was still nervous, but the shaking was also from excitement. He gingerly slid Johns football shorts down his legs, and let them pool at his ankles. Without the outer layer, Johns hard cock was very prominent in his boxers. Sherlock felt a pulse of arousal in his abdomen and his groin as he looked at it. He’d felt Johns cock against his leg before, but he hadn’t really got a good look at it. By Sherlock’s measurements, he’d guess six and a half inches. He returned his gaze to john’s face. John hadn’t taken his eyes off the brunette, his mind swirling. Sherlock made sure to maintain eye contact as he reached for the waistband of John’s Calvin Klein’s. After a nod of permission, Sherlock pulled them down. Sherlock inhaled sharply as he stared at Johns cock. It was long, and thick, larger than his own. It was a slightly different shade to the rest of his skin, and almost red in some places, flushed with blood, angry and pulsing. He’d just begun to feel confident, but after coming face to face with it, Sherlock felt rather intimidated. How was he going to get it in his mouth.
Sherlock and John reunite.
I am really going to come off as an asshole, but it’ll be worth it for the minutes alone with Sherlock.
(See the end of the chapter for
I gesture to the door. He slips through with a grin on his face, and I follow close behind. I allow my eyes to drop down, scanning his form.
And yet, I may be forced to stand corrected when I feel John’s hand immediately reaching between our bodies and brushing up against my clothed erection.
He’s out in the garden at the moment, raking leaves off the ground.
When I pray,
All three of them turned towards the door when they heard two pairs of footsteps. A young girl with braided, blonde hair entered the room first, closely followed by a boy who bore a close resemblance to her, except from his startling, grey eyes.
“I’m so sorry about this, dr Whitehall. John, why don’t you take Sherlock home.”
He sighs then moves forwards again and presses a kiss to my forehead.
Her mother shot her a warning look before gesturing to the spot beside her on the sofa. She sat down next to her mother, her back so impossibly straight she didn’t quite look human, instead presenting more like a statue. Harriet seemed rather uncomfortable, her gaze shifting from her mother to the taller girl across from her. A moment later, Mrs Hudson showed up with a tray of tea and biscuits.
“Find everything ok?”
The whole room lingered with the aroma of the libidinous activities that had taken place. They should probably do something about that.
John could hear Sherlock mumbling the words 'colleague, promotion, and lipstick' over and over again as he wandered around the living room.
“I wonder how the Watsons are holding up. I saw Harriet downing something a little stronger than champagne.” Mycroft murmured.
“Sherlock!”
He places a hand on the unit, boxing me in.
P.S. I can do a flash back chapter where John and Sherlock have a discussion about their kinks, safety words, all that.
“I... I’m so sorry, John.” I wail pathetically, grabbing fistfuls of his shirt with my shaking hands.
“Sorry sir. Just having a little chat.”
John followed Sherlock into the kitchen, and slumped down in a chair, completely drained.
“The Cure? Sure.”
“Ah, John. And who’s this?” She asked, her eyes falling on the slim brunette. “Oh, this must be Sherlock.”
Sherlock felt a pressure building, blood roaring in his ears. Before he could process what was happening, the cord in his abdomen snapped, and his vision went white as he finished all over himself. John couldn’t help but marvel at how beautiful Sherlock was in this moment. So beautiful, and all his. He snapped back to reality when he heard Sherlock clear his throat.
Sherlock turned around at that, a smirk playing at his lips. He continued to sway his hips while he ran his hands down his sides.
“You want some more?” John asked, holding the spoon up to him.
“Oh- mmmnngh...”
Johns age: 20
“I say fuck yes.”
“I can put that in the kitchen for you.”
“Oh... so you are...”
“Yes, you should. And maybe you should get yourself a little cheerleading costume.”
Sherlock and John’s food fight takes a naughty turn on Valentine’s Day.
“Feeling any better this morning?” He murmured, gently tracing little circles on to Sherlock’s shoulder.
Oh, Christ. This kid.
I want more.
He leans in close, his breath warm against my ear.
“Oh...”
The expression Mycroft pulled next was one that appeared almost hopeful. Sherlock couldn’t quite put her finger on it. She didn’t pay any mind to it, and went back to watching Lucy. Mycroft left shortly after Lucy woke up to feed her. She also took the gooseberries with her to give to her mother.
“Maybe I aught to... fuck... gag you... mmmm...”
“God, Sherlock!”
“I’m worried about how little you pay attention in class.”
Her gaze was cold, and steely as she stared at her mother.
A soldier fights for his comrades.
Sherlock lay his head on Johns chest for a moment before starting to wriggle uncomfortably.
She giggled at this, probably more than she should have done. Sherlock would have preferred if she didn’t giggle at all, but even by normal people’s standards this was too much. He decided to silence her by asking the question he knew she was waiting for.
“And you’ll only tire me more once you’re here.” She sighed as she lent back in the chair. “But... you’re all worth it in the end.”
How British to complain about the weather?
“Yeah. He’s always like that.” Mike grinned, taking a sip of his drink.
31st of December/1st of January 1914
“What makes you say that?”
“Hey, Wait a second.” He says just before we walk through the doors.
“My interview is in like five minutes. Fun.”
As John thought about this, he realised that the bedroom was fast becoming his favourite place to ‘hang out’ with Sherlock.
“John, why do you insist on spending time with me?” Sherlock blurted out, his eyes narrowed. “Why do you want to talk to me?”
“You know... we never actually go on dates.” Sherlock blurted out of the blue.
“Oh, Mrs Holmes, how lovely to finally meet you.”
“Thank you for the biscuits. I’m sorry I couldn’t send you anything direct. Unless you’d like bullet shells, or a pack of cards.”
Mycroft cast an eye across the room to her daughter who’s head was in a hat box.
They quite often went to each other’s lectures if there were spare seats as their subjects occasionally overlapped.
“What have you been eating?”
“Ugh. Go on then.”
“Yes!”
Sherlock, like with every aspect of relevance, had studied up on what to expect. Over the last few days, he’d even been regulating when he ate on the days he went to see John, just in case events were to present themselves.
“Please... fuck me... John...” He panted as he watched the blond deliberately miss his throbbing erection, and move to lick his upper thighs.
“I love you too.”
I’ve been drifting in and out of consciousness throughout the night, but now I am most defiantly awake, certain parts of me more than others...
His hands on my hips feel like being wrapped in the most revitalising embrace in a warm blanket, his palpitating heart beating against not only his chest but mine too from where our bodies are pressed together.
Outside, away from those inside.
He kisses me once more before retreating out in to the corridor.
“I thought...” John started as he shuffled closer to Sherlock. “We could make a little change.”
The girl beamed at him before sitting down a few seats over.
I carefully place him in the bed, then press a gentle kiss to his forehead.
“I saw you.”
“Oh god, John! Yes! Your cock feels so good inside me!” He groaned, throwing his head back.
I can’t help but chuckle, and he does too after a moment. He looks particularly gorgeous when he laughs.
“Seriously, where the fuck are my clothes?!” He exclaimed as he rifled through his draws.
“This is going to be an interesting night.”
John looked up at him with dark eyes, his cheeks flushed with arousal. Sherlock’s whimpers were tearing down his walls of defence. He couldn’t resist Sherlock’s begging, he’d never been able to. He smirked as he covered Sherlock’s body with his, and pressed their lips together. It was sticky, and sweet, both of them tasting like whipped cream and chocolate.
After a few more precious minutes, I return Sherlock to his dorm with the solum reminder that I will actually have to write him a shot.
“You need to remember to clean that up.” John said eyeing the slender boy as he threw himself down on the sofa. He stuck his tongue out, and disappeared from sight. The blond went to the fridge, but faltered before opening the door.
“Thank you.”
“It is indeed.”
“Let me know if this hurts.”
“You may.”
“I just got word that he had a visitor down in max this morning. Now he’s gone.”
“Auuuh...” Sherlock lets out a strangled moan, suddenly digging his nails in to my shoulders.
Sherlock shivered. John grinned to himself, and moved back to his seat.
The Watsons receive a telegram
John blindly excepted the mug and took a cautious sip, knowing full well Sherlock’s lack of ability to make decent tea.
He looked over to the other two girls who seemed to be considering her suggestion.
John smiled to himself as he sank his teeth further in to Sherlock’s soft skin.
His breathing is harsh and laboured, and his heart his thrumming away so harshly I can feel it in my bones.
“Easy for you to say, your ass isn’t bleeding!”
“It has.”
“Shall I return the favour then?” He whispered.
He smirks as he reaches behind my head for my vest, which he balls up and gently pushes in to my mouth.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Light?”
Sherlock could hardly wait for school to be over. He ran over to John at the end of the day, practically clattering in to him.
“Are you Alright?”
“What is it then? Why are you all acting like this?”
It’s good knowing he’s not at home sewing duvets, or Papier-mâching his eyes shut again.
His expression evolved in to one of fear and alarm after a moment, so John chose to put his acerbic tone down to that.
It’s Friday I’m in love.’
“John is gonna have to do a lot more than make us dinner, that’s for sure.” Rosie grinned.
Sherlock grumbled some noises of complaint and pouted.
Sorry this took so long.
“Come on then.”
Sherlock watched John over the back of the sofa as he got their drinks. Johns warmly tanned skin was glistening with moisture, his hair was all spiked up, and his towel was slung low on his hips. Sherlock would jump up and demand that John fuck him again if he wasn’t so tired and sore. He grinned to himself, and snuggled further in to the towel.
“Ummm... no, not really.” She said after a quick glance around the room.
“Why didn’t you tell me?” I echo.
“Ah!” Sherlock gasped at the sudden vibration, his whole body jumping.
Freak. That’s what he was. Sherlock felt another sobbing fit coming on, but he held back his tears. “An asshole.”
She cut herself off when she spotted John propped up on the sofa, the opposite end to Sherlock.
John comes in after waiting a precautionary minute.
“Would you like to rent a film tonight?”
Sherlock sat up, and looked down in between his legs. When he looked back at John, his cheeks were flushed.
He grabs me by my shirt, dragging me down so I’m covering him on the bed.
“No, you’re quite right.”
“My companions are rather... boisterous.” I decide. “And I apologise for them.”
“So... what do you do for fun?” John asked, settling on the sofa.
When I run my mouth, though they are astounded, people tell me I’m weird, or that I’m a freak, but not John.
“Sherlock...”
John carried them through into the living room, and gently settled Sherlock on the sofa. He always dozed off straight after sex.
I couldn’t see what he was doing exactly last night, but I could definitely see his bed moving a little and his sheets being kicked about shortly after he went back to his cube.
“Congrats Watson.” Is a sentence John hears from quite a few people.
“Get your pants off.” John husked, slipping his hands down the back of Sherlock’s pyjama bottoms.
“I’m going to have you on your knees, fuck your face, and make you gag.”
“Is this a request for me to post you some?”
“What?” Sherlock asked, alarm plain on his face.
“Oh, Sorry.”
He was upset.
Sherlock age: 14
I inhale indignantly, and jump up to see what he’s doing with the box.
“Oh... what’s... what is... is everything ok?”
“Oh, are we getting a replay?” Irene chuckled.
“Oh, John, I think I might spontaneously orgasm right now.” He stated, deadpan.
“Hiya.”
“Yes.”
John looks almost embarrassed as he reaches over to pull out a small bottle of what I assume is lube and a small, foil packet from his trouser pocket.
It’s always been rushed, it’s always been quiet, secret moments hidden away in cupboards, in the bubble, pressed against the wall, on desks, under tables, but now, now we’re here.
He took another deep drag, his hands shaking as he brought his hand back down.
Oh fuck.
"Well?!"
Hope you enjoy!
John creased his eyebrows, but shrugged it off.
“Still ok?” John murmurs against my lips.
John arrived outside the house addressed 221b Baker Street. He hesitantly walked up to the door, and knocked. A woman opened the door. John tried his best to hide his confusion. She was too old to be sherlock’s mother,  possibly his grandmother. She had shoulder length brown hair, and kind, hazel eyes, laughter lines surrounding them.
Oh yeah, things are about to get a whole lot more saucy. 😏
“Yeah... just give me a minute... need to catch my breath... so I can return the favour.”
“How do you figure that? How do you know we’re not studying?”
I reach round in front of him, and place a firm hand on his throat.
I look down at the brown liquid.
John quickly explained the train fiasco while the brunette caught his breath.
He flashes me a coquettish grin.
John grinned.
He pulls my shirt up and dips his head before sucking on the taut skin over my stomach. “And at least you’ll know.”
Easy for you to say...
30th of May 1917
She followed John onto the dance floor once more. She placed one of her hands on his shoulder, and the other remained entangled with his. His previously free hand found its way to her hip. She silenced a gasp. The intro for the song changed into the melody, and the pair began to step in time to the piano. John kept eye contact with her as best he could, but looking down at his feet as he tried not to step on her. As the song slowed to an end, Sherlock rested her head on johns chest. She didn’t know how long it would be until she had another opportunity to show him such affection, so she took it with both hands. She couldn’t help the smile that spread to her face when she felt John rest his head on hers. For a moment, she blocked out the music, and all she could hear was his heart beating, loud and as fast as hers.
The brunette whimpered as he withdrew his fingers. He managed to force his eyes open, and let out a low groan when he saw the scene before him. John had his teeth clenched as he pushed the foreign object further within himself. Sherlock felt himself aching as he watched his boyfriend pleasuring himself. He had no idea where John was going with this, but he sat quietly with his hands gripping his thighs, biting at the inside of his cheek while he waited for his next instruction. John stilled after he grew accustomed to the strange, opposing feeling, and turned to look at Sherlock.
“Alright, open.”
Sherlock followed John over to the boys from johns school.
“Pants off.” I bark, gripping his hips firmly.
“Alright.”
“Shall we go back to mine then?” John asked, lip chewed between his teeth.
Sherlock is given devastating news.
“I know you will.”
“Wait here a minute.”
“Not yet.”
Maybe it was the alcohol, maybe it was the panties making him horny, but Sherlock threw caution to the wind, and acted on his next impulse.
“Yes, and my next words are even more so. Get your shirt off.”
Almost anyone, perhaps with the exception of Sherlock herself, would have been a better comfort to John.
“May I?”
“That’s nice.”
“You’re walking!” She exclaimed, ignoring her usual hatred of stating the obvious.
The closer Sherlock’s date gets, the more anxious I get that someone will try and fuck with him.
I don’t have a chance to knock, Sherlock already opening the door to allow me inside, a look of what can only be trepidation spread across his angular yet juvenile face.
“So you’ve befriended the freak, huh?”
“He’s been there for the past 20 minutes. You really aren’t observant are you?”
“Who’s this?” Mrs Watson asked, bending down to greet Sherlock.
“Not tights, stockings.”
“Yeah? Ok, yeah I think we should rectify that with cake. Soak up the alcohol.”
“He’s as skinny as a rake though.” John said to no one in particular.
He draws his lip in between his teeth, and grins.
“I love you too.”
John felt his emotions pin balling around in his head, dipping and circling like the craziest roller coaster he’d ever had the endeavour of riding.
“Are you going to behave?”
“Shall I use a vibrator to bring you to the edge, then turn it off, leaving you wet and hard?”
Enjoy you guys! Thank you for the lovely comments!
John grimaced at Sherlock’s bluntness, and shook his head, chuckling.
“Love cats, bah dah buh dah buh da bu dah buh.”
Sherlock moaned loudly round John’s cock, sending pleasurable waves along his length.
Sherlock mused.
I feel a yearning to touch him there growing inside me.
“Right, here we are. Dr Hooper?”
“Fuck- oh fuck- John...” Sherlock moaned, rolling his head from side to side as he felt himself getting closer.
Sherlock pulled the blanket tighter around himself indignantly.
“Where are you off to in such a hurry?”
“No problem, dear. I’ll bring up some hot chocolate in a minute.”
He trailed off as he leant in, and pressed their lips together in a sticky kiss. When he pulled back, he squirted a small amount of cream in the divot of Sherlock’s collarbone.
That’s when she saw him.
Sherlock ignored him, grabbed his shirt, and pulled him in for another kiss.
“Fuck...” John groaned as he stretched out, arching his back and neck. “Well that was... intense...”
John’s POV
“Face the wall, inmate.”
They settled on watching rupauls drag race, although Sherlock had little opinion on the choice of show.
I feel a sort of clenching, pulsating feeling in my lower abdomen.
John licked his lips.
“I think it would be more fun if I blindfolded you. Well, more fun for me.” John chuckled mirthlessly.
Sorry this took ages, I don’t have much time to write at the moment, but I have by no means abandoned this story. Enjoy!
God, I want him so bad.
Quite.
The brunette stuck is tongue out at her, and turned to fling his arms around johns neck.
“Sup gays!”
"Yes. Good idea John. I'll tell my mum when she gets home."
John paused for a moment to allow Sherlock to relax. He nodded for John to continue after a moment, his shoulders dropping. He mewled when John slipped another finger inside his passage, the ring of muscles tensing around his digits.
John moved his head down, and attached his lips to Sherlock’s shoulder, where he began sucking at the skin.
Sorry this took so long, I wanted to write it as one piece. Hope you enjoy!
“Mycroft.”
“Where are we?”
“Umm... I... I’m not sure how I...”
“Do you think John will?”
*****
“Yes, yes fine.”
“I want you to get yourself off on my cock.”
“Thanks. So, how are you?”
John’s POV
Without a warning, John felt the cord in his abdomen break, and with a cry of her name, he reached his climax.
“I won’t get you in trouble.” She says after a moment, taking another sip of her tea.
“I only sat down to help her with this puzzle. I can no longer feel my legs.”
“Give is a moment.”
John comforts Sherlock whilst he goes through withdrawal.
“Why?”
“Mmmm?”
“Never again.” He mumbled as he swallowed the tablet.
Sherlock realised too late that this was the wrong thing to say. They pushed him from behind, and sent sprawling out on the cold gravel.
Sherlock felt butterflies flapping around in her chest. She could talk to John. She looked up at the young woman who was still awaiting her answer. She looked so much like John. Sherlock would give anything to see him again, but for now, hearing him would have to do.
“He’s not my chap.”
“That’s a nasty bruise.”
I beams down at me, and presses a kiss to my lips.
“Of course.” I say, although I’m not entirely sure it is.
“Hello darling. I think I’ve managed to tame your father. It’s quite alright for you to come home.”
Sherlock lifted his head, and rested his chin on John’s chest.
Hope you enjoy!
Sherlock screwed up her eyebrows, and walked down a few more steps in hope of hearing a little more.
Mrs Holmes had blonde hair that was pinned up in a bun, and the same bright blue eyes as Sherlock, which were staring up at her in annoyance.
“No. No thank you.”
"Good morning, mummy."
“I want to see you lose control.”
Sherlock moved his hand to rest on johns knee. John inhale deeply, but showed no other reaction.
“Why does it look like a hurricane has struck your room?”
“Tired, but yes. How are you finding the floor?”
“Alright, I’m going out. Please keep the sex confined to your bedroom. Not that I care, but Molly and Rosie might throw you out if they find anymore of Sherlock’s underpants under sofa cushions.”
“About what happened after.” He said, not looking up. “Look, Sherlock, I meant it when I said I wasn’t gay.”
“You can take your coat off too, you know.”
“Christ!” She exclaimed as her mother and Mycroft burst in to the room.
I quickly place my mouth around his cock to catch his release as he finishes with a breathy sob.
“Mmmm...” Sherlock groaned with a roll of his head.
“Sorry darling. Please come and eat something.”
This is kinda shit, I won’t deny it 😆. I rushed through it, cos I wanna get to the good stuff.
“You should have said yes. That way if we got in trouble, I could throw you under the bus, or get him to do both of our homework. Next time, think things through.”
“Wish it was-ngggghh... ah... your cock hitting my- ah!- prostate- gah!” Sherlock howled as he rode his fingers.
I’m not sure how much time passes when he wakes rather abruptly.
“No, no.” He says quickly, his voice raspy and chocked up. “I don’t... I don’t know why I’m crying.”
“Yes I am. She talks about you all the time.”
Sherlock lets out a squeal as I bite at his neck whilst I scrabble about for the cuffs.
“I assume you’re here to put yourself through medical school.”
“Yes.” Sherlock stated enthusiastically.
19th of October 1918
He still kept quiet, and the impatient teenager was getting annoyed.
“Really?” Sherlock asked, her curiosity getting the better of her.
Mike looks up from his soup.
I want to be more a part of him than I am myself.
“Mmmnngh!” Sherlock groaned, tucking his head in towards his chest.
Mrs Holmes returned a few minutes later with two mugs of hot chocolate.
Sherlock scrunched his eyebrows, an amusing sight from John’s vantage point.
“You don’t look fine. You need to go to medical.”
There was a swing set at the end of the garden, a sword, a model train, and two pairs of wellington boots outside the shed.
This a short chapter, but I hope you enjoy! Thank you so much for the lovely comments, they make me happy :)
“Watson, mail for you.”
“I’m going to miss you.” He said after a moment.
“What?”
“Yes...” he says almost wondering.
He wanted this. He wanted John.
“Where’s your sister?” Anne asked, taking a seat opposite Kate.
“You ready?”
I look up from my book to raise my eyebrows at him.
John age: 17
“Oh that’s sweet. We’ll have to arrange to see them some time. Sherlock, pass me the coffee please darling.”
“Yeah?” He asks with a smirk.
John furrowed his brows, but went to the phone regardless.
“Yes, thank you.”
“I’m gonna go talk to some people. I’ll catch you guys later?”
“I was thinking maybe a sport.”
“Shhh you.”
He smiles.
Mrs Hudson raised an eyebrow at him.
He presses a parting kiss to my lips, then I depart back to bed, my cock throbbing between my legs.
“I like the kitten ears.” He giggled softly, indicating with his index finger to a bright red, lacy pair of kitten ears.
I wait alone in the cupboard for an appropriate amount of time before exiting in to the hall.
Alright, stick to the play.
“I... umm...” John looked away, and down at the floor. “I have a boner.”
He faked interest as she babbled on about baking with her grandmother, making noises of agreement, and nodding his head where appropriate. After they finished their experiment, they sat waiting for everyone else to finish.
Epilogue
“All cleaned up?” He asks after I finally throw away the wipe that was responsible for cleaning my hands.
“I’m here.”
“Joooohhhnn....” Sherlock groaned, dropping his head against the door.
Sherlock smiled back.
“So, What do you want to be when you grow up?”
Sherlock felt his briefs dampen and his insides quiver at the sound of johns voice.
Hope you guys enjoy! Thanks for the comments xxx
Sherlock held out a packet of toffees she’d bought in the gift shop to john. She’d bought it with money from her parents. Nothing they ever bought her was what she wanted, so they’d given up a few years back. John was the only person who really knew what she was interested in. Not only that, but he brought himself to have an interest too. Sherlock hadn’t noticed, but she’d been staring at him for a good few minutes now.
