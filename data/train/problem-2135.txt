Sherlock approached his grave, a strange feeling to be sure even for him, pulling his collor up against the chill, both real and imagined it was one of those nights when you can feel that the cold had decided its time to take root. In the distance Sherlock could make out the form of what he knew to be John Watson, sitting on the cold ground, bottle in one hand, L9A1 in the other, head resting on Sherlock's glossy black headstone. John didn't hear Sherlocks approach, the wind was just high enough to cover his steps, so he was able to come within a couple of paces of Johns out stretched feet, he crouched down.
Mercy who never allowed herself to be pushed gestured for Harbinger to do just that, who was more then happy to oblige.
This was pointless. Sherlock knew he would never be good at the words so he decided to abandon the idea altogether. Perhaps it would just have to happen naturally as they say.
"Yessss." The word was a hiss of steam on John's skin and it urged him deeper and earned him more of the same. "God yesssss John."
John smiled satisfied that Mercy seemed to realize that to John this was worth all the danger it could bring. “ Thank you Mercy.”
John watched the revanet speak, trying to make sense of all that was happening, but it was difficult to comprehend. All John had wanted from the second Sherlock had crashed into to the unyielding pavement was to have him back if only for one more breath. Many nights in the small hours of the morning John had cried to himself overwhelmed by ghost of things that never where. The tender ways they would have came to know each other, the sweet way they would have melted into each other under the cover of darkness. John would never dream of hurting Sherlock, not really, in fact he would move heaven and earth to shield him from all pain. But in this moment, with Johns whole world folding in on itself, he wanted to crush the object of his affection. Without a word, John stood and began his customary walk back to Baker St. with a silent Sherlock in tow. Sherlock hardly dare breathe, he walked lightly a half step behind John, utterly terrified of whatever was to come.
“Yes, well let it never be said that I’m incapable of handling a rough ride.” Sherlock cast a sidelong glance searching for reaction.
“Oh dear God! Dose anyone else feel like we’re right back at the beginning of this story! Sherlock it’s been years, you said so yourself, if there was ever anything to forgive in John’s eyes he’s past it now.”
“No nothing like that. We’re having a bit of a Christmas do down at the Yard, and I know that’s not your thing and all, but you ought to come out.” Just as Lestrade stopped talking a light slapping nose began, like flesh on flesh. Sherlock looked around in wide eyed shock as John smiled near to bursting shimming his hips side to side making his tally wack on his thighs, Sherlock quickly smacked his palm in a matching rhythm on the door frame in time with John to mask the sound, Lestrade tried one last time to push forward, Sherlock pushed back. John stopped his dance and made a face when he slouched a bit of tea on his delicates.
Sherlock walked to Ruskin Park alone after texting Irene but warning her to stay away so as not to tanit the data. She agreed but not without a fight. Or a plan.
Sherlock did as he was told. “John.” He reached to touch John’s face only to have his hand stopped in a firm grip.
Sherlock closes his eyes, lost in the sensual moment. He crosses his nude legs behind John’s sturdy back and vaguely thinks that maybe this time John would be more than willing to name the baby after him.
“You keep contact with my brother?” Sherlock wrinkles his nose in aversion, examines hard that tiny piece of paper, searching for some trace of Mycroft’s evil criminal scheme.
John tugs Sherlock’s neck to pull him down and kisses him deeply, “I love you,” one more kiss, “I love you,” another, “I love you,” more kisses, “If I haven’t said it enough before, I will say it to you everyday in the rest of my life. Our lives.”
Unfortunately, he turns around to find Mary perching on the chair’s armrest, and John’s also got a couple of bright red lip prints on the face. It looks like he is very much in need of one of those serviettes, too.
“Terrific,” the rustling noises of John’s are coming closer along the flower shelf, “they’ll look so nice on
Actually, if given right timing, he’d very much be inclined to have a nice and nerve-appeasing bath. John takes off his clothes, opens the shower nozzle and walks under the warm string of water. Only now…he definitely doesn’t want to leave Sherlock alone in bed for too long.
Sherlock almost loses his balance in the middle of all the flower buckets and can see stars in his head.
“Hmm, no, I don’t think so,” John murmurs, “please forgive me to have let you know until so late. God knows how much willpower it took me to hold back and not telling you, Sherlock. But we can’t risk it to let Mary perceive anything… She is dangerous, so we have to pretend that my and her wedding is being busily prepared, and give her the false prospect where I will marry her happily and foolishly, as planned.”
At this moment, they are standing side by side in the living room of 221B, the tea table and the two arm chairs have been pushed to the wall. Both of men are outstretching their own right arm in front of themselves in a semicircle curve, and holding up their left hand on the side – doing exact same posture of leading.
“Plus, don’t worry about those criminals,” John goes on, purposely squeezing his robust biceps, “You have me, who has not been trained for nothing.”
“Smith?” John is amazed and totally diverged, “The one in the bus stop posters? That actor? You do know that he is the voice of Dobby the House-elf?”
She accompanied John to Sherlock’s tomb. Being afraid of letting the truth slip out or that John gets too sad, she cried and told him how mad and crazy Sherlock used to drive her. She kept complaining about those nerve-wracking defects and misdeeds of Sherlock’s, which were mostly true. She did not know what exactly made her tears drop, obviously it’s not because Sherlock’s dead; however, amongst all her faking-tears experience for various reasons, this time is the closest one to true tears.
, Mrs Hudson heard that. She wiped her tears, and one more step to go before getting one hundred percent done—she only had to open the boot. Once John saw Sherlock with his own eyes (plus, in a very sexy car she knew John would long for), there would be no way that John could ever say no.
Surely it was a lot harder for John. He did not speak much, either. In fact, he had barely talked in days. He sat in front of the fireplace, bare-foot, silent, immobile, refusing to eat. Mrs Hudson had wanted to talk to him, but she did not know where to start. She wanted to comfort him, but every attempt seemed so vacant and pointless. Now she’s quite a little angry about Sherlock, who had gone on his own and left this tough task to her. Of course, Sherlock did all this for a reason, a reason he did not explain in detail to her—
John pinches the bridge of his nose. “Sherlock, I think we should dance like a pair of people who dance, instead of dancing like two dancing-major students who are practicing in front of their classroom mirror.” He points at the mirror above the mantle, in which their images do look silly.
She did not anticipate the bunch of American agents coming at her door because of that evil woman’s phone. Mrs Hudson knew for sure that it was Sherlock they are coming after, it was not some substantial threat to her. However it really hurted when that big-guy-in-charge’s ring had scraped her face. She whimpered and trembled, repeating
It turns out that Mary Morstan has always been working for Jim Moriarty. Professional assassin. Sanguinary crime histories. Fake nationality, fake accent, fake hair colour. Even the name Mary Morstan is a fake.
Sherlock rests quietly in John’s arms, every detail of these months of wedding planning he and John had been doing together plays back like a movie in his mind.
He’s now in his own bedroom, and Mrs. Hudson is in the living room, speaking to John in a whispering voice. They may think he’s asleep but every word comes clearly into his ears.
“What did you do for a living when you were younger, a gymnastics athlete?” The doctor said curiously, “You have a good rest over there, I will make the tea, as long as you tell me where to find the tea-leaves and cups.” And he picked up his walking stick and limped into the kitchen.
“John…I know this is not my place to say, but—” She sounds hesitant and unsettled, “Look, I personally do not hold any biased judgment to Mary, but…now that
During all these years he and John have known each other, there were million times people took them for a couple, yet this is the first time Sherlock has ever heard people saying that John is his “fiancé”.
So it is a bright and lovely day in the spring and it’s on a suburban street, she leaned up against her red shiny car roof and faked crying. She knew it, from the moment she stepped out of the car, John’s eyes never left that charming baby. Even before she started talking, John’s appetite is fully open. He just can’t resist this kind of dramatic stimulus: hovering helicopter, racing cars, and flaunting in front of a police officer.
Sherlock meticulously buttons his last button and walks out of his cubicle. John’s already done, and waiting for him in front of the mirror on the floor. He’s standing there, his side to Sherlock, and dealing with his cuff.
“Erm, no idea. First time getting married, myself, remember?” John’s voice comes from the other side of one big shelf of flowers, “Anyway, I prefer some more fresh ones.”
“Precisely,” Sherlock does not like his interrupt and purses his mouth, “She looks smart and sophisticated in that dream, the type you would like—let me finish,” he anticipates John’s prepared refute and hastily adds, “and she finds me tolerable, does not see me as a rude arsehole or something like that. And she encourages us to go out and back on cases again.”
One night she was waken up by a twinge in her hips, and heard a vague noise upstairs. Was it Sherlock? Had he already solved the problems and came back? She moved upstairs on her tiptoes. It was all dark on the second floor, and the door to Sherlock’s bedroom was half open, from where came the light noises. She went across the corridor and stopped at the door. In the pale moonlight, she saw John sitting on the floor by the end of the bed, his head burying in his knees, quivering soundlessly. He was clearly crying. Mrs Hudson could not see his face, but she would never mistaken that it was Sherlock’s navy blue dressing gown John’s grabbing.
Ever since John starts planning the wedding, he stops going on cases with Sherlock; what’s even worse is that he happily makes Sherlock plan it with him—so much so that Sherlock himself has no time for cases at all—as if Sherlock should be as involved in the wedding as John is.
His silhouette is absolutely stunning, Sherlock thinks to himself. The shadows of his eyelashes are like melted gold; the shape of the tip of his nose is like the Jungfrau in a sunny summer day. They’ve just picked the matching dark coloured tuxedos and grey suit pants, along with white shirts, golden-brown waistcoats and light champagne knitted ties. They’ve even got bowlers hats in matching colour with the suit pants. It seems that Mycroft has informed the owner of the store about their specific sizes, so that the suits are perfectly fit now.
“I will call Mycroft to arrange for Miss Morstan a new internship opportunity at some other hospital.”
She’d never dreamt that in the boys’ point of view, Mrs Hudson is where Home is. Without her, England would fall.
“Your brother recommended this to us,” John hands him a business card, “says it’s got a hundred years’ history and exquisite craftsmanship in making dress suits.”
“You’ve been losing weight. That aerobic course suits you.” Says Sherlock amicably. John, on the other hand, is sitting in his own chair, burying his face in his phone.
John turns back to look at him. Sherlock has turned in bed, his black curls are all over the pillow. It seems that he has sunk into deep sleep again.
However, John pauses, and seems having made some big decision. Then his hand comes to the back of Sherlock’s neck and gently pulls him back to his shoulder.
“Th—this is not funny, John,” franticly shaking his head, he steps backward involuntarily and hits his back on the shelf, “this joke is not funny at all--”
“In right here,” Sherlock takes his hand, moves slowly toward a place lower than his heart and between two ribs, “That really hurts. Hurts like hell, John. I guess that’s when I fell down from the bed.”
“What? Oh…Erm, right, sure. First step forward with your left foot, then right foot sideways to the right.”
Sherlock sits across from John, staring down at nine different pieces of cakes on the plates in front of them.
“Oh, Sherlock, this is not a joke, definitely not a joke,” John’s other knee also touches ground and he eagerly kneels his way to Sherlock, “I swear, I’ve got a ring! Now thinking about it, it may not be a good idea to have put the ring in my inside pocket while both my hands are occupied with such a big bouquet. Sherlock, could you please hold this for me a little--?”
The young woman curled up in the hard wooden chair of the interrogation room, with her tiny and slim figure trembling from head to toe. She buried her face deep in her hands and wept, tears coming down through fingers. Her delicate and lovingly pathetic form would made anyone’s heart ache for her.
When he gets to the door to the loo, he hears a low sigh from Sherlock. Several syllables come dismally from the pillow.
“But Sherlock is back and alive!” Mrs. Hudson emphasizes with an incredulous tone, and forgets about being whispery and subtle.
Maybe it is time to renew this wonderful tradition again, this weekend would be perfect. Thoughts hovering in head, John pulls close a towel to dry his hair and body, and brushes teeth and finishes shaving against the vapoury mirror.
The living room with two French windows was very spacious and bright, and the kitchen was well equipped and furnished. Doctor Watson was quite glad about the house, not to Mrs Hudson’s surprise. The only problem was that Sherlock had moved all his stuff in here earlier that day, making the rooms so untidy. Mrs Hudson had complained about it but Sherlock never listened to a word about it. And now Doctor Watson just questioned it a bit and Sherlock got so nervous that he fumbled to pile up some books from the floor and stammered something about he can straighten things up a bit.
“John,” Mary starts furiously, dropping her handbag onto the sofa, “this tailor’s shop you’ve decided to patronize is among the most expensive ones in London, if I’m not mistaken?” she squints at the furnishings in the fitting room, “well this place looks passable to me, how come the staff here can’t even reach the standard as simple as respecting their client?”
Sherlock sighs. Even if the ravishment of getting married tends to lower one’s IQ, John shouldn’t be this slow.
“No, Sweetie, not into battle, just going to have a shower. Wait for me to come back.” He grins and enters the loo.
John went into the doctor’s mode instantly. He turned around and put Mrs Hudson into the chair, and asked thoroughly about the spot and type and history of the pain. She told him that it resulted from some youth-time work practice and had never been cured.
Some days earlier, her husband had a conflict and an intense firefight with another local drug gang. Three men were killed at Frank’s gunpoint. Frank came home with their(and maybe his own) blood all over the body, picked up some baggage and went in hiding. Then today, Martha was taken to the police station and was told Frank’s arrest. Of course, she knew everything from beginning to end, only to the ignorance of Frank himself.
She could not stand this. On this matter, nobody in the world is more responsible for doing something, more capable of doing something, and more qualified to do something than her,
Sherlock inhales deeply and begins: “I dreamed that when I came back, you’ve been engaged, John, to Mary Morstan—”
“—You live together in a house in the suburbs, a perfect and annoying bourgeois house. And you are getting married,” Sherlock continues stubbornly, fingers gently fondles back and forth on John’s wrist, “You ask me to be your bestman. You say I am your best friend.”
“I love you too.” Sherlock echos in a low voice. The corners of his mouth curl upward into a joyful and trusting smile under John’s lips, tears still in eyes.
John presses his chest to Sherlock’s to warm him up, one arm holding his shoulder and the other never stops stroking softly his back. Once there was the most smooth and gorgeous human skin John had ever had the good fortune of seeing—if John being honest enough, he’d thought so since in Buckingham Palace—But now, many atrocious scars have entrenched there. At this very moment John can’t see them, but he can feel them. From the very first time John saw them, those shocking colours and shapes had left permanent marks on his retina, and carved John’s heart by the exact same track and depth.
“Sorry,” John breathes heavily, trying to catch back his sanity, “I got distracted. Please go on, tell me what happens next. Although that might not be something pleasant.”
The door to the living room is unlatched when John arrives at the landing and pushes it open. The lamp on the floor casts a warm orange halo to the room, lighting up some dark-coloured fuzzy thing spreading on the sofa arm.
She declines their invitation to go to the cake place in excuse of tooth-aching. When Sherlock goes to the side pavement to hail a taxi, John hugs her covertly, before giving her a look that could only be interpreted as gratitude.
John finds himself gazing at Sherlock’s tranquil sleep, until the latter wriggles and breathes out, and one blurred drool slips out.
Sherlock’s still rosy face tightens a bit: “I wrote a song for your wedding. Caught a murderer on the reception dinner. Deduced Mary’s pregnancy before the dancing starts.”
I had him bring me to the Blue Parrot and when I walked in Ferrari was behind the counter with Umar. He called, “George! You’re just in time,” and pointed to the table where the backgammon board was set up. “We can finish the match, and I want to talk to you.”
The next day, I slipped through a door in one of the hotel’s service corridors and blended in with the departing crowd in the Santa Apolania train station. In front of the station, I caught a taxi to the airport and there boarded an Aero Portuguesa Lodestar, making stops in Tangiers, Rabat, and Casablanca.
“Apparently it’s me who’s responsible for her death. You—you said that you’d rather talk to anyone but me. You just...left.”
The last thing Sherlock remembers before he falls into a deep slumber is that they lie together on the carpet in front of the fireplace, his left hand in John’s right hand. John’s fingers are drawing most strange circles around his finger.
John’s thumb circles around on that small piece of skin. He bends and replaces his thumb with lips. He kisses that point reverently, with so much care and fondness. “There is no bullet hole in here, look, not a wound at all,” he covers Sherlock’s heart with one palm, “nothing but a most beautiful heart. I will never let anyone hurt you again, Sherlock, never let anyone steal your heart from me, either.”
Sherlock mumbles at the disturbance, but shows no sign of waking up. His lips are slightly open, his eyebrows are relaxing, his long eyelashes are mildly shuddering, projecting bouncy shadows on his high cheekbones. That very much attenuates his usual sharp angles and arrogant touch. He looks so young and so pure now. John watches him, feeling incredibly protective: the sleeping Sherlock Holmes almost looks like a kid who gets to eat his favourite candy in his dream—is it John’s illusion or the trick of the lamp halo, or is it real that a shade of elusive smile just floats on Sherlock’s face?
John has just told Sherlock about how Mary had come back from her girls’ meet early and how she dropped by the dress shop. But it turned out that shop assistant guy Adam (according to John, his name is Eddie) had recognized her as some housemaid of John and Sherlock’s. After Mary had denied that with domineering arrogance, Eddie had ceaselessly apologized about being so tactless to not having recognized Dr. Watson’s mother.
But John lets go of him quickly enough, he blinks hard and averts his eyes to the floor. He covers his mouth with one hand and clears his throat. “I’m sorry. Excuse me for a moment. Be right back.” And he marches his way towards the direction of the gents.
He doesn’t speak for a long moment, just enjoying John’s caress. John thinks he’s falling asleep again, when he starts all of a sudden.
“Really? I thought Swan would seem a little bit more elegant; needless to say its obvious symbolic significance—”
--For the sake and consideration of all of you, especially John’s. He cannot know, especially him, please, Mrs Hudson. I will be back as soon as the things are settled, and then everyone of us would be very happy again.
Though she is very certain all is real, because her tears have never been so straight form heart in her life.
“But, but—” Sherlock’s eyes searches around the dim bedroom but have nowhere to focus, “I’ve killed your wife, you...you said you didn’t want to see me anymore—”
“Oh Sherlock... Of course you are. You are my best friend, and the best and wisest man I’ve ever known.” John tells him affirmatively, finding his fingers and laces their ten fingers together, “I’m sorry I treated you like that in your dream. How did you respond?”
“I’ve been expecting this day ever since six years and three hundred and sixty-four days ago. Don’t you dare not be happily together forever.”
John’s hand lifts from holding his waist to holding his cheek, his thumb fondling along Sherlock’s jaw line. During a very short, crazy second, Sherlock would almost believe John is going to kiss him.
“She’s got aerobic classes today, said she has to lose 10 pounds before the wedding,” John waves his hand, drags a chair to seat himself close to Sherlock and pats Sherlock’s bony shoulder, “unlike you, you don’t have one pound to lose, you skinny genius.” And he giggles aloud as if he’s said something really humorous.
“Come on, Sherlock,” John snaps shut Sherlock’s laptop abruptly to stop him from checking the email inbox, almost catching Sherlock’s fingers between the lid and the keyboard, “we don’t have time to solve cases at the moment, there are lots of work to do,” he’s counting numbers joyfully with his own fingers, “the venue, the band, the dish menu, the outfits, the guest lists…”
Sherlock wiggles his shoulder a little uncomfortably, reaches for a pile of writing papers across the desk and scrutinizes the invitation lists drafted by John.
In a heartbeat, John’s looks are becoming as irresistible as those when in the fitting room. Without noticing it himself, Sherlock opens his mouth and swallows down the cake from the spoon.
John, on the other side, behaves just like every decent husband who comforts his angry wife would do. He puts one arm along Mary’s shoulder and coos soothingly: “Apparently they only do nice clothes, golden words aren’t their specialty. I’m sure this young man means no harm.”
“Your words put me into a bottomless of abysm,” Sherlock continues in spite of John’s protest, “I took cases one after another restlessly. I used drugs, punched walls, I’ve got double kidney failure and hallucinations. But I want to see you, John, I want you back. So I went to Culverton Smith.”
Sherlock blinks, sorrow and doubt fleet in his eyes. “Silly, that dream. Would you laugh at me, John?”
“Come here, closer,” John gestures him, “I know some basic movements, what I need is to do them more naturally. Just…dance
Mrs Hudson is much more reassured now. Things are still not what they should be, but they are finally on the right direction, at least.
There is a whole bunch of alcohol. A lot, a lot of giggling. Tea is hot, flames in the fireplace are warm, John’s palm on his knee is like boiling.
Mrs Hudson had nodded heavy-heartedly, she had not asked more questions. So she did not know much about Sherlock’s plan. Sherlock also agreed that the less she knew, the better. But of course Sherlock should know how desperate this would make John, and in what a difficult position would that put her, shouldn’t he?
“I need five exit visas with today’s stamp on them, made out in these names,” I said, taking out the the Emergency Certificates, and pushed them across his great desk.
And, in the end, I couldn’t bring myself to waste the fuel and hot water. Within the hour, I was bathed, shaved— No, that was not a small sacrifice! —dressed, and bundled into a ministry car.
The young man would have none of it, and he and the Maître d’ proceeded to argue the point in a language with which I wasn’t familiar. I was sorry when the waiter came to tell me that my table was ready.
I made a note that I would exact revenge for the way he dragged out the last word; I had a belt of Indian elephant leather and, once the weather broke, he was for it.
The next day, I took a taxi to the American Consulate. The crowd in front of it was as large as it had ever been, and I told the driver to wait. As before, I was admitted to the Consul General’s office.
None of it was reassuring but, after thinking it over, I knew that despite his remark about being abandoned in a trench holding a grenade, I had no real fear that Ferrari would fail or sabotage my arrangements for getting the lads out of the country. He had been a competent officer—physically brave and, from what I could remember, no more than moderately corrupt—and hadn’t had a rep, as some did, for taking advantage of his young lads, or wasting them to look flash to his superiors. Whatever happened to him after the war had to have been plain hard luck.
It is for occasions like this that you let the pig think he’s found a truffle. When Ugarte asked me a similar question, he was scrambling in desperation for any hold he could get. Renault asked it as a calculated move.
Seeing that I was about to depart, the Officer in Charge challenged me to show my papers. When I produced the blue passport with the American eagle, he saluted and stood aside.
“Was it published?” said I. “I had no idea. I’ve had so little time for reading this past year…what with…er…working, you know?”
“That’s not necessarily to my credit. All I want is a quiet life and I would have it but, unfortunately, I retain one or two fond memories of Merrie Olde England. Think of it as an indulgence I allow myself, like that damn bird, but don’t ever make the mistake of imagining I’d go out of my way or put my business at risk for you.”
While we were chatting, the cockney brute was removed by his friends, who were urged on by Ferrari’s huge bouncer, wielding a fly swatter.
“Of course.” It was impossible to forget the evacuation. The press called it a brilliant tactical retreat, if he wants to; I called it a damned debacle. So many young men left behind.
“Why do you bother?” said Holmes. “No amount of fiddling is going to enhance the bottom line by as much as a penny.”
“Still damned decent of you,” I said. “You know, I think you may be the only person in Casablanca who hasn’t tried to work an angle on me…
Still looking doubtful, Ellerman went to his desk, sat down and picked up his pen. “What is his name?”
At that time, Lisbon was the last open capital of Europe and, as a result it was a primary goal for refugees, and a hot bed of spies. Holmes and I were driven to the Avenida Palace Hotel and were not permitted to leave for three days.
“Well, we must be certain that it isn’t your last. You will not be bothered in the Blue Parrot. If you are, let me know and it will be taken care of. Your drink is on the house. As is yours Ugarte. This once.”
That this was even a question, in November of 1941 may surprise my readers. Maybe they don’t know, or have forgotten, how in July of 1940, just days before the Vichy government was officially established, Churchill ordered the Royal Navy to sink the French fleet at Mers-el-Kébir.
“Enough!” I said, throwing my pen down, and swiveling my chair about to face him.  “I am entirely aware of where the fault lies, nonetheless, if you could see your way to loaning me a small sum…?”
I stood gulping like a trout in front of his secretary, but as soon as the secretary closed the door, Ellerman took pity on me. He came and took me by the arm and guided me to a chair.
Once we were out on the street, the soldiers said they would escort me to my hotel, to make sure I got there. They attempted to argue when Ugarte told them to go home; he would see me safe. Eventually I told they would attract too much attention and would have to go.
“Because the Japanese are committed to expanding their sphere of influence in Southeast Asia. Europe isn’t the only continent presently at war, you know, and my company is committed to finding markets closer at hand. Fresher spices, better prices.”
As I said, I suspected that I was being followed that first night. Before the week was out, I was certain of it. I didn’t know by whom, of course, but assumed it was the Sûreté. I’ve always thought that if someone is rooting about in your affairs like a pig, it’s well to let them find a truffle or two. I began taking my tea at the Blue Parrot. I learned the macaw, Blue Peter, was a nasty old bird and fell into the habit of playing backgammon with Signor Ferrari.
—only two blocks away but, if it was exotic entertainment—something different, if I knew what he meant (I knew) there was the Blue Parrot on the
Holmes chuckled, as I had intended he should, and turned the window to face me. He looked absurdly young with the curls tumbling over his brow.
“Oh, no,” I said, applying my fundament to the seat of the basket chair. “Weren’t we planning a holiday in Cornwall.”
Two of them began to tell me they were members of the British Expeditionary Force and produced green and red identity tags to prove their
I said that I understood but hoped, should I secure any large orders for the Windward Spice Company, that I would be able to use the consulate’s teletype. As I said this, I took an envelope from my breast pocket, removed the letter inside and pushed it across the desk. One of Mrs. ‘Arris’s nephews and given it to me for Mr. Goold.
Personally, I welcomed the break, but after a week’s rest Holmes began to take the lack of felonious enterprise as a personal affront. Mental stagnation was anathema to his nature; he was not a patient man at the best of times and, with no case to occupy him, a petulant streak in his nature emerged that had the effect of making him a very trying companion, indeed. The morning to which I refer, the mercury had already topped ninety.
“There is none. The lads have been making a bloody nuisance of themselves; I don’t want Renault poking his nose in here.”
Much as I appreciated the invitation, I declined. I did say that if Carl happened to see Captain Renault and mentioned that I was in the bar I would appreciate it. I slipped him the bill between my fingers. Carl said, Of course, just let him know when I was ready for my table.
I handed Goold’s card to the secretary who admitted me, giving my name as George Armistead. The secretary showed me to a comfortable waiting room and left me there. Although, he was gone a considerable time, the office had an excellent view of the harbor; I was able to observe the fishing boats unloading at the docks below and count how many ships stood at anchor outside the ancient breakwater. They were awaiting a birth assignment or else permission to sail.
“Not at all.” He gave me a rueful look. “But I assure you that there is more than enough in this mission to keep my mind fully occupied.”
“And I would like Hedy Lamar’s phone number.” Renault picked up the certificates, glanced at them, and tossed them down. “I’m afraid we are both out of luck.”
In Casablanca, the sun glares from the plain white walls that demark the villas that line the wide streets. I could see lush gardens inside the gates. I took in the Moorish Revival architecture of the public buildings and cinemas, all showing French films. There were a multitude of charming outdoor cafés. The image of Marshal Pétain was everywhere.
London in August can feel as sultry as Bombay. I recall the summer of 1894, particularly, when Baker Street was ripe with the inevitable byproduct of horse drawn vehicles, and tar oozed between the wooden paving blocks in the street.
From Marseilles they managed to get a ship to Oran and, eventually, but arrived in Casablanca only to find the British consulate closed. They could have tried the American consulate but would have been easy target for the Sûreté who made it a habit to harass refugees, as I had seen. Their forged papers wouldn’t have withstood more than a cursory scrutiny. Out of uniform, would have been arrested as spies.
“Those can get your soldiers out of Morocco,” Mr. Goold said. “They still need transit visas from the Sûreté, and passage. As for your Jew…” Goold seemed to reflect, then reached into his desk and produced a sheet of consulate letterhead and which he wrote a quick note. The note he sealed in envelope, which he addressed and put aside. Then he took out a business card and jotted something on it. Both the card and the letter were pushed across the desk to me. “Go to the address on the envelope and present the card to Mr. Ellerman. I would very much appreciate it, however, if no one sees the letter.”
“Which it persists in shouting at the top of its lungs, at the same time Roosevelt makes quasi-legal trade deals that deliver fighter planes to an air strip not five miles from the Canadian border. How long do you think Germany is going to tolerate it?”
Friends were able to get him freed but could not arrange for the visa that would allow him to join his family in England, and so he stayed in Paris, working on his novel, and contributing articles to the leftwing magazines, which did not endear him to the authorities. He finished the novel and mailed it to a publisher in London exactly one week before Pétain announced that France had surrendered.
“I beg your pardon,” said I, huffing as if I weren’t used to being addressed in such a peremptory fashion.
That was not the place I expected to hear Cockney rhyming slang. I backed to get out of the way of his friends, who started hauling him to the door.
I dined the once or twice in the Transatlantique’s dining room. I saw the chief of the Sûreté, Commander Renault there—Mr. Aldani pointed him out to me—he was with a lady whom I recognized. It was the young woman I had seen in the American Consulate, taking two children by the hand. I learned a great deal about Captain Renault from Mr. Aldani. He was known to provide exit visas for a consideration, especially if one were a beautiful woman.
I never saw the letter Goold wrote but, along with with Kordt’s Emergency Certificate, Ellerman gave me back the card on which Goold had scribbled that brief message. A phone number had been added to the bottom. I still have it, somewhere.
“You’re growing cynical, old friend. Do you recall, when the French government was in complete disarray after Dunkirk?”
“And I will take my patronage elsewhere if you’re going to compare me to Blue Peter.” I looked the fat man in the face, and said, “Let’s suppose—just suppose—that I manage to arrange transit papers for Kordt, will you let him go, or will I have to buy him from you?”
Unwilling to give up, Sherlock continues: “Once I broke an alibi by demonstrating the exact severity of a fold—”
“Please, don’t leave me, John. Beat me or scold me or kick me, do whatever you want, but one thing, just—please don’t ever leave me—”
“In your subconscious Mary is a threat?” John asks, genuinely confused, “I’d say she’s some not worth mentioning nobody.”
“Hmm?” Sherlock stirs, his drying hair brushes John’s neck and his lashes bat against his chest, causing him a little itchy.
All of a sudden, they are so close to each other. So close, that Sherlock can feel the thin calluses between John’s left hand fingers, the warmth radiating from John’s right hand palm, he can smell a tad of John’s aftershave, and he can see the dark-golden tourbillion on top of John’s head.
Half an hour later, she walked out of the police station, the coastline was several blocks away. The night breeze was wet and gentle and warm. She pulled from her shoulders the comforting blanket the young officer nicely put on her, and tossed it to some homeless guy on the street. There’s an account at Bank of England with her name, Martha Louise Hudson. Frank knew nothing about it. She repeated the password inwardly, with all the tears stains on face, a small smile appeared at the corner of her mouth, a smile no-one ever saw.
Two men in exact same dress suits hug her at the same time, encircling their petite ceremony host, housekeeper and family member. Mrs Hudson closed her eyes, letting joyful tears flowing down her cheeks. Who cares if her mascara is melting, now that her boys are covering her up from the crowd. She whispered into their ears:
“You know how my fattie brother works. Last minute he’s as high key as sitting on a parade car side by side with the queen, next minute things are low key enough to disappear a whole aeroplane of people.”
Sherlock stands sulkily in the middle of buckets and buckets of sweet fresh flowers. John is taking his time, picking a little bit of these and a little bit of those, humming nameless tunes, clearly enjoying himself. Tomorrow will be the big day. Sherlock knows that he should try as much as he can to act at least more cheered up, instead of spoiling John’s good mood.
It was true. Sherlock hadn’t planned on saying no to Thomas’s terms. If he could somehow save John, then he reasoned he would do whatever was necessary. But this sent waves of nausea into the pit of Sherlock’s stomach and alarm bells blared in his head. This would taint all that he and John had been. This wouldn’t save John, it would destroy him if he ever found out.
The second night of drinks was much the same. But the air that had once been heavy between them, now seemed to almost crackle with intensity. They found themselves pulled into each other's space, fingertips meeting on the bar, knees bumping and then settling between the others.
"Sherlock, if you try to pick me up I swear..." John narrowed his eyes at the man who was bent over about to scoop him up.
"It's nothing." Sherlock rubbed his extremely red cheek. "She asked me if I could introduce her to you since  "we're friends and all" because you looked like a good catch and I told her that you don't like strippers, or cats which she has three of and that her twin boys are far too old to ever really see you as a father figure." John laughed as he took Sherlock gently by the chin turning his head to examine his rapidly bruising cheek.
Sherlock frowned at the envelope in his hand, his brain couldn’t fix on a single proper thought. ‘Sherlock’ stared back at him in strong clean letters. Sherlock ran his fingers over the ink never more in love with his name then he was in that moment. Blindly stumbling to his chair in front of the fire, he pondered what could John possibly have to say? Sherlock got to his feet and pulled the knife from the mantel. The knife rent the paper loudly in the quiet flat. Sherlock hesitated. He was being ridiculous. But what could John have to say? Deep breath. Keep calm and carry on...
"Brilliant." John and Sherlock held each other's gaze for a long moment, John obviously trying to decide if he was going to kiss him. Sherlock held his breath waiting. A smile spread across Johns face slow and full of heat. "Later." The word held a double meaning. John tugged at Sherlock's coat sleeve as he walked off toward class.
“Oh I don’t know maybe one day more likely then you think. Anyway, down to business you’re here because I’ve got intel. Sherlock’s in danger.”
Sherlock smiled at this and huffed a little. "Let's not and say we did. What are we going to do, stuck here in this oh-so-very cliche blizzard?"
“J.” Mercy’s voice was pained. “Six months. Maybe more. We’ve had Moran on the inside for a month now, you’ll work the opposite end of the supply line and we’ll get them in a pincer move.”
“Before we break I’m going to need a new SAT phone link, and a clean mobile line. Call sign Angus Og.”
John held his hand up for silence, his asset apparently was a genius because he shut his mouth and seemed to come to attention. John signaled for him to get down and picked up his L96A1, he turned off the only light in the room and stepped out onto the porch that lined the front of the lodge. John looked through his scope and quickly found eight Russian’s, fanned out three hundred yards from the lodge. John had to commend them for upping their numbers, but it would do them no good. He waited for his first trip wire to be discovered, and his second to be totally unexpected. John smiled as the explosion took out two of the would be assaillants. Bullets then began to cut through the air and pelt the wall to John’s left and right. Un phased  he raised his sniper rifle and deftly took out the remaining targets. Because that’s all they were. Targets. Nothing more.
Sherlock's face blanched and his eyes glassed over with unshed tears. "Where did you get that?" Sherlock asked just above a whisper, taking a fraction of a step back. "You where never supposed to see that. Never supposed to know." He said the last so softly John nearly missed it.
"Sherlock, get up." Lestrade, grabbed his upper arm and pulled him to his feet with ease. "Come on then, you'll ride to hospital with me." Lestrade, tried to guide Sherlock's path, but he pulled away just enough.
“Don’t be. He’s exposed now. And after tonight I don’t think anyone else will be in danger of being kicked out of Kings, simply because of who they love.” Sherlock kissed John’s red knuckles and ran his thumb lightly over the bruising. “Why did you punch him?”
John smiled at forever, and soon they were lost to a fire that was impossible to control. Sherlock rocked into John's thrust seeking the center of the storm together. John's body spasmed deep inside Sherlock and brought the younger man a shuttering climax.
“Mmm. Men like me don’t retire.” John ran his knuckles over sharp cheekbones and he met Sherlock’s pale liquid eyes. Sherlock looked away sadden by John’s words but said nothing. He was right tho. Men who did what John did, didn’t get old and tell war stories by the fire. They died bloody in the field at the hands of an enemy, the thought made Sherlock feel sick and hollow. A world without John. He let his head rest back on John’s belly, their breathing even and peaceful in this moment mixing and becoming one. John continued to rifle his fingers through thick silk grazing warm scalp.
"Wrong. Obviously wrong. I know why you did what you did. If it had been you he hurt I would have done the same. You killed him, because he hurt me. And I couldn't care less. I'm angry because you put yourself in danger."
“That’s an excellent suggestion on your part Dr. Watson.  I wouldn’t want my brother in harms way because of your carelessness.” Mycroft’s face was pinched and growing agitated.
"Marry me?" John was too emotional to say more. He stepped close and looked up into Sherlock's aqua blue green gold eyes.
"No. It's fine. I'm fine." Sherlock could see the truth in John's eyes. He pushed deeper, his long fingers finding John's prostate with ease. John huffed and panted with a desperation he hadn't expected. "Jesus Sherlock!" And then there was pain that canceled out everything else. John held his breath and Sherlock made to withdraw. "No." John put his hands on Sherlock's bottom and pushed him forward they both jerked sharply as John's prostate was reached again. Sherlock slid his arms up under John's shoulders and buried his face in John's neck. The friction of Sherlock's body pressed into John's cock coupled with the slick glide of his cock inside him was a combination of sweet beautiful painful madness, that rocketed John to breathless release. Sherlock's whole body trembled and jerked sporadically spilling into John with a near howl.
"To be perfectly honest. Nothing. I don't generally find woman attractive, admirable, yes but attractive? Not really my area."
“Yes. Why yes that’s me.” He didn’t say another word just quietly gazed out the window. Sherlock could relate. “Where are you headed?” He asked after a time.
John stared down at the GPS coordinence 20.0225 latitude, 75.1742 longitude. Off the top of his head he knew it to be somewhere in Maharashtra, where exactly he couldn’t say.
"No, not you, " A voice echoed off the millions of red bricks from some where off in the darkness. "Tall and thin, pale. Not golden like the other one." The man's voice was a drawl, each word too long, too breathy.

“Yes, you are. Now if for some reason, you are unable to finish the mission, then I can assign another agent to take your place.”
“Not fuckin likely Moran” John laughed. “and you’re the one who wanted to see me remember. So why am I here?”
Johns voice was gentle, but this wasn't his doctor voice, this was something new and Sherlock couldn't help but think, is this voice mine? Could there be a voice just for the person that John calls his love? And was that now me? As lovely as the thoughts were there was more pressing business to deal with right now. Sherlock needed stitches and Lestrade needed answers. Thankfully Sherlock's wound was shallow enough that John was able to stitch his chest at the crime scene, while he gave Lestrade all the details of what happened below. John had listened to Sherlock tell his story without speaking a word. Now the silent in the cab throbbed more then the pain of his chest if you had asked Sherlock. Once home Sherlock showered and changed into his flat attire (threadbare t-shirt and paper thin pajama paints) and took his chair in the sitting room. John set about making tea still silent.
“Lamb? Am I to assume it is to the slaughter?” Sherlock stepped in and looked about the room he once shared with Thomas. He felt an uneasy revulsion. So much had passed between them in this space that at one time had looked like love to Sherlock. John had taught him better.
It wasn't long before clothes were scattered and warm naked bodies intertwined. John expertly finding all of Sherlock's pint up lust. And Sherlock, lavishly explored the man he had been denied for far too long.
John took a seat at the campfire that the six remaining men had shared not fifteen minutes ago. He pored himself a cup of tea that had been brewing over the fire and gesture for the men to join him. They sat with a mixture of defiance and hesitation.
“Desperately.” Sherlock’s smiling reply was cut short by yet another Russian who seeming sprang from thin air. This one smaller and with a knife at Sherlock’s throat as he viciously yanked at Sherlock’s curls pulling his head back in an awkward position.
"Sherlock, the game is over. Now tell me what you're afraid of. Please." John wrapped his left arm around both of Sherlock's knees, bringing them even closer still, sharing each other's air.
Sherlock watched John blaze across the pitch and was stunned. Sherlock never would have thought that he could find John any more attractive then he already did. He had been abundantly wrong. Watching him practice was one thing, but seeing him play caught up in the frenzy of the game, the power and the agression, the leadership, and control. John was the picture of male beauty. Watching John in his element on that failed sacred Sherlock to death. This man was so far beyond his knowledge. So out of his lègue. Sherlock had to stop this before he found himself in ruins.
“But you blush up so pretty at the sound of a well placed fuck.” John puncuhated the word. “The posh boy likes vulgarity.” John teased. He loved to tease. “Not in yourself. Oh no, of course not. But in me.” John cocked an eyebrow.
"He would have, had my insufferable, meddling brother not told him at my administration that, under no circumstances was my expulsion to ever be so much as considered."
"He wouldn't let me pass." Sherlock said matter of factly without looking away from the fire. (Mrs. "Not Your Housekeeper" Hudson was a god send.) "And I didn't know if you were...alright. What was I supposed to do?" He added a little sheepishly.
"I can't keep you safe here!" Sherlock's voice was frantic and he paced back and forth like a caged panther.
"No. It's not. Really it's not. I've got plenty of mates, none of which I fear for the way I do for you."
John’s thoughts faded, he drifted away into pools of aqua blue green with flecks of gold and let the cold and pain take him.
Sherlock has had a break in the case. But now he believes that John’s future is in danger and the best corse of action is to end things between he and John.
“Yes well before I go” Irene stood next to Sherlock in the door way “just let me say..” Sherlock rolled his eyes and shoved her out the door shutting it firmly behind her.
Christmas at Barker Street dawned snowy and full of surprises. Sherlock hadn’t deduced the fact that John had gifted him The Irish Stratovarius, but not because John had done such a clever job of hiding it downstairs with Mrs. Hudson, but because Sherlock (for once) chose not to see. He actually wanted to be surprised for John's sake. It had not been easy to ignore all the tell-tale signs, day trips to Paris, where violinist Antti Tikkanen was playing, smelling of Hudders, when he came back up after giving her a hug of thanks. Obvious. But for John just this once, Sherlock would turn a bland eye, it was after all Christmas.
“I missed you.” Sherlock draped his arms over John’s shoulders and twined his long fingers in John’s short cropped hair pulling John in for a kiss.
“No idea. What brings you here?” John did not want to talk about Sherlock with this man. John knew that these two were going to be trouble and he’d rather that trouble be all his and not Sherlock’s.
"You don't want me. I'm broken." Sherlock turned and dropped his sheet, his hands balled into fist arms up turned to reveal a myriad of bruised track marks. John's stomach lurched. It was devastating to look at signs of the pain he'd caused, he was the reason that this brilliant beautiful man was naked in the basement of what was essentially a molly house.
"Stop it now. You've got a visitor upstairs. Very handsome one." She said in a little conspiratorial whisper.
"Trained in what exactly? Ineptitude? Overt operations? Because any criminal worth their street name could spot one of your people a mile away. No I need to be the one." Sherlock tugged at his suit jacket and huffed. Rubbish.
"Sherlock, I was just going to ask if you wanted a drink, since it looks like we're going to be here a while."
“Voltaire, if you wouldn’t mind?” Voltaire was Johns explosives expert. If he wasn’t carrying his usual stash of C-4, no worries. Voltaire could take chewing gum, a cotton ball, and your shoelace and make an equally deadly explosive.
For the sake of the job and his sanity John left the rest of Methos to finish the deal in Ireland. He was no good to his team with his head constantly elsewhere. While John had Dutch on surveillance, he took point on recon. He tracked down every obscure lead and whispered murmur, nothing and no one stood in his way. Ruthless was a nun compared to John. He was relentless in his pursuit and cutthroat in his means to find answers John was a man turned inside out and not to be lied to or fucked with. He was the antithesis of John Watson, and in his wake he left hell. But to find Sherlock he would be what ever demon he needed to become.
"No, Sherlock not 'so be it.' Don't you understand, I can not live without you! And that's not wide eyed love talking, its a fact! You are my reason for everything. Have been since the the second I gave you my god damn mobile. I essentially handed you my heart that day. I love you. In every way. And at this point I know, I can't go on without you. That's why I'm angry. I'm nothing without you."
"Which of those things would you like me to address first woman?" Sherlock took the cigarette from Irene's hand that she had been smoking.
Sherlock lay on his bed, legs crossed eyes closed and blew smoke into the air. "No. Something's not right. Everything is too theatrical. Too staged. Who got slapped?"
“I can’t do this. This isn’t going to be enough for me. A quick fuck in every back alley and abandoned warehouse in Eastern Europe. I can’t. Not with you.”
“Yes please.” John replied to the tea and watched his love pad about silently on bare feet around his cluttered kitchen. This place suited him. The cozy sanctuary in the bustling heart of London. John had thought he and Sherlock would spend their limited free time at The Craig when they could, away from the world, but this laid-back little flat felt like home. Their home. John found himself looking down the road to a future with this man. Holy fuck. But first he needed to know if he was walking that road alone.
"Keep the temperature low, we don't want to corrupt any evidence. John." Sherlock walked out into one of the little used back corridors. John close behind. Lestrade went out the front saying he'd be back in an hour. Sherlock practically threw himself against the wall and huffed. John took his place next to him.
"Because John, I find that I want to do...things...with you. And...I...want." He spoke the words slowly as if trying to understand them himself. John thought for a silent moment, watching Sherlock thought his reflection in the mirror who was now gazing at his naked feet on the cold bathroom tile. The fact that Sherlock wanted him and hearing him say those words was so incredibly arousing, that when John did speak, it was with a voice laden with lust. John turned towards Sherlock.
“Love. Maybe. But I need your love and your trust Sherlock. You didn’t trust that I would love you past and all. It's called falling for a reason Sherlock."
“Friends? Of yours? A blunt instrument. Mmm. Yes well the fact remains that I am exactly who you say, and with that comes a power beyond your minuscule comprehension. So I’ll ask you for the *last time.* Why are you here?” Mycroft was now on the offensive.
"No!" Sherlock's answer was immediate. "I mean this was nice, but...I need you. I want you. Not in this way."
John looked out the window without seeing. Soon he would land at a well hidden airstrip on the Pakistan, India border. Soon he would began the very first mission he didn’t want to go on. The key in John’s palm felt cool and nearly weightless. The Craig. He dropped the key into the envelope along with the letter.
"Yes Love." John opened his eyes and there stood his lover, gray silk dressing gown slouching off one shoulder the other leaning on the door frame, one never ending leg fully exposed. John felt the first tug, and drew in a deep breath through is teeth.
“I wouldn’t know, my sinfulness was laughing to loudly for me to hear.” Sherlock tilted his head back to rest on the seat and awaited John’s response.
John had laughed hardly at his sister that day. A week later when Mercy had actually started at MI5, he wasn’t laughing anymore. The choice had been easy from there. A life time of mind numbing normalcy or “super spy” as Mercy had put it.  Holy had protested hotly, and John couldn’t help but think maybe if she had shown some of that fire in the past he wouldn’t be packing his things and heading to parts unknown. John had left that life that and woman behind without a second thought. The years that followed where dangerous and exciting, love had never been on his radar. Sex on the other hand, had. Every place John traveled he sampled their wares, both male and female. In later years refining his taste to male only. But still not even a whisper of a relationship. Until now. The now that was Sherlock. Cool and aloff like the moon, brilliant and mezereising like the stars. John had thought Sherlock would turn out to be a fling that would burn hot and fast, only to cool and eventually go out like all the rest. Oh how wrong he had been. John had realized early on that Sherlock was something incredible. The intensity of what they had was like power itself. Nothing comepared. It felt like they were the center of the known universe and all else could fall away. So to say John was in love, was an injustice.
"Oh, dear God you're right!" Sherlock's eyes widened, and he took a long drag. Irene continued to chuckled in a gleeful yet maniacal little way. "Go away from me woman. I've got thinking to do." Sherlock shoed her away, as Irene cast an impish smile over her shoulder waving in farewell.  Sherlock walked aimlessly about the campus for who knew how long, analyzing cataloging and shelving each snapshot of his brief conversation with John. Sherlock lingered over the memory of John's roughly calloused thumb with the surprisingly gentle touch. He found himself smiling at the idea of calloused fingers being dragged over soft skin. It had been a long time since Sherlock had allowed himself to have the kind of thoughts he was currently indulging in. Which is most likely why he didn't noticed that he'd wandered into an occupied alcove, nearly bumping into the intertwined couple.
“John wanted to come. You should meet him. He’s over there. With Lestrade.” Sherlock turned a bewildered Molly by the shoulders and gave her a slight push in their direction. Sherlock turned and went the other way.
John had never been *in* love. The closest he’d come was Holly, in uni. A tall statuesque beauty with jet black hair aqua blue eyes and skin like cream. (He had always had a type.) Their relationship had been...calm. Normal. Dull. Holy was easy on the eyes and pleasant enough, so John had asked her out. Three years later John found himself ignoring the nagging voice in his head that told him time and time again that this was not his life. But despite his doubts he had began the long and arduous trudge down the road toward domesticity and supposed material bliss. For three years John endured empty conversations with Holly and her equally empty friends, predictable dates and marginally enjoyable sex.
“It is not the criminal’s job to keep you entertained. And, if it were, I’m sure they’d be as entitled to a holiday as the next man. Why don’t you work on your commonplace book—get rid of some of some of this clutter you’ve accumulated.”
I was so overwhelmed with relief, that once I’d achieved the room, I threw myself on the bed. My stomach was roiling, my head was pounding, and my bruised shoulder ached badly where Jimsy had stuck me with the door, but even with all that, the only thought in my head was that Holmes was alive, and would be here
He pretended to be disappointed. “That’s not…what do you say…cricket. It’s the custom in Morocco to haggle, until we reach a mutually agreeable bargain.”
Unfortunately, as London’s youth had fled, and the Camden Baths had a nude bathing policy, Holmes was also correct about hairy shanks and bell ends. The sight of one of our substantial businessman lounging on his back, belly up like a basking walrus isn’t pretty.
In the scramble to get ready, I hadn’t been paying attention to his preparations. Now, I saw that he had abandoned his Harris tweeds for a short double-breasted suitcoat with a cinched waist. In those days, people were wearing what they could find in the back of their closets, but there was something not-quite-English in the cut of the coat, and the way he’d combined it with charcoal grey bags, worn pull-over, and dingy camel muffler…
“Behold Roger Vernet…” Here Holmes made an emphatically gallic gesture to emphasize his words. “He’s as dissolute and destitute a failed writer as you can imagine.”
“It was your duty to save the leg. Now it feels as if you’re going to leave me sitting in a sanitary trench, holding a hand grenade, while everyone else plays least in sight.”
The whole gang—now including Jakov—turned to Ugarte, who had crossed his arms, and was declining to intervene for reasons of his own.
We had not, of course, discussed the route he would be taking, but I could imagine him flying from Lisbon to Gibraltar, then going from Gibraltar to Perpignan by sea. From there, he would travel overland to
Ugarte did not stay long after finishing off his drink; when he left Ferrari drew his thumb across the edge of his lower lip.
“We’re trying to get ‘ome…” said of one of them—Jimsy who, it was obvious, had been born within the sound of Bow Bells.
“I don’t know, yet.” I had a thought, but I wasn’t about to share it with him. It was obvious to me that he was as leaky as a watering can.
“What I do in the Blue Parrot, Captain Renault, is play Backgammon with Mr. Ferrari. You would know that if you bothered read the reports your spies provide you. But, since you’ve chosen to spread the stench of blackmail over this conversation, may I ask if you’re certain you want the world to know you’ve extorting money, and worse, from Jewish refugees?”
“I should have roasted him a long time ago,” said Ferrari. “He was an indulgence in my youth; if I’d known how long they live…”
At just that moment, Mrs. Hudson entered, carrying my traveling case. “Here’s your bag, Doctor,” she said.
“I’m not four years old, nor have I any intention of letting myself to be shanghaied! What do you take me for?”
He took a tentative step forwards and his foot hit something on the ground. The sound of glass rolling around on the floor made Sherlock turn his head towards him. John did not want to think too closely as to what was on the floor and how it stood in relation to Sherlock’s sluggish movements.
Sherlock could hear it in his voice. The panic. The fear. And the realisation that things had gone too far without him ever realising it. Sherlock knew the feeling well. Only he had felt in a room filled with people instead of an active warzone.
‘I will never forgive you for that,’ Sherlock vowed, still not looking away from John’s chest, ‘and I’m sorry. I’m so sorry that I didn’t… I should have known, I always know!’ He wasn’t crying – his tears had run out long before – but his chest felt tight and his throat burned and he couldn’t –
‘Sally will check with his network if she’s able to find one of them. I’ll go to his old places. Will call you yeah?’
There had been a time where he had run down the stairs on the mornings of the 6th of January to find his mother already at work in the kitchen and his father bright-eyed and with a wide smile as he pretended not to remember his youngest’s birthday. Mycroft would always be down later, ruffling Sherlock’s hair as his brother’s interest was completely absorbed by whatever gift his parents had gotten him - he knew Mycroft would have left his own gift on Sherlock’s pillow.
and shake her, demanding to know what the hell was wrong with her. She shot Sherlock! His wife, his pregnant wife, shot his best friend and was now carrying a gun with too much ease and no hesitation to use it again.
John looked at him with suspicion in his eyes. ‘What are you… oh.’ John moved, straddling Sherlock’s hips and he placed his hands firmly on either side of his head. He stared him down. ‘Sherlock, I love you. Whatever was between me and him… it is history, okay? Done. Over and finished. There is no reason for you to be jealous.’
‘I’m right here, Sherlock,’ he reassured him. ‘Not going anywhere. I promise.’ He pulled his phone out of his pocket when Sherlock was under the covers and texted Greg as quick as he could. He waited until he got a response from the man – asking him how Sherlock was and where he found him – before sending a reply and telling him to leave them be for the rest of the night. He shut his phone of and after a few reassuring words to Sherlock, went downstairs to get some water. He made as much noise as he could, to assure the man upstairs he hadn’t left the building. When he got back upstairs he crawled under the duvet, next to Sherlock, immediately pulling his closer to him. The taller man instantly placed his head on John’s chest, wrapping his arms tightly around him. The man was freezing – side effect of the heroin, John listed to himself – and John pulled the covers closer to them both.
John doesn’t say anything, but Sherlock can feel his hand moving to the buttons of his shirt, hovering, waiting for permission. He doesn’t know why John is not asking him, he can’t read him like this and Sherlock fights down the urge to reach out and touch his face, just to be able to feel what he’s thinking. This is infuriating!
John sounds closer now – on his knees, in front of me, his hand on my knee, comforting, I’m… oh. Sherlock breathes, deeply, and John’s hand tightens slightly. ‘’That’s it. You okay?’’
The golden band that once adorned John’s finger was on there, along with his watch. But Sherlock kept his eyes fixed on the wedding ring. He had cursed that thing before, when he had to witness Mary slide it on John’s finger – he had been spared the horror of looking for the rings – and he cursed it now. It seemed so small and insignificant but the mere sight of it caused Sherlock’s brain to settle on the woman who nearly killed them both.
‘Never again, John, please, promise me,’ Sherlock begged. John turned his hand to tangle their fingers together and squeezed. His eyes are red-rimmed now, making the blue in them shine even brighter and it is too much, he nearly lost this forever because he didn’t see, because he failed to keep the one man he loved with all his being, safe. ‘I couldn’t… I would have torn her apart if you’d…’
Something must have shown on his face, because John suddenly takes a deep breath. Steeling himself; Sherlock has seen him do it before. Gently, John takes the cup of tea from Sherlock’s hand and he feels like his heart is going to burst. He doesn’t dare to hope, but he does anyway and he fails to catch John’s muttered ‘please don’t let me be wrong’ over the roaring in his ears and then John’s lips are on his own.
John’s hands traced the muscles of James’ chest and stomach, while staying clear of the scars, causing him to shiver.
Sherlock hears the sharp intake of breath before he feels John’s fingers tracing the worst of the scars. Another inhale. Another. Not a word. Nothing. He dares not to ask anything when he feels a towel being wrapped around his neck. Even though he can’t see, Sherlock looks down, just so John doesn’t have to look at him when he moves back in front of him. Not a word is spoken as John presses the blade against Sherlock’s cheek.
‘John, stay awake, listen to me! What do I do? John…’ Sherlock was rambling, but he didn’t care. Not while John’s eyes were fluttering closed and his cheeks lost their colour and the blood is still pouring out of him and
‘Shut up, you two. Go to sleep. Talk tomorrow.’ John moved his hand from James’ waist to pat Sherlock’s hip spooned against him.
James gave John a pointed look and it took John a moment. ‘Ah,’ he muttered. ‘Yeah. Well, that is the past. He and I tiptoed around it long enough.’
'Yes.' Sherlock didn't want him to finish that sentence for some reason. Next year, he told himself. He would fight for next year.
They had gotten back in touch after John’s divorce. After John had spent a couple of nights there when he hadn’t been sure he was still welcome at Baker Street. Sholto had called him and Sherlock drove up to the isolated cottage to come pick John – angry and grieving over the lies he had fallen to and utterly drunk – up and bring him back home.
It might be a bit not good but it felt unfair not to try. Sherlock might have been called selfish on multiple occasions and he would have to agree if he was honest, but when it came to John, there wasn’t anything he would not do.
James met Sherlock’s eyes before Sherlock continued with his exploration. He had spent hours on John’s scar. Figuring out the bullet, the velocity, the angle at which he had been shot. The infections and surgeries that had followed. He knew it like he knew his own hands.
‘Call Mycroft!’ he snapped at her. Sherlock could see her face become a sickening pale shade. The gun has fallen from her hands and her eyes were still fixed on John’s face. Not his chest. Not at the damage she has done, but his face! ‘Do it, Mary.’
Sherlock’s stomach rolled at the sound of a gun being readied and he wondered how he could have missed this? Sweet, clever Mary. So quick to befriend him, so tolerant of John’s need to go with him, chasing criminals through dark alleyways. Patching them up while they’re both still grinning like madmen, completely high on adrenaline.
Sherlock knew he had Sholto to thank for John’s stammered apology and explanation. For their feelings to be laid bare after all those years. He knew it had been because of his pressing and convincing that John had dared to take the plunge at all. Sherlock had thanked Sholto in private when John was away for work and he had taken his advice to heart.
John is silent for a moment before he moves. He tries to get enough momentum to properly barge his shoulder against the door, but no matter how hard John tries, the door simply won’t budge. Plus, John’s movement presses Sherlock uncomfortable against the wall.
A sudden rush of pain shocked his system and he can hear himself screaming. ‘Stay still, John, please…you can’t die. I won’t let you, you hear it? I won’t let you!’
‘John Watson, I’ll punch you if you don’t go through with this. The ring is lovely, you’re lovely – shut up – and Sherlock is absolutely perfect for you. He’ll say yes.’
John moved, settling himself on his elbows to look up at Sherlock’s face. ‘You want to invite him over for dinner?’
Sherlock’s heart pounded when John moved even closer to him, pressing their chests together. He cradled his face in his hands so he could pull him down. Their lips brushed.
No, not this can’t be happening! This is wrong, this can’t happen. He can’t lose John, not now, dear God please, not now! John can’t say goodbye. He won’t let him.
John’s look rendered him silent and he knows. He knows that John would have done the same if their positions had been reversed. If he had died, John would not have stopped hunting for the person responsible.
John sighed. ‘Yeah, that too. But also between us. I had hurt him, he had hurt me and we never talked about it.’
‘So we’re stuck in the closet,’ Sherlock repeats and John nods, grin still plastered on his face. ‘Both figuratively and literally.’
James said nothing but Sherlock could feel him speed up his movements. John cried out. He was close, Sherlock knew. And he could come like this, without a hand on him; Sherlock had been responsible for it a couple of times. James seemed to know this as well. He was relentless, placing his feet on the bed so he could drive his hips up with a higher speed and more force.
To this day he still didn’t know exactly why he chose that night to call his brother and ask for help.
When John had noticed the card his mother had send him in 2011, he seemed properly ashamed of himself for never asking Sherlock’s birthday. ‘Next year,’ he promised after Sherlock ensured it was quite alright. ‘Next year.’
Sherlock kissed John between his shoulder blades before reaching back, grabbing the lube and condoms from his bedside drawer. James’ hand settled on his hip.
Sherlock smiled softly and with weak legs, stumbled to the bathroom. He wet the flannel quickly, rubbing himself clean, before rinsing it again and he went back. He stopped in his tracks at the sight that greeted him.
Sherlock raises his hand to his cheek, feeling the stubble there and he has to admit it; it feels dreadful. And who else but John does he trust with this? He nods and Sherlock can hear the smile on John’s exhale. It’s peculiar, how easy he managed to tune his hearing to John. Or perhaps it isn’t. Perhaps nothing has ever been more obvious.
‘For 32 seconds I forced your heart to beat. In those 32 seconds I filled your lungs, twice, with my air.’
'The woman never gives up,' Sherlock muttered. He moved in to grab the envelope - read it before tossing it away like he always did - but something in John's gaze stopped him.
‘He’s not at the flat,’ John breathed. ‘He has been here though. Tore everything apart. Have you heard anything?’ He had to ask, maybe…
‘’No, shut up, Sherlock,’’ John snaps and Sherlock listens. ‘’You hid this. You were hurt and you hid it from me. For God’s sake, Sherlock, some of these… when?’’
James tightened his hand on Sherlock’s thigh. ‘Yes,’ Sherlock breathed out. ‘Yes, John, please…’ And he slid his finger inside of John.
James let out a shaky breath before smiling. He hadn’t removed his hand from Sherlock’s hip and he didn’t when Sherlock opened the lube bottle to coat his fingers.
He rose to his feet and leaned over John’s shoulder to brush his lips against John’s smile. John’s eyes were crinkled, his face relaxed. Happy. In love. Sherlock kissed him again.
It isn’t until the last of the stubble has been removed and John applies the aftershave he knows Sherlock favours, that Sherlock breaks. With John’s face so close, he reaches out, clasping John’s cheeks in his hands. He freezes.
Sherlock huffed and took a careful sip of his tea. That was when he saw it. The envelope addressed to him in his mother’s handwriting. Next to John’s laptop.
Later, when they both had regained their ability to breathe and Sherlock has cleaned the cum of John’s chest and belly, they wrapped themselves up around each other. It was then when Sherlock suggested it.
At the top of the stairs, Ugarte knocked on the door of the first dressing room. “Delilah?” he called. “Are you decent?”
“It’s not for me. It’s for a friend. I thought you would know someone who might consider sponsoring him.”
“Thank you, Doctor!” he cried. “I’ll have a car here in an hour. And I’m sorry—I hope that it won’t be more than a small sacrifice—but for your part, you’ll need to be clean shaven.”
That his amusement at my expense was well deserved but didn’t make it any more pleasant to tolerate. I had been looking forward to a week’s fishing in Scotland; since that had been rendered impractical, the only relief I could find from the heat, as well the oppressive atmosphere in our sitting room, was to spend part of the day at the new swimming baths.
“Mrs. Harris to the life,” said I, pinching the bridge of nose between two fingers. “That does sound like a secret lot. They were looking for Holmes, I presume?”
“The Vichy French? Did you forget about them? I’m sure they’ll be over the moon, having two Englishmen drop in for tiffin.”
I spent few days exploring Casablanca’s Medina the same I had explored the Khan al-Kalilli in Cairo. As a lad I had imagined finding Aladdin’s lamp among its dusty treasures. I never found it and there was no magic lamp in the souk of Casablanca, either, yet I did see wonderful things: rugs, blankets, plate, enamelware, silverwork and polished brass. I tasted olives and breathed saffron, cinnamon, cumin, turmeric and ginger root, all heaped in baskets in the spice stalls. Not the least of that pleasure was the intensity of the colours and smells, after the muted notes of my poor beleaguered England. It was a feast for the senses.
God would not help either Mr. Sherlock Holmes or myself if we failed scrape our boots or exchange them for slippers the moment we stepped in the front door. Sleep was impossible, tempers frayed, and every sensible person with the means fled to the countryside or the seashore.
“My superiors think the risks are worth it. But tell me, Mr. Ugarte, since you know so much about me, what is your business?”
The only time I saw him behave in a manner less than courteous to anyone was when a dirty little street urchin came to the Blue Parrot, trying to sell wormy dates. Ferrari drove him off with a kick.
“Aren’t we all?” I said, bitterly. “Why don’t you come swimming with me; the exercise will do you good.”
I don’t know if it’s that I’m a sucker—as the Americans say—for a good story, or I was recalling the face of that poor man the French police had dragged away. “I’ll meet him.” I knew it was a mistake as soon as the words were out of my mouth.
With the telegram in my hand, I climbed into the lift and pushed the button for my floor, but I was too impatient to wait until I got to my room. I tore it open and then leaned against the bars of the cage. The telegram read—ORDER DELAYED STOP EXPECT DELIVERY SOONEST STOP—J HARRIS—PURCHASING—WINDWARD SPICES.
His purpose—in case I have not been perfectly clear about the nature of Ugarte’s business—was to complain the Sûreté had raided one of his house—it was unprecedented—and two of his girls, found to have expired papers, had been arrested and taken to the internment camp at Ayachi. He would have to find replacements for them.
He was a small man and had rather wide set eyes that gave him a froglike appearance. His voice was certainly soft—I couldn’t place the accent—but his manner was altogether unctuous and ill-bred. But if he wanted to make himself useful, I would put him to work.
We were traveling right into the heart of French North Africa. I realized I had been smoothing my upper lip with my thumb. It was a nervous habit. I made a note to check it.
I put the receiver on the hook and glanced at my watch. It was some hours yet before the time I had arranged to meet Ugarte; a couple of matches of backgammon would pass the time. When I stepped from the alcove, though, the board was on the floor and Ferrari was out in the garden, yelling at someone to leave the bird alone, or he would take a stick to him.
“Would you like a whiskey? You look like you need one.” he said, indicating a well stocked bar against near the window. “I know I do.”
was a rather undistinguished building with a crowd of people in front of it. As I climbed out of the taxi, all I can say is that I was right gob-smacked at the number of people waiting to get in—over two hundred, and most of them European, some with children in hand. While they were calm, standing in a ragged line of conversational groups, there was a palpable air of tension and their attention was fixed on soldiers who controlled how many were permitted through the doors at any one time.
Back at the Transatlantique, I found that the short gray hair that I had glued across the crack below the door handle with a touch of spit was gone. Someone had entered my room and tossed my things while I was out. Since they made a neat job of it, and nothing was missing, I failed to mention the incident to the concierge later when I asked him to recommend a restaurant for dinner.
“My dear fellows,” I said. “I can see the you’re frustrated and anxious to go home. But, please be patient, and persevere a bit longer. I don’t know what I can do to help you yet, but I mean to do everything in my power, and I don’t despair of finding an answer.”
“Do, by all means! As an American citizen, any crime I you care to accuse me of will be adjudicated by the American embassy in Rabat.” That, too, was true. “But, allow me to explain something, to you. We are not realistic people, we Americans, not by your standards, and there are shortly going to be more of us pouring through Casablanca than you can possibly imagine. Do you understand me?” Stunned, Renault turned ashen, and I caught a rank whiff of fear “When this war is over, whose side do you want to have been on?”
