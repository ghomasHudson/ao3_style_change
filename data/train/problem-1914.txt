“Welcome to the Knight Bus, emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard. Just stick out your wand hand, step on board and we can take you anywhere you want to go. My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor this morning.” A young man with a pimply face and a purple uniform was leaning out of the back of the bus.
“Oh. Okay,” he said. The rest of the ride was silent. Harry felt sick the whole time, but said nothing to Sherlock.
"No. Excuse me." the four of them had reached the end of the hall and were now standing in front of a tall desk with an old goblin sitting behind it. "We would like to access Harry Po-Holmes's vault, please." The goblin leaned over the desk and scowled at Harry.
"Well, it could be the Lost Diadem of Ravenclaw, the Deathstick, the Resurrection Stone, the Philosopher's Stone, any number of lost wands, honestly, there are so many cursed or enchanted or magical objects in the world that could be hidden here, it's impossible to narrow it down," he said, sounding defeated.
"What can you tell us about the cases you've been on?" asked George excitedly as he and his brother sat down on the grass. Harry was more than happy to tell them about cases, it was far better than being asked about his dead parents.
“No reason,” said Harry, picking up a few pictures that had fallen off his walls while he was gone. “Anyway, what do you guys wanna-” he was interrupted by John knocking on the door.
Mycroft Holmes, the eldest of the Holmes children, held a small position in the British Government. That is to say, he was the British Government.
"What did you do to it?" asked Draco, awestruck. Harry quickly explained the warding and runes, happy to see the shocked expression on his friends face.
"The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rule-breaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the House Cup, a great honour. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours.
to know that an action always brings it consequences and you have to do the right choice always. Always. You look like a smart boy, but you have to do the right choices if you want to get somewhere." John nodded absentmindedly.
Sherlock rolled his eyes but nodded. "It was as if he had never seen me before. He asked me who I was." Behind the detective's apparent composure hid a hint of despair, of bitterness and sadness. It was the first time he opened to Greg.
As soon as his patient was out of sight, John allowed his shoulders to sag slightly, his eyes falling closed momentarily, the shift in demeanour betraying his fatigue. While helping people was what he’d longed to do since his primary school years, he’d never quite envisioned himself as a therapy practitioner. In fact, he hadn’t seen himself anywhere but on the battlefield, suited in a bulletproof vest, toting a British Army Browning L9A and a med kit.
“Sherlock Holmes,” she said, voice dropping, “put the bloody teeth in, or so help me I will do it for you. I will tackle you to the ground and hold you there until you beg for mercy twice.”
“I’m being paid to mind,” she returned easily with a smile that didn’t reach what John could see of her chocolate brown eyes, and John gave a small nod and a sigh through his nose in response.
The silence was comfortable until the sound of a distant siren behind them broke through the relative silence of the night.
The soft, golden light that illuminated the small room did nothing to mollify John’s nerves as a shadow on the wall cast by a chair made his heart leap into his throat, the phantom screams of innocents from his dreams roaring in his ears with his frantic heartbeat.
After a long moment, Sherlock’s chin lifted in acknowledgement before he finally tore his eyes away from John to strip off his long, sweeping, charcoal coat, and he took a seat in the chair he’d previously, wordlessly claimed as his own. When John took a seat in the chair opposite, the man spoke.
Sherlock turned to look at John, who still sported a light flush on his face that trailed down his neck to disappear under his jacket, but the doctor was valiantly trying to stave it off and distract himself from it by getting involved in the conversation. When the man gave Sherlock an expectant look, the detective realised belatedly that he’d been staring rather than offering an answer. He took in a sharp breath through his nose. “I think they’re smarter than we give them credit for,” he supplied, turning his gaze back to the front seat of the car, looking blankly at a spot on the front window. “These aren’t just petty criminals. They’re members of a gang whose origins date back to the seventies.”
John just rolled his eyes. “Quite right,” he murmured, and sat back in his chair with a sigh. “Well, as far as advice goes for kicking your cocaine habit, if you’re looking for advice, first, I would recommend you to a therapist who is actually
“Would Irene have any clue?” he asked, and moved, cursing as something with a wooden handle clattered to the floor. “There should be a light in here,” he grumbled, staggering towards the door.
John’s concern grew. Now that he mentioned it, Sherlock was looking a bit peaky. “Mm. You okay to make the trek to the road for a cab?” he asked gently as he slowly slid down off the ledge and stood before the detective, who took a fortifying breath and nodded.
“Doctor Watson! How are you, mate?” Lestrade greeted, and Sherlock rolled his eyes heavily at the over-abundant enthusiasm - though he was placated slightly by John’s happy smile, which he caught out of the corner of his vision.
“Yes. That,” Sherlock agreed with a nod. “Ah. Yes. East. This way.” He gave another stunted nod and turned to resume his stride down the pavement, and despite the fluttery feelings in his chest and stomach, he found himself growing more confident and more focused with each step, and he smiled unabashedly when he heard John’s laughter from behind him as the man moved to catch up.
“Well, this one did.” Greg looked thoroughly pleased. Sherlock looked as cool and calculated as ever; but as John looked between the two men, he could tell that Sherlock, inside, was brimming with excitement.
“Is that the place?” John asked, indicating forward with a nod of his head towards a house that appeared incredibly lively compared to the ones surrounding; lights of different colours emanated from the windows and John imagined he could already hear the thumping bass of whatever music was playing.
“Oh?” Sherlock leaned as casually as possible against the counter. “Why not?” He nearly flinched at his own question, but apparently he hadn’t dug his hole deep enough, because he kept talking. “You seem like someone who would be well sought-after.”
All thoughts of himself vanished, though, when he remembered Sherlock was still in the room - but he couldn’t entirely be blamed for nearly forgetting, as the room was dead silent save for John’s own breathing and the sirens outside. He looked up, wide-eyed with concern, to see Sherlock, whose eyes were even wider than his own, staring at Pavel’s body on the ground. His hair was disheveled from having been grabbed and pulled at by two separate people in the span of five minutes, likely still sticky with the blood from Pavel’s fingers, and in his pale hand was John’s gun; he held it in a white-knuckled grip it by the barrel, having bashed Pavel over the head with the heavy solidity of the butt of the SIG.
“How do you figure?” John asked, arms crossing over his chest, one hip cocked against the edge of the table.
Thankfully, he was able to swallow the mouthful without incident, grimacing at the feeling of the pills sticking in the back of his throat. He made another small sound and was about to reach for the cup when it was once again pressed against his mouth, which opened greedily to quaff what was left of the water. Disoriented as he was, he found himself unable to ignore the warmth that radiated from the guiding hand resting at the back of his head, and from the body that stood so close to him. That heat was immediately and sorely missed when the man pulled away (but not before letting his fingers linger in the thick curls at the back of Sherlock’s head), taking the emptied cup with him.
“Good Lord,” Greg murmured, sounding physically ill as he turned away, shaking his head and heading towards the door. “Come outside and see the paramedics,” he called back to them on a sigh.
“Yeah, but this is more fun.” The look in Sherlock’s eyes as he spoke was almost manic. It probably should have been concerning.
“Something like that,” he responded, and it was then he realised he wasn’t exactly sure where they were going. “Where are we going?”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “He’s more than capable of handling himself, John. And it’s not as though he isn’t compensated well. That ten quid was a down-payment. He’ll collect the rest later.”
Four car doors opened and slammed shut in tandem and a series of voices John couldn’t make out accompanied the sounds of feet hitting the ground. He could just barely make out the sounds of a set of keys jingling through his panic when he was tugged by the arm, and he turned to find the circular beam of Sherlock’s small torch flying frantically around the vast space of the inside of the warehouse. Just as a pair of feet plodded around the ground just on the other side of the door and a clumsy hand fumbled with the doorknob, the doctor was pulled roughly around and to the ground. He landed on his arse pressed close to Sherlock, and looked to see the man’s torch turn off just as the door they’d come through swung open.
The first man snorted a hideous laugh. “Get ready to ditch your vodka and swap it for port wine, you fucking Russkies,” he said, and his laugh was joined by a few others as the men milled about, doing what sounded like moving boxes.
A glance to his left showed the same colours, predominantly orange, casting a soft glow over John’s face as the shorter man gazed at the scene. Maybe one day, he thought, he could fulfill what John would likely be more inclined to enjoy; a candle-lit dinner and two glasses of wine next to a window overlooking the Thames at sunset. Maybe then John could help him once again see the beauty in the city that, up until his first appointment with the man those weeks ago, didn't seem like it had much to offer him anymore. Or maybe, if John would allow it, Sherlock could study the world from a different perspective, observing how the different hues of red and orange and yellow reflected off of the water to paint John's skin the colours of warmth and comfort.
“John,” Sherlock breathed, trying to get the other’s attention, but it allegedly came across as a sigh of passion, the answer coming in the form of an acknowledging hum against Sherlock’s carotid. Sherlock’s hips gave an involuntary jerk forward at the teasing brush of teeth against his throat, followed by the soothing sweep of a tongue that had him making a noise dangerously close to a squeak.
John hummed in acknowledgement as he looked in the mirror, tentative fingers reaching up to brush over the dried layers plastered to his neck with a mild grimace on his face. “What are you going as again?”
This is a bigger and quite plot-driven chapter to make up for the wait. And the next chapter is in the works, so while I'm not going to make any concrete promises for a deadline, I'd say... you can expect it, most likely, within the next week.
His wandering fingers found their mark and a dim, exposed light bulb flickered on overhead, illuminating the small foyer. On the wall adjacent to the door was a series of hooks, each adorned with a jacket or coat or scarf or bag, and it appeared Sherlock had run out of hooks because a few jackets and bags had found a place scattered on the floor in amidst several discarded pairs of shoes and boots. John sidestepped the small pile of garments and headed into the small kitchen, and he had to hold back a groan when he turned on the light. The detritus that was scattered on the kitchen table and over parts of the countertops painted a picture of very recent recreational drug-usage; several syringes were strewn about, small bags that clearly used to contain white, powdery substances, and a dirty metal dish over a Bunsen burner that John didn’t have to be a man of science to know
Once again, John’s face contorted in confusion as he looked at the detective, and he was further confused when he noticed, out of the corner of his eye, that Sally was walking briskly towards them from her place at the police cruiser by the tape. His confused expression was mirrored on Anderson’s face; though after a moment, the other man relaxed.
Sherlock tipped his head to the side just so. “Correct, but you know this is reaction is not unique to physical discomfort alone."
Thinking quickly, Sherlock donned a weary expression, slumping where he sat, head falling back against the wall once more as he took a laboured breath. “I don’t think so-” he could see John’s look of mild confusion out of the corner of his eye “-I think I need to go home and lie down. Text me with any findings,” he said in lieu of a dismissal, and watched Lestrade set his jaw, nod once, and give a wave of farewell to John before joining a group of uniformed officers sweeping down the hall towards the lifts and the stairs. As soon as they were out of sight, Sherlock dropped the act, eyes hardening as he sat up straight and pulled out his mobile.
John extended his own to accept the gift - which turned out to be a small, brass key. He blinked at it, almost uncomprehending.
“What are you doing?” the blond asks, the question drawn out with confusion and surprise, and a little amusement. Sherlock frowns.
“That’s all well and good,” John interrupted, “but why did they kill Blessington? What did he do to piss them off? Did they just get mad at him for leaving?”
“Hush,” she admonished, though her lips were parted in a smile. “I’m going to look fabulous, and I’ll pop a pair of fangs in,” she explained, and Sherlock snorted.
“I- yes, you may. Help yourself to whatever you need,” came the doctor’s response as Sherlock bent down to rifle through the duffle bag containing his clothes John had retrieved for him.
Mary and John watched him go with a laugh shared between them, before turning back to avoid staring at Greg dealing with ‘Chelsea’ and her drunken antics. “Looks like you didn’t pre-game hard enough,” Mary quipped, and John snorted.
“You can’t rush beauty,” Mary mumbled from where she had her face nearly pressed against the mirror, a dark charcoal pencil held delicately in one hand.
“Do you?” The question wasn’t sarcastic; Sherlock looked genuinely curious. “Besides living with an alcoholic brother?”
object back in the back of the drawer, and quickly tossed the pants he’d collected onto the bed to join the socks and laptop.
The lost look on Sherlock’s face, along with the silence that accompanied it, gave John the impression that no one had ever asked that question before. It probably wasn’t something Sherlock gave much thought to.
Irene immediately made herself busy by perusing the alcohol selection while Molly excused herself, braving the throng of bodies in the kitchen to fetch the three of them cups. Sherlock, for his part, stood and surveyed the crowd in the main room with a withering expression, and let out a dejected sigh as he turned back to Irene. “I will never forgive you for bringing me here,” he said, but as the other turned to retort, they were both interrupted by Molly’s chipper voice summoning them as she broke through the people lingering in the kitchen doorway to rejoin them; and trailing behind her was a young woman Sherlock didn’t recognise, and a young man he recognised all too well from days spent in the labs on campus, where the windows overlooked the rugby pitch. His mouth snapped shut and Irene looked up at him with a sly grin. “You were saying?” she asked, looping her arm through his, and Sherlock didn’t get to reply before Irene plastered on a smile as Molly approached them.
“Course you are,” John murmured, and Sherlock could almost hear the rolling of his eyes and the quirk of a smile on his lips.
basking in the rich scent of sandalwood in the shampoo he used. He’d found a clean washcloth folded on a shelf by the shower and used it to scrub the invisible grime from his body; it had been days since he’d showered, and he hadn’t felt quite right since he’d gotten sick. It was a wonder John had been so willing to be so close to him for any length of time. The water, scalding hot, cut through Sherlock’s bone-deep chills and did wonders to clear his mind; while his head had been unavoidably clouded for the past few days with intermittent thoughts of the army-doctor who was playing as his host, which wasn’t helped by the fact that he was going through withdrawal and there were no new solid leads in the case, now he was beginning to gain his focus back. Despite the fact that his criminals were likely out of the country, that didn’t mean that all hope was lost. At least, that’s what he told himself as he shut off the taps, shook his curls free of excess water, and exited the shower.
“Oh, we can’t have that,” Matvei said, and raised his free hand to hold it out to his side and slightly behind him, palm up in a silent request. “You failed with Sutton, and you will fail with us. Except this time we will not force you to live with your failure,” he said with feigned compassion, and John’s worst fear was realised when one of the other men in the warehouse stepped forward and deposited a pistol into Matvei’s outstretched hand. He should have expected it, but nothing could have prepared him for the painful throb of terror in his chest at the sight of Matvei’s Cheshire grin combined with Sherlock’s sharp eyes widening with barely-suppressed panic as the gun was raised.
The doctor gave a light-tipped smile. “Thank you. Sorry for the trouble,” he apologised, and Greg shook his head.
, when they’re high. And they’re not. Sure, something can be said for the confidence boost you might get, but it doesn’t really change anything about you; and it
His question was met with a withering glare, and John suddenly felt quite silly; but he hadn’t much time to ruminate on it, as Lestrade suddenly brushed past them and headed towards the door which John knew led to the back of the building, and to Blessington’s office.
John ruminated over his response for a few moments before answering. “I think these are different circumstances. I was dealing with prescription drugs that I had to monitor my intake of quite closely, and didn’t have to pay for, whereas you are dealing with a street drug that you can get any time as long as you have money. Is money an issue for you?” he asked.
Greg sighed again and shot John a disbelieving, yet apologetic look. In return, John just smiled reassuringly.
“Listen,” John said, changing the tone of his voice slightly in an attempt to allay the confrontational mood that charged the air in the room, “you’re a smart man. Arguably a genius.” He raised his eyebrows, and Sherlock huffed derisively. John continued. “I don’t know you all that well, but I can tell you’re strong-willed. You’re stronger than your addiction, Sherlock. Honestly, you are.” His lips curled into a gentle, almost fond smile. “And my job is to help you realise that.”
The revving sound of a blow-drier was shortly followed by a warm stream of air gusting across John’s neck. Mary’s curious finger prodded at the layer of latex and tissue plastered in a thick band across the front of John’s throat, and, once satisfied with its state of dryness, turned off the blow-drier and smeared another layer of goo and plastered another layer of torn tissue strips to John’s skin.
He stuffed his phone into his pocket and stood up; but the action sent his head swimming once more and he swayed on his feet. Thankfully, he was stabilised not a moment later by a pair of strong hands; one grasping his arm, the other pressed solidly to the small of his back.
As always, thank you so so so very much for reading. I'll let you all know now that we're nearing the end of this story. By the next update I'll know how many more chapters exactly there will be. Until then, I wish you all a fantastic weekend and a great week ahead. Endless thanks once again to each and every one of you reading this. See you back soon. <3
Baffled, Sherlock’s cheeks heated up, and he tried to convince himself that it was from the beginnings of withdrawal rather than anticipation at the implication of staying here for another night - or two. “But- you have work.” Surely that was a valid reason.
didn’t have you under his fat thumb,” the younger man spat out, his posh accent and rumbling baritone a stark contrast to the voice of the other man. The elder of the two sighed heavily, eyes pinching shut, and his mouth opened to retort, but John acted quickly.
Sherlock sat back on his haunches, closing his small, collapsible magnifying glass with a sharp snap, looking too smug for his own good. “Not much.”
All of a sudden, with the change of verse in the song, came a change in motion; John’s hands trailed down Sherlock’s hips and along the outsides and fronts of his thighs as John lowered his own body with a systematic swaying of his shoulders and hips in a slow snaking towards the floor to the tune of
Shaking his head with a soft chuckle, he turned to go through the glass-paneled door to the bathroom where he quickly relieved himself. As he moved to wash his hands, he caught sight of a toothbrush still in its wrappings, fresh from the shops. He blinked; had Sherlock gone out and bought it for him? There was another toothbrush resting beside it that looked used, so John felt he had no other option than to assume it was indeed meant for him. So, after drying his hands, he unpackaged the toothbrush and uncapped the nearby toothpaste to make quick work of brushing his teeth
For a fraction of a second, Sherlock’s eyes lit up. A youthful exuberance took over his features and John found himself growing overwrought with anticipation, with excitement over this newfound treasure that was sitting before him. But in an instant, the young man’s dark, guarded mask was back, his jaw set, his body seemed to fold in on itself just so, and those keen blue-green-grey eyes dimmed as he stared the doctor down. Instead of answering John’s question, he merely lifted his chin sharply in a gesture of stern defiance and said, in that low baritone that held a razor-sharp edge, “your five minutes are up, Doctor.”
John purses his lips, averts his eyes. He sighs. “Harry,” he murmurs, and Sherlock thinks he doesn’t need to hear any more. John continues anyway. “She…” he huffs, frowning. “She called me at work. Absolutely out of her mind. Shit-faced.” His eyes close tightly, his expression pained. “She… she’d been driving.”
With that, please read, be merry, and do not hesitate to leave your thoughts in the comments. You know; stroke my ego and all that rubbish. See you on the flip side!
He laid down over the sheets, which he’d neatly made that morning whilst Sherlock had been in the shower, and closed his eyes. He’d thought it’d only been a moment, but the next thing he knew, Sherlock’s low voice was saying his name, and there was a gentle hand at his side.
The ex-army doctor was pulled out of his ruminating by the sound of a small bell, signifying someone entering through the front door of the establishment. He looked up to see a man, his light brown hair rather overwhelmed with silver, jaw set and face hard with determination, striding towards the receptionist’s desk. The young woman sitting there looked up with a pleasant smile and the two of them began speaking, the man’s tone more hushed, and his words more hurried. John, sensing a potential walk-in, sighed silently to himself and made his way out of the office to the toilets across the hallway. Ms. Winstead had been his last scheduled appointment for the day, and while he welcomed random walk-in appointments, he needed time to regroup before he saw anyone else.
“I-” the younger man paused, blinking a few times before clearing his throat. “I didn’t know. I mean, I had guessed about the night terrors, and the drinking, but-” Sherlock pursed his lips, just looking at John with a sort of renewed interest, like John was somehow now more intriguing. “I didn’t know,” he said again, a little softer.
He is completely out of his depth. He is worried about John. He and Rosie both need comforting. And so, entirely on impulse, he does the only thing left that he can think to do.
“You git,” he teased as he turned around to rinse the suds off of his back, combing his fingers through his hair one final time to be sure he’d rinsed out all of the conditioner. “See you when you get out?” he asked, and Sherlock nodded with a smile.
John thought, brow creased with discontent, and he exited the webpage, sliding his fingers across his mobile screen to open up his text messages out of reflex, not even thinking, pulling up a blank message to text Sherlock with a demand for answers...
The doctor rolled his eyes, and heaved a sigh, intending to convey how very hard Sherlock was making it to feel bad about himself - but he couldn’t help the small smirk that turned up the corner of his lips. “I suppose I put up a decent fight tonight-- we both did,” he acquiesced, much to Sherlock’s delight, if the soft smile that graced his lips was anything to go by. “Speaking of,” John continued, easing away from the depth of their conversation by steering back to what they’d come in here to do in the first place, “I’m knackered, you need a shower, and I’m supposed to be the therapist; not you,” he teased lightly, and Sherlock scoffed and rolled his eyes.
Thirdly, while pushing Sherlock up against the tiled wall of the shower and shagging him senseless provided a wonderful mental image, it certainly wouldn’t be very safe considering there was no way to ensure either of them wouldn’t slip. Add to that the fact that they were on a time crunch, and it didn’t seem likely to John that they’d get up to very much in the shower. And he didn’t mind that at all. This was nice, just sharing this close space with Sherlock.
“Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that,” John murmured, his own grin audible in his words, and Sherlock gave a hum in acknowledgement.
rooms in his Mind Palace; his childhood bedroom was one of them, the music room in his grand-mère’s estate in Provence, France was another, with an en-suite with a view of the lavender fields. Other rooms were made up; perhaps modeled after existing places, but none of them had a perfect likeness to a place of Sherlock’s past, as he didn’t oft appreciate being reminded of his past in most instances.
Strangely enough, it didn’t occur to John until he was walking through the door to the office behind Lestrade and Sherlock, that there was a dead body on the other side.
“Sherlock? Come in, come in,” the doctor ushered, a small, tired smile gracing his features as he stood politely to pull the door shut as Sherlock stepped inside the small office. He could feel the younger man’s steady gaze boring through him before he even turned around to look at the other. Sure enough, stormy, opalescent eyes met his own in a penetrating stare once he’d turned to face him; though, strangely enough, John found himself almost reassured by the solidity and sureness of it. His own smile softened, growing a fraction more genuine. “It’s good to see you.”
last night, for fuck’s sake.” The man’s cheeks grew impossibly more flushed at the verbalisation. “We basically
Sherlock visibly deflated, and John looked at Lestrade as though the man had punted a fucking puppy.
“John,” Sherlock looked at the doctor as if he’d grown a pair of extra arms, “any other day, I’d be more than happy to overstay my welcome, but, seeing as I’m likely to be experiencing withdrawal symptoms rather soon, I- I’d rather not subject you to that.”
Wracking his brain to remember the details of the latest victim in the string of killings - Peter Something-Or-Another - John sifted through the archives of the website until he came across the thread of articles reporting on the serial killer investigation. Surprisingly - or, perhaps,
John blinked as his body caught up to his brain, and he made after Sherlock; but not before looking at Sally and giving her a once-over, her skirt baring her lightly-bruised knees to the world, and the devious, knowing grin that fought its way onto his face couldn’t be schooled, so he turned to quickly follow Sherlock inside before it overwhelmed him.
“Yes, I’m- heading home,” he said, knowing he didn’t sound quite as confident as he’d intended to, but John’s hand in his own grounded him.
“The search for Laura Tanning came to an end two days ago, when a maintenance worker made a gruesome discovery; a body, hidden in the brush, on her way to work-” a map that had appeared in the corner of the screen displayed a blue dot between Kew Gardens and the Thames “-law enforcement officials called to the scene later determined that the body was that of the twenty-two-year-old Imperial College student, who had been missing since last Thursday.” The solemn face of the news anchor disappeared as the screen transitioned to a photo of the young girl, her dark-blonde hair long and wavy, the sweet smile on her face reaching her light blue eyes, which were shining with happiness. The news reporter’s voice came through again, as he told the story of the young girl who had passed, but the words that were spoken didn’t register with John as he stared at the screen in shock. He didn’t need to check the messages on his phone to know that the girl whose smiling face was depicted on his television was none other than the corpse in the photograph Sherlock had sent him those days ago. The screen changed again, to a video feed from a news camera, regaining John’s attention as yet another familiar face was shown, apparently being interviewed.

“The bag, yes; he had a bag, a good-sized duffel, earlier today. It was under that window. John remembers.” John nodded. “Where is it? What have you done with it?” Sherlock asked as he went to look at the body again.
He watched Matvei jerk his head up in Pavel’s direction in a silent demand, and Pavel proceeded to check around the wooden flats that Sherlock had emerged from behind. Thankfully, his search didn’t take him to John’s new hiding place before he wandered back to join his brother, where he snatched the phone from Sherlock’s hand.
“I’ll fall asleep again soon,” John reassured; as he spoke, he could already feel sleep taking him. His eyes were open just enough to see Sherlock’s smile, radiant with open affection even in its smallness.
The light of the morning that had been streaming in through Sherlock’s bedroom windows was filling the sitting room of the flat with a hazy glow when he emerged from the hallway. He breathed in the scents of recently-brewed coffee and freshly-toasted bread, smiling as his breath left him in a noisy sigh.
John took a fortifying breath. “In Afghanistan, after I was shot… I don’t remember much, but apparently I dug the bullet out of my own shoulder,” he said, and watched Sherlock’s eyes widen a fraction. “After that, I drifted in and out of consciousness through the rescue and the airlift home, and the next few weeks of my life were, essentially, an arduous, drawn-out, miserable fever dream.” The tight smile that adorned the doctor’s features held no mirth. “It got infected. Horribly so. Nearly did me in; it was touch-and-go for a while…” His words trailed off and he shook his head before letting out a heavy sigh. “Anyway, when I was finally out of hospital, I was given morphine to help with the pain. And, well, I wasn’t in the best place, so… yeah. I abused prescription painkillers, got higher dosages that I didn’t need, spent my days blissfully drugged up and then drank myself into oblivion at night to try and avoid the nightmares.” The retellings of his own troubles spilled forth with little effort, as the ex-soldier had come to terms with his dismal reality long ago; but Sherlock, unexpectedly, seemed rather stunned.
“I went to therapy.” John’s grin grew and was bordering on giddy as he gave his playful response. “And I listened to my therapist,” he added, and threw in a wink for good measure.
As he stood admiring himself, Mary had taken up the space beside him, looking in the vanity as she coaxed her blond locks, which she’d grown out to shoulder-length, into soft, loose, ringlet curls with an iron.
the entire six blocks to the party, but with each step they took, Sherlock felt his trepidation rising, his fingers twitching in his pockets (he’d managed to pry his arm from Irene’s grip) anxiously.
“Wait-what? Sherlock!” John broke into a run after the man, dashing across the street when Sherlock did, though
“Molls, there you are. I’ve been looking all over for you- oh! Hey!” Greg had stepped up to toss an affectionate arm around his girlfriend’s red-draped shoulders, when he noticed who Molly was speaking to. He looked them both over and grinned. “Who let you two in?” he asked, and Irene and Molly shared a chuckle while Sherlock tilted his head in clear confusion.
And while I'm thinking about it; if anyone would like to see a potential epilogue for this little story, let me know in the comments. I could easily whip something up. ;)
“No,” Sherlock answered simply, and the small smile that disappeared behind the rim of the bottle in John’s hand sent something in Sherlock’s stomach aflutter.
John’s smile was stunning. “Yes. I’ve been captain of the rugby team for two years now,” he said with a hint of pride.
And that, in that moment, felt like a bigger achievement than all of his degrees and war medals hanging neatly on the wall of his office combined.
It was scary to say; of course it was. It always was, the first time. And this wasn’t the first time, not
“That’s not an uncommon feeling,” the doctor began, and shifted forward in his chair. “The difference here, from what I’m gathering, is that the high has less to do with you physically

Somewhere deep within Sherlock’s subconscious, he registered the scents of dust and cleaning supplies in the darkened room, and he heard the slam of the door behind them as John kicked it shut, but at the forefront of his mind was the feeling of John’s warm breath against his face, of John’s hands grasping at his lapels, at his waist, at John’s voice, soft and breathy with a sense of urgency as it spoke his name… and then, finally, John’s mouth, warm and solid and wet, crushing against his own.
Rosamund Watson, on the other hand, does not do any of those things. No; when Rosamund Watson is at all upset, she
going to be receiving my monetary compensation from him, I think he owes it to me posthumously to at least keep me occupied by letting me find his killer.”
Sherlock, clearly unaffected, just rocked casually back onto his heels as he looked around with an air of nonchalance that John would never pin to someone at a crime scene. “Naturally,” the low baritone rumbled out, and as Anderson was making to walk away, Sherlock spoke again. “Your girlfriend was supposed to come back from her semester abroad a few days ago… was her flight delayed?”
Mind made up, Sherlock carefully walks across the floor in his stockinged feet to retrieve his mobile from the sofa before ascending the stairs as gracefully as possible so as to not jostle the sleeping toddler in his arms, and he shoulders open the door at the top of the landing, not even turning the light on as he carefully creeps inside the room. It feels like he’s invading John’s privacy; which is strange, because he’s never felt that way before whilst rummaging through his flatmate’s things. But he pushes the thought aside as he approaches the cot, and he reaches into it with one hand to pull back the miniature blankets before gingerly, carefully lying Rosie down on the small mattress. Her eyes open slightly, and for a brief moment Sherlock panics, getting ready to start singing again - but the moment passes as her eyes fall closed again and her small lips part with her gentle breaths. Sherlock lets out a soft breath of his own as he reaches down to cover Rosie with the blankets, making sure she’s tucked in, before he turns towards the rest of the room.
“Bit warm,” John said in a mumble, and Sherlock just hummed in response, savouring the contact until John pulled his hand away; and while the prolonged contact could have been seen as excessive, Sherlock was willing to forget entirely about professionalism for the moment. “You’ve been awfully twitchy,” the doctor continued, and Sherlock opened his eyes again to see the concern clearly written in John’s expression.
hell she wasn’t spilling out of it. Though it probably had something to do with how snugly the black bodice hugged her waist. More attention was drawn to her bust by the emerald pendant that hung about her neck, and the green that seemed to be the underlying colour scheme for the night was mirrored in the subtle and dark velvety green of the long skirt of the dress, which was covered in a layer of elaborate, black lace. The sleeves of the gown started below Irene’s shoulders and ran the full length in dark green velvet down to taper nicely at her wrists and end in a subtly-ruffled cuff where her slim hands with emerald-painted nails and a couple flashy rings emerged. “What do you think?” she asked, black, strappy heels of an absurd height clicking primly against the marble floor as she spun a slow circle.
“Her,” he said, motioning with a subtle nod of his head. “The girl in the atrocious candy-corn costume.” He glanced to John and watched his eyes move to the girl. “Do you know her?”
A flurry of motion to his left was followed by a loud grunt, and the sickening crack of something solid impacting skull, and John watched with awe as Pavel’s awareness left his pale blue eyes. The man slumped and fell, half on top of John, who squirmed and quickly pushed the man off of him with no small amount of effort. Hastily, he rose on shaking legs, chest heaving, head and body aching, and as he looked down at Pavel’s unconscious form, his tongue darted out habitually to wet his lips - only to be met with the strong taste of warm copper.
Self-consciously, Sherlock looked around - and rationally, he knew that no one was paying attention to them. Everyone was absorbed in their own dances with their own partners - and then it occurred to him that John was his
do you imagine he has?” The man lifted his umbrella off the floor to examine the end of it absently. “I’m the closest thing to a friend that Sherlock Holmes is capable of having.”
“Mm,” he confirmed with a subtle nod. “You said I could have tea later. It’s later.” The justification was accompanied by a mild shrug, and Sherlock couldn’t quite help the soft chuckle that bubbled up from his chest, however much it made his head ache.
He hadn’t been expecting layers of white glue and torn facial tissues to be pressed to his neck, with an intimidating spread of powders and gels and brushes and unmarked bottles spanning the surface of Mary’s vanity beside them.
They both spoke simultaneously, and John went absolutely scarlet and rolled his eyes as Sherlock gave an impish grin, looking thoroughly pleased.
“Please,” Sherlock whispered frantically, breaths coming in short gasps, and John looked at him helplessly-
On one of his bad nights, the feeling of the gun in his hand, weighty with the implications of just why he held it, would have sent him collapsing back onto his bed, wracked with tremours and, sometimes, tears.
The doctor made a surprised sound, eyelids fluttering briefly before he closed his eyes and smiled against Sherlock’s mouth. He tilted his head slightly, pushing back into the kiss, holding the contact for a few moments more before pulling back. “We have to eat our toast while it’s still warm, love,” he whispered with a grin, and was dazzled by the brightness that bloomed in Sherlock’s eyes; it was one of fondness, elation, and something akin to excitement.
“Uh... “ The doctor cleared his throat, suddenly feeling a bit put-on-the-spot, as he looked between Lestrade and Sherlock; the former of whom looked a bit tired while the latter looked enraptured. John just barely fought back a blush. “So. Not like someone killed him and then strung him up - clearly ante-mortem hanging; cyanosis - blue face and lips, blue and swollen tongue with teeth indents in the tip to show it was pressed against his teeth… um. The- the rope is fixed here-” he pointed, “not high enough to exert pressure mainly on the bottom of the chin, neither was the point of suspension low enough to induce slow asphyxiation… I mean, the jugular veins weren’t obstructed while the arteries remained untouched or anything. Um… the knot,” he touched delicately at the knot fixed at the side of Blessington’s neck, “must have pressed against some part of the cervical sympathetic. That’s why his eye’s open.” He chewed his lip, searching for anything else to say. “Ah, likely vagal inhibition, since he’s not all swollen - but it could have been something else, and the congestion could have drained through the vertebral venous plexus, if it wasn’t damaged. Which, considering his size, is likely… but I’d need more than five minutes with the body to tell you.”
of generosity and he couldn’t imagine he’d ever doubted the morality of the genius before him in the first place. And then he’d acted on impulse - and it was very likely something that had been building for days or even weeks - and he’d kissed him.
“I’m coming down,” Sherlock explained pointedly, jaw set and eyes hard with the unshakable determination of someone chasing a high, desperate for the next fix.
Once satisfied with his state of dental cleanliness he shut off the tap, ruffled his hair habitually in the mirror, and elected to ignore the barest hint of stubble that was forming on his jawline as he made his way out of the bathroom.
The silence that followed worried Sherlock to the point where he almost stopped walking to further try to convince John that what he was doing wasn’t horrible, that it was mutually beneficial; but it was actually John’s voice which ended up stopping him in his tracks.
Sherlock blinked a few times in quick succession. “I- yes,” he affirmed. “It was the least I could do. His mother is a lovely woman. She helped me collect information on a school administrator who was embezzling funds a couple years back. And his brother is quite adept with a lockpick, he-”
“Then we can both be in the bathroom at the same time,” Sherlock concluded, already heading off in the direction of the bathroom, unbuttoning his jeans along the way. John went after him, pulling off his own shirt and tossing it near the foot of the bed.
The morning had been pleasant. After they’d reached the agreement that Sherlock would be staying at John’s flat for the duration of his detox in an effort to get him clean in a safe manner while still keeping Sherlock relatively comfortable and
“Yes,” Sherlock confirmed with an enthusiastic nod, eyes devouring the older man’s length. “Absolutely.” The word came out in a dark purr that sent a shiver down John’s spine. He grinned wolfishly.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, and then shut them as the world spun. He grunted, grimacing in discomfort. "You're not making me uncomfortable. Far from it, actually," he grumbled. “You’re a doctor,” he continued, leaning his head back against the wall again, keeping his eyes closed. “Surely you understand the science and biology behind
“Mm.” Sherlock turned again to head to the desk and open a laptop sitting on its surface, the glow of the screen lighting his face.
Sherlock wandered over despite his better judgement, and looked down at a small capful of paste, what looked to be a lolly stick, and then glanced at Irene’s reflection, trying and failing to hold back a snigger at how ridiculous she looked with her fingers in her mouth, lips pulled wide apart to avoid getting lipstick on her digits. She frowned at him and made a displeased sound, which Sherlock ignored. She removed her fingers a few moments later and admired her new teeth in the mirror, before turning to Sherlock and flashing him a grin.
But tonight, Sherlock decides, he will enjoy the feeling of being wrapped in John’s warmth, enjoy the flutter of John’s lashes against his skin, enjoy the steady rise and fall of John’s chest against his ribs…
John wasn’t sure if he was more thrown by the offhand comment about his possession of a firearm (which was something he’d tried very hard to keep hidden, seeing as it was rather illegal), or by the way Sherlock had successfully hailed a cab with such ease during rush hour. He resorted to crediting the cab-hailing skills to some sort of black magic, and focused instead for the time being on the topic of his gun. “How do you know I have a gun?” he asked with trepidation.
However, none of that meant that he couldn’t still appreciate her body. And she looked fantastic in her costume, even if it was a cheesy, stereotypical one.
Sherlock managed to not roll his eyes at the public display of affection and instead turned to Molly, who was blushing obnoxiously and smiling to herself. “I- I assume he’s treating you well, then?” he asked, earning a surprised look from both her and Irene at the uncharacteristic display of almost-concern. He ignored their looks and instead waited for a response.
Thankfully, the only reaction it garnered was a look of revulsion and a small sound of distaste from the other. “Nothing of the sort.”
Sherlock reels slightly at the topic-change. “Well,” he sighs, “I have a reason to be.” His arm tightens minutely around John. “Two reasons, actually,” he muses with a small smile, closing his eyes as his ears pick up Rosie’s soft breathing nearby.
The pair looked at each other in silence for a beat, and the taller man’s smile was colder than the chill that had settled into John’s bones from his rain-wet clothes, and the whisper that followed was almost too quiet to be heard over the steady patter of the rain on the metal roof.
follow you home?” An accusatory finger pointed in Sherlock’s direction. “If you need help, just tell us; we’ll jump at the chance to put him down-”
“What?” he asked, suddenly self-conscious, and it was then that he realised Sherlock’s eyes were trained on his shoulder. The ex-soldier’s cheeks warmed at the realisation, and he quickly turned away - but that revealed the entry wound in the back of his shoulder, and he inwardly winced. “I’m sorry,” he apologised quickly, and opened his mouth to say more, but he was startled by a slightly-chilled hand coming to rest on his back, directly over his scar. A small gasp left him and he stared, in horror, at the closed bathroom door. “Sherlock,” he breathed, half a warning, half a plea.
“Mm,” the other hummed as she placed a dollop of beige cream onto a brush with surgical precision, “maybe so, but there’s no hassle to the costume. Short skirt, cropped, low-cut top; and God forbid someone other than you is actually just looking for a nice time tonight.” Her smirk was audible in her voice as she leaned forward to press her brush to John’s neck, and the man flinched lightly where he sat at the chill of the liquid against his skin. “Christ,” Mary chastised, “you’re such a baby. How do you manage rugby in the cold and the rain?”
As a side-note, yet another thing I've learned is that I have a tendency to end chapters with someone falling asleep. Does it get monotonous and predictable? Probably. Oh well.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
It was probably a blessing in disguise, the fact that the weather had taken such a dismal turn, because if it weren’t for the torrential downpour, there would likely be more than a few people on the streets. It wasn’t terribly late, only half-nine on a Thursday, but the deluge had scared the less-adventurous and more-sane inside, and the only people out were buried beneath dark umbrellas and bustling past; too distracted to notice Sherlock, who was ambling along at a pace slow enough to manage without stumbling, in awe of how each individual raindrop felt and sounded against his hair, his coat, his skin. Everything, he watched, as it was rewound and fast-forwarded again, and then he watched as everything went strange, turning into geometric shapes of different diluted colours, washed dull by the rainwater. His breathing was rapid, and his heartbeat out-pounded the sound of the rain, and the lights from street lamps and shops that struggled to shine through the curtain of water blinded him, and the water dripped down his face and got into his mouth and his nose and he was
For some inexplicable reason, John felt heat rush to his cheeks, though he did his best to ignore it. “What, I can’t be glad that my client isn’t putting himself in more physical danger?”
Or, rather, this morning, John thought to himself with despair as he caught sight of the clock on his bedside table. The ex-army doctor sat up in his bed, his tee-shirt close to soaking with perspiration and clinging to his heaving chest, his vision swimming as he fought to regain some semblance of composure.
A familiar face graced the screen as the television screen crackled to life, and as the picture shifted into focus, the voice of the middle-aged weather reporter on the screen came through, informing John and the countless other viewers in the area about what weather they could expect for the rest of the week. A look at the forecast made John think that maybe he should have stayed outside longer to appreciate the nice weather; gloomy skies and rain were imminent, according to the colourful pictures on the screen that the meteorologist motioned towards with exaggerated movements. But John was tired, he’d had a long day, and he had to get up for work in the morning. There would be more nice days, eventually.
“Duty calls,” the man breathed as he swept across the room, donning his coat. His feet carried him quickly back to his desk to stuff his things into his pockets, and he opened the door to leave, before doing a double-take in John’s direction, halting in his tracks. “What are you doing?” he asked incredulously, as though John had done something horrid.
The smile on Sherlock’s face was wolfish; he looked like the cat that caught the canary, self-satisfied, with a head swimming with wicked thoughts.
And then John giggles. He shakes in Sherlock’s arms, and Sherlock can feel the puffs of his breath against his neck. Sherlock blushes fiercely and makes to pull away.
“Yeah?” John prompted, seemingly realising that he’d been scrubbing at the spoon for a few moments too long as he put it hastily aside on a small towel with the other clean dishes to dry. He turned off the tap, and shook his hands dry as he turned to lean back against the counter. His brow had taken on creases borne of inquisitiveness rather than concentration. Sherlock wondered absently if he should catalogue just how the creases in John’s face changed according to each expression the man adopted.
meant that the blond got to sprawl supine on the sheets that were of a noticeably higher thread-count than that which he normally slept on. He could get used to this.
John pursed his lips lightly as he listened, and remained silent for a few long moments when Sherlock finished, just thinking quietly to himself. Finally; “how long have you been using drugs?”
“If anyone were to ask,” Sherlock said as he stepped onto a rather large slab of concrete and surveyed the dark, mostly-vacant lot before them, “which I doubt they would, it wouldn’t be difficult to convince them that the pair of us had buggered off somewhere away from prying eyes for a snog.” The man turned around, a small smirk on his face as he reached a hand out to help John onto the concrete slab. John, cheeks colouring lightly at the comment – and at the truth of it – reached up to grasp the proffered hand gratefully, and was hauled up onto the concrete shelf. He returned the smile and gave Sherlock’s hand a squeeze before letting it fall from his grip.
and you’re opting to fixate on whether or not I’m attracted to you?” Sherlock asked, aiming for incredulous, but failing to keep the smile out of his voice.
John didn’t think his mood had ever changed so drastically in such a short period of time before in his life, as it did when that familiar voice emanated from his doorway in a solemn greeting.
“Here,” Sherlock said after he was rinsed, “switch me spots. You condition your hair, I’ll wash your back, then rinse off; you have to get going soon.”
“Oh?” the doctor inquired as he ambled closer to lean in the archway connecting the kitchen and the main room, and he snorted a laugh. “If you wanted to stay somewhere with proper heating, you could have just asked; didn’t have to go to the trouble of nearly overdosing to get me to offer up my bed.” The doctor’s smile faltered a touch, and Sherlock had a feeling the man had let slip a touch more than he’d intended.
The other man took in a long sigh and shifted his weight on his feet. “Well, if you were to reconsider, I could supply you with a reasonable sum of money on a regular basis to help ease your way.”
“Don’t fret, Dr. Watson,” the woman’s voice came out in a smooth drawl, and John did a double-take. “You’re right where you need to be.”
“You- told me to bring it,” he murmured, starting to wonder if he’d made a mistake in pulling it from its hiding spot too soon, but he was assuaged by a brief shake of Sherlock’s curly head.
This time around, Sherlock’s blush was clearly visible. The young man’s cheeks reddened, his eyes widened and flitted to look at the floor, and he cleared his throat awkwardly before looking back up at John, lips slightly pursed. He looked between the doctor’s eyes, as if searching for something - any sign of deception or untruth in his words. But his search was in vain, if the small, shy smile on Sherlock’s lips was anything to go by. “I- thank you,” he said, and John had a feeling those were not words that he exercised often.
“I do,” Irene confirmed, patting her shimmery, dark-emerald purse which held her phone, both their wallets, and, thankfully, his smokes. “Not that you’ll be needing them,” she added, shooting him a look.
“I’ll have them both dry-cleaned,” he said. “I know someone who isn’t squeamish about blood.” The taller man gave a wry smile at the startled expression John aimed at him.
Sherlock blinked up at John, his lips parting in silent surprise before he found his words again. “I- can’t stay here,” he said at last.
John let out a breath and turned away from the wall-cum-evidence-board to grab Sherlock’s laptop off of the desk that sat against the adjacent wall. He unplugged the charger from the wall as well to take it with him as he moved towards the unmade bed in the corner of the room. He had to step over a few miscellaneous piles of clothes and books and papers on his way, and he huffed as he set the laptop and cord down on the bed. Christ, Sherlock cut such a tidy figure; John hadn’t expected for him to keep such chaotic rooms. Nevertheless, he knew not everyone was as anal about organisation as he was. At least, John thought, it appeared Sherlock did keep his
” His yellowed teeth were visible between his cracked lips, parting in what looked like more of a grimace than a smile, and John braced himself.
he tried again, his hand reaching up to grip tightly to hair at the back of John’s head, when a noise behind them followed by multicoloured light spilling into the small space made them freeze.
“Well… obviously, the bag wasn’t in the room. It wasn’t in the main room when we came in, so where else would it be? That car,” he motioned towards the vehicle in question, “was here earlier today. Plates from Scotland; St. Andrew’s Cross as a decorative touch on the side, and the model fits that of the set of keys on Blessington’s desk. So, his car. It’s the only car still here. And it doesn't belong to the night cleaning staff, because they wouldn’t have been here during the day. It could have been another member of staff, I suppose, but the Scotland plates were the largest indicator.”
Sherlock cleared his throat lightly. “Sebastian- my roommate-” he elaborated with a glance at John “-he… he hated me. Everyone did.” His eyes returned to the carpet, so he missed the distressed look on John’s face. “His dealer would come to the dorm room from time to time, and I would make myself scarce; I elected to
What was, in actuality, mere minutes, felt to the doctor more like hours, before the car alarm outside stopped its high-pitched sonance, and John’s body slowly uncurled from the small bundle he’d worked himself into in the corner of his kitchen. The only sound now was the low hum of the refrigerator, the drone nearly deafening in the eerie silence of the flat. John’s weary, bloodshot gaze fell upon the shattered remains of his precious RAMC mug, translucent umber liquid surrounding the pearly, jagged bits decorating the cheap linoleum floor like an abstract sepia filter, and his adrenaline-addled mind likened the white porcelain to pieces of a skull, the macabre line of thought expanding to compare the brown fluid to blood, after oxygen concentration is reduced outside of the body and plasma is released. Almost.
Greg spoke confidently, but Sherlock's gut was heavy with a sinking feeling. He shook his head as he stood up straight, vacating the computer to scrub a hand over his face and wander over to lean against the closest wall, suddenly feeling lightheaded. “They would have wanted to leave the country as soon as possible. I’m surprised they even waited this long," he murmured to no one in particular. “A flight to Russia - most likely destination given ancestry, no stops… two one-way tickets… large amount of money given time restraint and potential luggage. Desperate to leave-” a breath left him in a slightly laboured puff as he pinched his eyes shut against the light in the room, which had suddenly grown brighter. His train of thought, verbalised, made little sense; even to him. What had he been saying? He peeled his eyes open to look at where the worker had resumed his position at the computer, joined by Greg, and he regretted the decision instantly.
Among the bottles were several mixers, including a jug of dark, red liquid. “If there’s cranberry juice, I’d have that with vodka,” Sherlock suggested. A bit of liquid courage wouldn't go amiss.
“That’s… great,” Sherlock breathes. “That’s great. I’m glad. And I hope it helps her. More for your sake, than hers.”
“No,” the man said, voice pitched a little higher than normal, before he cleared his throat. “I just wasn’t exactly prepared for- for how unfairly, overwhelmingly attractive the sight of you holding a gun would be.”
“One vodka cranberry, coming right up.” John retrieved one of several bottles of clear alcohol and a half-full jug of cranberry juice, and carefully measured out with a practised hand a moderate amount of vodka before drowning it in juice. The drink finished, John handed it over to Sherlock with a smile, and Sherlock thanked him with a nod.
Suddenly, Sherlock sprung up and moved to push Lestrade aside. “Large black duffle bag! Did anyone see it?! Did any of you imbeciles move it?!” he called out as he pushed his way down the hallway, Greg and John hurrying after him.
Squinting against the golden light streaming in through the window near the bed, Sherlock gave a displeased groan at having been stirred from slumber by the familiar chime of his mobile. He burrowed his head further into the firm solidity of the chest in front of him in a futile attempt to escape the unwelcome summoning.
“You know,” he began, “any other day, I’d love to be absconded with. But I’ve got cold groceries that need to be put in my fridge,” he said, pointing a thumb over his shoulder back towards the car with a look of feigned apology on his face. “So whatever this is, let’s make it quick, shall we?”
The drink was tart, as Sherlock expected, and he pulled a slight face as the first sip went burning down his throat. John’s expression was amused.
“You’ve been a good little pet for the police,” Matvei said, raising his own gun to press the end of the barrel bluntly against Sherlock’s forehead. John’s eyes honed in on the man’s thick thumb pulling back the hammer, and he pulled his back at the same time, timing it so that they clicked simultaneously. “But your time is now up. Boys,” Matvei addressed over his shoulder without taking his eyes from Sherlock, “gather up the goods and ready to take them to the boat. It will be here soon.” His attention turned fully back to Sherlock, and his head tipped slightly as a morbid smile slowly stretched across his face. “Dasvidaniya.”
with help from an acting class elective meant that he, as her best friend, was going to be her subject for experimentation. He’d agreed without knowing exactly what he was getting himself into. Maybe some faux stitches, he thought. A plaster here and there.
Sherlock’s face, when John looked back, was twisted into a suspicious look, but soon enough he was on the move again, skimming over dusty windowsills and flattening himself on the floor to bury his face in the threadbare carpet and crawling on all fours to examine every centimetre of the wooden chair that was tipped sideways next to the body, every action completed with a dramatic flair that John would reserve for superheroes or divas.
“This is going to bruise badly,” John murmured, eyes continuing their inspection of the skin around his nose and eyes as he heard Sherlock step out of the shower.
He closes his eyes as he pats Rosie’s back, repeating “it’s okay” in the same soft timbre he’s been using all night.
They strode the rest of the distance to the end of the street, and neither of them could explain the sudden, miraculous appearance of an unoccupied taxi cab, but they didn’t question it as Sherlock hailed it and they climbed in.
“What qualifications do you have to help clients through addiction?” Sherlock inquired bluntly. “Besides your various degrees,” he elaborated with a flippant wave of one hand vaguely in the direction of the degrees hanging on the wall by John’s desk. His arm returned to cross over his chest with the other, but the stance was a bit less defensive now.
John recalled Sherlock saying he didn’t get paid, that he didn’t really work for New Scotland Yard; he merely helped out on occasion. Regardless, it didn’t quite make sense to John why Sherlock refused to take credit for his contributions. Then a thought struck him: maybe Sherlock
from the car was sauntering towards him, her obnoxiously high heels clacking against the smooth concrete floor and reverberating off of the metal walls to fill the space with sound.
“Have you?” John asked. “That’s hardly fair, that you’ve seen me and I haven’t seen you. You should have come and said hello.”
“7D Montague,” John repeated with a nod and a small smile, before standing up, his chair pushing out a short distance behind him. Before he stepped away, however, an urge too strong to deny overcame him and he found his hand moving before he gave it permission, to reach up to Sherlock’s forehead, brushing aside his dark fringe and, just like earlier, pressing the flat of his hand against the younger man’s skin. And again, just as before, he watched Sherlock’s eyes close in something akin to bliss, heard the soft exhale, and felt the man push into the contact. The skin was warm to the touch, but not concerningly so; it was expected that the man would run a bit of a fever, but hopefully he wouldn’t get much warmer than he currently was.
John laughed and stepped away from the counter. “We can go find her and nab them, then step outside?” he suggested. “The back garden wasn’t horribly crowded last I saw.”
“Mm.” Sherlock’s hum of agreement was followed by a brief silence, before the raven-haired detective spoke up again. “You said you listened to your therapist. What did your therapist tell you?”
, and even goes so far as to dig one of John’s dirty jumpers out of the hamper in their shared bathroom, tries wrapping it around her to envelope her in the man's scent. She rejects
“He’ll do that,” he said with a smile as he walked past John, headed back towards the building. “You learn to get used to it. He’s a character, he is.”
“Well, we can sit down and talk about it-” John ignored the disgusted sound that emanated from the dark-haired man “-and see what’s going on… A little intake appointment. Quick and painless. That okay with everyone?”
it’s a crime scene,” John tried between his own bouts of quiet laughter, chastising both himself and Sherlock for their immaturity - however well-merited. “
“What’s that?” John asked softly as he shifted closer to peer over Sherlock’s shoulder, catching sight of the glint of clean metal in what little light there was.
to get shot ever again, he’d rather spend an eternity suffering than let anyone come close to harming Sherlock Holmes, if he could help it. His heart rate accelerated as he watched Kent’s finger twitch against the trigger of the pistol in his hands, and John dove out of the way as another gunshot echoed in the space. John fired and missed, moving too quickly and too erratically to properly aim, but what mattered was that he was drawing the attention of everyone in the room. They were paying attention to him, not Sherlock. The doctor landed on the floor and rolled smoothly over, rising to one knee and pointing his gun once again to Kent, who bared his teeth and flipped his greasy, long brown hair out of his face before firing.
of a bullet ricocheting off metal sounded much too close to John’s head for his liking. He quickly ducked, but his cover was already blown.
Up until this point, he had been cautious, but accepting; it was a scenario he never thought he would be in, and he was certain John felt the same. He was somewhat comfortable with the knowledge that they were both not expecting to wake up in the presence of one another this morning. It was uncharted territory for them both, and John, bless him, took it in stride, morphing into a proper, if impromptu host for his unexpected guest.
John hummed in assent. “I suppose you’re right. My time has come and gone,” he said with a sigh. Sherlock looked as though he wanted to say more, but he remained silent as John opened the final set of doors for him that led outside. There, the doctor paused, remaining inside, but keeping the door open as Sherlock turned around where he stopped on the pavement just over the threshold.
“You left me to pay for the bloody cab, and now you’re asking for a tenner? I didn’t realise my sole purpose on this excursion was to cover your arbitrary expenditures,” the man argued, even as he pulled out his wallet and rifled through the small number of bills tucked away inside. He extracted a ten pound note and held it out in Sherlock’s direction, which the detective took and pocketed quickly. “Mind telling me what the fuck that’s for?”
Sherlock took a breath, snapped off his gloves, and stood up. “Victim is clearly in his late forties, asthmatic, diabetic, morbidly obese. Former member of the gang that has been keeping you lot at the Yard busy for the last month. Scared for his life, he hired help to keep himself safe from vengeful gang members under the guise of keeping his shop protected. He packed a bag, intending to travel for a few weeks-” he looked towards the window where the bag had been sat earlier that day “-and was in the process of leaving… He was leaving tonight. But he ended up getting himself killed in the process by the very two Russian men he’d hired for his own safety,” he said, trailing off a bit near the end as he continued looking around the room.
Between everyone in the warehouse, many bullets had flown; and the building acted as a terribly efficient echo-chamber, distorting John’s memory of just how many times a gun had actually been fired. But he knew that his finger had pulled the trigger of his own gun four times.
“Yes,” Sherlock replied, sounding almost distracted as his eyes were fixed on something behind John and off to the side. John didn’t bother to look. A few moments of silence passed before the doctor spoke again.
“I’m amenable,” Sherlock rejoined, his voice echoing off of the tiled walls inside the shower. “Better hurry, though, unless you want me to use up all of the hot water.”
John grinned. “I can hold my alcohol. And this is only beer number five,” he said, lifting his bottle to take a small sip. Sherlock mirrored the action with his own cup.
Sherlock pretended that he couldn’t feel the warmth radiating off of the other man from this close, just as he pretended not to be dangerously close to leaning into it. “I’m fine,” he responded automatically, turning his head to look up at the other.
The blond giggles, and the sound soothes Sherlock’s very soul. “Damn. Wish I would have been here to see that.”
It’s half eleven. John Watson isn’t home. Rosie is utterly unhinged. Sherlock’s resolve is crumbling steadily around him like the weathered stone walls of a deteriorating, ancient castle.
In response, Sherlock’s eyes darted to the side, and he shrugged mildly as one hand rose from his lap to gesture vaguely at the space around them. “For everything. Your help. And your hospitality.” He swallowed, not daring to look back at his host. “I realise that my being here is highly inappropriate, and likely a significant inconvenience to you; you have work, and a life outside of it.”
” John asked, growing more distraught with each word that left Sherlock’s mouth. “Jesus Christ, you’re
know why John Watson’s room in his Mind Palace was as warm as a cable-knit jumper and as welcoming as a hot cuppa and as bright as an ex-army doctor’s charming smile. He
John’s cheeks heated, his gaze involuntarily skimming down Sherlock’s body, already undressing the man with his eyes. “I don’t… think that would be very conducive to me getting ready for work in a timely manner…” His argument was weak, and he knew it.
He grit his teeth as he shut the drawer with a little more force than necessary, because with the subject of his and Sherlock’s relationship still on his mind from his ruminating on the way to the flat, the last thing he needed was to stumble across a fucking- God, a bloody
God, was it possible for someone’s heart to break through one’s own ribs? “Please,” Sherlock managed, and it was a wonder he was still standing after the smile John flashed him as he reached for a cup on the counter.
John gave a half shrug and a small smile. “Just happy to not be in said unfortunate circumstances. Tea?”
“Not a robbery,” Sherlock repeated, “but a murder.” He ignored the stricken look John gave him. “Mr. Blessington has been killed.”
“Whaar arre y-- where are you going?” Sherlock asked petulantly as John opened the closet door, though he was arrested by the sly grin John cast him.
A mumbled series of expletives he couldn’t make out sounded behind him along with trudging footfalls as John made his way across the room. The footsteps stopped near the bed, from what Sherlock could hear, and the detective paused in tying his shoe as he pondered a moment.
Bids,” the man still holding his gun yelled, and John ducked as the gun in the man’s hands aimed nearer to where he was hiding.
a surprise,” he said, and Sherlock could almost assuredly hear the smile in his voice, “but… if I’m honest, I’m incredibly glad that I did.”
“Near Heathrow? The Airport?” John asked, and Sherlock didn’t have to look to know there was a perplexed furrow in the man’s brow.
Sherlock scoffed and rolled his eyes, foot bouncing where it hung aloft in the air, crossed over his other knee. He shot a withering glare towards the silver-lined mirror on the wall which Irene stood in front of, finishing a flawless wing on her left eye with the black liquid eyeliner brush held expertly in one steady hand.
Sherlock just rolled his eyes, and, conveniently enough, his mobile chimed in his pocket. Frowning, he pulled it out, and John had previously thought it wasn’t possible for the man to look any more inconvenienced. He held the phone up to his ear. “What?” he barked, and silently excused himself from the group, continuing to talk on his phone as he meandered back into the fray of police vehicles and police tape that surrounded the building.
“Stop staring at my arse,” Mary murmured at her own reflection, words holding no bite, and John laughed.
“I’m going to stop you there,” John said before Sherlock could go any further, and Sherlock, obediently, fell silent at the firm and determined tone of the doctor’s voice. “Sherlock,” he addressed, and the detective could hear the man shifting his weight between his feet, along with a slight rustling of fabric signifying a change in posture. “I won’t lie and say that coming home to you lying in my bed
And it had to have been only a moment ago, because the room wasn’t flooded with police. He could hear their vehicles outside, still not having arrived. Christ, how long was it
? His right temple throbbed achingly and his vision swam as the left side of his head that had impacted with the concrete floor gave a violent throb as well.
John was endlessly thankful for the chill in the air, because it meant he could blame the flush in his cheeks on the cold. He took a moment away from his musings however to focus his efforts into hailing a cab now that he’d reached the main road, which, thankfully, didn’t take terribly long. It seemed to John, as he entered the back seat of the taxi that pulled up to the kerb with a huff of exertion, the rain which had scared most sane people inside the day prior had kept them inside.
much paperwork,” he whines. “And my phone was dead, so I couldn’t even call you and let you know what was going on. I’m sorry about that,” he says sincerely. “I didn’t mean to leave you with Rosie for so long.”
All of a sudden, it clicked; John’s mind flooded with the vivid memory of earlier in the day, back at his flat, when he’d taken his gun out of his bedside table drawer and checked the chamber.
After a brief period of shuffling between the items in Sherlock’s hands, the man spoke. “Lockpick set,” he said, and turned on a small torch with a quiet
Two repeats of the song later finds an exhausted Rosamund Watson collapsed against the chest of an equally-exhausted Sherlock Holmes. The man stands in the centre of the sitting room hardly daring to move, but he does dare to let his voice fade to nothing to see how Rosie will react. He lets out a relieved breath when he hears her soft, even breathing. She is asleep, her head resting against the front of his shoulder, her hair tickling the underside of his jaw.
“Fine, alright. Let me know how that shit works out for you; I can hook you up with more anytime you like. It’ll cost you a pretty penny, though,” Victor said with a wink. He sounded like he was under water.
“Great,” Sherlock chirped, and grabbed his coat from the hook by the door, tossing John’s to him in the process. A quick check of his coat pockets found everything he needed, and he made for the door, but when he turned around, John wasn’t behind him. “John?” he called out, fingers twitching against the doorknob as he itched to get to Lestrade’s squad car.
The question almost took John by surprise, but he grinned and glanced up at the detective. “Well, maybe you’ll get lucky and you’ll get a chance to find out tonight,” he teased, the statement sounding unusually and unfairly flirtatious.
Breath caught in his throat, Sherlock didn’t hesitate in putting an arm over John’s shoulder the moment he was stood upright again, fingers moving to tangle themselves in the golden locks at the nape of his neck. The movement earned a pleased hum from the shorter man, who tightened his grasp on Sherlock’s hips and pulled - more of a suggestion than a demand, which Sherlock followed without question - until their fronts were pressed nearly flush against each other.
He took a step forward, acting as though he wasn’t heeding Pavel’s warning. The large man gave an apathetic snort, and pulled the trigger.
“What?” When Sherlock looked back up to the sound of John’s voice, the man’s expression had morphed into something crestfallen and perplexed. “Why?” The way John immediately rose to his defense made Sherlock’s chest ache. He found himself, for once, hating the fact that he was moments away from scaring someone else off.
Anxious at the prospect of what the bad news could be, Sherlock pulled his lips between his teeth as he scrolled to read the next text.
A quick check of the chamber assured John that the gun was fully-loaded, and as he closed the nightstand drawer and reached back to tuck the handgun into the back of his waistband and under his oatmeal jumper where it nestled comfortably and safely against the small of his back before finally heading out the door, the feelings of helplessness and brooding thoughts of a loud bang followed by nothingness, were replaced by adrenaline, and fantastical visions of tailing a fantastical man in a dark coat through the dimly-lit London streets.
The look on John’s face when he looked back at him was carefully neutral as he slowly raised his beer to his mouth. “Do you have a boyfriend?”
John giggled, the sound warm as his eyes pinched momentarily shut. He turned his head to find Sherlock smiling amusedly back at him. “There’s my genius,” he cooed, turning to face Sherlock fully, taking a step forward, and pushing up on his toes to place a quick peck to the man’s cheek. He pulled back, intending to turn and head to the sitting room, but was surprised when Sherlock’s head followed him, the man leaning down to catch John’s lips in a sweet kiss.
“You’re bloody brilliant. Have I told you that?” John asked with a slight chuckle as he came up to stand next to Sherlock.
What? John frowned at the television screen, which had shifted to a video feed of construction workers on the side of the road, traffic crawling sluggishly by, while the voice of the news anchor carried on suggesting alternate traffic routes for drivers and advising people leave for work early in the days to come. There hadn’t been a single mention of Sherlock. Though, John thought to himself, the television coverage was never terribly detailed, and perhaps Sherlock’s role was simply confirming the cause of death; which he had asked John about. That was something any trained forensic pathologist doing an autopsy could have identified once the body was transported to a morgue, anyhow. Still, John was sure that everyone who had a role in the solving of the crime, no matter how small their contribution may have been, received some form of credit. Maybe it was on the website.
Mycroft had called him late Saturday evening, whilst he was at the crime scene at Blessington’s café with John, conveniently letting him know the last known locations of the Russian brothers, and he’d run off without another word to John, Lestrade, or anyone else.
John barely had time to turn and watch him enter the room, and looked just in time to see the young man drop inelegantly into one of the chairs, sinking in and making himself right at home. The doctor looked back at Greg, who merely rolled his eyes and turned to the receptionists desk to chat with Rachel, and John decided he’d leave them to it. He had a client to attend to.
And it seemed to go over well, if the twitch at the corner of Sherlock’s lips was anything to go by; even if it was accompanied by a roll of his eyes. “Morphine isn’t cocaine. And you weren’t on it for over four years.”
“Yeah, Harlow helped him load the cache this morning. It’s all floating east down the Thames in another boat as we speak,” the first voice said, pride oozing from his words. “They'll hook up with Tate further down and he’ll take it across the English Channel. And we’ll take the same route tonight, meet up with Tate, he’ll ship us over – and then it’s a straight shot from there to the docks where lovely old
“Just give it a chance, Sherlock,” the brunette woman sighed, her slim, bared shoulders slumping exaggeratedly. “Spend thirty minutes with me at this party. When that time is up, if you’re absolutely
With his post-work routine finished, John shed his jacket to place over the back of his desk chair and made his way to his bed, sitting down with a soft groan of relief and toeing off his shoes, kicking them off to the side once removed. The bed under him wasn’t extraordinarily comfortable; it didn’t give much support, the sheets were low thread count, the duvet being one John had used throughout university and had put away in a storage unit when he’d gone to war. But John didn’t mind - it was better than his cot in Afghanistan by a long-shot, so he was by no means complaining.
“Go on,” he said, shooing John away, and John laughed as he opened the shower door to step out onto the bath mat that sat waiting on the floor.
Even though it was a reused line, hearing Sherlock say it in person, with every inflection of his low-pitched voice there to be heard, made John’s stomach do flips. And then he realised, belatedly, that he shouldn’t be blushing and worrying about potential flirting whilst leaning over a dead body.
When met with John’s befuddled expression, Sherlock chuckled lowly before having mercy on the man and holding out his mobile for John to see the screen. The doctor squinted at the small series of digits and numbers.
“Perhaps I shouldn’t elaborate any further," the brunette decided. "As it is, it looks as though you’re about to faint, and I actually feel much better working on this case with you nearby. So in the interest of preserving what professionalism is left-”
It was a dressing gown of lush crimson, the fabric light and soft between John’s fingertips. He smiled as he took it off of the hook on the back of the door and wrapped it around himself, the sleeves roomy enough to allow for both John’s hand and the water bottle it held to slip through effortlessly. He had to forego the bottle, though, to tie the silky ribbon round his waist. As he turned to replace the bottle on the nightstand, he espied a long, slender rapier mounted to the wall next to the bed. Frowning in bewilderment, he ambled over to inspect it more closely, staring in some amount of wonder at the extravagant silver cage hilt before reading the small, silver plaque underneath the sword. It was for a first-place win at the ‘
“Which reminds me,” the older man continued, looking off to the side, back towards the warehouses, “what happened to the others? The three guys who ran?”
“You’ve got my cigarettes in your clutch, haven’t you?” Sherlock asked as he and Irene made their way down the dimly-lit sidewalk. God knew
Five minutes later, John was patting his face, freshly-washed and freshly-shaved, dry. He’d stripped off his jeans and stood at the sink in his boxers, his toothbrush replaced in its designated cup after he’d brushed his teeth, and all bloody remnants of the evening had been washed down the drain. John stood, leaning over the sink, a tentative finger gingerly prodding at the tender skin around the bridge of his nose as Sherlock turned off the shower tap and opened the curtain.
“What-” Sherlock shook his head, but felt nauseous and decided he should not be shaking his head. “Yeah, yes, fine,” he said, and pushed himself off of the wall, and valiantly tried not to stumble. Victor looked giddy. “Whatever. Just- give me some coke for the road. I’ve got to go.”
The chatter continued as the men carried on milling about the space on the other side of the stack of wooden flats, and John was about to suggest Sherlock contact Lestrade before it was too late, when he looked over and saw the detective's face illuminated by the soft, blueish-white glow of his mobile, thumbs ungloved and flying across the screen. When the man sent off the message he’d typed out, he looked back up to meet John’s eyes, and his lips silently formed around the name;
, he siphons through glass slides to show her the cuticle, cortex, and medulla of a single strand of John’s hair
Until then, all my love and my sincerest thanks to you all. And if you'd like a little something to tide you over until then, if you're at all interested, I whipped up a little 3 chapter, 21,700 word something called Allhallows' Affair for the Halloween holiday that I'm pretty proud of. Go and give it a read, if you'd like!
“Mm. That’s… nice of you,” John returned, doing his best not to let on just how fucking confused he was.
“Younger than thirty years old,” Sherlock dismissed with an irritated flick of one wrist in the air, “and yet you are apparently less adept at using technology than my
“Who says I trust him?” John asked, perhaps a little too quickly, feeling something in his chest tighten.
reason for that rope to have been there - it’s also a new rope, you can tell by the quality. So he would have had to have gone out and bought it specifically for this, because his belt certainly wasn’t going to support his weight. So, who plans a holiday, packs their luggage, takes it to their car, and then goes and buys a rope thick enough for the job, and then hangs himself in his office?”
The open floor plan of the small studio perfectly represented him - he was a simple man who took comfort in a certain minimalist, orderly way of living. And while he was single, a one-room living situation such as this suited his bachelor lifestyle just fine.
A look around revealed that he was in some sort of warehouse. Lit enough for John to be certain there wasn’t anything threatening lurking in the shadows. A potential exit behind him from where the car had pulled in; the large door hadn’t been closed, and the rain that fell steadily outside was daunting, but he’d rather face that than die in this fucking place. The only other door was a regular-sized one that was in front of him, but was blocked by a lone figure, standing casually with one foot crossed over the other, weight distributed between his feet and the umbrella propped on the floor beside him. After taking a fortifying breath, John dared to approach.
Abandoning the crushed beer can on the edge of the sidewalk, John raised his hand, which held another beer can, to his lips. He’d made Mary agree to stop by his dorm to grab a few beers for his own pre-game ritual, and was close to finishing his third and final bevvy as they rounded the corner and started down a street lined with houses. It was a decent neighbourhood that was filled with university frat houses, so loud parties were almost never reported as a nuisance. The party they were attending was hosted by someone John wasn’t incredibly familiar with, but one of his best mates, Greg Lestrade, was a newly-initiated member of the fraternity and had therefore extended an invitation to John, and by extension, to Mary.
John’s eyes widened slightly and he glanced around, as if someone was near them who would hear. “Yes,” he replied, though softer in his tone. “Fully-loaded.”
It doesn’t sound like a suitable trade-off at all, according to Rosie, who weeps loudly in response.
“Lestraaaaade!” he yelled, drawing out the man’s name in a frustrated whine, “call your bloody dogs off, please!”
“No,” John responded casually, earning a guarded, yet somewhat surprised look from Sherlock. “I mean, this is just an intake. I don’t want to go pushing you too quickly, here. I hardly know you, you don’t know me – not really my place to go telling you what to do,” he shrugged.
Sighing, John peeled the blue, plastic monstrosity off of himself and tossed it into the giant bin along the brick wall. Then, at a loss for what to do with himself, he ambled out of the lot and off towards the way he and Sherlock had come in, staying close to the buildings and steadfastly avoiding Sally Donovan and that Anderson character, who were talking to each other and looking at him indiscreetly from where they stood by a police cruiser a fair distance away.
After another minute of watching Sherlock prod at the body (though he was looking at rather odd things; the bottoms of his shoes, up his trouser leg, under his collar, at his belt, at the length of rope at the ceiling and the length around his neck, up his shirt sleeve), Lestrade heaved a sigh and shifted impatiently on his feet.
To wrap up, I'd just like to say thank you again for all of your support. You all mean the world and more. Sorry again for the hiatus; shit just happens, I guess. Hope to see you all back here soon.
“Another drink?” John asked, backing away, and Sherlock was forced to drop his hands from the man’s jacket. When his vision somewhat cleared, he watched the blond moving towards the water cooler on the other side of the small room. When he’d gotten his bearings back enough to respond, he swallowed thickly and, deciding against nodding his head for fear he would upset his already precarious balance, opted for a verbal response.
Sherlock blinked once, twice, and then his brow creased with confusion as he looked to his side at John, expression carefully guarded. He was met with a face so open and earnest in its awe, he nearly forgot how to breathe. “Sorry?” he managed to croak out.
“That was, um.” John huffed a gentle laugh and hastily unclenched his hands from Sherlock’s coat when he realised he was still gripping it. “That was probably bad timing.”
Second chapter coming this evening to wrap up this all-important holiday! Thank you so very much for reading! Your feedback as readers is paramount, so please, don't hesitate to let me know what you think. Thanks again, and I'll see you back here soon!
Sherlock scoffed. “Hardly,” he murmured, and turned around to see a young boy in rather tattered clothing, face marred with a smudge of dirt, ratty, dirty blond hair shoulder length and looking in desperate need of a wash, sitting on the bottom step of the pagoda with a cup in his small hands. Giving a small smile, Sherlock made his way down the first few steps, and hopped down the last two, and ignored John’s curious eyes as he approached the young boy.
“But the view is so nice,” he crooned, and let out a yelp when Sherlock swatted at him with the towel, both of them dissolving into giggles.
He avoided looking at himself directly in the mirror, knowing what he’d find if he happened to glance; bones, draped in skin marred from years of neglect, drug abuse, and the occasional scuffle while fighting crime. Instead, he took a towel from the rung on the wall and hastily dried off his limbs and torso before rubbing it through his thick curls, which sprung back to life once relieved from most of the moisture. Sherlock made quick work of brushing his teeth while he pulled on his pants and struggled into his jeans - which were more difficult to put on than he’d anticipated due to his being freshly out of the shower - and he finally pulled on his socks before rinsing out his mouth, setting his toothbrush on the sink, and exiting the bathroom with his shirt in his hands.
Sherlock just rolled his eyes. “You’ve got a mild limp that is almost assuredly psychosomatic, an intermittent tremor, and PTSD. Of course you’ve got a therapist,” he drawled, sounding incredibly, impossibly bored. “You know, this is hardly ideal, seeing a therapist who’s got
“You two,” he said, looking between the pair, arms crossing over his chest, “are going to be the death of me, aren’t you?”
A huff of air in lieu of a laugh left Sherlock’s nose in a rush as he looked back down at the table in front of him. John walked past him to do something unseen in the sitting room/bedroom behind Sherlock’s back. “I believe I’m in the best hands, Doctor,” he murmured with a gentle smile, loud enough for John to hear, and he was met with a soft hum of acknowledgement.
During lunch, Mike looked at John worriedly, who wasn't touching his food and was silent, too silent. His eyes were fixed in a dead point and he was pale, he didn't look fine. "Hey John! Are you alright mate?"
Sherlock tilted his head to the left, “the buildings aren’t straight and the perspective is completely misplaced. How did you expect me to find out what it was?”
Sherlock didn't say anything, he stopped looking at her and turned his head back to the window at the same moment she started talking about the fall. He still felt guilty, it wasn't enough to know John had forgiven him, he wondered, how was it even possible that he wanted to be his friend after everything he had done? He had been a terrible friend. But friends protect each other don't they? He was protecting John, of course he was, wasn't he? Everything Harry was saying to him was proving otherwise. John had never been more unhappy and it had been because of him.
John looked at Sherlock, who wasn't paying attention anymore. He couldn't help but smile. "Shut up Harry!"
And the first thing Sherlock did after reading it was leaving on his own and working on the case by himself. John would get angry. Really, really angry.
Once again, I can't thank you enough for all your incredible support and your love and loyalty towards this fic. Your comments and kudos have been like a therapy to me after all the grief we've been through. These past weeks haven't been easy at all but you've made it all better (is it possible to lacuna s4 of Sherlock? I wish it was). Lots of love to you! x
When dinner was over, Sherlock offered to wash the dishes but Mr Watson said sharply. "No. Harriet will wash them."
Greg smiled, leaned back in his chair and nodded. Sherlock spent the rest of the lunchtime in silence thinking about John. No. Thinking about the party he was going to.
John shook his head, not knowing what else to say. All of this situation was unbelievable and stupid.
John gave her a reassuring smile and shook his head. "No, no, mom. I just... I'm tired and you held me very tight and that's all..."
There is an interlude now 'cause this is getting rather long! (which I love it). But anyway, this chapter is here to give you a context in order to understand better the story and what will happen from then on. No need to read it if you don't feel like it, but it's very very recommended.
“Can I see our grade?”Sherlock repeated in an even lower tone, making it almost impossible for John to hear.
Time seemed to pass slower and slower, but at least his sister was happy and that was enough. But he missed Sherlock. God, how did he let this happen? When did this happen? When did Sherlock become such a huge part of his life, if not all of it? He realized it had been since the very beginning. Yes, he had changed since the moment he met Sherlock Holmes, everything had changed, hadn't it? He was happy, he lived now a crazy and ridiculous life, but a life that deserved to be lived. He embraced the adventure, and now he couldn't live a single day without it, without Sherlock. This was getting out of his hands. But he realized it already had a long time ago.
He had spent 8 days in the hospital, refusing most of the food, not getting much sleep and wondering most of the time about John, trying to control the tremors and the sweating while pretending that
The ride in the car seemed endless. Sherlock's mind couldn't stop turning. Was all of this a coincidence? Or were all those victims linked to each other? Was Lacuna in any way responsible for this? Was John in danger?
Since Clara and Harry broke up, Harry stopped spending as much time with the greasers as she used to. Sherlock had to say he felt a bit relieved because he wasn't sure he would be able to look at Harry, lest of it all sitting in the same table as her.
John realized that Sherlock was looking at him expectantly and he hadn't answered yet. The greaser let out a sigh. "Look, I told you I
“No”, John said shaking his head. “No matter how good you are, you’ll never be better than Vincent Van Gogh.”
John was looking down when they entered to the room. Melissa recognized him from the picture on his blog and that man didn't look like the picture at all. He was skinnier, had huge bags under his eyes, looked pale... He turned to stare at them and she lifted her hand awkwardly. "Hello."
"Well, that went... Surprisingly well." John said with a smile. He grabbed Sherlock's hand. "Thank you, I know it took a lot of effort from you to not be yourself." He placed a kiss on Sherlock's hand.
“Oh?”, John said, feeling warm. “Thank you”. He considered for a time and then he whispered, “you were planning on doing this”.
The bell rang. Lunch time was over. John and Sherlock stood up, John looked at Sherlock and smiled weakly, but didn't make eye contact with him, he just couldn't stand looking at him. he just kept looking down, Sherlock instead was looking fixedly into John's eyes. "Thank you, hm... For everything. And I just don't mean now. Just... Thank you."
He took a quick shower, (reluctantly) ate his sandwich, and walked out. Only one destination in mind: Lacuna.
But I can't stay in the past, I can't mourn it forever. Sometimes I dream about certain things we lived together but the memories are too blurry. Sherlock tells me some of the stories, but he's not a very good storyteller, he only remembers the gory details or the clues that made him find out that the single woman with the three dogs was the one who killed her neighbor, so in the end it's not very enlightening. But listening to our stories brings me back to life, and even though it hurts and it makes me terribly angry, it also heals me. Heals us.
Well it was about to become more embarrassing, because a doctor came upstairs with a small smile on his face and all John could think about was why nobody was taking the case seriously instead of wasting time laughing about the fact his mother was looking for him. "Which one of you is John Watson?" The man said looking at them both.
She left the apartment and went downstairs, into the street. Sherlock went to the window and looked at her. She looked worried, as if bad news had been given to her. Generally, he would be able to tell what a person was talking about but he simply couldn't with her. Things were so much harder with her. Still, nothing.
He was walking with the books, barely looking at the path, when he felt his walk stopped suddenly because he had hit something. Or someone. He lowered the books and saw a taller young man he had never seen before. His hair messy, his jeans, his white t-shirt, and his black leather jacket. Great, just what this school needed. Another greaser. The boy looked at him with a frown. "Mm... Sorry."
said the smartest boy in the school. He smiled and just as he did, the bell rang. "Shit, I can't be late for history. Thank you, Harry." He said turning.
Tell me all the dirty details! I want to hear all of them! Well, maybe not everything, but yes, everything!" -She laughed.
Mrs Hudson came to Sherlock's laboratory a minute later. "Oh, did John leave? I was going to invite him to have dinner with us"
He couldn’t explain why the thought of Sherlock came into his mind so commonly lately. Well, he could explain it, but he didn’t want to. Deep down inside, he knew quite well that he was slowly -or maybe not so slowly- falling in love with Sherlock Holmes. And he wasn’t doing anything to avoid it. He didn’t want to avoid it. Even though he knew it wasn’t actually going to happen. Still, he liked thinking about Sherlock, he liked how his brain seemed to wake up and fill itself with creativity when the artist appeared in his mind.
"Don't worry, I'll find it out by myself, thank you very much." She said handing Sherlock her cup and standing up, then she turned and touched his face. "Sherlock. Dear, dear Sherlock. You won't escape that easily. This is not over. I'm warning you."
John bit his lip thoughtfully. “I don’t know, Sherlock. I mean, last night I was able to do it because I just had to choose the colors and paint, but now I have nothing: no clear idea in mind, anything.”
Sherlock sat on his bed and patted John to sit in there and John's heart was threatening to get out of his chest. "Take a seat."
Once John had sit on the couch, Sherlock put his arms behind his back and started talking as he paced the living room, unable to stand still, because if he did, he was certain his buckling knees would give him away.
Friendly reminder that comments are vicious motivators for me to keep writing and updating faster so please leave something telling me what you've thought of the story or whatever else you'd like to say, I love reading them! ;)
"My parents travel around the world and they used to take me with them. It's not like I wanted to, but I was forced to. As soon as I turned 16 I told them I could do what I wanted and they left me here with my brother. Not very exciting, but better than living across the globe."
was a boy? No. He had a reputation to take care of. And if they found out, they would hurt John too. Of course, it was the best choice. How come he didn't realize he needed Irene's help?
Sherlock smiled back at him, his face pulling itself into that same expression it had made minutes ago, as if he wanted to read and comprehend something he didn’t quite understand.
He walked out of the Tate Modern, stepping over the crack on the floor. He rushed towards Baker Street.
John took the "what happened once might had never happened at all" thing from The Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundera. That passage is based on a German adage.
Oh of course, he had been buying time. While he contorted with pain he managed to break himself free from the rope tied around his hands. Brilliant John.
John's face did a weird expression, very akin to a pout but then he nodded. Suddenly he turned to look at the stove and exclaimed, "shit! The pasta!"
Apologies for the delay, I've been quite busy at uni, and I've really tried to take some time to keep writing but sometimes it's just impossible. Lots of love! x
are always unpredictable. I can never figure you out, as much as I've tried. And I don't know wether if I like not knowing or I don't, but you are a mystery to me. And that puzzles me and fascinates me at the same time."
Her smile widened and she leaned even closer to Sherlock. And Sherlock realized he didn't like when people did that unless that people were
He realized there was nothing he could do against it. He had to wake up. Time to go back to reality...
I got a bit too obsessed with the idea and I investigated more on the matter and found that there had been a real case, very similar to this one. Turns out in 1953, during the Cold War, the CIA designed a project called MK-Ultra, in which they tested the use of LSD as a way to control people's minds and cause them terror, paranoia, and avoid deviations, such as homosexuality. The project advanced throughout the 1950's, supported by the American Government. I thought it fitted perfectly into our storyline and adjusted it a bit just so it could work for England's intelligence as well.
"Oh please John, I know you since you were a baby, don't lie to me, you are desperate to go to Sherlock's room and stop whatever thing they are doing!"
John, staring at him, looking worried. Sherlock turning to look at him and seeing the creases in John forehead easing down.
Irene was there too. They haven't talked to one another since their 'break-up', but she seemed to be fine with him. Sometimes he would catch her sight and she would wink an eye to him while Greg eyed them suspiciously.
The place was unreal and it was huge: there were three microscopes, papers scattered all around the table, the walls were filled with books everywhere, so many books. Right next to the pile of papers, there was the typewriter. When John reacted, he turned to look at Sherlock, who was turning his back to him, sitting in a chair. "Is this... All yours?"
Sherlock stood still, mouth agape, before he realized that a reply was expected from him. He blinked and closed his mouth. “I- just…”
He chose a dark background. He mixed dark brown with small, soft brushstrokes of light brown in order to give some texture and dimension to it, for the skin he chose a subtle tone of pink and mixed it with a bit of bronze, thinking a bit about John’s tanned skin, touched by the sun and the sand and the desert and the pain and the scars and creating an imperfect yet beautiful tone.
"I know, I'm a bloody doctor!" John snapped angrily. He reached the newspaper and read the article once again. Well, things seemed to make sense for now. Except for... "What the hell happened on that rooftop?" John asked curiously.
He didn't know what he was saying, his brain wasn't registering any words, he didn't know if Melissa had allies that were looking for them or if it was someone to help them, he screamed and screamed and screamed at the top of his lungs, perhaps it would bring Sherlock back to consciousness.
as long as I'm able to see you again, to talk to you once more. That's what I want. You. In any way you want me."
The painting Sherlock saw when he was a kid is An Experiment on A Bird in the Air Pump by Joseph Wright of Derby. The painting does make part of the National Gallery in London!
The quote of "The curves of your lips rewrite history" is taken from The Picture of Dorian Gray (my god I keep referencing that novel all the time! Damn you and your precious writing, Oscar Wilde!)
Sherlock looked around. The whole place was filled with candles and the smell of food was everywhere and it was perfect.
"Yes, Melissa. About the man who just arrived, I think I'll proceed right now, I need you to cancel today's appointments."
Sherlock stood quiet for another long time, so John took a book and opened it. He was starting to read, when Sherlock's voice took him by surprise.
"No, no, it's okay, really. I'll go and take these ones to the locker and look for the classroom so I don't get late!"
Slowly, Sherlock laid on the bed and pulled John with him. John smiled as he kissed Sherlock's lips, over and over. He straddled Sherlock's thighs with his legs. Sherlock held him by the back, kissing him back just as eagerly.
wasn't the first gunshot. From the state of the blood, I think she died before that time. I'd say about two p.m."
He grabbed his keys and walked towards the Tate Modern. It was one of his favorite places in the world, and he had to admit that seeing his painting might be able to help him…in some way. Or it might make it all worse, who knew, he’d find it out in a couple of minutes.
He knew who she was and yet on theory he wasn’t supposed to get in touch with anyone who worked on Lacuna.
John kept his eyes fixed on the road. It took all his will not to turn and look at the greaser. He simply shook his head. "Next time you say that, I
The greaser leaned closer to Victor and could see his pupils dilated, he retreated seriously. “How many pills have you taken today, Victor?”
"Fine, fine." John said nodding. He realized it was better not contradicting Sherlock, because that would end in a useless discussion which the greaser would undoubtedly always win.
Maybe he should just follow his therapist's advice and write on his blog once again. He stared at the last post, from over a year ago: "He was my best friend and I'll always believe in him."
Lestrade remembered Sherlock had asked him something but, in the midst of the shock he had completely forgotten about it. Oh yes, Sherlock had asked him which was his division.
Sherlock dragged a deep breath, as if he had just come out of drowning in the water. The air hurt his nostrils and his throat. He had thought about it a thousand times before, but it had never seemed so unavoidable, so irreversible. The truth hit him like a train on full speed, a deafening sound in his ears:
"I'm still wondering-", John said while he placed himself under the covers. "What are you doing here?"
“From the photograph”, Sherlock said, finally turning and fixing those eyes on John’s. John felt all the air leaving his lungs as soon as he saw Sherlock. He had been
“-the thing is that Ivory black takes far too long to dry and I tend to be very careful when I use white or black in my paintings because they take the vivacity out of the colors they’re mixed with. So I only use them when it’s strictly necessary-”
And in that moment, the old man arrived to class, two minutes late, which was very weird coming from him. John sat immediately and, surprisingly, Sherlock didn't bother him at all. Now they had to do that damn job and they were going to do it so good the rest of the work pairs would be jealous of them.
John's last post on his blog said he'd always believe in him, but sometimes Sherlock doubted whether he really did. Why didn't he want to write this case on his blog, then?
John threw his head back and sighed. "Alright then". He looked hesitantly around the flat. The question was in his lips and honestly, Sherlock was wondering the same.
His mouth was closed. He hadn’t said it. Thank God he hadn’t, he had embarrassed himself enough. He felt the need to say something anyway.
The police car stopped in front of a tall building, all painted in white. Lestrade got out of it with a frown, the building didn't have a signal with its name and Lestrade couldn't recall even seeing it before. Hidden in plain sight.
"I don't know Mike. I don't even know if I like it or not. I just feel like I lost all the motivation I ever had and I can't get it back" he said playing with his food hesitantly, not looking at Mike but not looking across from him, to the popular table, and not towards the door, where Sherlock was, maybe waiting for him? No. Of course not.
"Stop thinking about it! Think of something else and for God's sake, don't you even dare to stand up from that chair because I know exactly what you will do!"
He was slow on the canvas. His hand wasn’t shaking. He moved his hand surely, with strokes that were too short and loaded with paint, so each stroke had its own texture, its own shape, its own intention. It was kind of fascinating. Sherlock couldn’t help but associate it with Van Gogh’s painting at the Tate, and he could really tell that John based his whole technique on post-impressionists, but he was giving it a complete shift to it: this wasn’t about landscapes any longer, this was about the human body, he was turning the human body into a colorful work of art.
They stood still in a slightly uncomfortable silence. Sherlock didn’t want to look at John because he was probably blushing from embarrassment and John was looking at his own painting while doing a weird expression Sherlock couldn’t put a name to. Finally, John broke the silence. “You haven’t answered my question.”
"Has it too", Sherlock said and his voice sounded weird, in a point between worried and deeply, terribly sad.
"I have to meet with Sherlock in order to work in our project." John said with a resigned face, which earned a chuckle from Mike.
His back was killing him. Sherlock felt that with every step each and every single one of his muscles protested, and so walking upstairs was far too difficult. John helped him as much as he could, allowing Sherlock to fully lean against him. Sherlock grimaced and hissed without even intending to. It was difficult, controlling his brain at the moment, when it all seemed blurry and he was dizzy and it all hurt.
A small folder was placed over the table in front of the sofa. Sherlock stopped and stared at it. He remembered Mycroft's text. It was obviously some boring file about someone or the archive about a murder because Mycroft thought he could solve anything with bribes.
He checked on his wound every day. He'd sit silently as he read or wrote, and he'd bring Sherlock some of the files of cold cases that Lestrade had left them. Sherlock would solve them in a matter of seconds, John would look at him fondly. He'd force him to eat, he'd bring him homemade tea (sneaked it in so the nurses wouldn’t notice), he'd leave in the night after placing a kiss on his forehead and caressing his right cheekbone softly.
He sighed and collapsed against the pillows. It was only logical, now that he thought about it. Of course John would want to spare himself from awkward talks and morning kisses, it was fine.
"Oh, John. You don't have to be a genius to know that your alcoholic father is decidedly not at home on a Saturday evening, do you?"
John was a bit too astounded by the warm hand on his arm and the playful smile on Sherlock's lips so he didn't protest, he just followed the greaser towards the seat. Finally when he wrapped his mind around all the things that had happened, he frowned. "What do you want?" He said, trying to keep his voice cold.
Harry pulled a more serious  face. "I've been told about you, Holmes. And I'm John's big sister so it's my job saying this and I've been told about you."
Greg stared at him for a moment and nodded as he grabbed his communicator. John was dimly aware of a group of people coming and taking Melissa's unconscious body away. He couldn't really process it, for his brain was too busy thinking about how much pressure should be applied and how much blood had been lost, while assessing the possible damage made to internal organs and calculating the probabilities of Sherlock surviving.
He felt something when he looked at it. It was as if the painting was trying to imitate happiness, and finding nothing but sorrow on the wake of it, it was a desperate attempt to show something, to stop being a shadow, but being a shadow anyway.
He had known that for a very long time, but John had made him feel as if he could win it, as if he was enough strong to defeat all the demons crawling inside his head.
As soon as they were inside of 221B, John’s eyes fixed on the same corner where he had seen Sherlock’s work in progress two days ago. It was finished now, and it was accompanied by other two works in progress, which brought just a little bit of color to the room.
“Fine, fine. Maybe that’s true, but I might want to put other body parts floating around in my paintings, wouldn’t I?”
Sherlock nodded, John grabbed his backpack and was about to leave when the greaser stood up and called him, louder than he intended to. "John!"
Mr Hikes answered looking very calm. "Nice try, Mr Holmes. But I don't believe in a single one of your words. Starting by the fact you are reading something that holds absolutely no relation to the topic we are discussing today."
Sherlock stared at the little traces in his arms. Scars that remained visible, as a constant remembrance to what he used to do, who he used to be. He hated looking at them, mostly because they were always accompanied by a sense of self-loathing that he couldn’t put a name into, and that only was forgotten by taking more drugs.
But there, in that moment when John didn’t have the faintest clue that Sherlock was there, when Irene openly confronted him about his feelings
“Oh. Erm- no”, John replied as he took his tongue out, just a little bit, without even realizing he had.
"Look, I'd love to let you stay in here but my parents wouldn't be so thrilled about a guy of their daughter's age staying overnight, people might talk."
Sherlock smiled weakly. "Yes... We realized we were being silly and there was no reason at all for us not being together."
He had huge bags under his eyes and couldn't seem to focus at all in the classes, he couldn't stop thinking about the murder. Well, that and Sherlock. He was certainly worried about Sherlock. What the hell was he doing with the police? Was he working with them? Why? This didn't sound like something Sherlock would do, was it? John felt he didn't know him at all.
John looked at him with a smile. "Goodbye Sherlock, please, please, please, be careful. No drugs, no smoking, no drinking, nothing!"
John looked at Sherlock for a moment in which he wasn't able to say anything, all he wanted to do was look at him forever and keep holding those cold, long hands, but then he remembered, "
He felt two hands grabbing him strongly, holding him by the forearms. He opened his eyes to find Sherlock staring at him worriedly, a frown in his face. Sherlock. Brilliant colorful beautiful Sherlock.
He walked with Sherlock towards the door, they picked up their coats and walked outside, as soon as they did Sherlock raised an arm and a cab stopped immediately. How on earth did he do that?
Hi lovelies...here's a tiny ray of hope to make these shitty days slightly better. I'm sorry for everything we've been through. I can assure you that this little one will have an unambiguously happy ending, I'll try to avoid poor shitty writing ('no loose ends on my watch and I do mean that!), it won't have weak, forced, cruel 'I love you' scenes, and John and Sherlock will end up together, without the ghost of wives past. I know this can't fill into the void all this shit has left in our hearts but it's a start. I love you all and I'm endlessly thankful for your support. You guys are incredible and have motivated me to keep on after all the shit we've had to handle. Take care and never give up on hope, ever.
"John, it's just five! Come on, I'm having a lot of fun!". He wondered how could she be having fun, if he was such a lousy company.
But Sherlock could affirm he knew John, at least a bit, and he could tell John was anxious, if his hand was anything to go by.
Sherlock sighed and closed his eyes, feeling tired. His head was spinning with too many ideas at the same time, and he’d been ignoring the nagging, horrible feeling that reminded him that Isabella was the last person who’d been killed and that Isabella started with an I and that the letter that followed the I was the J.
John spent the whole weekend working very hard on the history project, mostly because he wanted to prove Sherlock that he could do well without him. On Monday he would just hand Sherlock the work and he would have to pass it on the typewriter, and that would be it. They didn't need to talk to each other. Which was good. Wasn't it?
"I did. I just don't want to reply. I just don't. So I'll shake the erasers instead and shut up and so will you."
"No? Okay, just suggesting, I thought we could ask Molly if she could recommend us some books or some chemists to look at..."
Jim leaned closer and kept his eyes fixed on the greaser. "Oh yes, of course you do, if you want to be
John looked away but Sherlock had seen, he had seen all the thoughts going through John’s mind, John could tell. Sherlock put the charcoal over the desk and stood up, looking around and tugging at his sleeve slightly, as if he was covering himself up with a little touch of perfection, hiding his damage from plain sight.
Sherlock stood silent and looked down. He wasn't going to answer. John knew it. He snorted. "You know what? I don't want to know. I have more important things to think about." He said looking somewhere else except facing Sherlock.
He wondered if Sherlock had taken them again, if he craved them, if he needed someone to talk to, if he felt lonely, if he missed him, if he-
to be reading, John couldn't be quite sure. He stood there, looking at him and thinking how it was possible that something that seemed so good, so legit, so wonderful, could end so abruptly and then act as if nothing happened. It wasn't fair. He hated that, and he wanted to hate Sherlock for it. But he couldn't, he simply couldn't.
He stood silent. He knew himself and he knew perfectly well that if he didn’t ignore her he would probably end up killing her for what she was saying about John.
It was a futuristic artwork, and John loved the way the shapes managed to express the motion and the need to go on and on and on and move faster that somehow came from the mix of colors and traces. It was incredible, the way stillness created movement.
Sherlock sighed and closed his eyes, wishing he could have known how many days hours minutes and seconds had passed until he saw John again.
"What?" Sherlock asked confused, his mind too tangled in the conversation to understand what Victor was referring to.
“The light reflected on the right side of your back, lighting the color of you dressing gown. The bow held high and the pressure of your fingers over the strings. It was as if your body and the bow were forming a diagonal that contrasted with the shape of the window. It was brilliant.”
During lunch John did hang out with Mike and his group of friends. They were nice and they talked to him, but he didn't feel right, he just felt like he didn't fit in at all, and he hated that. He wanted to feel like part of the group, but he simply couldn't. He assumed that it was just his personality, the way he was, and he could do nothing to change it, so as lunch passed by, John counted the minutes till he could go join the chemistry club, not that he was a fan of it, but he was starting to consider being a doctor as a possibility and he had to know some chemistry if he wanted to do right at college.
"Who the hell do I think I am?" Sherlock asked confused, his voice raising as well. "What is wrong with you, John?"
He felt a pair of arms crossing around his back. The same back that had taken the incessant whipping that seemed to extend itself infinitely as it reached through every single muscle in his body, was now hosting the warmth of John’s arms. He couldn’t do anything. After years of carrying that weight, he didn’t know how to move his arms anymore, how to breathe, how to live in a world where John Watson had actually forgiven him.
John looked down. He felt embarrassed from being caught looking at Sherlock’s marks, but he kept thinking about it, wondering why Sherlock did it. He was a genius, how did drugs help?
Sherlock's face lit up and he stared at John, trying to process what was going through his mind. Was it real? Did somebody actually believe in him? How was that even possible? But John had said exactly what Sherlock needed to hear. He suddenly felt strong, unbeatable, invincible. He smiled at John. "If he's alive, he is going to regret it."
But it made sense somehow. With that clue, John was able to put the pieces together: his parents didn't care about him, so he looked for a shelter somewhere else, and he found it in Victor, and then he somehow tried drugs, and that was his way of channeling the pain, and then he got lost: Victor and drugs and pain, all of those addictions looking for a way out. And Sherlock was only
Sherlock reached with shaky hands and opened John's trousers, trying to unzip them as fast as he could because he knew the chance would be over before he knew it. He tucked his hand inside of John's pants and grasped at John's cock.
And in five minutes the place was half-empty. Sherlock stood up and found Greg at the backyard. "Let's go."
"Someday you will understand the only reason I do this is because I care about you, dear brother. Now tell me, what is the nature of your relationship with John Watson?"
"Terrible, as usual." Sherlock said as he stared his friends in an incredibly serious gaze, which later turned into a confused one, when they all laughed. He wasn't telling a joke. It was true. History was a torture for him. John looked at him from afar and smiled a bit.
John’s hair and John’s clothes were damp. Sherlock realized until then that it had been raining outside, not just a drizzle, but a heavy rainstorm. He frowned and looked at his phone, for how long had he been looking at the samples? It was 3 in the morning. He had been there for a long time, then.
. Where do you think you're going? We need help with this case! Lestrade looked really annoyed, and clueless, and desperate to solve the case.
And that was a kind of feeling Sherlock didn't even know how to express. It was an unusual kind of happiness and peace, a kind of happiness that is not expressed with a smile, but with a feeling deep inside that is as if all your organs had found a balance, as if the world was slightly more bearable and the sky slightly more beautiful. It was a kind of happiness that was far too big and too massive to embrace with a simple smile.
He reacted fast enough to grab Sherlock by the wrist, stopping him. "Oh no, you are not going anywhere."
"I don't know, you are the only one I have." Sherlock said so innocently, looking so honest, so truthful, that John felt the need to hold him, to hug him, to touch him. But no.
"It's good to see you too, thank you." Sherlock walked in and didn't close the door on his face, which Greg took as a hint to walk in behind him. "Were you expecting someone?" Greg said, taking a look around the flat. It had been so much since he last walked in that door and he thought he never would again.
. It's a battle against yourself. A battle you'll lose one way or another. So don't think she just goes around looking for trouble. She
John nodded again and looked down. An uncomfortable silence feel between them. Greg knew that leaving Sherlock aside, they didn't have much to talk about. This was turning far too awkward, so Greg did the only thing he could and spoke again. "...Just, some murders. Missing people, you know, the usual." He said as if he never had stopped talking.
He frowned and leaned closer to take a better look at it. Curiosity got the best out of him and he grabbed it, while Sarah stood frozen and silent.
As John talked, a thought occurred to Sherlock. An impossible thought that still made doubt creep into his mind. No matter how he tried he couldn’t get rid of it and he didn’t want to check it for himself but he had to.
“It does wonders to your ego to see worse artists than you. This place motivates me to keep doing what I do, because no matter what, it’ll always be better than this.”
Sherlock threw her a killing gaze. "Don't you dare, Irene. Don't you dare to say one single fucking thing about John Watson!"
John threw him a small smile but couldn't come up with a proper reply. He didn't know what to say. He just shrugged and walked back to the cafeteria. He was still not hungry, but at least he was distracted.
"How could you? Do you have any idea of what you've done? They're never coming back, my memories. They never will. Was that part of your 'magic trick' as well? Is this another one of your stupid games? Is it all a bloody game to you?"
John shook his head and followed him. Before they entered to the room where the wife had been murdered, John grabbed Sherlock's arm and turned him so he could face him. "Sherlock. What do you want me to do?"
"I'm sorry, Harry." John said, because he really couldn't think of anything else to say. Right now, he wasn't the best one to give love advice.
They were both close, their thrusting turning frantic and erratic and messy and incredibly perfect. "Yes. Yes, Sherlock", John whispered without even realizing he was. "Come for me, love."
"There has to- there has to be a unifying factor between one and the other. It can't be a coincidence, the universe is rarely so lazy. So, what's the link between Alice and the rest of the victims? There has to be a link Lestrade!"
“See?”, Sherlock said, his hands still over John’s shoulders. “Before you even begin to grab a pencil, you have got to have the idea on your mind. Focus on what you want to sketch. Your forearms? Your torso? The scar in your shoulder?”
"Aren't you going to give me your name?" She said putting her hand down as she realized Sherlock wasn't going to respond.
"No, let me talk." John said to Sherlock. "I'm exhausted Harry! I'm tired of all this! You tried quitting alcohol and you ended up taking drugs. Fantastic. Great improvement. I'm so proud of you", he said mockingly.
And he’d have to make peace with it. Get used to it. He had a lifetime of losses, another one wouldn’t kill him.
"Was he looking for revenge?", it was possible, lots of murders were motivated by sentiment. Love was a vicious motivator indeed.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and interrupted her. “No. I’d never erase John. You have nothing to worry about. I’m fine. We both are.”
Alice Pollock had started working in Lacuna seven months before her death. A young woman who had recently graduated and who wanted to live on her own had just found her first job ever. She seemed like the perfect employee, she was responsible and treated the patients with care. Perhaps because she was one herself. On plain sight, Alice looked like a perfectly ordinary woman.
hidden beneath. Something you want to keep from the rest of the world. You came back three months ago from the war. Hardly a difficult deduction.”
“Stop blaming yourself, Sherlock”, John said, shaking his head. Sherlock looked at him, but couldn’t quite understand the expression on his face. John looked hurt and angry and sad and something else Sherlock couldn’t quite put a name to. Was it sympathy? Disdain? He couldn’t tell, he simply couldn’t. “You- you did what you could. It got out of your hands, all of it. Including me.”
John kept looking at him questioningly. His eyes hadn't fixed on Greg's for a second since he had come back with the tea, he kept staring at Sherlock. Greg's eyes fixed on John, wondering (and hoping) John would finally
“Mm,” John hummed in drowsy comprehension, and pushing himself to sit up with a soft sigh. “Sorry,” he murmured as he shuffled to the head of the bed and pushed the duvet down to crawl under it, Sherlock quickly following suit.
be rather horrified at the fact that his own blood was streaked across Sherlock’s skin, the doctor couldn’t hide his quirky, fond smile.
The Russian was all but crushing John with his weight, making it hard to breathe, and by God, there was a hell of a lot of force behind his fist. Said fist was raising in the air, ready to deliver another devastating blow, and John’s hands were pressed hard against the man’s thick neck, trying and failing to locate and depress his carotid arteries - he braced himself for the next blow, knowing full well he would very likely lose consciousness. He just hoped the police got in before the man got to Sherlock-
Ever the true Englishman that he was, John’s immediate reflex, of course, was to make himself tea; because there was not a problem in the world that couldn’t be fixed by a good cuppa. Hobbling gingerly into the kitchen, his entire body trembling subtly, John determinedly focused on the mundane task of fixing tea as he put the kettle on to boil and fetched a tea bag and mug from their respective cupboards. It seemed that the therapeutic act of going through the familiar motions was working as, a few minutes later, John barely had to put any thought into not letting his hands shake as he poured steaming water into his prepared mug. After setting the kettle back on the stove, he picked up his mug with the hand not gripping his cane, and turned away from the counter, rather appeased, his nerves somewhat tamed.
I won't spoil anything, but we'll run into much more EXCITING stuff starting next Saturday. Stay tuned for the next update!
“Oh, just got a text from Warren,” one of the men said, “he’ll be pullin’ up under the bridge in just under ten minutes.”
As the doctor watched, Sherlock shifted his weight on the thick plastic lid so his feet were nearest the sides of the bin itself for a bit of added support, before he stood up to nearly his full height, to peek cautiously through the small window partway up the tall wall. Meanwhile, John had once again drawn his gun, and was stood perfectly still in the space between the two warehouses, barely large enough for a car and lit only by the lights of the nearby park and the dim fluorescent bulbs that were on the fronts of the warehouses whose glows spilled partway into the space between them. The sun was almost entirely set, and John knew they wouldn’t get much assistance from the stars and moon, considering the light-pollution of the city. This was as good as it was going to get, unless they used torches.
I'll reassure you all that I am finally getting back to regularly working on the final few chapters of this work. If you would like to receive more regular updates, I am active on Twitter (@bi_an83), and Tumblr (minding-my-own-bismuth), and I follow back, if that is a selling point for anyone. Rest assured that an update WILL be coming in the very near future, and I will be going through previous chapters to rectify some continuity and grammar issues that I have come across.
“Holy shit. Do you think it’s too late for me to try and court you?” John stared at Mary where she stood in the doorway of her bathroom, his eyes doing an exaggerated and entirely necessary sweep of her body; she wore a low-cut, cropped halter top of pristine white with a bold red cross placed strategically on each breast, a
He closed the door behind him and snatched a clean towel from a bar on the wall, wrapping himself in its fluffy warmth before hastily running it over his limbs and torso to dry himself. Once finished, he scrubbed the towel over his hair to ruffle and dry it as much as he could. It’d likely still be damp when he got to work, but he supposed it wouldn’t be the first time; and, at least, it would be clean.
John took a breath. “Hm. So, this drug you were given last night was something you’ve not taken before. Correct?”
“But there cannot be any more delays.” The voice continued, and John didn’t think he’d ever seen a smirk so full of dark satisfaction as the one he saw on Sherlock’s face. “We have managed to escape the New Scotland Yard up to now, but we must leave tonight.”
His smile broadened at the resistance he was met with in the arm around him, and he bit his lip around a manic grin when John gave a whine of discontent at Sherlock’s departure. The detective leaned over John clumsily, half lying on him in the process, to grasp his mobile from where it sat upon the nightstand by the bed even as it went off with another text alert.
“Ah,” Sherlock nodded, and gnawed the inside of his cheek. “Bit of an unorthodox couples costume,” he said, “but I suppose if anyone is going to be able to help an injured rugby player, it would be a nurse; regardless of her state of dress.”
With a sigh, John moved to turn off the television, but his thumb stopped, hovering over the power button on the remote, when he heard the meteorologist turn the news over to the main news anchors, the “Breaking News” headline taking over the screen in bold, white font.
The skittering of Sherlock’s shoes against the concrete as he hurriedly distanced himself from the lifeless heap and the rapidly widening pool of crimson on the floor was swallowed by the lamenting wails of Pavel as the man staggered forward to collapse on his knees beside his brother. As John watched on, everything seemed to happen in slow-motion; Sherlock tripped over his own feet and landed hard on his backside, rendered clumsy by his shock; Pavel brought his hands, already glistening, red and wet, to hold his head in stunned disbelief while a string of pleas in Russian fell from his lips; of the other three men in the room, one had drawn his gun and was pointing it frantically everywhere, one had retrieved the discarded firearm from the floor by Matvei’s limp hand and was pointing it in Sherlock’s direction, and the third man, appearing unarmed and clearly shaken, was taking hasty steps towards the door.
Whether or not the porcelain shards actually looked like bone, and regardless of just how John drew a line between dried blood and tea, one thing was certain; it was going to be a very long day.
“I know asking you to behave yourself is a tall order,” John tried quipping, though he was met with another eye-roll, “but I think we’ll both enjoy ourselves a bit more if we both keep a level head, hm?”
Sherlock blinked and bit the inside of his cheek before taking a breath. “I actually… Well. Play for my own team, as well.”
instead of a fucking ambulance. And she told me if I called an ambulance she’d run away from the car.” He rolls his eyes and shakes his head at Sherlock. “The two of you would get along brilliantly.”
The soft clinking of the mugs and flatware in the sink as they were dutifully washed and rinsed lent an atmosphere of simple and quiet domesticity to the scene that Sherlock was unaccustomed to.
Looking a touch sour for being pulled away from his tea for a second time that day - because apparently John Watson
“Sorry, sweetheart,” Sherlock said mockingly, a sneer in his words, “maybe next time.” He fisted his pocket for cash.
“Fine,” Lestrade relinquished, and tossed John a blue smock, which the doctor reflexively caught and started pulling on. Though he did a double-take at Sherlock, who only grabbed a pair of gloves.
Having tied his shoes, John put his hands on his knees and pushed himself up before heading to the door to grab his jacket and pull it on. He patted his pockets, feeling for his mobile and wallet, before he stooped to pick up his messenger bag from where he’d put it when he first arrived at the flat the day before.
He barreled on, barely stopping to take a breath. “This costume was last-minute. Originally, I’m willing to bet she and her significant other had planned a couples-themed set of costumes, but seeing as they’ve split up, she couldn’t arrive at a party as one half of something that was no longer whole. She missed a tag on the skirt of her dress,” he said, eyes moving to where a small white tag peeked out from under the side of the yellow trim of the skirt, “and she didn’t have time to plan her footwear, and is now regretting it; see how she shifts her weight on her feet? The heels are uncomfortable. So much so that she walked here barefoot - there are subtle grass-stains and scuffs from the pavement on her heels.
wasn’t enough to stifle the pleasant warmth that seeped into Sherlock’s chest and seemed to settle in the bones of his ribcage, however, as he read and re-read the messages. It was unusual to have someone who wasn’t blood worry at all about him. Besides his dealers, of course; but the motivation behind their mild concern for his well-being stemmed from his being a source of income. Never before had Sherlock experienced concern for his livelihood past the obligatory familial sort; his brother kept constant tabs on him while his parents got information through their eldest son. Other than that, as far as Sherlock was concerned, no one cared. No one had cared for a long time.
Our boys are FINALLY ON THE SAME PAGE. I'm as relieved as you are (probably more relieved, to be honest).
A vivid recollection of the room earlier that day supplied the missing piece of the puzzle: the duffel bag. The duffel bag that Mr. Blessington had motioned to, that he’d packed, that he’d intended to take with him on holiday. It wasn’t there.
Sherlock’s coughs transformed into deep, rumbling chuckles as he rose back to his full height, cheeks flushed and eyes rimmed with the faintest hint of tears as he smiled at John. “Actually,” he began, and cleared his throat one more time, “I think that would be- I think that would be lovely. Assuming you’ve not already imbibed enough alcohol to impair your judgement this evening.”
John was in high spirits as he packed his laptop into its case and slung his messenger bag over his shoulder. He bid Rachel farewell as he passed the receptionist’s desk on his way out of the clinic, and he greedily filled his lungs with the crisp, late-afternoon air as he stepped outside. For once in his life, he felt perfectly at-ease. The puzzle pieces of his chaotic life that had once seemed so far out of his reach were finally falling into place; he was working in a field he was growing to love, he was living in a perfectly lovely flat with the man he’d fallen madly in love with
“He’s over there,” Kent’s voice sounded, and rapid footfalls quickly followed. Another gunshot; another bullet hitting metal. John took a breath; he knew that if he rounded the machinery to stay out of eyesight of Kent, and ‘Bids,’ and everyone else in the room, Kent would follow him - which would put Sherlock in the line of fire. A phantom ache in his left shoulder reminded him that he’d already been shot once. He’d died on the operating table. He’d been through hell, spent months in recovery, had his livelihood stripped from him, spent months after the fact wishing he’d died and contemplating finishing the job himself. Would he rather go through all of that again, or risk the life of someone else?
“Yeah. Go on, it’s been a long day. I’ve got some paperwork to finish - I’ll wrap that up quick and close everything up when I’m done.”
“Why do you like this shirt so much?” he asks suddenly, and John’s fingers still. He can feel John’s body heating in embarrassment.
The statement shocked both Sally and John, but the look of confusion on John’s face contrasted greatly with the look of sudden fear which was quickly overwhelmed by searing hatred that appeared on Sally’s.
John huffed a small laugh. “Can’t imagine why. You two seem so similar; both with a flair for the dramatic,” he said, looking around at the desolate and deserted warehouse with an amused expression. He turned back to the other man and heaved a sigh. “Look, like I said, I’d love to stay here and chat with you, but really, I’ve got somewhere to be.”
That wasn’t the first time John had heard that. In his many years of dealing with an alcoholic father and sister, they both claimed that they were happier when they drank; seeing the world through amber-coloured, hazy lenses almost constantly was far better for them than facing reality was. John was no stranger to the feeling, himself.
John had reason to be concerned. Sherlock looked awful. His curls were tangled and matted, sticking to the side. His clothes were rumpled and his face was pale and drawn, the circles under his eyes like black bruises. His eyes held a manic kind of pain that John had never seen there and frankly didn’t ever want to see again. The detective bubbled out a humourless laugh at John’s question.
Sherlock moved forward kissed him all over the face, his lips seeking and desperate. John giggled a bit and clutched at his chest. Sherlock was laughing too, that low laugh that John adored so.
The door opened with a loud creak and the wing-tipped shoes and point of the umbrella announced the arrival of Mycroft Holmes. The elder Holmes brother loomed over Moran, his shadow daunting in the single light of the room. Neither of them spoke as Mycroft took the chair opposite him. The cold silence was a bitter tension they could taste on their lips.
John did what he could in these situations; he made tea and held his tongue. Sherlock would talk when he wanted, no point in rushing him. It was clear he blamed himself for the deaths of those in the hotel, claiming as he did that day that he should have seen it coming.
The man quickly typed in his computer. “Uh… yes he was just taken into surgery. Fourth floor. You can wait up there. But it may be a while if you want to go home and change-“
Sherlock pressed some ice chips to John’s lips and he sucked on them gratefully, swallowing the small amount of water and sighing, trying again. “Sherlock? Are you alright?”
Sherlock needed more. He had run out of his supply today and the drum of need and want thumped against his veins, pushing him onward. His mind wandered back to John, picturing the puzzled look on his face when Sherlock had left and snorted out a laugh. A moment later he felt sickened with himself.
“I would read the fine print before dismissing it completely.” Mycroft folded his hands together and eyed Moran’s expression as his eyes scanned the first page.
He longed to retreat into his mind palace and hide there for an eternity, but that place was like a land mine. John was everywhere, in every room. His sunlight had filtered into each corner of each room. He couldn’t go there now, not if John didn’t make it.
“The official number of people killed in the explosion at The Connaught is up to as many as forty, with nearly fifty injured, and more reports coming in. There is still no report of what caused the explosion and Scotland Yard has refused comment. Was this a an act of terrorism and where will it stop? More news after this.”
Lestrade was there to catch him again and Sherlock brushed him off to say in a choked off voice, “May I see him?”
“Your health is always relevant to me.” John replied with a kind smile and John watched Sherlock’s face crumple spectacularly. “You can’t just say things like that John…” He choked out, squeezing his hand. “Not when I nearly lost you.”
“Did he? Because I have discovered a piece of information on that particular robbery. And no, he did not save your life. He had his men shoot your wife and then came flying in to supposedly save yours. A very heroic act on his part, don’t you think? Saving the day, showing his face, even though he never gets his hands dirty like that.”
He seemed more energised in the mornings, jumping from one task to the other, pouring over information from the victims and pacing around the flat, his attitude nearly manic. In the afternoons, at around half-past eleven each day Sherlock would collapse onto the couch, completely listless. His eyes bloodshot.
Lestrade held his hands up in surrender. “Sorry, mate. Just… can you try to take a couple deep breaths for me? We may be here for a while.”
Sherlock collapsed into the chair beside him, and watched John for a long moment, before he began talking, rambling about previous cases, about how he would like to take John on a real date when he felt up to walking to get Chinese food. He took his hand tenderly and talked and talked, refusing to leave John’s side again.
“Love meant jumping off a cliff and trusting that a certain person would be there to catch you at the bottom.”
Slowly, John focused his senses, and like wading through molasses, he struggled to understand what was going on. Then his memory began to flood back to him. Kidnapped, rescued, triumph, terror, pain, shouting, yelling… Sherlock
John was nearly startled by Sherlock’s verbal response, regardless of his curtness. John looked over at him, sitting on the couch, scratching his arm, an almost restless look in his eyes.
For the second time that day, Sherlock’s knees nearly hit the ground. But this time in relief. John wasn’t dead… he wasn’t leaving Sherlock.
“Woah, hey. It’s just me” Lestrade said, leading Sherlock to the nearest chair. “You’re gonna collapse.” He noted, looking at the detective with a grave kind of worry.
“He’s going to pull though. He’s stronger than the whole lot of us put together.” Lestrade’s voice came through muffled as Sherlock buried his head in his hands and gripped at his curls, pulling until the pain momentarily brought his thoughts away from John, dying not 100 feet from him.
However, all too soon the waves of fatigue began crashing along the shores of his frantic mind until his body won over and he crumpled on his bed, out cold.
Sherlock snarled and stopped, leaning back heavily against the nearest wall. The acidity of guilt bubbled in his stomach and tore at his chest. Sherlock knew what John would do if he ever found out about the little drug habit he had developed. John would hate him for it, hate him for being so weak. He would hate him for being so dependent when John had worked so hard to keep Sherlock’s demons at bay.
He found a seller in his usual spot and made the deal, trading stability for sanity, he headed off again, tucking the bag in his coat and making his way back to Baker Street. John would already be asleep by the time he came back, too tired to wait up for him.
He was leaping out of the car before it had come to a complete stop in the ambulance bay, deaf to Lestrade’s calls as Sherlock’s legs and panicked brain carried him inside the building. “John Watson” He gasped though jagged breaths to the receptionist, who look startled, eyeing his blood-soaked hands and coat. “What?” He asked.
He nearly flew to his room and took the drugs in a swift motion, ensuring the dosage was enough. He sighed as the cool liquid filled his veins and he began to pace around his room, thinking over Moran’s words, sorting, compiling all the information he had and piecing together any broken links.
An apology chapter for having to wait so long for the last one. I wrote this a few weeks ago so I only needed edits done.
Sherlock’s eyes darkened, “No. He died on his way to the hospital. The bullet I put in him made sure of that.” He growled.
They sat in the living room on a Saturday evening, the sun stretching through the clouds, painting them pink in the sunset. Their flat was warm enough that John stripped off his jumper, leaving him in a button-up plaid shirt that Sherlock tended to favour.
“-shouldn’t have said anything, you know, and it was possibly the most ridiculous thing you’d ever said, John, because the entirety of the Yard was at the crime scene and they all looked as though you’d grown a second head. They usually look at me like that, not you.”
And as he suspected, John’s snores wafted from his room, out of his open door. Sherlock wanted to go up the stairs to him, collapse into bed beside him and hold him close. But the pull for the fix kept him rooted at the bottom of the stairs, looking upward toward the dark entrance to John’s bedroom. The stairs to his room gaped like a dark void that he could not enter.
And he was not one to refuse a request from Sherlock Bloody Holmes as he cracked his eyes open and the mad detective came into view.
“But hey, the key word there is ‘nearly’. You didn’t lose me, Sherlock. It takes more than that to kill me.” He said with a tired smirk.
Hours must have passed for Sherlock’s fingers went numb after a while, when his breathing was nothing but ragged gasps and he needed to lean back to stave off the dizziness that washed over him. At that point he noticed his brother sitting beside him, talking to Lestrade in a low tone. He met Mycroft’s gaze and the man said nothing, merely resting a hand on Sherlock’s lower back and rubbing a tiny circle there.
“I assume Moriarty has a plan of getting you out of here. A connection to get you released. He’ll have threatened someone no doubt.”
“He forgot to factor in you.” Sherlock whispered, kissing his doctor passionately. “Now rest. I’ll be here when you wake up.”
His brain fired synapses quickly, deductions and theories threading their way through his mind like a thick stream. He closed his eyes to filter the thoughts, the drugs pushing them faster through his mind. He scribbled notes and pictured the scene at The Connaught, locating Moran’s position and narrowing down targets.
Sherlock nodded and followed her to the ICU, nearly stopping dead when he saw John lying on the bed, surrounded by tubes and machines. Approaching, John looked like a corpse, pale against the white sheets and thin, fragile and oh so precious.
Sebastian Moran sat on a cold metal chair, staring idly at the wall. His gag had been removed yet his was still handcuffed, the cool metal biting at his raw flesh.
I'm terribly sorry it's been so long, but hopefully I can turn out a few more chapters in the next few weeks! Thanks for you continued support and commitment to this story!
John would squint at him and shake his head; perhaps this was his way of coping with a great defeat such as this. God knows John had his way of coping, most of which involved a bottle of Gin and crap telly.
“You’ve barely eaten, you’ve been holed up in your bloody room now for hours on end, you haven’t even spoken to me! I know you deal with things differently than most humans on this blasted planet, but I’m worried about you.” John’s tone turned to desperation, his anger deflating at the look on the detective's face. His sunken eyes held a dead look. His face crumpled, the frown lines severely pronounced and creasing his smooth skin.
