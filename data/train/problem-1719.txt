“John, I know you’re scared,” Mycroft came into the kitchen, closing the door to the lounge behind him. “You overheard everything by the door?”
Three years of avoiding heats was taking its toll. John’s body was overwhelmed, desperate for an alpha, desperate for a knot, a mate, and finding nothing.
Sherlock and Mycroft went off to order food from some exclusive supplier or other, and Sherry took John into town for clothes.
“No. I think I’ll go and read for a bit. I need to pack my case, anyway.” Sherlock gave him a small smile. “I’m sorry.”
“Well, I do have a laboratory,” Cam said, as though joking. “I jest, of course, but…” his face filled with a sad longing, which quickly vanished. “Go on. Your parents will be looking for you.”
if that didn’t somehow seem right and good, and Sherlock almost melted into the mattress from the sheer feeling of it all. He couldn’t think. Couldn’t reason. He jerked his hips up into John’s grip, his climax coming like a freight train.
“Sherlock…” John leaned up, chasing a kiss as Sherlock’s hand stroked over his cock, feather-light, then up to the curve of his pregnant stomach.
Sherlock snarled at himself as he sat up. This was exactly why he shouldn't have done that. Distraction. He stood, and yanked on the rest of his clothes without the usual care, slamming the door to the bunk as he left. He stormed down the halls until he reached the cafeteria, annoyed at himself, but not yet murderous. He saw John, and, to his dismay, Major Sholto.
“Early? It’s not that early, the night before.” Sherlock turned, putting his head on one side, curious.
His time in the cave felt surreal and difficult to remember as the days went on. But one thing about it stayed clear – the gentle look on Sherlock’s face as he touched him. But maybe Sherlock hadn't even been real. John might have imagined the whole thing. But, as John lay back against the pillows in the dark of the night, running a hand over his damp sweat-cooled body, he knew there were some things he couldn't have imagined. He couldn’t have imagined that warmth, helping him to stay alive after the ocean’s icy grasp. He couldn’t have imagined that careful, gentle exploration of his body, or the pleasure that the creature had drawn from it. That sucking grip, the steady work of his cock, and the gentle tease of his glans, the tentacle tasting his pre-come even as it lubricated, mixing with the shining slick Sherlock’s tentacle’s produced. Despite how ill he was feeling, John took his own cock in hand and replayed the memory in his mind before coming silently, into his handkerchief.
“Alpha hormones are the most prevalent in the human bloodstream,” John explained. “There is simply more of them, and so they have a statistical chance of condensing quicker. Everyone in this room has alpha hormones, just as we all have testosterone, but our bodies will vary. It’s simply luck of the genetic draw.” He waited for the students to make notes. Sherlock was writing something, but it didn’t look like lecture notes. He was wearing skinny jeans, and a fitted shirt open at the throat, looking utterly edible, but smelling utterly blank. If he’d given off a single note of omega, he’d’ve been buried under a pile of alphas. It was almost as though he was flaunting his unwanted-ness.
Eurus’s hands – locked together in cuffs – clenched together, like a stance of prayer. “You bonded with my brother,” she said, her voice like dry leaves. “And you left him alone.”
‘End of an era,’ Sherlock nodded. One of his floppy curls felt down over his face, and he pushed it up and out of the way. ‘How are you feeling?’
Sherlock… did he still plan to get bonded and go off to university? There was a For Sale sign on the lawn of the house next door – John’s dad said there was a lot of Holmes family debt that had been kept a secret, and that Mycroft was having to take his mother in to look after her, along with trying to sell the house. When Sherlock came home, he would likely have to go and live with his brother as well.
“It doesn’t matter,” John said. “I’ve had no one to spend money on, before now. Come on. There’s just enough to get you a phone before the shops shut.”
A plaster lay at the crook of the student’s elbow. Sherlock reached, and tore it off quickly. Beneath it were a myriad of raised puncture scars, like braille.
John rutted against Sherlock, his erection already present through his jeans. Sherlock let him take what he wanted, as he did the same, until he was forced to pull away from John to prevent everything from ending far too soon. He lapped at the wound, stopping the blood quickly and dragging his lips up to John's jaw, his hands rubbing down John's back, dipping under his trousers and pants, and squeezing his arse hard.
“I’m savouring it.” Sherlock split the tape, and let the paper fall open without tearing it, much. A stream of blue fabric poured out, thick and soft and luxurious. “Oh,” he said, unwinding it. “Oh, that feels lovely.” He wrapped the scarf around his neck. “Thank you.”
John realised he hadn’t taken many breaths. If Mycroft invited this stranger in… a stranger who seemed to be a policeman – he said he was on a ‘case’… He could drag John had to the Holmes’ Manor and then John would be… punished.
“No one said you were!” John gasped. “Haven’t I been good to you? Haven’t I taken enough care of you?”
John left the room, deleting the picture he’d been sent as soon as he was out of sight. It was messing with his head. He didn’t care that Sherlock had boobs – lots of boys did, for starters, and John didn’t care, he really didn’t care. Sherlock was a boy, and that was all that mattered.
He sent the message, and pressed his phone against his head, hating himself for a moment before going into the kitchen, and grabbing a few plastic bottles of water, and some energy bars. He took them into the bedroom, and waited nervously for the pain to begin.
“It is,” John agreed. He raised a hand, tentatively, then touched at Sherlock’s collar-bone, before moving down.
‘So do I, until an omega lad turns up. It’s all bullshit, saying you like lads or lasses. It depends on the person.’
‘Uh…’ John pulled a face, and picked his phone up. He raised his eyebrows at Sherlock. ‘D’you mind? I want to…’ he gestured as his crotch.
‘No,’ Sherlock looked more awkward. ‘They, er, have her down as Baby Holmes. I’m so sorry, I didn’t want to contradict in case they asked who her father was, and… and…’ he looked incredibly guilty.
John laced his hands together. “I guess… the whole doing it alone, thing. And… how to tell him. And…” he puffed out a breath, “and I don’t want him to feel like he has to be there, because he doesn’t want
“Good afternoon…” Sherlock closed the door behind him. “Don’t worry, I did make an appointment, I’m not pushing in.”
Sherlock’s lips went thin. “Sure.” He picked up his bag. “I’ll see you in class, I suppose.” He made no move for the door.
John could feel Sherlock's eyes on him as he put his washbag away, and fished out some clean pyjama bottoms. The gaze made John's skin prickle, and he felt as if the backs of his knees might be sweating, though they didn't feel wet. He swallowed, hyper-conscious of the fact Sherlock could hear the warm, wet sound, and the way John's heart had started hammering. He tried to think of something that wasn’t blood, or sex.
James stared, for a moment, then smiled. “Sounds like you’ve got it all sorted.” He picked up his coffee.
“I thought, on the whole, the caesarean looked the least terrifying,” Sherlock went on. “The water one just looked ridiculous. And the bed –”
There were. But Sherlock hadn’t been to any of his counselling sessions, nor his emotional support group therapy. He wanted to put his father’s death behind him, not bring it out for examination every week. But then, the letter had arrived…
Sherlock's heart thumped. "Ok. I'll tell Mummy. Just bring... Pyjamas, and clothes... You can use our bathroom stuff."
The two men crashed together, arms and hands grabbing at anything they could reach. They kissed hard, less a sensual start to love-making and more a desperate need for physical contact. Sherlock forced John’s jacket zip down, off, over his arms, to the floor, moving to his belt, unbuckling fast, opening John’s jeans-buttons, and his zip, shoving his trousers down over his arse, with his pants, in one movement.
“No more – oh, god, that’s good – mood swings, though,” John let his head fall back again. “No one’s going to miss those…. Shit, just… Sherlock!”
Mycroft was staring at him as though he’d seen a ghost. Or a premonition, maybe. His eyes were goggling, mouth open, croissant in his hand crumbling in his grip as he gawped in a most unattractive manner.
Mycroft went red. “Oh. Well. You’re… welcome.” He cleared his throat. “Only a week, of course. All being well, you’ll be back at Baker Street after that.”
Sherlock’s thoughtful look remained, but he looked at John. ‘I’m not going anywhere,’ he said. ‘You can’t scare me that easily.’ His eyes moved to Birdie, and the worried look sank back into his eyes.
The major folded his arms. "Well then, I suppose I'll just have to have someone sent over who will be more compliant."
“Bugger…” Timothy stripped off his own dressing gown and wrapped his step-son in it. “Vi, I’ll run a bath.”
“To measure the baby, and check it’s healthy, and I’m healthy,” John said, feeling like he was explaining to a child. Had Sherlock ever paid attention in human biology? “Um… if you wanted to come…”
John sat back. “I see. But if you are an alpha, too, surely they can half it? I didn’t know many families still went down the alpha line.”
“I think she’d go in for anything if it helped her win. Don’t worry about it,” John said as the cab pulled away. “It’s not a real engagement.”
Once home, Sherlock emptied half the bag onto his desk-top, arranging it into a line with his school ruler. He tore a page from his planner to make a tube, and stuck it in his nose before leaning down, and breathing in, hard.
Sherlock put his arm around John’s shoulders. “I meant what I said, John. By the river. All that I am, I give to you. You know that, don’t you?”
“I know, it’s new and scary,” John got up and went to sit on the sofa, but was careful not to touch Sherlock. Still, his presence seemed to make the boy relax. “It’s not what either of us expected, and just because we’re not… you know… now, doesn’t mean we never will, ok? Just… you’re not legal by any standard, and I don’t like children in that way. I’m not going to force you into adulthood just so I can have a mate. I don’t agree with it.”
“I can try,” John set his jaw, determined. “I don’t have to be a vampire. I can stay here, not go outside… I can beat this. Sherlock…” he reached for him, “you can help me?”
heat. Not this sentimental intimacy that had left Sherlock wrung-out and exhausted and satisfied in a way that was different from the satisfaction of having a member in your arse.
“Well, for now,” John reasoned, “let’s keep on. Show him we’re above it. Show him we don’t care. If he’s not bothering us, he might get bored, and move on.”
But John didn’t have anywhere to live, he didn’t have a flat, or enough money to stay in London on his own… Mycroft was a dead end.
“Alright…” Sherlock shrugged, though a cold worm of discomfort was now making its way through his insides. “Why ‘Cam’, though?”
Sherlock spent most of their time in public snarling at alphas who dared to even inhale in John’s direction. Including poor Greg Lestrade, who innocently gave John a hug and had to deal with Sherlock yanking them apart, Greg by the collar.
"Mummy, I have to do this," Sherlock said, his voice very small, but the two women in the room did stop and look at him. "I'm seventeen, now. I need to start taking testosterone. I need to get rid of... I need top surgery. I can't keep... doing this."
“Are they a couple?” John asked later, when Mycroft had gone out to order Christmas meat, having suddenly realised he was going to be playing host. “Mycroft and Greg?”
“She will,” Greg said, watching the baby girl wobble again, before plonking herself down hard and pulling up handfuls of grass. “And then she’ll be off. You’ll get no peace.”
The moon, wreathed in cloud, glowed in amusement at Sherlock’s shocked expression. The snow-clouds were clearing, and the night air was bitingly crisp. Below their shoes, London glowed in a blur of streetlamps, headlights and shop-signs.
‘That’s still true. Sort of. But… and I know this will be hard to understand, given that I’m an omega, but… I didn’t want the kiss. The one that wasn’t you, I mean.’
Mycroft’s expression went from horrified anger to apoplectic rage. ‘You…’ he took a deep breath as if he was about to start screaming. Then let it out slowly, eyes closed, clearly trying to stay calm. ‘It’s alright,’ he said firmly. ‘You probably aren’t, anyway. It’s too soon.’
John stood, quickly following him out of the kitchen, up the stairs, to the bathroom, catching the door just before Sherlock turned to slam it.
John inhaled, as if he’d just remembered how, and his brain fizzed to catch up with the situation. He looked up at the concerned face. “…what?”
Too long, it turned out. John wasn’t sick, but it was a close thing as they came to a bumpy landing. By the time the private cars had picked them up, he was as white as a sheet.
“No offence, but can you fuck off?” John said, pushing his chair back and standing. “I’d appreciate if it you stopped intimidating my boyfriend.”
John told him, yet again, that he didn’t care, and they went to bed that night in a lurid frenzy of kisses and bare skin and touches that radiated out from fingers down to the most secret places within them.
Sherlock stayed for around an hour, before he decided he had to leave. They'd all sat around with tea and biscuits, Mycroft arranging a team of men to go to Kensington and rescue John's belongings. Apparently the first team he sent had been barred entry - James Sholto was in rut, and would be for at least twenty-four hours. John noted dully that that probably explained the man's behaviour, even if it certainly did not excuse it. Sherlock used the break in conversation to excuse himself.
John took it as the train set off again, letting his smaller hand be swamped by Sherlock’s long fingers, and held safe. Warmth flooded up his arm and to his chest, and he looked up as Sherlock looked down. And for a moment, they just took one another in, in their own tiny space on the crowded train, chest to chest, their fingers entwined.
John shrugged. "It's fine, I'm up now. What are you so snippy about? You seem overly tense. I thought you were confident in your deductions? It's not like you to be stressed out."
!” He thumped the wall beside Mrs Hudson’s door. “Of course you’re pregnant. You drink decaf tea for godsake. No one does that unless they have to.”
“Well, next scan’s in eight weeks,” John said. He put the pictures back in his wallet. “I think I’ll turn in, actually.”
“Did you want to see your room, and freshen up a little?” Violet interrupted, looking with distaste at Harry’s muddy DMs.
Things would always be the same for them. Even if they changed, they could only get closer, couldn’t they?
John’s words were cut short as Sherlock moved too fast too see, and bit hard into his neck. There was pain, and John shouted, made to pull away, but he couldn’t. Sherlock never normally hurt him much, these days. He knew how to slide in his sharp fangs so the pain never lasted for more than a moment, quickly drowned in pleasure.
Sherlock went quiet, his chest feeling extremely heavy. ‘But, who was it?’ he asked. ‘Who could it even have been? They don’t allow alphas up here for that very reason.’
“So,” John picked up a kidney dish of warm water, and a bundle of cotton balls. “What happened to you?”
“There’s plenty to say,” Sherlock said, and John had a feeling the alpha was only getting started. “How long had this been going on, John?”
“John,” Ryan leaned forward. “John… you don’t talk about it. All we know is you moved to London out of the blue, lived with two alphas, one of whom you’re engaged to, and then suddenly their dad gets shot dead.”
, not alpha, and there was a vase of fresh flowers on the coffee table. The place looked barely lived-in.
Was he blushing? Was that a blush? John found he rather loved the idea. “Um…” John licked his lips apart as Sherlock watched him intently. “Are – are we friends? Is… is that what this is?”
“Oh god,” John sobbed, his cock spilling over, thin streaks of fluid splattering onto the bed, his arse clenching hard around his alpha’s cock, making Sherlock roar in pleasure shoving forward hard, John’s sharp cry the only thing stopping Sherlock short from trying to knot him.
He paused, hand on the door, after dressing. He had no idea if Sherlock had stayed the night, and he didn’t really fancy running into him if he had. Still, it wasn’t even seven, yet. Sherlock was probably still asleep, or gone altogether.
John jogged up the stairs, pushing the door open gently, trying to hide the rising panic he felt. Sherlock needed him to be calm. Needed to be kept calm himself. “Hey.”
John sighed, and set his own laptop down. In the six months they’d been living together, Sherlock’s manners had eased off. He’d gone from ‘please may I stay after school’ to ‘can I go to the museums’ to ‘I’ll be back at eight’ extremely rapidly. John had let him. Sherlock deserved a bit of freedom to grow up without being bothered.
Sherlock sat on the edge of the bed. He looked exhausted, and his hair was on end. ‘If you wake her up, I shall murder you,’ he said quietly.
“Not like that,” Sherlock said. “It’s more… traditional alpha stuff. It’s not like this,” he put a hand over John’s. “It’s… more intense.”
“Maybe just a dip,” Sherlock took an egg and egg cup. “Dipping your toast is poor table manners,” he added. “But it looks nice.”
John threw the covers back. No, that wasn’t true at all, was it? Alphas could control themselves, they just said they couldn’t so they could get what they wanted. Sherlock was proof of that. There were other men who were proof of that. Just a few – too many – who let the side down, and said omegas
“Yes…” Sherlock couldn’t go with this man. He would find out his name and realise his address was still, officially, Baker Street. He’d be taken back to John. He couldn’t face him like this. “I should get going…” he started to move away.
“Which is unusual in a police officer,” John countered. “His staff might be less noble than he’s been towards you.”
, Mycroft’s warning blazed in the young omega’s mind, and he pulled away from the touches, half-walking after the car, waving, as if he was enthusiastic.
“Access to the library, and any questions answered,” Cam said. “And I do mean any. You’re nearly a man, Sherlock. Do you really want to be treated like a child for your whole life?”
John knelt up, taking his cock in hand – it was harder, larger, than he’d known it for years. His knot was already swelling, and John was certain that this time it would end buried inside Sherlock’s body. He parted Sherlock’s arse cheeks with a hand, and rubbed the thick head of his cock on the still-small-looking hole, biting his lip as he restrained himself from just plunging in.
“Legally nothing,” Mycroft snapped. “This isn’t about genetics, John, you have to make a judge see that. This is about that man being a danger to others. That is your one and only defence. You one way to stop Birdie being handed over to him. No parent can keep a child they are endangering, and this has to be framed in that way. Miss Kogen will attempt to show you in the poorest frame of light possible, and you and Miss Ali will have to turn that negative spotlight onto Mayhew.”
“So, Sherlock,” Cam came over, and Sherlock saw his parents begin to chat with each other. “How is school?”
Sherlock came back with two cups of caffeine-free tea and a ready baby bottle, which Birdie accepted with a happy ‘hmm’ sound as she snuggled into John’s chest.
John picked one up. It was a case file, dated twenty years before even he was born. Cold case, then. With an ache, he realised this must be the detective inspector trying to get fresh eyes on cases that might never be solved. Sherlock would never be able to work on them properly. But he might say even one thing that made the other detectives think, or look at the case in a different light. Because once he was gone…
“Ok,” Sherlock picked his toast back up. “I don’t think it’s anything, personally. I don’t even feel warm.” He finished his toast and moved onto a yoghurt and two bananas before he had to leave, each item of food making John more nervous. Omegas ate a lot before their heats struck – because during heats their digestive systems all but shut down. And Sherlock had never been a breakfast person.
John looked over his face in the bathroom mirror. He raised a hand, and pushed his forehead up, just a touch, to erase the lines that had appeared over the past year. He let go, and watched them form again.
‘I know.’ John grinned, scraping his teeth down Sherlock’s pectoral muscle, over to his sternum, and moved down, kissing and licking the salt of his sweat. Sherlock moaned again, his cock throbbing. He’d agreed to this as part of their experimenting with dominance, but he hadn’t factored just how terrible not being able to move would be.
Sherlock was the same, and not the same. Some days (the days John liked the best), he was happy and chatty, and like his old self. He offered sniping deductions about the teachers’ love-lives, and he and John went back to his house, hanging out like they used to, teasing Mycroft when he was caught taking cake out of the kitchen without permission.
“You don’t have a lot of stuff,” James observed as John shut the boot of the taxi, and paid the driver. “Aren’t there more boxes?”
“I need you or Sherlock to sniff this,” John thrust the packet at him. “I think there’s some sort of ammonia-based agent in it.”
John squeezed his eyes shut, for a moment. “I…” he shook his head at himself. “It’s a… family thing.”
Mycroft looked up, as if he could see through the floorboards, then back at Sherlock, scandalised. “You can’t continue this.”
He looked ill, for certain, but no worse than before. There was a little colour in his cheeks, and the bags under his eyes were not so pronounced. One of his arms was out of the blanket, and John could see a few fresh bruises on the soft tissue, but that was to be expected. Sherlock’s soft curls were clean, and tumbled over his ears and forehead, framing his pale face.
The first few times it happened, John was held still by fear. But as the inappropriate sniffing continued, John’s natural omega submissiveness slowly gave way. It was forced to, for his own preservation.
“He’s been on one all day,” John said, ignoring Sherlock’s offered hand as he got to his feet. “He’d rather I wasn’t here. And don’t you dare say you agree with him.”
John thought it was possibly the sexiest thing he had ever heard – Sherlock, neither beta nor omega, reaching between his own legs and sliding his thin fingers into himself, feeling the ache of the stretch, seeking out his prostate, maybe with his other hand wrapped around his cock, pumping himself to orgasm as he fucked himself, hips bucking, on his fingers.
“Your mate is having stitches, and then she’ll be taken to recovery. Someone will fetch you when she’s on the ward,” the doctor nodded again, and Victor collapsed into his chair.
John nodded, passing it over, and kneeling up, arms shaking, as Sherlock undid the foil, and took out the roll of latex, checking it was the right side up, before rolling it down John’s cock.
Sherlock smiled, tempted for a moment to seize John’s hand, but knowing that John might not be ready for that. PDA was not everyone’s cup of tea, even if it was just holding hands.
"Dawn," John said. "The sun comes up. You know, the sun?" He motioned with a hand, up high, splaying his fingers like the sun's rays. "In the sky?"
They were all gathered in the living room, John next to Sherlock on the sofa, Mycroft leaning on the mantelpiece, Greg Lestrade sitting nervously in one of the armchairs. It was a couple of days after John’s tearful outburst, and though he didn’t feel any better for it, he felt a fraction closer to Sherlock, who hadn’t made an attempt to touch or hug John more than John had initiated. They had continued to text on and off over the few days apart, but now, with Lestrade delivering bad news, John found himself huddling against the alpha, gripping onto his sleeve. Sherlock patted his hand, gently.
John smiled, and Sherlock could tell it was a genuine one. “Good. Did you want to check your bedroom?”
The rest of the visit was easier, with John talking about his morning sickness, showing Sherrinford the scan photos, and opening all the gift bags, which contained tiny outfits and shoes and hats and blankets, all from high-end stores that John couldn’t afford to set a foot in. He hugged his brother in law, and thanked him genuinely for all the gifts, promising to keep in touch, and eventually closing the door on Sherrinford, who looked as if a weight had fallen off him by coming to visit.
“Do not even attempt to talk me out of this,” Sherlock said. “I’m sure. I haven’t changed my mind, and I want this. I want you. I want you, John Watson, inside me.”
“Oh, for god’s – right,” Sherrinford grabbed a pad and pen, and sketched out a boy’s naked body, standing to one side. “You know what this bit is, right?”
Everyone knew he was an omega. Everyone knew he was bonded. Everyone knew he was injured and a failure and living without his mate… God, he just wanted to curl up into a ball and hide.
Now, John understood just how different he was. And how special, in a way, though John was certain he knew more reasons for Sherlock being special than just the way he smelled and looked. John would look at himself in the mirror critically. He was short, for an alpha, though broad at the shoulders, and physically fit. He wasn’t fond of his nose, and he had some bad acne on his cheeks that persisted no matter what he did to it. He wasn’t exactly the sort of alpha you saw on tv that omegas fawned over. And he certainly wasn’t what Sherlock deserved.
John looked at the eldest Holmes sibling, with his dark hair and lack of chin, and wondered what everyone seemed to see in him. “Ok…”
John’s heart picked up the pace as he pushed Sherlock’s trousers over his arse, and he was faced with severely tented underwear. His own erection throbbed, and he was tempted to give up on his current plan, and simply frot against the vampire until they both came, but why rush?
Sherlock watched John’s upper teeth scrape over his lower lip, just for a second. Blood rushed to the surface of the skin, reddening his lip, blushing it.
He considered deleting the message, but closed it, instead. He’d seen John tomorrow, and that would be fine. Painful, but fine.
Mycroft looked sadly at his éclair, then set his paper down on the coffee table. “John, as much as I understand your need to participate in team activities, I have some reservations about this particular… sport.”
Sherlock hesitated, then came carefully into the room and sat beside John. “Did she write something dreadful in it?” he asked.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Hello? … Yes, thirty-nine weeks… I’m not sure… On a scale of one to ten? About five? Like a forced-heat pain.” He blushed, and John looked away. “… My mate is here, he’s a doctor… I’m in the bath, if you must know… Ok. Bye.” He put the phone down.
He followed the nurse around the corner to a seat built onto some weighing scales. He perched on it, and watched the woman write the numbers down, before she took out a blood pressure cuff.
He had fought off the urge as he pushed inside Sherlock for the first time, but now his inner alpha was screaming for him to fulfil his purpose. And without pause, he pulled out of Sherlock’s tight, wet, heat, almost to his tip, and then slammed back inside.
John smiled sadly. “It should be what I want, too. But here we are.” He twisted his arm and caught Sherlock’s hand in his own. “Come on.”
John swallowed hard, gripping Sherlock’s hip with a hand as Sherlock pushed the thin plastic to the base, and then handed John the bottle of lube.
. It’s just… young alphas, like what you’ll be, soon, they tend to be a bit… keen. And some of them… aren’t very nice.”
Sherlock didn’t need to sleep, of course, but sometimes he had stayed in the bed. Clearly, he felt it would be better to leave.
The baby glared at John. He had no idea how old it was, or what sex, but it had mastered giving an unnerving stare, for sure. John gave it a small smile. The baby blinked, then beamed, showing two teeth. It kicked its legs and made a sort of ‘hnnnnnggh’ sound that made its mother look up in alarm, then relax.
A cold feeling pooled in John’s stomach, then flared like oil catching alight, flaming down his limbs. His chest tightened, and he had to bite his lip whilst he held back a jealous snarl. “Oh,” he managed to say.
“And get some lunch,” Sherlock nodded. “Something warm usually makes her stop digging her feet into my bones for a few minutes.”
“Yes, Madam Justice,’ Miss Ali leapt to her feet as she spoke whilst Mayhew’s solicitor merely nodded.
John dropped his trousers, releasing his erection at last, and giving himself a couple of strokes, the lubricating pre-come beneath his foreskin helping to draw the soft skin back. This omega… he was so beautiful. He was going to be John’s. Belong to him utterly. In mind, body and soul. He would be the mother of John’s children, his mate for life. John reached out and dragged a hand down the omega’s flawless back, to the wet cleft of his arse.
Sherlock rubbed his jaw with the palm of his hand. It was sore. He’d grown a sort of fluffy down on his chin, moreso in the last week, and he’d shaved it off almost instantly. Bum-fluff was worse than no facial hair.
, John was sure of it. Maybe he wasn’t having heats yet, but he was over the age of consent in the UK, and that would be enough –
The food was eaten, the drinks knocked back, and the group went to gather around the bonfire as the fireworks started.
He looked up to see an omega woman cooing at twins in a large pram. He smiled at them. The woman caught his eye, and noticed the booklet in his hands.
Sherlock stood on the path, trying not to wobble. Maths. He had to get to Maths. Where was Maths? Where was he now?
He hailed a cab, and got into it, slumping into the backseat and putting his head in his hands, not bothering to hold back the sobs as he was driven to the clinic. He kept on crying as the doctor gave him the after-heat pill, and then the shot – enough to stop his heats and scent for sixth months – and managed to dry his eyes only once given a cup of tea and a hand on the shoulder.
Sherlock went on. “The truth is... I'll be quite sorry to leave, today. You're one of the few humans I've met who haven't repulsed me. I've enjoyed my time with you. That said, I think it's better if I go. I'm..."
? John couldn’t say it. God, he wanted to, but he couldn’t ask. If he asked, he might find out the answer and if the answer was
John’s eyes were wide, and he looked rather terrified. ‘What did we just do?’ he breathed as they managed to pick up lemonades and vol au vents without anyone looking suspicious. ‘What… did we just do?’
John clicked to the next slide, showing a lithograph of internal anatomy. “Can anyone tell me what we’re looking at, here?”
“Well, you’re not an alpha,” John said. “But I’m sorry, it wasn’t clear enough to see any better than that. You could have an MRI, but there’s no way I could sneakily give you one of those. But… you said you’d be ok if alpha was out of the equation?”
When John woke again, it was the next morning. To his disappointment, the cot beside him was empty again. When he asked about it, he was told Sherlock had been asked to go home, and had taken Birdie with him.
“I wanted Victor back,” Sherlock said as gently as he could manage whilst vibrating with rage. If John was as close to death as he thought, there was only one way to keep him here. But he would have to move fast. Bite hard, give the venom in his veins enough time to flow into John’s body, start the change…
John dropped his pyjama trousers without preamble and dropped himself to all fours. Sherlock had never thought that could be unsexy, and yet here he was. ‘Just behind me,’ John said, scarlet in the face. ‘Believe me, I don’t like this any more than you do.’
“I’m sorry I shouted that,” John said, remembering his outburst of the previous day, in Tesco. “I’m just… angry.”
They were both already standing, following him out of the door, not bothering to grab coats, just keys as they pelted down the stairs after the fugitive they’d been chasing for weeks – get this one, Lestrade had said, and they could all retire.
“Uh,” Victor breathed out, working his hand steadily, both erections in his hand, the two boys each giving tiny thrusts into his grip as he moved, slowly as first, then steadily faster as Sherlock shuddered and cried out, bracing his hands on Victor’s chest, his hips open and splayed as he straddled the alpha’s body, finally giving in with a soft moan that was accompanied by a small ejaculation quickly drowned by Victor’s own, much larger version.
Sherlock, pacing around the flat, didn’t recognise the sound until he looked at John and saw the state of his arms.
“What – you trying to scrub away the omega?” she grinned, the fridge light illuminating her teeth. “It doesn’t work like that.”
“Yeah, but she doesn’t like boys,” John lowered his voice even further. “She doesn’t know I know. But I saw her kissing a girl in her class before we broke up.”
John chewed the inside of his mouth, thinking. Sherlock could be having a wash, or a cry, or anything. He didn’t need a pushy alpha mothering him as he tried to wash.
“I had a call,” Mycroft said. “From Gregory’s superiors, about him being hospitalised with a severe vampire bite. Given his status, and how few of us he knows, I was forced to consider you.”
Mr Thorne snorted. ‘You’re being ridiculous, Sherlock. Joseph stayed, and came back, by choice. He wasn’t forced to do anything. He made his own decisions. Same as you.’
John turned on the kettle. Hot chocolate might relax his mate. He measured out the spoons of mixture, and listened to Sherlock flumping about. The sooner this baby was born, the better.
John raised a hand. “You want Sherlock to take me on because it’d be less of a scandal than him living with me as a friend? That’s… sick, Mycroft. He’s a grown man. I’m a grown man! I don’t need adopting, I’m as old as I am and I’ve got this far in my life without being treated like… like I need looking after.” John knew he was starting to raise his voice, but couldn’t help it. “Sherlock isn’t interested in anything romantic, but neither has he tried to kick me out of the flat, when he very well could have done. He doesn’t tiptoe around me like I’m some fragile omega made of glass that might break at any moment. He’s been more supportive than my own family. If he wants me to leave, I’m sure he won’t exactly mince his words.” John pushed the files back at Mycroft. “Take them away. I don’t want to look at them.”
John gave a nod, and marched out of the offices, hating how obvious his failures were to those around him.
John looked at Sherlock, and gave a little smile. “You must be one of a kind,” he said suddenly. “You’re actually in rut, and sitting drinking tea like everything’s fine.”
“Sherlock, stop,” John demanded. “Listen to yourself. That’s not you talking. You know you can’t be with us both. That’s not how hearts work. You chose him, when I wasn’t around for you, and that’s something I’ve got to make peace with. You weren’t a nun. That’s fine. But this…
He had to be at school for eleven, get his results, and confirm his place for sixth form, should he get the right grades. He couldn’t help a nervous coil in his stomach at the thought. What if he hadn’t passed? His teachers said he was clever, and he generally did well in his essays and assignments in class, but this was an exam. He’d never done a real exam before. He hadn’t particularly enjoyed doing them. They went on for too long, and seemed to be targeted at confusing the students with the apparent simplicity of the questions.
John picked up his highlighter and blobbed yellow beside the boy’s name. Best not to be alone with him, just to be on the safe side. He needed this lecturing job, he couldn’t afford to overstep the mark and get sacked, interesting unpresented student or not.
Sherlock made a small noise, hiding his face in the duvet, but moved his leg to part his arse cheeks a little more, whilst keeping John’s cock between his legs. “John…”
John started up the stairs, and Sherlock and Mycroft bickered behind him the entire way. It was obvious Sherlock wished Mycroft hadn’t chosen this day to come around and give a lecture. He would much rather that John could acclimate, and relax.
He was a doctor, he knew pregnancies… but, somehow, given the fact he was trying to hide this situation from everyone, he had almost ended up hiding it from himself. Even at his check-ups he had acted as though he was attending a business meeting. The fact that his baby was moving around inside him, and he could feel it…
“He likes you. I can smell it. I can smell a lot of things recently; I think I’ll mature pretty soon. He smells… jealous. And possessive.”
He flinched, slightly, at the contact of John’s hands on his bare hips. Sherlock was aware that his hips were broad, and curvy, and still fairly feminine, but John thumbed at his hip-bones, and splayed his fingers behind him, and it didn’t feel bad.
“I don’t know,” Sherlock sipped the scalding drink, putting it down quickly. “It depends on you, really, doesn’t it?”
“I thought so. But we don’t have to let them know. I’m a grown man, Sherlock, I can keep my counsel. What you did to me, it won’t happen again. Will it?”
“You know what?” James cocked his scarred head to one side. “You did give me the wrong impression. I put you up, for free, mind you… why would I do that?”
“Hm,” Sherlock rolled his eyes. “What can I say, it’s not every day you get gifted some Victorian poison samples.”
Sherlock’s mother cried and squealed with what Sherlock took to be relief. She congratulated them both, and then did big sobs about her own mate not being alive to see this. Mycroft played the part of the older brother perfectly, shaking hands and offering vague threats about Sherlock’s safety, which Magnussen jovially laughed away.
“Yes, the last holiday before my funeral,” Sherlock shrugged. The clip beeped, and John took it away.
Sherlock said a polite goodbye, as did his parents, and the Watsons drove away with loud sighs of relief from John’s parents.
“Well… Happy Birthday, John,” Sherlock brought the cake, with sixteen candles on, over so John was close enough to blow. “Make a wish?”
“Well, it’s not the actual day,” John reasoned, pulling his dressing gown closer. He’d had a bubble bath, and was feeling fluffy and soft, the last drops of panic from his attack the night before all but gone down the plug hole with the water.
“Bedroom,” Sherlock shuddered, his body tensing as John splashed water over him. “John – John, I’m – I’m doing something but I can’t stop it –”
“Only to say goodbye. He’s taking your mother away, I understand?” John clipped a plastic peg onto Sherlock’s finger. His skin was a little dry. John made a mental note to check his fluid intake.
“I was using it to forget,” Sherlock said. He stubbed the fag out. “Or… no, not forget. To… lower my thinking power.”
John had elected not to find out his baby’s sex. He wondered idly what would happen if he had a girl, and dressed her in blue. People would assume she was a boy, that’s what. He rolled his eyes, and picked up a multipack of white vests, some grey sleepsuits, a tiny hat, some scratch mitts, a snowsuit…
“I,” Sherlock said, planting a kiss between each word, “I – am – well – prepared – to – put – in – the – practice…” he kissed down John’s body, down to his bump, scenting over the stretched skin gently, kissing tiny presses of his lips, leaving a trail of goosebumps where he went.
Siger nodded. “Violet, let us see about a pot of tea,” he said, with as much enthusiasm as a dead hedgehog.
“Fuck…” John let go with one hand, and stroked the other up Sherlock’s full length. “Fuck, I just…” He looked desperately at the bed.
John pulled a doubtful face. “A smile doesn’t mean you’re giving me permission to be a dick, Sherlock. And neither does a kiss. It’s not a door-open or door-shut situation. Besides,” he shrugged, “I don’t know about you, but I’m not ready for that.” He looked away, his brain throwing up some choice images.
“As well as being a cockslut omega whore,” Sherlock drawled, his not-fully-broken voice slipping over the swear-words.
He was increasingly convinced that he was in love with John. That was a fact he couldn’t avoid thinking about for too much longer. But the thing inside him? Sherlock did not love that. In a way, it helped that John didn’t think he loved the baby (yet), either. It felt like an intruder into their relationship. Sherlock was accepting it in the way you might accept that your partner had a habit of talking in their sleep, or texting with the keyboard tones on. He wasn’t accepting the baby out of love, or the want to be a parent.
“You are all of those things, John. And more.” Melody wrote something down. “I want you to think about what you’ve just told me, and I want you to know that we are stopping talking about it, now. That doesn’t mean it didn’t happen, and it doesn’t mean that it’s forgotten. It means that the time to talk about that is done, for today. It’s time, now, to revisit your memory of Sherlock, and Lucy.”
“I don’t know,” John said. “That’s my honest answer. I don’t know what I think. It’s difficult, because… I know what happens physically. I’ve seen it. And… if I ever believed in anything, it’s difficult to keep on believing it once you’ve seen someone… go.”
“You can’t honestly think you can lie to me.” Mycroft glanced towards the door. “Do what you like in private, but you need to include your family in things like this. And why haven’t you bonded with him?”
John stared. “You don’t think that after this week, and what happened the other night... you don’t think I give a damn?”
“You’ve got me,” Sherlock smiled, parting his legs for John to settle in between. “Long as you want me.”
What was difficult to specify was in what capacity. Certainly John missed Sherlock’s presence – him beavering around the flat, eating things and leaving half-full cups of tea around. But he also missed the warm feeling his scent roused within him. He missed the closeness of the omega. How clever he was. How polite, and yet learning not to be. How rude, and quick and witty and how he’d let John touch his hair, and they’d sit close enough to feel one another’s warmth, but not touch – never touch. John had wanted to, though. So badly he wanted to feel the flex of Sherlock’s muscles under his hand, to feel the smoothness of his skin, the flecks of leg-hair under the pads of his fingers.
Sherlock looked the same and not. He was thinner, more gaunt, wearing smarter clothes, but he was the same.
They walked from the lab to the café. The bar was closed, so they used the coffee machines and took their drinks out to the balcony. The summer night was warm, and the traffic below was moving quickly, for London. The smell of petrol and tarmac drifted up, and Sherlock relished how much he adored the city. Three years of their undergraduate degree, and he’d never felt more free. Mycroft was off his back, in some big job at the government, and Sherlock was able to indulge his passions for learning, for problem-solving, and even for music. Not performing, of course – though his injury had long-since healed, there was a tiny tremor in his left hand that only a conductor would hear. A casual listener would think him perfect.
“…she looked sick. And she was unkind, with it. And Sherry told me about you wanting to… yeah, you know. That seemed frightening. Sherlock gave me some books to read, about puberty, and so on.”
John looked at the hand over both of his own, and wished he were tiny enough to curl up on the palm and live in Sherlock’s pocket for a while.
“I know. I’m fine,” John said. He was sitting right on the edge of his armchair, like he was preparing to spring off. Sherlock had never seen him so on edge. “Sherlock, I… This..” he stopped, and ran a hand over his chin, pressing a finger to his lips as he thought.
“I meant that top – it’s far too…” she frowned, looking at his flat chest. “Sherlock, what in God’s name…”
to take responsibility,” John said. “I want him to be with me because he wants to be. Not because of bites and heats and genders.”
“Oh god,” John said, wincing as a rush of come exited him as Sherlock withdrew his hectocotylus. “Oh god, Sherlock…”
After everything that had happened, all his and Sherlock and Mycroft’s efforts to look after him, get him out of the manor, save him from Siger, get over his nightmares and achieve well in school… it was all pointless. He was still going to amount to nothing.
John drove to the Holmes’ London home the next day. There was, as he had predicted, no public space to park his car, though the hospital had issued him with a permit, so he gleefully pulled up outside the large white mid-terrace, and rather enjoyed the sight of his little red hatchback in between the glossy silver machines of the neighbours.
“Fuck off!” Sherlock spat, and the driver snarled, pulling away. “Oh god…!” Sherlock doubled over again. His arse cheeks felt damp, and he realised he was going to start leaking. He didn’t have
“Yes,’ John agreed, “it is. But as much as I hate to admit it, Mycroft is right. We can’t prove I should keep Birdie because she is mine. We have to prove that a – that a man who…” He stopped, and steeled himself. “Adrian Mayhew raped me, and that’s why he shouldn’t be allowed in the same room as Birdie.”
Sherlock watched John’s fuzzy outline through the frosted glass in the door. He knew the man’s shape, by now. Short, round of head, a semi-prominent nose that wasn’t off-putting – it gave the face character. Sherlock watched from his bed as the doctor raised a hand and touched the back of his own neck. A nervous habit. Sherlock didn’t mind it.
Sherlock nodded, but there was a small frown on his face. “Pain… all times?” he asked, scratching up language.
“Well, there’s not many female names on our side,” Mycroft mused. “Our parents both had male-male parents, so we never had any female grandmothers.”
“You wouldn’t want a broken omega, anyway,” John said, picking up his jacket. “I shouldn’t have come here. I’m – I’m sorry for putting you in this position.”
“No, I… just walked…” Sherlock moved his hand, and a fresh wash of blood moved from the released pressure.
“Come on,” Mycroft put an arm around him. The first time he’d done so since they were very small. Sherlock couldn’t protest. He couldn’t think beyond staring at his ruined hand, and wondering how he would ever pick up his violin again.
Mycroft opened it a moment later. He was wearing a burgundy dressing gown. “John. The hour is not precisely –”
John did not torment him for long, pushing a finger inside him with purpose, slicking up his hole and his insides, retreating for more lube before repeating the motion.
Perhaps the annoyance stuck with him, because when it came to ordering the Chinese food for dinner, Sherlock called the restaurant and asked for ‘one of each’ before charging it to Mycroft’s card.
“I was training, Sherlock. You know that. I was training to be a doctor. It’s been my dream, and I’m so lucky to be where I am, with it. I couldn’t just go AWOL. I thought you hated me.”
,” John said, putting his head in his hands. “I just want to live and go to school and play games and grow up. I don’t want all this legal stuff. I just want to go
“I didn’t know you were there, I was off my head,” John smiled, then winced as his insides complained again. “That’s not something I want to repeat…” he looked up. “The time, I mean, between heats, it was so long since –”
Sherlock leapt up, and put a hand on his clenched fist. “John, don’t. This is what he wants. Drop him.”
Or, at least, to Euston, where the traffic ground to a halt. He paid the driver and got out, walking the rest of the way. He had the eerie sensation that he was being watched as he ducked through the crowds of tourists and shoppers, the cold biting through his thin jumper – he hadn’t had a coat with him when he got in the ambulance.
John had no answer. He just held Sherlock close, and kissed his hair, and tried not to grip the young man in his arms too tight. He wanted to experience so much with this broken human. He wanted them to go dancing. To watch the sun rise in a country neither of them were born in. He wanted
“I didn’t mean it like…” John sighed, and dropped his hands. “I don’t want you to storm up to him like king of the alphas and knock his head off. I don’t want that.”
“Then order what you need,” Mycroft said. “And make sure it’s delivered before Mummy and Father come home.”
happen at school,” Sherlock said suddenly, looking up from his laptop, “you have to come and get me, straight away. Even if you’re at work.”
“That’s not an issue,” Greg shrugged, “it would just count towards your hours. You’d be better off, financially. Pension, benefits, that sort of thing?”
Sherlock wet his lips with his tongue. A sort of heat was gathering over his skin and condensing at his groin. His own cock was starting to ache, and he pressed the palm of his hand to it as John got closer, not bothering to hide his arousal over the sight in front of him.
John was relieved of his oxygen mask, and without it, quickly fell asleep again before he got to the lift.
“Here,” Sherlock reached over him, and clipped him in. “Don’t want you going flying through the windscreen, do we?”
John nodded, and patted her, waving her car goodbye, and knowing it was never going to happen. He was stuck here, stuck in this life, forever.
‘I’m not looking for a mate,’ Sherlock clarified. ‘But I’m not not looking for one, either. I don’t know how else I can live the life I want.’
Sherlock smiled. ‘Thank you. I know he thought a lot of you. Cam.’ The nickname, once so easily applied, now tasted sour.
“Oh god,” John gasped a tingle of desire running through him, like heat and electricity, running down his body, pooling at his crotch. Sherlock’s lips were on his throat. “Sherlock…”
He had been so relived to leave his last school. The problem was, you couldn’t re-invent yourself if everyone knew you from when you were small. They’d seen him growing up, wearing sundresses and having his long dark curls woven into plaits. So when Sherlock started trying to change… they noticed. Even if he still had long hair, and had to wear girls’ trousers, and didn’t wear makeup, and used a sports bra and t-shirt to flatten his chest, and lost weight so the curves of his hips would be less obvious…
He was being kept artificially alive. He should be dead, but that fucker in the sharp suit wouldn’t let him die. It was… awful.
“Ha,” John’s captor laughed. “You do amuse me, Sebastian. Little children? They’re such a waste, there’s hardly anything in them.”
John felt himself beginning to blush. ‘Sorry for charging in like a bull. I didn’t mean to… you could handle yourself I’m sure.’
You could tell, now, if you knew what you were looking for. John had arrived at Baker Street with a washboard stomach and an army-boy stance. He now had a tiny curve of the belly, and he walked with a slight roll of his hips.
Someone was coming to greet his father, and John was half-tempted to ignore them until his mother steered him into place around the car.
“Julian Kingsley,” Julian leapt up to shake hands, almost knocking Molly out of her seat. “I’m here with Molly. Molly Hooper. She’s my girlfriend.”
John was just completing some paperwork at the nurses’ station, when Mycroft Holmes coughed to get his attention.
“That’s alright,” Sherlock gave a sideways, sad sort of smile. “We could have done something more special –”
“It’s not that I don’t want tuition,” Sherlock said quickly, “but my parents… they won’t even let me see John anymore, and –”
"You altered some of the documents concerning the dead man," Sherlock said, jumping straight in without preamble.
That sounded like she wanted more to put John on display than to show him where to find this other boy.
He shifted in the water again, humming as the weight of his body and the water made it difficult. The ache came back, accompanied by shivers, despite the warm water. He’d have to get out, soon.
Sherlock didn’t answer. The truth was, no omega could say they were unhappy with their mate. Not publicly, anyway.
No one told him being pregnant was this exhausting, especially when he was only six or seven weeks along.
Sherlock ignored every text and call from Molly over the summer. He took his grade – a flat 2:2 – and disappeared from his previous life.
“Mm. I’m not a fan. Feels too much like a doomsday novel.” John shifted his weight, and let out a soft groan at the back of his throat.
John knelt down, and took Sherlock’s hands, holding them both firmly in his own. “Sherlock, that’s enough.”
Sherlock’s orgasm came as John thrust inside him again, making him sob with the sweet loss of control, his cock spilling over, white ropes of ejaculate hitting the bed as John gave in his fight with his own body, and held Sherlock’s hips still as he thrust quick – snaps of his hips that sent the alpha over the edge – and came deep inside the young man’s body, making him moan again.
Behind him, James cleared his throat loudly. “You must be Sherlock Holmes,” he said, with great civility, considering the opinions John knew he held about Sherlock, and the fact he’d turned up uninvited on the doorstep.
John turned, to see Sherlock touching one of the fleshy flowers with finger and thumb. He pinched it hard, and the pink petal bruised, and went dark. “I’m going out, tonight,” he said.
A growl crawled up John’s throat, and rumbled in his chest. He rolled his shoulders back, trying to gather himself as Sherlock went still – letting the alpha in the room see he wasn’t a threat. He was responding more easily, now, his growing mind and body recognising the threat an angry alpha could pose to him.
“Sherlock, I do want to apologise. I was a stupid kid, and I didn’t think about what leaving… would do to… us.”
“Will do.” John let Sherlock out, and followed him, hailing a cab to get to his shift at the walk-in centre.
“It’s cliché,” John smiled, “but when you get older, you’ll realise. I used to think I’d be the calmest, most polite alpha doctor ever. Then I matured and joined the army and started fights and my parents said it was like I’d been replaced, until I learned to control it.”
The sun lingered, so they caught a cab to the south bank, and grabbed some pizza from a kiosk claiming to be selling ‘handmade and organic’ food. Sherlock looked doubtfully at it, but had to agree it was delicious, as they sat on one of the stone benches and watcher the river-taxis and yachts storm up and down the water.
“I’d rather not drain them to the point they can’t be saved,” he replied. “Not if they don’t deserve it.”
Sherlock has never been called for a day in his entire life. He knew, instinctually, that to ask his father for permission was what he ought to do, but at the same time, he knew it would result in a ‘no’. So he kept his eyes on the boy in front of him. “…yes.”
John smiled at him. “Well, that depends. Technically, your doctor can’t take you outside for a smoke, but you are allowed out for free time whenever you like.”
Sherlock wished to every god mankind had ever conjured up that he could smell it more clearly. If he could identify Victor as bonded, he wouldn’t now be looking at him with pain lancing through his body like steel flames. He wouldn’t be looking over the body of the boy – now man – he loved with a twisted kind of torment that made him feel sick and desperate.
Sherlock’s nausea swelled in his throat. ‘I don’t… I don’t think I helped,’ he whispered. ‘There was one time… a few years ago, when…’ he swallowed hard, his mouth filling with saliva.
“Stop looking so bloody gorgeous,” he snarled, pulling Sherlock forward to scent the skin of his throat.
He woke up early, the alpha smell in his nostrils making him panic in the low light before he remembered where he was. He sat up, dragging his hands over his face before checking the time. Just gone six.
“As opposed to you, who spent the afternoon being… and you’re sitting drinking tea like everything’s fine,” Sherlock countered.
“No,” Sherlock said, “but the first blood is so important, it’s as though your body is designed to reject anything else for a long time. Violently so.”
“Shit,” John struggled out of the covers, and yanked on his trousers, trying not to think about gravity and how shagged-out he probably looked. He went to the door, and opened it barely a crack. “Yes?”
“Er, yes. Two, in fact,” Siger said, not knowing quite how to deal with a child who hadn’t addressed him as ‘sir’, and looked as though he might run between his legs and straight into the hall.
John could feel James' cock hardening further in his mouth, and he had no desire to choke. He gripped the base suddenly, pulling off against the force of James' hands, and pulled him through his orgasm. Come splattered onto John's chest and neck.
“You’re not poor, are you?” Sherlock asked, trying in vain to make a string of cheese snap between his mouth and the pizza slice he held.
Sherlock pressed his lips together. “Yes, you made your priorities quite clear. John – you’re my mate. That’s a biological, legal fact. But we aren’t children, anymore. I think we need to come to terms with the fact that we want different things.”
“You’re so studious. Envy of the other students, I bet…” Cam stopped to touch a curved thorn on a rose-bush. The thorn pressed against the pad of his thumb, but didn’t puncture the skin. “Would you say so?”
The name struck John like another bullet. For a moment, he felt as though he had moved outside of his own body and could see himself slumping on the sofa in horror, his face pale and eyes wide, before he rushed back into himself and every sick feeling he had ever had came with it. He looked at Birdie. “No.”
Sherlock got out of the shower that evening, knotting the towel around his waist as he went over to the sinks to do his teeth. He wiped the steam away, sighing at the sight of his breasts, before getting his toothbrush.
‘Please don’t,’ Sherlock put a finger to his lips. ‘Please don’t, John. You can’t take it back once…’ He sniffed hard, his liner-ed eyes shining. ‘You’ve got this chance to be a doctor, a soldier, everything you wanted. You can be a great man, and you don’t need me lurking in your shadow. You really don’t.’
Then more insistent, Sherlock’s arms locking around John’s neck as their mouths opened in the sort of synchronicity that shouldn’t exist outside of films. Sherlock’s knees wobbled, and John braced them both, holding Sherlock so close he could feel the flutter of his heart in the cage of his bones, the heat from his face and neck as he blushed with intimacy.
Sherlock had read about bonding bites. Centuries of research, and they still weren’t fully understood. They were more than an outward sign of claiming, of having a mate. They were a spiritual bond, a tying-together of two people, unbreakable except through death. The love they caused was deep and unshakable.
“It’s 6:30am,” Sherlock clarified. “I’ve gotten you up early so you can open your presents before school.”
John was mortified. He'd actually orgasmed from the creature's attentions. He'd had no control over himself at all. This was appalling. This had to be a dream. Perhaps if he shut his eyes tight enough he would wake up…
“Anyway,” Greg didn’t seem to notice, “I think we can keep you on, because basically we can’t sack anyone who’s pregnant. However,” he raised a finger, “I need to take you off service at the station.”
Sherlock undressed as he went up their stairs, dropping his shoes, jacket, shirt, trousers and underwear off before he even got into the lounge. No John.
Detective Inspector Lestrade had eventually persuaded John to come out from under the table, and had taken ‘a statement’ from him, delivered tonelessly as John looked at the kitchen tiles. Mycroft had then written a statement, and Lestrade had told John not to worry, he’d have his place of address corrected in no time.
Sherlock was at the table, typing something on his laptop. He smiled at John when he came in, and John smiled back.
"So...” John swallowed. “How does this go. I just… sit down and let you have a go?" He sounded bitter, somewhat resigned as he spoke this time.
There’s a synchronicity that only exists in movies. You don’t see it in real life, and John had always scoffed at it. And yet here it is, happening right now as he leans up and Sherlock leans down, and their noses brush, finding their way.
“I’m really sorry,” Sherlock covered his eyes with one hand, gripping John’s fingers with the other. “I… I’m not –”
John backed away from the banter, blushing as he cottoned onto what the older boys were talking about. The bell rang, thankfully, and the group broke apart, Mike and John heading for their tutor group as the older boys want off, punching each other and laughing. It was weird – John was almost scared of how rough they were with one another, but at the same time they were so easy and happy in their friendship. John had Mike, but he didn’t really have anyone like that.
“You’ve said,” Sherlock looked up and gave a tiny smile. He laced his long fingers together, and John wondered if his spidery hands were an indicator of how much height the omega had left to gain. “I was wondering…”
They lay stupidly for a moment, smirking at each other, before Sherlock came forward, cupping John’s face with a hand, and kissing him gently, softly, as if the slightest pressure would make him shatter beneath his touch. Their lips grazed in a tracing heat before parting, tongue slipping in to explore with a familiar sensuality. Sherlock’s hand gripped John’s hip as his own pelvis rocked forward, hardness meeting growing hardness beneath their pyjamas, and the blankets.
John caught him by the elbows. “Sherlock Watson-Holmes, you do not look horrible. You look bloody gorgeous, and you’re going to end up so beautiful you drive me insane!”
“Pressed my buzzer for some morphine in the small hours…” Sherlock pushed himself off the bed, and smirked slightly as he went from looking up at John to looking down at him. “But I think I’ll be fine for a few hours without, today.”
“No, that took a few seconds, but after your scan I had to go to Belgium for a few days for a case,” Sherlock shrugged. “The aftermath of the, er, break-up took several days. And isn’t resolved.”
James followed his eye-line. Then looked up in shock as he read the heading on the booklet. “Oh! Oh, right,” he swallowed. “Well… congrats.” His good eye flicked down to John’s flat stomach.
He snatched the file, and Lestrade grinned as he explained. "Suspicious death of one of our soldiers. It's suspected to be an inside job. But made to look like some of the locals did it. The setup is very strange… The locals weren’t meant to be hostile – they were close to reaching an understanding with our troops. Their leader had been meeting with the major-"
He swallowed, his throat so swollen he had to check how it felt on the outside, but moving his arms was so painful he cried out. He fumbled stiffly for the morphine-drip button, then realised it had dropped to the floor in the night.
Sherlock crossed the room, and planted a final kiss on John’s forehead. “I’ll be back tomorrow,” he said gently. “As soon as I can.”
The movie played on, and John paid less and less attention, his mind slipping into unconsciousness as he relaxed more than he had in months, eventually falling asleep.
Mycroft nodded, and sat back. “Very well. You’ll forgive the overprotectiveness... as I say, Sherlock doesn’t make an impression on many people... at least not one where the other person would wish to keep in touch. Without some sort of motive.”
Sherlock watched John walk awkwardly to the en suite. He sat up when the door closed, and gave his hand a wipe with the antibacterial wipes he kept beside the bed. There was nothing to be done about the bedclothes. They’d just have to be washed.
“So, how was school?” Charles sat in the chair Sherlock had been sat on the arm of. He indicated the arm again, and Sherlock hesitantly leaned against it. “Did you learn anything?”
"He said you were out." John put his forehead on his arms, on the desk. "I figured I'd best just go home."
He pedalled hard up the rising drive to Sherlock’s house, skidding over the gravel as he dismounted, and parked his bike up at the side of the house. He smoothed his hair, took the little gift bag from under his jacket, and rang the bell. His heart was jumping as he waited, hoping to gods that Sherlock would be the one to answer the door.
John almost said. Almost blurted it all out, right then and there. Then he glanced up. There was a group of alpha boys a few lanes down, obviously looking over at the omegas. One of them nudged the other, and made an obscene gesture. They laughed.
“Need to be taught a thing or two, I reckon,” an alpha breathed rotten breath over his face. “Already let someone stick it in you, haven’t you? What happened to him? Did he realise what a whore you are? Or were you too loose for him, being so old?”
“Not exactly,” Sherlock said. “This is only tobacco. But it’s…. soothing? It’s purely my brain responding happily to the drug, of course. It wouldn’t work on you.”
"The coroner will be there anyway," John pointed out. "It's the last time of the day to eat - everyone goes."
There was no sign of Eurus as Sherlock and John ate toast and marmalade in the kitchen the next morning. Mycroft was leaning against the counter, looking as if he hadn’t slept for days as he typed on his laptop.
John woke the next morning feeling distinctly sore from sleeping on the seaweed-covered rock all night. He moved slightly, then flinched in shock at the pressure of the tentacles –
,” Sherlock drawled, letting John pull him close and scent his throat. “Hmm, I thought I was supposed to be the vampire around here?”
Sherlock nodded, and swam to the back of the boat. Without warning he grabbed the loops of rope there, and pulling hard, dragging John and his boat effortlessly through the water to a collection of stalagmites. There were no hiding rocks to collide with, and beside Sherlock was a more accurate judge than an oar. The stalagmites made ideal points for a knot of rope, and John quickly hitched up the boat, before collecting his things and standing. He was still floating several feet away from the outcrop.
“And I’m certain a great many Londoners will sympathise,” Sherlock shrugged. John hid a grin behind his hand. “Come on, Lestrade, you can’t tell me this is the most interesting thing you’ve got.”
“Sorry, dear,” the nurse said. “You can’t control pain relief if you’ve ever had an opiate addiction.” She inserted a key into the machine and turned the levels up. “Doctor’s orders.”
Sherlock killed his victim. Unfortunately for her, she was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. Humans should know not to walk down alleyways in the twilight. Not a mistake she would make again, anyway. Sherlock took everything he could from her, but it wasn’t enough. A sort of rage was building up inside him – rage at himself and rage at the world – and he wanted to kill again. So he did. This time, an old man returning from shopping. The man saw him coming and begged for his life, but Sherlock ignored the human pleas and only let go when the man’s heart stopped beating.
“Doesn’t mean people don’t like to get trimmed up,” his father said. “Makes the place look lived-in.”
“We’re not all emotionally constipated,” Sherlock shot back, but his eyes were glittering with good-humour. “Don’t you have paperwork that needs doing?”
“Yes, but…” Sherlock hugged the cushion harder. “I miss him. I…” he screwed up his face, hard, fighting back the threatening tears. His throat and chest hurt, and he wanted to scream into the cushion, throw it at his brother, tell him to fuck off, beg him to hold him.
Sherlock smiled, and kissed him. “I love you.” He moved his hand away, his fingers damp with John’s slick, and took hold of their erections again, making John shudder in pleasure. “Your body knows what it wants.”
Rightly so, Sherlock thought. He turned, and made himself look his brother in the face. ‘Magnussen,’ he said.
Sherlock’s smile softened. He shifted closer, coming to rest his cheek on John’s chest. John sleepily dropped his arm down to hold Sherlock close.
“Glad to hear it. Have you seen my keys?” John wandered into the kitchen. He was wearing his ordinary jeans, and a jumper. The jumper had a hole on the hem. These weren’t John’s date clothes, were they?
John felt something swoop behind his stomach. It was a strange feeling. Almost like nerves. But Sherlock didn’t make him nervous.
“Well, he was right, a bit, wasn’t he?” John said after a few quiet sips. “I am going to die. Eventually. Even if we... stay... like this,” he blushed, not really enjoying thinking about what a breakup with a vampire might entail. “Together, I mean. Not that I’m saying we won’t, but even if we do... it’ll end, at some point. For you.”
He covered his face with his hands, fighting back tears. If he was going to have a shot at getting Sherlock back, the last thing he needed was to turn up with a big belly and a truckload of guilt.
And it hurt. Sherlock felt as if he was being strangled. He wished so badly he could somehow vanish the thing inside John, make it not there, make their kisses and their sex last night the prelude to something else, but he couldn’t. Every time he replayed last night in his head, he saw John’s shirt straining over the bump. He felt it pressed against his own flat stomach. And he didn’t mind that it existed. He didn’t mind it was John’s.
“God, no,” Sherlock said. Then considered. “I do wonder, though. What would have happened, had we not met when we did. If your parents were never… If you were brought up by your own parents. If we had met when you were sixteen, and me twenty-one.”
When John was about nine, he wanted to be a doctor. He wanted it almost as much as he wanted to be a soldier, and was thrilled when he learned that he could do both. By now, he was somewhat smaller than his classmates, and people assumed he would grow up to be a beta. Still a soldier, and a doctor, too.
And indeed, the boy looked over properly, and raised his eyebrows. He did look young – he looked clever, too, with sharp eyes and high cheekbones, and dark hair that looked choppy and messy. He didn’t look as though he smiled often, but John could have guessed that, by now.
“Then we’ll be quick,” Sherlock countered, going to kiss at John’s neck, making the omega shudder and lean into the scenting, the tiny licks and nips.
“I think you are, you’re growing upward like a weed, but you’re very young for an omega to go into heat naturally,” Victor said. “I don’t think your insides are… developed enough.”
They were picked up by the private car when they got outside. Mycroft wrote an email on his phone, and Sherlock fell asleep almost immediately.
John smiled. “I’m thirty-four, Sherlock, I get lectured about bonding every time I see the GP, my sister, friends… sorry if it seems a bit lewd.”
“Oh,” John let his head roll back. Then groaned as Sherlock reached between them, took them both in hand and
talk a lot about babies and food technology and household accounting. Out of all of Sherlock’s classmates, he only knew one other omega who was interested in going on to higher education. He wondered if Molly knew she needed a sponsor.
“Really?” he frowned. It wasn’t visiting hours, yet, and Sherlock and Mycroft didn’t tend to stick to them, anyway. “Who is it?”
Sherlock snorted, oblivious to what John had been thinking. “Nothing has to change, as far as I’m concerned. They can’t stop me sneaking out.”
“Good boy. You can be such a good omega. We don’t have to let anyone know about this slip-up.” Cam patted his hair.
John made a noise of frustration before Sherlock shoved a hand between them both, palm over the stiff line in John’s jeans, and pressed hard as he thrust up again. This time, John’s moan matched Sherlock’s, and they quickly settled into a rhythm, Sherlock moving and pressing as John rocked back and forth, the friction sweet and the pressure sweeter, even as Sherlock breathed hot against his neck, inhaling the omega scent that must be driving him mad. John couldn’t find it in himself to protest, and even leant his head to one side to made it easier for Sherlock to bury his nose and mouth in the crook.
“I’ll go to some paperwork of my own, and I’ll come back in a short while,” John said firmly. He looked at the detective inspector. “You can come to the desk if you need anything, or Sherlock has a buzzer.”
Sherlock smirked. ‘Thanks for the rescue.’ He looked tired – his eyes were red, and his face was thin, and his longish hair lank as though he hadn’t showered. He was still taller than John, but not by much, but he was thinner than before. His eyes raked John up and down, and his nostrils flared. ‘Oh,’ he said softly.
John had to admit, Sherlock would probably be kind. He had been, when John was sick in the past. He ran a hand over his chest, noticing that his nipples had darkened, just a little. His stomach was still flat, but had lost some of the definition it had had twelve weeks ago. And crunches weren’t recommended in the second trimester. John sighed, and poked himself. He was going to miss his washboard stomach. Omegas were expected to be soft and curvy, and John never had been – a lifetime of sports and exercise, along with his genes, had seen to that. At least he could keep his arms and legs in check. He made a mental note to go to the gym after work.
Sherlock laughed softly, his soft touches making John relax. “I suppose they’re glad you’re staying.”
"Then I won't," Sherlock said, gripping the back of John's neck firmly, but not forcefully, and guiding his head back. Sherlock took his lips, hard and wanting, hopefully conveying to John the same message John had revealed to him.
“Thank you,” he said to no one, taking the tea that was left on the side. He leaned against the hidden fridge, and looked at Sherlock again.
“I’m not asking to stay,” John said quickly, mentally rolling his eyes at the confirmation that Sherlock’s text had been a lie. “I just… I don’t have…”
John couldn’t speak. It was as though his head was empty, and Eurus was pouring words into it, filling him up, drowning his objections in half-truths and the past.
“Har har, I have missed your wit,” John leaned against the doorframe. “And don’t get your bloomers in a twist – Sherlock told me to get out. So, here I am.”
“Yes, my angel, my beautiful…” Sherlock kissed his ears, his jaw, his cheeks. “I’m so sorry I kept you waiting… something happened… I didn’t see…”
“I might feel like it upstairs, though,” the alpha added. “If you wanted to find out.” He trotted up the staircase and disappeared.
John could feel his own breath coming in little shaky pants, his arms were trembling, just enough to make this scary, as well as lovely.
to feel like a soft massage, that had Sherlock searching for more, copying the motion as John pressed their chests together, his legs squeezing just a little at Sherlock’s pelvis as their kiss continued. Ah. No wonder he had found the mouth-press amusing. A
Sherlock couldn’t keep his hips still, twitching them back and forth to fuck John’s mouth, his breath coming in little moans that he didn’t seem capable of stopping.
“Erm…” Victor swallowed hard, his eyes flicking to John, who must have been looking murderous and probably smelling of pure possessive jealousy. “Yeah, it’s an essay. Miss Poppy wants it back by Monday to make up for you missing these two days…” he zipped up his bag. “How’ve you found it? Your eye looks pretty bruised.”
“This is hardly hell,” John said. He pointed at the picture on the presentation. “That, however, is definitely hell.” He looked around for an escape route.
John narrowed his eyes. “It wasn’t what I thought would happen, but you stopped. So, it’s fine. But you seem bothered about it. Are you upset I said stop?”
“That’s great,” John said. He was extremely used to looking up “So… did you have a plan for today? Or any –”
“Two-two-one…” Sherlock moaned as he finger-fucked himself, no longer caring for his dignity. If he’d chanced the cab with the alpha driver… He could be begging for a knot, right now.
“Not even once!” They were wrestling properly, now, Sherlock trying to grab John’s wrists as John batted him away easily, their legs starting to tangle as the mood lightened. They laughed and fell sideways, only stopping when Sherlock hissed in pain with his leg.
Sherlock shook his head. ‘John would hate that. He has an appointment, next week, about going back on his suppressants. I’m not going to suggest we do something that would mark him as an omega forever.’
“And yes, that does include your internet history,” John rolled his eyes. “You still want to jump into the Thames?”
“Yes,” he nodded, against Sherlock’s skin, and Sherlock responded by thickening his tentacle, increasing the penetrating limb inside John, and moving within him, in and out, curling and expanding, slimming and stretching in a rhythmic dance that left John breathless. Slick from the appendage was making it easy for the tentacle to explore him, and the way it
Sherlock stopped what he was doing. He didn't look up, for a moment. When he did, he stood straight and took a breath. "I told you before that it was fine to tell you about my past because I would be leaving soon anyways. I thought it would be fine. I've always been fine. For 500 years I've never been anything less than fine.”
“Fucksake. I pick you up for fighting, yet again, and you’ve been smoking drugs. What else have you been up to, today?”
John would have been upset that Sherlock had done that. He would have been angry with him. But Sherlock had thought he might forgive him. If he’d only listened…
“They don’t have anosmia, though.” John kissed him again. “Besides, what if they find out your room wasn’t slept in?”
Sherlock shook his head. “You’ve got nothing to be sorry for.” He kissed John’s forehead. “I… I thought I’d…” he couldn’t speak, so stopped trying, and kissed John again. “John…”
“Come on, then,” John took a step backwards, and Sherlock stepped out of the doorway. “I was going to explore the garden, first,” he said. “We didn’t get much chance to look at it when we came to see the new house, and it looks pretty big. I’m going to build a den in it, and maybe a tree-house, and we should make some bug hotels, and…” he scratched his head. “I’m John. What’s your name?”
“I made it clear that whilst your pregnancy is a factor in our coming together… I doubt I could have kept away from you forever, even without needing to be with you for your heats.”
John had to smile. “Er, no. I don’t think so. I’ve got a scan in four weeks. Throwing up only in the mornings, now…” He smiled wider at Sherlock’s suddenly worried expression. “Don’t panic, it’s only morning sickness.”
John made a note. “So, what respite involves is you spending a week here with us in Pal, and basically you can treat us like a hotel, within reason. Meals, going outside, TV, books, whatever, you can ask for it, and someone will sort it out. The only thing we can do is take you off-site.”
“Oh, Sherlock…” John got up and went to sit next to him, putting an arm around him quickly. “Sherlock, I’m sorry.”
John knew he liked boys as well as girls, but he’d never acted on the former – he was well aware that he had enough to deal with with being poor, and struggling to get his homework done when he had to do it in bed, by torchlight, as his dad crashed through the door at 3am, his sister usually following. Being a doctor was his ticket out of there, and John was well aware his grades could slip at any moment.
John thought for a moment, looking between them, at how close they were. He didn't look Sherlock in the eye this time. "Do you want someone to miss you?"
Sherlock directed himself and John to a bench. He sat down rather heavily, and immediately took out a pack of cigarettes.
Sherlock nodded, and put it in his own blazer, feeling it bump against the sweeties John had given him.
How Lestrade ever got to be a Detective Inspector, Sherlock had no idea. He missed the most obvious clues, even when they were right under his nose. Sherlock found himself pointing out obvious signs of belladonna poisoning and windows that had been smashed by a fist rather than a rock almost every time Lestrade took him out. Which was rapidly every time he was at the station.
A better day had been Birdie’s adoption. The paperwork had been long, and slow. But when the certificate finally arrived, approved and cleared, there had been a spontaneous party at Baker Street. They were still finding glitter down the sides of the sofa cushions.
John sighed. “Look, it’s fine. We just… needed this chat, I think.” He rubbed the back of his neck. His face was still on fire. “I’m not trying to say I don’t like you, you know.”
Nearly ten days went by, and John’s returned morning sickness waned after a couple of days, letting him sleep properly again, though he was already struggling to sleep on his front, as he preferred – he ended up on his side, sleeping on his bad shoulder and having to get James to rub deep heat or ibuprofen gel into the joint in the mornings. It hurt so badly he didn’t even think about the fact an alpha who wasn’t his mate was touching his bare skin. This went on for a week until John bought a special pillow, and solved the problem, at least for the time being.
But that night, the booklet for Sherlock’s graduation lying forgotten, John stretched out his limbs, relaxing his legs so his bare feet crept down Sherlock’s legs, stopping midway down the alpha’s calves as the omega let his arms and shoulders relax, and turned his head to one side, hugging Sherlock back, as much as he could without wedging his hands underneath him.
Sherlock went and sat around the back of the gym. Or at least, that was his plan. He rounded the building and walked into a cloud of smoke, which made him cough.
Jim’s lip curled. “Get your brother to write that one for you? Or is he too busy sticking his fat nose where it’s not wanted?”
Sherlock’s heart suddenly ached. All those times he’d been close to John, kissed him, touched him… there was this hanging over them the whole time and Sherlock… had chosen not to see it. Because it had always been there, hadn’t it? The slight creep of his skin when Cam was around. The unnerving awkwardness in the bathroom in France. The way Cam gave him gifts, touched at his hair and arms when he tutored him.
“You have been a very good omega,” Can said, opening his arms. Sherlock went into them, settling himself on Cam’s lap as Cam held him gently. “You’ve been so good,” Cam said again. “I can’t imagine that you’d tempt the boy into anything untoward, would you?”
Sherlock was drawing a note as John spoke, but cut it off sharply at that last word. “You’re assuming I wanted a husband at all.”
When the session was over, John walked himself back to his room. His arm was throbbing, and he was worrying somewhat about finding somewhere to live.
“Uh, don’t start,” John grimaced, thinking of the therapist who had betrayed him to James Sholto. “I can’t get into that right now. Maybe after the baby.”
yours,” John repeated. “You caught her when she was born, you carried her around in a sling, you changed endless nappies and fed her her first bottle, you… you’ve been a better dad than half the dads out there.” He leaned down and kissed Sherlock firmly on the surprised mouth. “She’s always been yours, you idiot. And so have I.”
The scent of Lestrade’s blood was hot, and delicious, and Sherlock couldn’t help thinking that he must have been a fool to miss it before – clearly The Work had distracted him, but –
John was too miserable to notice Greg’s eyes on him, again. “No. No, never been bothered about that.”
“You’re both looking well,” Cam was saying to their parents as they brought up the rear in the procession. “Been away?”
“It still won’t be easy.” Sherlock straightened his scarf. “I’m going after him. I’m going to bring him home.”
Sherlock was waiting in his office, sitting on the desk, swinging his legs. “Mycroft got you,” he said, as John closed the door.
Mycroft barely reacted. ‘I can’t claim to know a lot about John Watson,’ he said, ‘but I don’t think he would stop being… whatever it is you are, over something like that.’
Sherlock smiled. “You don’t have to apologise. I spoke out of turn. I was upset. But that’s not an excuse.”
A newsreader stood outside court, speaking silently at Sherlock through the glass. She indicated behind her, and the scrolling headline at the bottom of the screen read:
"You've got an hour before the major gets here," Sherlock snapped, hauling him to his feet. "Get going."
John gave a choke of pleasure, then anticipation crackled over his skin as Sherlock leaned down and licked the tip of his cock with the point of his tongue. Sherlock’s fangs scraped gently over the sensitive and erect flesh, not drawing blood but making John shudder and moan, gripping the sheets.
They kissed, then. A kiss made of heartache and dragging dread, and the knowledge that their future was so close, and it was to be so, so short.
“I. Don’t. Know.” Sherlock folded his arms. “I don’t know. I don’t want to know. I just want a bed to sleep in, right this moment. And a house that isn’t a crack den, and a flatmate who isn’t going to rob me in my sleep. I thought you might be agreeable to that.”
“Mm,” Sherlock nodded, his backside twitching with something halfway between desperation for more and panic for it to stop. “It’s so big…”
“This one,” John said, feeling a twinge of unease. “Eurus… Sherlock and I have worked… are working… through that.”
Mycroft waited until the bell rang again, then straightened his waistcoat and went to the door, opening it on the chain. “Oh,” John heard him say in surprise. “Gregory. At this hour?”
“I wish I was,” John said. “Right, sit on the saddle, but keep your feet on the ground to start with.”
The applause came as he gave a small bow, and moved away from the middle of the room to the edge as his parents’ guests began circulating again. He carefully put the instrument away, and closed the lid.
A knock came, and a man Sherlock didn’t recognise let himself in. He was tall, and thin, with grey hair and a beard, and the sort of frameless glasses Sherlock thought made people look a bit like Father Christmas, though this was the only similarity.
If Sherlock realised, he didn’t say so. “Yes. Please post your key through the door,” he said to Victor. “And…”
Sherlock exhaled, letting the moan that had been building in his throat turn loose and vibrate through the air, a single note of longing.
John blushed, a sick guilt growing under his skin. “You know that’s a half-truth. I fancied you at first because you’re beautiful, yes. But for one, I never could have carried things on it I hadn’t been falling in love with your personality and your amazing mind. And two, you have no idea how sexy you are. Not a damn clue.” John shook his head and dropped to his knees, pressing his nose into Sherlock’s tiny bump, inhaling. “I want to scent you all the time, touch you all the time because you’re mine and she’s ours and we made her and you’re growing her and it’s just
John smiled, letting his head back to get to Sherlock’s lips, letting his alpha caress his mouth with soft lips, before planting a kiss firmly on him. “Maybe you should.”
He pulled on his dressing gown, and got out of bed, creeping out of his room and down the stairs. The house was all in darkness. He undid the back door, and slipped out into the garden, lifting the wobbly bit of fence he used to sneak into John’s garden. It was a quick (though cold) climb up onto the wheely bins, and then up onto the conservatory roof. It was a little difficult in his slippers, but he managed to steady himself, and tap on John’s window.
Uni had made Sherlock lose a bit of weight, apparently, but he was taller again, unless John wasn’t remembering him properly. He gave John a tiny smile that was probably meant to be reassuring.
“He’s gone off to bond with someone,” he said, each word like having a nail driven through his tongue. “Someone else.”
“It’d be unusual if it was anyone but Sherlock. The blood, for starters. We’ve got the place surrounded in case of scavengers, but I doubt anyone else’d be able to get that close and keep their cool…”
“He’s done nothing but complain since he started showing,” John smiled softly. “He’s worried about losing his figure… he’s terrified about the birth.”
The man took a seat, sipping at one of the drinks he held. He glanced at Sherlock. “Did you want this?” he offered the other cup. “It was two for a price.”
“I did not stop them,” he said. “Mrs Hudson returned them to you, initially. I took over after… afterwards.”
“Doesn’t mean you have to tell me everything, or give me access to everything, all at once,” John said, kissing Sherlock on the cheek. “It’s your pace, your body, Sherlock. I’ve told you, I’m not going anywhere. I love you.”
Sherlock inhaled through his nose. “It’s not on even footing, John. I already know your mother has a new family, and your dad and sister drink. You haven’t had to tell me, I can read it in your uniform, in your sleep-deprived eyebags, in the slight smell that comes from the inside of your schoolbag. I observe it.”
“Because she’s the only one Siger will go for, now,” John said, looking out of the window. “She’s… on her own.”
‘Don’t say I never give you anything,’ John breathed, rocking back on the intrusion, letting Sherlock’s cock breach him little by little. ‘And do not think this will be happening on the regular. I just… I really want to come right now, and I want you to come in me.’
As John would be living with him, James would eventually get used to the scent, and barely notice it, but alphas on the street would certainly lift their heads in interest as John’s pregnancy progressed. Being pregnant was proof that John was fertile – that he could bear children, that he was a good omega, desirable, a prize.
“I think so,” Sherlock said, blanking the phone. “I… That’s not going to be me. I mean it. I’m going to be who I am. I can’t not. I have to.”
Sadness suddenly welled up inside him, and he half-ran around the side of the house to the stables, letting himself in, and closing the door before flopping down onto the hay beside one of the horses.
“- and it was a relief to know that he wasn’t going to pursue me. I felt like I’d got away with it, it was rape but it was an omega he wanted, not me as John Watson. And now he wants my baby, I just…” his voice cracked, and he felt himself pulled close into Sherlock’s chest. Sherlock was shaking, whether with anger or distress John couldn’t be sure, but the emotional display was alien and frightening, and yet reassuring at the same time. Someone else mirrored John’s feelings. He wasn’t acting strange.
‘But he covered for you? That’s cool. Alphas usually love it when omegas make a mistake, even if it’s getting their drinks order wrong.’ Faye sniffed. Then grinned. ‘What about Mr Thorne?’
, but at least it had been with John. It would have to be enough to keep him going for a few years. It was actually a relief, Sherlock thought, that John wasn’t mature enough to bite him. Imagine explaining that to the party guests.
“I passed them all,” he looked around at John, his eyes starting to blur with fresh tears. “I… I can do it.”
“I am so sorry for not telling you sooner,” John thumbed away one of Sherlock’s tears. “Can you forgive me?”
They never said they were ‘boyfriends’. They never really talked about mating. John tried to bring the subject up, once, and Sherlock’s barriers came clanging down, hitting him with silence.
“It is ok, really,” Sherlock’s hands ran up John’s arms, touching through the wool, holding on for a moment. “I don’t mind.”
“I was an alpha who had lost his mate,” Sherlock said. “I was using drugs, and I was desperate for comfort from kin. I drank her poisonous words like they were water from a spring. On some level, I knew she was wrong. I loved you, and I had willingly let you go, but the more we spoke, and the way the ache in my heart was replaced by cold anger… it happened so gradually that by the time Mycroft realised about my drug habit, the damage was done. I fled.”
John laughed softly, looking down at the therapist rubbing something warming and peppermint-y onto his feet. “This should be weird, but honestly I never want to get out of this chair. Such a great idea, Sherry, thanks for suggesting it.”
Sherlock and John left the coffee shop, and walked out into the snow. The last dregs of the London shoppers were vanishing into cabs and busses, and the cheery Christmas lights overhead made the streets look fake and plastic.
Mycroft stopped towards Lestrade. “That’s all. I might be a poor excuse for an alpha, but I can at least protect my family. Even from other members of my family.”
He turned sideways in the mirror, squinting at his chest, trying to see if the baggy hoody hid his breasts well enough. He had smallish breasts as it was, but not small enough to pass for flat without layers. He stuck his lip out at his reflection. Was that a curve, or just how the fabric fell? Oh god, this was a nightmare. He should just put his binder back on and be done with it.
John looked down at himself, still holding Sherlock’s hand. “Do you think it’s normal not to love your baby?”
“If you’re able to talk, there is much more to do,” Sherlock murmured, his voice almost a low snarl that made John’s cock throb and his skin prickle. Sherlock grinned against his skin, and quickly rolled John onto his back, leaning over him so the vampire was all John could see, filling John’s mind and vision. He allowed John to stare for a moment, before tearing open the man’s shirt buttons in one swipe, and moving to kiss and bite fiercely at his chest.
“Well, I know yours is Sherlock,” he said. “And mine…” he offered a hand. The back of it was wrinkled, and marked with age spots near the thumb. “Mine, is Charles. That’s what you can call me. When you come to see me again.”
Sherlock dropped his own trousers, and John couldn’t help licking his lips at the tented underwear beneath. Sherlock saw him looking, and gripped at himself through his underwear, letting John see just what size of cock he was to be dealing with.
Sherlock looked away, but left his neck exposed so his mother’s slender fingers could run over the distorted skin. John could see she was trembling.
“I haven’t thought about him… in ages. I don’t even connect him with… anymore,” John said. “I mean, if anything it’s more like y…” he stopped at the flash of horror in Sherlock’s eyes. “It’s more like… yeah, I don’t know,” he finished pathetically.
Perhaps, Sherlock thought, John wasn’t coming back at all. There was every chance he had simply gone back to Lestrade’s, and would come back later. Or not at all. No, not that. John would come back to talk. He was a decent man, and he wasn’t the sort to walk out and never return.
“What does that even mean?” John threw his hands up. “He’s just a boy. I’m just a boy. You’re just a girl, and so is Clara. I don’t understand any of it.”
He was searching in a drawer when he stopped dead, a rush of fire burning over his skin, from his face, down, pooling in his stomach, making his legs shake.
“There it is,” Sherlock inhaled hard, then tried to grab John’s hair, and failed. “Your new haircut is ridiculous.”
“I don’t expect you to ever be. It’s more than a marriage, or a ring. This is… becoming someone else. For me.”
They were in the front room in Victor’s parents’ house, having been given privacy for this conversation. Mycroft wanted Sherlock to go back to John’s. He didn’t know what to do. On the one hand, he badly wanted to apologise for his behaviour running out the flat, but at the same time, John had been so angry… Even if he was now out of rut, he would be jealous and cross. He hadn’t wanted Sherlock before. Was he now just being a dog in the manger?
The room felt very calm. Soft, and quiet, and slow. People don’t realise, John thought, that it takes a long time for someone to die. And there is a lot of waiting around, at the end. It sounds callous, but it’s true. Death doesn’t snatch, it creeps, and when you have just started to have hope blossom in your heart once again, it closes in.
He sat for a moment, trying to think. He had no pads. No machine in the boys' toilets. Nothing. He couldn't sit forever, Robinson would send someone to find him, and then they would all know.
John shrugged. “Nothing much. Just told her about the baby, put in a copy of the scan photo, and told her a few things about the army. Sherlock said it wasn’t wise to include anything overly personal.”
John looked up at him. Sherlock expected him to deny it. But he didn’t. He nodded. “I am. I don’t want to be. But…” he glanced at the spot on the floor where the incident had occurred. “I can’t stop thinking about it.”
It was December. The Christmas holidays were mere weeks away, and the lesson was heavy on revision for the exams they'd be having in January.
They kissed fiercely, sloppily, without any sort of co-ordination, both of them trying to find a rhythm, and neither of them quite getting there. John opened his mouth as Sherlock licked over his lower lip, tasting the sweat of their run. John was clutching hard at Sherlock’s back, letting himself be held tight, and Sherlock felt the omega’s confusion as his body wished for him to submit but his brain did not wish to. It was arousing – moreso than Sherlock would have anticipated – and the shock of his cock responding to the kisses, of his jaw aching with the start of the need to bite…
Beside him, Sherlock breathed softly through his mouth, lips parted. He has a faint blush of sleep across his face, though the scars on his throat looked paler, less visible in the relaxation of his body.
John’s stomach rolled, and he swallowed hard, feeling his entire body tense and contract. Sherlock could do that, now. That knot thing. That… that thing… John had to do that.
“Of course you’re not,” Quinn, having left his baby at home with his mate, was texting him non-stop. “But you have to admit it’s strange.”
“I’m with Sherlock Holmes,” John said desperately, as the train – and hope – left the station. “Please, I’m not –”
“Mycroft,’ John said in surprise as he opened the door. “Sherlock isn’t in, sorry, Greg’s taken him out to play.”
“Yes, well, can you blame me for wanting to make sure you’re staying somewhere suitable?” Sherlock’s eyebrows went up.
John stared. “The lecture was on the difference in blood types between immature and mature omega males.”
“Yes, yes,” Sherry waved a hand and took out a pack of cigarettes. “But let’s let bygones be bygones…”
“You have got it, you just need to be confident enough to keep going,” John said to the tree-tops. “You’ll get there.” He unscrewed the top of his steel water bottle, and poured half of it down his throat. He looked up, at Sherlock in his stupid tight dressy shorts and top, his nice trainers ditched by the dust and muck in the woods, mud splashed up the back of his calf from the bike… John had to look away.
“People make their own decisions,” John said. “Sometimes they’re not good. But you can’t go back in time and change anything.”
John had to agree, as his pelvis responded to the pleasure of Sherlock’s grip with a thrust into his hand. A hot sort of pleasure bloomed inside him, and John held tight around Sherlock’s neck as the alpha worked them both together, swearing softly, moaning against John’s skin as the face increased, harder and faster, John shaking with need, but unable to let go.
Sherlock laughed, and pulled the jacket tight, checking how it looked buttoned. “Do you like it, then?”
He felt terrible – he was hot and aching and he’d given in and touched himself after a quarter of an hour, coming barely satisfied, and then shaking with need immediately after. He’d climbed out of the bath, torn his clothes off, and staggered across the hall into Sherlock’s bedroom, climbing onto the bed, skin still damp, and inhaling the scent of the bedding like it was a drug.
Lestrade patted Sherlock on the shoulder. ‘I get it. We’re all soaked in it, in alpha supremacy. We should be past all that shit but we’re not. We should all be able to be who we are. If John feels he’s a beta, he should be allowed to live as one. If you hurt an omega, you should face the consequences. But what can we do? We’re just two blokes.’
“Do you think… we could try being… boyfriends?” John asked, his tongue feeling all wrong in his mouth as he spoke.
“I don’t know,” John said. “I think it’s because I want Sherlock Holmes. Not Omega Holmes. I think I’d still want you even if you were an alpha.”
Sherlock was face-down on the mattress, his legs spread wide, slick leaking out of his puckered pink hole. He was sweaty and dishevelled and twitching in obvious need. He also looked close to unconscious.
“I’ll have to do you a tour. And find you a school,” Mycroft sighed. “Perhaps that can wait until after Christmas.”
“It’s ok,” Sherlock dropped his jacket, and started on his shirt buttons. “I’m sorry I wasn’t here. John… my John…”
“I mean… alphas and omegas aren’t friends. Not really. We – they’re either mates, or they’re… not anything, really.”
“Well, a lot of omegas have parties for their sixteenths, don’t they?” Sherlock picked up his tea. Sherry did. And Eurus."
September got colder, and the trees goldened. October blew in in a rush of mock exams and trick-or-treaters that Sherlock refused to answer the door to. He stood awkwardly, whilst John took his photograph on Halloween night, as he was in fancy dress for the first time in his life.
“I’ll think about it,” John said, not moving away. “I don’t think it’s something I should rule out, that’s all.”
“Don’t be, I’d rather find you here than have to dredge the canal for you,” Lestrade sighed. “So… have you run away?”
“I love you,” John said, loud enough for everyone to hear, as Sherlock climbed onto the trolley. “I’ll see you as soon as you wake up.”
Sherlock looked at him. “Because you escaped,” he said. “I don’t mean from the house. Sherry did that, too, and she doesn’t hate him. I mean, you escaped from Siger.”
“Sherlock, this is a wonderful present,” his mother said, almost stroking the box. “Say thank you. Properly.”
“You don’t need to say anything,” John said honestly. “I’ve known for a while, and I just thought you should know, too.”
Mycroft sighed. “I’m going to call Gregory. If Eurus gets up, try and keep her comfortable.” He left, dialling into his mobile.
“Don’t. I’m glad you did. I like Greg. I don’t want to kill him. I didn’t even want to bite him but his scent…” John shuddered, and Sherlock noticed with jealousy that it was a shudder of pleasure. “It was right here, in the flat, and I just… I don’t even remember doing it. But I remember how it felt.” He rubbed the back of his head. “I could have killed him. He’s… so poorly, I might still have killed him.”
“Nah,” Sherrinford grinned again. “You think you do. When you’re in heat, and actually, that’s not a requirement, but when you are, you really want an alpha to stick his –”
“Sherlock?” John looked at the younger brother, who looked like he wanted to evaporate. “You’re going to find someone to mate with, just…”
, he thought to himself. He turned over for the hundredth time that night, and wondered if his parents had put his presents under the tree. It didn’t matter. The thought of Christmas made him feel sick.
Sherlock dropped the box, which spilled a grey powder as it fell. He held his right hand out in front of him. And screamed. John had never heard a sound like it. It was a guttural, feral scream of pain that went straight to his gut.
Molly stared at him. Her mousy brown hair blew in the wind, and her eyes were wide. “I… I thought we were… friends?”
John stayed looking out the window. “I think you were too late as soon as that vampire got on the tube,” he said. His voice sounded soft. “I shouldn’t have gone off alone.”
“Only in every other area of my lifffffff…” Sherlock bit down on his lip as John kissed his neck, teeth dragging over his skin as he continued to tease at the alpha’s nipple. This was all backwards. Sherlock was supposed to be in John’s place. Alphas were supposed to take charge, and yet here he was, being reduced to an uncommunicative mess by a few simple touches.
“Hello?” Victor’s face appeared in the gap between the door and the wall. Then he opened it wider, recognising John. “Oh… hello, again.”
He was an unbonded mother, and by his own choice. He declined an after-heat pill when it was offered, and declined again a termination when he was urged to consider one. In the end, John was given his discharge papers, some compensation and hush-money, and sent on his way.
“Mummy’s a lecturer,” Sherlock put his phone away. “And Father does speeches, too. They tend to get booked as a package deal. Mummy used to work at a university before she had my brother and me. Now she tours, teaching.”
Sherlock looked as though he was thinking about it. Then shook his head. “No,” he said, a wicked look in his eye, “I don’t feel like it, now.”
