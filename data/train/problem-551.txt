“The pipes, John. I tried knocking against it, using Morse code. Mary did not like that, obviously. That is how I got this.” He pointed at his split lip. “And you never seemed to hear me.”
John’s face falls in disappointment. “What about next week?

There was nothing he could do now, and he felt unbearably tired. He stumbled with weak knees to his bed and immediately fell asleep.
Sherlock whispers. His shaking grows worse. “I was angry at him, because he didn’t inform us sooner about Mary and her connections with Moriarty. I was absolutely furious, and I said a few terrible things. And now it’s too late.

had patiently followed John’s observations.
A conversation under the stars.
“Good. I have something to tell him.“
John and Sherlock had met on a cold January day, a few days after Sherlock’s 21st birthday. John was then 23 and worked in a coffee shop not far away from St. Bart’s to pay for the rent of his student room. He knew that the prince was studying Chemistry at Imperial but never dared to dream about actually meeting his sort-of celebrity crush.

The detective let out a whimper when she pushed a curl from his sweaty forehead. He had started to develop a slight fever in the last ten hours. She had to be careful not to overdose him. Fascinated Mary dragged her fingers through his thick curls. What was so special about him that he caught John Watson attention more than she ever could. Her eyes wandered to his tightly shut eyes and his screwed shut mouth.

He drowned the priests' bible verses out. Sherlock certainly choose an appropriate on, but John could never get himself to listen the words. He didn’t feel like God loved him. First, he got shot, and then he met Sherlock, which was the best thing that ever happened to him, and then Sherlock jumped off that roof and disappeared for two years (they still had to talk about that), which drove John into total depression, until Mary showed up and slowly dragged him back to the light. He was thankful for her, yet part of him wished it wouldn’t have been necessary.

In short, it is Sherlock’s favourite place. Molly Hooper, who studies at Barts, is also working next to him today. In the mornings, many students need a cup of coffee. They are either just starting their day or never went to bed, and everyone has to be awake for their next lecture immediately.
Sherlock felt like he was going to explode from the anticipation alone. He wriggled his legs to signal John to finally get on it with, damn it!
You should eat more, you look absolutely ravished.
Over the next decade, he witnessed a few of his friends married, but they never stayed John’s friends for long. John strayed from one place to the next, drifted from people to people. The army was a short refuge for him, a place where he truly belonged, but this life did not stick around for long either. After he was shot, he considered suicide. Every night, he clutched his smuggled gun in sweaty hands and considered just ending it all.
John gave her a short kiss and smiled at her. Then his hand went inside his coat, found something and stabbed a needle into Mary's neck. Her sufficient grin was gone, replaced by pure shock.
Yet, Sherlock could not risk it. He had never tried being in a relationship, or kissing. Or, anything else.
“How could you possibly know about my siblings drinking?
“Right. Sorry to hear that.
You mean I am weird?
After looking everywhere again and again, John had to concede. His dog tags were simply missing, and there was no way to get them back.
His gasps do not die down this time, and Sherlock would be absolutely scared shitless of brain damage right now if he could still think. There is no energy for that though any more.
“Unbelievable riches, you say.

Maybe a thought for another time.
Mr. Holmes smiles: “Sherlock, then.
“You can not go down there, they are about to wrap it up. Then we can see how John is.
In the store, Sherlock has proven himself to be quite the worthy employee. Upon seeing a customer, he instantly knows what the person is searching for, thanks to his helpful deductions. He is taller than the women, with dark curls roaming wildly on his head. Outdoors, he likes to wear a long coat, a clothing item that once belonged to Mrs. Hudson, and Sherlock would never admit how much he loves the item. Indoors, he prefers black trousers, sneakers and sharp shirts, basically all the dark and purple stuff he finds at cheap stores and charity stores.
“John.
I don't want Mrs Norris watching us snogging.
The lack of sleep, the stress and his strained friendship with John has strained his patience and tolerance for his students.
Her thoughts got interrupted by a pained whisper from her captive. His bleeding lips were moving, saying JohnJohnJohn over and over again, like a prayer.
John asks interested. Sherlock shrugs:

John is there now. He and Mary are screaming at each other, but all Sherlock can fathom is Mycrofts eyes on his and his smile.

Smith wagers his finger in front of John’s face. “I’m afraid you have left me no other choice.
For a moment, John wonders if his future partner will like pizza or not, but decides that they will love it.
She whispered, clutching a mug of cold tea. “We promised each other to stay together, to go through the hard times, through illness and death, but I never expected anything like this.
"John, why don’t you sit down next to me, so we can talk?“ She will suggest.
She twitters, in her fake voice.
He says. “Santa Claus was a dangerous lunatic who killed three people, then nearly killed you. He thought he understood our relationship from the yellow press, but that is impossible.
The two guards exited the room. The door must be behind his back, since Sherlock couldn’t see it. They had him blindfolded on his way to this room. The only piece of furniture was a table and a wooden chair. Sherlock couldn’t see if there were any objects lying on it. The room was brightly lit and there were no windows, only a hook dangling from the ceiling. His kidnapper was about a head taller than he was, approximately his age and Caucasian. He knelt down to his level and cupped his face with both of his hands. Sherlock tried to wrestle his head away from the unwelcoming touch, but the man was strong.
Moriarty kneels down to the rapidly breathing Sherlock and grins down at him.
With a sigh Sherlock turned around: “Yes, John. I have finished the difficult task of cleaning your stuff. I do am capable of simple housework.

John jumped up as well: “So what? They nearly tortured and killed you too!” He screamed into Sherlock’s grey face.
“Oh, I have walked by it a few times, but I never had the chance to visit.
John takes both of Sherlock hands and presses them to his heart.
His warm blanket envelops him.
“I know, love. I was there last night.
“This makes me dangerous.
John interrupts the detective’s pleading: “Shut up Sherlock!
Sherlock meets a new customer.

A voice exclaims, and a young man, maybe two or three years older than him, with blond hair and a green jacket, jumps up and catches the note before it disappears in the streets of London forever. The young man approaches him and hands over the blue note to a gaping Sherlock.
“Sherlock is absolutely right. It’s too early to invite John into the closer circle of our family, and the speculation is already bad enough as it is. The Daily Mail has a new headline about you two every single day.
stares at him as if he forgot John is in the room too.

Sherlock says, then pushes the willing John on his back and climbs on top of him. He eyes John’s cock, which is nearly purple, the tip glistening. It is big, but Sherlock has a good feeling about this. He carefully takes John’s cock into his mouth and experimentally sucks on it.
“Yes, you see, Mom and Dad are not home often, and they can be not very nice, and I think we both need a friend.

But at that moment, all he managed to focus on was John’s heartbroken expression when Sherlock had thrown all these horrible accusations at him.
Well, this might be true at this point, but even the smartest criminals will make a mistake sooner and later. Sherlock just wished the man would get on with it. His knees hurt from kneeling on the cold ground, his ankles were getting chaffed from the cuffs and he had lost all his feelings in his tightly bound hands. His mouth was dry in an unpleasant way, his tongue wooden.
The other two women gasp in surprise.

There is no strength left in his quivering legs, and so he crawls on one hand, until he reaches the first trees. They welcome him like an old friend.

anyway, it was John and Mary’s. John had moved into her cosy flat after meeting and soon dating her in April. A few of Mary’s friends came over, and they all giggled loudly in the living room, while John sat next to the window, nursing his brandy and staring out into the falling snow. Later, Mary and John had sex, and John tried to act as enthusiastically as possible, when all he could think of was a black gravestone, a dusty flat, a cold fireplace, a silent living room, and a skull without a Santa Claus hat.
John moved into these two rooms after he returned injured from the war, the old woman had gladly rented them to him. Seeing the sparely decorated rooms again, he missed the

John grunted and stood up. He swiftly lifted Sherlock’s thin body into his arms and carried him to their bedroom. To Sherlock’s surprise he didn’t throw him on it like the last time, but gently lay him down on top of it. His head was cushioned by a pillow, and they both looked at each other for a moment.

John ignores Mary and rather puts his hand on Sherlock’s back. Sherlock can feel the warmth of his hand through his thick coat. He hopes John will never stop these casual touches. He enjoys it even more when he notices Mary’s annoyed reaction to it, which she quickly hides behind another smile.
Sherlock exclaims excitedly. Maybe this promises to be fun after all. They seem to be the only visitor so there’s nothing to stop their extensive snogging. Which starts about now, as John envelops him in his strong arms (he has started working out to keep himself fit for all the criminal chasing) and starts kissing his neck very thoroughly. Christ, Sherlock adores it when John does this, and it is even more fun to watch it in all of the surrounding mirrors. John is right, this was a brilliant idea.
“Your mother?

The two are on their well-deserved holiday. October has been a difficult month for them. Or, better put, the whole year has been difficult. At first, John suggested a week in Spain or Greece, so they could catch the last warm and sunny days on a beach somewhere. Sherlock did not feel fit to fly for hours though, and in the end, they decided to stay somewhere comfortable and familiar: the little house in Sussex, which Janine has sold to them when she moved to France. Sherlock’s parents had stayed there the last week, to ensure the place is warm and clean. The weather had been good and the older Holmes enjoyed quiet walks at the beach. Margaret phoned John last night, when John was busy throwing all the books he plans to read into his and Sherlock’s shared luggage.
The kidnapper pointed at the hook. A noose was hanging from it now, and Sherlock understood.
“The name is Sherlock Holmes and Doctor John Watson, and they are causing a lot of trouble for Martha, but she loves them like her own sons. They catch murderer, thieves and blackmailers, you can read it all on Doctor Watson’s blog.
, Sherlock admitted. John’s heart broke a little.
Sherlock can not describe how much he loves this man. Under John’s touch, they stop itching, no matter how much it rains.
John smiles a Rosie, who rolls her around on the carpet. He waits for his answer. He seems sure it will be a 'yes'.
Christmas gifts me wonderful days with my beautiful wife and our two children. Our house may not be as big as yours, and our tree may not be as decorated as others. We enjoy our turkey nevertheless, and sing Christmas songs together. My older daughter will perform a poem he learned in school, and my youngest will read to us from the bible. They will receive presents of course, and play with them the whole day. My wife will smile at me and I will hold her hand, while we listen to the chiming of the bells of Big Ben. The people of London will enjoy the quiet and the peace, together with their loved ones. There is no greater gift than spending time with my family, and it’s a gift Christmas delivers to my doorstep ever year! Christmas has always been good to me, god bless it.

His boyfriend had gifted the jacket to Sherlock on the day they first kissed (23 days, 8 hours and 32 minutes) and from that day on, Sherlock is frequently seen wearing the red jacket which has the letters WATSON and the number 21 on the back of it. John had asked him to wear the jacket for their first game today, and Sherlock happily obliged. He does enjoy feeling the other girls (and some boys) jealous glances on his back when he walks by.

The sound that came out of John’s mouth was inhuman. Sherlock was standing impossibly still, one hand slowly reaching for the knife in his body. He looked helplessly at John. The doctor managed to catch his falling body and brought him gently down to the floor. He inspected the bleeding wound immediately.
’s counting-house was open, so he could observe the work of his young clerk at all times. He had hired the boy, barely a man, a few months ago. John Watson may not have a Marley’s intelligence, but he was reliable and worked hard without complaining. John Watson was short, but strong, with blond hair and friendly blue eyes.

, his brother, his role model for a long time, joining a government that spied on his citizens, giving him terrible life advices. Caring is not an advantage, Sherlock.
Irene explains. There is another loud cheer all around them. “And… They’re off.
Mary interjects his triumph.
SHERLOCK HOLMES IS A
The students stare remorseful at their desks and nod. Sherlock sighs and rubs his aching forehead. He contemplates skipping the flowers experiment, but he does not want to ruin their first school day any further.
John continues.

After a successful transaction with Timmy and Tommy, Sherlock’s bag feels significantly lighter. The two boys settle down at the beach, a burning fireplace between them.
A new voice addresses him from the side. Sherlock turns his head so quickly that he hits his knee under the table. Professor Watson wears a cuddly, brown jumper under his dark robes, and there are a few grey streaks in his blond hair, which makes him look more sophisticated.
Someone like him! Ha. Sherlock may be blind since his fifth year, but surely he can navigate through a simple tube station, when John is walking right next to him.
“He is not coming, dear.
Something catches Sherlock’s eye. It takes Sherlock a moment to recognize the frankly, not well-put together costume. An older student from

There must be a baby.
“We can talk about our costumes for the Halloween party!
There is a ringing in his ears, something is down his face, and his head hurts like hell. There is grey dust, glass, splinters and rubbish everywhere. He can hear the waitress beginning to sob behind him, but all Sherlock can concentrate on is where their table and chairs stood just seconds ago.
Of course you own the newest edition.
If you were better at acting we wouldn’t be in this situation right now!
The two stepped in, and
Please, he prays. Please let them both be okay, I don’t want to tell another mother this kind of news. I only just finally found him, please let him be alright.
“Let’s go home.
“Why exactly do we have to visit a fun house filled with mirrors?
John throws in, wanting to defend Sherlock still, but
John jokes and chuckles until he notices Sherlock’s discomfort.
He hopes his stammering makes enough sense for his genius husband, and thankfully it does. Sherlock smiles, and they slowly make their way back to Aidan, breathing in the silent night before the new day arrives.

Suddenly, Sherlock desperately wants to tell John about Mary’s threats, about the potion he hides in the secret cupboard next to his bed, and most of all what is going to happen to Sherlock tonight after he drinks it.
Sherlock watches the love his life marrying someone else and has to congratulate them.
And so Sherlock said nothing and the coffin was lowered into the ground.
The money, right. Where did he put it? Sherlock started searching through his pockets, growing more hectic by the second.
Sherlock nods. Neither of them want to give up the work, at least not at this time in their lives, and John is right: there is no point to worry about something that did not happen.
Sherlock closed his eyes. The nerve of this man, saying these seemingly comforting words while he sexually assaulted him.

John tells him, and enjoys the surprised — and delighted — look on Sherlock’s face.
Sherlock wonders if he resembles this painted werewolf. Or if Sherlock looks even scarier.

You too. Give my love to Mrs. Hudson.

The man unzips his trousers, and Sherlock manages to slur “Let me go.
“It must have been a dream.
Sherlock rolls his eyes: “I do have to give you my present now. If I am naked, you won’t be able to concentrate.
With that talk, it was settled, and the children soon fell asleep, each safe in the other’s arms.
Who is this?
“Is this what you ever wanted, John?
Mrs. Bird whispers, like it’s the biggest secret in the universe: “That is the thing, my dear. No one really knows.
They continue watching, until Colin Firth jumps into the lake and gets his white shirt all wet.

Indeed, one of the flatowners who live directly next to the Tate Modern Viewing plattform, is gesticulating. His mouth is moving, but the wind is too loud to hear anything.
The boy shrugged:

"I killed his wife. He was entitled."
Gregory laughed: “Not as good as you are.
About 71 percent of the Earth is water-covered. 60% of a human body is water. Milk is made of 95% water. Water is one of the few things that humans cannot live without. It’s no wonder that John’s heart is full of it too.
For New Year’s Eve, Sherlock and John decided to invite their friends for a little gathering. The invitations were happily received, and Lestrade exclaimed upon entering how good it is to see them together at Baker Street again. Sherlock agreed with his sentiment.
Sherlock named, it means “fiery
Sherlock Holmes had actually come to her. Oblivious and unarmed. Too trusting and blind until the end. She had knocked him out with a first shot of the drug and two helpful boys had helped her carry him into the room.
Sherlock kicks his boots from his feet and shuffles out of his coat. John starts to shed his heavy winter clothing as well while he lights up their fireplace. Soon, the wood is burning and it casts a nice shine over their new home. John goes back to their bed, eagerly. Sherlock is waiting for him.
His room is stuffed with homework to grade, plans for the upcoming lessons, notes for the Halloween party, a map for all their
John only shakes his head: “Forget it. I don’t want to get sick, eight days before Christmas.
The man wants to provoke him, and he is still not stepping out of Sherlock’s way.
Sherlock gathers the last shred of his bravery and asks: “What about you?
allowed himself one last look at his younger brother and John Watson, who were now moping up the floor together. John must have mentioned something funny, because Sherlock was softly giggling.
Sherlock snaps back, highly irritated by her tone.
Mary, what the hell are you doing here?

had taught him too. Treat your slave with a firm hand, and you will have a good life.
“Tell me, Doctor Watson: Are you and Sherlock a couple?
reminded him Margaret, “we did decide on only taking one child.
“Shut up, or I will force you to. Not that they would have a fighting chance against me. After all, teachers at Hogwarts are exceptional at their craft.
Old Marley was definitely dead. There was no doubt about that. He had been dead for nearly two years now.
“Sir, visitors are not allowed so far, you need to talk downstairs with the nurses.
“I just heard about it, I… Wait, how do you know something happened?
kidnaps Sherlock, burns a fake corpse, drugs him and forces him into a small closet. Sherlock nearly starves to death, and John blows a hole through the bolted door and a hole through his wife’s forehead.
“John, what do you see?
“First, she is no longer my girlfriend. Second, I don’t want Sherlock anywhere near Mary. Is that understood?” John demanded, remembering Sherlock’s terrified face. The detective should not go through more emotional turmoil.
John says, steps on his toes, pulls Sherlock’s face close to him and kisses him.
“Sherlock, you did not offer to take off our guests coat and hat.
“How do you know?
At first, he thinks he has somehow hurt his hands when he fell down, because they were full of blood. Then he slowly realizes that it wasn’t his blood, and the body under him was not moving. He slowly crawls to his knees, not quite believing what his eyes see.
"So it’s okay for you if I have bad smell, but not you?“
is going to kill him.
John had stormed to work on that morning and Sherlock went to Tesco to buy milk. They drugged and stuck him into the back of a car, and what-if no one will ever find him again because there is no Mycroft to check the camera and John might already fall in love with another woman?
John says, and opens the zip of Sherlock’s tight, black trousers.
A simple flower, that should not be too hard. Molly did not specify what kind, so Sherlock searches around and settles on a nicely looking cactus. It will look perfect next to the skull on the fireplace. This cactus is going to blossom in a few months, and hopefully then John will be done with playing hero in the dessert when he could just as well be a hero in their bedroom at Baker Street. Much more comfortable anyway.
Sherlock asks to get away from answering. Having the Keeper of Keys and Grounds of Hogwarts on their side would certainly help.
“Definitely not.
Why is nothing happening? Surely Mary would have figured out by now that his dear brother does not answer to blackmailing. That would be accepting defeat, something neither of the Holmes brothers is capable of.
This must be Mary
John shushes him and rubs his shoulder, before rushing back into the chaos to save their groceries.
“John, please don’t.” He pleaded. “She is a highly-trained professional killer with contacts all over Europe. She has hidden weapons all over your house.”
He takes four more turns and runs into a dead end. Annoyed, he wants to walk back to his last turn, but… Wait.
(See the end of the chapter for
It all happened very fast.
Sherlock nodded quickly. Yes, he wanted this. John made him feel desirable and beautiful. Sherlock felt safe with him.
He sounded so angry, even Mary looked impressed for a moment. His eyes were glaring at Sherlock, and he smirked in a terrifying way. Sherlock shrank a step back.
Sherlock kisses him. Their tongues play with each other, their lips are frozen, all around them is only silence.
Santa chides him, but the words are like coming through a long tunnel for Sherlock. He can’t figure their meaning out.
observed every glimpse of his lost younger brother as time passed. John was always right next to him, growing into a strong boy despite the lack of nutritional food. Sherlock grew too, but he always stayed dangerously skinny.

’s Castle, possibly one of the hardest by the looks of it. If only John’s soft skin was not so distracting.
“Sit down.
With a deliberate hard thrust, Sherlock sees stars.
Sherlock was considered as widely unpopular. He had actually managed to skip year one, the teacher allowed it because he kept complaining about being bored in class. His parents were opposed to it at first, but Sherlock persuaded them. That’s how he came to the same grade as John. Whatever class they shared, they would always sit together. Sherlock was now the student with the best grades, he was the seeker of their Ravenclaw team, and his favourite subject was potion. But he was also sometimes rude and abrasive, and talked without thinking. Most of the other students hated him for being so intelligent without doing much work, and they never understood why John Watson, of all people, would want to be his friend.

“Be careful!
“Are you aware that you are saying it out loud?
“Probably as old as Stonehenge.
“As long as there are no worms included.
He promises her. Sherlock protests a bit until John whispers to him that he would slip into the prince’s bed at midnight. Sherlock hates to sleep alone, and John has to admit that it keeps his own nightmare at bay too.
“That’s good to hear. I can send you a few pictures tomorrow. I have been very busy working-out and with jogging.”
The curious eyes are still there. Greg is talking to a colleague, but he keeps looking at them. That’s fine, these are friendly eyes. Unfortunately, there is also Anderson, who somehow got his job back and is now running around, telling conspiracy theories. Worse, dozens of neighbours are standing around the police barrier. John is only waiting for someone to just climb over, people have been losing more and more respect for authorities nowadays. About all of them are filming the whole scene, maybe also livestreaming it on Twitter, YouTube, whatever. This is a good neighbourhood, so people are hungry for a spectacle, especially something involving someone as famous in London as Sherlock is. A few reporters have arrived too, and they are calling out questions to the policemen and paramedics walking around.
Sherlock snorts: “Of course, how else are they going to learn?
John curls his arms around Sherlock’s bony hips and waits patiently for an explanation.
“Sherlock.
“I would have blackmailed you with something, I’m sure there is something you hide, everyone does. Or, I would have bought you a monthly supply of sweets from the
Maybe he is still in Serbia.
Sherlock is eternal thankful to make the proposal so that Sherlock won’t have to. He nods, and the couple start their short walk to the older Holmes.
“Where are we going?
Since John could remember, Sherlock was always rumored to be gay. When the medical student was just going through the process of finding out he is bisexual, the young prince -nineteen at that time- had made a short public announcement that he only loved man. It was the first time that a member of the Royal Family seemed somewhat approachable to John, and he started to observe Sherlock in the upcoming months more closely. The young man had a one-year-long relationship with another rich nobleman, Victor Trevor, who first kissed him and then publicly broke up with him. Last thing he had heard about that asshole was that he had spent all the money he gained for breaking Sherlock’s heart and was now bankrupt.

Wow. John feels his lips tingling just by looking at it.
recognized his younger self immediately. The boy had grown a bit, looking now about twelve years old.
who could not even heal himself. So, LEAVE. ME. ALONE.
Sherlock throws in and turns on his back. John’s eyes shine full of love and it takes all the rest of Sherlock’s anxiety away. He watches as John slowly pushes his cock into Sherlock’s hole.

“I told you.

“Can’t they visit me all at once? I would rather get it over quickly.
“We were best friends.
“Everything alright?”
Irene said, and John immediately hurried over to Sherlock to pop the big question. The boy had smiled widely, and John kicked himself for not doing it sooner. Sherlock is always so confident, and it’s easy to forget that it’s Sherlock first relationship, and he is actually quite insecure about the whole
There was a long moment of silence, where they both pretended not to notice the single tear rolling down Sherlock's face.
John shouts and lifts Sherlock even higher. Sherlock feels double elevated, both by the height and John’s fantastic mood. He wraps his arms around John’s shoulders.

“I can see that,” The King replies dryly. “What are you planning to do?

Sherlock had nearly collapsed after John’s (very romantic and teary, thank you very much) speech. They had shared a kiss, and he gave him his grandmothers ring (
John crosses his arms, his cane momentarily forgotten. This exact thought must have crossed his mind, and Mary hurriedly walks back her question. She suddenly opts for a very different tone.
Him getting discharged is actually the reason Lestrade is here. John had called him yesterday, late in the evening. Greg had just returned from his fourth date with Molly, something Sherlock still didn’t know about. Hah! John had asked him if he could drive them both back to Baker Street, and Greg happily said yes. He missed them at his crime scenes, it was way too quiet without their nagging. Meeting them more often now would definitely be good news.
GET OUT!
At least, now that Sherlock had arrived, everything was going to be perfect.
There is a moment of silence between them.
When he finally kicked open the bolted door and saw the love of his life lying motionless on that
Sherlock whispers. His whole posture screams of exhaustion. Gladstone presses his bulky head against Sherlock’s chest, but recoils when the man gasps in pain.

John loves every sound the sea makes. Sometimes she is happy, and her waves wander gently over the soft sand, other times, she is angry and restless and rebels against everything there is on earth. She can make you smile and kill you in a matter of times. The sea is always changeable, and even in her most terrified state beautiful.

“She is… dangerous, John. She must have been the link between Moriarty and the group in Serbia that I was missing. They contacted her, I’m not sure when. She arrived and recognized me immediately. The men wanted to keep me as a bargaining chip against my brother. She didn’t like that, and poisoned their drinks at the next opportunity. I saw their corpses. She told me that she would bring me back to England, and that something terrible would happen if I didn’t comply. Not that I had much of a choice, she kept me drugged and tied up in the boot of her car. Next thing I knew, I was in the room in your basement. And …” Sherlock closed his eyes tightly for a second. “I heard your voice, John.”
John could glimpse Harry, who was waving at him from the first row, where Sherlock’s family would also sit. They also invited some actors and other celebrities in the hope to make the whole event less serious and more modern.
“Good afternoon!
Mummy had joined them, and now all three were nearly shouting at each other about something Brexit-related. Apparently
Well, if Santa is correct, it will be better for John. Sure, the sight of his dead boyfriend of two months laying on the doorstep of Baker Street may be a shock shortly before Christmas, but afterwards… John can get a normal life, with the 1.4 children, a nice wife who is neither like Sherlock nor an assassin like Mary. Someone he deserves.
Sherlock gaze meets his eyes. He stretches out his hand and starts drumming on John’s shoulder (how John had missed his soft touch!).
Sherlock frowned. In his short time in the capital, he had learned that not much could scare these people.
Sherlock says and tries desperately to hide his big smile.
John shrugs: “I was so excited when

John concentrates his gaze on the black sky in the hall.
It is the 13th of October, first rugby game of the new school year, and Sherlock Holmes is already freezing on the cold benches. Half the school population is here, plus a few dozen fans of the opposite team, and the atmosphere is possibly cracking with anxiety. The Baker School desperately wants their team to win, and everyone is cheering and clapping for their boys.

Mary held Mycroft in a sort of embrace, her small gun pushed to the back of his head. His brother was kneeling on the ground and Sherlock stood before them, feeling so damn helpless. He was unarmed, because he didn’t expectMycroftt to fall like this. They weren’t close since their childhood, always fighting and competing against each other, but a small part of Sherlock always knew that his big brother would always have his back. Whenever he got into trouble, he relied onMycroftt to get him out of it, and Mycroft always had. Now Mary was here, grinning at both of them, wagging her eyebrows. She was enjoying this. Killing them both was going to be her greatest triumph, her golden medal.

However, the Santa Claus that is now sitting in front of Sherlock Holmes, is not so friendly. He too wears the signature coat and the beard, although it’s more grey than white, but his eyes are controlled, calculating, cruel. He hasn’t come down the chimney either, and it’s not even Christmas Eve yet. Sherlock had spent days looking for exactly this dressed-up figure, and now he has found him, or worse, Santa Claus has found Sherlock. He found him, then drugged him, and when that didn’t work fast enough, he also hit him on the head. Due to that, Sherlock doesn’t know if this Santa possesses a sleight too, or just your average white kidnapper van.
He whispers against them, and enjoys Sherlock’s shaky inhale. Jesus, he loved the boy’s reactions from whatever John does to him. Sherlock is always so delightfully responsive.

Sherlock has to gather his thoughts while John looks at him expectantly. “I dreamed my parents died, I was sold into slavery and your dad purchased me. You visited me on the first night in that cupboard your mother keeps her cleaning devices in, and brought me food and a teddy.
