He can’t stop thinking about it now, his mind prodding at the idea like a sore tooth (ha, he should start a stand-up routine). “We need to have sex,” he blurts out before he can stop the words, immediately wants to stuff them back into his mouth. Because anyone else in their situation would say no, that they were moving too fast, they were both still vulnerable and aching from the past few months.
There’s some rustling, and Cas says, “Goodbye, Dean,” the floorboards creaking as he goes to the back door. Dean looks up to see Cas walking across the sand, the moon slowly fading as dawn lightens the sky. A nameless terror crawls up his esophagus, and he runs after Cas, words burning up his throat and scalding his tongue, though they disappear like steam when he tries to call Cas’ name. But before he can reach him, Cas steps into the ocean, a silver-gray light engulfing him slowly, almost like it’s fighting against him.
Dean frowns, running his hands over the back ports. There’s a large round one that he doesn’t recognize, outlined in a purple plastic casing and shoved between the ECG and USB ports. “Are you guys working with subjects or something?” he asks.
“Holy shit, what happened? Are you okay?” he asks, using his shoulder to help Cas stand. “Did you hit your head?” He quickly looks Cas over for any visible bruises or wounds, but doesn’t see anything.
Her eyes go wide and she nods. “He’s resting in the back room. The door’s over there and should be unlocked, go ahead on in.”
Benny snorts and leans back in his seat. “Never claimed he does. Just trying to look out for my friend, is all. That’s the kind of guy I am.”
Sam gives him Bitchface Number Twenty-seven (“You’re being an obtuse jerk, Dean”). “It’s not a wild goose chase, not to me at least. These stories and legends, they’ve gotta come from some place that’s factual. Every story has its basis in truth somehow. We’re searching for new connections and information that these myths might tell us that can aid us with the project we’re working on.”
“Thanks, man,” he says anyway. “I’ve gotta head out, I told one of my coworkers I’d pick up her shift this afternoon.”
in Dean so much that Dean has to look away. “I ain’t the right guy for this, Cas,” he mutters to his shoulder, blinking against his stinging eyes. “You said so yourself when you walked into that water.”
With a simultaneous shout, Sam and Rowena clench their fists and raise their arms to the sky. The flames suddenly go out like a snuffed out candle, just before they spread into the forest proper around the cabin.
Cas fists a hand in the front of Dean’s scrubs, pulls him forward on the couch, and Dean isn’t resisting but his mouth goes dry at the reminder of how strong Cas is, and suddenly he doesn’t want to be on the couch anymore, wants to be someplace where they can be closer, where they can stretch out and relearn one another. He breaks the kiss, heart beating wildly as Cas attempts to follow him, chasing his lips.
Cas hums and keeps petting through his hair. “Did you have another fight with Sam?” he guesses, and dammit, he’s too observant for his own good.
Dean’s chest aches, and he wants to believe Cas so badly, he does. But Sam is still his little brother -- still his responsibility. And Dean would rather die than let something bad happen to him. Again.
“I said leave!” Sam shouts, whipping around, gaze furious. “I’m… I need to get back to work. I need to clean this up.” Suddenly his shoulders slump, like a puppet whose strings have just been cut. “What I’m doing is important. I just wish… I wish you’d respect that,” he says, then turns away from Dean once more.
The reminder shouldn’t sting, but it does anyway, and Dean hunches instinctively, the way he always does when someone questions his lack of magical ability. He knows Sam doesn’t mean it that way, but, well. Still doesn’t stop it from hurting somewhere deep inside a forgotten place in his chest. He opens his mouth to explain, but Cas beats him to it.
Dean folds himself into the seat next to the window, gripping the armrests so hard his fingers ache. “We all have our vices, Mr. Binge-Watches-Netflix-Until-Two-A.M.” He’s proud of the way his voice only shakes a little bit as he delivers that calculated burn.
“I don’t think so, but we should plan for the possibility. She has expressed her displeasure for the Winchesters on several occasions, after all. There are clearly aspects to her plan she hasn’t told us yet. Getting into her library could provide some useful intel.” Jack’s confession roils unpleasantly in his stomach, but he won’t say it. Jack had begged him not to, after all.
It makes sense, Dean has to admit, but he still blows out a frustrated breath and scrubs a hand through his hair. Across from him, Castiel slumps in the chair, disappointment etched across his face. Dean’s heart aches in sympathy for him -- it can’t be easy, being told that there’s no way to get in touch with anyone who knows you. No way to get back to an environment that might help you regain your own memories.
--staring up at him, the ring of unearthly blue taken over by black in his eyes, and he kisses him, bites the well of Cas’ lower lip. Says, “C’mon, Cas, fuck me,” and squeezes around Cas’ still-hard dick as best he can.
They sit there with their hands clasped for another few silent moments; Dean rubs his thumb back and forth over the thin skin on the back of Cas’ hand, feels the tendons shift with each pass. The depths of Cas’ eyes are a calm pool inviting him in, and Dean lets himself breathe normally for the first time since Cas called earlier. Anxiety still buzzes in a low hum across his skin, but it’s manageable now; there’s a plan. Dean knows how to follow plans.
A flash of embarrassment runs down Dean’s spine, but whatever. He means it, even if he sounds like a telenovela. He wants Cas to stay as long as he needs to, wants to keep helping Cas. Dean barely knows the guy, but he’s not heartless, not by a long shot.
Dean stares at the wood grain on the surface of the table, an icy kind of heat prickling up his jaw. Yeah, magic and shit ain’t exactly his forte. It’s something he doesn’t try to dwell on too much, leaves that in Sam’s more capable hands instead. So what if he’s kind of the odd duck in his family, not having a strong affinity for magic; he’s done his best to do good with the tools he does have. He knows he could do more if he had Sam’s aptitude for magic, but, well. Them’s the breaks.
“You don’t know me,” Sam says to his back, voice seething. “You think I’m just some stupid junkie. Fine. We’ll see if I accept your apology when you figure out I’m right.”
“What do you mean, just the residue?” Sam asks. There are the remains of tears on his own cheeks, Dean notices. They were all affected by what just happened.
There are words falling from his lips, an incoherent stream that mostly consists of begging and Cas’ name, and Cas has his face tucked into the curve of Dean’s neck, lips brushing the line of his throat. He’s murmuring something that Dean can’t make out, but his rhythm grows sharper, more disjointed, and Dean knows he’s getting close, knows he’s going to fill him up soon, leave his mark inside of Dean, a brand to match the handprint on his shoulder, the sigils carved into his ribs. Castiel has marked him from the inside out; written himself into Dean’s body, remade him, knitted his flesh back together, breathed air back into his lungs. He’s filled Dean with life, with purpose, and given himself over to Dean, given himself
He cuts himself off with a gasp as Cas’ hand on his back slides lower, the tip of one lube-slick finger nudging against where he’s already stretched wide. It’ll burn, and Dean will ache tomorrow, but suddenly it’s all he wants, and he nods desperately, says, “Yeah, do it, please. Want you to,” and Cas catches him in another kiss, tongue slipping hot into Dean’s mouth, shutting him up.
And after Cas’ last words to him, right before he disappeared? Dean knows that sometimes you just have to face the music. It’s pretty clear where he sits on the totem pole.
Sam must realize the same thing, because he stumbles forward, trying to shield his own eyes from the blinding light, and puts a hand on Rowena’s shoulder, shaking her vigorously. “Rowena, stop!” he calls out, shouting to make his voice heard over her own. “Rowena! Stop the spell!”
By the time the plane jerks and disconnects from the gate, Dean is firmly entrenched in Master of Puppets, eyes shut tight as he focuses on the music. His heart speeds up rapidly, and he grips Cas’ hand tight enough to know that it probably hurts, but that’s the price Cas has to pay to make Dean fly. He should’ve asked one of the doctors at the hospital for an Ambien prescription or something, just to knock him out. An abuse of his position? Maybe. Infinitely better than being conscious for a whole flight to California? Absolutely.
The man’s eyes keep up at first, but there is a noticeable lag as Dean keeps going, and he puts his finger back down. “I’m pretty sure you have a concussion, though I can’t say for sure unless you let me take you to the hospital and do either an MRI or CT scan --”
As they leave the restaurant, Dean marvels at how clear the evening is, looking out across the water until the horizon line fades into the darkening night sky.
Back inside the apartment, Dean goes and pours Cas a glass of water and says, “Drink this slowly,” as he hands it to him.
get along. A wicked glint appears in Cas’ eyes, and he says, “But I don’t think I’ll have to worry about that while we’re here, I’ve got a pretty good plan to tire you out at night.”
On the other side of the clearing, Sam helps Rowena stand, the two of them clearly exhausted but otherwise unharmed. Dean uses the wall of the cabin to stand as well, the back of his head still aching, but he no longer feels like he wants to throw up when he moves. Body stiff and battered, he limps his way over to his brother and Rowena.
“Hey, Dean! Come on in. And this is your friend, I’m guessing?” he asks, stepping back to let them in. An oak-panelled hallway stretches behind him, lit by dim sconces in burnished copper sheaths. The smell of fresh coffee floats down the length of the corridor.
“No,” Dean grumps. He can hear Cas turning on the TV in the living room. “Look, dude, I just wanted to see if you were free for lunch someday soon. We haven’t seen each other in forever, and I miss my brother.”
Once he’s out of earshot, Dean grabs a pillow from behind his head and presses it over his face, letting the fluffy darkness overtake him. Above him, Cas shifts to sit beside him on the bed. Dean mourns the loss of contact, but he understands. His boner is pretty effectively dead at this point, and he doesn’t think he can get it up again any time soon. He presses the pillow into his face a little more firmly.
Dean grumbles but agrees, and starts looking into other transportation options. He doesn’t want to risk Baby’s undercarriage on the wintry northern roads, especially not when his very touch seems to make her break down. They also have to make sure that at least one set of their fake passports still work. If Charlie’s golden credit card got shut down, they don’t need to try their luck against the federal government
Dean feels his mouth drop open on an automatic deflection, but he doesn’t get any words out in time.
“Goddammit,” Dean snaps, ending the call and flinging his phone down onto the seat next to him. He’s tried to call Sam over a dozen times in the past twenty minutes, and has left three different voicemails; even with Sam ignoring his existence, he would’ve picked up after the third consecutive call. They always did, in case it was an emergency.
, and Dean’s own eyes widen as a partially-shifted werewolf leaps in front of him, claws scraping against the concrete.
Cas’ demeanor changes instantly, and he bares his teeth at them, his arm thrown across Dean’s chest like that will protect him. “You won’t hurt Dean,” he growls. “I won’t let you.”
of this place where you can get your luck back or whatever. I’m starting to think Garth made it up, or heard it from someone who did.”
Charlie chooses that moment to make her entrance, running through the plastic sheeting with an exaggerated cry, brandishing a small pocket knife and waving it around wildly. She stops, looking around as she realizes that the room is empty of any villains.
“It kinda is,” he says, a choked, bitter laugh bubbling up out of his throat. “Sammy is… he’s strong. He’s
. A moan tumbles from his lips at the feeling of Cas’ hardness digging into his thigh, presses his own into the hard line of Cas’ hip and grinds.
Cas must not have heard the door swing open or anything that Sam said, because he grinds his hips forward into Dean’s again, clearly annoyed by the fact that Dean has suddenly frozen. It drags a horrible, desperate moan from Dean’s mouth, and things seem to be moving in slow motion as the book drops from Sam’s hands, landing on the floor with a resounding thwap.
They walk down the hall towards Rowena’s office, but instead of going in there, Sam steers them through the workshop door, which Dean has only been through a couple of times. Dean says, “I’ve been good. Great, actually. Uh, this is kinda awkward, but I wanted to tell you this in person,” and then hesitates, trying to figure out the best way to word what he’s about to say.
Castiel is panting over him, and Dean didn’t think angels had to breathe, but maybe Cas came back different, somehow. More or less of an angel, Dean’s not sure, because Cas had died, exploded by an archangel, and Dean had said
“Thank you, Dean. I should probably head out now, my manager mentioned some training tapes that I need to begin reviewing immediately.” Cas sets down his fork and stands, adjusting the collar of his shirt awkwardly. Dean’s fingers itch to smooth it back down, and he gives in to the impulse, crossing the room to adjust the rumpled cloth. The tips of his fingers accidentally brush against the line of Cas’ throat for a moment, still a little stubbly even after he shaved that morning, and Dean has to fight back the shudder that tries to race up his spine.
“Trying to work with a migraine is hell on earth, believe me, I know. Don’t worry about it.” She gives him a kind smile.
That only makes the Empty laugh once more, cold and ringing. “Oh, Dean,” it says, and suddenly its hand lays feather-light on his cheek, fingertips brushing against his skin like it’s trying to push through a layer of plastic to get to him. Cas’ eyes stare at him with nothing but contempt in their depths. “Go ahead and wake up, then.”
Sam rolls his eyes. “I’m fine,” he insists, his own voice flat. “I’m working hard, but it’s not like I’m killing myself on this project or anything.”
Charlie stares at him, eyes shrewd, then sighs. “There’s a piece or two I’m missing that would help make this all make sense,” she says. “Are you sure you don’t know anything else?”
“Because I can change the world, Dean!” Sam shakes his head like a dog throwing off water, agitated. His eyes are feverishly bright in his pale and drawn face. “The work we’re doing could open doors and unlock mysteries, and figuring out how much power we’re capable of channeling is the first step. The experiments Rowena and I have been doing, they’ve taught us so much --”
“That’s why she’s the best at what she does.” Dean hands him the envelope. “Okay, you do the honors.”
behind his words. “And -- and forgiveness is tough, man. It’s hard. And with the grief, it’s like… some days are nearly impossible. And other days, it feels like I’m nearly there. Maybe I’ll get there, maybe I won’t. But if I’m gonna forgive him, then I need time. Sure, I can forgive him if he’s dead, but what good will that do either of us?” He sucks in a breath. “So I mean it, Cas. I really, really do. Please, stay. Let me help.”
“Yes, thank you, I can remember my own escapades quite clearly without you listing them off for me.” A manicured finger props against her red lips in thought. “When was Eloise?”
Dean moves past the racks of junk food and magazines towards a door with a red “Employees Only” sign hanging on the front. He pauses for a moment, then knocks softly. “Hey, Cas, it’s me,” he calls through the door. “I’m coming in, okay? I’ve got water and drugs for ya.” He waits another breath, just in case Cas is sitting in front of the door, and then opens it slowly.
cavities at the same time,” Dean hisses. “Chuck’s a petty son of a bitch, I wouldn’t put it past him!”
Castiel looks like he’s about to nod off again as Dean walks back into the living room. He’s made himself at home on Dean’s plaid couch that has definitely seen better days, leaned back against it like he’s taken many a nap on it before, the blanket falling down around his shoulders.
That ache from before blooms once more inside of Dean, and he lifts up his beer to show Sam. “Couldn’t sleep.”
,” she points out. “You’re obviously interested in him. And you guys are obviously good for each other. Why don’t you want to pursue anything!”
Shaking his head, Cas zips up his bag, setting it down on the couch. He picks up the silver hide, pulling it over his shoulders like a cloak. It settles awkwardly over him, a little too big, made to fit Uriel’s larger frame. Even though it looks a little strange, Cas seems to stand taller while he wears it. “The best thing you can do is forget about me,” he says. “Go home, watch out for Sam. But I have to go.”
Dean had nodded and made some vaguely sympathetic noises about research being the pits, but the truth was he was pretty fucking thrilled about Cas being back in the bunker for a bit. Things between them weren’t exactly fixed, but there had been a definite improvement since Purgatory. Lingering glances, familiar touches on the shoulder or back, conversations that didn’t devolve into hostile words and sarcasm within three minutes… Yeah, things were looking a lot better. Not even Sam burning dinner three nights in a row could put a damper on the strange bubble of lightness in Dean’s chest.
“How can you tell?” he says after a momentary struggle to coordinate signals between his brain and his mouth. The light turns green.
Castiel nods, and his eyes follow Dean’s finger perfectly. The hazy look he’d had is also gone, Dean notes. When he carefully runs his hands over Cas’ head, the painful bump has disappeared. “Okay, let’s try some basic questions,” he says. “What day is it?”
“Not that I’m not happy for you guys, and, obviously, thanks for saving us and everything,” he says, rubbing his hand through the hair at the back of his head, “but could we talk about next steps? I’m -- I’d love to go home. And maybe sleep for an entire month.”
Cas nods, serious. “Yes,” he agrees. He shifts Jack in his arms, his smile returning. “Then I guess you should know that I love you, too.”
, can feel the way sparks are beginning to shoot off inside of him. He wraps his arms around Cas, Cas’ name falling like a mantra from his lips, voice wrecked from the hitching moans Cas has pulled out of him. He’s so close, can feel it forming white-hot and inevitable in the pit of his stomach, and he makes himself open his eyes, wants to see Cas when it happens.
A small, whimpering cry rises up into the dawn light from the altar, and Nick shushes it, holding a finger to his lips. The cry quiets immediately. “Don’t wake the baby,” he mocks, shaking Dean like a ragdoll in the air.
The man -- Nick, he’d said his name was Nick -- smirks as he realizes Dean recognizes him as well. “I guess I should thank you just as much as your brother and the witch for setting all this up for me,” he says. “After all, you kept Castiel so happily distracted for me for such a long time. And you kept pushing Sam to commit himself ever deeper to the project. Honestly, Dean, I couldn’t have done this without you.”
“Sam?” she asks, pulling away slightly to look into his eyes, and even from the other side of the Impala, Dean can see the joy running like a live current through his little brother’s mind.
“Whatever the source of your power is, it’s missing,” Rowena explains. “The residue you have retained is burning bright for now, but without the source to replenish it, it will dwindle away. And, unfortunately, without the source, we cannot run the tracking spell.”
“Dean, are you alright?” Cas asks instead of answering him. He kneels down next to Dean, hands hesitant as he carefully pushes the mangled hem of Dean’s pants up his calf and out of the wound. “Are you bitten?”
“Fine. You have to be nice to me or I won’t return this morning’s favor later.” Cas smirks dangerously.
“You can try,” he says, trying for a confident smirk in return. He’s always been a master at fake it ‘til you make it.
Sam shuffles next to him. “There was -- was some kind of power surge, I think. I dunno. And then, well.” He gestures at the monitor. “This started happening.”
There’s a part of him that knows Sam probably didn’t mean it, but it’s a quiet part, buried underneath worry and hurt and a few more complicated emotions that Dean really doesn’t have the energy to deal with right now. He and Sam have always known how to push each other’s buttons, and Dean
Dean tries to concentrate, the muscles in his thighs starting to burn as he rises up off of Cas’ cock, pressure building at the base of his spine. “Fuck me, Cas, c’mon,” he begs, “please, more, I can’t--!”
Dean can feel his heart hammering away in his chest as he comes down, his breathing loud in his own ears. Castiel is slumped over him, warm and heavy and alive, and Dean’s come is sticky and gross between them, Cas’ cock slowly growing soft inside of Dean, and it’s going to be uncomfortable if they don’t move soon, but Dean can’t. Can’t make himself push Cas off, push him away.
Before Nick has time to react, Cas runs up behind him and stabs the blade into his back. Nick chokes and stumbles, dropping Dean to the ground and staring down at the bloodied silver tip protruding from his chest.
, he thinks, thoughts a little hazy through the bright pain. His knee feels like there are several knives embedded in it. “Ow,” he says.
“See you soon, red,” he says, and tries to convey the promise implied in that statement. He’s not sure Charlie believes him. He’s not sure he believes himself.
“It is an odd thing to hold against you,” Cas says, not disagreeing with him. Dean tamps down on the automatic
“What the fuck is wrong with me,” he mutters, and packs himself off to work. He needs to get his head on straight for the day -- things have been picking up over the past few weeks, and there’s a lady in the long-term thoracic care unit who keeps demanding that Dean, and only Dean, bring her lime jello every two hours when he’s on shift.
For a moment, the only sounds are the muted lapping of the waves against the shore and the crying of seabirds wheeling in the dawn sky. A high, thin wail breaks out over the scene.
He feels like he’s about to crawl out of his skin but Cas keeps the pace of his hand slow and easy, and Dean curses and moans beneath him, pulling at the sheets. “Please, Cas,” he gasps, heat rising like a tide inside him. He needs more; he needs
He hands the elephant to Jack, who grabs it immediately. “Can you watch him for a sec, I’m gonna go grab Sam’s gift,” he says, zipping the bag back up and storing it on the floor.
“You know I don’t understand that reference,” he says, but the lines on his forehead are already starting to smooth out a bit, so Dean takes the win where he can.
After she leaves, Dean putters around as silently as he can for a few more minutes, strangely reluctant to wake Cas’ sleeping form. He looks so relaxed, his face free of any of the unconscious lines of stress he carries during the day. It’s been a few weeks since his last migraine, and sometimes Dean can hear him tossing and turning restlessly at night. In the grand scheme of things, it’s only been a few months since they met, but Dean can tell that Cas chafes against feeling helpless; he prefers to act, to try to change things for the better, but he can’t because he has no memory of himself. Dean’s heart aches, and he lets himself, just for one moment, run his fingers through Cas’ unruly hair in a wordless attempt at cowardly affection.
He’d missed this so much, missed the feel of Cas’ lips on his, their stubble brushing together, the… sloppy wetness?
Which is the only reason Dean is able to hear a muffled thump coming from the head of an alley as he passes. Startled, he looks down the space, trying to make out any shapes from the early morning gloom. He thinks there might be a dumpster back there -- maybe a raccoon or something got caught in it? Should he call Animal Control? A vet?
The message cuts off. Silence hangs in the air between the two of them for a beat, then Charlie rips out her own phone, tapping furiously. “There’s a North Cove, Washington about an eighteen hour drive from here,” she says. “Right on the beach. They’ve got a good head start on us, but we’ve got a chance.”
“It’s not a waste,” Cas says, but he leans back, getting to his feet and helping Dean up. His knee twinges a bit, and his head still aches, but Dean pushes it all down so he can look into Cas’ eyes, then at the scattered bottles on the ground.
“Uh,” Dean stutters, and yup, that’s definitely his brain dribbling out of his ears, “Y-yeah, just a sec.”
Well, if there’s someone waiting inside to murder him, then at least they’re being polite about it. Or maybe he did just forget to lock his door when he left for work. He can barely remember driving home; he sure as hell can’t remember what he did just a few hours ago.
Surprise flits across Castiel’s face. “Thank you, Dean,” he says, and the sincerity in his voice makes Dean’s palms sweat just a bit. “I really appreciate what you’re doing to help me. I don’t know what I can do to repay you.”
“Yeah, which sucks. They’re just hurting people by doing that. You shouldn’t go into nursing, or into medicine at all, honestly, if you can’t commit to providing the best quality of care you can give to every single patient you meet.”
“Me too,” Dean says, turning down the street for the Gas-n-Sip. It’s large yellow sign glows brightly above the street. “Hey, I’m about to park, so I’m going to hang up now.”
Dean points at the various lines. “You’ve got your heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, respiration, and temperature. All pretty self-explanatory, right? Depending on what those readings are, the monitor may sound alarms. Since you just have this one piece, I wouldn’t worry too much about trying to put any software on your work computers that will let you turn off the alarms remotely. Actually, you probably shouldn’t do that at all. Always check the alarms.” He’s slipping into teaching mode, but it’s hard to stop himself when this is almost word-for-word what he says when students shadow him. “If an alarm sounds, figure out why. Most of the time, it’s because one of the sensors isn’t picking up any information because it’s come loose or something. While that’s the common explanation, don’t let yourself get too comfy.”
The muffled sound of spray hitting tile is all Dean can hear for a moment, and then a deep, low singing joins it. It’s hard to make out over the hissing of the pipes and through the wall, but Dean swears Cas is singing Led Zeppelin. Maybe “Stairway to Heaven,” though he’s not sure. Cas’ soft baritone weaves in and out with the water, a kind of soothing white noise that makes Dean’s eyes feel heavy and sends his mind drifting back towards sleep.
The outside of the cottage is weather beaten but well-maintained, with a small deck off the back that has steps down to a short trail that leads to the beach. Cas stands on his toes and runs his hand across the top of the doorframe to retrieve the key. The interior is spare but homey, the furniture old and worn but sturdy. The bedroom has a large window that looks out on the beach, promising what Dean can only imagine will be some pretty spectacular sunsets. The sheets on the bed are clean and there are towels in the bathroom, and Cas finds a coffee maker under the kitchen sink. Dean feels the rest of the tension from the flight melt slowly from his bones.
“I died for you, Dean,” he had said, and it wasn’t an accusation, but Dean felt it stab through him anyway, inexorable.
yartz. You gotta relax. It’s going to be fine.” He pauses, considering. “Well, it’s probably going to be fine. I wouldn’t worry until you have to do a night shift, that’s when shit gets wild.”
Dean grits his teeth, spinning around in a frustrated circle. Papers crunch and tear beneath him. “Charlie, please, we gotta focus here. We can talk about Cas after I find Sam. Please, I need you to help me here.”
Cas lifts his head, and Dean can’t really see his face, but he thinks he glimpses the beginnings of a smile. He mumbles, “Thank you, Dean,” and takes the proffered items. After a moment, he hands the water bottle back to Dean and turns his face down again. “Give me a moment,” he says, muffled, “and then we’ll leave.”
“Honestly, Charlie, I don’t know much more than what I’ve already told you. I saw Cas, he said I had to get Sam and Rowena to stop what they’re working on, but Sam isn’t answering his phone and their office is a fucking mess right now. There’s some blood, and all their spell stuff is trashed, but neither of them are here, so I’m pretty sure they’ve been taken!” He can hear himself panicking more and more with every word as the gravity of the situation really hits him. God, he shouldn’t have kissed Cas last night, he shouldn’t have fallen asleep, he should’ve just gone directly to Sam and told him to stop, and maybe he and Rowena would be here and safe right now. But instead, Dean had been weak, and selfish, and now his brother was missing and it was his fucking fault.
, Cas, whether or not you get your memories back, I promise I’ll still be your friend. Unless you’re a serial killer, I guess.”
Cas’ mouth twists in an amused smile. “No, that just about covers it. I didn’t plan anything because I wanted to make sure you had the chance to relax. You’ve been pretty stressed out lately.”
“Well, yeah. I mean, the hospital isn’t exactly the best comparison to make, because work there can be a little more seasonal than you realize. People go nuts during the summer, when the weather is nice and you can spend more time outside. Winter night shifts can be pretty boring, but summertime is a challenge.” Dean blows out a breath, shaking his head absently. “The stories I could tell, honestly. Let me know when you work your first night shift, I’ll try to stop by during it and help keep you awake.”
Dean blinks, trying to figure out if his eyes are playing tricks on him in the moonlight as the three shapes shift and extend, a silvery outline sloughing off their backs as they stand, forming into humanoid shapes. The figures move forward towards the shore, legs gaining definition with each step, round black eyes shifting and elongating, turning human, gazes cold and dispassionate. Flippers transform into fingers, gray skin disappears as human flesh takes its place, and Dean stands there, frozen, as three selkies step out of the ocean and take human form in front of him.
A horrible prospect crosses his mind, and he knows Cas is thinking the same thing at the look of shock that flashes across his face.
Every story he reads about seal-maidens being forced to live on land by spouses who hide their skins away makes him feel sick. Dean obviously didn’t take Cas’ seal-skin, but he wonders if that’s how Cas secretly felt while living with him: trapped and powerless, unable to escape and wanting to return to a life that he may not have remembered but longed for. Cas had told Dean that he was happy, but that could have been a lie; no wonder he leapt back into the ocean as soon as he was able. Dean was a poor consolation prize compared to the complete freedom of the sea.
Cas dives under the water. Dean’s too far away to see all the details, but he follows the rippling line across the surface of the lake as Cas moves. He waits for Cas to come back up.
“I get it, Cas, I swear,” Dean says, trying to give him an encouraging smile. “And I’m not just saying that. I’ve lost important people, too; people I love. My parents. Almost lost Sam once, too, and I never want to go through that again.” The smile slips from his face, and he puts a hand on Cas’ shoulder, incredibly serious. “I ain’t going anywhere. Not if I can help it.”
!” It shouts the last word, flying up so close to Dean that he has to flinch away, the fury a living thing between them. The Empty’s chest heaves, but Dean can’t feel any hot breath against his face. “Why are you here! I want to sleep!”
“He can walk here,” Dean growls, but he slumps over, forcibly making himself stop fidgeting. “Man, I know he can get wrapped up in his work sometimes, but he’s never been this late before. Especially not when it’s been like two months since we’ve hung out.”
worth my life, because it’ll be fine. I’ll be fine, I swear. I’m strong, Dean, and I’m getting stronger. I know you can’t wrap your head around it, but maybe one day you’ll understand. Rowena and I… we’re the only ones who can do this.”
“Of course,” Dean says, unhooking his own mask and glancing down at the faun on the bed. His skin is a pale, washed-out color, eyes closed, face peaceful. Red hair curls tightly around two stubby horns poking up from the top of his head. Dean unclips the oxygen monitor from the tip of the faun’s finger, turns off the heart rate monitor that shows nothing but a flat line. The family will be in here soon, and Dean doesn’t want them to have to deal with all the machines currently droning around them.
The door to the restaurant opens with a jingle, and Sam comes hurrying inside, sliding into the booth next to Cas. “Sorry,” he apologizes, “I just got super caught up in what I was doing and completely lost track of time. Have you guys ordered yet?”
“Oh, uh, it’s okay,” Dean says, heart suddenly beating a mile a minute in his chest. Sponge baths are
His nose collides painfully with Cas’ chin, and something feels like it’s snapped in his knee as he goes down with a shout. His bruised tailbone from earlier flares as he lands on the hard floor (again). He thinks he knocks his head into the edge of the bed frame, but he’s not really sure, but the sharp pain at the base of his skull confirms it.
“Right,” Dean says, looking nervously at Sam, who just kind of shrugs. Rowena appears to be particularly short-tempered today; it’s probably best to just do what she wants and get out of the way. “Okay, so I just need the connections that came with this, and I’ll plug ‘em in and show Sam what’s what.”
“I said no hospitals!” the man snaps, and his eyes seem to glow in the dim light of the alley with the ferocity of his words. “They’ll fi --” he cuts off with another harsh round of coughing, spitting out blood with a groan onto the pavement and clutching his side.
He turns to look at Cas, who shakes his head. “It’s over, Lucifer,” Cas says, and Dean reels on the ground, trying to keep up.
A hand on his shoulder stops him. “I’m sorry if I worried you,” Cas says, “but I think I’m okay. Being in the water is --” he pauses, clearly searching for the right words. “It’s amazing,” he finishes. “It feels very peaceful here.”
“Just wanted to check in and see how things are going.” Dean glances through the spice cabinet and grabs the salt, tossing a generous handful onto the popcorn for Cas. “How’s that research project treating ya? You and Rowena close to a worldchanging breakthrough yet?”
A vague sense of nausea wells up in Dean’s stomach as he watches his brother gesticulate excitedly across the table from him. The whole scene is a little too familiar for comfort -- the pale skin, dark circles under too-bright eyes, an intense kind of mania layered over poorly hidden exhaustion, the single-minded focus to the exclusion of all else. Not eating, clearly not sleeping.
“Come in,” a lilting voice calls from inside. Sam pushes open the door, revealing Rowena perched on top of a large mahogany desk, scribbling notes down on a pad, a flowing blue gown draped elegantly down her shoulders. A delicate-looking china teacup hovers in the air next to her, steam wisping from the surface. She looks up as the three of them enter, taking the cup and sipping from it. “Samuel, I’ve told you,” she admonishes, “you don’t have to knock before coming into my office.”
Cas doesn’t tease him much more, though, just presses against Dean until the head slips inside. They both gasp, and Cas looks down between them, watches himself sink into Dean’s body, gripping Dean’s hips so tight there will no doubt be bruises tomorrow. He pushes into the hilt, pausing just long enough for Dean to adjust, then pulls back out again, keeping his thrusts slow but hard, filling Dean over and over.
There’s silence on the other end of the line. Charlie says, “Okay, Dean. I’ll talk to you later,” and her voice is soft and tired, and Dean closes his eyes, but takes the out, because he’s weak and awful like that.
.” He hisses the last part at Dean through his teeth. “What’s happening now with my improved abilities? My new strength? It’s because I’m working my ass off to get better. To help others. Because that’s what you taught me to do! So stop treating me like a bomb about to go off, and fucking trust me for once!”
“Aye, Samuel’s right,” Rowena confirms, stepping back a bit from Castiel but still squinting up at him, like she’s looking directly at a relatively bright light. “Do you have anything that could be a token from a family member? A small photograph, perhaps, or a wedding ring? A piece of clothing?”
A gentle hand lands on his shoulder. Patience, one of the interns, gives him a soft smile. “I’ll handle this,” she says, urging him towards the hallway. “Go get the paperwork done so you can get out of here.”
Cas nods, like he’s filing away that information for another time. “I can see how that would be the case. You like to work directly with people and help them. Being able to train that way is more beneficial for both you and your patients. No wonder you’re so skilled at your job.”
“Dean… in case something goes wrong and I don’t make it back, there’s something you and Sam need to know.”
Not that he regrets making the deal for Jack’s life. He could never regret that, not when it saved Jack from an immediate eternity in the vast nothing of the Empty. No, what Castiel regrets is that now Dean is burdened with this knowledge, too. That now Dean will look at him and see a dead man walking, and know he can do nothing about it.
Cas looks up at him, and Dean can’t really see his eyes in the darkness but he knows they’re dangerous, then swallows Dean down. His mouth is hot and wet, his tongue dragging slow and maddening up the underside of Dean’s dick as he bobs up and down, pausing to press the tip of his tongue into the slit at the head. The suction is just shy of not enough, and Dean’s thighs shake as he pulls at Cas’ hair with a groan. “Cas,” he says, and fuck, he sounds
Sam puts a few dollars on the table. “I’m going back to work. I’ll talk to you later, maybe.” He starts to leave.
when it swings open and Sam steps inside, frowning down at a book in his hands. “So get this,” he says, and then looks directly into Dean’s eyes over Cas’ shoulder.
“Yeah, he blew me off for lunch again, but I actually got to talk to him for a bit this time, which was nice,” Dean huffs. “Still waist-deep in his research, the nerd.”
The sky is filled with gunmetal gray clouds by the time Dean makes it over to Rowena’s office, parking on the street and tugging his collar up against the sharp wind that’s started since he left his apartment. Maybe an early winter storm is on its way. Dean glances up nervously. If it snows, he’s screwed. Baby isn’t the best on snow and ice, and normally he changes out her tires if he has to drive her in winter weather.
“It’s fine, Sam,” Dean cuts him off, pulling two more bottles out. He pops the lid on one, offers it to Sam, who shakes his head silently. “If you ain’t gonna join me for a drink, then go back to bed. Go back to Eileen.” Yeah, he’s not proud of the way his voice cracks on her name, but oh well.
Castiel nods and picks the blanket up off the floor. “Where should I leave it when I wake up?” he asks.
Castiel nearly smiles at Dean’s question, because he expected this. Dean’s eyes are flinty, jaw suddenly clenched in trepidation and the first wisps of his deep-seated anger.
Charlie’s faint laugh follows him as he opens the fridge with a snort. “Nah, I’m a regular degular human just like you and Dean. He calls me a technomancer because he’s a nerd who’s read one too many bad sci-fi books.”
Cas sends one last hard look at Benny’s back, then turns back to Dean. “He’s one of your friends?” he asks, and Dean snorts at his disbelieving tone.
Dean stiffens, all the breath rushing out of his body like he’s just been punched. Because Sam may have carelessly mentioned Dean’s magical deficiencies in the past, but he never implied that he thought Dean was
“How did I let you convince me this was a good idea,” Dean mutters, trying not to let his hands shake as he hauls his duffel bag into the overhead bin. “We should’ve just driven down to the Gulf.”
They pull up to a nondescript concrete and metal warehouse, the kind that was obviously built to be temporary but ended up sticking around over the years. Dean parks on the street, apprehension twisting in his gut. “Stay here,” he tells Charlie. “I’ll let you know when it’s safe to come in.”
Dean doesn’t respond. A couple of glass bottles holding spell ingredients on a worktable shatter as he passes with a sharp breaking sound; he flinches, hard, but keeps going. He can’t look back now. If he does… if he does, he’ll shatter, too.
“Hey, that’s cheating! Uh, I mean,” Dean stutters, “it would be cheating if I had a favorite. Which I don’t. Like I said, more Sam’s thing.”
“You’re not overstaying anything,” Dean interrupts. “Seriously, I’m more than happy to keep helping, I promise. I ain’t gonna stop you if you want to leave, but I’m also not gonna make you go.”
The water here is a much deeper shade of blue, the sunlight glinting off it like a postcard. Dean licks his lips as a salty breeze ruffles his hair. Overhead, seagulls and other ocean birds wheel through the sky, their sharp cries mixing with the rhythm of the waves as they wash over the sand.
“You’d better be fucking passed out at your desk,” he growls to the air, brows drawn low as he navigates the streets to Rowena’s office. Post-rush hour there aren’t many cars on the road with him, but he blows past a couple of minivans that are making the mistake of actually driving the speed limit.
“What do you need?” Cas asks him, sliding his fist up Dean’s dick and twisting at the head. He bites, open-mouthed, at the cord of Dean’s neck. “Tell me, Dean.”
“Do you want the rest of your food to-go?” Cas asks, the first words he’s spoken since the argument started.
. But he’s also so fucking scared for him, playing around with forces and powers that still defy explanation, no matter how deeply they are studied or understood. Sam’s good at what he does, obviously, and Rowena is an excellent mentor, but the allure of strength is hard to ignore. Whether it’s natural or synthetic, Dean has firsthand experience on how it can suck Sam in and twist him until he hardly recognizes his little brother. He never wants to listen to his brother scream in agony as he detoxes ever again.
“Yeah,” he’d croaked, could feel hot puffs of breath from Cas’ mouth against his neck. It wasn’t an apology, though he’d meant it as one. Dean hadn’t known what else to say. He’d clenched his hands into fists in the back of Castiel’s coat, bunched tan fabric between his fingers. Tried to feel for any differences. To feel if Cas wasn’t real, had been brought back wrong. But it was him, as far as Dean could tell, angel made flesh once more, pinning Dean to the wall. And then there had been a hard thigh between his legs, lips on his, possessive, consuming, and Dean’s head hadn’t stopped spinning as Castiel moved him like he was nothing.
Dean is washing some dishes in the sink when his phone starts buzzing wildly on the countertop, Cas’ name flashing across the screen. He frowns and dries his hands; Cas is very diligent about not using his phone when he’s at work, even when it’s totally dead at the gas station.
“I don’t believe that for one second.” Benny folds his arms on the table and leans across towards Dean. “I saw the way he looked at you, brother, every time you two sat in this booth. You’re more important to him than you realize.”
Heat crawls up the back of Dean’s neck; he knows that it’s obvious he’s nervous, but he didn’t think it was that bad yet. “I hate planes,” he whines, sinking down. His knees bump against the seatback in front of him; the occupant, a teenage girl with red eyes, turns around and bares her fangs through the gap between the seats.
Cas is staring down between them, brows knit tightly, and Dean realizes that he’s still… soft. Like “I’ve been reading about horrible witch rituals and all their nasty bodily fluids for the past three hours” soft.
“Oh. Thank you,” Cas says, sounding confused. Dean attempts to bite back a chuckle, which turns into a weird choked noise in his throat instead, and proceeds to studiously ignore Sam’s glance.
“Want you,” he gasps out, whining when Cas releases his grip on them in favor of sucking a line of kisses down Dean’s throat to his chest, teeth biting carefully at his nipple. They bite harder when Dean moans, tugging until the bud is just beginning to ache, and then move to the other side, lavishing the same amount of attention on his second nipple. Dean shakes, lets his thighs go easy and wide so Cas can slot between them. He lets his hands thread through Cas’ hair, pulling at it as Cas moves down his chest and stomach, leaving little red marks dotted across the skin of Dean’s hips.
Dean realizes he’s standing in the doorway to his room, staring blankly at his bed, blankets made with military precision to belie the rows of empty beer bottles ringed around it. He’d had a shot (or two, or three) before burning Lee’s body, but his fingers itch again to close around cool glass. Knows he shouldn’t, but there’s a bottle of Jim Beam under the mattress for situations like this, and he fishes it out, cracks the seal and takes a long swig, fire rushing down his throat to settle uneasily in his stomach. It burns. He wishes it hurt worse.
That pulls a sigh from Dean. “I was hoping you hadn’t really noticed,” he tries to joke, but it falls flat between them.
Cas’ face shifts, and he pulls his fingers out of Dean, hands shaking as he picks up the bottle of lube and drizzles even more into one palm. He jacks himself quickly, spreading the lube around, then grabs Dean’s hips, moving him until he’s practically in Cas’ lap, thighs spread wide around Cas’ hips. Heat rushes up Dean’s face, but he forgets about it quickly as the head of Cas’ dick tags against his hole and he groans; he doesn’t have any leverage like this, can’t buck his hips or grind down. Can only take what Cas gives him.
“Well, at least you’re seeing someone,” Charlie responds, though she sounds a little hesitant. “I know things have been weird between you and Sam, though. Seriously, I can come run interference if you want. It’s been a while since we’ve hung out, man. Also I can’t remember the last time I saw Sam.”
“You always were a sharp tracker, Castiel,” a voice calls, authoritative and deep. “Though you lack follow through, as I recall.”
“What does it feel like to have magic?” Cas asks, and Dean startles and flips a pancake too quickly, smushing it into a weird shape in the pan. He curses, trying to poke it back into something that is more pancake-shaped than an amorphous blob.
Dean waves over his shoulder as he walks out of the diner, the door jingling loudly as it shuts behind him. The cold winds of late autumn sweep down the street, making him flip up the collar of his jacket around his neck. He runs a hand down his face, exhaustion making a home for itself in the space behind his eyes. They burn and prickle slightly in the chilly air and he blinks rapidly to stop himself from tearing up.
, and none of them with any signs of acute trauma other than, you know, having gone suddenly blind. And from what they all told me, they all went blind at approximately the same time this morning.”
Uriel shakes his head, still moving forward. The other two spread out, surrounding Dean and Cas. “Still nothing? Without your skin we knew you’d be easy to take down, but like this? Well, it’s practically child’s play at this point.”
“Sorry, red,” he says, reaching into his wallet and shoving a wad of bills at her. “If this doesn’t cover a hotel room or a car or whatever, let me know later.”
When he comes back out, Dean has about thirty seconds of functionality to consider the fact that he has royally fucked up, and then his brain just completely shuts down, because Cas is shirtless and in swim trunks, and holy shit did Dean miscalculate. Cas’ legs are muscular and long, and somehow he already seems tan, even though Dean
“No Quarter” rumbles through the speakers, Robert Plant’s hazy vocals punctuated by the driving guitar. Dean tunnel-visions on the asphalt of the road so hard that everything around him dissolves into the gray mist of the rain that’s still coming down, punctuated by the
Cas nods, standing up and holding out a hand to Dean, lifting him off the couch when Dean takes it. They walk down the dark, quiet hall to Dean’s (their) room, shedding their clothes inside the door. Cas puts his hands on Dean’s waist, kissing him as he pushes him down onto the bed, sliding on top of him as the mattress creaks under their weight.
to be something here, some sort of clue. Charlie is incredibly accurate at tracking cell signals; it would take a miracle to fool her about this.
It works. Charlie’s eyes glitter at the prospect of a challenge. “Alright, what’ve you got, Winchester?” she asks, grabbing her backpack and sliding her laptop out like she’s ready to wade into battle.
“Billie was going to kill us,” he says, and puts the beer down unsteadily, not caring that it tips over with a clang as he studiously ignores Sam. He grips the kitchen counter with both hands, trying to keep his knees locked so that he doesn’t slide to the floor again. “Cas’d -- he’d made a deal with the Empty. For Jack’s life. When he experienced a moment of -- of true happiness… the Empty would come for him. And when he summoned it, it took him and Billie.”
“Do you think this is Chuck?” he asks, the sudden horror hitting him like a sack of bricks thrown from a fourth-story window. “Is God making my dick limp?”
“Something we wouldn’t have to worry about if we just flew to Kansas,” Cas says, but the smirk on his face lets Dean know he’s joking.
Dean turns around so fast he nearly gives himself whiplash. Cas is standing there, trenchcoat and all, whole and radiant and so fucking real that Dean almost trips as he stumbles across the ground to wrap him in a hug.
“That was not fifteen minutes,” Dean says, and she jumps a bit as she realizes he’s standing out of the light by the wall.
“She didn’t want to disturb you, sorry,” Dean apologizes. Cas nods and stands all the way up, stretching his back until an audible crack flashes through the room. “Shit, Cas, you gotta start stretching more, dude,” he says with a wince.
There are still people watching them from the shore, and Dean is increasingly aware of how uncomfortable he is in his soaked clothes. “Well, I’m gonna go… change,” he mutters, wading forward. “And have another beer.” Maybe another two beers. He needs it.
He pauses, takes a breath, his heart knocking crazily in his chest, the same way it did back when they were in Purgatory, back when he’d gotten so close to telling Cas only to be cut off. But Cas doesn’t cut him off now, just stands in front of him with his eyes wide, the blue of them reflecting the sun’s light back at Dean. Eyes like the sky, and Dean wants to see them looking at him every day.
Watching him walk out the door is a surreal experience, Dean has to admit. He feels, weirdly, a strange sense of pride, like he had the first time he’d watched Sam go off to school by himself.
Dean stops himself from rolling his eyes and blowing this guy off. “No, I was just… dropping something off for my brother. He’s her apprentice. Look, they’re super busy right now, dude, I don’t think Rowena can help you with whatever you’re trying to do. I’d go look for another witch for help.”
“You’re the Empty,” Dean realizes. “But I thought you were -- Sam said you looked like Meg. When he saw you.” His brain feels like it’s churning through molasses, trying to piece together whatever strange dream-logic his subconscious is throwing at him.
“Um,” Sam says, looking after her with concern. “It’s been a rough 48 hours or so. Lucifer was -- I think she’s taking this kind of hard.”
“I don’t give a shit about whatever you’re doing,” Dean coughs, pushing himself up to his feet. His head aches and his palms sting, and he’s so woefully underprepared for whatever’s going on here. “But I’m not leaving without my brother. Or Rowena. So if that means stopping you, then I guess that’s what I’m doing.”
It feels like ice pours down the back of Dean’s spine, mixing with the anger and turning it unbearably cold. “Wow,” Dean says, voice flat. “Okay, I see how it is.” He swallows against the lump that forms suddenly in his throat, trying to keep his face from showing anything. He doesn’t think he succeeds, because Cas makes a small noise and starts to reach out to him.
And Dean sure as hell doesn’t mind taking care of Cas -- he wouldn’t be a nurse if he didn’t like taking care of people -- but he also isn’t stupid. He generally knows when to step back and give someone the space they need to grow.
“I don’t know,” Cas responds. “According to Dean, I have one of the most severe cases of post-traumatic retrograde amnesia he’s ever seen, so maybe I have seen it but don’t remember. What is it?”
He doesn’t do much more than stick his head into the workroom, finding it just as messy and destroyed as Rowena’s office. Glass shards litter the ground like stars, twinkling through paper and crushed cabinets and spell ingredients. The medical monitor still sits in the back, the screens both smashed and dark.
Out the small window he can see blue skies dotted with perfect white fluffy clouds, palm trees swaying in a soft breeze. It’s the middle of September but looks like the perfect height of summer here; it also means the beach will be pretty empty, all the kids back in school. Dean grins, already planning an epic beach cookout for the two of them. A bonfire, hot dogs, lots of beer, some s’mores -- yeah, this’ll be amazing. Maybe even worth the flight.
But Uriel just grabs Dean by the throat, lifting him up into the air. Dean chokes, scrabbling at the hand clenched tight around his airway, legs kicking wildly. The selkie bares his teeth in a menacing smile, white against the darkness, squeezing his hand tighter. “Getting rid of you mud monkeys is going to be so satisfying,” he says. “How fitting to start with you, interloper.” Dean writhes and struggles in his grip, dark spots creeping up at the side of his vision as he fights for air. He can feel his hands getting weaker as he loses oxygen, wonders if he’ll die of asphyxia or because his windpipe gets crushed.
And then the phone grows hot, almost too hot to hold. Dean gasps and loosens his grip, just as Sam’s voice begins speaking in what is clearly a hushed whisper but comes through loud and clear in Dean’s hand.
“Oh man, you have no idea. It’s fascinating, and it also makes me wonder about the existence of possibly undiscovered shifting-based organisms, you know? Like, all the different ways this could be harnessed and utilized in the world. Obviously werewolves and skinwalkers are very physical representations of this energy-harnessing, but it also has me thinking about other possibilities, like, like selkies or something.” There’s more hissing coming from the background of Sam’s call, and he sounds a little distracted as he talks. “Maybe the tales of them taking their skins off and transforming into humans is representative of another shifting phenomena that was difficult to observe, but fascinating to think about, right? Like, the idea of all that potential magic and energy being stored in a single physical item, and never depleting? It sounds too good to be true! But who knows!”
I’m going to finish what I started by killing the witches and the empty-sky child, and take the power that’s rightfully mine.”
Cas’ eyes have narrowed, and Dean is struck by the image of a predator tracking down prey. Or a threat. “There’s someone here,” he whispers to Dean, pulling him closer. “It doesn’t… something doesn’t feel right.” His head swivels back and forth; nothing seems off, but Dean feels uneasy.
Cas grabs Dean’s hands and holds them in his own. “It’s a little overwhelming, but not for the reasons you think,” he says, the confusion draining from his face and being replaced with a small, fond smile. “I don’t… have any specific memories of sex, but I know what I’m doing. And it’s you.” He reaches up and takes Dean’s face in his hands. “I trust you. I want this, I swear.”
“Him.” Gesturing towards Cas, Dean prepares his request. “As Cas just mentioned, he’s got some pretty severe post-traumatic retrograde amnesia. It’s nearly total memory loss. When I found him, he only remembered his first name, and he didn’t have any ID on him or anything. I asked Sam and Rowena for help, but they couldn’t do anything either. And I know that you need a bit more than
but wraps his own arms around Dean, fingers digging into his back, face tucked into the curve of Dean’s shoulder.
Cas makes a low, soft noise between them. Dean lets his hand slide forward, bumping over Cas’ knuckles and up his arm, just letting his fingers feel the shape of the muscle, learning. Cas brings his own hand up, cups his large, warm palm over the side of Dean’s neck, leaves it resting there. His thumb strokes lightly at the hair at the base of Dean’s neck.
“Stop them from doing what?” Dean asks, walking around the couch to take Cas’ face in his hands. Cas steps back, though; the sting of rejection slaps across Dean’s face so hard it feels like whiplash.
, and Dean would find that funnier if he weren’t about to explode from mortification. His throat works but no sound comes out, and Cas isn’t moving above him, completely still like a statue.
Nothing breaks the silence, and the call goes to voicemail once more. Dean hangs up and quickly calls Charlie instead, pacing back and forth in the ruined workroom, glass crunching underfoot.
The blood freezes in Dean’s veins, and he bolts up from the table, his half-finished beer forgotten. How could he have been so stupid? He never even thought to ask if Cas knew how to swim, if it was something Cas had maybe forgotten. Holy shit, he was so fucking irresponsible, he should have
He doesn’t waste anymore time after that, just turns his head to press an open-mouthed kiss to the hot shaft before wrapping a hand around the base and sucking Cas down. He tastes like skin and salt on Dean’s tongue, a little bitter from precome, and Dean bobs his head down and down, taking as much of him in as he can. Cas is
Some small voice inside of him screams that he needs to apologize, but he shoves that down and away, covering it over with fear and anger. It’s only three in the afternoon, but hey, it’s his day off. He’s allowed a drink. Maybe two.
By some miracle they don’t trip over any furniture, and then there’s a door at his back that it feels like Cas is trying to kiss him
One of the orderlies sighs and nods, scurrying down the hallway with her too-quick inhuman gait. Dean closes his eyes for just a moment, because he knows what comes next.
“Let me help you,” he begs, trying to switch tactics, because maybe this way he can convince Sam to step away, to realize the true implications of what he’s doing. “We’ll figure it out together, okay? How about that? Just… just step away from the magic for a bit, Sammy.”
They don’t turn on any lights when they get back, moving through the now-familiar rooms in darkness and near-total silence. Cas drapes the silvery hide over the back of the couch; he doesn’t move far away from it, just packs his bag as efficiently as possible. Dean watches him, trepidation settling like a stone in his gut.
“Thought you said you couldn’t hold beings with souls,” Dean says, eyes darting to the side. There’s nothing to help him, though, nothing but an endless stretch of black. He needs to get out of here. He needs to wake up. He digs his nails into the fleshy pads of his palms, trying to use the pricks of pain to force himself back to consciousness. It doesn’t work, the feeling muted even as he feels small drops of blood well up in his palms.
There’s a space between them that Dean put there, he knows. Or, he didn’t do it exactly--Cas did it, by leaving, by letting the bunker door slam shut behind him--but it’s a space that Dean forced into existence, that he shoved between them because it was easier than acknowledging what was already there.
Surprise rushes like a soft tide through Dean’s body, leaving him feeling warm and fuzzy. “Thanks,” he says, scrubbing the back of his neck a little awkwardly. “That’s… that means a lot, man.”
. “But that’s what everyone does, right? They leave you. They love you but they leave you, because they know you’re broken inside. Because you’re worth dying for, but not worth living for, hm?”
Sam's phone lights up as they cross the border from Kansas into Nebraska, an unknown number but a familiar name.
Rowena rolls her eyes and sets down her notepad. “Honestly, you walk in on one little tryst and immediately get your panties in a bunch. I thought I’d taught you better than that.”
On the other side of the diner, the door opens, letting a gaggle of teens in, all jostling one another as they come inside. Dean sees a couple flashes of sharp teeth, the long point of an ear, a few tufts of fur. Benny sighs and stands up from Dean and Cas’ table, clapping a hand on Dean’s shoulder as he does so. “Either they’re playing hooky or it’s parent-teacher conference day,” he says, “but I know hungry kids when I see ‘em. Good luck with your boy, Dean. See you around, brother.” He walks back into the kitchen just as one of the servers walks over to the group, notepad and pen in hand.
doing what I love, and I can tell you it’s a lot of hard fucking work. Whoever said that was trying to get people to drink the Kool-Aid.” He unlocks Baby and they both slide inside. The air has a slight chill to it, but the inside of the car is almost too warm from the sun beating down on it. On a whim, Dean slides his fingers through his box of tapes, finding a worn one and pushing it into the tape deck. Night Moves by Bob Seger begins crooning through the car, making Dean feel immediately better.
The man grunts as Dean lifts him up, his weight solid and heavy against Dean’s side. He looks down at himself like he’s only just realized he’s naked. “Oh,” he says, a note of surprise coloring his voice, “that’s… good?”
Cas clasps his large hands together in his lap, leaning forward. “You have to stop Sam and Rowena,” he says, his voice urgent. “The things they’re working on, the person they’re working for -- you have to stop them. There will be dire consequences otherwise.”
Cas is at his side in a flash, book forgotten on the couch. Dean nearly jumps out of his skin at how quickly and silently the dude moves -- no matter how long they’ve lived together, he doesn’t think he’ll ever get used to his roommate having the reflexes of a cat.
Whistling, Dean shuts the door to the Impala with a satisfying thud, checking to make sure she’s locked properly before he heads into Rowena’s office. A light mist drizzles down from the clouds overhead, blanketing the world in soft gray light. He can feel his hair getting wet, and he pulls up the collar of his jacket a little more around his neck. The rain feels bracing, honestly, and he can’t keep a grin off his face as he goes and knocks on the front door.
--wasn’t real, then the ending of it was. Though he hadn’t really expected it to end. Hadn’t expected Cas to walk away, even though he should’ve known better. Most people leave when they’re kicked.
He waits for the man to nod before pressing his fingertips down gently just above the ankle, applying light pressure to the skin and tissue. There doesn’t seem to be any shifting bone underneath his touch, which is a good sign. The man hisses out through his teeth but otherwise doesn’t make any noise.
The smile Cas gives him is at once radiant and devastating, just a small quirk of his lips. “I didn’t want to burden you, Dean. Not any more than I already have. I wanted you to make a choice for yourself, now that you’re finally free, without any pressure from -- from me. That’s the last thing I want.” He says the last part with the only hesitation on his face that Dean has seen since that horrible night in the bunker, and understanding rushes through him like a wave of force, followed by a second, softer wave of
“What the hell was that?” Dean demands, blinking rapidly as he tries to adjust back to the normal lighting of the room. There’s wetness on his cheeks -- he must’ve been crying, too. He scrubs at his face with the end of his sleeve. “Seriously, what the hell just happened? Was that normal?”
“What did you have in mind?” Cas asks, cocking his head to one side, curious. Dean gives him a real, if still slightly strained, smile this time.
Dean’s eyes travel down the line of Castiel’s back, looking over his handiwork to make sure he hasn’t missed anything and… oh. Castiel has dropped the blanket, his whole body on display. Powerful thighs connect to a well-muscled torso, his thick waist curving into his shapely ass --
Sam looks at him like he wants to keep talking, the way he would sometimes force words these kinds of conversations out of Dean when they were younger and still had so much space for pain. Instead, he nods, like he understands. Dean thinks maybe he actually does.
Cas leans down and kisses him, snapping Dean’s spiral. “Whatever you’re thinking, it’s okay,” he says, giving him a warm smile.
Dean smooths a hand over Cas’ chest, waits until he’s certain that Cas is out for the night. A sharp, warm sensation stabs against his heart. “Love you, Cas,” he whispers, eyes on the moon floating outside the window.
Sam’s face crumples somewhere between distress and frustration, a tired light in his eyes. “You love him,” he says, and it sounds so simple. Easy. The words don’t hold the same weight on Sam’s tongue that they do in Dean’s brain. They don’t bang around the inside of Sam’s ribcage like they do in Dean’s, bruising his heart until it nearly breaks.
He keeps the pace slow and easy, adding another two fingers one at a time, stretching Dean open and curling them against his prostate in an irregular rhythm that has Dean panting and twisting beneath him. He murmurs Dean’s name over and over again, voice low and throaty, eyes half-lidded but bright, watching.
The Empty shakes its head. “How are you this good at lying to yourself? How can you not see the truth? He loved you and he left you, because no one stays for you, Dean. And this time, even though he’s escaped me, he didn’t go back to you. Because you can’t even wrap your head around it, that he loves you. You can’t even
Dean laughs bitterly at that, and confusion flits across Cas’ face. “Sam’s too far gone, man,” he says, swallowing around the lump that appears in his throat.
Dean huffs but splashes the vinegar on his fries, shaking his head. “Told ya, I don’t think I’m going to be hearing from Cas any time soon, Benny. I don’t think he’s, uh, really thinking about me these days.”
“I’m not doing anything. You entered oblivion yourself, Dean. Did it of your own absolutely free will, too, isn’t that fun? Do you really miss the angel that much, that you would unintentionally throw yourself into death to find him?” The Empty steps back again and cocks its head to the side, the gesture so reminiscent of Cas that Dean has to look away. “How strange, that your grief drives you to such extremes that he will never see or understand. No wonder Castiel doesn’t think you love him; when have you ever given him cause to think you do?”
“You look like you’re about to collapse, man!” Dean exclaims, moving towards his brother because he doesn’t know what else to do. “Is that the plan? To keep going until you can’t anymore?”
Sam tries to hide it, but Dean sees the split-second guilty grimace on his face. “I dunno, Dean,” he repeats, shrugging and shoving his hands deep into his pockets. “This shit started happening and I figured I’d call you to see if you had any tips on how to fix it or whatever. I didn’t know if you’d seen something like this before, like with a patient shorting it out with magic or something --” His eyes go wide, and he shuts his mouth quickly, but it’s too late.
As soon as he realizes, a faint noise congeals behind him, and Dean whips around, eyes wide. Cas stands there, head cocked to the side, eyes wide and blue and dry, his trenchcoat clean and slightly rumpled, and Dean nearly stumbles to his knees right then and there, but something stops him.
“What happened?” he asks, taking her elbow and carefully getting her to sit down. Her eyes are sightless gray orbs staring at nothing. Other than the sun lesions marring her skin, there are no other wounds on her face or body.
Sixteen hours later, he rolls down a narrow, lonely gravel road, pine trees hemming in close around Baby, some of their branches brushing along her top and sides. The sun is just beginning to pull above the horizon, painting the sky in a delicate mix of light blues and pinks as the stars blink out one by one. He smells the water before he sees it, salty in the early winter air of the Pacific Northwest. It’s familiar but cold. In the distance and across the cove, rounded mountains rise into the sky, their dull peaks just beginning to be touched by soft light. Rounding a bend, he stops just before the headlights flash across a nondescript white cabin with curtains pulled across every window. A large black Escalade sits parked out front, out of place among the trees.
Castiel appears to think for another moment, then shakes his head very slightly. “Just Castiel,” he says. “If I have a last name… I can’t remember. I’m not even sure where I am, honestly.”
Benny gives him a flat look. “Cas and I may not have always been simpatico, but he made you happy. Happier than I’ve seen you in a long time, honestly. The two of you… you just make sense. He’ll be back.” He snags a fry off of Dean’s plate for himself, smirking a little bit. “But you should definitely make him grovel when he returns. Maybe tell him to bake you an apology pie.”
“Whoa, you’re looking into it? I thought you and Rowena were so busy you were barely eating or sleeping.”
He watches as Dean’s pulse thrums, rapid, in his neck, the way Dean’s brow furrows even further. There are -- there are tears in his eyes, Castiel is surprised to see. A thin sheen of them, but tears nonetheless. “Yeah?” he says roughly, twisting the bottle of whiskey in his hands before setting it back down with a rough thunk. “Just in case what? You planning on running off, finding something that makes you so fucking happy you can’t help but be snatched away? That your plan?” He takes a step forward, into Castiel’s space, closing the distance between them. “You’ve decided that if you’re gonna die, you want to do it alone? What the hell, man?” Dean’s eyes are alight with a desperate anger that Castiel has seen so many times before, but there’s something layered under that gaze, something akin to the sadness that Dean tries hard to mask in front of others, but so different at the same time.
