Now, watching particles of dust pirouette in the beam of light, Dean traces the letters again. He tries to let his voice relax behind the clench of his jaw. He knows that he could easily reach down and shake Cas awake -- hand to shoulder, lifting him up just as Cas had raised him from the floor the first time they met. But Dean knows that his hands are freezing, and Cas will be warm, and he won’t be able to let go.
Gulping, Dean takes a moment to think. “I. I don’t know. I was...concerned, about him. So I asked him some questions, and I think I pushed too hard. Pissed him off.”
Dean feels something cold drift over his skin as a phantom set of keys slips through his fingers. He thinks about John, wasted and begging. He thinks about barely being tall enough to see over the wheel.
Every second that he felt terrified, it was like his voice disappeared. And it felt like every waking moment was a horror show, now.
Dean nods, but keeps staring at the little group. There are a couple of middle-aged men, one that looks pretty old, and someone with dark hair that he can’t make out because his back is turned to the doors. Bobby is already moving back to the bedrooms, starting to tell Dean about how linens work and where to get his own scrubs, but he’s not listening. Instead, he watches the game --
A wave of relief crashes down on Dean so heavy that he wants to collapse. “I’m not used to hosting,” he says, voice weak and stilted.
He stands, legs shaky for some reason. He took off the jacket when he got to his room, and he itches to put it back on -- but Jody bangs against the door again and tells him that she doesn’t have all damn day, and he rushes to open it.
Dean crooks up one side of his mouth. “Guess so. The counselors kinda know more about how to help with all the self-hatred and daddy issues.”
“How’s the withdrawal coming? I know Charlie said she’d give your meds tonight, but after checking your file I figured you might need something earlier.”
Ellen steels her expression into something neutral, sitting up straighter in the chair. “There are a lot of different ways to go through hell. Both of you tried to escape, just in different ways. What we’re trying to do now is figure out a way to make that place not feel like hell anymore.”
before returning to his former position. After reading the note, Castiel takes in a breath and lays flat on his bed with feet still grounded. Dean notices that the socks he’s wearing are riddled with holes, but another wave of pain prevents him from thinking about it further.
From her quivering lip, Dean fears that he’s about to lose her again to the crying. He snatches up the notepad and pen, scribbles out a quick note to stop the tears from falling.
Just go get me something to drink. We’ve been practicing, you won’t get pulled over, you can do it. You’re a big girl, you can drive the car down there. And it was only a five minute drive. So I put the keys in her hand, and she left.”
Dean cradles his head in his hands. He tightens his fingers in his hair until it stings, forcing himself to focus on the pain. It clears the way for a single thought, ringing loud and clear in his father’s voice:
He spits out the words as harshly as someone can with tears in their eyes, and then he rips the pen off the chain before stabbing it into the drywall. The receptionist gasps and picks up the phone, but Dean's already out the door and on his way.

Cas starts walking back to their table, and Dean quickly writes out a reply. When he takes his seat again, he cranes his neck to read the note. “Intake appointment? Condolences.”
After a few seconds, the man drops his hand. Dean does the same, and he’s about to start chasing Bobby down to wherever-the-fuck-he-went when the dark-haired guy smiles at him, soft and quick -- like it’s the easiest thing in the world -- and he
“I’m working on it. Hard to capture the image of a goddess, y’know?” His voice is weak and he can hear it in his last words. “Let’s leave the queen to her kingdom, I’ll uh -- I’ll show you the crafting stuff. Or whatever.”
Before group, Dean stops by his room to exchange scrub tops (good Lord, had he always been this sweaty?), and hanging on the doorknob is a small plastic bag containing two cookies with a sticky note slapped next to the door handle.
Charlie gives him a second, but Dean just stares at her pristine white sneakers. He makes no noise, no gesture, nothing -- he’s trying his best to blend into the chair.
Dean feels so comfortable by lunchtime that he starts to wonder if Charlie is slipping him something extra with his morning meds. Yesterday he was panicking and having a full-on meltdown, but now it’s… well.
but Dean feels heat creep up the back of his neck and he shifts his gaze elsewhere. It makes him focus on something else for the first time since he entered the room, and then it hits Dean like a train -- his head feels like it’s going to explode.
This is the first time that Dean’s been sober enough to think this long about how he feels (or about anything) in months, and he feels a wave of exhaustion hit him. He closes his eyes, wants to drift off to sleep and never wake up, but the beeping of the IV machine shakes him back into reality. Rising silently from her seat, Charlie grabs another few pieces of gauze and some tape.
Slowly, Benny works his way through each member of the ward. Some have significantly more detail than others, but every person has a reason for drinking -- Dean can’t help but notice that no one else has the reason of being an HIV-positive former prostitute, though. Once Benny finishes up, Dean looks at him expectantly.
Dean shuts his eyes for a second, squeezes them tight. It feels like he’s clenching his jaw so tightly he’ll crack a tooth.
“Great. You’re already becoming one of my favorites around here, son,” Bobby tells him with a twinkle in his eye, and it’s hard to tell through his beard but it almost seems like he half-smiles.
“It’s a great fuckin' place, I tried taking a class there one time. Wasn’t my thing, but y’know. Your credits would probably transfer, if you spin it right,” he jokes, and Castiel exhales a weak laugh. And it isn't his normal laugh, and he looks like he's on the brink of falling apart, but it's still such a pretty laugh. It distracts Dean for a second, and he feels his fingers tighten into a fist so that he doesn't reach out and touch Cas's shoulder again. He's focused so resolutely on not doing something stupid with his hands that he forgets that saying something really,
The change in tone catches Dean off guard, and it takes him a second to respond. He stands in the room silently for a second, acutely aware of the lack of Cas’s presence for the first time. “Sure, yeah. Of course I do, Sammy.”
The craft room isn’t as busy as it was the day before, but Garth still welcomes everyone with the same level of enthusiasm. “Dean! You’re back, I’m so glad. Once you’re done with detox they’ll move you to the hiking groups so you’re not stuck with me all the time,” he says, and Dean stares at him for a second. Wonders how someone with this kind of personality started working with such a gnarly population of people. He wants to tell Garth that he likes being there, but he just used up all of his words in his room -- so instead, he offers a shrug and a half smile. That alone is enough to make Garth beam, though, so Dean thinks it’s an okay effort for right now.
Dean nods without making eye contact again. The vulnerability is pulling him harshly along two opposite sides of the spectrum -- on one side, he wants to scream out everything that’s ever happened to him, fit in alongside the members of this group. Feel belonging, for the first time.
chapter tw: mention of child abuse, discussion of alcoholism, unhealthy coping mechanisms, mention of prostitution, discussions of suicide, discussion of disordered eating/food restriction
The other men all raise their hands to wave, and Dean finally musters the energy to give a weak wave back. As he looks at each of their faces, he pauses over the young man his own age. His hair is crazy, and he’s staring at Dean with an intensity that makes him feel like he’s stuck to the tiles under his feet. The other men have returned to the game already, Dean forgotten just as quickly as he was noticed.
Without thinking, he automatically follows Castiel’s instruction with his palm up. He loops the bracelet under Dean’s arm and gently ties the ends together, fingers light against the underside of Dean’s wrist. He hopes that Cas can’t feel the way his pulse is beating out of control -- the contact feels more intimate than it should, and Dean thinks about how little people have touched him without a very specific goal in mind. But this, the bracelet -- Castiel is just doing something kind for him. Helping him,
Dean gulps down his worry and decides to combine his ideas. He slips the note under the door and knocks, then freezes in place.
After he eats the last crumb from the tray, he stands up to toss it in the garbage can next to his dresser, a few feet away from the door. Moving closer, Dean notices a small piece of paper on the floor. Neatly folded, with a messy script on the front. He tosses the tray and grabs it delicately.
At that, Dean feels his shoulders relax and one side of his mouth twitches up. He shrugs at Blue Eyes, and he huffs out a laugh.
think about yourself. Because in order to recover, you gotta get to the point where you think you deserve to recover. So, we’re gonna go around the circle and everyone’s gonna say something good about themselves.”
After meeting with Ellen, Dean walks out of the Sunshine room with a strange feeling behind his ribs. It’s a new sensation -- usually after therapy he feels empty, so the sensation of anything else at all is fucking weird. He doesn’t know what to do with it, or what to label it, so he sits in his room for a while instead of going straight to the dining hall. He’s not watching the clock, but ten minutes pass; then twenty, then thirty. And once it hits thirty-seven minutes, he hears a loud knock on the door. Dean startles from his catatonia on the bed, feels dread replace the weirdness in his chest in less than a heartbeat.
After they walk through the cafeteria and exercise rooms, they come to a large set of glass double doors separating the ward from the other side of the building. On the other side of the doors, a group of people in light blue scrubs sit on the floor with a deck of cards. Dean pauses, staring at the others -- throughout the entire tour, he hasn’t seen a single person on this ward. Signs of life, sure, like jackets here and there and supplies left out in the craft rooms, but no
Dean can’t explain it, the not-being-able-to-talk thing. He can talk plenty. In fact, he’s pretty loud; but sometimes, the words just can’t come out. They pool in the back of his throat, or get caught in his lungs -- and when that happens, there’s nothing he can do to spit them out. It doesn’t matter how desperately he wants to speak.
Dean stops and smiles for a second at the memory. He mowed lawns for months, worked up the money and the nerve to get two movie tickets and enough for dinner at the little diner down the street. He doesn’t remember what movie they saw, but it was terrible. She held his hand halfway in and he couldn’t stop thinking about it for days.
He squints his eyes shut again and tucks his chin into his chest, desperately trying to make himself small. Dean cracks open his eyes for just a second to write again -- as he does, a tear drips down the sharp line of his nose and onto the paper, blurring the ink.
With his hand slightly raised, he clears his throat. “I’m Dean, by the way.” Adam nods at him once, unfazed.
Dean grins for a second before another wave of pain sends him careening back over his knees, almost strong enough that he curls up on the floor. He’s gathering the strength to walk to the door when he hears it clang open, sound amplified in his ears -- a young woman, about Charlie’s age, is standing with her hands on her hips.
“You’re almost done. Come see me when you get out, it’s just a couple of weeks,” he smiles warmly, tucks a piece of paper with a phone number into Dean’s shaky palm. His eyes are bright and soft, and Dean wonders what his life would have been like if he’d had someone like Benny to lean on instead of collapsing in on himself for so long.
“They treat heroin withdrawal with something called methadone, which is basically just heroin’s lamer little brother. It has a similar mechanism of action in your brain, at least. If you took any of mine right now you would probably be high as a kite,” he says breezily. If not for the pounding in Dean’s skull, he would have snapped his head up to stare at him. Alarm bells start flashing behind his eyes, something fearful in his chest.
Dr. Miller waits for a beat. “Do you understand what I’ve told you, Mr. Winchester?” His voice is just shy of curt.
Dean squeezes his eyes shut as tightly as he can, feels hot and heavy tears working their way up. With panic rolling around in his chest, he realizes that he can’t push them away --
Sam sighs on the other end of the line. “He’s going through stuff too, Dean. Having one of your only friends ghost you in the middle of something like this has to suck. He probably felt lonely.”
More whispering. Dean hears a brief rustling of fabric, and then footsteps echoing down the opposite side of the hall. He waits for what feels like a small eternity before he lets all the air out of his lungs.
It’s not that he’s overly modest -- he knows he looks good, couldn’t be as good at what he does without it. Sometimes the attention makes him feel nice, even; not always, but on occasion. The thing is that the people here are nice, and nice people usually say something when they see suspicious-looking scars. So Dean’s been waiting to shower, alone.
But then, stuff like this happens. And he remembers that Sam is an impatient college kid, and Dean is taking time out of his Saturday afternoon at college in sunny California.
Dean’s eyes start to water, and he doesn’t know how to hold back the tears. Because this is the first time he’s seen a slice of homemade pie since his mom died. And he doesn’t know why, but this baked good is making him want to sob.
But then, he wondered if it was someone from work and he just didn’t remember the number. And he thought about how ugly it could get, sometimes, if he didn’t give a client the attention they wanted. So he flipped open his cellphone, clicked for the voicemail, and held it to his ear.
“Cas,” Dean breathes out the name, voice soft. He moves his left hand, curling his fingers into Castiel’s palm, before the arm is suddenly yanked away.
thanks for coming on this journey with me. i hope you are all doing wonderfully, and thank you thank you thank you. :)
It was after midnight by the time he finished saying everything that he needed to say, so Cas was stuck on the opposite side of the unit anyway -- but he made a point to tell Dean that he would have stayed regardless. Then they walked quietly to Dean’s room, and Cas got on the floor without a word, bunching up his scrub top underneath his head like a pillow and telling Dean to wake him up early.
Cas stares at him for a long few moments, and Dean soaks up the light from his gaze. He’s missed this -- just getting to
Castiel turns away from him and continues digging in the bins. The rummaging noises sound thunderous in the silence surrounding them, and Dean starts to feel a little annoyed. After a moment, as Castiel’s words truly start to sink in, a familiar emotion takes root in Dean’s chest and slows down his heart.
As he walks through the door, he finds Adam sitting in the place where he usually sits -- a metal stool next to the stovetop, uncomfortable and slightly too short. Dean pushes down the bitterness in his mouth and remains close to the entryway as he plasters on a small smile for Jody. She walks up to him with a wider grin than usual and claps him on the shoulder.
Novak?” Zachariah calls out from the other side of the circle, earning another withering look from Ellen. Castiel doesn’t turn to look at him; instead, he gazes across the circle at Dean and winks, once. And even though Dean feels his cheeks turn bright red, the panic dissipates as the rope loosens around his throat.
Sam tolerates it, but it was obvious over the last few months how much he hated it. Whenever he asked Dean a question and Dean pulled out the notepad, he’d heave a big sigh and roll his eyes. For the first three weeks, every day he asked Dean what was wrong. Why he wouldn’t speak. And Dean wanted to give him an answer, he did. He tried. Tried to talk when he was alone, in the mirror, into the empty air of his car -- but it was gone.
instead of what he's done. Wonders if anyone at all is capable of seeing him like that when he can't even look past it in the mirror every morning.
He sits on the floor, and Dean gathers their supplies silently. He cuts the thread, gently ties the thread together to start the weaving, and hands the strings to Castiel. For what feels like infinity, they work in silence.
Dean’s hands curl around his body again as he walks, desperately trying to fend off the temperature of his room --
“Apologies,” he says, not even bothering to raise his head from the field of flowers he’s drawing. But to Dean, it feels like a wave of electricity cascades throughout his leg.
The panic starts to take over him, and Dean feels his throat closing up. He swallows, pushing back the feeling -- but it’s almost impossible. He can’t imagine returning to the life he lived before; scraping by for shitty food, a shitty apartment, a shitty car. Waking up cold and alone in his apartment, wondering how long it would take him to die.
Dean closes his mouth, shuts his eyes, and shakes his head. He tries to hold back the tears, and he knows they’ll start falling if he opens his eyes up again. So he keeps them shut tight, only pointing his index finger further up.
He swallows hard, but Adam is staring at him, and panic starts to settle into his bones. He can feel his heartbeat getting faster, cold sweat collecting at his brow, when pounding footsteps distract him near the entrance to the Sunshine room.
he thinks -- he was hoping to see Cas again. And to finish the bracelet, but mostly to see Cas. Even if he won’t admit that to himself.
Ellen immediately shakes her head. “You’re not going to be alone, Dean. You’ve got plenty of friends from here that you can contact, and you’ve got that genius little brother too. There are support groups you can keep going to, and you’ll meet plenty of people when you get a job.”
“Oh, I really like your shirt -- is that Lord of the Rings? I love Sam. Well, everyone loves Sam, don’t they?” Her smile is infectious, and against his better judgment, Dean’s lips turn up.
Ellen nods slowly. “You know, a lot of people who have trouble talking like this have something called anxiety. Anybody ever diagnose you with that before?”
Dean’s not brave enough to ask Cas if he’s mad at him, but he takes the lack of outward anger as a good sign. Maybe he didn’t fuck it up as fast as he thought he did.
His smile drops away when he remembers that it was the last summer he spent mowing lawns to earn money. Swallowing hard, he turns around to finally take a seat -- but instead, he finds an older man with a graying beard standing ten feet behind him with crossed arms and a warm gaze.
“You had some tough shit happen to you, same as all of us. That doesn’t mean you’re not fucking good at anything else.”
In the corner of his eye, Dean sees Castiel’s hand creep into his line of sight. He taps gently on the table twice, and Dean follows the trail. From his fingertip to his wrist, over the friendship bracelets, up a nicely-muscled shoulder, and finally landing at the bolt of his stubbled jaw. Dean can’t force himself to go any further, afraid of what his expression will be, but Cas still accepts the attempt.
Benny takes a soft breath in. “Hey there, to anyone who doesn’t know me. My name is Benny, and I’m an alcoholic.”
Mostly. It’s hard to ignore Castiel’s witchy hands next to him, seemingly flying through the motions. Dean has to lay the strings out one at a time with care to prevent them from getting tangled, but Castiel keeps them tucked between his fingers as he works. It looks more like weaving than tying knots in his hands, and every few minutes Dean can’t help getting a little distracted by his movements. Castiel’s bracelet is also more complex -- a diamondback pattern. The pattern he showed Dean is turning out to just be diagonals of color down the length of the bracelet, and he would prefer something more intricate. But he’s struggled enough with just this, so maybe Castiel was onto something.
He thinks about how he can probably make it out of the medical bay if he distracts Charlie for long enough.
He used to be scared of eating too much, getting too heavy for his job. He knew part of the appeal for clientele was the whole demure waif schtick, which he could pull off easily the first couple of years. But as he grew up and got wider in the shoulders and the hips, he feared that he’d lose some of his regulars. And yeah, he was banking off of their creepiness; but their creepiness paid the bills and got enough food in his and Sam’s stomachs. So he made the executive decision to eat just enough to get by, and Sam would have the rest.
He chokes down the last bite, trying and failing to appear that he’s a fully grown man who only needs half a sandwich for a meal. He offers Bobby a small smile, wrapping the other half back up and tucking it along the dresser for later. Bobby raises his eyebrows from his post, and Dean wonders why he’s still just standing there.
“I know it’s a little scary. But that’s why we start early, so we can get everything sorted out in advance. We’re gonna help you through it so you don’t feel alone.”
“Dean,” Cas repeats, closer than Dean realized. He opens his eyes and turns around, finds Cas standing a mere five feet away. He’s clutching the notes in one hand, the friendship bracelet in the other.
Dean thinks. He puts a hand on Charlie’s shoulder and she covers her face, flaming hair hanging down limply around her eyes. Dean gives her shoulder a squeeze and retrieves a box of tissues from the cabinet above the sink, placing them gently in her lap as she shudders.
So he watches him, warily, from the other side of the room. Dean’s already taken a seat at his preferred spot between Benny and Ash, and he just watches. He’s used to keeping an eye on people without letting on -- it’s a necessary skill, within his old profession -- but Benny must say something funny, and Dean doesn’t smile, and he realizes that something is up.
Dean nods at her and tries to avoid the way sweat is collecting along his spine. “What does that mean?”
Now, it’s a pretty Thursday in August and Dean is onto his first day in the Hope Valley Rehabilitation Center twenty minutes outside Kansas City. And he’s terrified, sure. But it’s just a three-month program, and he can call Sam on weekends, and it’s not like Sam’s gonna need him for anything now that he’s in California anyway.
He nods, once. “I don’t know everything about you, Dean. But I do know that you’re awful familiar with doin’ things you don’t wanna do because you think you have to. And I can promise you that doing this is going to hurt a hell of a lot less.”
So for now, it’s just getting through the next three months. Ninety days, then back to whiskey burning down his throat. Back to silence.
He stares down at his lap, hands curled together in tight fists. Bobby is saying something about being thankful for everyone in the circle, his office being open for the next thirty minutes if anyone wanted to talk it out more.
Immediately, Castiel turns away with a harsh laugh. It’s an ugly sound, yanked from his throat. He hunches over the bins again, turning his face away from Dean. “Functional, of course. This body has a vendetta against my best interests in every possible way.”
Dean collects himself, dusts off his scrubs, and shakes the cold of the ward out of his arms. After counting three more breaths, he walks out of the safety of his bedroom and toward the unknown of the craft room.
“Intake interviews are the scariest. But y’know, fear is the path to the dark side, fear leads to anger and hate, hate leads to suffering, all that jazz? It’s not good for anyone here, but
Four days pass, and Dean finds himself incapable of letting go of the bracelet in his pocket. He finds reasons not to give it each time he sees Cas -- Cas has a fresh mystery bandage on his wrist, and Dean doesn’t want to accidentally hurt him, so he can’t give it then. The day after that, Dean examines the bracelet and realizes that he could have made the pattern longer and the braided ends shorter, so he unties half of his work and remakes the loop of thread. The next day Cas is so fatigued that he falls asleep on Dean’s shoulder as they work, so his opportunity is gone; instead, he relishes in the weight of Castiel leaning against him and the soft tickle of dark hair against his neck.
Dean wants a fight, but the words sting. He assumed that he was going to have to be the person to start it, and Castiel’s antagonism catches him off guard. He blinks for a second before replying.
For a second, he starts moving that way -- but then the thoughts start crashing in, and his shoes screech to a halt on the beige tiles.
Castiel is sitting right next to him, legs crossed comfortably. His knee is about three inches from where Dean’s legs are splayed out in front of them, gently bowed -- Dean wants to push his knee closer, feel the constant warmth that Cas seems to put off. But he doesn’t, because wanting isn’t something he’s good at; instead, he works a little faster and focuses on the way his fingers curl around the threads.
(He had gotten five hours of sleep, which is abysmal for the average human being but stellar for Dean Winchester.)
Dean points at him directly, raises his eyebrows. Benny leans back in his chair at the gesture and shakes his head softly, smiles. “Really thought I’d distract you from asking about me by dishing it out on everyone else.” Dean returns Benny’s soft expression, and it’s his first genuine grin all day.
Dean releases the cuffs of his jacket and looks around the room, finds nothing to focus on except Ellen’s kind gaze. He opens his mouth for a second, wants to say something; except he doesn’t know what it is that he wants to say, and his mouth shuts just as quickly. He closes his eyes and rubs his thumb over the first bracelet he made with Cas.
“Now, we’re gonna do a medical screen to check for any substances that are still in your system. Depending on the lab work and your questionnaire, we’re going to have to detox -- get all of the substances out. To make that easier on you, we give you a little medication. But I can’t give you the right medication if you’re not honest with me now, and it’s going to make detox a lot more unpleasant. Like vomiting, hallucinating, can’t-stop-shaking unpleasant.” She swallows when she finishes talking, and Dean finally meets her gaze. “I don’t want you to go through that and I bet you don’t either. So, is ten correct?”
that his heart shouldn’t be pounding, but it is. And he knows that he shouldn’t have spent so much time worrying about how his wet hair looked in the bathroom mirror, and he shouldn’t have put on a fresh pair of scrubs just to come see Cas.
She draws a little blood and he barely flinches, filling up six tubes before popping a Bugs Bunny bandaid over his arm. She taps his arm again and tells him that most people don’t really need the bandaids, but she thinks it’s fun. Makes you forget about any of the nasty stuff.
Dean tries to stay patient, tries to think about how it would be if this was Sam in front of him instead of some random kid that looks a little like Sam. “Shoot.”
until the older man takes notice of him. He waves to Dean, then mumbles something to the rest of his group. All at once, they turn to face him, and the dark-haired guy looks…
to let me know, but Garth is pretty damn busy with the narcotics ward so you’re stuck with me for now.”
Eyes locked on the jacket, Dean twitches his head to the side. Bobby sighs and hands the jacket over first. Dean immediately puts it back on, then grabs the sandwich. He starts peeling back the layers of foil to reveal not just a sandwich but what appears to be a full-on panini. He looks back to Bobby and raises his eyebrows, solidly surprised. The older man smiles for a second and shrugs. “She tries to give y’all the best with the funding she gets. Dinner is where she pulls all the stops, just you wait.”
Something twangs in Dean’s chest and he swallows. He averts his eyes back to Jody and asks about the menu for tomorrow, anything to stop thinking about the broken kid in front of him. She says something about baked ziti, but Dean’s not listening; his mind is running a mile a minute, and every time he steals a glance at Adam it moves faster.
Not as good as anything Cas is wearing, but still pretty good for someone who doesn’t know anything about friendship bracelets. With a soft ache in his chest, Dean thinks about how this is the first thing he’s finished for himself in years, probably.
At the mention of John, Dean feels cold. His throat closes up, and he wants to hang up and sit under the covers in his room. Instead, he slides his fingers over the friendship bracelets on his arm and takes a deep breath in.
Dean’s a little worried about meeting his eyes again, so he focuses instead on the center of his body --
As he walks down the hallway, he thinks about the friendship bracelet tucked away in the back of the top drawer of his dresser. The intermingling shades of blue and white and black. Arriving at Castiel’s door, hand poised to knock, he falters.
He swallows, tears thick in the back of his throat. “I just, couldn’t see him. Going through some stuff.”
After a beat, Dean checks the clock. He has ten minutes left for breakfast, and he already knows Jody’s going to be pissed at him for just grabbing a slice of toast before therapy; but the dream is still reeling around in his head, and every time he remembers the snowy landscape he feels like he’s going to spew chunks. So he decides to spend four more minutes with Charlie, two minutes walking to the dining hall, three getting chewed out by Jody, and one inhaling dry toast before seeing Bobby.
“All I’m saying, Dean, is that you have a chance to start over with this. And that’s okay. You can choose what you want to do.”
Suddenly full of blinding rage, Dean rips out a page from the notepad. Writes furiously, gripping the pen so hard in his hand that it hurts; the small pain is the only thing that distracts him from the hot feeling building up behind his eyes, and he won’t cry here again. So he slams the paper down on the desk instead, relishes in the pain that shoots up his wrist.
unprofessional,” Charlie mumbles, voice coming out thick and wet. Dean remains by her side silently, letting her cry it out before trying to get her to talk anymore. After a couple of minutes, a small mound of tissues has accumulated on the desk and Charlie looks composed enough to talk.
Cas leans against the opposite wall, and when Dean steals a glance at him he sees a look on Cas's face that he can’t define. Cas puts his hand on the doorknob and takes a breath before speaking again. His voice is soft again.
Dean stares at his friend, eyes wide. Despite everything that Cas has just told him, he still can’t loosen the rope around his neck -- his body is still pumping with adrenaline, frozen in place and unable to make a sound.
The members of the circle stare at her, and Adam gives the slightest nod. After a moment, he speaks again. “I’m good at chess.”
Dean’s sweating. He’s sweating more than when he sprinted out of Crowley’s deli, stolen apples in hand. He’s sweating more than the first time his Dad held a cigarette out and told him to roll up his sleeve. More, even, than the few heavy seconds before he told Cas last night.
Adam thanks him and heads back to his room, shutting the door silently. Dean stares after him and then down at the remaining slice of pie in his hands. It could easily feed two.
He finally turns the faucet off and wraps a towel around his body, drying off the remaining droplets of water before putting on another set of scrubs. As he walks back to his room, he notices that it’s just past ten-thirty -- he feels wide awake from his prolonged nap, and the freezing air on the ward is making him even more alert.
Dean has about fifteen minutes to kill before he can go to the crafting room for part of the art therapy session, and he plans on spending those fifteen minutes alone in his room, trying to turn the inhuman noises in his throat into full fucking words. Before he can make his way out of the room, Benny stops him with a huge hand on his shoulder.
“You need, uh. Help? Tying it?” Dean has watched Castiel tie plenty of bracelets unassisted over the past two-and-a-half months.
Shoulders starting to shake, Dean paces around his room. He hits himself in the head once with the flat of his palm, gritting his teeth.
Adam shuffles his feet again, unsure of what else to say. “Thanks. For the pep talk, or whatever that was.”
Charlie talks for a little longer, and most of it is stuff about her parents -- Dean misses part of it because he’s calculating out his next ten minutes, but he makes sure to nod along anyway so she feels like she isn’t alone. When the words start making it back into the comprehension zone of his head again, he hears Charlie say this:
He looks down at the notes, papers creased into thirds and tucked together. Within the stack, the friendship bracelet is hidden inside the last two pages. Dean rebraided it two more times after he finished writing the note, intent on perfecting it. Just in case it was the last thing he ever gave Cas.
He can feel the heat from him, smells something faintly lavender. Castiel speaks softly to him, eyes briefly meeting Dean’s gaze before dropping back to the thread. “Let me show you.”
A little list had mysteriously appeared overnight in the dining room and Dean’s name was furthest down on the chart, clocking in at four in the afternoon. Kevin had then explained to him over breakfast that they were allowed family calls on the weekends, and everyone got twenty minutes. He said to Dean,
“Pleased to meet you, Dean,” he says, gazing back down at the thread in front of them. “Pick five colors.”
Despite her attempt to assuage his fears, Dean feels like a cornered animal. He hadn’t set foot in any kind of medical space since his blowout with Dr. Miller, and he was terrified that this kind woman would turn on him any second. He felt like everything about him screamed
He sprints out of the building from the first exit he can find, which is on the opposite side of where he parked his car. He jogs around the building so that the harsh winter air gets in his lungs faster, making it hurt to breathe. None of the people in scrubs or suits or lab coats ask him what’s wrong, letting the young man in tattered clothes drift away as just another element of a slightly odd morning. When Dean gets to his car, he sits inside without turning on the heat and soaks up the silence.
“You won a debate tournament? Holy shit, that’s great Sam!” Dean exclaims, his smile audible over the phone. “You’re gonna be such an awesome lawyer.”
Despite his usual insomnia, Dean sleeps dreamlessly through the night and well into the morning. He misses breakfast at eight, and by nine he hears a rapping of knuckles on his door.
With a deep sigh, he takes the seat next to Adam. The younger man stares at him with wide, confused eyes, and Castiel extends a hand.
Dean can feel how ridiculous the words are coming out of his mouth, but he powers through them anyway as he crosses the threshold into Castiel’s room. He takes up his usual spot on the floor next to the head of the bed and tries to ignore the small gift burning a deep hole into his pocket.
I forgive you. And don’t fucking apologize for not telling me. People don’t have to, y’know. Talk about that stuff, if they don’t wanna,” he says, and he feels heat flare in his cheeks. The proximity, the conversation, the truth hovering under his tongue --
Except wanting is a brand new emotion for Dean; and like all of his other feelings, his first instinct is to push it away and ignore it. So he does.
Dean doesn’t know what to say. The shadows under Cas’s eyes are darker than they’ve ever been, and his hair seems unwashed. There are at least three more bracelets on each of his arms, but they do little to hide the white bandages underneath.
Cas doesn’t even hold him there; he just pushes Dean away before stepping back, leaving a solid six feet between them. His shoulders are shaking, and Dean can see the tense outline of the muscles in his torso.
“Here,” he turns around to a bucket full of different threads on his dresser, digging through and pulling out a variety of packs and handing them to Dean to hold. He glances back over his shoulder for a second and looks Dean in the eyes again. “I’m Castiel, by the way. Most people prefer Novak, though.”
Benny blesses him by taking the hint and backing off, putting up a hand in a small wave before joining Kevin and Ash at the edge of the room again. A sigh gushes out of Dean’s lungs as he turns to leave, about to make a run for the haven of room 107MA, when he hears his name.
Clutching the pages tightly in his fingers, he feels a drop of sweat drip down the length of his spine. As he silently passes through the glass doors into the narcotics ward, he feels his pulse bounding in his chest, in his wrists, behind his knees. Anxiety grips him tight, but he fights it every step of the way -- he has something to say. And he needs Cas to know,
and Dean wants to apologize. He wants to say that he’s so sorry for wrecking it before anything even started, how he’ll never bother Cas again. Except Cas silently rises from the floor before he can write anything down, and panic is starting to flood Dean’s chest.
Adam looks up for a second, barely meeting Dean’s gaze before retreating to his shoes again. This is a far cry from the combative patient Dean saw in the circle before -- his breath catches in his throat as he watches Adam’s face crumple for a second before steeling again. This time, Dean doesn’t see Sam; instead, he witnesses a breathing mirror reflecting back his own eighteen-year-old self. He looks painfully young.
Leaning up against the door, Dean fully exhales to make the trembling feeling go away. Breathes in sharply again, tries to get familiar with sounds coming from his mouth. He swallows and clears his throat. Parts his lips, just a little.
Already at the door and heading out, Cas looks over his shoulder. “Yeah, tonight. My sister mailed me some more thread, and I want to teach you a new pattern. If you want.”
“I’m a… fellow patient,” Castiel finishes, looking to Dean for help. On the other end of the line, Sam sighs.
“Better finish it. Best pie this side of the Mississippi,” he says, even going so far as to offer a little smile.
at living a normal life. You already know that. I’m not good at anything else other than being here and being doped up or being out there and being doped up. I don’t have anywhere to go, or anything to do, or anyone to see. There's
He’s been so worried about getting the words out that he barely thought about what the words would be.
“Here we go. What were you looking for?” Dean asks, still not looking at Adam. Over his shoulder, quiet in the dark hallway, Adam breathes out a little fast.
he thinks. And the list of liars that Dean knows includes Sam Winchester, who once tried to convince him that his first hickey was the result of a freak frisbee accident in the middle of his tenth-grade PE class.
“I’m sorry,” Castiel mumbles into Dean’s shoulder, and Dean hugs him tighter. “I’m sorry for not telling you. And I didn’t realize that pushing you would do that. I thought -- I don’t know. I’m sorry. I thought you would never want to be near me again.”
Dean looks up to see a man in his thirties, a thick brown beard obscuring most of his face. Louisiana drips off his words like honey, and Dean wonders what someone with a voice like that is doing in a place this far north of the Mason-Dixon line.
She stares at the note for a second, then plasters on the worst fake smile that Dean has ever seen in his entire life.
He hears Benny call out to him from down the hall, but he doesn’t turn around; instead, he walks quickly to his bedroom and shuts the door.
The younger man turns his eyes to his shoes, scuffs one foot against the beige tiles. “Fuck you. I don’t get you. Something like that, I guess.”
He curls in over his knees and lets out a heavy breath. As Dean sits back up, he rubs his neck with his hand.
She faces her palms up in her lap, placating. Dean can feel the way his lips are a harsh line, familiar grooves etched into the space under his eyes and around his mouth. It’s a familiar expression, one that he wore frequently around his father and sometimes around his teachers -- but never around clients. The thing is that Ellen doesn’t fall into any of those categories, and he doesn’t know what face to put on.
“Name’s Benny. We’ve been callin’ you Cinderella on the ward since we didn’t have a chance to get your name before you ran,” he says with a soft chuckle. Benny leans back into his heels and tucks his hands in his pockets, the definition of casual. Dean swallows again and tries to ignore the anger that ticks up behind his eyes. He had more than a few bad memories of getting called
He retreats from the dining hall and sits against the door of his bedroom, gasping heavy breaths into his lungs. A hallway clock told him that he had five minutes to collect himself before going to the craft room, and he relishes the time in his little room.
The sentence puzzles Dean out of his misery for a second, and he looks up at Castiel in confusion. Reaching for the notepad, he scribbles out
After five more minutes, he’s called to the back and sits in a chair on the opposite side of a desk instead of on crinkly paper covering a medical bed. He waits for five more minutes, taking that time to examine the dim room.
Cas doesn’t turn to face him. Instead, he keeps rummaging in each bin with an urgency that Dean has never seen him possess. Even when Castiel ran from his room last morning, it was more of a gentle jog -- he moved through the world easily, never fighting the glide of time. But now, watching him toss supplies haphazardly over the bed and digging down to his elbows for some mystery item, he seems to be scrambling for something.
over her shoulder as they go. Blue Eyes stands up to shut the door, letting out a soft breath as it clicks shut. “You should be fine now. I will warn you that all the junkies are coming back from their peaceful nature walk at three, though.”
TW: detailed description of substance abuse, suggestion of suicidal behavior, mention of self harm, a frustrating amount of miscommunication
As Dean opens the door, he’s confronted with a thin blonde boy with his fist raised, about to knock. Adam blinks in surprise as the door opens, and Dean can’t help but notice the way the bags under his eyes are softer and his face looks a little less gaunt.
Dean hears the last door shut on the hall at 9:48pm, and he makes his way to the narcotics ward at 9:50. He’s freshly showered, droplets of water still clinging to his eyelashes, but he doesn’t wait to go see Cas -- he has questions, and he wants answers.
Dean drags his gaze to Adam again, unwillingly. “Jody’s a gem. But don’t let anybody else know it or we ain’t gonna be able to get so much of this after hours,” he raises up his plate. For emphasis, he throws in an exaggerated wink.
Dean floats through the rest of the day in a haze. His appointment with Bobby brought up a lot of things he hadn’t thought about in a long time -- and while he was able to push it down in the immediate aftermath, as the hours drag on he has a harder time forgetting. Memories from when he was fifteen, sixteen; just starting out, incapable of setting boundaries with clients. The way he shifted from feeling fear to feeling resigned in less than a year of working. The cold.
After the knot is finished, Castiel goes back to finishing his crane and Dean admires the way the reds and yellows look together. He finished something -- actually finished something, from beginning to end, and it looks…
Dean barks out a harsh laugh, the light streaming in from the window suddenly becoming unbearable on all fronts. He shakes his head, desperately wishes he could be anywhere else. The headache and the question bring Dean crashing back into the reality of where he is, what’s currently going on, and what got him there in the first place.
The first thing that Dean notices is that he’s shirtless. The second thing Dean notices is that he looks furious.
More than anything, he knows that he shouldn’t have spent all of dinner and free time working on the little bracelet that’s now safely tucked in his pocket.
“Give him a second, he’s writing down quite a bit,” Castiel says, and Sam huffs into the phone. Dean finally presents the paper, and Castiel reads it out.
“Winchester,” Ellen speaks from behind his left shoulder, and he lets out a guttural scream in his mind.
The clock gives him thirty more seconds, and Dean would give anything to turn back time twenty minutes. Or twenty months, or twenty years. But right now, he would settle for twenty more minutes talking to his kind, smartass little brother.
She sits him back in a little chair in the corner with a table flipped under his left arm, palm to the sky. She’s chatty, even though Dean is only offering a little smile or chuckle every now and then. Charlie is wearing navy scrubs that bring out her eyes and contrast her fiery hair, and once again, against his better judgment, Dean starts to like her.
“Sorry if your arm hurts a little. Your blood pressure was so low that I had to stick you a couple of times,” Charlie chirps from the other side of the room. Dean lets out a breath, closing his eyes again and deciding to let the water in his head weigh him down.
It’s good. It’s not his mom’s, but it’s really good. And for the first time since he got to Hope Valley -- really, the first time in years -- Dean finishes an entire meal.
Castiel pauses, considers Dean's note. “We should probably work on our execution, but I feel like it was an admirable first attempt,” he says, and it’s so absurd to compliment that disaster of a conversation that Dean laughs a little. It’s empty, but it’s a laugh.
At that, Ellen laughs. “Not like this. I’m just a counselor, so I can’t say anything for sure. But you’ve been through a hell of a lot Dean, and it makes sense to me that you’d feel like this. There are ways that we can make it easier, especially once you get back into the outside world.”
chapter specific tw: severe alcoholism, implication of prostitution, hiv, generalized severe self hatred
Dean looks down at his hands in his lap, the dirt under his thumbnail and the holes in his jeans. His shoulders start to shake a little bit while he thinks about where his hands have been, the dirty bathrooms his knees have touched, everything he had to do that got him here and Sam in fucking California.
Cas clambers through the door, chest heaving. Dean stares at him, and Cas locks eyes with Dean after looking around the room. Briefly, he smiles.
“Sammy, I’m fine. I’m the therapy MVP, don’t worry about it,” Cas says, and the words sound wickedly inorganic coming from his mouth.
But this silhouette is standing tall and strong, despite its short stature. It’s dim in the hallway, but Dean can see that the scrubs are a different color from the blues and greens that he’s used to -- in fact, they almost look black contrasted against the beige tiles and walls.
(Well, not really. He knows about Ash’s terrible relationship with his mother and the crippling pain that Lee felt when his wife cheated on him. But he couldn’t tell you their favorite colors.)
He shakes his head aggressively, tugs the jacket close to his chest. Reaching for the notepad on the ground again, Dean writes out another message.
Cas shakes his head again, but Dean can see the hint of a smile on his face. Cas stops pretending to look for thread, and instead grips the edges of the dresser until his knuckles whiten. He tilts his chin forward and takes a deep breath, the outline of his shoulders and spine straining against the fabric of his shirt. The rigid posture makes worry flicker in Dean’s chest. In the back of his mind, he's trying to channel the same energy that he gave Sam when he got dumped on prom night last year -- that was a tough one, but Dean brought his little brother back from the pits of despair with some jokes and his first beer. Dean has a feeling it might take a little more with Cas, though.
Now, darkness falls and he itches to walk across the threshold to the narcotics ward. Instead, he pushes down the loneliness tugging at his ribs and finds himself heading to the kitchen.
Dean swallows hard and rubs a hand down his face, pausing at his eyes to wipe away some of the wetness. He scribbles something out, and it’s barely legible -- but after twenty seconds of analysis, Castiel understands.
Dean pauses, closes his eyes for a second to block out the beige of the room surrounding them. Instead, he thinks of blue.
Dean sighs. “Well, I didn’t talk to him a whole lot last week, and then I barged in last night and asked him what the fuck was going on.”
Nervous about being caught, he ducks into a small alcove embedded into the wall and tries to slow the rapid beating of his heart. He feels his throat get tight, a familiar feeling, and he takes comfort in the silence of his hideaway for a moment. But as he closes his eyes to calm down, Dean realizes that he can just barely make out the voice of the silhouette in the darkness.
He scrubs his hands over his eyes again, really starting to feel the effects of having just one drink a few hours ago. He wants to slam his hand into the frame and splinter the glass into little shards, let his blood smear over the rainbow. He peers closer, seeing that not only is it a little rainbow, but the clouds at the ends of the rainbow have little smiley faces. Dean curls his fists up and sucks in a fast breath through his teeth.
because that’s the thing that will make him hurt the most. And he’s used to hurting -- Dean can hurt, and he can get through it. It’s familiar.
in shining letters. That pill from Charlie had to have some kind of truth serum in it, because Dean Winchester was not the transparent type -- but in those three hours, he told Bobby about 20% of what had happened to him. And that was more than anyone else had ever known.
It's not just the quiet -- Charlie has her back turned to him, keying information into the computer. Dean swallows his pill and tosses the little cups into the trash can next to the door. He stares at the line of her back, the way she sits up totally straight with stiff shoulders. Dean frowns.
He just wants to get through this so he can go home and get back to the whiskey. Whiskey didn’t look at him with pity or take his jacket away, and whiskey certainly isn’t about to go make him have a therapy session.
to see it. Adam, who knows what he is. The kid who’s combative and bitchy and always talking too much in group. Dean can barely
Dean stares at him blankly before responding. He grips the hem of his scrubs tight in his fist and tries to ignore the way his pulse is pounding. “Might be. Don’t have to talk about it, though.”
“Great. How many standard drinks would you say you have per day? You’ve written down ten, is that correct?”
He doesn’t hear the last part of her sentence because he turns back and runs down another hall, breathing harsh. Dean’s spent a lot of his life running from things, both literally and metaphorically: cops, memories, himself -- but he’s pretty sure he’s never run as fast before as he does now. In some small space in the back of his brain, he thanks the scrubs for being so aerodynamic. Then he hears Charlie shout, closer, and he keeps running.
“Winchester,” Bobby huffs, and Dean is startled back into the task at hand. Bobby’s head is sticking out of the doorway, and Dean follows him.
But Cas had just looked so sad earlier. And this is the one thing that Dean can do, so he does it for Cas.
Meals with Benny and Kevin (and Ash, if he was feeling argumentative). Watching Rufus and Lee play cards in the corner, listening to Bobby tell old war stories on hikes each afternoon. The smile that Jody gave to him each time he went back for seconds. Charlie sneaking into the craft room to draw more bewildering depictions of her beloved dogs. Cas.
“Figuring out where you’re gonna go, what you’re gonna do, who you’re gonna see. Everything. We plan it out nice and detailed so it’s harder to get off the rails once you’re on your own.”
Dean is ripped out of his train of thought, and he realizes that not only is he breathing fast and shallow (and loud), he’s tied the last knot on his bracelet so tightly that the pattern has gotten all fucked up.
Dean pats her shoulder and turns to walk out of the room before he can start to think about his own feelings.
He is, and he does. When he gets back to his room, he rips out three sheets of paper from an old notepad and starts writing.
He takes the pain between his ribs and holds it close, feeds on it. Soaks in the familiarity of the stinging from Cas’s words. He’s broken it, this thing between them, and he wants to smash it to pieces -- Dean knows he’s acting like he’s seventeen, but he does it anyway. Because it’s all he knows how to do.
Cas,” Dean spits out, yanking Castiel’s arm forward. He pushes some of the bracelets up, closer to his elbow, and Dean’s words freeze in his mouth.
, he thinks. He curls his left hand into a fist until he feels his fingernails digging hard into the palm of his hand.
Dean’s hands still, and he focuses his eyes on the shadows underneath the door. He shrugs, and continues to knot.
“God, that place is really making you a horrible liar,” Sam sighs. Dean rolls his eyes at the sound, thinks about saying
Ellen takes a deep breath, and Dean seizes his only chance. He knows she'll probably be pissed at him for interrupting, but maybe she won't get
“Not like Novak hasn’t heard it all before,” he interrupts, and the two men next to him chuckle. Dean clenches his jaw and tucks his hands into tight fists.
He walked through the double doors silently and willed away the sting of hot tears in his eyes. The bracelet was shoved into the back of his dresser, alongside Cas’s two notes from his first week at Hope Valley. Dean has no intention of touching it until he leaves in four weeks, at which points he plans to throw it away.
The tears reappear, and Dean curses himself for it. Because it truly doesn’t matter if he’s not alone right now -- he
“Alright! We’ve got everyone here for art therapy today. The point of this is to get those emotions out into the physical world, so put whatever you want into these pieces, ladies and gents. We’ve got watercolors, some oil pastels, and origami today. If you already have a project to work on, keep it up. Get your soul on the paper!”
want to talk -- in a way. He wants to want it the same way he wants to want friends or kindness or a warm hand intertwined with his own. But there’s a wall about twenty miles high around his mind and one twice as tall around his heart, so the wanting will have to wait a little longer.
Sometimes Dean feels like he’s scrambling from behind, desperately trying to get out -- but once he gets to the top, he sees that the path down is full of thorns and fire and dragons and other fucking terrible shit. So he climbs back behind the wall and exists quietly, alone. Free of desire, free of pain.
sign on the door. Here,” he pauses, uncrossing his arms to reveal something wrapped in aluminum foil in his right hand. He extends the item to Dean, pushing it against his shoulder when he doesn’t grab it immediately. “Turkey sandwich. They were running low, and I love Chef Jody just as much as the rest of us but the ham just isn’t up to par yet.”
“Dean. You’re not the best communicator in the world. This is probably something we can fix, just tell me what happened.”
Ellen stares at him for a long time. Finally, she blinks and sits back in her seat. She stares at a point on the floor about three feet in front of her chair.
“Mr. Winchester, nice to see you. I’m Dr. Miller,” the man says, and Dean reaches out to shake his hand but is waved away. Instead, he takes a seat across from Dean and pulls a small stack of papers out of his desk.
He must stare at the pie for a little too long though because Jody squeezes his shoulder again. “Better to kill your heart than your liver right now, Winchester,” she says, laughing a little. “Take a seat. Someone skinnier than you finally showed up to this joint.”
He tosses the notepad right onto Castiel’s chest, a little harder than he should just because the guy was acting like a smartass. Dean smiles a little when the motion shocks Castiel out of his casual posture, and he sits up to read the message. “That’s correct.”
The cafeteria is a large, informal space with a few tables of varying size scattered around the area. The serving bar is in the back of the room, and it seems like Jody is an ever-present force within the facility. At dinner last night, Dean just snagged a breadstick and went to bed -- the nausea had persisted despite the medication, and Jody had been solidly offended when he had shaken his head at a plate of lasagna. She told him that you couldn’t get a healthy mind without a healthy body, and Dean had just shrugged and walked away; he’d survived on a fast food-heavy diet for the last fifteen or so years, and he could still run pretty fast. His thoughts moved pretty fast, too -- and really, what more could he ask for?
He takes in one deep breath, looks behind at the hallway, and watches Charlie curl around the corner. She shouts his name, and he takes off again. Makes a left turn, sees that the NA ward has the exact same layout but mirrored. He slows down a little but keeps walking to the hallway with the bedrooms, wonders what his best move could be -- maybe he just escapes. Takes his chances at the other medical bay. Maybe hightail it out of there and hope that Sam’s already on his plane to California. He knows that Sam sure as hell doesn’t have the cash to get a plane ticket back, so he just needs to make sure he’s actually
-- and soaks up the last few minutes, just the two of them. Cas told him last night to wake him up early; he’d have to sneak back to the narcotics ward after 6:00AM to avoid the alarm on the door but before people started getting up for breakfast at seven. It’s a slim window, and judging from the sunlight it’s definitely after six.
“Hard to start out when everyone else has been here awhile. You’ll warm up,” Ellen gives him a short smile, sticks her hands in the pockets of dark blue jeans, and starts to walk away. “Don’t expect to stay on the bench the whole time though. This is major league, and you’re on deck tomorrow.”
“Hey, Cas,” Dean says, the words coming out not nearly as casually as he wants them to. His voice is soft, and careful, and decidedly sappy.
After getting back to his room, he curls up with the blankets again before the note on his dresser catches his eyes again. Dean retrieves the note, unfolds it; he stares for a long time at the little black bird before noticing that Castiel crosses his t’s in a weird way.
“Everyone has value. I don’t know what you did, Adam. But you’re still worth something. Everyone here is.”
he thinks, and his hands still. Dean has a series of three unpleasant thoughts that connect in a way he hadn't realized before. Tears, unbidden, well up in his eyes.
how many IV users come in here and all of a sudden act like they’ve never seen a needle in their life. Kudos to you for not treating me like I’m the devil for sticking you.” Dean can’t help but laugh a little, and he’s happy to be with someone who doesn’t mind him not talking much.
chapter tw: mention of prostitution, mention of drug abuse, discussion of friendship bracelet making in depth
and it was becoming more outwardly apparent every day. And it wasn’t just the fact that he felt more broken than he’d ever been, but he was gonna have to talk to this nurse. Honestly.
He clears his voice. “Hello, um. This is Castiel Novak, I’m at Hope Valley with Dean. He’s still having a bit of trouble vocalizing his thoughts, so I’ll be talking for him. He’s right here, and he can hear everything you say. I’ll just tell you what he says.”
They snag a spare notebook from the craft room and a couple of backup pens because Dean is feeling a little paranoid about this. Sure, it’s better than being totally silent for twenty minutes after saying
It’s a Thursday in March when Dean Winchester starts to feel a little sick, so he goes to the cheap clinic with a sliding-scale payment system on 17th Street to check in with a doctor a week later. And he doesn’t remember her name, exactly, but he knows it started with an L and ended with a Y and even though he felt a little embarrassed about some of his symptoms, she seemed nice. And he thought he’d never see her again. So he was honest, and it was the first time he was honest with someone about how he felt, and also about his job.
As 10PM rolls around, Dean still feels wired from his conversation with Ellen. Cas wasn’t in the craft room earlier, and it’s been a few days since Dean has seen him. One time they were even scheduled to hike at the same time, but Cas didn’t keep step with him -- instead he trailed behind, pausing to pocket rocks and stare at the clouds. Dean hadn’t commented on the bandages on his wrists, and Cas hadn’t offered anything.
Dean notices. After a second of staring, he lets his eyes fall back on the other man standing across from him.
The door opens, and he tries to call out for his mother as hulking arms reach for him -- but his throat is closing up, and he can’t speak.
Dean stares at Jody for a second before grabbing the tray. She looks him over for one second longer, exhales. “Your color looks better. I’ve got extra if you want more later.” Then she turns on her heel and heads back to the dining hall.
At that, Dean’s eyes snap up. It feels like all the blood in his body drains away, leaving behind a harsh chill under his skin.
At that note, Bobby laughs. “Expert’s a generous term. All I’ve got is one semester of community college and a hell of a lot of nasty experiences under my belt. If you want to talk to someone with a degree, Garth is your man.”
He doesn’t know what it is exactly about Castiel that feels so different, but Dean just wants to see more of him.
Dean doesn’t like to think of himself as a romantic. But in the gentle dawn on the floor of his bedroom, peacefully asleep, Cas looks almost angelic.
and they keep going around the circle. When it’s Adam’s turn to speak up, he sits in silence for five seconds before speaking up.
“If you start making stuff you like or family brings you stuff to hang up in the room, feel free. We have to vet everything that comes in though, so keep that in mind,” Bobby speaks gruffly as Dean looks around the room, inspecting the one window too-high up on the wall to reach without either two extra feet of height or a superhuman ability to jump. “You can change into some scrubs now, and I’ll wait out here. I’ve gotta bag up your stuff and take ‘em to the front. After that, you’re all done. You’ll have some time to sit and get used to things before lunch, and then I’ll do an intake therapy session after that. Sounds good?”
Castiel hums in response. “Mine as well. I’m sorry to hear that your day was also not particularly marvelous.”
He doesn’t meet Dean’s gaze, instead working faster on his own bracelet. He’s much closer to finishing than Dean, and by the time Dean has thought of something to say in response Castiel is tying off the threads a little more tightly than he needs to. His shoulders are stiff, expression unreadable.
“You have HIV, Mr. Winchester. Human immunodeficiency virus. It attacks your body’s immune system so that fighting off infections and other illnesses is much harder, and is also the cause of AIDS if we don’t treat it with medication.”
he isn’t keeping step like Sam would. If Dean thinks for one more second about his little brother being someplace like this he’s pretty sure he’ll implode on the spot.
He stares at her before accepting the dish, looking down at a plate covered with more green than he’s seen in years. She hands him some cutlery, breaking him out of his little salad-induced trance, and manages to not make a snarky comment for the first time since she and Dean have interacted.
He swallows, torn out of his vacant mind and back into the present. Cas has such a nice voice -- deep, but not always rough. Sometimes it’s soft, like just now, or when he helped Dean get to the medical bay. And on top of having such a nice voice, Cas speaks with an ease that Dean has never possessed; it seems like he plans out every word, quick as a whip.
Dean hears Cas’s jaw click as he shuts his mouth, and the sharpness of the sound makes Dean freeze in place.
be a good distraction from the lingering ache in his chest. After the thought crosses his mind, he trails down another path of thinking.
So Dean smiles as he starts walking behind the serving station, following the familiar clattering of pans and pots to find the woman who seemed like the closest thing to a mother he would ever have again. Except as he gets closer, hand hovering right above the handle to the kitchen door, Dean hears a voice. A voice that decidedly does not belong to Chef Jody.
He knocks and shoves the memory of the bracelet back in his head. After eight long seconds, the door opens to reveal a disheveled-looking Castiel.
Ellen's voice isn't soft, or delicate. She speaks to him normally and ignores the tears on his face. Dean wonders, for a second, if she sees
fucking hurts. It has been for awhile, but this whole friendship-bracelet-thing was working wonders as a distraction tactic. Maybe he could drop the whiskey after all if he just picked up this instead.
Bobby walks forward and extends a hand, meeting Dean’s eyes. Dean swallows deep, tries to stop his body from shaking any more than the low-grade tremor he’s felt for ten minutes now. He extends his hand, giving the jacket over before gathering his other items from the bed and tucking them into Bobby’s arms. Before he turns to close the door and change into scrubs, Bobby stops the door with one plaid-covered shoulder.
“Your name? Can’t keep calling you Green Eyes in my head,” he says, adding a wink at the end of his sentence.
Adam swallows and nods again. He shrugs one shoulder and cracks a weak smile. “Guess I’ll save all that stuff for therapy, right?”
Dean stands and Charlie gestures to the door opposite of where he entered, taking the little vials of blood from earlier and labeling them with strips next to the computer. “You can wait in the room out there, Bobby will probably come get you in a few minutes. Welcome to Hope Valley, Dean.”
“This isn’t a weakness, Dean. You get nervous, you clam up. It happens to everybody, but it’s harder for some people. You’re on high alert all the damn time. Hard to talk with alarm bells going off in your head constantly.”
He opens his eyes and grabs the small styrofoam cup. His head feels a little less heavy, and he can sit up just enough to get a full gulp down. After he finishes sipping down half the liquid in the cup, Charlie takes it back from him and places it on a little table next to the bed. In his periphery, Dean sees her shoulders sag a little bit. “Can we talk for a second? Seriously?”
and around hour two Sam conked out on the couch and Dean figured it would be a better time to check his messages. He didn’t recognize the number, so he almost deleted it. The clinic visit was in the back of his mind -- his fever had gone down, the pain in his groin had stopped, and overall he felt better.
mean. How the mean ones get into the profession is something that will forever be a mystery to this world, and what’s an even bigger mystery is how the mean ones can usually hide how mean they are for a little while with a sweet smile and a pat on the arm. And Dean has seen bad nurses, knows how horrible they were to his Mom in the hospital all those years ago. So, even though he’s a solid foot taller and at least eighty pounds heavier than the tiny red-haired woman in front of him, he’s scared.
“See you, bud,” Dean says, and he tries to put on a smile. The reality is that losing Benny is the most painful person to go so far -- it hurts the same way that sending Sam to college hurt, and Dean doesn’t know where to put his hands. They hang awkwardly at his sides, fingers twitching and throat tight; like his first month in rehab, Benny speaks for him.
After he gets through with his meal, only fifteen minutes have passed for their lunch hour. His nervousness returns -- what is he supposed to do? Go back to his room? Everyone else appeared to be sitting in quiet conversation or reading books, one man lazily scribbling in a journal. Every few minutes, he catches someone in the room glancing his way -- mostly just the younger men, but it still makes Dean itch. He doesn’t like being looked at, especially not right now. Just twenty minutes ago he was rubbing his heart all over his fucking sleeves, an absolute open book; it feels like every word he wrote down is projected over his head.
Dean doesn’t respond, instead casting a look at the door and drawing his lips together tightly. Charlie looks at him for a second longer before deflating and getting back on the stool, keyboard clicking away. She doesn’t speak again, and for a second Dean starts to feel bad. Nothing but kindness has come from Charlie, even though she’s stuck Dean with needles at least five times within a twelve-hour timespan now.
He’s only known Castiel for a couple of days, but he can already tell that he isn’t a last-name-as-a-chosen-name kind of guy.
“You’ve done a swell job of being here over the past few weeks, Dean,” Cas’s words are cool, measured. “Perhaps you should get back to the other ward. It’s a little crowded on this side at the moment.”
“Lunchtime. You’ve got fifteen minutes left to eat, then we’ve gotta get you to your intake appointment in my office. It’s next to the Sunshine room, big ol’
When he walks to the medical bay before breakfast, Charlie’s normal cheeriness is significantly dimmed. She gives Dean a quick smile before offering him his little magic pill and a cup of water, morning chatter totally absent. He usually lingers in the bay for a little while and lets her talk since he’s the last person to get meds, and most of the time Charlie seems kind of lonely. She’s stuck in the medical bay pretty much all day, and Dean has barely seen her take any time off. In fact, he’s pretty confused by her entire schedule -- it feels like she spends an inordinate amount of time in the facility, but he hadn’t thought about it too much until this moment. He can’t think of anything else in the silence.
Their creative hour passes smoothly, just quiet noises of pencil on paper and the occasional compliment drifting throughout the room. Dean ties off his bracelet and braids the ends together, tapping the table to get Castiel’s attention. He looks up from a half-finished purple crane and grabs the bracelet, admires the poor but earnest handiwork. He nods at Dean with a half smile.
For the first time, Dean has friends. Sure, all but one are gone now -- but for the first time in his life, he has friends. Friends that Sam asks about each week, friends that gave him gifts when they walked back out the huge front doors to the real world, friends that listened to him. Not only listened, but waited to listen. Dean swallows again as Benny tosses the other strap of the backpack over his shoulder and zips up his jacket.
tight enough takes enough concentration that he stops thinking about anything else except for the little project in his hands.
“What makes you want to have a drink in the morning?” Bobby asks, and Dean thinks. Clenches his fists hard into the hem of his scrubs, feels his heartbeat start to pick up. He takes a deep breath in and shuts his eyes.
Dean glances up. It’s the first time anyone has ever been able to articulate how he feels that closely, and he stares at Ellen for a second.
She looks at Adam. “I saw the wreck right down the road. Driver’s side, guy ran a stop sign. Killed her on impact.” She looks down again.
Dean starts to lean against the door and takes a bite despite his nausea, pleasantly surprised at the taste. In fact, it’s so good that he takes four whole bites before he feels like he’s going to lose it all with one wrong move.
Ellen calls the group to sit in the circle of chairs a few minutes later, and everyone takes their usual spots -- a mix of green and blue scrubs. Two chairs remain open, and Adam selects the one closest to the door after lingering in the hallway for a minute. Ellen withdraws a slip of paper from her denim jacket and makes an unhappy noise.
The shampoo and soap they provided him are decidedly bland, but they work well enough to rid the dirt from his body. The water turns his skin red, pounds against the tension in his neck and shoulders; Dean lets his head hang forward heavily and relishes in the pure warmth of the shower stall. Long after he’s cleaned up, he lets the water pour over his body.
“Kinda. But the first two fly by and the third is practically a blink. We like to get started early with our discharge planning so you feel comfortable with what’s gonna happen when you get out of this place.”
Dean follows him through the door and takes a seat on the same spot next to the bed as before, watches Castiel haphazardly toss his toiletry bag on the dresser before gathering the same supplies as before. They cut the thread shorter this time, and instead of tons of different colors Cas tells him to just pick three. Dean chooses three shades of blue, mourning the way he can’t see Castiel’s eyes clearly in the poor lighting of his room. There’s a street lamp outside of Cas’s window, just enough for them to work by -- but it cuts Castiel’s features sharply, making him look more like an inked-in comic hero than a real person.
Dean opens his mouth for a second, unsure of how to respond to the gesture. His eyebrows draw together, and he puts a hand over his face again.
When Cas speaks again, Dean meets his eyes. “Did you mean this? Everything in this?” He holds up the papers, gently waving them in the air. The final page has been placed at the front, the bird and bee waving at Dean from the bottom right corner of the paper. Dean swallows and nods, finding himself incapable of speaking. It doesn’t hurt, though -- there’s no rope around his throat. He just has nothing to say that isn’t already in the palm of Castiel’s hand.
After twenty minutes, Dean sprints out of the room. Well, he tries -- except his hands are so sweaty that he can’t grip the handle very well, and he crashes into the door but it won’t open, and instead of trying to turn the handle again he panics and thinks
His hand tightens, a tear rolls down his cheek. Jaw clicking as he closes his mouth. With a heavy breath, he shakes his head.
Adam looks at him with huge eyes, then nods. “Your name is Dean, right?” He picks up his fork and starts to poke at golden pastry on the plate again.
“I heard you don’t like to talk much, so I’ll do most of it for now,” he says, sighing as he crosses his arms and leans over the table. “Group sessions are tough the first go around when you don’t know anybody, so I figured I’d give you a heads up.”
The door clicks shut quietly, and Dean hobbles down the hallway as quickly as he can without tripping over his own feet. The tiles look like they’re moving of their own volition, which makes walking solidly difficult. In the haze of pain, Dean thinks that this feels a whole lot like being blackout drunk without
Dean walks back to the door connecting to the ward, pauses when his fingers wrap around the handle. He feels hot tears well up in his eyes at the small kindness, throat closing up around the words he so desperately wants to get out.
“Just to be cautious. Don’t worry about the extra cost, Mr. Winchester. I’ll let you know the results in about ten days.”
Despite removing his scrub top last evening before sleep, he kept the bracelets on -- an ocean of color adorning his wrists. Dean swallows as he looks -- no,
(He had been skipped over in the haze after Adam’s outburst, and Dean thought he seemed deflated at being left out of the discussion. Watching the curve of Castiel’s mouth drift down had made something ache in Dean’s chest. So he wanted the ache to go away. But more importantly, he never wanted to see Cas look like that again.)
Castiel doesn’t respond, waiting on Dean. After looking at the notepad again, he speaks: “I wouldn’t have to rewrite everything every second if you would give me a goddamn minute to say what I need to say.”
Dean’s eyes snap back open. He stares at Cas and waves a hand when he doesn’t speak, points at the receiver. Cas makes an incredulous face at him, mimes writing at him -- Dean rolls his eyes and writes out
Dean’s stomach twists, and another knife jabs into the back of his skull. He wants to stay, ask Castiel why. Make more bracelets, maybe draw a bee. Anything other than going back to his own ward, with Bobby and Charlie and a dozen others staring at him like an animal in a cage. He swallows hard, stares even harder at one of the holes in Castiel’s left sock. A warm hand rests on his shoulder again, heavy.
Dean waits until he hears the last door on the ward click shut before he heads out, notes in hand. He thought three little notebook pages would be enough, but he was wrong -- as soon as he started, he found it hard to stop. Words started pouring out, littering the pages with
Dean’s eyes had shot back open -- and even though he had just spent two hours talking, he found his throat closed once again. So, he silently traced the letters he so desperately wanted to speak aloud into words on the delicate skin of his wrist.
Bobby shows Dean to his bedroom: 107MA. There are clean sheets on a little twin bed, everything just as beige here as the rest of the place. A tiny closet in the corner, a small dresser with seven sets of matching dark green scrubs, and a little bag full of toiletries.
So he’s silent. Silent when he turns on the car, silent as he revs the engine, silent all the way to the liquor store. He silently drinks a third of a bottle of whiskey on the floor of his room in the apartment, and he’s silent when Sam comes home from school and asks if he’s there.
At that, Dean looks up for a second. Castiel is gazing at him with a touch of sympathy from his perch on the bed. Dean jots down
Charlie looks at him, eyes weepy again. Something about her expression makes him remember the first time that Dean told Sam he was proud of him, after a middle school band concert. Sam had practiced for weeks on the shitty second-hand clarinet that Dean worked so hard to save up for, and he got a solo. And the solo was bad, but that was his little brother, and Dean said he did such a great job. And Sam looked at him the way Charlie looks at him now, and something in his chest twists. Hard.
His eyes flick up to the clock on the wall, sees that their hour is up. Without another word, Dean rises from his chair and walks out the door -- he slams it on the way out, relishing in the noise as it crashes into the frame. The tears have long since dried on his cheeks, but he wipes his eyes anyway and walks back to his room.
When he speaks, his voice is soft, trembling. “It’s a danger because she tends to the cuts, because she’s a friend and it’s her job here. And it’s a danger because I’ve injected with dirty needles, and now I’m sick. I’ve got hepatitis, Dean, since you want to know everything about me so badly.”
“I know that this probably feels a little scary, but don’t worry about it. And you don’t have to say anything back to me until we get to the questionnaire, too. And, not to be unprofessional,” she says, leaning in and stage-whispering: “you would not

And he always does, and she always brings it to him with a warm smile and a gentle hand on the top of his head.
He shrinks away again, tucking his gaze somewhere safe along the back of the room. Ellen sighs and lets her head fall forward a little. “Dean. You have to trust me. It’s just gonna be a short conversation with a doctor. Charlie can be with you, or me. I think we have to tackle this if we’re gonna keep going with planning out your discharge.”
But it’ll make Jody sad if he doesn’t. So Dean sighs and walks back, adjusting the cutlery as he goes.
And those are two things that Dean can’t think about. Not without whiskey, at least. So he meets Bobby’s gaze, ignores the rising discomfort and malaise filling out his chest, and shrugs his shoulders.
Dean hugs the notepad to his chest, tries to push away the aching there. Without meeting the other man's gaze, he nods and follows him back into the hall.
He gets so drunk after Sam goes to bed that he thinks he’ll die by the morning. But somehow, he doesn’t. Instead, he wakes up covered in vomit with a terrified little brother shaking his shoulder and holding a hand to his neck.
“Dean. Your body is your own, always. No matter how others have treated it. It belongs to you, and it’s a wonderful thing,” he says, like it’s nothing. Like he didn’t just send a tidal wave crashing over Dean’s head, like he didn’t just crack his ribs open.
of these things. What to eat, how to dress, how to spend his time, what to say to Bobby or Ellen. The illusion is safe, and warm, and it makes Dean happy.
tw: discussion of prostitution, mention of child abuse, mention of drug use, mention of unspecified violence
What feels worse is the shame that comes with the quiet. Shame cloaks Dean’s entire perspective of himself and the world, but this is something different. The other things he’s ashamed of are things that he chose to do; they disgust him, but at least he picked those things. The silence, however -- it’s different. An innate failure.
He turns to walk back to his room, already trying to figure out what to write in his sappy letter to Cas, when Adam calls back out to him.
“It doesn’t matter, though. You’re leading this, telling everyone they should love themselves and shit like that. How can you do that when you’ve probably never been where we have?”
He swallows. He thought he’d been doing a better job of hiding it from Sam -- but that wasn’t even the worst of it. Because the answer was definitely much, much higher.
Dean shrugs a bit too hard a little too fast, simultaneously desperate to know more about this person who Cas had
Taking his momentary stop as a good sign, Ellen smiles. “What did that asshole say this time? Seems like he should give people pep talks at the Olympics with this kind of track record.”
The older man sighs deeply. “Protocol to take it back front, kid. You’ll get it back by tonight, I promise.”
Underneath the short note is a little drawing of a diamondback pattern. Next to the pattern is a messy sentence that’s been scribbled out, replaced by a picture of a bee.
Dean nods once, and Benny leans close to him on one elbow. With his other hand resting on the corner of the table, he subtly points to a boy who looks even younger than Dean. He’s got dark hair cropped close to his skull and big brown eyes -- he looks like someone Sam may have befriended in high school, and the idea makes his heart hurt.
“Hello, you must be new! I’m Garth, so happy to have you here,” he says, extending a hand for Dean to shake. He does, gingerly, before staring at Garth in question. The other man looks at him for a second before exclaiming. “Oh, yes! Of course, never been here before -- just take a seat inside, once everyone’s here we’ll go over our options for today.”
in a few hours; he can’t imagine wasting all of that effort on talking in a group session with a ton of people he still barely knows.
Despite his best efforts, a tear sneaks down his cheek. Dean opens his eyes and looks at Charlie, her pen in hand and the paper flipped open to the second page. It’s too late now, and Charlie’s watching him fall apart.
She pauses for a beat, looks at Dean a long time. Her eyes aren’t scary -- she isn’t digging for why he doesn’t like talking to Bobby. He doesn’t have to tell her that he doesn’t want to talk to Bobby anymore because he looks at him and thinks about his dad being disappointed in everything that he is, sees client after disgusting client, sees people who have made him hate himself even more. He doesn’t have to say it.
The last two hours of the film felt like two seconds, and when the credits rolled away Dean sat in the darkness for a while. Sam breathed softly, in and out, as he slept; Dean always tossed and turned throughout the night, but Sam slept like the dead no matter where he was.
Scrambling to his feet, Dean opens his mouth to speak when he realizes that he has no idea what Cas is doing. Reaching into the back of his dresser, he retrieves a bulky object. Even in the darkness, Dean recognizes it; his heart starts to beat faster, and the panic is replaced with something bright, happy.
His eyes lock onto the small slice. The crust is craggly and uneven, the center a dark cinnamon color; homemade.
Dean’s heart stutters in his chest. Thanksgiving is just a few days after he gets out of rehab -- his first time seeing Sam in three months. Well, supposed to be.
Kevin left Dean a note telling him that parents don’t control your life, and Ash gave him a physics textbook that he didn’t want anymore. Dean hasn’t found it yet, but there’s a note hidden inside the seventh chapter that tells him he’s smart enough to get it -- he just has to try. Rufus gave him a rough pat on the shoulder and told him that he could be better than his father. Benny gives him time.
Charlie reaches out to pat his arm, and he jerks back from her. “I’m sorry,” she says, and he doesn’t look at her but he knows that her face is remorseful. “I’m sorry.”
Dean thinks; and while Castiel is clearly a strong dude, he’s not that type of person. He’s got crazy hair and makes art and saves people he’s never met -- he’s not a Novak, certainly not a Castiel. Dean has an idea, but he mulls it over in his head before softly testing out the word in his mouth -- there’s no one close enough to hear him whisper.
Dean heaves out a breath and pushes off the wall. He walks down the hallway to the narcotics ward and doesn’t allow himself to hesitate at Cas’s door.
“Who decides that someone’s worth saving? Worth recovering?” He laughs, and it's a harsh sound in the newfound quiet of the room. “What makes you the expert?”
She stops five feet away from Dean and extends the pen and paper. “Come sit in the Sunshine room, it’s empty. You can talk to me instead. Promise I won’t make you run laps.”
Three rings, then he picks up. “Hey, Cas,” Sam says, voice bright. “How are you and Dean doing? You gonna mail me a bracelet yet?”
Dean stands and lets his hand rest on the doorknob for a second before opening the door to find Bobby on the other side. His arms are crossed over his chest, head tilted back and analyzing Dean in the new scrubs. Dean’s (Dad’s) jacket is tucked under one arm.
The first thing Dean notices when he wakes up is a dull throb in his left wrist. Before he opens his eyes, he feels the pain and reaches over with his other hand to grab it; but instead of finding his own skin, he feels something plastic, foreign. He cracks one eye open to see a tube sticking out of his arm, IV placed on his forearm right above his wrist. Eyes tracking further up his arm, he notices gauze taped to the inside of his elbow and on the other side of his arm too. He makes an attempt to sit up, but his skull feels like it’s full of water -- his head lolls to the side, and he groans with the effort of trying to twist his neck around.
Everything Dean wrote out just became irrelevant due to Sam’s question, and he scribbles over it angrily. This activity is way more frustrating than he was anticipating, and he still hasn’t gotten a chance to say any of the things he wants to say to Sam -- he’s already exhausted.
Pausing for a moment, he scrapes his nails down his arms just to feel something that isn’t the freezing air around him. It feels colder here than it did last December, huddled outside some rich asshole’s mansion in the boonies, blood dripping --
Castiel doesn’t look up at the note until he finishes the final fold, and a strange expression crosses his face when he does. He looks at Dean, tips his head slightly to the side.
Cas lifts an eyebrow. “After a week of barely speaking with me at all? Did your last drunkard friend check out today?”
“A good host definitely would have given me a little more warning to sneak out. For future reference,” Cas says, offering him a long look before he puts his scrub top back on. “I’ll see you tonight.”
Light pours in through the window high on the wall, casting a soft glow on the edge of Castiel’s bare shoulder blade. Dean traces over the curve with his eyes from his bed, longing to follow the curve with his fingertips instead. Cas glows golden in the morning sun. Even on the hard floor of Dean’s room, he sleeps soundly.
Dean actually laughs this time. “Pep isn’t exactly my specialty, so glad it helped. You should go to bed. And here,” he says, extending one of the containers of pie. “For later.”
Dean likes to tell himself that it was his choice. It’s the only way to make it bearable. But he’s had a hard time with food, since then -- ever since he started junior year. Eating was always a complicated thing, and he saw it as a necessity to keep the machine of his body moving rather than something in which to find joy, create family.
Dean fights back the blush in his cheeks, then scrawls out his name. Castiel leans over and reads it aloud, returning to his spot and looking Dean straight on. Dean notices that he has a nice mouth.
“I know it feels terrifying. But you’ve gotta let someone in. It doesn’t have to be me, it can be Ellen, or someone else on the ward. But you have to do it.”
Dr. L***y is in her forties, with short black hair and dark skin. The kindness in her eyes shifts, for a second. And Dean isn’t that perceptive a lot of the time, but he can see that she gets sad for that second.
“He just -- I don’t know. He looked like he wanted to murder me, and then he pushed me. And that freaked me out, so I stopped talking, then he told me something important but I couldn’t fucking
Jody is working later than she should -- which is expected -- and Dean can see the lights from the back of the kitchen flooding out into the dining hall in long yellow stripes. A sigh escapes his lips as he moves forward, excited to find refuge in Jody’s kitchen. She served pie today at lunch, and he knows there’s going to be an extra slice in the kitchen. She always saves him one.
“Took you long enough, kid,” he says, but there’s no bite to the words. His eyes are tired. “Charlie passed your meds off to me, got a little pill cup and some water just for you in my office.”
Dean feels two conflicting sensations tighten around his ribs at the same time, and two thoughts flit through his mind: the first one, soft, is
He stares at the little message, the barely-legible curves of Castiel’s script. At the front of the room, Dean hears Garth speaking to him: “Novak, when are you gonna make me one of those? How do I get up further on your friend list?”
In his periphery he notices everyone else standing and getting together to talk, a few people leaving the room for a few minutes alone in their rooms. Numb, Dean follows an older man -- Rufus, he thinks -- into the hallway. He pauses just outside the doorway to lean against the wall, and he closes his eyes for a second.
he thinks, a bout of self-consciousness drifting through him. Castiel, after all, has looked kind of magical throughout this entire weird thing. After his third time stealing glances at the other man, Dean realized that his eyes being so freakishly blue hadn’t been a trick of the light, like he’d thought before. The guy just
He was hoping to get some comfort this morning. Over the past few days, Dean has slowly gotten more comfortable with other people Telling Him It’s Okay. But in the real world, that’s usually his job -- hold his mother through her pain, help his father get up after a bad night, clasp Sam’s hand in his own on the way to school. So, staring at Charlie’s rigid posture and sad eyes, Dean puts back on his Caretaker Hat and crosses the room.
Dean turns around and looks at him straight on now. He sets his mouth into a firm line and examines the kid in front of him. Thin, pale, dark shadows under the eyes.
There’s a silhouette halfway down the hall in front of him, and Dean can already tell that it isn’t a patient. Members of the ward have a unique downward slope of the shoulders; there’s an inherent shame of being admitted, even if it’s the first step to getting better. Even the most outspoken members, like Benny or Zachariah, carry themselves with timidity.
In Cas’s absence, Charlie had drawn a few dogs with him, but even her Picasso pooches weren’t enough to change Dean’s sour mood.
be. He’s always going to be, and everyone in his life is going to get ripped away just like everyone at Hope Valley will be ripped away. Charlie, Ellen, Benny, Kevin, Bobby, Cas. Caught up in the routine and the friendships, it felt like a utopia for a little bit; full of other people fucked up in the same way. People who tried to understand, people who listened. For the first time in his life, Dean hadn’t felt alone.
Dean waves at him before walking back down the hall, finding the glass doors again. When he tugs his jacket back on, it smells faintly of lavender.
Group therapy passes by him in a haze again even though Ellen is leading this time. And Ellen has a decidedly more aggressive counseling style than Bobby; she calls on people to talk, forces them to crack open and share. She’s tough, but never unkind -- Dean is pretty sure that’s why she doesn’t call on him once the entire session. It’s taking up all of his energy just to
After a second of staring at the door, Dean turns back around and writes something else down on the notepad.
looks embarrassing. But Cas doesn’t mention it, and they keep working in companionable silence until Garth tells them all to pack up and move on to group sessions in five minutes.
Dean looks down at his hands and fidgets. He can feel the heat of Benny’s gaze right next to him, Ellen staring him down from the front of the room -- he’s scared to look up at anyone, because he doesn’t know what he’ll see. When he raises his head, Dean decides to keep his eyes on Cas; this isn’t new to him. He’s prepared for it, he’s heard it already. He knows what Cas is going to look like. He’s going to look normal, and he’s not going to stare at Dean with huge eyes and gaping mouths like everyone else.
Dean feels his shoulders shake, and he shrugs again so that he has something to do with them other than trembling in place. It only works for a second though, and then he realizes that he’s back to shaking again -- not only is he back to shaking, but the tremors have traveled down his arms and into his ribs. He tries to take a deep breath, but his lungs feel tight.
Dean’s mouth ticks downward, and his eyes shift to the base of the ugly lamp casting an ugly yellow light into the room. He wants to smash it, and the windows, and punch the doctor.
With only two more people ahead of him, he looks down at his hands where he's tracing over the bracelets on his wrist. And he thinks
“The doors aren’t alarmed until midnight, if you want to come finish your bracelet sometime. Or try some methadone,” he says, voice dry. Dean’s eyes widen, and Castiel huffs out a laugh that has no right being as gorgeous as it is. “Don’t worry, I’ll keep all the opiates to myself.”
“You can do this. There are bumps in the road for everybody. But we’re here to help you become a Jedi Knight, not a Sith Lord.”
You taught me how to make these! I stole this from you!” Dean exclaims, brandishing his wrist as though it’s irrefutable evidence of Castiel’s intrinsic value. He almost grabs Cas's wrist to show him the dozen rings of beautiful thread, but he sees another white bandage on his other arm and decides that he doesn't want to risk hurting him. He wonders about the bandages, but files away that question for later; for now, he's on a mission. “And you went to Columbia! You’re great at school, you’re the smartest fucking person here.”
Dean scoffs. “Oh, so I was supposed to sleep on the floor after all of that?” His heart is beating fast and hard against his ribs, anxiety in his chest. He knows it’s a joke. They’re joking. But he just acknowledged everything last night. And he knows that Cas isn’t going to use it to hurt him, because he trusts Cas enough to tell him in the first place.
